 North Korea:
 The Party Elite and
 the Succession Issue
 Summary         President Kim 11-song rules North Korea with an iron hand, and the
 Information available personality cult surrounding him has grown to unprecedented heights.
 as of I September 1983 Within the North, the exploits of the "Great Leader" are synonymous with
 was used in this report.
 the history of the country. His speeches and on-the-spot guidance are
 immediately transformed into party policy. Kim 11-song is now attempting
 to develop this same aura of infallible leadership for his son and heir
 apparent, Kim Chong-il.
 Kim 11-song, mindful of events in the USSR and China following the
 deaths of Stalin and Mao, clearly hopes that installing his son Kim Chong-
 il as his successor will forestall any rapid dismantling of his own policies
 and personality cult. Most significant for US and South Korean interests,
 an orderly transfer of power to Kim Chong-il is, we judge, the outcome
 most likely to ensure the continuation of a hostile and militant regime in
 P'yongyang-a regime that clings to the belief it can achieve reunification
 of the peninsula on its own terms, by force if necessary.
 Despite the highly personalized leadership styles of the two Kims, the
 Korean Workers Party-as the ruling Communist Party is titled-remains
 a vital instrument of control. Borrowing from both the Chinese and Soviet
 models, the party has its own codified rules, complex structure, and
 operational norms. With over 2 million members, the party counts in its
 ranks one out of every 10 persons in North Korea. The Political Bureau of
 the Central Committee sits at the apex of this large party structure.
 In the Political Bureau the influence of the veteran guerrilla leaders who
 rose to power with Kim II-song is waning and is likely to decline
 precipitously in the next several years. The influence of leaders in the 50-
 to-60-year age bracket will grow accordingly. The regime is taking steps to
 manage carefully this generational change within the elite. Some senior
 leaders in critical positions are being eased into retirement. The size of the
 Political Bureau has been increased, thus allowing for an infusion of new
 blood.
 Nevertheless, we judge that Kim Chong-il's supporters are attempting-to
 use the expansion of the Political Bureau as an opportunity to strengthen
 support for the younger Kim's succession. Some of the second-generation
 leaders may indeed owe their current positions in part to their endorsement

 of Kim Chong-il and the succession plan.
 IWe believe, however, that some
 second-generation leaders who have worked their way up through the
 postwar system-while loyal to Kim 11-song-may not in all cases be
 indebted to Kim Chong-il.
 Political maneuvering is likely to intensify as Kim 11-song's passing from
 the scene draws nearer. Given the many unknowns in the leadership
 equation in P'yongyang, changes in the alignment of the Political Bureau
 are likely to evoke quite diverse interpretations on the part of outside
 observers.
 This study seeks to shed some light on the political alignment and relative
 importance of the 32 officials, who, along with Kim I1-song and Kim
 Chong-il, currently make up the bureau. It begins by identifying the
 principal interest groups or factions on the Political Bureau. These include:
 ? Veteran guerrilla fighters.
 ? Second-generation leaders.
 ? The military.
 ? The technocrats.
 ? Province leaders and others.
 The study then analyzes Kim Chong-il's position and discusses some of the
 methods-and the pitfalls-in attempting to identify his allies on the
 Political Bureau.

 North Korea:
 The Party Elite and
 the Succession Issue
 The Political Bureau:
 Major Interest Groups
 Because President Kim 11-song dominates the political
 scene in North Korea, other leaders on the Political
 Bureau tend to remain in the background. As a result,
 it is difficult to identify factions or interest groups.
 Because of the lack of reliable biographical data,
 there are problems even distinguishing officials by
 profession or age group.
 Veteran Guerrilla Fighters
 One group that clearly stands apart is made up of the
 veterans who participated with Kim 11-song in the
 guerrilla campaigns against the Japanese occupation
 forces in the 1930s. The regime itself has called
 attention to the close-knit identity of this group by
 publishing periodic remembrances by these guerrilla
 veterans. The group includes eight full members of
 the Political Bureau. They are, in rank order, Vice
 President Kim Il, Defense Minister 0 Chin-u, Vice
 President Pak Song-chol, Vice President Yim Chun-
 chu, Control Committee Chairman So Chol, Gen. 0
 Paek-yong, and Colonel Generals Chon Mun-sop and
 Paek Hak-nim. Presumably they constitute a solid
 core of loyal support on the Political Bureau. All of
 these officials, with the exception of Chon Mun-sop
 and Paek Hak-nim, are over 70 years old.
 Defense Minister 0 Chin-u clearly is the most power-
 ful military leader in North Korea today. Elevated to
 chief of the general staff in the late 1960s and to
 Defense Minister in 1976, General 0 represents conti-
 nuity within the armed forces hierarchy.
 Gen. 0 Paek-yong, although relatively inactive, serves
 on the government's prestigious National Defense
 Commission. He is believed to supervise North
 Korea's large paramilitary and reserve forces. Col.
 Gen. Chon Mun-sop, Kim's bodyguard in the early
 years, is believed to control the internal security forces
 responsible for providing protection for the President
 and his son. Chon has not appeared in public since
 September 1982 and may be in poor health.
 Col. Gen. Paek Hak-nim, although a guerrilla veter-
 an, was elevated to the Political Bureau only in 1978.
 He is a vice minister of defense. In the fall of 1981
 Paek headed an official North Korean delegation to a
 number of countries in Africa that have military
 cooperation agreements with P'yongyang. North
 Korea has dispatched a number of military advisers to
 several of the countries visited by General Paek.
 So Chol, as chairman of the Control Commission,
 enforces party discipline. He is not an active military
 officer and he does not control any security forces.
 Nevertheless, he is in a position to wield influence
 because of the discretionary punitive powers of his
 commission. For example, political foes can be fully
 prosecuted for party wrongdoings while allies can
 merely be admonished or let off with minimum
 disciplinary action.
 Kim Il, Pak Song-chol, and Yim Chun-chu, who serve
 as vice presidents, appear to perform mainly ceremo-
 nial tasks and also lead delegations to foreign coun-
 tries. Although these individuals at one time may
 have held considerable power, they have, in effect,
 been moved into semiretirement. Kim Il's health, in
 particular, is poor.
 Second-Generation Leaders
 About a dozen members of the Political Bureau could
 be described as second-generation leaders. Most are
 50 to 60 years old. They have made their way up the
 ladder in the postwar years. For the most part, they do
 not appear to have suffered setbacks along the way.

 Political Bureau is contained in the appendix

 Five out of 12 of these second-generation officials
 hold positions in the central party apparatus. Kim
 Chung-nim, in his early sixties, is party secretary
 responsible for North Korea's campaign of political
 action and subversion against South Korea. Except
 for a brief hiatus in the mid-1970s, he has held this
 assignment since 1969. Kim has been characterized
 In point of fact, P'yongyang's attempts to build a
 viable clandestine organization in the South have
 proved largely ineffective. Kim Chung-nim is also
 believed to be in charge of all North Korean intelli-
 gence operations.
 Kim Yong-nam, in his fifties, is one of North Korea's
 leading foreign affairs experts. As the director of the
 party's International Department since the early
 1970s, Kim has played a major role in opening the
 door to official relations with many foreign countries
 by initiating contacts with leftist parties and other
 influential groups. Kim has served as a party secre-
 tary since 1975. In July 1980 Kim met with US
 Representative Stephen Solarz, the first American
 political figure to visit North Korea since the war.
 Poor health recently kept
 Kim sidelined for about eight months.
 Much less is known about the three other central
 party officials. Choe Yong-nim, who first joined the
 Political Bureau in 1980 as an alternate member, was
 promoted to full membership in August 1982. In his
 fifties, Choe is the director of an unidentified depart-
 ment of the Central Committee. Kim Tu-nam and
 Chon Pyong-ho, both in their fifties, were named
 alternate members of the Political Bureau in 1982.
 Kim is director of an unidentified department of the
 Central Committee; Chon's position is unknown.
 So Yun-sok, also in his fifties, has been chief secre-
 tary of the P'yongyang City party committee since
 1978. The P'yongyang post has served in the past as a
 springboard for higher positions in the central power
 structure; First Vice Premier Kang Song-san, for
 example, held this post in the early 1970s. Like Choe
 Yong-nim, So was promoted to full membership in
 August 1982. Both men merit close watching.
 Four of the 12 second-generation leaders on the
 Political Bureau are vice premiers in the State Ad-
 ministration Council-North Korea's cabinet. Kang
 Song-san, in his fifties, was designated "first" vice
 premier in August 1982. He appears to have assumed
 much of the responsibility for supervising the econo-

 variety of party and government posts. He reportedly

 heavy industry, was only recently transferred from

 rise since the mid-1970s. His assignment as vice
 premier could result in a sharpened rivalry with Kang
 Song-san.
 Vice Premier Ho Tam has been Foreign Minister
 since 1970. About 54, Ho has played a key role in
 carrying out North Korea's ambitious efforts to ex-
 pand its diplomatic representation in the Third
 World. Ho has been North Korea's principal contact
 with the Nonaligned Movement and he is the only
 Political Bureau official to have visited the United
 States, where he attended the UN General Assembly
 session in the fall of 1977.
 Educated at Moscow University in the late 1940s, Ho
 reportedly is related by marriage to Kim 11-song.
 Vice Premier Chong Chun-ki, in his late fifties, is the
 regime's chief spokesman. He has traveled extensively
 and is said to have a good memory for facts and
 statistics. His career has been devoted almost exclu-
 sively to propaganda activities. His political status has
 not changed much since he first joined the Political
 Bureau as an alternate member in the early 1970s.

 a North Korea may be isolated from the rest of the world
 community, but its vigorous diplomatic competition with South
 Korea keeps its leading officials on the road. This table reflects the
 number of publicized foreign visits by Political Bureau members and
 alternates over the past 10 years.
 Influence of the Military
 In North Korea the military and security services
 have always had a strong voice in the Political Bureau
 and other leadership councils. The military's influence
 derives from the early days of the regime when Kim
 and his partisans battled the Japanese and when Kim
 in 1950 tried to seize control of the peninsula by force.
 It has been reinforced in subsequent years both by
 Kim's continued adherence to a confrontational policy
 toward the South and by the heavy allocation of
 manpower and material resources to sustain North
 Korea's extensive military forces.
 As noted earlier, four of the eight guerrilla veterans
 (0 Chin-u, 0 Paek-yong, Chon Mun-sop and Paek
 Hak-nim) are still on active duty. In addition, among
 the second-generation leaders on the Political Bureau,
 the armed forces are represented by the chief of the
 general staff and his ranking deputy.
 Col. Gen. 0 Kuk-yol, in his fifties, has served as Chief
 of the General Staff since 1979 and as a full member
 of the Political Bureau since 1980. He apparently was
 promoted over a number of more senior officers. As a
 career Air Force officer, 0 Kuk-yol's appointment is
 viewed as another indication that P'yongyang intends
 to increase its emphasis on joint service operations. 0
 Kuk-yol reportedly was also a classmate of Kim
 Chong-il's at the Mangyongdae Institute. According
 to some accounts, he is the nephew of Gen. 0 Chin-u.
 Lt. Gen. Kim Kang-hwan is the First Deputy Chief of
 General Staff. Not much is known about Kim's
 background, although he is believed to be in his fifties.
 Kim Kang-hwan appears to be the only active duty
 officer among the 15 alternate members on the
 Political Bureau.
 The influence of the military goes beyond the number
 of uniformed personnel on the Political Bureau. The
 armed forces are viewed as a major avenue for

 upward mobility in North Korea. Many officers re-
 portedly retire early to pursue lucrative careers in the
 party and government: Undoubtedly the shared expe-
 riences and close ties developed in the military profes-
 sion are carried along by these officials throughout
 their careers.
 The Technocrats
 In North Korea the role played by technocrats in the
 Political Bureau appears to be quite different from
 that seen in the leading organs of other Communist
 societies. It is a common phenomenon in Communist
 societies that, as the state develops and grows more
 complex, officials with special technical skills begin to
 exercise a growing influence in the leadership. In
 North Korea, however, the development of a highly
 skilled group of technocrats in the Political Bureau
 and the society at large has been sharply retarded by
 excessive adherence to Kim II-song's widely publi-
 cized ideology of self-reliance or chuche.
 Kim 11-song frequently has reiterated the need to
 develop technological skills and to apply selectively
 foreign experiences to North Korea's development
 problems. But these exhortations are largely swept
 aside by the far greater emphasis on self-reliance as
 the only way to maintain independence and sovereign-
 ty. Kim's chuche policy, first enunciated in the 1950s,
 was given added impetus following the Sino-Soviet
 split in the early 1960s. By the late 1960s, North
 Korea virtually ended the practice of sending officials
 and students to other Communist states for advanced
 training, although some North Korean specialists
 apparently are still receiving training at a Soviet
 nuclear research institute.
 As a result, foreign-trained technocrats are becoming
 a vanishing species in North Korea. The impact has
 been widespread.
 North
 Korea is relying on production techniques that are
 often 20 years behind the times. There were numerous
 accounts in the 1970s that industrial equipment or-
 dered from abroad remained unopened or unassem-
 bled because North Korean technicians lacked the
 necessary skills or were prevented from seeking assist-
 ance from their foreign counterparts.
 A number of veteran technocrats accompanied the
 Kim II-song regime into power or were trained abroad
 in the 1950s. They are valued by the regime for the
 competence they bring to bear on managing what has
 become an increasingly complex economy. But these
 technocrats have no constituency and no independent
 power base. They frequently have served as scape-
 goats for errors made by overzealous party
 bureaucrats.
 Premier Yi Chong-ok, in his late sixties, is the best
 known of North Korea's technocrats. In the mid-
 1950s, Yi, as chairman of the State Planning Com-
 mittee, was instrumental in organizing North Korea's
 first five-year plan. Yi held several important posts in
 the heavy industry sector during the seven-year plan
 in the 1960s, but Yi was demoted when the plan had
 to be extended by three years to reach its assigned
 goals.
 Yi regained favor in the early 1970s, and in 1977 he
 was named Premier to provide leadership for North
 Korea's current seven-year plan (1978-84). As a meas-
 ure of his prestige, Yi was included in the five-man
 Presidium of the Political Bureau organized at the
 Sixth Party Congress. Yi received his training in
 Manchuria at the Harbin Technical College.
 Party secretary Yon Hyong-muk is an industrial
 specialist and economic planner who has held posi-
 tions both in light and heavy industry. In his late
 fifties, Yon has the longest continuous service on the
 party Secretariat. He has frequently accompanied
 both Kim II-song and Kim Chong-il on inspection
 tours. Yon acquired technical training in Czechoslo-
 vakia in the 1950s.
 Party secretary Hyon Mu-kwang, about 70, is one of
 North Korea's most durable industrial management
 specialists. Hyon has served as an alternate member
 of the Political Bureau on an on-again, off-again basis
 for the past 20 years. He reached a personal peak in
 1970 as party secretary for industry when he ranked
 12th in the overall leadership. Hyon was assigned as a

 provincial leader in the heavily industrialized north-
 east region from 1977 to 1981, but he returned to the
 Secretariat by late 1981.
 Vice Premier Kye Ung-tae, in his sixties, is the
 regime's leading foreign trade specialist. As Minister
 of Foreign Trade from 1967 to 1977, Kye presided
 over a rapid growth in North Korea's commercial
 relations with the non-Communist world. Kye has had
 to deal with irate trading partners displeased with
 P'yongyang's unwillingness even to discuss measures
 to remedy its persistent foreign indebtedness. His
 courteous and tactful style have helped ease tensions.
 Kye studied in both Manchuria and the USSR. Kye
 became the first political casualty following the 1980
 party congress; he was demoted in October 1981 from
 full to alternate membership on the Political Bureau.
 Kye's duties as vice premier do not appear to have
 been affected, however.
 Hamgyong Province), Hong Song-nam (South Pyon-
 gan Province), Yi Kun-mo (Nampo City), and Kang
 Hui-won (Chongjin City). Nampo and Chongjin, be-
 cause of their size and industrial development, are
 treated administratively like provinces.
 These local leaders, unlike P'yongyang City chief So
 Yun-sok who is often seen with the central leadership,
 spend most of their time in their own bailiwicks. They
 are outside the mainstream. A provincial post can,
 nonetheless, serve as a steppingstone for higher ad-
 vancement in the party.
 A few officials on the Political Bureau do not fit
 neatly into any of the groupings. Vice Premier Choe
 Kwang is a former senior military leader who has
 recently been rehabilitated after undergoing a long
 period of reeducation. Chong Kyong-hui, the only
 woman of the Political Bureau, has a long association
 with anti-South Korean operations; her influence in
 the inner councils of the party is not clear. Lastly, Yi
 Son-sil remains largely a question mark. Because he
 makes only rare appearances, it is difficult to deter-
 mine if he is still an alternate member of the Political
 Bureau.
 and capable economist. In 1982 Kong was named Kim Chong-il's Position
 Vice Premier Kong Chin-tae, like Kye Ung-tae, has
 spent most of his career managing North Korea's
 foreign economic relations. As Minister of External
 Economic Affairs during most of the 1970s, Kong
 traveled extensively to negotiate foreign aid agree-
 ments. About 60, he has been described as a tactful
 chairman of a newly created Trade Committee, sug-
 gesting at the time that he was assuming greater
 control in that long-troubled sector from Kye Ung-
 tae. More recently, Kong has been inactive and may
 have been demoted.
 Province Leaders and Others
 As the North Korean economy has become more
 complex, P'yongyang has moved to strengthen eco-
 nomic management in the provinces. In 1981 North
 Korea instituted a new system of economic guidance
 committees at the provincial level and gave these
 committees certain functions and perquisites previous-
 ly reserved for the central bureaucracy.
 On the political side, too, the authority of the province
 chiefs has been upgraded in recent years. Four local
 party chiefs concurrently hold alternate membership
 on the Political Bureau. They are: Cho Se-ung (North
 The regime used the Sixth Party Congress in October
 1980 as the occasion to unveil publicly Kim 11-song's
 scheme to install his eldest son, Kim Chong-il, as his
 successor. The younger Kim, making his first publi-
 cized appearance, was designated fourth-ranked
 member of the Political Bureau. Kim Chong-il also     25X1

 distinction shared only by Kim II-song.
 The Secretariat is headed by General Secretary Kim
 11-song. Kim Chong-il, as the ranking secretary under
 the elder Kim probably exercises control over organi-
 zational and personnel affairs. He is in a unique
 position to influence promotions and demotions within

 the party. Kim Chong-il's membership on the Mili-
 tary Commission is undoubtedly intended to demon-
 strate his credentials as a military as well as party
 leader.
 As the fourth-ranked member of the Political Bureau,
 Kim Chong-il gained membership on the five-member
 Presidium. The implications for his eventual succes-
 sion are obvious; the other four members of the
 Presidium-Kim 11-song, Kim Il, 0 Chin-u, and Yi
 Chong-ok-are all in their seventies. Since the con-
 gress, he has moved up to second place in periodic
 leadership turnouts, bypassing Defense Minister 0
 Chin-u in 1981 and moving ahead of senior Vice
 President Kim Il by early 1983.
 Kim Chong-il's Allies
 Kim II-song's unprecedented hereditary succession
 scheme, although kept under wraps until 1980, had
 become public knowledge by the late 1970s. During
 the 1970s outside observers tended to view every
 promotion and demotion in the party hierarchy as
 directly related to the succession issue. It was widely
 assumed, for example, that any North Korean official
 whose career prospered after 1973-the year the
 succession scheme moved into high gear-was a
 supporter of Kim Chong-il.
 This tendency was particularly strong if the official
 was relatively young. The notion that these officials
 were riding on Kim Chong-il's coattails does not
 square with subsequent developments. Several offi-
 cials who rose to prominence in the 1973-75 period
 subsequently fell into disfavor.
 The Political Bureau announced at the Sixth Con-
 gress in October 1980 showed a marked increase in
 size from its predecessors. Nineteen full members and
 15 alternate members were named compared with
 only 11 full members and four alternates named at
 each of the three previous party congresses. Most of
 the 34 officials had in fact.been appointed to the
 Political Bureau during the 1970s, but it was a major
 step for the 1980 Congress to formalize the expansion.
 We believe that Kim Chong-il and his supporters used
 the congress as an occasion to reward existing allies
 and to gain new ones.
 There remains, nevertheless, the knotty problem of
 distinguishing supporters of Kim Chong-il from those
 who are passive or even hostile toward the succession
 Nepotism is commonplace in North Korea and it adds
 another factor to the leadership equation. Vice Presi-
 dent Pak Song-chol, First Vice Premier Kang Song-
 san, Vice Premier Ho Tam, and Chongjin City chief
 secretary Kang Hui-won reportedly are all related by
 marriage to the senior Kim. The younger Kim pre-
 sumably can rely on them as allies.
 Family relationships are complex, however. Kim
 Chong-il's mother died in 1949, and Kim 11-song
 remarried and has additional children by that mar-
 riage~
 Now that Kim Chong-il is appearing in public, there
 is a somewhat better basis for determining at least
 some of his putative supporters. Since the party
 congress, Kim Chong-il has personally led 12 publi-
 cized inspection tours in North Korea. He is invari-
 ably accompanied on these visits by several other
 Political Bureau officials. We know that these appear-
 ances are closely scrutinized not only by outsiders but
 also by the North Korean officials themselves. In
 some cases the nature of the event may dictate which
 officials are to be present. But it is reasonable to
 assume that officials who appear repeatedly with Kim
 Chong-il are close allies or at least willing to be
 perceived as such.

 The following tabulation reflects the number of times
 individual Political Bureau officials accompanied Kim
 Chong-il on visits between May 1981 and June 1983:
 Defense Minister 0 Chin-u
 9
 Party Secretary Yon Hyong-muk
 8
 Foreign Minister Ho Tam
 7
 Party Secretary Kim Chung-nim
 6
 Party Secretary Kim Yong-nam
 4
 In addition, four other Political Bureau officials have
 accompanied Kim Chong-il on one or two occasions.
 Another method of assessing the attitude of individual
 North Korean leaders toward the succession issue is to
 examine their public statements. Since the party
 congress, North Korean officials have been routinely
 praising the role of the "party center"-an honorific
 expression used as a cover term for Kim Chong-il. This
 cover term was useful to the regime before the public
 unveiling of Kim Chong-il, and it is still used in much
 of the media discussion about domestic affairs.
 A few Political Bureau officials have gone beyond the
 routine expressions of support for Kim Chong-il. For
 example, Defense Minister 0 Chin-u was very expan-
 sive in his evaluation of the younger Kim's visit to
 China in June 1983. 0 Chin-u disclosed details about
 the visit not previously publicized by P'yongyang.
 Party Secretary Kim Yong-nam was the official
 selected in March 1982 to present Kim Chong-il's
 first major publicized theoretical work, a so-called
 treatise on elder Kim's chuche ideology. Significantly,
 both 0 Chin-u and Kim Yong-nam are among those
 who have often accompanied the son on inspection
 tours.
 Impact of Generational Change
 If Kim Chong-il is to inherit the mantle of leadership
 from his father, he will have to outmaneuver not one
 but two generations of leaders in the North Korean
 Political Bureau. There seems little doubt now that
 the son has crossed the first hurdle-the veteran
 guerrilla leaders of Kim II-song's generation.
 0 Chin-u, one of the most active and powerful among
 The visit to China by Comrade Kim Chong-il, the
 leader of our party, some time ago at the kind
 invitation of respected Comrade Hu Yaobang marked
 a new milestone in keeping bright the glorious tradi-
 tion of the Korea-China friendship, which was sealed
 in blood in the flames of the arduous revolutionary
 struggle and has withstood the grim trial of history.
 During his recent visit to China Comrade Kim
 Chong-il had historic meetings with respected Com-
 rades Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, Li Xiannian,
 Zhao Ziyang, Peng Zhen, Deng Yingchao, and nearly
 all other leading cadres of the Chinese party and
 government and had talks with them in a sincere,
 friendly, and comradely atmosphere and had impor-
 tant conversations and was accorded a cordial hospi-
 tality and warm welcome by the Chinese party and
 people during his tour of Beijing and local areas.
 The recently held seventh plenary meeting of the
 sixth Central Committee of the Korean Workers
 Party expressed great joy at the distinguished contri-
 butions made by the China visit of Comrade Kim
 Chong-il to the cause of further strengthening and
 developing the militant friendship and revolutionary
 solidarity between the parties and peoples. of Korea
 and China.
 O Chin-u, 11 July 1983, at a
 reception at the Chinese Embassy
 in Pyongyang
 this group, has clearly endorsed the succession
 through both word and deed. Senior Vice President
 Kim 11-the only veteran with anything approaching
 an independent stature-has deferred to the son in the
 highly symbolic leadership rankings.
 The principal challenge is likely to come from the
 group of second-generation leaders on the Political
 Bureau. These leaders are too young to have been part

 of Kim I1-song's guerrilla campaigns and yet old
 enough to have launched their careers in the postwar
 bureaucracy before Kim Chong-il began his appren-
 ticeship in 1973. Some of these leaders have only
 recently joined the Political Bureau. They may have
 had to pledge their loyalty to Kim Chong-il as part of
 the price of joining the party elite. But others may not
 be indebted to Kim Chong-il. Although loyal to Kim
 11-song, 'they may be inclined to push their own
 careers forward after the elder Kim leaves the scene.
 demotions in North Korea are probably the result of a
 mix of factors involving past political debts, bureau-
 cratic infighting, and complex trade-offs.
 Significant events in North Korea's domestic calendar
 over the next two years are likely to heighten maneu-
 vering within the leadership. Next year marks the end
 of North Korea's current seven-year economic plan.
 The transition from one plan period to another is often
 accompanied by changes in the government leader-
 ship. In 1985 the regime may hold elections for a new
 national assembly and convene a party congress. Any
 one of these events could serve as an occasion for Kim
 Chong-il's supporters to make a major move to fur-
 ther solidify the son's position as heir apparent. If
 such a move is undertaken, it will undoubtedly be
 played out in the ranks of the Political Bureau.
 Only Kim Chong-il has been noted mak-
 ing the kind of publicized inspection tours long associ-
 ated with his father's reign. And only Kim Chong-il
 has published major works, which are being held up
 as guidance in the manner of Kim I1-song's own
 writings.
 The size of the Political Bureau appears to have
 stabilized at roughly 34 members and alternates. The
 institutional representation also seems to be relatively
 fixed, with officials in the central party apparatus
 holding more positions on the Political Bureau than
 the government and military. Second-generation po-
 litical leaders are taking the dominant role in running
 affairs of the country.
 With the old guard revolutionaries retiring, political
 maneuvering at the Political Bureau level is likely to
 intensify in the next several years.
 Kim
 Chong-il and his supporters have to rec on wit i the
 possibility that the elder Kim's health could deterio-
 rate at any time.
 We anticipate that Kim Chong-il's supporters will
 continue to strive to place as many adherents as
 possible on the Political Bureau. It would be unwise,
 however, to view every new face as a loyal ally of the
 son. As in any political system, promotions and

 Appendix
 Organization and Function
 of the Political Bureau
 The Political Bureau is made up of the highest
 ranking members of the Central Committee. It con-
 ducts the party's business between the meetings of the
 much larger Central Committee, which holds two
 plenary sessions a year. The Political Bureau formu-
 lates all policy on political and social affairs, econom-
 ic, defense, and internal security matters. It meets in
 unpublicized sessions about once a week.
 The Political Bureau, in addition to its role as the
 principal policymaking organization, is also the chief
 organization for implementing policy. It exercises
 control through a full-time party Secretariat and a
 number of functionally organized departments under
 the Secretariat. The Political Bureau also wields
 power through other specialized organizations in the
 central party apparatus, such as the Military Com-
 mission (military affairs), the Control Committee
 (party discipline), and the Liaison Department (anti-
 South Korea operations). The officials heading these
 central party organizations are usually members of
 the Political Bureau.
 As in the case of other ruling Communist Party
 organizations, many officials on the Political Bureau
 also hold positions in the central government, in the
 armed forces, or in the provinces. This overlapping
 representation is one method used by the party to
 ensure that the bureaucracy remains responsive to
 party control. In particular, the number of cabinet
 officers and province chiefs on the Political Bureau
 has increased markedly in recent years.
 The Political Bureau consists of both full members
 and alternate members. Alternate members are non-
 voting members, but that is probably not an important
 distinction since voting generally is to rubberstamp
 Kim 11-song's decisions. Any official aspiring to full
 membership on the Political Bureau apparently is
 required first to serve at least some months as an
 alternate member.
 Over the years the formal structure of the Political
 Bureau has undergone some minor changes. From
 1966 to 1980 it was known by the title of Political
 Committee. From time to time an executive commit-
 tee is formed within the Political Bureau. The Sixth
 Party Congress, for example, designated the top five
 full members as the Presidium of the Political Bureau.
 Similar changes have been noted in both the USSR
 and China. The formation of the North Korean
 Presidium apparently serves to further centralize pow-
 er at the apex of the decisionmaking structure.
 North Korea as a rule only reveals the full lineup of
 the Political Bureau at major party gatherings, such
 as at its infrequent party congresses. The party con-
 gress is largely ceremonial, comprising both party
 leaders and party activists from across the country.
 Party regulations call for a congress to convene once
 every five years, but in fact 10 years lapsed between
 the Fifth Congress in 1970 and the Sixth Congress in
 October 1980.
 The makeup of the North Korean Political Bureau,
 like its Soviet and Chinese counterparts, undergoes
 numerous changes between party congresses. On oc-
 casion, these changes are formally announced at
 plenary meetings of the Central Committee. It is far
 more common, however, for the regime to disclose
 these changes in a piecemeal way at selected leader-
 ship turnouts.
 From time to time the party hierarchy in North Korea
 has been jolted by a major purge. During the mid-
 1950s there were several upheavals as Kim 11-song
 moved to consolidate his control over the various

 Approved For Release 2008/01/03: CIA-RDP84SO0928R000100120003-7
 factions within the leadership. There were two major
 shakeups in the leadership in the mid- and late 1960s.
 These purges coincided more or less with the begin-
 ning and ending of a period of heightened militancy in
 North Korea's campaign of harassment and provoca-
 tion against South Korea and the United States.
 There was a significant expansion of the Political
 Bureau-from 15 to 34 members and alternate mem-
 bers-between the Fifth Party Congress and the Sixth
 Congress in 1980. The new members were added
 incrementally over the decade; most were party and
 government bureaucrats. There were no leadership
 purges in the 1970s comparable to those in the 1950s
 and 1960s, thus providing for a considerable measure
 of leadership continuity.
 Relative stability in the leadership has continued into
 the 1980s. The status of 27 of the 34 members and
 alternate members identified in 1980 has remained
 unchanged. Continuity among the 19 full members is
 particularly strong. At a party plenum in August 1982
 two alternate members were promoted to full mem-
 bership to fill the vacancies created by the death of
 one member and the demotion of another to alternate
 status.
