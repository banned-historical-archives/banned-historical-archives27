 CS/Pres Briefing
 Twin Cities Industrial Conference(OCD)
 Sheraton-Ritz, Minneapolis
 I propose to concentrate this morning ., on our
 two major threats--the Soviet Union and Communist
 China--and then, as time permits, take up the
 Southeast Asian area generally, Vietnam, the Cuban
 threat to Latin America, and a quick look at some
 of the other trouble spots.
 One word on security:   You may get the feeling
 that some.of the information and conclusions I am
 going to cover correspond, to what you have already
 gotten from the press, radio,.and television.

 THE SOVIET UNION
 LEADERSHIP
 1.        THE MEN WHO THREW KHRUSHCHEV OUT OF THE KREMLIN
 TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO HAVE NOW HAD TIME TO
 ESTABLISH THEIR POLICIES, THEIR RELATIONSHIPS, AND THEIR
 WAY OF DOING BUSINESS,
 A.   WHAT HAS EMERGED IS ESSENTIALLY A COLLECTIVE
 LEADERSHIP.
 1.   I THINK IT WAS GEORGE ORWELL, HOWEVER,
 WHO ADVANCED THE THESIS THAT UNDER COMMU-
 NISM SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS,
 AND THIS SEEMS TO APPLY TO THE SECRETARY-
 GENERAL OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY, LEONID
 BREZHNEV.
 2.- BREZHNEV'S STANDING HAS BEEN GROWING
 STEADILY.  HE APPEARS AT LEAST TO BE FIRST
 AMONG EQUALS.
 BUT THE MAJOR DECISIONS, BY AND LARGE, ARE
 APPARENTLY REACHED BY COMPROMISE, AND
 IMPLEMENTED WITH CAUTION.
 THIS TYPE OF COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP ELIMINATES
 THE ERRATIC INITIATIVES KHRUSHCHEV WAS NOTED FOR,
 AND IT REDUCES THE CHANCES OF MAKING BIG MISTAKES.
 IT HAS TWO INHERENT WEAKNESSES, HOWEVER.

 BUT THIS SECOND SYSTEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
 ALL THE ELEMENTS ESSENTIAL TO A BALLISTIC

 A,   THE SOVIETS CONTINUE TO INCREASE THEIR MILITARY
 BUDGET AND THEIR EFFORT TO ACHIEVE A MAJOR
 BREAKTHROUGH,
 OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE RESULTING IMPROVEMENTS
 ARE GOING TO GIVE THE SOVIET LEADERS INCREASING
 CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE
 DETERRENT, IN THE FORM OF A MILITARY MACHINE WHICH
 CAN UNDERGO NUCLEAR ATTACK, AND STILL DELIVER. ENOUGH
 PUNCH TO DESTROY A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE
 POPULATION AND RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES.
 WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIETS THEMSELVES
 EXPECT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH--EVEN OVER THE NEXT
 TEN YEARS--TO CONSIDER THE DELIBERATE INITIATION
 OF A WAR AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
 BUT GROWING CONFIDENCE IN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE
 CAPABILITIES IS ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH COULD LEAD
 TO DISASTROUS MISCALCULATIONS WHEN TWO COUNTRIES ARE

 Soviet Civil Defense
 V.   In Soviet propaganda, it some of the military leaders
 have been boasting that they have such an effective
 defense against ballistic missiles that the Soviet
 Union does not need to worry about the imperialist
 robkets.
 (DIAGRAM, Soviet Civil Defense Concept)
 A.   This does not go over qi very well with those
 responsible for civil defense in the Soviet Union,
 who still think little enough of the anti-ballistic
 missile so that their strategy centers on
 evacuation,  as this diagram indicates.

 approaches to population protection.      It is
 a makeshift program which
 still relies on basement-type blast shelters
 of World War II vintage, with little protection
 against fall-out.

 3.   There is no organize program to mark, improve,
 and stock adaptable public shelter areas.
 4.   Existing,shlter areas are probably sufficient
 for 10 to 15 percent of the urban population.
 B.    The Soviet civil defense program, in other words,
 relies on sufficient warning to evacuate urban areas,

 and is centered at present on providing protection
 for the command and control mechanism,t     planning
 for reception of the evacuees a pin the countryside, and
 rescue and recovery after the thermonuclear exchange
 begins.
 (TABLE OF ORGANIZATION, SOVIET CIVIL DEFENSE)
 B.     Until about 1960, Soviet Civil Defense was under

 s      7?om00
 Organization shows,'' the
 Ministry
 Defense and specificallyithe
 Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces, Marshal
 Chuikov.
 1.    The Table of Organization parallels military
 command channels down to the local level,  and
 specially trained military officers are ?
 assigned to civil defense as far down as city
 headquarters.
 2.    Much of the work, however,  is carried on as it was
 during World War II by DOSAAF, a paramilitary
 organization which is a sort of a cross between
 the American Legion, the Navy League, and the
 R.O.T.C.
 3.    At the city level, civil defense becomes the
 responsibility of the civilian leaders who
 correspond.to governors, mayors, plant managers,
 and the like in the United States.
 4.    The responsibility for establishing and preparing

 shelters also seems to devolve to the local
 #level, where a combination of apathy and
 shortage of funds has resulted in a program
 which by and large will apparently not begin
 providing the necessary shelters until
 an emergency is declared.
 5.   Cit Jzens are subject to compulsory training,
 however,  and are obligated to serve if selected
 for civil defense duty. There are about 100
 civil defense schools scattered across the Soviet
 Union, and as much as half of the population has probably been

 Civi
 C.   In short, the main emphasis in Soviet Defense   today
 appears to be on preparations to maintain the
 processes of government and cope with masses of
 evacuees when the cities are destroyed.

 SOVIET RELATIONS WITH UNITED STATES
 I WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON JUST TWO FACETS OF SOVIET
 VIi
 FOREIGN POL L-RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES, AND
 THE SING-SOVIET DISPUTE,
 IN PUBLIC, SOVIET SPOKESMEN ARE TAKING THE LINE THAT
 ANY IMPROVEMENT IN U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS IS GOING TO
 BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AS LONG AS WE ARE ATTACKING
 THEIR COMMUNIST BRETHREN IN NORTH VIETNAM.
 A.   THIS IS NOT ONLY A USEFUL BARGAINING POSITION
 WHICH TENDS TO MAKE  1J  COMES TO   Ft, BUT THEY
 ARE PRACTICALLY FORCED TO TAKE THIS STAND BECAUSE
 THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS ARE ACCUSING THE KREMLIN
 OF WORKING WITH THE UNITED STATES E\GAINST NORTH
 VIETNAM,
 IN FACT, HOWEVER, SOVIET LEADERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR
 THAT THEY WANT TO AVOID ANY SHOWDOWN WITH WASHINGTON
 OVER THE VIETNAMESE ISSUE,
 THEY ARE, OF COURSE, DELIGHTED TO SEE MAJOR, I PORTIONS
 OF OUR FORCES TIED DOWN IN VIETNAM, BUT THEY ALSO
 REALIZE THAT THEY MUST KEEP THEIR LINES TO WASHINGTON
 OPEN AND WORKING, IF THEY WANT ANY PROGRESS ON THE
 ISSUES THAT REALLY CONCERN THEM--SUCH AS EUROPEAN

 THAT THE PORT OF HAIPHONG IN NORTH VIETNAM,
 WHATEVER THE HEADLINES MAY SAY, IS NOT A MAJOR
 FA TOR IN THE SUPPLY OF WEAPONS TO NORTH VIETNAM,
 1, ~E 'KNOW WHAT GOES INTO HAIPHONG, SHIPS HAVE

 THEY MAY HAVE BROUGHT IN AN OCCASIONAL BATCH OF

 2, BUT THE WEAPONS, AND THE BULK OF THE WAR MATERIEL
 .. .... ......
 GENERALLY, COME IN OVERLAND. ACROSS 1HINA
 TO A GREAT DEGREE, THIS IS BECAUSE OF SOVIET
 RELUCTANCE TO RISK A CONFRONTATION WITH THE
 UNITED STATES ON THE HIGH SEAS,
 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE CONFRONTATION THE
 CHINESE COMMUNISTS WANT TO BRING ABOUT,
 E, MOSCOW HAS CHARGED THAT THE CHINESE ARE DIVERTING,
 DELAYING, SABOTAGING, STEALING, AND EVEN RE-LABELING
 SOVIET WAR MATERIEL PASSING THROUGH CHINA TO VIETNAM,
 THE CHINESE, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAVE ACCUSED MOSCOW OF
 "COWARDICE" FOR REFUSING TO SHIP BY SEA,  PEKING
 PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT IN A PINCH1 THE SOVIETS WOULD
 STILL REFUSE, AND PEKING COULD THEN TELL THE WORLD
 COMMUNIST PARTIES THAT RUSSIA HAD ABANDONED THE
 NORTH VIETNAMESE, RATHER THAN FACE UP TO AMERICAN
 SEA POWER.

 A YEAR NOW BY THE UPHEAVAL THEY CALL THE "CULTURAL.
 REVOLUTION."
 A.   YQU HAVE ALL SEEN PICTURES OF SWARMS OF CHINESE
 TEEN-AGERS ON THE MARCH, HOLDING LITTLE RED BOOKS
 FROM WHICH THEY CHANT QUOTATIONS OF MAO TSE-TUNG.
 IN CHINA TODAY, MAO'S QUOTATIONS ARE CREDITED WITH
 ALMOST MIRACULOUS POWER, ALTHOUGH FOR THE MOST PART
 THEY ARE A COLLECTION OF TIRED OLD CLICH (S LIKE
 "ALL POWER COMES OUT OF THE BARREL OF A GUN," OR
 "BE RESOLUTE, FEAR NO SACRIFICE, AND SURMOUNT EVERY
 DIFFICULTY TO WIN VICTORY."
 1.  PEKING RADIO SAYS FIGHTER PILOTS SHOUTED MAO'S

 DOG-FIGHT, AND WERE THEREFORE ABLE TO SHOOT DOWN
 A CHINESE NATIONALIST AIRCRAFT.
 A'FORESTRY CONFERENCE IN PEKING CONCLUDED THAT
 THE STUDY OF MAO WOULD ENABLE THE FORESTRY SERVICE
 TO GROW BETTER TREES.
 3.  A WORKER IN LANCHOU, WHO BROKE AN ARM, A LEG AND
 SEVERAL RIBS IN A FALL ON THE JOB, WAS REPORTED TO
 HAVE REFUSED SICK LEAVE, BECAUSE MAO'S THOUGHTS
 ENABLED HIM TO LIVE WITH THE PAIN.

 OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FIVE NUCLEAR TESTS TO DATE
 INDICATES THAT THE CHINESE CAN ALREADY PACKAGE A

 WE BELIEVE THAT THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A
 MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILE WITH A REACH OF ABOUT 1,000
 NAUTICAL MILES, AND THAT THEY CAN PROBABLY BEGIN
 DEPLOYING OPERATIONAL MISSILES OF THIS TYPE, WITH
 NUCLEAR WARHEADS, THIS YEAR.

 CAN COVER ALL OF JAPAN AND THE PHILIPPINES, A GOOD

 CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY
 When we look for the bases of Chinese foreign policy,
 we must bear in mind that they are an ancient people
 iwho used to call their
 empire the "Middle Kingdom,
 because to them it was the center of the world.
 (MAP,  "PEKING'S LOST EMPIRE")
 A.    This map,  for instance, published ina
 history textbook;''
 r, s own areas once under Chinese
 domination which they complain were seized
 from the crumbling Chinese empire by unfair treaties
 with Russia.
 1.    You can see that their claims also extend
 to all of Southeast Asia, and even parts of
 India and Pakistan.
 (MAP, PEKING GEOCENTRIC)
 B.   This map appears to be upside down; actually, it
 is a geocentric map,  centered on Peking, showing
 s
 faj~ E as
 the         as it appears strategically to the
 Chinese.
 1.    From this viewpoint, Southeast Asia is a
 natural ante-room for China, and not just
 Taiwan, but the Japanese, Philippine and
 Indonesian archipelagoes are China's offshore
 islands.
 2.    Bear in mind that most of the countries
 south of China have at one time or another
 been vassals or tributarieof the Middle

 Asia is normally a rice surplus area.
 China, on the other hand, is  less than
 15 percent arable,  and over the past decade
 the pppulatipn has grown by more than 20 percent
 while ddft food production has either stood
 still or--in bad years--decreased.
 Moscow,
 t
 ,  then,  is
 . Part of the Chinese grudge agains
 not an ideological dispute with the Soviet Union,
 but an inherent desire to reclaim Chinese territory
 seized by Imperial Russia.
 A.    The Russians,  like us, are by and large a
 people of Caucasian stock, and therefore the
 Chinese on racial grounds can hate Russians
 and Americans with equal fervor,  because we
 are foreign devils,  and white foreign devils
 to boot.
 B.    But their hostility toward the United States
 is more implacable and more enduring for two
 reasons:
 C.    Firstly, we are the world's champions of free
 enterprise,  and the Chinese as basic Marxists
 believe that war between Communism and Capitalism
 is inevitable.
 D.    Secondly, World War II not only carried American
 influence to the far shores of the Pacific, but
 left us the only Free World1Nation with the
 power and the motivation to contain the Chinese

 E.   The Chinese, then, hate us because we are
 foreigners, because we are capitalists, and
 because we are there.
 VI  .   Khrushchev is reported to have commented at one time
 that Mao's strategy would welcome 40 global
 thermonuclear war, because China was the only
 country ,,
 --"hat could lose 300 million people and still
 survive as a nation.
 .A.   This is bound to play' some part in Chinese
 Communist thinking, but for the present, despite
 all the belligerent Peking propaganda about support
 for North Vietnam, we think that there are
 probablyt' only three circumstances in which
 the Chinese would feel obliged to intervene there
 with military force:

 Rip RECENTLY, THE ZOO-- MILLION PEOPLE OF INDONESIA,
 WITH EXTENSIVE POTENTIAL RESOURCES AND IMPORTANT
 STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHY, WERE SLIDING SLOWLY BUT
 SURELY INTO THE GRASP OF PEKING,
 c
 THE CHINESE DIDN'T HAVE'TO BUILD A SINGLE
 LANDING CRAFT, OR MAKE A BELLIGERENT GESTURE,
 THEY SIMPLY BUILT UP THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF
 INDONESIA, SUPPORTED AND GUIDED IT, AND CONVINCED
 PRESIDENT SUKARNO THAT CHINESE COMMUNISM WAS
 THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE.
 THE PRO-WESTERN INDONESIAN ARMY HAD ALMOST
 BEEN NEUTRALIZED; THE ANTI-COMMUNIST POLITICAL
 PARTIES HAD BEEN BANNED OR PLACED UNDER TIGHT
 CONTROLS  AND THE AIR FORCE AND NAVY WERE UNDER
 PRO-COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP, WHEN A BADLY TIMED
 AND BUNGLED COUP ATTEMPT GAVE THE ARMY LEADERS
 A CHANCE TO TURN THE TABLES.
 TODAY, THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDONESIA HAS BEEN
 SHATTERED, AND GENERAL SUHARTO HAS ALMOST COMPLETED
 THE DELICATE AND'DIFFICULT JOB OF TAKING AWAY
 ALL-POWER FROM SUKARNO.  THIS HAS BEEN TIME-CONSUMIN
 BECAUSE TO MANY INDONESIANS SUKARNO IS STILL A
 COMBINATION'OF GEORGE WASHINGTON AND MOHAMMED,
 ---WITH A CONSIDERABLE DASH OF DON JUAN.

 BUT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN SOMETHING LIKE
 SAVING A HUNTER FROM THE WOLVES, ONLY TO
 FIND THAT HE IS DYING.OF STARVATION.   IF IT
 WERE POSSIBLE TO BANKRUPT A NATION, INDONESIA
 /AND ,& HAL F
 IS BANKRUPT, IT OWES MORE THAN TW04BILLION
 DOLLARS,  JUST TO PUT THE ECONOMY ON A SURVIVAL
 BASIS IS GOING TO TAKE YEARS OF CAREFUL PLANNING,
 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION ON RE-SCHEDULING DEBTS,
 AND-HEAVY INFUSIONS OF FINANCIAL HELP.

 INDONESIA STOOD FOUR OR FIVE;YEARS AGO,
 A   THE VOLATILE RULER, PRINCE SIHANOUK, HAS DECIDED
 THAT OVER THE LONG RUN THE COMMUNISTS, AND COMMUNIST
 CHINA IN PARTICULAR, ARE GOING TO BE THE WINNERS
 IN THE FAR EAST,
 HE IS ACCORDINGLY TRYING TO TAKE OUT INSURANCE,
 BOTH FOR HIS OWN FUTURE AND FOR THAT OF HIS
 COUNTRY, BY ESTABLISHING CLOSE RELATIONS WITH
 PEKING, AND WITH THE NORTH VIETNAMESE AND THE
 VIET LONG,
 RECENTLY HE MAY HAVE HAD SOME SECOND THOUGHTS,
 PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE COURSE OF THE WAR IN VIETNAM,
 PARTLY.BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS HAVE REFUSED TO GIVE
