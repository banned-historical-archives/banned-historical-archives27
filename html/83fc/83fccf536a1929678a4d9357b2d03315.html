 CHINA'S GROWING ISOLATION I N THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT
 Two years ago Peking appeared to be success-
 fully on its way toward building within the world
 Communist movement a bloc of supporters that could
 directly challenge Moscow. Now, although the Chi-
 nese retain a few backers, the preponderance of
 influence is so clearly in Moscow's favor that a
 significant threat to Soviet leadership no longer
 exists.   Peking can count with assurance on support
 only from Albania, the Communist Party of New Zea-
 land, and a handful of tiny splinter groups.
 In the past 18 months the Chinese have suf-
 fered their most serious setbacks in the Far East.
 The ruling parties of North Korea and North Vietnam
 have edged away from Peking, and the Communist
 Party in Japan can no longer be counted on for sup-
 port.   The Communist Party in Indonesia--which had
 been supporting Peking--was shattered in the wake
 of the abortive coup last fall.
 China's relations with Cuba, Peking's only
 diplomatic toehold in the Western Hemisphere, have
 also sunk to an all-time low, and Peking is no
 longer able to work through pro-Castro activists in
 Latin America.   Even in countries such as Rumania
 where Peking has been encouraging independence of
 Moscow, the Chinese have recently encountered seri-
 ous difficulties.
 China's setbacks have been due largely to Pe-
 king's own rigid dogmatism and political ineptitude,
 but they also result in part from the shift in So-
 viet tactics since the fall of Khrushchev. Moscow's
 new leaders have gained ground by muting public
 polemics and backing away from efforts to persuade
 foreign Communist parties that Peking should be
 formally read out of the Communist movement.  More-
 over, cautious Soviet military support for Hanoi
 under Khrushchev's successors has helped to under-
 cut Chinese charges that Moscow is unwilling to
 support armed revolutionary struggle and has gone
 soft on the question of US "imperialism."

 The Arrogance of Certitude
 The concept of a Sino-cen-
 tric world, at least insofar as
 truth and right thinking are
 concerned, is as strong in Pe-
 king today as it was under the
 emperors centuries ago.  Advanc-
 ing age, the pressures generated
 by their struggle with the So-
 viets, and frustration at the
 reverses sustained by China at
 home and abroad over the past few
 years, have all combined to fix
 Mao and the other "true believers"
 around him in an arrogance of
 certitude that is pushing Peking
 into a position of virtual isola-
 tion in the world Communist move-
 ment.
 editorial published on 11 Novem-
 ber 1965 in both the People's
 Daily and Red Flag.  The edi-
 torial exhorted all true Marxist-
 Leninists to draw a "clear line
 of demarcation both politically
 and organizationally" between
 themselves and the "revision-
 ists."
 Party Secretary Teng Hsiao-
 ping sharpened the issue even
 more at a rally in Shanghai on
 6  May 1966 when he declared
 that there can be no "centrist"
 line, no "vacillation" between
 Marxist-Leninists and revision-
 ists.   These remarks appear to
 have been intended at the time,
 in part at least, as a lecture
 to the North Vietnamese.
 The Chinese present them-
 selves as the fount of all valid
 revolutionary experience and as
 the torchbearers of true Marxism-
 Leninism, fighting against the
 poisonous heresy of Soviet "re-
 visionism."  Mao's thought is
 hailed as "the highest and most
 creative manifestation of Marx-
 ism-Leninism" and as the guide
 for revolutionaries all over the
 world.   Mao is the "mentor of
 the international proletarian
 revolution."  Peking now even
 claims that Maoism is "universal
 truth, effectively applicable
 everywhere and proven in actual
 practice in the Chinese revolu-
 tion."
 Underlying this grandiose
 self-image is the Leninist propo-
 sition that "all who are not for
 us are against us," a proposi-
 tion that was explicitly applied
 by Peking to its relations with
 the rest of the Communist move-
 ment for the first time in an
 Relations With North Vietnam
 Chinese influence in Hanoi
 has eroded somewhat since the
 Soviets began to supply North
 Vietnam with modern weapons that
 the Chinese were unable to pro-
 vide.   Peking continues to com-
 mand a strong position, however,
 and will probably continue to do
 so.   China's geographic location
 alone impels the North Vietnam-
 ese to maintain close ties with
 the Chinese as long as the war
 continues.   Anxious to receive
 as much military aid as possi-
 ble from every available source,
 Hanoi has tried to pursue a mid-
 dle-of-the-road course, dodging
 the more inflammatory issues in
 the Sino-Soviet dispute so as
 to avoid antagonizing either ma-
 jor supporter.
 The Chinese began to lose
 ground in Hanoi after Brezhnev
 and Kosygin came to power in

 1964.   Under Khrushchev, the So-
 viets had sharply disagreed with
 the optimistic view of the Viet-
 namese situation held in Hanoi
 and Peking.   The Soviets had
 warned that the course being fol-
 lowed might lead to a direct mil-
 itary confrontation with the US
 and a large-scale Asian war.   By
 late 1964, however, Communist
 prospects in Vietnam appeared
 fairly promising and the new So-
 viet leaders felt that Moscow
 could improve its position within
 the world Communist movement by
 providing increased propaganda
 and material support to Hanoi's
 war effort.
 Khrushchev's tactics had
 had the effect of forcing the
 North Vietnamese into Peking's
 arms, and the new Soviet leaders
 felt that with relatively little
 danger of a head-on confrontation
 with the US, they could renew
 Moscow's support and nudge Hanoi
 back into a more neutral posi-
 tion in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 The North Vietnamese, who prob-
 ably were never too happy about
 being forced to rely solely on
 Peking, appear to have been more
 than willing to have the oppor-
 tunity of getting more freedom
 of maneuver and a better bargain-
 ing position.
 Hanoi responded to the So-
 viet switch by discontinuing the
 virulent anti-Soviet propaganda
 that it had been putting out for
 months in imitation of Peking.
 The November 1964 issue of the
 party. theoretical journal Hoc Tap
 was withdrawn from the newsstands
 until a bitter article attacking
 "revisionism" could be replaced
 by an innocuous substitute.   By
 March 1965, US air strikes against
 North Vietnam had begun in ear-
 nest and the large-scale buildup
 of US combat forces  was well
 under way in the South.   The North
 Vietnamese leaders, though fully
 aware of the strains this would
 put on their relations with Pe-
 king, turned to Moscow for in-
 creased support.   Party secretary
 General Le Duan, Defense Minister
 Giap, and Foreign Minister Trinh
 went to Moscow, and the communi-
 que issued at the end of their
 week-long consultations was
 hailed by Hanoi as expressing an
 identity of views.
 Although the Chinese were
 greatly concerned at this growth
 of Soviet influence, there was
 little they could do.   Unable to
 match the sophisticated Soviet
 military aid, they had to content
 themselves with disparaging So-
 viet assistance, claiming that
 Moscow was only seeking to gain
 influence with the ultimate in-
 tent of selling out Vietnamese
 interests to the US.
 The Other Asian Communists
 Elsewhere in Asia, Commu-
 nist China has also been losing
 ground in its struggle with Mos-
 cow.                                                                 North Korea has grown in-
 creasingly critical of Peking's
 policies, particularly those
 dealing with Vietnam.   Pyongyang
 reportedly sent a letter in May
 1966 to the Chosen Soren, an or-
 ganization of Korean residents in
 Japan, accusing Peking of sabo-
 taging bloc unity.   The letter
 castigated the Chinese for openly
 disparaging Soviet aid to Viet-
 nam and stated that the worth of
 such aid should be evaluated by

 Hanoi, not by Peking.   It also
 denounced Peking for calling Cuba
 a revisionist nation and charged
 China with attempting to "seize
 hegemony" in Latin America, which
 the Korean Communists insisted
 is Havana's rightful sphere of
 influence.
 This May 1966 letter is the
 best indication thus far of the
 distance Pyongyang has moved to-
 ward the Soviet position since
 Khrushchev's ouster and Kosygin's
 February 1965 visit to North
 Korea.   Soviet aid has also fur-
 ther cemented Pyongyang's rap-
 prochement with Moscow.   Jet
 fighters and defensive missile
 equipment that have appeared in
 North Korea are believed to have
 been provided under the terms
 of a military assistance agree-
 ment signed with the Soviets in
 May 1965.   Two coastal-defense
 cruise-missile complexes, two
 new surface-to-air missile sites,
 and additional MIG-19 Farmer jet
 fighters have been identified in
 North Korea in recent months.
 For all their private crit-
 icism of Peking, the North Ko-
 reans have thus far avoided di-
 rect public attacks on the Chi-
 nese.                 The growing coolness in
 the Peking-Pyongyang relationship,
 however, was pointed up early
 this summer at the ceremonies
 marking the fifth anniversary of
 the Chinese-Korean treaty of
 friendship and mutual assistance.
 In their formal message to the
 Chinese and in speeches at dip-
 lomatic receptions, the Koreans
 'employed the stock phrase "the
 Chinese people under the leader-
 ship of the Chinese Communist
 Party headed by Mao Tse-tung."
 Peking, however, in its mes-
 sages and speeches did not recip-
 rocate with references to the
 Korean Workers Party  (KWP)
 "headed by Kim I1-sung," as the
 Chinese had done on all previous
 anniversaries.   Chinese state-
 ments on the 16th anniversary of
 the outbreak of the Korean war
 also conspicuously avoided ref-
 erences to the KWP and Kim,  and
 the two countries have not ex-
 changed high-level party delega-
 tions in more than two years.
 The Japanese party, once a
 reliable supporter of Peking,
 has also moved toward independ-
 ence.   This has been particu-
 larly evident since the Soviet
 party congress last March.   Un-
 der heavy Chinese pressure, party
 Secretary General Miyamoto grudg-
 ingly agreed to join in China's
 boycott of the meeting.   He re-
 turned to Japan, however, appar-
 ently determined to steer a
 course increasingly independent
 of Peking and closer to the So-
 viet party.   Japanese Communists
 criticize certain Chinese poli-
 cies, especially in relation to
 Vietnam.   The party paper Akahata
 now carries a considerable amount
 of Soviet reporting and has cut
 back on New China News Agency re-
 leases.                                                                          Even advertisements
 for Mao's works no longer appear
 in the Japanese party daily.

 The position of the Japan-
 ese party is now close to that
 of the North Korean as both at-
 tempt to follow a middle path
 between Peking and Moscow. When
 Miyamoto visited Pyongyang last
 March it was clear the two par-
 ties were taking a coordinated
 stand with respect to the prob-
 lems within the international
 Communist movement.   The joint
 communique issued at the conclu-
 sion of Miyamoto's visit to Pyong
 yang stressed the importance of
 Communist unity and cautioned
 against dogmatism and faction-
 alism--both points certain to
 gall the Chinese.   The communi-
 que also contained a warning
 against efforts to force "a uni-
 lateral will" on a fraternal
 party.
 Further evidence of the
 Japanese Communists' drift away
 from Peking appeared in the 11
 May issue of Akahata, which con-
 tained an article charging that
 "flunkyism and dogmatism" among
 some Japanese Communists had led
 to "unconditionally revering the
 leadership of foreign parties."
 The article also warned that
 overemphasis  on the "antirevi-
 sionist struggle" reduced the
 effectiveness of the "struggle
 against. US imperialism."
 The disaster that befell
 the Indonesian Communist Party
 last fall has apparently been
 an important factor in the de-
 cision by the Korean and Japan-
 ese parties to shear away from
 the Chinese.   Both feel that
 overdependence on Peking and
 blind acceptance of Chinese guid-
 ance compounded the difficulties
 of the Indonesian party and ac-
 tually led to the party's losses
 in the aftermath of the coup.
 Of all China's recent re-
 verses abroad, the one in Indo-
 nesia has been the most serious.
 The Communist Party of Indonesia,
 which formerly exercised great
 influence in Djakarta and was
 closely aligned with Peking, has
 been outlawed.   Party chairman
 Aidit and his top lieutenants
 have been killed and the party
 organization has been shattered.
 Less than a year ago the Indo-
 nesian party was the strongest
 nonbloc party consistently back-
 ing Peking.   It now seems likely
 that the party's effectiveness
 as a political force--and its
 usefulness to the Chinese--will
 be virtually nil for years to
 come.
 Peking and Latin America
 China's relations with Cuba
 have been steadily deteriorating.
 Serious slippage first became
 evident in November 1964 when
 the Cubans hosted a meeting of
 Latin American Communists.  That
 meeting was largely arranged by
 Moscow and represented a major
 Soviet bid to isolate the more
 radical pro-Chinese splinter
 factions in the Western Hemi-
 sphere.

 Differences came to a head
 in early January 1966.   Peking
 drastically cut shipments of rice
 to Cuba in retaliation for the in-
 creasingly explicit support Havana
 had been giving Moscow on various
 issues in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
 Castro replied at once with a
 speech accusing Peking of "join-
 ing in the US blockade of Cuba"
 and of attempting to "subvert the
 Cuban armed forces."  There was
 some substance for the latter
 charge, since Chinese diplomats
 had longbeen distributing Mao's
 writings to military and student
 groups in Cuba.   The-se propaganda
 efforts had been a major source
 of antagonism.   Early this year,
 Castro reportedly referred to
 the Chinese ambassador as a
 "prostitute, peddling his wares."
 China's setback in Cuba may
 have far-reaching implication;;
 for its efforts elsewhere in this
 hemisphere.  Militant Communist
 splinter groups in Latin America
 have long looked to both Havana
 and Peking for both financial
 and moral support.   Now they are
 being forced to choose, and there
 are already signs of divided al-
 legiance among the leaders of
 certain activist groups.
 In Ecuador, for example,
 Rafael Echeverria Flores--a long-
 time proponent of armed revolu-
 tionary struggle and leading ad-
 vocate of Peking's line--visited
 Havana early last year and re-
 turned loudly singing Castro's
 praises.   Several of his more
 rigid pro-Peking lieutenants now
 reportedly believe that he has
 secretly sold out to the "revi-
 sionists."
 Many of the cadre in the
 most active revolutionary groups
 in     Latin  America have been
 trained in Cuba.   They are Fidel-
 istas at heart, and their basic
 sympathies lie with Havana.
 While a few extremists may ac-
 cept the Chinese charge that
 Cuba is now revisionist, the
 majority will continue to look
 to Havana.
 Relations With Eastern Europe
 Peking's insistence that
 willingness to cooperate in
 attacks on Moscow is the price
 of Chinese friendship has re-
 cently exposed Peking's rela-
 tionship with Bucharest asthe
 marriage of convenience it was
 from the outset.
 During his visit to Rumania
 last June Chou En-lai clashed
 openly with Rumanian party boss
 Ceausescu, who was unwilling to
 let the Chinese use Bucharest
 as a podium for polemics against
 the USSR.   Disagreement was so
 sharp that no communique was
 issued at the conclusion of
 Chou's visit and the flimsi-
 ness of Sino--Rumanian protesta-
 tions of close ties was exposed
 to public view.
 The Chinese have long
 sought to exploit the growing

 pressure on the Soviets for greater I
 independence.   Peking has scored
 some success in this endeavor,
 but has failed to translate the
 desire for greater autonomy into
 positive support for Chinese vws.
 Chou's visit to Rumania was p ie
 ably designed in large part to
 demonstrate that Albania is not
 the only close friend China has
 in Eastern Europe.   In this it
 was a total failure.
 Albania is now Peking's only
 staunch supporter within the Com-
 munist camp.   The frequent high-
 level visits between the two pro-
 vide occasions for virulent de-
 nunciations of the Soviet Union
 by. both. Chou En-lai has visited
 Tirana twice in the past 18 months,
 and Albanian Premier Shehu made
 a lengthy tour of China this past
 spring. Members of Shehu's dele-
 gation outdid their hosts in the
 bitterness of their attacks on the
 new Soviet leaders and in under-
 lining the irreconcilibility of
 the Chinese and Soviet positions.
 During his visit to China,
 Shehu stated flatly that Mao was
 the leader of "the Chinese people
 and the international movement..",
 and he insisted that "the center
 of the international movement has
 shifted from the Soviet Union to
 China." Throughout their stay the
 Albanians hailed the creation of
 a Mao-led world movement of Marx-
 ist-Leninist parties, and stressed
 the allegedly rapid growth of pro-
 Peking splinter groups around the
 world.
 Splinter Parties
 In actual fact, however,
 the pro-Chinese parties and fac-
 tions in non-Communist countries
 remain small and are increasingly
 ridden with dissensions.   Although
 Teng Hsiao-ping recently claimed
 that the Marxist-Leninist ranks
 "have greatly expanded," neither
 he nor any other Chinese leader
 made as optimistic an appraisal
 of the Marxist-Leninist camp as
 did the Albanian visitors. Pe-
 king appears to be well aware of
 the difficulties it faces in
 dealing with pro-Chinese groups
 abroad, and the Chinese probably
 recognize that in many instances
 the allegiance of these groups
 to Mao is nominal.
 Many of the pro-Peking fac-
 tions broke away from the ortho-
 dox, pro-Soviet parties as a re-
 sult of clashes between leaders
 struggling for power.   There are
 splits'in the rank and file of
 almost every nonbloc Communist
 party--splits between the cau-
 tious and the impetuous, between
 the old guard and their younger
 critics hungry for position and
 perquisites.   These divisions
 have been widened by the Sino-
 Soviet competition for support.
 However, the activist rebels
 often quote Mao as scripture only
 to support their own cases in
 party squabbles.   Basically, they
 are dissenters, given to petty
 jealousies and unable to agree
 even among themselves.   The same
 reasons that caused them to break
 with the orthodox leadership now
 cause them to wrangle and vie with
 each other for Peking's favor.
 Moreover, although the Chinese
 repeatedly point to the splinter
 groups as evidence of world-wide
 Marxist-Leninist support, the actual

 influence of these factions is
 insignificant in most countries.
 Grippa's group in Belgium, nu-
 merically the strongest of China's
 supporters in Western Europe,
 has less than 400 members.   Fur-
 thermore, there is evidence of
 growing fragmentation among
 these often minuscule factions.
 In Colombia, for example,
 there are sharp differences among
 the pro-Chinese elements.   The
 Communist Party of Colombia
 (Marxist-Leninist) is plagued
 by petty jealousies, and the
 Worker Student Peasant Movement
 (MOEC)  is divided into two dis-
 tinct groups with little pros-
 pect they will settle their dif-
 ferences.   For the time being
 Peking is hedging its bets and
 giving all three--the party and
 the two MOEC factions--modest
 financial support.
 with a handful of pro-Chinese
 organizations that are patently
 puppets.   Among these are the
 Afro-Asian Journalist Associa-
 tion, driven from Djakarta to
 Peking following last fall's
 abortive coup in Indonesia, and
 the Afro-Asian Jurists Associa-
 tion,  a shaky operation with a
 one-man office in Conakry.
 In 1963 the Chinese tried
 without success to set up rivals
 to such large and well-established
 organizations as the World Feder-
 ation of Trade Unions  (WFTU)  and
 the World Peace Council.   A cru-
 cial turning point was their
 failure to persuade the powerful
 Japanese trade union, Sohyo, to
 bolt the WFTU.   Since that time
 the Chinese have seldom attempted
 to make serious inroads among
 the Soviet-dominated groups.
 Pro-Chinese elements among
 the Spanish Communists are also
 feuding.   Three small groups,
 made up largely of exiles, put
 out three separate publications
 and have resisted all efforts to
 bring about a reconciliation.
 Front Groups
 Among front groups, as well,
 Peking has been losing ground
 to Moscow.   In 1962 the Chinese
 began to set up rival, anti-So-
 viet fronts but these efforts
 appear to have bogged down, and
 Peking must now content itself
 Within the Afro-Asian world,
 however, the Chinese still try
 to set up regionally oriented
 fronts completely responsive to
 them.   One such effort was the
 organization of a meeting in
 Peking in July 1966 of the Afro-
 Asian Writers'  Bureau.  This pro-
 vided Chinese propagandists with
 more than a week of hardhitting
 polemical copy, but the Soviets
 and the Egyptian Communists moved
 promptly to condemn the Chinese
 meeting as a rump session and
 convened a meeting in Cairo of
 the same bureau..   Thus, the or-
 ganization is now clearly split
 into two contending camps.

 It appears probable that the
 Chinese will continue their ef-
 forts to steal away portions of
 such Afro-Asian bodies and set
 up their own rump groups.   Such
 maneuvers, however, may in the
 long run weaken Chinese influence
 among the Afro-Asians.  Nationalist
 leaders in the underdeveloped
 world are increasingly anxious to
 avoid involvement in the Sino-
 Soviet dispute and are loath to
 have their regional organizations
 drawn into the polemical battle.
 Where they cannot persuade
 a sizable group to bolt, as in
 the case of the Writers' Bureau,
 the Chinese continue to attend
 the meetings of Soviet-dominated
 fronts and subject delegates to
 tiresome polemical speeches.   Pe-
 king is sometimes able thus to
 exploit minor frictions between
 Moscow and its supporters.   At
 times, however, the repetitious
 and abusive Chinese attacks on
 the Soviets have served only to
 antagonize the other participants.
 On a number of occasions, most
 of those in the audience have
 walked out during strident anti-
 Soviet harangues by Chinese rep-
 resentatives, thus underscoring
 China's growing isolation.
 When controversial issues
 are voted on at such meetings,
 some of Peking's erstwhile sup-
 porters now refuse to go along
 with the Chinese delegation.
 At the World Peace Council meet-
 ing in Geneva this past June,
 for example, the Chinese were
 consistently supported only by
 the Albanians, although the Ko-
 reans, Vietnamese, and Japanese
 were present.
 Prospects
 There is every indication
 that Peking for some time to
 come will proceed along the un-
 compromising, isolationist
 course already charted, even
 at the cost of what it views
 as "temporary" losses.   The
 fundamental reason for this is
 the conviction of the Chinese
 that they have fallen heir to
 the mantle of world revolu-
 tionary leadership.   The pres-
 ent defiant,'truculent line
 will probably be refined,
 elaborated on, and carried to
 ever greater extremes.   Peking
 and its dwindling band of sup-
 porters will persist in what
 it terms its "principled stand."
 By their own actions the
 Chinese have made it next to
 impossible for themselves to
 shift course abruptly without
 repudiating the doctrinal po-
 sitions that lie at the roots
 of Peking's isolation.   Changes
 in the world situation, how-
 ever, could yet enable Peking
 to recoup some of its recent
 losses.   Two years ago there
 appeared little likelihood
 that the Chinese would be as
 isolated as they are today,
 and a shift of leadership in
 Peking or Moscow could alter
 China's presently bleak pros-
 pects.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN
