SCOPE NOTE 
Since 1978 Deng Xiaoping has sought to ensure the continuity of his 
political and economic reforms by selecting and securing powerful posts 
for his chosen successors. To a substantial degree, Chinese politics in the 
Deng era have been the politics of succession. This Estimate examines 
succession scenarios, key players, institutional interests, and implications 
for the United States over the next five years. It also examines regional 
and provincial aspects of succession as well as how the Taiwan issue, 
Sino-Soviet, and Sino-Japanese relations might impact on succession.

KEY JUDGMENTS 
Since our last assessment of political succession in China (NIE 13-10-
82), the Chinese polity and economy have undergone a dramatic 
sequence of changes. Deng and his allies have made more progress on 
their reform agenda than we anticipated, and have achieved consider-
able success in shoring up their political positions and initiating 
structural economic reforms. 
In particular, the earlier Estimate, although recognizing the cen-
trality of Deng's economic program to prospects for his successors, 
ascribed only a low probability of success for economic reform. We 
believe the stronger-than-anticipated performance of the Chinese econ-
omy markedly strengthens the succession prospects of Deng's reformist 
lieutenants. As long as they continue to demonstrate their ability to 
deliver practical results, prospects for an orderly succession are im-
proved. Conversely, a sharp deterioration in China's economic perfor-
mance or social stability while Deng is still in power would damage sig-
nificantly the equities of his chosen successors. 
Barring such an unforeseen event,' we believe the present balance 
of forces within the party basically sets the course for the duration of 
this decade. China's reformist leaders are in the midst of consolidating 
their position, and it will be exceedingly difficult for a small group of 
leaders to upset the political balance in Beijing. A calmer political 
culture has been established under Deng. Mao-style upheavals have 
been rejected. Conservatives simply do not have the power to win 
control of the Standing Committee, put a new Politburo and Secretariat 
in place, and dismantle both the policies and the broad leadership net 
that Deng has built up. And, once he is gone, it is doubtful whether 
there would be any old guard leader possessing the prestige, political 
power, and personal stamina to see the necessary changes through. 
When Deng dies or can no longer effectively control China's 
politics, the central question before the leadership will not be who 
becomes the titular head of the party, but who will really wield Deng's 
power. Short of a major power struggle and breakdown in social order, 
an exigency we consider unlikely, the post-Deng party elite and not the 
military will decide the issue. Reformists are the strongest force on the 
current Politburo and Secretariat. 
' Despite the many hazards that will confront China's modernization effort, we believe the most likely 
outcome over the next decade will be a general continuation of reform and an uneven but gradual growth of 
China's economic strength, stability, and power

Therefore, we are reasonably confident that reformist leaders would 
inherit Deng's mantle in relatively orderly fashion. The most likely such 
scenario, if Deng were to leave the political scene tomorrow, would be 
a two-stage process: 
? Hu Yaobang would maintain his position as General Secretary 
but would defer to the surviving party elders so long as they did 
not tamper with longer term succession arrangements. 
? One of Deng's generational peers?we believe President Li 
Xiannian or Politburo member and Military Commission Vice 
Chairman Yang Shangkun most likely?would assume some of 
Deng's responsibilities as broker, although much less effectively 
than Deng has done. 
? Zhao Ziyang would remain as Premier, and the rest of the 
leadership would remain largely intact. 
? As time passed and the elders began to fade, a second stage of 
the succession would begin to unfold, in which Hu, Zhao, and 
several younger leaders assumed greater prominence and estab-
lished their own power relationships that more fully consolidat-
ed their positions. After a period of sorting out, we expect 
another "first among equals" to emerge in Beijing. 
In the event Deng were not to leave the political scene for some 
time, the most likely scenario would be a relatively easy, one-stage 
transition in which younger reformists would take power, having 
consolidated their positions under Deng with the passage of time. 
Other possible succession scenarios are conceivable, but we view 
them as much less likely to occur than the above. For example: 
? The reformist group that Deng has led could break up into 
mutually exclusive groups once his stabilizing influence is 
removed. 
? Party elders might voluntarily withdraw, declaring their sup-
port for a succession to a younger leader, such as Hu Qili. 
? Hu Yaobang, Zhao, and other reformist leaders might decide to 
purge the remaining party elders. 
? The old guard might attempt a coup of its own, seeking in 
particular to oust Hu Yaobang. 
? Disgruntled military officers might attempt a coup, or the 
radical left might somehow return to power?although either of 
these is the least likely of all outcomes. 
In any event, the United States (or any other foreign power) has lit-
tle prospect of affecting succession outcomes in China. In our view, 
concerns of domestic political power, not policy issues, will be

controlling; and foreign policy considerations?short of some crucially 
important new development affecting the strategic environment?will 
be marginal at most. In fact, we believe Beijing will continue to pursue 
a pragmatic orientation in foreign policy, regardless of the likely 
successor regimes. 
Nonetheless, succession outcomes will have an important effect 
on the character of US-China relations. We expect any reformist 
succession regime to value continued correct relations with the United 
States, on the basis of strategic calculations and economic need. There 
could be important variations in tone and cooperativeness, however, on 
the basis of who emerges as China's most powerful leader in a post-
Deng situation: 
? The best outcome for US interests, regional and global, would be 
the emergence of pragmatic moderate leaders such as Zhao 
Ziyang or Hu Qili. Such leaders would be less inclined to stir up 
trouble over Taiwan or work very hard for close Sino-Soviet ties. 
They would also be more inclined to continue closer economic 
relations in the short term with the West. 
? The most likely outcome, however, will be a regime dominated 
by Hu Yaobang. 
u may see more openings or better relations with the Soviets 
than other reformist leaders. 
? A conservative, elderly leadership is an even less desirable 
succession outcome for US interests in Asia. The old guard are 
less inclined toward the domestic economic priorities that 
influence the foreign policy of the reformers, and they harbor 
more ideological reservations about dealing with the capitalist 
West. Although they are not pronouncedly pro-Soviet, their long 
experience with Soviet-style economic methods might make 
them more willing to draw closer to Moscow for economic 
purposes and perhaps on some global issues.

DISCUSSION 
Background 
1. Since our last assessment of political succession in 
China (NIE 13-10-82), the Chinese polity and econo-
my have undergone a dramatic sequence of changes. 
Deng and his allies have made more progress on their 
reform agenda than we anticipated, and have 
achieved considerable success in shoring up their 
political ositions and initiating structural economic 
reforms. 
2. In particular, the earlier Estimate, although rec-
ognizing the centrality of Deng's economic program to 
prospects for his successors, ascribed only a low proba-
bility of success for economic reform. We believe the 
stronger-than-anticipated performance of the Chinese 
economy markedly strengthens the succession pros-
pects of Deng's reformist lieutenants: as long as the 
reformist leadership continues to demonstrate their 
ability to deliver economic results, their political grip 
must strengthen. In fact, we believe the most likely 
outcome over the next decade?despite the many 
hazards that will confront China's modernization ef-
fort?will be a general continuation of reform and an 
uneven but gradual growth of China's economic 
strength, stability, and power 
The Current Political Scene 
3. Deng has never been the party's titular chief. 
Formally, he is ranked higher now?second, behind 
Hu Yaobang?than at any previous time. Yet, despite 
China's acutely hierarchical system, Deng?as broker, 
conciliator, and final decisionmaker?has clearly been 
China's boss for several years. Paradoxically, it is 
precisely this state of affairs, in which a more junior 
leader officially presides while the subordinate elder 
leader actually rules, that may force any still active 
leaders of Deng's generation?men like President Li 
Xiannian, Politburo Standing Committee member 
Chen Yun, Military Commission Vice Chairman Yang 
Shangkun, and National People's Congress Chairman 
Peng Zhen?into eventual competition with party 
General Secretary Hu Yaobang for recognition as the 
party's dominant leader. When Deng dies or is inca-
pacitated, the main task before the leadership will not 
be the formal selection of a new party chief?that post 
will be occupied by Hu or another younger leader. 
The immediate succession issue will be to answer the 
more complex question: who will wield Deng's power? 
4. Like Mao, Deng has sought to present his col-
leagues with formal succession arrangements that will 
make power distribution a foregone conclusion on his 
death or incapacitation. Also, like Mao, he has become 
somewhat dissatisfied with the performance of his 
chosen heirs, although he has not pursued Mao's 
radical remedy of a wholesale political purge. In the 
final analysis, however, it will still be the post-Deng 
party elite who will decide the succession. That is, a 
small circle of the most powerful leaders will have to 
choose between leaving Deng's succession arrange-
ments basically intact, or modifying them 
5. Since our earlier Estimate, the individuals, insti-
tutions, and political processes that will shape choices 
have changed significantly. From 1981 to 1985, most 
important central and provincial leadership positions 
have changed hands, and many, more than once. The 
first phase in Deng's six-year effort to install -younger, 
more revolutionary, better educated, and technically 
competent" officials in the top posts culminated in 
September 1985 at the National Conference of Party 
Delegates, which endorsed changes affecting approxi-
mat 1 one-fourth of the Central Committee member-
ship 
6. Central Committee. As a result of the Septem-
ber party meetings, the Central Committee for the 
first time has a markedly reformist cast. Approximate-
ly 19 percent of the 343-member body is now made 
up of first-time members. Generally younger and 
better educated, the new members are predominantly 
newly promoted ministers and provincial officials 
whose appointments were expressly intended to fur-
ther reformist goals. Military representation on the 
Central Committee was reduced to 56 members (about 
16 percent), its lowest point in decades. 
7. Politburo/Politburo Standing Committee. At 
the party meetings, 10 Politburo members?eight of 
whom were in their seventies or eighties--retired" 
from their posts, and six younger members were

added, reducing total Politburo membership from 26 
to 22. With the retirement of Marshal Ye Jianying, the 
Standing Committee was reduced to five members: 
Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, Li Xian-
nian, and Chen Yun, leaving reformers with a 3:2 
advantage on the party's most powerful body. Al-
though the reorganized Politburo spans the entire 
spectrum of Chinese politics, in our analysis, the 
reform group holds a slim but absolute majority on 
that body (see table). The ranks of conservative party 
elders have been drastically thinned, but the most 
important players stayed on, particularly Chen Yun 
and Peng Zhen. Because the reformers face no cohe-
sive opposition bloc on the Politburo but rather a loose 
collection of conservatives, moderates, and swing 
votes, we judge their plurality to be stronger than the 
bare numbers indicate 
8. Secretariat. The political balance on the 11-
member Secretariat since the September party sessions 
is even more pronouncedly pro-reform. The solid 
reform core of Hu Yaobang, Hu Qili, and Wan Li was 
strengthened at the September party meetings by the 
addition of five new members, all of  whom are 
considered pro-reform to varying degrees. 
9. A Stabilized Balance. Barring an unforeseen 
disaster, we believe the balance of forces within the 
party that emerged from the September 1985 meet-
ings basically sets the course for the duration of this 
decade. China is now in the midst of a reformist 
consolidation, during which it will be exceedingly 
difficult for a small group of leaders to upset the 
political balance in Beijing. The arrangement of party 
institutions will be difficult for conservatives to shake 
partly because of the calmer political culture estab-
lished under Deng and the rejection of Mao-style 
upheavals, and, consequently, because conservatives 
would have to follow a path Deng laid out: win control 
of the Standing Committee, put a new Politburo and 
Secretariat in place, and dismantle both the policies 
and the broad leadership net that has been built over 
the past three years. Once Deng is gone, it is doubtful 
whether there would be any old guard leader possess-
ing the prestige, political power and rsonal stamina 
to see those changes through

10. If the current political conditions of stability 
and relative consensus continue to obtain at the time 
Deng leaves the scene, various of these other institu-
tions and participants will play only a facilitating or 
insurance role. Under some circumstances, however, 
especially if Deng's departure precipitated a serious 
breakdown in social order?the role of the military 
and public security organs could grow substantiall 
larger and, perhaps, even be determining. 
11. People's Liberation Army. Since the earliest 
days of China's revolution, the People's Liberation 
Army has been one of the main pillars of party power. 
It is well represented at the party's upper echelon, has 
the best and fastest electronic communications in 
China, its own newspapers, periodicals, and docu-
ments system, and many of the country's finest re-
search and production facilities. It is heavily garri-
soned in every important region, has vast experience 
in local pacification, and when called on has inter-
vened in politics with great effect. As a result, the 
Army remains a most important political actor. 
post have been rumored or adduced: that senior 
military officers oppose the move, that Deng has 
changed his mind, and that party leaders are reluctant 
to grant Hu additional authority. None of these is 
compelling 
12. Deng and others have devoted considerable 
energy to reforming the Army, both in its relationship 
to the party and government and as a professional 
military organization. As chairman of the party and 
state military commissions, Deng has sought to dis-
tance the Army from politics and to ensure it loyalty 
during a succession. Within the armed forces, he has 
introduced reforms that have brought about nearly a 
complete turnover of commanders at every level, the 
demobilization of hundreds of thousands of officers 
and men, and improvements in war-fighting capabili-
ty, weapon and logistic systems, and morale. Although 
there has been some dissatisfaction with aspects of 
Deng's military reforms, the strength of his leadership 
was demonstrated during the Fourth Plenum of the 
12th Central Committee in September 1985, when 
seven career officers resigned from the Politburo. 
13. In our view, one of the key questions involving 
the succession to Deng concerns his replacement as 
chairman of the party Military Commission, a job 
perceived as one with great powers. Since late 1984, 
 iDeng intends for Hu Yaobang to replace 
him as Mili
t
ary Commission chairman. Hu has not 
done so, and for this reason, more than any other, the 
succession picture is not yet wholly clear. Several 
explanations of Hu's failure to assume the military 
14. We believe, however, that the centrality of the 
Military Commission chairmanship to the political 
succession does not make the armed forces any more 
influential in that decision. In fact, the ultimate choice 
of Deng's successor on the Military Commission will 
be made by the party leadership, not by the Military 
Commission alone. Senior soldier politicians will be 
consulted on that choice but, in our view, are unlikely 
to have predominant influence. Deng has strongly 
reinforced the time honored precept that the armed 
forces must be subordinate to party leadership, and we 
are persuaded that none of the political leaders who 
may vie for Deng's power are inclined to alter the 
civilian-military balance, nor would any senior mili-
tary leader lightly consider intervening on the side of 
one or another potential leader 
15. Ministry of Public Security and People's 
Armed Police. The ministry and the Armed Police, in 
our view, are most important primarily as peacekeep-
ing forces in the event of social disorder. Reformers 
within the party have been tinkering with the security 
apparatus at least since the 12th Party Congress in 
1982, largely, we believe, to curb the bald abuses of 
power that had long characterized the police force and 
to line it up more securely behind the reforms. The 
most recent personnel shakeup in the ministry placed 
at its head a reformist technocrat who has career ties 
to Hu Yaobang 
16. Party General Office. The General Office 
performs two functions that will be of prime impor-
tance during a succession period. First, it is responsible 
for the dissemination of party documents, basically 
determining who gets to see what. Second, and of 
potentially crucial significance, it provides for the 
physical security of the top leadership through its 
Central Guards Bureau, which formally is subordinate 
to the Ministry of Public Security but in fact operates 
out of the General Office and is directed by its First 
Deputy Director, Yang Dezhong. The bureau has 
detailed knowledge of the movements and special 
requirements of each Politburo- and Secretariat-level 
leader and not only protects but provides for the 
physical comfort of the leadership. Its potential power 
was amply demonstrated in 1976, when the bureau, 
then known as the 8341 Unit, arrested Mao's wife and 
her three Shanghai colleagues, the so-called Gang of 
Four.

17. Deng and his allies have attended carefully to 
ensuring the absolute loyalty of the General Office 
and Guards Bureau directors. Like other departments 
within the party bureaucracy, the General Office has 
been reorganized and placed under reformist leader-
ship. The current director, Wang Zhaoguo, is a reliable 
reformer who recently was named to the Secretariat 
and whose star is one of the most rapidly rising in 
China. Yang Dezhong has directed the Guards Bureau 
since the late 1970s and presumably is trusted by 
Deng. 
Contesting Individuals 
18. The Party Elders. In China, power within the 
party has tended to gravitate toward the most experi-
enced senior veterans who have developed the person-
al connections necessary to sustain a long political life. 
In our view, political power in China is structured in 
such a way that, in the near term, no younger leader 
could slip into Deng's shoes and play his pivotal roles. 
Despite increasing institutionalization, Chinese politics 
remain dominated by guanxi?simply, personal con-
nections or "pull"?and Deng has the guanxi to 
deliver where others cannot. Even his political oppo-
nents seem to regard Deng as a man of honor who 
keeps his end of a bargain. Few men outside the most 
senior leaders can approach the kind of support Deng 
routinely commands. 
19. For a variety of reasons?not the least of which 
is a jealous preservation of their unique standing 
within the party?the elders seem to place an inordi-
nate reliance on the collective wisdom and vision of 
their own generation. In our view, China's second- and 
third-echelon leaders are regarded by the revolution-
ary veterans as distinctly junior members of the party 
elite. For the immediate period after Deng's death, 
therefore, we believe?should the current leadership 
remain otherwise intact?that Deng's generational 
peers have the prestige, guanxi, and bureaucratic clout 
to decide the distribution of power. If they should 
survive Deng in sufficient numbers, a majority of 
party elders could close ranks, insist on moving down 
the pecking order of the gerontocracy, and look to one 
of their own for leadership 
20. Succession estimates must therefore be con-
cerned not only with Deng's death but with the deaths 
of his generational peers. During the next five years, it 
is highly probable that most of those remaining from 
the "founding" generation will either die or become 
otherwise inactive. Chen Yun and Li Xiannian have 
long been ailing, Peng Zhen is 84, and Yang Shangkun, 
Deng's man, seems the fittest of the lot but is about 78. 
Although Deng's health probably is superior to either 
Chen's or Li's, it seems no better than Peng Zhen's. In 
our judgment, the order in which the top leadership 
departs the political scene is perhaps central to short-
term prospects for a smooth succession. This is so 
because three of the four most powerful party elders?
Li, Chen, and Peng?have, at one time or another, 
been at odds with aspects of Deng's reform program. 
Although all the elders have broadly supported struc-
tural change and economic reform, some have ex-
pressed serious reservations about pace, scope, and 
several specific reform policies. All tend to favor 
"collective leadership"?in which their influence will 
weigh heavily?and a rejuvenation of party leader-
ship, although they ma not fully support Deng's 
succession choices. 
21. The Successor Generation. In our view, the 
practical range of succession candidates is narrow?
largely because of Deng's personnel measures?and 
the criteria according to which they are evaluated will 
be fairly specific. Although it is conceivable that a 
relative unknown may rise suddenly to a position of 
great importance, we view this as highly unlikely and 
confine our attention to the group of leaders who are 
current members of the Central Committee. We 
narrow our focus in this way because the Central 
Committee itself has been shaped precisely with the 
succession in mind by the very political forces and 
players that ultimately will determine the post-Deng 
leadership. 
22. Moreover, we believe the field must be delimit-
ed further. We estimate that all the party's most 
important national leaders over the next five years will 
be drawn from three classes of officials: those current-
ly sitting on the two top party bodies, the Politburo 
and Secretariat; those who head national departments 
within the party bureaucracy (both military and civil-
ian); and those who are principal party secretaries in 
China's 29 provincial-level jurisdictions. In our view, 
the post-Deng configuration of political power will 
emerge from the group of approximately 60 officials. 
23. The current Central Committee and, more im-
portant, the core of 60 key leaders have been chosen 
according to political criteria established under Deng, 
and we expect prospective leaders during the next five 
years generally to reflect Deng's preferences. Although 
the age of these leaders ranges from 42 to 83, those 
most relevent to the succession question are clustered 
in the 50 to 60 group and are part of China's second

and third echelons. Generally, they share common 
traits and career patterns: 
? All have spent their entire adult lives in the 
party, but some have developed expertise in 
specific professions (like banking or engineering) 
other than general politics. 
? As a rule, they have devoted greater attention to 
formal education than the party veterans they 
will replace. 
? Virtually all, including those of a relatively con-
servative cast, appear generally agreed that the 
policies and practices of the Mao era were 
disastrous for China. None can be considered a 
"leftist" in any historical sense of that term. 
? Most have "clean" Cultural Revolution records; 
that is, almost all resisted or in some way were 
victimized by the radicalized party leadership of 
that period. 
24. The most important second- and third-echelon 
leaders?and the men about whom most succession 
speculation has focused?are Hu Yaobang, Zhao 
Ziyang, Wan Li, Yao Yilin, Hu Qili, Qiao Shi, Tian 
jiyun, Li Peng, and Wang Zhaoguo (see foldout at 
back). 
Succession Scenarios 
25. Prologue. At present, the key uncertainties 
concern Deng's precise intentions and the standing of 
Hu Yaobang. These were less problematic when the 
succession Estimate of 1982 was written. At that time, 
we were reasonably confident that Deng's succession 
plans called for Hu to serve as party chief and Zhao as 
premier following Deng's death. That analysis was 
consistently confirmed by Deng's own statements and 
by a wide variety of intelligence reporting. Since that 
time, our knowledge of Chinese politics and personal-
ities has advanced considerably. Moreover, the general 
leadership picture is far more stable now than it was 
four years ago, when Hua Guofeng remained a Polit-
buro Standing Committee member and it was uncer-
tain whether Hu Yaobang or Zhao Ziyang would 
remain on the scene for the duration of the Estimate 
period. 
26. Nevertheless, our more detailed understanding 
includes little direct information on the current status 
of succession planning. From the spring of 1985 until 
the September party meetings, accounts of a new 
succession arrangement circulated through Beijing, the 
provinces, and among the Hong Kong "China-watching 
community." It was reliably reported that Deng would 
vacate the chairmanship of the party Military Commis-
sion for Hu Yaobang and that Hu Qili would replace his 
mentor as party general secretary. On the state side, Li 
Xiannian reportedly was set to retire, Zhao to move to 
the presidency, and Li Peng to become premier. This 
arrangement was repeatedly confirmed in intelligence 
and Hong Kong reports until the September sessions, 
when the stories stopped completely. The story was 
revived in late March of this year when China's weekly 
news magazine for foreign audiences, the Beijing 
Review, referred to Hu and Zhao as connecting links 
between the pioneers and the successors of the revolu-
tion, implying that Hu Qili and other third-echelon 
leaders were the true successors. 
27. Deng's Intentions. We cannot reconcile the 
strong signal on succession issued by Beijing in mid-
1985 with the subsequent silence from all quarters 
following the September meetings. We believe Deng 
may intend one of two options: 
? Deng may be satisfied with the current configu-
ration of leaders, which, in our view, favors 
reformist continuity at the top party and state 
levels. Under these circumstances, it may then be 
left to Hu and Zhao to manage the succession 
following Deng's death, more or less as executors 
of his political will. Circumstantial evidence 
supports this interpretation: neither Hu nor Zhao 
appear to be leaders preparing for an exit, both 
seem to enjoy Deng's continued support, timing 
their departures may be particularly difficult?a 
change in the top leaders almost certainly would 
be viewed by Chinese as a reform-related politi-
cal retreat?and both have recently strengthened 
themselves with their respective bureaucracies. 
? Alternately, Deng may still be committed to the 
succession arrangements circulated in mid-1985 
and, at an opportune moment, may replace Hu 
and Zhao with younger, more energetic leaders 
who can assure leadership?and therefore poli-
cy?continuity into the next decade. Circumstan-
tial evidence supports this interpretation also. It is 
apparent from Deng's comments and the person-
nel appointments made over the past three years 
that he fully intends for the "third echelon"?
party leaders in their forties and fifties who have 
been selected for future prominence?to assume 
most of the routine responsibilities of leadership 
and to do so before Deng departs the scene. Deng 
has avowed publicly that Hu Yaobang and Zhao

Ziyang both are already old men. Younger lead-
ers such as Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Li Peng, and 
Qiao Shi obviously are being groomed for top 
party and state posts and have played a more 
visible role since the September party meetings. 
28. The Trouble With Hu. From the outset, the 
principal sticking point in Deng's succession arrange-
ments appears to have been Hu Yaobang. Hu was a 
controversial choice to head the party, not only among 
the party veterans but also for the rank and file. He is 
hard driving, outspoken, abrasive, and too "liberal" for 
many party traditionalists. Deng, however, obviously 
saw in Hu a pugnacious "doer" who could goad the 
hidebound party bureaucracy into action, work long 
hours attending to necessary detail, go on inspection 
tours, and thereby allow Deng the freedom to play the 
sagacious elder statesman. Most important, Deng must 
believe that Hu will continue to support the Policies 
both have worked to set in place. 
29. Hu's rise under Deng's tutelage and his tenden-
cy to stake out extreme positions have drawn fire from 
numerous critics. During his five years atop the party 
bureaucracy, Hu has absorbed much of the criticism 
and little of the credit for China's policies, and he is 
personally associated with the most controversial as-
pects of the reform, such as efforts to propagandize 
China's newly wealthy peasant households and the 
push to replace superannuated officials. 
30. Among his critics, Hu's views and unconven-
tional, combative style have tended to overshadow his 
political and organizational abilities, with the conse-
quence that Hu has had problems winning the full 
approval of senior party traditionalists. To some party 
veterans, Hu is a man who jumps too easily to 
conclusions, is too readily tempted to impetuous ac-
tion, and therefore may not be quite up to the job of 
party general secretary. 
leaders such as Chen Yun, Zhao Ziyang, and 
even Deng Xiaoping have at one time or another been 
critical of Hu's performance. 
31. By the spring of 1985, when the new succession 
package entered circulation, Hu had already commit-
ted a number of public faux pas, which fueled 
speculation that Deng would move Hu to a post with 
less public exposure. Despite circumstantial evidence 
that Deng and Hu disagree on aspects of policy, there 
has been no convincing evidence that they at any time 
have had a serious falling out. Deng, however, proba-
bly weighed his colleagues' reservations about Hu into 
his deliberations on the succession. We have seen no 
convincing evidence, nevertheless, that Deng has lost 
confidence in his protege of more than 40 years. 
32. The Plan. It is more probable, however, that 
Deng wished to preserve both the influence of Hu (and 
Zhao Ziyang) as well as to demonstrate progress toward 
rejuvenation at the highest party and state levels by 
bringing in third-echelon leaders. In our view, there-
fore, the competing interpretations of Deng's intention 
can be merged into a relatively unified view. At the 
same time, Deng may be urging them to follow his 
own way to reduced, selective involvement in routine 
affairs of party and state. Rather than moving off to 
purely honorary duties, the two leaders may remain 
members of the Politburo Standing Committee. If the 
leadership package of mid-1985 is still intact, it will 
have fostered the impression of a working "cadre 
reserve" not only for provincial and lower-level posi-
tions but for the topmost posts as well. The arrange-
ment seems to advance the reformist cause in several 
ways: 
? It would put in place a leadership group commit-
ted to reform and young enough to be able to see 
plans through and would do so while Deng is still 
alive and able to oversee its consolidation of 
power. 
? It would lessen the possibility of a messy power 
struggle over the succession to Hu Yaobang. 
? It would make Beijing's cadre rejuvenation poli-
cy more credible by extending it to the highest 
ranks of the party and state. 
? To a degree, it may mollify conservative con-
cerns about Hu Yaobang and prevent Hu from 
acquiring the power of China's two key posts. 
? It would tend to advance Deng's efforts to clearly 
separate party and government authority, again 
preventin one 1 ad r from acquiring too much 
power. 
33. Such a plan may at the moment remain a dormant 
item on Deng's agenda, pending other more pressing 
business. We believe that, eventually, Deng wants Hu 
Qili to replace Hu Yaobang as party general secretary 
at an opportune moment. In our view, Deng probably 
wants to put this plan into effect at or before the 
13th Party Congress, scheduled for some time in 1987. 
The package may or may not have the Central Commit-
tee's official endorsement. It is conceivable that the

details of Deng's arrangements are highly classified 
and have been circulated only in restricted channels. It 
is also possible they are strongly opposed by various 
party leaders. Hu Yaobang's status seems a continuing 
problem. To a lesser extent, so seems the identity of 
Zhao's successor. But, even if Deng's plan ran into 
political trouble over the summer of 1985, it would be 
out of character for Deng to accept a setback on so 
important an issue and then to resign himself to 
arrangements cobbled together through politics. We 
presume, therefore, that Deng's succession proposals of 
1985 are the reformist succession agenda and will be 
the center of controvers if Deng dies before he can 
put them into effect. 
34. Key Succession Concerns. In our estimation, 
three key variables in the succession to Deng will be 
the condition of China's economy, the longevity of 
Deng  and other key elders, and Hu Yaobang's ambi-
tions. 
35. An ailing economy will complicate the transfer 
of power in post-Deng China. Conversely, a continua-
tion of China's generally healthy economic perfor-
mance will all but ensure the continuation of reform-
ers in office. The Chinese economy, although 
experiencing its share of problems, has done far better 
than most observers expected, but critics of reform 
tend to judge the reforms on other than purely 
economic grounds, such as ideology and social impact 
of the new policies. Deng and his allies have demon-
strated considerable flexibility and willingness to com-
promise on economic problems, in part because they 
view their own programs as experimental and unprov-
en, in part to undermine critics and neutralize the 
economy as succession issue. 
36. If Deng outlives other powerful members of 
the party old guard, chances for a smooth succession 
will improve. There are differences among the re-
formers most closely allied to Deng, but it is highly 
unlikely that, within the period of this Estimate, these 
differences could form the basis of a succession strug-
gle. However, if Deng should die before Chen Yun or 
Peng Zhen, the party elders would be in much better 
position to assert their own preferences or, more 
probably, to play the principally negative role of 
undermining or delaying what they do not like. Should 
several powerful elders outlive Deng, they may be 
able to exercise a veto over the ensuing distribution of 
power. In our estimation, if even one of the most 
important of the elders survives Deng, a younger 
successor such as Hu would in the short term be 
constrained to defer to the older leader. 
37. Hu Yaobang's own ambitions are a topic for 
speculation, and, while Deng lives, are largely a 
function of Deng's intentions. On several occasions 
since 1984, Hu has intimated publicly that he may 
vacate his post by the next party congress in 1987. The 
succession plan of mid-1985, however, raises several 
questions concerning Hu's status. It is not clear, for 
example, that Hu is willing to resign voluntarily the 
post of General Secretary or that he still expects to 
assume the post of Military Commission chairman. If 
he does, the military leadership finally must have 
reconciled itself to Hu's leadership, but we have seen 
few signs of this. 
38. That the Politburo may already in principle 
have decided on its future composition, and, conse-
quently, on who will lead the party is at least a 
possibility. 
t the summer meetings to prepare for the 
September party sessions, the Politburo fixed an age 
limit of 72 for its members. The measure reportedly 
does not affect Politburo members already past the 
retirement age. Thus Deng Xiaoping and other senior 
leaders would be immune from the provisions, while 
Hu Yaobang, who will reach the ceiling in 1987, when 
the next party congress is scheduled to meet, could be 
compelled to step down. The regulation was probably 
intended to facilitate an orderly succession, perhaps to 
mollify Hu's critics, and may even have been framed 
with Hu specifically in mind. 
39. We rule out a long period of collective leader-
ship for China after Deng. The current regime in some 
respects already operates more collectively than its 
predecessor under Mao, but, when issues have snarled, 
it has fallen to a single man, Deng, to cut the knot. 
After a period of sorting out, we expect another -first 
among equals" to emerge in Beijing. This leader, like 
Deng, will need the respect of his peers, the experi-
ence to bring issues to closure, and the personal and 
bureaucratic connections enabling him to discipline 
rebellious junior officials. 
40. Calling the Succession. As the foregoing dis-
cussion suggests, any attempt to sketch out a range of 
succession scenarios necessarily must be broadly specu-
lative. For most of the scenarios discussed below, 
including what we term the -most likely case," a two-
stage process is posited: during the first stage, political 
relations are clarified; in the second, political power is 
consolidated by whoever gained most during the 
earlier period. In the first stage, Deng's leadership 
proposal of 1985 probably will drive succession poli-
tics. For a relatively brief period, perhaps less than a

year, considerable positional jockeying will take place 
as the players look to their interests and take soundings 
on potential measures to shore up political liabilities. 
During this first stage, we believe the surviving elders 
of the revolutionary generation will continue to play a 
strong role and will generally press for arrangements 
that best suit their interests. Their range of influence 
will nevertheless be restricted by the preponderance of 
younger, more dynamic leaders in the top party, state, 
and military organs. The younger leaders will not, in 
our view, seek to convert their numerical superiority 
into a victory by force. Both elders and younger 
leaders probably will want to avoid a showdown 
atmosphere, not only because of the political risks 
involved for all sides but also to preserve the sem-
blance of leadership stability and unity as the elite 
goes about filling the vast vacuum Deng will leave. 
41. The second stage will occupy the remainder of 
the Estimate period and beyond. In our view, although 
the structure of power will be less clear cut, the main 
feature of the later succession years will be the 
emerging authority of a new generation of party 
elders: men such as, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, 
who by 1.990 will be less than 75 years old and will 
have been able to establish strong political bases within 
the party and state. Those leaders we currently identi-
fy as part of the "old guard- will begin to fade from 
the scene, unable for lack of energy or reliable support 
from below to compete with more energetic younger 
leaders. During this period, new political cleavages are 
likely to appear as the principal successors jockey for 
power and authority among themselves and as China's 
changing economic and strategic conditions present 
the leadership with new challenges and problems. 
42. The Most Likely Case. A sequence of proce-
dures triggered by Deng's death or incapacitation 
almost certainly has been predetermined in Beijing. 
We expect the Politburo to convene, probably with the 
Secretariat and assorted elders, in an expanded meet-
ing. When Deng dies, a funeral committee will be 
formally named, or, more likely, a preset committee 
endorsed. As the ranking member of the Politburo 
Standing Committee, Hu Yaobang almost certainly 
will head the committee and deliver the eulogy. The 
Military Commission chairmanship may be an issue if 
Deng has not by that time stepped down: the Politburo 
may take preliminary steps toward appointing a suc-
cessor or, more simply, can opt to continue as before, 
with the commission permanent Secretary General 
presiding over the work of that organ 
43. In the immediate aftermath of Deng's death or 
incapacitation, the party elders will be at their maxi-
mum influence. The interests of the reformist succes-
sors appear best served by continuing to defer to the 
veteran revolutionaries, preserving the appearance of 
relative harmony at the top and content that time 
ultimately is in their favor. Younger leaders, who 
generally are in control of the bureaucracy, probably 
will use a variety of procedural dodges to close off 
political tam erin with succession arrangements by 
party elders. 
44. Demonstrating concern for the veteran revolu-
tionaries in the short term may well be accomplished 
by permitting an elder to assume Deng's role in having 
the final say on the largest matters. We believe either 
Li Xiannian or Yang Shangkun is best suited for the 
role of ranking elder. Both, in our view, are more able 
to stand above the fray and perhaps have their 
political equities spread more evenly throughout the 
bureaucracy. From the elder candidates, we specifi-
cally exclude Chen Yun because of his physical infir-
mities and Peng Zhen, who may have been neutralized 
by reports of corruption within his family. Whoever 
assumes the role, however, will not be another Deng 
Xiaoping. None of the likely candidates has Deng's 
unique combination of skills, initiative, power, and 
prestige. 
45. If Deng were to die soon?while the current 
leadership configuration is intact?the reformers may 
put prudence before other considerations and tempo-
rize on outstanding personnel questions, thereby cool-
ing the controversy that apparently has surrounded the 
leadership proposals of 1985. We do not therefore 
expect Deng's death to trigger an upheaval in the top 
government leadership. Zhao Ziyang will remain Pre-
mier, at least through what we identified above as the 
first stage of the transition period. Hu Yaobang will 
remain the General Secretary, but his behavior at this 
time will be critical to succession outcomes. He proba-
bly is politically resourceful enough to control his 
ambitions and keep the situation on an even keel. 
46. If the first stage of the succession proceeds 
roughly aldng lines discussed above, the reformers?
and especially Hu and Zhao?will be in fine political 
shape for consolidation in the second stage, as the 
current generation of elders musters out of politics and 
the succession regime settles into "normal- politics. As 
Hu, Zhao, and select other leaders of their generation 
grow in stature and authority, they will face the same 
choice as Deng: either to assume a lowered profile, 
operating largely behind the scenes through reliable

subalterns; or to insist on retaining their places as the 
top party and state officials, presiding over routine 
affairs. 
47. Both men will become increasingly preoccupied 
with their own succession arrangements and with 
further defining the structure of party power. Over 
the latter part of the Estimate period, the younger 
leaders now on the Politburo and Secretariat will 
dominate speculation over the allocation of top party 
and state slots, but new, currently unknown, leaders 
almost certainly will come to the fore as a "fourth 
echelon" begins its ascent. 
48. If Deng remains in his current state of good 
health for at least another year or two, the prospects 
for a smooth succession are even stronger. On the basis 
of available evidence, we believe Deng will continue 
his efforts to install a second-stage succession, as 
described above. If he is successful and a leadership 
core of Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, or Li Peng, and perhaps 
Qiao Shi is emplaced at the 13th Party Congress, 
succession essentially will have been completed, and 
Deng could withdraw from political activity with less 
likelihood of political disruption. The succession pro-
cess would then be a one-stage consolidation effort on 
the part of younger leaders who ha ? established their 
positions under Deng's protection. 
49. Less Likely Scenarios. Other outcomes worth 
considering are discussed below in the order of esti-
mated probability. 
50. The Elders Retreat. T e senior leaders may 
choose fully to accept Deng's arrangements and throw 
their collective weight behind a true third-echelon 
succession to Hu Qili and either Li Peng or Tian Jiyun. 
By stepping aside, the old guard would be seen as 
voting for stability and continuity, values Deng has 
sought to institutionalize. However, they may only be 
abandoning the field to the most powerful second-
echelon figures. Doing so would, in our view, be the 
equivalent of allowing Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang 
to have absolute sway over outcomes in the succession 
period 
51. Moreover, loss of official position, whether 
through retirement or demotion, has always entailed 
loss of status or face as well. Although Deng managed 
to effect a more or less voluntary surrender of power 
by 10 Politburo members at the Fourth Plenum in 
September 1985, the younger leaders would presum-
ably have to grant concessions to the elders on a broad 
range of policy questions and protocol issues in order 
to buy their compliance with succession arrangements. 
For the short term, then, policy could become more 
conservative, deliberate, and dogmatic following a 
retreat by the old guard. Over the long run, however, 
the preferences of the young reformers would become 
more evident. 
52. Coup of the Successors. It is conceivable that 
Deng has not only protected his youthful proteges 
from bullying by party elders,' but that he also has 
restrained the newly powerful second- and third-
echelon leaders from wholly deposing the remaining 
veteran revolutionaries of Deng's own generation. 
When Deng dies, Hu, Zhao, and younger leaders, 
emboldened by a long run of success in securing 
favorable personnel placement in the center and prov-
inces, may attempt to fully consolidate a successors' 
regime by seeking to dislodge elders like Chen Yun 
and Li Xiannian from their satrapies within the party. 
53. In our view, however, any effort to exclude the 
elders from significant political participation, aside 
from shattering the myth of leadership harmony, 
would not only court the unified opposition of threat-
ened senior civilian and military leaders, but would 
also likely split the ranks of younger reformers, which 
are populated with the children of high-ranking offi-
cials. 
54. The Elders' Revenge. With Deng out of the 
way, the party's old guard conceivably could seek to 
install its own choices in the top party and state posts 
and attempt to reverse aspects of reform they consider 
most onerous. Under such circumstances, Hu Yaobang 
would be the most obvious target for replacement, 
perhaps even in order to hasten the accession of Hu 
Qili. Some government leaders like Tian Jiyun, who 
previously have been under challenge, may also be 
threatened. Zhao Ziyang, on the other hand, seems to 
have won high marks across the board and may be 
virtually immune to a move by the elders 
55. We believe, however, that most of the veteran 
revolutionaries will place an overwhelming value on 
political stability and, if unprovoked, will be loath to 
act contrary to standing arrangements in a precipitous 
fashion. Moreover, it seems that the process of displac-
ing a leader like Hu Yaobang, who already has more 
than five years of experience in the top post and has 
supporters interlarded throughout the bureaucracy, 
would require more time and more stamina than is 
available to most elders. Finally, the old guard is far 
from unified on succession questions, and key elders 
like Yang Shangkun and Xi Zhongxun are likely to 
back Deng's arrangements solidly.

56. The Reformers Factionalize. It is possible that 
the group that has come to be known as the reform 
coalition or reform faction will subdivide into mutual-
ly exclusive groups once the stabilizing influence of 
Deng Xiaoping is removed. It is not uncommon within 
Chinese personal loyalty-based groups for the erst-
while subordinates to contest each other bitterly for 
leadership once the chief is gone, and even to break up 
the group in the process. Because the reform program 
itself is more an operational ethos than a specific set of 
policies or principles, the group's loyalty to constituent 
members might easily be strained in a post-Deng era. 
There have already been rumors and some indications 
of tension between Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, and 
personal feuds between other reformers would seem 
equally possible. If these break out in a period shortly 
after Deng's death, they could throw the succession 
situation into considerable turmoil. 
57. We believe, however, that reformers are as 
committed to at least the image of political unity and 
stability as are the party elders, and would seek to 
submerge their differences and avoid damaging the 
party's legitimacy through internecine quarreling, at 
least during the early phase of succession. They would 
have the additional motives of wanting to avoid giving 
conservatives any political advantage, and of making 
sure that the positive results already achieved through 
reform would not be lost to traditional factional 
infighting. We believe that Deng's efforts to disperse 
power within the system to different institutions might 
also help lessen the temptation to engage in personal 
power struggles. In the second stage of the succession 
process, however, we believe that readjustment or 
even dissolution of the current reform coalition is a 
greater likelihood. 
58. Soldiers in ommans. We believe that an 
armed coup or the installation of a regime dominated 
by soldiers is an extremely remote possibility. Perhaps 
under conditions of escalating social disorder following 
Deng's death, the Army might be called on to control 
violence. In our view, however, China's senior military 
leaders would not otherwise dare to order their troops 
to -storm the palace" should the post-Deng team not 
suit them. Moreover, the system of political controls 
that penetrates the military structure at every level is 
specifically designed to alert the civilian party of 
putschist activity. Nonetheless, it is clear from the 
customary caution with which civilian leaders handle 
the military, that, from Deng on down, they are wary 
of the Army and perhaps believe that a well-placed, 
well-organized group of armed cons irators could gain 
military control of China 
59. The Left Resurgent. If it is presumed that 
Deng, by the sheer force of his personality and 
political connections, has been able to suppress the 
recrudescence of Cultural Revolution-style leftism, his 
death may, under some circumstances, presage an 
attempt by more orthodox Maoists to recapture politi-
cal leadership. However, there is no current member 
of the Politburo or Secretariat who would be likely to 
lead or even support a "leftist" resurgence, and the 
constituency within the party or society for such a 
movement is virtually nil. In our estimation, there is 
almost no possibility of a leftist revival over the next 
five years. 
60. We believe that Chinese leftists?whose num-
bers have rapidly dissipated but pockets of whom 
remain at lower levels?will have few opportunities to 
undertake the political offensive. The Cultural Revo-
lution and the policies it spawned are abhorred by 
most Chinese. The current party, state, and military 
structures are heavily populated with officials who 
were persecuted during that period and who would 
sternly resist a return to its policies or leaders. 
61. Implications for China's Future Policies. In 
our view, one of three basic policy orientations may 
characterize China after Deng, each one generally 
dependent on the personality and style of the leader 
who emerges as dominant: 
? Impatient for Success. A party dominated by 
Hu Yaobang would, in our view, be the closest 
approximation to China under Deng during his 
most enthusiastic moments. Hu has displayed 
much of Deng's impulsiveness without having 
the commensurate prestige or political acumen to 
know when and how to accommodate himself to 
opponents. In our view, the reforms would pro-
ceed basically as they have to date, subject 
perhaps to more frequent lurches between peri-
ods of reformist zeal and the determined braking 
efforts of moderates. We also believe that Hu is 
more stridently nationalistic than any of the 
other principal contenders for party leadership, 
which may find expression in China's relations 
with the West. 
? Cool and Deliberate. The party under men like 
Hu Qili or Zhao Ziyang would move in a more 
calculated fashion and would be less prone to 
grandiose gestures than either Deng or Hu Yao-
bang. We read both Zhao and Hu Qili as more 
inclined to compromise than Hu Yaobang. Policy 
continuity with the Deng era would be main-
tained, but the pace of reform under a Zhao-Hu 
Qili leadership would be steadier, although slow-
er, and more internationalist in perspective.

? Hidebound and Conservative. A regime domi-
nated by party elders would probably be a 
temporal phenomenon. If determined to override 
many of the views of younger reformist leaders, 
we believe they would not reverse, but rather 
would limit the pace and scope of the reforms. 
We would expect such a regime to pay exagger-
ated attention to such traditional concerns of the 
party as social control, official work style, ideo-
logical orthodoxy, and perhaps socialist interna-
tionalism. In foreign policy, conservatives may 
see more openings for warmer relations with the 
Soviets but would perhaps be more nativist in 
basic orientation than even Hu Yaobang. 
Implications for the United States 
62. Can the United States Influence Succession 
Outcomes? Even in the years that preceded the 
warming trend in US-Sino relations, Beijing was sensi-
tive to developments in Washington. Following the 
normalization of diplomatic relations in 1979, foreign 
relations, and Sino-US relations in particular, have 
played a small but significant role in domestic Chinese 
politics. Because a key presupposition of reform has 
been the desirability of Western and Japanese partici-
pation in the Chinese economy, some observers believe 
that the United States can help Deng and his allies 
consolidate the reforms by accommodating Beijing 
whenever possible on economic and political ques-
tions. Washington, in other words, can help Deng 
demonstrate to doubters within the Chinese policy-
making elite that he can "deliver" on foreign policy 
questions. 
63. US influence over succession outcomes, howev-
er, is mostly negative. Stabilized relations between 
Washington and Beijing benefit the reformers only 
modestly. When Deng dies, most leaders probably will 
place foreign relations far down the priority list while 
they tend to more immediate problems. Under these 
circumstances, the United States could probably only 
affect the succession in a negative way, by destabiliz-
ing relations with China. In other words, by taking 
such actions as greater cooperation with Taiwan, 
discriminating against Chinese exports, or restricting 
Chinese access to American technologies, the United 
States could strengthen the conservative, anti-Western 
forces in the leadership. Conversely, although the 
United States conceivably could improve the political 
position of the reform group by behaving more coop-
eratively on Taiwan, trade, and technology, it is more 
likely that any US behavior that can be perceived in 
Beijing as an effort to facilitate a solution to succession 
questions favorable to US interests would injure those 
very interests we seek to advance. This is so because 
the United States would risk laying reformers open to 
the charge of having permitted foreign or even "im-
perialist" interference in China's domestic affairs. 
64. The fact remains, however, that, if policy con-
cerns in general will not be controlling during the 
succession, then foreign policy considerations?short 
of a serious development affecting the strategic envi-
ronment?will at most be marginal. The effect on the 
succession of a serious foreign policy crisis is difficult 
to predict. Under some circumstances, the policymak-
ing elite may regard leadership continuity as the only 
feasible way to meet a potential international chal-
lenge?"don't change horses in the middle of the 
stream." Under different circumstances, it is conceiv-
able that the incumbent leadership may be part of the 
problem and that personnel moves may ease a crisis 
toward resolution. 
65. Succession Outcomes and US Interests. De-
spite the periodic fear of governments' dealing with 
China that Beijing will revert to a more radical, 
ideologically driven foreign policy, we believe there is 
little chance that this will happen. After all, the 
decision to improve relations with the West was made 
by Mao during the Cultural Revolution, and Chinese 
behavior since that time suggests a virtually unani-
mous view within the leadership that strategic calcula-
tions transcend ideology. In our view, Beijing will 
continue to pursue a pragmatic orientation in foreign 
policy regardless of successor regimes. This is not to 
say that successor regimes will similarly appraise 
China's relations with both the USSR and the United 
States. Indeed, Deng is China's most anti-Soviet leader, 
and once he is gone we expect the chances for 
substantially warmer relations with Moscow to in-
crease, perhaps to the point of party-to-party relations 
within the next five years. 
66. It should be recognized that?again, regardless 
of successor regimes?Chinese foreign policy will con-
tinue to have strong ideological and nationalistic con-
tent. The ideological content may impel Beijing to-
ward closer "fraternal" relations with socialist states 
but will otherwise be a benign factor. We believe that 
nationalism is a much more volatile strain in Chinese 
policy deliberation, and successor regimes, especially 
at their outset, are likely to react more quickly to 
perceived slights involving questions of sovereignty or 
national dignity

67. We believe that all possible succession regimes, 
proceeding from strategic calculations, will value con-
tinued good relations with the United States. Successor 
regimes, according to the character of their dominant 
personalities, are likely to differ in the relative weights 
they assign to pragmatic, ideological, and nationalistic 
calculations in foreign policy, and therefore in the way 
they regard their relations with the United States. For 
example, the nationalism of second- and third-echelon 
succession regimes generally is likely to be more 
pronounced than under Deng, who along with many 
of his generational peers has substantially greater 
foreign experience and is far more cosmo olitan than 
most of China's future leaders. 
68. Taiwan will remain the most important poten-
tial obstacle to smooth Sino-US relations. The new 
leadership will have, in our view, three broad options 
to choose from: continuing the current policy of 
overlooking Sino-US differences on Taiwan in the 
interest of other foreign policy objectives; raising the 
priority of national reunification and, within those 
limits, pursuing more vigorously efforts to enlist US 
assistance in bringing Taipei into negotiations; and 
renouncing the policy of peaceful reunification in 
favor of fixing a deadline and undertaking a policy of 
reunification by whatever means necessary. These 
considerations will be complicated by the fact that 
Taiwan, too, will be undergoing a succession period, 
with its attendant political uncertainties possibly 
changing Beijing's perceptions of what is necessary 
and possible. 
69. Over the next five years, however, we estimate 
that China's interests are best served by continuing to 
operate within the confines of peaceful reunification: 
no successor government will coerce or precipitate an 
attack on Taiwan to achieve reunification. Foregoing a 
more belligerent policy is, in our view, a more practi-
cal course for Beijing, and one that preserves for China 
the broadest array of foreign and domestic policy 
options. Moreover, we tend to believe that, over time 
and as the generational transfer of power proceeds, the 
Taiwan issue will lose its immediacy as the symbol to 
the leadership of -the revolution unfulfilled." We do 
not believe, however, that Taiwan will cease to be an 
issue in Sino-US relations: precipitous action in Wash-
ington, Taipei, or Beijing could cause a flareup at any 
time. But, for the period of this Estimate and under 
most successor regimes, Beijing will continue to be 
cooperative if the Taiwan question is appropriately 
finessed. 
70. The heirs to Deng will inherit the regional 
problems that Beijing now confronts, all of which are 
directly related to the condition of Sino-Soviet rela-
tions: eroding relations with North Korea, continued 
hostilities with Vietnam, periodic problems with Ja-
pan; the Soviet military buildup on the northern 
border and in the South China Sea; continued Soviet 
occupation of Afghanistan; and instability in and the 
threat of US military withdrawal from the Philippines. 
It is possible that a successor regime would view the 
problems as interrelated and seek progress across a 
broad front by reaching a new accommodation with 
the Soviets, at the expense of US regional interests: 
? The regional interests of the United States would 
best be served, in our view, by pragmatic, mod-
erate leadership that men like Zhao Ziyang or Hu 
Qili could provide. Zhao has long been one of the 
strongest supporters of closer Sino-US ties in the 
leadership. Hu Qili, although less well known, 
has impressed domestic and foreign observers 
alike as a realistic man who places ideology in a 
practical perspective. Hu's relative youth and 
inexperience would doubtless place him under 
very different pressures from those that now 
operate on Zhao and Hu Yaobang, and he may 
be more prone to the pulls of nationalism, espe-
cially under the influence of remaining party 
elders. A moderate leadership would, in our 
view, be far less inclined to stir up trouble over 
Taiwan or work very hard for close Sino-Soviet 
ties.

? We would expect a regime dominated by Hu 
Yaobang to maintain the general orientation of 
China's foreign policy but to be less steady, 
perhaps more mercurial. A less experienced hand 
in foreign policy, Hu probably would be more 
difficult to deal with than Deng. Hu is, more-
over, poised to play a strong role in foreign policy 
whether or not he is openly acknowledged as 
China's principal leader: his continuing grip on 
the foreign policy apparatus through Minister 
Wu Xueqian and other ministerial appointees 
seems solid in the short term. The product of a 
relatively narrow international perspective with 
strong overtones of -socialist internationalism," 
Hu may see more openings for better relations 
with the Soviets than other reformist leaders. 
? Short of the highly improbable resurgence of 
China's radical left, a conservative leadership 
composed of men like Chen Yun or Yao Yilin is 
the worst succession outcome for US interests in
