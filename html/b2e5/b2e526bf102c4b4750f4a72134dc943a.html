 SCOPE NOTE
 For almost two years the USSR and China have been actively
 probing the possibilities of improving their relations with one another-
 at the very time that the Soviets have continued to develop and
 modernize their already formidable strategic and conventional military
 forces adiacent to China. These negotiating probes are not wholly new;
 they have occurred before. But this time there has been some forward
 movement, at least on secondary issues and political atmospherics. This
 raises several questions for us:
 - In what manner is the relationship between these two powers in
 process of change?
 - How do Soviet consultations with China fit into the USSR's
 broad strategic-military objectives in East Asia?
 - How far are present Sino-Soviet consultations going to carry
 Moscow and Bening?
 - In addition to probable trends, what alternative outcomes are
 possible and what would be their likelihood?
 - And what will be the significance of the Sino-Soviet future for
 US interests?
 This Estimate addresses these questions, examining both the con-
 straints on and incentives for improvement in the Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship. The Estimate also explores the possible effect of certain variables,
 and proposes indicators by which to measure changes in the relation-
 ship. Except where otherwise indicated, the period of the Estimate is
 the next two to three years.
 Because of the complexity of issues discussed in this Estimate, it is
 being published in two versions: for broad readership, the complete text;
 for senior readers, the Key Judgments.

 KEY JUDGMENTS
 The present consultations between the USSR and China are
 unlikely to produce major concessions on the part of either, and the
 many issues that divide them will largely continue. A change in their re-
 lationship is nonetheless taking place.  We believe this process will
 continue during the period-the next two to three years-covered by
 this Estimate.
 As a result largely of Soviet initiative and of an increased Chinese
 /    retains expansionist ambitions, and that Moscow's long-term
 `~/    desire to expand Soviet presence and influence around China's
 periphery is aimed directly at isolating China and diminishing
 its influence in Asia.
 responsiveness, Moscow and Bening have reached numerous agreements
 over the past year or so on relatively minor economic and cultural
 questions. But the change taking place in their relationship does not so
 much involve their basic positions or any "moving closer" to one
 another, as it does a moderating of the intensity of conflict. These two
 powers will almost certainly  remain  suspicious,  wary  antagonists,
 continuing to arm against each other and to criticize each other's aims
 and conduct-but within a less hostile climate.
 Many issues will continue to divide China and the USSR-and
 will continue to prevent either from making major concessions to the
 other. The principal such forces:
 - On both sides, historical enmity, suspicions, ideological preten-
 sions, and racist attitudes toward each other.
 - The sensitivity of the Sino-Soviet issue in the inner politics of
 both Bening and Moscow-with the consequent need for their
 leaders not to become vulnerable to charges of betraying vital
 national interests to the other power.
 - Chinese concerns about Soviet power over the coming decades;
 Soviet concerns about potential Chinese power over the coming
 century.
 - On the part of China, Beijing's continuing belief that the USSR
 - The desire of China that the USSR make concessions on three
 major  issues: that is, that the USSR significantly reduce its

 military power (nuclear and nonnuclear) in the eastern USSR
 and Mongolia, cease its support for Vietnam's occupation of
 !/   Kampuchea, and withdraw its combat troops f rom Afghanistan.
 - In the absence of  any  maior  Soviet concessions on these
 questions, Chinese reluctance to come to terms with Moscow on
 the Sino-Soviet border dispute.
 - Beijing's bitter experience with the high costs of close association
 with Moscow: remembrance of unacceptable past Soviet efforts
 to subvert the politics and armed forces of China and to
 subordinate China's national interests to those of the Soviet
 Union.
 - The fact that China's boss, Deng Xiaoping, was himself one of
 the foremost anti-Soviet officials indentif ied with the split of
 these two Communist powers, a generation ago, into rival Third
 Romes.
 - On the part of the USSR, a bedrock, absolute refusal on the
 part of Soviet leaders to halt Moscow's continuing buildup of
 military power adjacent to China, or to give up or markedly
 lessen the great military superiority the USSR enjoys over
 China.
 - Moscow's reluctance to yield the geopolitical advantages it
 ,currently derives from its ties with Vietnam, especially the
 .% ~ forward deployment of ships and aircraft, and the barrier these
 developments constitute to Chinese influence in Southeast Asia.
 - The f act that the buildup of Soviet military power in Asia serves
 ,many strategic and political purposes beyond those relating
 ~  directly to China, and is but a portion of the Soviet global
 strategic buildup.
 - Soviet unwillingness to make the major concessions demanded
 by Bening unless China significantly reduces its relationships
 with the United States or moves to settle the border dispute.
 At the same time, certain other forces will tend to support a
 reduction of the intensity of Sino-Soviet hostility. The principal such
 forces:
 Overall, the numerous changes in time, situation, and personal-
 ity that have occurred since the Sino-Soviet split of a generation
 ago-which render extreme hostility between Moscow and
 Bening somewhat of an outmoded phenomenon, the product of
 certain circumstances of the time that now have less relevance.

 -The mere fact of reaching agreement on at least some (second-
 ary) issues in itself creates an environment for momentum and
 the possibility of further agreements.
 - On the Soviet side, as Moscow's leaders perceive increasing
 strategic challenge from more forceful US policies and future
 US weapon systems and deployments, a strong wish on their
 part to lessen the possibility that Sino-Soviet hostilities might
 greatly complicate the USSR's basic security interests or its
 overall strategic objectives.
 - A basic desire to reduce the danger of a two-front war.
 - A strong desire to prevent close cooperation between China and
 the United States (and Japan), and to that end to take advantage
 of known dissatisfactions on the part of Bening with its Ameri-
 can connection.
 - A desire to enhance the security of the USSR's eastern borders
 by means additional to military power.
 - Concern about what the long-term political implications would
 be for China's economic modernization programs if outside
 assistance to those programs were to come only from the United
 States and the West.
 - A sense in Moscow that the danger of Chinese adventurist
 actions against the Soviet Union-one of the original reasons for
 the beginnings of the Soviet military buildup, years ago, on the
 Sino-Soviet border-has greatly diminished.
 - The opportunity to take advantage of the more businesslike
 attitudes and procedures that have come to mark Chinese
 politics and society since the death of Mao Zedong, in the
 process lessening some of the emotional content that Mao and
 Nikita  Khrushchev  personally  contributed  to  Sino-Soviet
 estrangement.
 - On the Chinese side, Deng Xiaoping and his associates have
 determined that (a) China's greatest problems are those it faces
 as a vast, poor LDC; (b) the process of national development in
 China will be so difficult that it will need a prolonged period of
 respite from outside pressures; (c) to these ends a reordering of
 China's foreign policies is needed, one that reduces the level of
 tension with the USSR; and (d) such a reordering would not
 seriously risk jeopardizing the continuance either of strong US-
 led opposition to Soviet expansion in the world, or of US and
 Western willingness to continue cooperating economically with
 China.

 Associated with those decisions, almost certainly low expecta-
 tions on the part of Beijing's leaders that the United States
 would come to Beijing's aid in the event of a Soviet attack on
 China.
 China's discovery during its invasion of Vietnam in 1979 that it
 faced a formidable military antagonist on its southern border,
 and Beijing's consequent desire to reduce the pressures on China
 resulting from its two-front confrontation with the USSR and
 Vietnam.
 - Views on the part of China's leaders that a modest improvement
 of relations with the USSR serves to increase Beijing's leverage
 on Washington.
 - A desire to diversify further the foreign sources of input into
 China's modernization, and to take advantage of certain bene-
 f its that would derive f rom expanded economic and technologi-
 cal ties with the USSR.
 - A view on the part of Deng and his fellow pragmatists that less
 hostile relationships with the USSR will also signal that, in
 accepting some US economic and military assistance, Bening
 does not intend to embrace the United States too closely or
 completely ref use all assistance from the USSR.
 It should be stressed that present Sino-Soviet talks are taking
 place against the background of a continuing substantial augmenta-
 tion of Soviet military strength adjacent to China-which has contin-
 ued during the Sino-Soviet consultations of the past two years. Roughly
 one-fourth of all Soviet ground force personnel are now stationed
 opposite China, together with more than 2,000 Soviet aircraft, over
 100,000 air personnel, greatly enhanced naval strength, a rapidly
 expanding SS-20 force, and considerable additional nuclear weapons
 carriers in the form of Backfire and Badger bombers, SLBMs, and
 ICBMs. The great majority of the USSR's nuclear weapons targeted
 against East Asia will continue to be devoted to Chinese targets. And, a
 principal net result of the buildup will be certain continuing marked
 asymmetries in Soviet and Chinese military forces: the Chinese seriously
 lagging, qualitatively, in modern arms; Soviet ground and air forces
 generally positioned fairly close to China's borders, C ih n  e forces
 deployed deeply behind those borders.
 Moscow's leaders see their military augmentation as insurance
 against Chinese military provocations along the border, and against the
 prospect of a significantly enhanced Chinese nuclear threat to the USSR

 over the long term. They almost certainly also consider that their forces
 will continue to serve meanwhile as a deterrent to China from invading
 Vietnam once again, or from otherwise effectively challenging Soviet
 interests in Indochina. And, these forces will strengthen Moscow's
 negotiating hand vis-a-vis the Chinese.
 This ongoing Soviet augmentation will at the same time continue
 to stem from many causes beyond those directly relating to China and
 will continue to serve many broader Soviet interests. That is, the
 augmentation of forces in the East also reflects the USSR's plans to
 upgrade all of its forces, everywhere; its desire to strengthen its
 capability to fight atwo-front war, in Europe and Asia; the felt need to
 compensate for dependence on a very long, vulnerable railroad to
 reinforce and resupply the isolated Soviet Far East; the traditional
 Soviet practice of overinsuring, of massing more military strength than
 outside observers might think necessary; the Soviet effort to use the
 military buildup as an instrument for political intimidation and further
 expansion of influence in East Asia; and a desire to reinforce Soviet se-
 curity against the perspective of much-enhanced Western military
 capabilities in the Pacific.
 It should also be stressed that the Sino-Soviet future is not just a
 bilateral matter, but will develop within the dynamic of triangular
 relationships with the United States. This dynamic will be a crucially
 important factor affecting the behavior of Moscow and Bening toward
 the other. Each leadership will remain highly sensitive to its perceptions
 of the US relationship with the rival Communist power, and especially
 to any development that either power might consider to represent a
 major discontinuity in US orientation or strategic priorities.
 What developments appear most likely in the Sino-Soviet rela-
 tionship over the next two years or so?
 -Chances favor continuance of the process of markedly increas-
 .-   ing trade relations and reaching agreements on other secondary
 issues of economic and technological ties, cultural interchanges,
 and the like, amidst continuing reflections of a more business-
 like, less intensely hostile overall atmosphere. This may proceed
 to the point of including agreement on certain conf idence-
 building measures ICBMs) such as mutual notification of troop
 exercises.
 - The~wo sides will upgrade the level of negotiating representa-
 tion~. The Soviets will continue to press for broader ties with
 Bening, in the belief that agreement on enough small steps will
 lay a path for progress on major issues. The Soviets will also seek

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 to institutionalize the negotiating process. The Chinese will
 probably continue to draw the line well short of the most f ar-
 reaching Soviet proposals in the absence of major Soviet military
 concessions.
 - While continuing to emphasize its maximum demands for large-
 scale Soviet force reductions in the Soviet Far East, Bening
 would welcome even small concessions from the Soviets in their
 force deployments against China. The Chinese would particu-
 larly welcome Soviet troop withdrawals from Mongolia.
 - For their part, the Soviets will continue their force improve-
 ments in the East. And, the Soviets will probably not make more
 than token gestures to China over the next two to three years.
 - Moscow will almost certainly continue to withhold major
 concessions regarding its forces along China's border and in
 Mongolia until Bening has made more fundamental concessions
 than it has yet been willing to consider. There is nonetheless a
 modest chance that the Soviets will make a token pullback of
 perhaps a division or so from Mongolia during the next two to
 three years. This would not constitute a material change of
 much consequence, but could represent a symbolic concession
 of some magnitude that might induce the Chinese to reciprocate
 in some way-and thus perhaps encourage Moscow to make
 further concessions.
 - Even if there were a token Soviet military pullback from
 Mongolia, however, we doubt that the Chinese would make
 major concessions on the issues of greatest concern to Moscow-
 particularly the border dispute-until Soviet force withdrawals
 had gone well beyond the token stage.
 - Nor is the USSR likely to give up its control over the regime in
 Afghanistan, to abandon support for Vietnam's war effort in
 Kampuchea, or to surrender its military privileges at Cam Ranh
 Bay in  Vietnam-where since late  1983 the Soviets have
 deployed Badger bombers.
 Contingent developments that could upset the above-estimated
 course of Sino-Soviet relations:
 - Major escalation of Vietnamese war efforts in Kampuchea or

 -Vietnamese clashes with China, either along the border or in the
 South China Sea.
 - The adoption of major new policies on the part of post-Deng or
 post-Chernenko leaderships.
 - A Japanese move toward major rearmament.
 Possible alternative outcomes:
 - There is an off chance that during the period of this Estimate
 the Sino-Soviet relationship could take on a much more hostile
 character than the Estimate holds probable:
 - This could occur because so many variables are present, many
 of them not f ully within the control of the present leaderships
 in either Moscow or Beijing: the advent of new policies on the
 part of post-Deng or post-Chernenko leadership, initiatives
 taken by other governments (in Korea or Vietnam, for exam-
 ple), and so on.
 - It does not follow that US interests would necessarily benefit
 from the coming of a much more frigid Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship. The effect on US interests would depend on the nature
 and intensity of  the estrangement between Moscow and
 Beijing: up to a point, US interests would clearly benefit from
 probable increases in Chinese cooperation against Soviet poli-
 cies in the world, in Chinese receptiveness to US advice and
 counsel, and-possibly-in willingness to permit expanded
 levels of Western economic and technological presence within
 China. But, if Sino-Soviet relations deteriorated to the point of
 actual or threatened large-scale hostilities, US diplomatic and
 security policymaking could be greatly complicated.
 - Conversely, there is also an outside chance-though less likely
 than the above-that the Sino-Soviet relationship could become
 a much closer one during the period of this Estimate than we
 now judge likely:
 - This might come to pass if no great disruptive contingencies
 should occur; if the Chinese should back away in practice-
 though not in principle-from certain of  their key "de-
 mands"; if agreements reached on a number of secondary
 issues should begin to create a somewhat greater momentum
 toward Sino-Soviet rapprochement; or if  for some reason
 Beijing's leaders should come to depreciate the value of
 China's relationships with the United States.

 DISCUSSION
 The Wary Thaw
 1. Since the Intelligence Community last addressed
 the subiect of Sino-Soviet relations,' the USSR and
 China have begun to moderate the level of hostility
 between them. Evidence indicates that theirs is still,
 fundamentally, a hostile and distrustful relationship,
 and that the most important of the factors that have
 preserved this animosity for more than two decades
 will probably remain substantially unchanged over the
 next two to three years. Incremental improvements
 have occurred in secondary aspects of the relationship,
 and these will probably continue and grow in impor-
 tance over time. These improvements will probably
 continue to have only a modest effect on the central
 issues that divide the two powers-barring certain
 developments discussed below.
 2. Over the last three years, and particularly since
 the fall of 1982, important changes have occurred in
 the atmosphere of bilateral Sino-Soviet dealings. Po-
 lemics have been significantly reduced, particularly on
 the Soviet side. Exchanges of technical, sports, and
 cultural delegations have increased. Student exchanges
 have also been reinstituted for the first time in many
 years, although on a very small scale-and in no way
 even faintly approaching China's present student ex-
 changes with the West.2 Sino-Soviet dealings on river
 navigation matters have become more cooperative,
 Mutual trade was doubled in 1983, to a target figure of
 some $800 million, the highest level since the early
 1960s (see figure 1), and the 1984 trade protocol calls
 for total trade to increase to some $1.2 billion.3 Also,
 local trade crossing points have been opened in the
 northeastern and northwestern sectors of the Sino-
 Soviet border, for the first time since the early 1960s.
 The Soviets have proposed and the Chinese have in
 principle accepted Soviet assistance in the moderniza-
 tion over the next few years of two to four of the
 ' NIE 11/13-80, Sino-Soviet Relations in the Early 1980s (s xa
 nrc), 5 June 1980.
 There were 100 Chinese students in the USSR in 1984, as
 compared with some 14,000 in the West.
 s The increased deliveries of timber, fertilizers, and ferrous and
 nonferrous metals by the Soviet Union have accounted for much of
 its increased  exports,  with  sales  of  machinery  and  equipment
 playing a less important role than in the past. The Chinese are
 supplying the Soviets increased quantities of food products, textiles,
 and other manufactured consumer goods.

 industrial plants built by the Chinese with Soviet help
 in the 1950s. And two sets of semiannual consultations
 at the deputy-foreign-minister level have been institut-
 ed to maintain channels of contact on both contentious
 and noncontentious issues. It is noteworthy that the
 scope of many of these developments has tended to
 broaden  over  time,  implying  that  the  process of
 change has some momentum.
 3. At the same time, an intense conflict of interest
 in Asia persists between these two Communist powers.
 This conflict has many sources, including racial antag-
 onism, historical grievances, terr-itorial aspirations, the
 difference in military potential, the heritage of past
 border hostilities, the great contrast in population
 density, Chinese memories of past Soviet heavyhand-
 edness, ideological pretensions, and the rivalry for
 political advantage in states around the periphery of
 China and,  more generally,  in the Third  World.
 Fundamentally, the Soviet Union seeks to constrain
 the growth of China's geopolitical weight in Asia, and
 continues to regard Chinese ambitions as incompatible

 Objectives:
 ? Moscow's leaders hope that these consultations will
 help ensure the security of the USSR's eastern
 borders, undermine Sino-US and Sino-Japanese re-
 lations-particularly with respect to any strategic
 discussions, and moderate Chinese hostility.
 ? Beijing's leaders hope that the consultations will
 help China to manage the Soviet threat, so that a
 prolonged period of reduced tensions can facilitate
 China's progress toward modernization.
 ? Reduce border tension and the risk of armed
 clashes.
 ? Gain leverage in its respective dealings with the
 United States.
 ? Increase trade; resume technical assistance.
 ? Increase cultural, educational, and other exchanges.
 ? Without having to make major concessions, gain
 leverage for ultimate substantial gains at the other's
 expense.
 ? Negotiate long-term trade agreement, agreements
 on exchanges, etc.
 ? Achieve understanding on some bilateral security
 issues.
 ??-Resume party-to-party relations if possible.
 The Chinese tactic is to:
 ? Maintain a calculated distance from the USSR,
 even while benefiting from various improvements
 in relations.
 ? Focus from the outset on major strategic concerns,
 even if there is no hope of agreement in the
 foreseeable future.
 ? Identify areas of Soviet policy that can symbolize
 the Soviet strategic threat in a way that will gain
 support for China in the Third World, among Asian
 countries, and in the West.
 The Chinese therefore want to:
 ? Go slow on for   a?rJ   ents   ut without block-
 ing progress on practical issues.
 The Soviet tactic is to:
 ? Dramatize small steps toward improved relations.
 ? Defer the more difficult strategic issues.

 with its own security and goals. The Chinese, for their
 part, view their present dealings with Moscow against
 the background of a long-term buildup of forces in the
 Soviet Far East since the start of the Brezhnev regime,
 and of an ongoing Soviet effort to corisolidate geopolit-
 ical advances  in  Afghanistan and  Indochina.  The
 Chinese interpret the Soviet buildup as intended to
 intimidate China and Japan, to facilitate the Soviet
 struggle to advance Soviet presence and influence
 around  China's  periphery,  to  assist  in  the  Soviet
 worldwide geopolitical contest with the United States,
 and to offset the growth of US military strength in the
 western Pacific and the improvement of US military
 cooperation with Japan. Thus, over the last few years
 China has taken the position that Soviet force deploy-
 ments along China's borders, Soviet moves in Indo-
 china, and Soviet actions in Afghanistan are three key
 issues where there must be some movement on Mos-

 cow's part before substantial Sino-Soviet rapproche-
 ment can take place.
 4. In the last year, as bilateral contacts have ex-
 panded, each side has received confirmation that it
 should not anticipate early progress toward major
 concessions. Beijing has found that the prospect of
 increased trade and contacts has not caused the Soviet
 Union to reduce its threat to Chinese security or to
 alter those policies that undermine China's interests
 around its periphery. Moscow has found that, in the
 absence of what it considers radical and unpalatable
 Soviet concessions to China, Beijing will not abandon
 the use of important ties with the United States to
 contest Soviet policy and to reinforce China's security.
 Although both sides apparently regard the improve-
 ments registered thus far as useful, almost certainly
 neither state is reconciled to failure to move the other

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 thus far on the issues of greater concern. Each may
 retain residual hopes that the further development of
 the process of amelioration will eventually bring it the
 concessions it seeks, without surrendering the conces-
 sions the opponent demands.
 The Soviet Perspective
 5. The attitude of Soviet leaders toward China is,
 one of arm's-length encouragement. Moscow is clearly
 gratified at the recent improvements in the bilateral
 atmosphere and the trend toward expansion of Sino-
 Soviet intercourse. The Soviets initiated this current
 process in mid-1982 through a series, of public over-
 tures, acting partly in response to Perception of a new
 opening created by the emergence of heightened Sino-
 US friction in 1981, as well as in response to setbacks
 Soviet fortunes had experienced vis-a-vis the West-
 the derailing of the SALT II agreement, NATO's two-
 track decision on intermediate-range nuclear forces
 (INF), and sharply adverse world reactions to the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. As in previous occa-
 sions of Sino-Soviet diplomatic explorations, dating
 back to 1970, the Soviets have consistently sought to
 broaden the scope of bilateral dealings as far as the
 Chinese will permit, seeking both to create the prereq-
 uisites for the restoration of some Soviet influence in
 China and to encourage  Beijing to distance itself
 further from the United States. Evidence indicates
 that Soviet leaders thus hope to erode the Sino-US
 relationship or at least reestablish a more balanced
 Sino-Soviet-US triangular relationship, and to render
 more remote the contingency of Soviet involvement in
 a two-front war.
 6. There is some indication that there have been
 differing views within the Soviet foreign policy estab-
 lishment in recent years, however, over the advisabil-
 ity of initiating the kind of overtures Moscow began
 making to Beijing in 1982-but it is not clear how
 significant any such differences have been. Because all
 the USSR's recent proposals to China are long-estab-
 lished themes of Soviet policy that evade Beiiing's
 requests for major military concessions, however, they
 probably are not objects of  major controversy in
 Moscow. But, should the Soviet leadership ever come
 to weigh seriously the advisability of some concessions
 to China on Soviet troop dispositions, the degree of
 controversy would probably rise sharply.
 7. For the moment, we believe that there is proba-
 bly considerable satisfaction in Moscow that the bilat-
 eral movement seen so far is a useful Soviet achieve-
 ment registered at little cost, the first fruit of more
 than 20 years of sporadic efforts to secure Chinese
 consent to some improvement in  the relationship
 without major Soviet concessions in advance. Soviet
 leaders doubtless regard Chinese modification of pre-
 vious attitudes as itself  a unilateral tacit Chinese
 concession.
 8. Because no significant Soviet concessions are yet
 involved, continuation of the strategy now being pur-
 sued toward China to attempt to change Chinese
 policy is generally approved in the Soviet leadership.
 There appears to be solid support in the Soviet elite for
 further efforts to expand trade and contacts along
 present lines, along with renewed attempts to persuade
 the Chinese to accept bilateral improvements in areas
 where they remain recalcitrant,  particularly their
 consent to top-level meetings. The Soviets will surely
 continue to press them hard for further substantive
 and symbolic movement, across the spectrum of bilat-
 eral relations, in order to bring the level of Sino-Soviet
 dealings closer to that existing between the United
 States and China. Moscow and Beijing have agreed to
 double the level of their trade, and evidence indicates
 that Moscow would like to be able to raise the turnover
 still further. Acutely conscious of the acceleration of
 Sino-American mutual ministerial visits in 1983 and
 the scheduling of a new Presidential visit to China in
 April 1984, the Soviets chafe at the restrictions Beijing
 continues to impose on their own reciprocal diplomat-
 ic exchanges with China, and seek to upgrade the level
 of contact. The Soviets would probably like to secure a
 restoration of bilateral party-to-party contacts severed
 by Beijing in 1966-particularly since they constitute
 an aspect of the relationship that the United States of
 necessity could not match.
 9. In .addition, there is likely to be wide support in
 Soviet decisionmaking circles for concrete efforts to
 appeal to Chinese concerns that seem to run counter to
 US policy. One leading example is Chinese anxiety
 about the possibility of a revival of Japanese milita-
 rism. The Soviets have already made efforts to use this
 issue (unsuccessfully to date) as a vehicle with which to
 elicit  Sino-Soviet  political  cooperation  against  the
 United States, and they will almost certainly repeat
 such efforts in the future.
 10. At the same time, however, available evidence
 indicates  that  Soviet  leaders  regard  the  progress
 reached in Sino-Soviet talks to date as superficial. And,
 although the Soviets welcome Chinese criticisms of the
 United States and China's abandonment of calls for a
 "world united front" against the Soviet Union, author-
 itative Soviet spokesmen have made it clear that they

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 see Chinese policy as still fundamentally hostile to
 Soviet goals, and as aligned with the United States
 against the USSR in most important respects.
 11. Furthermore, the question of how to deal with
 China is clearly a sensitive issue in Moscow. The
 available evidence suggests that two currents of opin-
 ion on this matter exist in the Soviet foreign policy
 establishment. One, which appears to be much the
 weaker of the two, seems to favor more active Soviet
 steps to conciliate China, possibly including some
 concessions regarding troop dispositions on the border.
 (See figures 2 and 3 and the appended map.) Those
 who lean to this position evidently argue that only
 through such concessions can the Soviet Union extract
 maior dividends from favorable tendencies in Beiiing.
 Certain of the USSR's academic specialists on China
 take such a position. These figures have drawn encour-
 agement from the increased Chinese civility in bilater-
 al dealings, from the disappearance of Chinese ideo-
 logical charges against the Soviet Union, from the
 similarities between the Chinese and Soviet social
 systems and state structures, and~from the resentment
 shown by some Chinese leaders over what they regard
 as the subversive effect of Western influence. Such
 trends, these figures argue, bode well for future trends
 in Chinese foreign policy.
 12. Such thought, however, appears to be considera-
 bly outweighed by dominant forces in the Soviet

 leadership that are strongly suspicious of Beijing's
 intention, particularly while Deng Xiaoping remains
 China's boss. These views seem particularly strong in
 the Central Committee apparatus and among the
 Soviet military. These harder-line figures probably
 believe that recent Chinese conciliatory behavior to-
 ward the USSR has been driven in large part by a
 desire to exert pressure on the United States for
 bilateral concessions within an overall framework of
 continued opposition to Soviet policy by both powers.
 Those Soviet officials are apparently vividly aware of
 the extent to which the USSR's interests and ambitions
 clash with China's in Asia, and of the fact that the
 United States and China continue to work in parallel
 to contest Soviet policies in Indochina and Afghani-
 stan. They have remarked that recent Chinese invita-
 tions to the US Secretary of State, the Secretary of
 Defense, and the President to visit China are further
 confirmation of these attitudes. These Soviet skeptics
 apparently interpret these Chinese invitations as evi-
 dence of the strength of Beijing's long-term interest in
 acquisition of American industrial technology relevant
 to China's defense against the Soviet Union. They
 almost certainly doubt that the Chinese can be in-
 duced to abandon this relationship with the United
 States merely as a result of improvements in China's
 trade and contacts with the USSR, although they
 apparently see no harm in attempting to do so.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 13. Although these tough attitudes do not exclude
 all Soviet concessions to China during the period of
 this Estimate, they suggest that any such concessions
 are likely to be largely token or atmospheric in nature,
 in the absence of  major changes in the Chinese
 position or a generational turnover in  the Soviet
 leadership that might bring a different set of attitudes
 to the fore.'  Representatives of  all tendencies in
 Moscow, however, doubtless hope that internal politi-
 cal factors in China or the United States may eventual-
 ly cause a multiplication of Sino-American frictions
 that will in turn produce major changes in China's
 posture toward both superpowers. And there clearly
 appears to be general agreement in the Soviet leader-
 ship that the USSR has a vested interest in limiting
 Sino-US cooperation and, if possible, in encouraging a
 deterioration of Washington-Beijing relations.
 14. For the moment, the passing of Andropov and
 the advent of Chernenko do provide Moscow with an
 opportunity to make another effort to advance the
 Sino-Soviet dialogue. There have already been a few
 such signs from the Soviet side-for example, hints of
 a more forthcoming stand on the question of China's
 "socialist" nature. But Chernenko has bluntly reiterat-
 ed Moscow's refusal to budge on the basic issues in
 dispute: Afghanistan, Indochina, Soviet force strength
 adiacent to China. The early emphasis of the new
 Soviet leadership has been on continuity in policy, and
 there has been no sign that Chernenko has made
 improved relations with China a top priority. Further-
 more, the continued prominence of Foreign Minister
 Gromyko and Defense Minister Ustinov suggests that
 Moscow will make few, if any, major departures on
 foreign policy issues at the outset under Chernenko.
 His leadership is likely to stick with the present course
 of "small steps" toward a normalization of relations
 with China.
 The Chinese Perspective
 15. Although the initiative for the recent bilateral
 improvements has come from the Soviet Union, the
 important shifts in policy required to allow any im-
 provements to begin have come from  China.  As
 already noted, most of those measures that have now
 been put into effect had for many years been periodi-
 ^t~sed_by Moscow and re'ected by Beijing.
 Indeed, a continuing centralsue for the future is that
 many important proposals long on the Soviet list-
 such as requests for summit meetings and restoration
 of party contacts-still have not been accepted by
 China.
 ' These matters are discussed in greater detail in the section
 beginning at paragraph 27.
 16. The degree of movement that has occurred in
 Sino-Soviet bilateral relations has resulted in part from
 gradual changes in the thinking of Chinese leaders
 about how much improvement in these dealings is
 compatible with China's defense of its geopolitical
 interests against the Soviet Union. This evolution in
 Chinese attitudes began in 1979, was halted by the
 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but has resumed again
 since 1981. We believe that this pattern of sporadic
 starting and stopping in Chinese policy toward deal-
 ings with the Soviet Union has been influenced not
 only by security and foreign policy considerations, but
 also by the interplay of differing opinions within the
 Chinese leadership. Such differences from time to
 time seem to have affected Chinese tactics toward
 both the Soviet Union and the United States.
 17. The most recent modifications in Chinese calcu-
 lations about the Soviet Union have emerged as part of
 a broader pattern of changes in the Chinese posture
 toward the world, carried out incrementally over the
 last three years, aimed at cultivating a more independ-
 ent image on the international scene. While retaining
 a considerable degree of cooperation with Washington
 against Moscow, Beijing has thus sought to blur the
 impression created in the late 1970s of a China almost
 totally identified with the United States in polar
 opposition to the Soviet Union. To this end, China has
 repudiated the notion of a strategic alliance with the
 United States, has abandoned earlier calls fora "world
 united front" against the Soviet Union, and has some-
 what contracted the scope of its criticism of the USSR.
 18. The Chinese have evidently decided to make
 these changes in their general posture for a mixture of
 reasons.  Certain of  these shifts were reflected in
 China's exploratory talks with Moscow in 1979. Beijing
 was later influenced to increase somewhat its distance
 from America in 1981 and 1982 because the rise of
 bilateral difficulties tended to strengthen longstanding
 skepticism in Beijing about the willingness of the US
 government and public to take risks for China in the
 event of  a Chinese crisis with  the Soviet  Union.
 Beijing's leaders were apparently also interested in
 using the process of Sino-Soviet amelioration as an
 instrument of leverage on the United States, particu-
 larly in the two most important areas of Sino-Ameri-
 can friction: the US relationship with Taiwan, and US
 olicy regarding the transfer of advanced industrial
 echnology to China.  Simultaneously,  the  Chinese
 apparently hoped that the resulting shifts in relations
 with the United States would create a more appropri-
 ?   ate  backdrop  for  Chinese  efforts  to  elicit  Soviet
 concessions.

 19. Evidence indicates that Beiiing's leaders found
 China's partial disassociation from the United States
 convenient in other respects. It enabled China to
 separate itself from identification with those US poli-
 cies in the Third World that Beiiing disapproves. It
 also made it somewhat easier for Beiiing to court
 political actors hostile to the United States but impor-
 tant for Chinese interests, and to strive to avoid
 isolation from important sections of Western public
 opinion opposed to certain specific American policies.
 20. At the same time, however, China has been
 reminded by Soviet intransigence that, whatever the
 uncertainties in the Sino-US relationship, this relation-
 ship provides China a welcome margin of security.
 Because Beiiing has continued to perceive a Soviet
 threat to Chinese security and undiminished Soviet
 opposition to Chinese interests in Asia, it has also had
 an ongoing reason to find a way to compromise
 differences with  Washington.  China has therefore
 sought not to eliminate its strategic cooperation with
 the United States against the USSR, but rather to
 redefine that cooperation in terms that preserve its
 advantages for China while giving Bening greater
 flexibility and leverage in dealing with both powers.
 21. In both 1979 and 1982 China opened talks with
 the USSR after a maior step in relations with the
 United States had assured it that ties with Washington
 had been consolidated-in 1979 the visit of then Vice
 President Mondale, and in 1982 the conclusion of the
 17 August communique on arms sales to Taiwan. It is
 likely that the Chinese leaders felt that these actions,
 which stabilized relations with the United States, were
 important prerequisites for the talks that were opened
 with the USSR shortly thereafter.
 22.  Despite the improvement that has taken place
 in the atmosphere of Sino-US relations over the past
 year, we believe that China will continue to disavow
 any intention to loin Washington in a formal strategic
 relationship. Also, the Chinese will continue to soft-
 pedal attacks on Soviet policies in some areas of the
 world, and will continue to criticize US policies on
 occasion. And, additional new areas of Chinese dis-
 agreement with the United States could emerge. But
 Beiiing's leaders will also continue to hold on to the
 relationship with the United States as important to
 China's security and economic development, and as
 the essential underpinning for their exploratory deal-
 ings with Moscow.
 23. The Chinese have a number of associated rea-
 sons for lessening the level of tensions with the USSR:
 - A desire to reduce tensions and  relieve the
 pressure on China resulting from its two-front
 confrontation with the USSR and Vietnam.
 - A desire to put pressure on Vietnam. Beiiing is
 well aware of Hanoi's discomfiture over Sino-
 Soviet contacts and negotiations, and of  Viet-
 nam's obvious anxiety at the possibility of Soviet
 betrayal of Vietnam's interests to appease China.
 However remote China's leaders consider the
 likelihood of such a turn in Soviet policy, they
 welcome the difficulties the issue has created for
 Vietnam, and they doubtless hope fora conse-
 quent exacerbation of  Soviet-Vietnamese fric-
 tions.
 -The desire to build a calmer strategic environ-
 ment that will provide a margin of safety for
 Chinese economic priorities, for despite China's
 military weaknesses its leaders are determined to
 maintain a measured pace of military modern-
 ization and to avoid hasty diversion of badly
 needed resources from the civilian economy to
 the military sector.
 - A desire to further diversify the foreign sources
 of input into China's modernization. Beiiing is
 not likely to cease relying primarily upon the
 capitalist industrialized world for such inputs,
 despite Soviet hopes to change this priority. But
 Deng and his associates have apparently come to
 believe that expanded imports and a limited use
 of expertise from the Soviet Union and Eastern
 Europe can play a useful supplementary role in
 modernization. This view has apparently been
 reinforced by the difficulties China has some-
 times  experienced  in  assimilating  advanced
 Western or Japanese technology. Evidence indi-
 cates the Chinese have come to believe that some
 less advanced but easier to assimilate Soviet
 middle-level technology should be given a some-
 what larger role in modernization, and particu-
 larly in reequipping some of the industrial plants
 built with Soviet help in the 1950s. Evidence also
 indicates that Beiiing's leaders remember past
 Soviet  efforts  to  exploit  Chinese  economic
 dependence for political purposes; they are high-
 ly unlikely to allow themselves to be put in such
 a position of dependence again. We believe that
 with this consideration in mind they will place
 sharp limits on the number and activities of
 Soviet technical experts used in China to help in
 plant modernization.
 - A belief on the part of Beiiing's leaders that
 China can make good use of expanded raw
 material imports from the Soviet Union, and that
 the USSR furnishes a convenient outlet for tex-
 tiles and other Chinese light industrial products
 that are surplus to Chinese export markets else-

 where. China's leaders also apparently find con-
 venient the fact that barter trade with the Soviet
 Union conserves hard currency.
 - A Chinese desire to reestablish a political pres-
 ence in the East European states and to expand
 useful economic relations with them, a process
 that will be furthered by a context of Chinese
 improvements with Moscow.
 - A Chinese hope-if not the expectation-that
 Beijing may eventually obtain major concessions
 from Moscow that would reduce Soviet geopoliti-
 cal pressure around China's periphery.
 24. Available evidence indicates that, after two
 years of consultations with Moscow, China retains
 little expectation of receiving meaningful concessions
 regarding Indochina or Afghanistan for the foreseeable
 future. On the other hand, Chinese behavior suggests
 that some elements in Beijing's leadership may still
 retain hopes that concessions can eventually be ob-
 tained regarding the Soviet force posture to China's
 north.  Such Chinese views have apparently been
 encouraged by hints advanced by the Soviet Union
 implying the possibility of eventual unspecified con-
 cessions regarding military deployments. The Chinese
 may also harbor hopes of obtaining such gains because
 they perceive the Soviet Union as heavily burdened by
 its economic difficulties, its military commitments in
 Afghanistan and Europe, and heightened Soviet com-
 petition with the United States. Finally, the Chinese
 may have been led to hope that the tougher US
 posture toward Moscow in recent years would enhance
 Beijing's leverage over the USSR, and therefore pro-
 duce Soviet concessions.
 25. Despite all their reasons to expand bilateral
 dealings with the USSR, however, the Chinese have
 powerful reasons to maintain limits on their dealings
 with the USSR:
 - Perhaps most important, the need to avoid creat-
 ing the impression in the USSR that the Chinese
 leadership is permanently reconciled to the status
 quo in East Asia, and is willing to accept the
 Soviet presence in Southeast Asia and a continu-
 ing Soviet force buildup in East Asia as compati-
 ble with good relations.
 -Chinese care not to go so far in improving
 relations with Moscow that this might jeopardize
 the gains China receives from its existing rela-
 tionships with the United States and other non-
 communist states. China's leaders wish to be able
 to imply to Moscow-as a prod for concessions
 and a disincentive to more forceful  policies
 toward China-that they retain the option to
 greatly strengthen security cooperation with the
 United States; and they also strongly desire to
 maintain US acquiescence in the flow of industri-
 al technology to China from the United States,
 Japan, and Western Europe, and to enlarge that
 flow into more sophisticated and sensitive areas.
 Evidence indicates that Chinese leaders also wish
 to preserve the option to purchase some ad-
 vanced weapons production technology from the
 West, and particularly from the United States,
 believing that the creation of expectations of far-
 reaching changes in Sino-Soviet relations could
 alarm the United States sufficiently to endanger
 all these benefits.
 - Beijing's wish not to be perceived by Third
 World leaders as moving closer to the USSR.
 Beiiing has found that Chinese actions viewed in
 Asia as seeking to propitiate Moscow can evoke
 negative reactions from certain states, notably
 Japan and Thailand.
 26. For all these reasons, we fudge that, in the
 absence of major Soviet concessions, Beijing over the
 next two to three years will probably continue to resist
 Soviet pressure for bilateral improvements of a type
 that would be likely to raise serious warning flags
 elsewhere. Chinese response to Soviet overtures will
 therefore continue to be differentiated: in some areas
 Beijing will probably allow further progress, while in
 others China is likely to continue to reject Soviet
 requests:
 - In the first area, Beijing will probably consent to
 some reciprocal visits by important government
 figures (without acknowledging their party sta-
 tus), as well as to continued expansion of dealings
 on those fronts where improvements have al-
 ready begun in the last two years: notably,
 student exchanges, and multiplication of eco-
 nomic, sports, and cultural contacts; and trade
 volume-where agreement may be reached on a
 five-year trade pact.
 - In the second area are those Soviet desires whose
 satisfaction Beijing will probably regard as not
 justified by Soviet conduct and as likely to be
 overly provocative to the United States.  For
 example, in the absence of maior Soviet conces-
 sions (which are themselves unlikely), Beijing will
 probably not agree to the Soviet request, pressed
 by Moscow since 1978, for a formal umbrella
 document to establish the underpinning for a
 new Sino-Soviet relationship. Beijing also is un-
 likely to agree during the period of this Estimate
 to reciprocal visits by top party leaders, and the

 chances are less than even that the Chinese will
 consent to a restoration of party relations. Final-
 ly, we do not believe that Beiiing will consent to
 any overtures from Moscow for concrete Sino-
 Soviet political cooperation against the United
 States.
 The Major Issues Precluding Sino-Soviet
 Improvement
 27. The three primary preconditions that Bening
 has posed for a major improvement in the Sino-Soviet
 relationship are that the USSR significantly reduce its
 military power (nuclear and nonnuclear) adjacent to
 China, cease its support for Vietnam's occupation of
 Kampuchea, and withdraw its combat troops from
 Afghanistan. These issues have different degrees of
 importance to Moscow and Beijing; and it should be
 noted that, if past Chinese negotiating patterns hold,
 Beijing's "preconditions" often remain in a formal
 sense but ultimately give way somewhat in fact. The
 following are the three primary issues, in order of
 increasing importance to the Sino-Soviet relationship.
 Afghanistan
 28. Evidence indicates that the Chinese regard the
 issue of Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan as the
 least important of the three "obstacles." The Chinese
 interpreted the Soviet invasion of  Afghanistan  in
 December 1979 as alarming new evidence of Mos-
 cow's willingness to use force to attain its goals, and as
 a significant advance of the Soviet military presence in
 Asia, creating a new potential for eventual further
 advance of Soviet influence. In particular, China's
 leaders are almost certainly concerned that success for
 the USSR's "southward strategy" in Afghanistan could
 endanger China's close ally Pakistan and the oil routes
 of the Persian Gulf so important to the West. Beijing
 also sees the Soviet assertion of hegemony in Afghani-
 stan as, among other things, an extension of other
 Soviet efforts to encircle China geopolitically, and as
 part of an unending struggle to counteract China's
 influence in Asia.
 29. At the same time, however, the Chinese have
 not seen the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan,
 remote from China because of geography and terrain,
 as adding significantly to the Soviet military threat to
 China. Also because of Afghanistan's remoteness, Bei-
 jing's  sense  of  its vested  interest in  the  political
 orientation of this country has always been much
 weaker than its view of its stake in Indochina. Finally,
 Bejing has come to regard the extended punitive war
 Moscow is waging in Afghanistan as a protracted
 source of Soviet weakness-a point of political vulner-
 ability, adrain on Soviet resources, and a possible
 constraint on Soviet ability to take military initiatives
 elsewhere. Beijing's leaders therefore see the present
 situation as offering important compensation for Sovi-
 et failure to withdraw, and do not seem to be greatly
 concerned at the prospect of continued stalemate.
 30. We fudge that the Soviets are unlikely to aban-
 don efforts to consolidate control over Afghanistan.
 The Soviet leaders are unlikely to modify their view of
 the importance of maintaining a friendly regime in
 power there that also serves as a bridge potentially
 extending Soviet power and influence significantly
 further in Southwest Asia. This view has probably
 been reinforced by the Soviet commitment there to
 preserve Soviet local domination. In any case, the
 Soviet leaders almost certainly regard China's concerns
 as secondary concerning Afghanistan. If more impor-
 tant negative consequences of this policy are insuffi-
 cient to modify Soviet behavior there, the Soviets will
 certainly not do so to appease China.
 31. Beijing's leaders take a far graver view of Soviet
 actions in Indochina, which they regard as incompati-
 ble with China's security. Since 1978, the Soviet Union
 has provided economic, political, and military backing
 for Vietnam's efforts to consolidate its domination
 over the Indochinese peninsula and to exclude Chinese
 influence from the region. The Soviet Union has also
 served as a sizable deterrent to a  major  Chinese
 intervention to halt Vietnam's conquest of Kampu-
 chea. China has been compelled to rely instead on
 supporting a Kampuchean insurgency that for five
 years has denied final victory to Hanoi and Moscow.
 This insurgency has been nourished in part by Chinese
 weapons and supplies funneled through Thailand; as
 well as by the diplomatic support of  China,  the
 ASEAN countries, and the United States; and, indi-
 rectly, by US security backing for Thailand against the
 threat of Vietnamese reprisal. In return for the USSR's
 commitments to Hanoi, Soviet influence has followed
 in the wake of Vietnam into Kampuchea and Laos,
 and the Soviet Union has obtained use of Cam Ranh
 Bay to support growing air, naval, and intelligence
 capabilities on China's southeastern flank.
 32. Available evidence suggests that, while Mos-
 cow's leaders do not regard the present Soviet position
 in Indochina as comparable with Afghanistan in im-
 portance, they surely regard it as an important geopo-
 litical gain registered at the expense of both the United
 States and China. They are well aware of Chinese

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 concern over the two-front military confrontation
 Beijing has been forced to accept since 1979, and they
 doubtless consider that the Soviet deterrent factor has
 humiliated Beijing by demonstrating Chinese inability
 effectively to coerce Vietnam-in an area of tradition-
 al Chinese pretensions to dominant influence. They
 also probably regard their alliance with Vietnam as a
 source of augmented Soviet pressure on China which
 has already paid dividends in the new Chinese willing-
 ness to accept Soviet proposals for modest bilateral
 improvements. Over and above these considerations,
 Soviet leaders almost certainly see their growing mili-
 tary presence at Cam Ranh as a major advance that
 enhances Soviet capabilities to conduct and support
 naval and air operations in the South China Sea and
 the Indian Ocean.
 33. The Soviet relationship with Hanoi that yields
 this Soviet military presence is not without frictions
 and problems for both sides. Evidence clearly estab-
 lishes that the Soviets are sensitive to the costs of
 supporting Vietnam; and that the Vietnamese resent
 Moscow's attempts to establish its own independent
 ties with Hanoi's satellites, Laos and Kampuchea, and
 fear that the USSR might someday betray the interests
 of Vietnam in favor of its huge neighbor, China. The
 demonstrated behavior of the USSR and Vietnam
 makes it clear, however, [hat both parties consider
 their relationship on balance to be a most beneficial
 one.
 34. Hence, we believe it unlikely that the Vietnam-
 ese will change their course in Kampuchea in any
 major way, or that significant change will take place in
 the Moscow-Hanoi relationship over the next two to
 three years, or indeed  perhaps fora  much longer
 period. The Soviet leaders are well acquainted with
 the intransigence of the Vietnamese leadership, and
 almost certainly believe that only drastic Soviet pres-
 sures on Hanoi might conceivably bring sufficient
 Vietnamese concessions to satisfy Beijing, but that the
 attempted use of such pressures would gravely endan-
 ger the Soviet relationship with Vietnam, the Soviet
 military presence in Cam Ranh, and indeed Soviet
 objectives in Southeast Asia. To run political risks of
 this magnitude concerning Vietnam, the Soviets would
 want commensurate gains in advance from Beijing.
 35. The Soviets are unwilling to risk losing the bird
 in the hand-their present advantages in Indochina-
 for the uncertainties of hypothetical Chinese grati-
 tude.  They therefore have consistently refused  to
 bargain with Beijing on the subject of  Indochina
 during their bilateral talks with the Chinese. They
 have on occasion gone so far as to attempt to intimi-
 date ASEAN states, on Vietnam's behalf, into aban-
 doning opposition to the fait accompli in Kampuchea.
 They have maintained intact their deployments along
 China's northern borders, which constitute conspicu-
 ous threats against the possibility of a new Chinese
 military reaction to Vietnam's operations to China's
 south. In sum, the inertia created by existing Soviet
 geopolitical advantages is likely to continue to domi-
 nate Soviet policy in Indochina, and to perpetuate
 Chinese resentment.
 36. Our confidence in this conclusion has been
 further strengthened by the Soviet deployment in
 1983 of nine TU-16 Bad-
 gers-including some five configured as bombers or
 air-to-surface missile carriers-to  Cam Ranh.  The
 Badgers apparently will remain under Soviet control
 and probably will maintain a continuous presence
 there, rotating periodically back to the USSR and
 being replaced by others. If the Badgers remain at
 Cam Ranh, the Chinese may surmise that the Soviet
 Union has extorted from Vietnam permission for this
 deployment as partial compensation for the Sov~.et
 refusal to betray Hanoi to conciliate Beijing. Chinese
 leaders almost certainly interpret the advent of the
 Badger bombers as fresh evidence that the Soviet
 Union is likely to remain intransigent on the Indochina
 issue.
 The Augmenting of Soviet Military Power
 Adjacent to China
 37. In view of the poor prospects for Sino-Soviet
 accommodation regarding Afghanistan or Indochina,
 the third issue-the question of whether the Soviet
 leaders will make major concessions regarding force
 deployment policy in Asia-is likely to have a great
 influence on the evolution of the Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship over the next few years.  We review in turn,
 below, the evidence of existing trends in Soviet and
 Chinese deployments, the possibilities and probabili-
 ties of Soviet concessions, and the role of the Sino-
 Soviet border dispute in Soviet thinking on these
 matters..
 38. Trends in Soviet Deplouments and Modern-
 ization. The improvements noted in the Sino-Soviet
 relationship have taken place in the face of a continu-
 ing strengthening of the Soviet military position in the
 eastern USSR and the Pacific. The pace of quantita-
 tive buildup has tapered off from that of the late 1960s
 and early 1970s; Moscow now seems intent on fulfill-
 ing longstanding force modernization plans in the
 area, upgrading the capabilities of deployed units, and
 increasing logistic support. Nonetheless, one-fourth of

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 all Soviet Ground Forces personnel-nearly 500,000
 troops-is now stationed opposite China. Ground units
 in the eastern USSR and Mongolia devoted to the anti-
 China mission include 48 active divisions and an
 independent army corps. These units are supported by
 well over 2,000 aircraft and over 100,000 air person-
 nel. During the past year, while Sino-Soviet consulta-
 tions have been in progress, the Soviets have added
 two motorized rifle divisions to their active forces,
 converted a motorized rifle division into a tank divi-
 sion, and formed afighter-bomber regiment facing the
 Chinese. In addition, at least one air assault unit and
 an additional artillery brigade are now being formed
 along the border with China. Meanwhile, the Soviets
 over the last year have also made costly investments in
 military logistic capabilities in the Far East, and have
 begun construction there for a new garrison, probably
 intended to house part of another new division. We
 think it likely the Soviets will also continue over the
 next few years an ongoing construction program to
 expand fortified zones in certain sectors of the Sino-
 Soviet border.
 39. The  Soviets  have  also  continued  slowly  to
 strengthen their military position in Mongolia, despite
 China's known sensitivity on this subject and repeated
 Chinese demands for reduction of these deployments.
 There the Soviets have constructed new SA-5 air
 defense regimental complexes and radar stations, re-
 placed older tanks with new T-72 models, and upgrad-
 ed some of  their artillery and armored personnel
 carrier holdings. In result, the Soviet army in Mongo-
 lia, which is in position to threaten the North China
 plain and routes to Beijing, is the most combat-ready
 force facing China and receives a relatively high
 priority in the USSR's gradual modernization of Far
 East equipment.
 40. In addition, the weight of the Soviet strategic
 nuclear threat directed against China is continuing to
 grow even while the small-scale improvements in Sino-
 Soviet relations proceed. The Soviets currently have
 135 SS-20 launchers deployed at 15 bases in Siberia-
 plus 90 additional SS-20 launchers in the central USSR
 that could hit targets in western China-and are
 constructing facilities at two more bases for 18 addi-
 tional SS-20 launchers. It should be noted that the
 present SS-20 force threatens China with more war-
 heads than were on the older single-reentry-vehicle
 missiles that were directed against targets in China
 before deployment of the SS-20.
 41. But the Chinese face not only the present SS-20
 force and Soviet ICBMs, but a considerable array of
 other Soviet nuclear weapon systems as well: over 200
 Backfire and Badger bombers, shorter range ballistic
 missiles, tactical aircraft, and two older Y-class ballistic
 missile submarines in the Sea of Janan ~
 we  ju ge that the great majority o  a
 present  oviet strategic targets in Asia are probably in
 China, although the Soviet nuclear systems are flexible
 and could be shifted to other targets. For their part,
 however, Beijing's leaders are convinced that China
 remains the primary target of these various deploy-
 ments, despite considerable Soviet efforts in dealing
 with Asian states to obfuscate the purpose of the
 USSR's heavy SS-20 deployment in Asia.
 42. The total number of aircraft assigned to Soviet
 units in the Far East is expected to decline slightly
 during the next few years. Nonetheless, technological
 improvements in aircraft, avionics, and weapon sys-
 tems will allow the Soviets to upgrade their ability to
 perform their assigned missions while deploying fewer
 aircraft to each regiment. In strategic aviation, the
 initial deployment of the new Blackjack bomber in the
 late 1980s will highlight developments. The Blackjack,
 together with increased numbers of Bear H bombers,
 creates a formidable standoff air-launched cruise mis-
 sile capability east of the Urals. A third Backfire
 regiment will further increase strategic strike options.
 In the tactical air force, a key development will be the
 deployment of lookdown/shootdown fighters: the Fox-
 hound, Flanker, and Fulcrum. These aircraft will be
 faster and more maneuverable, and will carry missiles
 suited for both dogfighting and engagements beyond
 visual range engagements. Ground attack aircraft are
 expected to be equipped with  new longer range
 tactical air-to-surface missiles.  This improved deep
 strike capability .will be complemented by the intro-
 duction of Frogfoot and additional helicopters dedi-
 cated to supporting Soviet ground forces along the
 Sino-Soviet border.
 43. The Soviet Pacific Fleet has significantly in-
 creased its size and capability over the past decade by
 acquiring more modern submarines, surface combat-
 ants, amphibious ships, and aircraft.s During the next
 5 Since 1979 major improvements to Pacific Fleet Forces have
 included frontline D-III SSBNs, V-III (nuclear) and K-class (nonnu-
 clear) attack submarines, two Kiev-class carriers (CVHGs), a number
 of Kresta and Kara cruisers (CGs) and Krivak frigates (FFGs), Ivan
 Rogov amphibious ships (LPDs), Bear Flong-range antisumbarine
 (ASW) aircraft,  Helix  ASW  helicopters,  and  two  regiments  of
 Backfire strike bombers. Additionally, aFitter Cfighter-bomber
 regiment has been formed in the Pacific Fleet. Not least, the Soviet
 Pacific Fleet has acquired  the above-discussed naval and air
 facilities at Cam Rahn, Vietnam.

 few years the new Kirov-class cruiser (CGN), Sovre-
 mennyy- and Udaloy-class destroyers (DDGs), and S-
 class attack submarines (SSNs) are expected to be
 introduced into the Soviet Pacific Fleet. These units
 will provide significantly improved weapons and sen-
 sors for antisurface attack, air defense, and antisubma-
 rine warfare. We believe the Soviet Pacific Fleet will
 continue to be structured primarily to oppose US naval
 forces although it will also devote attention and re-
 sources to counter other potential threats such as those
 from some Japanese or Chinese naval forces. While
 the overall force level of the Soviet Pacific Fleet will
 remain about the same, its capability will increase
 with the introduction of new classes of submarines,
 principal surface combatants, amphibious ships, and
 shipboard aircraft.
 44. Overall,  given  these  trends  in  Soviet  force
 strength, the nature of the Sino-Soviet relationship
 over the next few years will be strongly influenced by
 the decisions the Soviet regime adopts regarding force
 modernization and deployment policy in Asia. On
 both the nuclear and the conventional sides, however,
 the momentum of existing Soviet policy-the impetus
 for further incremental growth rather than either
 stagnation or reductions-is unlikely to be overcome.
 45. Comparative Chinese Military Strength. The
 Soviets confront (a) Chinese ground forces that are
 much larger than Soviet Far East ground forces in
 manpower, but much weaker in firepower, maneuver
 capability, and air support; and (b) Chinese strategic
 nuclear forces that are still fairly small in size and rely
 upon concealment and mobility rather than numbers
 for their deterrent effect. In the four Chinese military
 regions bordering on the USSR and Mongolia, the
 Chinese now deploy some 68  main-force combat
 divisions, which are largely stationed a hundred miles
 and more back from the border, defensively  posi-
 tioned to trade space for time in the event of a Soviet
 attack and to guard against the possibility of converg-
 ing Soviet assaults to overrun Beiiing or to cut off
 Northeast China. In the last four years, the Chinese
 have increased their tanks, armored personnel carriers,
 and aircraft in the border regions by some 30 percent,
 and they have formed new units and strengthened
 their fortifications along probable invasion routes.

 CSS-4 (13,000- to 16,000-kilometer-range ICBM)

 CSS-4s may now be deployed. The deterrent

 supplemented b  the mobility of     CSS-1   25X1
 MRBMs and           CSS-2 IRBMs, as well as   25X1
 the availability of some 120 TU-16 intermediate-range
 bombers, all of which can deliver nuclear weapons to
 parts of Soviet Asia.fi In addition, the Chinese in recent
 years have launched their first nuclear-powered ballis-
 tic missile submarine, intended to carry the CSS-NX-3
 SLBM (which is still undergoing flight tests). Deploy-
 ment of this weapon system as an additional element
 in the Chinese deterrent against the USSR is expected
 between 1984 and 1987. Finally, the Chinese have also
 shown considerable sensitivity about their potential
 vulnerability to Soviet use of tactical nuclear weapons,
 and have conducted and publicized exercises that
 reckon with this contingency. The Chinese have no
 deployed weapons comparable to Soviet tactical nucle-
 ar weapons in flexibility and accuracy,  and they
 probably believe that the Soviets are more readily
 inclined to use such weapons in the Far East than in
 Europe. Overall, although the Chinese are making
 important improvements in their deterrent and war-
 fighting capabilities, they are not closing the gap in
 relation to the growing and improving Soviet forces
 that face them; on the contrary, they are continuing to
 fall further behind.
 47. The Future of SS-20s in Asia and in Europe.
 We believe the Soviets will fill out the existing four SS-
 20 divisions in Siberia to a total of six bases each by the
 late 1980s. Because each SS-20 carries three reentry
 vehicles, the advent of this IRBM capability in East
 Asia has already significantly expanded nuclear capa-
 bilities against China. With four divisions of six regi-
 ments each, the Soviets would have 216 missiles with
 648 warheads for an initial strike against Asian targets.
 In addition, by the end of the decade the Soviets may
 begin to deploy a new IRBM to replace the SS-20, and
 may also deploy ground-launched cruise missiles in the
 region.
 48. SS-20  deployments reflect long-range  Soviet
 strategic plans. These are importantly influenced by
 the visible trends in Chinese weapons development
 and deployment  policy,  and by the prospects of
 increased US military strength in the Far East in the
 1980s. In both regards, the Soviets will almost certainly
 take action in advance to guarantee undiminished
 force advantages against worst-case eventualities.
 49. The Andropov regime showed that, given 25X1
 cient strategic political gains concerning Europe, it
 might be willing to contemplate curtailment of ;t~
 plans for a much greater SS-20 buildup; this25X1

 probably characterize the Chernenko regime's objec-
 tives as well. During the INF negotiations, the Soviets
 offered not to transfer SS-20s to Asia if an agreement
 acceptable to the USSR materialized. They subse-
 quently offered, if such an agreement were adopted,
 to halt new SS-20 deployment in East Asia through
 new construction so long as deployments in that region
 aimed at Soviet territory did not subsequently in-
 crease.' These proposals reflect the great importance
 to the Soviet Union of an advantageous INF agree-
 ment, and implied willingness at the time to trade off
 planned enlargement of their existing nuclear advan-
 tage in  East  Asia in  order to  prevent  American
 deployments in Europe. Secondarily, those Soviet of-
 fers were also intended as gestures to Japan and China,
 calculated to place the onus for any further Soviet SS-
 20 buildup in Siberia on US deployment policy in East
 Asia.
 50. The future of the SS-20 program in Asia and the
 ultimate size of the total Soviet nuclear threat against
 China have thus been made partly dependent upon
 the prospects for INF agreement in Europe. In the
 wake of the beginning of Western intermediate-range
 nuclear deployments in December  1983,  and the
 Soviet withdrawal-at least for the time being-from
 INF negotiations, the Soviets are very unlikely soon to
 halt SS-20 deployment in Siberia. In the continued
 absence of an INF agreement, we believe that within
 the next two to three years the Soviets will probably
 not stop further SS-20 deployments in Asia merely to
 conciliate Beijing and Tokyo.
 51. We believe there is even less chance than this
 that Moscow over this period will actually reduce its
 SS-20 deployments as the Chinese have demanded,
 either unilaterally or as the result of  Sino-Soviet
 bargaining. The Soviet leaders are likely to be skepti-
 cal that an acceptable nuclear arms agreement can be
 negotiated with Beijing in view of the enormous
 asymmetries in the bilateral balance of forces.
 52. The Issue of the Ground Force Posture Ad~a-
 cent to China. In principle, the Chinese demand the
 simple elimination  of  the Soviet capabilities  that
 threaten them: that is, a reduction of the Soviet force
 structure in East Asia, back down to the level existing
 almost two decades ago in Khrushchev's day. The
 Chinese have privately indicated that they would be

 satisfied with much less to start with, and some leaders
 in Beijing may hope that a unilateral Soviet local
 pullback of some forces may eventually be procured
 that would start a process of Soviet reductions that
 might later be expanded. A general Soviet pullback to
 conciliate Beijing appears highly implausible-for sev-
 eral reasons:
 - Because of geography, Soviet forces in the east-
 ernmost sector of the border; which must defend
 large vulnerable cities and the Trans-Siberian
 Railroad near the frontier, have no defense-in-
 depth option and thus are necessarily deployed
 much closer to the border than Chinese main-
 force units. Consequently, any ostensibly mutual
 pullback of Soviet and Chinese forces from the
 border must in fact be essentially a unilateral
 Soviet withdrawal unless it is limited to minus-
 '   cule border guard forces at the frontier itself.
 This is likely to remain politically unacceptable
 to any set of Soviet leaders.
 - In the narrow Far East Military District salient
 from Khabarovsk to Vladivostok, the most im-
 portant part of the Soviet Far East and the most
 heavily defended area of its size in the Soviet
 Union, Soviet forces have little room to maneu-
 ver or space for a pullback.
 - There are some points on the border where a
 pullback could be construed as compromising
 Soviet border claims.
 53. Furthermore, we believe that Moscow will not
 agree even to selected pullbacks of selected units in
 certain localities. The Soviets are highly reluctant to
 agree to unilateral constraints on their troop disposi-
 tions and more broadly perceive their overall relation-
 ship  with  China  as  impelling  them  to  continue
 strengthening their force dispositions opposite China.
 In recent years, the Soviets have followed a pattern of
 activating at least one new division each year in the
 Far East from existing mobilization bases that hold the
 pre-positioned equipment for such divisions. We have
 identified additional mobilization bases in the Far East
 that we believe the Soviets intend to convert incre-
 mentally into active divisions over the next few years,
 with the additions entering active status at about the
 same measured pace we have seen in the past. We see
 little reason to believe that the Soviets have yet
 decided to alter this long-term pattern of behavior.
 54. This Soviet pattern of thinking has been most
 clearly shown in the Soviet Union's refusal, in its talks
 thus far with Beijing, to discuss changes in Soviet

 military deployments in Mongolia.e In principle, this is
 the sector in which noticeable Soviet concessions could
 be made to China without major impact upon the
 Soviet Union's ability to defend itself against China. In
 Mongolia alone, the Soviets have a large buffer against
 China and could if necessary trade space for time. The
 token withdrawal of perhaps a Soviet division or so
 from Mongolia northward to the Soviet-Mongolian
 border would not endanger any Soviet city, and would
 not expose any Soviet territory to Chinese attack.
 Additionally, over the past year and more, the Soviets
 have significantly upgraded the equipment and capa-
 bilities of Mongolia's own armed forces. Between 1980
 and 1983 the Soviets provided the Mongolians with
 enough additional equipment to upgrade their two
 existing brigades to motorized rifle divisions and form
 two additional MRDs, although all four are at low
 strength.
 55. It seems likely that the Soviet leaders intend to
 withhold concessions. regarding their forces in Mongo-
 lia until Beijing has made more fundamental conces-
 sions than it has yet been willing to consider. We do
 perceive a moderate chance, however, that within the
 next two to three years the Soviet leaders will be
 willing to offer China some token concession regarding
 their force posture in Mongolia, in the hope of begin-
 ning aprocess of mutual concessions that could even-
 tually produce a breakthrough to maior Soviet goals. A
 local pullback of perhaps one or so of the USSR's five
 divisions now in Mongolia might be such a step. If the
 Soviets did make such a withdrawal, this would consti-
 tute asymbolic concession of some significance. It
 would not be too meaningful in military terms, how-
 ever, since such units could be reintroduced into
 Mongolia at any time. If the Soviets did withdraw a
 division or more, we judge that the Chinese would
 welcome the move and would wish to respond in a
 fashion likely to encourage more such Soviet gestures.
 Beijing's  response, at least initially, would also be
 likely to be largely symbolic in nature.
 56. In the meantime, in the absence of the kind of
 large-scale withdrawals the Chinese are requesting at
 the moment (for the total border area), it is probable
 The Soviets state that they will not discuss their troops in
 Mongolia because this is a matter concerning a "third country." The
 Chinese almost certainly regard this as a hypocritical evasion of the
 issue. The Soviet Union effectively controls the Mongolian regime,
 and any Mongolian reservations about possible Soviet troop with-
 drawals would be a relatively minor consideration for Moscow if the
 Soviets felt some withdrawals to be otherwise desirable. We also
 believe that the Soviet Union does not need five divisions in
 Mongolia either to enforce the loyalty of the Tsedenbal regime or to
 safeguard Mongolia against Chinese attack.
 that the Soviet Union will continue to propose cosmet-
 ic substitutes. Since the early 1970s, the Soviets have
 unsuccessfully offered the Chinese proposals for a
 nonaggression pact and for an agreement on no first
 use of nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union in the last
 year has evidently made a number of additional
 suggestions for confidence-building measures ICBMs).
 Although the Chinese will probably continue to regard
 most such Soviet proposals as essentially evasions of
 China's central concerns, they may no longer reject all
 such suggestions out of hand. It is possible that China
 will come to see agreement with the Soviet Union on
 one or more selected CBMs, such as mutual notifica-
 tion of troop exercises, as having a marginal usefulness
 in helping to reduce tensions. Should any CBMs in fact
 be agreed upon during the next two to three years, it
 would probably not have an early impact upon the
 hard issues separating China and the USSR regarding
 the status of the border or the question of overall
 Soviet force dispositions. Agreement even on such
 superficial CBM measures, however, would give some
 impetus  to  the  process  of  improving  Sino-Soviet
 dealings.
 The Central Role of the United States and Japan
 The American Factor
 57. The Sino-Soviet future will not be a bilateral
 affair, but will develop as part of the broader dynamic
 of Sino-Soviet-US triangular relations. And the evolu-
 tion of the future relationships of the Soviet Union and
 China with the United States, whether improvements
 or setbacks,  will continue to be one of the most
 important factors affecting the behavior of Moscow
 and Beijing toward each other. US policies toward the
 USSR and China will of course not determine the
 conduct of the two Communist powers toward each
 other, but will certainly help condition that behavior,
 and on the margin could conceivably be decisive.
 58. Both Moscow and Beijing remain highly sensi-
 tive to their perception of the US relationship with the
 other. The Chinese have traditionally feared "super-
 power collusion," while the Soviet leadership has for
 many years been deeply concerned at the prospect of
 Sino-US security collaboration at Soviet expense. Since
 the first stages of Sino-American rapprochement in the
 early 1970s, Soviet Politburo members have warned
 US leaders against anti-Soviet cooperation with China,
 and have occasionally sought to entice the United
 States into commitments incompatible with good US
 relations with Beijing. At the same time, the Soviets
 have for years vainly sought to better their position in
 the triangle by improving relations with Beijing, and

 to this end have repeatedly sought to reestablish
 personal contacts with Chinese leaders.
 59. Today, available evidence clearly indicates that
 both Moscow and Beijing remain concerned at the
 possibility of sudden changes that would heighten the
 prospect of US collusion with the other. Beijing, while
 reassured by the depth of Soviet-US differences, has
 nevertheless retained residual concerns about the pos-
 sibility of sudden deals between the two superpowers,
 particularly at summit meetings,  that might have
 adverse implications for Chinese interests. Such Chi-
 nese concerns remain especially strong regarding INF
 issues. The dominant current of Soviet opinion, on the
 other hand, has never ceased to believe that despite
 Sino-US differences, the basic character of the rela-
 tionship between Beijing and Washington remains one
 of cooperation against Soviet policy. This view has
 been strengthened by many of the events of 1983 and
 1984 that signal a warming of Sino-US relations,
 particularly the visits of the US Secretaries of Defense
 and State and Premier Zhao Ziyang, and the scheduled
 visits of President Reagan and Defense Minister Zhang
 Aiping.
 60. Chinese policy faces a dilemma on these scores.
 On the one hand, Beijing has a need for a strong and
 continuing relationship with the United States in order
 to support Chinese economic and military develop-
 ment and to assist China in resisting ongoing Soviet
 geopolitical pressure in Asia. On the other hand, the
 Chinese may sense that this association with the
 United States, even if formally disavowed, remains a
 factor that renders major Soviet concessions to Chi-
 na-though not gestures-unlikely.
 61. The present strained relationship between Mos-
 cow and Washington also poses another dilemma of
 sorts for Beijing. In general, it welcomes US toughness
 toward Moscow, both because it desires that United
 States inhibit Soviet expansionist impulses, and be-
 cause it hopes that China will derive additional lever-
 age over both Moscow and Washington as a result of
 marked Soviet-US tensions. At the same time, the
 Chinese have indicated that their own position could
 be greatly endangered if these tensions were to esca-
 late to produce a severe Soviet-US crisis. We fudge that
 the Chinese leadership has no desire to become em-
 broiled in such a crisis if it arose over issues remote
 from direct Chinese security concerns, and that under
 those difficult circumstances Beijing would endeavor
 to maintain China's neutrality. Nevertheless, China's
 leaders probably also recognize that if such a crisis
 arose in an area more directly relevant to China's
 security interests-such as the Indochina area or Paki-
 stan-they would face more difficult risks and choices
 in their posture toward the Soviet Union. More broad-
 ly, the  Chinese recognize that they  have  a  vested
 interest in the continued ability of the United States
 and Western Europe to offset Soviet power, and that
 Chinese vulnerability vis-a-vis the Soviet Union would
 be enormously increased if that offset were greatly
 weakened.
 62. Over time,  the Sino-Soviet relationship may
 become more responsive to adverse changes in the US
 relationship with either of the other two powers. Over
 the last three years, bilateral difficulties with the
 United States have already, to one degree or another,
 influenced both Moscow and Beiiing to wish to be able
 to improve relations with each other. In October 1982,
 a month before his death,  Brezhnev gave public
 expression to this motive in an address to military
 commanders, warning Soviet marshals that the aggra-
 vation of Soviet relations with the United States had
 given added importance to the possibility of improve-
 ment with China. Meanwhile, the Chinese desire to
 test Soviet willingness to make concessions had been
 given impetus in 1982 by new frictions with the
 United States over the question of the US relationship
 with Taiwan.
 63. The desire for moderating Sino-Soviet hostility
 is not synonymous with the willingness of either of
 these two Communist powers to make the concessions
 necessary for far-reaching improvements in their rela-
 tionship. The basic conflicts of interest are sufficiently
 great to make it improbable that improvement in the
 Sino-Soviet relationship will reach the point of a full
 rapprochement with harmful implications for US in-
 terests. Nevertheless, the readiness of the Soviet and
 Chinese leaders to contemplate key concessions to
 each other is a factor that is influenced by the state of
 their relationship with the United States. Both the
 USSR and China will probably endeavor to preserve
 and improve the negotiating process and to deal with
 issues on which agreement can be reached. At the
 same  time  they  will  seek  to use  their  improved
 relationship to gain leverage in their dealings with the
 United States. Nonetheless, a radical growth in ten-
 sions between the United States and either the USSR
 or China might provoke one of them to consider
 making major concessions.
 The Japanese Factor
 64. A second very important external influence on
 the direction that Sino-Soviet relations will take in the
 next two to three years will be that of Japan. Japan's
 present set of relationships with Washington, Beijing,
 and Moscow exerts leverage on China, reinforcing the
 considerations that pull Beijing toward the United

 States and that impose limits on Sino-Soviet concilia-
 tion. A maior change in the Chinese attitude toward
 Japan-though unlikely-could have serious effects on
 the Sino-Soviet-US triangle.
 65. The USSR's relations with Japan have worsened
 over the past decade and are not likely to be reversed
 during the period of this Estimate. The Soviets are
 increasingly exercised at what they see to be growing
 US-Japanese security cooperation, primarily because
 of the expectation that this cooperation will augment
 US capabilities against the Soviet Union in Northeast
 Asia. The Soviets also appear to be concerned about
 the long-term implications of the gradual but steady
 buildup  in  Japanese  conventional  military  forces.
 Moreover, despite the fact that the Sino-US-Japanese
 military cooperation the Soviet Union feared in the
 late 1970s has failed to materialize in the 1980s, Soviet
 military planners take aworst-case view of this possi-
 bility and consider Japan as an enemy allied with the
 United States and China.
 66. For a number of years the USSR's tough, obtuse
 efforts  to  intimidate  the  Japanese  have  greatly
 strengthened anti-Soviet attitudes in Japan. The Soviet
 leaders have not altered their adamant resection of
 Tokyo's claim to the small islands that constitute the
 Northern Territories, and they have continued the
 militarization of these islands begun in 1978 and the
 modernization of the weapons deployed there. Mos-
 cow's propensity to continue strengthening its large
 existing military advantages in the vicinity of Japan
 has probably been given further impetus as a conse-
 quence of the September 1983 overflight and downing
 of the Korean Air Lines plane. Meanwhile, the growth
 of Soviet SS-20 deployments in Asia has significantly
 heightened Japanese anxiety. As noted earlier, during
 1983 Japanese protests about these deployments were
 theless, Moscow's leaders probably draw some encour-
 agement from the recent Japanese national elections,
 hoping that the results will undermine Premier Naka-
 sone's efforts to strengthen Japan's military programs.
 This will almost certainly serve to encourage Soviet
 leaders to continue generally their previous policies
 toward Japan, in the belief that political intimidation
 combined with economic incentives will pay off for
 Moscow over the long run in "softening up" attitudes
 in Japan. Prospects for successful use of economic
 inducements are not good: reduced Japanese demand
 for natural resources combined with the cutoff  in
 official credits after the Afghanistan invasion suggest
 that, with the possible exception of Sakhalin gas, large-
 scale Siberian resource development proiects will not
 be initiated any time soon.   '
 67. For its part, China's economic ties with Japan
 are by far the most important it has with any country
 in the capitalist industrialized world, and also dwarf
 China's trade with the Soviet Union. This leading
 Japanese role in assisting China's modernization is
 therefore the second most important bulwark of Bei-
 iing's relationship with the West, after its broader
 connections with the United States. Because of the
 strength of Japanese-American ties, the Sino-Japanese
 relationship reinforces other Chinese incentives to
 maintain China's US connections.
 68. Although  most aspects of  the  Sino-Japanese
 relationship remain fairly healthy, in some areas the
 relationship has somewhat cooled over the past two
 years: China has become less outspoken in support of
 the Japanese-American security relationship, and more
 reserved about most issues relating to Japanese defense
 efforts against the Soviet Union; and Bening has made
 sporadic strident attacks on what the Chinese some-
 times profess to see as a rising danger of Japanese
 militarism. China still supports Japanese claims against
 the Soviet Union concerning the Northern Territories,
 though less vociferously, and, after years of concen-
 trating almost exclusively on cultivation of the ruling
 Japanese conservatives, Bening has reopened ties to the
 Socialist opposition, as well as to local antinuclear
 weapons movements.
 69. The Chinese leaders are well aware of Japan's
 military weakness, and probably do not see a grave or
 imminent danger of Japanese militarism. And their
 latent concerns on this matter, while real, are at
 present far outweighed by their sense of the enormous
 economic contribution China receives from its rela-
 tionship with Japan. The Soviet Union ardently seeks   25X1
 to reverse this Chinese sense of priorities, to alarm
 China about Japan and the Japanese alliance with the
 United States, and to use this alarm as a vehicle for
 Sino-Soviet political cooperation against the United
 States. The USSR has little hope of success in this effort
 unless fairly radical changes occur on the Japanese
 the present role Japan plays with respect to Sino-Soviet
 relations.

 To  Secret
 Variables, Uncertainties, and Possible Alternative,
 Outcomes
 70. The central judgments of this Estimate have
 been based on the belief that the broad structure of
 world affairs will more or less continue. We believe it
 likely that most aspects of this structure will continue
 in general, though there is sufficient uncertainty to
 warrant  flagging  the  possibility-and  the  conse-
 quences-of certain developments.
 71. Stability o}' Chinese and American Policy-
 making. As noted earlier, the Soviets appear to believe
 that future changes in Chinese or US leaderships could
 cause Beijing to incline toward a much more substan-
 tial Sino-Soviet rapprochement than now seems proba-
 ble. Soviet leaders are likely to hope that existing
 disagreements within the Chinese elite will eventually
 grow sufficiently important to bring about changed
 priorities and foreign policies in Beijing. They proba-
 bly base this hope not on evidence that this is likely to
 happen, but primarily on the long record of Chinese
 political leadership instability. Soviet leaders doubtless
 harbor hopes that sentiment more favorable to the
 USSR and more hostile to the United States may
 emerge in leadership ranks of the Chinese armed
 forces-the  People's  Liberation  Army (PLA).  The
 Soviets  appear  to  judge  that  some  of  the  sharpest
 criticisms of Deng Xiaoping's "American connection"
 have issued from some old guard PLA circles, and they
 make special efforts to appeal to this audience
 Dissent in Beijing Regime
 Available evidence is thin on the question of differ-
 ences within China's leadership concerning optimum
 policies toward the USSR and the United States. It has
 long been clear that there is no coherent, recognizable
 faction that is "pro-Soviet" as such.  Certain Soviet
 overtures and propaganda over the years have nonethe-
 less played  to such  presumed sympathetic Chinese
 leaders. And, in the last two years or so, some of these
 leaders apparently have been sharply critical of what
 they consider an unrewarding and unnecessarily pro-US
 policy on the part of Beiiing. At a minimum the Soviets
 have been playing to such figures.
 72. Such hopes as exist among Soviet leaders that a
 changed political scene in Beijing might lead to a less
 cordial Chinese relationship with the United States are
 doubtless buttressed by the fact of Deng Xiaoping's
 advancing age-he will be 80 years old this year-and
 of the advent of leaders who, unlike Deng, have not
 been personally associated in the past with strongly
 anti-Soviet attitudes. Even now within China there are
 signs of resistance to Deng's initiatives, and indication
 that there is some hesitance to accepting party Chair-
 man Hu Yaobang as Deng's putative successor. Hence
 there may be some expectation in Moscow that a
 period of uncertainty and the absence of a strong
 successor to Deng, at least initially, might strengthen
 existing resistance within China's leadership to any
 significant strategic or economic modernization coop-
 eration with the United States. That such a succession
 situation would necessarily redound to Moscow's bene-
 fit is by no means certain, however, whatever the
 Soviet expectation, inasmuch as new Chinese leaders
 will seek to avoid having their political ambitions
 damaged by becoming vulnerable to partisan domestic
 charges that they are "soft" on China's enemy, the
 USSR. Nevertheless, as they did when Mao died, the
 Soviets can be expected to use such an occasion to
 advance proposals for movement in the relationship.
 73. Continuity of Present Chinese Policy in the
 Border Dispute. The border issue has been intracta-
 ble to date because the adamant negotiating position
 of China has been interwoven with its much broader
 political struggle against the Soviet Union, and because
 Beiiing's leaders have maintained this position as an
 instrument of political warfare against Moscow. It is
 unlikely that Beijing will give up this position during
 the next two to three years. Nevertheless, we believe
 that, if China did yield on this question and began to
 move toward a border settlement more acceptable to
 the Soviets, the chance of reciprocal major Soviet
 concessions over the long run would be enhanced,
 Sino-Soviet relations would then enter a period of
 much greater fluidity, and the possibilities for further
 mutual concessions would grow.
 74. Continuation of a Kampuchean Resistance
 to Vietnam. Collapse of military resistance to Viet-
 nam in Kampuchea would alter many of the terms of
 the present political equation in East Asia. Under these
 circumstances, the chances would grow that the pres-
 ent ASEAN consensus regarding policy toward Indo-
 china would dissipate, and that the United States
 would come under considerable pressure from some
 ASEAN states to ioin them in finding a formula with
 which to come to terms with Vietnamese domination
 of Indochina. Any such situation would conflict with

 1
 The Sino-Soviet Border Dispute
 Background
 ? Played down by both sides during alliance in the
 1950s.
 ? Seen  by the  Chinese as a focal point of  wrongs
 perpetrated by the Russian Empire and the Soviet
 Union against China. Now used by Chinese as
 instrument  of  political  warfare  against  Soviet
 Union, to demonstrate the USSR's "great-power
 hegemonist" tendencies and its refusal to admit
 past injustices.
 ? Regarded by Soviets as a fundamental threat to the
 security of  their eastern border and  the most
 important single bilateral issue in contention with
 the Chinese. The immediate precipitant of the
 Soviet military buildup opposite China. Seen by
 Soviets as both a false issue and potentially only the
 first "bill" Chinese intend to present for return of
 territory historically acquired at China's expense.
 ? Dispute centers on 19th-century treaties-worded
 imprecisely for some sectors, and subject to differ-
 ent  interpretations-by  which  Russia  acquired
 some 1.5 million square kilometers of territory in
 Central Asia and the Amur River Basin.
 ? Chinese have stated willingness to accept the
 boundary laid down by the old treaties as long as
 Moscow concedes they are "unjust," but demand
 return  of  certain  Soviet-occupied  territories they
 claim were not even granted by these treaties. The
 areas in dispute include 20,000 square kilometers of
 land in the Pamirs, some islands in the Amur and
 Ussuri Rivers in the Far East, and several small
 tracts depicted differently on each country's maps.
 one  of  the  important  props  of  the  present  Sino-
 American relationship, and could create the possibility
 of further changes in the Chinese posture toward the
 United States and the Soviet Union. It is unlikely that
 Hanoi will in fact find it possible to put a fairly
 complete end to Kampuchean resistance in the next
 two to three years. But it is clear that the stability of
 both the Sino-US relationship and the firmness of the
 Chinese position  vis-a-vis the USSR  will to some
 degree continue to be contingent upon the continua-
 tion of the present military stalemate in Indochina and
 the preservation of Sino-US cooperation against Soviet
 policy in Indochina.
 75. Stability of Politics and Policies in the USSR.
 The initial statements and actions of the Chernenko
 ? Both sides tabled some concessions at intial round of
 border talks in 1964, and Soviets eventually offered a
 few more concessions at second round, which began in
 October 1969 and continued intermittently over the
 next nine years.
 ? Chinese demanded that Soviets admit certain areas are
 in "dispute," recognize inequity of old treaties, agree to
 an unconditional return of "illegally" occupied territory,
 and withdraw their forces from all disputed areas
 pending settlement of China's claims.
 ? Soviets refuse to admit old treaties are "unequal" or to
 withdraw their forces from "disputed areas" (almost all
 of which are now in their hands), but have expressed a
 willingness to conduct a new survey of the boundary
 lines, and continue to urge a resumption of border talks.
 urrent Prospects
 ? Resumption of border talks unlikely at present, but the
 two sides maintain regular contact on matters related to
 dispute at Deputy Foreign Minister talks and, to a lesser
 extent, through the Sino-Soviet Border River Navigation
 Joint Commission.
 ? Situation along border remains quiet at the moment,
 with both sides forgoing aggressive patrolling where
 boundary is in dispute. Neither side, however, shows
 signs of a willingness to yield on key points-most
 notably, ownership of Heixiazi Island at the confluence
 of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, adjoining the Soviet city
 of Khabarovsk and the Trans-Siberian Railroad.
 regime indicate a desire to project orderliness in the
 succession and continuity in the USSR's dealings with
 China. But Chernenko-at age 72, and not in the best
 of health-could suddenly depart from the scene,
 leaving his colleagues with a new succession problem
 on their hands. There is no indication at this time that
 any of the likely contenders-even the younger ones
 such as Romanov or Gorbachev-are out of step with
 the USSR's long-established China policy. If, however,
 in the course of leadership turnover, a significant
 segment of the leadership came to question the general
 thrust of current policy, different ideas about Soviet
 foreign relations might ultimately ensue.  Relations
 with China could be one of the major foreign policy
 issues under review during this period, particularly if

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 it involved a new set of leaders who had no role in the
 bitter exchanges of the 1950s and 1960s. It is conceiv-
 able that the situation could produce either a much
 more conciliatory approach or a significant toughening
 of the USSR's policy toward China. Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions could, in fact, become very fluid if the Soviet
 leadership turnover should coincide with the change-
 over to a new leadership in China.
 76. Preservation of Stability in the Korean Pen-
 insula. Beijing's interest in maintaining good relations
 with the United States conflicts to some degree with its
 interest in preserving a close relationship with Pyong-
 yang. Because of its geographic position, North Korea
 has always been of great importance to China, and
 over the last two years Beijing has taken vigorous
 initiatives to strengthen this relationship and to pre-
 serve the edge that Chinese influence has in Pyong-
 yang over that of the USSR. In anticipation of the
 coming political succession to Kim Il-song, the Chinese
 have in fact reluctantly acknowledged the special
 status of Kim's designated heir, his son Kim Chong-il.
 77. Beijing, aware that its relationship with Wash-
 ington could become hostage of North Korea's aspira-
 tions to dominate the south, has indicated to both
 Washington and Seoul its desire to maintain stability
 in the Korean Peninsula. Since China cannot control
 P'yongyang's actions, however, it faces a dilemma.
 The North Korean regime, apparently concerned that
 time is working to strengthen the relative economic
 and international position of the Republic of Korea,
 has taken an increasingly militant line over the past
 year,  one  that  includes  maior  terrorist  initiatives
 against South Korea's leaders and stability. Simulta-
 neously, however, Pyongyang has initiated an opening
 to the United States-via Beijing-to hold uncondi-
 tional talks on a formal peace treaty, removal of US
 troops, and confederation of the two Koreas; Beijing's
 leaders support such talks but do not wish China to
 become directly involved. China's support for this
 proposal reflects its desire to reduce instability along
 its borders, and to remain the prime ally/supporter of
 North Korea. These contradictory policies on the part
 of Pyongyang are not atypical of  North Korea's
 behavior.  Thus, while progress toward a peaceful
 solution is not expected soon, we may see-for a
 while-some moderation in P'yongyang's pattern of
 violence. Should North Korea revert to an incendiary
 policy on the peninsula, this would complicate Beij-
 ing's relationships with the United States and possibly
 work to Moscow's advantage by heightening Soviet
 opportunities to compete with China for influence in
 Pyongyang.  At the same time,  however,  Moscow
 might perceive North Korean radicalism as risking a
 possible confrontation between Soviet and US military
 forces in the Korean area.
 78. It is likely that no war will break out in Korea
 during the period of this Estimate, and that both the
 USSR and China will continue to insulate their rela-
 tionships with Washington from P'yongyang's policy
 toward the south. Nevertheless, the possibilities for
 accident and miscalculation in the peninsula are con-
 siderable and could grow, particularly in the event of
 an upsurge in internal instability in South Korea.
 79. Avoidance of New Sino-Soviet Conflict in
 South and Southeast Asia. Any Sino-Soviet progress
 toward greater rapprochement could be upset by
 various possible crises to China's south:
 - The emergence of new Chinese hostilities with
 Vietnam on a serious scale, as a result of either
 maior Vietnamese military conflict with Thai-
 land, or of Vietnamese clashes with the Chinese
 in the South China Sea. The latter possibility is
 highlighted by the conflicting claims to oil explo-
 ration rights in the Gulf of Tonkin, by recent
 actions by the Chinese to strengthen their mili-
 tary position in the Paracels, and by the growing
 boldness and scope of Chinese naval and air
 deployments in the area. Both the overall Soviet
 relationship with Vietnam and the enhanced
 Soviet military presence at Cam Ranh create the
 possibility that such  a Sino-Vietnamese clash
 could spread to involve the Soviets.
 - Substantial escalation of Vietnam's military ef-
 forts in Kampuchea and along the borders of
 Thailand. The many constraints on Hanoi's limit-
 ed resources, concern over possible US and Chi-
 nese reactions, and Soviet lack of enthusiasm-
 make such actions by Vietnam improbable dur-
 ing the period of this Estimate. There is nonethe-
 less some possibility that a much greater Viet-
 namese  military  involvement  in  Kampuchea
 could arise from escalating border clashes with
 Thailand. Should these occur, the resulting crisis
 might well arrest or reverse any movement to-
 ward greater Sino-Soviet rapprochement.
 - A maior new effort by the USSR to advance its
 geopolitical position in South or Southwest Asia,
 particularly if done at the expense of Pakistan.
 The- Chinese would of course be greatly dis-
 turbed at any overt Soviet military threat to
 Pakistan arising out of that country's role in
 opposing Soviet efforts to subdue Afghanistan.
 Beijing would be equally concerned, however,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/06/07 :CIA-RDP87T00495R000900940001-8
 should the Soviet Union make significant prog-
 ress in its efforts to destabilize Pakistan and/or
 succeed in persuading India to loin in the effort.
 The Soviets have worked hard to block any
 improvement in India's relations with either
 Bening or Islamabad. Although their efforts to
 get the Indians to work iointly to undermine
 Pakistan have not been particularly successful,
 this might change if Pakistan exploded a nuclear
 device or Prime Minister Gandhi became per-
 suaded that manufacturing a "foreign threat" is
 the only way to ensure her continued political
 preeminence.
 - A Soviet effort to change the status quo in
 Pakistan and to secure a realignment of that
 country away from its present orientation toward
 China and the United States. Any such effort,
 however indirect, would be regarded in Bening
 as a serious new attack on Chinese interests. We
 consider that there is sufficient fragility in the
 present internal situation in Pakistan to make
 such a Soviet venture a fair possibility during the
 period of this Estimate, and that over the longer
 term this possibility may grow. Hence the Soviets
 may well face a choice between exploiting new
 opportunities in Pakistan, or taking a more cau-
 tious course out of regard for their relationship
 with China. Should the Soviets opt for a much
 more forward course toward Pakistan, the pres-
 ent thaw in Moscow's relations with Bening
 would be an early and definite casualty.
 80. Soviet Involvement in Major New Crises
 Elsewhere. Additional Soviet invasions or involve-
 ment in maior hostilities in the Middle East or South-
 west Asia would almost certainly reverse any move-
 ment toward significant improvement in Sino-Soviet
 relations. Such developments would cause Bening to
 back away to dissociate itself from the Soviet action-
 and reassess Chinese policy in the light of subsequent
 developments concerning the crisis or crises, Soviet
 moves, and US moves. Chinese reactions would proba-
 bly be somewhat similar, at least initially, in the event
 Soviet policy began moving toward some new version
 of armed intervention in Eastern Europe, some repeat
 of sorts of Budapest or Prague. Similar Chinese behav-
 ior would also probably occur in the event the Soviets
 got into open hostilities with Western forces, whether
 in Europe or elsewhere-in such case the Chinese
 would doubtless seek to stand clear of involvement,
 and to fish to China's benefit in the troubled waters.
 Moscow would be highly. unlikely to try to solve its
 other maior problems, foreign or domestic, by going to
 war against China; any Soviet leaders-Chernenko or
 others-would almost certainly fear that although
 their military forces could do China grievous harm,
 resort to such action might well divert Soviet attention
 from Moscow's principal antagonist, the United States,
 while possibly bogging the USSR down in war with
 China.
 81. There is an off chance that during the period of
 this Estimate the Sino-Soviet relationship could take on
 a much more hostile character than this Estimate holds
 probable:
 - This could occur because so many variables are
 present,  many of them not fully within the
 control of the present leaderships in either Mos-
 cow or Beijing: the advent of new policies on the
 part of post-Deng or post-Chernenko leaderships,
 initiatives taken by other governments (for exam-
 ple, in Korea or Vietnam), and so on.
 - It does not follow that US interests would neces-
 sarily benefit from the coming of a much more
 frigid Sino-Soviet relationship. The effect on US
 interests would depend on the nature and intensi-
 ty of the estrangement between Moscow and
 Bening: up to a point, US interests would clearly
 benefit from probable increases in Chinese coop-
 eration against Soviet policies in the world, in
 Chinese receptiveness to US advice and counsel,
 and-possibly-in willingness to permit expand-
 ed levels of Western economic and technological
 presence within China. But, if Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions deteriorated to the point of actual or threat-
 ened large-scale hostilities, US diplomatic and
 security policymaking could be greatly compli-
 cated.
 ' 82. Conversely, there is also an outside chance-
 though less likely than the above-that the Sino-Soviet
 relationship could become a much closer one during
 the period of this Estimate than we now fudge likely:
 - This might come to pass if no great disruptive
 contingencies should occur; if the Chinese should
 back away in practice-though not in  princi-
 ple-from certain of their key "demands"; if
 agreements reached on a number of secondary
 issues should begin to create a somewhat greater
 momentum toward the Sino-Soviet  rapproche-
 ment; or if for some reason Beiiing's leaders
 should come to depreciate the value of China's
 relationships with the United States.
 -The coming of significantly closer relations be-
 tween the USSR and China could seriously harm

 US interests; the warmer the Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship the more damaging to US geopolitical con-
 cerns, defense policies, targeting, alliance sys-
 tems, the role of Japan, and numerous other key
 US interests.
 83. Although the possibility cannot be excluded that
 alternative outcomes such as the above could occur in
 the Sino-Soviet relationship, we stress that the most
 likely outcome, by far, is that which this NIE has
 postulated: namely, that the level of hostility between
 Moscow and Beijing will decrease, that some addition-
 al agreements on secondary matters or possibly CBMs
 will be reached, that at most the USSR may make a
 token withdrawal of Soviet troops from Mongolia, and
 that continuing basic differences between Moscow and
 Beijing will not permit any significantly greater degree
 of rapprochement between them to develop over the
 next two to three years.

 jing  implies it has found shortcut-via  "Great
 Leap"-to full Communism.
 August-September 1958   Chinese, during Taiwan Strait crisis, find Soviet
 support to be too little and too late.
