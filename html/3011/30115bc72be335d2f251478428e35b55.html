 PEACE WILL CONQUER WAR
 The Second World Peace Congress at Warsaw
 has given mankind an historic programme of action
 to defend peace. By their establishment of the World
 Council of Peace, by their manifesto and proposals
 to enable the United Nations to fulfil the hopes
 placed in it by the peoples, and by their call to end
 the war in Korea, these representatives of 80 nations
 have manifested the resolute demand for peace of
 all people of good will.
 No government that sincerely wants peace for
 the people can refuse to support these just, reason-
 able and feasible demands.
 Backed by the over 500 millions who signed
 the Stokhoom Peace Ap real, these demands repre-
 sent the vital interests of all mankind.
 The Chinese people have expressed their firm
 support, for the activities and resolutions of the
 World ? Peace. Congress,  They are ready to work
 under the leadership of the World Peace Council.
 Over. 223.000,000 of them have signed the peace
 ;appeal. They demand their place at the U.N. pre-
 cisely to enable it to fulfil its work for peace.  In
 face of, the grave threats to peace in Asia, they have
 given substantial testimony of their will to peace.
 The. flames of war already lick the borders of
 China.  The U.S. imperialists have invaded Korea.
 Their wanton #lestructivenesr and atrocities, and
 the atrocities of their puppets and allies - for which
 they and their British and other satellites cannot
 escape  responsibility - sicken  the  conscience  of
 mankind.  The U.S. imperialists have seized the
 Chinese, island of Taiwan and sent their fleet, re-
 inforced by their accomplices, to protect the remnant
 Chiang Kai-shek clique there; U.S. planes have
 violated China's. northeastern frontiers to bomb and
 strafe. the people.  America also interferes against
 the democratic movement in Viet-Nam.
 China knows that these are all parts of a single
 strategic plan to smash the national liberation move-
 ments in the colonies and semi-colonies, to attack
 the vital centres of human freedom and achieve
 American world domination.
 The Cl inepe people have therefore reacted to
 these threats to peacein the Far East with resolute
 major contribution to the cause of
 action.  In' a
 peace and to check the spread of war, the Chinese
 people's volunteers fighting alongside the deathless
 patriots of Korean People's Army have already given
 pause to the armies of the U.S. gangsters who have
 run amok in. Korea.  The PLA is now marching to
 liberate Tibet, re-unite it with the mother country,
 and prevent it'from ever again being used as'a nest
 of imperialist intrigue or a springboard of aggres-
 sion against the rest of China or the USSR.  Steps
 to liberate Taiwan, solemn warnings to the French
 colonialists against further outrageous -intrusions
 across the Viet-Nam-China border, full support of
 the Soviet Union's note on the illegal release of
 Japanese war 'criminals by MacArthur and the in-
 tensified activity of the whole people in peaceful
 construction - all these are part of the contribution
 of the Chinese People's Republic to the fight for
 peace, to defeat any aggression and preparations
 for aggressive war.
 As the frustrated warmongers are forced the
 more fully to expose their vile purposes to the world,
 and as they extend the scope of their adventurist
 acts, it becomes ever more clear that the fight against
 aggression is the fight for peace. Unless the flames
 of war are smothered, wherever they are kindled they
 will spread. 'The present action of the Chinese volun-
 teers is of crucial importance for peace throughout
 the world.  They have thwarted the insolent attempt
 of the warmongers to use the Hitler method of
 attacking their victims one by one while preventing
 the peace-loving forces by lies, threats and blackmail
 from giving timely aid to each other.
 It is not to be imagined that either the Korean
 or the Chinese people will permit themselves to be
 thrust back into the bloody hell of colonialism. The
 Japanese fascists suffered catastrophe in their at-
 tempt to subjugate these countries.  But if the
 lesson of history is not enough for their U.S. succes-
 sors, they will certainly get some'further practical
 instructions of the type they have already received.
 Before they further rouse the anger of the great
 475,000,000 Chinese people, let the U.S. imperialists
 pause at the thought that, unless they withdraw now,
 and permit a peaceful settlement of the Korean ques-
 tion, they have already committed several scores of
 thousands of their troops to a protracted war in
 Korea. ? And it would be as well for the U.S. satel-
 lites in Downing Street and elsewhere to consider
 whither their servility to their American masters is
 leading them.
 The Chinese volunteers and the $PA are in the
 front line of the struggle for world peace.  If the
 U.S. aggressors were to succeed in their adventure
 here, they would be encouraged to try the same tech-
 nique in any other place of their own choosing.
 But the initiative is in the hands of the peace
 forces.  This is the message of the Warsaw Con-
 gress, inspired by the calm confidence+ of Soviet
 Union and the People's Republic of China, and their
 refusal to be diverted from their peaceful purposes
 by repeated provocations of the warmongers around

 their borders.  This is the forebearance of strength
 born of confidence in the millions of men and women
 who detest war and who want to build, not destroy.
 With this mighty support the World Peace Con-
 gress speaks with authority, reinforcing the con-
 fidence of partisans of peace the world over.
 "Let us join our efforts and demand an end to
 the war which is devastating Korea today and which
 threatens to set the whole world aflame tomorrow!
 It is useless to wait for peace - peace must be won!"
 Peace can be won by the united strength and
 initiative of the peoples.  Peace shall be won.
 The Trumans, Churchills, Attlees and Bevins
 know well the attractive force of such an appeal to
 the reason, conscience and vital interests of man-
 kind.  That is why they strove so hard and so basely
 to prevent the holding of this congress for peace.
 But the will of the people for peace cannot be thus
 frustrated. The Congress was held with even greater
 publicity for its aims in Warsaw.
 The effort for peace, however, must be sustained.
 It must not be thought that a victory for the peace
 forces on one front alone will deter the warmongers.
 Fevereishly re-arming the remnant forces of fascism
 in Western Germany and Japan, they are preparing
 new adventures in Europe as well as in Asia.  But
 each new victory for peace serves to mobilise and con-
 solidate the peace forces.  The peace front headed
 by the great Soviet Union is already stronger than
 the imperialist camp.  Each new victory for peace
 will still further increase that superiority until the
 unleashing of another world war becomes too risky
 a gamble even for such inveterate gamblers as those
 of Wall Street.                        '
 Free Tibet from Imperialist Intrigues
 The greatest elation has been aroused through-
 out China by the news of the progress made in the
 liberation of Tibet.  The Tibetans themselves show
 their joy by the enthusiastic support, they give to
 the People's Liberation Army on its march to Lhasa.
 At long last, Tibet will be freed from imperialist
 interference and exploitation.
 Balked of their prey, the imperialists are making
 last minute attempts to obstruct this act which will
 complete the liberation of continental China. The hos-
 tile moves by the Anglo-American bloc in recent weeks
 in regard to Tibet have naturally been co-ordinated
 with- the other campaigns of slanders and aggres-
 sions, by the American warmongers in Korea, Tai-
 wan, Viet-Nam and elsewhere fir Asia.  Even to the
 Roof of the World, Washington pursues its now well
 advertised plot of encirclement against the Chinese
 People's Republic.
 The American imperialists have instigated one
 of their pocket satellites - El Salvador - to bring
 what they call the "question" of. Tibet before the
 United Nations.  NQ words need be wasted on the
 Salvadorean "proposals," if only because such an
 attempt flagrantly violates Articles II of the United
 Nations  Charter prohibiting intervention in the
 internal affairs of sovereign states.  One may recall,
 however, that this is not the first time the ruling
 clique of El Salvador has conspired against the'
 Chinese people for the sake of a few dollars.  In
 1934, the El Salvador marionettes "recognised" the
 Japanese puppet state of "Manchukuo" and describ-
 ed this outrageous act as "purely a matter of busi-
 ness, an outgrowth of El Salvador's acute need of
 new `markets for her coffee."
 In effecting the liberation of Tibet, the Central
 People';s  Government is exercising its sovereign
 rights over its own territory.  It will, therefore,
 tolerate no interference in this from any quarter. It
 Approved For Release 2001/12/04
 is of course not surprising that the aggressive
 Anglo-American bloc shows their fangs over libera-
 tion of an area which these, blood-thirsty warmongers
 were aiming to develop as a base for renewed aggres-
 ,sion against China, but it would be most regrettable
 if any Asian nation laying claim to independence of
 action, should be so misled as to attempt to obstruct
 the Chinese people in fulfilling their sacred task of
 emancipating Tibet.
 As the Central People's Government of China
 showed by its patience -in awaiting the Tibetan
 peace delegates, it appreciates the fact that be-
 cause  of its proximity, India  naturally  desires
 to see peace reign in Tibet, but equally, India
 should appreciate the fact that the speedy liberation
 of Tibet from the orbit of imperialist intrigues will,
 in the first place, guarantee security and peace in
 Tibet. China is, therefore, reluctant to believe that
 India might lend herself to the sinister Anglo-Ameri-
 can influences now working against the legitimate
 interests of the Chinese people.
 We cherish the friendship that has been develop-
 ing with the Indiaq people who are also struggling
 for complete elnancipation from imperialist intrigues.
 If China hopes and believes that India' will not be-
 come, in regard to Tibet, a cat's paw of the Anglo?-
 American imperialist bloc against Chnia, it is be-
 cause the Chinese people have faith in the value
 of the costly lessons that both peoples have learnt
 from the oppressidhs of the imperialists.  It is also
 because the Chinese people believe that India will
 understand that it is to their mutual interests, as
 it is of all 'Asian nations and progressive peoples,
 that imperialism should be ended forever in Asia.
 All those truly desirous of peace will hail the heroic
 PLA marching to fulfil its historic mission oflibera-
 tion in the very heart of Asia which will deprive
 the imperialists of yet another base of the projected
 encirclement of, China

 MANIFESTO TO THE PEOPLES
 OF THE WORLD
 -- Adopted by the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw --
 W a r                         'threatens
 mankind - children,
 women and men.   The
 United Nations is not
 justifying the  hopes,
 placed in it by the peo-
 ples  of                        maintaining
 peace and tranquillity.
 The lives of people and
 the achievements  of
 human culture are in
 danger.
 The  peoples                      are
 willing to hope that
 the United Nations will
 resolutely turn back to
 those principles  on
 which it was created
 after the Second World
 War in order to ensure
 freedom, peace and  mutual respect
 among nations.  But the peoples of the
 world rely still more upon themselves,
 upon their own determination and good
 will. It is clear to every sensible person
 that whoever states that "war is inevit-
 able," slanders mankind.
 In reading this message of the
 Second World Peace Congress in War .
 saw,- adopted on behalf of the peoples
 of SO countries, remember that the
 struggle for peace is your own vital in-
 terest, know that hundreds of millions
 of champions of peace unite to stretch
 out their hands to you and call upon
 you* to take part in. the roost noble..
 ? struggle ever waged by mankind, firmly
 . confident of its outcome.
 It is useless to wait for peace -
 peace must be won.  Let us unite our
 efforts and demand the termination
 of the war which is devastating Korea
 today and which threatens to set the
 whole world aflame tomorrow.
 Let us oppose the
 attempts to kindle war
 again in Germany and
 in Japan.
 'In unity with 500
 million  people    who
 have signed the Stock-
 holm peace appeal we
 demand :   Prohibition
 of the atomic weapon,
 universal disarmament
 and control over these
 measures.  It is tech-
 nically   possible                                                                                    to
 secure strict  control
 over  universal   dis-
 armament and destruc-
 tion of atomic .weapons.
 All that is necessary is
 the will to do it.
 Let us compel the adoption of laws
 which make war propaganda a punish-
 able offence.  Let us present our pro-
 posals for the defence of peace - drawn
 up by the Second World Peace Congress
 - to members of our parliaments, to,
 our governments and to the United
 Nations.
 United, the peace forces in all coun-
 tries are strong enough, the voices of
 the people of the world ate loud enough
 to insist on bringing about the meeting
 of representatives of the Five Great
 Powers.
 The Second World Peace Congress
 has proved more forcefully than ever
 before that people from all parts of the
 globe can agree among themselves in
 spite of differing viewpoints to -avert
 the disaster of war and ' to maintain
 peace.
 Let governments act in the same
 way and. the cause of peace will be
 saved.'

 other countries of the East have travelled over 10,000
 kilometers in order to reach Europe. Originally, we
 intended to go to Sheffield and shake hands with
 the British people. This was not possible. However,
 we are now welcomed in Warsaw.
 Even in the East we have heard about the exist-
 ence of some kind of "iron curtain." However, on
 our way from Siberia to Eastern Europe we saw no
 iron curtain.  It is only over the English Channel
 that we eventually discovered it.
 The British government in fact has prevented
 the peoples of various countries from meeting the
 British people.  The British government, because it
 is afraid of peace, has put obstacles in the way of
 the peace movement.  There is, however, nothing
 strange about this action from the viewpoint of the
 peoples of the East.  Indeed, at present, in our part
 of the world, the aggressive bloc headed by Ameri-
 ca'n imperialism has passed beyond the. stage of
 simply creating obstacles in the way of the peace
 cause to the direct violation of peace itself, from
 war cries to aggression itself.  The adventurous
 aggressive war of the American imperialists in
 Korea. has already approached the Chinese-Korean
 frontier.  The United States of America, simultane-
 ously with its aggression in Korea, seized our island
 of Taiwan.  Its planes have in addition invaded our
 Northeast, the coastal areas of Shantung Province,
 and Shantung Province itself, wantonly strafing and
 bombing    our  territory.   The  United  States  of
 America openly interferes in the national liberation
 struggle of the peoples of Viet-Nam, the Philippines
 and other countries in Southeast Asia and ruthless-
 ly suppresses this struggle.
 "Favours" of the "Good American Friends"
 The American imperialists whn are all the while
 planning aggression and interference in the internal
 affairs of other states, hypocritically declare that
 other states are carrying out aggression. Thus, they
 presumptuously assert that the Koreans are carry-
 ing out aggression, on Korea, that the Chinese are
 carrying out aggression on the Chinese island of
 Taiwan.  Thus, the American imperialists set'them-
 selves up as the "saviours of peace." They call their
 aggression moral assistance, and their establishment
 of world domination-a; favour.
 Mo-jo
 Thus, if you are speaking of the defence of
 peace and security, they also speak of the f`defeence
 of peace and security."  If you are speaking of
 fighting for freedom and democracy, they also speak
 of "fighting for freedom and democracy," and in so
 doing they contend that only their freedom and demo--
 Messrs. Truman and Acheson recently stated,
 - didn't they-that they were good friends of the
 peoples of the East.  You see, they claim that not
 only Are they good friends but great saviours of the
 peoples of the East as well!
 For 50 years our country was the victim of the
 continuogs  aggression of  Japanese  imperialism.
 After eight years of a strenuous defensive war, we
 finally succeeded in routing the Japanese imperial-
 ists.
 In the early part of the difficult Anti-Japanese
 War, the first and only country to help us was the
 Soviet Union.  What= was the United States of
 America doing then?  During that period, it traded
 with the Japanese, selling them huge quantities of
 scrap metal, petrol, cotton and equipment, thereby
 enabling the Japanese to massacre our people and
 causing us inestimable losses in manpower and pro-
 perty.  This is what the "good American friends"
 call a "great favour."
 After . Japan's surrender, the Chinese people
 longed for peaceful construction.  But the American
 imperialists supported the Kuomintang gangsters in
 every way.  They did everything to help Chiang
 Kai-shek, providing him with planes, guns, tanks,
 warships, dollars and equipment, and American mill-
 ,tart' surplus material.  They secured, with Chiang
 Kai-shek's help, special privileges on land, sea and
 in the air which grossly violated our sovereignty.
 They manoeuvred Chiang Kai-shek into unleashing a
 civil war and dooming the Chinese people to four
 more years of sufferings.  This indeed was what the
 "good American friends" call a "great favour."
 And now, is it not the "good American friends"
 who still support Chiang . Kai-shek?  Is it not these
 same "good American friends  who, having been
 routed on China's mainland, grabbed our island of
 Taiwan and advanced their so-called defence line to
 the Taiwan . Strait? - Japanese imperialism is our
 sworn enemy.  Nevertheless., protected and nurtui-dd
 by the "good American friends," Japanese imperial-
 ism is rapidly 'reassuming its warlike countenance.
 This is what the "good American friends" call .a

 Lording it over the United Nations, the United
 States of America, converting the United Nations
 into its ,owns private domain, is utilising the United
 Nations as a' mask for its own criminal actions.
 The United States supports the Chiang Kai-shek re-
 presentative in the United Nations as the representa-
 tive of the Chinese people, although he is not sup-
 ported by a single Chinese.  The United States
 stubbornly refuses to grant the People's Republic
 of China the right to send the legal representative
 of the Chinese people to the United Nations.  This
 is what the "good American friends" call a "great
 favour."
 Of course, the "good American friends" may
 arrogantly say, "We respect the use of demeepatic
 methods. for settling questions, all United Nations
 decisions are based on the principle of the sub-
 ordination of the minority to 'the majority."  All
 right, then.  If we take figures, however, we shall
 easily expose the American voting machine. The
 total population of states which are members of the
 United Nations is 1,850 millions.  If the decision of
 the majority is to be respected, is it not necessary
 while voting to take' into, account the size of the
 population represented by the vote? . Yet Chiang
 Kai-shek's delegate, who'represents only himself and
 a handful of.reactionaries, has a vote in the United
 Nations whereas the' 475 million people of the Chin-
 ese People's Republic have none.  And this is called
 tie democratic metho
 d for settling questions.
 The American imperialists desecrate the United
 Nations. Thus, by their criminal aggressive actions
 in, Korea they have made of the United Nations
 flag a rag to hide their shame.  This is indeed a
 monstrous insult to 1,850 million people.
 American aggressive troops have already cross-
 ed the 38th Parallel, seized Pyongyang and Wonsan
 and approached the bank of the Yalu River.  Ameri-
 can planes daily bomb peaceful towns and villages
 in  North  Korea,  machine-gunning  the     civilian
 population -old people,-women and children. More-
 over, they have repeatedly crossed the Yalu River,
 and barbarously bombed and strafed our Northeast
 and Shantung Province.  This is precisely what the
 "good American friends" call a "great favour" to
 the peoples of the East.
 Naturally, we speak here of the American im-
 perialists and not of the American people.  The
 American people are as peace-loving as the peoples
 of other countries, as peace-loving as the Chinese

 The "Sun' of Happiness" is Rising in Tibet
 Yu Shah
 There is an ancient parable in a Tibetan scrip-
 ~ure that foretells of the coming of a new life out
 of the far north, a life without exploitation, injus-
 tice, sorrow or fear.  People will live in plenty and
 this new life will spread over the whole world and
 then there will be no war.  The sun of happiness,
 it says, will shine forth over the land and the club
 of sorrow will be cast forever into the waters.
 Sorrow and oppression have indeed been the
 lot of the Tibetan people. Tibet is not the Shangri-
 la of romancers.  It is a land of serfs, of Voverty
 and illiteracy.  Nomad 'cattle breeding and, in the
 south,  agriculture  are  the  principal  pursuits.
 Modern industry is almost non-existent and the
 abundant natural resources hardly touched. Because
 of its position, it has long been the target of im-
 perialist oppression                            and  intrigue.   And   foreign
 interference helped to hol,back the fore@s of pro-
 gress.
 Over #he past two centuries, British imperialism
 Pad,  more  recently, American imperialism     have
 worked and schemed to wrest this part of China
 from its mother country; they imposed their influence
 there with, the aid of backward forces and in recent
 years prepared to use it. as a base for their designs
 on China and the Soviet Union.
 Yet, despite all their efforts, the close unity of
 Tibet with the rest of China has withstood all trials.
 lend now Tibet is being re-united with its mother-
 land.  What some British' geographers call "the
 Dead Heart of Asia" is pulsing with renewed life.
 The Chinese People's Liberation Army is over-
 Tming  seemingly
 impossible difficul-
 ties and bringing
 liberation  and  a
 new  life to   the
 ~iibetan people. The
 Tibetan people are
 taking their future
 ipto   their   own
 hands and, ridding
 themselves of the
 vicious influence of
 British and Ameri-
 can imperialism.
 As early as 461
 A.D., the marriage
 of the Tibetan ruler
 to  a princess  of
 China drew the two
 kingdoms close.- To
 this day in Lhasa
 stands a pillar of
 stone on w
 hick is
 carved the treaty made between the rulers of
 Tibet and China in the eighth century, "uniting
 their kingdoms."  When Kublai Khan, successor
 to  the  legendary Genghis      Khan,  became  Em-
 peror  of  China  in the  13th                                                                                 century,  Tibetans
 were ranked as second of the four classes of sub-
 jects in China.                                                                                He entrusted the administration of
 Tibet to the head lama of the monastery of Sa-Kya.
 The tile of "Dalai" Lama, given to the political head
 of the Buddhist church, is in fact a Mongol title. But
 the central Chinese government controlled the collec-
 tion of taxes through its ambans, or local governors,
 and endorsed the appointment of the Dalai Lama.
 In modern tunes, , a number of international
 agreements  embody  the,  recognition  of  China's
 sovereignty in Tibet.  Both Britain and Tsarist
 Russia, for example, acknowledged Tibet to be part
 of Chink when they signed the agreement of 1907.
 Even at the Conference of Simla in 1913, when the
 British forced the Chinese delegation to sign a draft
 agreement involving serious encroachment on China's
 sovereignty in Tibet, the British dared not declare
 the severance of Tibet from China.  And though
 the Chinese government was under Yuan Shih-kai
 who had treacherously accepted the notorious 21
 Demands of the Japanese imperialists, yet it dis-
 avowed its representatives and did not ratify the
 Simla draft agreement, so great was the anger of
 the Chinese people.
 On the founding of the Republic of China, Dr.
 Sun Yat-sen declared immediately that the Tibetan
 people were among the five major nationalities of
 China, and Tibet remained part of China even

 Consultative Conference in Peking in 1949.  They
 ,took part in the declaration of the People's Republic
 of China and in the drawing up of the Common Pro-
 gramme which instructed the new People's , Govern-
 ment to "liberate all the territory of China and ac-
 complish the task of unifying China."
 It is not only politically that the Tibetans are
 linked with China.  Communication in economic,
 cultural and religious life has never been inter-
 rupted.  Caravans cro$s the deserts and mountain

 lamas live in Sikang, Szechuan and other provinces.
 The Chinese and Tibetan languages have much in
 common,  Buddhism found its way along the routes
 from Tibet and spread through. China.
 In fact, Tibet has never been isolated from the
 rest of China.  The reputation for isolation that
 -Tibet still- has in foreign countries results from the
 deliberate political policy adopted in the 19th cen-
 tury as a defence', against the grasping hands of
 foreigners, particularly the British.  It was an
 isolation from foreign intrusion alone.
 British Intrigues
 Hitler learned much from the methods of the
 British, imperialists towards countries which they
 wished to grab.  In Tibet, too,. ever since Warren
 Hastings began to push British interests, after the
 conquest of India and Burma, British imperialism
 used all its armoury of wiles and brutality to subdue
 the area.  It sent din armies, made offers of trade,
 fomented si strife among various groups of Buddhist
 priests and, above all, strove to foster in Tibet an
 antipathy towards China, using reactionary circles
 to put forward demands for so-called "independence."
 In 1790, the Gurkhas of Nepal, who had invaded
 Tibet- with British encouragement, were driven out
 by a joint force of Chinese and Tibetans.  It was
 clear to the 1Tibetans that, they were now to be
 exposed to all kinds of new pressures.  They agreed
 to close their frontiers and allow all foreign ques-
 tions to be dealt with directly by the ambans.
 By the end of the 19th century, despite all their
 efforts, including military invasion in 1888, Britian
 only succeeded in annexing Sikkim and Bhutan,
 south of the Himalayas.  But in 1904, taking advan-
 tage of the Russo-Japanese War, British troops
 under Colonel Younghusband invaded in strength,
 well knowing that now the Manchu government in
 Peking was too weak to protect the Tibetans.
 The Tibetans put up a stiff resistance.  They.
 fought heroically with their matchlocks and spears,
 but could not withstand the British guns.  Killing,
 pillaging and burning their way forward, destroying
 many monasteries, the British expedition arrived in
 Lhasa, travelling by routes carefully spied out for
 them by missionaries, explorers  and merchants.
 Large quantities of invaluable curios and precious
 removed to grace the residences of the British colon-
 ialists in India.
 But the Tibetans were never subdued.  The '
 expedition could not maintain itself in Lhasa. Britain
 was forced in 1906 to renounce the "treaty" imposed

 PROCLAMATION
 ON TIBET
 Here is the main part of a proclamation
 issued jointly by the Southwest Military and
 Administrative Committee and the PLA South-
 west Military Command on Nov. 9, 1950:
 "With serious concern for the people of
 Tibet, who have suffered long years of oppres-
 sion under the American and British imperial-
 ists and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary govern-
 ment, Chairman Mao Tse-tung of the Central
 People's Government and Commander-in-Chief
 Chu Teh of the People's Liberation Army
 ordered the PLA troops to enter Tibet for the
 purpose of assisting the Tibetan people to
 -free themselves from oppression forever.
 "All the Tibetan people, including all
 lamas, should now create rt solid unity to give
 the PLA adequate assistance in ridding Tibet
 of imperialist influence and establishing re-
 gional self-government for the Tibetan people.
 They should, at the same time, build fraternal
 relations, on the basis of friendship and mutual
 help, with other nationalities within the coun-
 try and together construct a new Tibet within
 New China.
 "With the entry of the PLA into Tibet;
 the life and property of Tibetan lamas and
 people will be protected.  Freedom of religious
 belief will be safeguarded, and lama temples
 will be protected.  Assistance will be rendered
 to the Tibetan people in the direction of deve-
 loping their educational, agricultural, pastoral,
 industrial  and commercial  enterprises,  and
 their living conditions will be improved.   No
 change will be made in the existing admini-
 strative and military systems of Tibet., The
 existing Tibetan troops will become a part of
 the national defence forces of the People's
 Republic of China.  All lamas, officials and
 chieftains may remain at their posts.  Matters
 relating to reforms in Tibet will be handled
 completely in accordance with the will of the
 Tibetan people and by means of consultation
 between the Tibetan people and the Tibetan
 leaders.  Pro-imperialist and KMT officials,

 Into the Boots, of Japanese. Imperialism
 C. C. Fang
 When Japanese imperialism capitulated to the
 United Nations in 1945, the Asian peoples had high
 hones of achieving their just demands for national
 liberation.  They had contributed no small measure,
 of blood and treasure to that victory.  The older
 imperialist Powers - Britain, France and the Nether-
 lands - were too exhausted to resume immediately
 their "White Man's Burden."
 But no sooner had the instrument of Japanese
 surrender been signed than Asia found that the
 representatives of Wall Street had stepped into the
 jack-boots of Japanese imperialism.
 In South Korea, the Philippines, Indo-China,
 Indonesia and Malaya, the great hope of early
 liberation was shattered by imperialist repressions
 financed, co-ordinated and, to a large extent, armed
 ,by the U.S.A., But, like their Japanese predecessors,
 the  Americans  concentrated  their  major  effort
 against China and, like them too, it was here that
 they suffered  their biggest defeat. The U.S.-
 sponsored Chiang Kai-shek regime was, in U. S.
 Secretary of State Acheson's own words, "repudiated
 by the Chinese people."
 The establishment of the Central People's Gov-
 ernment an October 1, 1949, ended that chapter of
 American  intervention  in  China.   The  people's
 nation-wide victory pmashed the immediate U.S.
 hope of dominating China's strategic bases and re-
 sources through the hands of its KMT puppet.
 The events of the last year, however, have shown
 that American imperialism is loathe to give up the
 major aim in Asia.  Thus, the record of post-war
 U.S. imperialism in regard to China is well worth-
 ,while recapitulating at this stage because it reveals
 some of the typical methods of American imperial-
 ism.  It shows with what malevolent cunning and
 doggedness it has pursued its aims and why the de-
 feat of its favourite lackey has now. forced it to
 carry out its aggression openly with its own troops
 and such of its satellites as it can muster.
 By V-J Day, the democratic elements in China
 led by the Chinese Communist Party - the backbone.
 of the resistance movement - had grown into a
 powerful force in a territory with a population of
 over 100 millions.' It was, therefore, clear to the
 reactionaries that imperialist rule could only be
 restored over all. China, if the Chinese Communist
 Party were destroyed together with the Eighth
 Route and New Fourth Armies and their auxiliaries
 - the armed forces of the people.
 ,)'he Choice is Ours-- Acheson
 In the U.S. State Department's White Paper of
 August, 1949, Acheson mentions three alternatives
 .for U.S. policy towards China in this post-war
 period:   "(1) it could have pulled out lock, stock
 and barrel; (2) it could have intervened. militarily
 on a major scale' to assist the Nationalists destroy
 the Communists; (3) it could, while assisting the
 Nationalists to assert their authority over as much
 of China as possible, endeavour to avoid a civil war
 by working for a compromise between the two sides."
 The U.S. chose the second alternative under the
 guise of the third.  In grder "to destroy the Corn-
 munists" - who at the 'time of the Japanese sur-
 render led the population of an area stretching from
 the Northeast to Central China and a considerable
 part of South China and Hainan Island-it was
 necessary to move. the Chiang Kai-shek troops as
 quickly as possible to take over major centres direct
 from the Japanese and "inherit" these bases for the
 coming all-out offensive against the popular forces.
 Time was against them, so the Americans had re-
 course to a characteristically base political trick.
 The Liberated Areas were invited tot a conference
 to "discuss matters of national importance."  U.S.
 Ambassador Hurley himself flew to Yenan to press
 the invitation.  But, as Chiang Kai-shek later made
 clear, this invitation was a gesture aimed only to
 gain time for deployment of his attacking, troops.
 The failure of negotiations, which he could of course

 ensure, would be the pretext for launching his "puni-
 tive expedition" against fhe' Liberated Areas. .
 Eager to explore every method , off, achieving a
 peaceful development for China,. the Chinese Com-
 munist Party, while by no means blind to the re-
 actionaries' deceptions, accepted the invitation.  On
 August 25, 1945, it published its statement on how
 peace could be achieved, and a few days later Chair-
 man Mao Tse-tung himself flew to Chungking. Thus
 the reactionaries' bluff was called and Chiang and
 his American masters were forced to expose them-
 selves' to the Chinese people in all their hypocrisy.
 Chiang raised one transparent excuse'after an-
 other to prevent agreement being reached, and the
 negotiations dragged on from August 28 to October
 10. During these seven weeks, the United States as-
 sisted Chiang Kai-shek to mobilise 800,000 troops
 into positions for the offensive against the People's
 Army. The entire U.S. Air Transport Command and
 all its available naval vessels in China were diverted
 to taking KMT troops to Central, North and North-
 east China.  The New 6th Army, the. 94th Army,
 the 74th Army, and the 93rd Army were immediate-
 ly rushed from various points in South and South-
 China to Shanghai and Nanking, thence to
 west
 North and eventually to Northeast China.  A. C.
 Wedemeyer, then U.S. Commander-in-Chief in China,
 boasted that "this has been the greatest movement
 of troops by air in history."
 Actions Louder Than Words--Acheson
 Before the negotiations in Chungking were 1 nal-
 ly broken off, the initial batch of the KMT troops
 had been moved to the various war fronts.  Troop
 movements continued into the next year.  In early
 November, 1945, 31 American naval transports took
 KMT troops to Chingwangtao in North China;
 U.S. naval vessels and marines covered the landing
 of the KMT 8th Army at Tsingtao - the first move
 in the attempted 'liquidation of the people's forces
 in Shantung; the KMT 53rd. and 54th Armies were
 flown in Julie, 1946, to Northeast China.  Thus in
 nine months alone' from September, 1945 to June,
 1946, over 540,000 KMT troops were deployed for
 battle by American transports and most of the troops
 were American armed and trained.
 But this was not all. American units themselves
 landed in force at Tsingtao, Chefoo, Weihaiwei and
 later at Shanghai and Tientsin.  U.S. forces extend-
 ed. their operations to Nanking and other major
 cities as, well as along important sections and at
 junctions of the Shanghai-Nanking and Peking-Sui-
 yuan. Railways.  A large American force with trains,
 planes and artillery virtually controlled Peking.
 U.S. officers were attached to all of Chiang Kai-
 shek's' forward units in the capacity of "advisers."
 Including naval forces and marines, the U.S.
 forces participating in the civil war on Chiang Kai-
 shek's  side numbered over 113,000 men.   More
 American troops were deployed in China after the end
 of the war with Japan than at any time when the
 battle against the Japanese fascists was at its height.
 And yet throughout this early period of preparation
 for civil war, the Americans were telling the world
 that they were "mediating" between the Liberated
 Areas and the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship, that
 they had no intention of "getting involved" and so
 forth.
 The U.S. war-time Chief-of-Staff General Mar-
 shall was at this time in charge of this "mediation"
 in China.  It was he who authorised the turning
 over of huge U.S. war surplus stores to' Chiang and
 the despatch of new arms from the United States.
 It was he who negotiated the Truce Agreement be-
 tween the People's Armies and the KMT which ex-
 cluded from its operations the Northeast where
 the U.S. had assisted Chiang to move up an over-
 whelmingly large and well equipped force. Marshall
 helped to drag out Chiang's phoney peace and truce
 negotiations for months while U.S. armaments and
 supplies poured in for the KMT armies.  The U.S.
 imperialists calculated that once the people's forces
 were destroyed in the Northeast, the KMT could
 make short work of the People's Army south of the
 Great Wall.  The Americans correctly estimated the
 strategic importance of the Northeast, but it was not
 the People's Army, but Chiang Kai-shek who was
 kicked out of the Northeast.  This defeat was deci-
 sive for the outcome of the People's War of Libera-
 tion. 1.

 Victory on the Cotton
 Su Tuan
 With steady gains reported all along the nation's
 economic front, the rehabilitation and development
 of the cotton industry was to he expected. Never-
 theless, the speed and degree of rehabilitation have
 been impressive even for New China. Set goals have
 been met and even surpassed. Just as the People's
 Government successfully solved the much mooted
 problem of China's food shortages, by encouraging
 production among the enthusiastic liberated peasan-
 try, so has it tackled the problem of raising produc-
 tion in the cotton industry.  Results have been so
 encouraging that the day is now in sight when each
 one of China's 475 millions will have enough to wear.
 According to the latest estimates, 700,000 tons
 of ginned cotton have been harvested this autumn.
 The goal set by the government early in 1950 for
 this year was 650,000 tons.  Figures for the present
 year outstrip the average yield for the five years
 preceding the Anti-Japanese War when the area
 planted to cotton was largest.  This means that
 China's textile mills are in the main assured of
 adequate supplies of raw materials.  And this will
 also reduce urban unemployment.
 It was in April of this year - at the time wheh
 the cotton planting season was about to start-
 that the All-China Federation of Labour called for
 emergency help for 100,000 jobless workers in Shang-
 hai.  One reason for this unemployment was the
 difficulties which the textile mills, the most important
 Shanghai industry, faced  through lack  of raw
 materials.  Many of the spinning and weaving shops
 which once worked day and night were forced to
 operate on reduced shifts.. Some mills suspended
 operations altogether.
 This distressing situation was not peculiar to
 Shanghai.   Textile mills in other cities faced the
 same problem.  Of the 5,200,000 spindles which
 China has, about 4,200,000 were then in operation.
 But the ginned cotton was far from sufficient to feed
 all these spindles.
 The cotton `industry, like other Chinese indus-
 tries, was until recently semi-colonial in nature in
 its dependence on foreign sources for raw, materials
 and markets.  Figures in the following table show
 how China in the past depended on foreign cotton,
 ehiefly American, to run its textile industry.

 1949   ......................     51,627.40
 In the early part of 1950, a small amount had
 to be imported until New China's first cotton harvest
 Front
 could be gathered. This year, with the cotton
 harvest estimated at. 700,000 tons, the problem of
 an adequate supply of raw cotton is nearing solu-
 tion.  This means that. the textile mills, as well as
 a number of other industries connected with spin-
 ning and weaving, can face the future on a sound
 basis. With the foreign exchange saved as a result
 of the sharp reduction of cotton imports, it will be
 possible to purchase machines to speed up the coun-
 try's industrialisation.
 When the. Central People's
 Government drew up its over-
 all plan for agricultural pro-
 duction at the beginning of
 1950, many people thought that
 the target of 650,000 tons of
 ginned cotton was too high.
 To fully appreciate what the completion and over-
 fulfilment of this target means, the results must
 be viewed against the terrible destruction which
 war brought to the cotton-growing areas and the
 deliberate  KMT-planned  disasters,  such  as  the
 breaching of dykes.  `
 During the five years immediately preceding the
 Anti-Japanese War, the average cotton output was
 approximately 638,000 tons per year.  But it drop-
 ped steadily until 1949 when the total harvest was
 only 425,000 tons.
 This was due, first of all, to' the dumping of
 imported cotton and the resulting low price for
 home-grown cotton.  For one pound of cotton in
 1936, a peasant could buy 11 pounds of millet.  But
 this ratio fell drastically in the years from 1938 to
 1943 until it reached 1:5.  At this 'point, it was
 simply not worth the farmers' while to plant cotton.
 After the Japanese surrender in 1945, the KMT
 threw the market wide open to the Americans.    The.
 bureaucratic capitalists, moreover, bought whatever
 cotton the peasants still grew at arbitrarily low
 prices.  The result was that the area planted to
 cotton shrank rapidly.
 Another reason for the sharp decrease in the
 size of the cotton-growing area was the food short-
 age caused by the protracted war.  Without enough
 grain to eat, the peasants had'to reducethe area
 planted to cotton so that more food could be raised.
 In addition to all this, there were war-time
 shortages of manpower and draught animals, fre-
 quent floods, droughts and plagues of pests.  Then,
 too, there was a breakdown . of trade between the
 countryside and the cities.  It was, therefore, not
 strange that the total cotton yield as well as the
 output per hectare diminished each year.  In Shensi,
 for example, the cotton-growing area was reduced
 by 65 per cent during the past five years.

 In the new society emerging after liberation
 we have an altogether different situation.  Targets
 set by the overall national plan were increased by
 the local governments and then expanded further
 by the farmers themselves at the time of sowing.
 The harvested areas for cotton this year is estimated
 at around 3,373,000 hectares, or 12 per cent above.
 the government target.
 Why has there been this victory?  Why have
 the farmers been enthusiastic about growing cotton?
 Why, for example, has the cotton area in Hopei
 Province increased from 660,000 hectares last year
 to 980,000 this year?  And why has the area planted
 to.cotton in Northeast China increased by 280 per
 cent since liberation - larger than the record cotton.
 area under Japanese occupation?
 The reasons for the the victory are found in the
 following factors:
 (1)  the War of Liberation being practidally com-
 pleted, peasants have been released from war-time
 duties. With land reform already carried out in the
 old liberated areas and rent reduction in the newly
 liberated areas, peasants have shown a new zeal for
 production.'  And this enthusiasm has raised their
 production levels.
 (2) In addition to the general enthusiasm and
 higher political consciousness resulting from the
 government's overall policy, the Central People's
 Government has paid special attention to the estab-
 lishment of a reasonable ratio between cotton and
 grain prices in order to raise. the peasants' interest
 in planting cotton.  The planting of cotton has been
 made more profitable than the planting ' of grain.
 In some areas, contracts were drawn up between
 farmers and state trading companies, whereby the
 former were guaranteed manufactured goods in
 advance of payment against the cotton harvest.  The
 government has also announced that cotton, as well
 as grain, can be used to pay agricultural taxes-in-
 kind.
 (3)  In sharp contrast to the KMT, the People's
 Government l}as seriously tackled the water con-
 servancy problem.  The anti-flood campaign was on
 a vast scale.  In building dykes and canals alone,
 360,000,000 cubic metres of earth were moved.  Corn-
 ssoAOO
 suo,ooo
 roved_For,Release 20f/'G C       82.00457R0p7100010009-7
 petent water conservancy work has gone a long way
 in securing the present cotton harvest.
 Then, too, the People's Government set up more
 special experimental farms and nurseries for culti-
 vating selected cottdn seeds; it provided farmers
 with insecticides, sprayers and fertilisers, imported
 good quality seeds and distributed them to all cotton
 areas.  The equivalent in value of 30,000 tons of
 grain was invested'ih such undertakings.
 (4)  Lastly, the cadres and Party members as.
 signed to work in cotton areas worked at their jobs
 tirelessly.  In key areas they organised teams of
 experts to direct, the farmers in cotton growing,
 they utilised' newspapers and pamphlets to praise
 model cotton-growers and publicise various planting
 experiences,  They patiently convinced the peasants
 of the need and advantages of growing cotton.
 The results have indeed been striking.  The
 broad cotton belts in the vast basins of the Yellow
 and Yangtse Rivers, on the great plains of the
 Northwest, and in Northeast China, are a delight
 to the eyes of a -cotton farmer.  The average yield
 per hectare is expected to come close to the best pre-
 war level of 194 kilograms of raw cotton per hectare.
 Some 16.4 per cent of the total area under cot-
 ton has been planted with the' long' staple variety,
 which previously was always imported from abroad.
 This has now been introduced into every cotton-
 growing area in China.
 Though achievements on the cotton front have
 been great, there is still a big task ahead before
 supply can wholly, satisfy demand.  For the demand
 for cotton is rising steadily as the living conditions
 of the people improve.  The increased demand for
 cotton is shown on -the example of the Northeast
 where 800,000 bolts of cloth were used in 1947,
 1,200,000 in 1948, and 3,200,000 in 1949.  In 1950,
 it has been estimated that the people of the North-
 east will want over 9,000,000 bolts of cloth.
 To produce one bolt of cloth, 5.25 kilos of raw
 cotton are needed.  The population of the Northeast
 is about one-twelfth of the total population.  Thus,
 if the people's demands in the Northeast are taken
 as a standard, at least 600,000 tons of ginned cotton
 will be needed to supply the textile industry alone.
 If other uses for cotton, such as medical and
 chemical uses, padded clothes ' and quilts, and so on,
 are taken into consideration., at least 900,000 tons of
 ginned cotton will be needed to meet these needs.
 As it is, the present 760,000 tons of ginned
 cotton will, generally speaking, be adequate to keep
 the country's textile industry running for a whole
 year.  Btit naturally more than just this is needed.
 And this goal,{ too, is within reach.  A Three-Year
 Plan has already been worked out laying special
 emphasis on the selection of seeds and on increasing
 the yield in every unit area. By 1953, cotton experts
 expect that China will not only be in a position to
 fully meet her own needs, but will have a surplus
 for export to meet the needs of others.

 Our Writers at the Peace Congress
 In the field  of literature a
 poet, essayist, novelist, playwright,
 critic and translator of the first
 order; in the field of science - a
 highly  regarded  historian and
 archaeologist; a daring revolution-
 ary, a skilled organiser, an eloquent
 orator noted for the beauty of his
 language and his diction -such is
 Kuo Mo-jo, a man of parts, the
 leader of China's delegation to both
 the First and Second World Peace
 Congresses.
 A non-party member of the Peo-
 ple's Political  Consultative  Con-
 ference that founded the People's
 Republic,  Kuo  Mo-jo  was im-
 mediately appointed to the post of
 Vice-Premier of the Central Peo-
 ple's Government.  It was` an ap-
 pointment  that,       among      other
 things, reaffirmed the age-old re-
 gard that China has for literature.
 Kuo Mo-jo was born in Szechuan
 in 1892, and received a strictly
 classical early education, but as
 soon as he had the choice, he de-
 cided to take up the study of
 medical science. He went to Japan,
 and it was while he was studying
 anatomy there that he began to
 read Heine, Turgeniev, Spinoza and
 Goethe and started to write and
 translate.  He never followed his
 profession, though he graduated as
 a doctor, but threw himself into
 literary work and the lively art
 controversies of the day.
 Art for the People
 The literary Creation'Society he
 founded was dedicated at first to
 "art for art's sake."  But he soon
 saw through this self-deception and
 became one of the staunchest pro-
 tagonists of "art for the people."
 The Creation Society thereafter
 exerted a considerable  influence
 over the .youth of. the- day. s At this
 time, he_p'ublished The Goc(dess,.his
 first colkection of poems ,(1921) ,
 and many prose writings and tran-
 slations including Faust (1920).
 In 1923, the Great Revolution
 swept him up in its tide.  He took
 part in the Northern Expedition as
 a director of revolutionary pro-
 paganda.  Then the Chiang Kai-
 shek counter-revolution and terror
 forced him to escape abroad, and
 for the next ten years he lived in
 Japan.  Under the watchful eyes
 of the Japanese police, he turned
 his political activities into a new
 sphere. j He  translated  Marx's
 Critique of Political Economy and
 German Ideology.   These studies
 gave him a deeper understanding
 of the materialist conception of his-
 tory and aided him in his work
 Researches into Ancient Society.
 Seeking further source material, he
 probed into the hieroglyphs on an-
 cient oracle bones and bronzes, del-'
 ving deeper than any of his con-
 temporaries into the structure and
 character   of   ancient   Chinese
 society.
 Then came the Japanese invasion
 of China in 1937.    Kuo Mo-jo im-
 mediately returned home to take
 his place in the leadership of the
 People's United Front against the
 aggressor.  As Director of the Cul-
 tural Bureau of the Political-Minis-
 try, he saved many treasures of
 China's cultural heritage and en-
 couraged and organised the patrio-
 tic efforts of writers and artists.
 It was at the time when defeat-
 ism and reaction finally complete-
 ly dominated the KMT and split
 the United Front that he produced
 his series -of six. historical plays,
 including Chu Yuan, that infused a
 ,new  quality  into  contemporary
 theatrical art and heartened all
 progressives in the KMT-control-
 led areas.  In 1943, he published
 two new profound books:      The
 'Bronze Age and the Ten Critiques
 of the philosophers of the Chow
 and Ching times, Confucius, Men-
 cius,    Mo-tse, ' Chuang-tsu                                                            and
 others.
 Returning in 1945 from a visit to
 the Soviet Union, he arrived in
 Chungking in time to takk part in
 the peace negotiations between the
 KMT and the Chinese Communist
 Party. He also participated in the
 January 1946 All-Party Political
 Consultative Conference that met
 to formulate the terms of peace.
 Fight for Peace
 Leading the great mass rally in
 Chungking  that  celebrated the
 holding of this  conference and
 its work for peace, Kuo Mo-jo,
 together with other democrats, was
 attacked by KMT thugs. When the
 KMT launched the civil war, he
 again  succeeded in  escaping to
 Hongkong, from whence he reach-
 ed the Liberation Areas.                                                                                             Follow-
 ing the formation of the People's
 Government, he was concurrently
 appointed Chairman of the Cultural
 and Educational Committee of the
 Government,  President  of  the
 Academia Sinica, and was elected
 Chairman of the All-China Associa-
 tion of Writers and Artists.
 He has taken part in many inter-
 national  conferences,                                                                                                 served  his
 people on many special commis-
 sions.  He recently led the people's
 mission to fighting Korea.  And he
 still finds time to inspire and per-
 sonally  encourage  many of the
 young writers and artists of New
 China.
 On this latest mission of peace
 to the Second World Peace Con-
 gress, he his been accompanied by
 the novelist Pa Chin, noted for his
 short  stories  and for his  long
 trilogy on the break-up of the big
 family  system,  the  search   of
 ardent young intellectuals grown
 out'of such a family for the truth,
 and their merging with the revolu-
 tionary workingclass. Three.poets_
 also comprise part of the delega=tion: Emi Sjao, who is internation-
 ally known as a partisan of peace;
 Feng Nai-chao; and Yuan Shui-poi,
 who is also a song and ballad
 writer of great popularity.

 Transformation of a Mill
 Over  the gate  the  signboard
 says, "China Textile Corporation,
 Tientsin No. 2 Factory."  From
 the road you can hear the hum of
 machinery, the rattle of looms and
 whir of spindles. Looking through
 the gate, you catch an occasional
 glimpse of a woman worker-for
 most of the..s'tate-owned plant's
 5,000 workers are women - scurry-
 ing across the courtyard in her
 white apron.  But what attracts
 your attention most is a huge
 board,  placed   just   inside  the
 gate,  and painted  on  it    lines
 that curve upward, lines that mean
 more cotton from each of the 98,040
 spindles, more cloth from each of
 the looms, ? and beside it the notice
 board on the wall, crammed with
 cartoons,' challenges and competi-
 tion results-.  "No. 2 Team beats
 No. 7 by 50.17 yards to 49.10" and
 "Honour Model Worker Liu."
 You go up to the board.  Those
 figures  up there.   You , would
 scarcely believe it possible if you'd
 stood on the same spot less than
 two years  ago,  when Tientsin's
 liberation was already certain and
 the workers were organising to pre-
 vent KMT looting and damage. And
 if you'd been there thirty years be-
 fore, in 1919, when the factory,
 founded by the Northern Warlords,
 was first opened, you'd have said
 those curving lines and the state-
 ments they make were preposter-
 ous, a nonsensical  dream.   Yet
 those figures-that rise of cloth
 from 40 yards to 46.96 yards on
 the same' loom in the. same time -
 . were made by some of the very
 same men and women who endured
 thirty years of near-slavery, who
 loitered. and slacked and sabotaged
 in reprisal against harsh, oppres-
 sive conditions.
 It was in 1936, that the factory
 was,sold, :to :the Japanese.  Condi-
 tions under the, Northern Warlords,
 rulers of the Hopei plains, had
 been bad.   Under the Japanese
 they were worse.. The new super-
 visors were more skilled in indus-
 Chow Hsueh-sheng
 trial technique and industrial ex-
 ploitation.  They could, detect de-
 fective work at a glance.  They
 didn't hesitate to pay the workers
 wages which would only keep them
 for ten days out of the month, and
 drive theft  to  cover the other
 twenty days' expenses.  Nor did
 they hesitate, when the workers
 turned to theft as the only way
 out, to have their guards search
 them as they went off work and
 to torture anyone found stealing,
 even to the extent of having trained
 dogs tear their underwear down
 and standing them, men' and women,
 naked at the factory gate.
 Nine years later, in 1945, the
 factory fell into the hands of the
 Kuhmintang.   There  were three
 months of idleness before produc-
 tion started again, months during
 which the workers had to fend for
 themselves, Then production began
 again, yet with an accompanying
 oppression worse than any they had
 experienced under the Japanese.
 For now they were under bureau-
 crats who knew nothing of indus-
 try, whose only concern was for
 profits, and whose only method to
 get production out of mill workers
 was to set them under secret ser-
 vice agents, petty racketeers and
 gang bosses - all hired not for any
 technical knowledge they had, but
 for their experience in "controlling"
 workers and extracting more yard
 and cloth, more work, from them
 by threats and terrorism.   The
 company trade union was only an-
 other extension of this, another
 means to control the workers in the
 interests of a bureaucratic manage-
 ment devoted to quick profits and
 speculative markets.  ?
 The workers themselves counted
 for nothing.  In sickness they were
 neglected, in trouble they were" dis-_
 regarded.  Useful as creators of
 wealth, they were carefully pre-
 vented from sharing in their own
 creation.  And lest there should be
 any semblance of unity between
 19
 staff and workers to threaten the
 disunity  upon  which corruption
 thrived, the divisions between staff
 - whose rolls were padded with the
 management's    friends, relatives
 and  . political   off-siders - and
 woker?s were encouraged and nur-
 tiired.  The one group rode to and-
 from work in a specially-provided
 bus. The other walked.  The one
 could enter and leave the plant
 freely. The other, going and com-
 ing, must stop and be subjected to
 an ignominious search.  The one
 looked down on the workers as dirty
 manual labourers.  The other con-
 temptuously named the staff the
 bosses' "dog legs."
 If management had any policy, it
 was :   "Divide  and, rule.   Give
 nothing.    Get  what  you    can."
 From this calculated chaos the fac-
 tory was liberated b  the PLA on
 January 15, 1949.
 Liberation Brings Stability
 To bring in order, however, was
 not. easy.  Fears and suspicions
 deliberately spread by KMT ele-
 ments in the months before libera-
 tion had to be allayed.  Some said,
 "New officials will be like  any
 former other officials. What dif-
 ference will you find between KMT
 and the Communist? What does
 either care for the worker?"
 On January 16, the day after the
 PLA entered the plant, meetings
 were held throughout the factory.
 Activists, PLA representatives and
 Communist Party members talked
 ,to groups of workers, explaining
 the all-important task of putting
 the factory to work again.  The
 co-operation  of many was won.

 Division Among Employees
 Another major obstacle which
 faced the committee was the divi-
 sion  between  the  technical  and
 clerical staff on the one hand and
 the workers on the other.  These
 two groups had to be brought
 together.   Technique could no
 more be divorced from labour than
 theory from practice.
 The  KMT's   counter-revolution-
 ary  propaganda                                                                                                 had  had more
 effect on the staff than on the
 workers. The staff felt more reas-
 sured after Liberation, but anta-
 gonisms between the two groups
 persisted, though the forms they
 took were different.  While in the
 old days the workers looked on
 these people as the bosses' "dog
 legs or "orderlies," the staff's con-
 tempt for the workers was now
 tempered a little by fear.  ""The
 workers may have become thelead-
 ing class, but what do they know
 about mathematics or any of the
 sciences ?" some thought to them-
 selves.  Others thought opportun-
 ism more profitable, flattering the
 workers, accepting all their sugges-
 tions, even the unwise ones.  Be-
 cause of this, the factory inspec-
 tion system grew very lax and
 production suffered.
 To overcome these divisions, staff
 members and workers were brought
 together in small groups to talk out
 their differences.  Activists, Party
 and  trade  union   representatives
 stressed that the technical staff was
 really part of the broad working
 class and would be accepted by that
 class once their attitudes changed.
 Joint  meetings  of   technicians,
 supervisors and workers considered
 production 'problems,. and mutual
 respect increased. Some of the staff
 were astonished at the valuable
 suggestions workerg made on the
 basis of their long practical ex-
 perience. - The workers, for their
 part, were grateful for suggestions
 from the staff which improved pro-
 duction methods, many of which led
 to better working conditions and
 higher incomes.

 "Mind you, it took me seine time

 things were.
 "We held a meeting. in our fac-

 a knitwear factory.  At
 18, he was conscripted into the
 Japanese puppet police force.  He
 ran away and finally became an
 apprentice fireman in our bailer
 room.  He once fell asleep through
 overwork  and  was    handcuffed,
 made to kneel on a piece of wood
 and hold another piece of wood
 above his head while a Japanese
 lashed his bare back with a, whip,
 threatening from time to time to
 shoot him.
 "Yang  said  quietly,  'I  would
 rather die myself now, so that my
 family can remain free, so that all
 our workers and our factory can
 be protected, so that all our people
 can be protected.  I think all work-
 ers, even those that have not volun.
 teered for individual considerations,
 have the same opinion.'
 "I tell you it shook me, I went
 Home and that night I could hardly
 sleep.. I kept thinking of the grand
 life that we were beginning to live
 and how it was all threatened by
 the American imperialist war.
 "In. the morning I read in the
 paper the statement of all the de-
 mocratic parties of the country.
 That settled it for me.  I told my
 wife I wanted to go to Korea.  To
 my joy, she said she understood.
 She even seemed proud of me. She
 said she. would find work in the
 textile. mill and keep the home
 going. I went straight to the -trade
 union centre and registered as a
 ,.,:volunteer,."
 Not everyone in this factory has
 volunteered to go to Korea. Some
 have over-riding family or other
 good reasons.  And not all that
 volunteered will be able 'to get
 awa'.   But  I  had  found   the
 answers to the question that was
 in my mind when I went down to
 this   important   cement  works
 - what   made.   up   the   fine
 spirit of this factory, with its
 unusual ? production  record, its
 model workers, its large number
 of volunteers.
 Slogans around the fac-
 tory that expressed this
 spirit caught my attention
 as I took  a final look
 round.  In the boiler room
 was the pledge:  "We will
 work in with the kilns
 to achieve our new targets.  We
 guarantee not a single drop of oil
 will be wasted.  No breakdowns,
 major or minor." In the courtyard
 was a sign: "The kilns are our can-
 nons, the' mills our machine guns.
 The faster they turn, the more the
 enemy trembles," and at the gate,
 the slogan that is now a common
 sight everywhere in China: "STOP
 THE    AMERICANS,    HELP    THE
 KOREANS   AND   SAFEGUARD    OUR

 Chinese  and Koreans Fought
 the Japanese Too
 Chang Chao
 This Js not the first time that
 Korean and Chinese patriots have
 battled together against invaders
 of their  countries.   Their joint
 guerrilla warfare was a thorn in
 the side of the Mikado's armies
 throughout the 1931-45 Japanese
 invasion of China.
 After Korea was annexed by the
 Japanese in  1905, thousands  of
 Korean patriots and revolutionaries
 found sanctuary in China.    And
 when the imperial armies pushed
 on into Mukden on Sept. 18, 1931,
 those in the N orthcast were among
 the first to take up arms in defence
 of their adopted country.  In those
 first few months they joined the
 revolt of the Chinese population of
 the Chientao district; they cutthe
 Tunghwa-Kirin Railway.     At tai-
 yuan, they destroyed the Japanese
 police headquarters.  But in those
 early days, the Northeast guerrillas
 were poorly  organised    and ` had
 little military knowledge. Betrayed
 by the KMT government, they suf-
 fered heavy defeats.                           Some detach-
 ments were wiped out to a man.
 Those that tsurvived were forced to
 separate into small groups based in
 remote  areas - the   Forest  and
 Mountain Detachments.
 It was out of these unco-ordinat-
 ed bands that the Chinese Com-
 munist Party forged the heroic
 Anti-Japanese United Democratic
 Armies (the AJUDA) and gradual-
 ly enrolled the masses of the people
 in a widespread rear organisation
 and reserve for mobile guerrilla
 warfare.  By the 'end of 1932, the
 movement had recovered from its
 early defeats.  It became a force
 that  pinned  down  large  enemy
 forces until the day of Japan's final
 defeat.   A year after its formal
 inauguration in 1936, the AJUDA
 had ? three  Route Armies 90,000
 strong,  in  which  the   Korean
 patriots 'played an  outstanding
 role.   Kim II-sung was once   a
 Divisional Commander.  Kim Tze
 was Political Com-
 missar of the Third
 Route Army. Many
 other  divisional
 commanders    and
 commissars   were
 also Koreans.
 The famous Rock
 Guerrilla Detach-
 ment,                                                                              predecessor
 of the First Route
 Army  based  in
 Liaoning Province,
 was  led by  Li
 Hung-kwang,     an    outstanding
 Korean Communist who later met
 his death in battle. As the First
 Route Army, with Li as its Chief-of-
 Staff, it inflicted heavy punishment-
 on the Japanese in the Po Li River
 area.   Its  fame- spread.   Many
 Northeast railway workers joined
 it and became noted experts at
 railway demolition work.  On more
 than one occasion it carried opera-
 tions  up to the very walls                                                                 of
 Mukden, the main Japanese-held
 city, and finally became so trouble-
 some to the invaders that the im-
 perial staff in the autumn of 1937
 decided to destroy it in a major
 campaign with over 7,000 crack
 troops.
 The First Route Army suffered
 heavily, but 400 survivors broke
 through the encirlement and re-
 treated to the banks of the Yalu
 River on Korea's border. From this
 new base, aided by tough Chinese
 and  Korean  lumbermen  of. the
 Changpai forests, it interfered con-
 tinually  with ' Japanese,                                                                                                  timber
 shipments and  permanently  en-
 gaged a large Japanese punitive
 force.
 It was from among the men of
 this Army that General Kim Il-
 sung in 1936 led his Sixth Division
 to carry the struggle over  the
 border into North Korea.   When
 Yang Ching-yu, commandet of the
 First Army, was killed in action,
 the Army rallied around General
 Kim Il-sung.  The First Army was
 in being and harassing the Japan-
 ese to the end of the war.  Under
 General Kim's leadership, under-
 ground  revolutionary  work      was
 organised in the vital centres of
 Japanese rule in Korea so that
 when the Soviet Armies launched
 their liberation offensive, against
 the Japanese in Northeast China
 and Korea, the Korean people's
 movement was able, along with the
 Northeast volunteers, to give sub-
 stantial assistance to the Soviet
 forces and establish the people's
 rule in the liberated areas.
 In  Kirin's  eastern  mountains,
 Korean revolutionaries formed the
 basic core of the East Manchurian
 Guerrilla   Detachment.   Later,
 joined with the guerrilla detach-
 ments which had been forced to
 retreat from central area of North-
 east China, they formed the Second
 AJUDA Route Army, a force that
 became noted for its intrepid raids
 on Japanese communications.  It
 was the fear of this close and effec-
 tive co-operation between the two
 peoples that decided the Japanese
 command to wipe out the whole
 guerrilla area.  On the basis -of its
 notorious  "Three-All  Policy"  of
 "Kill All, Burn All, Loot A111"
 villages suspected of hiding guer-
 rillas were razed to the ground.
 The men folk were killed or driven
 off to slave labour on the northern

 fortifications. Women and children
 were herded into stockaded con-
 centration camps? or sold as slaves
 to factories or houses of prostitu-
 tion.  On the approach of Japanese
 troops, whole villages fled from
 their homes.to the hills and forests.
 The guerrillas,  however,   were
 ineradicable, for they were the im-
 mortal people.  They turned re-
 treats into advances. _ Hard pressed
 in China, in 1.943, with their gallant
 commander And political commissar
 killed, the ' 2nd Army despatched
 the Korean comrades under their
 commander Ching Tse-tseng into
 Korea, where they engaged the
 Japanese garrisons until the end
 of the war.
 Thousand:   of  Koreans   were
 among  the  more  than 160,000
 fighters of the AJUD~A units and
 militiamen who, after 14 years of
 constant battle, co-operated in the
 advance, of the Soviet  Armies
 against the Japanese and celebrated
 V-J Day under victorious arms.
 When the war ended, many of
 those Korean com~ades ieturned to
 their  own  liberated land while
 others planned to stay in the North-
 east.                Under the People's Govern-
 ment, they received their share of
 land under the land reform and
 began their lives anew.  But still
 another trial awaited them.
 The United Democratic Armies
 of the Northeast and the People's
 Government were in effective con-
 trol  of the strategic Northeast.
 The Kuomintang, aided and insti-
 gated by the Americans, poured in
 tropps by ship and plane to wipe
 out the people's forces and restore
 the Chiang dictatorship.  The peo-
 ple's forces fought back.                      Chinese
 and Korean guerrillas put on their
 uniforms again.  In the ensuing
 War of Liberation, 'Koreans and
 Chinese fought side by side on
 every  major 1  battlefield of  the.
 Northeast and many Korean demo-
 crats later 'aided the PLA on its
 victorious advance from North to
 South China.
 Throughout Korea and China and
 in Northeast China especially, this
 comradeship-in-arms  of - the two
 peoples has left an ineffaceable
 tradition.  "We two peoples are as
 close as lips and teeth," say the
 peasants of the Yalu valleys. The
 legendary tales of the campaigns
 are common to* both sides of the
 border.  The people of the North-
 east are as proud of their. Korean
 heroes as of their own.
 If  the  American  invaders  in
 Korea still want to know what kind
 of people they are trying to sup-
 press, they would do well to read
 the history of the campaign of the
 AJUDA.   Its fighters, men and
 women, gave countless examples of
 heroism. Many of the girl fighters
 whose tragic story is told in the
 film "Daughters of China" were
 Koreans. The  Korean     heroine
 Kim Tong-san could lay mines as
 well as she could sew. She derailed
 many enemy trains. Now shg is a
 labour heroine in production. Out-
 numbered ten to one, the Korean
 commander Li Kwang-lin and his
 men fought to their last bullet and
 then with their bare hands until
 not a man remained alive.  Name-
 less, because all her family had
 been wiped out by the Japanese, a
 Korean girl singer and, dancer of
 the Chientao region People's Enter-
 tainment . Troupe  fell  into                                                             the
 Japanese  hands. Even      under
 threat of death, this eight-year-old
 child refused to betray her friends
 and perished shouting the slogan
 "Down    with  the Japanese  im-
 perialists!"
 The battles against the Japanese
 invaders  and the U.S.-supported
 Chiang, Kai-shek clique were by no
 means the only time Korean and
 Chinese democrats fought side by
 side.  Korean revolutionaries, like
 the Korean people in general, have
 for centuries regarded China with
 a special feeling of kinship.  Since
 25
 the enslavement of their own coun-
 try by Japan, they have looked to
 China's liberation as the herald of
 their own.  Korean revolutionaries
 took part in the overthrow of the
 Manchu dynasty,, in the Northern
 Expedition of the Great Revolution
 in 1925-27 and in the struggles of
 the Agrarian Revolution.  But it
 was in the joint battles against the
 Japanese  and  Chiang-American
 forces that they built up those
 especially close relations of mutual
 regard 'that have become an exam-
 ple of revolutionary international-
 ism in the Asian peoples' struggle
 for freedom from a common im-
 perialist foe.
 These two peoples have learned
 well the lessons of those times.
 Fourteen years of struggle taught
 them the need and invincibility of
 unity.  Peasants of the Yalu River
 valleys say: "If the lips are gone,
 the teeth will suffer from the cold."
 So the people of the Northeast
 needed no urging when the new
 invasion of Korea threatened the
 freedom of their neighbours and
 their  own  hearths  and  homes.
 Followed by the rest of the Chinese
 people, they have volunteered in
 their tens of thousands for service
 with the Korean People's Army.
 Such are the present opponents
 of the  American  invaders  in
 Korea.      They will not be cowed by
 atrocities, such as the U.S. forces
 and their puppets are now. perpe-
 trating.                                                                                                     They have been steeled in
 battles with a foe just as atrocious.
 In addition, the guerrillas of yes-
 terday                                                                                                      are  now  armed  with
 weapons as good as those of their
 enemies.     But  neither technique
 nor terror will decide this war. The
 men behind the weapons will do
 that.  The joint struggles of the
 Korean and Chinese people in the
 past   show  the  quality  of  the,
 fighters who man the jets and
 rocket-guns that are decimating
 the latest invaders of Asia's main-
 land.

 A LETTER FROM A RETURNED STUDENT
 Dear Editor,
 This morning I volunteered to
 fight  against  the  American  in-
 vaders in Korea.                             Thousands have
 volunteered before me and still
 more will do so in the future.
 Many are already fighting on the
 battlefront.
 I am one of the many students
 who have recently returned from
 the United States. _ I always loved
 my country, but never have I loved
 it so much as I do now, after
 having seen the many wonderful
 changes which have taken place
 during my absence.
 The first people I met in New
 China were a group of sailors on
 the tugboat that took me from the
 freighter. to the wharf at Taku Bar.
 How  they  welcomed  me  back!
 They said to me, "We are con-
 structing a new country.  Here is
 your chance.  Make good use of
 what you   have  learned in the
 university."
 Then they went on to tell me
 about their. life after liberation.
 "Yes," remarked one sailor, "you
 will be surprised to find how many
 things have changed in so short a
 time."        '
 "I  have     an  extremely  large
 family to support," said another,
 "but now even our family can live
 happily. . . . You know," he co4i-
 tinued, "this month we decided to
 unload twice as much as before
 and we.are working doubly hard to
 overfulfil our target."
 One of the sailors handed me
 a book on the history of the Chinese
 revglution.  "This is our textbook.
 Besides the literacy classes, we read
 and discuss this book and have ses-
 sions of criticism and self-criticism
 to improve our political conscious-
 Hess."
 On the train from Taku Bar to
 Tientsin, I sat next to an old peas-
 ant and his grand-daughter.  All
 the way he kept commenting on the
 crops on both sides of the track.
 "See how well the kaoliang has
 grown.  A few more rainless days
 and this will surely be a bumper
 crop. The PLA have done it again,
 you know," he said to me.  "They
 cleared away the ruins of the Kl1tT
 fortresses, ploughed the field, dug
 an irrigation canal, and planted
 the seeds - all in three days.
 . . "
 Fearing that perhaps I wasn't
 interested, his grand-daughter ex-
 plained, "Grandpa used to curse
 the troops -the Japs, the Amer-
 icans, the KMT gangsters, and a
 lot of others whose names I don't
 remember.  But how he loves to
 talk about the PLA !"
 The old man smiled and went
 on:  "Why shouldn't I talk about
 the PLA?   Several years ago, I
 was one of the coolies drafted to
 work on this road. Now I ride on
 it -a thing I wouldn't even dare
 dream of before.  Last winter in
 the land reform my two sons each
 got five snow of land.  Now we are
 doing fine.  We can afford to go to
 Tientsin to see your Third Uncle -
 he's doing well as a factory hand
 in the No. 7 Mill of the China Tex-
 tile Corporation.  Eh, can I talk
 too much about our liberators?"
 Here in Peking the transforma-
 tion is remarkable.  I have a feel-
 ing that the whole city pulsates
 with new life. The cadres who
 work harder than everyone else live
 more simply than others.  Then
 there are the workers who work
 from morning till night in every
 part of the city clearing away the
 rubbish left through decades of
 neglect.  New streetcars . . . new
 roads     . new people. Above all,
 there was the mammoth October
 1st parade in which the whole city
 joined to celebrate the National
 Day.  Can there be any doubt that
 a new country has been born?
 As a newcomer to Peking, I con-
 stant ' ly feel the urge to ask my-
 self:                                                             Was it like this before?
 Have I ever seen a Chinese city
 without ;a single beggar as today in
 Peking?  Have I ever picked up
 a newspaper and read. articles by
 high ranking officials which go into
 serious ,and detailed self-criticism
 as in the People's Daily?  I could
 go on indefinitely asking myself
 such questions.  And the answer-
 always a simple NO.
 'A's for the "American way of
 life" I witnessed, my main impres-
 sions are of jobless young men sit-
 ting on park benches, weary-look-
 ing workers reading comic strips
 in subways, drunks inside a bar
 hovering around a television set
 watching some stupid or corrupt-
 ing program, and schoolboys gossip-
 ing to each other about Superman
 and western cowboys.
 Today no people are so hated by
 the Chinese as the American im-
 perialists.  Ask the man on the
 street what he thinks of the Ameri-
 can invaders and he will tell you in
 no uncertain terms. Often you will
 find he himself or his friends or
 relatives  have  suffered  through
 American business dealings, bombs'
 or troops.  But even more i~ his
 hatred directed against the Ameri-
 can imperialists for the fact that
 they will not let us alone to get on
 with our peaceful construction.
 Three months -of life in New
 China -have -given  me  a  new
 strength and new faith in my coun-
 try. Like all my countrymen, I feel
 now that this country is ours. No
 one is going to destroy it. We will
 fight for the beautiful future be-
 fore us.
 Dear Editor, I am leaving for
 the Korean front in a few days.
 There I may fight Will, Bob and
 other American boys whom I knew
 as friends in the States.  But do
 I hesitate?  No.  I'll fight them
 to  the  bitter   end,   so  long
 as they   serve  as  the tools of
 an imperialism
 Which threatens
 to plunder and
 enslave     our
 country.
 Sincerely ;yours,
 P. W. LIN

 Wu Hsiu-chuan, special de-
 legate of China to the U.N.
 meeting, arrived in New Yoi1'kk
 on Nov. 24, with his adviser
 Chiao Kuan-hua and seven
 members of the delegation.
 The Chinese delegate will be
 present to discuss his coun-
 try's  charge  of  American
 aggression in Taiwan and
 also the Soviet charge of U.S.
 aggression against China.
 On arrival Wu expressed
 the hope that China's charge
 "will receive just treatment
 in the Security Council.  If
 so, it will be helpful to peace
 and security in the Pacific
 and in Asia."
 French . Air Intrusions
 During the 61 days from Sept. 1
 to Oct. 31, a total of 120 French
 planes intruded into China's terri-
 torial air on 50 occasions in the
 region of the frontier areas of the
 three  provinces  of  Kwangtung,
 Kwangsi and Yunnan, bordering on
 Viet-Nam, says a statement by the
 .spokesman of the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs published on Nov. 23.
 French land forces made 13 incur-
 sions into Chinese territory during
 the same period.  According to in-
 .complete data, 33 Chinese citizens
 were killed and 20 severely injured
 by the raiding of French planes and
 attack of the French land forces.
 The statement also revealed that
 between Dec.-14, 1949, and Aug. 31,
 1950, French land forces crossed
 into Chinese territory on 25 occa-
 sions while the French air forces
 made 18 incursions.  There were
 37 casualties, over 14 of which
 were fatal.
 The spokesman stated that the
 French government must bear full
 responsibility  for  these  savage
 acts;  that the    Chinese people's
 defence forces have been ordered
 to deal heavy counter blows to the
 intruders and that the government
 has lodged a firm protest with the
 French government, reserving the
 right to demand compensation for
 the losses sustained and to make
 other relevant demands.

 Patriotic Emulation Drive
 A nation-wide patriotic emula-
 tion drive is surgfng through the
 factories of China. The campaign,
 initiated by model worker Chao
 Kuo-yu of the No. 3 Machine Tool
 factory, is the workers' answer: to
 American aggressions in Korea and
 the Northeast.
 In Northeast China, the 200,000
 railway  workers  have  pledged
 themselves to fulfil all transport
 assignment under  all conditions.
 Responding   to   the challenge,
 workers of the Mukden Tele-cam-
 munications                                 Administration have
 guaranteed speedier and more ac-
 curate service under all conditions.
 Workers in a Tientsin electric
 furnace  shop  have  overfulfilled
 their production plan for the year
 by 7 per cent two months ahead
 of schedule.  Together with other
 Tientsin workers, they have written
 to Chairman Mao expressing their
 deep anger at America's aggres-
 sions and their determination, to
 do their part to defeat the enemy.
 The coke furnace workers of
 Taiyuan have created a new record
 by completing 180 per cent of their
 production schedule for October.
 They have challenged other fac-
 tories in Taivuan to-a friendly corn-
 petition.  The Shanghai Electrical
 Appliances  Plant  fulfilled  this
 year's production plan for trans-
 formers by the end of October.
 It has now already overfulfilled the
 plan by 11 per cent.

 #Land Reform Under Way
 During the slack farming season in the nextfew months, land
 reform --including the taking over of land from the landlord and
 distributing it among the peasantry-will take place over 'a big
 part of China, including a total rural population of over 100 million
 people. Preparations are well under way, as shown in the reports
 from two major areas.
 East China
 In the four and a half months
 since-the-new Land Reform Law,
 cadres both in the countryside
 and towns have worked hard to
 master its principles and pre-
 pare to apply it.  It has been
 received with the deepest ap-
 proval and. enthusiasm.
 Experiments  in 370  hsiang
 (each comprises several villages)
 have provided valuable experi-
 ence of the problems likely to
 arise.
 Peasant   associations,   the
 executive organs for the carry-
 ing through  of land reform,
 have been playing a leading part
 in building up a broad anti-
 feudal united front.  Not only
 farm labourers and poor peas-
 ants, but middle peasants, poor
 intellectuals and all other demo-
 cratic elements are drawn-in.
 Land reform committees to
 guide the work have been set
 up in each administrative unit,
 from the county upwards, with
 representatives of all democra-
 tic classes and parties. People's
 tribunals are established to ad-
 minister justice, should any die-
 hard landlord attempt to sabo-
 tage. A telephone network links
 every county with the higher
 administrative organs.
 Over 100,000. cadres are ready
 to  weigh  in, .: after  intensive
 .training in policy and practice,
 including  both  local     cadres,
 familiar   with  their localities,
 and experts in the details of
 policy and the law.
 University and middle school
 students of Shanghai, Nanking,
 Hangchow and other cities have
 enlisted by the thousand to join
 in the work during their winter
 vacation.  Actors, drama .teams,
 writers, cartoonists and  trou-
 badours from all centres in the
 area are preparing to join the
 villagers and play their part in
 helping the peasantry to ward
 off the 3,000 years of landlord
 oppression.
 By  March,  1951,  some  50
 million rural folk will have the
 first experience of the great
 benefits  of  this movement.
 Added to the parts of East
 China where land reform has al-
 ready been completed, this will
 mean that between 80 to 86 per
 cent of the rural population in
 East China will be free of the
 restrictive feudal landownership
 system.
 Northwest China
 In the newly liberated North-
 west, land distribution will take
 place in an area with 7,600,000
 people, mainly in the fertile
 Central Shensi plain and part
 of . Kansu and Ningsia.
 Peasant associations in the
 area have grown to it  total
 membership of 800,000. They
 have  gained  strength  in the
 course of  establishing social
 order and applying social re-
 forms during the past months,
 including wiping out the KMT
 remnants, exposing local despots
 and reducing rents.
 Some 15,000 cadres-young
 intellectuals as well as peasant
 leaders -have completed one to
 three months' training, studying
 the relevant laws and policy, in-
 cluding the Decisions Concern-
 ing the Differentiation of Class
 Status in the Countryside. .

 INTO THE BOOTS OF JAPANESE
 IMPERIALISM
 (Contsnuea from t'aye 11)
 the mainland from 1945 to 1949, the American im-
 perialists lavished over US$6,000,000,000 on the
 Chiang regime.  It was'the Pentagon's plan to equip
 75 divisions of Chiang Kai-shek's forces by 1950.
 ,The United States had fully armed 64 divisions,. 18
 special road police columns, 20 security police regi-
 ments, and one paratroop corps before the end of
 January, 1947.  Under a single agreement of June
 28, 1946, the U.S. undertook to furnish Chiang with
 over a thousand planes, 7,000 field guns and other
 military equipment. And as late as November, 1949,
 under a secret agreement with the Chiang remnants
 on Taiwan, the U.S. was still undertaking to furnish
 equipment for  five divisions  of  puppet  troops,
 together with 16. war vessels, radar equipment and
 additional planes while another US$150,000,000 of
 "economic aid" was granted.
 More Kicks Than Halfpence --Acheson
 Such "assistance," however, had to be paid for.
 And Chiang, in his turn, was lavish with property
 and rights of. the Chinese people.  Under the Sino-
 American, Treaty  of Friendship,                             Commerce  and
 Navigation of November 4, 1946, the Americans were
 given a stranglehold on China's economy, through
 their control of customs' legislation, rights of inland
 navigation, and of investment.  U.S. control was
 further extended to China's air through arrange-
 ments for the extension of U.S. air lines under the
 Sino-American Air Transport Agreement.  Military
 bases dominating China and threatening the USSR
 were also pledged to, the. U.S.   So far as he was
 able, Chiang Kai-shek obediently turned China into
 a colony of the USA, putting its vast resources of
 manpower, and natural wealth at their disposal to
 further? their aggressive expansionist schemes of
 .world domination in Asia.
 These vast imperialist schemes, however, were
 overturned by the democratic Chinese people. Despite
 the aid of their U.S. advisers, the 8,000,000 American
 equipped troops -of Chiang Kai-shek were routed by
 the People's Liberation Army in 'a series of brilliant
 campaigns.  Huge quantities of U.S. arms were cap-
 tured to equip the people's forces.
 The American imperialists no longer bother to
 maintain the fiction of their non-intervention in the
 civil war in China.  Acheson in his notorious White
 Paper excuses his own failure by opining that "the
 failure of the Chinese Nationalist Government . . .
 does not stem from inadequacy of American aid."
 He admits that the Chiang regime was too rotten
 to save.  It "had lost the popular support," Acheson
 sags euphemistically.  He might have added that
 the Chinese people repudiated the Chiang regime as
 it was a corrupt tool of American imperialism.
 As Acheson wrote to Truman on July 30, 1949,
 29
 was beyond the control of the Government of the
 United States."  If the American imperialists had
 drawn the logical conclusion from the catastrophe
 in China, they would indeed have "pulled out lock,
 stock and barrel."  But the logic of the imperialists
 is not the logic of the people.
 Their defeat has set them seeking new, and even
 more adventurous means of regaining their lost posi-
 tions in Asia.
 Realising that the Central People's Government
 enjoys the fullest confidence and support of the
 people and has established a strong, efficient and
 stable regime that prevents the success of any plots
 initiated inside continental China, the U.S. 'expan
 sionists have reverted to the old imperialist policy
 of encirclement.  This was tried, and failed, against
 the young USSR, but, given a new name today -
 "containment" - it is now being tried again, this
 time against a vast area that. includes no less than
 half the world's population.
 With this aim in view, the American imperialists
 have helped to establish a string of puppet regimes
 around China's borders - the Syngman Rhee clique
 in Korea, the Yoshida Government in Japan, Chiang
 Kai-shek in Taiwan, the "phantom Emperor" Bao
 Dai in Indo-China, Phibul Songramm in Siam and
 Quirino in the Philippines.
 The Place to Begin is Korea - Acheson
 Developing this strategy and in an attempt to
 strengthen and even advance these exterior lines,
 the U.S, launched the attack on the Korean people
 on June 25, through the hands of its puppet Syng-
 man Rhee:  Two days later, it announced that its
 Seventh Fleet had been despatched to prevent the
 liberation of Taiwan by the Chinese People's Army.
 Their defeats in Korea increased the desperation of
 the Wall Street imperialists.  They became even
 more open and reckless in adventures which previous-
 ly they had tried to camouflage.
 They did not even trouble to get a U.N. "resolu-
 tion" to cover their intervention in Taiwan, and
 their aggression becomes daily more open.  Ameri-
 can news agencies report that in addition to the
 250 U.S. tanks sent to Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan
 (reported on Jan. 3, 1950), further supplies includ-
 ing air force units have been sent and large numbers
 of "retired" American, officers are arriving together
 with some 4,000 Japanese experts under the com-
 mand of the war criminal Hiroshi 'Nemoto, recently
 released :by MacArthur.. MacArthur, who appears to
 consider  himself  imperialist  America's  Man  of
 Destiny in Asia, already speaks of Taiwan as "an
 integral part of. American defence in the Pacific."
 But in addition to these provocative acts of
 occupying an island province that is by history and
 solemn international, agreements indisputably re-
 garded as Chinese, the Truman Administration has
 now carried its aggression in Korea up to the very
 borders of China and beyond.  A spokesman of the
 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese People's
 Government has listed no less than 88 plus 28 viola-

 tions of the air frontiers of the People's Republic
 of China between November 10 and 14.  In these
 raids, bombs and' machine-gunning have killed and
 wounded scores of Chinese citizens and destroyed
 considerable property.  Thee statements of American
 commanders and official spokesmen have become
 more and more provocative and aggressive.  A
 spokesman of MacArthur expresses doubts whether
 the Yalu is really the natural boundary between
 Korea and China; MacArthur himself talks darkly
 about the volunteers from China having a "bomb-
 free base.'
 a We have seen that Marshall, once again recalled
 to active planning in the U.S. headquarters, and
 other U.S. warmongers know well the importance of
 the northeastern provinces- to China's economy and
 security. General Wedemeyer, after Marshall's. de-
 parture from China, stressed this again when in his
 report to Truman of September, 1947, he proposed
 that these Chinese provinces be detached and placed
 under the trusteeship of the U.S.-doininated United
 Nations.  This report was suppressed at the time
 for fear of the unfavourable reactions of world
 opinion,  but  the  American  ambitions  it  too
 brazenly expressed have, far from being suppressed,
 been encouraged in the highest circles among Wall
 Street's agents in Washington.
 The Progress of Imperialism - Acheson
 Today the movements of American expansion in
 Asia are making the Chinese people and political
 commentators throughout the world recall to mind
 the dictums first expressed in the notorious Tanaka
 Memorial to the Japanese Emperor that was dis-
 closed in 1927: "to conquer the world, Japan must
 first -conquer Asia; and to conquer Asia, Japan must
 first conquer China; to conquer China, Japan must
 first conquer Manchuria; to conquer Manchuria,
 Japan must first conquer Korea.   . ."  It requires
 no great effort of imagination to read America for
 Japan and see how the cap fits.
 ,: The U.S. imperialists in the post-war world have
 shown themselves to be the arch enemy of the Chin-
 ese people.  They have not scrupled to: use the most
 reactionary, corrupt and bloody instruments in their
 attempts to dominate China. In their new attempt to
 interfere and retard China's peaceful construction by
 direct aggression against Taiwan and the Northeast,
 they-have once again called to aid the putrid rem-
 nants of the Chiang regime and the foulest reaction-
 aries in Asia and -among the Japanese fascists.
 E The fact that imperialist America still attempts
 to disguise her aggressions . against Taiwan, Korea
 and China's Northeast with the cloak of illegal U.N.
 decisions cannot deceive the Chinese people who are
 grown wise to such' deceptions.  They have already
 solemnly warned these aged Caesars seeking Asian
 empires.  Warnings, however, have failed to make
 the aggressor pause.  Chinese volunteers fighting in
 the ranks of the KPA have already dealt heavy
 blows to the aggressor.  This has had a somewhat
 sobering effect on the warmongers.  IM U more
 such lessons are needed, there is no doubt that the
 Korean and Chinese people, supported by the mighty
 democratic peace camp, headed by the Soviet Union,
 will know what to do.
 CHINA'S VOICE AT WORLD PEACE
 CONGRESS

 people. But they are oppressed and threatened by
 the American imperialists.
 Enough of this-we will say no more about
 these "great favours," for they are countless and
 we could not record them all.
 But, for the sake of comparison, let me also men-
 tion something of our impressions of the Soviet Union.
 Immediately after the victory of the Great
 October Revolution, the Soviet Union voluntarily
 proclaimed null and void all unequal treaties con-
 cluded with China by the tsarist government and
 showed constant sympathy for our people's libera-
 tion struggle.  On the very day following the found-
 ing of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the
 Soviet Union established friendly relations with her.
 Subsequently, a Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship,
 Alliance and Mutual Assistance was concluded for
 the purpose of jointly preventing imperialist aggres-
 sion in. the East, for the joint defence of world peace
 and security and for unreserved mutual assistance
 in the economic and cultural fields on the basis of
 equality and reciprocity.
 Are these comparisons not clear enough?  The
 Soviet Union helps the Chinese people while the
 United States of America helps the butcher, Chiang
 Kai-shek.-  The Soviet Union united with China to
 prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism, while
 the United States goes all out to revive this im-
 perialism in order to attack us.  The Soviet Union
 helps us in our peaceful construction 'while the
 United States seizes our island of Taiwan, invades
 our neighbours, threatens our security and destroys
 peace in Asia to prevent our peaceful construction.
 The Soviet Union in every way supports the seating
 of our delegates to the United Nations.  The United
 States hampers it in every way.
 At the United Nations Generl Assembly, the
 Soviet Union submits peace proposals while the
 United States utilises the United Nations for effect-
 ing  aggression.   The  Soviet  Union  is  changing
 nature with the help of atomic energy, whereas the
 United States threatens the entire human race with
 the atom bomb.
 We Chinese people love peace. The fact that
 223,500,000 people in China have already signed the
 Stockholm Appeal testifies to this. But precisely be-
 cause we love peace, we resolutely oppose aggression.
 The American imperialists are rendering all-out
 assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. Although they have
 suffered defeat in- China, they do not want to turn
 this lesson to good account.  They continue as before
 to threaten peace in the East and West. We peoples
 of the East, defending the cause of peace, do not
 yield to the aggressors.  We cannot step aside and

 remain indifferent to the sufferings of the Korean
 people.  For the purpose of defending Asia and
 world peace, we must carry the struggle against
 American aggression to a successful conclusion.
 The Chinese people fully support the convoca-
 tion of the Second World Peace Congress.  The
 Chinese delegation fully agrees with the proposals
 contained in the report made by the president of the
 Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress,
 Joliot-Curie,  particularly  those  concerning the
 United Nations.
 This agency, set up after the Second World War
 for safeguarding peace and the security of nations,
 has now become a screen behind which aggressors
 violate peace. The United Nations Charter has come
 to mean just so much paper.  The principle of una-
 nimity in the Security Council is also undermined.
 This is precisely why the United Nations has lost
 its prestige.  We hope that the United Nations will
 be able to regain its prestige, to free itself from the
 domination of the American imperialists, and that
 it will work justly and conscientiously for the benefit
 and security of peace-loving peoples the world over
 instead of doing just the opposite.
 To achieve this, it is necessary to observe the
 United Nations Charter, the principle of the una-
 nimity of the five great Powers, and to repeal all
 unlawful decisions which violate the Charter and
 the unanimity principle.  Representatives of the five
 great Powers must include the legal representa-
 tive of the 475 million people of the Chinese People's
 Republic, not a pseudo-representative who is the
 representative of the Kuomintang gang and a mere
 handful of people.
 We hope that the United Nations will be able
 speedily to take the necessary steps to achieve this
 purpose.
 If eventually the United Nations is unable to
 justify these hopes, we shall not stand by with
 folded arms and watch peace throughout the world
 being threatened and violated.  We Chinese people
 want to take more effective measures to safeguard
 world peace and the security of nations together
 with the British, American, French, Italian, Soviet,
 Polish, Viet-Namese, Korean, Mongolian and all other
 peace-loving peoples of the world.
 The Chinese people have instructed our delega-
 tion to put forward five proposals at this Congress.
 These are:
 1.  To end the aggression of the United States
 and other countries in Korea; to demand the with-
 drawal of all the troops of foreign aggressors from
 Korea; to realise a peaceful settlement of the Korean
 question which is the central problem in the present
 struggle for world peace.
 2.  To demand an immediate end to all and
 every interference by the United States in the libera-
 tion of Taiwan Island by the Chinese people.
 3.  To demand that MacArthur be branded a
 war instigator.  He is the main organiser of aggres-
 sion in the Far East and the main instigator for
 converting the war in Korea into world war.
 :82-00457R007100010009-7      31
 4.  Resolutely to oppose the use of atomic
 weapons and other types of weapons of mass
 annihilation, and to demand that the government
 which is the first to use atomic weapons be regarded
 as a war criminal, and be punished.
 5.  To demand that all states simultaneously
 reduce armaments, to establish effective control of
 this program; and to suggest that the peoples of the
 various countries render mutual assistance in econo-
 mic and cultural construction under conditions of
 peaceful co-existence.
 The fate of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo is still
 fresh in our memory.  Although those who cultivate
 the fascist plague have a short memory, the peoples
 of the world have not forgotten.  Those who oppose
 the people are always punished by the people, and
 those whose crimes against the people are doubly
 grave will be doubly punished.    Those who, at one
 and the same time, want to pursue the criminal
 ambitions of both Nazi Germany and Mikado Japan
 will receive from the people a punishment as great
 as that meted out to Nazi Germany and Mikado
 Japan combined.
 For a lasting world peace !
 Down with the instigators of another war and
 imperialist aggressors!
 .   Long live the great unity of the peace-loving
 peoples of all countries !
 THE "SUN OF HAPPINESS" IS RISING
 - IN TIBET    (Continued from Page 9)
 on the local authorities in Tibet by Colonel Young-
 husband's bayonets and to begin negotiations with
 the central government in China.  By the Anglo-
 Russian agreement of 1907, Britain undertook not to
 interfere in Tibet's internal affairs or to try to secure
 concessions or privileges there and to conduct her
 relations with Tibet in future only through China.
 Of course, this did not stop Britain from con-
 tinuing her intrigue.  She took advantage of the
 infant Chinese Republic after the 1911 Revolution
 and later of the corrupt Kuomintang regime to
 extend her position in Tibet.  She erected telegraph
 lines, took control over the postal service, kept gar-
 rison troops at Gyangtze and Yatung and from
 1936 onwards stationed a political mission perman-
 ently in Lhasa.  For the people, the result was
 heavier taxes, higher prices and the maintenance in.
 position of the most reactionary rulers.
 In 1947, Britain formally transferred to India
 her so-called "rights and obligations" with respect
 to Tibet. But an Englishman still heads the political
 mission in Lhasa which is now described as an
 Indian mission.
 America Takes a Hand
 In Asia, as in Europe, the American and British
 imperialists manoeuvred for post-war pickings - even
 while the Soviet Union was pouring out its life and
 blood to defeat the fascists.  In Tibet, while Amer-
 ican imperialism left most of the dirty work to
 their British satellites, it also began to take a
 direct hand.

 Agents of the Office of Strategic Services were
 sent into Tibet during the war to study and make
 aerial surveys of the territory.  In 1943, the Tibetan
 authorities, at the instigation of the British and
 Americans, suddenly inaugurated  a "Bureau of
 Foreign Affairs," making it the sole channel of con-
 tact for all diplomatic bodies in Lhasa.  Both the
 British mission and the American military mission
 in Lhasa immediately moved in on this "Bureau."
 ,The Chinese officials who were now expected to work
 through the new channel found themselves in a
 difficult situation.
 As the Chinese People's Liberation Army began
 to gain victories, the imperialists increased their
 efforts to cut Tibet off from China.  In November.
 1947, the imperialists instigated the Tibetans to send
 out a mission from Lhasa ostensibly to develop trade
 with the U.S.A. and Great Britain.
 Though the great powers had confirmed at the
 end of the war that Tibet was part of China, this
 "trade mission" on its arrival in India was accorded
 the reception usually reserved for diplomatic per-
 sonnel.  It made contacts with American and British
 officials and made its way to Hongkong.  There the
 American consulate took the unprecedented step of
 issuing them with visas on the basis of their own,
 and not Chinese, passports.
 The "mission" was received royally in the United
 States and stayed for over a year there and in.
 Great Britain.  The Kuomintang's weak protest at
 this gross infringement of Chinese sovereignty was
 brusquely brushed aside and the puppet "mission"
 returned to Tibet with an aura of independent status.
 It is perhaps worth noting, as a passing reflection
 on the importance of its trading activities, that
 Tibet's total annual foreign trade amounts to no
 more than two million U.S. dollars.
 On July 8, 1949, the Chinese officials were ex-
 pelled from Tibet.  The Chinese government wire-
 less station in Lhasaand Chinese schools were closed
 down. All Chinese officials and residents were order-
 ed to leave Tibet forthwith.  When the news was
 allowed to come out on July 22, it was accompanied
 by lurid and contradictory stories of "a Communist
 revolt."
 However, as early as February, information had
 already leaked out in the British press that a plan
 to "save Tibet from Communism" was being worked
 out in Tibetan monasteries; and some time after
 the event, the London Times frankly admitted the
 truth that allegations of a Communist plot were
 made to cover up the new moves "to shake off Chin-
 ese control."
 New British and American agents began to
 make their appearance in Tibet.  Towards the end
 of the year came the much publicised mission of a
 certain Lowell Thomas, an American "radio com-
 U0457R007100010009-7
 mentator," bringing with him valuable gifts for
 Tibetan officials.
 The value of Thomas' protestations that his was
 purely the adventurous expedition of a keen explorer
 may be assessed from several interesting facts.  On
 his way out, he had a talk about his mission with
 General MacArthur in Tokyo.  On its way back
 from Lhasa, the Thomas party was met in Silguri,
 on the Indian-Chinese border, by a military plane
 despatched by the American Embassy in Delhi, and
 the American Vice Consul Bisbee went to accompany
 them.
 Back in New York, Thomas delivered himself
 of some rather curious remarks for a non-political
 explorer.  "What the rulers of Tibet want to know,"
 he said on October 17, 1949, "is whether they can
 get help from the United States now, or in the event
 of a Communist invasion. If they can get help, they
 want two things - advisers on guerrilla warfare
 and more modern weapons."
 Reports began to appear in the American press
 about preparations in the U.S.A. to recognise Tibet
 as a sovereign and independent state and support
 its application for membership of the U.N.
 In February, a Tibetan delegation set out for
 Peking to negotiate the peaceful liberation of Tibet,
 but "According to all sources of information," writes
 the Peking People's Daily, "while the Lhasa delegates
 were in India, the British High. Commissioner in
 New Delhi, Sir Archibald Nye, and other imperialist
 elements did their best to persuade the delegation
 against reaching agreement with the Central Peo-
 ple's Government." It was, therefore, not surprising
 that the Tibetan delegation was unable to secure
 visas to pass through Hongkong.  Nor is it strange,
 though somewhat ludicrous, that at the U.N. tiny
 El Salvador, a client state of the U.S.A., should
 suddenly embrace the cause of the distant giant
 Tibet.  Thus up to the last moment the imperialists
 and their satellites have continued their intrigues
 against Tibetan liberation.
 In this context, the Central People's Government
 has expressed China's surprise and regret that the
 Indian Government should reproach it for taking
 action that will finally liberate the whole of its main-
 land territory and free Tibet from foreign imperial-
 ist interference and oppression.
 In October, in accordance with the principles of
 the Common Programme of the PPCC, the People's
 Liberation Army began its advance into Tibet.  As
 in other areas inhabited by national minorities, the
 strictest respect for local customs is being observed.
 Regional autonomy, equality for all nationalities and
 religious freedom is assured to the people.    For
 Tibet the long night is ending.  The sun of happi-
 ness will shine forth over the land!
