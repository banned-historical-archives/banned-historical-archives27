 early this year have prompted Peking to reaffirm publicly
 -- Japan, for its part, has moved gradually in the past few
 years to strengthen its ties with South Korea.     Prime Minister
 Fukuda has indicated his desire for a summit with President
 Pak late this year.  There is mounting recognition in Tokyo
 that Japan has a diplomatic role to play in the search for
 a more stable political environment on the peninsula.
 -- As the principal element of change, the US plan to withdraw
 its ground forces from South Korea will be closely watched
 by all the major players on the scene.  Despite misgivings
 about the slow pace and partial scope of the US withdrawal,
 Kim IZ-song keenly wishes to see the US troops go.  He has
 thus avoided actions that might jeopardize the pullout.
 -- What worries Kim it-song is the possibility of the major
 powers that might impose a Korean settlement as is evident in
 Pyongyang's attacks on various proposals for "two Koreas"
 and for "cross recognition."  The recently concluded Sino-
 Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and the growing conver-
 gence of interests between China and the US--coming at a
 time when North Korea's dependence on Peking is increasing--
 are certain to intensify these fears.
 -- The rivalry between China and the USSR limits the extent
 to which either is prepared to restrain the North Korean
 leader.  Peking and Moscow have made clear that their participa-
 tion in multilateral talks on the future of the Korean
 peninsula will be subject to North Korea's acceptance.
 Reluctant Treaty Allies
 In recent years China and the USSR have demonstrated
 little enthusiasm for Kim Il-song's efforts to reunify
 the Korean peninsula on his own terms.   In an unusual

 convergence of interests, both the Chinese and Soviets
 have an important stake in maintaining the status quo in
 Korea.   A major conflict there would seriously complicate
 each country's bilateral relations with the US, stimulate
 possible major changes in Japanese security policy, and
 introduce new uncertainties into the overall power balance
 in East Asia.
 25X1
 China and the USSR are Pyongyang's treaty allies and
 traditional military suppliers.   Both publicly support
 North Korea's call for a withdrawal of US forces from South
 Korea.   When tension on the peninsula increases, however,
 they seek to dissociate themselves from Kim Il-song's more
 rash actions--as demonstrated in the wake of the North Korean
 slayings of American soldiers in Panmunjom in 1976.   They
 view the US security commitment to Seoul as a useful
 ingredient in the mix of factors that keep peace on the
 peninsula and restrain Japanese impulses toward rearmament.
 Kim is well aware that China and the USSR subordinate
 North Korean ambitions to their own broader strategic
 interests.   In seeking to strengthen and preserve North
 Korea's independence of action, he has tried to exploit
 the mutual antagonism between China and the USSR.   He has had
 little success.   Moscow has shown little inclination to
 compete with Peking for Kim's favor,  and China has had the
 inside track since the early 1970s.
 Kim's efforts to schedule a Moscow visit to balance
 his highly publicized trip to Peking in 1975 have been turned
 aside.   Informal contacts between the Soviet Union and South
 Korea have continued despite Pyongyang's protests.   Moscow
 has not volunteered to ease Pyongyang's financial plight
 by providing hard-currency aid.   Weary of North Korea's
 repeated failure to meet bilateral trade commitments,  the
 Soviets have retaliated by reducing their own exports.
 More important, North Korea apparently has been cut off
 for several years from advanced Soviet weapons of the type
 that Moscow has routinely provided to a number of other
 clients.

 Muted Rivalry Persists
 Late last year the Soviets evidently perceived some
 slackening in Sino-North Korean ties and decided that
 additional effort on their part w..s in order.   They pre-
 sumably were aware of the notable absence of high-level
 Chinese contacts with North Korea in the months following
 Mao's death in September 1976.
 forces from South Korea, he did not. stipulate any timetable.
 Hua also backed Pyongyang's demand for a withdrawal of US
 In January 1978 Soviet Politburo member Kunayev
 visited Pyongyang to award Kim Il-song the Order of Lenin.
 Although Kunayev admittedly is not a heavyweight on the
 Politburo, he is the first Soviet official of that rank to
 visit Pyongyang since 1971 when relations were distinctly
 warmer.   North Korea, with characteristic disdain,  discounted
 the significance of the event by noting that the medal had
 originally been awarded in 1972 on Kim's 60th birthday.
 The Soviet maneuvering did not go unnoticed in Peking.
 Moreover,  the Chinese leadership probably wishes to secure
 its eastern flank against what Peking characterizes as
 Moscow's policy of "encirclement."   There is little doubt
 that Soviet gains this year along China's periphery,
 particularly in Vietnam,  gave an additional impetus to
 Peking's emerging anti-Soviet diplomatic offensive.
 China moved last May to reaffirm publicly its support
 for Kim I1?-song.   Hua Kuo-teng,  in his first trip abroad
 as China's party chief,    explicitly endorsed Kim 11-song's
 regime as the sole legitimate government of Korea.   Although

 25X1
 North Korea has responded to the Hua visit by more
 openly endorsing China's position on a range of international
 issues.   Most significantly,  Pyongyang backed Peking in its
 border dispute with Moscow by taking the unusual step of
 republishing on 1 August excerpts from a shrill anti-
 Soviet article by the Chinese Defense Minister that blamed
 the Soviet Union for fanning tensions along the frontier.
 The Soviet Union moved quickly to signal its displeasure
 with North Korea's more pronounced tilt toward China.   The
 Soviets dispatched an unusually low-ranked representative
 to North Korea's important 30th anniversary celebrations.
 And Moscow not only granted a visa to a. South Korean cabinet
 officer to attend an international conference in the USSR,
 but also admitted two South Korean correspondents to cover
 the event.   The Soviet action is not unprecedented--Moscow
 has in the past granted visas to South Koreans to attend
 Soviet-sponsored conferences--but these were to lower-level
 functionaries.   The invitations received heavy press play
 in Seoul,  and China took pleasure in publicly noting the
 latest uncomradely Soviet actions.
 The Japanese Factor
 Relations between Tokyo and Seoul have been gradually
 improving in the past few years,  and the Japanese are
 continuing to spotlight their ties with South Korea.   Since
 the announcement of the US decision to withdraw its ground
 forces from the peninsula,  Tokyo has repeatedly told Seoul
 that it would convey to the US the two nations'  shared
 concerns over South Korean security.   The South Koreans
 have responded by publicly endorsing the recently concluded
 Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and by adopting
 a more cooperative attitude toward territorial problems
 that have been sources of friction in the past.
 Prime Minister. Fukuda's latest initiative--the public
 announcement of his desire for a meeting with President Pak--

 25X1
 25X1
 is another move designed to warm relations.   Fukuda, who is
 considering meeting with Pak around the end of the year,
 probably hopes to assuage the conservative,  pro-South Korean
 elements in his own party who have been critical of the
 recent conclusion of the Peace and Friendship Treaty with
 China.
 Given Tokyo's emphasis on improving relations with
 Seoul,  the Japanese are unlikely to explore political
 contacts with North Korea for the time being.   Although
 Fukuda and other government leaders believe that Tokyo
 has a diplomatic role to play in searching for a more
 stable political environment on the peninsula,  they will
 remain attuned to South Korean interests.   Tokyo,  for
 instance,  is likely to respond positively to Seoul's
 private suggestions that the Japanese use their good
 offices to investigate the chances for South Korean contacts
 with Peking and Moscow.
 None of these developments appears to herald funda-
 mental change in the major powers'tacit support for the
 status quo on the Korean peninsula.   Pyongyang's more
 pronounced tilt toward Peking followed by Soviet gestures
 toward Seoul is a pattern that has been noted before.   We
 anticipate that North Korea will eventually seek to improve
 its relations with the USSR.   Kim I1--song knows that China
 cannot supply the kinds of sophisticated military hardware
 or the massive economic assistance that the Soviet Union
 is capable of providing.
 The US Withdrawal
 The key element of change on the Korean peninsula
 is the US decision to remove its ground combat forces from
 South Korea.   The partial and phased nature of the with-
 drawal,                      the efforts to enhance South Korea's capability
 to defend itself,  and the reaffirmation of the US security
 commitment to Seoul have helped soften the impact. of the
 decision to withdraw.   Nevertheless,  the presence of US
 ground troops near the Demilitarized Zone has long been
 regarded as the most credible manifestation of US resolve

 25X1
 Approved For Release 200 /05/25 : CIA-RDP80T 0634A000400010045-3
 to stand behind its South Korean ally.
 Kim Il-song has publicly criticized the US withdrawal
 as incomplete and too protracted.   Nevertheless, Pyongyang
 has moderated its criticism of the US,  and it has generally
 avoided the kind of tension-building incidents that have
 frequently marred the truce along the Demilitarized Zone.
 Pyongyang's relative restraint seems to reflect Kim's
 desire to avoid actions that might slow down or reverse
 the withdrawal, at least in its initial phases.   Two notable
 exceptions are North Korea's continued efforts to infiltrate
 political agents and small armed reconnaissance teams into
 the South and its persistant attempts to construct tunnels
 under the Demilitarized Zone.
 North Korea will be watching closely the reaction in
 Moscow and Peking as the US moves ahead on ground force
 withdrawals.   Kim Il-song knows that the interests of the
 major powers intersect in the Korean peninsula in important
 ways.   He recognizes that Chinese and Soviet support for
 his course is constrained by the desire of both to avoid
 complicating their relations with the US and Japan.   He
 will be looking for signs that, as the withdrawal proceeds,
 his allies might be more inclined to increase their support
 or at least lower their commitment to stability on the
 peninsula.
 In keeping with their generally low-key approach to
 the Korean question,  the Soviets and Chinese have not
 commented extensively on the US troop withdrawal plan or
 the recent revision of its first phase.   In their public
 reaction they have emphasized that the retention of US air
 power in South Korea means there is no real change in the
 situation.   This emphasis on the status quo seems to reflect
 their concern that the withdrawal be accomplished in a
 manner that does not disrupt the basic political and military
 balance on the peninsula.
 Kim will almost certainly press Moscow and Peking for
 increased military assistance in the event that US force
 reductions are accompanied by a substantial upgrading of
 South Korean military capabilities.   This pressure will. be
 difficult to resist, especially if Kim can present a

 25X1
 25X1
 convincing case that the US assistance package poses a
 significant threat to North Korea.   Given the pattern
 of Soviet and Chinese restraint in shipping arms in recent
 years and the strategic equities involved,  neither ally is
 likely to respond to requests for offsetting aid in a manner
 that would upset the military equilibrium in the region.
 Looking to the future,  it is possible that North Korea's
 financial plight,  in combination with the continued strengthen-
 ing of South Korea's economic and military power, might
 prompt Kim at some point to abandon his efforts to maintain
 a balance in his ties with Moscow and Peking.   Kim might
 even consider aligning his country with one or the other in
 order to extract: maximum support and assistance.   In such
 a move, however, he would risk having to bow to outside
 influence and control--an outcome that Kim has long struggled
 to avoid.
 Kim would probably take this step only as a last
 resort and only after other alternatives had been explored.
 North Korea continues to attempt to foster political and
 economic contacts with the non-Communist world,  and it
 displays scant concern for the sensitivities of its major
 Communist allies--as demonstrated most recently by its
 unilateral declaration of a 50-mile coastal. security zone.
 Although China and the USSR have indicated their lack
 of enthusiasm for Kim 11-song's reunification efforts,
 their rivalry limits the extent to which either is prepared
 to restrain the North Korean leader.   On the diplomatic
 front,  for example,  neither has been willing to push Kim
 in directions he does not want want to go.   They have made
 clear that their participation in multilateral talks on
 the future of the Korean peninsula will be subject to North
 Korea's acceptance.
 Over the years, nevertheless, Pyongyang has exhibited
 great concern over the possibility of a Korean settlement
 imposed by the major powers--as is evident in Pyongyang's
 intense attacks on various proposals for "two Koreas" and
 for "cross recognition."   Recent events unquestionably

 have magnified these worries.   Last December visiting East
 German leader Honecker,  acting at Soviet behest,  lectured
 Kim on the applicability of a two Germanies solution for
 Korea.   Early this year the Western press played up Ambassador
 Woodcock's remarks about the shared interests between the
 US and China and China's potential role in maintaining
 stability in Northeast Asia.   President Tito's proposal in
 March for tripartite talks on Korea, with. the Pak government
 as a full participant,  received widespread media attention--
 except in Pyongyang, where it was greeted with stony silence.
 Lastly, North Korea almost surely views with apprehension
 the recent conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship
 Treaty.   Given Japan's close ties with North Korea's  southern
 adversary,  Pyongyang probably sees more potential for harm     25X1
 than good coming out of such a treaty.   During his recent
 visit to Tokyo, Chinese leader Teng Hsiao-ping seemed to go
 out of his way to assuage North     ea's concerns.
 ITeng hewed closely to
 Pyongyang's position that a pullout of US forces is a
 necessary precondition for a resumption of the political
 dialogue between the North and South.
 Significantly the treaty comes at a time when Pyongyang
 finds itself even more dependent on Chinese assistance.
 Indeed,  China's generosity may have been the price it had to
 pay to ensure that Pyongyang's unease about the treaty
 would remain private and circumspect..
