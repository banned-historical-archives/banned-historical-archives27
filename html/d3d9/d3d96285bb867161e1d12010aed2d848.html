THE MOUNT IN REFUGER CRISIS IN 
SOUTH VIETNAM 
Mr. TYDINGS. Mr. President, today's 
New York Times carries an article about 
the work of the Refugees and Escapees 
Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee chaired by the able and dis-
tinguished junior Senator from Massa-
chusetts, EDWARD M. KENNEDY. 
For the past 2 months, the subcom-
mittee has been holding extensive hear-
ings on the mounting refugee crisis in 
South .Vietnam. The hearings have 
probed deeply into the problems and 
dilemmas involved in the humanitarian 
effort to help these hundreds of thou-
sands of homeless men, women and chil-
dren fleeing from their war-torn villages 
and rice fields. 
As a member of Senator KENNEDY'S ? 
subcommittee, I am delighted to note 
that the subcommittee's work has ap-
parently resulted in a significant change 
in administration policy toward the re-
fugee problem in South Vietnam. For 
the first time, a major portion of our AID 
program in South Vietnam will be di-
rectly devoted to the health and proper 
settlement of these needy and hapless 
refugees. The problems are substantial. 
There is much to be done but it is heart-
ening that we are taking important steps 
in the right direction. 
Great credit is due to the distin-
guished junior Senator from Massachu-
setts for under his effective leadership 
the work of the subcommittee has been 
constructive and productive. I am sure 
that under his able chairmanship, the 
subcommittee will continue to explore 
and recommend further improvements 
and solutions in our programs toward 
refugees. 
I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
dent, that today's article from the New 
York Times, written by their able cor-
respondent, Richard Eder, be reprinted 
at this point in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
U.S. REFUGEE PLAN FOR VIETNAM SET?SEN-
ATE HEARINGS DISCLOSED INCOHERENCE OF 
PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS 
(By Richard Eder) 
WASHINGTON, August 30.?The United 
States, reversing a previous policy, is setting 
up a full-scale program to assist the 400,000 
refugees made homeless by the Vietnam 
fighting. 
The decision to make refugee assistance a 
principal concern of the U.S. aid Mission in 
Vietnam was in large part a result of recent 
hearings on the refugee problem conducted 
by Senator EDWARD KENNEDY of Massachu-
setts, according to U.S. officials. 
Eight hearings held by a Senate subcom-
mittee on refugees of which Mr. KENNEDY 
is chairman brought out, as one high official 
of the Agency for International Development 
said, that "in effect we have had no refugee t 
program as such." 
SEVERAL STEPS TAKEN 
Over the last 3 weeks the State Departmen 
and the Agency have taken a number o 
steps to set one up. Among them are the 
following: 
Approximately 40 officials of the Agency 
for International Development in Vietnam 
have been put to work full time on refugee 
problems. A great many other members of 
the 700-man AID mission will spend a major 
part of their time dealing with refugees. 
For example, according to one AID official 
here, 80 percent of the public health team 
will be assigned to refugees. 
The administration is looking for a can-
didate to fill a new high-level job coordinat-
ing refugee programs. On one hand, he will 
act as an adviser to the Saigon Government. 
On the other, he will be able to draw on all 
the resources of the AID mission for assist-
ance. 
The first thorough studies of the refugees 
are now being made. These will include how 
many there are, where they are and how they 
are living, and in just what ways they are 
being helped now. 
ESTIMATES ARE TENTATIVE 
United States has not had specific programs 
t for the refugees. They received without 
f special emphasis, a portion of the assistance 
under regular programs. Former Ambassa-
dor Maxwell D. Taylor and his aid chief, 
James S. Killen, believed that refugee as-
sistance should be an initiative of the Saigon 
authorities with the United States providing 
help as requested. 
Partly because of a lack of interest and 
competence and partly because of the mas-
sive increase of refugees, this formula was 
not working. 
According to AID officials, this was brought 
. home by a series of alarming reports from 
the interior. Henry Cabot Lodge, the new 
Ambassador, told the Senate subcommittee 
earlier this month that the situation was 
gravely unsatisfactory. 
According to officials here, the new pro-
gram will still be designed to work through 
the Saigon government as much as possible. 
The difference will be that the United States 
will now take an active part in recommend-
ing measures and in providing money, per-
sonnel, and political pressure. 
The U.S. Government does not now know 
how many refugees there are. South Viet-
namese Government figures, which are not 
considered accurate, give rise to tentative 
estimates that there are 200,000 in camps and 
an equal number crowded into urban slums. 
Virtually all of these came in during the 
Vietcong offensive in February and March, 
and during the monsoon fighting of May, 
June, and July. In recent weeks the influx 
appears to have tapered off somewhat. 
Still another 200,000 who fled their homes 
In 1964 and earlier have been resettled. 
Aid administered by private agencies, 
Which was to run at $8.5 million this year, 
is expected to rise considerably. Further-
more, the private agencies are expected to 
work out a program for closer cooperation 
with each other and with the U.S. program. 
The Senate hearings disclosed a, lack of 
proper coordination. A coordinating com-
mittee set up in Saigon has been rather in-
active, the hearings showed. 
Today President Johnson announced that 
he would send Dr. Howard A. Rusk, director 
of the Institute of Physical Medicine and 
Rehabilitation of the New York University 
Medical Center, to study the private agen-
cies' work in Vietnam. 
Dr. Rusk, who helped to organize a program 
of relief for refugees from the Korean war, 
is expected to survey the opportunities for 
private relief work, as well as the means of 
overcoming what is described as the spotty 
use by the agencies of available U.S. logistic 
support. 
In Vietnam, the United States has had the 
Government send teams around to provincial 
governments to spur their programs. Some 
$12 million is available to the provincial 
authorities, but little has been spent. 
In part, according. to officials here, this 
stems from the fact that many provincial offi-
cials are unfamiliar with the rules for using 
this money. In other instances, the officials 
do not want to spend the money for fear of 
being accused of favoritism by the residents 
of the area. 
ESTIMATES ARE DIFFICULT 
Since many details are still being worked 
out, officials here are unable to give a close 
estimate of how much the program will cost. 
One rough estimat 
on. Any 
calculations are complicated, however, by the 
fact that much of the aid will be a rechan-
neling of existing programs. 
For example, the major part of U.S. health, 
education, and possibly housing programs in 
Vietnam will now be specifically aimed at 
he refugees. 
Until now, according to AID officials, the

TRIBUTE TO MRS. GENIE McGLAS-
SON OF LINCOLN, NEBR., FOUND-
ER OF THE AMERICAN LEGION 
POPPY DAY 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. President, a dis-
tinguished Nebraska lady who, over a 
long period of years, gave in vast meas-
ure the efforts of her heart and hands to 
the welfare of the Nation's disabled vet-
erans has passed from the mortal scene. 
On July 28, 1965, Mrs. Genie McGlas-
son died at Lincoln, Nebr., at the age of 
87. Mrs. McGlasson long will be revered 
as the founder of the American Legion 
Poppy Day, an event which has done so 
much to further the rehabilitation and 
child welfare work carried on by the 
American Legion. Although originated 
by Mrs. McGlasson as a local effort, 
Poppy Day since has spread across the 
land and is nationally recognized as one 
of the American Legion's major pro-
grams. 
Indicative of the place of affection and 
esteem she occupied is the fact that the 
funeral service for Mrs. McGlasson was 
the first ever held at the veterans ad-
ministration hospital at Lincoln. 
I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Presi-
dent, that two articles be inserted in the 
RECORD at this point. They are taken 
from the August 1965 issue of the Legion 
Auxiliary Star, department of Nebraska. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
SHE LEAVES A SPOT THAT WILL BE HARD

Mrs. Genie McGlasson, rehabilitation 
chairman and hospital director for the 
American Legion Auxiliary, department of 
Nebraska for 36 years, died July 28, 1965 in 
Lincoln, Nebr., at the age of 87. 
Mrs. McGlasson had spent all day Friday 
of the previous week at her regular duties, 
volunteer hospital director of the Lincoln 
Veterans Hospital; and was returned there 
on Saturday, July 31, to receive final honors 
from statewide friends. For the first time, a 
funeral was held at the 35-year-old hospital. 
The 10 a.m, service took place on the lawn 
before the open west porch where Mrs. Mc-
Glasson and patients years ago listened to 
band concerts. Salvation Army Maj. Charles

--
A Do en or GOOD 
Mrs. Genie McGlasson, 87, longtime resi-
dent of Lincoln, is dead. 
She will be remembered for a long while 
as the woman who started Poppy Day. But 
we are sure that this national institution was 
not started for her personal aggrandizement. 
She was too sincere for that. 
Mrs. McGlasson was of the World War I 
generation who found her great life interest 
in veterans affairs, and, especially, the wel-
fare and comfort of the men whose lives 
were wrecked by war. The Lincoln Veterans 
Hospital was more to her than a community 
asset. It was the place where disabled vet-
erans would be required to spend their lives. 
They could not go out into the world, but 
she brought the world to them--a very good 
world. 
There is not much a disabled veteran can 
do, and the days hang heavy for them. 
Mrs. McGlasson taught them how to take a 
little wire and a little crepe paper and make 
poppies. Then it naturally followed that the 
poppies would be sold to the public and the 
returns dedicated to the American Legion's 
rehabilitation and child welfare committee. 
An infinite amount of comfort to a great 
many resulted from her plain idea. A little 
wire, a little crepe paper, some willing dis-
abled veterans developed enormous power for 
good. It is something that science has not 
been able to match, nor ever will because it 
includes the precious element of humani-
tarianism as it exists in people. 
Mrs. McGlasson's work succeeded beyond 
measure but she exemplified the good that 
human compassion and interest can do and 
she heads the list of the many who with 
less acknowledgment and smaller effect do 
the same. We call that kind blessed. 
CONVICTS, COMPUTERS, AND THE 
NUMBERS GAME 
Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, an age-old 
problem confronting those who admin-
ister penal institutions is how best to 
Lrain and rehabilitate inmates for the 
the employees of the Indianapolis Works 
employees of the Western Electric Co., 
described in some detail the excellent 
results achieved in helping to train pris-
oners for this important new field. Be-
cause it has national significance, I ask 
unanimous consent that this article in 
the August 1965 issue of Dial Tone be 
printed at the conclusion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CONVICTS, COMPUTERS, AND THE NUMBERS GAME 
Behind the high prison wails that once held 
budding badman John Dillinger, inmates of 
Indiana's maximum-security reformatory at 
Pendleton have figuratively shed their blue 
collars to learn data processing, one of Amer-
ica's fastest growing white-collar professions. 
Not far from where other convicts are learn-
ing more conventional semiskilled repair or 
service trades, a carefully screened group of 
young prisoners staff the first data processing 
training school ever set up inside a prison. 
Reformatory inmate No. 46252 (names will 
not be used to avoid embarrassment to their 
families, though they're used universally in 
conversations here) characterizes the elite 
inmate staff that operates this unique cen-
ter. 
Bright, with an aptitude for data process-
ing work, he has survived one of the toughest 
inmate screening boards and the most rigor-
ous training course in the institution. 
Chances are he'll be a low-risk parole violator 
when he gets out. 
And the success of the program in the past 
4 years has led skeptical prison officials to 
consider this one of the most promising, 
progressive self-rehabilitation efforts ever 
undertaken, 
FIFTEEN-HOUR DAY 
One role of the center is to train fellow 
inmates; another is to process data for the 
institution. During his 15-hour-long day, 
No. 46252 teaches computer classes for new 
students and handles his share of the bur-
geoning workload. He earns between 8 and 
18 cents a day. 
In the 4 years of its existence, the data 
center has expanded from a dingy three-room 
basement suite to more spacious, and color-
fully decorated, quarters covering some 5,000 
square feet. The inmate-computer expert 
is proud to point to what is considered one 
of the largest data processing libraries in the 
Midwest, jammed with books donated by 
sympathetic companies and individuals. 
WHAT TRAINING DOES 
William L. Perrin, Indiana Department of 
Corrections official who's been closest to the 
program since its start in 1961, explained 
what the training does for inmates. 
"Jail is the most degrading experience a 
man can ever go through," Perrin explained. 
"The one thing an inmate loses is his 
self-respect. Brought here," he said in a 
tour at Pendleton, "stripped of his civilian 
clothes, quarantined and slapped in a cell, 
he's at his lowest ebb." 
Progressive-minded rehabilitation officials 
feel that the exacting work of data proces-
sing, properly taught, helps the man develop 
a characteristic lacking in se many prison 
populations?precise analytical thought 
processes and a measure of self-confidence. 
Underlying the entire program is the hope 
of employment for trained programers,

the money bill will provide a forum for Sena-
tor HARTKE and his supporters. They came 
within three votes of recommitting the bill 
granting General McKee special treatment to 
enable him to collect about $8,000 a year in 
retirement benefits. Some of that support 
may be transferred into opposition to the 
supersonic transport appropriation although 
not enough to deny the President the money. 
Privately, those Senators pushing for the 
supersonic transport program generally and 
the $140 million specifically contend that 
there was no place other than the military 
to recruit the kind of experienced manage-
ment needed to run the billion-dollar effort. 
"Where are you going to get somebody 
who knows enough about the aircraft devel-
opment to run the supersonic transport pro-
gram," asked one Senator. "Do you really 
think you're going to get a $75,000-a-year 
man from Boeing or Douglas or any place else 
to work for the FAA for less than half that 
money? We're getting near the metal cut-
ting stage now. Where are you going to go 
to get somebody who really knows aircraft 
development and procurement if you don't 
go to the military?" 
Although Bain enjoyed considerable sup-
port within the aerospace industry during 
his tenure as FAA's supersonic transport 
chief, backers of General Maxwell counter 
Bain's work was mainly organizing the Gov-
ernment's paper effort. The hardware stage, 
they contend, demands a breadth of ex-
perience different from the experience Bain 
brought to the job. 
One byproduct of having military officers 
at the forefront of the civilian supersonic 
transport development is bound to be a full 
assessment of the military potential of the 
aircraft, despite the contention of Defense 
Secretary Robert S. McNamara that there is 
no military requirement for it. This could 
be a most significant byproduct, including 
the very real possibility that the Defense De-
partment eventually will pay for part of the 
supersonic transport's development?perhaps 
the engines. 
DEPARTURE OF BAIN SPURS CONCERN OVER 
FuTuan FAA DIRECTION OF SST 
WAsniNcroN.?Gordon M. Bain's decision 
to leave the Federal Aviation Agency where 
he has directed the supersonic transport 
program since 1963 has created concern 
among airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
over the future of the program. 
Adding to the uncertainty is the appoint-
ment of Air Force Brig. Gen. Jewell C. Max-
well, to replace Bain. 
Bain's resignation is effective September 
15. Bain said it was for "personal reasons" 
and that he plans to return to private in-
dustry, ' although he has not said where or 
what his new job will be. 
Bain was considered to have a sympathetic 
understanding for the problems faced by 
both the airlines and the airframe and en-
gine manufacturers in developing a practical 
transport. 
"We differed with him on a lot of points, 
but at least you could argue constructively 
with him," one airline equipment planner 
said. 
The fact that the supersonic transport is 
a commercial enterprise, and that it is to be 
directed by an active-duty Air Force general, 
is the basis for most of the current concern. 
However, Gen. William F. McKee, FAA Ad-
ministrator, said in making the appointment 
that General Maxwell was the best man he 
could find who had lengthy experience in 
R. & D. work. 
The :,,ob Bain holds pays $24,500 a year, 
Which is not considered high by industry 
standards for a project like the supersonic 
transport. 
General Maxwell, 48, is presently com-
mander of the Air Force Western Test Range 
at Vandenberg APB, Calif. Among his re-
search and development activities was serv-
ice as chief military coordinator in devel-
opment of the Boeing B-52 bomber. 
He is a former chief of staff of USAF 
Systems Command, and in 1963 was chair-
man of the aircraft committee of Project 
Forecast, which. included analysis of future 
Air Force needs for transports. For 5 years 
he was chief of the bomber aircraft division 
at Wright-Patterson AFB. General Maxwell 
flew 44 missions as a Martin B-26 pilot in 
World War II, and was executive officer of the 
386th Bomb Group in the European Theater 
of Operations. 
He holds a mechanical engineering degree 
from the University of Tennessee, a masters 
degree in aeronautical engineering from 
Princeton University, and is a graduate of 
the War College. 
Industry sources are avoiding any public 
comments on the merits of General McKee's 
bringing a fellow Air Force officer into the 
supersonic transport program. The airlines 
are particularly anxious to see to what ex-
tent General Maxwell will seek their ad-
vice. 
"The supersonic transport must be de-
veloped in a fish bowl, without any secrecy," 
one airline officials said. "The airlines do not 
buy off-the-shelf aircraft. Each one, even 
though it is a basic model, must have fea-
tures desired by the individual carrier." 
At present, FAA sources said, the only part 
of the supersonic transport still covered by 
Defense Department security is performance 
and interior technology on the engines. 
Bain told Aviation Week & Space Tech-
nology that he felt now was the most op-
portune time for him to resign. 
"When I took this job in 1963, I had no 
intention of seeing it through to the end," 
Bain said. "My job was to pull everything 
together and get It headed forward in good 
order. That has been done, and the pat-
tern for the next 18 months is set. So I 
feel it is a good time for me to step out." 
Industry officials who have worked closely 
with Bain acknowledge that he has kept the 
program working smoothly and that schedule 
deadlines have been met. The main point 
of disagreement between himself and the 
industry has been over the eventual produc-
tion of flying prototypes?the industry want-
ing two and Bain insisting on one. 
"We in the industry know that the best 
airplane and engine always comes from an 
Intense competition," one airline official said, 
"but recognize that Gordon might have had 
a tough time convincing the Government 
that the added expense * * * was justified." 
Bain's leading role in the program also was 
affected when President Johnson named De-
fense Secretary Robert S. McNamara to head 
a special advisory committee whose recom-
mendations led to the recent phase 2C re-
search decision. 
Spokesmen said it was apparent during 
negotiations on the phase 2C contracts that 
Bain was not in complete agreement with 
the order to continue research for another 
18 months. 
"We cannot expect delivery of a U.S. super-
sonic transport now before 1975," one indus-
try spokesman said. "But Gordon agreed 
with those of us v,ho know we could have it 
ready by 1973." 
THE THEORY THAT THE VIETNAM-
ESE COMMUNISTS ARE BASIC-
ALLY ANTI-CHINESE 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are 
frequently assured by those who urge an 
American withdrawal from Vietnam 
that our withdrawal will not result in 
turning Vietnam and southeast Asia over 
to the effective political control by Pei-
ping. We are told that the Vietnamese 
Communists are basically anti-Chinese, 
that Ho Chi Minh is basically another 
Tito, and that the most effective way of 
assuring the continued independence 
over Vietnam from Peiping would be to 
turn the entire country over to the con-
trol of the so-called Nationalist Com-
munists. 
Mr. President, I believe that the most 
effective answer to those who entertain 
these theories was recently given by the 
Chairman of the Presidium of the Na-
tional Liberation Front of South Viet-
nam, in a letter to Mao Tse-tung. This 
letter was broadcast over Peiping domes-
tic service on August 19. Let me quote 
to you the words of the broadcast letter 
to the patron saint of the Chinese 
Communists: 
On behalf of the South Vietnam people 
and the NFLSV, and in my own name, I 
would like to extend the warmest and high-
est respect to you, the great leader of the 
Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese 
people. The South Vietnamese people are 
deeply inspired by receiving the full and 
valuable sympathy and support from the 
Chinese Communist Party and the fraternal 
Chinese people in their patriotic and just 
struggle and war of resistance against the 
U.S. imperialist aggressors and their lackeys 
and for national independence. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this inserted into the 
RECORD at this point, the entire text of 
the letter from Nguyen Huu Tho to Mao 
Tse-tung. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, RS follows: 
[Communist China, International Affairs, 
Aug. 20, 1965] 
NFLSV CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO MAO TSE-TUNG 
Chairman Mao Tse-tung recently received 
a letter from Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of 
the Presidium of the NFLSV Central Com-
mittee, thanking the Chinese people for their 
support to the South Vietnam people in 
their struggle against U.S. imperialist ag-
gression, At the same time, Chairman Liu 
Shao-chi, NPC Chairman Chu Te, and Pre-
mier Chou En-lai also received letters from 
Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho. The letters were 
hand delivered to Premier Chou En-lai by 
Tran Van Trung, head of the NFLSV perma-
nent delegation to China, on August 12. 
The full text of Chairman Nguyen Huu 
Tho's letter to Chairman Mao Tse-tung reads: 
SOUTH VIETNAM, 
June 1 , 1965. 
CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG OF THE CCP 
CENTRAL COMMITTEZ. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN: On behalf of the South 
Vietnam people and the NFLSV, and in my 
own name, I would like to extend the warm-
est and highest respect to you, the great 
leader of the Chinese Communist Party and 
the Chinese people. The South Vietnam 
people are deeply inspired by receiving the 
full and valuable sympathy and support from 
the Chinese Communist Party and the fra-
ternal Chinese people in their patriotic and 
Just struggle and war of resistance against 
the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their 
lackeys and for national independence. 
The historic statement issued by you on 
August 29, 1963, on the South Vietnam ques-
tion is of great significance to the revolu-
tionary cause of the South Vietnam people. 
It also demonstrated once again the close, 
solid militant friendship between the Chinese 
and South Vietnam people, and has strength-
ened further our solid strength to defeat the 
U.S. aggressors. 
To avoid its inevitable defeat in South 
Vietnam, U.S. imperialism is exerting great 
efforts to intensify its war of aggression 
against South Vietnam, has dispatched to

lack of education, lack of love, have little 
chance of rising above the culture of de-
spair. 
Birth control does not solve all the prob-
lems of poverty. But it does help the poor 
regulate the growth of their families. Ex-
penses are cut. The health of the mother 
improves because she isn't having too many 
children too quickly. The fear of bearing 
another child, who might mean increased 
poverty, diminishes. 
The costs of unwanted and unplanned chil-
dren are immeasurable. The human suffer-
ing caused by and to them and the financial 
strain on the family and community are 
more than we realize. Among low income, 
low educated parents surveyed recently, 54 
percent of their children were unplanned and 
unwanted. For every 100 patients visiting 
a planned parenthood center in 1962: 66 
have incomes of $74 or less per week; 33 are 
on welfare or have incomes of less than $50 
a week; 78 are less than 30 years old; 21 are 
less than 20 years old; and 69 have three 
children or less. 
What are the economic aspects of in-
creased population in the United States? 
1. Increasingly, we may expect our rapid 
increase in numbers to burden, rather than 
accelerate, our economy. 
1. Increased expenditures?mostly public 
funds?needed to supply schools and colleges, 
health facilities, housing, water supplies, 
transportation, power, etc., for the expanding 
population will mean a substantially higher 
tax burden and bigger government. 
3. This year 4 million new babies will be 
born in the United States, and betWeen 15 
and 20 percent of all tax revenues will have 
to be spent simply to give them basic 
services. 
4. The U.S. Office of Education estimates 
that Americans spent $32 billion last year 
on schooling?three-quarters of it from tax 
funds. 
What must be done to meet this challenge? 
1. Research on a far larger scale must be 
supported on the biological and medical as-
pects of human reproduction so improved 
methods of fertility control are developed. 
2. The American people must be informed 
ca: the enormous problems inherent in un-
checked population growth here RS well as 
abroad. 
3. A sense of responsibility must be devel-
oped concerning marriage and parenthood, 
including the responsibility of bringing into 
the world only those children whom parents 
want and are prepared adequate to care for 
and educate. 
4. Existing knowledge about birth control 
at low or no cost must be made available to 
those who need and wish such information 
and guidance. 
The Federal Government has spent mil-
lions of dollars in research so that the health 
of the world could be improved. The effec-
t,veness of our federally financed research in 
cooperation with private enterprise has been 
60 effective that we have now virtually elim-
inated many of the killer diseases and our 
death rate is now very low. Now our public 
health officials must concern themselves with 
the increase in population which threatens 
the health and well-being of many millions 
of people. 
In my judgment, action is required. I 
suggest: 
1. Public health organiations at all levels 
of government should give increased atten-
tion to the impact of population change on 
health. 
2. Scientific research should be greatly ex-
panded on (a) all aspects of human fertility; 
and (b) the interplay of biological, psycho-
logical, and socioeconomic factors influencing 
population change. 
3. Public and private programs concerned 
with population growth and family size 
should be integral parts of the health pro-
gram and should include medical advice and 
services which are acceptable to the individ-
uals concerned. 
4. Pull freedom should be extended to all 
population groups for the selection and use 
of such methods for the regulation of family 
size as are consistent with the creed and 
more of the individuals concerned. 
Recognizing that the population problem, 
nationally and internationally, has become a 
serious crisis, we must determine a course of 
action. I recognize that a great deaiof work 
has already been done by the drug firms 
throughout America and other interested 
organizations. Nothing should be done to 
detract from their achievements. In fact, we 
should compliment their efforts. 
Our public health officials should fully 
utilize the devices and information that are 
now available. It is my understanding that 
even though our law provides that money can 
be used for family-planning services, few 
agencies use it. Our officials must face up to 
their responsibilities. 
We must mount an educational program 
that will inform the American public of the 
wisdom and advisability of planning parent-
hood. There has been substantial informa-
tion and know-how collected. It intist now 
be used. 
Mr. Chairman, the meetings that we have 
held have been most informative and most 
valuable. I am hopeful that the great reser-
voir of knowledge that has been pulled to-
gether will be used by the Federal Govern-
ment and State governments in their efforts 
to meet these population problems and the 
problems experienced by our individual citi-
zens who must concerfi themselves with the 
need for planning their families. I have 
appreciated serving on this committee and am 
grateful for the opportunity of presenting 
this statement. 
THE SUPERSONIC TRANSPORT 
PROGRAM 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, two 
articles published in the August 30, 1965, 
issue of Aviation Week demonstrate a 
continuing concern over the future of 
the civilian agencies of our Government, 
especially the FAA. 
The military takeover is continuing at 
a steady pace and again should be an 
item of national discussion. The two 
articles are well written and of Senate 
interest, and I therefore ask unanimous 
consent that they may be printed in the 
RECORD at this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
CONGRESS To APPROVE 8$T MONEY REQUEST?
MAJOR OPPOSITION UNLIKELY, I3UT PROTEST 
BUILDS ON APPOINTMENT OF USAF OFFICER 
'CO HEAD FAA PROGRAM 
(By George C. Wilson) 
WASHINGTON. --Congress within the next 
few days will approve President Johnson's 
request for $140 million in fiscal 1968 funds 
fur the supersonic transport program but 
not without protesting what some Members 
contend is militarization of the Federal Avi-
ation Agency. 
Chairman, GEORGE H. MAHON, Democrat, 
of Texas, of the House' Appropriations Com-
mittee, told Aviation Week & Space Tech-
nology there was no significant opposition 
in the House to the President's supersonic 
transport money request. "I think people 
am sold on the idea that this supersonic 
transport is desirable. I think it will be a 
routine thing" to get House approval. 
But a protest is building in the Senate, led 
by Senator VANCE BATLIKE, Democrat, of In-
diana. He said lie is "very disturbed" over 
the imminent replacement of Gordon Bain, 
21529 
deputy administrator for supersonic trans-
port development, by an Air Force general 
and intends to make an issue of it when the 
money request reaches the Senate, if not 
before. , Senator HanicE objected to the 
naming of USAF Gen. William 1'. McKee (re-
tired) as FAA administrator on grounds it 
amounted to militarizing the civilian agency 
(Aviation Week & Space Technology, June 
28, p. 31). 
WEATHERS ATTACK 
Although General McKee weathered this 
attack and was confirmed, the whole ques-
tion will be raised again because General 
McKee has announced that USAF Brig. Gen, 
Jewell C, Maxwell will replace Bain. 
To blunt expected criticism of militariza-
tion of the FAA, General McKee told the 
Senate that while General Maxwell was join-
ing the agency another general was leaving 
It?USAF Maj. Gen. M. S. White, Federal air 
surgeon. Dr. Peter V. Siegel, a civilian who 
has been serving as Chief of the FAA Aero-
medical Certification Division at the Office 
of Aviation Medicine in Oklahoma City, will 
replace General White. 
Senator IlmarNE contends that the arrival 
of, General Maxwell end departure of General 
White do not balance out because of the 
overwhelming importance of the civilian 
supersonic transport program. He has asked 
General McKee why the title oil the job to be 
held by General Maxwell has been changed 
from deputy director for supersonic transport 
development, to "director, supersonic trans-
port program." 
Other questions Senator HARTKE has asked 
General McKee by letter to answer are: "Why 
was a military man selected for this position? 
Was any search made for a civillan to fill this 
position? Is any civilian technically com-
petent and qualified to fill this important 
position? Is there any civilian in the avia-
tion industry technically competent and 
qualified to fill this position? is there any 
civilian in any of our aviation engineering 
schools, such as Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, California School of Technology, 
Purdue or others, who could fill this posi-
tion? Is it considered necessary that a mili-
tary man take this post? If 60, should the 
supersonic transport development program 
be transferred from the Federal Aviation 
Agency to the jurisdiction of the Pentagon?" 
Chairman A. S. MIKE MONRONEY, Democrat, 
of Oklahoma, of the Senate Aviation Sub-
committee, who has championed the super-
sonic transport in the Senate in the past, 
said, "I don't expect a flap" over the replace-
ment of Bain by General Maxwell. Whether 
there will be a sizable fight when the $140 
million appropriation reaches the Senate 
floor, or before, depends on how much sup-
port Senator HARTKE recruits. 
The House Appropriations Committee will 
lump the $140-million for the supersonic 
transport with. other Presidential requests for 
fiscal 1966 supplemental appropriations. 
The whole bill will be voted within the next 
few days. Then it goes to the Senate special 
subcommittee for supplemental requests, 
headed by Senator JOHN 0. PairroRE, Demo-
crat, of Rhode Island. Senator MONRONEY is 
on this subcommittee and probably will de-
fend the supersonic transport money request 
when it reaches the Senate door. Because 
'Congress is pushing hard to get the money 
bills out of the way so it canadjourn as soon 
after Labor Day as possible, the supplemental 
appropriations will reach a vote in the Sen-
ate a few days after it clears the House. No 
separate bill authorizing the supplemental 
appropriations is required as in most regular 
Money bills. 
HARTKE'S roiroti 
Although the supplemental. appropriation 
for the supersonic transport is entirely sepa-
rate from the question of whether the ap-
pointments of Generals McKee and Maxwell 
threaten to militarize the FAA, the debate on

South Vietnam tens of thousands of U.S. 
troops and some troops of its vassal countries, 
and has continuously extended the bandit 
war to North Vietnam. At the same time, 
it has spread the so-called unconditional 
peace talks tricky offer, attempting to de-
ceive world opinion and to cover up its true 
aggression and bell1c,ose nature. However, 
the NFLSV Central Committee's five-point 
statement issued on March 22, 1965, has 
pointed out that the South Vietnam people 
are convinced that no frantic schemes, no 
tricky arguments, and no modern weapons 
and troops of 'U.S. imperialism and its vas-
sals could make the 14 million patriotic 
South Vietnam people submit or shake their 
will to fight and win. 
With the wholehearted sympathy and 
thorough support of the great 650 million 
Chinese people, the people of the various 
socialist countries, and all the peace-loving 
people throughout the world, our people in 
South Vietnam are resolutely taking up arms 
with the determination to fight to the last 
drop of blood in driving U.S. imperialism out 
of South Vietnam, liberating South Vietnam, 
and unifying .the fatherland in order to con-
tribute to the national liberation and the 
defense of peace in southeast Asia and the 
world. 
Our people in South Vietnam exceedingly 
admire the indomitable revolutionary spirit 
of the Chinese people, whom we follow as 
an example. The Chinese people, under the 
brilliant banner of the GCP which regards 
the people as master, have victoriously 
carried on long-term resistance and, with 
their brilliant example, inspired all the op-
pressed people throughout the world to wage 
the struggle for their liberation. 
Now, the Chinese people are building a 
prosperous and strong China through their 
laboring efforts and lofty spirit on self-reli-
ance, and making an important contribution 
to the lofty causes of revolution of the 
world's people and of world peace. 
The people of South Vietnam feel a great 
joy over all those brilliant achievements of 
the CCP and the great Chinese people and 
sincerely convey their wishes to the CCP and 
the Chinese people under your wise and bril-
liant leadership for still more brilliant suc-
cesses. 
I wish to take this opportunity in behalf 
of the people in South Vietnam and the Cen-

most sincere gratitude to you and wishing 
the best of health.

THE LOWER COLORADO RIVER 
BASIN WATER PLAN 
Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, in the

guished California citizens, public serv-
ants of my State in various fields, have 
testified before the House Committee on 
Interior and Insular Affairs in favor of 
legislation to provide for a Lower Colo-
rado River Basin water plan. The whole 
southwest area is in dire straits with re-
spect to the problem of water in the 
future. I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in RECORD at this point the state-
ments by the attorney general of Cali-
fornia, Thomas C. Lynch; Northcutt Ely, 
special counsel for the Colorado River 
Board of California, and six Agency

W. D. Maughan; the individual state-
ment of D. E. Cole, chief engineer of the 
No. 160-10 
Colorado River Board of California; and 
the Colorado River Basin seven-State 
consensus. 
There being no objection, the state-
ments were ordered to be printed hi the 
RECORD, as follows: 
STATEMENT BY CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL 
THOMAS C. LYNCH, APPEARING AT THE RE-
QUEST OF GOVERNOR EDMUND G. BROWN, 
BEFORE THE ROUSE COMMITTEE ON INTERIOR 
AND INSULAR AFFAIRS, WASHINGTON, D.C., 
AUGUST 24, 1965 
Mr. Chairman, my name is Thomas C. 
Lynch. I am the attorney general of Cali-
fornia. I have the honor to appear not only 
in that capacity, but at the request of the 
Governor of my State, Edmund G. Brown. 
He wants me to tell you that he would be 
here today but for the aftermath of the last 
two tragic weeks in our State. He wants me 
to tell you that he wholeheartedly and en-
thusiastically supports the legislation offered 
by 37 Representatives in Congress and by both 
California Senators. 
I assure you that a California consensus?
es close to unanimity as you Will find in a 
State of nearly 20 million people?supports 
the Governor in that position. 
That position is urged by the Colorado 
River Board of California, a State agency 
whose members are nominated by the public 
entities which have Colorado River water 
rights: The Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California, the Department of Wa-
ter and Power of the City of Los Angeles, the 
San Diego County Water Authority, Impe-
rial Irrigation District, Palo Verde Irriga-
tion District, and Coachella Valley County 
Water District. Each of these public agen-
cies supports the pending bill. 
Likewise, it has the most earnest support 
of our sister State?our historic water an-
tagonist With whom we are now in agree-
ment?Arizona. It has the support of Ne-
vada, which has a community of interest 
with both Arizona and California. It has 
the support in principle of the U.S. Govern-
ment, expressed by the Bureau of the Budget 
and the Secretary of the Interior. 
I hope and I believe that this legislation 
will come to have the strong support of other 
regions: the States of the upper Colorado 
River Basin and Western States outside the 
Colorado River Basin which may be benefited. 
It deserves the support of the entire Nation. 
The most immediate benefit will be to the 
Lower Colorado River Basin, whose problems 
produced this agreement after decades of 
embittered and futile combat. Benefits, less 
immediate but fully as substantial, will later 
accrue to areas adjacent to the Colorado 
River Basin. The precedent and the princi-
ple mark a legal and political breakthrough 
as important as any new scientific discovery 
in man's fight against drought. 
I was delighted to learn on Friday that 
representatives of the seven Colorado River 
basin States had agreed on basic principles 
for regional legislation. This is good news 
for the entire Nation. 
The seven-State accord is a second great 
step toward making regional water develop-
ment a reality. This accord will be as sig-
nificant as the original agreement between 
Arizona and California which established 
unity among the lower basin States?Arizona, 
California, and Nevada?earlier this year. 
Many problems remain, but they will also 
yield to the constructive spirit with which 
the seven States have approached their prob-
lems. I am sure this committee will give 
thorough attention to the unresolved prob-
lems as the hearings progress, I should like 
to confine myself to the very significant sub-
jects on which there now appears to be a 
meeting of the minds. 
The lower basin agreement which has 
united Arizona, California, and Nevada is, as 
I am sure everyone in this room fully realizes, 
an astonishing development. It came about 
when men of good will from all over the 
Colorado River basin became fully aware 
that the interests of our region can be served 
only by agreement and not by combat. We 
shall all face a continuing struggle and 
problems far more serious than anyone could 
have realized in 1952 when Arizona and Cali-
fornia squared off against each other for the 
fourth time in the U.S. Supreme Court. Now, 
'our struggle is against nature. It is a strug-
gle we can win if we are all together; which 
we shall surely lose if we are divided. 
I had the privilege of watching the agree-
ment happen. I shall tell you about it in 
some detail, because the time has come for 
further agreement?this time in the Congress 
of the United States. We look to this com-
mittee to fashion a final agreement which 
will serve the West and set a pattern for the 
rest of the country which is reaching the 
limits of available water, and which must 
eventually turn to regional planning as the 
basis of regional accomplishment. 
I became attorney general of California 
at the beginning of September 1964. The 
constitution of California imposed on me the 
responsibility of representing California in 
interstate litigation. I was told by some 
that the problems of the Colorado River were 
insoluble. The U.S. Supreme Court had 
entered a decree in Arizona v. California the 
preceding March. The decree had not set-
tled the problems of the Colorado. It had 
only framed some of the issues for renewed 
combat. I made it my first business to study 
the Colorado problem intensively. I have 
continued to do so. I discovered that these 
reports were in substance correct. Winston 
Churchill once described Russia as "a riddle 
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma." He 
might well have been speaking of the 
Colorado. 
The decree concluded one of the greatest 
trials in history. The purpose of the suit 
was to answer yes or no to the question posed 
in 1952 by the State of Arizona: Is there 
water to supply the Central Arizona project? 
The decree failed to answer that question. 
Instead, it answered two others: First, how is 
7.5 million acre-feet per year of consumptive 
use from the main river to be divided among 
Arizona, California, and Nevada? It is to be 
divided 2.8 million to Arizona, 4.4 million to 
California, 300,000 acre-feet to Nevada. 
Second, how is water in excess of 7.5 mil-
lion acre-feet to be divided among them? It 
is to be divided equally between Arizona and 
California, except that the Secretary of the 
Interior may by contract give 4 percent of 
the excess to Nevada, coming out of Arizona's 
50 percent. 
Lest there be any doubt, I repeat what 
my predecessor said, "We accept those deci-
sions. We do not ask Congress to change 
the Court's decree." 
Unfortunately, these omit the major ques-
tion which requires an answer: How Is less 
than 7.5 million acre-feet to be divided? 
Engineering opinion was unanimous that ul-
timately there would be no excess over 7.5 
million acre-feet for the three States. In 
time, them will be less than 7.5 million acre-
feet. But the court expressly refused to de-
cide how a supply of less than '7.5 million 
acre-feet would be divided. The court left 
that question to be decided by the Secretary 
of the Interior or the Congress. 
There are two limitations on the Secre-
tary's power: (1) "Present perfected rights" 
must be given interstate priority by the Sec-
retary before he allocates the remaining wa-
ter among the States. (2) The court will re-
view the Secretary's exercise of discretion. 
However, the quantities of "present perfect-
ed rights"?those exercised by use prior to 
1929 when the Boulder Canyon Project Act 
became effective and all Federal rights exist-

lug on that date--are left to future agree-
ment or litigation. The standards by which 
secretarial discretion is to be controlled are 
otherwise unspecified. 
As an alternative to a secretarial alloca-
tion, Congress can enact legislation provid-
ing for allocation of shortages if the main 
river supplies less than 7.5 million aere-feet. 
The court left unanswered the question 
Arizona had in effect asked the Supreme 
Court: "Is there water for the Central Ari-
zona project?" 
It left unanswered the question we in 
California face: "Is there to be a disastrous 
exception to the historic rule of law through-
out the West that water is never taken from 
existing projects to supply new projects to 
be built in the future?" We thought there 
could be only one answer. 
There was no possibility whatever that 
Arizona could be expected to yield that 
which Arizona had sought for a generation, 
and for which her need is increasingly great: 
the Central Arizona project. 
There VMS no possibility whatever that 
California would yield water used by her 
projects in order to build the Central Ari-
zona project, except as a decree by the Su-
preme Court had so determined. The 
Supreme Court had expressly and unani-
mously rejected the Special Master's recom-
mendation that proration of shortages with-
in the 7.5 million acre-feet should be im-
posed on the States. We demanded, as we 
had to, protection of existing projects. The 
Arizona Legislature twice sought the tame 
protection for Arizona's existing projects. 
Secretary Udall had suggested in two suc-
cessive regional plans a way to avoid the 
hard question to which the answer appeared 
so ruinous to Arizona or California. Our 
entire region is indebted to his inspiration, 
stimulated I am sure by the dreadful re-
sponsibility the Court had thrust on him to 
destroy either the hopes of Arizona or the 
existing projects of California. 
The resource of the Colorado is water. 
Water generates power. Power generates 
money. And through money the water sup-
ply can be made to replenish itself. Imports 
of water can avoid Shortages in the 7.5 
million acre-foot quantity. Water users in 
both States would be made whole to the 
extent of the decreed allocations out of that 
7.5 million acre-feet. 
The two Pacific Southwest water plans 
could not, however, overcome the handicap 
of lack of time,. Arizona's need for a Central 
Arizona project was immediate and urgent. 
Investigations, engineering, and economic 
studies were necessary for a project to im-
port water to replace Colorado River water 
exported to central Arizona. All three take 
substantial time, even on a crash basis. My 
State resisted--it had to resist--a Central 
Arizona project which would deplete the 
water available to California projects so long 
as replacement of that water was only a 
hope or a promise. 
After several months of study, I attended 
my first public meeting devoted to this un-
happy dilemma,. It was called in December 
by the Southern California Water Confer-
ence. Representatives from all over the 
Colorado River Basin were present. 
There was h serious?even grimly somber 
mood?of men patiently willing to state and 
restate without rancor their deeply held po-
sitions. Theirs was a firm determination 
not to compromise or suggest compromise in 
matters essential to survival. 
Californians protested they did not insist 
upon 4.4 million acre-feet from the Colorado 
and also water from some alternative source. 
But they could not yield that 4.4 million 
until the alternative source had been 
achieved. That would take time. " 
Californians also recognized Arizona's need. 
They did not want to insist that Arizona's 
overdrawn groundwater basins continue to 
be pumped without respite until a great 
regional plan to replace the central Arizona 
project supply could be readied for adoption 
as a whole. But they were determined to de-
fend California's 4.4 million acre-feet. 
At the end of the conference, this ques-
tion emerged: 
Is it possible to estimate the shortage in 
the Colorado River supply and provide for 
priority of existing projects until an im-
port of water to make up that shortage has 
actually been achieved? 
Next day, Secretary Udall came to Los 
Angeles. While the California group was 
waiting to meet with him, the question was 
put to the chief engineer of the Colorado 
River board. He estimated the probable ul-
timate shortage at 2.5 million acre-feet. 
That consists of 1.5 million acre-feet an-
nually which the Mexican Treaty assures 
to Mexico, and about 1 million acre-feet of 
annual channel and reservoir losses between 
Lee Ferry?where the lower basin begins?
and the Mexican boundary. You can see that 
unless 2.5 million acre-feet is imported, the 
7.5 million acre-feet annual average?which 
article III(d) of the Colorado River com-
pact requires to be delivered at Lee Ferry?
will provide only 5 million acre-feet of con-
sumptive use. 
Would it be possible to assure protection 
for existing .projects until at least 2.6 mil-
lion acre-feet was imported into the main 
river? 
Stewart 'Udall gave a cautiously affirmative 
reply. This inspired negotiations which re-
sulted in the legislation before you. 
In the first week in February, Senator 
KUCHEL offered S. 1019 in the U.S. Senate. 
Counterparts were offered in the House, and 
Senator HAYDEN has said that he will press 
for prompt passage in the Senate if one of 
these counterparts is passed by the House. 
I shall not try to discuss the details of the 
bill. I shall point out only how it answers 
the hardest questions. 
First, it gives the same protection to ex-
isting projects of all three states, Arizona, 
California, and Nevada, except that Cali-
fornia is limited in that protection to 4,4 
million acre-feet. If there is less than 7.5 
million acre-feet, shortage will be borne by 
the Central Arizona project before existing 
projects are forced to cut back. The 4.4 
limitation on California exists because only 
California's existing projects use more than 
the quantity decreed out of the first 7.5 mil-
lion acre-feet available each year from the 
river. 
You would suppose that this was not a 
matter of consequence to Arizona projects, 
since Arizona's uses plus Central Arizona 
project use will be substantially less than 
Arizona's 2.8 million acre-feet. In fact, the 
problem was of universal concern. As I have 
Said, Arizona's Legislature has twice sought 
protection for Arizona's present projects 
against demands of the Central Arizona proj-
ect. This bill makes that principle applicable 
to both sides of the river, and to all three 
States. 
Second, the bill makes it unnecessary to 
provide an answer to the truly unknown and 
unknowable "ultimate water supply" avail-
able from the Colorado. That requires study 
of hydrology and law. The law is the Colo-
rado River compact which only the Supreme 
Court at the end of another 10 years of 
litigation may definitively construe. We 
must avoid that path. This bill requires an 
answer only to the easy question. How much 
water is probably available to the lower basin 
until imports from other regions become 
available? That question, I am assured, can 
be anewered: Enough to instill, the Central 
Arizona project for immediate authorization 
and construction on these conditions. That, 
I am sure, will be the subject of engineering 
testimony and evidence before you. 
Third, the bill makes it unnecessary to face 
the cruelest dilemma ever imposed by man 
or nature on a great region: Either to go on 
letting temporarily unused upper basin water 
flow down the river, unused, to the Gulf of 
California; or put it to use with projects 
which must be abandoned when the upper 
basin requires that presently weenie(' water 
to which it has a guaranteed right by com-
pact. This bill uses that wasted water for 
its best purpose ?a temporary resource to be 
replaced by imports. 
Fourth, this bill gives every State and 
every region a continuing incentive to make 
the regional plan work. Arizona and Cali-
fornia both need fax more water than they 
can expect from their shares of 7.5 million 
acre-feet. This bill gives both States an 
equal interest in the excess above 7.5 million 
acre-feet which must be provided. It gives 
the maximum assurance now possible that a 
choice between an empty Lake Powell in the 
upper basin or an empty Lake Mead in the 
lower basin need never be made. 
I will conclude by telling you that there 
is still some controversy about the bill in 
California. However, it is a happy kind of 
controversy. Who is entitled to the most 
credit for launching the agreement? 
Like victory of any kind, this plan has--I 
Should say it has needed?many fathers. We 
are still, I think, in the negotiating stages. 
I hope that the members of this committee 
who are not from Lower Colorado River 
Basin States will promptly enter their claims 
to joint paternity. We need your support. 
I would pay tribute to the three men who 
have done more than any others to further 
this concept of regional planning. The first 
is Stewart Udall, Secretary of the Interior, 
who offered two regional plans which con-
tained basic principles of the bills before you. 
The second is Governor Brown. First, in 
launching the California water plan as the 
first major business of his administration, 
he demonstrated to the Nation that regional 
animosities can be reconciled to the benefit 
of mutually hostile antagonists. Second, he 
defended Secretary ITdell's plan when Ari-
zona and California would otherwise have 
killed the concept with renewal of ancient 
hostility. 
The third is Senator KUCHEL. He has 
provided leadership which has put regional 
water problems ahead of party politics, ahead 
of interstate hostilities, and ahead of per-
sonal advantage. His bill is S. 1019 in the 
Senate. The 37 House bills we heard first, in 
this conunitte, because this appears to be the 
best and quickest way to get the job done. 
Mine is a rare privilege. To travel to 
Washington as attorney general of California 
and to urge approval on behalf of the Gov-
ernor of California of a central Arizona proj-
ect, with the assurance that I will be well 
received when I return to California. I think 
you will want to share with me the sense 
of great accomplishment that has come to 
all of us who have helped fashion the pres-
ent agreement.

If the lamp flickers: The fact that a demo-
oatic republic can succeed only to the de-
gree that the electorate is educated was rec-
ognized by the wise and experienced leaders 
who founded our system of government. 
The Government, from the beginning, has 
accepted responsibility for the education of 
the people. True, administration of public 
education is preferable on a local level where 
local needs are better understood, but the 
National Government has always stood 
watchfully in the background, ready with its 
resources to back up and implement local 
efforts. Such gestures as the proclamation 
of National Literacy Week are bound to be 
helpful. This is a way of saying officially 
that the American people are aware of the 
superlative necessity of assuring to every cit-
izen an equal opportunity of achieving the 
best education possible. The consciousness 
of the public to the gravity of this problem 
cannot be too strongly awakened. The lamp 
of learning must not be permitted to flicker. 
If it becomes extinguished, all our hopes and 
splendid dreams and our vision of a better 
life will fall into the abyss of darkness and 
futility. As we love our America, this must 
never happen. 
President Johnson's Position on Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. EARLE CABELL 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 1965 
Mr. CABELL. Mr. Speaker, in light 
of the continuing controversy over Viet-
nam, I insert in the RECORD an article 
that appeared in the Dallas Morning 
News on August 12, which deals with 
President Johnson's position on this 
subject: 
[From the Dallas Morning News, Aug. 12, 
1965] 
PERSONAL REPORT: WASHINGTON 
(By Robert E. Baskin, Chief) 
President Johnson continues to explain 
and discuss his policies in Vietnam. on any 
and all occasions, and there are those in 
Washington who believe he explains too 
much. 
However, in the light of Hanoi's attitude 
about the conflict of southeast Asia, Mr. 
Johnson is well advised to make our inten-
tions as clear as he possibly can. 
Most great wars result from miscalcula-
tions. 
On two occasions Germany misjudged the 
attitude of the American Nation on war in 
Europe. Japan, prior to World War II, also 
believed that the United States did not have 
the stamina to come back from a devastating 
blow to its Pacific possessions. 
In these cases, the miscalculations were in 
large part created by the conduct of dis-
sident American citizens?the pacifists, the 
America Firsters, the militant pro-Nazi ele-
ments, the Communists, and all the others 
who created disturbances against U.S. sup-
port of the democracies of the world. 
In the foreign press the activities of these 
organizations gave a distortion of the true 
sentiment of this Nation. In totalitarian 
lands it is hard to visualize such disturb-
ances as may occur in a democracy, caused 
by tiny minorities, without coming to the 
conclusion that the Nation is badly divided 
on an issue. 
This appears to be the case of the ruling 
circles of Communist North Vietnam today. 
The men of Hanoi have taken note of the 
pacifist marchers at the White House and 
at the Capitol and the utterances of such 
newly emerged foreign policy experts as the 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King and prob-
ably have decided that Mr. Johnson has a 
divided country on his hands. 
This conclusion can only add to the deter-
mination of Ho Chi Minh to intensify this 
campaign against South Vietnam and, more 
important, take the risk of bringing on a 
major thermonuclear war. 
Peiping, too, appears to be suffering under 
the delusion that the United States, as a 
whole, is somewhat reluctant about carrying 
on the war to preserve the independence of 
South Vietnam. The Red Chinese press has 
emphasized, in pictures and stories, the ac-
tivities of the "peace at all costs" demon-
strators in Washington and elsewhere. 
The leaders of the Soviet Union probably 
have a more realistic appraisal of the situa-
tion in the United States, but they evidently 
are having a hard time talking realistically 
these days to Peiping and Hanoi. 
How can the delusion be dispelled? 
This is the problem that confronts Mr. 
Johnson. The administration knows full 
well that the erroneous beliefs in the south-
east Asian Communist capitals must be 
eradicated to prevent miscalculation bring-
ing on another great war. 
Mr. Johnson has repeatedly stated that the 
American Nation is solidly behind our poli-
cies in Vietnam, and there has been every 
reason to believe that this is true. 
But only this week radicals marched on 
the Capitol and created a disturbance that 
got bigger headlines abroad than Mr. John-
son's own statements about American policy 
and determination. 
Mr. Johnson has just concluded a new 
round of briefings for Congress, and these 
briefings were singularly free of dissent. 
Governors, businessmen, and other national 
leaders are being kept well advised of devel-
opments in Vietnam. The President seems 
determined to remove the chances for a 
devastating miscalculation. 
But a small handful of the population 
continues to demonstrate and agitate against 
the Vietnam policy. These demonstrators 
have been treated so mildly in this National 
Capital that one can only wonder what kind 
of special privilege they enjoy. Ordinary 
citizens cannot lie down in White House 
driveways without - fear of punishment. 
Ordinary citizens cannot storm the Capitol 
itself and receive such solicitude as the paci-
fists got this week before the police finally 
did crack down. Ordinary citizens cannot 
block traffic and the sidewalks without pay-
ing the penalty. 
But the demonstrations?by strange mis-
fits from our urban areas and certain uni-
versities?continue to go on. And Peiping 
and Hanoi watch and listen. 
There is a question as to how long our 
national authorities can afford the luxury 
of extending privilege to these off-beat 
people. 
Federal Government and Maryland: 
Partners in Crime and Vice 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. PAUL A. FINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 1965 
Mr. FINO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
would like to tell the Members of this 
House about the combined ignorance of 
the Federal Government and the State of 
Maryland in keeping gambling in Mary-
land illegal and thus wide open for mob 
exploitation. Illegal gambling is a popu-
lar pastime in Maryland?and unfor-
tunately its revenues are not going to the 
public treasury, but rather are going to 
finance a multitude of organized crime's 
enterprises. 
The pari-mutuel turnover in Maryland 
last year came to $212 million. Illegal 
gambling is far more significant in Mary-
land, just as it is nationally. Testimony 
before the McClellan committee in 1961 
put off-track betting at $50 billion a year 
nationally. Other estimates put off-
track betting at about 40 percent of the 
national illegal gambling total. This 
would make illegal gambling of all kinds 
come to about $120 billion a year in the 
United States. This figure, of course, 
represents total turnover?the same $10 
bill can be won and lost many times the 
same night, with no economic effect in 
the end if you break even, except the bit 
clipped off each time by the proprietor. 
On a population basis, Maryland's share 
of this pational illegal gambling total 
comes to $2.16 billion annually. This 
may be a very good estimate. Ten years 
ago, the Massachusetts Crime Commis-
sion, in pegging Massachusetts' gambling 
at about the same figure, said that citi-
zens of that State spend more on gam-
bling than on groceries. Perhaps the 
same is true of Maryland. There is no 
doubt that illegal gambling is big busi-
ness in Maryland's southern counties. 
Inasmuch as the mob gets to keep about 
10 percent of the total turnover as profit, 
Maryland may be a $200 million a year 
tidewater treasure chest for the orga-
nized crime empires. 
The way to take gambling revenues 
away from organized crime and put them 
to work for the people is a national lot-
tery. Only Government-run gambling 
can be trusted to keep the profits of the 
gambling urge in public hands for public 
tasks. The European experience has 
shown how the lottery represents social 
and financial commonsense. America 
needs a national lottery as soon as 
possible. 
Project Head Start

Mr. HANSEN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, 
in its first 3 months of operation, the 
Office of Economic Opportunity an-
nounced 260 projects which have affected 
every State in the Nation. One of these 
programs, Project Head Start, has been 
subjected to even more severe criticism 
than have the other programs. Appar-
ently our ultraconservative friends would 
much rather wait for the deprived chil-
dren involved in this program to grow 
into adulthood. Then the problem could 
be dealt with by expanding our law en-
forcement agencies and penal institu-
tions.

[From the DRS Moines Sunday Register, 
July 25, 1964] 
MAKES REPLY TO LETTER ON HEAD START 
To the EDITOR: 
Iowans have a great newspaper in the 
Register. Your reporting and prettentatlon 
are outstanding for fairness. As a supporter 
of President Johnson's programs under OUr 
Economic Opportunity Act of 1954, as ooe 
vitally insistent on creating respect for VAG 
evolutionary piece of legislation, I thank you 
for Open Forum's July 18 letter from Dr. 
Robinson critical of the preschool Project 
Head Start and, for the short enthusiattic 
letter printed immediately juicier it sent by 
the lady from Thornton who is actually 
working in the project. 
I wish only one word could have been 
difaarent in that lady's testimonial letter. 
She called It "the -Government's Project 
Head Start" instead of "our Government's 
Project Head Start." The success or failure 
of these programs is 'to be Ours in our own 
local communities independent of, though 
cooperating with, oonstiltants and experts in 
Washington and Des Moines. 
Dr. Robinson 'failed to note that sobool 
board members alone cannot accept or re-
ject the sprograms. 'Responsibility for be-
ginning this program will rest with officially 
designated community action agencies. 
Local citizens from many segments of a com-
munity must plan together with their owii 
experts how mu% or how little of the Fed-
eral financial or technical aid their ecassixtu-
nity wants. 
There will be little chance for power-
grabbing consultants in the education or 
any 'other professional 'field tu take advan-
tage' of the Federal grants. 
The cynical approach to the new Federal 
framework for breaking poverty cycles is one 
that foot-draggers and self-appointed ex-
perts often use. They dread change becatto 
new ideas and new people brought into the 
situation challenge their status as knoss At-
oll experts. 
Iowans ask facts from their newspapers 
and their leaders. They will then beprepared 
for change and will adapt it intelligently to 
their special needs.

(An analysis by L. W. tern, president, the 
Maryland Highweys Doritrattors Associa-
tion, 'Inc.) 
On :lily 28 another step was taken in the 
plan, which step by step, _can be seen unfold-
ing. The House of Representatives Of the 
Congress of the United States took its 'final 
action in one of the presently proposed two 
changes in labor legislation?it voted 221 
to 203 to repeal section 14(b) of the Taft-
Hartley Act. 
That-act of retrogression seems to indicate 
that Many people, including some Congress-
merit who voted for repeal, must have failed 
'to realize certain significant fans. 
It also warrants this supplement to our 
July 20 analysis: "A Stepping-Stone?To-
ward What?" 
In weighing the pros and cons of the leg-
*elation which labor unione are demanding, 
It must be kept In mind that the labor 
unions of today are huge, powerful and 
especially-privileged prirate business enter-
prises, engaged in the profitable business of 
organizing the unorganized. The tnaor-
ganized are the some 58 million workers 
(more than two-thirds of the Nation's work-
force) Who have not chosen, or as yet have 
not been forced, to become no organized. 
The Cult ent Major Demands of Labor Unions 
1. Labor unions are demsorling the repeal 
of section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley law. 
;,n otlaer wOrds, thole ,private ansin.eas en-
terprises are -demanding (a) the riullillca-
tion of certain legislation (right-to-work 
laws) which presently exists In more than 
a third of the States, (b) the taking away 
from all of the States the right to enact .such 
.and (a) the further expansion 
of their present exclusive privilege to ,prac-
tice discrimination In the Area of employ-
ment. 
2. Labor unions also am demanding the 
enactment of legislation (a so-called "situs 
picketing" bill) which would give them the 
privilege to strike, picket and cause work-
istop-pages at any construction site for the 
sole purpose of driving their competition 
(both nonunion and/or other unions) off 
the job without being in violation, as at 
present, of the secondary boycott. In other 
words, these private business enterprises are 
denaaositng the legalization of the privilege 
of using force (the awesome power of the 
picket-line with its obvious potential of 
sensing emotional outlaursts and violence) 
as a legitimate method of eliminating their 
competition and billicting compulsory union-
ism upon the construction industry and its 
millions of eMployees. 
PART E?RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS 
Bight-to-work laws do not 'restrict any priv-
ilege which Federal taw gives to workers 
I. Any worker today OEM join any labor 
moon of his choice, which will accept him, 
without placing his employment in jeopardy. 
2. A bare majority of the voting workers 
in on appropriate segment of their employer's 
personnel can vote into existence a collec-
tive bargaining unit, and elect the labor 
union of their choice as the exclusive repre-
sentative of, and collective bargaining agent 
for, all the workers in said unit. 
3. 'Workers can strike against and picket 
their employer for a wide variety of reasons. 
Right-to-work laws do not restrict labor 
onions in their federally granted privilege 
to solicit recognition and represent workers 
1. Labor unions can solicit either em-
ployers and eiliployees to obtain their recog-
nition of the labor union as the bargaining 
agent for the workers in question. 
2. Labor unions so recognized henceforth 
are the exclusive representative of, and col-
lective bargaining agent for, all of the em-
ployees in the designated collective bargain-
lug unit including (a) those employees who 
may have voted against such representation 
and (b) those employees who may not have 
had opportunity to vote, as would be the 
case when an employer, of his own volition 
or because of economic pressure, creates the 
oolleetive bargaining unit. (Note: The priv-
ilege to speak for all vote insisted upon by 
the labor unions, and contributes greatly to 
the 'prestige and political power Wielded by 
these private business enterprises.) 
It is only in the two areas of "discrimination 
in employment" and "financial gain" that 
right-to-work laws limit the power of labor 
unions 
1. The Federal Groverntnenta lows and the 
esliote of its agencies permit these private 
business enterprises to require (in the ab-
eam* of a State law to the contrary) the 
union shop in which employment is condi-
tional upon membership in, alutiorr the pay-
ment of money to, the labor union. 
2. To the contrary, right-to-work laws pro-
hibit employment being made conditional 
upon membership or nonmembership in, 
and/or upon the payment or nonpayment. 
of money to, a labor union, 
PART 12---TIrE PROPOSED "SITOS PICERTENG" LEG-
ISLATION (LECKIE:ED SECONDARY 130140o-re's) 
1. As noted in our basic analysis of July 
20, labor unions have the right to picket any 
construction site for any purpose other than 
the outlawed secondary boycott and do so. 
'thereCore, it is obvious that these private 
business enterprises are attempting to have 
the Congress, in effect, legalize this crippling 
action in the construction industry, 
2. It may well be that the AFL-CIO has 
grown weary of attempting to organize the 
unorganized of the construction Industry by 
the legitimate and .highly favorable means 
now available to all labor unions, or, that 
they are finding it increasingly difficult to 
sell their services to workers in these days 
of Davis-Bacon and other Federal wage con-
trols. In any event, it Is reasonable to as-
sume, twos the reliably repealed statements 
of several of its high officials, that this labor 
union a private business enterprise, intends 
to use the proposed legislation in an attempt 
(a) to eliminate its competition, both union 
and nonunion, (b) to enforce compulsory 
unionism, and, (c) to attain a monopoly 
of the construction industry. 
3. District 50 (United Mine Workers of 
America) realizing that the proposed legis-
lation would be detrimental to its individual 
interest, has opposed said legislation, how-
ever, district 50 frankly stated that it will 
withdraw its opposition if said legislation is 
amended to such an extern as to let it con-
tinge to be an illegal act to picket for the 
sole purpose of driving ita affiliates off a job. 
4. Secretary of Labor Wirtz was ill advised 
in saying that in the construction industry 
no one is an innocent bystander and Vint 
contractors know "whether union and non-
union men are going to be drawn together 
and whether trouble will be the product of 
this mixed naarriege." The very nature of 
construction work is conducive of such mixed 
marriages. Construction of public works 
projects is performed under contract provi-
sions which prohibit any discrimination in 
the prequalification of bidders, and require 
bthidadterard be made to the lowest qualified 
5. This proposed legislation undoubtedly 
will result in Widespread, cleverly timed, and 
crippling strikes, picketing and work stop-
pages. Many imperative school, hospital, 
housing, highway, arid other defense installa-
tion projects will be affected. Federal, State, 
county, and municipal 'construction time-
tables, budget provisions and tax structures 
will be upset. 
8. No construction, whether union or non-
union, would be immune. But few contrac-
tors could financially survive the prolonged 
periods of enforced inactivity while labor

Blunting 'Viet tong's Goals 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN R. HANSEN 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 1965 
Mr. HANSEN of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, 
as the ancient and familiar proverb goes: 
"Where there's life, there's hope." 
Well, there is life?and vigor, and de-
termination, and earnestness in this Na-
tion's commitment to the struggle in 
South Vietnam. And today, it seems, 
there is hope. 
The situation in that war-torn land is 
still grave and tragic. There is great loss 
of life, serious inStability yet in the po-
litical structure of South Vietnam?and 
the continuing aggression of the Viet-
cong, supported by Communist strate-
gists in Hanoi, remains a serious obstacle 
to peace there. 
But, as the monsoon season draws to 
a close, American policymakers are find-
ing encouragement in the fact that the 
expected Vietcong offensive was not as 
successful as it might have been. Our 
Marines have scored a great victory re-
cently, and there is even some optimism 
that a hoped-for resolution in the con-
flict may be somewhat nearer. 
This is slim encouragement for op-
timism but encouragement there can be 
hope, however fleeting, in the events of 
recent days. 
I am happy to offer for inclusion in 
the RECORD an excellent editorial from 
the August 24 editions of the Mason City, 
Iowa, Globe Gazette. This editorial, en-
titled "Blunting Vietcong's Goals," brief-
ly but competently sets forth some ex-
cellent thoughts on this matter: 
BLUNTING VIETCONG'S GOALS 
Vietnam still does not reflect a rosy pic-
ture. But perhaps there are faint, flickering 
signs of hope. 
They're not much. But they are sufficient 
to permit a bit of optimism that the Com-
munist-backed Vietcong will not achieve the 
victory they have striven for so hard during 
the rainy season?when the weather favors 
their kind of hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. 
The fact is that the monsoon season is 
drawing to a close?only a few more weeks 
of drumming rain and overcast skies to go. 
The further fact is that while the Vietcong 
have hit South Vietnam hard, they have not 
knocked out the shaky. government. 
Another morale booster was the signifi-
cant victory won by U.S. marines in what 
was the biggest single engagement of the 
conflict. Replacement of such high losses by 
infiltration will be slow and costly. 
?Nobody close to the scene believes that 
anything which has transpired to date will 
discourage the Communists from terminat-
ing the hostilities at this time. 
But it does mean that the basic strategy 
of keeping the South Vietnam Government 
as a political entity, while applying military 
pressure to show the Reds they cannot 
achieve victory on the battlefield, does ap-
pear to be working. 
President Johnson's goal, of course, is to 
persuade the Communists that they must 
forego this battlefield and seek a solution at 
the conference table, But there still is no 
assurance this will be achieved after this 
rainy season?or even the next. 
The United States will be in South Viet-
nam, expending lives and military assistance, 
for n long time to come. The successes and 
trends are still dwarfed by the massive set-
backs during the last 2 years. 
Heraldry in America 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. CLARK W. THOMPSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 1965 
Mr. THOMPSON of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, in a previous issue of the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD I inserted a most en-
lightening and interesting article by Mr. 
Fessel B. Koepnick on the subject of 
Heraldry. I am pleased to place in the 
RECORD another article by the same 
author: 
HERALDRY IN AMERICA 
(By Fessel B. Koepnick, Esq., Augustan 
Society, Heraldry Society) 
Events of recent years, coupled with past 
A,merioan history, indicate a sooner or later 
surge in the interest of heraldry in America. 
Indeed, this interest has already material-
ized. As regards past American history let 
us admit that many if not the majority of 
the first leaders of our Republic were indeed 
armigerous, and many were directly de-
scended from nobility, from President Wash-
ington onward, and including at least several 
of the group who landed at Plymouth Rock. 
And these many armigerous families have 
been regularly augmented through contin-
uing immigration. In fact the backbone of 
leadership of our Republic is armigerous. 
Nonarmigerous persons know this, even 
though they also resent it. Nevertheless, 
these same persons themselves aspire to coat 
armor, and prove it by their enthusiastic 
though ignorant effort to acquire spurious 
or illegal so-called family name coats of 
arms. Thus, the net result of our now 
affluent society. 
Sooner or later the matter is going to de-
mand some kind of regulation and con-
formity. Our (successful) trademark, 
patents, and copyrights system prove this 
sufficiently. It also proves that the matter 
can be successfully regulated, although in a 
democracy without a fans honorum (foun-
tain of honor) there is the ever-present dan-
ger of politics. Even in England, where the 
fountain of honor lies with the Sovereign, the 
"new society" has created a situation which 
comes dangerously close to politics. The 
College of Arms is firm and rigid in the reg-
ulation and control of heraldry by authority 
of the Sovereign, and has been for hundreds 
of years. Today the "commoner" who is not 
armigerous and who attempts to secure a 
grant of arms must conform to specific re-
quirements including that of character. 
When the applicant is unable or unwilling to 
do so he immediately screams foul and if he 
has any influence with certain nonarmiger-
ous politicians, one can imagine the turmoil. 
Such is the ever-present danger. But, like 
any other worthy effort, this must be con-
tended with successfully. 
A4905 
The events of recent years actually go back 
to the early 1920's the period after World War 
I, when the Government created the Insti-
tute of Heraldry as a department within the 
U.S. Army. One would get the impression 
that this agency is purely military and is 
purely Army. The facts are not entirely 
such. The Institute of Heraldry is respon-
sible for designing, matriculating, issuing, 
recording and authorizing blazons for any 
and all Government agencies, bureaus and 
departments, including the Army and the Air 
Force and even the Navy. Consequently, 
persons interested in heraldry in America 
should not take this agency lightly. While 
they have made many mistakes through the 
years they, have not been serious, and are 
attributable entirely to the limited experience 
of early personnel. 
Actually, the father of American (military) 
heraldry was Col. Robert E. Wyllie, a coast 
artillery officer who contributed several 
articles around 1923. From that period, there 
has been possibly some 10,000 distinctive in-
signia made and used by various Army units. 
Admittedly, of this number many were er-
rors. Errors in design, manufacture, tinc-
tures and shape. As time passed, many units 
disbanded, reconstituted, reassigned, redesig-
nated, and many even retired. And the In-
stitute of Heraldy is busier today than ever 
before because the American Army is in a 
very fluid state of continuing change and 
reorganization. Mounted (horse) cavalry 
has become armored units; infantry has be-
come airborne; armored; rangers; special 
forces (guerrilla); coast artillery went to 
antiaircraft and now to missiles, and many, 
many other such changes. Many units be-
came "cadres" for the creation of entirely 
new units: 
As a result, the new unit inherited the 
blazon of its parent and in some instances 
the English system of cadency, was used, in 
others the Scottish cadency was used. Cant-
ing is used to admirable success. Symbols 
meaningfully used and in regulatory order. 
Tinctures concur with the colors of the 
branch of arm and/or service, and in canting 
as well. The institute encourages the fan-
tastic variation of shapes of the shields which 
attempt to make each insignia exactly that 
which it is called, that is, distinctive. 
All of which indicates the ability of the 
Institute of Heraldry, and the necessity of all 
heraldic minded persons and organizations to 
seek some means of liaison with the agency. 
If any effort of our own is to be successful 
in our endeavor, then we must go along with 
these people. At the moment they are not 
Inclined toward specific relations with or-
ganizations or individuals outside of govern-
ment. Our success in establishing contact, 
relations, and communications with this 
group of personnel will probably have to be 
a result of our ability to do so through our 
elected Congress and Senate. The time is at 
hand to begin such an effort. The effort may 
succeed mores? if we can locate and engender 
interest with armigerous Congressmen. But 
perhaps like a late President who was indeed 
of an armigerous family, his greatest effort 
and personal success was the result of his 
urgent denial of his noble heritage, many 
politicians will never admit that they are 
other than descendants of immigrant serfs. 
Most Americans still glory in claiming birth 
in an imaginative log cabin. 
Most Americans are not armigerous. Yet if 
an applicant, if of good character, he should 
be able to engage the services of a competent 
herald who will honestly design the appro-
priate blazon for him. It should be regis-
tered under his State trademark or patent 
laws. If some national system can be created, 
the registry should lie within such central 
agency. The net effect of this effort would 
be the elimination of the present houses who 
peddle spurious and illegal coat armor to gul-
lible individuals may of whom honestly are 
seeking an individual blazon.

The Lynch Trial of Marcos Perez 
Jimenez 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JAMES B. UTT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN Ira, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31,, 1965 
Mr. UTI'. Mr. Speaker, under unani-
mous consent to insert my remarks in 
the Appendix of the RECORD, I wish to 
include an article by Ilarold Lord Var-
ney, who is president and founder of 
the Committee on. Pan American Policy. 
As such, he has been in the forefront 
of the fight to induce Washington to 
wage an all-out battle against cominu-
Warn in Latin America. Formerly the 
Political editor of American Mercury, he 
was also adviser to the Republic of China 
between 1947 and 1948. 
At the time Perez Jimenez was ache'', 
uled for deportation, I lodged a vigorous 
protest with the Department of State 
against this atrocious procedure. De-
portation had been authorized by the 
U.S. Supreme Court, but the final power 
lay in the hands of the Secretary of 
State. 
This was the first time in the history 
of this country that deportation was per-
mitted involving a political exile who 
had been a former head of state of the 
country to which he was being returned. 
Perez Jimenez was, sold into bondage 
in exchange for a mess of pottage which 
quickly soured. This inhuman act by 
the Kennedy administration will forever 
be a black mark against the self-pro-
claimed high ideals of that administra-
tion. 
The article follows: 
VENEZUELA: THE LYNCH TRIAL OF Malacca 
PEREZ JIMENEZ 
left the plane at Mainuetia. After 0 
years, I was beak in Venezuela. 
Naturally, I was greatly curious to see 
the changes which had taken place in that 
fabulously rich country. My last sight of 
Venezuela had been in the closing months of 
the Presidency of Marcos Perez Jimenez, just 
before the Leftist revolution which brought 
Romulo Betancourt back to power. I had 
carried away a vivid impression of a country 
bursting with progress under the driving 
leadership of the man who has been reeog-
nized, even by his adversaries, as one of the 
great Latin American builders of modern 
times. What, I thought, had the Detail-
court-Leoni regime done to top Perez Jime-
nez? How had the government's annual flow 
of $700 million in oil royalties been spent to 
improve Venezuela? 
My interest had been whetted by the Ilene:, 
just before I left Neve York, that the Ueda 
regime had petitioned the United States for 
permission to sell $15 million worth of Vene-
zuelan bonds on the American market. Was 
it possible that the Betancourt-Leoni Action 
Democratica Party was conducting such a 
massive public improvement program that 
it had overextended itself? 
My cab swept me over the magnificient 
Autopista toward the capital. That beau ti-
fully engineered highway, literally carved 
through the mountains, was planned (met 
built by Perez Jimenez. / asked the driver 
to continue along San Martin. Boulevard 
where the 30-story twin towers of the 
Centro Bolivar command the Caracas lamd-
scape? another of Perez Jimenez' projects, 
cut through the hovels and slums that for-
merly Jelled the heart of the Venezuelan capi-
tal. In the distance was the imposing Cen-
tral University, surrounded by its beautiful 
university city?now a forbidding nest of 
Communist student terrorism. The univer-
sity complex, once a great center of learning, 
had also been conceived and built by Presi-
dent Perez. In the far distance were the 
ferty 15-story apartment houses constructed 
by Perez Jimenez to provide inexpensive 
housing for the people of Caracas. 
We swung onto the stately Eastern High-
way, an eight-lane elevated boulevard which 
led to my hotel; that highway too was a mon-
ument to the constructive determination of 
Marcos Perez Jimenez. I reached the Tam-
anaco, one of the great hotels of South Amer-
ica, to be told that it had also been planned 
and built by the government of President 
Perez. 
It was saddening to realize that the archi-
tect of all of these public works was now 
lying in a Caracas prison, on trial before his 
political enemies and thus forced to face 
the Initial barrage of political accusatioris. 
A good rule to follow when seeking infor-
mation in a Latin American city is to ask 
the taxi driver. 
"Where are some of the buildings which 
have been put up by Betancourt and Leoni? 
I asked innocently. 
The driver treated me to one of those 
Characteristic Latin shrugs, "Nada," he an-
swered, "nothing. Too many hands." 
Obviously, the "hands" he had in mind 
were those which deliver the democratic 
vote to the BetaneOurt-Leoni twosome. 
Later, when I was told the facts about the 
great armies of leftist, Communist, and dead-
beat henchmen who have been glued into 
fictitious government jobs, I began to more 
fully tinderetand Where the annual $700 mil-
lion in oil royalties bad gone. I learned that 
since the exit of President Perez the public 
payroll had snowballed from 900 million bon-
vars per year to a present total of 3 billion 
bolivars. A lot of democratic votes can be 
kept in line with that kind of money. 
Of course, the Action Democratica, when it 
talks to Americans, has an alibi: Betancourt 
hasn't built public works in Caracas because 
he is spending money he rural Venezuela 
on agrarian reform. I recalled President Ken-
nedy's visit to the model agrarian communi-
ny of La Merits in 1961, when he shouted 
glowingly that Venezuela under Betancourt, 
with its agrarian reform, was giving an ex-
ample for all Latin America to follow. I asked 
one of my friends to drive me out to La Merits 
an that I could check the progress. 
"La Merits," my friend bellylaugheel, 
"there is no La Merits. It was closed after 
Kennedy left, when everybody moved away." 
The whole agrarian exhibit, it seemed, had 
been only a plant to fool a checkwriting 
and impressionable young President into be-
lieving that a great agrarian program was 
undereaty. 
All of this was not, of course, surprising; 
for anti-Communist President Perez 
Jimenez's successors?Romulo Betancourt, 
and his long-time secretary, Raul Leoni?
are not the sort of men who see anything 
wrong in employing graft and fraud if some-
thing is to be had in the process for their 
comrades of the left. Remember that 
Betancourt, despite his honorary degree from 
Harvard, his coming lecture series at UCLA, 
end his strange favor with American liberals. 
was one of the founders of the Venezuelan 
Communist Party; that he was exiled for his 
Communist Party activity in 1928, where-
upon he went to Costa Rica to co-found the 
Geste. Rican Communist Party with Manuel 
Mora Valverde (his brother-in-law). Re-
member, too, that it was Betancourt who 
provided the credentials that got Communist 
Fidel Castro into and out of Bogota in. 1948, 
when Castro was one of the leaders of the 
famous Communist butchery of Bogote,. 
And we remember ieetancourt's statement, 
from the notorious :Barranquilla letters 
authenticated by the U.S. military attach?t 
Caracas: "With vaseline we may be able to 
insert into the people all of Marx and all of 
Lenin." 
Remember, too, his published letters of the 
late thirties, when he wrote for publication 
in La Hera of Costa Rica: "It doesn't mean 
that I deny my Communist affiliation. I am 
and I will be a Communist." Or the Betan-
court letter of September 25, 1934, which he 
published in a San Jose newspaper, in which 
he said: "I am and always have been a Com-
munist." Or his letter of February 15, 1937, 
published in a Caracas newspaper: "It is very 
urgent to determine that the necessary 
revolution for transforming Venezuela only 
can succeed if it is conducted, led, and cen-
tralized by the Venezuelan Communist 
Party," 
Today, few will doubt, Romulo Betancourt 
is being more clever about his leftist activity. 
It is as he wrote to his accomplice Raul Leoni 
in one of the captured :Barranquilla letters: 
"In case there is any misunderstanding, let 
me point out to you here, publicly and openly 
that I have been called a Communist. But 
1 VI irar we slieuld act in a little more foxy 
way at this time to win what we need." 
And, what Betancourt and Leoni need they 
try to get?through fraud, deceit, terror, or 
anything else handy at the moment. They 
now need to rid themselves of the threat of 
anti-Communist Marcos Perez Jimenez, But 
we will have a great deal more to say of that 
later in this article. 
Throughout my visit to Venezuela, the im-
pression grew that I was in a country in 
decadence. Venezuela touched greatness for 
a brief moment in the 1950's, before the men 
of the left had moved in. Now it is no 
longer advancing. It is living upon the fruits 
of its past, while the Accion Democratica 
plunderblund frantically clutches power and 
all its emoluments. The mainstream of the 
nation's economy is stagnant. 
Of course, no such picture of Venezuela 
has penetrated the United States. Popular 
articles in the American press, as well as the 
fervid speeches of HUBERT HUMPHREY, are for-
ever full of snide references to Betancourt's 
having cleaned up the mess left by Perez 
Jimenez, To read the highly colored stories 
of democratic progress in Venezuela under 
Romulo Betancourt, one gets the concept of 
a nation humming with achievement and 
purpose. Unhappily, there is no such Vene-
zuela. Like La Merite., such descriptive prose 
Is a Potemkin exhibit, thrown up by the Ac-
cion Dernocratica and its gullible and leftist 
American friends, to convince the United 
States that Venezuela, under the left, has 
made more progress than under the right. 
The Venezuelan people are not impressed by 
such hogwash. They knew the bitter truth. 
Even in stately Caracas, the scars of the 
Accion Democratica years are plainly visible. 
I was driven out to see the shanty towns 
which ring the city and which shelter the 
unfortunates who are not sharing in the 
Accion Democratica perquisites. tinder Perez 
Jimenez, an energetic housing program was 
rapidly eliminating this nightmare. In 
Perez's last year, after great effort, he had 
been able to reduce the hovels to five thou-
sand dwellings. Now, after 6 years of Betan-
court and Leona they have increased to 
100,000?with more appearing daily. 
Throughout Venezuela a strangling unem-
ployment stalks the country. There bad 
been virtually no unemployment in 1957 
when I was there before, yet the latest figures

creepers rear from the flower beds, making a 
cool interlocking ceiling against the fierce 
sun. Pagodas, scattered throughout the 
grounds, give restful spots for leisure and 
conversation. 
Reclining in a hammock in one of these pa-
godas, Naranjo talked to me about the case. 
He has no doubt that he will win it, despite 
the stacked deck which confronts him in the 
supreme court. He bases his defense upon 
the obvious illegality of a political trial for 
an extradited former president, under the 
terms of the Venezuela-United States Extra-
dition Treaty. Moveover, he cites the fact 
that the Venezuelan constitution of 1953 
(operative during Perez Jimenez's presi-
dency) specifically prohibits persecution for 
crimes committed by a president in the prac-
tice of his public functions. Unless the 
court is ready to hand down a kangaroo de-
cision,, Naranjo is confident that the law of 
Venezeula stops Lazada at every point. 
Of course, there can be no illusion that 
this is other than a political trial. Had 
Perez Jimenez been willing to come to terms 
with the ruling leftists, as Pietri and Lopez 
Contreras have done, he would be a free man 
today. The left always has an open gate for 
apostates. But in the tough Andean nature 
of Perez Jimenez there is no touch of the 
apostate. He will fight on, at all costs, be-
cause he believes that he is right. He also 
believes fixedly that anti-communism, and 
not the Betancourt brand of crypto-commu-
nism, is the wave of Venezuela's future. 
Of course, the outcome hangs heavily upon 
public opinion, both in Venezuela and in 
the United States. The Leoni government 
wants desperately to liquidate Perez Jimenez; 
but It does not dare risk a judicial crime in 
the revealing glare of publicity now beating 
upon the case. In Venezuela, the balance 
of public sympathy has already swung heav-
ily against the Accion Democratica course. 
Accion Democratica is straining upon the 
limits of the possible. 
Meanwhile, in the United States, the pro-
Betancourt bias of most of our press has re-
frained from giving the American people any 
clear knowledge of what is taking place in 
the Caracas courtroom, and of its likely his-
toric consequences. Our leftists have done 
a thorough propaganda job about Venezuela 
under the Accion Democratica. So all-out 
is the press buildup of Romulo Betancourt 
that even some active American conserva-
tives hesitate to stand up and be counted 
on the Betancourt issue. They rationalize 
their position by saying: "Betancourt has 
fought the Communists"?disregarding the 
open fact that he has fought only his propa-
ganda rival, Fidel Castro, while advancing his 
own brand of "communism under another 
name" with impunity. The liberals have 
profited richly from this induced confusion 
on the part of the right. With the late John 
F. Kennedy, they have made Betancourt's 
name so holy that no writer who wants to 
make a living dares to attack him. And 
yet, Betancourt and his Accion Democratica 
must be X-rayed and exposed to the Ameri-
can people if there is ever to be reason in our 
Latin American policy. 
While I was in Venezuela, I was horrified 
to read that at that very moment Betancourt 
was being honored in New York by an or-
ganization whose leaders bristle with those 
cited by the Committee on Un-American 
Activities for association with subversive ef-
forts, and that the President of the United 
States, himself, had sent a letter to the din-
ner eulogizing Betancourt. It was poetic 
justice that, after the President had made 
such a gesture, Betancourt insolently tossed 
off a speech savagely attacking the John-
son intervention in the Dominican Republic. 
It is such an incident as this, blackly head-
lined in the pro-Betancourt press in Caracas; 
that gives the fading Accion Democratica a 
continued lease of prestige in Venezuela. 
Today, Accion Democratica's greatest asset 
is the impression that Washington is be-
hind it. The Johnson administration's con-
tinuing policy of support for Betancourt 
needs to be stopped. It is alienating non-
leftist Venezuelans. It is intervention in its 
most unprofitable form in the politics of a 
sensitive country. 
Perez Jimenez, the hounded prisoner in 
the Caracas courtroom, is undoubtedly the 
political key to Venezuela's future. In the 
last 3 years he has looked into the very 
mouth of hell, and he has not flinched. He 
looms today as the one possible leader who 
can spark a hemispheric swing to the anti-
Communist right. He has been smeared 
unmercifully, and he is still being smeared. 
His enemies dismiss him as a playboy, de-
spite his unrivaled achievements. True, he 
has none of the dour and unsmiling solem-
nity with which a Betancourt has impressed 
an anemic American intelligentsia. Perez 
Jimenez is a lover of life, who lives by the 
code of his lusty Andean heritage, and mil-
lions of Latin Americans love him for it?
f-or that and for his anticommunism. 
In his present exposed situation, it is the 
duty of every anti-Communist American to 
try to save him. His own Venezuelan people 
are trying courageously to pull him out of 
the leftist jaws. With Naranjo's eloquent 
voice on their side, they may succeed in 
doing it on their own. But it would' be a 
melancholy spectacle, at this juncture, if 
American anti-Communists failed to come 
to the support of one who is so conspicuously 
fighting the anti-Communist battle in 
Venezuela. 
Thanks to a thoroughly dishonest press 
coverage, many misinformed American con-
servatives are today unknowingly cheering 
for the Venezuelan left. The press blackout 
Is pervasive. Unless it is answered and de-
feated, it will help to kill the spirit of anti-
communism in Venezuela. The long-range 
American anti-Communist purpose has suf-
fered so many withering defeats in late years 
that it cannot afford another disaster. It 
would be a shameful epitaph upon today's 
America to be remembered as the nation 
which rescued a Romulo Betancourt when 
his own people were rely to spew him out. 
Vietnam and the Long View 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. FRANK ANNUNZIO 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 31, 1965 
Mr. ANNUNZIO. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to call to the attention of my colleagues 
an article written by Emmett Dedmon, 
executive editor of the Chicago Sun-
Times, after a recent extensive tour he 
made of southeast Asia. I feel this arti-
cle merits the particular attention of the 
Members of Congress because it presents 
a whole new outlook and a refreshing 
long-range view of the chances for 
achieving our goal of peace, not only in 
Vietnam, but in all of Asia. 
Mr. Dedmon has returned from his 
tour with the conviction that Vietnam 
represents a defensible position for the 
United States but that "we should not 
delude ourselves that it constitutes a pol-
icy for Asia." He paints out that East 
and West have different histories, dif-
ferent cultures, and in some cases differ-
ent values, making it difficult to achieve 
a meeting of the minds as quickly as we 
in the West hope to achieve it. The 
eastern view appears to be that it will 
take at least "10 years or so" before a 
significant thaw in relations between the 
United States and Red China can be 
expected. 
It is encouraging to learn from Ded-
mon's report that the predominant feel-
ing in southeast Asia is that the U.S. 
presence in Vietnam is not generally re-
garded as a colonial or oppressive 
enterprise. 
Mr. Dedmon tells us that the southeast 
Asian countries feel the U.S. program 
would be more effective if it were identi-
fied with long-range social reforms. It 
is to this end that consideration is being 
given by the United States to establish-
ing an Asiatic Bank and Edward Lans-
dale has been assigned to Vietnam to 
help develop a Government structure 
capable of bringing about this social 
reform. 
The article by Mr. Dedmon, which ap-
peared in the Sun-Times on August 29, 
1965, follows: 
On a wall at Angkor Wat, the great temple 
in Cambodia constructed from the 9th to the 
12th century, there is a mural showing 
Khmer (Cambodian) soldiers fighting off an 
invading band of Chams, one of the tribes 
who eventually came to be known as the 
Vietnamese. 
"Yes," said our Cambodian guide with no 
trace of rancor, "the Vietnamese people have 
always caused difficulties in Asia far out of 
proportion to their numbers." 
Thus it was on a green plateau in Cam-
bodia, far removed from any evidence of con-
temporary civilization, that I found what was 
to be the most relevant commentary during 
a summer's pilgrimage to southeast Asia in 
search of answers about Vietnam. 
Purposefully, I had avoided Vietnam ex-
cept for two brief interludes between air-
planes in Saigon. For I was not interested in 
the war, which is in Vietnam, but in the prize 
of peace, which is all of Asia. 
As I left the United States early in July, 
the debate over our policy in Vietnam was 
raging lbuder and louder; and, it seemed, to 
me, at a frenetic pitch hardly conducive to 
sensible mediation about long-range goals of 
foreign policy. 
It was a relief, then, to find that the din 
of the dispute decreased in almost direct pro-
portion to our approach to Vietnam. 
Asia has a long history in which war has 
never been as neatly codified as we in the 
West have done in order to bring orderliness 
to the teaching of history. As you stand in 
Asia, you begin to understand that it would 
never occur to the leaders of these ancient 
peoples that any solution would be sought as 
quickly as was being demanded in the United 
States or Western Europe. 
Asia is a land of ancient quarrels. Cam-
bodia, for example, which recently broke off 
relations with the United States has even 
greater animosity toward its neighbor nation 
of Thailand. And Cambodia's dispute with 
Vietnam is grounded more substantially in 
disagreement over borders resulting from the 
historic surge of armies than in ideological 
differences with the South Vietnam Govern-
ment. 
All these nations recognize both tacitly and 
explicitly the American presence in Vietnam 
as a buffer against territorial encroachment 
by China. And they fear China the nation 
much more than China the harbinger of in-
ternational communism. 
Many of these peoples trace their ancestry 
to early incursions of armies from China. It 
is clear that they regard those periods when 
Western powers served as a buffer to the giant 
from the north to be centuries as near to 
tranquility as any they have known. 
From their point of view, then, the stale-
mate in South Vietnam is much to be pre-

euelan workers are reaching Working age 
every year, to swell the problem. The Accion 
Democratica has no sobs for them. 
These grim but inescapable facts have now 
worn off the phony luster of the Betancourt 
regime. The Venezuelan public is fed up 
with the Accion Democratica and its moist 
and empty promises. At the last election, 
Raul Leoni barely squeaked through, with 
but 32 percent of the vote. He rules today 
c.nly through a coalition of unstable splinter 
parties, known as the Amplia Base. Betan-
court discreetly stays in New York, where he 
is lapping up the sort of lionization from 
American liberals and leftists that he no 
tenger receives in Venezuela. He is also con-
sulted by President Johnson. 
Surely, even the merest to can detect in 
today's Venezuela the unmistakable signs of 
the profound political crisis ahead. If it 
comes, it will be the first important instance 
of a nation, which has been taken over totally 
by the Left, returning by popular choice to 
the anti-Communist right. 
II 
The above supplies a revealing backdrop 
to the insane performance which is now 
being staged before the Supreme Court of 
Venezuela?the attempt to railroad Marcos 
Perez Jiminez to a prison term on a manu-
factured charge of corruption. Such an 
attempt to immobilize and discredit Perez 
Jimenez, and to thus remove him from 
politics, is the last desperate gamble of 
Betancourt and his weak understudies (Raul 
Leone Jovito Villalbas and Rafael Caldera) 
to stave off Venezuela's swing to the right. 
Perez Jimenez is the only Venezuelan anti-
Communist of stature who is capable of 
leading a successful movement against the 
leftist Incompetents. The word is out that 
he must be destroyed, and now. 
The former President would not be in a 
prison cell today if it were not for the in-
terference of the United States. An exile 
in Miami, Perez Jimenez was caught in the 
swirl of the ill-advised intrigues between 
President Kennedy and Rornulo Betancourt 
in 1961-63. Res nearly certain that Presi-
dent Kennedy on the occasion of 13etan-
court's visit to the White House during 
loebruary of 1963, promised to deliver Perez 
eimenez to Betancourt on condition that 
Betancourt aid the United States against 
f'lastro. Since Betancourt was Castro's for-
mer teacher and sponsor, this Was a clever 
dodge. The promise was purportedly given 
even before the courts had acted, and in 
shameless disregard of the hitherto 
irn-
breathed American tradition of political asy-
lum. Por 2 years, after the extradition, the 
former President lay in a Caracas prison. 
His trial opened on April 9. 
It is important to understand that in the 
eyes of the Venezuelan public the corruption 
charge has placed upon Perez Jirnenez little 
or no moral stigma. Latin Americans are 
used to the mutual bandying of accusations 
of corruption when governments fall. In 
the case of Betancourt and the Accion Demo-
eratica, the cry of corruption is an old gran-
bit. Certainly Perez Jimenez is not the 
iirst victim of Betancourt's false charges 
of corruption. Romulo has tried it before. 
Back in 1945, when the Accion Democratica 
won its first term of power, Bo/nut? Betan-
court followed his victory by indicting two 
former Presidents of Venezuela?Eliazar To.
? Contreras and Isaias Angarita- for mis-
use of funds. With them in the dock was a 
third defendant, Beier Pietri. They were 
found guilty and their property confiscated. 
'Mien Perez Jimenez and the military trium-
virate came to power in 1948, although there 
were copious grounds for similar accusations 
against the deposed Accion Democratica lead-
ers, it was decided to end this vicious circle 
of persecution of political adversaries, and 
no charges were made against Betancourt. 
The confiscated property was restored to Be-
lancourt's three victims. 
How lightly Betancourt actually holds his 
charges of cerruption is shOWn by the fact 
that Uelar Pietri, one of the 1945 defendants, 
was taken into the Lconi cabinet in 1964, and 
former President Lopes Contreras is now a 
highly honored exhibit at all current Accion 
Democratica public functions in Caracas. 
it appears, however, that Betancourt has 
rnede a major mistake in extraditing and 
placing Perez Jimenez on trial. He has dan-
gerously miscalculated Venezuelan public 
opinion. Instead of discrediting Perez Jime-
nez, the persecution has martyrized him. A 
wave of personal sympathy for the former 
?accident swept over the country 'while he 
was tieing held in prison. Coinciding with 
the national Mood of disillusionment with 
Betancourt, this mounting pro-Perez Jime-
nez feeling suddenly became a political force. 
It has now' begun to panic the leftists. 
The data broke on April 9, the day Perez 
Jimenez was brought from prison to court. 
A miracle occurred. An unorganized and 
spontaneous outburst of support for Perez 
rocked Caracas. Sympathizers appeared with 
brooms and hoses to cleanse the streets over 
which his oar would pests on the way to the 
Supreme Court building. Thousands lined 
the sidewalks. Women and children threw 
flowers at the general's car. A roar of "Viva 
Perez Jimenez" broke from thousands of 
throats, It was the unexpectedness of the 
demonstration that made it so strikingly im-
portant. It was as if multitudes of people, 
who had silently endured the privations and 
sufferings of the Accion Democratica years, 
had at last found their collective voice and 
were calling for the return of the President 
under whom life had been better. 
The Accion. Deinocratica regime immedi-
ately realized the importance of stopping 
this popular outburst before it endangered 
their dictatorship. The seccond day, the 
approaches to the supreme court were sealed 
oh by a deep line of armed troops. Passes 
were required for entrance, and applicants 
were screened. A score or so of Perez 
Jimenez's followers were placed under arrest 
to frighten the demonstrators. Even one of 
the Perez Jimenez lawyers, Rafael Perez 
Perdoma, was placed under temporary arrest. 
The intimidation went further. A Caracas 
TV station was courageous enough to place 
a strong supporter of Perez Jimenez, Erwin 
Berguera, on the air to present the Perez 
case. Burguera Was seized by the police and 
held in prison for 47 days. 
The press Was also intimidated. The in-
fluential Citpriles newspapers had demanded 
the liberation of the former President. As 
a result, Miguel Capriles, the editor of La 
asfera, was arrested and charged With anti-
government activities, and proceedings were 
instituted to abrogate the parliamentary im-
munity of one of his editors. To hurt the 
exiles press in the pocket book, the Gov-
ernment next indicated to the big American 
oil companies that it Weluld be to their ad-
vantage to withdraw their advertising from 
riiiipnles. To the shame of America, all com-
plied. 
But these-asvful events were overshadowed 
by the public registering of names of 
Venezuelan citizens demanding Perot 
Jimenez's liberation. Friends of the former 
President circulated petitions throughout the 
country. In order to avoid the suspicion of 
fraud, all signers were asked to affix their 
identity numbers?a dangerous step in a 
country which is a quasi-police state. These 
names were printed in full-page advertise-
ments in La Esfera and other newspapers. 
To date, approximately 50,000 such sig-
natures have been obtained and published. 
They are still pouring in at a mounting rate. 
When we examine the published names, an-
other surprising fact strikes us. Although 
the names of some distinguished persons ap-
pear, these are not predominantly the Vene-
zuelan elite. Nor are they former jobholders 
under the Perez administration. For the 
most part, they are the names of ordinary 
nonpolitical citizens who have had enough of 
Accion Democratica. It is the voice of a broad 
cross section of the Venezuelan people. One 
highly significant appearance among the pe-
titions is a list of 8,000 trade u nionists. When 
realizes that Betancourt and his agents con-
trol the Venezuelan unions with an iron 
hand, such a defection is symptomatic. 
XI/ 
Against such a setting, the question assails 
us: Can Perez Jimenez secure a fair trial in 
the Betancourt courts? Is there a hope of 
acquitted? Here we find ourselves in the 
world of surrnise. Let us look at the nese en 
scene before which the trial is taking place. 
The Supreme Court of Venezuela, which is 
sitting in full to hear this historic case, is 
stacked 'With Perez Jimenez's political en-
emies. It is ironic that, although the stately 
supreme court building was erected by Perez 
Jimenez, none of his adherents are on the 
bench. It is a court which has been made 
oyer and handpicked by the leftist regimes 
Which have held power since his departure. 
The president of the supreme court, Hugo 
Ardilla. Bustamente, is an undisguised Accion 
Democratica politician. He was the chairman 
of the independent committee for Raul Lecmi 
in the 1963 presidential election, despite the 
strict law that justices of the supreme court 
may not engage in partisan politics. Another 
Pasties is Gonzalo Barrios, whose brother is 
minister of the interior in Leone's cabinet. 
Be contains the political police. Perez Jime-
nez's counsel, Dr. Rafael Naranjo Ostty, after 
persistent efforts, has succeeded in disqualify-
ing two or three justices who have been par-
ticularly virulent in their anti-Perez Jimenez 
bias. But others remain. 
The atmosphere in the courtroom is indi-
cated by an occurrence on the first day of 
the trial. A woman rose from the spectators' 
seats; and interrupted the proceedings with 
a screaming outburst of obscenities directed 
at the seated Perez Jimenez. When she was 
quieted, it was discovered that she was the 
sister of Cesar Tinoco Richer, one of the 
Justices on the bench. Although, under 
Venezuelan law, her offense called for a 
prison sentence of 8 days, she was released 
without charges. 
The prime exhibit of bias in the case is 
Attorney General Jose Antonio Lazada, who 
is prosecuting the fiasco. Lazada envisages 
himself as a sort of native Vishinsky, who

was discovered that be was spending his time 
working for the leftist lied= Demooratica, 
Perez Jimenez fired him. Lazada anticipates 
Ills revenge in this trial. 
But Perez Jimenez also hodds an ace card 
in the trial. He is being defended by Vene-
zuela's outstanding advocate, Rafael Naran-
jo Ostty. If Lazada looms as the Vishinsky 
of the trial, Naranjo comes as an unpolitical 
Clarence Darrow of the Venezuelan bar. All 
his life, Naranjo has fought brilliantly for 
unpopular causes. As a youth he was im-
prisoned and tortured by Dictator Gomez 
for his defense of union labor. An unpoliti-
cal figure, he had no acquaintance with 
Perez Jimenez while the latter was Presi-
dent. But when Perez approached him to be 
his defender, he was so impressed by the 
palpable injustice Of the legal trap which 
Betancourt has contrived that he offered to 
plead the case without a fee. The clash of 
two such contrasting advocates gives moving 
drama to the courtroom scene.
