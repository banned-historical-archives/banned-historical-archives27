 Science Adviser Keyworth
 To Leave White House Job
 By Philip J. Hilts
 W;uhinRmn Poa[ Staff Writer
 White House science adviser
 George A. Keyworth II, one of the
 administration's chief promoters of
 President Reagan's Strategic De-
 fense Initiative, said yesterday that
 he will resign and form a company
 to help corporations build up intel-
 ligence-gathering systems.
 Keyworth said he has done what
 he could in four years and thought it
 wise to leave the job at "a happy
 point."
 He said he believes that the mis-
 sile defense research program is
 well under way, that science fund-
 ing has been boosted and that co-
 operation between industry and uni-
 versities has been pushed along.
 Keyworth said he was not leaving
 because of any conflict in the ad-
 ministration.
 Asked why he wanted to leave
 when things were going well, he
 said, "I have been here pushing five
 years now. I think the president
 needs some fresh blood. When I
 walk into a room everybody knows
 what I'm going to say.
 "Also, I simply want to leave," he
 said. "I am beginning to be envious.
 The real action is out there in in-
 dustries that are trying to find a
 new competitive spirit, motivated
 by the hot breath of competition on
 their necks. That's very exciting."
 He said he reads with envy of the
 corporate battles of such companies
 as IBM against foreign challenges.
 "I want some," he said.
 ~Ke worth said he plans to start a
 new business with Herbert Meyer
 .
 former special assistant to Central
 Intelligence Agency Director Wil-
 liam . Casey, and now vice chair-
 man of the National Intelligence
 Coui jl. The council drafts-ititelli
 gence estimates from data devel-
 a a dozen agencies.
 Keyworth's new business will of-
 fer to set up intelligence-gathering
 systems for companies to gather
 information about potential mar-
 kets. The company will not gather
 intelligence, but will show clients
 how to find and analyze political,
 DR. GEORGE A. KEYWORTH II
 ... a leading "Star Wars" advocate
 economic, cultural and other infor-
 mation for use in foreign markets.
 The accomplishments Keyworth,
 46, said he was proudest of are his
 work for the "Star Wars" research
 program, his work to bring greater
 cooperation between industry and
 universities and his role in building
 science budgets.
 Perhaps-the two most controver-
 sial aspects of Keyworth's tenure
 have been his strong advocacy of
 the strategic defense initiative and
 his reversal of the historical role of
 the president's science adviser.
 From the day he took the job, Key-
 worth said he would not be a con-
 duit into the White House for
 American science as previous ad-
 visers have.
 Instead, he would be part of the
 White House "team." He also set up
 the White House Science Council, a
 low-profile body of scientists offer-
 ing information to the administra-
 tion. It was not a forum for debate
 like the previous body, the Science
 Advisory Committee.
 Keyworth said he did not tell any-
 one in government of his leaving until
 Wednesday, when he informed White
 House chief of staff Donald T. Regan.
 He will leave office by Dec. 31.
 "He is going to be missed," said
 William Carey, executive officer of
 the American Association for the
 Advancement of Science, largest
 scientific body in the United States.
 "Keyworth has developed over his
 five years in the job into an effective
 and sometimes aggressive advocate
 of fundamental research."
 Other leaders in science have
 said Keyworth's ability to keep sci-
 ence funding high while other bud-
 gets were being cut was his chief
 accomplishment.
 But Carey said Keyworth has re-
 cently  expressed  apprehension
 about the proapects for keeping up
 government support for science.
 "He has been trying to warn the
 scientific community that there are
 dark days ahead," Carey said. "I
 can't look into his mind, but I think
 he saw a period of budgetary siege
 approaching and that he might not
 be able to see effectively to protec-
 tion of research.
 "Perhaps we could have been
 helped if Keyworth stayed on," Car-
 ey said. He noted that it will be a
 difficult time for a successor now,
 just before budget deficits lead to
 cutting of "discretionary" budgets
 such as those for basic research. .

 CIA gays novae
 t er    ail "hasu-f-%
 By Michael J. Bonafield
 7HE WASHINGTON TIMES
 The Soviet Union is "the world's
 last em ire,"which "after 67 years
 of communism ... has entered its
 terminal phase" an analysis pre-
 pare for the CIA says.
 The  ocur=t. written for CIA__
 Director William Casey in late June
 bvHerbert E. Meyer, vice chairman
 of the National Intelligence Coun-
 cil, describes the Soviet Union as a
 termtn`ally -ill `giant th1 t eft tr o its
 own devices will collapse unless
 sweeping reforms are instituted.
 The National Intelligence Coun-
 cillapart of the CIA, is made up of
 individuals who are experts in a
 variety of fields. NIC coordinates
 its research for dissemination to
 the CIA director and o t h e r key 1 ~ o v -
 e r n m e n t officials. Mr. Mere s ana-
 lvsis was marked"unclassi_ted
 Citing studies by Marshall
 Goldman of Harvard University's
 Russian Research Center,-the`ana-
 lysis reports "that food is in short
 supply outside the Moscow-
 Leningrad area, and that rationing
 has been imposed in 12 cities." The
 document does not name the cities.
 "According'to recent issues of
 published Soviet medical litera
 ture;' Mr. Meyer writes, "five of
 seven key communicable diseases
 are now out of control: polio, diph-
 theria, scarlet fever, whooping
 cough, measles"
 Mr. Meyer cites Georgetown Uni-
 versity demographer Murray
 Feshbach, as reporting that "so
 high is the incidence of measles
 that it now stands  fractionally
 below the level at which epidemi-
 ologists attribute the problem to.
 mass malnutrition:'
 Infant mortality in the U.S.S.R.,
 Mr. Meyer says, "is rising and life
 expectancy is falling."
 The analysis describes a deep
 sense of pessimism that "has taken
 hold among the Soviet people," a
 reflection of which is the abortion
 rate.
 Mr. Meyer says the nation's abor-
 tion rate "as a whole is between 60
 percent and 70 percent, and ... for
 Slavs and Balts is 75 percent to 80
 percent."
 "We simply cannot attribute
 these staggering rates entirely to
 the low quality of available birth-
 control products and to decisions
 by sensible, practical parents to
 limit the size of their families," he
 writes. "Rather, we must view these
 rates, at least partly, as an indica-
 tion of the average couple's judg-
 ment of life in the Soviet Union."
 Referring to. remarks by Frank
 Shakespeare, who supervises
 Radio Free Europe and Radio
 Liberty, Mr. Meyer says, "These
 abortion rates reflect a vision of the
 future that is bleak and despairing,
 almost to the point of national sui-
 cide."
 The CIA report calls the U.S.S.R.
 "a demographic basket case.
 Citing the declining birthrate
 among Russians, the pre-eminent
 ethnic group in the country, Mr.
 Meyer says, "In the coming years,
 the able-bodied working-age pop-
 ulation of the Russian Republic,
 which contains roughly two-thirds
 of the Soviet Union's total industrial
 production capacity, will actually
 decline"
 That means, he says, "High birth
 rates in the Moslem republics have
 begun to soak up vast amounts of
 investment for schools, hospitals,
 roads_ and so forth."
 As a result, Mr. Meyer adds,
 "Fewer and fewer Russians must
 work harder and harder to support
 more and more non-Russians."
 Only about half the population, he
 says, can speak Russian.
 The Soviet Union is composed of
 15 autonomous republics, of which
 the Russian Soviet Federated
 Socialist Republic is the largest
 and, traditionally, the pool from
 which the leadership is drawn.
 "After 67 years of communist
 rule;' the document says, "the
 Soviet Union remains a 19th
 century-style empire, comprised
 of more than 100 nationality groups
 and dominated by the Russians.
 There is not one major nationality
 group that is content with the
 present,  Russian-controlled
 Approved Fosrl  leasen2ot          /O3tMtARD
 yearn for its political and economic
 freedom"
 Arguing that the imperial system
 itself is fatally flawed, the analysis
 asserts that, "At long last, history
 seems to be catching up with the
 world's last surviving empire."
 Citing the Kremlin's "over-
 emphasis" on military production,
 Mr. Meyer charges that this has
 "wrecked the country's civilian
 industrial and technological base."
 "The Soviets have failed miser-
 ably to generate the kinds of inno-
 vations on which modern
 technologies are increasingly
 dependent: robotics, micro-
 electronics, computerized commu-
 nications and information-
 processing systems," Mr. Meyer
 says.
 The U.S.S.R. now can produce lit-
 tle but weapons, the intelligence
 report says. As a result, the econ-
 omy "has become stagnant and may
 even be starting to shrink- a trend
 that already has begun to, make
 even production of weapons more
 costly and inefficient"
 The Kremlin leadership under-
 stands these problems and has
 begun to realize "that something
 has gone hideously wrong," Mr.
 Meyer says.
 He suggests that the Politburo,
 which includes the nation's top
 leaders and wields autocratic
 power, faces one of three courses:
 make fundamental reforms, fail to
 correct the "downward spiral," or
 choose a high-risk course "to
 change the correlation of forces"--.

 Moynihan calls
 Managua arms
 role unproven
 A  roved For Release 2jq   Qjffl  CSIRDP90-011
 From wire Sa 1crs
 WASHINGTON    The Senate
 Intelligence Committee never has
 been given "conclusive informa-
 tion" to back up administration's
 ;charge that Nicaragua is sending
 arms to El Salvador, committee
 vice  chairman  Daniel  Patrick
 Moynihan (D, N.Y.) said yesterday.
 Mr. Moynihan also disclosed
 that the committee had reached
 written, formal agreement with the
 Central Intelligence Agency about
 when and how the CIA is to notify
 Congress about covert-operations.
 He said the agency has asked that
 the agreement be kept secret, but
 he spoke about its major points.
 The existence of an ongoing
 cross-border flow of arms has been
 the major justification for the ad-
 -mini tration's highly controversial
 three-year-old   "secret   war"
 against the Nicaraguan govern-
 ment.
 The issue was raised again this
 week when a former CIA analyst,
 David  MacMichael,  said   such
 claims are based on outdated infor-
 mation, and that administration of-
 ficials are misleading Congress.
 Mr. MacMichael, 56, worked on
 intelligence estimates on Central
 America for the CIA's National In-
 telligence CounclT-under a two-year
 contract through March, 1983.
 State Department and CIA offi-
 cials have rejected Mr. NiacMi-
 chael's claims but have not re-
 leased evidence that arms flows
 are continuing.
 Secretary of State George P.
 Shultz angrily said, "It is i-nconceiv-
 ablethat an informed, honest per-
 son" could deny the arms supply
 from Nicaragua to the Salvadoran
 guerrillas.
 "The evidence is everywhere:'
 I've looked at a lot of it and I think
 it is totally and absolutely convinc-
 ing that the direction and the sup=
 ply of the guerrillas in El Salvador
 comes from Nicaragua:"
 CIA Director William' J. ? Casey
 said Mr.  MacMichael's charges
 were "just one man's opinion."
 Mr.. Moynihan said his. commit,
 tee, which oversees intelligence
 operations, "has not been presented
 with any conclusive information"
 to document the arms flow.
 Mr. Moynihan, a consistent sup-
 porter of aid to the anti-Sandinista
 rebels, predicted that disclosures
 challenging  the  administration's
 I think it is totally
 and absolutely
 convincing that the
 direction and the
 supply of the guerrillas'_
 in El Salvador comes _
 from Nicaragua.."  -?
 GEORGE P.SHULTZ
 repeated assertions that Nicaragua
 is    "exporting  revolution" will
 prompt Congress to halt aid to the
 "contra" guerrillas,
 Senate and House leaders have-
 been trying to work out a compro-
 mise on funding that will at least
 give $6 million to $8 million more
 to the contras to help them wind
 down their operations. But House
 leaders have said that recent dis-
 closures about the lack of proof
 about Nicaraguan involvement in
 the Salvadoran civil war mean no
 new aid will be voted by the Demo-
 cratic-controlled chamber.
 The Senate and House intelli-
 gence committees monitor the ac-
 tivities of the country's intelligence
 agencies.  Moynihan  almost  re-
 signed his vice chairmanship over
 a flap with the CIA last April, when
 he accused agency officials of with-
 'holding - information about their
 role in the mining of Nicaragua's
 harbors.
 That incident led to a new over-
 sight agreement that be said was
 signed last Thursday by Mr. Casey,
 committee Chairman Barry Gold-
 water (R, Ariz) and Mr. Moynihan.
 The new secrecy agreement re-
 quires that Congress be informed of
 "significant anticipated activity"
 in spy operations, Mr. Moynihan
 said.

 FAR.EASTEPN ECONOMIC REVIEW
 21 June 1984
 Haw Britain fell for the
 Peking game-plan
 By Derek'Davles In Hongkong
 The most recent of many Western     Plenty of material for China to work
 at emnts to- ana yse    mese  ar- on here with the British. ranging from
 gaining techniques is a confidential
 s u    ro uce  or the United States
 ationa Intel Intelligence Council by te
 Ran    orp. It is based on t he experi-
 ence of senior US officials who
 negotiated with the Chinese through-
 out the 1970s in an effort to normalise
 Sino-US relations. The paper, pri-
 vately circulated 1  t year, was written
 by  is ar   olomon, a China s ecia -

 kin  between 1971 and 19-b
 mem er o    e      atonal       ty
 Council and who today head's
 research  ra ramme on international
 security pa i_c es.
 Among its main points:
 ^ Chinese officials are single-minded
 and disciplined in pursuit of Chinese
 interests, but distrustful of imper-
 sonal, legalistic negotiations. They al-
 ways attempt to cultivate foreign offi-
 cials sympathetic to their cause, man-
 ipulating   personal   relationships
 (guanxi) and feelings of friendship, ob-
 ligation or guilt in an interplay be-
 tween superior and dependent.
 Approved
 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
 initial legalistic approach - based on
 the '.'unequal treaties" -- to the natural
 desire of British Embassy officials to
 boost Sino-British relations, plus guilt
 about the past, in particular the Opium
 Wars, which led to the foundation of
 Hongkong.
 ^ The Chinese always seek to establish
 their own ground rules by pressing
 their foreign counterparts to agree to
 certain general "principles," which are
 later constantly invoked. Such princi-
 ples, however, can be set aside in order
 to reach a desired agreement --- which
 may in fact clearly contravene the
 principles earlier insisted on.
 After the agreement with Thatcher
 in September 1982 to open the talks, no
 progress whatsoever was made until
 the British had accepted two "princi-
 ples." The first was that sovereignty
 over Hongkong would revert to Peking
 on 1 July 1997 (a concession made -
 conditional to the conclusion of a satis-
 factory agreement - in a letter from
 Thatcher to Chinese Premier Zhao
 Ziyang in spring 1983). The second was
 that responsibility for the administra-
 tion of Hongkong would also revert
 (this, was also conditionally conceded,
 in another Thatcher message to Zhao
 in the autumn of 1983). The British
 have yet to push hard enough to ascer-
 th
 tions of his wife, Jiang Qing, by telling
 Kissinger that China's women were too
 numerous and caused "disasters."
 Obviously, the terms under which
 China recovers part of its territory
 from colonial rule is a highly sensitive
 issue on which those wishing to com-
 promise for China's economic benefit
 are  vulnerable  to  dogmatists  and
 nationalistic  elements  within  the
 party. In June 1983, elder statesman
 Deng Xiaoping appeared to have reas-
 serted himself against elements which
 opposed his pragmatic line. However,
 little or no progress was reportedly
 made at the most recent session - the
 15th - of the Sino-British talks, held
 shortly after Deng had brusquely con-
 tradicted assurances on  Hongkong
 given by fellow Chinese leaders, in-
 cluding a formerdefence minister. This
 occurred during a session of the Na-
 tional People's Congress at which
 Hongkong evidently became a bone of
 contention between elements of the
 party and the army-
 The Chinese prefer to negotiate on
 their own territory for being at home
 aids internal communications, deci-
 sion-making and their orchestration of
 the ambience of negotiations - from
 banquet toasts to the manipulation of
 the press.
 The 1997 talks are being held in Pe-
 king, where the British bravely claim
 that there is no significance in the
 changes in the relatively lowly venues
 allocated for the meetings. While the
 British remain stiffly uncommunica-
 tivetothe press (in line with the,'-confi-
 dentiality" imposed by Thatcher), the
 Chinese give press conferences and
 briefings and arrange leaks - all gob-
 bled up by the Hongkong media-
 P. The Chinese often use a trusted in-
 termediary  to  convey  their  pre-
 negotiating position to a foreign gov-
 ernment in a deniable or face-saving
 manner in order to "load" the agenda
 of their foreign counterpart. Thus they
 used the Pakistani Government in
 1971 to communicate their stance to
 the Nixon administration prior to Kis-
 singer's secret visit.
 Peking evidently used former Bri-
 tain whether these "principles" are
 flexible or non-negotiable.
 ^ Peking's negotiating positions are
 highly sensitive to the play of China's
 own political factionalism: a strong
 leader can promote a policy which a
 collective leadership would be unable
 to support, or a negotiating position
 may be withdrawn or hardened as a re-
 sult of factional conflict. The more
 rigid and posturing a negotiator, or the
 more "irrational" the posture, the
 more internal factional pressures are
 influencing the negotiations.
 In this context, Solomon notes the
 Chinese use of symbols (from ping-
 pong to pandas) and oblique hints. In
 1971, during Henry Kissinger's secret
 trip to Peking to arrange former US
 .president Richard Nixon's 1972 visit,
 the late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai
 hinted at conflict with the Chinese
 leadership by omitting the name of
 then defence minister Lin Biao from an
 official list. In 1973, the late chairman
 Mao Zedonc indicated to US visitors

 POLICY ON SOVIET
 WITH KEY EXPERTS
 LONG-TERM PLANS STUDIED
 Secretary Said to Stress Need
 to Review Political, Arms
 and Economic Issues
 By BERNARD GWERTZMAN
 Sj*c 1 to The xew Ymknmes
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 - Secretary
 of State George P. Shultz held an all-
 day meeting today with experts on
 Soviet affairs and senior Reagan Ad=
 ministration officials to discuss United
 States policy toward the Soviet Union.
 With the crisis in west Beirut appar-
 ently ending, Mr. Shultz has decided it
 is time to pay more attention to interna-
 tional issues other than the Middle
 East, his aides said, and has given pri-
 ority to a review of long-term political,
 economic and military policy toward
 the Russians.  -    .
 - Mr. Shultz, who has noparticular ex-
 .pettise m- Soviet affairs, patterned
 today's session after an all-day meeting
 he had with former Secretary of State
 Henry A. Kissinger and others on Mid-
 dle East policy on July 17, the day after
 he was sworn in as Secretary.
 Brezhnev's Ill Health Cited
 According to State Department offi-
 cials there is a need for a fresh look at
 policy toward the Soviet Union, given
 major developments already apparent.
 They said that in view of the precarious
 state of Leonid I. Brezhnev's health
 there is always a chance of a shift in the
 Soviet leadership, which would necessi-
 tate a careful handling of relations dur-
 ingthe initial post-Brezhnev period.
 In the economic field, the Adminis-
 tration has become involved in a seri-
 ous dispute with its Western European
 allies over sanctions against the Soviet
 Union as a result of the imposition of

 martial law in Poland. The Europeans
 have refused to'go along with President
 Reagan's efforts to prevent organiza-
 tions with licenses from American com-
 panies from producing components for
 a natural gas pipeline from Siberia to
 Western Europe. The Administration is
 considering what steps to take against
 companies that defy tha American
 sanction.
 Moreover, the Administration, in
 deference .to pressure from the farm
 belt, has allowed sales of grain to the
 Soviet Union to continue, at the same
 time that it is trying to curb the transfer.
 .of technology. This has prompted addi-
 tional criticism from Europeans who
 have charged Washington with trying to
 limit their trade with Moscow ? while
 continuing its own agricultural trade-
 "Relations between the Reagan Ad-
 ministration and the Soviet Union have
 been strained, but the two Governments
 have begun separate negotiations on
 limiting medium-range nuclear mis-
 siles in Europe and on seeking reduce i
 tions in each side's strategic nuclear
 weapons. No progress has been re-
 ported from either set of negotiations. .
 Haig Stressed Contacts
 Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig
 Jr. had stressed the importance of
 maintaining contact with the Russians,'
 and at one point even seemed to advo-
 cate an early meeting between Mr.
 Reagan and Mr. Breznnev, an idea that
 seems to have been put aside by the
 White House.
 Mr. Haig held three rounds of meet-
 ings with Foreign Minister Andrei A.
 Gromyko of the Soviet Union, the last
 on June 18 and 19, in New York, just a
 week before Mr. Haig resigned. Mr-
 Shultz is planning to attend the regular
 United Nations General Assembly ses-
 'sign in New York next month and would
 normally meet with Mr. Gromyko
 there, but no firm plans have been set.
 Several of the outside experts who
 took part in today's session with Mr.
 Shultz, served as senior officials in =
 previous  administrations  and  Mr.
 Shultz knows some of them from his
 days as Treasury Secretary for Presi-
 dent Nixon from 1972-to 1974.
 Former Kissinger Aides Present
 They included William G. Hyland and
 Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who were Mr. Kis-
 singer's chief Soviet affairs advisers,
 and Brent Scowcroft, who served as Mr.
 Kissinger's deputy on the National Se-
 curity Council and later became na-
 tional security adviser to President
 Ford.
 Also  participating  were  Donald
 Rumsfeld, who was Mr. Ford's Defense
 Secretary, and Harold Brown, who was .
 President Carter's Defense Secretary,
 as well as the present Defense Secre.
 tart', Caspar W. Weinberger.
 Mr. Shultz's willingness to consult
 with Mr. Kissinger has aroused consid-
 erable attention, since many of Mr.
 Reagan's supporters have been critical j
 of Mr. Kissinger's policies. At his news.
 conference on Friday Mr. Shultz was
 asked about the. increased attention
 being given to Mr. Kissinger and his
 former aides, and whether it was true
 that Mr. Kissinger was now becoming
 "the primary foreign policy adviser of
 this Administration."
 . Praise for Ea-Secretary
 In response Mr. Shultz said that he
 himself was the principal foreign policy
 adviser. But he then went out of his way
 to praise Mr. Kissinger.
 "Dr. Kissinger is a wonderful person
 and a great friend, a person who has
 tremendous knowledge and comprehen-
 sion of what is going on," he said. "I .
 have enjoyed the benefit of his friend-
 ship and his ideas over many years, and
 I expect to continue to have that."
 "I'll continue to benefit from his ad.
 vice," he said. "But it's my job to be the
 principal foreign policy adviser to the
 President."
 Peter G. Peterson, who as Mr. Nix-
 on's Commerce Secretary, negotiated .
 the trade package with the Soviet Union
 that was signed in 1972, also attended
 the meeting. That trade package
 marked the high point of what became
 known as detente but was renounced by
 the Russians in 1974 when Congress
 linked credits and tariff reductions to
 the rate of'Jewish emigration from the
 .Soviet Union.
 W. Allen Wallis, who has been desig-
 nated as the Under Secretary of State
 for Economic Affairs, was another who
 took part in today's session, along with
 Walter J. Stoessel Jr., the outgoing
 Deputy Secretary.
 Norman Podhoretz, the editor of
 Commentary magazine, and a leading
 neo-conservative critic of the Reagan
 Administration's foreign policy for not
 being consistently firm enough against
 the Russians, was another participant.
 Others from the Administration who
 took part included: Henry    Owen,

 The controversy surrounding
 CIA Director William Casey inten-
 sified yesterday when anotherof his
 high-level. appointees became the
 object of critical questioning.
 On-July 7, the administration
 announced that Henry S. Rowen had
 been chosen to head the National
 .Intelligence Council -a group
 responsible for preparing national
 intelligence estimates for the CIA.
 Rowen resigned under pressure as
 president of the Rand Corp- in 1971,
 reportedly because he collaborated
 with Daniel Ellsberg in the release
 of the "Pentagon Papers."
 .  Casey yesterday refused to com-
 ment about the selection of Rowen
 and a. spokeswoman told The.News
 World that Casey was "unwilling to
 make any statements about why he
 appointed him to that position."
 Admiral Bobby R. Inman, CIA
 deputy director, also declined com-
 ment.
 `Lax about security'    -_
 "I think that the biggest worry is
 that here is a man who is pretty tax
 .about security.- sufficiently. lax
 that he lost his job at Rand;'-said
 retired Lt. Gen, Daniel O_ Graham,
 former -director of- the Defense
 Intelligence Agency.,
 .,As the boss out thereat Rand, he
 was ultimately responsible for the
 safeguarding of classified papers;'
 Graham said in a telephone inter-
 view from his office at the
 American Security Council in
 Washington-
 "I do recall that he testified essen-
 tiaDy forEllsberg at the trial. That's

 WASHINGTON, July 7-The Reagan
 Administration has selected Henry S.
 Rowen to head a newly created National
 Intelligence Council at the Central Intel-
 ligence Agency, Administration offi-
 cials said today.
 Mr. Rowen, a former. president of the
 Rand Corporation who resigned in 1971,
 partly because of Pentagon dissatisfac-
 tion with Rands security arrangements
 for the Pentagon papers, has until re-
 cently been a professor at Stanford Uni-
 versity's Graduate School of Business.
 He has already begun working at the
 C.I.A., but his appointment has not been
 announced.
 According to Administration officials,
 William J. Casey, the Director of Cen-
 tral Intelligence, chose W. Rowers for
 the post and decided to create the coun-
 cil to upgrade the system under which
 national intelligence  estimates are
 produced.
 Preparation of national intelligence
 estimate, which are supposed to be
 comprehensive studies of an issue or
 subject that reflect the views of the en-
 tire intelligence apparatus, has been a
 source of bitterness with intelligence of-
 ficials for nearly eight years. Mr. Casey
 recently told C.I.A officials in an
 agency newsletter that the system had
 become "slow, cumbersome and incon-
 sistent with providing the policy maker
 with a timely, crisp forecast that incor-
 porates clearly defined ? alternative
 views."
 Critics of the process have also
 charged that the estimates have pre-
 dominantly reflected C.I.A?: views, with
 important dissents from other intelli-
 gence agencies relegated to footnotes.
 cr-f;ol.i Tni-nor  T]ir,Ctnr of Central
 Intelligence.in the Carter Admuustra-
 tion, was accused by some intelligence
 officials of distorting estimates to make
 them dovetail with the Carter Adminis-
 tration's foreign policy, an allegation
 that Mr. Turner denied, although he ac-
 knowledged that he had personally re-
 written estimate papers. Mr. Rowen hilmself has been a vocal
 critic of the, intelligence estimates sys-
 tem, especially of what he has charac-
 terized as the C.I.A_'s optimistic assess-
 ments of Soviet military strength in the
 past. - Mr. Rowen, an Oxford-trained
 economist, served as Deputy Assistant
 Secretary of Defense under Robert S.
 McNamara. from 1961, to 1965, and be-
 came president of Rand in 1966.
 Separate Views Encouraged
 Under the new system, the council
 will be composed of those national intel-
 ligence officers charged with producing
 the estimates. They will report directly
 to Mr. Casey and to Bobby R. Inman,
 the C.I_A.'s Deputy Director....
 Senate critics of the agency, such as
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of
 New York, and Malcolm Wallop, Repub-
 lican of Wyoming, have urged Mr.
 Casey to, encourage the intelligence
 agencies to offer separate views and
 estimates. Several officials who follow
 intelligence matters, closely said that
 they doubted that the new council would
 lead to such a debate about the esti-
 mates.
 "I fear that this means business as
 usual," one Administration official ob-
 served.....-
