 POLITICAL TRENDS IN MALAYSIA'S BORNEO STATES
 Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysia's large but
 economically underdeveloped Borneo states, have
 recently been marked by growing political instabil-
 ity.   Centrifugal tendencies have risen since the
 end of Indonesian "confrontation," which had served
 to strengthen the allegiance of these states to
 Kuala Lumpur.   Prime Minister Abdul Rahman's abrupt
 ouster of Singapore from the federation in August
 1965 added to discontent in Borneo, as did the sub-
 sequent withdrawal of the UK's military forces from
 the Borneo states.   Two of the principal local po-
 litical parties have severed ties with Rahman's
 powerful Alliance coalition in Kuala Lumpur,  and
 are agitating for increased autonomy for their
 states.   The strong Communist movement among Sara-
 wak Chinese,  although handicapped by its lack of
 appeal among the non-Chinese majority, has exploited
 these developments.   Borneo's current leaders never-
 theless realize that complete independence could
 subject them to the greater danger of eventual Chi-
 nese or Indonesian domination.
 Background
 The British crown colonies
 of Sarawak and North Borneo joined
 with the independent Federation
 of Malaya and the semiautonomous
 British-protected state of Singa-
 pore in forming Malaysia in Sep-
 tember 1963.   At that time North
 Borneo reverted to its native name
 of Sabah.
 From Malaya's viewpoint the
 main objective of incorporating
 the Borneo states was to help
 avoid domination of the new fed-
 eration by Singapore's dynamic
 Chinese population.   Singapore's
 leaders visualized the enlarged
 federation primarily as an eco-
 nomic common market which would
 buoy up their own state's flag-
 ging economy as well as give a
 larger political arena in which
 to operate.
 As far as the Borneo lead-
 ers were concerned, merger con-
 stituted the only feasible road
 to freedom from colonial rule be-
 cause the UK showed no inclination
 to permit their politically in-
 experienced and economically un-
 viable states to attain independ-
 ence separately within the fore-
 seeable future. The sultan of
 oil-rich Brunei, on the other
 hand,  elected not to alter his
 domain's status as a British
 protectorate.

 For the UK the creation of
 Malaysia under firm,  anti-Communist
 leadership provided a way to end
 its rule in Borneo while still
 preserving a significant military,
 political,  and economic presence
 in the area.
 Confrontation
 Sukarno's Indonesia assailed
 the Malaysian concept from the
 start as a British "neocolonialist"
 plot,  and in early 1963 declared

 a policy of military "confronta-
 tion."   During the next two years
 the Indonesians carried out al-
 most 400 armed incursions and
 intelligence-gathering missions
 into the northern Borneo states,
 as well as a substantially smaller
 number into peninsular  (Western)
 Malaysia and Singapore.
 Most of these incursions,
 however, were poorly planned and
 executed.   Effective UK/Malaysian

 as well as popular dislike for
 the Indonesians,  prevented Sukarno
 from making any headway.            The most
 notable result of this harassment
 was to strengthen pro-Malaysian
 sentiment in both of the Borneo
 states.
 Centrifugal Tendencies
 The separation of Singapore
 from Malaysia--in effect a uni-
 lateral act of expulsion by Rah-
 man--revealed the tenuous nature
 of the federal concept,  and had
 deep repercussions in the Borneo
 states.   For the leaders of these
 states,  the arbitrary nature of
 Singapore's expulsion aroused
 fears of growing federal domina-
 tion and stirred desires for
 greater control over their own
 affairs.
 Centrifugal tendencies were
 further accelerated by the ending
 of Indonesian confrontation. With-
 out the major cohesive force which
 this threat gave to the federa-
 tion, Borneo leaders became more
 active politically.   They began
 to examine more critically their
 states' administrative subordina-
 tion to the federal regime and
 their local parties'  subordination
 to the powerful Alliance coalition
 in Kuala Lumpur.
 The end of confrontation,
 moreover, was followed during
 late 1966 by the departure of al-
 most all of the UK military and
 security forces and allied Common-
 wealth units  (Australians and New
 Zealanders)  from Borneo and their
 replacement by smaller numbers
 of predominantly Malay forces from
 the mainland.   In Brunei the UK
 retained a Gurkha brigade and sup-
 porting units.
 Borneans regarded the Malay
 replacements as less able than
 the British to protect their se-
 curity.   The Borneans had consid-
 ered the British to be politically
 disinterested and in some cases
 favorable to Bornean interests,
 but regarded the Malay forces as
 just another manifestation of
 mainland Malay/Muslim domination.
 Increased local discontent
 and anti-Malaysian tendencies
 have been accompanied by some in-
 crease in Communist activity,
 particularly in Sarawak.   During
 "confrontation" Indonesia sponsored
 and supported much of this activ-
 ity, but since early 1967 Djakarta
 has begun to help fight the small
 but deeply entrenched Communist
 guerrilla bands along the borders.
 Although the Communists are not
 yet a major threat, they appear
 to be laying the foundation for
 expanded future action.
 Any estrangement between the
 Borneo states and Kuala Lumpur
 could present an opportunity for
 increased involvement in Borneo
 by Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and
 his People's Action Party, who
 represent an intellectual attrac-
 tion for many educated young Chi-
 nese in the Borneo states.   The
 PAP reportedly has already estab-
 lished ties with non-Communist
 opposition elements in both Sara-
 wak and Sabah.   However,  it ap-
 pears doubtful that Lee would
 jeopardize his chances at improv-
 ing relations with Kuala Lumpur

 their counterparts in the Malayan
 peninsula,  are generally Muslim,
 and the Chinese a Buddhist/Taoist/
 Confucianist blend.
 Economic and Ethnic Factors
 Most political differences
 between Western Malaysia and the
 Borneo states arise from their
 markedly different ethnic composi-
 tions and from Borneo's cultural
 and economic backwardness.
 Sarawak and Sabah are far
 less developed than mainland
 Malaysia, having largely agricul-
 tural economies and requiring
 considerable expenditures of pub-
 lic funds in the building of an
 economic infrastructure.   The lack
 of roads and schools comparable
 to those in mainland Malaysia has
 been an object of some political
 exploitation, although this is
 being countered by the government's
 current efforts.   Of the two
 states,  Sabah, with extensive
 rubber and timber estates,  is the
 better off.
 The existence of several
 distinct ethnic and religious
 groups side by side within both
 states has contributed to their
 political instability.  In Sarawak,
 with an estimated population of
 866,000,  the indigenous tribal
 groups of early Malay origin--
 mostly Than and Land Dayak--con-
 stitute just over 50 percent of
 the population, with the Chinese
 comprising 32 percent and the
 Malays the remainder.   The tribal
 elements are mostly animist,  al-
 though increasing numbers have at
 least nominally adopted Islam or
 Christianity.   The Malays,  like
 In Sabah, whose population
 numbers about 547,000,  the tribal
 element is larger--67 percent--the
 major group being the Kadazan,
 who are also known as Dusan.   The
 Chinese comprise about 23 percent,
 and the "true" Malays number less
 than one percent, although some
 tribal elements, notably the
 coastal Bajau, have adopted Islam
 and call themselves Malay.  About
 25,000 Indonesian immigrants and
 some Filipinos are primarily
 estate workers or seagoing barter
 traders and do not play a signifi-
 cant political role.   During con-
 frontation some of the Indonesians
 engaged in subversive activities.
 In both states the large
 tribal elements have traditionally
 been politically passive as long
 as they were allowed to govern
 their own communal longhouses or
 villages and to follow their own
 agricultural pursuits, usually in
 the form of wasteful "slash and
 burn" farming of crops for
 their own consumption.   With self-
 government, however,                                                                        the tribal
 communities began to discover more
 common interests in their rela-
 tions with the Malays and Chinese.
 Their large numbers,  and the fact
 that their chieftains can generally
 dictate the attitude  (and vote)  of
 their followers, have enabled them
 to wield a growing influence in
 state politics.
 Most Malays in Sarawak and
 Malay/Muslim elements in Sabah are

 firmly convinced of the validity
 of the Malaysian federation con-
 cept and follow the lead of Alli-
 ance politicians in Kuala Lumpur.
 Their minority position within
 their own states contributes to
 this solidarity with the Malay-con-
 trolled federal government.
 The Chinese in the Borneo
 states,  as  elsewhere  in Southeast
 Asia,  are generally divided into
 distinct dialect groups that remain
 closely identified with their area
 of origin in China and with their
 occupation.   Although they domi-
 nate retail trade and small in-
 dustry,  they engage more widely
 in agriculture and related indus-
 tries than the Chinese on main-
 land Malaysia and have thus been
 somewhat slower to develop polit-
 ical or labor organizations.
 In both Sarawak and Sabah,
 Chinese businessmen and conserva-
 tive elements have formed Alliance-
 associated parties modeled after
 the Malayan Chinese Association
 in Western Malaysia.   In contrast
 to the broadly supported Chinese
 Association in Sabah,  the Sarawak
 Chinese Association is weak, with
 most Chinese supporting the large,
 Communist-dominated Sarawak United
 Peoples Party.
 Land hunger is a major cause
 of rural Chinese dissatisfaction
 in Sarawak.  State law,  in effect,
 allows Sarawak's Chinese to buy
 land, in an area of only 1,000
 square miles,  or two percent of
 the state's territory.
 Sarawak Politics
 Sarawak politics have been
 stormy during the past year.  The
 primary political grouping ever
 since merger has been the multi-
 party Sarawak Alliance,  affiliated
 with the ruling Malaysian Alli-
 ance in Kuala Lumpur.   Internal
 disputes,  however, have seriously
 weakened the Sarawak Alliance
 and have raised the once remote
 possibility of its defeat in the
 next election, which the consti-
 tution requires be held by August
 1968.
 This deterioration in the
 Sarawak Alliance was marked last
 year by the defection of one of
 its major components,  the Iban-
 dominated Sarawak National Party
 (SNAP).   This followed Kuala
 Lumpur's replacement of Chief
 Minister Stephen Ningkan,  a mem-
 ber of the SNAP, with Tawi Sli,
 a more tractable Than from an-
 other Alliance party.                                                                                When the
 Sarawak High Court ruled the
 government's action unconstitu-
 tional, Kuala Lumpur declared a
 local state of emergency and
 amended the state's constitution

 to permit the governor to convene
 the assembly to remove Ningkan
 legally, which it did.   The gov-
 ernment attempted to assuage popu-
 lar resentment by promising early
 elections, but conveniently failed
 to set a specific date.
 This heavy-handed interfer-
 ence aroused unprecedented criti-
 cism of Kuala Lumpur, further in-
 creased Ningkan's popularity,  and
 strengthened the position of those
 who favor increased autonomy.
 Ningkan promptly led SNAP's as-
 semblymen into the opposition.
 SNAP remains an essentially con-
 servative,  anti-Communist group,
 however,  and stops short of advo-
 cating complete separation from
 Malaysia.
 The principal component
 party of the weakened Alliance
 coalition is the Pesaka, which
 derives its main support from the
 Than and Land Dayak.   Pesaka's
 leader,  Temenggong Jugah,  is the
 principal Than chieftain, but is
 relatively ineffectual.   Other
 Alliance parties are the small
 Sarawak Chinese Association,  the
 Partai Negara,  a Malay-dominated
 group, and BARJASA,  a mixed Malay/
 Dayak party.   Kuala Lumpur has
 tried to unite the three non-
 Chinese Alliance parties into a
 large and more effective native
 organization, but rivalry among
 their respective leaders has
 blocked the effort.
 More significant than SNAP
 as an opposition force is the
 largely Chinese, Communist-domi-
 nated Sarawak United Peoples Party
 (SUPP).   Formed in 1959,  SUPP is
 TAW1 SLI
 the oldest, best-organized, and
 best-led party in the state and
 may well have the most popular
 support.   In the 1963 assembly
 elections it did in fact receive
 a plurality of the votes, but
 gained only five of the 36 elected
 seats because of an indirect elec-
 tion procedure largely designed
 to curtail Chinese political in-
 fluence.   Since the constitution
 requires that the next election
 be in the form of a direct popular
 vote,  the SUPP can be expected to
 make significant gains.
 From its inception SUPP has
 been the principal target of Com-
 munist penetration efforts in
 Sarawak, and much of its rank and
 file soon came under Communist
 control.   During "confrontation"
 the security forces cracked down
 on Communist elements in the party
 and weakened their influence.   In
 the past year or so, however,  the
 Communists have staged a comeback.

 under Communist control.   Chairman
 Ong Kee Hui is a moderate and
 Secretary General Stephen Yong

 appear powerless to make any

 weaken the Communist element.
 A recurrent nightmare for the
 government and Alliance leaders is
 the possibility of a SNAP/SUPP

 ical indoctrination for the SCO's
 armed guerrillas on the Indonesian
 side of the Sarawak border.
 The organization framework
 of the SCO is provided by the
 Sarawak Liberation League and
 the Youth Association, with the
 Farmers'  Association and the NKNLL
 having no formal structure and
 depending on the others for direc-
 tion.   Headed by a central commit-
 tee,  this structure follows a typ-
 ical Communist organizational
 pattern down through individual
 local cells.
 The SCO currently has a
 hard-core strength of close to
 1,500.   SCO members in Sarawak
 under arms or having access to
 arms probably number between 800
 and 1,000.  In addition, Malaysian
 and British security officials
 believe the SCO has some 700-800
 armed and trained guerrillas in-
 side Indonesia.   These officials
 estimate that SCO has between
 15,000 and 25,000 sympathizers,
 many of them in SUPP.
 Despite SCO's success in
 establishing an effective covert
 apparatus and in dominating SUPP
 on the branch level,  its lack of
 appeal among the tribal and Malay
 element of the population will
 limit its prospects for gaining a
 broader following for some time
 to come.   Its inability to gain
 wider indigenous support is prob-
 ably based as much on its largely
 Chinese composition as on its
 Communist complexion.

 The SCO leaders are fully
 aware of this problem and their
 current directives state that
 more effective "racial. work"  is a
 major objective.  These directives
 also indicate that the SCO intends
 to work hard for SUPP electoral
 victory as a major step toward
 its ultimate goals:   the disrup-
 tion of Malaysia and the creation
 of an independent Sarawak under
 Communist control.
 The SCO is Peking-oriented,
 and there have been some indica-
 tions of direct ties with the Chi-
 nese mainland.   In 1966,  for ex-
 ample, a senior Sarawak Liberation
 League officer reportedly repre-
 sented "North Kalimantan" at an
 Afro-Asian writers'  conference in
 Peking.   Captured SCO documents
 urge the rank and file to study
 the works of Mao Tse-tung and
 emphasize the necessity for train-
 ing armed forces in preparation
 for protracted warfare.
 multiparty coalition affiliated
 with the Malaysian Alliance on the
 mainland.   Formed in 1962, until
 recently it included all of Sabah's
 three major political parties:
 the Muslim-dominated United Sabah
 National Organization  (USNO),  the
 tribal-dominated United Pasakmomo-
 gun Kadazan Organization  (UPKO),
 and the Sabah Chinese Association.
 The largest of these is USNO,
 led by Tun Mustapha bin Dato
 Harun.   Although nominally multi-
 racial in its membership,  its
 leaderhip and main support are
 Muslim/Malay and it has remained
 strongly pro-Malaysia since its
 inception in 1961.
 UPKO is a close second in
 popular support.   Its base is
 primarily in the large Kadazan
 tribal group, although it also has
 some Chinese and Muslim support.
 Developments in Sabah
 The political situation in
 Sabah has been far more tranquil
 than in Sarawak,  and Sabah's po-
 litical institutions and parties
 have evolved more slowly.   The
 most striking difference between
 the two states is the absence in
 Sabah of any significant Communist
 activity.
 The Sabah Alliance,  like its
 counterpart in Sarawak,  is a loose

 DONALD STEPHENS
 The party's president Donald
 Stephens,  a Eurasian, has long
 been prominent on the political
 scene and served as chief minister
 in 1963-64.   Less enamored with
 the Malaysia concept than USNO,
 UPKO contains a significant ele-
 ment which favors greater autonomy
 for Sabah.
 The Sabah Chinese Association,
 like its counterparts in Sarawak
 and Western Malaysia,  is led by
 Chinese business and commercial
 interests.   It differs notably
 from the weak Sarawak association,
 however,  in that it receives the
 support of the majority of the
 Chinese population.
 Increasingly strained rela-
 tions between USNO and UPKO culmi-
 nated last month in UPKO's with-
 drawal from the Alliance.   Fric-
 tion between the two nominal part-
 ners had mounted during legisla-
 tive assembly elections held in
 April,  in which USNO, with 14
 seats, barely edged out UPKO,
 with 12.   The Chinese Association
 won five.   After the election,
 bickering immediately broke out
 over the distribution of cabinet
 seats and on 16 May Stephens
 marched the UPKO out of the
 Alliance.
 Although the split will
 probably encourage increased UPKO
 agitation for autonomy,  the
 "states rights"  forces do not
 appear in any position to domi-
 nate Sabah's body politic for
 the foreseeable future in view of
 the seeming strength of the ties
 between USNO and the Chinese As-
 sociation.   Moreover,  the lack of
 any significant Communist influ-
 ence in the state,  and the general
 economic prosperity indicates
 that Sabah has a better chance
 than Sarawak to maintain stabil-
 ity in the future.   (SECRET NO
