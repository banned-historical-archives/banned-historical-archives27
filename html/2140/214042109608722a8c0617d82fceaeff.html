THE ARTIST IN A MONOLITHIC STATE 
By George Gibian

College, Northampton, Mass.) 
PART I 
The Price of Success 
Three of the Soviet Union's most famous modern composers, Dmitri Shostakovich (left), Aram 
Khachaturian (center) and Sergei Prokofiev (right) experienced considerable difficulty in 
satisfying Communist officials of their artistic faithfulness to party objectives. Branded 
as "anti�popular formalists" in a 1948 musical purge, the three were rehabilitated in 1958. 
For Prokofiev, who died in 1953, the party's changed attitude came five years too late. 
This portrait study of Boris 
Pasternak suggests the 
qualities of quiet scholar�
ship, poetic reflection and 
artistic integrity which have 
helped to make the famous 
poet and novelist a highly 
controversial figure in the 
Soviet Union. 
The young Soviet writer, actor, or musician who at the thres-
hold of his career stops to consider what his professional future may hold 
in store for him is likely to be struck with awe by the tremendous gap 
separating the possibilities of great fame and great failure. 
The fact that two very divergent fates face a budding artist 
does not seem in itself very surprising. Is there any country in the 
world where the difference between the extremes of success and failure 
are not very pronounced? The real peculiarities of the Soviet situation 
lie in the kind of failure or success, in the circumstances and the ways 
in which either may come about. 
Let us first consider the most favorable possible course of 
development for a Soviet writer. His works, whether novels, plays, or 
poems, are published in editions running into hundreds of thousands, some-
times even millions of copies. They may be published first in installments 
in a literary monthly, perhaps in October (Oktyabr) or The New World (Novy 
Mir, in exceptional cases even in the pages of Pravda or The LitevEy 
Newspaper  (Literaturnaya Gazeta.) His writings are translated into the

various languages of the Soviet Union--Ukrainian, Georgian, Armenian, and 
many others. His name is known to millions of his fellow citizens; he is 
admired and revered. He may become a candidate for the annual Lenin Prize 
(which has replaced the former Stalin Prizes) and may even win one of them. 
The material rewards of such a successful writer's life match 
his fame and honor. He is paid substantial royalties (based, oddly enough, 
according to the old Russian system, on the length of his work) every time 
his work is printed, whether in a magazine, as a book, or in translation. 
He can keep almost the entire amount he is paid, for income tax in the 
Soviet Union is extremely low, seldom exceeding ten or fifteen percent. 
He is very likely to be assigned a small but comfortable apartment in Mos-
cow in one of the large apartment houses owned by the Union of Writers, where 
he pays a very low rent and has the pleasure of living in close proximity 
to numerous colleagues and friends-- or perhaps rivals. He may also 
purchase or build a dacha, a country home, again very likely in 
settlement some miles outside the capital of the republic where 
or, most likely of all in the case of an established writer, at 
the writers' colony close to Moscow, for the advantages of life 
an artists' 
he lives, 
Peredelkino, 
in the 
cspital attract an even greater percentage of Russian writers than Paris 
draws of the painters and sculptors of France. 
The successful, favored writer may be one of the few Soviet own-
ers of a private automobile. When he wishes, he may receive a putyovka 
(coupons entitling him to free or reduced rates for travel and hotel accommo-
dations) to Black Sea and other resorts. If he plans to write a novel about 
a remote section of the country, he will be supported during months of stay 
and research in the region.

Is there any drawback -- any set of conditions to be fulfilled --
if he is to enjoy this enviable mixture of honors and material rewards? 
Is anything necessary other than an unusual share of artistic talent? 
Unfortunately,a great deal. In order to climb to and remain at 
the zenith of a Soviet artistic areeer, it is necessary to stay in the 
good favors of the Union of Writers -- and of the Communist Party, whose 
instrument the Union of Writers is. One has to keep writing in a manner 
pleasing to the controlling officials. Since 1934, the one and only liter-
ary method or style permissible has been the vague and amorphous "socialistic 
realism." (Between 1928 and 1932, the slogan had been "social command," a 
somewhat clearer description of the desired attitude towards writing.) 
Socialistic realism has been described by many personar;es, ranging from 
Stalin to Gorky, --ithout ever being completely clarified. At the Second 
Writers' Congress, in December 1954, tne author Fedin complained that 
foreign Communist writers were asking for an exact definition of social-
istic realism. It is impossible to give them as simple an answer as they 
seem to want, Fedin declared. They should not "expect a recipe" which 
would read something like "Take fifty parts of positive hero, five parts of 
negative hero, one part social contradiction, one part inspired romanti-
cism, one hundred parts distilled water." The only positive, but hardly 
satisfying, suggestion he was able to supply was to study "the best works" 
of various Soviet writers and imitate them. 
A 
In actual practice socialistic realism has consisted of taking 
contemporary subjects (often specific areas of Soviet life in which the 
Party felt some change or improvement was necessary: the production of

cement, the cultivation of the "virgin lands" of Kazakhstan, or the organi-
zation of an electric engineering research institute,) and treating them 
properly. The proper manner of treatment means concentrating not on the 
individual aspects, but on the social, on the masses, on the collective; 
taking an optimistic, cheerful view of Soviet life, rather than being nega-
tive and critical; and writing in a manner intelligible to the masses, with-
out excessive attention to form -- in other words, avoiding experimentation, 
anything modernistic and smacking of the "decadent, bourgeois," and con-
centrating on a plain, "realistic," conservative, conventional method of 
narration. 
To know just what subjects, attitudes towards them, and manner of 
treatment are permissible or not permissible, encouraged or prohibited (for 
the Party line shifts here as in other areas) is one of the major and most 
delicate tasks of a Soviet artist. Some of the most prominent ones '(and 
most consistently favored ones) have been those who, like Konstantine 
Simonov or Ilya Ehrenburg, have had a keen nose and a good sense of timing 
in sensing a change of line almost before it had occurred and the docility 
to conform to what they felt was in the air. Those who either did not 
catch on or who ,were temperamentally unsuited for the task of following 
every twist of the line � Vladimir Dudintsev, Margarita Aliger, Boris 
Pasternak, and others -- have been chastised or silenced. 
If we looked only at what has happened to some unfortunate prtists 
in Soviet Russia, we might wonder why any young man or woman in Russia de-
cides to become a playwright, film director, or author -- it must take great 
blindness, gullibility, or courage. Pasternak, the whole world now knows,

has been insulted and threatened after he received the Nobel Prize for a 
novel which has never been published in Russia; others have been attacked. 
in a manner typified by the following description applied by a critic to 
the imaginative Zamyatin: "This adept at mimicry and falsification whose 
whole conception of life was culled from literary rpmi niscences and bore 
no relation whatsoever to reality, left no trace in literature and has 
been completely forgotten by the present generation of Soviet readers." 
The characters of the satirist Mikhail Zoshchenko have been 
called by the same critic, Alexander Anikst, "misshapen caricatures" and his 
work in general "a slanderous portrayal of Soviet people as primitive be-
ings with philistine tastes and manners. . . . Zoshchenko had a trades-
man's attitude towards life and wallowed in the mire of petty everyday 
affairs and could not rise to the heights required to paint an extensive 
canvas of life with a realistic picture of its typical characters and 
manifestations." Some writers, like Isaac Babel, it is now admitted in 
Soviet Russia, were arrested, sent to work camps, and even executed.

THE ARTIST IN A MONOLITHIC STATE 
BY George Gibian 
PART II 
Methods of State Control 
There are three main ways in which the Soviet Communist Party 
makes clear to the U.S.S.R.'s artists how they should write, paint, and 
compose. 
The first way is by means of general pronouncements of guiding 
principles. Congresses of writers or painters are held, at which some 
of the leaders of the particular artists' union make theoretical state-
ments; speeches are delivered by political figures (in 1957, for example, 
Khrushchev made three such speeches which were later printed and are 
still being quoted and pointed to as authoritative indications of principle); 
or authoritative articles are printed in newspapers and magazines. 
One such recent essay, by Y. Elsberg (in Kommunist, No. 12, 1958), 
is typical of these direction-setting articles. It sets down the usual 
chain of reasoning concerning Party control over the arts. The first 
premise, according to Elsberg, concerns the task of literature -- which 
is "to inspire the people towards new progress in building communism." 
The next presupposition is that it is "the policy of the Communist Party 
rwhich7 expresses the deepest interests of the people" and that "never 
before was the life of the people so full of principle, so fully intel�
lectually saturated, so aware, so many sided." The conclusion follows:

"Therefore the Soviet writer, a faithful supporter of the Party's work, 
has at his disposal an infallible compass he Part/7' which helps him 
to orient himself correctly in the complex problems of studying and 
artistically representing the nation's life." 
This rationale for compelling writers to write cheerfully, 
positively, and in full obedience to the Party is strengthened by the 
second major means of instructing them: the picking of a handful of 
deterrent examples. In the lest two or three years: the whipping boys 
have included Vladimir Dudintsev, Margarita Auger, Alexander Yashin 
(for his story "The Levers,") David Granin (for his "Convictions Of 
One's Own,") and Semyon Kirsanov -- a list recently joined and eclipsed 
by Boris Pasternak. 
The third method is to hold out as examples works which embody 
the desirable characteristics the Party wishes other artists to imitate. 
From time to time, such hallowed masterpieces are selected, praised, ana-
lyzed. Thus every artist in the country learns what he is to emulate, if 
he is to be in the good graces of the "political artists," the various 
functionaries of the unions, the aparatchiki (apparatus personnel) of the 
artistic bureaucracy. A recent example of such an officially approved 
work is Vsevolod Kochetov's The Yershov Brothers. Elsberg, in his article, 
betrays the ideological reasons for the special "honoring" treatment given 
to Kochetov's novel when he praises its hero as a "truly conscious builder 
of communism". and as a man who remained "politically vigilant during the 
months which followed the Twentieth Party Congress, when certain individ-
ual unstable elements tried to interpret the decisions of the Congress 
in a revisionistic spirit."

- 3 - 
There are four different roads open to the Soviet artist. The 
first is for him to be a sincere, fanatical Communist convinced that what-
ever the Party wants is truly for the best. Therefore he cheerfully 
follows the Party line, which most of the time coincides with his own 
opinions anyway. If it does not, he willingly sacrifices his personal or 
artistic conscience on the altar of Party discipline. Such artists are as 
few and usually as mediocre in their field as they are fortunate in being 
spared the inner conflicts of their colleagues. 
The second way is that of the majority of the most talented 
artists, who also conform to the Party's wishes, but do so grudgingly, 
regretting the price exacted of them,yet preferring to live comfortably 
and to continue working in their chosen field, with such concessions as 
are necessary. They paint uniformed Stalins or smiling tractor drivers, 
depending on the currently approved subjects, in such style as happens 
to be fashionable. On the side, in secrecy, they may paint entirely 
different subjects, in a personal manner. It was said about Gera.simov, 
the conformist patriarch and leader of Soviet painters, that his studio 
concealed scores of nudes painted in defiance of official taste, which 
he never tried to exhibit or sell. 
The third way, taken by many honest men, is silence or evasion. 
Rather than paint or write as they do not wish to, they leave the field 
of art and make their living in some other way, or turn to some politi-
cally innocuous corner within their field. Thus many writers gave up 
"formalistic" and "subjectivistic" poetry or fiction and turned to safe 
biographies or historical fiction. Pasternak devoted many years to mar-

THE ARTIST IN A MONOLITHIC STATE (Part II) - 4 
The fourth road, that taken by a small minority, is to follow 
one's artistic and civic conscience, to go against the Party dictates, 
to attempt to publish what one fears will be badly received, and then 
to defend it as long as possible. Such was the course of action of 
Margarita Aliger and others, particularly during the years 1956-57, 
when the limits of freedom were extended and blurred. Since the spring 
of 1957, the Party has been making a special effort to put the clock 
back and to show the writers that they must not exceed the bounds of the 
permissible. It was not content with damning certain objectionable works; 
it insisted on their authors' recanting and apologizing. After months of 
what even Russian writers called "the heroism of silence," most of the 
authors attacked surrendered and delivered the required apologies, by 
speech or letter. Typical of the pathetic, humiliating "confessions" is 
Margarita Aliger's: 
n. . . in my public work I committed a number of gross mistakes. 
. . . I really committed those mistakes about which Comrade 
Khrushchev speaks. I committed them, I persisted in them, but 
I understood them andlbonfessed them deliberately and con-
sciously . . . Obviously I must now be much more exacting with 
myself, rid myself of a certain speculativeness. . . " 
For art and literature to be considered such an important 
weapon as to call for constant, top level direction (Stalin called writers 
"engineers of the human soul") is, to one way of looking at it, a great 
compliment to their power and importance. Unfortunately it brings in 
its train great limitations which are far from complimentary: Party con-
trol, both positive (guidance, exhortation) and negative (reprimands, 
punishments.) The writers are the most outstanding victims, for their 
medium, words, refers most clearly and unequivocally to the realities of

THE PUZZLING POLICY OF SOCIALIST REALISM 
By Gleb Struve 
(Mr. Struve is an associate professor in the Department of Slavic 
Languages and Literature at the University of California.) 
"Socialist realism," one of the more puzzling catch phrases of 
Communist policy, might be defined as the term most frequently used to 
describe the rules which all Soviet artists -- particularly writers --
are expected to apply in their creative undertakings. 
This statement, admittedly, fails to answer such questions as 
"what, precisely, is socialist realism?" and "what is its relation to 
just plain realism?" 
Actually, as 14e shall see, it is far from easy to evolve intelli�
gent answers to questions of this sort, which may explain why the subject 
already has produced a voluminious and somewhat contradictory literature 
of its own. 
The formula khown as "socialist realism" is supposed to have been 
coined by Stalin and is said to have been first used by him at a gathering 
of Soviet writerein.0Jtober, 1932. One SoViet scholar drew attention to 
the fact that the-sarietfOrMtifti had been cited earlier in a  Literaturnaya 
Gazeta  editorial. This editorial which appeared in the issue of May 29, 
1932, noted.that."The" masses afe demanding from the Vist'sVcerity, 
truthfulness; and reolutionary'socialist realism in the depiction of the 
proletarian revolution."

The "socialist realism" formula was uidely discussed between 1932 ..and 
1934, during the preparations for the first Congress of Soviet Writers, 
which took place in August, 1934, at Moscow. By that time socialist 
realism had been accepted as the guiding principle of Soviet literature 
ard, as such, was incorporated in the charter of the newly founded Union 
of Soviet Writers. In the preamble to that charter we read that the 
creative ideas of Soviet literature, evolved under the guidance of the 
�., 
Communist Party, "have found their main expression in the principles of 
socialist realism." The charter then gives this rather vague definition: 
"Socialist realism, being the basic method of Soviet imagi-
native literature and literary criticism, demands from the art-
ist a truthful, historically concrete depiction of the reality 
in its revolutionary development. At the same time the truth-
fulness and historical concreteness of the artistic depiction 
of the reality must be combined with the task of ideological 
remolding and upbringing of the toilers in the spirit of so-
Socialist realism was also said to provide the artist an ex-
ceptional opportunity of showing his creative initiative, as well as "a 
choice of diverse forms, styles, and genres." 
Hundreds of articles were written, and numerous discussions 
held, in an attempt to lend more substance to these rather nebulous formu-
lations, as well as to define the relation between socialist realism and 
that which was, at different times and by different people, variously 
described as "classical realism," "bourgeois realism," or "critical realism." 
4 
� 
MOSCOW'S PUZZLING POLICY OF SOCIALIST REALISM - 3 - 
The stress shifted now to one, now to another element of the above defini-
tion. Much was made of the importance of depicting reality as a revolu-
tionary development, and in this was seen the main difference between 
socialist realism and the traditional "bourgeois" realism. There was also 
a great deal of toying with the formula "revolutionary romanticism," which 
was said to be a necessary ingredient of socialist realism. This latter 
association was particularly dear to the heart of Maxim Gorky, who once 
said that revolutionary-romanticism wasreelly a pseudonym for socialist 
realism. 
This identification of socialist realism with revolutionary 
romanticism was combatted, however, by some writers, critics, and scholars, 
among them Gyorgy Lukacs, a Hungarian Communist critic and literary scholar, 
himself a great admirer of Gorky, who in the 1930's lived and wrote in the 
Soviet Union and whom Herbert Read has described as "by far the most formid-
able exponent of Marxism in literary criticism." For Lukacs, who later 
returned to Hungary and played a not unimportant part in the intellectual 
fermentation which preceded that country's 1956 revolt, "revolutionary 
romanticism" signified a naturalistic degeneration of socialist realism, 
while the latter was really a logical step forward from, and an improve-
ment upon, the critical realism of the nineteenth century, the realism 
of Balzac and Tolstoy, to whose study Lukslcs devoted most of his time. 
From Lukacs's interpretation of socialist realism it would follow 
that, fundamentally, socialist realism is a legitimate offspring of the 
critical realism as expressed in the European novel of the nineteenth 
century and continued in modern times by such writers as Thomas Mann, and

that the new element or quality in it is the socialist outlOok'of its 
exponents.. Whether this justifies us in describing it as a new artistic 
method3.howevervis highly doubtful. 
, Even some Soviet scholars, critics: and writers have at times 
1.1:Used some doubts, asking themselves whether socialibt realism should not 
rather be described as a philosophy of life or world outlook (mirovozzrenie, 
Weltanschauung).- In one of the latest Soviet pronouncements on the subject, 
a paper by V. Shcherbina, this view is, however, rejected. Mentioning tfiose 
who propose to regard socialist realism either as a totality of certain 
artistic means of representation or as a world outlook, he rejects both 
thede approaches as "onesided" and insists that 'soCialist realism is an 
arrtistic method. 
In the 1930's much of the discussion about socialist realism was 
-ofe-Purely scholastic, academic, often hairsplitting, nature, though at 
timed the political essence of the whole concept would 'break through. Thus 
the critic Isaac Musinov, who was later tb- bbcome one of thevictims of 
Zhdanoir''s witch-hunting, in 1934 offered the T:ollowing formula of socialist 
realism which seemed to have little to do with art: "The main object of 
socialist realism is the struggle foe the destruction of the world of prop 
erty and the triumph of socialism." 
As time went on, this social-political aspect of socialist realism 
came more and more to the fore. This was largely the result of the fact 
that with the principle of socialist realism came to be coupled the notion 
of partiynostrr or partymindedness, lir notion which can be traced back to 
an article by Lenin, written in 1905, about the principle of party literature.

Whether Lenin had in mind party literature in the narrow sense of 
the word and the conditions then prevailing in Russian life, or was visual-
izing thea.td literature of the future, remains a moot point. At 
any rate it ao.happened that Lenin's principle of partiynost' came to br 
inseparahly,associated,with the principle of -socialist realism. To be a 
good Soviet writerr it was-no longer enough to be a socialist realist: it 
was necessary also to be "par,tyminded." The partymindedness of Soviet lit-
erature came to be particularly stressed during the so-called Zhdanov era, 
that is, after World War II. It was during this period that it became in-
creasingly clear that socialist realism in practice boiled dawn to the cur-
rent Party line. 
Both in imaginativeliterature and in literary criticism and 
scholarship,' only that was admissible which conformed to the general line 
of the Party at the givth-ribtient. Rabid anti-Westernism, assertion of 
Soviet priority in almost ekriere�field of human endeavor, and the cult of 
Stalin became the salient features of a socialist-realistic work of litera-
ture. When de-Stalinization get in and the cult of the individual was de-
nounced, the criteria of socialist, realism were revised overnight, and many 
of the literary works produced between 1946 and 1953, and regarded previous-
ly as models of socialist realism, were dismissed as idealized distortions 
of reality. 
A During the so-called "thaw" in Soviet literature, works like 
Ehrenburg's novel of that name.contained an implicit admission that social-
ist realism, as understood during the post-war period, meant an inevitable 
decline of art:. In some Communist countries outside the U.S.S.R, writers,

and artists in general, went even further: in Poland and in Hungary the 
� 
adoption of socialist realism in the early Thirties came to be regarded 
as the deathknell of all true art. The result was that Soviet critics 
and scholars were henceforth to adopt a defensive, apologetic attitude in. 
the debate about socialist realism. But the principles of socialist real-
ism and partymindedness were by no means abandoned. They were firmly re-
asserted, as the mainstays of Soviet literature and art, by Nikita 'thrush-
chev in the summer of 1957. His statements to Soviet writers and artists, 
widely publicized, were described by Soviet writers as "historic" and "pro-
grammatic", and are now looked upon as directives which must guide the 
course of Soviet literature. 
Despite the subject's fascination for communist officials, howl-
evertasatisfactory definition of socialist realism, either in theory or in 
practice, is still lacking. Since cultural coexistence has become part of 
the official policy of the Soviet government, there has been a growing 
tendency to try to reconcile socialist realism with the critical realism 
of the past (and of the present as far as non-Communist countries are con-
cerned), even though at the same time Lukacs's views are being refuted as 
Previsionism." 
Let us take two typical recent pronouncements. V. Shcherbina, 
in a paper already quoted, writes that socialist realism must not be di-
vorced from, or opposed to, critical realism, and that the cognitive and 
artistic value of much of contemporary non-Russian realistic literature 
must be fully recognized. Shcherbina is even ready to admit the existence 
in Soviet literature of currents other than socialist realism. He also 
3 
MOSCOW'S PUZZLING POLICY OF SOCIALIST REALISM - 7 
^ 
speaks disparagingly, in the wake of Lukacs, of "naturalistic pseudo-
realism." In a recent volume of studies of socialist realism, V. Ozerov 
4 
also speaks of the latter as the culmination of old realism, as its successor 
and continuator. At the same time he comes dangerously close to admitting 
the purely ideological differentia of socialist realism when he describes 
it as "a Plealisti6-7 method fertilized by the ideas of socialism," or 
sees the "newness" of Soviet art in the novelty of its representational 
material. 
At times Shcherbina and Ozerov contradict each other, once more 
demonstrating in what confusion the whole subject is still wrapped. Thus, 
while Shcherbina insists that it is a fallacy to speak of the demands that 
socialist realism places on the artist, Ozerov writes that, instead of a 
long enumeration of various "characteristics" of socialist realism, it 
would be better to mention "the main demands which it makes upon writers, 
and in the first place the demand for truth, revealed and interpreted in 
the light of the socialist ideal and of the Communist partymindedness." 
What "partymindedness" in art is, no one has as yet explained 
satisfactorily. 
The elastic, adjustable nature of socialist realism as understood 
by Soviet literary lawgivers is best illustrated in the statements recently 
made by Mikhail Sholokhov, the celebrated author of And Quiet Flows the Don. 
4 Last April Sholokhov spent a few days in Prague, where he was received and 
interviewed at the Union of Czechoslovak Writers. The interview was pub-
lished in Literary News, the official weekly of the Writers' union.

-' To the first question -- "What he thought of socialist realism?" --
Sholokhov replied as follows: 
"Theory is not my forte. I am just a writer. But I shall 
tell you a little story. Not long before his death, I met my 
friend Alexander Fadeyev. I asked him the same question. I 
asked him what would he answer if he were asked a-straightfor-
ward question about the meaning of socialist realism. He said: 
"If someone were to ask me this, to the best of my knowledge 
I would have to reply: 'Devil knows what it really is.' Maybe 
Fadeyev was joking. If I were to answer for myself I would say 
that, to my mind, socialist realism is that which is in favor of 
the Soviet regime and is written in a simple, comprehensible, 
artistic language. This is not a theoretical assumption, but 
the experience of an author. The theoreticians are there to 
prop it up with their scaffolding and to drive in theoretical 
wedges." 
Sholokhov's reference to Fadeyev, who had always been one of the 
staunchest supporters of the Party line in literature and was regarded as 
-one of the meat thorough exponents of socialist realism at its best, and 
who committed suicide a few mogths after the debunking of Stalin, is highly 
significant. His own crudely simplified definition of socialist realism 
has an almost mocking ring. But even more irreverent was Sholokhov's 
answer to the next question. Asked whether he considered his own works as 
representative of socialist realism, Sholokhov replied: 
� 
. q' � - = � .1.,`,-",Cr 
STAT 
MOSCOW'S PUZZLING POLICY OF SOCIALIST REALISM - 9 
'When you ask me this question I recall that at first my 
works were proclaimed by Marxist theoreticians to be those of 
a kulak writer; later, I became for them a 'counter-revolu-
ionary' writer; while in recent years it has always been said 
that I have been a socialist realist all my life." 
It would be difficult to describe more succinctly the elastic-
ity of this famous formula. It is significant that while this interview 
of Czech writers with Sholokhov was reprinted in the official Polish 
Communist paper (Trybuna Ludu), not a word of it was breathed in the Soviet 
press. Soviet critics, on the other hand, are fond of quoting the state-
ment which Sholokhov made in his speech at the Second Congress of Soviet 
Writers in 1954, when he said: "...our enemies abroad say that we write 
at the dictate of the Party. Things are somewhat different; each one of 
us writes at the dictate of his heart, but our hearts belong to the Party 
and to our people whom we serve by our art." 
One may only guess at the degree of conviction in Sholok-
hov's remark.

"Our people need works of literature, art and music whioh 
reflect the glory of labor... The me-ehod of socialist realism insures 
unlimited possibilities for the creation of such works." 
Khrushchev was particularly frank in outlining the role of news-
papers and magazines in a Communist society. "We cannot let the press 
organs fall into unreliable lands," he asserted. "They must be in the 
hands of the workers that are the most loyal, most reliable, most staunch 
politically, and most devoted to our cause." 
The Chinese communist leader Mao Tse-tung has stressed that 
"art for art's sake, art which transcends class or party, art which stands 
as a bystander to, or independent of, politics" cannot be allowed to exist. 
"When we say literature and art follow politics," he added, "we 
mean class politics." 
President Kuo Mo-jo of the Chinese (Communist) Academy of Sciences, 
pointed out in 1958 that "literary style... mainly involves ideology and 
the ideological method." 
Chou Yang, vice chairman of the Chinese Communist party's 
central propaganda department, recently endorsed the Soviet line that 
literature is primarily an ideological weapon when he said: "Under the 
leadership of the Communist party, Chinese literature has always regarded 
socialist realism as the most correct principle of creation, and looked 
upon Soviet works as models." 
Communist newspapers and theoretical journals have been even 
more pointed in their cultural ediats.

POST-STALIN LITERARY "THNU" ENDS WITH NEW CONTROLS 
By Vera Alexandrova 
(Vera Alexandrova, formerly editor-in-chief of the 
Chekhov Publishing House in New York, is recognized 
as an authority on the USSR's literary history.) 
The Boris Pasternak case probably has done more than anything 
else since the death of Stalin to dramatize and clarify the Communist 
Party's position on cultural matters. 
. This elderly Soviet poet and novelist, a symbol of stalwart 
individualism in the midst of censorship alla regimentation, captured the 
world's admiration and sympathy to a degree few writers have experienced. 
Pasternak's 1958 ordeal, however,*as this review will show, 
was merely the culmination of a chain of circumstances which began some 
four years before. 
In March, 1954, a year after Stalin's death, the Soviet magazine 
Znamya published a novel entitled The Thaw. This book by Ilya Ehrenlqurg 
was to become a rallying point for those ,seeking relief from the Communist 
Party's program of making Soviet literature a propaganda tool. 
"ThawM thus rapidly became a popplar byword and was applied to 
the brief post-Stalin period of relaxed .party pressure on literature 
during which the pent-up need of Soviet writers for greater creative free-
dom unmistakably began to break through to the surface.

POST-STALIN LITERARY "THAW" ENDS WITH NEW CONTROLS 
2 
However, by the end of .the year, the Communist Party had suc-
ceeded in strengthening its control and partially restoring its shaken 
cultural authority. This was the atmosphere in which the Second All-
Union Writers Congress was held in December 1954. A faint breath of free-
dom still persisted in the literary air. 
A new "thaw" began after Khrushchev's speech at the closed session 
of the 20th Communist Party Congress in February, 1956, with its shocking. 
exposure of Stalin's crimes. This second "thaw," which lasted more tfhan 
a year, was halted by the direct intervention of Khrushchev himself, who 
arranged two conferences with writers, artists and composers in May, 1957, 
and followed these up with a speech on the tasks Of literature and art at 
a meeting of leading Communist Party workers.' The three Khrushchev talks 
were reworked into a long article, "For Close Ties Between Art and Litera-
ture and the Life of the People," which first appeared in the magazine 
Kommunist in August, 1957, and was later reprinted in all literary journals 
throughout the Soviet Union. 
Khrushchev's statements were built upon a single idea: the will 
of the Communist Party is the genuine expression of the will of the people; 
hence the "party spirit" in literature, that is, absolute adherence by 
writers to the party's directives, is the only expression of their true 
loyalty to the people. Any show of independence by a writer is an expres-
sion of a hostile attitude toward the people. This decree, which was soon 
proclaimed to be a "party document," became Moscow's mandatory credo for 
all Soviet writers. A new literary freeze had begun. 
_ 
POST-STALIN LITERARY "THAW" ENDS WITH NEW CONTROLS - 3 
During the second literary "thaws" which had preceded the 1957 
edict by Khrushchev, there appeared an inspired novel by the young writer 
Vladimir Dudintsev, Not By Bread Alone. This work was serialized in the 
magazine Novy Mir,in August, September and October, 1956. 
Dudintsev's novel depicts the struggle of the talented "indi-
vidualist" inventor Lopatkin, who designs a machine that is to simplify 
production methods and cut costs in the manufacture of metal pipes, against 
the inertia and bureaucracy of the Communist industrial administration. 
"No matter how hungry I might be," says Lopatkin, at one point, "I would 
always exchange my bread for a spark of faith." And because Lopatkin; does 
not surrender, he acquires devoted friends and emerges a victor from the 
unequal struggle. 
Both the general reader and other writers welcomed Dudintsevis 
novel with great enthusiasm. A meeting held at the Central Writers' Club 
in Moscow at the end of October, 1956, to discuss the novel was filled 
to overflowing. All the speakers were unanimous in their praise. 
Only one month later, however, people cautiously began to dis-
sociate themselves from Dudintsev, who was now accused by the party of 
"bias in favor of individualism" and "inability to realize and appreciate 
the strength of the collective" (Literary Gazette, November 24; Izvestia, 
December 2, 1956). At the March, 1957, plenum of the Executive Committee 
of the Writers' Union there was no longer any trace of the initially 
favorable response to Not By Bread Alone. 
In a later comment, Dudintsev described the plight of Soviet

POST,STALIN LITERARY "THAW" SENDS WITH NEW CONTROLS - 4 - 
In 1958 Vsevolod Kochetov 14rote a novel, "The Yershov Brothers" 
(published in the magazine Veva-, June-July, 1958),-which was conceived 
as a kind of anti-Dudintsev production, and is todayrecognized_ as such. 
It is centered around an ideal family of hereditary proletarians, the 
Yershov brothers, and bristles with political tirades in the spirit of 
Khrushchev's "party document." 
Kochetovis novel, as might be expected$won the highest praise 
of the literary authorities. Kammunist (Simplot, 1958) characterized it 
as an "'acute and timely' book honoring the image of a truly conscious 
builder of Communism." A further accolade to Kochetov by Izvestia (on 
October 2, 1958), described his book as a "party novel" -- the highest 
term of Communist praise. 
In the light of the party's response to these two novels, it 
becomes clear why the epic work of Boris Pasternak, Doctor Zhivago, could 
not appear in the Soviet Union. Dr. Zhivago is permeated by feelings 
which the Communist Party and its literary censors .have been trying for 
decades to destroy or at least to suppress. Foremost among these feelings 
is hunger for freedom and a sense, of maes dignity and independence. 
These ideas pervade the entire book. 
"The main misfortune, the root of all the evil to came," says 
Dr. Zhivago, "vas the loss of confidence in the value of one's own opinion. 
People imagined that it was out of date to follow their own moral sense, 
that they must all sing in chorus, and live by other people's notions, 
notions that were being crammed down everybody's throat." 
POST-STALIN LiTbRARY "THAW" ENDS WITH NEW CONTROLS - 5 
But these thoughts do not lead Pasternak and his heroes to 
pessimism and despair. The novel ends on this note of hope: 
"Although victory has not brought the relief and freedom that 
were expected at the end of the war, nevertheless the portents of freedom 
filled the air throughout the postwar period, and they alone defined its 
historical significance."

COMMUNISM'S SINGLE STANDARD FOR LITERATURE AND THE ARTS 
By Arturo Valente 
Part I 
Leji 
Most scholars looking for an explanation of modern Communism's 
rather exacting requirements for writers and other creative artists sooner 
or later find themselves engaged in a study of the 1917 Bolshevik revolu-
tioi4L 
It is in this eventful period of Communist development, one 
quickly realizes, that the party's present attitude toward the expression 
of divergent viewpoints began to take definite form. 
ParadoxicOly, the first official actions of Lenin and his asso-
ciates upon gaining control of the Russian government on, November 7, 1917 
were to deny to others the opportunities for self-expression which had 
made their own revolutionary movement possible. Although Marx, Engels and 
Lenin had depended to a great extent on books, pamphlets and articles to 
spread their own theories, one of Lenin's first moves after seizing power 
was to stop the publication of all newspapers and periodicals not committed 
to Bolshevism. Proposals that the new Russian government include repre-
sentatives of other political groups were quickly rejected and it was not 
long before the freely elected Constituent Assembly was forcibly disbanded 
for refusing to accept the Bolsheviks' insistence on absolute control.

COMMUNISM'S SINGLE STANDARD FOR LITERATURE AND THE AR2S (Part I) -2-
From this rather abrupt and prophetic beginning has come the 
monolithic Commmisit party as it is known today. 
Shrewdly and inexorably, Lenin and his successors have applied 
the principles of centralized power to every aspect of Soviet life, seek-
ing at all times to create the image of an all-wise party leadership which 
can do no wrong and which therefore demands unhesitating loyalty from each 
of its subjects. In actual practice, the concept of Communist reality im-
plies far more than mere obedience; the citizens of a Communist state are 
expected to concentrate their entire beings on the building of Communism 
as blueprinted by the party. 
Writers, painters and composers who accept these conditions with-
out question, and have skill in their crafts, are handsomely rewarded. They 
are provided with country homes, good incomes and the privileges of travel. 
Authors, for example, have the Soviet writer's union to supervise their 
affairs and make sure that whatever they write is in keeping with party 
,policies and objectives. The outward benefits of conformity are demon-
strably attractive. 
Conversely, any artist ghose vision is broader than the party's 
is on dangerous ground the instant he gives first priority to his own per-
sonal reactions to the world around him. Anything resembling what the 
party calls a revisionist tendency is quickly spotted, as in the case of 
Boris Pasternak's Dr. zwatlea, and the artist finds his work branded as 
unfit for Communist audiences. If the writer or other creative worke4 
COMMUNISM'S SINGLE STANDARD FOR LITERATURE AND THE ARTS (Part I) -3-
again as in the case of Pasternak, is not sufficiently amenable, he is ex-
pelled from his union and faces the uncertain future of all non-conformists 
in a conformist society. 
Soviet officials, from Lenin to Kbrushchev, have made no secret 
of their position on the intellectual's role under Communism. "The high-
est social purpose of literature and the arts," says Khrushchev, " is to 
arouse the people to a struggle for new successes in the building of Com-
munism." Lenin's edict that "literature must become a component part of 
organized, planned, unified party work" was strikingly similar. 
In other words, as the Soviet intelligmtsia is constantly re-
minded by party newspapers, magazines, central committee proclamations 
and other policy outlets, the artist's work is only useful to the extent 
that it fits the desired ideological grooves. 
Critical observations, satire and other thoughtful ventures cal-
culated t6 stimulate the people's curiosity as to whether Communism is 
indeed the best of all possible solutions to life's problems are, of 
course, forbidden. Those who even skirt such questions are risking con-
demnation as revisionicts, dogmatists, formalists or worse. 
This intellectrAlly cloying aspect of Communist life, it is 
commonly believed, has been the greatest single deterrent to the creation 
of a meaningful body of literature in the Soviet Union, Commnnist China 
and the satellite countries of Eastern Europe. 
Since the ideological content of music and painting is relative-
ly nebulous, it is writers as a class who feel most keenly the pinch of

party discipline, the never-ending political surveillance of their activi-
ties. This is undoubtedly what Vladimir Dudintsev, the troubled author of 
Not By Bread Alon2, meant when he maid: "Alas, I constantly.feel that I 
am on a leash. . .such as those sometimes used for guiding infants." This, 
it might be added, is by no means an unusual reaction for writers in Com-
munist states. Far across the Eurasian continent, the Chinese editor Chin 
Chao-yang is on record with the observation that today's writers in his 
country "are apprehensive, ill at ease and always cautious, lest someone 
grab them from behind." 
One typical solution to the Communist-controlled intellectnplq: 
dilemma has been to follow the party's orders in public but to do the work 
that rePlly interests them in secret. 
As the noted Soviet affairs commentator Edward Crankshaw wrote 
recently: "Today there are painters (in the Soviet Union) whose rooms are 
stacked with the products of their imagination, their visual curiomity, 
their preoccupation with western developments of the past hundred years. 
It is the same with the novelists, the playwrights and the poets. In-
numerable manuscripts lie hidden in desks and are never taken out except 
to be read to small groups of friends." 
In any event, it has became fairly obvious that great works of 
art 'cannot be prOduced to meet rigidly prescribed formulas'. It is. only 
logical, therefore, that modern Soviet fiction abounds in stereotyped, 
r-
wooden characters and that -many readers turn, in despair, to the older 
P 
Russian-classics. Even the party is dissatisfied with "the inage of the

new Soviet man" as various writers, to the best of their ability, have 
managed to portray him. The single-minded, ideologically pure builder of 
Communism, as party officials seem to want fictional heroes to be charac-
terized, just doesn't seem real -- even on paper. 
A similar deadness has been noted in the "people's art" of Com-
munist China, North Vietnam and the more repressed countries of Eastern 
Europe. 
Communist officials, moreover, seem exceedingly fearful of the 
personal liberties necessary to correct this situation. The upsurge in 
literary activity which preceded the 1956 Hungarian revolt, the somewhat 
radical trends which developed in the Soviet Union during the post-Stalin 
"thaw," and the outspoken criticism which erupted in Communist China at 
the time of Mao Tse-tung's brief "hundred flowers" experiment still serve 
as ominous object lessons to the party's disciplinarians. 
In simpler terms, it appears that Communism's own leaders have 
accepted as proven fact that their doctrine and way of life cannot with-
stand the unrestricted probing of independent minds.

"Few Of Our Young Peo le Are Becoming Writers" 
The Soviet Communist Party's monolithic stand against any-
thing resembling an objective literary examination of the nature and 
results of its rule, as demonstrated recently by the suppression of 
Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago, raises a number of questions about the 
future course of literature in all Communist-dominated societies. 
These questions, which presumably aptly equally to the vari-
ous regimes which have acknowledged Moscow's self-appointed i.ole as 
ideological leader of the Communist bloc, deal with the most basic 
concepts of human thought, expression and social development. 
Can a vibrant, meaningful culture, for example, be built up-, 
on a foundation of censorship and the imposition of arbitrary literary 
and artistic rules? 
Party spokesmen, judging from their periodic decrees and ex-
hortations, appear to think that it can. They are, at least, obligated 
to a defense of this viewpoint, in mlich the same way that writers are 
obliged to follow their advice if they expect their works to be approired 
fdi 'publication.

Those taking the opposite viewpoint feel rather strongly 
that no intellectual culture of any permanent value can come from the 
maze of restrictions which confront the creative artist living under a 
system which requires him to-be, first of all, a propagandist for the 
party's political program. Critics of the Communist method point to 
the writer's historic role of social catalyst, in helping to shape 
man's understanding of his environment, as a prime example of the need 
to let the creative artist speak from his own mind, heart and experience. 
The cultural future looks dark indeed, these critics say, if the crea-
tive arts are to become only a supporting chorus for the politicians in 
power. 
Most readers, by now, are familiar with the Communist party's 
tendency to regard the thinking man with distrust. They have noted 
the official Soviet line that advocacy of any theory or viewpoint not 
sanctioned by party councils constitutes revisionism and therefore be. 
comes punishable as a crime against the party. This formula, they have 
observed, seems to apply In all areas under Commtnist rule� Mainland 
China, North Vietnam, the Soviet Union and the satellite countries of 
Eastern Europe. 
The line of demarcation between party approval and disapproval, 
to compound the average writer's dilemma, is not always easy to antici-
pate. Vladimir Dudintsev, for example, was condemned for his provocative 
attack on Communist bureaucracy in  Not By Bread Alone, even though Premier 
and Party Chief Kbrushchev himself took a remarkably similar stand in his

1957 demand for a reorganization of Soviet industry. Even writers like 
Ilya Ehrenburg, who ucually- manage to conform satisfe.ctorily, seem to 
harbor an inner resentment because they must do so. In any event, schol-
ars say Ehrenburg made some devastating points against the Soviet system 
in his 1957 article, Lessons of Stendhal, under the cover of e rathPr 
skillful symbolic association of certain Stendhal quotations Lith the 
conditions. of today. 
Soviet attempts to influence the course of literature ere by 
no means confined to the areas Moscow now controls. Soviet sponsor-
ship of such affairs as the Tashkent conference strongly indicates a de-
sire to internationalize the concept of literature as propaganda. This 
1958 meeting, ostensibly a forum for mutual discussion between the writers 
of Africa and Asia, was held, in the Soviet city of Tashkent. 
"The conference," according to a delegate from India, the liter-
ary critic and scholar Durga Bhagvat, "was just an elaborate technique,to 
exploit persons from the academic class for the propagation of a partic-
ular political philosophy." 
"The author," Miss Bhagvat wrote after returning to India, "was 
valued but not the person. His writings were regarded as important, but 
there was no attempt at any critical appreciation of his writings. The 
various forms of literature were important, but the contents must alweys 
be the usual propaganda stuff. The conference was concerned with vara)us 
forms of writing more from the point of view of their utility than the 
basic aspect of creativeness of literature."

The Communist cultural trend, as Miss Bhagvat has indicated, 
is apparent. Both on the national and international fronts, "party.... 
mindedness" is the first requisite for the hopeful Communist writer, 
painter or composer. 
It is interesting, however, to note that the manuscript of the 
Soviet-banned international best-selling novel, 2.1..12.1timm, has become 
a popular black-market item in the USSR. This would seem to indicate that 
the reading public in the so-called "first country of Communism" is by no 
means entirely satisfied with the voluminous party-approved literature 
now in circulation. 
What, then, is the real future of Communist literature? 
One of the speakers at the 1958 Soviet Communist youth congress 
may have provided the answer in a single sentence. 
Ilide cannot help but feel disturbed," Secretary S. Pavlov of 
the Moscow city committee said, "by the fact that very few of our young 
people are taking up the'profession of writing."

"To Tell About The Future Is Not An Easy Task" 
11.0.11�1411.mmi����..  
Shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution brought Communism 
to Russia, a Soviet writer named Yevgeni Zamyatin produced a book about 
life in the far-off future -- a time when the entire world was ruled by 
a single power. 
Zamyatin's novel, We, was centered around the love story of a 
dedicated space scientist and a girl who had become a rebel against the 
all-pervading, oppressive nature of "the single state." The scientist, 
to simplify the story, finally rejects his sweetheart and removes all 
possibility of future temptation by undergoing a brain operation which 
renders him mentally incapable of rebellious thoughts. 
The implications of Zamyatin's visionary masterpiece, which is 
supposed to have influenced the writing of George Orwell's satirical 
classic, 1984, were apparently considered too provocative for Soviet 
audiences. At any rate, recent reports say the book is no longer obtain-
able in the USSR. 
Modern writers of Communist science fiction, however, have been 
given formulas far less likely to create ideological doubts in the minds 
of their readers. The recommended approach, it will be seen, is closely 
linked to the party's general attitude concerning all matter&lof potential

influence on popular thinking. For this reason, although "future" fiction 
is not usually included in serious literary studies, the subject merits 
further examination. 
EY way of illustration, here are condensed plot summaries of 
four recent Soviet offerings: 
1. Aelita, by Alexei N. Tolstoy. A Soviet expedition lands on 
Mars and helps the Martian proletarians defeat their "capitalist" oppressors. 
2. Menni, the Engineer, by A. Bogdanov. This is an account of 
early Martian history, when the people were suppressed by'" capitalists." 
Mbnni comes to recognize the "evils" of capitalism, but it is his son, 
Netti, who does the most to advance Communist principles on the planet. 
3. The Planetary Guest, by G. Martinov. A space ship from a 
remote planet lands on earth, its passengers revealing that their ancestors 
conquered the problems of space long ago -- primarily because they had 
adopted Communist methods. 
4. Engineer Garin's Hyperboloid, by Alexei Tolstoy. This story 
about a mad scientist's plan to conquer-the world with his "death ray" 
employs a typical Soviet "cold-war" theme. The evil scientist is sponsored 
by American capitalists but iS finally defeated by a Communist. 
These stories, apart from their obvious straining for -broad 
propaganda effects, suggest other and more interesting aspects of the 
writer's problems in a Communist society. 
In dealing with the future, especially, Communist writers are 
faced with almost insurmountable obstacles -- for their books andstories 
cannot, under any circumstances, presume to predict the course of party 
policy.

As the New York Timest specialist on Soviet affairs, Harry

STAT 
Schwartz, pointed out recently, Soviet fiction is notable for its "reluc-
tance to speeulate on what life actually would be like under a future 
'Comtunist utopia." 
"Even the dullest Soviet author," Schwartz noted, "is aware of 
the dangers of such fantasies. Communism is nominally the goal of all 
Soviet striving and its supposed future benefits are the justification for 
the many sacrifices that were and are now required of Soviet citizens. Yet 
the official picture of just what Communism will be like is exceedingly 
vague." 
Therefore, Schwartz concluded, any Soviet writer who presumed 
to speculate in detail about the USSR's future "would be running grave 
political risks. 
Only someone of Nikita S. Khrushchev's stature may today 
dare to talk on this topic." 
Knowing this, the USSR's science fiction writers, in particular, 
are faced with a task of formidable proportions. They must write popular 
pieces about the future, giving Communism the credit for all possible 
achievements but avoiding any speculation as to what political shapes their 
system will assume. 
Even the official Soviet newspaper Izvestial in the course of a 
recent demand for more and better Communist fiction, was forced to admit 
that "to tell about the future is not an easy task." 
Izvestia might have added that it is equally difficult for Soviet 
writers to produce satisfactory works about the present. The Moscow

(Mr. Grilli is music critic for the Japan Times of Tokyo) 
Music, because it is an art form which defies measurement by 
the same sort of ideological yardstick used to assess the work of writers, 
has long been a problem for Communist cultural censors. 
The difficulties these doctrinal experts encounter in drafting 
a Usafe" line for authors, for example: are compounded to a formidable 
degree when they attempt to spell out the party's regulations for com-
posers. Words, it becomes obvious, are vastly' easier to regulate than 
the subtler messages which may be contained in symphonies, sonatas or 
0 I 
concertos. 
Nevertheless, since the Communist party requires that -ell  
artistic expression be monitored: controlled and disciplined, no excep-
tion can be made for music. 
These introductory remarks may help to explain the confusion 
which attended promulgation of a significant 1958 Moscow decree which 
purports to 'contain the latest party line for musicians. Although 
approved by the party's ruling central committee on May 28, the new 
regulations proved to be so complicated that it was not until June 8 
that Pravda (the party's principal press organ) was able to publish them; 
along with an attempted clarification.

The interval of two weeks was needed for the preparation of "an 
overall and profound analysis" and for developing the theses of musical 
development according to the new prouncement -- a task assigned to Pavel 
Satyukov, the editor of Pravda. This document, that was to clarify ob-
scurities and reconcile the irreconcilable, turned out to be as voluminous 
and riddled with contradictions as such official dicta are wont to be. In 
order to find whatever meanings might be hidden in the directive -- appar-
ently part of the general reversals of Stalinist policies instituted by 
Premier Khrushchev -- one has to reexamine the zig-zag track of Soviet 
musical esthetics and the governing Communist policy of "socialist realism." 
The one consistent Soviet cultural policy throughout the years 
has been enforced subservience of music and the other arts to the practical 
problems of revolutionary development. Such atie-up of art and politics 
has been a standard practice in many totalitarian countries, so the Soviet 
Union was hardly original in formulating its needs for a kind of "politically 
suitable" music. 
Since the mid-1930's the Soviet Communist Party has been sending 
out a stream of directives intended to maintain its concepts of the ideolo-
gical significance of music. Through disciplinary action and heavy penalties 
the USSR's leading composers have been repeatedly Dulled back from "devia-
tionise through subjective expression or stylistic connection with modern 
movements in the West. Instead, Soviet composers have been ordered to work 
with themes of social significance which would also be immediately compre-
hensible to a wide audience. In the case of Prokofiev, Shostakovich and

Khachaturian, to mention three composers whose works are most performed 
and admired abroad the accusations of "deviationism" from the "true 
esthetic principles of Soviet art" have been recurrent and vociferous. 
Each time the necessary genuflections and expiations had to be performed 
before the artist could resume his work. (The case of Prokofiev may be 
excepted; in many ways his was an unusual case. Less manageable than 
either of his two confreres, he was certainly a more independent spirit. 
For a time he continued to write as he pleased under the cover of an 
occasional "Ode to Stalin" or a "Peace Oratorio," which contained a 
sufficient number of party-line allusions to make the music acceptable). 
The great musical "purge" of 1948 involved eight top composers, 
including Nikolai Miaskovsky (who died in 1950)) Prokofiev, Shostakovich, 
and Khachaturian. A prominent Soviet critic recently ranked these four 
composers as "the great masters of Russian music in the Soviet period."

But in 1948 they were confronted by Alexander Zhdanov, then the chief 
Soviet cultural inquisitor. The immediate spark that set off Moscow's 
attack at that time was an opera entitled The Great Friendship, by a 
minor Georgian composer, Vanno Muradelli. This work, dealing with Stalin's 
years of friendship with Lenin, had obviously been intended as a noble 
tribute, but the touchy subject managed to offend Communist Party leaders 
at a "closed" performance in Moscow in November 1947. 
The decree that followed on February 10, 1948, however, was 
directed at a far wider field. "Formalise was the key word and its many

of employing the advances in musical style developed by such "decadent"

hemorrhage at the age of 61 in March, 1953, a week after Stalin's passing. 
(Prokofiev's last formal work, it might be noted, was a Sinfonia  
Concertante which is merely a rehash ofaprevious cello concerto written 
twenty years earlier.) 
Two important points now emerge from the new decree and the 
voluminous commentary published in Pravda on June 8, 1958: (1) the 
decree admits that Muradelli's opera, The Great Friendship, which had 
occasioned the previous decree of 1948, really did not deserve the label 
of "formalism in music," and (2) that it had been wrong to describe such 
composers as Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Khachaturian as "representatives 
of anti-popular formalistic trends." Also admitted to have been "un-
justifiably severe" were past denunciations of a number of other dis-
tinguished composers and of two additional operas of 1951, namely, 
Konstantin Dankevich's Bogdan Khmelnitskyl based on the history of the 
17th-century Ukrainian people's war of liberation, and German Leontievich 
Zhukovsky's Ot vsevo serdtsa ("From the Bottom of the Heart"), whose plot 
MUSICAL CENSORSHIP POSES PROBLEMS FOR COMMUNIST OkiliCIALS 5 
was drawn from a novel by Maltsev. Stalin had become the scapegoat, and 
the Party's previous musical line was ascribed to the fallen dictator's 
"subjective approach" and to the "negative influence" exerted by such 
"anti-Party" traitors as Molotov, Malenkov, and Beria. 
So far, so good. The very next day, on June 9, 1958: messages 
from Soviet musical personalities endorsing and praising the new party 
ruling began to appear in the columns of Pravda. It was recalled that 
many composers who had suffered under Zhdanov's cultural dictatorship had 
later been awarded prizes and had their compositions performed after 
Stalin's death. One of these messages, from the veteran Yuri Shaporin, 
composer of the monumental opera, The Decembrists (begun in 1925 and not 
completed until some thirty years later) spoke eloquently of "the direct-
ness and high-principled attitude" of the party's decision, which, in the 
words of Shaporin, had "exposed the mistaken evaluations of musical works 
� which were formed under the conditions of the personality cult." 
Prokofiev had once described some of his musical colleagues as 
"babes in arms", and evidently Soviet composers again are naively reading 
into the new decree what they wishfully hope to see there. For example, 
Shostakovich was on hand to welcome the new pronouncement -- "a yard-
stiCk of national interest," he called it euphemistically, against which 
artists could measure their advances in creative work. On the general 
subject of party prepared yardsticks, Shostakovich had previously 
clarified his views in Pravda on March 27, 1957/ when he wrote: "I 
consider this a great benefit and a great advantage for the artist because

it saves him from the self-delusion of individualism and the risk of 
straying off to the byways that lead to decadence: turgidity, and hack 
work...." Such a statement on the part of the leading Soviet composer 
is all the more revealing since it came at a time when Shostakovich was 
preparing for the premiere of his Eleventh Symphony: a musical re-evocation 
of episcodes of the abortive Russian revolt of 1905: an overly long work 
whose main features are its fanfares, populnr march tunes, and patent 
cliches. 
Also indicative was a Radio Moscow broadcast in August of 1958 
reporting that Shostakovich had turned to musical comedy in an effort to 
attune his creativeness to the new artistic experiments encouraged by the 
Khrushchev regime. Like the revised view of Jazz, this appeared to be a 
consequence of the official tendency to woo the rank-and-file of Soviet 
aficionados of musical stage works away from the Italian and French 
operatic repertoire, which remains extremely popular throughout the U.S.S.R. 
For it must be admitted that, in spite of strenuous efforts on the part of 
the directors of Soviet opera houses to popularize modern native works, 
few of the operas produced by contemporary Soviet composers have managed 
to win a permanent place in opera-goers' hearts. As a matter of fact, 
repeated appeals have been made to win official Communist approval for 
some relaxation of rigid party ukases and party sanction for policies 
more in favor of bolder attempts by composers, librettists, and producers 
to find new forms. This was tacitly conceded in the June 8 Pravda editorial 
which not only called for more and better operas on contemporary subjects, 
t?' 
MUSICAL CENSORSHIP POSES PROBLEMS FOR COMMUNIST Ok.DICIALS 7 
but also for a greater tolerance on the part of critics towards composers 
searching for new formal solutions. 
Such developments would also seem to be all to the good. But 
the verbatim translation of the new party-approved dictum is far less 
ebullient than the journalistic commentaries. For example, there is an 
explicit acknowledgment that the -previous 1948 resolution had correctly 
related the task for the development of music to the concept of socialist 
realism and had properly condemned formalistic tendencies in music. A 
network of linguistic contradictions allows loopholes that make previous 
criticism seem to be in error, but nevertheless still upholds the "important 
party rulings" and the "important party documents" in which the original 
criticism appeared. Finally, the demands of composers, musicians, and 
producers for freedom from party restrictions and discipline are 
peremptorily rejected. 
� 
Pravda itself has admitted that the danger of "unhealthy and 
alien" musical phenomena and "incorrect tendencies" still exists. The 
party newspaper also points out an inclination to "false originality," 
an enthusiasm among young composers for formal experimenting "without a 
healthy and realistic ground," and the existence of Uncritical attitudes 
towards "decadent modern art." All these are condemned without mincing 
words. 
What, then, is the concrete and factual residue left after the 
verbiage is sifted from the 1958 decree? There is a pretense at legalizing 
the rehabilitation of previously censured composers. A few freedoms which

the composers had been winning for themselves were also grudgingly conceded. 
But there is no evidence of relaxation of discipline imposed on music as 
a utilitarian tool in a political organization. The extent to which com-
posers may benefit by the breakthrough achieved after Stalin's death is 
very strictly delimited. No Soviet composer who wishes a measure of 
material success can afford to ignore these boundaries.

PASTERNAK'S FELLOW AUTHORS SPEAK THEIR NUNDS 
By Henry V. Burke 
When Soviet actions in the Boris Pasternak affair reached an 
ideological point of no return in late October of 1958, it was not sur-
prising that authors in other counties were among the first to voice 
their opinions. 
The situation in which the famed Soviet poet and novelist sud-
denly found himself -- the recipient of -increasing praise throughout the 
non-Communist literary world but faced with rapidly mounting pressure in 
his own -country -- quite naturally had a special kind of impact on those 
individuals who, in one form of another, felt themselves to be Pasternak's 
spiritual colleagues. 
Who better than another writer could sense the full import of 
, 
Pasternak' -personal ordeal? The whole Pasternak episode was, after all, 
the most dramatic kind of revelation of what any artist faces if he happens 
to live in a society which -regards all manifestations of the creative , 
imagination as potentially dangerous. 
In this context, the fact that authors living in the Soviet. .Union 
either kept silent or joined in the Communist attacksyon Pasternak gives 
added significance to the words and actions of those other writers who 
were in a better position to comment as individuals.

Sharp criticism of the Soviet campaign against Pasternak also 
came from authors and academicians in Latin America. Among ,the first to 
protest was the Brazilian novelist and,poet_Jorge Amado, himself a former 
winner of the Stalin prize. Amado asserted that "Pasternak's expulsion 
from the Union of Soviet Wrtiers demonstrates that schematic, sectarian 
and dogmatic elements still dominate in the Soviet ..Union, trying to impede 
literary creation and to impose a.single school of thought, just as, in 
the Stalin era." .The Brazilian Association for Treedom of Culture declared, 
in a particularly forthright statement that "any attempt to prevent an

From these randomly selected examples of world literary reaction, 
it is apparent that the Soviet campaign against Pasternak for presuming 
to write objectively of life in the USSR was uniformly regarded as an 
official repudiation. of the artist's inherent right to express himself. 
Any attempt to seek out the real reason for the Soviet Union's 
official attitude, however, must go beyond the overt political campaign 
conducted against Pasternak and those who honored him with the Nobel award. 
One must first examine the original Soviet decision to ban Pasternak's 
novel, "Dr. Zhivago," and then consider the strenuous efforts made to prevent 
its appearance in other countries. 
Soviet literary censors, in rejecting the manuscript of "Dr. Zhivago" 
when it was first submitted for publication in the USSR, put their objec�
tions into a surprisingly simple, frank and revealing statement. 
"The thing that disturbed us about your novel," 
Pasternak, "is something that neither the editors nor the

they wrote to

its general tenor, 
the author's point of view...The spirit of your novel is that of non�

DR. ZHIVAGO "HAS NO INTEREST FOR US" 
By Arturo Valente 
As anticipated) one of the questions raised by newsmen during 
Soviet Deputy Premier Aaastas Makoyan's early 1959 visit to the United 
.States concerned Boris Pasternakts much-discussed novel: Dr. Zhivago. 
Makoyants ansver, when asked if this world-famous book would 
ever be published in the USSR, was simplicity itself. "It has no interest 
for us," the Soviet official replied. 
From an official and party point of view, Makoyants statement 
was undoubtedly true, it having already been decided that Dr. Zhivago 
was not suitable reading for residents of the Soviet Union and its areas 
of primary influence. 
A few months before, however, spokesmen for the Soviet Communist 
Party were giving every indication that they considered Dr. Zhivago a 
subject of the greatest possible interest. This was the period, late in 
1958, when award of the Nobel prize for literature to Boris Pasternak 
set off a nation-wide campaign to discredit both book and author. 
In view of the more recent Soviet stand that Dr. Zhivago and 
qitoris Pasternak are unworthYof serious discussimbit might be interesting 
to coriiider some of the Communist Partyts possible reasons for wishing to 
wash its hands of the whole matter.

Back in 1956, long before Dr. Zhivago became an international 
best-seller, Boris Pasternak's manuscript was weighed against the stand-
ards of "Communist realise which govern all cultural endeavors in the 
Soviet Union. 
Editors of the Soviet literary monthly, Novy Mir, after consid. 
ering the manuscript in their capacity as party examiners, expressed them-
selves as shocked by both the tone and content of Pasternakts panoramic 
survey of Russian life before, during and after the Bolshevik revolution. 
"The thing that disturbed us about your novel," Pasternak was 
informed in a 10,000-word letter of rejection, "is something that neither 
the editors nor the author can alter by cuts or alterations...The spirit 
of your novel is that of non-acceptance of the socialist (Communist) 
revolution." 
While the tone of Novy Mirts letter was remarkably temperate, 
in relation to the party's later attacks on Pasternak, its long-delayed 
publication by the Soviet Literary Gazette in 1958 prompted many non-: 
Soviet readers to take a second look at their copies of Dr. Zhivago. 
Just what, they wondered, were the Communists so disturbed about? 
In addition to the author's obvious feelings about the fundamen-
tal importance of the individual, and his right to freedom of thought, a 
number of specific pvsages must have seemed highly improper to Communist 
party officials. Here are some examples:

WHY KHRUSHCHEV DISTRUSTS THE SOVIET INTELLECTUALS 
By James H. Billington 
From The New York Times Magazine 
Reprinted by permission 
The current Soviet campaign to humiliate and defame Boris Pas-
- ; 
ternak is only the latest and most dramatic illustration of the con-
tinuing tension between the Soviet regime and its intellectuals. What-
ever Nikita S. Khrushchevls successes in material construction and foreign 
policy, he has not yet found a formula for dealing with this troublesome 
element in Soviet society. 
A recent trip to the U.S.S.R. provided me an opportunity to 
learn -- through formai and informal talks in a number of intellectual 
centers -- something of the outlook of the Soviet intelligentsia. While 
the picture was often depressing, there seemed little doubt even in those 
days before Pasternak received -- and refused -- the Nobel Prize, that 
this lonely and craggy figure is closer to the thinking people of the 
U.S.S.R. than is Khrushchev or any other recent political leader.

Khrushchev's problem in determining what to do about Pasternak 
is part of the broader dilemma of the despot posing as a reformer. On 
the one hand, he must grant his cerebral servants enough freedom to 
Pro-
duce the things the regime needs; at the,aame time, .he must make it clear 
that they are still on a leash. . . 
In this period of uncertainty in which attempts are being made 
to tighten the leash .on Spirj.et wri,tera.r..if not to.terrorize them, intel-
lectuals seem to feel perplexed. and, increasingly antagonistic 10 "thee --

what they believe, let alone what we are to think 9T teach,". one young . 
Soviet teacher said of the recent changes in the official histories of 
the U.S.S.R. 
� These feelings of discontent are in many ways recent developments. 
Late in 1956, at the end of the officially sanctioned "thaw" in Soviet... 
intellectual life, apparently many still spoke with gratitude of the days 
"since the birth of Khrushchev" -- a pun, since the words for Khrushchev 
and Christ sound somewhat similar in Russian. 
Now the general attitude seems closer .Go that of a writer, who . 
said, in discussing Khrushchev's denigration of Stalin: "Comrade Khrush-
chev seems to have gotten the idea that the rumblings he made after his 
--
revelations were unqualified cheers fort him. He is like the master .of � 
ceremonies in a bad comedy show. When he suddenly receives an uproarious 
reaction from the crowd he congratulates himself on his great wit without 
noticing that his suit has just come apart at the seams."

One of the surprisingly large number of young-writers who knew 
and admired Pasternak (and who had some familiarity with '!Doctor Zhivago" 
despite the official ban-on its publication in the U.S.S.R.) pointed out 
with considerable feeling that Pasternak, in contrast to Khrushchev, 
neither benefited from the terror of the Stalin era nor waited until the 
master was dead to make his attitude clear. This same writer pointed to 
the "moral dignity" of Pasternak's long literary silence, and to such 
past incidents as his reading of nonpolitical poems at "literary evenings" 
almost entirely devoted to grovelling odes to Stalin. 
Khrushchev's most serious problems with the intellectuals are 
probably not, however, those that follow from his exposed ideological 
position so much as those that result from his determination to "overtake 
and surpass America," to use the official slogan of current Soviet con-
struction (or "keep ahead of the Chinese," to use one of the unofficial 
ones). One of the many jokes about this slogan tells of the economics 
professor who, after explaining that America is inevitably declining, 
asks his class what is the future goal of Russia and is answered in chorus: 
"Overtake and surpass America." This very determination renders the 
ambitious politicians increasingly dependent on the intellectuals' talents 
at a moment when their ideological hold over the thinking community has 
been weakened. 
Who makes up the intellectual community in the U.S S.R.? Its 
official members are the professional scientists, writers and professors 
who work for the Academy of Sciences, the Union of Writers and the higher

It was with the obvious intention of fostering the impression 
that all is well on this intellectual assembly line that a meeting was 
arranged for me in Moscow at the Union of Writers -- the organization

After a cordial welcome, Polevoi said: "So you wanted to see� ; 
well, here he is.," Thereupon a door opened and the first of several promi-

rather wooden discussion. 
This unedifying parade was accompanied by much effusive 
camaraderie among Polevoi and the permanent members of his literary semi-

really was the best novel of some obscure Soviet writer, ."You see," said 
Polevoi, throwing his arms out expansively lest I miss the point, "we 
have many arguments among ourselves." "Yes"; "Certainly"; "All the time" 
came the reprise from the chorus.

WHY.KHRUSHChEV DISTRUSTS THE SOVIET INTELLECTUALS 
At this and similar meetings (especially with large visiting 
delegations) a flattering illusion of contact is created and an earnest 
effort made to disarm potential critics with brief displays of friendli-
ness and free discussion. However, smaller informal meetings or follow-
up discussions are almost invariably ruled out, often by the simple methOd 
of putting off the initial meeting until the final day of a visitor's stay. 
But even in these formal meetings it is often possible to dis-
cover more than the Communist stage managers probably intend. One writer 
will tell you in the course of his recital that he is now preparing an 
edition-of his selected works-- "very selected", -- another that he has 
suddenly developed a passion for translating after previously saying 
paintedly that he had never had any ability or interest in foreign lan-
guages. Others convey a great deal simply by silence, by a look, or by 
including-- as most whom I met did� the names of Pasternak and other 
unorthodox contemporary figures among those whose work has made the deveat 
impression on them. 
In these rare "moments of truth," in official meetings and in 
even more rewarding chance encounters, one slowly comes to realize how 
much fuller the intellectual and creative life of Russia is than that 
which is represented by its official Communist overseers. 
The intellectual community in the Soviet Union today includes 
not only professionals, but many of the growing number of educated lay-
menres well. The very word intelligentsia  is a Russian one with past 
connotations of high purpose ami deep concern. Even today the word 
kulturny ("cultured") is generally esteemed to be a far higher compliment

than partiny(?qarty-spirited"). "To be kulturny you must live honorably," 
a Moscow cab driver explained, "and to be'intelligentny you must be able � 
to read' between the lines." There is little doubt that he -- and many 
other Russian members of this uniquely philosophic profession -- are both 
more "cultured" ahd more 'intelligent" than most of the regime's paid 
philosophers. I � -.-
Soviet intellectuals in this special sense are today the very 
old and the very young. While the very old -- Pasternak and many of the 
best scientists, writers and historians -- have their roots in pre-revolu,-
tionary-Russial the post-war generation of intellectuals represents a new 
source of vitality. Their unorthodox "rotten moods" have-perplexed the 
regime, which denounces them vigorously, but rather implausibly, as per�. 
zhitki -- "survivals of the past." 
They are in essence the Saviet Union's version of the angry 
young men-- though their anger has a moral and selfless quality-about it. 
They find unity in a common revulsion toward those whom one writer called 
"petit bourgeois Communists" -- men who survived the Stalin era and prize 
above everything else this animal survival. If these young intellectuals 
have no unifying positive vision, they do have a common idea of hell: the 
bovine life of the middle-aged bureaucrats who, without honor, humor or 
embarrassment, swarm in their inelegant beach pajamas over-imitation baron-
ial palaces along the Black Sea. 
A second comm6n characteristic of this rising student generation 
is its almost insatiable curiosity about the outside world. A student to 
whom I had given a copy of"an'American newspaper later told me that he had 
cut it into 75 pieces in order to give each of his classmates some of it. 
WHY KHRUSIEHEV DISTRUSTS THE SOVIET INTELLECTUALS - 7 
A young musician insisted that Van Cliburn was received with such unprece-
dented warmth not only because of his =kcal virtuosity, but because of a 
widespread desire to demonstrate in some way the popular thirst for expanded 
contact with the United States. 
In any event, whenever informal meetings were possible, young 
Soviet intellectuals asked questions not ohly about Little Rock and unem-
ployment, but others revealing broader horizons than many might have thought 
possible under Soviet methods of indoctrination. They seem genuinely inr. 
terested in knowing if, and why, educated Americans still believe in God, 
or if, and why, different universities teach the same subjects differently. 
When I assured a group of Moscow University studentsthat no one: 
regulated the content of my courses at Harvard, the spokesman of the group 
nodded and said, with a tone of reverence that would be hard to duplicate 
in the free world, "Da svoboda slov!" ("Yes, freedom of speech!"). 
Expanded intellectual horizons are, to a very considerable degree, 
the accidental creations of Khrushchev's policies. Although Khrushchev 
clearly intended to let out the leash only when necessary to produce results 
in areas oflpriority concern to the regime, he appears to have stimulated 
independent thinking in many unwelcome areas. 
Ardhitects, for instance, have at last been encouraged to cease 
building pretentious civic monuments and get on with long-overdue housing 
projects. But several architects who had been sent abroad to study foreign 
techniques seemed less interested in the specific methods they were sup-
posed to have studied than in the ideas they had picked up in free countries:

lightness and simplicity 
The bordeom and exasperation induced by official ideology is 
illustrated by one of the_many jokes told about the regime's attempt to 
drape itself in the mantle of a "return to Leninism." Lenin, it seems, 
arose from the grave arid.-went in search of a newspaper that would tell 
him what had happened in the U.S.Ka. since his death. When he asked 
for Pravda (Truth), Sovetckaya Rossiya (Soviet Russia) or Thud (Work), 
.I���wM, �������� 
the news vender explained to him: "There is no Truth left; Soviet Russia 
has been sold out; all that remains is Work." 
This story is typical not only in its expression of discontent, 
but also in its resignedly submissive conclusion. This technically trained 
student generation seems politically naive and even indifferent; but its 
members are at least bent on doing their work well -- without frills, 
without cant, 'arid, above all, without interference. To an observer, this 
no-nonsense attitude may seem a natural and insignificant development; but 
to the Soviet leaders -- whose political position is still dependent on 
their ideolozicoll pretensions -- it apparently seems to be part of some 
insidious plot, a kind of creeping pragmatism which bids fair to threaten 
the "leading role of the party" in all walks of life. 
This struggle between party bureaucrat and scientific specialist 
seems to have been almost literally built into the new Moscow University, 
which dominates the horizon of the capital for miles around. These new 
buildings are for the exclusive use of the favored scientific faculties, 
WHY KHRUSHOHEV DISTRUSTS THE SOVIET INTELLECTUALS - 9 
but they are built in the heavy, Mtsco-Vite style which man scientists 
openly refer to as "the Empire style in the time of the plague." All 
115tudy is free, but engraved on the wall of the main auditorium is Stalin's 
ominous warning that scientists must be not only skilled specialists, but 
faithful and active party men as well. 
At the other end of the intellectual pole from the creeping 
pragmatism and skepticism of the scientist is the .half-hidden interest of 
many intellectuals in the broader questions of meaning and purpose. 
While the educated classes, on the whole, do not appear anxious 
to return to any formal religion, I did notice some evidence of renewed 
interest in religious ideas. One student explained that the riotous stu-
dent demonstrations of support for the novelist Dudintsev two years ago 
were more on behalf of the title of his work, "Not by Bread Alone," than 
for the author or the book itself. In the re-examination of long-neglected 
elements in Russia's past during the past few years, the attention of the 
thinking classes has been focused largely on the tortured but deeply reli-
gious figure of Dostoevsky. A new edition of his works and a new motion 
picture version of "The Idiot" seem to be enjoying more popularity and 
provoking more thoughtful discussion than almost any other recent cultural 
productions. 
In such delicate subjects as the exploration of Russia's past, 
"they" (the party bureaucrats) are, of course, ever alert to see that cul-
tural activities either support an ideological point or contribute to the 
prestige of the Soviet state. There was something both amusing and depress-

to some birchwood account records that had been dug up at great expense. 
"These prove," he announced rather defensively, "that we Russians weren't 
illiterate back in the twelfth century, and that we didn't get our culture 
from the church, . either." 
If the Soviet intellectual community is in frequent conflict 
with its party overseers and is increasingly populated by inquiring young 
men who can "read between the lines," nonetheless its contribution to the 
state remains immense. 
The undeniable material progress that Russia has made in the 
Soviet period would have been unthinkable without the cooperation of many 
pre-revolutionary intellectuals and the development in more recent years 
of an impressive new generation of scientists and technologists. Although 
Soviet science almost certainly owes a theoretical debt to Germany, England, 
and the United States for its recent advances in such fields as rocketry, 
jet aviation, and nuclear energy, these still are substantial national 
achievements, in which most Soviet intellectuals take considerable pride. 
The intellectuals' sense of identification with the fate of their 
native land is exemplified by Pasternak's anguished plea not to be exiled 
from Russia. Particularly since the upsurge of wartime nationalism, the 
regime seems to have benefited from the general desire to stick together, 
almost no matter what, while the motherland got back on her feet. However, 
after more than 13 years, many now seem to feel that it is time for a new 
period to begin. 
Both the vitriolic campaign against Pasternak and Khrushchev's 
new program to remedy the students' "separation from life" by imposing on

them obligatory service. in a factory or on a farm indicate that the re-
gime is determined to tighten the leash. But it is unlikely that Khrushchev 
can ever preside over a full-blown return to Stalinism, herring himself done 
so much to shatter the myth of infallibility. Thus, it appears likely 
that the Soviet leadership will have to grant some further grudging con-
cessions to the group on which it depends for the realization of its plans. 
Vindictive personal injustices -- such as forcing Pasternak to 
decline the Nobel Prize -- undoubtedly will continue. But as all who have 
recently seen Pasternak attest, he has developed a noble indifference to 
his personal fate as long as he can in some way give witness to his ideals 
within his native Russia. If some party bureaucrat, such as his principal 
tormentor Surkov, the widely disliked secretary of the Writers Union, should 
succeed in imposing even more brutal sanctions on Pasternak, they would 
probably do the cause which Pasternak serves more good than harm. Indeed, 
the vast uproar already made about "Doctor Zhivago" has, no doubt, done far 
more to stimulate curiosity about a novel still unpublished in the U S.S.R. 
than to call forth any genuine indignation over it. 
When I concluded my visit in the Soviet Union in the fall of 
1958, I did not feel any great optimism about the ability of these inquir-
ing young intellectuals seriously to affect the politics or policies of the 
Soviet state� at least in the near future. Nonetheless, I left with a 
distinct feeling that Soviet creative life has a richness and depth which 
the regime has been unable fully to control and the world fully to appre-
ciate.

Though I did not See Pasternak, 'Ineverthelesi felt some sense 
of his presence in many talks with Russian thinkers. Outstanding young - 
writers, who are among his closest friends and admirers, have long been 
heartened by his adherence to poetic values in an age Of political doggerel. 
Some of the unorthodox aesthetic ideas they axperessed -- of 
experimenting with' blank verse or pOeticizing the Russian language by elim-
inating harsh gutterals -- represent the sort of thing he himself might do 
if he still had yoUth and.a chance to publish. In talking with many others 
who have no real understanding of Pasternak's literary work, I found that 
he-stands as a witness to the proposition that it is possible to have lived 
through all that Ruseia has experienced in this century and yet still speak 
truthfully about important questions. 
' One cannot leave the U.S.S.R without some feeling of respect 
for the forests of cranes atop buildings going up, for the new dams and 
hoSpitals, for the hypnotic statistics of physical construction. But some-
how one feels that these are not what thinking young' Russians really care 
about; that this building is for them a massive calisthenic exercise held-
in the half-light prior to the dawn. 
But is there to be a dawn? In search of an answer one turns 
inevitably to Pasternak-- and to the many others whose names and fates 
may never be known. It is possible that in Pasternak and "Doctor Zhivago" 
one sees only the last reflections on a lonely mountain of a sun that has 
already set. But perhaps his is also the perspective of Prospero -- the 
wondrous final creation of the Shakespeare whom Pasternak has so long and 
so lovingly translated. For Pasternak "the cloud-capp'd towers, the

pageant faded" and man "such stuff as dreams are made on." 
As he recently said: "The proclamations, the tumult, the exm.

as the grass grows. It is ripening as fruit does, and it is growing in

THE LESSON OF PASTERNAK 
By Ignazio Silone 
From The New Leader 
Reprinted by permission 
The great storm around Boris. Pasternak has now abated. Now we 
can put into perspective some of the things revealed by it. 
What, above all, is the true significance of the pretests that 
have been voiced in all parts of the world against the grave threats and 
persecution to which Pasternak has been subjected in the U.S.S.R.? These 
protests, in my view, constitute the most fitting reply to the abject 
rationalizations which the poet himself was forced to submit in rejecting 
the Nobel Prize for Literature. The first reason given by Pasternak for 
his rejection referred, as we know, to the particular psychology of the 
national society-to which he belongs and which, realistically, he must 
take into account. But the intense emotion and the rising storm of pro�
test engendered throughout the civilized world by this episode demon�
strate that there exists, at least potentially, a society larger than 
the national society to which Pasternak, as a man and as a consummate 
artist, fully belongs.

2 - THE LESSON OF PASTERNAK 
All of us knew, in discussing the Pasternak affair, that we 
were not arbitrarily interfering in the internal affairs of a foreign 
country. Pasternak is our colleague; he belongs to us as much as to the 
Russians; he is part of what Goethe called Weltliteratur. The boundary-
less society of artists and,Stee.men_felt outraged and wounded by the 
ignoble behavior of the Sovietcultural'bureaucracy. We had the right 
and the duty to intervene. Pasternak unexpectedly gave a name and a 
face to the cause'of the freedom of art. With him our dignity and our 
honor as writers were at stake. Now the simple fact that a novel has 
been the center of the'world's attention must impress upon us the impor-
tance which true art can still assume in the life of the people. 
After Budapest, after Warsaw, we now have "Dottor Zhivago." 
Anyone who, in the future, speaks of the role of the intellectuals in 
our time will not be able to ignore these func9ar,ental events. In this 
sense, the Pasternak case has served as a touchstone which no Western 
literary circles can refuse to recognize. The cowardice, the ambiguity; 
the subtle distinctions, the hypocritical' evasions of "equi-distance" ' 
have again- laid bare the malaise which still afflicts many' Western writers 
when they are confronted-with the need -to assume a reSponsibility that 
endarigers.their tranquility. This'is a lesson to keep in mind. 
The Pasternak 'case has also enabled us to See tdre clearly the' 
present status of cultural life in the Soviet Empire* airei* knew 
that the "thaw" was a short-lived one. We knew that the cultural insti-
tutions, the publishing houses, the writers' and artists' associations,

directors who had been placed there by Andrei Zhdanov. But we never 
could have predicted that the insolence of these gentlemen could take .� 
this form, which, to us, appears mad. To be sure, even now we are not, 
in favor of a rupture of cultural relations with the Soviet Union; we 
remain, now as always, partisans of a free circulation of men and ideas. 
But we shall not easily forget the names of the Soviet men of letters who 
promoted the shameful campaign against Pasternak and who led the Moscow 
Writers Union to request that the Government deprive Pasternak of the 
right to work and live in the U.S.S.R. We must wait for one of these 
gentlemen to appear at some international conference in Venice, Rome, 
Zurich, or Paris, to ask him to account for his ignominy. Of course, 
shameful attitudes have been taken by other writers, recently and in the 
distant past. But the literary history of no country knows a more de-
grading spectacle than that of an assembly of Boo writers condemning a 
novel without having read it. Not even the Spanish Inquisition, in its 
darkest period, descended to

certain Soviet writers, including some 
the general outcry against Pasternak. We 
must hope that more will be known about this, and soon. But the question 
that arises is this: Taking into account the conformism of the Writers 
Union; is it conceivable that it could hae been convened, and that it 
would have taken these mad decisions, without an explicit order from the 
supreme political authorities? No, this is unthinkable. Haw; therefore,

can we explain the fact that these decisions were, not implemented!? The �. 
apparent repentance, 1t, appears to me, was dictated by the information, 
which had in the meantime been received by Nikita S. Khrushchev on the: 
internal and international repercussions of the scandal. Jib must have 
noticed that' the Zhdanovists of the Soviet culture apparatus had forced 
his, hand, and he offered Pasternak the possibility of an accommoaation. 
Pasternak's letter to Khrushchev was rather disappointing to 
many-Admirers of "Doctor Zhivago." But who can judge? We must exercise 
our imagination to conjure up the lynch atmosphere to which Pasternak was 
exposed, during a period of some ten days. To be sure, it is an embana 
rassing letter. Fully five times, despite the brevity of the letter, 
Pasternak repeats that his statement was written freely, without violence, 
without blackmail, without suggestions from others. "I have not been 
subjected to threats or to constraint," we read . . . "Nothing can force 
me to act against my conscience . . . ." "I have given up the prize .with-
out constraint by-anyone." And so on. Would,this not seem too much for 
a free man in an atmosphere of serenity? The letter is basea voon a 
glorification of Pasternak's native soil which ominously recalls the 
notorious sentiment of "Blut and Baden," in sharp contrast with the 
internationalist tradition of the founders of Russian Communism almost 
all of whom knew exile, and with the work of Pasternak himself. Nobody 
leaves his own-country with a light heart, but if need be, one can in 
fact emigrate. Before being Italian, German, Russian, one is a man.

Finally, the references in Pasternak's letter to the circum-
stances through which "Doctor Zhivago" came to be published are not 
truthful. And the publisher, Feltrinelli, has done well to refrain 
from setting the record straight -- for how, after all, can one engage 
in polemics with a prisoner? But we may be permitted, through an asso-
ciation of ideas, to recall an episode from the period of the great 
Stalinist trials: A defendant, forced to confess that he had met Leon 
Trotsky's son in a Copenhagen hotel, gave a fictitious name -- so that 
from the falseness of this detail, the falseness of the entire testimony 
could be deduced abroad. 
Alas, in these days, Pasternak was so deafened by the hysterical 
shrieking cf the Moscow writers that he failed to perceive that, because 
of the alert sounded by international opinion, he was stronger than his 
adversaries. But "Doctor Zhivago" will survive all polemics; this is 
the revenge of which no dictatorship can deprive the poet.

PASTERNAK'S "DR. ZHIVAGO" 
"My greatest wish, a quiet life" 
By Max Hayward 
From Encounter 
Reprinted by permission 
Boris Pasternak's novel, "Dr. Zhivagolu was first mentioned in 
the Soviet press during the thaw after Stalin's death. For almost 20 
years Pasternak, once a leading figure in the Russian literary world, he.d 
published practically nothing. Then in April 1954 ten magnificent poems, 
described as "poems from the novel in prose, 'Dr. Zhivago," appeared in 
the magazine Znamya issued by the Soviet Union of Writers. In an intro-
ductory note, signed "The Author," Pasternak wrote: 
"The novel will probably be completed in the 
course of the summer. It covers the period from 1902 
to 1929, with an epilogue relating to the Great War 
for the Fatherland. 
"The hero, Yu A. Zhivago, a physician, a 
thinking man in search of truth, with a creative and 
artistic bent, dies in 1929. Among his papers written 
in younger days, a number of poems are found, which 
will be attached to the book as a final chapter. 
Some of them are reproduced here."

What happened in the two years between the summers of 1954 and 
1956 remains shrouded in mystery. Soviet writers on visits abroad gave 
contradictory reports on whether and when Pasternak's novel would be 
finished. The author himself remained silent except for the occasional 
publication in Soviet periodicals of a solitary poem: or a critical ar-
ticle on translations from Shakespeare. During the minor freeze-up in 
the autumn of 1954, marked by the condemnation of Pomerantsev's article 
on "Sincerity in Literature" and the removal of the poet Tvardovsky from 
the editorship of the magazine Novy Mir, the poems published in Znamya  
were mildly criticised by Soviet critics as "lacking in vitality" and 
"failimgto answer the call of the present day." Details of a literary 
intrigue are rarely ventilated in the pages of the Soviet press. We must 
therefore rely for our knowledge of the destiny of Pasternak's novel in 
that period on an official interview given to the Italian Communist paper, 
L'Unita (22nd October, 1957): by the secretary of the Union of Writers of 
the U.S.S.R.: a poet, a prominent literary bureaucrat and a member of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Alexeyi 
Surkov. Surkov, who, according to L'Unita: at last gives us the true 
story of "Dr. Zhivago," stated that Pasternak had sent the manuscript 
of his novel to one of the Soviet publishing houses. The "whole collec-
tive" -- by which the firm's editorial board is probably meant -- read it. 
They sent a private letter to- Pasternak explaining the reasons for their 
disagreement with him. Surkov pointed out that he could not blame those 
who had read this book, as he had done himself, for believing that it

put in doubt the validity Of the October Revolution which is described 
as if it were the greatest crime in Russian history. According to 
Surkov, Pasternak seemed to agree with some of the criticism contained 
in the letter and spoke of his intention to revise the text. Surkov 
also stated that Pasternak had sent a telegram to his Italian publisher 
asking him to return the manuscript (which had been used for preparing 
an Italian translation) to Moscow for revision. 
The-important part of Surkov's statement lies in the information 
that the novel has been condemned by a group of Writers, including Surkov 
himself, which explains why it has not yet appeared in the Soviet Union. 
What Surkov did not say in his interview with L'Unita was that, at the 
same time as he presented his novel to the Union of Writers for publica-
tion: Pasternak had given the copyright for all translations into foreign 
languages to the publishing firm of Feltrinelli in Milan, who arranged 
for publication in English: French and German as well as an Italian ver-
sion. Feltrinelli is himself a rather prominent member of the Italian 
Communist Party. His representative visited Pasternak in the summer of 
1956 and brought the manuscript to Italy. In the year that passed between 
the conclusion of the agreement between the author and his Italian pub-
lisher and Surkov's visit to Italy, there was plenty of time for a Russian 
edition to appear, perhaps even a revised one, and then of course the 
Italian publisher would have taken into consideration any revisions. .As 
nothing of the kind happened: Feltrinelli decided to stick to his original 
agreement with the author and refused to stop the publication of the Ital-
ian translation. In a statement to the press he made it known that Surkov

had visited him, accompanied by an official of the Italian Communist 
Party, and that the two used every means. of persuasion, including Surkov's-
expressed concern for Pasternak's personal safety, and various kinds of 
threats to force Feltrinelli to alter his decision. Prtssure was also 
applied to the other foreign publishers, and telegrams signed by Pasternak 
were received by them asking them to abandon publication. However, in a 
statement to foreign journalists made at his residence near Moscow in 
December 1957, after the appearance of the Italian translation, Pasternak 
expressed no regret that the novel had appeared, and put the blame for 
"all this nonsense" on the Soviet literary authorities who could have 
avoided it by permitting publication in the U.S.S.R. 
The situation is bedevilled by the fact of a personal rivalry 
between Surkov and Pasternak, of which Surkov makes no secret in his 
public statements. This may be seen in, for example, Surkov's attack 
on Pasternak in Pravda of 1st December, 1957, in which he condemns 
attempts to "canonise" Pasternak and other writers of similar outlook. 
However, Surkov must be keenly conscious of the opprobrium which would 
fall on him if he had to bear sole responsibility for the decision to 
suppress "Dr. Zhivago." He was careful to get a unanimous decision from 
the board which sat in judgment over the novel. Recently, verses by him 
were published side by side with some of Pasternak's in the Literaturnaya 
Gazetal probably an attempt to establish an alibi. 
Nevertheless, it is hardly possible that the recent efforts to 
stop publication abroad could. have been made only at the instigation of 
Surkov or other litterateurs who were moved by professional jealousy. Of

course, such jealousies would-be used by the Party in order to get the 
active support of Surkov and 'people like him for the effort to silence 
Pasternak. Butt the decision must have been taken at a higher level than 
the Union of Writers and from more general motives than literary jealousy. 
The reaion for the attitude of the Soviet authorities must there-
fore be sought in the first place in the contents of the novel itself and, 
in the second place, in the personality of the author. Surkov'S argument 
that the novel was rejected because of an alleged slander on the October 
Revolution is not quite convincing. To begin with, there is no outright 
condemnation of the October Revolution as such in the novel, and the 
question whether the Revolution was a crime or not could never have been 
put by Pasternak. He does not think or speak in such categories. But 
even if -- by implication -- Pasternak's novel can be interpreted as an 
attack on the October Revolution, it does not follow that it would have 
been rejected outright for publication in the summer of 1956. 
There was, at that time, a hint in the air of an open discussion 
of the fundamentals of the Communist creed. Those responsible for the 
publication of literary works were bold enough to allow Dudintsev's novel 
"Not by Bread Alone" to appear in the monthly journal Novy Mir, and the 
Moscow writers were preparing for the second issue of "Literaturnaya-
Moskva," 1956, which contained a number of bitter attacks on the policies 
of Government and Party. Historians were working out a revised version 
of the October Revolution and of the history of the Party. If misrepre-
sentation of the October Revolution had been the only -- or the main --
fault of Pasternak's novel, the appearance of the novel could have been

(he had been a pupil of Scriabin) and the diversity of his interests in 
general account for the fact that the imagery of these poems is that of 
a fleeting; momentary association of ideas which remains unimpeded by 
common-sense knowledge or artistic prejudice. He would compare the eye-

and if you think of it," he would add, "the writings of the gentry on

imagery is impressionistic. Some of it arises from a play with

alliterations and from semantic riddles. It strikes the reader for a 
moment as incomprehensible: sometimes as gibberish. It is only by letting 
the words produce the full aura of associations in the mind that the images 
cone alive and, after a short period during which they seem artificial and 
capricioub, one suddenly realises that their fleeting spontaneity could 
never have been the result of artifice but only of a vision which had 
possessed' the poet. This is why it is right to say that Pasternak's po-
etry, as recorded in the few- volumes of verses which he has published, 
has not been his life-work, but a series of accidentally preserved samples 
of that poetical vision which goes on uninterruptedly as long as he breathes, 
and which is the very essence of his life. Realising.the identity of the 
poet and the human be.ing isn Pasternak's personality, we begin to appreciate 
the silliness of the suspicion that he could use his poetical gift for a 
political aim. 
From his parents (his father was an eminent painter and his 
mother an accomplished musician) Pasternak inherited the gift of poetical 
sight and a very elgbOrate rhythmic expression. But these gifts and tal-
ents are only the pterequisites of his poetry. The poetry itself is the 
sum total of the events of his every-day life, of waking and going to 
sleep, of acting and eating. To make use of his talents for a political 
or, for that matter, any other extraneous purpose, would mean

of all Party directives on poetry. What would this mean in the case of 
Pasternak? It would mean the suppression of some, and the wilful inter-
ference with others, of the free associations of ideas and emotional 
reactions which constitute his poetical vision. For one whose creative 
moments are rare and summoned up by a deliberate effort of will this might 
perhaps be possible. For Pasternak and any poet of this type such an 
interference would mean an intolerable mutilation of all his vital activi-
ties. Looking out of the window would become torture indeed if the process 
by which the sight of branches of trees and of the buildings and the drops 
of rain on the glass are transformed into a rhythmic expression of all 
they mean to the poet, was interfered with by a censor, who would select 
out of it what he believes they should mean to the reader. Pasternak's 
silence lasting for 20 years can only be explained as a passive resistance 
to such interference with his poetical life. 
Perhaps, in a paradoxical way so characteristic of Soviet con-
ditions, Pasternak's claim for the recognition of his independence as,a 
poet provides an explanation of the surprising fact that he was never 
physically molested, imprisoned or banished under the Stalin regime. 
Stalin may well have believed that if nothing could be obtained from 
Pasternak in support of the regime, not much need be feared from him 
which would endanger it. Stalin knew that the stick and the carrot 
might be effective with Alexei Tolstoy or Ilya Ehrenburg� but would be 
of no avail with Pasternak. At the same time, he must have sensed what 
the Soviet poets and writers whom his apparatus controlled thought of 
Pasternak's towering superiority. It is in keeping with what we know of 
PASTERNAK'S "DR. ZHINAGO" - 9 - 
Stalin's character to assume that he held Pasternak in reserve as a kind 
of bogy for the controllable poets and. writers so that he could say: "If 
ever I allow freedom of creative work to anyone, I will allow it to 
Pasternak. He, at least, will produce genuine poetry whereas you, who 
have been serving me with your tkhaltural (pot-boiling) might make use 
of such freedom to serve another master." 
.However this may be, the fact remains that Pasternak lived in 
terror and frustration between the middle 1930's and the beginning of the 
Second World War. During the war, he remained in Moscow and. witnessed 
the peculiar atmosphere which prevailed in the city between October and 
December 1941. This period has been described more than once as a kind 
of crisis of liberation.* As Pasternak states expressly in his novel, the 
beginning of the war produced a powerful liberating effect on the mentality 
of the sensitive Soviet,citizein. It was probably at that momenti. when in 
the midst of physical privation an4 fear some natural freedom and moral 
courage could be recovered, that the idea of "Dr. Zhivago" was hatched. 
The decision to write the novel as it has been written: without 
fear or scruple, and to press for its publication, cannot have come easily 
to Pasternak. This is revealed in the first of the poems included in the 
Appendix to the novel. In this poem the poet is about to play the part 
of Hamlet. He is already on the stage and from the dark auditorium he 
feels the touch of a thousand opera-glasses focused on him. He prays the

He is ready to fulfil the human drama and to play his part:in life. But 
he begs God to spare him this appearance in social isolation before a 
hostile and uncomprehending humanity. The order of life is, however, 
pre-established and the final goal of the path of his life is unavoid-

live one's life is not all that easy' (is not like crossing a field, as 
the Russian proverb goes). It was inthismood that "Dr. Zhivago" was 
conceived. 
Pasternak's attitude towards the revolutionary events which are 
the setting of his novel was that of an "obyvatel" -- an untranslatable 
word which Russians have used since the nineteenth century to describe 
those among them whose attitude towards politics was exactly that of 
ordinary people everywhere towards the weather. For them, political 
conditions and circumstances were to be taken account of solely in order 
that they should not interfere with their personal lives. It would be 
sheer lunacy to attempt to interfere with these events, to jeopardise 
or even render more difficult personal achievements by the vain attempt 
to change political circumstances, just as it would be lunacy to try 
and influence the weather to suit our ends.

towards State authority and, in particular, every kind of police, may 
appear submissive and cowardly, he is capable of great personal courage 
and spirit of sacrifice in all personal relations and in personal mis-
fortunes. His submissiveness is resilient. An "obyvatel" will enjoy 
official festivities, march to music in demonstrations when required, 
and perform all the ritual imposed on the politically reliable citizens 
by Authority, while remaining inwardly as aloof towards this authority, 
be it the Tsar or the Communist Party, as one is towards the frost or 
the rain, or to the causes of disease and death. The "obyvatel" has often 
been a rather despicable figure in Russian literature, or a figure of fun, 
especially in so-called "progressive" writings, but much attention has 
been focused on him and his human qualities ever since Pushkin's "Tales 
of Belkin" and Gogol's "Overcoat." 
The key position in Russian literature of Gogol's "Overcoat" is 
beyond doubt. It is the source of the stream of writings in defence of 
the dignity of the small man. But it is surprising that another feature 
% 
of this story has not been pointed out by the many literary historians 
who have discussed it. The little clerk in "The Overcoat," whose precious 
garment had been stolen after he had starved and saved for months to pay 
for it, turned for help to the Head of his Department. His Excellency 
gave him a dressing down: the little man went home and died. In a 
grotesque and whimsical epilogue, the ghost of the clerk returns to earth 
and disrobes His Excellency, at night in a blizzard, of his magnificent 
beaver-collared overcoat. It is going too far to interpret Gogol's story 
as a symicolic vision of the vengeance which the humble and oppressed would

wreck on all the EXcellencies almost a century later, a vision born in 
Gogol's schizophrenic mind and of the significance of which he was him-
self possibly not conscious? 
In any event, the "obyvatel," while remaining an object of 
derision and blame became, at the same time, a pet of Russian literature, 
which prided itself on asserting the dignity and intrinsic value of the 
poor and humble. This attitude-terminated in the long gallery of 
Chekhov's heroes -- most of them "obyvatels," or "superfluous" men, and 
most of them redeemed as human beings. 
While this process of the gradual rehabilitation of the "obyvatel" 
went on in Russian prose, poetry remained essentially untouched by it. 
There, the polarisation of trends was characterised by the contrast between 
civic poetry and an attitude of "ivory tower" and "art for art's sake." 
Both trends had their roots in nineteenth-century romanticism. In both 
cases the poet claimed to serve a cause, either that of "increasing ar-
tistic values in the world," or of "contributing to social progress." 
Abusive allegations of philistinism were flung backwards and forwards 
between the two camps. Revolutionary heroics took over the traditions 
of romanticism without having undergone purification by the realistic 
vision so noticeable and so beneficial in Russian prose writing. � 
Mayakaysky came as a Victor Hugo of the Russian Revolution. At their 
best moments, Russian poets were painfully.conscious of their alienation 
from the source of real poetry. This is why Pushkin, who would write 
poetry as he breathed air, towered above them as a demi-god whose works 
would for ever remain unsurpassed.

-13-
In his rehabilitation of the "obyvatel" attitude which ends in 
an apotheosis, Pasternak takes his bearings from Pushkin. He makes his 
hero, who has found a temporary refuge with his family in the wastes of 
the eastern Urals, read and comment on Pushkin: 
"The fabulous is never anything but the 
commonplace touched by the hand of a genius. The 
best object lesson in this respect 'is Pushkin. What 
an ode to honest work, duty and the common round: 
The words 'bourgeois' and 'obyvatel' have only become 
terms of abuse nowadays, but Pushkin forestalled the 
implied reproach in his 'Family Tree': 'A bourgeois, 
a bourgeois is what I am!' and again in 'Onegin's 
Journey': Now my ideal is the housewife/My greatest 
wish, a quiet life/A fat tureen of cabbage soup." 
The message of the novel is, to a large extent, an elaboration 
of this simple but surprising thought. 
The comparison of "Dr. Zhivago" with Tolstoy's "War and Peace," 
which has already been made in the press, can only cause misunderstanding. 
Both epics are, of course, attempts on a large scale to reflect the char-
acter of an epoch, but this is the only ground for comparison. Tolstoy's 
novel was a reconstruction of a period based on certain preconceived 
ideas concerning the character of historical development and its real 
causes. "Dr. Zhivago" is an account of personal experience, and the unity 
of vision achieved by Pasternak is not conditioned by a theoretical 
approach to historical data as it was in the case of Tolstoy. It is the

novel not been so obviously autobiographical, it would have been personal 
and lyrical in this sense. It is focused on one of the protagonists, 
Dr. Zhivago, who is both the main hero and almost the narrator of the 
novel. 
Zhivago's personality is so close to the author that their 
relationship can be compared to that of Proust and the "I" of "A la 
Recherche de Temps Perdu." The character emerges gradmily and, even 
towards the end of the novel, it has still the same myopic vagueness 
of design which is characteristic of introspective self-knowledge. But 
of course, Pasternak's hero should not be identified with the author him-
self. He is something of Pasternak's super-ego, whose purity of purpose, 
dignity and humanity Pasternak obviously admires and can hardly hope to 
attain. For this admiration, Pasternak takes vengenance on his hero by 
reducing his social effectiveness to a minimum, by making him one of the

In spite of his psychological insight and his goodwill towards his fellow-

personal relations as a whole is that of failure and disaster. It has 
been said that Pasternak referred to Turgenev's Rudin as to a distant 
literary ancestor of Zhivago, but he seems to have more in common with

Dostoevsky's "Idiot" and certain Chekhov characters. There is the same 
inability to transform knowledge and intention into action; and the same 
final triumph in failure, the triumph of the uncompromising attitude to 
reality, which will not be bribed by the promise of wordly success. This 
final justification and apotheosis of Zhivago's way of life comes towards 
the end of the boa and finds its most powerful expression in the lament 
of Lam, the great love of his life, over his dead body in Moscow in 
1929. No Russian'writer before Pasternak has made this point clearer 
concerning the superfluous man. Unlike Dostoevsky's hero, however, 
Zhivago is not a Jesus-like figure. He is more like an apostle, one of 
those disciples who could not keep awake during the vigil of Gethsemane, 
referred to in the last poem at the end of the novel. 
Zhivago's character develops against the background of the 
dissolution of Russian society which culminated in the revolution of 
1917. His attitude towards the great social changes is that of a 
sympathising and enlightened "obyvatel." Although the problems of the 
historical destiny add of the social development of Russia were present 
inhis, mind from early youth, Zhivago never thought he could influence 
them directly by his actions. He did not seek contact with those who 
believed they could do so, and it is clear from his casual encounters 
with them that his attitude towards their belief was, at the best, pity 
for ignorant enthusiasts. This does not mean that he was indifferent to 
the Revolution. It affected him most profoundly, and his attitude towards 
political events is stated in the novel with extreme clarity. In a scene

PASTERNAK'S "DR. ZHIVAGO" 
- 
Zhivago philosophises about the political conditions in Russia in the 
high summer of 1917/ and expresses the typically "obyvatel" attitude to 
them, as if they were uncontrollable in the sate way as the forces of 
nature itself. He says: 
"Last night, I was watching a public meeting. 
What an sme7ing spectacle: Old Mother Russia is on the 
move. She cannot stand still any longer; she walks and . 
cannot stop walking; she talks and cannot stop talking; 
and it is not that the only speakers are the people; 
stars and trees have come together and are holding 
parleys; the flowers of the night are philosophising, 
stone buildings are taking part in public meetings." 
The idea appeals to tare, who says that she understands the 
trees and the stars who take part in meetings. She knows what he means 
and herself had such ideas. This objectivist, or naturalist attitude 
towards the social and revolutionary turmoil establishes the first 
intimate link between Zhivago and Laza, which then develops into the 
great love story of their lives. 
It is remarkable that another eminent Russian poet whose later

pointed out Pasternak's peculiar attitude to the Revolution as early as 
1924 in a review of his second book of poems, "My Sister -- Life."

ments in the Revolution, only open squares in open 
fields.) Pasternak and the Revolution did actually 
meet. He saw her for the first time in the distance 
in the glow of fires shooting into the air like a 
corn sheaf. He heard her in the groaning flight of 
the roads. The Revolution reached him and was 
assimilated by him like everything in his life, 
through nature. Pasternak will say his word about 
the Revolution as the Revolution herself will say 
it at some future time. In the summer of 1917 he 
marched in step with her and listened to her 
attentively." 
Paradoxically, the more revolutionary events tended to inter-
fere with Zhivago's personal life, the more conscious became his attitude 
of passive

submissiveness to their blind elemertal power. Pasternak 
point again and again by-combiniug every glimpse of the 
happenings of the autumn of 1917 with some entirely personal 
his hero's life. During the October days when indiscriminate 
shooting makes movement in the streets of Moscow practically impossible 
and visitors who drop in remain stranded for days in Zhivago's flat, a 
note of poignancy is introduced by the record of a seemingly alarming 
although, in the end, innocuous illness of his little son. When at last 
Zhivago is able to get out into the streets, he is once more overwhelmed, 
as he had been the summer before, by a feeling:of-the-cosmic unity of 
natural and social upheavals:

Pasternak interrupts the story of Zhivago's reaction to what he is reading

lesson home, Pasternak makes another :seemingly casual digression. On his 
way home, Dr. Zhivago takes advantage of .the darkness to steal a log of 
wood from a heap of demolition timber guarded by a sentry and brings it 
home, where fuel has been used up during the days of street fighting. At 
home, Zhivago comments on the significance of the news: 
"...the main thing is the streak of genius 
about it all.liadanybody been given the-task of 
creating a new world: of beginning a new era, his 
first definite need would be to have the decks 
suitably cleared for action. Before getting down 
to the construction of new epochs he would have 
waited for the old to finish. He would have 
needed a round number, a new paragraph, a blank 
page. And here, look at it, this unprecedented 
thing, this miracle of history, this revelation, 
has been dropped in the midst of the continuing 
day-to-day life with a complete disregard for its 
course. 
"The miracle has begun, not from the 
beginning, but from the middle. Not at a date 
which had been fixed in advavel but on an ordinary 
week-day in the very midst of the tramway traffic 
in the city. This is what strikes one most as a 
feat of genius. Only the very greatest can be so 
out of time and place."

PASTERNAK'S "DR. ZHIVAGO" 
-20-
The greatness of the-revolutionary events and Zhivago's enthu-
siasm about them does not mean, however, that he approved of any of the 
intentions of the Revolution. Years later, after the whole family had 
fled from starving and typhus-infested Moscow to the Urals, where they 
hoped to settle down as market gardeners, Zhivago's father-in-law comments 
on what Zhivago said in the first days of the October Revolution. Zhivago 
tells his father-in-law that now that they have come into a part of the 
world where their relatives had owned a large property before theRevo-
lution, they must be quite honest with each other about their hopes, 
desires and aspirations: 
"We must agree- beforehand on the way in 
which to behave in certain circumstances) in order 
not to be ashamed of each other and not to put each 
other to shame." 
What Zhivago means is obviously the attitude they should adopt 
in case of a counter-revolutionary coup (White Guard detachments were 
roaming quite near the station where the conversation took place), and 
whether they would, in this eventuality, claim any part of the property 
to which Zhivago's wife might be entitled. 
Zhivago's father-in-law, Gromeko, answers: 
'Do you remember that winter blizzard night 
when you brought the news-sheet with the first decrees? 
Do you remember how that was absolutely final? Its 
uncompromising character subdued us: but such things 
live in their original purity only in the heads of their

creators, and that only on the first day of their 
announcement. By the next day, the Jesuit hypocrisy 
of politics turns everything inside out. What can 
I tell you? This philosophy /hat is, communis.27n 
is alien to me. This government is against us. 
I was not asked whether I agreed to this general 
break-up. But they trusted me and the way I 
behaved, even if I acted under pressure, puts an 
obligation on me." 
The old man explains to Zhivago that he is not going to claim 
any rights in the property of his in-laws, but will merely use his con-
tacts in order to settle on the land and make a living out of it. "The 
history of private property in Russia," says old Gromeko, "has come to 
an end. And we personally, the Gromekos, had already said good-bye to 
the passion for acquisition in the Nineteenth Century." 
This is the style in which Pasternak speaks of political reality 
affecting the private lives of his heroes. There is no criticism or 
discussion of the intentions, aspirations and political manoeuvring of 
those who claimed to direct revolutionary events. What concerns Pasternak 
is: what Should a man like his hero do when faced with such changes, in 
order to preserve his moral integrity, and to survive without breaking up 
his personal identity? 
Zhivago is contrasted with another character who appears in two 
different aspects. Pavel Antipov is a working-class boy, an orphan, 
brought up by a family of railway workers, a gifted, tormented mind who,

after completing his university studies and marrying a girl whom he 
considers socially superior to him, becomes an intellectual. The girl 
is the same Lara who later, when abandoned by him, becomes the grand 
amour of Zhivago. While Zhivago is the type of "obyvatel," Antipov is 
the "activist" par excellence. Pasternak sums up his character at the 
end of the first volume, in the following words: 
"Two features, two passions were characteristic 
of him: his thinking was uncommonly clear and correct 
and, to an equally uncommon degree, he.had the gift of 
moral purity and justice, and his feelings were warm 
and noble. But what stopped him becoming the kind 
of scholar who blazes new trails was that his brain 
lacked that talent for the arbitrary, that force 
which by unpredicted discoveries shatters the barren 
harmony of sterile predictions. 
"And. so far as doing good was concerned, 
though he was a man of principle, he was lacking 
in that unprincipledness of the heart which knows 
nothing of generalizations, concerning itself 
solely with individual instances, the heart whose 
greatness rests on the very littleness of its 
actions. 
"From his early childhood, Pavel longed 
for the very highest and brightest ideals. In. 
his view, life was a huge arena in which, honestly

adhering to the rules, men were competing in their 
progress to greater perfection. 
"When he found out that this was not so, it 
did not occur to him that he had been wrong in having 
a much too simplified idea of the world order. his 
obviously refers also to the failure of Pavel's 
marriage to Laraj Having buried his grievance 
deep in his soul, he began playing with the idea 
of some time becoming supreme judge in the contest 
between life and the dark forces which corrupted 
it. He daydreamed of drawing his sword in defence 
of life and so of avenging it. 
"Disappointment made him bitter. Revo-
lution armed him." 
Antipov turns up in the novel under a new identity and a new 
name, Strelnikov, as a leader of the Red Army forces in the Urals. 
Zhivago is arrested while wandering on the railway line by some Red Army 
men who believe him to be a spy. He is brought to Strelnikov, who realises 
that a mistake has been made and that Zhivago has been taken for somebody 
else. Strelnikov tells him that he will be freed, but asks him why he 
happens to be in this remote part of the Urals. Is he by chance the heir 
of the owners of the local factories? Zhivago admits that "his wife was, 
indeed...but what has this to do with it?" He has come to the Urals to 
find peace in the wilderness. Strelnikov presses Zhivago, asking him why 
he has not joined the Red Army, since he is a doctor.

"After all, you are a doctor, an Army doctor 
at that, and this is war-time. This concerns me 
directly. A deserter.. .The Green Partisans are 
also looking for quiet in the forests. What is your 
reason for not being in the Arny7?" 
Zhivago: "I was wounded twice and invalided 
out of the Army" 
Strelnikov/Antipov: "And now, I expect, 
you will produce a certificate from the People's 
Commissariat of Education or from the People's 
Commissariat of Health to attest that you are a 
completely dependable Soviet citizen, a sympathiser, 
and politically reliable. This, my dear sir, is 
the Last Judgment on earth. Beasts of the 
Apocalypse, winged and sword-bearing, are roaming 
about and not sympathising and politically reliable 
doctors. But I have told you already that you are 
free and I shall not go back on my word. But this 
is only for this time. I feel that we shall meet 
again and then the conversation might turn out 
differently. Be on your guard." 
The threat does not affect Zhivago, and he answers: 
"I know all you are thinking of me. From 
your point of view you might be quite right. The 
debate into which you are trying to draw me, I have

been carrying on all through my life with an imaginary 
accuser and, you will admit, I have had plenty of time 
to come to a conclusion of sorts. Allow* me to go if 
I am indeed free and, if I am not, dispose of me. I 
do not have to justify any of my actions to you." 
The two men part at this point and the significance of their 
encounter only becomes evident much later in the course of the narrative, 
when the second meeting between them takes place in the same area many 
months after the first. 
Zhivago has, in the meantime, become the lover of Antipov's 
abandoned wife. He has been kidnapped by Red Partisans and has gone 
through the most cruel and inhuman campaign ever fought in the Russian 
Civil War, that of the Siberian Partisans. After his return to the Urals, 
in a fit of despair he has let the woman whom he loved go away to the Far 
East in order to save her from possible political complications in which 
he might become involved. He lives alone in the house where they had 
been happy together, and there he meets Strelnikov/Antibov again. 
Strelnikov's position has also changed in the meantime. Like so many 
of the ex-officers employed in the Civil War as defenders of the Soviet 
power, he was denounced As a traitor and a price was put on his head. He 
went into hiding in the forestsj but is hounded down and, as a last resort, 
cones to the lonely house inhabited by Zhivago. The meeting of the two 
men marks the highest point of the drama in which they are involved. 
They establish a kind of brotherhood which calls to mind the last scene 
in Dostoevsky's "Idiot," the scene in Rogozhin's house near the corpse

of Nastasia Filipovna. Strelnikov shoots himself in the night, and 
Zhivago remains alive to go back on a long trek through Russia to Moscow, 
where he vegetates for a few years as a kind of free-lance educationalist 
and then ends up an intellectual tramp, an outcast of a society whose 
standards he cannot accept. 
The contrast between the two characters -- Zhivago and Strelnikov/ 
Antipov -- is the central ideological theme of the novel. It is the 
contrast between the "obyvatel," who possesses the qualities of heart 
necessary to do the microscopic good of which alone he feels that man is 
capable in this world, and the "activist" or fanatic. Both perish in the 
social turmoil ruled by laws which have nothing to do either with the 
emotions and the common-sense of Zhivago, or the high ideals and the 
stilted theories of Strelnikov/Antipov. Pasternak leaves us in no doubt 
where his sympathies lie in the contest between these two characters. 
Speaking of Antipov and his like earlier in the novel, he says: 
"For them, transitional periods, worlds in 
the making are ends in themselves. They are not 
trained for anything else, they don't know anything 
else. And. do you know why there is this incessant 
whorl of never-ending preparations? It's because 
they have no specific natural talents, they are 
not gifted for anything. Man is born to live, 
not to prepare for life. Life itself -- the gift 
of life -- is such a breathtakingly serious thing --
so why substitute this childish harlequinade of 
adolescent phantasies, these schoolboy escapades?"

Because of this talent for life Zhivago is loved, by all those 
to whose happiness he has been so tragically impotent to contribute. 
There is no selfish egotism in this man, as Pasternak shows. Weak and 
doomed to failure as he might appear when judged by the results of his 
ventures, his hero, the great "superfluous man," is the bearer of that 
tolerant, merciful attitude towards other human beings on which alone a 
human society not doomed to self-destruction can be founded. It is in 
the poetry at the end of the volume that this point is made most clearly. 
These twenty-five poems are, in a sense, the most important part of the 
work. Taken by themselves, however, they would have been only samples of 
personal, erotic and devotional lyric. By attaching them to his one 
hundred and forty thousand-word novel, Pasternak demonstrates the live 
connection of these poem with at least one possible set of individual 
human circumstances: those of his hero's life. 
Who are the people to whom Pasternak is sending his message, 
and whom the Soviet authorities are now so eager to prevent hearing it? 
TtAr are neither Communist "activists" nor revolutionaries who would 
rise up in arms in order to overthrow the Soviet regime and, in this 
sense, any accusation that the novel is "counter-revolutionary" is 
absurd. The people to whom Pasternak appeals are the Russian "obyvatel" 
of our days, mainly intellectuals and also the small, unimportant people 
who neither join actively in Party and Government campaigns nor resist 
them actively; and who, by their very passivity, preserve a certain 
degree of integrity of judgment and of emotional spontaneity. Such

U.S.S.R., have been taught to believe for the last 40 ylars that they,are 
in every respect inferior to the selected active fighters for a better 
society. In the official view, those who dare tC fight for social ideals 
may perish when they go wrong, but they have nevertheless led a conscious, 
purposeful life and they are far above any loyal and well-intentioned 
"obyvatel." The latter is destined for ever to remain a mere object of 
political action and it is his duty patiently to endure every discomfort 
and to acojuiesce in the praise with which the "activists" reward their 
own efforts for the establishment of general happiness. 
� 
It is to this mass of passive sufferers, and mainly to those 
whose passivity is intentional, that Pasternak addresses his message. 
He does not urge them to activity, to an organized resistance, of which 
they are probably not capable. What he does is to instil in them a 
sense of dignity'ariduperiority over the "activists," a superiority 
which 116 claims for his hero and of which he himself is so justifiably 
conscious. 
But; although-in no vulgar sense subversive, the novel certainly 
contains a most devastating criticism of the very foundations of official 
Soviet enthusiasm. The real danger it presents to the regime is that it 
destroys the position of moral superiority of the political "activists" 
and restores the confidence of those who are seeking nothing more than 
their right to love nature and to follow in their actions the inclinations 
of their heart. The compelling power of Pasternak's argument is not based 
on any theoretical view, but on a direct poetical Vision of Soviet society 
and of the mechanism by which its ideological foundations are maintained. 
PASTERNAK'S "DR. ZRIVAGO" - 29 - 
In a scene towards the end of the novel, two friends of Dr. Zhivago, 
Dudorov and Gordon, are talking, and one of them whohas just completed 
his first stay in a concentration camp and has been restored to his 
position as a university teacher explains how grateful he is to his 
G.P.U. interrogator and to his experience in prison and in the camp for 
having helped him to grow in stature. Pasternak describes Zhivago 'S 
reaction: 
"Dudorov's reasoning appealed to Gordon 
precisely because it was so hackneyed. He nodded 
in sympathy and agreed with everything. Dudorov 
said. He was touched by the very triteness of 
Dudorov's words and thoughts, and he took the 
second-hand nature of these copybook sentences as 
a sign of their human universality. Dudorov's 
virtuous words were in the spirit 
and it was just because they were 
so transparently sanctimonious, 
revolted by them. A man who is 
idealises his bondage. 
This is 
of the times, 
so pre-ordained, 
that Zhivago was 
not free always 
how it was in the 
Middle Ages and the Jesuits always made play with 
it. Zhivago could not stand the political mysticism 
of the Soviet intelligentsia which was the height 
of its achievement, or, as they would have said in 
those days, the spiritual ceiling of the epoch. 
"I found it painful to listen to you, Dudorov, when

It is hardly probable that such literary bureaucrats as Surkov 
could understand and estimate all the dangers Pasternak's novel presents 
for the ideological foundations for the regime. But they must instinc.;.-
tively realise that once a work of art of such spontaneity has reached 
the public, they will not be able to look their readers in the eye when 
repeating the hackneyed conventional phrases with which they fill their 
writings. The situation is made even more complicated by the well-known 
tendency of the Russian reader to identify himself with a literary type, 
sometimes without a shadow of justification. How many junior lieutenants 
of the Red Army have thought of themselves as Prince Andrey of "War and 
Peace"? How many passive, lazy, submissive, forever frightened "obyvatels," 
having read "Dr. Zhivago," Will identify themselves with Pasternak's hero 
and become less manageable through having their self-respect and human 
dignity restored to them, as more than one hundred years ago Gogol tried 
to do for the oppressed and humiliated of his day in "The Overcoat"?

GYORGY LUKACS: HUNGARY'S HERETICAL MARXIST 
By Paul Landy 
(Mr. Landy, one of the writers who left Hungary after that 
country's unsuccessful 1956 independence uprising, has 
written numerous articles on Eastern European affair's.) 
Hungary's famous Marxist theoretician, writer and philosopher 
Gyorgy Lukacs, is one of the best examples I know of what happens to 
Communist subjects whose thinking ranges too far from the party's ideo-
logical position at any given time. 
This aging, internationally known scholar, who was exiled to 
Rumania after the Hungarian uprising, recently was denounced anew because 
he refused to recant his "revisionist" ideas concerning the rights of 
individuals in a Marxist state. 
Specifically, Lukacs was attacked for making "wrong" statements 
about the Hungarian anti-Soviet rebellion of 1956 and for harboring 
various views on Marxism not in keeping with the party's interpretation. 
As an object lesson to those intellectuals who still imagine 
that a certain amount of free thinking is permitted in Communist-ruled 
countriess Lukacs1 experiences are particularly noteworthy. 
Now in his mid-seventies, Lukacs' career has embraced the whole 
period of Soviet Communism. A scholarly student of both Marxism and 
literature who has produced a number of works on both subjects, he was

GYORGY LUKACS: HUNGARY'S HERETICAL MARXIST - 2 - 
commissar in his country's short-lived 1919 Communist regime and, more 
recently, was Minister of Culture during the administration of Imre Nagy. 
Never a strict conformist to narrow party concepts, Lukacs was often at 
logger-heads with Marxist theorists in the Soviet Union, where he lived 
for a number of years. 
Perhaps because he was so highly regarded by European students 
of Marxism, Lukacs escaped open attack by reigning Communist officials 
until the upsurge of Hungarian resistance to Soviet rule in 1956. 
Regarded by some as the spiritual father of the Petofi literary 
group which helped spark the popular uprising in Budapest, Lukacs ex-
pressed views' about that movement which he has consistently refused to 
renounce, despite the party's determined efforts to force him into con-
fessing his past "errors." 
Inquisitors of the current Kadar regime, apparently on Soviet 
orders, have attacked the venerable philosopher for insisting that the 
Hungarian freedom revolt was a. genuine revolution, and not, as the regime 
claims, a counter-revolutionary plot sponsored by fascist or "imperialist" 
agents. They were particularly infuriated by Lukacs' statement, in October 
of 1956, that "real democracy, embodied in revolutionary youth, is capable 
of sweeping away the remnants of Stalirism. The enhancing of democratic 
freedom ad self-autonomy is the real basis for determining the Hungarian 
road to socialism." 
For expressing such heretical views, and because he was also ,a 
member of the Nagy government, Lukacs was exiled to Rumania along with 
Hungary's freedom premier and other associates.

GYORGY LUKACS: HUNGARY'S HERETICAL MARXIST 
- 3 - 
Although spared the death penalty imposed later on Nagy, General 
Pal Maleter and other leaders of Hungary's uprising, Lukacs was brought 
back to his homeland in 1957 and given an ultimatum to recant his views 
and lend his support to the regime's activities. 
Lukacs' refusal to cooperate was followed by a series of ideo-
logical attacks in the party press and the imposition of whet can only 
be described as "internal exile." Whether or not Lukacs has been under 
actual house arrest, as reported, he is obviously being treated as a 
traitor to the Communist state. His future, barring a pressured confession, 
is no more promising that that of any other Communist subject who has 
been branded as a revisionist. Revisionists, of course, are those who 
refuse to accept every Communist party ideological pronouncement as un-
questionable truth. 
In the field of literary criticism, Lukacs' belief that "the 
task of Marxist science is to consider literary works objectively" is 
anathema to those Soviet and satellite leaders who have condemned Boris 
Pasternak and other writers for committing the crime of thinking for 
themselves. The Hungarian philosopher has been subjected to a particularly 
sharp series of attacks for rejecting the party's right to control litera-
ture and for daring to state that Lenin himself had no such permanent 
intention. 
Ironically, the dilemma of Communism's official spokesmen has 
been intensified because, in spite of the campaign to discredit his views, 
Lukacs is still admired and respected by individual intellectuals through-
out the Soviet bloc.

LET THE AUDIENCE DECIDE: 
(A Hungarian Dramatist's Conclusion About Theatrical Propaganda) 
By Janos Torok 
(Mr. Torok, a young playwright and director who was intimately 
associated with Hungarian theatrical life for six years, left 
Hungary after his country's unsuccessful 1956 freedom revolt.) 
I entered the Hungarian theatrical field in 1949 -- the year 
the Communist regime nationalized all the theaters which until then had 
operated under private management. Materially, nationalization benefited 
our theatrical people. The regime poured money into the theater. There 
was no unemployment among us. Theaters were opened throughout the 
provinces, in towns that had never before had a permanent, resident 
theatrical troupe. These provincial theaters were fully staffed, which 
meant security for actors and actresses who had grown accustomed to a 
, precarious existence between jobs. The pay was good -- as a director, 
I earned between six thousand and seven thousand forints per month, or 
nearly ten times as much as the average laborer. And two of those twelve 
months were for vacation, with full pay. 
We were important to the Communist regime -- state funds were 
lavished upon us. Half a million forints was not too great a sum to 
spend on the stage sets for a single play. A playwright who was com-
missioned to write a new work would receive an advance payment of thirty 
thousand forints, sometimes more, against his potential royalties. Even

SIND 
without a specific commission, he could apply to the Writers' Union 
for the loan of a sum like ten thousand forints, which was provided with-
out interest and deducted in easy instalments from his future income. 
If the playwright wanted to work in the quiet of the country, the 'Union 
would see to that too -- arranging minimal rates at one of the several 
luxury retreats set aside for the "new aristocracy." 
The theater was a� spearhead of Communist propaganda. That was 
why we belonged to the "net aristocracy." Consider what this meant in 
terms of practical economics. A ticket for the best seat in a Budapest 
theater cost eighteen forints -- the rates of admission were deliberately 
kept reasonable, to encourage attendance. It cost the management thirty-
six forints per seat to raise he curtain each night. In view of the 
plays we were presenting, a' theater would lose fourteen thousand forints 
per performance-- and continue night after night. Our theaters were' 
operating at a loss. 
The principal ingredient of a theatrical production is a' play. 
But the playwright was operating at a loss too -- a loss of integrity 
and individuality. The substantial advance he received was for a play � 
written to order. Here is how it worked: the leaders of the Writers' 
Union, or the manager of a theater, would suggest the theme for a play. 
Union leaders and theatrical managers, if not Communist Party members I 
themselves, were responsible to the Party and acutely responsive to the' 
Party line. The manager of one theater at which I worked in Budapest 
was a former trade union leader, qualified for this post only because he 
had taken part in amateur theatricals. In other words, he was not qual-
ified at all, except as an acquiescent supporter of the regime. The play

proposed 'by such a figurehead had to be written fast -- while the theme 
he suggested-was still politically valid. The most successful play-
wright was the lone. who could turn out a play overnight, or in a week's 
time. Otherwise the play-night not be accepted, much less produced -- so 
rapidly did the Party line change. 
The fact is that a playwright's economic security depended upon 
his political versatility� the skill and speed with which he could 
custom-tailor the desired product. It was hackwork. 
Some will argue that many plays in the theaters of the free 
world too, by and large, are tailored to suit the public taste. This 
misses the point. Under our system, plays were written to suit the offi-
cial taste. A direbtor and his cast would struggle to breathe vitality 
into... the script they were given. Then the entire Party secretariat would 
appear at the dress rehearsal �.and the subsequent comments might delay 
an opening night for an entire week, while adjustments of script and 
presentation were made. 
A theatrical performance, anywhere, is a dynamic thfng -- adjust-
ments are always made, both:Ibtfore and after the opening night. An audi-
ence fails to grasp the meaning of a piece of stage business -- you adjust 
the gesture or the scene to sharpen its dramatic truth. A line of dia-
logue, which you thought so telling, falls flat -- you rewrite it. But 
we were doing, the opposite., Let the audience decide? We were adjusting 
dramatic truth to official4ruth. The bureaucrat's criticism replaced the 
weight of audience response. -And so, when we presented our glittering, 
expensive, custom-built fabrications, the spectators -- whose taxes paid 
for the subsidized theater -- stayed away.

What 'happened in Moscow determined political validity in capitals 
like Budapest -- and these capitals were always behind the Moscow trend, 
which veeed without warning. Often in disgust a playwright dropped his 
efforts at originality and turned to adaptations of Soviet plays. . Such 
adaptations were safer to produce, and theater managers accepted them 
somewhat more readily than they accepted Hungarian originals. Adaptation 
of a Soviet play for stage or radio -- this was especially well paid. 
It did not matter that Hungarian audiences were largely in-
different to such Soviet exports. They were by no means indifferent to 
the real merit of Russian dramatic art, which at its best is truly great. 
The dazzling Moscow theatrical company, like the Moscow ballet, won wide 
enthusiasm in Budapest. The classics of the Russian stage, presented as 
accomplished Soviet troupes present them, draw large audiences everywhere. 
But Soviet propaganda plays, however well adapted, and staged, cannot hold 
a Hungarian audience. 
On the screen and on stage we saw the heroics of the Bolshevik 
Revolution as that revolution is now officially portrayed -- the guerilla 
warfare, the triumph of partisan elements over organized military might. 
Hungarian authorities distributed free tickets to trade unions, to youth 
groups, to university students, to students at the Dramatic Arts Academy 
and the Institute of Cinematographic Arts. 
I don't suggest that nobody used those free tickets, even though 
theaters in Budapest were half-empty when propaganda plays and films were-
shown. Seeing those plays and films, students and young workers learned 
the tactics of street fighting -- and applied the lesson to'advantage dur-
ing the uprising. 
1. 
LET THE AUDIENCE DECIDE! - 5 
I have sometimes been asked why so many Hungarian theatrical 
personalities, individual artists who unlike myself took no active part 
in the revolt and were not sought by the hated secret police, left Hungary 
when the opportunity for flight came. 
There is no question about the privileges we had in Hungary--
we were among the elite. I guess those of us who left, regardless of 
whether we had fought in the streets or not, simply did not want to be 
puppets in an official showcase any longer. We were tired of the subter-
fuge required of those who wanted to strike even the slightest note of 
originality and were willing to let the audience decide. We had enough 
of doctrine instead of dramatic art. We wanted a chance to be ourselves, 
professionally and personally. 
I don't want to draw a picture of pure idealism. I imagine 
each of us wants to succeed in his field, be well paid again and enjoy 
public prestige-- I know I do. Whatever the country we are in, it is 
clearly not going to be easy. For stage or radio or television, one has 
to learn the language of the audience and the practices of the profession. 
That can be done. Hungarian actors and directors and writers have achieved 
success abroad in the past. Success or not, we want a chance to show what 
we can do -- and let the audience decide.

LITERARY OMENS IN EASTERN EUROPE 
By Paul Landy 
(Mr. Landy is a former Budapest writer and editor who left 
Hungary after his countryts unsuccessful 1956 freedom,re-
bellion and now makes his home in Austria. He has written 
numerous articles about current conditions in Eastern 
Europe.) 
Gradually, almost unnoticed as yet but promising to become pro-
foundly significant, a new organization is taking shape in Eastern Europe. 
It is a sort of "Council for Mutual Cultural Assistance" which, with its 
sub-committees and inconspicuous communiques, bears a certain resemblance 
to the well-known Communist Council of Mutual Economic Assistance. Its 
undeclared but recognized purpose is to stifle and channelize intellectual 
ferment, to set the tone and pace of cultural development -- and to decide 
the measure of freedom to be allowed in the creative arts. 
What seemed to be solitary developments in the field of so-
called "cultural exchangel." have now become part of an emerging pattern. 
The meeting of Soviet and satellite historians in East Germany last year, 
for example, was followed in quick succession by conferences of Communist 
architects, film and theater experts, representatives of the entertainment 
industries, jazz composers, circus and variety show directors. The 
communique issued after the Prague conference on entertainment and jazz, 
on October 29, 1958, called on Socialist musicians "to compose songs for 
the people which are imbued with the spirit of our Socialist present."

The visits of writers and cultural delegations to other Bloc 
countries have set a hitherto unprecedented pace. In one recent ten-
month period, for instance, 12 official delegations, seven groups of 
artists and 370 cultural experts visited Soviet Russia from Hungary alone. 
Additionally, East German and Czech cultural functionaries have lectured 
Hungarian artists and writers on the lofty ideals of Socialist realism. 
In 1959, from all indications, the output of publishing com-
panies will be more tightly coordinated than ever before. Soviet, East 
German, Hungarian and other Communist-controlled countries have arranged 
for scores of joint publications and for the "comparing, exchanging and 
coordinating" of publication lists in advance. These measures are in-
tended to repair the cultural facade of the Communist bloc, which was 
cracked by disintegration in the post-Stalin period. 
Hungary, perhaps better than any other country, demonstrates 
the interdependent relationship between "brotherly criticism" by Soviet 
spokesmen and the internal anti-intellectual drive. 
Recently, in a review of Hungarian theatrical life, the Moscow 
Literary Gazette warned that "no good can come for the building of Com-
munism from such plays as "Teahouse of the August Moon" (which proved 
highly popular with Budapest audiences) or from the decadence of French 
existentialist plays." The Moscow critic added: "Some Hungarian 
theatrical workers are kow-towing to the decadent American theatre and 
are full of aamiration for the art of Broadway."

Somewhat later, Elet es Irodalom interviewed Balint Magyar, the 
famed director of the Theater of the Army. Magyar defended his presenta-
tion of non-Communist plays by explaining that "our program expresses the 
ideals of humanism." Party critics immediately attacked Magyar's stand 
and charged that the Theater of the Army was not worthy of its name. As 
a result, three Budapest theater directors, including Balint Magyar, and 
five directors of provincial theatres were fired. Hungarian theaters 
now play heavily-subsidized propaganda plays, such as "Blindfolded," 
which concerns a young student who "turned against his own class during 
the counterrevolution." 
The recently-published Communist cultural directives reaffirm 
that no totalitarian society can tolerate free expression. The general 
dilemma of creative artists is that of conforming to a myth of unknown 
proportions, which is commonly called "socialist realism." Ever since 
Maxim Gorki coined the term in the early thirties, Communist theorists 
have been arguing and differing as to the precise meaning, and content 
of these two vague words. There is still no clear cut general definition 
of whether they denote a method, trend or theory. But every "apparatchik" 
seems to know what socialist realism is not. 
In theory at least, writers, painters and playwrights are 
supposed to be their own censors. But the State, which has all the 
printing and publishing facilities, has built up an elaborate structure 
of control to make sure there are no slips. A writer can write and 
submit any manuscript. Its publication, however, depends on the opinion, 
first of the trained copy-reader, then on officials in the Ministry of

Culture and the Party's Agit-Prop Department. The same applies to all 
aspects of the creative arts. 
Recently, the Party also criticised the Fund of Creative Arts; 
which buys paintings. This organization bought: almost exclusively, 
landscapes and still life, paintings and drawings which "are permeated 
with naturalism and imliressionism." Later.,- Nepszabadsag rebuked the 
School of Modern. Arts, where there are merelY 11 Party members out of 
150 students. The young painters were accused of indulging in anti-
realistic experiments. 
"The Party does not demand that every writer create in the ' 
spirit of socialist realism," Communist cultural directives specify. 
"But it cannot tolerate a literature which advocates hopelessness, dis-
illusionment, paralyzes the thinking of the people or nurtures nation-
alist, chauvinist and. bourgeois remnants in the minds of the people." 
The choice of subject or approach, therefore: is limited and the indi-
vidual artist is at the mercy of the Party's control-organs. 
There are varying penalties for deviation from the approved 
line. Some offenders are merely rebuked, such as the promising young 
essayist, Mihaly Suekoesd, who wrote an enthusiastic introduction to a 
Hemingway novel: but forgot to point out "the author's ingrained pessimism 
and decadence;" or Gyula Illyes, the greatest living poet of Hungary, who, 
ea 
after a silence of two years, published a slender volume of :his trans-
lations of Chinese poems. He was reprimanded: however, becalle neg-
lected to praise the "new China" in his introduction and because he failed 
to include works by Communist poets.

Other offenders are fired, such as Tames Toeroek, a young and 
too original Radio Budapest script writer: and Geza Hegedues, director 
of a firm which dared to publish the poems and essays of "compromised" 
authors. 
Some, such as Endre Gellert, Kossuth prize-winning director of 
the National Theatre, who committed suicide in September of 1958: cannot 
endure the intolerable strain of Communist censorship. But the majority 
of those who can be called truly creative artists, while forced to assume 
a cooperativeexterior: continue to think and dream in private, hoping for 
a future time when they can work and produce as self-respecting individuals.

Recent visitors to the satellite capitals of Eastern Europe have 
been surprised to find excited crowds lining up to buy tickets for perform-
ances of non-Communist films, plays and musicals. 
Communist officials, however, have their own reasons for permit-
ting this seemingly paradoxical state of affairs. 
For one thing, satellite leaders apparently feel that the grant-
ing of minor entertainment concessions is a relatively harmless way of 
allowing the people an escape valve for their pent-up irritation and 
boredom. 
Members of the Communist ruling apparatus, despite their in-
sistence that "all is calm and under control," seem to realize that the 
boredom which appears to be an unavoidable accompaniment of the party's 
dictatorship must be prevented from developing into a more serious type 
of social unrest. 
There is boredom with party jargon, boredom with the disparity 
between word and deed, boredom with the whole heritage of a Communist 
decade. The satellite regimes appear to be trying to counter this sense

of irritation and isolation from the rest of the world partly by economic 
concessions and partly by a more liberal attitude toward popular entertain-
ment. 
Communist officials, however, are finding that a solution for 
their self-created problem is far from simple. 
An impressive list of facts points up the inherent dilemma of 
entertainment circles in the Communist states. Plays and films which ' 
receive official praise and recognition have proved to be flops, while 
films and theatrical products condemned for their "petty-bourgeois and 
decadent tendencies" have had popular runs. In Poland, out of a total 
of 3,400 motion pictur,e theaters, only 96 have been profitable. In 
Hungary: 300 film theaters were on the verge of closing until a 30 per-
cent increase in the price of tickets and a system of government sub-
sidies saved them. In Bulgaria, the biggest box-office successes have 
been the locally produced -"Legend of Love," "Year of Love" and "On A 
Little Island." However, these very films were censured by the Party's 
Central Committee for "undermining Communist ideology: distorting and 
wrongly representing the character of the people's revolutionists." 
What, on the other hand, has been the fate of works rich in 
Communist ideology? 
Some Hungarian provincial theaters which tried to conform with 
party guidance and filled their repertoires with Soviet productions and 
other straight propaganda plays finished their seasons in virtual bank-
ruptcy. The National Theater of Miskolc/ largest provincial town in

Hungary, played consistently before houses a quarter or half-filled during 
the last season. On one occasion only seven theater-goers turned up for 
a performance of "One Night" by Gorbatov. The Kecskemet Theater finished 
its season with a 50,000 dollar (one million forints) deficit. The 
National Theater of Gyor was given high official praise for its "excellent 
performances of Soviet and Czech plays." But the box-office results were 
so appalling that the manager resigned in the middle of the season. This 
theater went bankrupt despite heavy subsidies. 
Conversely, those theaters and playhouses in Hungary and Poland 
whose managerG bowed to popular demand have played to full houses. In 
Poland, 19 modern "western" plays had successful 1958 runs. In Hungary 
the plays of Tennessee Williams, Thornton Wilder and John Osborne, as 
well as pre-war operettas and light musical comedies, are unrivalled as 
box-office hits. 
Party spokesmen have repeatedly scolded directors of cultural 
centers and theaters for saying "we go bankrupt with modern Socialist 
plays, for works with topical themes can be neither artistic, nor suc-
cessful, so let's turn back to bourgeois entertainment." 
The University Playhouse in Budapest has tried both ways. A 
series of shows about revolutionary songs and poets were producd for 
small audiences. The next program concentrated on popular folk songs 
and a recital of Burns' poems. As Nepszabadsag remarked, the directors 
"avoided with painful cautiousness the modern Soviet and Hungarian 
Socialist works, assuming that in doing so they could avoid the empty
