 Strength and Prospects of Pol Pot's
 Democratic Kampuchea Forces
 Key Judgments          We estimate that Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea (DK) forces currently
 consist of 13 "divisions" totaling from 30,000 to 35,000 troops. This is a
 reduction of at least 25,000 from our estimate of the DK main forces at the
 time of the Vietnamese invasion in December 1978 but a substantial
 increase over our estimates of their strength in late 1979, when desertions, 25X1
 casualties, malaria, and malnutrition had decimated their ranks. Our evi-
 dence for all such estimates is limited.
 Recognizing Vietnam's military superiority, the DK forces have chosen to
 operate as guerrillas in units                      although they have 2
 shown the ability to form into larger groups when operationally necessary.
 Some guerrillas operate in the Kampuchean interior, but most DK forces are
 confined to areas along the Thai-Kampuchean border.                25X1
 Because the DK upper ranks-both army and party-are dominated by a
 small clique intensely loyal to Pol Pot, the command and control system is
 highly effectivel                                                  25X2
 5)1
 The DK currently have sufficient small arms to conduct effective guerrilla
 warfare in Kampuchea, but they lack the firepower needed for set-piece
 battles that might challenge the Vietnamese for territorial control.II  25X1
 We estimate the manpower base from which the DK might draw replace-
 ment combat troops to be between 30,000 and 70,000 men, but because of
 disease and injury not all of these would be fit for combat. A continuing
 revulsion against Pol Pot has thwarted the DK leaders' efforts to broaden 25X1
 their recruiting base within Kampuchea.
 25X1
 The DK forces are highly disciplined, well organized, amply supplied, and in
 relatively good physical condition
 Vietnamese militarily.
 They have, however, no prospects of defeating the

 Strength and Prospects of Pol Pot's
 Democratic Kampuchea Forces
 For a few months the DK tried to maintain a conven-
 tional resistance, despite the overwhelming military
 superiority of the Vietnamese, but in May 1979 Pol
 Pot, recognizing the danger and futility of this effort,
 ordered his troops to resume the guerrilla tactics that
 had brought their victory over Lon Nol in 1975. By
 June the DK mainline units had dispersed into battal-
 ion-size units, and by August the increasingly hard-
 pressed troops had begun operating in platoon-size
 units of 25 to 30 men. Later, the squad (10 to 12 men)
 became the basic unit of the DK in its current guerrilla
 organization-although in late 1980 some guerrillas
 formed into larger groups for operations.
 Current Military Situation
 Organization .              reporting
 indicate that most of the DK
 resistance forces are currently organized into at least
 13 divisions.' These divisions appear-in Chinese
 fashion-to have three regiments of three battalions
 each, and we assume
 that each battalion is in turn made up
 of three companies. Manpower levels in all units differ
 according to the local availability of soldiers.
 ' The term division is used in this paper as the DK themselves use it
 and is not intended to reflect actual capability. The DK regulars are
 a guerrilla force whose designated divisions have only a fraction of
 the personnel and equipment usually associated with a conventional
 division. In addition to those units included in our estimate
 indicates that there are two other DK "divisions" active in
 Kampuchea-the "1st" (different from 1st unit listed in table 1) and
 the 9th-but neither of these organizations has a real combat
 capability. These two divisions possibly have no more than 500 men
 each and are involved mainly in intelligence operations and propa-
 ganda work. F-1
 25X1
 DK military organization retains vestiges of the three-
 tiered structure that shaped the DK forces before the
 Vietnamese invasion. Between 1975 and 1979 the
 DK military included: mainline units, constituting a
 national force with an external defense role; territorial
 or regional troops, providing security at the district
 level; and village militia, functioning at the commune
 and subdistrict levels. The current three-tiered struc-
 ture consists of the 13 divisions, the transport corps, 25X1
 and the village militia, whose primary role is to provide 2
 security for the transport corps. These distinctions blur
 in many cases, as when village militia units are inte-
 grated into new battalions of guerrillas or are pressed
 into service to carry food and ammunition supplies.
 25X12
 The DK leaders seem to be trying to rebuild a force 2
 that is even more closely related to the preinvasion 2
 structure. In August 1980 the DK claimed to have 25X1
 formed two 800-man mobile strike units, using troops
 drawn from the 13 divisions. Such strike units would
 constitute a national force, whereas the divisions would
 assume the role of regional troops.0 25X1

 Strength and Disposition. Although our evidence is
 limited, we currently estimate that DK regular forces
 total between 30,000 and 35,000 full-time troops (see
 table 1) dedicated to guerrilla resistance against the
 Vietnamese occupiers. This is at least 25,000 less than

 our estimate of the fighting strength of DK main forces
 at the time of the Vietnamese invasion in December
 1978 but is almost double our estimate of their
 strength in late 1979, when they were decimated by
 desertions, casualties, malaria, and malnutrition
 The DK also have guerrillas who are active in the
 Kampuchean interior and seem to be independent of
 the 13 units listed in table 1. Although the total
 number of such guerrillas is not known, we do not
 believe their level of activity warrants an appreciable
 increase in our estimate of overall DK strengtha
 The majority of the DK forces are in areas along the
 Thai-Kampuchean border. Neither the 13 divisions,
 the other DK troops, nor the DK civilians are in what
 could be considered secure or liberated zones, for there
 are no sizable areas in Kampuchea that are safe from
 Vietnamese operations. Nonetheless, the DK have
 been able to establish bases, grow food, and produce
 primitive weapons in several areas inside Kampuchea

 tubers, and rice-but too little for their needs. Since
 early 1980 the DK have received a monthly average of
 some 2,400 tons of rice, 125 tons of fish, 96 tons of oil,
 and 55 tons of beans. UNICEF and Red Cross rep-
 resentatives provide some of these supplies to DK
 civilians concentrated near the Thai villages of Ban
 Thap Phrik, Ban Nong Pru, and Phnom Chat. The

 been forced to move b       ive Vietnamese swee
 operations, but others
 have successfully resisted even the most intense
 Vietnamese pressure.
 Arms and Equipment. DK forces currently have suffi-
 cient small arms to conduct an effective guerrilla war-
 fare campaign against Vietnamese military forces in
 Kampuchea almost indefinitely. Since January 1979
 China has provided the DK with almost 6,000 tons of
 military supplies, including small arms, rockets, anti-
 tank and antipersonnel mines, mortars, and recoilless
 rifles. Also included have been medicines and surgical
 equipment, uniforms, radios, and bicycles. The PRC
 has furnished a considerable amount of munitions, but
 the DK stocks appear to be too scanty to support
 operations for more than a few months without re-
 supply
 The DK have such crew-served weapons as 82-mm
 mortars and 75-mm recoilless rifles, but because
 they lost most of their heavier weaponry during the
 initial Vietnamese invasion they lack the firepower
 needed for set-piece battles that mi ht challenge the
 Vietnamese for territorial control.
 Pol Pot's forces have supplemented their limited-
 range, small-caliber arms with various forms of primi-
 tive weapons and have used tactics designed to
 heighten their effectiveness. Punji stakes, snares, and
 booby traps have served as deadly adjuncts to DK
 mines, ambushes, and mortar attacks. These weapons
 and tactics have played an important role in reducing
 Vietnamese morale and willingness to fight.
 Logistics Support. The DK-military and civilians
 alike-currently depend almost completely on external
 support. Arms and military supplies come from the
 Chinese, but food-the factor most critical to the
 survival of the resistance forces-comes primarily
 from the stocks of the United Nations World Food
 Program. The DK also grow some foodstuffs-maize,

 Command and Control. One of the most impressive
 features of the DK resistance is the maintenance of an
 effective command and control system. Even when the
 DK had serious problems during the initial months of
 the Vietnamese invasion, their organization retained
 cohesion.
 The DK have been successful at command and control
 because their upper ranks are dominated by a small
 clique intensely loyal to Pol Pot. The members of the
 Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the
 Kampuchean Communist Party also hold powerful
 positions in the army (the one exception is leng Sary).
 For example, Pol Pot, who had been premier, still
 serves as secretary general of the Standing Committee
 and as commander in chief of the army. Son Sen,
 Kampuchea's Defense Minister during 1975-79 and
 still the DK defense minister, concurrently commands
 the DK Eastern Military Region 2 and is secretary
 general of the Supreme Committee of the National
 Army. Finally, Ta Mok,3 Son Sen's deputy com-
 mander, reportedly is the DK chief of the general staff
 and vice chairman of the Supreme Committee of the
 National Army.
 'The DK have divided their forces in Kampuchea into Eastern and
 Western Military Regions. The Eastern Military Region consists of
 all provinces north of the Tonle Sap and Mekong River, with the
 exception of Battambang Province. The Western Militar Re ion,
 commanded by Pol Pot, consists of all other rovincesi

 Recruitment Base. Information on DK recruitment is
 extremely limited, but our calculations indicate that
 the manpower base from which the DK could reason-
 ably expect to draw replacement combat troops num-
 bers between 30,000 and 70,000. We developed this
 range by applying likely high and low attrition rates
 against those Khmer who probably have remained
 loyal to the Pol Pot regime since the Vietnamese inva-
 sion (see table 2, pages 8 and 9).F-1            25X1
 Over the long term, continuing attrition is certain to
 strain the DK recruitment base. We lack the informa-
 tion to calculate DK losses accurately, but in Novem-
 ber 1980 leng Sary revealed that the forces were losing
 50 men per day. leng Sary did not indicate for what
 length of time the DK had been sustaining these losses,
 nor did he differentiate between killed and wounded or
 between combat casualties and losses to disease. If the
 DK had lost 50 men per day over the whole 20-week25X1
 wet season in 1980, the ranks would have been depleted
 by about 7,000 fighters. The DK were avoiding direct
 combat during that period, and we therefore judge that
 most of the losses to which leng Sary admitted prob-
 ably represent the sick and wounded, rather than
 killed. Increased combat would raise the number of

 let
 DK casualties and deplete DK fighting strength more
 seriously.^
 It is also important to note that some of the men in our
 statistically derived manpower base of 30,000 to
 70,000 would be incapable of playing a combat role in
 the DK. The serious consequences of malnutrition
 throughout most of 1979, combined with the resur-
 gence of infectious diseases-specifically malaria,
 dysentery, and respiratory tuberculosis-have reduced
 the number of physically fit Khmer males available for
 combat. In addition, the lack of a medical support
 structure for the DK units would prevent many injured
 men from returning quickly to duty.II
 Women theoretically could play an important role in
 sustaining the DK resistance. As shown in table 2, the
 number of potential combatants for the DK would
 more than double if the DK were to mobilize women.
 Khmer women, moreover, have a strong fighting
 spirit
 sumed the role of DK premier in place of party strong-
 man Pot Pot-whose very name inspires hatred and 25X1
 revulsion in the general Khmer populace. (The DK
 have been trying especially hard to forge military ties
 with Son Sann's anti-Communist Khmer Serai
 resistance forces.)                      25X1
 More recently, Khieu Samphan and other DK leaders
 have embarked on a pointed, though still largely un-
 successful, public relations campaign to refurbish the
 DK image. They now disavow Communism in their
 efforts to unite Kampucheans in an anti-Vietnamese
 crusade. They also claim that the mass killings of   25X1
 1975-79 were actually the work of Hanoi's agents and,
 although admitting that they made some errors before
 being ousted, they contend that these were simply the
 result of inexperience and will not be repeated.
 Although the DK further claim that they have no
 intention of bringing back the same regime that had
 been in power, Pot Pot's power is undiminished. Con-
 sequently, the DK are not achieving the wide popular
 support for which they had hoped, either in
 IT iormat     a roe or
 women is unlikely, However. Only a small number of
 women have heretofore served as combatants, and
 most have fulfilled more traditional roles-helping the
 resistance by transporting food and ammunition and
 cultivating crops to supplement rice supplies.
 The DK probably will have little success in recruiting
 non-Communist Khmer. Some Kampucheans who had
 not been associated with the DK might have come
 under DK control while fleeing before advancing
 Vietnamese forces, but their numbers are probably not
 significant. We also believe that, with the horrors of
 the Pot Pot regime still fresh in the minds of those
 who suffered under it, few of the surviving Khmer
 would be attracted to the DK. The DK's limited
 recruiting success has generally occurred in Khmer
 Rouge concentrations.
 Recognizing that their appeal was limited, the DK
 have taken several cosmetic measures to improve their
 image and broaden their base of support. In December
 1979 they unveiled a "Patriotic and Democratic Front
 of the Great National Union of Kampuchea," which
 sought to unite all anti-Vietnamese Khmer behind a
 banner of Khmer nationalism. That same month,

 Strategy and Tactics. The statements of Pot Pot and
 other DK leaders make it clear that they model their
 25X12
 actions on the blueprint for protracted war found in the
 writings of Mao Zedong. To Mao there were three 25X1
 stages in a successful resistance against an invading
 force: a period of strategic offense and defense, a
 period of strategic stalemate, and a counteroffensive.
 The DK have adapted this framework to their own
 long-term struggle against the Vietnamese and posit
 the following three stages:
 ? Deep Vietnamese invasion that necessitates DK
 defensive rear-guard actions supplemented by guer-
 rilla warfare and static defense.
 ? A Vietnamese defensive posture in the cities and
 along main lines of communication after the termi-
 nal points in the offensive have been reached. The
 DK engage Vietnamese troops along the farthest
 points of the Vietnamese advance but switch a major
 part of their force to the enemy's rear, where they
 base themselves in areas not occupied by the enemy
 and wage extensive guerrilla warfare.

 January-June 1979     Vietnamese defeated DK and occupied main
 towns and lines of communication in Kampuchea.
 DK-controlled areas experienced general depriva-

 civilians was poor as opposing forces skirmished.
 Food shortages began.
 DK resumed fighting. Meager harvest led to
 widespread famine. Malaria, dysentery, and res-

 Attrition due to disease and combat began to
 decline.
 a Most numbers are rounded to three significant figures. The
 individuals may be in Kampuchea or in Thailand.
 b In 1978 each of the approximately 120 districts in Kampuchea had
 one militia company of 60 to 90 men. The 7,200 and 10,800 figures
 are the result of simple multiplication.
 By 1978 each commune and subdistrict had one or two 12-man
 organized DK units. We postulate there were between 1,000 and
 2,000 communes in Kampuchea at that time.
 d For control and administration, the DK relied on five-man
 committees, plus their staffs, at the region and sector levels and
 e We have calculated the families of provincial troops, guerrillas, and
 cadre members by using a factor of four, representing a wife and
 three children. We have not calculated family members for the DK
 mainline troops; most of them were in their teens or early twenties,
 and therefore very few were heads of households.

 of DK losses for the period.

 We estimate that DK cadre members nationwide numbered at least
 5,000 in December 1978.
 ? A counteroffensive, the success of which depends on
 the accumulated strength of the DK, on international
 support, and on changes within Vietnam that would
 reduce the Vietnamese war-waging capability.
 According to Mao, a change in the relative strength of
 the belligerents should occur during each of the above
 stages. Thus, the DK see the Vietnamese as initially
 strong but becoming weakened by casualties, material
 attrition, deteriorating troop morale, economic strains
 and discontent at home, and continued world con-
 demnation. The DK see themselves overmatched at
 first, but gaining strength as they mobilize the Khmer
 people, score successes in guerrilla warfare, and ac-
 quire increased international support.
 Tot) ecret
 Much of the DK strategy-adopting united-front
 tactics, avoiding major confrontation with the Viet-
 namese, and striving for international backing to retain
 their United Nations seat-has been designed to bring
 about this change in strength. Its flaws lie in the
 antipathy of the Khmer people to the DK movement
 and in the fact that, despite the effect of the predicted
 strains of war and occupation, the Vietnamese show no
 signs of weakening in their resolve to maintain their
 hold on Kampuchea
 Tactically, the DK continue to wage a classic guerrilla
 war, employing what they call their "three basic com-
 bat tactics":

 military and civilians and other DK-controlled Khmer probably
 lived under much harsher conditions than the bulk of the Khmer
 population.
 h These attrition rates have been devised to reflect continued DK
 casualties and losses from disease, especially malaria.
 We estimate that children constitute approximately 20 percent of
 the total population under DK control.
 i Field reporting suggests that women constitute as much as 75
 percent of the current adult Kampuchean population. We have used
 this factor in deriving the 83,400 figure.
 ? To interdict communication and transportation lines.
 ? To expand the production and use of all types of
 primitive weapons.
 ? To stage guerrilla raids that result in continuing
 Vietnamese casualties.
 By these means the DK hoped to inflict some 50,000
 casualties on the Vietnamese during the 1980 rainy
 season. Although information on Vietnamese battle
 casualties is sparse, it is clear that the DK failed to
 inflict such high losses
 reports suggest that the Vietnamese suffered as many
 as 200 combat deaths per week, for a total of 4,000
 during the 20-week wet season. Even if a number of
 wounded are added, the DK probably fell well short of
 their 50,000 goal

 Prospects
 At present, the DK-military and civilians-remain a
 sizable, highly disciplined organization that, if pro-
 vided with continued military assistance from the Chi-

 nes                               Ican continue to
 oppose the Vietnamese in Kampuchea. Pol Pot and his
 troops have no prospect, however, for defeating the
 Vietnamese militarily. Moreover, over the long term,
 unless the DK can expand their recruitment base, they
 will face a growing problem of maintaining their mili-
 tary strength as attrition from combat casualties and 25X1
 disease erodes their numbers.II              25X1
