I. COMMUNIST CHINA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS 
In this study particular emphasis is given to the Chinese Communist 
governmental organization for the conduct of foreign relations and the 
training of personnel for foreign assignments, with brief background 
data on Communist China's foreign relations generally, diplomatic rela-
tions, position in the international Communist Bloc, and organs of the 
Communist Party of China which participate in international affairs. 
Communist China's foreign policy is determined either by the 
Political Bureau or the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China (CCP). One of the departments of the Central Committee is the 
International Liaison Department (also known as the Foreign Section 
and covered in greater detail in Part II) which maintains liaison with 
other Communist parties, and directs Chinese Communist participation 
in the international Communist front organizations. The Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Chinese People's Government (CPG) is 
the governmental executive agency which carries out policy decisions 
of the Party, conducting formal government-to-government diplomacy 
with nations having diplomatic relations with Communist China, and 
fostering the establishment of such relations. 
Through its diplomatic and other official installations abroad, the 
CPG maintains cultural and economic contact with the other Sino-
Soviet Bloc nations, and engages in cultural and economic penetration 
of the free world nations which recognize Communist China. Relations 
with other countries of the free world are achieved through so-called 
"people's diplomacy" under which non-official contact is established 
and carried on through Chinese Communist-controlled non-Party and 
non-governmental mass and front organizations dealing with persons 
or organizations in other countries outside of diplomatic channels. 
The Foreign Ministry, through its diplomatic installations abroad, 
affords one avenue through which close contact is maintained with the 
large numbers of Chinese residing abroad, particularly in the countries 
of Asia. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (a government 
organ actually controlled by the United Front Work Department of the 
CCP) provides another means of maintaining contact with Chinese living 
overseas.

Diplomatic establishments as well as other official Chinese Com-
munist organs abroad, such as the New China News Agency, trade 
missions, and Bank of China branches, also provide facilities through 
which Red China covertly collects intelligence, overtly acquires 
political, economic and scientific data, carries out subversive missions, 
and disseminates its propaganda. 
Although many decisions on foreign policy may still be made by 
MAO Tse-tung and the CCP Politburo, CHOU En-lai, as Premier, is 
the top man in the government in the conduct of foreign affairs, and is 
also a member of the Political Bureau and its Standing Committee. 
CHIEN I, Minister of Foreign Affairs, is also one of sixteen Vice 
Premiers, Director of the State Councills Staff Office for Foreign 
Affairs, and a member of the CCP Political Bureau. Of the 16 Vice 
Premiers of the CPG, all are members of the Central Committee of 
the CCP, and 12 of them are also regular or alternate members of the 
Political Bureau. Three of the four deputy directors of the Staff Office 
for Foreign Affairs and two of the five Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs 
are Central Committee members, and the other three Vice Ministers 
are CCP members of long standing who previously served as ambassa-
dors. All important persons in the government organs formulating 
foreign policy and conducting foreign affairs, including those serving 
as ambassadors abroad, are either known or can be presumed to be 
members of the Communist Party of China, wearing two hats at the 
same time, one a Party hat, the other a government hat. 
In free, democratic nations foreign policy reflects public sentiment 
as expressed by freely-elected representatives.In Communist-
controlled nations foreign policy is made by a small group of leaders 
and is based upon the goals and aims of the national Communist Party 
and the long term objectives of international communism. In Com-
munist nations criticism and discussion of foreign policy appear only 
when permitted by those in power, and the press and other forms of 
mass communication are under firm Party control. 
Secrecy is the by-word in all stages of the process of policy forma-
tion in the Communist nations, whose foreign policy is not influenced by 
public reaction or opinion. Their foreign policy moves can seldom be 
determined until they are implemented and then are often incompre-
hensible when judged by Western standards. 
One of the factors in the formation of foreign policy in Communist 
countries about which the least is known is how overt and covert

intelligence is collated and utilized as a guide in decision making. 
Little is known as to which organs of the Party or government sort out 
the mass of information obtained from abroad and then collate and 
analyze it for use by those who establish foreign policy. Party leaders 
who determine foreign policy undoubtedly have access to far more (and 
certainly more accurate) information than the distorted propaganda 
which appears in Chinese Communist publications and broadcasts. 
Few of the leaders of the Communist Party of China have any 
experience in the non-Communist world, and the question arises as 
to whether most of those at the top level of policy making are capable 
of accurately evaluating information pertaining to areas outside the 
Communist orbit. There is also the question of whether those gathering 
and reporting overt and covert information concerning the non-
Communist world, as well as those performing the evaluation and 
analysis functions in Peking, are able frankly and factually to report 
information which might be contradictory to the official Communist 
propaganda line. It is also important to know whether these reporters 
and analysts believe the Communist propaganda line and are impreg-
nated with Communist doctrine to such a degree that their reports and 
analyses are colored or shaped thereby. 
Chinese Communist foreign policy reflects adherence to and 
interpretation of the gospel of Marx-Lenin, shaped to serve Communist 
China's national interest, chauvinistic attitude, a firm belief in Chinese 
racial superiority, and the conviction that it is Chinats destiny to 
become the dominant country in the world. Underlying the Chinese 
Communist posture in foreign relations are its vast and rapidly increasing 
manpower,* an unrelenting control over the Chinese mainland, enormous

natural wealth which is largely undeveloped, appreciable technological 
advances made in the eleven years since 1949, the apparent willingness 
of its leaders to achieve international objectives through the use of 
force of arms, and their almost psychopathic hatred of the nations of 
the West, most particularly the United States. 
A. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS 
The Chinese People's Government (Communist)(CPG) was formally 
established on 1 October 1949. First to establish diplomatic relations 
with the CPG was the USSR, on 3 October 1949. The other Sino-Soviet 
Bloc nations, except for North Vietnam, recognized the CPG between 
that date and the end of 1949 in the following chronological sequence: 
Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary, North Korea, Czechoslovakia, Poland, 
the Mongolian People's Republic, East Germany, and Albania. North 
Vietnam formalized diplomatic relations on 18 January 1950. Yugoslavia 
extended recognition on 5 October 1949, but there was no exchange of 
ambassadors until January 1955. Bloc relations with Yugoslavia became 
strained in 1958, and both the Chinese Communists and the Yugoslays 
withdrew their ambassadors in the summer of that year. The two 
installations are now under charge's d'affaires, but relations have not 
been severed. 
By May 1951 the following thirteen non-Bloc nations had established 
diplomatic relations with Communist China: United Kingdom, Ceylon, 
Norway, Afghanistan, the Netherlands, India, Sweden, Denmark, Burma, 
Indonesia, Switzerland, Finland, and Pakistan. No other nation 
recognized the CPG until Nepal did so in August 1955. Since then, the 
following have extended recognition: Egypt (May 1956), Syria (now part 
of the United Arab Republic - July 1956), Yemen (September 1956), 
Cambodia (July 1958), Iraq (July 1958), Morocco (October 1958), Sudan 
(December 1958), Guinea (October 1959), Ghana (July 1960), and Cuba 
(September 1960). 
Of the ninety-six members of the United Nations (other than 
Nationalist China and the Byelorussian and Ukrainian SSR Is) thirty, as 
of 10 October 1960, recognize the Chinese Communist government. Of 
the eight countries not members of the United Nations, five --
Switzerland, East Germany, North Korea, North Vietnam and the 
Mongolian People's Republic -- recognize the Chinese Communist 
regime, three recognize Nationalist China, and West Germany recog-
nizes neither.

Communist China is not a member of the United Nations or of any 
of the specialized UN agencies (such as UNESCO and ILO), even though 
such affiliation is not contingent upon UN membership. 
On 15 November 1949 CPG Foreign Minister CHOU En-lai asked 
the United Nations to repudiate the representation of China by the 
Chinese Nationalist Government (GRC). On 19 October 1950 the United 
Nations General Assembly, by a vote of 33 to 16, with 10 abstentions, 
refused to seat the Chinese Communist Government in place of the GRC. 
For the tenth time, in October 1960, the General Assembly of the UN, 
by a margin of 42 to 34, with 22 abstentions, voted a moratorium on 
consideration of a Soviet-sponsored resolution calling for debate on 
admission of Communist China to the United Nations. 
As of 30 September 1960 Communist China had embassies in 31 
countries. There are two legations under charges (United Kingdom 
and the Netherlands). The senior official in the Yugoslav embassy 
since late 1958 has been a charge dtaffaires. The ambassador to the 
UAR is also Minister to Yemen. Arrangements were being made in 
October 1960 for the opening of an embassy in Havana. Communist 
China has consular agreements with seven free nations and with nearly 
all of the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations. 
Of the present 30 CPG ambassadors, two (LIU Hsiao, USSR, and 
LI Ching-chliian, Switzerland) are full members of the CCP Central 
Committee, and one (PIAN Tzu-li, India) is an alternate member. 
WU Hsiu-chliian, who was ambassador to Yugoslavia until recalled in 
1958, is also a full member of the Central Committee. 
B. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNIST PARTY RELATIONS 
In the spring of 1920 the Communist International (Comintern) sent 
a mission from the Far Eastern Secretariat of its Executive Committee 
in Moscow to establish contact with CHIEN Tu-hsiu, a professor at the 
National University of Peking, who, with a small group, had founded 
the Society for the Study of Marxism as the predecessor nucleus of the 
Communist Party of China. The Comintern mission included Grigori 
Voitinsky, one of the Russian Far East specialists of the Comintern, 
and YANG Ming-chai, a Chinese who had resided in the USSR. Under 
Voitinskyis guidance the CHIEN group was assisted in organizing a 
political party along Marxist-Leninist lines. In the spring of 1921 the

CHIEN group met in Shanghai and created the League of Communist 
Youth to recruit and train new members, the Comintern having sent 
a Dutch Communist, G. Maring, as instructor for the new party. 
In July 1921 some 12 or 13 leaders of the Communist groups which 
had been formed in various localities met in Shanghai and founded 
the Communist Party of China, with a representative of the Comintern 
among those present. 
From the Third Comintern Congress in Moscow in 1921 until the 
Comintern was replaced by the Communist Information Bureau 
(Cominform), the Communist Party of China was represented at all 
Comintern meetings and congresses and had Chinese members on 
the Comintern Secretariat, Comintern representatives attended all 
important Communist Party of China conferences and congresses, and 
the Party line was set through Comintern representatives directly 
assigned to the CCP. In fact, the Sixth CCP Congress was held in 
Moscow in June-July 1928 under Comintern auspices, N.Y. Bukharin 
being the official Comintern representative at this congress. 
In 1943 the Comintern was "dissolved". In 1947 the European-
oriented Cominform was established. The Communist Party of China 
is not known to have participated in the Cominform or to have had 
representatives on its staff. CCP propaganda, however, supported 
the Cominform decisions and line, such as that which followed the 
attack on Yugoslav "revisionism". After the "dissolution" of the 
Cominform in April 1956 the international Communist movement estab-
lished in August 1958 a publication called Problems of Peace and 
Socialism. Headquartered in Prague with A. Rumyantsev as chief 
editor, it employs representatives of many Communist parties, in-
cluding the CCP, on its staff. It is printed in many other countries 
and languages, including Chinese, as a means of expounding and widely 
distributing the ideology of international Communism, thereby per-
forming one of the functions of the former Comintern and Cominform. 
Today the International Liaison (Foreign) Departments of both the Sino-
Soviet Bloc parties and many of the non-Bloc parties have been made 
responsible for some inter-party relationships. 
To party congresses in any Sino-Soviet Bloc nation and to all 
important national celebrations the parties from all other nations in 
the Bloc customarily send delegations. In addition, the Communist 
parties (legal and illegal) of most non-Bloc nations send representatives. 
For example, Communist Party delegations or representatives from

the eleven other members of the Sino-Soviet Bloc and more than sixty 
other countries or areas attended the 10th anniversary of the founding 
of the Chinese People's Republic in Peking in October 1959. 
WU Hsiu-chilian was among the Party leaders from the Sino-Soviet 
Bloc attending the ninth national assembly of the Cuban Communist 
Party (PSP) in Havana in August 1960. 
In addition, the Communist parties of all nations are sponsors and 
participants in all the international Communist front organizations and 
conferences, Communist China being a major participant in virtually 
all of them and having representation on their executive councils and 
secretariats. Communist China is one of the most active participants 
in all international Communist propaganda campaigns, such as the 
Stockholm Peace Appeal. 
Though not a member of the Warsaw Pact, which includes the USSR 
and the East European satellites, Communist China sends observers 
to most pact meetings, including an assemblage in February 1960 in 
Moscow. Nor is Communist China a full member of the Soviet Bloc 
Council for Mutual Economic Aid (CEMA), although Chinese Communist 
representatives have attended at least some of the CEMA meetings and 
those of some subsidiary CEMA committees. Communist China has 
entered into formal government-to-government agreements with most 
(if not all) of the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations (including North Korea and 
North Vietnam) with regard to trade, customs matters, convertibility 
of national currencies within the Bloc, scientific/technical and cultural 
exchanges, and other matters. In addition to guiding the over-all 
people-to-people diplomacy outside normal foreign ministry channels, 
the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries directs 
the affairs of the friendship associations in Communist China (such as 
the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association) and the relations with China 
Friendship Associations, which are found in all the Sino-Soviet Bloc 
nations.

II. ORGANS OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA 
Foreign policy decisions concerning Communist China may 
originate in the CCP Central Committee but more frequently are made 
by the Political Bureau of that Committee, and specifically by the 
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau. Execution of such policy 
decisions is directed and administered by foreign affairs specialists 
on the CCP Secretariat, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 
government level and through the International Liaison Department 
(also known as the Foreign Section) of the Central Committee whenever 
these decisions concern relationships with other Communist parties 
or international communist front organizations and activities. 
Some other CCP organs are also concerned with certain aspects 
of the conduct of Chinese Communist foreign affairs, but their roles 
are discussed only briefly in this study. 
A. ORGANIZATION DEPARTMENT 
The Organization Department of the Central Committee is 
responsible for party membership and party committees. Party 
committees are found at all levels throughout the party organiza-
tion and the governmental structure. The CCP Committee within 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, for example, administers affairs 
of party members associated with the Ministry, insures observance 
of party discipline, and conducts indoctrination programs. It insures 
the establishment of committees at all levels of the Ministry organi-
zation at Peking headquarters and in embassies and consulates which 
supervise all party activities and members at those levels. Party 
committees are also to be found in all official installations abroad, 
such as NCNA offices and branches of the Bank of China. 
B. PROPAGANDA DEPARTMENT 
The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee directs the 
total domestic propaganda program, internal and external, through the 
party organization, the government organs, the military, and through 
1?unofficial" organizations. Party members responsible for propaganda

Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
activities are found down to the party cell level and in all party com-
mittees. The Propaganda Department and the International Liaison 
(Foreign) Department jointly participate in directing Communist 
China's foreign propaganda program. They work: 
1. With other Communist parties and international Communist 
fronts through inter-party channels; 
2. Through cultural attaches at diplomatic installations; 
3. Through the network of the New China News Agency and 
the Communist-controlled Chinese language press abroad, 
particularly in Asia; 
4. Through the Broadcasting Administration Bureau of the 
State Council and its international broadcasts via Radio Peking; 
5. Through the government Ministry of Culture and ex-
changes of cultural delegations with other countries; 
6. Through the governmental Commission for Cultural 
Relations with Foreign Countries and the "unofficial" Associa-
tion for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. 
Publication and foreign dissemination of propaganda material and ? 
text books for Chinese schools in areas where large numbers of 
Chinese reside overseas, as well as production and distribution of 
propaganda films, come under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of 
Culture, which is in turn controlled by the CCP Propaganda Depart-
ment. As in all Communist-controlled countries, the CCP Propaganda 
program is closely coordinated with Communist China's foreign policy 
and is considered an instrument for implementing the conduct of foreign 
affairs. 
C. UNITED FRONT WORK DEPARTMENT (UFWD) 
Another Central Committee organ engaged in an aspect of foreign 
affairs is the United Front Work Department. Although the major 
responsibilities of this department are concerned with organization 
and control of the non-Communist Party majority on the China main-
land (there are only approximately 13,900,000 CCP members out of 
9

the 650,000,000 total population, or about 1 in every 47), it bears the 
responsibility of winning the loyalty (or at least the sympathy) of the 
14,000,000 Chinese (called hua chtiao)residing outside China, largely 
in Southeast Asia. Working directly through its agents among these 
large communities of Chinese residing overseas and through the 
governmental Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the UFWD 
spreads propaganda and seeks to gain control of Chinese organizations, 
the press, and Chinese schools serving this large number of hua chliao. 
One of the vice chairmen of the United Front Work Department, LIAO 
Chleng-chih, is also chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Com-
mission. In addition to its organizational work among the Chinese 
communities overseas, the UFWD organizes the control of Chinese 
returning to the mainland either as permanent residents or as visitors, 
operates reception centers and hostels in various cities, and directs 
the integration of repatriates into the social, economic, and political 
life of Communist China. 
D. INTELLIGENCE ORGANS 
Foreign intelligence activities are carried on clandestinely through 
agents placed under official cover in diplomatic and other official 
Chinese Communist installations abroad, through illegal agents residing 
in some areas, and through persons traveling or legally residing 
abroad. Intelligence organizations under the CCP Central Committee, 
the government security organs, and the military operate abroad. 
E. INTERNATIONAL LIAISON (FOREIGN) DEPARTMENT (ILD) 
The International Liaison (Foreign) Department under the Central 
Committee of the CCP is similar to departments found in all the Sino-
Soviet Bloc parties and in some of the larger and more important 
Communist Parties in non-Communist nations. In the CPSU central 
apparatus there are two foreign liaison departments under the Central 
Committee. One, the International Department, deals essentially with 
Free World matters. The other is called the Department for Liaison 
with Communist and Workers Parties of the Socialist Countries. Al-
though both are departments, the latter seems to be secondary. Both, 
however, implement policy set by higher Party authority. 
In Communist nations these departments coordinate, implement 
and support on the working level those aspects of foreign policy with

which the party is concerned. They also carry out routine relations 
with other Communist parties and their representatives and may have 
some administrative responsibility for party units and members 
residing or traveling outside the parent country, as well as for co-
ordinating all-party propaganda efforts and exchanging party printed 
materials with other Communist parties. 
These International Liaison Departments are generally limited to 
administrative and liaison functions and implementation of foreign 
policy as made by the Central Committees or Political Bureaus. The 
functions of these departments differ from party to party. For example, 
in one non-Bloc nation with a large Communist party, the Foreign 
Section of the local party was in contact with Soviet and satellite embassies 
and legations, as well as with the Sino-Soviet national friendship societies. 
Liaison with the Communist Party of China was maintained through fre-
quent contact with the Chinese Communist embassy in a neighboring 
country. In one country the Foreign Section handled commercial and 
foreign trade matters with other Communist parties and local party 
front organizations. Although a limited amount of routine CPSU policy 
and instructions flow to other parties through diplomatic channels, 
important matters are handled by direct CPSU contacts with high party 
officials, the Foreign Sections affording a useful channel for communi-
cation and coordination of routine activities. 
Little is known of the organizational structure or functional activi-
ties of personnel of the ILD of the Communist Party of China. Nor have 
personnel of this Party organ been identified except indirectly, through 
the activities in which they regularly engage and through what is known 
of their other past and present official activities and duties. It seems 
obvious that certain key party figures are either assigned to the depart-
ment or can be called upon as needed to serve the Party interests 
carried out by this Central Committee organ. These persons can be 
divided generally into two groups: one concerned with other Communist 
Parties specifically by area, the other with functional matters within 
the scope of the International Liaison Department. 
Chinese Communist sources appear to have avoided carefully any 
reference to the ILD or to those holding key posts in this department. 
In March 1959 a Polish news agency stated WU Hsiu-chtlian was "head 
of the Foreign Section of the Central Committee". Other sources have 
asserted that WANG Chia-hsiang heads this department on the basis of 
his frequent participation in affairs which clearly fall within its scope 
and functions.

WANG Chia-hsiang is a member of the CCP Central Committee 
and a ranking member of the CCP Secretariat, at one time headed 
the General Political Department of the Chinese Communist Army, 
went to the USSR for study in 1925, was particularly active in affairs 
of the Comintern in the 19301s, was ambassador to the USSR from 
October 1949 to March 1951, and served as Vice Minister of Foreign 
Affairs from 1951 until September 1959. Since 1949 WANG has attended 
many congresses of other Communist parties, both of the Sino-Soviet 
Bloc and non-Bloc nations. 
WU Hsiu-chiiian has held diplomatic and foreign service assign-
ments since 1949 and was Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1951 
to 1955, when he was named ambassador to Yugoslavia. He served in 
the latter post until recalled in the fall of 1958 and thereafter was 
named an assistant to the foreign minister. He is considered an expert 
on the USSR and East European affairs, having been one of three 
ambassadors who are also full members of the CCP Central Committee 
since 1956. WU headed the USSR and East European Affairs Depart-
ment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 1949 to 1951. He was 
educated in the Soviet Union (1926 to 1931) and from 1931 to 1949 was a 
political commissar and staff officer in the Chinese Communist armed 
forces. In 1950 he appeared as Communist China's special delegate 
to a meeting of the United Nations Security Council at Lake Success 
to present charges of "American aggression in Taiwan". It would appear 
that his ILD responsibilities concern principally matters involving the 
East European satellites. 
There are a number of other functional and area experts attached 
to and utilized by the ILD. Functional activities include management 
of the compounds and hostels maintained in Peking by the CCP for 
housing visiting members of other Communist parties and adminis-
tering party training schools and classes for students sent to Communist 
China by Communist parties in non-bloc areas, such as Latin America 
and Africa. ILD area specialists probably administer relations with 
Communist parties of specific countries or groups of countries. 
Offices of the ILD are reported to be maintained both in CCP head-
quarters and in the Staff Office for Foreign Affairs of the government 
in Peking. 
Details are lacking concerning the exact role of the ILD in the 
selection and direction of Communist Party of China representatives

who serve on the executive councils and on the permanent secretariats 
of the various international communist front organizations. Each of 
the mass organizations in Communist China (such as the All China 
Federation of Trade Unions, All China Federation of Democratic Youth, 
All China Federation of Women, and All China Federation of Students) 
has an international liaison department which probably has some direct 
relationship with the PAD. Personnel of these departments are almost 
invariably CCP members and are active in their respective international 
communist front organizations (World Federation of Trade Unions, 
World Federation of Democratic Youth, Women's International Demo-
cratic Federation, and International Union of Students). It may also 
be presumed that the Party loyalty of all personnel assigned to the 
permanent secretariats of these international bodies, down to inter-
preters and translators, has been carefully established before their 
assignment. 
Thus the CCP and certain departments of its Central Committee 
play a considerable role in the conduct of foreign affairs among the 
Sino-Soviet bloc nations on a party-to-party basis, through their partici-
pation in international Communist front organizations and propaganda 
campaigns, in the contest for the loyalty of the overseas Chinese, and 
in the collection of intelligence.

III. ORGANS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT 
The constitution of the Chinese People's Government makes pro-
vision for a National People's Congress, made up of more than 12 00 
delegates, elected every four years by lower-level congresses, and 
meeting annually in Peking. This Congress elects a Standing Com-
mittee, consisting currently of a chairman, 16 vice chairmen, a 
secretary general, and a number of secretaries general. The Standing 
Committee meets more frequently and is empowered to act on behalf 
of the Congress between sessions. Under the Standing Committee is 
the State Council (in effect a cabinet), headed by the Premier and in-
cluding 16 vice premiers, all members of the CCP Central Committee 
(12 of whom are also Politburo members). Other members of the State 
Council comprise the heads of government ministries and commissions, 
totaling 55 members. 
Under the State Council there are now six Staff Offices (ei;ht 
until the reorganization in September 19 5 9), one each for Foreign 
Affairs, Political and Legal Affairs, Finance and Trade, Culture and 
Education, Industry and Communications, and Agriculture and Forestry, 
all headed by CCP Central Committee members. Each of the Staff 
Offices has cognizance over a functional group among the 30 Ministries, 
8 Commissions, and 13 Special Agencies, most of which perform 
basically domestic functions. In this study the focus is upon organs 
concerned with foreign affairs, principally the Staff Office for Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Commission for Cultural 
Relations with Foreign Countries, and the activities of other organs 
which implement the conduct of foreign affairs. 
All government officials entrusted with the formulation and 
direction of foreign policy are concurrently members of the CCP 
Central Committee, some also being members of the Politburo, which 
body determines foreign policy. It can be said with reasonable certainty 
that all personnel of importance in the Foreign Ministry, all diplomats, 
and all foreign service personnel in positions of any importance are 
either CCP members or members of the China Young Communist League, 
junior auxiliary of the CCP.

A. STAFF OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
This Staff Office was established in March 1958, the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs up to that time having been directly under the State 
Council and not under any of the other seven staff offices. In 
February 1958 CHIEN I was named Foreign Minister, replacing 
CHOU En-lai, who from 1949 until that time had held the post con-
currently with that of Premier. CHIEN I was also named as director 
of the Staff Office for Foreign Affairs, and three of his four deputies 
in the Staff Office are members of the CCP Central Committee. These 
three deputies are LIAO ChIeng-chih, who has extensive party 
experience in propaganda and organizational work, belongs to a 
multiplicity of national and international front organizations, and has 
been a leader in Communist youth work; LIU Ning-i, who is chair-
man of the massive All China Federation of Trade Unions and a 
participant in many national and international fronts; and KIUNG Yiian, 
who is a former Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and has been active 
in negotiating trade agreements with many other nations. 
Little is known of the organization under the Staff Office for Foreign 
Affairs. It is clear that there are divisions under this staff office. 
HSIUNG Hsiang-hui, head of one of the divisions, was present at the 
time CHEN I, in the capacity of Deputy Premier, visited Kabul and 
signed a treaty of friendship and mutual non-aggression between Com-
munist China and Afghanistan in August 1960. HSIUNG was formerly 
a member of the board of directors of the Association for Cultural 
Relations with Foreign Countries. WANG Hsiao-yun has been referred 
to as the head of another unidentified department of this staff office. 
B. MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MFA) 
Offices of the Ministry were reportedly located on Tung Chiao Min 
Hsiang in Peking, two blocks south of the famous Gate of Heavenly 
Peace. The Ministry headquarters also has been reported to be at 
Wai Chiao Pu Chieh (Ministry of Foreign Affairs Street), Peking. The 
Foreign Ministry and State Council use the Hsin Hua Ting, a small 
pagoda-like building inside the Forbidden City, as a location for 
meetings with important foreign visitors. 
In addition to Foreign Minister CHIEN I, there are five vice 
ministers (there were six up to September 1959, when two were

dismissed; one was appointed in January 1960). There are three 
identified Assistants to the Foreign Minister. 
In June 1958 a reference was made to a General Services Depart-
ment under the Foreign Ministry, although there has been no definitive 
information to indicate what functions it performs. Reference was 
also made in June 1958 to a General Office of the Foreign Ministry, 
but no definition of its functions was made. It is considered likely 
that between them the following known activities are divided: 
1. Maintenance of the world-wide courier system and the 
handling of diplomatic pouches. 
2. Operation of a system of inspection of diplomatic instal-
lations abroad. 
3. Direction of the Cipher Service (Chi Yao Chu 2894/6008/ 
3710), a special department which consists of a corps of career 
communications specialists assigned to the Ministry in Peking 
and to installations abroad. 
4. Responsibility for regulations concerning physical and 
personal security at headquarters and abroad, classification 
of documents, and the safeguarding of classified records and 
documents. 
No separate finance, archives, or communications offices are 
identified; and these functions may fall under the purview either of the 
General Office or the General Services Department. No training office 
has been identified, but the function is probably carried out by the 
Institute of International Relations (see Part IV), which is directly 
related to the Ministry. 
Under the Ministry's organization there are six geographical area 
offices, which may be further subdivided into country desks. There 
are, in addition, six identified functional departments. 
1. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OFFICES 
The six geographical area offices are the First Asian Affairs 
Office (non-Communist States), the Second Asian Affairs Office (Com-
munist States), the West Asian and African Affairs Office, the West 
European Affairs Office, the American and Australian Affairs Office, 
16 
Approved For Releasa448Mialoirplikalig78-02646R000300090003-3 
Approved For Release 1.91MMTW3P1A-02646R000300090003-3 
and the Soviet and East European Affairs Office. Probable areas of 
responsibility are shown in Attachment 1. However, responsibility 
for Greece and Turkey has apparently been placed arbitrarily in the 
West European Affairs Office, although both fall under the West Asian 
and African Affairs Office. The Soviet and East European office was 
referred to as the Socialist States Affairs Office between February 
1958 and September 1959, when the present title came into more common 
usage. It has never been made clear whether the change in title was 
accompanied by incorporation of the Communist nations of Asia (North 
Korea, North Vietnam, and the Mongolian People's Republic) into its 
jurisdiction, but it is believed that these three countries are handled 
under the Second Asian Affairs Office. Recent reference to it as the 
Soviet and East European Affairs Office would seem to exclude the 
three Asian Communist nations from this office's area of responsibility. 
Although little is known of the further detailed breakdown of the 
geographical area offices into desks for specific countries or groups of 
countries, it seems certain that this further subdivision exists. 
Specialists, for example, within the Asian Affairs Office No. 1 are 
concerned with matters relating to (and deal with individuals repre-
senting) nations falling within the cognizance of this office, such as 
Japan, India, and Indonesia. Within the American and Australian 
Affairs Office are to be found individuals considered specialists on the 
United States, others considered experts on Latin America, and another 
group specializing on Australia/New Zealand. 
A distinction must be made between the CCP International 
Liaison (Foreign) Department and the Soviet and East European Affairs 
Office of the Foreign Ministry. The CCP department is concerned with 
relations and liaison with other Communist parties, whereas the area 
office of the Ministry deals with government-to-government affairs 
vis-a-vis the Sino-Soviet Bloc. 
2. FUNCTIONAL DEPARTMENTS 
Identified functional departments are Personnel, Protocol, 
Consular Affairs, Treaties and Law, International Affairs, General 
Services, and Information (or Intelligence). Matters concerning 
personnel administration, records, assignments, and party records 
are probably handled by the Personnel Department. 
The Protocol Department handles matters generally within the 
scope of such departments in other governments. It deals with foreign 
17 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24:  
Approved For ReleaOMMeirtitirra. - P78-02646R000300090003-3 
diplomats and officials stationed in Communist China or visiting there 
and advises (often sending advisory personnel with) Chinese Communist 
delegations visiting other nations and attending international conferences. 
Its officials accompany groups of diplomatic personnel stationed in 
Peking on periodic guided tours of various areas on the mainland. This 
department was reported to have a staff in excess of 700 persons, 
including translators and interpreters. Personnel engaged in public 
relations and reception, including those from the Protocol Department, 
were called by the State Council to a conference in March 1958 and told 
that they were to "perfect themselves in the general line and foreign 
policies of the Party and state". They were reminded that proper 
reception of foreign visitors to Communist China is a "solemn political 
task". 
The Protocol Department is also reported to be charged with 
preparing original drafts of congratulatory messages sent by Chinese 
Communist leaders to various foreign countries and their officials on 
occasions of anniversaries, important meetings, national celebrations, 
etc. Such messages are probably subject to approval by the Foreign 
Minister and the official in whose name they are sent. 
The Consular Affairs Department is concerned with visa matters 
and consular affairs in general, in addition to carrying out the terms of 
consular agreements which have been signed with most (if not all) of 
the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations as well as with a few non-Communist nations 
with which diplomatic relations are maintained, such as Indonesia, 
Burma, and Switzerland. 
The Treaties and Law Department is concerned with consideration, 
formulation and negotiation of treaties, protocols, and formal govern-
mental agreements between Communist China and other nations and with 
matters involving international law. 
The functions of the International Affairs Department are not 
fully known, but they appear to include matters involving strictly govern-
mental aspects of Communist China's participation in international 
conferences (Communist and non-Communist) and international Com-
munist front organizations, as well as assignment of personnel to the 
permanent staffs of these front organizations. In performing its 
functions, this department certainly works in close coordination with 
the CCP International Liaison Department. 
The exact functions of the Information Department (formerly 
referred to as the Intelligence Office) are not known, but from data

Li 1..0 
,r Y 18 1 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
available it appears that one of its duties parallels that of the Press 
Section of the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Information 
Department has a Press Bureau which issues Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs press announcements, deals with foreign press representatives, 
both resident and visiting in Communist China, and supervises the 
admission of foreign correspondents to the mainland. All arrange-
ments for foreign correspondents seeking an audience with govern-
ment officials are handled through the Press Bureau. A Research 
Section has also been identified under this department. The Section 
may monitor foreign press reaction to Chinese Communist foreign 
policy and is probably the receiving and collation point in the Ministry 
for such overtly acquired information. In most of the large Chinese 
Communist diplomatic installations abroad are Investigation and 
Research Sections known to collect overt information and to prepare 
periodic summaries of political, economic, and social conditions in 
the host and adjoining countries, as well as analyses of foreign 
attitudes and reactions toward Communist China and its international 
policies and activities. 
If the Information Department plays any part in the collection 
or collation of covertly acquired intelligence, or the assignment of 
intelligence personnel to posts in diplomatic installations, such a role 
is not evident from evidence now available. The Information Depart-
ment may also act on behalf of the Foreign Ministry in reviewing and 
approving program material bearing on foreign policy before it is 
broadcast on the foreign network of the Broadcasting Administration 
Bureau. 
3. CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS (CPIFA) 
(Chung Kuo Jen Min Wai Chiao Hsueh Hui) 
The CPIFA is not identified as, and is not believed to be, a 
formal part of the organization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; but 
its activities are obviously under the control and supervision of the 
Ministry. It may have functions similar to those found in the foreign 
ministries of other Sino-Soviet Bloc nations. In Poland, for example, 
the Institute of International Affairs has basically the same mission. 
The CPIFA (see Attachment 2) is said by the Chinese Communists to 
be an "unofficial" body, established in December 1949. Its stated 
functions are acquiring reference materials, conducting research, 
writing reports, and making "systematic analyses" of international 
problems. Under the CPIFA there is a working staff which probably 
19 
Approved For Release 100111416061?010000/08a02646R000300090003-3 
Gemetwompogionmemw 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
collects and collates information from current newspapers, clippings, 
editorials, and other printed matter, the files of international press 
services coming into Peking, and the product of the monitoring by the 
Broadcasting Administration Bureau of the radio broadcasts originating 
in the important non-Communist nations. 
It is possible that the CPIFA, in close cooperation with the 
Research Section under the Information Department of the Ministry, 
prepares the daily reviews and analyses of this material, which are 
published and distributed daily to top Party and government officials. 
Trained observers who have visited Communist China have commented 
upon the broad and detailed knowledge displayed by Chinese Communist 
leaders regarding day-to-day occurrences in the outside world. 
Apparently this knowledge is based upon news digests dealing with 
current affairs which are derived from the monitoring of all important 
radio and news sources and the scrutiny of the Free World's daily 
press and periodicals. Other reports have stated that these daily 
digests of foreign news are classified and are given limited circulation 
among the top party and government hierarchy and among senior 
research scientists of the Academy of Sciences in Peking. 
Another important function performed by the CPIFA is its part 
in the conduct of so-called "people's diplomacy" by Communist China. 
Invitations to visit Communist China are extended to Communist Party 
officials of Sino-Soviet Bloc nations and Communist Party leaders in 
non-bloc countries by the Communist Party of China. Invitations to 
heads of Sino-Soviet Bloc governments and chiefs of state or foreign 
ministers of countries with which Communist China maintains diplomatic 
relations are extended through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Chinese People's Government. However, invitations of this nature to 
heads of all other states, to officials of political parties not in power 
in states recognized by Communist China, and to governmental, 
legislative, and other officials of nations with which no diplomatic 
relations exist are most often handled by the CPIFA. A Chinese Com-
munist publication in 1957 described this function as follows: "It (the 
CPIFA) extends invitations to foreign political leaders to visit this 
country and, through personal contacts, helps to promote international 
understanding and friendship." 
HSti Yung-ying has been mentioned as head of a Compilation and 
Translation Department of the CPIFA. HSU, previously referred to as 
Director of the American and Australian Affairs Office of the CPIFA, 
was formerly a research associate with the international secretariat 
of the Institute of Pacific Relations. HUANG Hua, former Director of

aePrimpwrweffliworpipp 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
the West European Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
who was mentioned as chief of the CPIFA Research Office and head 
of the Research Office of the Information Department of the Foreign 
Ministry, was named Ambassador to Ghana in August 1960. Although 
Premier CHOU En-lai is Honorary Chairman of the CPIFA and 
CHANG Hsi-jo, leader in many Chinese Communist front organizations, 
has been reported to be Chairman of the CPIFA, a single report stated 
that the institute is actually directed by CHIIA0 Kuan-hua, one of the 
vice presidents of the CPIFA and an assistant to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. The CPIFA may also engage in long range research and 
analysis of international problems of concern to Communist China. 
Although all the top officials of the CPIFA are members of or 
close collaborators with the CCP, many of the staff members do not 
appear to be Party members, and a large number of the latter group 
at one time resided abroad. Whether there are area and functional 
sub-sections under the CPIFA is uncertain, but it is evident that there 
are foreign area and language specialists at the CPIFA working level. 
References have been made by visitors to China to a "People's 
Diplomatic Research Council", a "Foreign Relations Institute", a 
"China People's Foreign Relations Study Society", a "Foreign Affairs 
Association", and to a "Chinese People's Diplomatic Society". The 
functions assertedly performed by all of these and the personnel said 
to be representing them suggest that these names are simply varying 
mistranslations referring to the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign 
Affairs. 
According to its constitution, the CPIFA can "make suggestions" 
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It has been especially actilm'in 
developing contacts with government officials, particularly legislators, 
of non-Communist countries in campaigns seeking diplomatic recog-
nition of the CPG, and has sought to build closer ties where recognition 
has already been extended. Since 1954 it has played host to lawmakers 
from dozens of free nations. 
That the CPIFA plays a role beyond that which is apparent is 
indicated from the nature of its operations, the contacts which it initiates 
and fosters with leaders of political parties in other nations, and the 
pressures it exerts in "unofficial" negotiations in an effort to bring 
about establishment of formal diplomatic relations with non-bloc nations. 
It was reported in October 1959 that two former officials of the 
Chinese Communist Embassy in Rangoon were employed in the Kunming 
zi

imintspeipipmwommewpmw. 
Approved For RelearMeMitil1reP78-02646R000300090003-3 
office of the Institute of Foreign Affairs (Wai Chiao Hsueh Hui). If 
there is a CPIFA office in Kunming, it is the only one known outside 
the headquarters in Peking. One of the two men reported to be 
assigned to this Kunming office was with the Alien Affairs Section 
of the Canton Public Security Bureau before he was posted to the 
embassy in Burma. It is likely the reference was to the Alien Affairs 
Office of the Kunming Public Security Bureau unless the CPIFA was 
being used as a cover for clandestine activities concerning Burma. 
A "Chinese People's Foreign Research Committee" (probably 
the CPIFA) was reported to be staffed in 1951 by persons who had lived 
abroad, working under the leadership of a small group of Party officials 
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The CPIFA reportedly reads 
and analyzes information from foreign sources and reported its findings 
to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
The CPIFA has access to the translations of the foreign press 
and other data overtly acquired through official Chinese Communist 
installations abroad. It also has access to the results of research per-
formed by the International Studies Institute of the Academy of Sciences. 
It would seem logical that the CPIFA works closely with the Research 
Section of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
but the channels through which the work of the CPIFA is directed are 
not clear. 
Walton A. Cole, editor of Reuters, who spent twelve days in 
Communist China in January 1958, may have been referring to the 
combined product of the Foreign Radio Monitoring Service of the 
Broadcasting Administration Bureau, the CPIFA and the Research 
Section under the Information Department of the MFA when he wrote 
the following, published in the New York Times, 28 February 1958: 
"Superficially, it might seem that the Chinese 
Communist leaders must be in a vacuum regarding 
the day-to-day occurrences in the outside world. 
These occurrences have little or no place in the 
Chinese press or on the radio. But by means of 
intelligently compiled news digests, based in the 
main on the monitoring of all available radio and 
news sources, and by scrutinizing the world's daily 
and periodical press, they are among the best in-
formed individuals on current affairs that I have 
met. The world outside, as seen through these

aimailetouroommemsimi 
Approved For Release 199VOOk%Wi-hD*1812646R000300090003-3 
digests, cannot appear other than topsy-turvy 
when compared with the accounts in the Chinese 
press of the always 'correct' and 'unified' Com-
munist bloc." 
C. OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AND UNOFFICIAL ORGANS CONCERNED 
WITH FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
As in all other countries, there are other instrumentalities of the 
Chinese Communist Government which do not determine foreign policy 
but do have a role in implementation of this policy. Supplementing 
these official organs are a number of unofficial fronts and mass organi-
zations. These official and unofficial organizations fail under three 
general groupings: 1- Trade; 2- Cultural exchanges and propaganda; 
and 3- Relations with foreigners residing in or visiting the China main-
land. Most of the All-China mass organizations, such as the All China 
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), have their international depart-
ments throughwhich they participate in the activities of the respective 
international communist front organizations. 
1. TRADE DIPLOMACY 
Radio Peking broadcast the claim in September 1959 that Com-
munist China had by then established trade relations with 93 countries 
or areas and had concluded governmental treaties or agreements with 
27 of them. It was admitted that 75 percent of the total volume of 
foreign trade in the prior ten years had been with Sino-Soviet bloc 
countries, but gains were claimed in trade with non-Communist nations, 
and it was said that trade with 54 Afro-Asian countries or areas had 
gained 180 percent over 1950, which claim could well be true. In the 
year 1956 Communist China's foreign trade with the East European 
Soviet Satellites amounted to 22 percent of the total, according to a 
Soviet foreign trade journal. 
a. MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE 
This Ministry, engaged as it is in serving the import-
export requirements of Communist China, certainly operates within 
foreign policy guide lines laid down by the CCP and the MFA. It is 
official Chinese Communist policy that economics and trade cannot 
be separated from political objectives. Communist China's economic 
and trade offensive requires coordination of the activities of the 
23 
Approved For Release 199,9/048/2ii ilhEU4T-p9646R000300090003-3 
Approved For ReleasleiMMTrettft78-02646R000300090003-3 
State-controlled China National Import-Export Corporation with its 
offices and representatives abroad, the other state-owned corpor-
ations dealing with exports and imports of specific types of goods 
and equipment, the Chinese Communist-owned or controlled trading 
companies abroad, direct government foreign trade dealings with 
other governments and private business firms in other countries, 
and the negotiation of trade agreements with other nations. 
Commercial counsellors or attaches are found in most 
Chinese Communist embassies and legations. The Ministry of Foreign 
Trade appears to have some role in the selection of those named as 
commercial counsellors and attaches, but clearance of such appoint-
ments with Party organs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
certainly a prerequisite. Inaddition, there are trade agencies, trade 
exhibits, and economic missions in some countries where no diplomatic 
relations exist. 
The Ministry of Foreign Trade consists of a number of 
functional offices and geographical area bureaus -- for example, the 
Fourth Bureau, or Afro-Asian Department, of which TSOU Ssu-i was 
the deputy director. Radio Peking identified TSOU in September 1960 
as the CPG commercial representative in Cuba. The Second Bureau, 
headed by CHIA Shih, deals with Sino-Soviet Bloc countries, and 
another bureau covers dealings with European countries. PAI Jen, 
formerly a Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, was named Ambassador 
to Morocco in February 1959. 
There are many examples of Chinese Communist efforts 
to combine the lure of trade with Communist China with political con-
siderations and to use international commerce as a lever to bring 
about diplomatic recognition. Unsuccessful attempts to hold a shot-
gun wedding of politics and economics were made in the cases of Japan 
and Austria. Trade agreements have often been used as an entering 
wedge to bring about recognition; some examples involved Cambodia, 
Morocco, and Cuba. 
Under the Ministry of Foreign Trade there is a Market 
Research Institute, which in turn has specific area research offices, 
such as the European-American Research Office. 
b. CHINA NATIONAL TRADE CORPORATIONS 
There are at least fifteen national trade corporations, 
official government organs which control all imports and exports 
Approved For Release 1999/08/i41: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
'.,sIaJ. 
Approved For Release 1999/66721-1-:."(CiA=RtiP78-02646R000300090003-3 
within specific fields as indicated in their titles (e.g., China National 
Silk Corporation). At the top of this import-export structure is the 
China National Import and Export Corporation (CNIEC). The head 
office of each of these corporations is in Peking. Most of them have 
branch offices in Shanghai, Canton, and Tientsin. Branch offices of 
some of the corporations are located in Tsingtao, Hankow, Foochow, 
Chlangsha, Amoy, and Dairen. 
An office of the China National Import and Export Corpora-
tion was established in East Berlin before the inauguration of exchanges 
of trade delegations to deal with non-Communist countries in Europe. 
CNIEC acted as sole importer of goods from these countries. The 
Berlin office was reported by the East German press to have closed on 
14 October 1956. Although it was to be reopened in Bern, Switzerland, 
it appears that this office was discontinued, or the commercial 
counsellor of the embassy in Bern may have assumed the responsibility 
for purchasing in Europe. Transactions with these national corpor-
ations are often handled by trade delegations directly representing the 
various corporations. 
c. TRADE EXHIBITS 
There is also a department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
which arranges for trade exhibits held in Communist China and for 
Chinese Communist participation in fairs and exhibits abroad. Com-
munist China has made a most favorable impression in non-Communist 
countries through such exhibits. For example, Communist China 
occupied the honored position among foreign exhibitors at the Lausanne 
trade fair in September 1958. The honored position had been held in 
past years by Portugal, Canada, Argentina, and India. Peiping's 
exhibit was under the patronage of the Chinese Communist Ambassador 
in Bern. This trade fair and one in Basel in 1959 drew visitors from 
all over Europe and gave the Chinese Communists an opportunity to 
exploit extensive commercial contacts. 
d. CHINA COMMITTEE FOR PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL 
TRADE 
Closely related to Communist China's endeavor to expand 
its foreign trade is a front organization, the China Committee for the 
Promotion of International Trade (CC PIT), which is functionally but 
not organizationally under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Because the 
25

1/41y 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RIDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
CCPIT sends delegations to many free world areas in order to pave 
the way for trade with non-Communist countries, it must be con-
sidered as participating in people's diplomacy; and its activities 
certainly are closely keyed to foreign trade relations in the broader 
sense. 
The CCPIT was established in May 1952. It has two main 
objectives: (1) to persuade businessmen in non-Communist countries 
that strategic embargoes on trade with the Soviet bloc and China are 
detrimental to their own best interest; and (2) to develop trade rela-
tions with non-Communist countries. It was closely affiliated with the 
International Committee for Promotion of Trade (IC PT), an inter-
national Communist front reportedly dissolved in 1956. The CCPIT 
has sent numerous trade delegations to Japan, South Asia, the Near 
and Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Latin America; has sponsored 
numerous exhibits at international fairs; and has concluded trade agree-
ments with private commercial groups in Great Britain, Japan, France, 
Italy, Ceylon, Egypt, Burma, India, and other non-Communist countries. 
2. CULTURAL DIPLOMACY AND PROPAGANDA 
One of the five staff offices under the CPG State Council is 
the Staff Office for Culture and Education. Under this staff office falls 
the Ministry of Culture, which is generally responsible for all 
domestic propaganda activities conducted through the government and 
the production of most of the published propaganda which is sent abroad. 
The Staff Office also exercises some measure of supervision over the 
domestic operations of such propaganda media as the New China News 
Agency (NCNA) and the facilities and programs of the Broadcasting 
Administration Bureau (BAB). The foreign bureaus and offices of the 
NCNA and the foreign broadcasts and monitoring of programs broad-
cast from other nations by the BAB are probably under the joint 
cognizance of the Staff Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The 
governmental Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries 
(CCRFC) is also under the direction of the Staff Office for Foreign 
Affairs, and its activities are coordinated with foreign policy as admin-
istered through the Foreign Ministry. The unofficial Association for 
Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries also takes its direction from 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
a. COMMISSION FOR CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES (CCRFC) 
26 
Approved For Releas / 411.-"ClA=RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
The CCRFC was established in February 1958 as successor 
to the special agency of the State Council known as the Liaison Bureau 
for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. This Commission 
sponsors cultural relations and exchanges of persons with the Sino-
Soviet Bloc countries and non-Bloc nations with which Communist China 
has formal cultural exchange agreements. It maintains liaison with 
similar organizations found in each of the Sino-Soviet Bloc countries, 
appears to direct the affairs of the friendship associations for each of 
the Bloc countries in Communist China, and works with the China 
friendship associations in each of the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations. 
b. ASSOCIATION FOR CULTURAL RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES (ACRFC) 
The ACRFC, formally established in May 1954, performs 
the same functions as described above for the CCRFC but in all known 
instances has confined these activities to non-Sino-Soviet Bloc nations. 
Although little is known of the organizational structure of either the 
CCRFC or ACRFC, it is probable that there are functional and area 
sections under each. LIU Po-kang was reported by one source in 
September 1958 to be head of the Japan section of the ACRFC. In July 
1960, WU Ching was named as deputy head of a Second Department under 
the CCRFC. (See Attachment 2 for the names of CCRFC and ACRFC 
officials.) 
c. NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) 
Founded in 1932, the NCNA opened its first foreign bureau 
in 1949. It now has foreign bureaus or offices in 27 of the 34 countries 
with which Communist China has diplomatic relations and in. four 
countries or areas (France, West Germany, Hong Kong, and Macao) 
where there are no diplomatic installations. Through all these offices 
and bureaus, as well as from other correspondents on roving assign-
ment, news is collected and sent to Peking, large amounts of overt 
information which is not classifiable as news are acquired and sent to 
headquarters in Peking, and the personnel assigned to these bureaus 
and offices perform other functions which are not normally performed 
by a bona fide news agency. The NCNA bureaus and offices in most 
instances monitor the Peking newscasts, and these monitored items 
are used in the publication of news bulletins which are widely distributed. 
Agreements to exchange their news files are in effect with the national 
news agencies of all the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations and with foreign news 
27

agencies of several free world countries. All of these news agencies 
also have correspondents stationed in Peking, and some foreign com-
munists are employed at NCNA. headquarters. 
d. BROADCASTING ADMINISTRATION BUREAU (BAB) 
As one of the special agencies, the BAB is administratively 
subordinate to Staff Office for Culture and Education of the State 
Council. Policy and political control of the BAB is exercised by the 
CCP Propaganda Department, and its foreign broadcasts are subject 
to close coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to insure 
compliance with Communist China's foreign policy. Before news from 
the outside world is broadcast to the large listening audience on the 
China mainland over the domestic radio and television network, it is 
carefully screened by an editorial committee of party members which 
provides guidance in conformance with current foreign policy and 
controls the context and timing of such broadcasts. 
In August 1944 the New China News Agency began daily 
foreign broadcasts of news in English Morse code from Yenan. The 
New China Broadcasting Station in Yenan was established in September 
1945 and the volume of foreign broadcasts increased. In October 1949 
the Central People's Broadcasting Station was set up in Peking. By 
1955 the BAB facilities were broadcasting 78 3/4 hours of foreign 
programs of news, propaganda, and music in seven languages, plus 
programs beamed to Taiwan, and others totaling ll 1/2 hours daily in 
five Chinese dialects directed to Chinese residing overseas. By May 
1960 the BAB was operating 22 transmitters beaming news and 
propaganda abroad for a total of 674 program hours per week in at 
least 19 foreign languages and five Chinese dialects, a rate second 
only to Radio Moscow's 975 hours among the Sino-Soviet Bloc nations. 
As announcers and translators the BAB foreign broadcasts use many 
foreign nationals, including party members sent by foreign Communist 
parties to engage in this work, and a number of Chinese who learned 
other languages while residing abroad. The Overseas Broadcasting 
Division of BAB also prepares and broadcasts special programs of 
domestic news and editorial reactions to international news from the 
Chinese Communist viewpoint. These programs are believed to be 
intended for the guidance of embassies and other official installations 
abroad. 
Since 1937 the Chinese Communist broadcasting facility 
has monitored foreign news broadcasts for use by the New China News

Agency and for the information of the Chinese Communist leadership. 
At present the Foreign Radio Monitoring Division of the BAB monitors, 
transcribes, and translates news programs broadcast from nations 
in areas of interest to Communist China throughout the world. Staffed 
by Party and Youth League members, this division prepares briefs on 
international news every two hours and distributes them to key Party, 
government, and Foreign Ministry officials. The news so monitored 
is passed to the NCNA for selective use in its news service and is used 
in the preparation of two daily classified bulletins published by the 
NCNA for distribution to a select group of Party and government 
officials. This monitoring service enables the Chinese Communist 
propaganda organization and Foreign Ministry to react rapidly to 
happenings of international interest bearing upon Communist China's 
foreign policy, status, or interests. 
3. OVERSEAS CHINESE AFFAIRS COMMISSION (OCAC) 
This Commission, under the State Council, is concerned with 
matters involving the 14,000,000 hua chtiao  (Chinese temporarily 
residing abroad, most often referred to as "Overseas Chinese"). It 
receives its direction from the CCP, principally from the United Front 
Work and Propaganda Departments of the Central Committee. The 
Commission is concerned not only with Chinese residing overseas but 
also with those returning from overseas residence or study, either to 
visit or to reside permanently on the mainland. It operates hostels 
and a mechanism for the reception and handling of those who are visiting. 
A front organization known as the Federation of Returned Overseas 
Chinese has been created with branches throughout the mainland, to 
which all returning for permanent residence are virtually required to 
belong. 
Many channels and methods are employed by the Chinese Com-
munists to acquire and retain the loyalty to the Communist regime of 
these large communities of Chinese residing abroad. Wherever they 
exist, embassies work extensively among these largely unassimilated 
groups. Branches of the Bank of China have Overseas Chinese Depart-
ments to handle remittances, spread propaganda, and perform other 
tasks on behalf of Peking. The United Front Work Department of the 
CCP has agents within these Chinese communities. Some New China 
News Agency bureaus maintain contact with and sponsor cultural acti-
vities among them. Special Radio Peking broadcasts are directed to 
the Chinese overseas. The Communist-controlled and pro-Communist 
press, schools, and various business and labor organizations in foreign 
29

countries afford assistance in bringing the hua chliao  under the control 
or influence of Peking. Communist China must often walk a narrow 
path to avoid offending the local governments with which Peking has 
diplomatic relations and which resent the presence of these large bodies 
of unassimilated Chinese, while still preserving the loyalty or good 
will of the hua chliao, who are under local government pressures and 
restrictions. 
The OCAC also collaborates with the CCP United Front Work 
Department in organizing associations of overseas Chinese and in 
gaining Chinese Communist control over those already established. 
In one Southeast Asian nation the Chinese Communist-controlled asso-
ciation plays a prominent part in the political activities of the large 
hua chliao  community and works closely with Chinese Communist 
diplomatic and consular installations in investigating and processing 
applications by Chinese residing in that country for passports. 
4. OTHER GOVERNMENT AND UNOFFICIAL ORGANIZATIONS 
No attempt will be made herein to enumerate or describe the 
foreign activities of all of the other government ministries and special 
agencies, mass organizations, and fronts. Suffice it to say that there 
is a foreign department in almost every ministry and an international 
liaison department in all the All-China federations (youth, students, 
women, journalists, labor, scientists, etc.). The Chinese national 
fronts which are counterparts of such bodies as the World Peace 
Council and the Afro-Asian Solidarity Council are patently set up to 
participate in the international or regional Communist front organi-
zations. 
A few of these other organizations and foreign operations are 
worthy of some comment: 
a. BANK OF CHINA 
One of the special agencies under the State Council's Staff 
Office for Finance and Trade is the People's Bank of China. Its 
Foreign Operations Department directs the banking and other activi-
ties of the banks (all State-owned) outside Communist China, including 
the eleven branches of the Bank of China. All these branches are in 
South and Southeast Asia except the one in London, the most important 
banking office being in Hong Kong. As subsidiaries of the sole foreign 
exchange bank for Communist China, Bank of China branches perform 
30

mstiosesommusmmososrimi 
Approved For Release 1906872C:-LCDVAISPW2646R000300090003-3 
all the usual banking functions, such as financing foreign trade, making 
loans to borrowers (principally Chinese) abroad, and transferring 
remittances to and from the China mainland. Most of these branches 
also have departments which collect commercial and economic informa-
tion concerning the host countries and trade with these countries. In 
addition to their normal banking functions, these branches of the Bank 
of China and their personnel perform duties and functions relating to 
propaganda, political action, control of the Chinese residing overseas, 
and subversion. They also are utilized in the funding of the various 
overt and covert activities in the countries where they are located and 
in the performance of certain tasks which would normally be assigned 
to consular installations. 
b. CHINA INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL AGENCY 
The China Travel Service, which deals largely with Chinese 
returning from overseas on visits or for permanent residence, super-
vises the itineraries of visitors from other nations while they are on 
the China mainland. There is also a China International Travel Agency 
(or Bureau) which, established about the end of 1956 or in early 1957, 
operates like the Soviet INTOURIST, although on a smaller scale. 
Little is known of this agency, although it has formalized protocols 
with INTOURIST and travel agencies of other Communist nations for 
the annual handling of specified numbers of private tourists. The first 
group of 51 such Soviet tourists arrived in Communist China in January 
1957. The International Travel Agency apparently has branches through-
out Communist China and possibly is represented abroad in Sino-
Soviet bloc countries. 
c. INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS 
Although Communist China is not a member of the Universal 
Postal Union (UPU), postal channels to and from the China mainland 
are open to virtually all parts of the world, and the UPU has a working 
relationship with the China mainland which conforms with postal union 
rules. Development of international communications by Communist 
China has been principally oriented to the Sino-Soviet bloc, but tele-
communications agreements or contracts have been established with 
more than forty countries. Long distance telegraph and telephone 
service connects Peking with all the other Communist nations. Radio-
telegraph and radio-telephone service from Peking or Shanghai is 
maintained with Tokyo and Osaka in Japan and with London, Paris, 
Geneva, Hong Kong, India, Burma, Indonesia, and other important 
31

Approved For RelealidaNOWITP,MMI71378-02646R000300090003-3 
communications centers. There is radiophoto service between Peking 
and Tokyo, Geneva, and probably Prague. Additional telecommunica-
tions circuits have been projected. 
d. CIVIL AVIATION BUREAU 
Communist China's airlines, under the Civil Aviation 
Bureau, have expanded to connect all of China's major cities. Inter-
national service is available to the USSR, North Korea, North 
Vietnam, and Burma. Further extensions to Hong Kong, Japan, 
India, Ceylon, and Cambodia are in the planning or negotiation stages. 
Air service to most points in Europe, Africa, and Latin America is 
available via connections in Moscow, Prague, and Zurich. Persons 
traveling by air to Japan or South and Southeast Asia cross over the 
border at Hong Kong and make connections there. 
e. ACADEMY OF SCIENCES 
Although not a formal governmental organ, this Academy 
serves the Party and government in the course of its activities. One 
of its many institutes, the International Relations Research Institute, 
is believed to do long-range, overt research on foreign affairs not 
related to the day-to-day conduct of foreign relations. Also under the 
Academy is a Scientific Information Institute which came into being in 
1956 and flooded universities and scientific bodies of Western nations 
with requests for the exchange of literature, publications, and other 
scientific and technical data. JEN Sheng, an official of the Academy, 
told a news correspondent visiting Peking in 1958, "We have the Insti-
tute of Scientific Information, whose task is to get data from the whole 
world. We study the scientific merits of any country, no matter how 
big or small, friendly or antagonistic". 
Reference has been made to the existence of a Foreign 
Office Department (although the exact title was not known), divided 
into sections for particular countries or areas, which dealt with such 
matters between Communist China and these areas as liaison on joint 
scientific projects. This department may be the same as the Academy's 
Bureau of Scientific Relations with Foreign Countries, headed by 
WANG TIo.

5. MILITARY 
The Ministry of National Defense, directly under the State 
Council, is referred to by the Chinese Communists as the executive 
and administrative organ for the Red Chinese armed forces, called 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which encompasses all branches 
of the military services. Through its Military Affairs Committee and 
a General Political Department of the Central Committee, directly 
attached to the armed forces, the Communist Party of China exercises 
the actual control over the PLA, which has repeatedly been described 
as the military arm of the Party. 
The PLA has a dual role: the defense of the China mainland 
and participation in international military affairs. The latter is 
illustrated in: 
a. Participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers of the 
PLA in the Korean War. 
b. Presence of PLA. military advisors in Communist nations 
of the Far East. 
c. Support of Communist guerrilla forces in Malaya, the 
Philippines, and elsewhere. 
d. The existence of a Foreign Affairs Department in the 
Ministry of National Defense, the functions of which include: 
(1) 
Participation in the assignment to diplomatic in-
stallations abroad of military attaches who engage 
in the collection of military information and liaison 
with foreign military services. 
(2) Liaison with military attaches of other nations 
assigned to their embassies in Peking. 
(3) Supporting Chinese Communist military missions 
traveling abroad. 
(4) Receiving and planning itineraries of foreign military 
missions visiting Communist China,

(5) Dispatching Military Advisors to serve with 
military and guerrilla forces of other countries. 
e. Offers to furnish and actually supplying war materiel 
and military manpower to armed forces in rebellion 
against governments of nations of the free world. 
Examples are offers to the Algerian rebel forces and 
encouragement and support of pro-Communist and 
anti-Western forces in nations where Communism is 
competing for control. 
f. Assisting Communist insurgency and subversion 
directed against the military and internal security 
forces of other nations, and encouraging civil dis-
orders against governments of nations friendly to 
the West, such as Laos and Japan. 
g. Engaging in hostile military action, as in Quemoy 
and in the Indian and Nepalese border incidents.

IV. FOREIGN SERVICE TRAINING 
It goes without saying that few, if any, personnel of the Foreign 
Ministry or foreign service of the predecessor government on the 
China mainland would be used in responsible ministry or diplomatic 
posts under the CPG after the Chinese Communists took over in 1949. 
Few trusted Chinese Communist cadres had adequate experience in 
foreign affairs and diplomacy prior to 1949. Available Party personnel 
who had any degree of experience or qualifications to hold such posts 
fell into four categories: 
a. Those who had served the CCP in dealings with the Chinese 
Nationalist Government over the years up to 1948 and in the un-
productive negotiations carried on under the auspices of the 
Marshall Mission in 1946. 
b. Those who had been associated with the USSR and its 
satellites through the Comintern and Cominform, or who had 
served abroad at headquarters of the Comintern, Cominform, 
or the various international Communist front organizations. 
c. Those who had resided or studied abroad for protracted 
periods and had thus established contacts with the people of 
these areas and/or language qualifications. 
d. A relatively small number of CCP members who had 
engaged in study or research concerning political science and 
foreign relations. 
Since the 1930's some secret CCP members have participated in 
an organization known as the Chinese Foreign Relations Association. 
One example is WANG Ping-nan, now Ambassador to Poland, who was 
educated in Japan and Germany, who was associated in the 1930's with 
the Berlin branch of the Comintern, and who returned to China in 1935, 
ostensibly as a leader in one of the small non-government political 
parties. Secretary of the Chinese People's Foreign Relations Asso-
ciation in 1939 in Chungking, he subsequently emerged as a member 
of the CCP headquarters staff. He appeared in Peking in 1949 and, 
before establishment of the Chinese Communist Government, assisted 
in the organization of a Foreign Affairs School. He joined the CPG 
35

Forcign Ministry upon its founding and became an assistant to the 
Foreign Minister. He later appeared as secretary general of the 
Chinese Communist delegation, headed by CHOU En-lai, to the 
Korean Political Conference in Geneva in April 1954. 
Lacking trained and experienced CCP cadre in sufficient numbers 
to staff the Foreign Ministry and the diplomatic installations being 
opened in 1949-1950 in the Sino-Soviet Bloc and free world nations, the 
Party called upon inexperienced but trusted CCP leaders and senior 
military officers, filling in the gaps with Communist Youth League 
members. In these early days of the CPG, assignments to diplomatic 
posts in the Sino-Soviet bloc nations served as a training ground in 
foreign affairs. Some CCP cadres were trained in foreign service 
schools in the USSR, and those who were assigned to key posts outside 
the bloc were able to draw upon the support and counsel of experienced 
Soviet diplomats. 
Prior to 1949, in the areas controlled by the Chinese Communists, 
Public Security Bureaus had been established. Under some of these 
bureaus Foreign Affairs Sections (also known as Alien Control Sections) 
were established as a device to monitor the activities of foreigners 
(non-Chinese). Some of the persons later drawn into the Foreign 
Ministry came from these Foreign Affairs Sections. By 1952 the CPG 
Foreign Ministry had established its own training program, which was 
turning out party cadres with some knowledge of foreign affairs and 
foreign languages in sufficient numbers to staff the expanding Chinese 
Communist diplomatic corps abroad. 
It is known that hundreds of Chinese have studied at various Soviet 
higher party schools and institutes, but the proportion or numbers of 
these students trained as specialists in diplomacy and the foreign 
service is not known. By the 19301s there were two schools in Moscow 
training specialists for foreign service careers: the Institute for 
Preparation of Diplomatic and Consular Workers and the Higher 
Diplomatic School, now known as the Moscow Diplomatic School. In 
Moscow two institutions sponsored by the Personnel Directorate of 
the USSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs now offer training for a foreign 
service career, the Institute of International Relations and the Moscow 
Diplomatic School. The latter is the foremost training center for 
prospective foreign service personnel in the Sino-Soviet bloc. The 
Soviet Institute of International Relations offers three types of training: 
a 6-year course for candidates with a secondary school education; a 
2 to 3 year course for graduates of a university or the equivalent; and 
36 
Approved For Release aaalpiars441W8-02646R000300090003-3 
sewpow 
Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
"in-service" training of indeterminate length for non-professionals, 
with refresher courses for "junior" diplomats returning from 
abroad. 
The Soviet Institute has approximately 1,000 applicants in any 
given year, accepting about 200 or more of these applicants and 
graduating about 80. Students from the Sino-Soviet Bloc have been 
admitted since the early 19501s, tuition costs being borne by the 
country of origin. Of the Bloc students in attendance during the year 
1954-1955, 70 were Chinese, more than from any other Bloc member. 
It is to be presumed that the security of all Chinese candidates must 
be cleared by the Communist Party of China and that they must be 
members of the Party or the Youth League. It is not known whether 
any Chinese Communist students have attended the Moscow Diplomatic 
School, which may confine its admissions to more experienced officers 
of special potentiality in view of the fact that the enrollment in the 
Institute is much larger. The existence of a separate Soviet Institute 
of Chinese Studies, formerly a part of the Institute of Oriental Studies 
under the USSR Academy of Sciences, and of a number of foreign 
language schools is known; but the extent to which Chinese have been 
trained in these schools is not. There are Chinese instructors on 
the staffs of several of the more important Soviet schools teaching 
oriental languages. 
The first formal training of Chinese Communist foreign service 
personnel, begun at some undetermined date after the Communists 
took over the mainland in 1949, was conducted at the International 
Relations Department on the campus of the People's University. In 
late 1955 or early 1956 the Foreign Service Institute was established 
on Exhibition Hall Road in Peking, as the successor to the former 
university department. A Radio Peking broadcast in September 1955 
stated that an "Institute of Diplomacy" was to be set up in Peking under 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In October 1956 there were reports 
that Chinese repatriated from the U.S. were teaching at this institute. 
Radio Peking broadcasts in 1957 referred to a "Foreign Affairs College", 
to an "International Diplomacy Academy of Peking", and to an "Institute 
of Diplomacy", all believed to have been the same as the Foreign 
Service Institute. Some "student consuls" serving in embassies abroad 
were later reported to have graduated from the Foreign Service 
Institute.

A. INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (IIR) 
(Kuo Chi Kuan Hsi Hsueh Yuan, 0948/7139/7070/0190/1331/7108) 
In July 1958 the name of the Foreign Service Institute was changed 
to the Institute of International Relations. This Institute is located on 
Chan Len Kuan Road, Pai Wan Chuang Lu, Peking, across from the 
CCP Municipal Committee Party School, in a four-story building con-
structed in 1956, which houses the administrative offices, classrooms, 
and dormitory rooms for students. The Institute is in a compound 
with a number of houses, several athletic fields, a four-story dormitory 
for teachers, a three-story dormitory for students, a service building 
with dispensary, and a mess hall. 
Originally, a number of Soviet advisors, most of whom are 
believed to have returned to the USSR, helped establish the institute 
and its curriculum, based upon the organization and program of the 
Institute of International Relations in Moscow. Among the Soviet 
advisors reported working with the ]IR in 1958 were TUPINSKY, former 
deputy dean of the Soviet LIR and a German expert; TCHEKAVSKY, a 
legal expert; and DOPAVA, a female linguistic expert. A 
Dr. MALINSIKOV and one KUDAKOV were also reported to be among 
these advisors up to mid-1958. By the end of 1958 all instructors were 
Chinese, although Soviet advisors sometimes lectured to the faculty 
(but not to the students). At the end of 1958 there apparently was only 
one Soviet advisor to the LIR, a specialist on international economics 
who also was advisor to the Institute of International Studies of the 
Academy of Sciences. 
Funds to support the Institute come from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Education, or possibly from both. The policy 
and operations of the institute are actually controlled by the Institute's 
CCP Committee, which also guides Communist Youth League activities 
among the students. The DR is not known to have a program for the 
exchange of study material with the USSR or any other Bloc nation, 
although there were some twenty students from Sino-Soviet Bloc countries 
enrolled in the IIR in 1958. 
Regular courses of study at the IIR last four to five years, with 
special two to three year courses for CCP cadres and persons who had 
served abroad. The five year course is designed for language 
specialists. In late 1958 the LIR had two academic departments, the 
International Relations Department and the Foreign Languages Depart-
ment. The IIR curriculum is apparently designed principally to turn 
38

Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300090003-3 
out well-indoctrinated Communists rather than qualified diplomats. 
Training stressed Communist propaganda, the supreme authority of 
the Communist Party and state, and the ultimate goal of the country 
and its people to become dominant among all nations of the world. A for-
mer student was of the opinion that there was no realistic presentation 
of world politics, intra-bloc affairs, or Western internal affairs. 
? The LIR has four administrative offices: the Director's Office for 
over-all supervision; the Educational Administrative Office, which 
handles matters such as setting up the curriculum, administration of 
instructors, and the guidance of research; the Personnel Office, 
which handles enrollments, transfers, faculty administration, and 
assignment of CCP cadre within the LIR.; and the General Affairs Office, 
which handles finances, dormitory assignments, food service, and 
maintenance of buildings and equipment. 
CHIEN Hsin-jen, former Ambassador to Finland, is president 
as well as secretary of the CCP Committee of the IIR. The three 
vice presidents are HO Wu-shuang, KIUNG Hsiang-lin, and LI En-ch'iu, 
the ILR Executive Director. CHANG Hsin-chluan is chief of the 
President's Secretariat. LI Kuang heads the IIR Foreign Languages 
Department. SUN Chun-ching is director of the General Affairs Office, 
LIU Chien-yang heads the Personnel Office, and KIUNG Hsiang-lin is 
concurrently head of the Educational Administrative Office. 
HO Wu-shuang is concurrently director of the International Relations 
Department. Most of the 11R instructors are members of the CCP or 
its Youth Corps, many of the younger ones having been trained by 
Soviet advisors at the People's University International Relations 
Department. 
In 1954 the former International Relations Department of the 
People's University had about five hundred students, a number reduced 
to approximately four hundred by the time the Foreign Service Institute 
was founded in 1956. By late 1958 about six hundred were enrolled at 
the 11R. Entrance requirements place heavy stress upon political 
reliability, loyalty to the CCP, and freedom from any reactionary 
background or foreign connections. A National Student Recruitment 
Committee of the Ministry of Education screens applications from all 
middle school students seeking entrance into any institution of higher 
learning, and those chosen for enrollment in the IIR are considered 
highly privileged.

Chinese students were Party cadre of middle and low level as 
well as middle-school graduates training for diplomatic assignments. 
Some students had already served abroad in the foreign service, 
others had previously worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
and some came from the military or other government offices. 
Upon completion of his course each student is asked to state a 
preference for his future work as a teacher, as a researcher in inter-
national affairs, or for assignment to a diplomatic installation abroad. 
Only 5 to 10 percent of the graduates get foreign assignments. A few 
are selected for teaching assignments on the DR Staff. Others are 
sent to the Institute of International Studies of the Academy of Sciences, 
to the foreign affairs offices of ministries and commissions under the 
State Council, and to the international liaison sections of the mass 
organizations (such as the All China Federation of Trade Unions). 
However, the largest number is assigned to area and functional depart-
ments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Peking. Those who enter 
the DR as CCP cadre usually receive better posts than do the "young 
students", who come directly from middle schools. 
Foreign service personnel are usually referred to in Communist 
China as "foreign service cadres" rather than as "foreign service 
officers". Cadre students are more apt to be assigned as staff 
employees and the "young students" as functionaries. After leaving 
the LIR, graduates reside at a foreign service hostel in the eastern 
suburbs of Peking. Those assigned abroad are allowed to visit their 
homes on leave, at their own expense, before taking up assignment 
abroad. 
One source, who was employed in the Foreign Ministry at Peking 
until the end of 1958, stated that the salary of a college graduate 
joining the Ministry in 1955 was IP 50 per month for grade 22, raised 
to_.16. 69 per month the following year for a grade 20. His assigned 
living quarters were first in a four-man room, later a two-man room, 
finally a single room, the latter costing Y. 1.40 a month furnished. He 
ate in a mess hall at a monthly expense of up to 18. Each week he 
attended a meeting addressed by a cadre of ministerial level, and each 
day he read the bulletin, Reference News  (Tstan Klao Hsiao Hsi), 
compiled by the New China News Agency from the monitoring of foreign 
news broadcasts and limited in circulation. He received free medical 
care and, if called upon to act as an interpreter, was given evening 
dress or other appropriate apparel needed for social functions.

According to this same source, CHENG Piing, former dean at the 
LIR up to 1958, was assigned to the post of first secretary of the 
Chinese Communist Embassy in Cambodia. 
In addition to Communist Party newspapers and publications pub-
lished in the Sino-Soviet Bloc as well as in some free nations, the 
students have access to the London Times  and New York Times. 
Among the students at the HR. have been some from the USSR, the 
East European satellites, Yugoslavia, North Korea, and North 
Vietnam, although the number of such foreign students has been 
relatively small. In 1958, of the some 600 students in the IIR, four 
were Poles, two each were from East Germany, Rumania and Hungary, 
one each from Albania and Yugoslavia, and more than 20 from North 
Vietnam. 
Tuition for all Chinese students is free and living quarters are 
provided, but all students have to pay for food, clothing and books. 
Some scholarships are given. Uniforms are not worn by students of 
the IIR. Cadre students continue to receive regular salaries while in 
attendance at the IIR. Tuition of foreign students is paid by the 
sponsoring country. 
The CCP Committee of the IIR directs all indoctrination, "criticism 
sessions", cultural and party activities. A CCP member is assigned to 
supervise the work of the well-organized Communist Youth League 
chapter. 
The courses given at the I1R may be broken down into four general 
categories: basic subjects such as geography, history, law and cultures; 
political theory, principally Marxism and Leninism; history of the 
Chinese revolution; Communist philosphy, historic and dialectic 
materialism; foreign affairs, including history of international political 
and economic relations; international public and private law; history of 
Chinese diplomacy and foreign policy; and foreign languages. Among 
the languages taught at the LIR were English (34 instructors), French 
(25 teachers), Russian (20 instructors), German, Spanish, Japanese, 
and Arabic. Students usually studied a primary language for a three-
year period and a secondary tongue for one year; language specialists 
devote their fifth year to their specialty. 
Guest lecturers at the LIR have included Premier CHOU En-lai;

LO Kuei-po, CHI Pleng-fei, and TSENG Yung-chtuan; former Vice 
Foreign Minister CHANG Wen-then; KUNG Pieng, head of the Infor-
mation Department of the MFA; HUANG Hua, who at the time was 
head of the former MFA West European and African Affairs Office; 
and Ambassadors on leave in Communist China, including WANG 
Ping-nan (Poland), HUANG Chen (Indonesia), WU Hsiu-chiiian 
(Yugoslavia), and HA.N Nien-lung, former Ambassador to Pakistan. 
CHOU En-lai in one lecture listed the four basic duties of cadres 
in the diplomatic service as: 
1. Possessing the spirit of and upholding the interests of 
the working class; 
2. Executing loyally the policies of the CCP and the foreign 
policies of Communist China because, by merely serving the 
working class, a cadre might be ignoring the strategy of the 
Party; 
3. Mastering the skills of the diplomatic profession, in-
cluding understanding the language of the country to which 
assigned; and 
4. Observing disdpline and obeying all orders of their 
superiors. 
Only CCP and Youth Corps members are allowed to attend these 
guest lectures, which sometimes are given by non-Chinese visitors to 
Peking. From the "blooming and contending" program beginning in 
May 1956 through the implementation of the "leap forward" program 
in 1958-1959, all students and faculty members were required to 
participate in these campaigns. A few persons were condemned as 
rightists and punished in one way or another, dependent upon the 
seriousness of the charges against them. 
B. LANGUAGE TRAINING 
In addition to the LIR, there is also a Foreign Language College, 
of which CHANG Hsi-chiou is President. It is one of the departments 
of Peking University, and similar colleges reportedly exist in other 
principal universities such as that in Harbin. An official of Peking

University told a visitor from abroad that this college was established 
in 1944 and that in October 1958 there were 886 students studying 
English, German, French, Spanish, and Rumanian. The Peking 
University Foreign Language College seeks to turn out graduates 
capable of understanding, speaking, reading, and writing the language 
in which they specialize. However, one observer stated the stress 
was principally on translation and conversation. 
A leading educator from one Asian nation stated, after a visit to 
Peking, that an institute had been established In that city to train 
specialists in language, literature, history, music, etc., of his 
country. Under instruction were Chinese students who had lived in 
the Asian nation and had been brought to Peking for this special training, 
as well as CCP cadres. The educator commented that these students 
were so well-trained that they could pass unnoticed as nationals in an 
average community in the educator's home country. 
A number of Chinese are also known to have attended the Institute 
of Eastern Languages in Moscow, where oriental and South Asian 
languages as well as those of the Near East and Africa are taught. 
Chinese have also studied at the Institute of Foreign Languages in 
Moscow, where instruction in Western languages is given. 
Although it is not known to what extent the practice is carried out, 
personnel have been assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to 
the embassy in one country where they underwent intensive training 
in the language of the area to prepare them linguistically for assign-
ments in that and adjoining countries. In this instance a villa was 
rented by the embassy and equipped as a secure area where the first 
group of ten Foreign Ministry employees spent two years studying the 
language under tutelage of local nationals, after which the members 
of this group were assigned to posts in the host and neighboring nations. 
There were four non-Chinese instructors, who were the only nationals 
of the host country allowed access to the school's quarters. These 
students, and a subsequent group, were each given the title of 
"functionary" while engaged in this language training.

V. SUMMARY DATA CONCERNING KY FIGURES 
IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
A. STAFF OFFICE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND MINISTRY OF 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
This summarization is based on biographic data available as of 
1 October 1960 concerning the 58 key personnel of the Staff Office and 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Little is known of some of these 58 
persons other than that they are in their present positions. However, 
some observations on the education, experience, and capabilities of 
this group can be made. 
1. Of the 26 most important members in the group, including those 
down to the level of heads of Geographical Offices and Functional 
Departments: 
a. The ages of only 15 of the 26 are known and the average 
is approximately 50 years. 
b. The average experience in foreign affairs of those on 
whom data are available is nine years. 
c. Eleven have held posts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
other than their present ones. 
d. Three formerly headed Alien Affairs Offices under the 
Ministry of Public Security. 
e. Eighteen have had some experience abroad, six of these 
as Ambassadors (three in the Soviet Bloc, one in Burma, and 
two who served both in Sweden and Pakistan), and five others 
have held diplomatic posts abroad. 
f. Three represented the Chinese Communists in dealings 
in 1946 with the Marshall Mission to China; one has participated 
in the U.S. - Communist China ambassadorial level talks in 
Geneva; a number have attended meetings of various international 
Communist front organizations; and many have traveled abroad 
since 1949 with Chinese Communist delegations.

g. One of the 26, CEPEN I, is a member of the all-powerful 
CCP Political Bureau Standing Committee; two are full members 
and three are alternate members of the CCP Central Committee. 
h. There is no information on the educational background of 
11 of the 26; two are known to have had little or no formal schooling; 
four are graduates of middle or normal schools; three had some 
university training; ten are graduates of Chinese universities, and 
three were graduated from or taught in Chinese military academies. 
At least two studied at the Chinese Communist Marx-Lenin 
Academy at Yenan. 
i. Of the 26, eight studied abroad in one or more of the 
following countries: Germany (3); the U.S., Japan, and France 
(2 each); in the United Kingdom; and six at the Sun Yat Sen 
University for Toilers of China in Moscow. 
j. Three of the 26 were members of the Chinese Communist 
delegation which appeared at the UN Security Council meeting at 
Lake Success in 1950. One other formerly worked for a depart-
ment of the UN. 
k. Two have backgrounds as writers on political science and 
as Communist propagandists; three were at one time Christians; 
seven come from well-to-do families; seven have been closely 
associated with CHOU En-lai over a period of years; six have 
husbands or wives who are also associated with the MFA or the 
diplomatic service; and the wives of three are active in inter-
national Communist fronts. 
1. Of a number who worked before 1949 in the Communist 
underground, many were arrested for Communist activities; at 
least six were deported from foreign countries for Communist 
activities therein; and some had to flee from the China mainland 
for varying periods of time to avoid arrest. 
m. Some who dealt with Americans prior to 1949 and were 
known as friendly and affable (a few even being described as 
"Westernized") have proven sullen and unfriendly in contacts 
with Americans since 1949. Some of those who are known to 
speak English well (such as CHOU En-lai) now insist on carrying 
on all conversations through interpreters. Characteristics

Approved For ReleareiMMIVTIM15. - 78-02646R000300090003-3 
common to most of those in contact with Westerners include 
stubbornness and inflexible adherence to Communist 
(particularly Chinese Communist) doctrine and principles. 
2. Of the 32 others among the 58 leaders, one was a former 
ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic; twelve have formerly 
served in other diplomatic posts abroad; and eight were formerly 
with Alien Affairs Offices of the Ministry of Public Security. 
3. Of the total of 58, three are women; twelve are known officials 
of the People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; four have backgrounds in 
propaganda work; at least eight are ex-military personnel; five have 
served the CCP as political commissars; three are noted for their 
labor activities; two have past records in the field of foreign trade; 
one has been a leader in affairs of Chinese residing overseas; and 
at least two are suspected of having engaged in collection of intelli-
gence. A number of these persons are affiliated with friendship 
associations in Peking. 
4. Almost all of those now assigned to top diplomatic posts abroad 
served for some time in the Peking headquarters of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. Notable among these are the present Ambassadors 
to Ceylon, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, 
Sweden, Sudan, Ghana, Guinea, the UAR, and North Vietnam, and the 
Charges d'Affaires to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 
5. Known language capabilities (varying from slight to fluency 
and some with more than one language) among the 58 key personalities 
considered in this survey include: English - 23, Russian - 12, 
French - 7, German - 5, Japanese - 3, Malayan - 1, Hindustani - 1, 
and Vietnamese - 1. Of the 33 ambassadors and charge's d'affaires, 
the language capabilities of 17 are known, and of these 14 have a 
capability in English ranging from fair to fluent, two of them being 
considered expert in that language. Six are familiar with Russian, 
and 6 of the 17 have capability in some other foreign language. Most 
of the other 16 ambassadors and charges probably have some degree 
of language ability, but pertinent data are not available. At least eight 
in the top echelons of the Foreign Ministry and a dozen or more leaders 
in the PLFA are rated as fluent in English. 
6. Although a few of the 58 are known to have received some 
training in the USSR, none is known to have studied international rela-
tions there or elsewhere abroad. None is known to have been graduated

from the Foreign Service Institute or its successor, the Institute for 
International Relations (LIR.) in Peking, but some may have taken 
refresher courses there. Many have lectured to students of this 
institute. A former dean of the LIR is reported to be first secretary 
of the embassy in Cambodia. 
7. Ten of the 58 participated actively in negotiations with the 
Chinese Nationalists and the Marshall Mission to China in the late 
19401s; others had some peripheral connections with these negotia-
tions, and one was in liaison with UNRRA in Shantung. 
8. Of the present five Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs, four 
previously served as Ambassadors, all but one in Communist nations. 
One of the three Assistants to the Minister was formerly an 
Ambassador, and another accompanied her husband on his tour as 
Ambassador to the USSR. 
9. Four of the six heads of geographical offices have served in 
diplomatic posts abroad, and four of the six have served on other 
MFA desks at Peking headquarters. Of the seven known heads of 
the MFA functional departments, three have held posts in diplomatic 
installations in other countries, one as an ambassador; two have 
served on other desks in the Ministry; and the head of one depart-
ment is concurrently an Assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
10. Only one of the four known top figures in the Institute of 
International Relations is known to have served in another post in 
the MFA. This same person also has had four years of service 
as counselor in Chinese Communist embassies abroad. 
B. CCRFC, ACRFC, AND CPIFA 
11. Significant facts gleaned from analysis of the backgrounds of 
the 23 key officials of the organizations appearing in Attachment 2 are: 
a. The ages of 15 of the 23 are known to average 59 years. 
Most are well educated. 
b. One member of the CCRFC, CHANG Han-fu, is a Vice 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and an alternate member of the 
CCP Central Committee.

STI 14 A. J.J .1.4 X 
c. One of the Vice Chairmen of the CCRFC, who is also a 
member of the Standing Committee of the Executive Council of 
the ACRFC, has long been associated with Chinese Communist 
intelligence services and has traveled abroad under the cover of 
his CCRFC post. Four others connected with the CCRFC or 
CPIFA are known to have had some experience in intelligence 
and security work. 
d. Four members of the Standing Committee of the CCRFC 
Executive Council are full members of the CCP Central Com-
mittee, and one is an alternate member. LIAO Chreng-chih and 
LIU Ning-i, both Deputy Directors of the Staff Office for Foreign 
Affairs, are also on the ACRFC Standing Committee. 
e. Vice Chairmen CEDIA0 Kuan-hua of the CPIFA is an 
Assistant to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Two full members 
and one alternate member of the CCP Central Committee are 
on the CPIFA board of directors. The following six members 
of the CPIFA board of directors also hold or held leading posts 
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: CHANG Wen-chin, CHI 
Pteng-fei, HUANG Hua (became Ambassador to Ghana August 
1960), KUNG Pleng, KtUNG Ta-fei (named counselor, Ghana, 
15 August 1960), and Yt Plei-wen. WANG Yin-plu, a deputy 
secretary general of the CPIFA, was identified in mid-1958 as 
a deputy director of the American and Australian Office of the 
MFA. WANG in 1949-1950 was director of the Peking Alien 
Affairs Office of the Ministry of Public Security. 
f. Of the twenty-three leaders of the CCRFC, ACRFC, and 
CPIFA, twelve are leaders in the so-called friendship associa-
tions (e. g., China-India Friendship Association); eleven are 
officials of or active participants in international Communist 
front organizations; seventeen have traveled widely abroad with 
cultural and other delegations; thirteen were educated abroad; 
three have resided in the U.S. at one time or another; three 
were members of the 1950 Chinese Communist delegation which 
appeared before the U.N. Security Council at Lake Success; and 
two have in the past been connected with the Institute for Pacific 
Relations. The known language capabilities of these 23 leaders 
include English (11), French and Japanese (4 each), German and 
Russian (2 each); and two have previously served in posts in 
Chinese Communist embassies abroad.

C. INTERNATIONAL LIAISON (FOREIGN) DEPARTMENT 
12. The man tentatively identified as the director of the CCP 
International Liaison (Foreign) Department was formerly Ambassador 
to the USSR and later a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. He is also 
the specialist in foreign affairs on the important Party Secretariat. 
One of those believed to be a deputy director of this CCP department 
was formerly Ambassador to Yugoslavia and has held high posts in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 1949, including that of Vice 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1951-1955. Both are full members of 
the CCP Central Committee. 
13. Although confirming data are not always available, sources 
have reported that all holding the posts of director or deputy director 
of the Staff Office for Foreign Affairs, the top posts in the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, and positions as heads and deputy heads of the 
functional departments and geographical offices of the Ministry must 
be members, full or candidate (openly or secretly), of the Communist 
Party of China or the China Young Communist League. This require-
ment also obtains for all holding important diplomatic posts abroad. 
It is probably a prerequisite for the top positions in the Commission 
for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Institute for 
International Relations.
