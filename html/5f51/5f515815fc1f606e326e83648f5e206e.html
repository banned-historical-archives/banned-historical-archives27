 SUBJECT               Monthly Warning Assessment:   China
 1.   Sino-Soviet Affairs
 Analysts agreed that the end of the Moscow round of
 political talks between China and the USSR did not appreciably
 change the situation that had prevailed for months.   The talks
 are due to resume at an unspecified time in Beijing; although
 they have been unproductive -- which was no surprise to analysts the inconclusive ending of this first round and the abundant
 evidence that a stalemate exists did not suggest to analysts that
 tensions have been raised substantially.  At the same time it is
 evident that there has been no progress in reducing tensions
 between the two sides -- the ostensible purpose of the talks.
 Our meeting took place before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
 The events connected with that act are certain to further sour
 Sino-Soviet relations, but do not raise immediate dangers of
 troubles along the common border (assuming China. does not drive
 deep into Vietnam in the near future).   One Soviet payoff in its
 intervention was to encircle China; but in the immediate future
 Moscow will be preoccupied with South Asia to a considerable
 degree.   The Chinese in turn will be deeply concerned and even
 fearful as a result of the Soviet action, but they are likely to
 mask that concern with a show of belligerence.              They are not
 likely, however, to act imprudently and will probably stop short
 of actions so provocative as to invite a Soviet impasse.

 2.   Chinese Internal Situation
 Analysts looked briefly at internal developments, with
 most agreeing that there were signs that Deng's political
 position had again slipped somewhat.   There was general agreement
 that this slippage was not yet great, that Deng's recuperative
 powers were as always considerable, and that the continuing
 political ups and downs in Beijing, while worrisome because they
 were continuing, did not at this juncture signal any danger to
 major US policy interests.
 3.   Indochina Situation
 Analysts generally agreed that the Chinese had put out
 repeated signals that under present circumstances they hope to and expected to -- avoid engaging in another "lesson-teaching"
 operation in Vietnam.   The meeting examined in details various
 indications of Chinese activities in the Sino-Vietnamese border
 area, including some signs of troop movements toward the border.
 There was general agreement, although some minor reservations were
 expressed, that the Chinese appeared to putting just enough pressure
 on the border to keep Hanoi from withdrawing troops from northern
 Vietnam for operations in Kampuchea, and that indications that the
 Chinese planned something on a scale to affect US policy interests
 would be visible before action occurred; such indications were
 not present yet.  Analysts also considered the problem along the
 Thai-Kampuchean border.   There was general agreement that fighting
 was likely to spill over into Thailand, but most analysts believed
 that the Vietnamese were unlikely deliberately to engage Thai
 forces in action, although accidental clashes were very possible.
 There was some division as the consequences of fairly extensive
 Thai-Vietnamese clashes.  Most analysts thought that if these
 occurred well inside Thai borders and raised the possibility of
 Thai political destablization the odds of a Chinese attack on Vietnam
 rose sharply; a strong minority, however, felt that China had clearly
 decided against renewed fighting this year.   This discussion took
 place before the Soviet move into Afghanistan.   Subsequent informal
 and selective soundings suggest that a minority view has developed
 that China might take advantage of presumed Soviet preoccupation
 in South Asia to move against Vietnam.  An opposite, and in the
 view of the chairman of the warning group, more likely result, is
 that the Chinese in the near future will be especially cautious
 about taking actions that would invite a direct Soviet response.

 4. Afghanistan
 As noted, the Soviet action took place after analysts had
 held their monthly meeting.   Some possible ramifications of the
 Soviet move have already been discussed.  The key to the direct
 Chinese response to the Soviet action will be Beijing's attitude
 toward Pakistan, and the key factors here will be how far China
 goes in offering public and private support to the Zia regime, on
 the  one  hand,.  and how far it is prepared to go in providing or
 facilitating support to the Afghan insurgents, on the other.   It
 should be noted that prior to the Soviet invasion the Chinese had
 been urging the Pakistanis not to get deeply involved with the
 insurgent movement -- presumably because they feared the Soviets
 would react by doing precisely what they have not done.  Now that
 the die has been cast Chinese attitudes may change, but Beijing
 is likely to maintain an acute awareness of Pakistani vulnerability.
 The next two weeks should give firm indications of the direction
 in which China plans to move.

 Comments on State Morning Summary Item:
 Important PRC Party Sessions Ahead
 1.  Action Requested:  None, this memorandum is for your
 information only.
 2.  Background: You asked for comments on the item in the
 20 January State Morning Summary on PRC:  Important Party Sessions
 Ahead.   State is correct in predicting major PRC Party sessions
 this year.   Intelligence reports have spoken of sessions of the
 11th Party Congress' 5th Plenum this spring followed by a 12th
 Party Congress later on, which would both determine the position
 in history of the Cultural Revolution and examine the roles of
 leaders such as Liu Shaogi who was purged by Mao in this period.
 Revitalizing the Party cadre structure will be another major
 goal.
 3.  However, it is premature to speculate that Hua Guofeng
 may lose his position as Party Premier.   The top leadership in
 Beijing has bent over backwards to maintain Party unity, and
 Hua Guofeng's demotion (even if he were given the honorific
 position of PRC State Chairman) would unquestionably generate grave
 strains.   Moreover, Hua Guofeng represents the next generation of
 leaders coming along with whom the present generation must cooperate;
 those in their 70s and 80s will soon be passing the baton to those
 in their 50s and 60s.  Deng Xiaoping and his contemporaries will not
 want to offend needlessly the members of the oncoming generation.
 In fact, an effort clearly has been underway in recent months
 (presumably under Deng's direction) to build up Hua Guofeng as a
 leader in his own right.

 4. Nevertheless the problem of ridding the Party_qr-=-deadwood
 is a major one and will unquestionably produce much tension and
 encounter considerable resistance.  We might know more about the
 nature of the problem and possible solutions when we see the full
 text of the 16 January speech by Deng Xiaoping which was cited
 in the State Morning Summary.  All we have so far is press reports, .
 and we do not know either the circumstances or the nature of the
 audience.                                                        Deng
 Xiaoping was addressing a meeting of senior officials and reporting
 to them on the Cultural Revolution.   He allegedly gave a very
 negative evaluation of that political process -- another indication
 that the PRC's priority task will be to maintain Party unity.

 Q's and A's for the DCI Worldwide Briefing Asia
 Q -- How do you expect the Chinese to react to the Soviet invasion of
 Afghanistan?  Will they give aid to the rebels?
 A -- The Chinese have denounced the Soviet invasion very strongly, and
 they have said that they will give aid to the Afghan rebels.
 Huang Rua, the Chinese Foreign Minister, has just been in Pakistan
 and he made it plain in a press conference there that China would
 provide assistance not only to the Afghans but also to Pakistan
 to help it resist further Soviet aggression.  We would expect that
 any aid to the Afghans would go through the Pakistanis, however --
 although China has a common frontier with Afghanistan, it might just
 be a little too much for the Soviets to take to see China send
 military equipment directly across its border to the forces fighting
 the Soviet troops in Afghanistan.
 (I believe that the DCI answer to the question on this
 subject on 24 January was just right)

 Q -- Will the US eventually sell arms to China?
 A -- While we have announced that we are prepared to consider, on a
 case-by-case basis, the sale to China to certain carefully-selected
 items of support equipment also suitable for military use, e.g.,
 trucks, communications gear, and certain types of early warning
 radar, we have also made it clear that we have not changed our
 position on not having any plans to sell arms or weapons systems to
 China.
 Q     What about the item in the New York Times quoting a senior official
 as saying that the list of what we sell to China could be expanded
 in time to include more sophisticated items such as transport planes
 and battlefield computers?
 A -- I believe that the note to stress here is the reference to "in time."
 Much would depend on how the circumstances develop in Afghanistan
 and other areas of the world where the Soviet Union is attempting to
 expand its influence, as well as on the rate of progress in our
 relations with China.

 The following items were considered by the Community Repre-
 sentatives:
 1.  North Korea-South Korea -- Analysts were not aware of any
 change in order of battle on either side of the DMZ which would suggest
 hostilities, nor was anything of significance noted in terms of the
 upgrading of North Korean military capabilities.   The "trench" discovered
 in North Korea north of the Han River estuary was regarded as being a
 defensive tank barrier; there were indications of possible construction
 of a defensive nature in the North elsewhere along the DMZ.   Further
 information will be needed to reach a firm judgment as to the purpose
 of  this

 The main new element addressed was the political appeal by
 the 'North to elements in the South to resume talks on reunification,
 as conveyed in the twelve letters sent to South Korean political figures
 including the Prime Minister.   It was agreed that inclusion of the
 Prime Minister was a sizeable concession by the North, which has hitherto
 not openly acknowledged the R-OK government as a body with whom it would
 have to deal.  Presumably the North's intent was to capitalize upon
 the disarray in the South following the 12 December incident (and of
 course the Park Chong-hee assassination) by creating divisions within
 political structure, but the new approach was nevertheless significant
 and would require watching.      I
 The question was raised about a possible Chinese role in the
 North's new political campaign.  Doubts were expressed that the Chinese
 knew in advance about the twelve letters, although as recently as 22
 January the Chinese Military Attache in Washington was emphasizing to

 US contacts that there would be no attack by the North and urging
 the US to pay attention to what it was doing.  Rather, the North
 Korean overtures, as evidenced by a series of high-level Party and
 Army meetings from the 18th to the 22nd of December, appeared to be
 an internal response to the situation in the South with a consequent
 shift in strategy and possibly in policy.   It was assumed that the
 North would spin out this new political campaign before contemplating

 Recalling speculation in December that a major Vietnamese
 offensive was anticipated against Kampuchean resistance forces operating
 near the Thai-Kampuchea border, analysts discussed the apparent failure
 of this offensive to materialize.   One point of view held that the
 offensive was, in fact, presently underway although not on the scale
 anticipated and with the Kampucheans avoiding combat.   Frequency of
 Vietnamese cross border operations had been stepped up, involving
 reconnaissance, movement of troops into blocking positions, and
 implantation of.mines.  Major clashes had not occurred ,thou h  and the
 Thai appeared to be avoiding contact with the Vietnamese
 It was also speculated that toward the end of December,
 Vietnamese plans had been scaled down and tactics changed due to Hanoi's
 sensitivity to the pressure of international public opinion.   Conceivably
 Hanoi had decided to live with the current situation on the grounds
 that the Thai border was sufficiently sealed off to keep Kampuchean
 resistance at a tolerable level, political trends internationally were
 in Vietnam's favor, and elsewhere in Kampuchea Hanoi was getting what it
 wanted in terms of internal control.  Vietnamese forces were digging in
 form'long stay,_including planting crops and bringing in NCO's from

 s not to involve the US and China in defense of Thailand.
 It was pointed out that while Hanoi might indeed have decided
 .to live with the situation, it was bearing a very heavy burden as a
 consequence and following the course which Chinese strategy had hoped
 for.  A Vietnamese decision to launch the kind of operation predicted
 earlier was not ruled out.  Also not ruled out was some Soviet role in
 influencing the nature and intensity of Vietnamese operations.   The
 assurance on Vietnam's actions given in early January by the Soviet
 Ambassador to Thailand to Ambassador Ambramowitz were noted.   In

 Q -- What intelligence reports do we have of possible Vietnamese attacks
 on refugee camps in Thailand, as reported in Sunday's Washington Post?
 A -- As the article in the Post indicated, we have no hard evidence that
 any such attacks may take place,
 WC
 would expect that the Vietnamese would be attacking Kampuchean resistance
 forces among the refugees and in refugee camps rather than striking just
 at refugees themselves.  We are aware that the Vietnamese have been
 conducting small-scale intelligence penetrations of Thailand to
 pinpoint the location of the Kampuchean resistance elements.   Actually,
 we have been anticipating for over a month some form of stepped-up
 military action by the Vietnamese in the Thai-Kampuchean border area
 against Pol Pot and other Kampuchean forces, with the possibility
 that hostilities might spill over into Thailand.  However, it simply
 hasn't happened, or at least on anything like the scale we had
 anticipated.  It may be that the Vietnamese are still thinking over
 carefully the risks to them of expanding the conflict in this area.
 We are monitoring developments very closely.

 Note that hard evidence of chemical
 warfare use in SEA is still lacking,
 although a strong circumstantial case has
 been built up through interrogations of
 refugees.  An Army medical team visited
 the Lao-Thailand border area last fall to
 investigate, inerrrogate, and if possible,
 collect samples.   It was unsuccessful in
 this last regard.

 South Fast Asia - Chemica,i Warfare
 The Vietnamese and Laotian forces have used chemical
 warfare agents against the }among tribesman for a period
 of more than three years, beginning in 1976.   Refugees
 and other sources provide a story of repeated chemical
 attacks on civilian populations for the purpose of completely
 eliminating the Hmongs.   The refugees consistently relate
 a pattern of employment which includes rockets,  spray and
 artillery weapons.   The symptoms
 lead us to be li.eve that there were three types
 o.  cnernical agents used:   a nerve agent, a riot control
 agent, and an unknown chemical or combination of chemicals.
 the CW agents
 pro a  y were supplied to Vietnamese and Laotian forces
 by the USSR.   It is probable that training in the use of
 CW agents also was provided by the Soviets.
 In addition to Hmong tribesmen, the chemical attacks
 reportedly destroyed large numbers of domestic animals
 including oxen, swine and chickens.
 We believe that CW munitions are stored at Xiang
 Khoang  (Military Region II), Savannakhet (Military Region
 III), and Pakse (Military Region IV).   The latest reported
 use of. CW against the Hmong was in August 1979.
 Kampuchea (Cambod_i a)
 Numerous radio reports and press releases have been
 received since October 1978 on the use of CW by Vietnamese
 forces in Kampuchea against Kampuchean dissidents,
 particularly the Khmer Rouge.   Descriptions of symptoms
 observed in victims of CW attacks were similar to those
 reported by refugee Hmong tribesmen from Laos and indicate
 that the same CW agents were used.

 If the Vietnamese and their Kampuchean collaborators
 are not successful in wiping out major resistance in
 Kampuchea, it is probable that they will resort to greater
 use of chemical warfare against dissident forces.
 Hard evi encc  that  the Vietnamese are emplo3Ju; CW
 in Laos and Kampuchea will depend nn our ability t~tai_i
 an environmental sample that is contaminated with a CW
 agent rrom a point near a_,tV  atnr  on the  ability
 to o serve a victim immediately after being dosed with a.
 UJWV agent.   Air, soil, vegetation, water samples con-
 taminated with the CW agent are prime candidates for
 analysis.     Other types of samples are contaminated cloth-
 ing, blood samples, and spent shells or casings.   Care
 should be exercised in shipping the material for analysis
 to avoid losing the CW material in the sample by evaporation
 or degradation; sealed containers are preferable.

 The following items were considered by the Community Repre-
 sentatives:
 1.  North Korea-South Korea -- Analysts were not aware of any
 change in order of battle on either side of the DMZ which would suggest
 hostilities, nor was anything of significance noted in terms of the
 upgrading of North Korean military capabilities.   The "trench" discovered
 in North Korea north of the Han River estuary was regarded as being a
 defensive tank barrier; there were indications of possible construction
 of a defensive nature in the North elsewhere along the DMZ.   Further
 information will be needed to reach a firm judgment as to the purpose
 of this construction, however.
 The main new element addressed was the political appeal by
 the North to elements in the South to resume talks on reunification,
 as conveyed in the twelve letters sent to South Korean political figures
 including the Prime Minister.   It was agreed that inclusion of the
 Prime Minister was a sizeable concession by the North, which has hitherto
 not openly acknowledged the ROK government as a body with whom it would
 have to deal.  Presumably the North's intent was to capitalize upon
 the disarray in the South following the 12 December incident (and of
 course the Park Chong-hee assassination) by creating divisions within
 political structure, but the new approach was nevertheless significant
 and would require watching.
 The question was raised about a possible Chinese role in the
 North's new political campaign.  Doubts were expressed that the Chinese
 knew in advance about the twelve letters, although as recently as 22
 January the Chinese "Military Attache in Washington was emphasizing to

 US contacts that there would be no attack by the North and urging
 the US to pay attention to what it was doing.   Rather, the North
 Korean overtures, as evidenced by a series of high-level Party and
 Army meetings from the 18th to the 22nd of December, appeared to be
 an internal response to the situation in the South with a consequent
 shift in strategy and possibly in policy.   It was assumed that the
 North would spin out this new political campaign before contemplating

 Recalling speculation in December that a major Vietnamese
 offensive was anticipated against Kampuchean resistance forces operating
 near the Thai-Kampuchea border, analysts discussed the apparent failure
 of this offensive to materialize.   One point of view held that the
 offensive was, in fact, presently underway although not on the scale
 anticipated and with the Kampucheans avoiding combat.   Frequency of
 Vietnamese cross border operations had been stepped up, involving
 reconnaissance, movement of troops into blocking positions, and
 implantation of mines.  Major clashes had not occurred,thou h  and the
 Thai appeared to be avoiding contact with the Vietnamese
 It was also speculated that toward the end of December,
 Vietnamese plans had been scaled down and tactics changed due to Hanoi's
 sensitivity to the pressure of international public opinion.   Conceivably
 Hanoi had decided to live with the current situation on the grounds
 that the Thai border was sufficiently sealed off to keep Kampuchean
 resistance at a tolerable level, political trends internationally were
 in Vietnam's favor, and elsewhere in Kampuchea Hanoi was getting what it
 wanted in terms of internal control.  Vietnamese forces were digging in
 for a long stay, including planting crops and bringing in NCO's from

 It was pointed out that while Hanoi might indeed have decided
 to live with the situation, it was bearing a very heavy burden as a
 consequence and following the course which Chinese strategy had hoped
 for.  A Vietnamese decision to launch the kind of operation predicted
 earlier was not ruled out.  Also not ruled out was some Soviet role in
 influencing the nature and intensity of Vietnamese operations.   The
 assurance on Vietnam's actions given in early January by the Soviet
 Ambassador to Thailand to Ambassador Ambramowitz were noted.   In
 addition, there was speculation that Vietnam was exercising restraint
 so as not to involve the US and China in defense of Thailand.  (S)
 No particular change in the nature and level of the Soviet
 military presence in Vietnam was noted, although further coverage of

 No one foresaw any particular part for Sihanouk to play under
 present circumstances.   He was still scheduled to visit the US in
 February, but his visit to Singapore had apparently been "postponed"
 indefinitely. II

 SUBJECT .             Warning Assessment:   China
 The following items were considered by the Community Repre-
 sentatives at the meeting on 21 January:
 1.   Sino-Soviet Affairs
 No increase in tensions along the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Mongolian
 borders had been observed; order of battle on both sides remained
 essentially unchanged, with no special preparations perceived.  While
 there had been a step-up in Soviet aerial surveillance of the border
 areas, the Chinese had not reacted.   The Soviets had undertaken a
 rotation of troops in Mongolia which involved a larger number of
 flights than on previous occasions, but     particular significance
 Impact of the Afghanistan situation on Sino-Soviet relations
 was noted in the fact that the Chinese had deferred at least until
 later this year the resumption of the Sino-Soviet talks on mutual
 relationships.   (The annual talks on navigation along the Amur and
 Ussuri rivers were to resume on 5 February, however.)   The Chinese
 press had strongly attacked the Soviet involvement, and Huang Hua
 in Pakistan had said that Chinese would assist both Pakistan and
 the Afghan resistance forces.  Analysts agreed that Chinese aid to
 Afghan dissidents would not be direct but would go via Pakistan.
 In any event, the route through the Watkhan corridor was probably
 snowbound this time of year.  No increase in Chinese air strength at

 Relating Afghanistan to the Sino-Soviet border situation, the
 Soviets had included the Transbaikal MR among nine such districts
 which had been called on to furnish troops to replace reservists
 called up for the move into Afghanistan.   It was possible tha
 Far Eastern MR would also be called upon to furnish troops
 Further relating to Afghanistan developments, it was observed
 that the Soviets had attacked Huang Hua's visit to Pakistan, which
 occurred just after Secretary Brown's visit to China, as evidence
 of Sino-US "collusion." The presence in China of a Pakistani military
 mission was commented upon; the mission's purpose was reportedly
 to check on the availability of Chinese weaponry, including MIG-21's.
 (Analysts questioned the willingness of the Chinese to provide MIG-21
 aircraft given the limited number in the Chinese AOB.)   Sixteen
 Chinese MIG-19's (F-6's) had been delivered to Pakistan in January.
 Finally, analysts called attention to Chinese concern over the
 role of India, with consequent attention to the need for improving
 Sino-Indian relations.
 2.  Indochina Situation
 There was considerable discussion of the apparent failure of the
 Vietnamese offensive against Kampuchean resistance forces in the
 Thai-Kampuchean border area to materialize.  A Vietnamese troop
 strength of seven to nine divisions in this general area was reported,
 but the strategy of the Pol Pot forces evidently was to avoid combat
 and move away from the borders, thus making Vietnamese operations
 difficult.   It was further possible that the Vietnamese had reached
 the conclusion that there was no unit  among the various Kampuchean
 groups and hence no real threat
 Another possibility addressed was that Vietnam's perceptions of
 the international scene had a bearing on the situation, e.g., the
 possibe involvement of the US and the Chinese if Vietnamese operations
 spilled over into Thailand and stirred up Thai resistance.   Vietnam
 and Moscow may  well have heeded US warnings sent to both.   China
 was perhaps already taking credit for pinning the Vietnamese down
 along the Sino-Vietnam border.   Vietnam may in addition have made an
 assessment of the strength of Thai and ASEAN reactions.   In this
 regard, some adjustments in the Thai/ASEAN position toward accommodating
 Vietnam had been observed  which could have generated a degree of
 Vietnamese response. I
 One point of view held that the Soviets may have influenced Vietnam
 to cool the situation in the light of Soviet moves in Afghanistan.
 Admiral Gorshikov was in Hanoi on 22 December, the date of the Vietnamese
 offensive supposedly was to begin (Vietnamese Army Day), and could have

 passed along a message to the Vietnamese.   Soviet pressure could
 have been exerted through the logistical support being given to
 Vietnam by the USSR; some effects on Vietnam of diminished Soviet
 logistical support had already been observed in the wake of Thai
 curtailment of Soviet overflights to Vietnam.
 Nevertheless, it was emphasized that Soviet military assistance
 to Vietnam was continuing, most notably in the arrival in that
 country of Fitter ground support aircraft (the SU-7, not the SU-17).
 Conceivably what we were witnessing now was just a temporary hiatus
 in Vietnamese operations, with the anticipated offensive still to
 come.   The fact that Vietnam was still spread out and pinned down in
 Kampuchea, with consequent drain on its manpower and ec
 resources, could hardly be pleasing to the Vietnamese. I
 3.   Chinese Internal Situation
 Analysts commented on the apparent development of a conservative
 trend in China's handling of its internal affairs, as marked by Deng
 Xiaoping's 17 January speech (which criticized inter alia "big
 character posters").  Deng himself might have come under pressure
 from  colleagues concerned with public order and discipline to back
 away from some of the more liberal positions he had taken earlier
 on individual rights. However, Deng's tactics had been to press
 forward on an issue, move back when resistance was encountered, and
 then make a new thrust. He was now pressing cadre reform from within
 the Party, and may have felt it expedient to take a softer line on
 other questions while handling the very sensitive matter of cadre
 New faces were reported as appearing at the Party Center,
 representing leaders identified with Deng Xiaoping.  One such was
 Zhao Ziyang (brought in from Xichuan), who could be slated for a
 senior position in the Party Secretariat.   It was speculated that
 if such were the case, Deng was possibly seeking to create in the
 Secretariat an alternate center of power to the Politburo.   Leadership
 trends were likely to become clearer later in 1980, when the 5th Plenum
 of the 11th Party Congress was expected, followed by the 12th Party
 Congress.  A final evaluation of the Cultural Revolution could be
 expected from t    e meetings as well as indications of leadership
 changes.
 No serious threats to Party unity, national stability, and the
 personal position of Deng Xiaoping were believed to exist at this
 time.  It was noted that military modernization had not become

 a contentious issue, and that the military had been surprisingly
 quiet in the face of the lower order of priority assigned to
 modernization of the PLA.
