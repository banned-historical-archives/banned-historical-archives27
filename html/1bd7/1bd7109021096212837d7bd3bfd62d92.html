INDOCHINA 
Hanoi media have characteristically all but ignored the Le Duc 
Tho-Kissinger private talks on the draft Vietnam peace accord, 
held daily in Paris from 20 through 26 November. VNA's inter-
national service on the 26th issued a one-sentence "communique" 
saying there would be a meeting again on 4 December, but the 
announcement is not known to have been carried in domestic 
Vietnamese communist media. VNA also reported that Tho and 
Xuan Thuy had met with the PRG delegation on the 27th "to make 
assessments" following the latest DRV-U.S. private meetings but 
did not mention that the talks had been suspended for a week. 
Hanoi's stand at the private talks seemed reflected, however, 
in two NHAN DAN articles coinciding with their suspension. Both 
bore the authoritative signature "Commentator"--a label long 
used for significant comment on the political settlement issue. 
The articles pictured Hanoi as determined to stand firm on the 
basic points of the peace accord as summarized on 26 October, 
particularly on the issue of North Vietnamese troops in the South. 
The second of the two articles, on the 27th, warned that only 
stalemate can result if the U.S. side tries to negotiate from a 
position of strength "in hope of changing the situation." 
Three days after signing the annual aid agreement with the DRV, 
Peking released "an important statement" on the 29th by Foreign 
Minister Chi Peng-fei expressing concern over the state of the 
Vietnam negotiations while voicing hope that a settlement will 
be achieved. Chi's remarks were only mildly critical of the 
United States and included a pro forma pledge of support for the 
war effort. Peking publicized the aid agreement with minimal 
fanfare, but Hanoi used the occasion to further its campaign to 
associate the Chinese more closely with its cause. 
Moscow propaganda has a time-marking quality, with coriventators 
continuing to repeat Brezhnev's 13 November demand that American 
"obstacles" to signing of the peace accord be removed. Moscow 
reported on 27 November that the DRV economic delegation had 
arrived to discuss the 1973 aid agreement.

detail than previously President Thieu's contentions that an 
agreement should recognize that there are two separate 
Vietnamese countries and should 'Provide for the withdrawal of 
North Vietnamese troops from the South. Mar _ commentators 
on the cve of the resumed private talks had first explicitly 
mentioned Thieu's demand that North Vietnamese troops 
withdraw; QUAN DOI NHAN DAN and NHAN DAN articles on the 
19th and 20th had assailed Indonesian officials for supporting 
Thieu's demands that all forces not native to the area below 
the 17th parallel be withdrawn.* At the 16 November plenary 
session of the Paris talks, DRV delegatc Xuan Thuy, as reported 
in the VNA account, "categorically rejecteo the Saigon adminis-
tration's absurd claims about 'North Vietnam's invasion of 
South Vietnam' and 'mutual troop withdrawal,' which in the past 
has been used by the United States to justify the aggression 
from Washing.:on." 
The NHAN DAN Commentator article on the 25th elaborated on these 
remarks when it noted that on 27 October Thieu had said: The 
draft peace agreement "makes no reference to North Vietnamese 
aggression or to auy North Vietnamese troop withdrawal. North 
Vietnam believes that it has the right to remain in the South. 
It is waiting for a complete U.S. troop withdrawal so it can 
renew the offensive." Commentator went on to observe that 
Thieu's representatives at Paris "have repeatedly falsely accuPed 
our people of aggression against the southern part of our country," 
and it said GVN delegate Nguyen Xuan Phong at the 2 November 
session had "noisily propagandized that Saigon would not accept 
any cease-fire without a withdrawal of northern troops and 
restoration of the DMZ." Commentator's reporting on remarks 
by Phong at Paris is at complete variance with Hanoi's usual 
studied avoidance of even mentioning the Saigon statements there. 
Commentator indicated that Hanoi regards Thieu's arguments 
about the DMZ and North Vietnamese troops as academic and the 
issues settled when he declared pointedly that the United 
States, in agreeing to the draft peace accord, had pledged tu 
respect the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial 
integrity of Vietnam and had agreed that the problem of the 
Vietnamese armed forces in South Vietnam "shall be solved by the 
two South Vietnamese sides."

Commentator had preceded this passage with the communistn' 
standard euphemistic argument in defense of the North Vietnamese 
presence in the South, saying that the U.S. "imperialists" are 
the aggressors and the Vietnamese people the victims of 
aggression and that the right of self-defense is sacred.* 
Commentator said that in the past four years negotiations have 
been deadlocked because of U.S. charges that the North has 
waged aggression against the South and persistent U.S. 
demands for mutual withdrawal of troops. (The 19 November 
QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article assailing Indonesian officials for 
supporting Thieu had observed that "the worn-out demand" for 
mutual troop withdrawal "has even been set aside by the 
Americans.") But Commentator did not link U.S. dropping of this 
demand with the recent peace agreement. Instead he said that 
the negotiations "recently emerged from deadlock because of 
our side's efforts permeated with good will," and he went on to 
quote, as noted above, the provisions from the peace accord on 
respect for Vietnam unity and on the South Vietnamese parties' 
solving the question of Vietnamese armed forces in the South. 
He went on to cite the pasbages in the accord to the effect that 
the problems to be dis:assed by the South Vietnamese include 
measures "to reduce he troop ceiling of the two sidea' armed 
forces and to demobilize the troops being reduced." 
Recalling that Hanoi's 26 October summary was publicly confirmed 
by "the highest echelons" on the S. side, Commentator warned 
that there can be no peace if these major principles are not 
recognized. Saying it is unlikely that "the Washington 
authorities" do not understand this, he asked why they have 
stepped up their military activity and brought up, through Th..,eu, 
* Assertions by U.S. and other Western news commentators that 
Hanoi does not acknowledge the presence of North Vietnamese troops 
in the South ;lave oversimplified Hanoi's stance in this regard. 
In 1966 and 1967 VNA did issue a series of authorized denials that 
there were VPA troops in the South. But in 1968, and particularly 
after the opening of the DRV-U.S. talks in May and the U.S. calls 
for mutual troop withdrawal, Hanoi begged the question and shifted 
to the argument that Vietnamese have a right to defend their 
country wherever tile aggressor is. Most notably, DRV Premier Pham 
Van Dong in a speech before the DRV National Assembly in May of 
that year leclared that wherever there are enemies, "every 
Vietnamese has the right to go there to fight them." He observed 
that it was necessary to highlight thir point in order to reject 
the "absurd arguments" that. North Vietnam has "invaded" South 
Vietnam.

basic issues already agreed to. Commentator concluded by warning 
that if the United States "attempts to upset the whole game," 
the Vietnamese will have no alternative to continuation of their 
struggle. 
The notion that Hanoi would not agree to any major changes in 
the peace accord was reinforced in the second NHAN DAN 
Commentator artille on the 27th. It declared that the U.S. 
refusal to sign the agreement on schedule as well as "the 
subsequent overbearing allegations advanced by lackey Nguyen 
Van Thieu and drummed up feverishly by the U.S. press and 
ruling circles have gradually dispersed the silhouette of 
peace so recently painted by many U.S. journalists." 
Commentator said that the peace accord made public last month 
remains the best way to end the conflict and that apparent 
U.S. efforts to try to reverse the situation "can orly bring 
stalemate." Ccmmentator did not in this article bring up 
substantive issnes in contention but instead stressed the 
alleged failure of U.S. military policy in Vietnam and warned 
that the latest "re-Americanizaticr." through the massive use of 
air powsr was suffering the same fate. The article concluded 
that "the Vietnamese people deem it necessary to tell the U.S. 
authorities once again that negotiating from a position of 
strength is not a fruitful way of negotiating." It added that 
if the U.S. side is intent on going back on the points agreed on, 
"our people, with the sympathy and support of the fraternal 
socialist countries and all mankind, are determined to fight on 
until total victory." 
Since the appearance of the Commentator articles Hanoi has 
broadcast no siolificant comment bearing on the issues in 
contention. But the Front's LIBERATION PRESS AGENCY (LrA) on 
28 November carried an article by its Commentator which 
echoed the NHAN DAN article of the 25th regarding Thieu's 
demands on troop withdrawal and the DMZ. LPA said flatly that 
the Nixon Administration is "playing a farce" in delaying the 
signing of the agreement on ending the war and accused it of 
having inspired Thieu's o?position. Like AN DAN, LPA noted 
that Thien "colts South and North Vietnam two separate states," 
is "clamoring" for the North to withdraw its troops from the 
South, and has sal.d he would not accept a cease-fire without 
the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops and restoration of the 
DMZ. Prior to the current articles, neither Hanoi nor the Front 
had explicitly mentioned Thieu's remarks about the DMZ, 
although there had been a few mentions of his opposition to

unification and his desire to perpetuate the partition of 
Vietnam. DRV press sp(*.esman Nguyen Thanh Le, when asked--at 
the briefing after the Paris session on 16 November--whether 
pending reunification the DRV is for or against restoration 
of the DM2, said tersely: "There are clauses in the 
agreement dealing with the reunification of Vietnam and with 
relations between the two zones during the period prior to 
reunification." In keeping with standard practice, Hanoi 
media did not report the press briefing. 
Use of the Commentator article as the format for the recent 
discussion of substantive issues in contention appears to 
invest the discussion with special importance. This long-
standing vehicle for major comment on a political settlement had 
not been used since Hanoi's 26 October release of the summary 
of the peace agreement. Notable substantive comment on a 
settlement had appeared in the two unsigned NHAN DAN and QUAN 
DOI NHAN DAN aticles attacking the Indonesidns on the 19th and 
20th and in a series of four NHAN DAN editorials from 8 through 
11 November which touched on such issues as political prisoners, 
a cease-fire, an administrative structure in the South, and the 
unity of Vietnam.* Hanoi has presumably used the NHAN DAN 
Commentator format now out of concern to lend authority to a 
declaration of intent to stand on the draft agreement on this 
issue. Hanoi may also have wished to argue the reasonableness 
of its position by calling special attention to the fact that 
the 26 October summary indicated that the problems to be 
discussed between the two South Vietnamese sides include 
"measures to reduce the troop ceiling of the two sides' armed 
forces and to demobilize the troops being reduced." 
The two most recent previous NHAN DAN Commentator articles were 
particularly significant: The one of 31 August was the first 
clear public Hanoi signal of a resumption of serious negotiations. 
The one of 25 September pressed the 11 September PRG statement's 
proposal for a tripartite provisional coalition government and 
argued that the United States should stop trying to "eliminate" 
the PRG and recognize the reality of South Vietnam, where there 
were f-wo administrations and two ardes--"realities" that were 
to be stressed in Hanoi's 26 October summary of the draft peace 
accord.**

PEKING SIGNS AID PACT WITH DRV, APPEALS FOR SETTLEMENT 
Three days after signing the annual aid agreement with the DRV, 
Peking expressed both concern over the state of negotiations on 
a Vietnam settlement and hope that an agreement will still be 
reached. Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei, speaking at an 
Albanian reception on 29 November, complained that the United 
States not only has "backed out from the schedule" for signing 
the (holt accord but has been attempting to Isne "substantive 
changes" in the agreement. Observing that the communist side 
has shown "the greatest flexibility" in the negotiations, Chi 
declared that the Chinese "still hope" tEat the U.E. Government 
"will through negctiations" sign the agreement. 
NCNA disseminated a separate report on Chi's remarks on Vietnan,, 
labeling them ?'an important statement" on the Vietnam-U.S. 
negotiations, "which the people throughout the world are closel-; 
watching." After having issued a spate of authoritative 
pronouncements in the wake of Hanoi's disclosure of the draft 
accord on 26 October, Peking had taken a low posture on the 
Vietnam question while awalting tht results of the resumed Paris 
negotiations. In now choosing to make a new appeal for a 
settlement, Peking has sought to strike a balance between 
mildly questioning Washington's desire for a settlement and 
expressing hope that an agreement can be negotiated. Chi 
remarked that people have reason to ask whether the United 
States truly wants a aettlament or is trying to prolong the war 
by making use of the negotiations, but he did not specify what 
substantive changes nu.y be at issue and observed blandly that 
people throughout the world are now watching what move Washington 
will take next. 
Significantly, Chi introduced the element of Chtnece interest when 
he pointed out that a Vietnam settlement would be "greatly 
helpful" toward a relaxation of tension in the Far East. The 
Chinese have previously singled out the Vietnam conflict as the 
primary source of tension in Asia at a time of growing detente, 
and the Shanghai communique on President Nixon's visit linked 
U.S. withdrawal from Taiwan--a central PRC interest?with the 
prospects of diminishing tension "in the area." 
As to be expected, Chi concluded with a pledge of colttinuing 
Chinese support for the war effort should the fighting be 
prolonged. Peking had given only miuimal fanfare to the signing 
of the annual aid agreement on the 26th and muffled its expressions

of support for its Vietnamese allies. In contrast, Hanoi used 
the signing of the aid agreement to press its effort to 
assyziate the Chinese closely with its cause, notably publiciz-
ing strong supporting remarks made by Chou En-lai after the 
signing ceremony that have not been reported by Peking itself. 
After having reported that new talks were in the offing, Peking 
has not explicitly mentioned the new round of Kissinger-Tho 
negotiations since their inception on the 20th. Chinese 
pickups of foreign comment on the Vietnam questiod, typically 
sanitized to soften criticism of the Nixon Administration and 
its intentions concerning a settlement, have included the 25 
and 27 November NHAN DAN Commentator articles on a peace settle-
ment. 
AID ACCORD NCNA reported that an agreement on China's 
'economic and military materials assistance" in 
1973 and a protocol on the "supply of military equipment and 
materials" for Vietnam in 1973 were signed on 26 November, noting 
for the first time that the annual grant was "gratuitous." 
(NCNAts report on the supplementary aid agreement for 1972 
signed on 26 June mentioned a protocol on the supply of 
"ordinary materials" and one on "military equipment and material," 
only the latter being characterized as gratuitous.) As in 
past years, VNA said the agreement covered "nonrefund" aid. 
The agreement was signed by DRV Vice Premier Le Thanh Nghi and 
his Chinese counterpart, Li Hsien-nien, both of whom had 
returned to Peking the previous day after separate week-long 
tours of Chinese provinces (Li having accompanied the visiting 
Nepalese prime minister). Consistent with DRV Premier Dong's 
attendance at signing ceremonies in Hanoi last September and 
with the customary practice in Peking in previous years, Chou 
witnessed the signing ceremony. 
NCNA's account disclosed that after the ceremony Chou and Li 
had "a very cordial and friendly conversation" with the North 
Vietnamese but reported none of its substance. Last year's 
NCNA account of the signing ceremony in Hanoi said the two 
sides "enthusiastically proposed toasts to the new development" 
of Sino-Vietnamese solidarity, ana at the time of the 1970 
agreement Peking specified that the aid was to help defedt the 
United States and strengthen the Vietnamese resistance. 
Peking's coverage this year was also subdued in reporting the 
DRV delegation's departure, failing to spell out the usual 
slogans shouted by the airport chorus in behalf of Sino-Vietnamese

solidarity. NCNA noted that the delegation was departing for 
"some European countries," indirectly indicating the next 
stop by noting the presence at the airport of Soviet 
Ambassador Tolstikov. 
As in its coverage of the beginning stage of the DRV 
delegation's visit to China, Hanoi made pointed efforts to 
link the Chinese with its interests on both the military and 
the negotiating fronts. In particular, VNA on 28 November 
disseminated a separate report on Chou's conversation with 
the DRV delegation after the signing ceremony that included 
the substance of remarks exchanged by the two sides. 
According to VNA, Chou "reaffirmed the unswerving stand of 
China to resolutely support and assist" the Vietnamese struggle 
and "severely condemned the obdurate attitude of the U.S. 
Government in trying to delay" the signing of the draft 
accord and "scheming to revise" its provisions. In an 
intriguing remark touching the sore point in Sino-Vietnamese 
relations, Chou asserted that in no circumstances will Peking 
allow the United States "to do harm to the friendship and 
militant solidarity" between China and Vietnam. These remarks 
were notably more militant than those contained in Chi 
Peng-fei's "important statement" on the 29th. 
VNA quoted Nghi as having stressed the "great significa-ce" 
of the aid agreement, "especially now that the U.S. 
imperialists are persisting in their obduracy and reversing 
their attitude by stalling the ending of their war of 
aggression." In addition, VNA's account of the delegation's 
departure from Peking quoted slogans voiced by the Chinese 
in support of Sino-Vietnamese solidarity and the Vietnamese 
struggle. The customary NHAN DAN editorial on the 28th 
hailing the aid agreement also highlighted Peking's support, 
citing recent Chinese pledges contained in the 30 October 
government statement, Li Hsien-nien's banquet speech on 
16 November, and Chou's remarks during a talk with Nghi on 
the 17th. NCNA's account of the editorial omitted the 
passage citing those pledges. It also deleted a sentence 
stressing the "great importance in the present situation" 
of aid from China "and other fraternal socialist countries."

agreement, accusing the United Staces of using Saigon's obduracy 
as a pretext for delay while stepping up military activities in 
Indochina. Moscow carried brief reports noting the private 
talks between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho and mentioned them in 
passing in some comment. TASS briefly reported Kissinger's 
return home and his consultations with President Nixon as well 
as the White House announcement that Kissinger would return to 
Paris for talks to b* resumed on 4 December. TASS also reported 
that Le Duc Tho conallted with Mme. Binh on tile confidential 
talks with the United States. 
Commentdtors continue to repeat Brezhnev's 13 November demand 
that American "obstacles" to signing of the accord be removed, 
one foreign-language commentary on 22 November doting that the 
Washington POST had said this was the Soviet Union's 'first 
big criticism of U.S. policy on the issue." While Moscow's 
comment for the most part has avoided discussing the substance 
of the peace agreement, the issue of a cease-fire wan raised 
briefly in a 22 November domestic service commentary and by 
a panelist in the 26 November domestic service roundtable 
discussion; both speculated that the United States is preparing 
to maintain its military presence in South Vietnam under the 
guise of civi:lan advisers after a cease-fire. 
A Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in English to Asia on the 
22d atypically broached the issue of political power in th 
South. It criticized "Washington propaganda" or trying, by 
claiming that there are no "third forces" in Vietnam, to 
denigrate the proposal of the "Vietnamese patriots" for a 
"tripartite coalition government." The reference to a 
coalition "government" rather than the term "adminf.trative 
structure" used by Hanoi in its 26 October summary of the peace 
accord may have been merely a translation error. On the other 
hand, the commentator may have been confused because of the 
11 September PRG proposal on such a "government." The 
commentary went on to argue that there exists a "powerful 
opposition" to the Thieu regime composed of the vast majority 
of the political parties and organizations in South Vietnam 
and Vietnamese expelled from the country, and it scored 
"reprisals" being taken by the Saigon regime against these 
"third forces." 
Moscow reported on 27 November the arrival of the DRV economic 
delegation led by Le Thanh Nghi to discuss the 1973 aid agree-
ment. The Soviet side is represented, as usual, by Vice Premier 
Novikov, who said in a radio interview that the talks were to

cover "technical assistance" in building and restoring industrial 
installations and coeds as well as trade relations. A 28 November 
report of talks said the two sides had discussed matters concern-
ing "trade and economic relations" and "assistance in the 
wtrengttming of the economic and defensive capacity of the DRV." 
VNA's 28 October report or the delegation's arrival in Moscow 
typically said it had come for "talks on Soviet economic and 
military aid to Vietnam fcr 1973." 
HANOI CONTINUES ROUTINE PROTESTS OF U.S. AIR STRIKES IN DRV 
U.S. air strikes against North Vietnam have continued to draw 
puter~q in daily statements by the DRV Foreign Ministry spokes-
man which repeat the standard charge that such "war acts" only 
reveal the Nixon Administration's desire to deceive world public 
op4nion into believing peace is at hand while it continues to 
pursue the Vietnamization policy and seek a position of strength. 
Following up on last week's ".%,ecial communique," which condemned 
U.S. air and naval action during the first 18 days of November, 
the DRV War Crimes Commission issued another communique on the 
24th covering U.S. "crimes" from the 20th throuah the 23d. 
Claiming that U.S. planes flew some 690 sorties during this four-
day period despite bad weather, the communique charged that they 
dropped 12,170 tons of "demraition and antipersoanel bombs" on 
84 populated areas in the four southern provinces and the Vinh 
Linh zone. The cities of Vinh and Dong Hoi were cited as 
sustaining heavy damage, along with a number of districts, towns, 
villages, and factories. The communique further charged that 
on 22 November U.S. Marine helicopters from a "landing ship" 
stationed in the South China Sea concentrated a "wanton" attack 
on Ky Phuong village in Ky Anh district, Ha Tinh Province. It 
claimed that the armed forces and people "punished the U.S. 
aggressors" by downing six planes during the four days, 
including two 8-52's and one F-111. 
Other comment on the air war included a QUAN DOI NHAN DAN 
editorial of the 25th which argued the nend for "passive air 
defense"--building adequate shelters and trenches, organizing 
evacuation and dispersal activities, coordinating alerts, am; 
"maintaining a wartime way of life." Stressing that this task 
is as important as actually fighting the enemy, the editorial 
urged proper coordination between and within party and military 
organs in carrying it out.

PLANE DOWNINGS, As of 28 November, Hanoi's claimed total of 
AIR DEFENSE downed U.S. planes stood at 4,062. 
Included in the latest figures were the 
claimed downing of an F-111 over Quang Binh on 21 November, two 
8-52's over Nghe An on the 22d, and the 300th plane over Haiphong 
(an unmanned reconnaissance plane) on the 26th. 
U.S. officials had announced that on 22 November a B-52 had been 
downed for the first time in the war. The announcement said it 
had been damaged over the DRV, probably by a SAM, and crashed 
in Thailand after the crew ejected safely. VNA, in a 
tabulation of alleged 8-52 downings since 17 September 1967, 
claimed that the 8-52 was one of two shot down on the 22d and 
that these downings brought the total to 27, of which 19 were 
said to have occurred since the resumption of the air war in 
April. VNA broke down the claimed total as follows: 15 8-52's 
downed over the Vinh Linh zone, five over Nghe An, three over 
Quang Binh, cwo over Thanh Hoa, and one each over Haiphong and 
Ha Tinh. 
Praise was accorded the Fourth Military Region for its achievements 
in downing the 8-52'd as well as an F-111 (U.S. sources on 
22 November acknowledged the loss of one of the swing-wing planes) 
in a commendation by the VPA High Command on 25 November. The 
order specifically praised "the cadres and combatants of the 
anti-aircraft and missile units, the local forces, the militia 
and self-defense forces" for the recent downings. It called on 
them to continue their vigilance against U.S. air and naval 
forces, as -7ell as to satisfactorily carry out the communications 
and transport tasks and provide reinforcements for the frontline. 
The downings were also hailed in commentaries in NHAN DAN and 
QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, which declared in general terms that the 
United States is doomed to defeat if it persists in prolonging 
the war. It was left to Hanoi radio on the :3d to comment more 
specifically on the significance of the downings; the commentary 
claimed that "the boasts abour the capability of the eight-million-
dollar B-52 Stratofortress to disturb the adversary's radar and so 
forth have finally been shattered by the strength of our people's 
war." Declaring that no modern aircraft or new tactics "can 
escape the punitive firenet of our army and people," the broadcast 
praised the responsibility, vigilance, and fighting will of the 
armed forces in the Fourth Military Region and Thsnh Hoa Province.

QUAN DOI MAN DAN on 23 November reported on a conference held 
by the Northwest Military Region--contiguous with the Tay Bac 
Autonomous Region, including the provinces of Lai Chau, Son La, 
and Nghia Lo--to improve combat operations and techniques 
among the military cadres and to unite the local people in 
fulfilling "the mission to down U.S. aircraft, capture aggressor 
pilots, exterminate and neatly capture spy and commando teams, 
adequately carry out the people's air defense, and insure 
smooth communications and transportation operations." The 
significance of this exhortation to step up air defense for 
localities outside the area currently subject to U.S. air and 
naval attack was pointed up in comment hailing the downing of the 
pilotless reconnaissance plane over Haiphong--allegedly the 300th 
over that city. Hanoi claims to have downed two other 
reconnaissance planes above the 20th parallel since 25 October, 
one over Hai Hung on 12 November and another over Vinh Phu on 
the 24th. The downing over Haiphong received editorial praise in 
both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN on 27 November. The latter 
paper called the downing "a glorious milestone marking the 
outstanding, all-round victories of the heroic port city." Both 
papers discussed the downing in the context of earlier, heavy 
U.S. air attacks on the city and of the continuing naval 
blockade, and both stressed Haiphong's ability to maintain 
production, communications, and transportation, as veil as to 
provide assistance "to the frontline." 
HOLIDAY MAIL In a VNA transmission of 28 November, Hanoi set 
FOR POW'S forth the procedures governing the sending of 
Christmas and New Year's cards and packages to 
U.S. prisoners of war during the 1972-73 holiday season. 
Virtually identical to last year's announcement, which came some 
two weeks earlier,* this year's states that the same procedures 
will apply: packages weighing up to five kilograms, two 
kilograms over the usual limit, are to be sent by post via 
Moscow "in accordance with the procedures already laid down," 
while cards and letters can be sent direct by mail or through 
the Committee of Liaison with Families of Servicemen in Vietnam, 
in New York. The announcement warns that packages sent by 
procedures other than those stipulated will not be accepted.

SALT 
POLISH, CZECHOSLOVAK PAPERS DISCUSS SALT I! AGENDA 
Recent commentaries on the resumption of tl e SALT negotiations 
in three East European bloc papers have pyovided the most 
extended discussion to date in Soviet or East Europenn media 
of the substantive issues at stake in SALT II. These 
commentators say the second round will focus on the problems of 
restricting qualitative developments such as MIRV, restricting 
research and development on offensive weapons systems in 
general, and taking into account U.S. forward based systems 
(FBS) in Plrope and on carriers. Negligible and very generalized 
Soviet comment on SALT II has avoided any mention of the MIRV 
and FBS problems. 
Antoni Olczak in a 22 November article in the Polish army paper 
ZOLNIERZ WOLNOSCI--the third article in that paper within 
three months to discuss SALT II issues in some detail--asserted 
that a permanent treaty to replace the provisional agreement 
signed in Moscow "would have to cover aspects of the strategic 
offensive armaments left out of the Moscow accord such as the 
bombers carrying nuclear weapons and the MIRV. It would also 
have to introduce restrictions on the research into and the 
development and testing of new types of weapons." Referring 
to the verification problems that a treaty dealing with quali-
tative developments will encounter, and to the liabilities 
entailed in relying solely on national means of verification, 
Olczak contended that "particular difficulties" will be 
presented by FBS and "by the effort to achieve agreement on the 
limitation of MIRV's, which cannot be controlled by space 
satellites." 
According to Karol Szyndzielorz in the 23 November Polish Govern-
ment paper ZYCIE WARSZAWY, "life itself" has also included on 
the SALT II agenda the problem of freezing defensive systems not 
covered by the SALT I agreements--"mainly the systems of combating 
submarines and the systems of air defense." The article added 
that "we will have to wait at least two years for another SALT 
success, as haste is not a commendable virtue in cases like this." 
An article by Milos Krejci in the 21 November Czechoslovak party 
organ RUDE PRAVO, foreseeing a similar agenda, commented that a 
"special artificial obstacle" to the second round had been

created by the Jackson amendment's call for numerical equality. 
In rebutting the logic of the Jackson amendnent, Krejci cited 
figures on the numerical advantage in launchers granted by the 
Interim Agreement to the Soviet Union, 1,618 to 1,052 in 
ICBM's and 62 to 48 in submarines--the first known appearance 
of any of these figures 4.n Soviet or East European bloc media. 
In the first direct discussion of details of the "asymmetry" 
problem, the Czechoslovak commentator argued that "it is not 
the number of missiles but the number of their warheads 
which determines nuclear strength," noting that to make up for 
the deficiency the United States has MIRV's and FBS as well 
as "certain technical advantages." Moscow media to date 
have not apecifinally acknowledged the existence of the 
protocol to the Interim Agreement on offensive weapons outlining 
the number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles and 
ballistic missile subm_rines allowed both sides.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA-FRG 
PRAGUE APPEARS TO SOFTEN STAND ON MUNICH PACT ISSUE 
Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Chnorpek, in public atatements 
expressing "satisfaction" with the results of the West German 
elections, has reinforced indications of a softening of Prague's 
stand on the 1938 Munich agreement--the principal issue holding 
up a Prague-Bonn accord on normalizing relations. Prague reports 
of a speech by Chnoupek on 23 November and remarks made by 
Chitoupek in a radio interview on the 24th failed to repeat the 
stock Czechoslovak demand that Bonn recognize the invalidity of 
the Munich pact from its inception, instead calling on Bonn to 
recognize the "initial .Avalidity" or simply the "invalidity" of 
the agreement. 
Chnoupek had used the "initial invalidity" formula once before, 
introducing it in an article on Czechoslovak foreign policy in 
the October issue of the monthly NOVA MYSL. And some but not all 
recent Czechoslovak reiterations of the original Czechoslovak 
demand for recognition of the invalidity of the accord "ab initio" 
had left off the final phrase. The latest successive statements 
by Chnoupek, however, take on added significance in that they 
came on the heels of a series of statements by Soviet and other 
East European leaders in the past three weeks which consistently 
failed to explicitly support Prague's original demand.* Foreseeing 
the possibility of a break in the stalemated negotiations with 
Bonn, Chnoupek said the Brandt-Scheel victory had "removed the 
obstacles which evidently impeded Brandt's government from 
proceeding in the normalization of FRG relations with the 
socialist states in the way it wished." 
"INITIAL INVALIDITY" Czechoslovak media were inconsistent in 
reporting the language Chnoupek used in 
his speech on ths 23d, at a party aktiv meeting in Bratislava. A 
Prague domestic broadcast that day reported him as saying that 
Czechoslovakia now assumes Brandt "will be able to settle relations 
with all member-states of the Warsaw Pact" and that "as far as 
Czechoslovakia is concerned . . ., there have not been, nor are 
there now, any barriers whatsoever to a normalization of relations 
between Czechoslovakia and the FRG on a basis of recognizing the

initial invalidity bocatecni neplatnost] of the so-calied 
Munich agreement on the part of the Federal Republic." Later 
on the 23d, citing the same passage, CTK in English quoted 
Chnoupek as merely calling for "recognition of the invalidity 
of the so-called Munich agreement," dropping "initial." 
However, the "initial invalidity" formulation recurred in a 
Bratislava PRAVDA account on the 24th of another "CTK report" 
on the speech, which was accompanied by a statement that this 
position "has already been repeatedly stated by the highest 
Czechoslovak representatives." RUDE PRAVO's brief summary on 
the 24th also retained "initial." 
In the interview on Prague radio on the 24th, Chnoupek used the 
"initial invalidity" formulation twice in a discussion of FRG-
CSR relations. In welcoming the reelection af the Brandt-Scheel 
coalition and calling on Bonn also to demonstraLe "willingness and 
good will" to reach a mutual agreement, Chnoupek's lengthy remarks 
seemed unusually insistent and repetitive, as if to emphasize to 
Prague's Soviet bloc allies that Czechoslovakia is ready to negotiate 
its differences with the FRG. 
In introducing the "initial invalidity" formula in NOVA MYSL, signed 
to the press on 10 October, Chnoupek had said the FRG would have 
to resolve "the question of recognition of the initial invalidity 
of the Munich agreement." Noting that "matters have now matured 
and clarified to such an extent that a mutually acceptable 
agreement may be reached without any further delays, he went 
on to say that Prague had shown "sufficient good will" to find 
a mutual agreement both in the exploratory talks and in statements 
by the "highest" C7echoslovak leaders. During the talks, Chnoupek 
wrote, Prague had announced its willingness to search for a 
"solution of consequences of the invalidity of the Munich agreement 
from the very beginning which would not infringe upon the legal 
security of phvsical persons, as well as other problems, and would 
even provide the necessary guarantees."* But he added that it was 
not enough that "willingness and good will are demonstrated by one 
side only."

BACKGROUND Recent statements by Czechoslovak leaders and 
commentaries in Prague media have been inconsistent 
in dealing with the Munich issue. Where Chnoupek in his foreign 
policy statement to the Federal Assembly on 31 October explicitly 
demanded recognition of the invalidity of the Munich pact ab initio 
in discussing relations with the FRG, a 16 November RUDE PRAVO 
account of remarks made by party leader Husak at the October 
Czechoslovak CP Oantral Committee plenum merely reported that 
Husak "briefly informed the session of our approach to the 
negotiations with the FRG and of our efforts to achieve progress 
in the solution of certain open questions." 
Prague has ignored reports in West German media suggesting 
behind-the-scenes movement since the conclusion of the exploratory 
talks at the end of June. Czechoslovak media have not mentioned 
a personal letter from Premier Strougal to Brandt, reported by

talks; FRG Government spokesman Ahlers announced on the 9C1 that 
Brandt had replied to the letter. On 27 October, DPA reported 
that a West German paper had quoted "diplomatic quarters" in 
Prague as saying a possible compromise had been reached. According 
to DPA, thc compromise was to consist of two steps: 1) a treaty 
would be concluded in which Bonn would declare the Munich 
agreement "unjust" from the outset and contrary to international 
law and ethics; and 2) after the treaty signing, Prague would 
state for the record that Czechoslovakia has never been a 
signatory to the Munich agreement, has never legally recognized 
it, and considers it invalid from the outset.

ALBANIA-USSR-CHINA 
MOSCOd URGES. TIRANA REJECTS RESUMPTION OF DIPLOMATIC TIES 
An article in the Soviet weekly NOVOYE VREMYA keyed to the 
28-29 November Albanian national holidays goes beyond such 
commentaries in prior years in calling outright for the 
reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Tirana. Albanian 
media have taken indirect cognizance of the Soviet article, 
which appeared in the 17 November issue of the weekly, in an 
article in the party organ URI I POPULLIT on the 27th spurning 
the "trial balloon" launched by "old and new imperialists" who 
are seeking "ways to enter into relations with" Albania. The 
keynote anniversary speaker on the 27th underscored the Albanian 
reaction, recalling a statement by Enver Hoxha last November 
ruling out normalization of relations with the Soviet Union under 
its present leadership. 
SOVIET OVERTURE Moscow commentaries on relations with Tirana, 
ruptured in 1961, have hewed until now to the 
formula established at the October 1964 CPSU Central Committee 
plenum a: i reiterated by Brezhnev at the 24th CPSU Congress last 
year, simply asserting Soviet readiness to "normalize" relations. 
The current article in the 17 November NOVOYE VREMYA (No. 47), 
entitled "Yn Common Interests" and Agned by Tangalov, concludes 
that "the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries . . . could be an importlnt step on the path of the general 
normalization of relations between the Soviet Union and the Albanian 
People's Republic." 
The article strengthens the thrust of the Soviet overture by repeatedly 
mentioning diplomatic relations in the course of a review of bilateral 
relations highlighting historical Soviet friendship and support. It 
recalls a Soviet note delivered to the Albanian provisional government 
on 10 November 1945 announcing that "the Soviet Government has 
decided to establish diplomatic relations with Albania and exchange 
envoys," and it refers again in a later passage to the Soviet 
"decision on diplomatic recognition of Albania." It goes on to 
regret "the abnormal situation in Soviet-Albanian relationa since 
1960" that led to the "break in diplomatic relations" between the 
two countries.

On the day the NOVOYE VREMYA article appeared, the hungarian domestic 
tadio called attention to the fact that "the most reputed Soviet poli-
tical weekly" urges an improvement of Soviet-Albanian relations "and 
also takes up the idea of resuming diplomatic relations." The broad-
cast commented that the present "unnatural state of affairs" meets 
neither Soviet nor Albaniar interests and damages the cause of 
socialism. It also mentioned that the Soviet side has taken "initia-
tives to improve relations." 
Radio Moscow itself has not been heard to broadcast the NOVOYY. VREMYA 
article in Albanian, instead marking the November anniversaries with 
routine radio talks reminding Albanian listeners of past Soviet frieci-
ship. Such comment, aired intermittently by Moscow in Lroadcasts to 
Albania since the diplomatic break, has served the propaganda purpose 
of projeeting Soviet good will and underscoring the notion that 
Albania alone is responsiblgb fos a breach that has only hurt its own 
interests. 
MOICOW did, however, report in Albanian on 29 November that the Soviet-
Albanian Friendship Society had sant a message to the Albanian-Soviet 
Friendship Society--an inoperative body--on the occasion of the Novem-
ber anniversaries, asserting the Soviet people's "desire for friend-
ship and cooperation" with the Albanians. A message from the same 
body last year had merely expressed congratulations on the anniver-
saries, and Moscow waited until the Albanians declined to accept 
that message before announcing that it had been sent: Radio Moscow 
told Albanian listeners on 30 November 1971 that the Albanians had 
refused to accept the message in order to prevent the Albanian people 
from learning about it, than broadcast the brief, innocuous text. 
Last year's message had been the first publicized one from the Soviet-
Albanian Friendship Society since the 1961 break. Messages signed 
impersonally by the leading Soviet Government bodies were sent to 
their Albanian counterparts on the November anniversaries in 1964, 
1965, and 1969, but no Soviet messages of any kind were publicized 
in other years. Government-level Soviet messages have marked the 
January anniversrry of the founding of the Albanian People's 
Republic on the major quinquennials--the 20th anniversary in 1966 
and the 25th in 1971. 
ALBANIAN REBUFF Albanian media 1137e sustained their anti-Soviet 
stance over the years with varying degrees of 
truculence. Moscow's exceptionally forthcoming overture this year 
has mot with a notably pointed rebuff. An article in the 17 
November ZERI I POPULLIT seemed to take note of the FOVOYE VREMYA 
articie in scorning the "trial balloon" in which the "Old

and new imperialists invite us to enter their 'paradise,' ao if 
we had not suffered in the past the perfidies and evils they 
have caused us." They also, 1. added, "make flatteries and 
speculations an if Albania is trying openings in their direction, 
and they want to find ways to enter into relations with it." 
In rebuttal to the alleged thesis of "the Moscow social 
imperialists and their lackies" about Albania's "isolation," 
the article noted that while Tirana had r.,;_plomatic relations 
with 26 countries in 1960, "today it maintains diplomatic 
relations with 55 countries" as well as tcade and economic 
relations with "more than 40" states. 
A more cryptic response to the Soviet overture was made by 
Politburo member Kapo in an anniversary address on the 27th 
in Vlore, attended by Hoxha, Lleshi, Shehu, and other top 
leaders. Following a denunciatior e "the so-called Europcan 
security" as a device to perpetuate the hegemony of "the two 
imperialist superpowers," Kapo remarked that "for some timc the 
Soviet social imperialists have changed their tactics toww:d 
our country," and "they speak about the normalization of new 
relations." Avoiding any s,acific reference to diplomatic 
relations, Kapo recalled the stock rejection registered by Hoxha 
at the Albanian party congress in November last year: "Genuine 
normalization" can take place only when the present Soviet leaders 
are replaced by "true Bolsheviks." 
PEKING PRESSES LINE ON SOVIETS AS MOST DANGEROUS ENEMY 
Peking used the occasion of the dual Albanian anniversaries to 
reaffirm solidarity with its Albanian ally while pressing its 
line on the Soviets as the most dangerous adversary today. As 
usual, the top Chinese leaders sent a greetings message--this 
time signed by Mao, Tung Pi-wu, Chu Te, and Chou En-lai--and 
PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an editorial marking the occasion. There 
were also receptions in Peking, and a rally in Nanking marking 
the occasion was attended by the touring Albanian military 
delegation headed by Defense Minister Balluku. 
Notwithstanding the expressions of solidarity, the divergence 
between the long-time allies caused by Peking's current global 
strategy came through clearly in Chinese insistence on treating 
Moscow as the primary enemy, with the implicit corollary that 
improved relations with the United States are justified by 
changing circumstances. Thus, the Chinese message lauded opposition

to "modern revisionisw with Soviet rev.I.sionism as its center and 
imperialism headed by he United States"--a reversal of the 
order of adversaries that was introduced in Peking's 1 October 
joint editorial on PRC National Day. That joint editorial had 
also introduced the line that Soviet "social imperialism" is 
more deceitful and therefore more dangerous than old-line 
imperialism, and this line was pressed in the 28 November 
editorial on the Albanian anniversaries. 
Albanian opposition to Peking's strategy in the triangular 
big-power context, already reflected in Tirana's reaction to 
the Chinese invitation to Prssident Nixon, had been aired in 
remarkably clear terms on the first day of Balluku's latest 
visit to China.* Responding to a Chinese leader's speech at a 
welcoming banquet on 6 November, Balluku took direct issue with 
Peking's line by insisting in his denurciation of the United 
States and the Soviet Union that each "io e.a dangerous as the 
other." Balluku also stuck to the traditional formulation by 
naming the United States first. Similarly, in remarks at a 
Peking reception marking the Albanian anniversaries the Chinebe 
speaker mentioned the USSR before the United States and the 
Albanian reversed the order.

S INO-SOVIET RELATIONS 
UN DISARMAMENT DEBATES PROVIDE FORUM FOR BITTER EXCHANGES 
Offering a forum for appeals to the international community and 
a subject that has long been at the heart of the Sino-Soviet 
conflict, the disarmament discussions at this year's UNGA sess!_on 
have set the scene for acrimonious exchanges between the two 
rivals that have again underscored how intractable their conflict 
is. In what could be viewed as preemptive moves to neutralize 
the anticipated Chinese attacks, the Soviets used the session to 
press their all for a world disarmament conference (WDC) and to 
revive proposals on the nonuse of force (NUF) and permament 
prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons. Reacting to these 
initiatives as an effort by Moscow to promote its detente policies 
at thc Pxpense of Chinesc interests, Peking has vigorously pounced 
on the Soviet proposals to give focus to its current line that 
Moscow's "social imperialism" is more deceitful and therefore more 
dangerous than old-line imperialism. During this ongoing exchange 
the United States has largely escaped the polemical crossfire. 
NONUSE OF FORCE Having earlier centered on the WDC proposal,* 
the Sino-Soviet jockeying ehif ted to the NUF 
package when debate opened on these proposals in plenary sessions 
on 2 November. Yakov Malik, head of the Soviet permanent UN mission, 
elaborated on NUF in a speech that day along lines laid out by 
Foreign Minister Gromyko in his 26 September address to the UNGA. 
Malik's speech, reported only in summary form by TASS on 2 November 
and PRAVDA on the 4th, was marked by a low-key approach devoid of 
polemics, with only veiled references to Chinese positions. A 
week later the Chinese reacted with a series of strong attacks 
highlighted by a PEOPLE'S DAILY Commeatator article on 12 November 
and a sharply polemical address at the UN by Vice Foreign Minister 
Chiao Kuan-hua on the 13th which was disseminated in full by NCNA. 
The Chinese response, punctuated with bitter ridicule of the Soviets 
as hypocrites and of their NUF proposal Evi "a downright fraud" that 
was cold-shouldered during the meetings, zeroed in on the So,,4et 
Union as an expansionist power whose real nature has been revealed 
in the invasion of Czechoslovakia, the dismemberment of Pakistan, 
and military pressure along the Sino-Soviet border. Making use of 
an aphorism long favored by the Chinese in the past when denigrating

the prospects of detente with the United States, Chiao derided 
the Soviets for trying to make people believe that they have 
"laid down their butcher's knives and become Buddhas." 
Malik responded to the Chinese attacks in a concluding speech on 
15 November which, unlike the one on 2 November, contained extensive 
polemics against the Chinese. A TASS summary quoted Malik as 
interpreting Peking's challenge to the Soviet proposal to mean 
that Peking "favors the use of force in international relations 
while its objections to the prohibition of nuclear weapons for 
all time means that it actually comes out for the use of these 
weapons." 
BORDER ISSUE While Peking's use of the UNGA forum to deride 
Moscow's detente posture was clearly designed 
with an eye for the international gallery, much of the argumentation 
and, in particular, the repeated references to the Sino-Soviet 
border reflect Peking's concern and resentment over Soviet military 
pressure along the border. A fundamental argument advanced by 
Peking is that the Soviet disarmame%t proposals are contrived to 
maintain the two superpowers' dominance in nuclear capability 
while arresting the nuclear weapons development of countries 
like China before the strategic imbalance can be meaningfully 
redressed. The 12 November Commentator article, observing that 
the Soviets have increased their strategic nuclear weapons more 
than sixfold in the past six years, argued that the small and 
medium-size countries' defense capabilities are inadequate and 
that their present task "is not disarmament but to strengthen 
their national defense." At the same time, Peking has reiterated 
its intent to pursue its nuclear weapons program for self-defense 
and has repeatedly challenged Moscow to agree to an undertaking 
not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. 
Peking's sharp reaction to the Soviet NUF position is particularly 
relevant to the border situation in the light of Moscow's proposals 
regarding a bilateral renunciation of force. In addition to 
dismissing the Soviet NUF package as a sham designed to cover up 
Moscow's expansionist policies, Peking has linked the Sino-Soviet 
border question with its general demand that tne Soviets withdraw 
their troops from foreign countries. Thus Ch4.ao in his speech 
on 13 November challenged the Soviets to withdraw their troops 
and dismantle their bases in Mongolia "instead of unabashedly 
uttering empty words about the renunciation of tha use of all 
force." Earlier, an NCNA correspondent's report from the UN on 
9 November sarcastically cited "the massive troop concentration

29 NOVEMBER 1972 
along the Sine-Soviet border" as an illust'ation of Moscowle 
good-neighbor policy. Moscow has repeateuiy claimed that it 
has made concrete proposals to the Chinese--including one on 
nonuse of force--in the interest of restoring good-neighborly 
relations, but Peking has made clear its resentment over the 
Soviet troop concentrations near the border. 
Another NCNA correspondent's dispatch, on 19 November, amplified 
the Chinese charges in posing a series of questions which Malik 
allegedly avoided in his 15 November speech. Among others, one 
question asked rhetorically if the Soviet Union had not stationed 
Han armed force of a million strong along the Sino-Soviet and the 
Sino-Mongolian borders" and staged a "military occupation" of 
the MPR. Contrasting Soviet behavior with that of the Chinese. 
NCNA pointed out that China hug no troops or military bases abroad 
and "has not :hreatened other countries with force." The dispatch 
also reiterated Peking's position that it develops nuclear weapons 
solely for defense and has often declared that it will not be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. 
Moscow has avoided publicizing the border issue as a dimension of 
the disarmament exchanges. PEOPLE'S DAILY on 21 November, in an 
extensive account of Malik's 15 November speech, claimed that in 
attempting to becloud the fact that the Soviets had provoked 
incidents along the border Malik had declared Moscow's readiness 
to renounce the use rf force in settling disputes with Peking. 
Malik was quoted in the account as referring to the "concrete and 
constructive proposals" the Soviets have made to the Chinese. 
L.A. NUCLEAR-FREE ZONE Apart from the bilateral issues imbedded 
in the disarmament debates involving 
Moscow and Peking, the two sides have also pitched their appeals 
to the international community, especially to the third world. 
Thus, Peking seized on the First Committee's discussion of the 
Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America 
as another case study of Moscow's sham disarmament posture. 
Mexico and other Latin American countries have been urging nuclear 
countries to sign Additional Protocol II to the treaty, thereby 
undertaking not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against 
parties to the treaty and to insure Latin America's nuclear-free 
status. In a note to the Mexican ambassador to the PRC released 
on 15 Noveruer, Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei announced Peking's 
support for the nuclear-free zone while declining to sign the 
protonol on the grounds that it affirms the nuclear nonproliferation 
and test-ban treaties, to which "China has always been opposed."

USSR-JAPAN 
MOSCOW-TOKYO TIES HINDERED BY uNORTI.ERN TERRITORIES" ISSUE 
In the wake of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations in 
September, Soviet spokesmen have put the Tanaka government on 
notice that the USSR does not, at this time, feel pressured to 
show any flexibility on meeting Japanese demands for.the 
return of the northern territories--the four islands seised 
by the USSR at the end of World War II--as a means of offsetting 
Japan's emerging relationship with China. While Moscow has 
opted for a wait-and-see policy on the territorial question, at 
least until the exact dimensions of the Sino-Japanese 
rapprochement are known, Peking has sought to keep the question 
alive by publicizing the issue in an apparent attempt to block 
any substantive progress in the normalization of Soviet-Japanese 
relations. 
The first major Soviet assessment of the new Sino-Japanese 
relationship--a 2 November IZVESTIYA article by V. Kudryavtsev--
applauded assurances in the September Sino-Japanese joint state-
ment that the normalization of relations between the two countries 
was not directed against third countries but professed "perplexity" 
over the targeta of the passage in the statement which jointly 
opposed any countries' hegemony in Asia. After excluding the 
PRC, Japan, and the United States as possible targets, 
Kudryavtsev implied that the formula was directed at the USSR. 
Taking a swipe at the Japanese, he then specifically pointed 
to "some of the recent speeches in the Japanese parliament, whose 
authors are again advancing pointless and absurd territorial 
demands with regard to the USSR" as evidence of Tokyo's 
"unrealistic positions" on a "number of very important foreign 
policy questions." 
The new Tanaka government, which enjoyed a virtual reprieve from 
hostile Soviet propaganda during its first few months in power, 
was taken to task on the territorial issue in a lengthy article 
by I. Latyshev in MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, signed to press on 
24 October. In reviewing former prime minister Sato's seven 
and a half years in office, Latyshev argued that the "revanchist 
anti-Soviet campaign for the return to Japan of the so-called 
northern territories" was one of the main reasons for Sato's 
resignation and warned the new leadership in Tokyo that this 
"absurd campaign" did not "yield any political dividents for the

Sato government." While stressing the need for a "new approach" 
to Japan's problems, Latyshev was quick to claim that "as yet 
the Tanaka government's foreign policy is not distinctive for its 
innovative nature." He concludec with the assertion that 
"evidently it is still not clear to some people in Japan that the 
successful development of Japanese-Soviet relations demands a 
sober, realistic approach to reality." 
Similar criticism wan expressed by Vsevolov Ovchinnikov in a 
24 November PRAVDA article which dealt in unusually candid 
terms with the current campaign in Japan for the return of the 
northern islands. Characterizing the campaign as "being waged 
In higher tones than ever before," Ovchinnikov lashed out at 
recent Japanese press articles which urged Tanaka to prsue a 
course of "assertive diplomacy" in dealing with the territorial 
issue in the negotiations with the USSR. Ovchinnikov complained 
that some Japanese writers had "gone even further" and had 
stated "unequivocally that the further development of economic 
cooperation between the two countries will depend on the relaxaticn 
of the USSR's position on the so-called territorial question." 
Aiming his remarks at a higher level, Ovchinnikov implicated the 
Tanaka government in the attempt to link the demand for return 
of the islands to the recently resumed talks on a peace treaty 
between the two countries. As evidence that the campaign is 
"actually being inspired and directed from above," Ovchinnikov 
odlteda 7November rally in Hiroshima held by emigres from the 
Kurile islands. He quoted the Japanese press and--revealing Soviet 
sensitivity to Chinese efforts to exploit the territorial issue--
"the Chinese NCNA"* as having reported that the rally was held 
with the assistance of the prime minister's office and that 
Foreign Minister Ohira had sent a message to the rally stressing 
that "the solution of the question of the northern territories is 
a prerequisite for the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet treaty." 
In unusually blunt terms, Ovchinnikov asserted that "it is still 
not clear to somebody in Tokyo" that 
the further comprehensive development of relations 
between our neighboring countries--in which the 
* Peking's attempt to keep the northern territories issue alive 
and thereby enhance its leverage against the Soviet Union vis-a-vis 
Japan was illustrated in NCNA's full report of the 7 November 
Hiroshima rally. NCNA's coverage, more complete than previous 
reports on similar Japanese rallies in the past, highlighted several 
anti-Soviet remarks contained in the rally speeches as well as Ohira's 
message to the rally.

revanchist positions. 
Turning to those Japanese leaders seeking to use the normalization

USSR on the territorial question, Ovchinuikov flatly declared 
that "calculations that . . . foreign policy actions of recent 
times will make it easier for Japan to exert pressure on the

Secretary M. A. Suslov has received several unusual honors on his 
70th birthday: 
4. PRAVDA on 21 October announced the publication of a collection 
of Suslov's speeches and articles and on 19 November carried a long, 
enthusiastic review of it, Brezhnev is the only other Politburo 
member to share this distintion. 
4. Where birthday awards are not normally presented immediately 
after they are announced and the presentation ceremonies 
customarily get little publicity, Suslov's were presented the 
day after they were announced and the ceremonies were prominently 
publicized. PRAVDA on 22 November published a picture of the 
awards ceremony along with the texts of Podgornyy's presentation 
speech and Suslov's acceptance speech. The only uther septua-
genarian in the Politbuco, A. Ya. Pelshe, received his 70th 
birthday Order of Lenin 20 days after its announcement, and the 
presentation ceremony merited only a one-paragraph report in 
PRAVDA on 27 February 1969. Although Brezhnev received his 60th 
birthday award the day after its announcement, PRAVDA on 20 
December 1966 carried no picture of the ceremony. 
All the Moscow-based Politburo members except Polyanskiy attEnded the 
Suelov awards ceremony, and Podgornyy's Ppeach contained warm 
praise of Suslov. In reply, Suelov singled cut Brezhnev for special

the remarkable cohesive and creative collective, among you, my 
friends, along with the General Secretary, our dear Leonid Ilich

republic witnessed the removal of its premier, B. A. Muradyan, its 
Central Committee secretary for agriculture, M. S. Mslkonyan, and 
its KGB chief, G. A. Badamyants. Although no public charges have 
been aired against these officials and no unusual economic short-
comings or corruption have thus far been revealed, the sudden 
purge clearly indicates major failings which place Armenian 
First Secretary A. Ye. Kochinyan's future in jeopardy. 
The Armenian changes commenced on 22 November with the removal 
of 62-year-old G. A. Badamyants as KGB chief, a post he had held 
for more than 18 years. The replacement of Badamyants, an Armenian, 
by Arkady Pavlovich Ragozev, apparently a Russian, bodes ill for the 
republic; native Armenians have long held all the top posts in 
their republic, without the presence of Russian overseers usually 
found in other republics. On the same day. 57-year-old Premier 
Muradyan was replaced by the 53-year-old Central Committee 
secretary for industry, G. A. Arzumanyan. 
On 23 November an Armenian Central Committee plenum attended 
by CPSU Central Committee deputy cadre section chief B. N. 
Moralev met to discuss orjanizational questions, according 
to a brief 24 November Yerevan broadcast. The plenum removed Me-
konyan and Muradyan from their republic party posts. Central Com-
mittee agriculture section head V. B. Galumyan aucceeded Melkonyan 
and Yerevan Second Secretary K. S. Demirchyan became industry secre-
tary, filling the vacancy left by Arzumanyan. 
To date, there has been no public explanation of the shakeup. In 
fact, at a 31 October plenum on agriculture Kochinyan had presented 
a rather favorable picture of Armenian agriculture which, though 
hard hit by the harsh winter, was alleged to have yielded good 
results.

CHINA 
SZECHWAN PLENUM PROVIDES FURTHER SIGN OF RETURNING ORDER 
Breaking a long period in which practically no provincial leaders 
appeared and no publicized meetings ware held, the Szechwan radio 
un 22 November announced that the provincial revolutionary 
committee held its sixth plenum from 1 to 2]. November. No 
successor was formally named to replace former provincial chief 
Chang Kuo-hua, who died in February, but former Kwangtung chief 
Liu Hsing-yuan made a report on behalf of the provincial revolu-
tionary committee. Liu made his last appearance in Kwangtung in 
early March. The only other provincial leader at the plenum who 
was named was party secretary and pre-cultural revolution governor 
Li Ta-chang, who gave a speech. Party second secretary and 
regional military commander Liang Hsing-chu continued his year-
long absence from public view. 
The Szechwan plenum, combined with the reappearance of Yunnan's 
leaders earlier in the month, indicates that the problems in 
Southwest China created by Lin Piao's fall are in the process of 
being solved, though Kweichow and Tibet leaders have still not 
reappeared. That serious obstacles to order remain, however, is 
indicated in the Szechwan plenum report's call for suppression of 
class enemies still "sowing discord, spreading rumors to stir up 
trouble, sabotaging the campaign to criticize revisionism, 
embezzling state property, and sabotaging production, communica-
tions, and social order." 
Leading cadres have also been reappearing in several other 
provinces. Among them is Mao Yuan-hsin, reported by the Liaoning 
provincial radio on 26 November to have participated in a local 
forum for intellectuals. Mao, reportedly Mao Tse-tung's nephew, 
is a deputy secretary of the Liaoning party committee and was an 
active "leftist" during the cultural revolution. He had not 
appeared in public since the spring of 1971.

TOPICS IN BRIEF 
SOVIET SUBMARINE SAGA 
Soviet media have ridiculed "hysteria" raised in the Western press 
over repotts that a Soviet nuclear submarine entered Norway's 
Sognefjord in early Novewber and plied the waters of the fjord 
until the 24th, when the Norwegian Government allowed it to leave 
in order to avoid an incident that might jeopardize the preparatory 
talks on a European security conference. TASS suggested that the 
story had been conjured up by Western opponcnts of detente and of 
the conference. None of Moscow's several reports has explicitly 
denied that the submarine was Soviet (it was so identified only 
belatedly in the Western press reports), but TASS on the 28th 
cited reports saying it was British. A 1.angthy commentary over 
East Berlin radio on rhe 27th derisively labeled the "unidentified" 
vessel "the Loch Nes. submarine." 
TASS ignored but the East Berlin broadcast derided a report that 
the "Soviet" submarine had entered the fjord after putting down 
an attempted mutiny--an allegation attributed in the British 
press to a ham operator who said he heard it in a Tirana broadcast 
in English. No mention of the incident has appeared in monitored 
Albanian news agency transmissions or domestic or international 
broadcasts of Radio Tirana. FBIS does not regularly monitor 
Tirana's voicecasts in English; they are known to carry much 
the same fare as its other internationAl broadcasts, all of 
which in turn draw most of their mater_al from the primary ATA 
services in English and French. 
PALESTINIAN UNITY 
Moscow has used the occasion of the opening of the "Arab popular 
conference for support of the Paleptine revolution" to again stress 
the "special importance" of unity in the Palestine resistance 
movement. Soviet interest in the meeting, which opened in Beirut 
on 27 November after several postponements, was indicated by the 
dispatch of a delegation headed by Yevgeniy Primakov, deputy 
director of the Institute of World Economics and International 
Relations and former PRAVDA Middle East expert. Primakov 
addressed the conference in the capacity of secretaly of the 
Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Commitee. According to a Moscow

broadcast in Arabic on the 28th, he deplored differences in 
the Palestine resistance movement and "disagreement among some 
Arab states" over support for the Palestinians' cause. He 
expressed the "Soviet people's" hope for deeper understanding 
that would lead to closer solidarity with Palestine resistance 
"militants," and he recalled the "very useful" visit to Moscow 
last July of a Palestinian delegation led by Yasir 'Arafat. 
Moscow's most recent criticism of disarray in the Palestinian 
resistance movement came in a 25 October SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA 
article by Baryshev which ticked off the movement's undefined 
political and ideological aims, lack of unity in methods of 
struggle, and "motley" social compcsition. The article also 
criticized extremist elements in the movement and groups advancing 
"naticnalist and religious slogans."
