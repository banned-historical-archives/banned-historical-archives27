 SECTION II.  DEVELOP= 1TS IN SPECIFIED AREAS
 Cononc~a_ nth Coz~?eren,.~n    An informal conferences, called by
 India's Prime Minister Nehru, met in New Delhi 28 Feb. to discuss the
 deteriorating situation in Burma. Attending are representatives from
 India, Pakistan,, Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand, as well as George
 J3ottomley, &e?itish Secretary for Overseas Trade and Malcolm McDonald.,
 British Comr issioner-Gemoral for Southeast Asia.  The meeting will be
 pr:rnriiy concerned with ways of helping Burg, out of its severe pelitiral
 ant economic troubles, a matter of concern to other Asian nations becay;. 3
 of ?aeir need for Burma's surplus rice crop.
 The Burmese Government, approaching virtual ban1cr ptcya, recently re-
 quested financial assistance from the UK.  After consultation w th other
 Commonwealth nations in the area, the UK persuaded Nehru to call the corm
 ference as of mutual interest to all.  Considering the political and
 economic instability of Burma, it is unlikely that anything but short-
 term financial assistance will be extended., primarily to facilitate the
 rice export program.  Since a loan without assurances of communal peace
 would be almost useless. Comronnealth efforts to solve the Karen Burman
 conflict probably will be forthcoming as well.  Nehru has indicated his
 personal willingness to mediate the conflict.  Any attempt at mediation.,,
 however, will have to over gorse the conviction on the part of both Buranans
 and Karens that each will be victorious.
 JAPAN
 as;z Di.~. SMIR-1          0  A program of mass dismissals of employees pro-
 posed under the Japanese Government's economic stabilization.program
 should increase labor unrest and permit the Japan Communist Party to
 strengthen its influence.
 The program proposes that:  non-operating Government staffs be out by
 one-third and operating personnel of government monopolies be out by one-
 fifth.  Teachers, policemen, court and prison attendants are to be exemp-
 ted. Recognizing a corning unemployment problem aggravated by these
 dismissals, the Japanese Government has appropriated 90 billion yen for
 public works to absorb these unemployed and is attempting to increase
 unemployment benefits.  The Government estimates unemployment at 1,800,000
 in the coming fiscal year.
 Under Com  nidst guidance,, Japanese labor probably will oppose the mass
 dismissals strongly.  A mass meeting of workers of the Toiyo Shibaura
 Electric Company., a center of labor conflicts may spread into a "March

 particularly galling to the Japanese who considered themselves one of
 the world's leading nations.
 Top Japanese Government officials and editors are hailing the Judd

 will not result in appreciably increasing the number of future Japanese
 emigrants to the US, its recognition of equality between Asiatics and
 non-Asiatics would eliminate a minor Japanese Communist propaganda
 weapon and create considerable good will for the US with the Japanese

 Rhee has ousted Cho Pong An as ffiniater of Agriculture in an attempt to
 mitko Cho the scapegoat for the Government's failure to collect more than
 50% of the rice quota,  Replacement of Cho by Lae Chong Hyun, however,
 will not resolve the problem of the failing rice collection.
 Cholc inefficient administration as well as his possibly deliberate
 efforts to sabotage rice collections are partially responsible for the
 Government's failure to mot the quota,  The basic responsibility, ho.-
 ever, rests in the rreaknes  of the National Assembly's rice collection
 ",7.  Even an efficient administrator could probably not have col1ec'4-?,d
 appreciably more rice under the existing regulations.
 Cho is a former Communist, originally appointed because Rhea wished
 to give his administration an appearance of wide representation.  Cho
 filled his Ministry with leftist follovers.  It is probable that Rhee
 used the excuse of rice quota failure to rid his Cabinet of a man who
 was neither a personal friend or supporter and whose political follo7sing
 is inadequate to exert significant pressure on the Government.
 Acting President LI4s position improves,  Li Tsung-jen appears to
 have won the first round in his contest with CH.IANG Kai-shek for control
 of the National Government,  His position has been considerably strength-
 ened by Chinese Communist leaders MAO Tse-tung and CHOU Ln-lai?s grant-
 ing of an interview to the peace mission headed by W.W. YEN,  According
 to members of the mission, the Communist leaders have agreed in principle
 to the reopening of certain lines of communication between Communist and
 Nationalist China,  Meanwhile, a Communist broadcast indicated that peace
 negotiations will begin shortly.  LI's exhaustive efforts to seek peace
 with the Communists have won him a growing popular support?
 Within Nationalist ranks, LI showed political astuteness on his
 recent trip to Canton when he successfully maneuvered SUN Fo into returning
 to Nanking for the opei,iing of the Legislative Yuan?  SUN who has continually
 refused to bring the Cabinet back to Nanking,, reportedly returned on
 Generalissimo CHIANG's orders indicating CHIANG's recognition of LI's
 increased influence,  The return to Nanking may additionally indicate an
 attempt to check any efforts by the Legislative Yuan to oust SUN Fo
 as Premier?
 LI has also been successful to some extent in winning certain key
 figures to his cause,, notably former Defence Minister HO Ying-chin.
 However, LI has yet to gain the allegiance of the potentially powerful
 Kwangtung group, including CHAN G Fa?kwei, UULH Yueh and WU Te-chen anal

 may find his authority challenged in Canton by a competing group of
 Legislative Yuan members under the Yuan's Vice President LIU Chienmchun,
 if a quorum can be mustered,,  LI's most serious weakness, however, continues
 to be his lack of financial resources,,  LI?s Peiping peace mission report-
 edly has emphasized to the Communists the precarious currency position of
 the Nationalists as one strong argument for an early peace,  CkIIANG and
 his cohorts still control  the bulk of the nation?s monetary reserves
 and banking facilities, and for this reason LI may prefer to continue to
 seek a compromise with CHIANG's forces rather than break with them completely,,
 Communists emphasize industrial production.  North Shensi radio 1-st    "A"
 wo .k reported popular acclaim for the Chinese Communist Party's econcx,,o
 achievements,,  With the expansion of their territory to include more and
 more cities, the Communists have beco.ne increasingly aware of the economic
 importance of industrial and commercial groups?   During the past year,
 Communist pronouncements have emphasized industrial production in addition
 to the traditional agricultural program.  On 21 February, the Communist
 radio announced that "The Northeast State-owned Enterprises Provisional
 Wartime Labor Insurance Act" was passed in January by the Manchurian
 Democratic Government, and will'go into effect on i April.,  Under this
 Act,, state-owned enterprises are to provide their workers with medical and
 funeral benefits as well as old age and disability pensions,  "Other
 liberated areas are closely studying this first labor insurance act for
 experience in applying it to their own areas," the broadcast continued?
 Pragmatic Communist policy-makers have compromised with theory and
 modified their policies in order to gain the support of key economic groups.
 In a speech on 25 December 1947, MAO Tse-tung said.-  "Owing to the back-
 wardness of China's economy, it will still be necessary to permit the
 existence of the capitalist economy for a long time."  According to a 3
 August 1948 New China News  Agency editorial, "...all law-abiding industrial-
 ists and commercial businessmenv,..should be protected from infringement....
 Industrial production should be regarded as of equal importance to or
 more important than agricultural production,"  Now that the Communists
 are faced with the problem of maintaining production in such major in-
 dustrial centers as Mukden and Tientsin, they will probably modify their
 policies even farther,, perhaps to the extent of soliciting the cooperation
 of foreigners.  The Communist Tax Bureau in Mu.Sden, eager for the reopen-
 ing of the BAT cigarette factory -a source of tax revenue -- has reportedly
 invited BAT officials to return to MMukden and has offered financial
 assistance if needed.
 Nationalists announce another new financial program.  The financial
 program for Nationalist China announced 24 February, will attempt to
 maintain Nationalist purchasing power for at least a few more months.
 The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, in recognition of the loss
 of tax receipts from provinces, feel that in the absence of substantial

 Other features of the pro7ram are chiefly relaxation of import-export con-
 trols and approval of free circulation of gold and silver.  The United
 States is being strongly pressed for a silver loan, which in a few months'
 time probrably would be the only asset available to the Nationalists.
 Largest Nationalist eombiit ship defects.  During the early morning
 hours of 25 February, the light cruiser Chun king--largest combat vessel

 ,chorage with destination unknown..  The Chungking departed with a full
 road of fuel, presumably a full load of ammunition and complete crew com-

 Force reported that the Chungking had been located in the Communist port
 of Chefoe  on the Shantung penninsula.  The defection of the Chungking
 marks the third such action in. a period of less than three weeks:  On
 13 February the destroyer-escort Huang An left her berth at Tsingtao in

 eludes sufficient means to insure its success or until the Bao Da.i regime
 itself achieves the surrpo:rt of an appreciable portion of the population.
 Decisive action on the unification of Cochinchina with Tonkin and Annam is
 considered essential before Pao Dai can rally to his cause the natio.ialists
 who are presently following Ito Chi r?inh.  It was emphasized that any re-
 consideration of T TS policy toward MA aid for Indochina must await develop-
 ments?
 Unsuccessful coup d4ntat may bring Government changes.     Although the "A"
 armed clash. in Bangkok last weekend---the hlooa1est since 1.933--was officially
 termed the result of an AriW-Navy "misunderstanding", there is little doubt
 that ex premier Prridi. attempted a coup d' etat with Navy assistance.  Marine
 units, in cooperation with Pridi's Free Thai followers, seized the govern
 n
 ment radio station and the Royal Palace on Saturday night and then deployed
 through other sections of Bangkok.  Shortly thereafter the radio broadcast
 a proclamation, in the King's name, dismissing the Phibul rovcrnment and
 appointing pro-Pridi men to the Cabinet,  The proclamation also ordered
 re-establishment of the original 1933 constitution which had stripped the
 monarchy of its absolute powers.
 Desnite deployment of Marine forces, loyal government units retained
 control of the center of Bangkok.  By Sunday afternoon, Phibul's forces had
 regained control of the situation, recaptured the radio station and announced
 that an agreement had been concluded to establish a Joint Armes Navy committee
 "to investigate the incident."
 The coup d' etat misfired because certain Army elements and the entire
 Navy failed to support the Marines effectively and the Phib u`i Government
 apparently was aware of the plot.  It is believed that the Navy C-in-C.,
 although directing the armed insurrection at first, later lost heart and
 withdrew Navy support from the Marine units.
 Although the a-rents over the weekend represent an unsuccessful effort
 to oust the Phibul regime, It is possible that some sort of a political
 agreement may now have been reached.  Phibul was knows to have had several
 meetings lately with Direlk Jaiyanaman, a leader of the Pridi group,,  It is

 certainly possible that the insurrection wad basically an effort to rid the
 Government of the objectionable but powerfZ]. Army figures who control the
 Phibul regime.  The Navy is believed to wyt the dismissal of these leaders
 as well as changes in the Cabinet and no  interference from the Arn.*.  if
 the Navy, which is loyal to Pridi,ucceeded in its objectives, it is
 probable that sunporters of Pridi    Id be included in a reorganized goverxi
 ment.  Vurther, should the undesirable members of the Phibul regime be
 dismissed, the high degree of dissatisfaction within the armed forces would
 be greatly alleviated and a more stable situation in Siam would ensue~,,

 ii.can leaders have announced their rejection of the Dutch proposal to settle
 the Indonesian stalemate by means of a roundtable conference at The IHIaague,
 it Is believed that the rejection stemmed primarily from the Dutch refusal
 to restore the Republicans to a position of recognized governmental authority
 at their former canital, Jogjakarta.,  The FTM Commission for Indonesia can
 be exnectod to exert pressure to effect a compromise on this point.

 Liberal Panty r   oups under 'iuirino.  The Liberal Party, currently
 split over a rump Senaate vote ousting party leader Jose Avelino as Senate
 President, shows signs of rallying under President Ouir.i.no.  Avelino and
 a few of, his followers have been temporarily purged from the party and,
 to date., he has been unsuccessful in his attempts to strike back at his
 political enemies,.
 In the Senate, a special committee is daily conducting hearings on
 charges of graft and corruption lodged against Avelino.  Two of his
 supporters, Senators Lopez and Tdagalona, have raet with President -luirino
 and, according to reports, may be you over to the ' uirino group?  The
 Senate Electoral Tribunal is currently examining protests made 13 months
 ago by the 'inority Party against the election of three other Avelino
 supporters.  it is possible that the graft charges will cause the defection
 of a considerable number of other followers to the Nuirino camp, thus further
 undermining Avelino's political position

 numerous islands is not universally recognized.  In an article published
 in an obscure Spanish periodical last fall, one Emilio Pastor y Santos,
 unofficially associated with the Philippine legation at Madrid, wrote he
 had "discovered" that under the Treaty of 1 July l599, by which Spain
 ceded her possessions in Mcronesia to Germany, certain rights were re-
 served and certain islands omitted from the cessioh.  The article es-
 caped general notice until it was condensed and reprinted in a Madrid
 daily acme months later
 In January it was announced that the Spanish Foreign 'sinister had
 discussed the subject in a cabinet meeting.  A subsequent press release
 of the Foreign Office asserted, "These rights subsist fully and since
 these territories are under trusteeship at the present moment, it is
 fitting to recall that they are Spanish possessions, without prejudicing
 the right to bring up the subject again as the national interest may demand,
 when this question is being decided internationally."
 Sr. Pastor, in his original article, not forth the strategic value
 to Spain of refueling stations among the Micronesian islands, which he
 described "as the keys to the sea lanes of half the world,"  He also
 suggested that the acquisition of such naval stations would promote closer
 Spanish relations with the Philippines and foresaw the island installation
 of a radio transmitter to broadcast Spanish programs in the Far East.  He
 may have been slightly more realistic when he mentioned Spanish claims as
 assets in future diplomatic bargaining.  Since Spain, however, did not press
 these claims during the thirty years of Japanese occupation, it is doubtful.
 that a legal case exists.
