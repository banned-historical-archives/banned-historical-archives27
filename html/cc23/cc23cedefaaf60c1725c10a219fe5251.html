 There are continuing indications of the urgency of the campaigns for production and
 austerity and the latter appears to receive more emphasis than the former.  Reports
 of difficulties in ideological training, production, teacher attitudes, extravagance,
 etc. indicate that Southwest China is not yet completely assimilated.  There are.
 explicit attacks on Catholic institutions.  The Resist America, Aid Korea donations
 drive.-appears to be drawing to a close, in accordance with the original schedule.

 Stepped-up Activity and Propaganda:  The nation-wide drive for increases in production
 and avoidance of waste continued to receive primary consideration and the greater
 .emphasis was on avoidance of waste. Meetings of Government or Party officials at various
 levels to step-up the drive are reported from Peking, Yangchow, Chungking, Dairen,
 Hangchow, Kaifeng, Nanking, Chinchow, Foochow, Hofei, Canton, Nikiangsu, Mukden,
 Wuhsi, Tsitsihar, Wuhan, Shanghai, Lanchi, Antung, Amoy, Soochow, Kirin, and Yungan.
 The Northwest Bureau of the Central Communist Party, meeting at Sian on 7 December,
 devoted most of its time to the drive.  Meetings were held in numerous hsien of the
 Central and South China Military and Administrative Area, and additional hsien and
 local sessions were reported from Yunnan, Hunan, Kiangsi, and Honan Provinces.  Some
 8,000 Government cadres met in the last-named province.  Special committees to push
 the drive were reportedly set up in North Anhwei, North Szechwan, Wuhan, Peichiang
 Hsien of Kwangtung Province, Tayeh Special Area of Hupeh, and in Sinkiang Province,
 where Government Chairman Pao-erh-han heads the new committee.  On 29 November Peking
 reported that all dailies in Peking carried reports on the production and austerity
 drive.  Most of these told of progress,but an editorial in PEOPLE'S DAILY flayed
 "corruption and extravagance," citing as a horrible example the "huge waste
 .and heavy Government cost" In the provincial offices of Hopei.   Regional broadcasting
 stations reported new increased production quotas by factories, stores, farms and
 public utility companies; announced gains in production and economy; and listed
 some methods used to achieve these gains.  Dairen (2 Dec.) said members of the
 Youth Corps in the Dairen Shipyard had taken the lead in alerting workmen on ways
 to economize.  The same station (5 Dec.) said teachers in this shipyard had devised
 a new textbook o  literature composed almost entirely of lessons on this topic.
 Dairen (4 Dec.) announced that the Dairen Native Products Company would open 24 new
 retail stores in the area "to stabilize the economy."  Mukden (10 Dec.) announced
 that a hsien department store in Liaosi Province had discarded "conservative methods
 and increased transactions."  Mukden (4 Dec.) said the Trading Section of the
 Mukden People's Government is adding 16 retail stores in various rural areas.
 Foochow (4 Dec.) announced that the people had banded together to increase production
 "as a result of their political indoctrination" during the Resist-America, Aid-Korea
 campaign.  Hankow (4 Dec.) reported that in four large textile factories there had
 been a "great political awakening," with a corresponding increase in production.
 One contribution of the East China Military and Administrative Committee, according
 to Shanghai (4 Dec.), was the cutting of cars used by cadres from 120 to 50.  Chinchow
 (3 Dec.) said workman Wu Kuo-hua replaced a defective pipe in a certain factory
 with an old one, rather than a new, thus saving 200,000 yuan.  Sweepers in that
 factory use only three brooms now instead of the former six.  Workers at a steel
 factory, Chungking (8 Dec.) reported, made a considerable saving by using scrap
 metal to make machine parts.  Yangchow (4 Dec.) announced that Cheng Hwei, workman
 in the North Kiangsu Yangchow Postal Telephone Administration, saved the State 33
 million Yuan by innovations in the telephone service  and at the same time improved
 the service "so that it is even better than the telephone service under the old
 regime."
 Yangehow (5 Dec.) announced that the People's Banks in Haian, Nantung and Tungtai,
 NorthKiangsu, had started a campaign for increased production and austerity among
 farmers, and that the Haian bank had set up 10 offices in villages to promote the
 drive.  Hangchcw (10 Dec.) said that "for the purpose of protecting the interests
 of the cotton farmers," but also, presumably, to increase the deliveries of
 cotton, farmers who deliver cotton at the Yuyao stations in lieu of "public grains"
 will be paid five percent more than the officially quoted cotton price.
 According to Shanghai (10 Dec.), the Communist Party branch headquarters in the
 Wuhu Match Plant prodded workers into making suggestions for increasing production
 and saving, and finally obtained a suggestion that the length of the matches be
 shortened one-fifth, which was adopted.  This not only saves materials, but makes
 packing go faster.  Taiyuan (10 Dec.) claimed that the Wu Chow Pharmacy, Taiyuan,
 increased its business 14 million yuan simply by shortening the work day of

 pharmacy clerks from the customary 16 to 17 hours to a mere 12 hours.            As a result
 of the change the clerks have time for study, and also give more attention to
 increasing business.  Tsinan (3 Dec.) reported that in the Second Chu the quota
 of processing 270,000 pairs of military footgear was "essentially completed."
 Wang Tse-heng devised a method of cutting with shears rather than knives, and making
 the same material cover 227 pairs rather than the former 196.  For their good work
 the employees here were granted a bonus of 15 billion yuan, 8 billion of which
 immediately was turned over to the local donation campaign.
 Weaknesses and Failures:  Many weaknesses in the drive to produce more and save more
 are admitted, while some weaknesses may be detected even in the success stories.
 For instance, Peking (7 Dec.) announced that "the People's Democratic regime has
 again demonstrated its superiority by reducing commodity prices in winter, the
 season of boom sales."  A cut in the price of cotton was announced., because of an
 increase of 70 percent in production, and there was also a cut in the price of
 edible oils.  Fuel oil prices were cut by from 3.87 to 12.14 percent "in order to
 minimize the operational cost of communications and transportation," and the price
 of kerosene was cut 5 percent.
 However, an increase in the price of food was announced at the same time.  This was
 explained in two ways.  First, because grain at the time of delivery had a high
 moisture content, the present "improvement in the quality called for a necessary
 increase in price."  Second, by raising food prices the State-operated trading
 concerns "not only stabilized commodity prices, but also encouraged peasants to
 sell their foodstuffs," thus enabling the Government to "control more material,
 which will be the cornerstone for price stabilization next year."
 The Hangchow radio (30 Nov.) announced that State-operated monopoly corporations
 in Chekiang Province had "stabilized prices" as ordered by the Central Trade Ministry.
 Cotton towels were cut up to 2.12 percent in price, and cotton socks 2 percent.
 The price of rice was raised 4 percent, flour 2.5, wheat 7 and other grain 6 percent.
 Peking in Numeral Code (30 Nov.) quoted from a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial criticizing
 "red tape" in Government organs.  A secretarial work conference had been called to
 prepare an "oppose-office-red-tape exhibition," and it was pointed out that it took
 some official documents four or five months to make the rounds through scores of
 departments and across the desks of as many as 10 responsible cadres.  A Peking
 Home Service broadcast (1 Dec.) pointed out that an inventory of the railway south
 of Shathaikuan uncovered unrecorded property worth 4,000 billion yuan.
 As usual, the Southwest was the locus of a large proportion of the admitted weaknesses.
 Peking in Numeral Code (9 Dec.) reported that at the Chungking Number 101 Steel
 Factory at least 10,000 tons of mechanical and steel materials not on the books was
 discovered, much of it seriously damaged through neglect of the cadres:  Responsible
 cadres even sought to discourage inspection work at the factory, on the pretext
 that it would "hinder production."  Chungking (29 Nov.) said that because `of
 inexperienced cadres,collection and purchase of tong oil in Ta Hsien, North Szechwan,
 reached only 20 percent of the quota.  According to Chungking (6 Dec.) great
 confusion was discovered in transportation of materials by the State-operated Native
 Products Company, Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, and Department Store, with each
 company wasting about 2 billion yuan.  Confusion was so great that some transport
 vehicles even returned goods to the original loading points.  Other extravagances
 in the companies were noted.  The Native Products Company spent 4.44 million yuan
 a month on stationery alone, and water, power and stationery costs of each company
 averaged 6 million.  Chungking (8 Dec.) said that the Chinese Edible Oils Company
 took the attitude that no further economies could be made, while a check showed
 gross negligence in inventory controls.  Workers in the Chungking city offices
 and in the Southwest Finance Bureau were found to be "very lukewarm toward the
 production and austerity movement."

 Negligence in handling Government grain was reported from South Szechwan by
 .Chungking (5 Dec.) because of poor warehouse management and failure to make periodic
 checks. In Pa Hsien grain damage ranged from 20 to 80 percent, and in Pishan Hsien
 most of the grain was wormy.  Chungking (6 Dec.) said worm infestation was up to 8
 percent in Kulin Hsien, South Szechwan, while damage by worms and moths was consider-
 able in Hochuan Hsien, Suinan townlet, Tzuchung Haden, and in Neichiang, Loshan and
 I-pin Special Administrative Districts.  Poor results in grain collection in the
 Third Chu, Kaiyang Hsien, Kweichow Province, reported by Chungking (1 Dec.), were
 blamed on instigations of landlords, who told peasants it was not necessary to
 report correct figures on the harvest.
 Chungking (6 Dec.) also reported that the Tsechung Salt Works was still not in
 production in South Szechwan, even though 800 million yuan had been spent on its
 construction.  The Chengtu Brick Works, West Szechwan, was built at a cost of 600
 to 700 million yuan, and after its completion it was found that no raw materials were
 available.  Most construction projects in the Southwest in the past two years were
 said to be "poorly planned and organized and not completed according to schedule."
 There were many signs of complacency and. extravagance among working cadXes in North
 Szechwan, Chungking said (1 Dec.), and inspection teams were being sent into the
 rural areas to investigate the cadres.  Farmers had fallen behind in South Szechwan,
 and the cadres were again blamed.  Extravagances in the area were highlighted.
 Chungking (3 Dec.) reported that three Youth League members were guilty of spending
 extravagantly on marriages.  The same radio (12 Dec.) reported that cadres of
 Tsuchung, Chienyang, Neithiang and Lu Hsien had called a meeting to put a stop to
 extravagances in cadre marriages.  Cadreman Ma Ken-shih of Chienyang wasted 300,000
 Yuan; Liu Shih-chiu spent so much on his wedding he..had no money to buy spring
 fertilizers; Wang Yu-fan wasted his life's savings on his wedding.  Chungking
 (11 Dec.) said "signs of serious extravagance, lethargy and complacency had
 appeared among peasants" of Mienyang, Tzuchung, Wusheng and Hochuan Hsien, South
 Szechwan.  A director in the Peasants Association of the Fourteenth Chu, Lu Hsien,
 invited 264 guests to celebrate his birthday, while a Peasants Association
 director in another hsien invited 172 guests to celebrate his birthday, some of
 them even borrowing money to buy him gifts.
 Second to Chungking, the Chekiang Province Regional transmitter at Hangchow held the
 record for reporting failures in the increased production and austerity drive.
 Here, too, the cadres were the whipping boys.  Hangchow (5 Dec.) quoted a cadre
 at Haimen as saying:  "I wish I was not a cadre  so I could make more money in the
 course of a few years."  The same radio (4 Dec.S reported that in rural organiza-
 tions the Youth League had too many lower-level cadres holding other jobs, causing
 them to neglect the Youth League and placing a heavy burden on a few.  Hangehow
 (6 Dec.) said the Chiahsing branch of the China Miscellaneous Goods Company filled
 only 72 percent of its sales quota for the third quarter because cadres were afraid
 of selling too much and losing control of the market.  They made little attempt
 to sell unpopular items, failed to order goods that would meet the local require-
 ments, and needlessly tied up 800 million yuan in unwanted materials.                Damage was
 also serious, with 52 bolts of cloth molded in one place.
 Farmers in Chekiang also were having troubles.  Harvests in the Fuyang area were
 good, Hangehow reported (30 Nov.), but "due to a lack of proper leadership," they
 did not utilize this prosperity to increase national production, but wasted money
 on eating, drinking and extravagances.  In Loching there was a shortage of oxen
 even for farming, as well as a shortage of "urgently needed leather."  Experiments
 in Loching in the tanning of pig skins have been under way since June.  Formerly
 such  ,cperiments failed because of poor processing, but now a Loching plant has
 prod_ a:  3,700 excellent skins, and 3,200 have been sold.
 Hangchow (9 Dec.) reported eight casualties from "accidents and poisoning" since
 February because of the "bureaucratic practices and neglect of the Chientang
 River Bridge engineering section of the Hang chow Railway subbureau of the
 Shanghai Railway Administrationo--",?Personal extravagances are prevalent in this
 area too.  Hangchow (3 Dec.) said the Chekiang People's Government from January

 to October wasted 116,750,000 yuan, 15 percent of its expenditures, on "entertain-
 ment, gifts, free water, electricity, and miscellaneous expenses."  The same radio
 (6 Dec.) said that in Keh Chiao village, near Shaohsing, a million yuan was spent
 on presentation of one patriotic play.  Again it was reported (1 Dec.) that
 extravagance in the Native Products Company and the China Foodstuffs Company was
 "very serious," with more than 80 million yuan wasted this year.
 Other regional stations reported weaknesses.  Hankow (30 Nov.) said the Wuhan
 aquatic, products control had lost a great deal of money.  Peking reported in numeral
 code (9 Dec.) that six inspection groups of the South Anhwei and Wuhu Capital
 Ascertainment Committees had discovered that the South Anhwei Food Bureau and
 the First Food Processing Mill had failed by 200 million yuan to make proper
 inventories.  Wuhan (7 Dec.) admitted a shortage in some native products, and said
 the prices on some items had doubled.  Shanghai (30 Nov.) reported that uninventoried
 goods worth 7 billion yuan were uncovered at the Huainan Mineral Resources Bureau.
 Tsinan (5 Dec.) told of extravagances in weddings and funerals in the villages.
 At Tsuishihkwan village, Third Chu, Tai Hsien, the village chief, Tsui Cheng-shih,
 spent 1,722,500 yuan entertaining the entire village at the marriage of his son
 Tsui Cheng-wen, on 11 November.  Hung Hsueh-cheng had a whole troupe of priests
 and professional funeral attendants at the funeral of his mother 27 September, at
 a cost of 10 million yuan.
 Hofei (10 Dec.) reported a cadre meeting in Minchuan Hsien, at which cadres were
 charged with dereliction of duty because they had done nothing to promote production
 and economy, despite rich harvests.  Haifeng (3 Dec.) reported violations of the cash
 control system by 256 units in Honan Province.  Mukden (29 Nov.) reported that the
 Department of Industry of the Northeast People?s Government had called attention
 to "certain undesirable tendencies," such as inappropriate quotas of raw materials,
 failures in inspecting and repairing mechanical equipment, and too much overtime
 work in factories and stores.  Wuhsi (1 Dec.) reported a 22 November meeting in
 Chengehow to study plans for increasing the flow of goods between the city and rural
 areas.  Because of the "traditionally powerful business interests" of Chengchow,
 and their "feudalistic methods,} trade had been disrupted and held back.  Dairen
 (29 Nov.) said that staff workers in Plant Number 11 of the electrical supply
 industry had looked upon the increased production and austerity drive as "beneath
 them, and intended only for the laborers,"  After a checkup of their work they
 changed their attitude.  Wuhan (12 Dec.) reported the formation of investigating
 committees to "enforce official directives on economic operation" in Hsiangyang,
 Mienyang, Tungcheng, Y ingcheng, Tungshan, Hsiaokan, and Yunmeng Hsien of Hupeh
 Province.
 Tightening of Central Controls:  There are indications of a steady strengthening
 of controls which seem related to the austerity drive.  Private businesses are
 being made more subservient to the State, while State-operated concerns are being
 brought ever closer to the Central Government at Peking.  The Peking Home Service
 (30 Nov.) announced that the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the
 CPPCC had named Chen Shu-tung as chairman and Sha Chien-li secretary of a
 preparatory committee to plan for an All-China Federation of Industrial and
 Commercial Circles.  Members of the committee are Li Wei-han and Chang Nai-chi,
 After this committee lays the groundwork the new centralized organization will be
 set up.  Peking announced in numeral code (11 Dec.) that In South Kiangsu 'the
 State-operated food companies, the cooperatives, and transportation facilities
 will be centralized with a common director.  Hangchow (12 Dec.) said that the
 Hangchow city government had called upon all commercial firms to set up a committee
 to check upon "business morals," and eliminate the 73 methods of cheating that had
 been uncovered.
 Mukden (30 Nov.) announced that the Northeast People's Government had decided to
 pay all employees of State-operated concerns only one half of their wages in cash,
 and the other half in new "wage payment certificates in kind," which may be used
 in all purchases and payment of bills with State concerns, but not in transactions
 with private merchants.  Holders of these certificates also will "enjoy priority when

 are ordered to enlarge the State-controlled stores and "speedily procure the
 necessary commodities."  Plans also are announced to speedily open State-operated
 retail stores in the factory and mining areas where the certificates will be used.
 This measure. obviously seems intended to out into private business.
 Dairen (4 Dec.) announced that the Dairen-Port Arthur branch of the China Industrial
 Equipment Company was "helping private companies" to organize into joint operational
 organizations for processing and ordering of goods.  Hankow (4 Dec.) said that
 private industry in the Wuhan area had made great progress in expanding production
 because of heavy orders placed by Government units.  For instance, the Hengshen
 Machine Works was reopened because of a 3-billion-yuan order from the Department
 of Heavy Industry.
 Sian (7 Dec.) reported organization of cooperatives in the Tacheng Special District
 with 1,000 members.  Small businessman Liu Ta-cheng was "very happy to join the
 cooperative, as it greatly increased his business."  We are not told what would
 have happened to his business had he refused to join.  Chungking (1 Dec.) quotes
 cadres as telling peasants that they must join cooperatives in order to get supplies,
 as private merchants will be closed out as soon as the cooperatives are organized.
 Peking in numeral code (9 Dec.) gives an illustration of the tightening control over
 State-operated concerns.  The North China Textile Administrative Bureau completed
 its examination of inventories in all subordinate mills, and turned over to the
 State 150 billion yuan in "surplus circulating capital" and 80 billion yuan in
 "surplus stockpiles."  Tientsin Number 2 Mill contributed 8 billion yuan to the
 State.
 Corruption and Squeeze:   Judging  from the number of cases of tax evasion, fraud
 and corrupt practices reported by the Chinese Communist radio, the moral stature
 of business men and State employees is not increasing very rapidly.  Peking reports
 in numeral code (12 Dec.) the largest single case of graft;  "reactionary factory
 owners" in Tientsin, Tsingtao and Peking, defrauded the Government of 10 billion
 yuan on military raincoat contracts.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial is quoted as
 saying:  "Let the raincoat contract case teach us a lesson in refinishing and
 purchasing control."
 Dairen`(6 Dec.) reported that the local Bureau of Trade uncovered 91 violations
 among local merchants of price ceilings, licensing regulations, smuggling laws and
 other regulations.  The Kuo Ching Company alone made excess charges totaling 141.42
 million yuan, while the Chung Hua company made secret profits of 26.53 million.
 Fines were assessed against all the merchants, the amount of the fine ranging from
 5 to 30 percent of the working capital plus confiscation of all illegal gains.
 Illegal action was reported to be widespread among local restaurants.  For instance,
 Cheng Cheng reduced the size of buns from 4 to 2.8 ounces, and Su Hua raised the
 price of a bowl of rice from 900 to 1,200 yuan.
 Hangehow (3 Dec.) reported that Turn Li-kang of Sheng Hsien worked himself into an
 important position, and then diverted 1.89 million yuan of public funds to his own
 use.  Hangchow (10 Dec.) said that Shen Te-shen, an employee  of the Tax Bureau
 of the Department of Finance of the Chekiang People?s Government, was sentenced.
 to six years in prison for defrauding the Government of 1,929,120 yuan and more
 than 42 tan of rice.  He had two accomplices, Yeh Hai-chao and Yuan Yin-kuan.
 Chungking (9 Dec.) reported that in Wsinnyuan Hsien, Szechwan, 30 persons were
 turned over to the court on charges of corruption involving 90,000 cattier of
 grain.  Chen Yu-ching, chief of the hsien food bureau, and Chen Chiao-kai were
 sentenced to death.   The others were given prison sentences.  Chungking (3 Dec.)
 reported that the Government had seized a "number of wicked business men" who
 undermined the finance structure through speculation.  Canton (8 Dec.) told of the
 trial and death sentence for (Yen Keng-yao), manager of a privately owned coal
 mine, who "used underhanded methods" to get a billion yuan for use in developing
 a coal mine, and used it instead for buying explosives and for smuggling.

 Kaifeng (6 Dec.) told of illegal exactions by police under the guise of benefit
 theatrical performances.  Police Substation Number 11 spent a million ,yuan on a
 troupe and demanded that the populace support it. Substation No. 12 collected 1.1 mil-
 lion yuanfrom the populace to support a show, and. many people were forced to buy
 theater tickets they could not use.  Hankow (11 Dec.) reported that Kiang Han-chih,
 Shen Cheng-i and Kiang Wen-ching had been handed over to the Wuhan Peoples
 Court as leaders of a band of smugglers.
 Numerous cases of tax evasion also were reported.  For example, Dairen
 reported that Wang Te-ching, owner of Hain Hain Leather Facto, confessed Dec.)
 evasion of 400 million               "                       ~', confessed to
 Yuan in taxes, "because he was influenced by the campaign
 to stop tax evasions."    As a result four other factory owners admitted evasions."'
 Manager Kao of the Yung Hsing Leather Factory admitted evasion of 42 while Wang Hsiao-hsien told the Tax Bureau his payments            d  million touyann,
 audit showed he owed 57 million                            were in order, though an
 uditonh  and many                                 Over 30 firms in the area have admitted
 any "are still holding back."  Chinchow (30 Nov.) announced that
 Weng Chen-li had brought to light tax evasions of 2.19 million yuan by a local
 merchant. Weng was quoted as saying, "I consider the implementation of the
 Nation's tax laws one of my most important duties."  The Tax Bureau rewarded him
 with 20 percent of the amount for making the report.
 Wuhsi (1 Dec.) reported a meeting in Soochow of 3,700 factories for ""education against tax evasion."" Chungking     from stores
 that evasions in Lu Hsien involving 21 million yuan are being  (12  sprocessed, "but said e eofsons
 in Lu Hsien still are rampant."  The report said that ""unerthe pressure    an

 and the number of known cases totaled 2,372.
 IDEOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENTS
 Thought Reform:  Next to increased production and austerity, the radio
 stress to the demand for a strengthening                    l             lave clet
 Peking in numeral code (2 Dec.) reported that otheDepartment of Pub icitycofthe'
 East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party had decided that by the end of
 1953 instruction in Communism and the Communist Party would be given to all
 workers in the East China area.  One-third of the "aggressive elements" among
 industrial workers will attend such schools during 1953, in rotation; they will
 "disengage themselves temporarily from production" to receive Communist training.
 These special ideological schools will have 2,000 "political teachers," who also
 will train new teachers from among the workers.  At an expanded meeting
 standing committee of the Democratic National Construction Associatio, rof the
 eported
 by Peking in numeral code (6 Dec.), it was decided to make an orderly start
 toward thought reform among cadres and in industrial and commercial circles; the
 movement in the latter group is to be tried experimentally in Peking and Tientsin
 to gain the "necessary experience to expand into the various local industrial and
 commercial circles over the Nation."
 Shanghai (6 Dec,) reported a city government meeting for discussion of ways to
 cut public costs..  Vice Mayor Pan Han-Nien warned that in order to carry out a
 plan for simplification in Government  "the ideological mobilization must be
 carried out first."  Hangchow (2 Dee0) reported that at a political education
 meeting for workers of all trades in East China, held 25 October - 1 November,
 it was decided to utilize all available specialized trainianizans,
 including the Communist Party, the Youth Corps, and all "activegelements," to
 carry Communist education to all trade workers.  Dairen (29 Nov.) announced that
 a permanent check-up committee had been set up in the Dairen Steel Works to
 "investigate the degree of cultural improvement" among the workers and to reward
 model teachers.  Shanghai (8 Dec.) reported a symposium of all East China cadres
 to "discuss ideology remolding and a study of Mao's ideology."  Mukden (7 Dec.)
 declared that the thought reform movement in Peking had aroused great interest in
 the Northeast, and literary circles had called on the people to study proletarian
 thought, and displace their feudalistic and capitalistic thinking. The same
 station (3 Dec.) said the "remolding drive" in Mukden had resulted in studies by
 8,312 Party members, 8,670 New Democratic Youth League members, and 9,240 Govern-
 ment organ cadres.

 In Kwangtung Province, according to Wuhan (2 Dec.), more than 6,000 farmers' groups
 had been reorganized, with 50,000 persons engaged in "improving the political
 consciousness" of the farmers.  Chungking (8 Dec.) reported that new methods had
 been adopted in cadre schools of Nanchang, Suining and Yingchuan Hsien, North
 Szechwan, with stress placed on a study of the Soviet's "happy lives."  A system
 of rewards and punishments was suggested because nearly 25 percent of rural cadres
 still had "thoughts of lethargy."  Chungking (12 Dec.) severely criticized Steel
 Factory Number 101 because of the feudalistic thought of its workers, and said
 the factory had been ordered to improve immediately its technical level and
 "correct the errors in thinking among the workers."              -
 Schools and Teachers:  Peking reported in numeral code (29 Nov.) that a conference
 of the China Democratic League was held in that city 13-27 November.  During the
 conference some leading Party members described "promotion of the study movement
 of teachers as the most important political assignment today."  Further stressing
 the need for "ideological improvement" among the teachers, the Peking Home Service
 (3 Dec.) quoted from a PEOPLE'S DAILY article by a professor at Peking Teachers College.
 In the article, entitled,"I Must Reform," the professor admitted that he must
 "correct his thought" and become a "people's professor."  The Home Service (4 Dec.)
 quoted from a KWANGMING DAILY article which asserted that teachers in colleges of
 Peking and Tientsin had made sufficient progress to "enter the second phase of
 thought reform."
 Wuhan (11 Dec.) reported that Chao I-mien had called a meeting of the Central and
 South China Communist Party Propaganda Bureau to "discuss means of overcoming the
 ideological shortcomings of the schools."  He emphasized the teachers' responsibility
 for indoctrinating the youth with the "new political consciousness," gave a detailed
 analysis of the courses of study that should be used in the schools and "pointed out
 the errors in current thought of educators." Y angchow (29 Nov.) told of a winter
 class for teachers being held at Haimen, North Kiangsu "to raise the ideological
 standard of teachers and administrators."  The same station (6 Dec.) reported a
 meeting of all primary school principals and teachers to discuss the increased
 production and austerity drive.  Mukden (1 Dec.) told of a Jehol primary and middle
 school teachers meeting 6-12 November, with awards distributed to teachers for out-
 standing achievements in "elevating the political consciousness of the children."
 Hankow (5 Dec.) stated briefly that the Municipal Cultural and Educational Bureau
 was "carrying out a remolding of teachers."  Wuhan (6 Dec.) reported that the
 authorities had organized study groups to "improve the thought of the teachers," and
 to "intensify political indoctrination."  Teachers of science and biology were urged
 to use only Chinese materials, and to "eliminate all imperialist theories."  They
 also were urged to repair old equipment for reuse.
 As usual, the most damaging criticism of teachers for failure to reach satisfactory
 ideological standards came from the Southwest.  Chungking (20 Nov.) reported that
 both students and teachers at Cheng Hua University and Chengtu School of Fine Arts,
 and at Liwu, Shuteh, Huayang and other middle schools of Chengtu, pay no attention
 to politics and have a strong desire to be specialists and bury their heads in
 curricular studies.  At Cheng Hua 42 percent of the students failed in a current
 events test, while at Shuteh Middle School 153 out of 197 failed.  The students
 have "decided to read newspapers every evening from 7 to 8."  Nothing is said of
 what forces induced this decision.  Chungking (5 Dec.) complained that in Luchuan
 Hsien 120 out of 137 primary school teachers failed a current events test, and many
 teachers still "teach reactionary ideas."  In Chengtu city some of the teachers had
 never even heard of resist-America, aid-Korea donations, and the increased production
 and austerity drive.
 Peking, in numeral code (12 Dec.), reported on the Third Expanded Meeting of the
 Southwest Educational and Cultural Committee at Chungking, ending 3 December, with
 68 persons present, including high school principals and professors' representatives.
 The meeting was called to discuss changes in "educational methods and the indoctrina-
 tion of new thought among the educators."  Chu To-nan, Committee chairman, made a
 report on "the problem of educational administration and self-reform in the
 educational circle."  Chu declared:  "The main problems in education today are the

 attitude of many teachers that they are above all others and above politics, and
 the serious lack of coordination between theory and practice."  He strongly
 criticized the attitude prevalent among some professors of "not studying politics and
 not changing their thinking."  In order to change these conditions, all grade and
 high school teachers of the region will be called in for political indoctrination
 this winter and next summer.  Chu pointed out the need for "a patriotic emphasis
 in all the courses of study," and urged educational workers in the Southwest to "use
 the revolutionary techniques and the revolutionary spirit" in carrying out their
 educational duties.  Teng Hsiao-ping, Southwest Military Control Deputy Chairman,
 told the conference that reform among educators has been so weak during the past
 two years that it has affected the progress of reform on other fronts.  He added
 that if educators wish to serve the people they should be "critical of archaic
 thinking."  The occasional charges of mistreatment by teachers indicate one method
 that can be used to eliminate those who refuse to conform.  For instance, Tsinan
 (8 Dec.) reported that in the Third Village of Kuangjao Hsien, Shantung, primary
 school principal Tsui Han-hsueh mistreated his students, locking Wang Yun-i and
 Tseng Chung-tsai in a room and resorting to other "feudalistic treatment."  The
 students protested to Village Headman Liu Wen-fu.  Hangchow (30 Nov.) said that
 Yeh Chi-ling, principal of Hsialing Primary School, Tungyang Hsiang, Chekiang
 Province, forced a 12-year-old boy to blow a horn every morning, injuring his
 health and causing death.
 Little was said about the winter schools, but Yangchow, Shanghai, Hofei, Tsinan,
 Kaifeng and Foochow reported calls to peasants to enroll in the schools.  Yangchow
 (2 Dec.) said 22 high school teachers in Kiangtu Hsien, North Kiangtu, received
 special training on organization of the schools, and then called meetings of cadres
 in their own localities to make plans.  Yangchow (3 Dec.) announced that the school
 had opened at Liukang village with 126 students and 28 workers, and at Huangchao
 village with 159 students and 20 workers.  The large proportion of workers to
 students might indicate smaller enrollments than expected.
 Dairen (3 Dec.) reported a "Children love Chairman Mao" rally in the Children's
 Palace of Culture.  Prizes were given for songs, plays and poems honoring Mao, and
 "the program greatly strengthened the children's love for their great leader."
 Religious Countermeasures:  Comment on religion concentrated on the Catholic Church
 in Honan and Shensi Provinces, and especially on the Catholic orphanages in Canton and
 Kunming.  Kaifeng asserted that patriotic Catholics know that Catholicism has been
 closely tied to American imperialism,as shown clearly by such imperialist lackeys
 as Yang Ming and Kao Mou-ling.  Recause of this, patriotic Catholics in Honan
 Province organized the Catholic Reform Committee in August.  It is now supported
 by 1,033 Catholics, or 91 percent of those in the province.  The Acting Bishop of
 Honan, Ho Chi-ming, is quoted as follows:
 For the past 100 years imperialist nations have used many
 methods to gain access to our Nation and to oppress our people.
 Besides utilizing political, economic and military means, they
 have also sought to enslave our people with thought, under the
 guise of religion and education.  The minds of the Chinese people
 have been poisoned by imperialist religious influence brought to
 the Chinese people by such imperialist lackeys as Wang Ming and
 Kao Mou-ling.  We know that Catholics and their leaders the world
 over love their own people and country.  Those who demand that
 others hate their country are not true Catholics.  They must
 certainly be false believers working under a camouflage.  We must
 expose the true face of the imperialists.  We must wipe out all
 imperialist influences.  (Kaifeng, Honan Regional, 30 Nov.)
 Kaifeng (30 Nov.) quotes from a HONAN DAILY NEWS commentary which calls upon all
 Catholics to approve the Ho statement.  The commentary mentions the CPPCC article
 on freedom of religion, saying it is not contradictory to the article calling for
 everyone to live-his Motherland.  The Catholic imperialists have distorted these

 points and led the masses away from a love for their Motherland, an action that
 cannot be condoned.
 Canton (4 Dec.) reported the closing of the Shengying Orphanage and the arrest of the
 French nuns running the home.  A radio roundtable discussed the affair, and stressed
 the imperialists' cultural penetration "under the guise of religion," the urgent
 need for "patriotic Chinese Christians" to expel the imperialists, and the necessity
 for adhering to the Catholic Reform Movement.  "In the past the imperialist elements
 have used religion to drug the pe,-"ple and bind them in cultural slavery," and they
 must "make a clean break with world Catholicism."  The broadcast said 439 Catholics
 signed the Reform Movement statement,,  Wuhan (7 Dec.) claimed that of the 2,251
 children received by the Shengying Orphanage since the liberation, 94 percent have
 died.
 Chungking (6 Dec.) reported that an investigation of the Catholic orphanage at
 Kunming was under way.  It also reported the discovery in one section of Liuchia-
 shan of a grave with 119 bodies and 80 coffins,  Since the liberation only 34 of the
 300 children received by the orphanage have lived, and these facts have "boiled
 the indignation of the people, who have demanded that the Government take punitive
 action and order the expulsion of the imperialist elements,"  Chungking (9 Dec.)
 reported an accusation meeting in Kunming and the arrest of the French Catholics
 in charge of the orphanage on a charge of murder.
 Peking in numeral code (3 Dec.) announced the expulsion by the Sian Municipal
 Government of five Italian priests and one nun, including the acting Archbishop.
 The six are accused of contacting American spies since 1944, of stealing cultural
 treasures, storing weapons and ammunition, setting up a radio station, and
 "distributing reactionary books and periodicals in order to undermine the patriotic
 campaign of the Chinese people."  The persons named are Ko Lu-kao, Pien Chi-ping,
 Chia Po-chi, Chi An-le, An Fei-yueh and Sian Archbishop Wan Chiu-lou.
 Literature and Ar:  Peking in numeral code (5 Dec.) transmitted a commentary by
 Hu Chiao-mu, "Why Must Literary and Art Workers Remold Their Mentality?"  Later
 (8 Dec.) the same transmission carried an article by Chou Yang, "Readjust the
 Ways of Thinking and Improve Leadership Among Art and Literary Circles," based on
 a speech given by the author at a 24 November mobilization rally of literary and
 art circles in Peking.  Chou declared that ""the ideological confusion among literary
 and art circles is no longer tolerable,,and the process of purification has become
 imperative."  He criticized the popular movie, "The Life of Wu Hsun,"" saying it merely
 publicized "the theory of politically reactionary reformism and the road to struggle
 of individuals," and was not in harmony with the democratic revolutionary ideas of
 "heroism springing from the theory of collectivism which we want to publicize."
 He admitted that ideas of capitalism and the petty bourgeoisie still are strong,
 and demanded that artists and writers abandon even peasant culture and literature,
 and develop a real proletarian culture.  Mukden (7 Dec,) called on all literary
 workers in the Northeast -to study carefully Mao Tse-tung's theories.
 Radioand: Publications   Peking announced in numeral code (9 Dec.) 'that the Staff
 Office of the Hopei Provincial Government, the Hopei News Publication office, and
 the Department of Publicity of the Hopei Communist Party organized an examination
 committee and discontinued publication of 17 newspapers and magazines "because they
 lacked content, repeated other papers and magazines, and were ideologically and
 politically weak."  The remaining 10 publications in Hoped underwent changes so
 that their "leadership was strengthened to elevate their ideological and political
 standards."  This action cut out the expense of some 20 editors, saved. one billion
 yuan for the Government, and "further raised the guiding efficiency of papers and
 magazines," the broadcast said.
 Wuhan (7 Dec.) said that the Central and South China News and Publicity Department,
 the Federation of Labor and the Department of Industry issued a joint directive
 ordering all public and private concerns employing more than 70 persons to take
 immediate steps to set up broadcast monitoring stations.  The action was taken
 because "radio broadcasts play an effective part in carrying out political and
 ideological education of the workers."

 COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY
 Direct Action:  Renewed activity by counterrevolutionaries in the Northeast is
 suggested in some of the broadcasts from that area.  Mukden (12 Dec.) reported
 the arrest of 128 persons in Liaoyang Hsien, Liaotung Province, who were marched
 about the hsien for five days, given a public trial and the death sentence in each
 village.  The 128 were charged with having tortured and killed 533 Communist cadres
 and 366 peasants before the liberation.  Mukden (2 Dec.) told of a public trial in
 Harbin on 25 November following the arrest of a counterrevolutionary upon informa-
 tion "given by the people."  Chairman of the meeting, Wang I-Jen, exhorted the
 people to "look upon the work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries as their
 personal responsibility."  Mukden (12 Dec.) announced the arrest of 20 Ikuantao
 members who will soon be given a public trial.  They are said to have made
 several attempts to organize revolutions to "destroy the Communist Party" In Mukden
 and Antung.  Mukden further reported (12 Dec.) that intensified drives against
 counterrevolutionaries have been launched in Antung and Chinchow, and the People's
 Militia of Haichen Hsien has been strengthened. Dairen (11 Dec.) announced the
 trial and execution of Chou Shun-chi, who had been spreading anti-Communist
 propaganda and attempting. to organize an anti-Communist league in the petroleum
 plant where he worked.  "The decision of the court to execute Chou was receivee
 with acclaim by the workers of the factory," the broadcast said, and workers
 Liu Yueh-ming, Tu Kan-ya and Kang Fu testified against him,  Tsinan (30 Nov.)
 reported several cases of subversive activity in the Techow Special District during
 November and the discovery of a cache of arms in the Kushangho Grain Company
 offices.  Chinchow (30 Nov.) told of. two public trials followed by executions.  On
 11 November 50,000 attended an accusation rally in Hsiaoshenyi village for the
 trial and execution of Hsu Te-chang and Hsu Te-fu, members of a Kuomintang special
 service corps.  On 24 November 5,000 persons gathered in front of the Talienho
 Railway Station, where Tung Ying-keh was executed following a public trial, while
 Loh Tai-shan and others were given prison sentences.  Tung was charged with the
 death of Wang Ken-seng and three other men during the Japanese regime by pointing
 them out as anti-Japanese.  He was accused by Wang's sons, Wang Seng-ming and
 Wang Pao-thing?  Chinchow also reported (6 Dec.) a concentrated drive against
 counterrevolutionaries, especially Ikuantao members, with 1,200 propagandists taking
 part in the campaign.  Within two days following the start of the campaign 500
 Ikuantao members "had surrendered their certificates and the names of their respective
 organizations and had voluntarily disavowed membership in the sect."  In Loyang
 Street alone,70 persons announced their withdrawal.
 Wuhan (3 Dec.) announced that in a mopping-up campaign in process in Kwangtung
 Province since August, 5,300 "bandits and special agents" have been eliminated, and
 1,700 artillery pieces, 34,000 rifles and pistols, and 757,000 rounds of ammunition,
 shells and hand grenades were taken.  The fact that action had not been taken sooner
 was blamed on the "ignorance and complacency of a portion of the cadres and their
 neglect to make a thorough mobilization of the peasants."  Hangehow (7 Dec.)
 reported that the militia of Chenhai, Hsiangshan and Yin Hsien had strengthened
 their sentry and patrol duties and doubled their night patrols following the
 burning of a peasants association office in the Third Chu of Chenhsi, and the
 murder of Liu Chuan-ho, peasants association chief, in the Third V ilage, Chunglu
 Hsiang, Hsiangshan.  S'an (8 Dec.) said that in Tsinghai Province 6 reactionaries,
 28 bandits, including 2 leaders, 10 rifles, 2 pistols and 25,740 rounds of
 ammunition had been captured by militiamen of Hualung and Haiyen Hsien,

 that "lawbreaking landlords" Liu Ping-shan, Li Shui-an, Chou Yu-kuan and Lin
 Tso-san, First Village, Fengyao Hsiang, Fengkang Hsien  Kwei.chow, collaborated
 with dependents of local despots in Fengkang, Tsenkung, and Pingpa Hsien  and on

 Kai Hsien, destroyed a granary and 1,256 catties of grain. According to Chungking
 (6 Dec.) the Public Security office in one East Szechwan hsien arrested 21 counter-
 revolutionaries between 26 October and 3 November, including a leader who had con-
 tacted "local bandits" and secretly organized "anti-Communist forces with the
 intention of launching a rebellion on New Year's Eve of 1951." Chungking (3 Dec.)
 reported the execution of nine counterrevolutionaries, including (Mai Chiang-te)
 former Chiang officer for 16 years.  In Yunnan Province, Chungking said (30 Nova,
 six bandits were killed, including Tsai Chun-chu, a Chiang commander, and Hua blen-
 ching, deputy commander.  At Kunaring, Chungking said (1 Dec.), a large rally was
 called to try 80 counterrevolutionaries, 19 of whom were executed.  One was placed
 under surveillance, and the other 60 given prison terms.
 Counterpropaganda:  The masses are being mobilized to oppose counterrevolution,
 Chungking said (10 Dec.).  In Nanpu Hsien 250 meetings were held, and 80 percent
 of the people given enlightenment.  As a result Chairman Chang Yung-hui of the
 peasants association in Pingyung Hsiang, Pengchi Hsien, gave up his idea of resign-
 ing his position, and regained his enthusiasm.  Chungking (6 Dec.) reported that
 20,000 counterrevolutionaries have been organized into reform groups under the
 policy of "combining forced labor and ideological education."  The program was
 described as a success, "but since the counterrevolutionary cannot accomplish
 ideological reform in a short period," a few still attempt to escape from the
 camps, and are given "strict suppression" and taught that their only way out is to
 obey the authorities.  Chungking said (7 Dec.) that Kiangan Hsien had shown a
 profit from its forced labor groups, and other hsien report the system has paid
 its way.  In some cases the men are paid small sums for their work.  In Kweiyang,
 however, Chungking admitted (7 Dec.), the Public Security defense committees were
 "faced with resentment from the masses of the people."  The reasons given for this
 resentment are poor planning and a "lack of centralized leadership."  Members
 now have organized sessions to study and discuss concrete steps for implementation
 of their tasks.
 Hangchow (5 Dec.) reported the first meeting of model textile workers in the
 auditorium of the Hangchow People's Government, with 400 persons present.  One
 model worker, Sze Te-ling of the Hua Chung Textile Mill, was singled out for
 special reward because he had the arrest of six counterrevolutionaries to his
 credit.  In commending him Deputy Mayor Liu Kai-hsueh called on all model workers
 to "intensify their work against counterrevolutionaries."  Chinchow (C Dec.)
 cited the example of middle class farmer Chu Ching-ling, who knew of counter-
 revolutionary Chou Tao-Chiang but failed to report him because he considered that
 middle class farmers had no interest in such matters.  He approved of his wife's
 counsel:  "Don't offend people.  We have no say in such matters."  However, Chu
 became indoctrinated, influenced other middle class farmers to ,join in the hunt
 for counterrevolutionaries, and even forced Wang Feng to hand over his pistol.
 Chinchow (12 Dec.) reported that since counterrevolutionary Chen Ping-nan was
 punished, so many youths in the Third Chu, Haiyang Hsien, liaotung Province, have
 volunteered for the People's Militia that there are now 40 corps instead of the
 former 25.
 National Minorities:  A group of 31 Sinkiang journalists from the Uighur, Kazakh,
 Mongolian, Tartar, Uzbek and Han nationalities visited Sian on a tour of newspapers,
 broadcasting stations and other propaganda media in the East and Northeast, the Sian
 radio announced.  In Sian they were entertained by two high Communist officials,
 Chang Chia-fu and Wang Chung.  The leader of the Sinkiang group,  t-su-may, was quoted.
 as follows:
 During our tour, local Party and Governmental groups, as well
 as people of all circles, expressed a sincere interest in
 minority groups.  We are elated by this spirit of brotherly
 love.  From what we have seen we already have a greater love
 for the Motherland. When we return we shall carry out Chairman
 Mao's injunction to study Marxism-Leninism, earnestly correct

 our thoughts, and follow the tenents of Mao Tse-tung.  We must
 reconstruct ourselves.  We must report to the people of Sinkiang
 on the achievements which we have witnessed.  (Sian, Northwest
 Regional, 29 Nov.)
 Sian reported (11 Dec.) that a National Minorities Committee had been set up in
 Sining, Tsinghai, under the chairmanship of Nam-bo-cha-sha and his deputy, Cheng
 Pi-jen, to plan "for a united government of all nationalities,"  Among the 10 persons
 on the committee are Cha-mo-she, Mongolian; Mo-ta-she-taa-ko-me-cha-se, Tibetan;
 and Mordat, (Moslem).  Sian said (10 Dec.) that many Kazakhs in Tsinghai Province
 have studied the People's Revolution and shown a great interest. After studying
 collectivization,the Kazakhs of Kungho Hsien, with the aid of 100 tan of cotton
 seed and the help of cadres from the haien government, organized collective farms
 and harvested good crops.
 Hankow (3 Dec,). announced that the Central College of Nationalities opened on
 21 November with 194 students in the Central and South China branch representing
 11 nationalities.  In a speech opening the college Chang Nan-shen said the Govern-
 ment would do its best to "unite the nationalities of the region in their struggle
 for complete liberation"  and warned that they must "intensify.their study of the
 Marxist-Leninist policy of nationalities."
 Many model heroes and model fighters have emerged from the national minorities of
 Southwest China, Chungking (10 Dec.) declared.  For instance, a 60-year-old I
 tribesman of Sikang, A-pan-ni-la, captured 15 bandits in one month; Chang Min-sen,
 Wanyuen Hsien, North Szechwan, persuaded more than 1,000 to surrender; a woman of
 Suiyang Hsien, Kweichow, Huang Chen-fang, led bandit hunts and nabbed bandit leader
 Huang Cheng-I.  Chungking (29 Nov.) reported "brilliant achievements" among national
 minorities in Kweichow Province, with a marked increase in "political consciousness."
 The old "feudal stratification" has been abolished in favor of democracy and
 equality, and 32,000 of the 40,000 members of the Miao tribe have signed the
 petition to support the Five-Power peace pact.
 Chungking (30 Nov.) repo-ted that the chief of the Panchen Lama's office in
 Chungking made a cash gift to the People's Liberation Army in the presence of high
 Party and Government officials, praising the Army's "heroic exploits" and
 expressing "appreciation of minority groups in Tibet for the solicitude shown for
 their welfare."
 A hint that the minority groups in Sinkiang are not cooperating fully in the develop-
 ment of Sinkiang resources for the benefit of the Chinese and Soviet Communists was
 revealed in a Sian broadcast (5 Dec.).  A new coal mine was completed in Sinkiang
 on 25 November, and the work was done by the People's Liberation Army.
 WAR AND THE MILITARY
 Manpower Demands:  Canton (6 Dee.) announced a reorganization of the Canton Red
 Cross, with establishment of a study system for workers to "strengthen their
 study of politics," and the setting up of hospitals which will treat Army
 dependents with no charge.  Canton said (6 Dec.) that 179 medical volunteers in
 the 2nd. Medical Service Company of the Canton Red Cross, following a period of
 indoctrination, had departed for Hainan Island and the. old revolutionary bases in
 Kiangsi to train public health personnel and guard against the spread of contagions.
 Canton reported (10 Dec.) that 11 medical workers of the recently organized 5th
 Detachment, Medical Corps, had arrived in Kwangtung Province and departed for the
 Korean front.
 Shanghai (S Dec.) reported a "monster rally" in Tsingtao to give a send-off to 20
 doctors, 7 pharmacists and one nurse 'tin connection with the national defense move-
 ment."  Wuhsi (29 Nov.) reported that 13 medical workers reported to the Medical
 Bureau of the South Kiangsu Administrative office on 23 November and left the next
 day for the front after being showered with praise for their patriotism.

 Judging from the widespread effort to indoctrinate and rejuvenate the militia, it
 would appear that members of this organization may have lost some of their enthusiasm
 for carrying out the dictates of Peking.  Taiyuan (10 Dec.) reported that training
 courses had been completed for militia cadres from 20 villages of the Fourth Chu.
 In the courses they were "taught to forget the reactionary attitude of the militia
 in the past and to awaken to a new responsibility of the People's Forces by giving
 their full support to the Government."  Tainan (9 Dec.) announced that -in the
 Wenteng Military Subdistrict new steps would soon be under way in the training and
 organization of the militia, both of which are "far from sound."  Wuhan (2 Dec.)
 said plans were being made for increasing the political consciousness and strengthen-
 ing the ideology of the militia in Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi.               Chungking said (1 Dec.)
 that many errors of thinking were being corrected and political consciousness
 raised in the militia of East Szechwa.n.
 Hangchow broadcast a letter purported to be from the 1st Surgical Team, Resist America,
 Aid-Korea Volunteer Medical Battalion, Chekiang Province.  Part of the letter,
 describing the "tense and happy living" at the Korean front, follows:
 We have been at all times standing in close unity with the
 Chinese Volunteers,  In addition we also have assisted the Korean
 people in autumn harvesting, planting vegetables, and carrying
 firewood ....  Due to our enthusiastic participation in these
 activities, we have been commended several times.  Our efforts
 to treat the wounded moved them to tears.  The wounded said-
 "We must kill more American soldiers to repay them for the
 concern they have given us."  (Hangehow, Chekiang Regional,
 9 Dec.)
 Preferential Treatment:  There was a marked falling off of radio comment on
 preferential treatment for Army and martyr dependents.  However, the subject was
 not ignored by any means.  Mukden (1 Dec.) said that preferential treatment had
 become a mass movement throughout the Northeast, with the standard of living of
 dependents greatly raised. Peking annoimeed in numeral code (5 Dec.) that the
 China Railroad Workers Union was giving preferential treatment to dependents.
 Chungking (30 Nov.) reported that 54,000 sick and "unattached" soldiers had been
 cared for in that city in the past two years.  Chinchow (12 Dec.) reported that
 Tang Hai-jen, Chairman of the Women's Committee of the Fifth Chu of Tiehling, had
 organized 60 women to build houses for dependents, and two teams to do farm work.
 Wuhan (11 Dec.) reported a meeting on the subject of preferential treatment
 31 November, when it was reported that 80 percent of the dependents in four cities
 of the area, including Kaifeng, had been given aid.  Foochow (5 Dec.) reported a
 meeting of martyr and Army dependents at Hsientan, with delegates at the meeting
 promising to write more letters to relatives at the front.  Hofei (30 Nov.)
 announced a mass meeting for dependents in North Anhwei for 14 December, with an
 exhibit being planned to show the preferential treatment work, and with fixed
 quotas being worked out for areas.  Other actual examples of preferential treatment
 being given were reported by Foochow, Wuhsi, Sian, Mukden, Chinchow, Tsitsihar,
 Chungking and Wuhan.
 In a few instances the problem of Army dependents took a slightly different turn.
 Dairen (9 Dec.) announced that a martyr's dependent was found guilty of having
 illegally taken a contribution fund and sentenced to 10 days at hard labor.  The
 Civil Administrative office of the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee
 issued a directive, part of which read as follows:
 Dependents and military personnel, as well as disabled revolutionary
 soldiers and the discharged soldiers of both the old and new liberated
 areas, should be made to join the local mass activities, and associa-
 tions, as well as the model workers' conferences and People's
 Representatives Conferences of All Circles convened by the People's
 Governments of all levels, so that the political consciousness of
 these dependents and soldiers may be uplifted ....   Commendable

 dependents of martyrs and military personnel, as well as discharged
 and disabled soldiers, should be made to join in reform work.
 (Sian, Northwest Regional, 1 Dec.)
 e `stt Ame1'ica .did-Korea Donations:  The donation drive to provide planes and
 military equipment for the Korean front was definitely de-emphasized.  This could
 logically mean one of two things:  That the drive had been brought to a successful
 conclusion; or that the authorities wanted to stop the drive whether or not it had
 been successful.  In view of the erstwhile tendency to urge donations far above the
 quotas, and in view of the obvious failure in some regions to reach the quotas,
 it would appear that the authorities deliberately stopped the donation drive.
 This conclusion is borne out by the few references to the donation drive monitored
 during the two weeks.  For instance, Shanghai broadcast the following instructions
 from the East China Resist-America, Aid-Korea Association:
 The pledges for the donation campaign in all provinces, cities
 and chu should be immediately stopped; the paying up of donations
 should be fixed at a proper time.  As to the resist-America
 aid-Korea movement, the higher production and stricter economy
 campaign must be the central task at present.  (Shanghai, East
 China Regional, 11 Dec.)
 Peking, in a Home Service broadcast (30 Nov.), reported that in all China the
 people had subscribed 95 percent of the quota in the donation drive.  Mukden
 (3 Dec.) said that in the Northeast 80 percent of the quota had been reached.
 Wuhan (29 Nov.) reported that Canton had subscribed 83.9 percent of its quota.
 Wuhan oversubscribed its quota, but the committee ordered that the drive be
 closed, even though many localities had not reached their quotas.  Chungking
 (30 Nov.) blamed poor leadership for the poor showing in some localities. In
 Lushan Hsien, Kweichow, for instance, the leaders were very lax, and even now do not
 know how much money was subscribed.  In the Kweichow villages and districts 30.4
 percent of the donations still are in the hands of the officials and have not been
 reported to headquarters.
 SOCIAL REFORMS
 Land Reform:  Radio broadcasts include considerable evidence that land reform is
 not progressing smoothly.  Peking reported that in Central and South China land
 reform would be implemented in an area with 50 million people, following "a
 scrutiny of the progress of land reform" in an area with 60 million people where
 reform already has been carried out.  Villages in this latter region are
 divided into three classes: Those thoroughly reformed; those comparatively
 thoroughly reformed; and those not thoroughly reformed.  It is admitted that
 villages in the first class are "comparatively few," and even here discrepancies
 have occurred, such as "complacency and inactivity among the,village cadres and
 peasants."  The problem is outlined as follows:
 In regions where land reform is to be carried out, the work
 of activating the broad masses of people and of the peasants
 has still not been broadened to the fullest extent; the
 organization of the lower strata in the rural regions still
 presents irregularities and discrepancies.  Despite the
 peasants' strong urge for distribution of land, their political
 awareness and responsiveness to being organized are not mature
 enough to justify it.  (Peking, numeral code, 1 Dec.)
 Wuhan (6 Dec.) stated flatly that peasants have not been very successful as land-
 owners in some key areas of Kwangsi.. Province.  "Due to failure to activate the
 peasants to the fullest extent, the work of rent reduction and depositing funds has
 not been carried out successfully."  For instance, in the Sixth Chu, Fuchuan Hsien,
 only 22.7 percent of the grain refunded came from landowners.  In 19 villages of
 Yulin Hsien the percentage was only 30.  Wuhan (30 Nov.) reported from Nanning that

 a "reinvestigation of land reform" was being carried out, along with ideological
 training, in an area with 3.2 million persons in Kwangsi.  In the "reinvestigation"
 it was said that "notorious elements were arrested, weapons captured, and a large
 amount of foodstuffs taken by landlords through cheating was seized."
 Chungking (11 Dec.) reported that some land in Tehling village, Chengpo Hsiang,
 Mienyang Hsien, Szechwan, has not been farmed since it was redistributed.  Over 800
 mou in Village 14, Sanyi Hsiang, Nanchi Hsien, was left idle after redistribution.
 In some cases the cadres did not complete the redistribution, so no one was
 responsible for the land.  In other cases the poor peasants lacked capital and
 equipment, while the middle class and wealthy farmers were discouraged from farming.
 Chungking (11 Dec.) admitted that in 1-Liang Hsien, Yunnan Province, nearly 50
 percent of the population has not been organized by the cadres "to struggle
 against the landlords," though land reform is supposed to be complete.  In 23
 hsiang,"mobilization of the peasants has not done very well yet," and in 8 other
 hsiang "some peasants did not sever their connections with the landlords."
 Working cadres in Kweichow stepped up their publicity on collection of public
 grain in Kaiyang and Chenyuan Hsien, Chungking said (30 Nov.), because landlords
 had persuaded the peasants they should not deliver grain through fear of starvation.
 In the sixth hamlet of Fengshui village, Tungtzu Hsien, a peasants association
 leader was murdered.  Landlords were blamed, and three of them executed following
 a public trial.
 Marriage  awl  Much attention is still given in regional broadcasts to publicity
 and propaganda on the new marriage law.  Sian (29 Nov.) announced that a directive
 from the Northwest Military and Administrative Committee required that the marriage
 law be made part of the curriculum in all winter schools.  Tsinan (11 Dec.) reported
 that the Shantung Communist Party had issued a directive to cadres calling for
 wider propagation of the law, and pointing out that though the law has been in
 operation a year and 7 months, forced marriages and interference with marriage
 still are common.  "The masses must be made to realize that the law was passed
 to benefit them."  Hangchow (12 Dec.) said that the youth of Shangyu Chu, Chiangshan
 Hsien, Chekiang Province, had demanded freedom of marriage under the law, but
 "because of the lack of public support" there had been many cases of suicide and
 maltreatment reported.  When Ho Chia-feng of Kaochia Hsiang and Yeb Tao-lu of
 Hsiayu Hsiang applied for dissolution of their feudal marriages they were beaten
 up by the village  cadres.  The law was also publicized in broadcasts from Wuhsi,
 Hofer, Chungking, Chinchow, Kaifeng, Canton, Yangchow, Wuhan, Shanghai, Foochow,
 and Dairen.
 Hankow (12 Dec.) reported that charges were preferred against Chen Wen-fa and
 Han Yu-chi in Kiangwan village because of a forced marriage.  Both .onfessed to
 their feudalistic errors in thinking.  Wuhsi (12 Dec.) said that the People's
 Court of Chenchaing held a public trial 13 November with 200 persons present,
 and sentenced Pan Wen-cheng, Sze Ta-tse and Yung Shou-ying to jail for mistreating
 their wives and interfering in marriages.  Chien Te-ling was jailed for mistreat-
 ment, and his wife, Chao Ying-fen, granted a divorce.  Wuhsi (12 Dec.) reported
 the immediate execution of Chen Kuo-hua for a murder of his wife, Chen .King-sze,
 following a public trial attended by 1,000 persons in Wuhsien.  Hangehow (7 Dec.)
 reported an article in the CHEKIANG DAILY had a "very serious view of the situation,"
 following the suicide of a wife in that city.  Wuhan (29 Nov.) told of the death
 sentence for Chen Chien-hsing of Village 16, Second Chu, Tayeh Hsien., for inter-
 ference in the marriage of another.  Deputy Village Headman Tung Chen-li and
 Militiamen Huang Wen-te and Chang Yuan-hsin were given prison terms for condoning
 the act.  Chinchow (11 Dec.) reported that Wang I-chien was granted a divorce
 and her husband, Li Chun-chien, sentenced to 10 years in prison.  Dairen (10 Dec.)
 reported that the Chin Hsien People's Court sentenced Wang Te-fu to full confisca-
 tion of his property and den Ting-seng and others to prison terms of 6 to 20 months
 for interfering in marriages and maltreating women relatives.

 Physical Exercises:  There has been relatively little attention to the physical
 exercise broadcasts.  Chinchow reported (4 Dec.) that the Chinchow branch of the
 People's Athletic Association had decided to support the broadcasts by making the
 exercises compulsory for its members.  Classes will be conducted by Chao Chi-hsieh
 and Chao Ching-yuan, and already enrollment has jumped from 230 to 350, with a
 number of city officials enrolled.  Chinchow (5 Dec.) said that the Liaosi Province
 Athletic Association had mapped plans to carry out the physical education exercises.
 Chinchow (10 Dec.) reported that the workers of Chinchow and Liaosi are "zealously
 conducting" the physical exercises every morning.  Tsinan (2 Dec.) announced that
 nine organizations of the city had set up a committee to support the broadcasts,
 with all schools, public organizations and military cadres called upon to take
 part.  Hankow (4 Dec.) announced that all young workers of the Yuhua Textile Mill
 had been called upon to join the physical training move.  No other broadcast
 comment on the subject was monitored.
 Salt Tax:  Hangchow (9 Dec.) asserted that "at present the movement for eating
 taxed salt is being carried out with fervor" in six salt fields around Yuyao.  At
 Chierh Hsien there are 5,400 salt farmers, and each is pledged to pay 12 ounces of
 salt tax per month.  Workers formerly used untaxed salt, but have voluntarily
 changed their attitude, "since they see that the People's Government uses the
 taxes for consolidating national defenses and strengthening construction."  A
 Shanghai broadcast (10 Dec.) places a somewhat different interpretation on the
 situation in a report that at the State-operated Huaipei salt grounds a network
 has been set up to curb smuggling and prevent evasion of the salt tax by 5,000
 salt-producing households. So far this year's tax has been collected on all but
 31 one-millionths of the output.  To police these 5,000 households to prevent tax
 evasion, 1,100 workers, more than half of them Communist Party or Youth League
 members., are organized into 29 groups.  "The work for protection of the tax source
 has thus become a mass movement."
 Soviet Assistance:  The Peking Home Service (6 Dec.) quotes a Chinese Volunteer, in
 a letter, as saying:  "Since we joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association we
 have further realized that the victory of the Chinese people and Soviet aid are
 inseparable."  Peking pointed out in numeral code (10 Dec.) that in West Szechwan
 Soviet methods are being used in improving livestock.  Mukden (7 Dec.) told of a
 meeting in Tsitsihar in November to aid in developing the Heilungkiang Province
 lumber industry.  The delegates sent a telegram of gratitude to Soviet forest experts
 who had aided them.  Shanghai (6 Dec.) told of a tractor exhibition in Chu Hsien,
 North Anhwei, which greatly impressed Chinese farmers.  One was heard to say:  "We
 can get ahead only by the aid of our elder brother, the Soviet Union.  Today, now that
 I have seen a tractor, I have confidence in our success."  Another said:  "We must
 follow in the footsteps of the USSR."
 Famine and Pestilence:  Wuhan (3 Dec.) asserted that more than 32 million persons
 had been relieved of hunger and suffering durin' t-. the year in Central and South
 China.  In Honan more than 3 millions were given work-relief aid, and 96.76
 million catties of food distributed in direct relief.  Canton (6 Dec.) announced
 that, starting 20 December, passengers leaving Canton must produce smallpox
 vaccination certificates before they can buy tickets.  Mukden (30 Nov.) gives credit
 to Chairman Mao for "vanquishing plague and removing the big evil" in Jehol Province,
 where there have so far been no deaths from the disease this year.
 Democratic Process:  Hofei (5 Dec.) reports an election for a village People's
 Assembly in Minglan village, Minglan Chu, Chu Hsien.  "Now the people feel they
 are really the ruling authorities."  On the other hand, Chungking (11 Dec.)
 reported that People's Assemblies had failed,because the cadres "did not understand
 the meaning of the new democratic reforms."  In some places the officials spent
 the entire meeting time arguing over procedures, and paid no attention to
 suggestions of the delegates.  In Kweichow leading. cadres refused to call assemblies,
 because "they said they could not find acceptable delegates."

 Forced Migration:  Kaifeng (11 Dec.) reported that 72 villages, including 1,809
 households with 8,015 persons, were moved from the forest lands in the northern
 part of Pantiao, Liusi Chu, Hsinyang Hsien, Honan, between June and November.
 During the first period, from June to August, many mistakes were made because the
 cadres lacked experience.  The second period, October and November, was completed
 with no trouble "after an educational and propaganda campaign."  In the old area
 6,621 houses and 25,660 mou of land were vacated.  Han Chi-chung, one of the
 transferees, expressed satisfaction with the move, pointing out that the new
 forest lands are better.
 Huai River Project:  Shanghai said (10 Dec.) that digging efficiency among some
 teams of the 300,000 civilian workers in the Huai River harnessing project had
 increased from 1.8 to 4 cubic meters per person per day.  This improvement has
 been accomplished by "strengthening the political and current affairs study,"
 uniting and helping each other to develop collective strength, and by developing
 endurance.
