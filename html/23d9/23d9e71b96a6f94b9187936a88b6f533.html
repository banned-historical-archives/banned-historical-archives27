 washed, or could have imagined. Employee
 election rights have also been adversely af-
 fected. The Board has developed a combina-
 tion of doctrines which de-emphasize sig-
 nificance of elections, especially when the re-
 sults of the election do not favor unioni-
 zation.
 These are just a few of the substantive
 areas where the testimony indicates a devia-
 tion by the Board from the intent of Con-
 gress as expressed in the Taft-Hartley Act.
 :1 have not mentioned the Board's curious
 interpretations of "free speech";  the Im-
 proper use of its judicial powers; its refusal
 to give force and effect to the rulemaking
 handedly when different parties seek i  pro-
 tection;: the political sensitivity of                                 Board
 as evidenced by the rapid changes    its de
 cisions in response to changing po itical cir-
 cumstances; the power of the Gen rat Coun-
 sel to bar or delay recourse to th  Board; or
 the  other  unfortunate tendenci s   of  the
 agency which were disclosed durin the Sub-
 Obviously  more  Is  involved             he                            than
 merely mistaken or inadequate admi     stra-
 tion by the NLRB. For example,. Na                                  nal
 Small Business Association's strong sta    -
 case showing alleged disregard of Congres-
 sional intent by the Board. If the NLRB or
 other administrative agencies do display a
 generous tendency to apply statutory law as
 they sec fit, then this has serious Implica-
 tions for our governmental' system. Instead
 of public policy being established according
 to the wishes of the people through the
 ,representatives they elect and send to Con-
 gress, policy is being made by it small group
 of government ofictals responsive not to the
 A.me:riean people  but  to  other forces. It
 means that labor law Is being devised to
 serve the interests of unions or management,
 or the Board itself, but not to serve those of
 the American working man.
 If this Is indeed true, then the fault ulti-
 mately 11es with Congress, It Is Congress's
 responsibility to take a greater Interest in
 the work of the NLRB and other agencies,
 and to impress upon them Congress's deter-
 mination to see that Its legislative will Is
 being obeyed.
 THE  NATURE  OF  THY,  HEARINGS
 The recent hearings on the NLRB are
 part of a general study by Senator Ervin's
 Subcommittee into the present-day mean-
 ing and significance of the constitutional
 principle of "separation of powers". The Na-F
 tional Labor Relations Board, like its sister,
 agencies, the Federal Trade Commission, Se-
 curities Exchange Commission, and others,
 represents a deviation from a. strict applica-
 tion of the separation of powers principle.
 The Board is, in theory at least, an organ
 of government combining portions of execu-
 tive, legislative, and judicial powers. While it
 is independent of the direct control of the
 traditional branches, it is a creature of legis-
 lation and subject to a variety of controls
 and limitations imposed by the Congress, the
 courts, and the Executive. Controls imposed
 by Congress are, potentially at least, the most
 significant.

 ELEVEN  CZECH  WRITERS  REPORTED  SEIZED

 ARE BEATING AND ARRESTING AUTHORS
 (By Henry Raymont)
 The American chapter of REV.. the world
 association of writers, said last night it bad
 received word that Soviet Intelligence agents
 in Czechoslovakia, disguised as ambulance
 attendants, were secretly rounding up writ-
 ers and journalists.
 The report was received by Robert Hals-
 band, president of the American center, in
 a cablegram from  the association's inter-
 national headquarters in London. Mr. Hals-
 band said the cablegram was based on In-
 formation given by "a reliable source," a
 writer who had just arrived from Prague.
 The cablegram said that at least 11 Czech
 writers,  including  Ladislav  Mnacko,  the
 and Prof. Adolf Hoffineister, presi-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE        September 5, 1968
 "Then you can't come in," said the watch-
 man, slamming the door In the captain's face.
 The nonplused captain had to radio 'his com-
 mand headquarters for further Instructions.
 The troops outside the radio building also
 did not seem quite sure what their mission
 was.
 Tanks raced up and down the streets like
 charging bulls, while young men rushed out
 from the sidewalks with flaming gasoline-
 soaked rags trying to ignite the tanks' fuel
 stores. Five were set afire and one had to be
 abandoned. While the attacks went on, other
 tanks stood idle on the streets, their engines
 off, with crews quietly watching the show.
 At 11 A.M. the troops surrounding the radio
 building finally got their orders to move
 inside and stop the broadcasting. The station
 went off the air, only to be replaced within a
 half hour by the first underground transmit-
 ter of the clandestine network.
 The  network,  coordinating  15  stations
 around the country, not only provided news
 about the occupation, but became the chief
 rallying point for the developing passive re-
 sistance.
 ADVANCE PLANNING
 The planning behind it was the work of
 Jlrt  Pelikan, the  articulate, bushy-haired,
 42-year-old director of the state televisttm.
 Weeks earlier he and his associates had de-
 vised a contingency plan. This advance plan-
 ning and the services of professionals who
 went underground accounted for the high
 standards of the clandestine network.
 The Russians tried to locate the stations
 but were slow in getting direction-finding
 gear to Prague. The radio itsekf was Instru-
 mental in delaying a train carrying the
 needed  detection  equipment.  At  Ceska
 Prevova, a rail junction 80 miles east of the
 captial, Czechoslovak railroad  workers re-
 fused to                 man  a train  after having been
 alerted by the radio. For hours the train was
 left to sit in the yard.
 FACTOR IN PROPAGANDA WAR
 The clandestine network was a major ele-
 ment of the psychological warfare that was
 developing between the resistance leaders
 and the occupiers. Unable to stop the trans-
 missions, the Russians began to seize port-
 able radios from listeners In public places.
 One of the memorable posters pasted up
 after the invasion portrayed Russian tank
 men as  Arab merchants with displays of
 transistors on carpets laid out In the streets.
 The Russians, in attempt to make them-
 selves heard by the population, set up their
 own station, Radio Vltava, but hardly any-
 one listened to its announcements, delivered
 with a foreign accent.
 The clandestine radio urged citizens to
 engage the Russian soldiers in discussion to
 try to convince them that there was no
 counterrevolution in the country. Hundreds
 of people sought out the tank crews, in-
 fantrymen and paratroopers and asked the
 basic question: "Why have you come here?"
 Most Czechoslovaks speak Russian, which
 has been a compulsory foreign language in
 school since the Communist take-over  in
 1948.
 Most  of  the  discussions  were friendly
 enough. However,  the  Czechs  found that
 many of the young Russian soldiers knew
 little about the outside world. The reply to
 the basic question was usually "we follow
 orders."
 Some of the Russians held up what they
 said were unfired weapons to show that they
 had not been among those who had taken
 blood or scarred buildings.
 One sensitive noncommissioned officer said
 he wished he could doff  his uniform and
 merge with the crowd.
 On the second day of the occupation, the
 radio advised the people to ignore the Rus-
 sians. Though discussions continued, the
 groups  were smaller.
 But on Friday a general strike emptiedthe
 streets, leaving Soviet troops isolated, sur-
 rounded by almost total silence, for an hour,
 Not knowing what to expect, many fired
 Indiscriminately Into the air.
 ROAD SIGNS OBSCURED
 The clandestine radio also promoted what
 was perhaps the cleverest of the passive re-
 sistence measures-the obscuring of street
 signs and house numbers to confuse the
 occupying troops,
 People put lip spurious detour signs to
 delay additional tank columns coming from
 Poland. In the streets of Prague, signs went
 up showing Soviet troops the shortest way
 home,  "Moscow-i.500 kilometers."
 The radio campaign was supplemented by
 underground newspapers, printed on flatbed
 presses in secret basement plants and dis-
 tributed by factory workers. The papers bore
 the names of many of the newspapers closed
 by the occupying troops.
 Young men in cars and trucks drove
 swiftly through the city center, dropping off
 bundles of newspapers and leaflets. Crowds
 surged on the sidewalks to gather them up.
 The Russians countered by dropping some
 of their own leaflets from helicopters and
 having the troops distribute the Moscow
 newspaper Pravda- A Czechoslovak who ac-
 cepted these publications often found them
 snatched from his hands and was accused of
 collaborating.
 Like the clandestine radio network, the
 equestrian monument to St. Wenceslas in
 Wencaslas Square-became a symbol of resist-
 ance.
 Youths gathered there to make speeches
 denouncing the occupation. Despite a curfew,
 youths manned the monument 24 hours a
 day and defined Russians who tried to dis-
 perse them by shooting over their heads.
 POLITICAL  MOVZ THWARTED
 On Thursday, Aug. 23, as the defiance
 mounted In the streets and gunfire echoed
 through the city, the Soviet Union turned
 to the political aspects of the occupation.
 Moscow had evidently expected to form a
 government under President Svoboda-to
 assure constitutional continuity-and to re-
 organize party leadership with trusted men,
 Two steps were promptly taken by am-
 bassador Stepan V. Chervonenko, the politcal
 chief of the invasion, and by Gen. Ivan Cl.
 Pavlovsky, a Soviet Defense Minister and
 commander of the invasion forces.
 After reported consultations with the Rus-
 sians, Jan Puler, a conservative Presidium
 member,  called  on President  Svoboda  at
 Hradcany Castle to present him with a list
 of a "worker and peasant" government with
 the request that he remain as chief of state,
 President Svoboda, an army general, a con-
 vinced Communist and a Hero of the Soviet
 Union, refused, He said he would discuss
 nothing until the Czechoslovak leaders had
 been released. A message from Ambassador
 Chervonenko also failed to budge the Presi-
 dent.
 TROIKA Is SHORT-I.rVED
 Overnight Wednesday the Czechoslovak
 conservatives had met with Mr. Chervonenko
 and other Soviet officials at the Praha Hotel,
 which Is used by the Central Committee. The
 Soviet group was disappointed by the small
 turnout and by the reluctance of the Czecho-
 slovaks to join the leadership that the Rus-
 sians proposed to establish,
 After hours of deliberation it developed
 that only Mr. Bilak, Mr. Koldar and Mr. Indra
 were prepared to go on the new Presidium.
 To complicate matters, these three party
 officials apparently were unable to agree
 among themselves as to who would serve as
 First Secretary, The decision was made for
 the three to serve jointly as party leaders.
 The announcement of the troika was
 greeted with public derision, and It vanished
 from sight almost as soon as It had been in-
 vented. The Soviet political maneuver had
 failed.
 THE sEcucr CONGRESS
 In  a countermove by  the  Czechoslovak
 liberals, hundreds of delegates began steam-
 ing secretly during the night to the huge
 C.S.D. plant in Prague to hold the extraor-
 dinary 14th congress of the party.
 The congress had been originally sched-
 uled                                                                                                                          for Sept.  9,  and the delegates were
 elected during the summer. Most of them
 were pre-Dubcek and  It  was  taken  for
 granted that the new Central  Committee
 and Presidium to be elected by the congress
 would be overwhelmingly liberal.
 The delegates were informed by the clan-
 destine radio that the congress would be held
 Thursday morning at the C%.D. plant. The
 organizer.; assumed correctly that inasmuch
 as the radio was publicly announcing that
 the plant would be the site of the congress,
 the Russans would conclude it was being
 held elsewhere. This tactic worked.
 The delegates were introduced into the
 plant disguised as workers. The plant's armed
 people's militia, traditionally supporters of
 the conservatives, stood guard.
 The underground congress elected a liberal
 160-man Central Committee, which in turn
 chose its 27-man Presidium. Mr. Dubcel was
 reelected First Secretary, but in his absence
 Venek Stlhan, an economics professor, was
 chosen to act in Us place.
 At this stage. Mr. Dubcek end his col-
 leagues were being moved from iliac to Lvov,
 In the Soviet Ukraine, with a stop at Trans-
 Carpathian town of Mukachevo. They had
 not been permitted to' change clothes; they
 were Inadequately fed, and wer: exposed to
 insults and maltreatment.
 :TVOBODA I'UES TO MOSCOW
 On Friday,  Aug.  23,  President  Svcboda
 suddenly flew to Moscow follow-ng a 7 A.M.
 meeting In Hradcany Castle with Ambassador
 Cherveneriko. Mr. Svoboda said in a brief
 statement that he was going to the Kremlin
 to seek a resolution of the crit:is and that
 he would return the same evening.
 Flying on the same plane were Mr. Indra
 and Mr. B lak. but Czechoslovak Gfovernmeut
 spokesmen made it clear that they were not
 members of the Svoboda delegation. Among
 these actually accompanying the President
 were Deputy Premier Gustav Hueak, a Slovak
 and a friend of Mr. Dubcek, and Defense
 Minister Daur.
 Presidert Svoboda was received in Moscow
 with honors usually accorded a chief of state,
 but his Soviet hosts soon realized that he
 was in no mood for compromise. He mate it
 clear from the outset that he would not un-
 dertake tc? negotiate until Mr. Dubcek and
 his colleagues were freed and muted to par-
 ticipate In the talks.
 On Saturday Mr. Dubcek and the three
 other Imprisoned liberal leaders were Lown
 from Lvov to Moscow and driven to the
 Kremlin.
 INTERNED AMES HAGGARD
 They  were  a  haggard,  mentally  and
 physically exhausted group, but It was a
 victory for the Czechoslovaks to have won
 their freedom. President Svoboda  sent a
 message to the nation that, In view of the
 arrival of the four men, he was remaining
 at least another dr.y for additional talks.
 In    Prague, this  news  evoked  the  first
 moment or optimism since the invasion. But
 the Russians countered by sending      addi-
 tional forces to the capital. Soviet strength
 there rose from 35,000 men on Wednesday to
 50,000 on Friday and 90,000 on Sunday as
 the talks dragged on.
 Mr. Smrkovsky, the President of the Na-
 tional Asst-mbly, wt,e not exaggerating when
 he said later that the Czechoslovaks had
 negotiated "In the shadow of tanks and
 planes"

 The  pressure  was so  immense  that on
 Mon-clay, Aug. 26, Mr. Svoboda, Mr. Dubcek
 and the others agreed to sign the agreement.
 A communique gave no real indications of
 the substance of the accord.
 CZECH LEADERS RETURN
 At 5:20 A.M. Tuesday, President Svoboda
 and the others landed at Ruzyne Airport. By
 that time many of the tanks had disap-
 peared from large parts of the city center
 and were assembled in parks and side streets.
 Trolleys and buses were running on normal
 schedules.
 People seemed to be breathing a little easier
 and everyone seemed to be returning to work.
 At Hradcany castle, a Czechoslovak honor
 guard once again took up its post and the
 presidential flag flew from the castle staff.
 Under the Moscow accord, the Russians
 agreed to a gradual troop withdrawal in re-
 turn for a renewal of press censorship, the
 disbanding   of   non-Communist   political
 groups, the gradual removal of liberals from
 office and increasing Soviet control over ad-
 ministration. In addition, two Soviet divisions
 are to be permanently stationed along the
 border with West Germany.
 It was a high price to pay to get the tanks
 out of Prague but the Czechoslovaks had
 evidently little choice but to pay it.  Mr.
 Svoboda, Mr. Dubcek, Mr. Smrkovsky and
 the others made this clear in radio speeches
 last week.
 The invasion, said Mr. Smrkovsky, was "a
 tragedy of small nations placed in the center
 of our continent."
 BERLINERS DEMONSTRATE DURING "DAY OF
 GERMANS"
 BERLIN, September 1.-Rightists and left-
 ists demonstrated- today at the annual "Day
 of the Germans" sponsored by refugee groups
 in West Berlin. The police kept the opposing
 groups apart and there were no serious in-
 cidents.
 About 30 rightist youths showed up to
 cheer the appearance or representatives of the
 right-wing National Democratic party who
 attended under a general invitation to all
 West German state legislatures.
 The presence of the controversial rightists,
 plus rain, kept attendance to about 5,000 in
 an outdoor stadium seating 25,000.
 Speakers  emphasized  German  solidarity
 with the beleagured Czechoslovak people.
 Mayor Klaus Schutz attacked East Germany,
 which  joined  the  Soviet-led  invasion of
 Czechoslovakia, saying the East Germans had
 forfeited every right to talk about the rights
 of peoples.
 PRAVDA CRITICIZES A CZECH WEEKLY-ASKS FOR
 CLOSING OF LIBERAL WRITERS' PUBLICATION
 (By Henry Kamm)
 Moscow, September 1. Pravda, the news-
 paper of the Communist party, complained
 today that the Czechoslovak press was slow
 to adapt itself to renewed censorship.
 Pravda centered its attack on one of the
 most liberal of Czechoslovak publications,
 Literarni Listy, the weekly of the writers'
 union. Literarni Listy has been published
 clandestinely since the occupation and has
 not lost the sarcastic sting that made it a
 favorite of the intellectuals and youth.
 The Soviet party organ characterized the
 underground weekly as a "wasps' nest" that
 "continues to exist somewhere in a backyard
 and continues to play its abject role as one
 of the main ideological centers of counter-
 revolution."
 "Every sensible person understands, how-
 ever, that such a game cannot continue,"
 Pravda declared, "The counterrevolutionary
 forces must be and will be bridled."
 EDITOR IS CRITICIZED
 Jan Prochazka, a member of the weekly's
 editorial board, was singled out in Pravda for
 having "concocted an article containing re-
 volting and mean slander of the Soviet Union
 and the international Communist movement"
 in last Wednesday's issue.
 Literarni Listy has a history of suppres-
 sion. Its current editors were responsible for
 the former weekly of the writers' union, Lit-
 erarni Noviny, which was banned last sum-
 mer by the regime of Antonin Novotny. Some
 of its editors, including A. J. Liehm and Lud-
 vik Vaculik, were punished by or suspended
 from the party and not restored until after
 the start of the liberalization earlier this
 year.
 Literarni  Listy rose to a circulation  of
 300,000 in a country of 14.5 million and be-
 came a forum of liberal ideas. It maintained
 its political position in ironic language and
 savage cartoons. Its success was so great that
 before the invasion there were plans for Eng-
 lish and German-language editions.
 POLES ASSAIL WRITERS
 (By Jonathan Randal)
 WARSAW, September 1.-The state-control-
 led Polish television stepped up a resurgent
 "anti-Zionist"  campaign  today,  charging
 "Zionists" with responsibility for the "coun-
 terrevolution." Czechoslovakia.
 Branding some of the Czechoslovak liberal
 writers as Zionists, the Prague correspondent
 of Polish television linked them with Czecho-
 slovak criticism this spring of what has been
 .officially admitted was an anti-Semitic witch-
 hunt in Poland.
 The  television  man  denounced  Eduard
 Goldstuecker, the president of the Czecho-
 slovak writers union; Ladislav Mnacko and
 Pavel Kohout, novelists, and Arnold Lustig
 and Jan Prochazka of the weekly literary
 Linty. [Mr. Lustig arrived in Israel on Sunday
 as an immigrant, the Associated Press re-
 ported from Haifa.]
 "The Zionist forces were the most active
 of those who attacked Poland in March and
 allowed themselves in an atmosphere of in-
 tolerance and anti-Communism to designate
 the future Communist leaders of Czecho-
 slovakia," the Polish correspondent Czeslaw
 Berenda said.
 He said that many of these writers "do not
 share these difficult days with the citizens of
 Prague" and had fled to the West.
 Defense   Minister   Wojciech   Jaruzelski
 praised Polish occupation troops, believed to
 number 45,000 men, for fulfilling their "patri-
 otic and internationalist duties"
 Polish correspondents  accused "counter-
 revolutionaries" of seeking to pit one occup-
 ing army against another by praising Polish
 troops as "cultured and chivalrous" and de-
 picting the Soviet troops as "brutal and
 hostile."
 Zygmunt Broniarek, writing in the party
 newspaper, Trybuna Ludu, said a Czecho-
 slovak Army officer had denied that his coun-
 try was heading toward counterrevolution or
 was about to leave the Warsaw Pact. These
 were amonk avowed reasons for the Soviet-led
 intervention.
 Another correspondent denied rumors that
 Polish troops were going hungry and that an
 epidemic was raging in their ranks.

 PRAVDA CAUTIONS CZECHS ON TRADE-ASSERTS
 ONLY   "IGNORAMUSES". SEEK  TIES  WITH
 WEST
 (By Raymond H. Anderson)
 Moscow, September 2.-Pravda declared
 today that only a "pitiful handful of politi-
 cal Ignoramuses" in Prague were interested
 in reorienting Czechoslovakia's trade toward
 the     West  and  soliciting  hard-currency
 credits.
 A long article in the Soviet Communist
 party paper stressed that it was advanta-
 geous for Czechoslovakia to trade primarily
 with the Soviet Union and other Communist
 countries.
 Shortly after Prague's reform program was
 undertaken last winter, leading economic
 S 10295
 officials began to speak of the urgency of
 obtaining up to $500-million in credits to
 modernize the Czechoslovak industry.
 The possibility of the Soviet Government's
 supplying  the  hard-currency  credit  was
 raised during visits here by Czechoslovak
 leaders, but Moscow held back, apparently
 hoping to use the prospect of a loan to in-
 fluence the Czechoslovaks to restrain their
 reforms.                    -
 Damage to Czechoslovakia's economy from
 the turmoil in the wake of invasion by troops
 of the Soviet Union and four Communist
 allies  seems  to have  made foreign  credit
 more urgent than ever. The Czechoslovaks
 have said that they expect to discuss the
 question   of  reparations  with  the Soviet
 Union.
 OBLIGATION IS SEEN
 Pravda emphasized that all Communist,
 countries had an obligation to strengthen
 their bonds of political and economic co-
 operation "for the sake of the victory of our
 common goal."
 The paper complained that some Czecho-
 slovaks had joined a critical chorus against
 Comecon, the Soviet bloc's economy com-
 munity, and it rejected protests that trade
 within the group was "one-sided, to the ad-
 vantage of the Soviet Union."
 Raw-material imports by Czechoslovakia
 from the Soviet Union, Pravda declared, have
 been at prices favorable to Czechoslovaks.
 The Soviet Union, the paper continued,
 supplies 99.5 per cent of  Czechoslovakia's
 needs in crude oil at a price of 273 crowns
 (about $40) a ton delivered to refineries. It
 quoted Rude Pravo, the Czechoslovak party
 paper, as having estimated that oil imported
 from Iran,  for  example,  would cost the
 Czechoslovaks 408 crowns ($60) a ton.
 OTHER IMPORTS LISTED
 The paper said that the Soviet Union sup-
 plied the bulk of Czechoslovakia's other raw-
 material imports, including 83.6 per cent of
 the iron ore and 63.3 per cent of other metals,
 53.8 per cent of the cotton imports and most
 of the country's wheat imports.
 Many of the Soviet Union's exports to
 Czechoslovakia, the article declared pointed-
 ly, are scarce materials that Moscow could
 sell in hard-currency markets.
 In the  other direction,  the paper  con-
 tinued,  Czechoslovakia's  industry                                                                                                                                    benefits
 greatly from the large market afforded by the
 Soviet Union for industrial products.
 "True patriots" in Czechoslovakia under-
 stand the importance of maintaining and
 expanding economic  ties  with the Soviet
 Union, Pravda emphasized. It added:
 "Only a pitiful handful of political ignora-
 muses dream about 'broadening the scope'
 for  flirtation with imperialist monopolies,
 which seduce simpletons   with their big
 moneybags, 'fat' credits, 'advantageous deals,'
 and similar lavish promises that lead di-
 rectly to the yoke of dependence on foreign
 capital."                      -
 CZECHS' FALL CONFIRMS RED DOMINO FEARS
 (By Joseph Alsop)
 WASHINGTON.-Freedom has died in Czech-
 oslovakia, not drowned in brave and youthful
 blood as it was in Hungary, but brutally
 strangled with cold, inhuman power and
 calculation,    only  a  few  weeks  after  the
 wretched Czechs began rejoicing over their
 new birth of freedom.
 The best evidence now is that this shock-
 ing deed began to be planned from the mo-
 ment the members of the Soviet Presidium
 discovered, at the Cierna meeting, that they
 could not break the will and unity of their
 Czech colleagues. If that Is true, the soothing
 Cierna communique was mere dust thrown
 in the eyes of the Czechs and the rest of
 the world, to give the Soviet leaders time to
 decide on their next move.
 - Certainly, the Soviet armies never ceased to
 be concentrated along theCzech frontiers,

 but were instead augmented and also went
 through exercises obviously preparatory to
 Invasion. Perhaps the men In the Kremlin
 hoped, for a while, that Dubeek and the
 others would draw the correct inference and
 would move preventively to destroy their
 country's new-won freedom with their own
 hands.
 At any rate, the thing has happened. A
 civilized and ancient country, in the very
 center of Europe, is now to be held down by a
 foreign occupying army and to be ruled by
 open hirelings of its foreign masters.
 What, one wonders, will be the reaction of
 those men of the left whose indignation
 waxes so hot when it is a question of Western
 or  even  American  "imperialism"?  What
 difference will these people find, between the
 occupation of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler
 and the   occupation of Czechoslovakia by
 Leonid Brezhnev and his jolly crew?
 One can already hear the self-deluding ex-
 planations, that the Soviets have made a
 "great mistake" (such a splendid silver lining
 for the Czechs!) because of "the effect on
 world opinion" of this piece of calculated
 ruthlessness. The same damn fools said the
 same things about Hungary.
 But by their own grim standards, the
 Soviets have made no mistake at all. They
 do not parrot twaddle about the "discredited
 domino theory"  (which always makes one
 wonder just who discredited It). They knew
 that sooner or later the dominoes would
 begin tumbling in Eastern Europe if free-
 dom was permitted to be reborn there. And
 they therefore moved against the Czechs as
 they had moved against the Hungarians.
 Such are the cruel realities. The prime
 question is whether the smallest notice will
 be taken of these cruel realities in the left-
 wing academic and intellectual circles In this
 country. The left-wing academics and intel-
 lectuals have more and more wallowed in
 self-deception throughout the last seven
 years; and by their Wailowings they have
 managed to deceive millions of other rather
 more sensible people.
 Seven years Is the time-frame, because that
 Is the period that has elapsed since the
 Cuban missile crisis. President John Kennedy
 did not refer scornfully to the "discredited
 domino theory." He believed in it, as he once
 publicly testified; and for that very reason
 he risked a thermonuclear confrontation to
 get the Soviet missiles out of Cuba
 This great achievement led directly to the
 liquidation of the second Berlin crisis-that
 domino theory at work again I And these
 events produced what can only be called a
 widespread Dr. Pangloss-fIusion. All was now
 supposed to be "for the best In this best of
 all possible worlds," as the good doctor kept
 telling poor Candide.
 More specifically, the remorseless fangs of
 history were supposed to have been drawn.
 The cold war was supposed to be over. The
 Soviet Union was supposed to be rapidly
 evolving into the kind of peaceable, unmili-
 tary, genially free society in which the left-
 wing academics and their chums, the liberal
 editorial writers, could give their egos runs
 in the yard with perfect impunity.
 Well, who can believe this now? Brezhnev
 has demonstrated once again what everyone
 should have known all along-that the Sovi-
 ets never hesitate to use military force if
 they think they do so with Impunity: that
 they care not a snap of their fingers for
 "International morality" or "world opinion":
 and that they will do anything they believe
 it is safe to do to serve their own hard inter-
 ests.
 What can doubt, then, that they may one
 day support Arab genocide in Israel, which
 will give them the riches of the Middle Eaat,
 If they begin to suspect that no one will in-
 terfere? And what can more rapidly nourish
 such Soviet suspicions than the kind of col-
 lapse           of  American  resolve  that  senators
 Eugene McCarthy, Ted Kennedy and others
 are now seeking to promote?
 Sovlrr UNION'S Coup DzsPELs Lmxaar. MYTH
 (By David Lawrence)
 WASHINGTON.-The "Communist myth," so
 often brushed aside by "liberals" as imagi-
 nary. has all of a sudden become a reality.
 The argument of the "doves" that the Soviet
 Union  and  most  of  the  Communist-bloc
 states In Eastern Europe constitute no threat
 to world peace and that they should be given
 trade benefits and other Lsoncessions by the
 United States has evaporated overnight.
 The world Is back again to where it was
 more than a decade ago when the Soviet
 armies crushed an uprising of the people of
 Hungary. Then, after having connived to
 weaken the NATO alliance In Europe, the
 Soviets proceeded to build up North Viet-
 nam and finally to provoke Hanoi's aggres-
 sion against South Vietnam as a means of
 diverting American attention from Europe.
 In virtually all tree nations today a unani-
 mous  condemnation  is  being  expressed
 against the Soviet Union for Its Invasion of
 Czechoslovakia and Its attempts to suppress
 the few freedoms that have been allowed
 the people there. The hopes of the Czechs
 for a degree of independence from Soviet
 domination were abruptly shattered as the
 Soviet armies, aided by military forces of
 East Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria and Po-
 land-puppets of Moscow-crossed the Czech
 border. In the capital at Prague the leaders
 who had dared to institute reforms In the
 Communist system have been imprisoned.
 President Johnson stated the case clearly
 when he said that "a defenseless country"
 has been Invaded In order to "stamp out a
 resurgence of ordinary human freedom." He
 added:
 "Tile excuses offered by the Soviet Union
 are patently contrived. The Czechoslovakian
 government did not request Its allies to in-
 tervene In Its internal affairs. No external
 aggression threatened Czechoslovakia. The
 action of the Warsaw Pact allies is in flat vio-
 iation of the United Nations Charter."
 There are, of course. in the United States
 a few politically minded critics who immedi-
 ately cried out that Russia is merely doing
 what the United States did in Vietnam. No
 parallel, however, exists because the South
 Vietnamese government formally requested
 the help of the United States after trying in
 vain to repel by itself the Infiltration by
 the Communists from North Vietnam. The
 Moscow government makes no secret of the
 fact that within the last three years it has
 provided billions of dollars worth of mu-
 nitions and supplies to the North Vietnamese
 to carry on the aggression against South
 Vietnam.
 The case for American assistance to South
 Vietnam now will be strengthened before
 world opinion. It is clear that the Soviet gov-
 ernment does not extend military or eco-
 nomic aid and then let go of its control over
 the smaller countries. but insists instead on
 dominating their governments and denying
 them a right to rule themselves. The United
 States has explicitly stated that its objec-
 tive In South Vietnam is to assure the people
 there the right of self-determination and
 that, once this is accomplished, our troops
 will be withdrawn.
 Since the Soviet Union has a veto in the
 Security Council of the United Nations, this
 leaves the question to be handled by the
 General Assembly of the U.N., which can
 adopt a reso utloa as it did in 1956 condemn-
 Ing the-SovietUnion for "depriving Hungary
 of its liberty and independence" But it is
 doubtful that such a resolution will make
 any more impression today on Moscow than
 It did 12 years ago.
 Meanwhile, the world has been awakened
 to the amber Pact that military power ex-
 erted by the Soviets In defiance of the pro-
 visionsof the United Nations Charter can at
 any moment break the peace on every conti-
 nent. A stronger alliance of nations than
 the U.N. will have to be formed in order to
 be able to mobilize a military force of such
 strength as to command the respect of would-
 be aggressors.
 The Soviet Union has not only made a big
 error in Czechoslovakia, but It has assumed
 that the United States is powerless to draw
 together the other nations of the world to
 thwart any further extension of Soviet im-
 perialism. 'World opinion, however, can quick-
 ly be mobilized. For it now is evidant that the
 policies of the present Moscow regime are no
 different from those which prevailed under
 Khrushchev or Stalin. Me Communist drive
 for world domination still threatens the peace
 of mankind and makes a "detente" with the
 present leaders in the Kremlin a dangerous
 policy of acquiescence in Communist im-
 perialism.

 BuDAPEST, August 24.-The Hungarian press
 sharply assailed President Nicola  Ceausescu
 of Rumania today f .3r his stand In the Czech-
 oslovak crisis.
 Having withheld attack yesterday in def-
 erence to the Ruriania National Day, the .
 controlled press here accused Mr. Ceausescu
 of parroting the imperialist line on Czich-
 oslovakla.
 Magyar Memzet found it "very strange"
 that on the part of high-ranking leaders of
 Rumania, "incomprehension in the highest
 degree and even wilful misinterpretation can
 be experienced."
 The newspaper added: "There is a strrenge
 similarity between the tone and the con-
 tent of Ceausescu's speech and the phrase-3 re-
 posted a hundred times a day by Western
 radio stations."
 On Wednesday, Mr. Ceausescu called the
 Soviet-led Intervention In Czechoslovakia "a
 big mistake and a severe danger for peace
 in Europe and socialism In the world." He
 said that ,here was no justification for the
 occupation of Cze-,boslovakia and warned
 that "Intervention Into the internal afr.irs"
 of other Communist parties must end,
 reDEPENDENT SPmrT SHOWN
 For several years Rumania hag shown. an
 Increasing desire for Independence from So-
 viet direction. but Mr. Ceausescu' views this
 week  were  unprecedentedly  plainspoken.
 There was  considerable speculation about
 how the Soviet Union would react to the
 Rumanian leader's utterances.
 By degrees, Rumfnla has in fact managed
 a partial withdrawal from the hegemony of
 her  powerful neighbor.  The  clearest  and
 latest evidence was the failure of Bucharest
 to participate in the Invasion of Czecho-
 Slovakia.
 Until                   now,  the Hungarian      Communist
 party-along with fraternal parties elsewhere
 in Eastern Europe--has refrained from at-
 tacking Rumania.
 With the wraps now off, the Budapest
 newspaper Esti Hirlap, organ of ti e Budapest
 Communist Party  Committee,  joined  the
 fray. It,  too,  attacked  Mr. Ceausescu by
 name-and said Rumania should remember
 that the S~vlet Union liberated it from the
 Germans in World War II.
 SOVIET DENOUNCES CEAUSESCU
 Moscow, August 24.-The Soviet Govern-

 speeches.
 As an example of Mr. Ceausescu's alleged
 help to counter-revolutionaries, Izvestia cited
 his statement that "no one can act as an ad-
 visor or mentor on how and In what way
 socialism should be built,"

 RUMANIANS ENJOY HOLIDAY
 (By John M. Lee)
 BUCHAREST,     August 24.-Despite continu-
 ing anxiety over Czechoslovakia and possible
 repercussions for Rumania, Bucharest settled
 back today to enjoy a warm, sunny holiday
 weekend.
 Seemingly carefree crowds in sports clothes
 swarmed through the lush Cismigiu Gar-
 dens in the downtown area, packed the side-
 walk  cafes  and  outdoor  restaurants  and
 strolled down the broad tree-lined Margheru
 Boulevard, the Champs-Elysees of Bucharest.
 There were long lines for Italian movies
 and for a Tarzan picture  so old that it
 starred Johnny Weismuller. The only uni-
 forms in evidence were on traffic policemen
 and guards at Government buildings.
 Yet, transistor radios brought, newscasts
 to  restaurant  tables,  and  small  crowds
 gathered to heir the latest bulletins. Al-
 most every other person seemed to have a
 morning newspaper, turned to Czechoslovak
 developments.
 PEOPLE TALK READILY
 Rumanians talked readily to visitors and
 condemned the Soviet invasion of Czecho-
 slovakia. "It is an impossible situation," said
 a young woman student. "How do the Rus-
 sians think they can do this?"
 How did she think Rumania had escaped
 a similar repression?
 "Perhaps we  are  better diplomats,"  she
 smiled.

 BUCHAREST, August 29 -Rumanian Com-

 Czechoslovakia "in the shortest time."
 The officials also appeared to warn the

 "It is imperative that absolutely nothing
 should be undertaken that might worsen
 these relations or deepen the divergencies

 POLAND ASSAILS RUMANIA
 (By Jonathan Randal)
 WARSAW, August 29.-Poland assailed Ru-
 mania today for having placed "sovereignty
 and Independence" Above allegiance to So-
 vlet-led Communism. The criticism came in
 an article observers Interpreted as a possible
 prelude to further pressures on the Bucha-
 rest  regime  by  the  Orthodox  Communist
 nations.
 An unsigned 2,600-word article In the party
 newspaper, Trybuna Ludu,  reflecting the
 views of the Polish leadership, castigated
 Rumania for having denounced the Invasion
 of Czechoslovakia in disregard of the "su-
 preme dictate of the moment.'
 In language that recalled the strong words
 employed in the state-controlled Polish press
 against Czechoslovakia in past months, the
 article,  also  attacked  President  Nicolas
 Ceausescu of Rumania by name for the first
 time mince the invasion last week.
 Observers said that this was A practice
 normally reserved for the most serious Inter-
 party polemics.

 agency limited Its report to noting that he

 Also present  were five  other Politburo
 members, regional party lenders, Central
 Committee department directors and others
 who were described as certain ministers.
 Trybuna Lubu also criticized Rumania for
 having established diplomatic relations with
 West Germany last year and for having failed
 to break diplomatic ties with Israel after the
 war in the. Middle East in June 1987.
 Rumania is the only Eastern European
 country that has established relations with
 Bonn and the only one that did not follow
 Moscow's lead in breaking with Israel last
 year.
 The newspaper said that Rumanian sup-
 port for Czechoslovakia "Indicates that the
 objective was not 'defense of democracy and
 sovereignty' but disintegration of the so..

 (]By Stuart S. Smith)
 PRAGUE, August 30.-A Czechoslovak radio
 station transmitting from somewhere in Bo-
 hemia said today that the Warsaw powers
 are massing troops along their borders with
 Romania.
 According to  the  broadcast,  the  Soviet
 Union has moved nine military .divisions into
 Bucovina alone. Bulgaria, it said, has trans-
 ferred two divisions of troops to its frontier
 with Romania and Hungary has deployed
 three divisions along Its eastern boundary.

 In London, Joseph Luna, the Dutch For-

 PRAGUt. August 30.-The Soviet military
 commander here warned today that Russia
 will keep its tanks In the Czechoslovak capi-
 tal until the citizens remove the anti-Soviet
 slogans from the city's wall.  -
 The Czechoslovak National Front Organl-
 zation later appealed to the people to remove
 the offending placards.
 Radio Prague quoted the commander, Gen.
 Ivan Vellebkp, as saying all posters, signs
 and banners would have to be taken down
 or painted over before be would transfer his
 forces.
 DU scale POSITION
 The announcement conflicts with Alex-
 ander Dubeek'n speech Tuesday which said
 the invading military units were to be re-
 moved forthwith.
 Shortly after ]its return from his Moscow
 negotiations with the Kremlin'a top officlals,
 Mr. Dubcek, the Czechoslovak Communist
 party leader, said "we agreed" that the oc-
 cupation forces  'in the towns and villages
 will immediately depart to dsI;ignated areas.
 This is naturally connected with the extent
 to which our own Czechoslovak authorities
 will  themselves be capable  in individual
 towns of Insuring order and norma.? life."
 Except for the first few days Immediately
 following the Wrrsaw powers' attack, there
 has been no public disorder in Czechoslo-

 since the middle of last week.

 Prague,  however,  is  still  jammed  with
 Soviet military equipment, including at least
 200 battle tanks, more than that many ar-
 mored cars, numerous howitzers, one or more
 heavy molar batteries, machine gun    em-
 placements and other heavy arms.
 Although the soldiers and their weapons
 are no longer occupying the Government and
 party headquarters. they still hold mist of
 the capital's newspaper offices, radio and tele-
 vision stations, printing plants and other key
 communications points, Including the Prague
 airport.
 Many large flelds within easy firing range
 of the city's heart are full of Soviet troops,
 helicopters, military communications equip-
 ment and other paraphernalia.
 REBUKE ON INVASION
 The Czechoslovak National Front's central
 committee also rebuked the Warsaw powers,
 declaring that their invasion violated the
 "xasic nolens of International law."
 The committee a_so called upon the occupa-
 tion authorlttea to release the political pris-
 oners they have arrested during the last ten
 days and to refrain from interfering any
 longer in the nation's affairs.
 Soviet officials have demanded that what
 they call the "illegal" newspapers here stop
 publishing and that the free Czechoslovak
 radio stations be silenced.

 "We are told that the old abuses are not
 being committed," he continued. "Am I sup-
 posed to feel grateful? I don't, I see no real
 guarantees.
 "Why can't we live where we want? Why
 can't tailors spend three years in Vienna, and
 painters 30 years in Paris, and come back to
 live here without ,being regarded as crimi-
 nals?"
 He went on to speak of the effect that the
 party monopoly of power had on the country.
 "Power is a specific human condition," he
 said. "It overwhelms the rulers and the ruled
 and threatens the health of both."
 He  suggested that  the  instability  of  a
 democracy was preferable to the rigidity of
 the present system.
 CITIZEN IS RENEWED
 "There the government falls, but the citi-
 zen is renewed," he said. "On the contrary,
 where the government remains continually
 in power, the citizen falls.
 "He does not fall at the execution post.
 That happens perhaps to a few dozen or a
 few hundred only, but this is enough. For
 this is followed by the whole nation's falling
 into fear, into political apathy, into trivial
 concgrns and into a growing dependence
 on smaller and smaller masters,"
 Speaking "as a citizen of a state that I
 will not renounce, but in which I cannot live
 happily," he assailed the mediocrity to which
 life had been reduced.
 "I believe that the citizen is extinct in
 our country," he said. "We are joined by the
 most despicable of ties: a common frustra-
 tion."
 He said the system  elevated  "the most
 pedestrian types" and submerged "the com-
 plex personalities, individuals with personal
 attractiveness, and most of all those whose
 character and deeds had  become an  un-
 spoken standard of decency."
 Mr. Vaculik, who played an active role in
 the party when younger, said that the party
 did not hesitate to use threats of torture or
 blackmail as well as temptation to hold its
 followers. It appeals to the ambitious and
 the greedy, as well as to "the selfless but
 poorly informed enthusiasts of whom I am
 one."
 ANSWER: "I DON'T KNOW"
 He told the Congress that he was criti-
 cizing not Socialism but power, even though
 the organs of power tried to confuse the two.
 As to whether they could be disentangled at
 this late date, in order, as he put it, to
 "translate the dream into reality," he said
 the only answer he could give was, "I don't
 know."

 September 5, 1968       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                   S 10301
 in a statement published by the Czechoslo-
 vak news agency CTK.
 FEAR SPREAD OF DRIVE
 The statement replied to a letter from the
 Warsaw conference Sunday and Monday of
 Communist leaders from the Soviet Union,
 East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Bul-
 garia, The Russians, Germans and Poles par-
 ticularly fear the liberal ferment in Czech-
 oslovaki?a will spread to their own poten-
 tially restive people.
 The  Czechoslovak  reformist  regime  of
 Alexander Dubcek already had pledged to
 continue liberalization, saying it had full
 support of the people.
 The Warsaw letter and a further declara-
 tion by the Soviet Communist party's cen-
 tral commitee were published in the Soviet
 press today. They amounted to the strongest
 and  most  extraordinary  public  demands
 made on a Soviet ally in recent years.
 CLAIMS REJECTED
 The              Czechoslovak  presidium  called the
 party central committee to meet tomorrow
 to approve the reply to the Warsaw letter.
 The reply rejected claims by the fearful
 orthodox that the              Communist  system in
 Czechoslovakia was in danger, that the coun-
 try was preparing to change its foreign policy
 and "that there is concrete danger of sep-
 arating  our  country  from  the                        Socialist
 society."
 It expressed surprise at the criticism and
 said the Czechoslovak Communists consist-
 ently base their actions on the principles of
 Socialist internationalism, the Warsaw Pact
 alliance  and the  development  of friendly
 relations with the Soviet Union and other
 Socialist states.
 PURGE DEMANDED
 The demands by the Soviet Union and
 hard-line allies called for Dubcek to restore
 dictatorial party control, reimpose press cen-
 sorship and purge liberals from the party.
 The Warsaw letter accused the Czechoslovak
 leaders of failing to correct an "absolutely
 unacceptable" situation.
 It also vowed support for the remaining
 conservatives whom the liberals hoped to
 oust from the party central committee at
 a party congress in September.
 Neither the letter nor the resolution of
 the Soviet party, urging "a decisive strug-
 gle," said what action would be taken if the
 Dubcek  regime  did  not  give  in  to  the
 demands.
 Meanwhile, the Italian Communist party
 reaffirmed its  solidarity with the Czecho-
 slovak liberalization drive today and called
 for independence for every Communist party
 in the world.
 BACK CZECH COURSE
 The Italian Communist leadership said it
 "Is convinced that the understanding and
 fraternal and faithful support by the other
 Communist parties can make a valid con-
 tribution to the Czechoslovak Communist
 party to fight the dangers present in this
 process of renewal."
 An Italian delegation and French Com-
 munist party chief Waldeck Rochet were in
 Moscow earlier this week to urge that the
 Czechoslovaks be left alone to develop their
 own policies.
 The Prague government announced that
 Rochet will arrive tomorrow.
 Sources in Belgrade disclosed plans to
 visit Prague by both Tito, who has taken
 his country 'along an independent course
 since he broke with  Stalin in  1948,. and
 Romanian Communist leader Nicolae Ceau-
 sescu, who has been increasily defiant of
 Kremlin control.
 A public opinion poll published in Prague
 yesterday showed the people are overwhelm-
 ingly behind Dubcek;, and 91 percent of
 those queried asked that Russian troops
 withdraw as soon as possible.
 The Czechoslovak army said Soviet troops
 who stayed after the end of Warsaw Pact
 maneuvers last month were moving out "ac-
 cording  to  schedule." It said  "all  Soviet
 troops" would leave the country but gave
 no date.

 THREAT TO CZECHS MUTES LIBERALS
 (By David Lawrence)
 Paradoxes are numerous these days, but
 none is more conspicuous than the absolute
 silence about Czechoslovakia which is being
 maintanied by virtually all the groups, or-
 ganizations, college professors, liberals and
 others in America who zealously expound the
 doctrine that people have a right to deter-
 mine their own form of government.
 No such silence prevailed when Rhodesia,
 for example, tried to solve its internal prob-
 lems with respect to racial relations. In fact,
 the United  States has  joined with other
 members of the United Nations In imposing
 almost  total  sanctions  on  trade  with
 Rhodesia.
 But here is Czechoslovakia threatened by
 military intervention by the Soviet govern-
 ment if something in Me with Moscow-style
 communism is not adopted. Yet no voices are
 raised anywhere in Europe or in this coun-
 try even to express sympathy with the demo-
 cratic elements in Czechoslovakia which are
 trying to modify their form of government.
 Meanwhile, the Soviets are making military
 threats and have actually mobilized troops on
 the border of Czechoslovakia to coerce the
 latter into acceptance of Moscow's dictatorial
 policies.
 The Czech leaders are not trying to abolish
 communism, but seeking to modify it so that
 it will be more democratic. They already are
 permitting considerable freedom of speech,
 freedom of assembly, and freedom of the
 press. The Soviet government, however, ap-
 parently feels it has the right to dictate to
 the leaders in Prague what they may or may
 not do in domestic policies.
 Members of the 11-man Communist body
 ruling  Czechoslovakia are  conferring with
 top Soviet leaders who have come from Mos-
 cow to a meeting on Czech territory near the
 Soviet border. Upon thq outcome of this con-
 ference depends whether the Soviet Union
 will intervene militarily to force the present
 government to come to terms or will establish
 a new regime that will adhere to the kind of
 communism   which   the   Soviets   apply
 throughout the areas they control'. Moscow
 is being supoprted by Poland, East Germany
 and Bulgaria-over which it maintains an
 iron hand-and to a lesser extent by Hun-
 gary, which Is still occupied by Soviet troops.
 The Kremlin leaders are demanding of
 Czech officials that they turn back toward
 the Soviet kind of communism-including a
 resumption of press censorship and the sup-
 pression of all non-Communist political ac-
 tivities. Even more, the Czechs are being
 coerced into maintaining their alliance with
 the Communist-bloc nations and are being
 warned about getting too friendly with West
 Germany or other non-Communist countries.
 The threat of Soviet military intervention
 is constant.
 The crisis is bound to affect the future of
 the satellite states in Eastern Europe. Yugo-
 slavia under Tito long ago broke away from
 Soviet domination, but does have friendly
 relations with Moscow. Rumania, too, has
 in recent years asserted more and more in-
 dependence.
 It is understandable that the American
 government would, for diplomatic reasons,
 choose to be silent. Washington has kept a
 hands-off policy in the Czechoslovak con-
 troversy because of a belief that nothing
 should be done that would give Moscow a
 chance to blame Western governments for
 what is happening in Czechoslovakia.
 When the United States goes to the as-
 sistance of a country which is trying to de-
 termine its own form of government-such
 as South Vietnam-"liberals" denounce this
 as "aggression." Yet they remain silent as the
 Soviets seek to deny even to "liberal" Com-
 munists the right to set up their own system
 of government within Czechoslovakia. The
 mobilization  of  Soviet  military  forces  is
 plainly a threat of aggression against Czecho-
 slovakia, but none of the Communist par-
 ties-in France,                                                                                                                                           Italy  or this  country-is
 willing to recognize it.
 Certainly there is nothing to prevent pri-
 vate organizations and some of the articulate
 professors and scholars in America and West-
 ern Europe from condemning publicly                                                                                                                                           In
 most vehement terms the Soviet intervention
 in the internal affairs of Czechoslovakia. But
 silence seems to be the rule.
 [From the New Leader, Aug. 26, 19681
 WHY MOSCOW FEARS THE CZECHS
 (By Victor A. Velen)
 The New Course in Czechoslovakia is one
 of the most important political and social
 phenomena of the postwar period. Should
 it be repressed by Soviet intimidation  or
 armed intervention, the repercussions could
 cause a serious regression in international
 relations, Should it succeed, this union of
 democracy and socialism could become a po-
 litical model for other countries to follow, in
 the West as well as in the East.
 In the effort to explain their position to the
 Russians, the present Czech leaders have
 portrayed the New Course as a revival rather
 than a betrayal of socialism-a revolution
 aimed at transforming  an authoritarian,
 pseudo-socialist society into a humanitarian
 "socialist democracy." That the Russians have
 been incapable of grasping its real nature
 is  understandable,  since recent events  in
 Czechoslovakia represent the antithesis of
 the evolution of Soviet society. Their fear is
 also understandable, since these events call
 into question the very viability of the So-
 viet political system. For they offer proof once
 again that freedom is a basic motive in his-
 tory, that the more a society advances, the
 more imperative the need for freedom be-
 comes.
 Throughout their 20-year history, a chronic
 ailment of the so-called "peoples' democra-
 cies" has been a steadily diminishing national
 consensus. Immediately after World War II,
 power in these countries was held by a rel-
 atively large number of disciplined, idealistic
 Communists backed by the mass of the work-
 ing class and the intellectuals. The period of
 Stalinist terror, and the years of uninspiring
 collective rule, narrowed down this base of
 power to an ossified governmental bureauc-
 racy and a sterile Party apparatus. The aver-
 age citizen became alienated from public life,
 concerned only with his personal economic
 ,and political survival.
 In the past decade, however, a new po-
 litical  consciousness  has  been  awakening
 among the younger generations, who have
 begun to reject the system that raised and
 indoctrinated them. They have come to rec-
 ognize that "man does not live by bread
 alone": A comparatively secure job and an
 advanced social security system has not been
 able to replace their yearning for certain
 fundamental political ideals.
 The revolutionary rumbling in Hungary
 and Poland following Stalin's  death  were
 efforts to broaden the bases of these regimes
 by eliminating Stalinist methods and prac-
 tices. But in both cases the primary motivat-
 ing factor was nationalist sentiment in de-
 fiance of Russian domination. The common
 denominator  of  the  Hungarian  Freedom
 Fighters and the Polish reformists was that
 they were anti-Russian, and to the extent
 that they identified the Russians with so-
 cialism, also anti-socialist.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        September 5, 1968
 The historical and social premises of the
 Czech revolution are entirely different, as
 have been its results. Except for Fast Ger-
 many, Czechoslovakia Is the only country
 in Eastern Europe with an old artisan and
 Industrial-as opposed to a rural-tradition.
 It shared in the general Western European
 Enlightenment, and has had experience in
 the formation of democratic Ideas and Insti-
 tutions. That Is why, incidentally, Czecho-
 slovakia was one of the few countries in
 Eastern Europe to have a prewar Commu-
 nist party-the third strongest in the coun-
 try-represented  in  Parliament.  Thus  the
 search  for a  new  social  pattern has not
 sprung from national aspirations or hatred
 of the Russians, but from a desire to com-
 bine socialism with the older Czechoslovak
 humanitarian, democratic heritage.
 This combination is basically nothing more
 than a return to pre-Marxian socialism, usu-
 ally regarded by Communists as petit bour-
 geois and utopian. It is predicated on the be-
 lief that modern socialism can move forward
 only on the basis of the freedoms (the bour-
 geois freedoms, as Marx called them) wrung
 from the ruling classes in the course of cen-
 turies of struggle-out of which emerged the
 great principles of modern democracy that
 invest sovereignty in the people.
 These principles have surfaced spontane-
 ously in Czechoslovakia since last January,
 but naturally they will not suffice in them-
 selves. They must be anchored in Institutions
 so that no change in line can sweep them
 away administratively, as has happened In
 Poland, for example. The road traveled from
 the "Polish October" of 1956, with its af-
 firmation of free speech, to the anti-Semitic,
 fascistic campaign waged by the Polish re-
 gime in repressing the students during the
 Warsaw riots of 1968, is ample proof that to
 survive principles must be transformed Into
 legislation.
 The Czechs fully recognize this. That is
 why their first concern, after they eliminated
 the most powerful Stalinist elements in the
 highest echelons, was to establish the free-
 doms of speech and assembly as law. In place
 of Lenin's simplistic equation,  "socialism
 plus electrification equals communism." the
 Czechs have devised a more advanced and
 at the same time more ancient equation,
 which could be rendered: "Human rights
 guaranteed In a democratic state, plus sci-
 entific progress, plus socialism might at some
 future date become communism"
 The Czechs are probably the first modern
 society to transform a totalitarian state Into
 one where the citizens actively and effectively
 participate in the res publics. Translated into
 terms  of  East  European  politics,  totalt-
 tarianlam has meant the uncontested rule
 of an oligarchy-neither elected nor revoca-
 ble-which claims not only to rule in the
 name of the proletariat but also to be Its
 supreme expression. In fact, this oligarchy
 has no connection with the proletariat and
 maintains its power monopoly for the sake
 of power alone. The elevation of Marxist
 theory into a state religion-an empty con-
 glomerate of hollow phrases and formulae
 has precluded the objective analysts of real
 problems and consequently any attempt to
 solve them.
 Czech philosophers have worked for the
 past eight years to break through this totali-
 tarian vise, and the Prague spring owes much
 to their conclusions. Writing In the Italian
 Communist weekly Rinascita last June, Karel
 Kosik went to the heart of the matter: "The
 Czechoslovak events do not constitute one
 of the usual political crises, one of the usual
 economic crises, but rather a crisis In the
 ,
 underlying premises of contemporary ideas     lam had been established. He also envisaged
 on reality as a system of general manipula-   restrictions on freedom of the press as tempo-
 tion, Humanistic socialism, for whose exist-                  rary. Both of Lenin's views are now major
 ence or non-existence the struggle is taking  heresies in Soviet thinking. The distance
 place now In Czechoslovakia, is a revolution- that separates the first government dquipc
 ary and liberating alternative.   . . If the  of the Soviet Union, composed of such bril-
 Czechoslovak experiment should succeed-                              ilant Intellectuals as Bukharin, Zinoviev and
 Lunacharski  from  the  Brezhnev-Kcsygln
 team is a measure of the extent to which
 the Sovie, ruling class has been transformed
 Into  a mediocre and self-perpetuating
 bureaucracy, imp:isoned In its own rigid
 Ideological armor.
 Despite the short period of reform and
 thaw under Khrushchev, the present Rr.ssian
 leadership not only identifies increasingly
 with the Stalinist past but is also reverting
 to Stalinist practices. The repression of dis-
 sent, started with the sentencing of writers.
 Andrei Sinyavaky and Yuli Daniel, has con-
 tinued in a succession of other trials and
 condemnations designed to bring recalcitrant
 intellectuals into line. In contrast to Czecho-
 slovakia, the protests of a few intellectuals
 and students have been lost among the be-
 lieving mass.  The  sociological,  conditions
 needed to foster a widespread demani for
 democratization of the Soviet system are not
 as yet present.
 Formalized, primitive Marxism continues
 to be accepted unquestioningly, as well as
 credited with the great technological ad-
 vances                                                                                                                                    made  by  the  Russians.  Lenins'
 mummy is still the most revered ikon of
 the Russian cathedral. And the fumes of
 self adulation have not begun to clear' the
 altars. Polemicizing against the Czech phi-
 losopher  Vaclav Hencl, who affirmed that
 socialism can be divided Into authoritarian
 and democratic models, Pravda stated flatly:
 "There can be only one kind of socialism
 and that Is Soviet; socialism, which is the
 supreme form of democracy."
 So long as the present Soviet leadership
 Is in power. Russian opposition to the New
 Course In Czechoslovakia Is not likely to
 soften. Ncr is there much chance of a simi-
 lar  evolution  taking  place In  the  Soviet
 Union In the near future, for it would be
 contrary to the almost exclusively autocratic
 Russian  'aistorical  tradition.  Nevertheless,
 while the Czechoslovak experiment may not
 guarantee the jobs of the party bosses, if
 allowed to survive, It may well guarantee the
 future of rocialism.

 tions-we shall be confronted with practical
 proof that the system of general manipula-
 tion may be overcome in Its own main con-
 temporary forms:  bureaucratic Stalinism
 and capitalist democracy...."
 From January 1968 on, the Czechoslovak
 public has become aware of the beginnings of
 "participatory  democracy'".  Political  and
 special interest groups have mushroomed, the
 organizational and ideological activities of
 the Communist party have Included a greater
 percentage of its membership. At no time
 since the Russian Revolution (with the ex-
 ception of the resistance movements In World
 War II) . has a European Communist party
 known such an abrupt increase in popular
 support. According to a public opinion survey
 published In Rude Pravo on July 13, in Janu-
 ary only 17 percent of the population had
 confidence in the ability of the Party to lead
 the state; by July this figure had Increased
 to 51 percent. with 89 percent supporting
 the policies of the government.
 If widespread participation and support
 continues, the Czechoslovak experiment may
 provide a solution to crises that have plagued
 the social systems of both East and West.
 Since World War I, for example, It has be-
 come  Increasingly  evident  that  Western
 parliamentry rule is an Inadequate instru-
 ment of modern government. Indeed, the
 more a society relies on scientific solutions.
 the more "partitocracy" (to use the Italian
 expression for party rule) comes to resemble
 authoritarian rule, though still retaining its
 democratic Image In the minds of the people.
 Conceivably, the replacement of parties
 by autonomous political and economic inter-
 est groups, intellectual clubs, youth circles,
 trade unions, agricultural cooperatives, etc.,
 would constitute a permanent forum for
 national policy and planning much more
 responsive to the will of the people than the
 congresses and parliaments of the west. The
 kind of political stagnation that took place
 In Prance under the party rule of the Fourth
 Republic might no longer be possible. This
 remodeling of the political organs of, state,
 based on the direct participation of all strata
 of the population, is a modernized version of
 the principles set forth by the early humani-
 tarian  socialists  and  anarchists:  Saint-
 Simon. Fourier, Proudhon and Kropotkin.
 All speculation is idle, of course, so long
 as Czechoslovakia remains In an almost im-
 possible political situation. It Is virtually
 surrounded by hostile governments which,
 in the name of socialism, fear any form of
 revitalization based on popular expression
 and assent. The Soviet Union is far less con-
 cerned about the Independent course taken
 by Rumania, for Instance, because the au-
 thoritarian, bureaucratic structure of the
 state has so far not been challenged there.
 The possibility of direct Soviet intervention
 in Czechoslovakia now appears to depend
 largely on Russia's judgment of its feasi-
 bility. Every likely protest for intervention-
 including clumsy and obvious attempts at
 provocation-has certainly been sought. As
 the war of nerves continues, the world is
 witnessing new and unequivocal proof of
 the fundamental differences between liber-
 tarian socialism and the authoritarianism of
 the Soviet stamp.
 Although Lenin can in no sense be con-
 sidered a democrat (when Spanish Socialist
 leader Urrutia de lce Rios asked him about
 freedom In the Soviet state, he answered, "La
 Iiberte? Pour quoi faire?"), he conceived of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat Be a tem-

 4. INTELLECTUAL  FERMENT  IN             THE
 SOVIET UNION
 [From the New York Times Magazine]
 THE  NEW  TRIALS  IN RUSSIA  STIR  MEM-
 ORIES                        OF  STALIN'S DAYS:   THIS  IS THE
 WINTER 'OF               Moscow's DISSENT
 (By Patricia Blake)
 Moscow has just experienced an unusually
 fierce winter, many smaller towns were snow-
 bound, and grave concern is being expressed
 In the press about air pollution-all of which
 is very convenient for Russian intellectuals,
 who commonly characterize their conditions
 in meteorological images.
 For example, Vladimir Bukovsky, who .was
 sentenced last September to three years in
 prison for having organized a demonstration
 protesting the arrest of writers, has offered
 a comment on the miasma of intellectual
 life. In a sketch called "A Stupid Question,"
 which  appeared  before  his  arrest  in the
 underground    magazine Phoenix,  Bukovsky
 complained to a physician:    "I just can't
 stand It any longer. I tried at first to ignore
 it but I couldn't..   . I can't, you see, take
 a really deep breath.  . The doctors can't
 help me.     . But I do so want to take a
 deep breath sometimes,. you know, with all
 my  lungs-especially  in  the  spring....
 There  seems  to  be  some  obstruction to
 breathing. Qr isn't there enough air?"
 Recently, Yevgeni Yevtushenko complained
 of the same trouble.  In "Smog," a poem
 datelined Moscow-New York, published in the
 Soviet magazine Znamya in January of this
 year, he writes that he is gasping for air.
 The locale is purportedly New York, but the
 weather conditions are Russian and clearly
 recognizable as such by the Soviet reader.
 Notices have been posted in bars, the poet
 says, which read: "You can breathe easily
 only through vodka."
 Yevtushenko uses the device of putting
 words in the mouths of American writers.
 Allen Ginsberg is made to say: "Darkness is
 descending,/ darkness!/ This is the smell of
 outer hell./ There is no excuse for those/
 who can breathe in this stench! In a world
 of moral vacuum,/, in a world of fog and
 chaos/ the only halfway decent person/ is
 he who suffocates." In the same poem, Arthur
 Miller (who has publicly spoken out against
 the trials of writers in Russia) Is described
 as "stern in his terrible prophecy." Miller
 supposedly says: "There will be still more
 burnings  at  the  stake/  by  Inquisitions./
 Smog/ is the smoke of these stakes to come."
 The atmosphere Is indeed heavy with men-
 ace. Not since 1963, when Khrushchev car-
 ried on a ferocious campaign against the
 liberal intelligentsia, has creative life in Rus-
 sia seemed in such jeopardy. The two recent
 trials of writers in Moscow represent only the
 most visible surface of what is actually tak-
 ing place. The arrests of hundreds of intel-
 lectuals, for offenses ranging from the dis-
 tribution of anti-Soviet propaganda to armed
 conspiracy, and other sinister signals sug-
 gest that a policy decision has been made,
 at the highest level, to reintroduce terroristic
 methods to stifle dissent.
 These attempts at coercion have produced,
 not submission, but defiance more open and
 more widespread than at any time in the
 Soviet Union's entire history of persecution
 of intellectuals. The Communist leadership
 in Russia, and in parts of Eastern Europe as
 well, is being confronted with such spec-
 tacles as street demonstrations in Moscow,
 student riots in Warsaw and, in Prague, a
 resistance  among  intellectuals  so  massive
 that,  in   Czechoslovakia's  newly favorable
 political climate, it appears to have suc-
 ceeded in obtaining a reversal of cultural
 policy.
 The pattern of repression, as it has evolved
 under  Brezhnev  and  Kosygin,  is  not  so
 easily charted as It was under Khrushchev.
 For one thing, the style of new leadership
 in dealing with the unruly intelligentsia is
 more subdued. No longer Is the chief of state
 heard denouncing abstract painters as homo-
 sexuals who (in Khrushchev's words) use hu-
 man excrement instead of paint. There are
 no more mass meetings with writers  and
 artists In the Kremlin, no more vast cam-
 paigns in the press against internationally
 known literary figures like Voznesensky and
 Yevtushenko.
 Aims and methods have changed as well.
 Khrushchev  believed  for  a  time  that  he
 could turn the aspirations of the liberal in-
 tellectuals to his own political purposes; he
 attempted to gain their support by offering
 them a measure of freedom, but when they
 responded, not with gratitude but with ever
 greater demands, he turned on them with the
 full range of his celebrated invective. These
 repeated attempts to woo, then subdue, the
 intelligentsia produced the seasonal "thaws"
 and "freezes" that characterized cultural life
 under Khrushchev.
 In contrast, the new leaders have always
 shown a determination not to allow the in-
 telligentsia to play any sort of political role.
 Plagued with other problems inherited from
 Khrushchev, they at first seemed merely to
 be trying (with little success) to contain the
 most vociferous libertarians among the in-
 tellectuals. Now,  however, they have been
 compelled to take notice of three problems
 that have strikingly intensified in the post-
 Khrushchev era:  (1) the spread of dissent;
 (2) the breakdown of controls over the in-
 telligentsia;  (3)  the publication abroad of
 suppressed works by Russian writers, much
 of which is damaging to the prestige of the
 Soviet leadership, the system and the ide-
 ology.
 Thus, while Khrushchev relied largely, on
 bombast  and  threats  against  dissidents
 (which he was unwilling or unable to carry
 out) the present leaders have introduced the
 technique of staging political trials of in-
 tellectuals, while at the same time giving
 the K.G.B. (Committee for State Security-
 the secret police) far greater powers in deal-
 ing                                                                          with the  intelligentsia  than  at  any
 time since Stalin's death.
 The fact that this policy of selective terror
 was  applied  with increasing  intensity in
 1967, the year of the 50th anniversary of the
 Bolshevik Revolution, is a measure of the
 leadership's alarm over large-scale and un-
 restrained expressions of dissent. The crack-
 down hat, in fact, come as a surprise to
 Western observers, and to many people in
 Russian literary circles who believed that
 the Soviet leadership would make no move
 to repress the intellectuals until after the
 anniversary celebrations last November. The
 existence of dissent would be played down,
 they said; an appearance of national unity
 had to be maintained, as well as a semblance
 of solidarity mong the foreign Communist
 parties still more or less loyal to Moscow.
 The trial of the 'writers Andrei Sinyavsky and
 Yuli Daniel in 1966 had provoked such
 vehement opposition among foreign Com-
 S 10303
 munist leaders that it seemed unlikely the
 Soviet authorities would invite further em-
 barrassment along these lines.
 A number of officially inspired attempts
 were made before the anniversary to still
 the continued reverberations of that trial.
 Many newsmen in Moscow, and visitors from
 abroad, were systematically informed that
 Sinyavsky and Daniel would be released on
 the occasion of the general amnesty in No-
 vember, provided the Western press would
 stop reporting the- plight of the two writers
 and left-wing intellectuals would stop agi-
 tating about the case. "Dr. Zhivago," The
 recent writings of Alexander  Solzhenitsyn
 and other suppressed works would soon be
 published, they were told. It was even sug-
 gested that censorship was about to be abol-
 ished,  the  only  impediment                                                                                                                                         to complete
 cultural freedom in the Soviet Union being
 the meddlesomeness of foreigners.
 Nothing of the sort, of course, took place.
 Instead, the dawn of the anniversary year
 1967 was marked by the arrest of a large
 group of intellectuals in Leningrad whose
 number has been estimated at from. 150 to
 300 persons. Precautions were taken by the
 authorities to prevent this action from caus-
 ing an international sensation. The arrests
 were made among obscure persons, in a city
 where foreign journalists are not stationed.
 No mention of the arrests was made in the
 Soviet press. It is only recently, therefore,
 that  some  details  of the  Leningrad  case
 have become known.
 The roundup took place in late February
 or early March, 1967. Among those arrested
 were a number of Leningrad University pro-
 fessors, law and philosophy students at the
 university, poets, literary critics and maga-
 zine editors. At least one closed trial of four
 persons is known to have been held, and
 another is said to be in preparation now.
 Among those already tried, one is a Professor
 Ogurtsov, a specialist on Tibet at the uni-
 versity, who was condemned to 15 years at
 hard labor-the maximum sentence, short of
 death. A second, Yevgeni Vagin, an editor
 of  a multivolume edition of Dostoyevsky,
 was sentenced to 13 years.
 Those arrested were charged with conspir-
 acy to armed rebellion. It was alleged that
 they were members of a terrorist- network,
 with contacts abroad, which operated under
 the guise of various philosophical societies,
 including a "Berdyayev Circle," named after
 Nikolai Berdyayev, the Christian philosopher
 who was an opponent of the Soviet regime
 because of its suppression of freedom. Mem-
 bers of similar groups, said to be linked with
 the Leningrad organizations, have reportedly
 been arrested in Sverdlovsk and in several
 towns in the Ukraine.
 The Leningrad arrests are clearly the most
 menacing of the coercive actions against in-
 tellectuals that have been undertaken in the
 post-Khruschev period. This is the first time
 in Soviet history that intellectuals are known
 to have been arrested and tried for posses-
 sion of arms for the purpose of rebellion
 against the state. The charge is indeed so
 grave that it irresistibly raises the question
 of whether the arms case was not fabricated
 by the K.G.B, The purpose of such a provo-
 cation would be to smear the whole liberal
 intelligentsia, which, it might now be al-
 leged, is so disaffected as to be capable of
 armed rebellion-thus opening the way to
 arrests on a much larger scale. The attempt
 'by the K.G.B. to connect the Leningrad or-
 ganizations with groups in other parts of
 the country suggests that something along
 these lines Is in progress. Moreover, the pos-
 session of small arms, of which the Lenin-
 grad intellectuals are accused (in Sverdlovsk,
 they allegedly acquired machine guns)-, ap-
 pears preposterous. Under peacetime condi-
 tions it would be extremely difficult to smug-
 gle arms into the Soviet Union, and the rigid
 system of arms control in the police and

 "TENSION"
 (By John M. Lee)
 BUCHAREST, August 29-Rumanian Com-
 munist leaders declared today that they at-
 tached the "utmost importance" to the com-
 plete withdrawal of Warsaw Pact forces from
 Czechoslovakia "in the shortest time."
 The officials also appeared to warn the
 Soviet Union against further Incursions that
 might: exacerbate relations between  Com-
 munlat countries. They asserted:
 "It is Imperative that absolutely nothing
 should be undertaken that might worsen
 those relations or deepen the divergencies
 and breed fresh sources of tension."
 The firm declarations were contained In a
 statement by the Executive Commitee of the
 party's Central Committee, published in the
 party newspaper. Scintela and other papers.
 It was the first Rumanian comment on the
 Soviet-Czechoslovak agreement reached  In
 Moscow on Tuesday.
 The agreement called for the gradual with-
 drawal of forces as soon as conditions In
 Czechoslovakia are "normalized." Two dtvi-
 slone are to remain behind to help guard the
 West Berman border.
 TONE TERMED RESOLUTE
 Western diplomats were impressed by the
 resolute tone of the Rumanian comment. In
 their view, Rumania Is continuing to insist
 that each national Communist party should
 be able. to determine its own development, as
 the Rumanian party has done, free from out-
 side interference.
 The statement did nothing to yield to criti-
 ciam by the Soviet Union, Hungary and Po-
 land of Rumania's breakaway stance.
 Che Executive Committee expresses to the
 Communists of Czechoslovakia, to the Czech
 and Slovak people, its feelings of warm sym-
 pathy, of support and full Internationalist
 solidarity," the statement said.
 It recalled that Rumania had expressed
 "anxiety and disapproval" over the Invasion
 of Czechoslovakia Aug. 20. and It noted that
 the return to office of Czechoslovak lenders
 and the resumption of activity by party and
 government  bodies  "create conditions  for
 undertaking the complex tasks facing them."
 "At the same time," the statement went
 on, "the Executive Committee considers of
 utmost importance the carrying Into effect of
 the complete withdrawal, in the shortest
 time, of the armed forces of the Ave socialist
 countries from Czechoslovakia."
 POLAND ASSAILS RUMANIA
 (By Jonathan Randal)
 WARSAW, August 20.-Poland assailed Ru-
 mania -today for having placed "sovereignty
 and independence" above allegiance to So-
 viet-led Communism. The criticism came in
 an article observers interpreted Be a possible
 prelude to further pressures on the Bucha-
 rest  regime  by  the  orthodox  Communist
 nations,
 An unsigned 2,500-word article in the party
 newspaper, Trybuna Ludu,  reflecting the
 views of the Polish leadership, castigated
 Rumania for having denounced the invasion
 of Czechoslovakia in disregard of the "su-
 preme dictate of the moment."
 In language that recalled the strong words
 employed in the state-controlled Polish press
 against Czechoslovakia in past months, the
 article,  also  attacked  President  Nicolas
 Ceausescu of Rumania by name for the first
 time since the invasion last week.
 Observers said that this was a practice
 normally reserved for the most serious inter-
 party polemics.
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE       September 5,
 Also for the first time since the invasion,
 Wladyslaw t3omuika, the Polish party leader,
 consulted With members of the ruling 12-
 man  Politburo.  The  official  polish  press
 agency limited its report to noting that Ike
 had discussed "present problems of the In-
 ternational situation."
 Also  present were  Ave  other Politburo
 members,  regional party lenders, Central
 Committee department directors and others
 who were described as certain ministers.
 Trybuna Lubu also criticized Rumania for
 having established diplomatic relations with
 West Germany last year and for having failed
 to break diplomatic ties with Israel after the
 war in the Middle East in June 1687.
 Rumania Is the only Eastern  European
 country that has established relations with
 Bonn and the only one that did not follow
 Moscow's lead in breaking with Israel last
 year.
 The newspaper said that Rumanian sup-
 port for Czechoslovakia "indicates that the
 objective was not 'defense of democracy and
 sovereignty' but disintegration of the  so-.
 clallat commonwealth."

 other people of conscience and vested author-
 ity. It served to mobilize the intelligentsia
 already united by the onslaughts of 1963,
 into expressing its indignation almost with a
 single voice. It made many older intellec-
 tuals, silent until then with their fearful
 memories of Stalinism, openly commit them-
 selves to the liberal camp. And it raised the
 issue, in the most compelling public fashion,
 of the contradiction between "Socialist jus-
 tice" and brutal reality.
 The significant fact about the trial is that
 the two writers, charged with circulating
 "anti-Soviet" writings, readily admitted that
 they were the pseudonymous authors of the
 works in question, but denied that they were
 guilty of a crime. Their testimony and final
 pleas constitute a defense less of themselves
 than of literature itself, and a condemna-
 tion, in overwhelmingly eloquent terms, of
 the grossly simplistic and Philistine criteria
 applied to literature by the Soviet authorities
 for the past 30 years. Had they pleaded guilty,
 as the court evidently expected, they would
 have got off with lighter sentences. (Sinyav-
 sky was condemned to seven years of hard
 labor and Daniel to five.)
 It was clear that they wished to make ex-
 amples of themselves, so that others might
 carry on after them. This hope was com-
 pletely realized. The trial utterly failed in its
 purpose of terrorizing intellectuals. On the
 contrary, the behavior of the defendants in-
 fused the liberal  intellectuals community
 with a new sense of pride and honor. Sinyav-
 sky and Daniel had established a standard
 of conduct which henceforth others would
 strive to meet. In sum, the moral quality of
 intellectual life in Russia was immeasurably
 raised by their action.
 Not one prominent writer in Russia, ex-
 cept Mikhail Sholokhov, could be found to
 endorse the trial, while protests signed by
 hundreds of famous writers, scholars and
 scientists poured into Government agencies
 and newspapers. Opposition to the trial by
 European Communists became so strident
 that  foreign   Communist newspapers were
 banned for a time from Soviet newsstands.
 But, substituting for a free press, the for-
 eign short-wave radio stations, the Voice of
 America,  Radio  Liberty,  the  B.B.C.  and
 Deutsche Welle repeatedly beamed the trial
 transcript   (which   had  been    smuggled
 abroad) and the text of all the protests to
 their millions of listeners in Russia.
 Thus the Sinyavsky-Daniel trial boomer-
 anged by causing a national and interna-
 tional scandal, as well as by stiffening the in-
 telligentsia's resistance. In May, the Congress
 of the Stalinist-dominated Soviet Writers
 Union was boycotted by leading liberals, and
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Russia's finest living
 prose writer, addressed his now-famous letter
 to the congress demanding the abolition of
 censorship. He charged that the K.G.B. had
 confiscated his manuscripts and that the
 leadership of the Writers Union, far from de-
 fending authors from such outrages, had a
 long history of being "always first among the
 persecutors" of writers who were slandered,
 exiled, imprisoned and executed. The reaction
 of the authorities was simply to hit harder-
 in Moscow, at the heart of resistance.
 The first of the Moscow trials, in Septem-
 ber, 1967, involved three young men charged
 with organizing a demonstration on Pushkin
 Square against the arrest of some literary fig-
 ures a few days earlier. In the second trial,
 at the beginning of January, 1968, four young
 people, including two underground writers,
 Alexander  Ginzburg  and Yuri Galanskov,
 were accused of circulating an underground
 magazine, Phoenix '66.
 Galanskov  was  said  to  have  privately
 drafted a new constitution for the Soviet
 Union and distributed it among his friends.
 Ginzburg was also charged with editing and
 circulating a "White Book" on the Sinyavsky-
 Daniel case, consisting of the trial transcript,
 protests by Soviet intellectuals and a letter
 of his own to Kosygin in which he said: "I
 love my country and I do not- wish to see its
 reputation damaged by the latest uncon-
 trolled activities of the K.G.B. I love Russian
 literature and I do not wish to see two more
 of its representatives sent off to fell trees
 under police guard."
 Ginzburg was sentenced to five years and
 Galanskov to seven. The third defendant,
 who turned state's evidence, was let off with
 two years, while the fourth, who was ac-
 cused merely of typing manuscripts for the
 others, received a one-year suspended sen-
 tence.
 In these trials, the authorities made de-
 termined  efforts  to  seal  off  the  proceed-
 ings so that any resistance on the part of
 the defendants would not become public.
 Except for a handful of relatives of the ac-
 cused, the courtrooms were packed with pre-
 selected persons; who, according to one wit-
 ness, read magazines or dozed during the
 trials, rousing themselves from time to time
 to utter "animal-like hoots and cries for
 severe penalties." The September trial re-
 ceived a brief mention in a Moscow- newspa-
 per, which stated that the accused had con-
 fessed their crime.
 Thereupon, a 30-year-old physicist, Pavel
 Litvinov, the.. grandson of the late Foreign
 Minister Maxim Litvinov, saw to it that the
 actual testimony of one defendant was com-
 municated to the foreign press.
 It showed that the  defendant, the  25-
 year-old writer Vladimir Bukovsky, not only
 had pleaded not guilty but had defended
 his right to demonstrate publicly under the,
 Soviet Constitution. He protested that the
 investigation of his case had been conducted,
 not by the prosecutor's office, but by the
 K.G.B., in violation of the law. Bukovsky,
 who was sentenced to three years, ended his
 plea as follows: "I absolutely do not repent
 for organizing the demonstration. I find that
 it accomplished what it had to accomplish,
 and when I am free again, I shall again or-
 ganize demonstrations-of course, in com-
 plete observance of the law, as before."
 Litvinov further made public the record
 of his interrogation by a K,G.B. officer in
 which he defied a threat to arrest him if he
 circulated the Bukovsky transcript. After it
 was sent abroad; Litvinov told an American
 newsman that he had not been bothered
 since by the K.G.B. "When the K.G.B. sees
 that a man is not afraid of them, they do
 not call him in any more for more conversa-
 tion. When they call him again, it's for good."
 Litvinov was immediately fired from his
 teaching job.
 Ginzburg and Galanskov pleaded not guilty
 at the five-day trial in January. Said Ginz-
 burg of the contents of his White Book. "Any
 patriot is obliged to give up his life for his
 country but not to lie for it."
 News of- the defendants' resistance quickly
 leaked out to the crowd of some 200 sympa-
 thizers who gathered on the street, in freez-
 ing weather, outside the courtroom. What
 took place was tantamount to a five-day press
 conference by friends of the accused with
 foreign journalists. K.G.B. men continuously
 mingled in the crowd, taking pictures of the
 protesters. Shouted a former major general,
 Pyotr Grlgoreniro: "You can't intimidate me.
 I bled for this country!" As the defense law-
 yers filed out 9f the courtroom, they were
 given red carnations. by persons in the crowd.
 Among those who kept a vigil outside the
 courtroom were Alexander Yesenin-Volpin,
 the son of the famous poet Sergei Yesenin,
 who committed suicide in - 1926 and Pyotr
 Yakir, the son of Maj. Gen. Sooa Yakir, who
 was executed during the purges of the Red
 Army in 1937, then "posthumously rehabili-
 tated" after Stalin's death. Yakir distrib-
 uted an appeal saying that the trial "has gone
 beyond all bounds in suppressing human
 rights. Even Andrei Vyshinsky would have
 envied the organization of this trial "
 Shortly before the court sentenced the de
 fendants, Pavel Litvinov and Mrs. Yuli Dan-
 iel issued a statement to foreign journalists,
 asking that it be published and broadcast as
 soon as possible. "We are not sending this
 request to Soviet newspapers because that is
 hopeless," they said. They called the trial "a
 wild mockery of justice . . . no better than
 the celebrated trials of the nineteen-thirties,
 which involved us in so much blood that we
 still have not recovered from them." The
 judge,  they  said,  allowed  only  evidence
 "which fits in the program already prepared
 by the K.G.B."
 Following this, 12 intellectuals, including
 Litvinov, Yesenin-Volpin, Yakir and Grigo-
 renko addressed a similar statement about
 the trial to the Presidium of the conference
 of 66 Communist parties that opened at the
 end of February in Budapest for the purpose
 of strengthening their unity. One can imagine
 the reaction of the Soviet authorities on
 learning that the first news to reach the
 world of this parley consisted in front-page
 stories in The New York Times and other
 Western papers of an appeal by 12, Russian
 intellectuals  to  the  conference's  partici-
 pants "to consider fully the -perils caused
 by the trampling of man in our country."
 One consequence of the Moscow trials was
 that the convicted writers gathered support
 from persons completely outside Moscow lit-
 erary and intellectual circles, and for entirely
 extra-literary reasons. For example, among
 the signers of the appeal to the Budapest
 Conference were a former major general, the
 son of a general and the son of a Foreign
 Minister, a. leader of the  Crimean Tartar
 minority and a Russian Orthodox priest.
 From as far away as Latvia came a letter
 to Mikhail Suslov, the Politburo member and
 party ideologist, from the - chairman of  a
 model collective farm who, in 1964, had been
 highly praised in the Soviet press. This let-
 ter, which was published, not in Russia but
 in The New York Times, called on the party
 to reach an understanding with the young
 rebels, rather than put them on trial. "Such
 dissenters will," the writer predicted, "in-
 evitably create a new party. Ideas cannot be
 murdered with bullets, prison or exile." After
 describing the remoteness of the countryside
 where he lives, he said, addressing- the Cen-
 tral Committee of the party, "If information
 has reached us on the broadest scale, you
 can well imagine what kind of seeds you have
 sown throughout the country. Have the cour-
 age to correct the mistakes that you have
 made, before the workers and peasants take
 a hand in this affair."
 Protest against the trial also brought to-
 gether two formerly distinct and antithetical
 groups within the intelligentsia itself. Until
 now, only one group ?the "loyal opposition"-
 well-known published writers and respected
 scholars  and  scientists-had  publicly  ex-
 pressed                                                                                                                                      resistance,  in  relatively  moderate
 terms, against attempts at coercion by the
 authorities. Now another group, "the under-
 ground"-dissidents who despair of effecting
 change through established channels-was
 making    itself    heard  with   unprecedented
 boldness in response to the persecution of
 Ginzburg and others among their members.
 These two groups were first seen to join
 forces when 31 leading writers, scholars and
 scientists (including three members of the
 Academy - of Sciences)  addressed a protest
 against the Ginzburg trial to the Moscow
 City Court. - Later appeals by loyal opposi-
 tionists  included one signed by  80  more
 prominent intellectuals, and another signed
 by 220 top scientists and artists, from Mos-
 cow, Leningrad,  Kharkov,     Magadan and
 Dubna, the Soviet atomic center. In mid-
 Marah, 99 mathematicians, including seven
 Lenin Prize winners, rallied around Yese-
 nin-Volpin (who is- both an underground
 poet and a mathematician) in, a protest
 aginst his forcible confinement in a lunatic
 asylum after he had participated in the

 demonstration outside the courtroom at the
 Ginzburg trial.
 The central issue raised by all thew pro-
 tests (none of which was even mentioned in
 the Soviet press)  was perhaps most elo-
 quently defined by Pyotr Yakir In an appeal
 which is now being widely circulated in Mos-
 cow. "The Inhuman punishment of mem-
 bers of the Intelligentsia is a logical exten-
 sion of the atmosphere of public life In re-
 cent year," he wrote. "The process of the res-
 toration of Stalinism Is going on-slowly but
 remorselessly." "The naive hopes" encour-
 aged by de-Stalinization In 1958 and 1961
 have not been realized. On the contrary, "the
 name of Stalin is being pronounced from
 the highest platforms In an entirely positive
 context."
 Yakir, who spent 17 years in a Stalinist
 camp, deplores the fact that 10th-rate books
 praising Stalin are being published, while
 those that describe his crimes are being sup-
 pressed. His statement ends with an appeal
 to creative people in Russia to "raise your
 voices against the impending danger of new
 Stalin and Yezhovs.      . We remind you
 that people who dared to think are now lan-
 guishing in harsh forcer-labor camps. Every
 time you are silent, another stepping-stone
 is added, leading to new trial of a Daniel or a
 Ginzburg.  Little by little, with your  ac-
 quiescence, a new 1937 may tome upon us."
 Does the future hold a return to terror on
 the scale of the great purges of 1937-38?
 Clearly, the Soviet leadership finds itself in
 an impossible dilemma. On the one hand, it
 must now be clear that much larger doses of
 terror must be administered if the tntelll-
 gentala Is to be silenced, and its influence on
 public opinion curbed. One sinister omen
 was contained in an article In Pravda last
 March 3. in which the recent Moscow trials
 were said to be as justified as the purge trials
 of the thirties-trials that have scarcely been
 mentioned favorably in the Soviet press since
 Khrushchev's de-Stalinization speech in 1958.
 On the other hand, the cost of a return to
 mass police terror would be incalculably high.
 It would reverse the effect of all Soviet poli-
 cies designed to bring Russia Into competi-
 tion with the modern world, including those
 that offer individual incentives for Industrial
 production and technological and scientific
 creativity. Moreover, the internal dynamic of
 the Stalinist police state, once provided by
 the myth of Stalin and by ideology, could not
 be restored in a society now rent by skep-
 ticism and dissent. Finally, a powerful secret
 police apparatus on the Stalinist model might
 well devour the political leaders  who had
 revived It.
 How Brezhnev and Kosygin will deal with
 this critical situation is still unclear. On the
 surface it would seem that a brutal showdown
 Is at hand. Yet the Soviet leaders may be
 borne by the force of Inertia and indecision
 that has determined their handling of other
 crises, both domestic and foreign. If so, we
 may be certain that the aspirations of the
 liberal intelligentsia, rising now for more
 than a decade, will continue to confront the
 leadership In irreversible and Irremediable
 conflict.

 TExT OF ESSAY BY RUSSIAN NUCLEAR PHYSICIST
 URGING Sovrx'r-AMERICAN COOPSaATiON
 (NoTE.-Following Is the text of an essay.
 titled "Thoughts on Progress, Peaceful Co-
 existence  and  Intellectual  Freedom,"  by
 Academician  Andrei  D.  Sakharov, Soviet
 physicist, as translated by The New York
 Times from the Russian manuscript.)
 The views of the author were formed in
 the milieu of the scientific and scientific-
 technological Intelligentsia, which manifests
 much anxiety over the principles and specific
 aspects of foreign and domestic policy and
 over the future of mankind. This anxiety is
 nourished, In particular, by a realization
 that the scientific method of directing pol-
 icy, the economy, arts, education and military
 affairs still has not become a reality.
 We regard as "scientific" a method based
 on deep analysis of facts, theories and views,
 presupposing unprejudiced, unfearing open
 discussion and conclusions. The complexity
 and diversity of all the phenomena of mod-
 ern life, the great possibilities and dangers
 linked with the scientific-technical revolu-
 tion and with a number of social tendencies
 demand precisely such an approach, as has
 been acknowledged in a number of official
 statements.
 In this pamphlet, advanced for discussion
 by its readers, the author has set himself the
 goal to present, with the greatest conviction
 and frankness, two theses that are supported
 by many people in the world. The theses are:
 III
 The division of mankind threatens it with
 destruction. Civilization Is imperiled by: a
 universal  thermonuclear war, catastrophic
 hunger for most of mankind, stupefaction
 from the narcotic of "mass culture" and bu-
 reaucratized dogmatism, a spreading of mass
 myths that put entire peoples and continents
 under the power of cruel and treacherous
 demagogues, and destruction or degeneration
 from  the  unforeseeable  consequences  of
 swift changes in the conditions of life on our
 planet.
 In the face of these perils, any action in-
 creasing  the  division  of  mankind,                                                                     any
 preaching of the incompatibility of world
 Ideologies and nations Is madness and a
 crime. Only universal cooperation under con-
 ditions of Intellectual freedom and the lofty
 moral Ideals of socialism and labor, accom-
 panied by the elimination of dogmatism and
 pressures of the concealed interests of ruling
 classes, will preserve civilization.
 The reader will understand that ideologi-
 cal collaboration cannot apply to those fa-
 natical, sectarian and extremist Ideologies
 that reject all possibility of rapprochement,
 discussion and compromise, for example, the
 Ideologies of Fascist, racist, militaristic and
 Maoist demagogy.
 Millions of people throughout the world are
 striving to put an end to poverty. They de-
 spise oppression, dogmatism and demagogy
 (and their more extreme manifestations-
 racism, Fascism. Stalinism and Maoism).
 They believe in progress based on the use,
 under conditions of social justice and Intel-
 lectual freedom, of all the positive experience
 accumulated by mankind.
 The second basic thesis is that Intellec-
 tual freedom is essential to human society-
 freedom to obtain and distribute Informa-
 tion, freedom for open-minded and unfearing
 debate and freedom from pressure by ofH-
 claldoni and prejudices. Such a trinIty of
 freedom of thought is the only guarantee
 against an infection of people by mass myths,
 which, in the hands of treacherous hypo-
 crites and demagogues, can be transformed
 Into bloody dictatorship. Freedom of thought
 is the only guarantee of the feasibility of a
 scientific democratic approach to politics,
 economy and culture.
 But freedom of thought is under a triple
 threat in modern society-from the opium of
 mass culture, from cowardly, egotistic and
 narrow-minded Ideologies and from the ossi-
 fied dogmatism of a bureaucratic oligarchy
 and its favorite weapon, ideological censor-
 ship. Therefore, freedom of thought requires
 the defense of all thinking and honest people.
 This is a mission not only for the intelllgen-
 tale, but for all strata of society, particularly
 its most active and organized stratum, the
 working class. The worldwide dangers of war,
 famine, cults of personality and bureau-
 cracy-these are perils for all of mankind.
 Recognition by the -working class and the
 Intelligentsia of their common Interests has
 been a striking phenomenon of the present
 day. The most progressive, Internationalist
 and dedicated element of the intelligentsia
 is, In essence, part of the working class, and
 the most, advanced, educated, International-
 ist, and broad-minded part of the working
 class is part of the Intelligentsia.
 This position cf the intelligentsia in so-
 ciety renders senseless any loud demands
 that the intelligentsia subordinate its striv-
 ings to the will and interests of the working
 class (in the Soviet Union, Polandand other
 socialist countries). What these demands
 really mean is subordination to the will of
 the party or, even more specifically, to the
 party's central apparatus and  its  officials.
 Who will guarantee that thes-, officials al-
 ways express the genuine - interests of the
 working rlass as a whole and the genuine in-
 terests of progress rather than their own
 caste Interests?
 We will divide this pamphlet into two
 parts. Tie first we will title "Dangers," and
 the second, "The Basis of Hope."
 DANGERS
 The threat of nuclear mar
 Three technical aspects of thermonuclear
 weapons have made  thermonuclear war a
 peril to the very existence of humanity.
 These aspects are: the enormous destructive
 power of a thermonuclear explosion, the rela-
 tive   cheapness   of                                                                                                             rocket-thermonuclear
 weapons and the practical impossibility of
 an effective defense against a massive rocket-
 nuclear attack.
 [11            -
 Today one can consider a three-megaton
 nuclear Warhead as "typical" (this is some-
 where between the warhead of a Minureman
 and of a Titan II). The area of fires from the
 explosion of such a warhead Is 150 times
 greater than from the Hiroshiua bomb and
 the area of destruction is 30 times greater.
 The detonation of such a warhead over a
 city would create a 100-square-kilometer [40
 square-mile] area of total destruction and
 fire.
 Tens of millions of square meters of living
 space would be destroyed. No fewer than a
 million people would perish under the ruins
 of buildings, from fire and radiation, suffo-
 cate in the dust and smoke or ale in shelters
 buried under debris. In the event of a ground-
 level explosion, tho fallout of radioactive dust
 would create a danger of fatal exposure in an
 area of  ;ens of thousands of square kilo-
 meters.
 [21
 A few words about the cost and the possible
 number of explosion.
 After the stage of research and develop-
 ment has been pissed, mass production of
 thermonuclear weapons and carrier rockets
 Is no more complex and expensive than, for
 example, the production of military aircraft,
 which were produced by the tens of thou-
 sands during the war.
 The annual production of plutonium In
 the world now is in the tens of thousands of
 ton. If one assumes that half this output
 goes for military purposes-and that an aver-
 age of serveal kilograms of plutonium goes
 into One warhead, then enough warheads
 have already been accumulated to destroy
 mankind many times over.
 [3I
 The third aspect of thermonuclear peril
 (along with the power and cheapness of
 warheads) is what we term the practical im-
 possibllitr of preventing a massive rocket
 attack. This situation Is well known tc. spe-
 cialists. In the popular scientific literature,
 for example, one inn read this In an article
 by Richard L. Garwin and Hans A. Bathe in
 the Scientific American of March, 1968.
 The technology and tactics of attack have
 now far surpassed the technology of defense
 despite the development of highly maneu-
 verable and powerful antimisslles with nu-
 clear warheads and despite other technical
 ideas, such as the use of laser rays and so
 forth.

 Approved For          p 5 $/03RECORRD -. SENATE        September 5, 1968
 The answer would be a wide application
 of fertilizers, an improvement of irrigation
 systems, better farm technology, wider use of
 the resources of the oceans and a gradual
 perfection of the production, already techni-
 cally feasible, of synthetic foods, primarily
 amino acids. However, this is all fine for the
 rich nations. In the more backward coun-
 tries, it is apparent from an analysis of the
 situation and existing trends that an Im-
 provement cannot be achieved in the near
 future, before the expected date of tragedy,
 1945-80.
 What Is Involved is a prognosticated de-
 terioration of the average food balance in
 which localized food crises merge into a sea
 of hunger, Intolerable suffering and despera-
 tion, the grief and fury of millions of people.
 This is a tragic threat to all mankind. A
 catastrophe of such dimensions cannot but
 have profound consequences for the entire
 world and for every human being. It will pro-
 voke a wave of wars and hatred, a decline of
 standards of living throughout the world
 and will leave a tragic, cynical and anti-
 Communist  mark  on  the  life  of  future
 generations.
 The first reaction of a Philistine in hear-
 ing about the problem is that "they" are
 responsible for their plight because "they"
 reproduce so rapidly. Unquestionably, con-
 trol of the birth rate is important and the
 people, In India for example, are taking
 steps In this direction. But these steps re-
 main  largely ineffective under social  and
 economic backwardness, surviving traditions
 of large families, an absence of old-age bene-
 fits,             a high  Infant mortality  rate until,
 quite recently, and a continuing threat of
 death from starvation.
 It is apparently futile only to insist that
 the more backward countries restrict their
 birth rates. What is needed most of all in
 economic and technical assistance to these
 countries. This assistance must be of such
 scale and generosity that it Is absolutely
 Impossible before the estrangement in the
 world  and  the egotistical, narrow-minded
 approach to relations between nations and
 races is eliminated. It is impossible as long
 as the United States and the Soviet Union,
 the world's two great superpowers, look upon
 each other as rivals and opponents.
 Social factors play an Important role in
 the tragic present situation and the still
 more tragic future of the poor regions. It
 must be clearly understood that if a threat
 of hunger Is, along with a striving toward
 national Independence, the main cause of
 "agrarian" revolution, the "agrarian" revo-
 lution in itself will not eliminate the threat
 of hunger, at least not in the Immediate
 future. The threat of hunger cannot be eli-
 minated without the assistance of the de-
 veloped countries, and this requires signifi-
 cant changes in their foreign and domestic
 policies.
 Inequality of American Negroes
 At this time, the white citizens of the
 'United States are unwilling to accept even
 minimum sacrifices to eliminate the un-
 equal economic and cultural position of the
 country's black citizens, who make up 10
 per cent of the population,
 It is necessary to change the psychology
 of the American citizens so that they will
 voluntarily and generously support their
 government and worldwide efforts to change
 the economy, technology and level of living
 of billions of people. This, of course, would
 entail a serious decline in the United States
 rate of economic  growth, The Americans
 should be willing to do this solely for the
 sake of lofty and distant goals, for the sake
 of preserving civilization and mankind on
 our planet.
 Similar changes In the psychology of peo-
 ple and practical activities of governments
 must be achieved in the Soviet Union and
 other developed countries.
 In the opinion of the author, a 15-year
 tax equal to 20 per cent of national incomes
 must be imposed on developed nations. The
 imposition of such a tax would automati-
 cally lead to a significant reduction In ex-
 penciltures for weapons. Such common as-
 sistance would have an Important effect of
 stabilizing and improving the situation In
 the most  under-developed  countries,  re-
 stricting the Influence of extremists of all
 types.
 Changes in the economic situation of un-
 derdeveloped countries would solve the prob-
 lem of high birth rates with relative ease, as
 has been shown by the experience of devel-
 oped countries, without the barbaric method
 of sterilization.
 Certuln changes in the policies, viewpoints
 and trsuittions on this delicate question are
 inescapable  In the  advanced countries as
 well. Mankind can develop smoothly only if
 it looks upon itself in a demographic sense
 as a unit, a single family without divisions
 into nations other than in matters of history
 and traditions.
 Therefore, government policy, legislation
 on the family and marriage and propaganda
 should not encourage  an  increase  in  the
 birth rates of advanced countries while de-
 manding that it be curtailed In under-
 developed countries that are receiving as-
 sistance. Such a two-faced game would pro-
 duce, nothing but bitterness and national-
 Ism.
 In conclusion on that point. I want to em-
 phasize  that  the  question  of  regulating
 birth rates Is highly complex and that any
 standardized, dogmatic solution "for all time
 and all peoples" would be wrong. All the fore-
 go'ng, Incidentally, should be accepted with
 the reservation that It is somewhat of a
 simplification.         -
 Pollution of Environment
 We live in a swiftly changing world. In-
 dustrial and water-engineering projects, cut-
 ting of forests, plowing up of virgin lands,
 the use of poisonous chemicals-all this is
 changing the face of the earth, our "habitat."
 Scientific study of all the interrelation-
 ships in nature and the consequences of our
 interference clearly lag behind the changes.
 Large amounts of harmful wastes of Industry
 and transport are being dumped Into the air
 and water, including cancer-inducing sub-
 stances. Will the safe limit be passed every-
 where, as has already happened in a number
 of places?
 Carbon dioxide from the burning of coal
 is altering the heat-reflecting qualities of
 the atmosphere. Sooner or later, this will
 reach a dangerous level. But we do not know
 when. Poisonous chemicals used in agricul-
 ture are penetrating Into the body of man
 and animals directly and In more dangerous
 modified compounds, causing serious damage
 to the brain, the nervous system, blood-
 forming organs, the liver and other organs.
 Here, too, the sate limit can be easily crossed,
 but the question has not been fully studied
 and  it  is  difficult  to  control  all  these
 processes.
 The use of antibiotics in poultry raising
 has led to the development of new disease-
 causing microbes that are resistant to anti-
 biotics.
 I could also mention the problems of
 dumping detergents and radioactive wastes,
 erosion and salinization of soils, the flooding
 (f meadows, the cutting of forests on moun-
 tain slopes and in watersheds, the destruc-
 tion of birds and other useful wildlife like
 toads and frogs and many other examples of
 aerseless despoliation caused by local, tem-
 porary, bureaucratic and egotistical interest
 and  sometimes  simply  by  questions  of
 bureaucratic prestige, as In the sad fate of
 Lake Baikal.
 The problem of geohyglene (earth hygiene)
 Is highly complex and closely tied to economic
 and social problems. This problem can there-
 fore not be soled on a national and espe-
 cially rot on a local basis. The salvation of
 our environment requires that we overcome
 our divisions and the pressure of temporary,
 local Interests. Otherwise, the Soviet Union
 will poison the United States with it-. wastes
 and vice versa. At present, this is a hyper-
 bole. But with a 10 per cent annual Increase
 of wastes, the increase over 100 years will be
 20,000 times.
 Police dictatorships
 An extreme reflection of the dangers con-
 fronting modern social development is the
 growth of racism, nationalism and milita-
 rism and, in particular, the rise of demagogic,
 hypocritical and monstrously cruel dictato-
 rial poEce regimes. Foremost are the regimes
 of Stalin. Hitler and Mao Tee-tong, and a
 number of extremely reactionary regimes in
 smaller  countries,  Spain,  Portugal,  South
 Africa, Greece, A=bania. Haiti and other Latin
 American countries.
 These tragic developments have always de-
 rived from the struggle of egotistical and
 group interests, the struggle for unlimited
 power, Suppression of intellectual freedom, a
 spread of intellectually simplified, rarrow-
 minded mass m_rtbs (the myth of race, of
 land and blood, the myth about the Jewish
 danger, anti-intellectualism, the concept of
 lebensraum  In  Germany,  the myth about
 the sharpening of the class struggle and
 proletarian Infallibility bolstered by Vie cult
 of Stalin and by exaggeration of the contra-
 dictions with capitalism in the Soviet Union,
 the myth about Mao Tse-tung, extreme Chi-
 nese nationalism and the resurrection of the
 lebensraum concept, of anti-intellectualism,
 extreme antihumanism and certain preju-
 dices of ;peasant socialism In China).
 The usual practice is the use of demagogy,
 storm troopers and Red Guards In the first
 stage and terrorl&t bureaucracy with reliable
 cadres cf the type of Eichmenn, Himmler,
 Yezhov and Berta  at the summit of the
 deification of unlimited power.
 The Rule of Hitler
 The world will never forget the burning of
 books In the squares of German cities, the
 hysterical cannibalistic speeches of the Fas-
 cist "fuebrers" and their even more canni-
 balistic plans for the destruction of entire
 peoples, Including the Russians. Fascism be-
 gan a partial realization of these plans dur-
 ing the war it unleashed, annihilating pris-
 oners of war and hostages, burning villages,
 carrying out a criminal policy of genocide
 (during the war, the main blow of genocide
 was aimed at the Jews, a policy that appar-
 ently was also meant to be provocative espe-
 cially in the Ukraine and Poland).
 We shall never forget the kilometer-long
 trenches filled wlbh bodies, the gas cham-
 bers, the SS dogs, the fanatical doctors, the
 piles of women's hair, suitcases with gold
 teeth and fertilizer from the factories of
 death.
 Analyz,ng the causes of Hitler's coming to
 power, we will never forget the role of Ger-
 man and international monopolist capital.
 We also will not forget the criminally see-
 tartan and dogmatically narrow policies of
 Stalin and his associates, setting Socialists
 and Communists against one another (this
 has been well related in the famous let-
 ter to Ilya Ehrenturg by Ernst Henri).
 The Stalinist Period
 Fascism lasted 12 years in Germany. Stal-
 inism lasted twice as long in the Solve. Un-
 ion. There are many common features but
 also certain differences. Stalinism exhibited
 a much more subtle kind of hypocrisy and
 demagogy, with reliance not on an ooenly
 cannibalistic program like Hitler's but on a
 progressive, scientific and popular socialist
 ideology.
 This served as a convenient screen for de-
 ceiving the working class, for weakening the
 vigilance of the Intellectuals and other rivals
 in the straggle for power, with the treacher-

 The threat to intellectual freedom
 This is a threat to the independence and
 worth of the human personality, a threat to
 the meaning of human life.
 Nothing threatens freedom of the personal-
 ity and the meaning of life like war, poverty,
 terror. But there are also Indirect and only
 slightly more remote dangers.
 One of these is the stupefaction of man
 (the "gray mass", to use the cynical term
 of bourgeois prognosticators) by mass cul-
 ture with its intentional or commercially
 motivated lowering of Intellectual level and
 content, with Its stress on entertainment or
 utilitarianism, and with Its carefully protec-
 tive centorship.
 Another example is related to the question
 of education. A system of education under
 government  control,  separation  of  school
 and  church,  universal  free education--all
 these are great achievements of social prog-
 ress. But everything has a reverse side. In
 this case it Is excessive standardization, ex-
 tending to the teaching process itself, to the
 curriculum, especially In literature, history,
 civics,  geography,  and  to  the  system  of
 examinations.
 One cannot but see a danger in excessive
 reference to authority and in the limitation
 of discussion and Intellectual boldness at an
 age when personal convictions are beginning
 to be formed. In the old China, the system of
 examinations for  official  positions  led  to
 mental stagnation and to the canonizing of
 the  reactionary  aspects   of  Confucianism.
 It is highly undesirable to have anything
 like that In a modern society.
 Modern technology and mass psychology
 constantly suggest new possibilities of man-
 aging the norms of behavior, the strivings
 and convictions of masses of people. This
 involves not only management through in-
 formation based on the theory of advertising
 and mass psychology, but also more technical
 methods that are widely discussed in the
 press abroad. Examples are biochemical con-
 trol of the birth rate, biochemical control of
 psychic processes and electronic control of
 such processes.
 Warns on Experiments
 It seems to me that we cannot completely
 ignore these new methods or prohibit the
 progress of science and technology, but we
 must be clearly aware of the awesome dangers
 to basic human values and to the meaning
 of life that may be concealed in the misuse
 of technical and biochemical methods and
 the methods of mass psychology.
 Man must not be turned into a chicken or
 a rat as in the well known experiments In
 which elation is induced electrically through
 electrodes inserted Into the brain. Related to
 this is the question of the ever Increasing
 use of tranquillizers and antidepressants,
 legal and illegal narcotics, and so forth.
 We also must not forget the very real dan-
 ger mentioned by Norbert Wiener In his book
 "Cybernetics,"  namely  the  absence  In
 cybernetic machines of stable human norms
 of behavior. The tempting, unprecedented
 power that mankind, or, even worse, a par-
 ticular group in a divided mankind, may
 derive from the wise counsels of its future
 intellectual aides, the artificial "thinking"
 automata, may be, as Wiener warned, become
 a fatal trap; the counsels may turn out to be
 incredibly insidious and, instead of pursuing
 Let us now return to the dangers of today,
 to the need for Intellectual freedom, which
 will enable the public at large and the in-
 telligentsia to control and asses all acts,
 designs and decisions of the ruling group.
 Marx and Lenin Quoted
 Marx once wrote that the Illusion that the
 "bosses know everything best" and "only the
 higher circles familiar with the official nature
 of things can pass judgment" was held by
 officials who equate the public weal with
 governmental authority.
 Both Marx and Lenin always stressed the
 viciousness of a bureaucratic system as the
 opposite of a democratic system. Lenin used
 to say that every cook should learn how to
 govern. Now the diversity and complexity of
 social  phenomena and the dangers facing
 mankind have become Immeasurably greater;
 and It is therefore all the more important
 that mankind be protected against the dan-
 ger of dogmatic and voluntaristic errors,
 which   are  inevitable  when  decisions  are
 reached In a closed circle of secret advisers
 or shadow cabinets.
 it is no wonder that the problem of cen-
 sorship (in the broadest sense of the word)
 has been one of the central issues in the
 ideological struggle of the last few years.
 Here is what a progressive American sociolo-
 gist, Lewis A. Coser, has to say on this point:
 "It would be absurd to attribute the alien-
 ation of many avant-garde authors solely to
 the battle with the censors, yet one may well
 maintain that those battles contributed In
 no mean measure to such alienation. To these
 authors. the censor came to be the very sym-
 bol of the Pblilistinism, hypocrisy and mean-
 ness of bourgeois society.
 "Many an author who was Initially apo-
 litical was drawn to the political left in the
 United States because the left was in the
 forefront of the battle against censorship.
 The close alliance of avant-garde art with
 avant-garde political and social radicalism
 can be accounted for, at least In part, by the
 fact that they came to be merged in the
 mind of many as a single battle for freedom
 against all repression"  (I quote from an
 article by Igor Son, published In Novy Mir
 In January, 1968).
 We are all familiar with the passionate
 and closely argued appeal against censorship
 by the outstanding Soviet writer A. Solz-
 henitsyn. He as well as G. Vladimov, G. Svtr-
 sky and other writers who have spoken out
 on the subject have clearly shown how in-
 competent censorship destroys the living
 soul of Soviet literature; but the same ap-
 plies. of course, to all other manifestations
 of social thought, causing stagnation and
 dullness  and  preventing fresh  and deep
 ideas.
 Such Ideas, after all, can arise only In
 discussion, In the face of objections, only If
 there Is a potential possibility of expressing
 not only true, but also dubious ideas. This
 was clear to the philosophers of anclen:
 Greece and hardly anyone nowadays would
 have any doubts on that score. But after 50
 years of complete domination over the minds
 of an entire nation, our leaders seem to fear
 even allusions to such a discussion.
 At this point we must touch on some dis-
 graceful tendencies that have become evi-
 dent In the last few years. We will cite only
 a few Isolated examples without trying to
 create a whole picture. The crippling censor-
 ship of Soviet artistic and political literature
 has again been Intensified. Dozens of bril-
 liant writings cannot see the light of day.
 They include some of the best of Solzhenit-
 syn's works, executed with great artistic and
 objectives, may

 decree included literary protests among acts
 punishable under Article 190. which  deals
 with fai'ure to report crimes.]
 Literary 'T'rials Assailed
 The  Daniel-Sinyavsky  trial; which    has
 been condemned by the progressive public
 in the Soviet Union and abroad (from Louis
 Aragon to Graham Greene)  and has com-
 promised the Communist system, has still not
 been reviewed. The two writers languish in
 a camp with a i tract regime and are being
 subjected (especially Daniel) to harsh humi-
 liations and ordeals.
 Most political prisoners are now kepi In a
 group o' camps in the Mordvinian Republic,
 where the total number of prisoners, includ-
 ing criminals, is about 50,000. According to
 available information, the regime has become
 increasingly severe In these camps, with per-
 sonnel left over from Stalinist times playing
 an increasing _role. It should be said  in all
 fairness  that' a certain  Improvement has
 been noted very recently; it is to be hoped
 that this turn of events will continue.
 The restoration of Leninist principles of
 public control over places of Imprisonment
 would undoubtedly be a healthy develop-
 ment. Equally important would be a com-
 plete amnesty of political prisoners, and not
 just the recent limited amnesty, which was
 proclaimed on the 50th anniversary of the
 October Revolution as a result of a tempo-
 rary victory of rightist tendencies In our
 leadership. There should also be a review of
 all political trial; that are still raising doubts
 among the progressive public.
 Was it not disgraceful to allow the arrest.
 12-month detention without trial ar.d then
 the conviction and sentencing to terms of
 five to seven years of Ginzburg, Galanskov
 and  others  for  activities  that  actually
 amounted to a defense of civil liberties and
 (partly as an example) of Daniel and Sinyav-
 sky personally. 7'he author of these lines sent
 an appeal to the party's Central Committee
 on Feb 11, 1967, asking that the Ginzburg-
 Galanskov case be closed. He received no
 reply and no explanations on the substance
 of the case. It was only later that he heard
 that there had been an attempt (apparently
 Inspired by Semichastny, the former chair-
 man of the K.G.B.) to slander the present
 writer and several other persons on the basis
 of inspired false testimony by one of the
 accused  In  the'  Galanskov-Ginzburg  case.
 Subsequently the testimony of that person-
 Dobrovolsky-was used at the trial as evi-
 dence to show that Ginsburg and Galanskov
 had ties with a foreign anti-Soviet organiza-
 tion, which one cannot help but doubt.
 [The reference here Is to evidence given by
 Dobrovolsky In the pretrial investigation of
 the case of Vlad,mir Bukovsky, Vadin. Delone
 and Yevgeny Kushev in early 1967. Dobrovol-
 sky said there allegedly existed "a single
 anti-D)rnmunlst front ranging from Acade-
 mician; Sakharov and Leontovich to SMOG,"
 an iile[;al group of young writers and artists.]
 Persecution Is Charged
 Was it not disgraceful to permit the con-
 viction and sentencing (to three years in
 camps)  of Kha-istov and Bukovsky for par-
 ticipation in a meeting in defense of their
 comrac_es? Was it not disgraceful to allow
 persecution, In the best witchhunt tradition,

 gentsia who spoke out against the arbitrari-
 ness of judicial and psychiatric agencies, to
 attempt to form honorable people to sign
 false. bypoeriti:al "retractions," to dismiss
 and  blacklist  people,  to  deprive  young
 writers, editors and other members of the
 intelligentsia of all means of existence?
 Here Is a typical example of this kind of
 activity.
 Comrade B., a woman editor of books on
 motion  pictures,  was  summoned to  the
 party's district committee. The Srxt ques-
 tion was, Who gave you the letter in defense

 claim the role of spiritual leaders of man.                    tal, will be the decisive factors that people
 kind.
 Was it not disgraceful to have the speech
 at the Moscow party conference by the pres-
 ident of the Academy of Sciences (Mstislav
 V. Keldysh), who is evidently either too in-
 timidated or too dogmatic in his views? Is it
 not disgraceful to allow another backsliding
 into anti-Semitism  in  our  appointments
 policy (incidentally, in the highest bureau-
 cratic elite of our government, the spirit of
 anti-Semitism was never fully dispelled after
 the nineteen thirties).
 Was it not disgraceful to continue to re-
 strict the civil rights of the Crimean Tatars,
 who lost about 46 per cent of their numbers
 (mainly children and     old people)  in the
 Stalinist repressions? Nationality problems
 will continue to be a reason for unrest and
 dissatisfaction  unless  all  departures from
 Leninist principles are acknowledged and
 analyzed and firm steps are taken to correct
 mistakes.
 Is it not highly disgraceful and dangerous
 to  make   increasingly  frequent  attempts,
 either   directly   or   indirectly (through
 silence), to publicly rehabilitate Stalin, his
 associates and his policy, his pseudosocialism
 of terroristic bureaucracy, a socialism of hy-
 procrisy and ostentatious growth that was at
 best a quantitative and one-sided growth in-
 volving the loss of many qualitative features?
 (This is a reference to the 1l`asic tendencies
 and  consequences  of  Stalin's  policy,  or
 Stalinism, rather than a comprehensive as-
 sessment of the entire diversified situation in
 a huge country with 200 million people.)
 Although all these disgraceful phenomena
 are still far from the monstrous scale of the
 crimes of Stalinism and rather resemble in
 scope the sadly famous McCarthyism of the
 cold war era, the Soviet public cannot-but be
 highly disturbed and indignant and display
 vigilance even in the face of insignificant
 manifestations  of  neo-Stalinism  in  our
 country.
 EFFECT ON OTHER PARTIES
 We are convinced that the world's Com-
 munists  will                         also view  negatively  any
 attempts to revive Stalinism in our country,
 which would, after all, be an awful blow to
 the attractive  force of    Communist ideas
 throughout the world.
 Today the key to a progressive restructur-
 ing of the system of government in the in-
 terests of mankind lies in intellectual free-
 dom. This has been understood, in particular,
 by the Czechaslovaks and there can be no
 doubt that we should support their bold
 initiative, which is so valuable for the future
 of socialism and all mankind. That support
 should be political and, in the early stages,
 include increased economic aid.
 The    situation    involving    censorship
 (Glavlit) in our country is such that it can
 Hardly be corrected for any length of time
 simply by "liberalized" directives. Major or-
 ganizational and legislative measures are re-
 quired, for example, adoption of a special law
 on press and information that would clearly
 and convincingly define what can and what
 cannot be printed and would place the re-
 sponsibility on competent people who would
 be under public control. It is essential that
 the exchange of information on an interna-
 tional scale (press, tourism and so forth) be
 expanded in every way, that we get to know
 ourselves better, that we not try to save on
 sociological, political and economic research
 and surveys, which should be conducted not
 only according to government-controlled pro-
 grams (otherwise we might be tempted to
 avoid "unpleasant" subjects and questions).
 will bear in mind when comparing socialism
 and capitalism, or whether people will re-
 member mainly the limitations of intellectu-
 al freedom under socialism or, even worse,
 the fascistic regime of the cult [of. person-
 ality.]
 I am placing the accent on the moral as-
 pect because, when it comes to achieving a
 high- productivity of social labor or devel-
 oping all productive forces or insuring a high
 standard of living for most of the popula-
 tion, capitalism and socialism seem to have
 "played to a tie." Let us examine this ques-
 tion in detail.
 The United States-Soviet Ski Race
 Imagine two skiers racing through deep
 snow. At the start of the race, one of them,
 in striped jacket, was many kilometers ahead,
 but now the skier in the red jacket is catch-
 ing up to the leader. What can we say about
 their relative strength? Not very much, since
 each skier is racing under different condi-
 tions. The striped one broke the snow, and
 the red one did not have to. (The reader will
 understand that this ski race symbolizes the
 burden of research and development costs
 that the country leading in technology has
 to bear.) All one can say about the race is
 that there is not much difference in strength
 between the two skiers.
 The parable does not, of course, reflect the
 whole complexity of comparing economic and
 technological progress in the United States
 and the Soviet Union, the relative vitality of
 RRS and AME (Russian Revolutionary Sweep
 and American Efficiency.)
 We cannot forget that during much of the
 period in question the Soviet Union waged
 a hard war and then healed its wounds; we
 cannot forget that some absurdities in our
 development were not an inherent aspect of
 the socialist course of development, but a
 tragic accident, a serious, though not in-
 evitable, disease.
 On the other hand, any comparison must
 take account of the fact that we are now
 catching up with the United States only in
 some of the old, traditional industries, which
 are no longer as important as they used to be
 for the United States (for example, coal and
 steel). In some of the newer fields, for ex-
 ample, automation, computers, petrochemi-
 cals and especially in industrial research and
 development, we are not only lagging behind
 but are also growing more slowly, so that a
 complete victory of our economy in the next
 few decades is unlikely.
 It must also be borne in mind that our
 nation' is endowed with vast natural re-
 sources, from fertile black earth to coal and
 forest, from oil to manganese and diamonds.

 the socialist course, which has done a great
 deal for the people materially, culturally and
 socially and, like no other system, has glori-
 fied the moral significance of labor.
 2. There are no grounds for asserting, as
 is often done in the dogmatic vein, that the
 capitalist mode of production leads the econ-
 omy into a blind alley or that it is obviously
 inferior to the socialist mode in labor pro-
 ductivity, and there are certainly no grounds
 for. asserting that capitalism always leads to
 absolute  impoverishment  of  the  working
 class.
 Progress by Capitalism
 The continuing economic progress being
 achieved under capitalism should be a fact
 of great theoretical significance for any non-
 dogmatic Marxist. It is precisely this fact
 that lies at the basis of peaceful coexistence
 and it suggests, in principle, that if capital-
 ism ever runs into an economic blind alley
 it- will not necessarily have to leap into a
 desperate military adventure. Both capital-
 ism and socialism are capable of long-term
 development,  borrowing  positive  elements
 from each other and actually coming closer
 to  each  other in  a number   of  essential
 aspects.
 I can just hear the outcries about revision-
 ism and blunting of the class approach to
 this issue; I can just see the smirks about
 political naivete and immaturity. But the
 facts suggest that there is real economic
 progress in the United States and other capi-
 talist countries, that the capitalists are ac-
 tually using the social principles of socialism,
 and that there has been real improvement of
 the position of the working people. More
 important, the facts suggest that on any
 other course except ever-increasing coexist-
 ence and collaboration between the two sys-
 tems  and the two superpowers,  with  a
 smoothing of contradictions and with mu-
 tual assistance, on any other course annihila-
 tion awaits mankind. There is no other way
 out.
 Two Systems Compared
 We will now compare the distribution of
 personal income and consumption for vari-
 ous social groups in the United States and
 the Soviet Union. Our propaganda materials
 usually assert that there is crying inequality
 in the United States, while the Soviet Union
 has something entirely just, entirely in the
 interests  of the working people.  Actually
 both statements contain halftruths and a
 fair amount of hypocritical evasion.
 I  have no intention of minimizing the
 tragic aspects of the poverty, lack of rights
 and humiliation of the 22 million American
 Negroes. But we must clearly understand
 that this problem is not primarily a class
 problem, but a racial problem, involving the
 racism and egotism of white workers, and
 that the ruling group in the United States
 is interested in solving this problem. To be
 sure the government has not been as active
 as it should be; this may be related to fears
 of an electoral character and to fears of

 history," about which Friedrich Engels wrote
 so well in his famous letter to V. Zasulich,
 the "irony" that took the form of Stalinism
 in our country.
 There are, of course, situations where rev-
 olution is the only way out. This applies
 especially to national uprisings. But that is
 not the case in the United States and other
 developed capitalist countries, as suggested,
 incidentally, in the programs of the Com-
 munist parties of these countries.
 As far as our country is concerned, here,
 too, we should avoid painting an idyllic pic-
 ture. There Is still great inequality in prop-
 erty between the city and the countryside,
 especially in rural areas that lack a trans-
 port outlet to the private market or do not
 produce any goods In demand In private
 trade. There are great differences between
 cities with some of the new, privileged In-
 dustries and those with older, antiquated In-
 dustries. As a result 40 percent of the Soviet
 population is in difficult economic circum-
 stances. In the United States about 25 per-
 cent of the population is on the verge of
 poverty. On the other hand the 5 percent
 of the Soviet population that belong to the
 managerial group Is as privileged as its coun-
 terpart in the United States.
 The Managerial Group
 The development of modern society in both
 the Soviet Union and the United States is
 now following the same course of increasing
 complexity of structure and of industrial
 management, giving rise In both countries to
 managerial groups that are similar in social
 character.
 We must therefore acknowledge that there
 is no qualitative difference in the structure
 of society of the two countries in terms of
 distribution of consumption. Unfortunately,
 the effectiveness of the managerial group in
 the Soviet Union (and, to a lesser extent, in
 the United States) is measured not only in
 purely economic or productive terms. This
 group also performs a concealed protective
 function that is rewarded in the sphere of
 consumption by concealed privileges.
 Few people are aware of the practice under
 Stalin of paying salaries in sealed envelopes,
 of the constantly recurring concealed distri-
 bution of scarce foods and goods for various
 services, privileges in vacation resorts, and
 so forth.
 I want to emphasize that I am not opposed
 to the socialist principle of payment based
 on the amount and quality of labor. Rela-
 tively higher wages for better administrators,
 for highly skilled workers, teachers and phy-
 sicians, for workers in dangerous or harmful
 occupations, for workers in science, culture
 and the arts, all of whom account for a
 relatively small part of the total wage bill,
 do not threaten society if they are not ac-
 companied by concealed privileges. more-
 over, higher wages benefit society if they are
 deserved.
 The point is that every wasted minute of
 a leading administrator represents a major
 material loss for the economy and every
 wasted minute of a leading figure in the arts
 means a loss in the emotional, philosophical
 and artistic wealth of society. But when
 something is done in secret, the suspicion
 inevitably arises that things are not clean,
 that loyal servants of the-existing system are
 being bribed.
 It seems to me that the rational way of
 solving this touchy problem would be not
 the setting of income ceilings for party mem-
 ber sor some such measure, but simply the
 prohibition of all privileges and the estab-
 lishment of unified wage rates based on the
 social value of labor and an economic market
 approach to the wage problem.
 I consider that further advances in our
 economic reform and a greater role for eco-
 nomic and market factors accompanied by
 increased public control over the managerial
 group (which, incidentally, is also essential
 in capitalist countries)  will help eliminate
 all the roughness in our present distribution
 pattern.
 An even more important aspect of the
 economic reform for the regulation and stim-
 ulation                                                            of  production  Is  the  establish-
 ment of a correct system of market prices.
 proper allocation and rapid utilization of
 investment funds and proper use of natural
 and human resources based on appropriate
 rents In the Interest of our society.
 A number of socialist countries, Including
 the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czecho-
 slovakia are now experimenting with basic
 economic problems of the role of planning
 and of the market, government and coopera-
 tive ownership, and so forth. These experi-
 ments are of great significance.
 Rapprochement Advocated
 Summing up we now come to our basic
 conclusion about the moral and ethical char-
 acter of the advantages of the socialist course
 of development of human society. In our
 view. this does not in any way minimize the
 significance of socialism. Without socialism
 bourgeois practiclsm and the egotistical prin-
 ciple of private ownership gave rise to the
 "people of the abyss" described by Jack Lon-
 don and earlier by Engels.
 Only the competition with socialism and
 the pressure of the working class made pos-
 sible the social progress of the 20th century
 and, all the-more, will insure the now inevita-
 bls process of rapproachement of the two sys-
 tems. It took socialism to raise the meaning
 of labor to the heights of a moral feat. Before
 the advent of socialism, national egotism
 gave rise to colonial oppression, nationalism
 and racism. By now it has become clear that
 victory Is on the side of the humanistic, in-
 ternational approach,
 The capitalist world could not help giving
 birth to the socialist, but now the socialist
 world should not seek to destroy by force the
 ground from which It grew. Under the pres-
 ent conditions this would be tantamount to
 suicide of mankind. Socialism should ennoble
 that ground by Its example and other indi-
 rect forms of pressure and than merge With
 it.
 The rapproachement with the capitalist
 world should not be an unprincipled anti-
 popular plot between ruling groups, as hap-
 pened in the extreme case  of the Soviet-Nazi
 rapprochement] of 1988-40. Such a rap-
 prochement must rest not only on a social-
 ist, but on a popular democratic foundation,
 under the control of public opinion, as ex-
 pressed through publicity, elections and so
 forth.
 Such a rapprochement implies not only
 wide social reforms in the capitalist coun-
 tries, but also substantial changes In the
 structure of ownership, with a greater role
 played by government and cooperative own-
 ership, and the preservation of the basic pres-
 ent features of ownership of the means of
 production in the socialist countries.
 Our allies along this road are not only the
 working class and the progressive inteliigen-
 sia, which are Interested in peaceful coexist-
 ence and social progres and in a democratic
 peaceful transition to socialism (as reflected
 In the programs of the Communist parties
 of the developed countries), but also the re-
 formist part of the bourgeoisie, which sup-
 ports such a program of "convergence." AI-
 though I am using this term, taken from the
 Western literature, it Is clear from the fore-
 going that I have given It a socialist and
 democratic meaning.
 Typical representatives of the reformist
 bourgeoisie  are  Cyrus  Eaton.  President
 Franklin D. Roosevelt, and, especially, Presi-
 dent John F. Kennedy. Without wishing to
 cast a stone in the direction of Comrade
 N. S. Khrushchev (our high esteem of his
 services was expressed earlier), I cannot help
 recalling one of We statements, which may
 have been more typical of his entourage than
 of him personally.
 On Jvly 10, 1931, in speaking at a reception
 of specialists about his meeting with Ken-
 nedy In Vienne., Comrade Khrushchev re-
 called Kennedy's request that the Soviet
 Union, in conducting policy and making de-
 mands, consider the actual possibilities and
 the diffculties o the new Kennedy Adminis-
 tration and refrain from demanding more
 than It could grant without courting the
 danger of being defeated in elections and
 being replaced by rightist forces. At that
 time, Khrushchev did not give Kennedy's
 unprecedented request the proper attention,
 to put It mildly, and began to rail. And now,
 after the shots in Dallas. who can se.y what
 auspicious  oppcrtunities  in  world  history
 have been. If no-; destroyed, but, at any rate,
 set back because of a lack of understanding.
 Bertrand Russell once told a pea-:e con-
 gress in Moscow that "the world will to saved
 from thermonuclear annihilation if the lead-
 ers of each of the two systems prefer com-
 plete victory of the other system to a ther-
 monuclear war I am quoting from memory."
 It seems to me that such a solution would
 be acceptable to the majority of people in
 any country, WLether capitalist or socialist.
 I consider that the leaders of the capitalist
 and -socialist systems by the very nature of
 things will gradually be forced to adopt the
 point of view of the majority of mankind.
 Intellectual freedom of society will facili-
 tate and smooth the way for this trend
 toward patience, flexibility and a security
 from dogmatism, fear and adventuri3m. All
 mankind, Inducing its beat organized and
 active forces, the working class and the Intel-
 ligentsLs,  is  interested  in  freedom  and
 security.
 Four-stage plan for cooperation
 Having examined in the first part of this
 essay the development of mankind according
 to the worse alternative, leading to annihila-
 tion, we must now attempt, even schemati-
 cally, to suggest the better alternative. (The
 author concedes the primitiveness of his
 attempts at prognostication, which requires
 the joint efforts of many specialists, and
 here, even more than elsewhere, invites posi-
 tive crticism.)
 (i)
 In the first stage, a growing ideological
 struggle In the socialist countries between
 Stalinist and Maoist forces, on the one hand,
 and the realistic forces of leftist Leninist
 Communists (and leftist Westerners), on the
 other, will lead to a deep ideological split
 on an International, national and intraparty
 scale.
 In the Soviet Union and other socialist
 countries, this process Will load first to a
 multiparty system (here and there) and to
 acute ideological struggle and discussions,
 and then to the ideological victory of the
 realists, affirming the policy of increasing
 peaceful existence, strengthening democ-
 racy and expanding economic reforms (1960-
 80). The dates -efleet the most optimistic
 unrolling of events.
 The author, incidentally, is not one of
 those who consider the multiparty system to
 be an essential stage in the development of
 the socialist system or, even less, a panacea
 for all his, but he assumes that in some cases
 a multiparty system may be an Inevitable
 consequence of the course of events when
 a ruling Communist party refuses for one
 reason or another to rule by the scientific
 democratic method required by history.
 In the second stage, persistent demands
 for socis4i progress and peaceful coex'stence
 In the United States and other capitalist
 countries, and pressure exerted by the ex-
 ample of the socialist countries and by
 internal  progressive  forces  (the  working
 class ar.d the intelligentsia)  will lm vi to
 the victory of the leftist reformist wing
 of the tourgeoisie, which will begin to im-
 plement a progrem of rapprochement (con-
 vergence)                                                                                                                      with socialism, i.e.. social prog-

 ress, peaceful coexistence and collaboration
 with socialism on a world scale and changes
 in the structure of ownership. This phase
 includes an expanded role for the intelli-
 gentsia and an attack on the forces of racism
 and  militarism  (1972-85).   (The  various
 stages overlaps.)
 In the third stage, the Soviet Union and
 the United States, having overcome their
 alienation, solve the problem of saving the
 poorer half of/ the world. The above-men-
 tioned  20  per  cent  tax  on  the  national
 income of developed countries is applied.
 Gigantic fertilizer factories and irrigations
 systems using atomic power will be built
 [in the developing countries], the resources
 of the sea will be used to a vastly greater
 extent, indigenous personnel will be trained,
 and  industrialization will  be  carried out.
 Gigantic  factories  will  produce  synthetic
 amino acids, and synthesize proteins, fats
 and carbohydrates. At the same time dis-
 armament will proceed (1972-90).
 In the fourth stage, the socialist conver-
 gence  will  reduce  differences                         in  social
 structure, promote intellectual   freedom,
 science and economic progress and lead to
 creation of a world government    and      the
 smoothing of national contradictions (1980-
 2000). During this period decisive progress
 can be expected in the field of nuclear power,
 both on the basis of uranium and thorium
 and, probably, deuterium and lithium.
 Some authors consider it likely that ex-
 plosive breeding (the reproduction of active
 materials such as plutonium, uranium 233
 and tritium) may be used in subterranean
 or other enclosed explosions.
 During this period the expansion of space
 exploration will require thousands of people
 to  work  and  live  continuously  on  other
 planets and on the moon, on artificial satel-
 lites and on asteroids whose orbits will have
 been changed by nuclear explosions.
 The synthesis of materials that are super-
 conductors at room temperature may com-
 pletely  revolutionize  electrical  technology,
 cybernetics, transportation and communica-
 tions. Progress in biology (in this and subse-
 quent periods)  will make possible effective
 control and direction of all life processes
 at the levels of the cell, organism, ecology
 and  society,  from  fertility  and  aging  to
 psychic processes and heredity.
 If such an all-encompassing scientific and
 technological   revolution,   promising    un-
 counted benefits for mankind, is to be possi-
 ble and safe, it will require the greatest pos-
 sible scientific foresight and care and con-
 cern for human values of a moral, ethical
 and personal character. (I touched briefly on
 the danger of a thoughtless bureaucratic use
 of the scientific and technological revolution
 in a divided world in the section on "Dan-
 gers," but could add a great deal more.)
 Such a revolution will be possible and safe
 only  under  highly  intelligent  worldwide
 guidance.
 The foregoing program presumes:
 (a) worldwide interest in overcoming the
 present divisions;
 (b) the expectation that modifications in
 both the socialist and capitalist countries
 will tend to reduce contradictions and dif-
 ferences;
 (c) worldwide interest of the intelligentsia,
 the working class and other progressive forces
 in a scientific democratic approach to poli-
 tics, economics and culture;
 (d) the absence of unsurmountable obsta-
 cles to economic development in both world
 economic systems that might otherwise lead
 inevitably into a blind alley, despair and
 adventurism.
 Every honorable and thinking person who
 has not been poisoned by narrow-minded in-
 difference will seek to insure that future
 development will be along the lines of the
 better alternative. However only broad, open
 discussion, without the pressure of fear and
 prejudice, will help the majority to adopt
 the correct: and best course of action.
 Proposals summarized
 In conclusion, I will sum up some of the
 concrete proposals of varying degrees of im-
 portance that have been- discussed in the
 text. These proposals, addressed to the lead-
 ership of the country, do not exhaust the
 content of the article.  -
 '[1]               -
 The strategy of peaceful coexistence and
 collaboration must be deepened in every way.
 Scientific methods and principles of inter-
 national policy will have to be worked out,
 based on scientific prediction of the imme-
 diate and more distant consequences.
 [2]
 The initiative must be seized in working
 out  a broad  program of struggle  against
 hunger.
 [3]
 A law on press and information must be
 drafted, widely discussed and adopted, with
 the aim not only of  ending irresponsible
 and irrational censorship, but of encourag-
 ing self-study in our society, fearless discus-
 sion and the search for truth. The law must
 provide for the material resources of freedom
 of thought.
 [4]
 All anticonstitutional laws and decrees vio-
 lating human rights must be abrogated.
 [51
 Political prisoners must be amnestied and
 some of the recent political trials must be
 reviewed  (for example, the Daniel-Sinyav-
 sky  and                                                                             Galanskov-Ginzburg  cases) .  The
 camp regime of political prisoners must be
 promptly relaxed.
 [6]
 The exposure of Stalin must be carried
 through to the end, to the complete truth,
 and not just to the carefully weighted half-
 truth dictated by case considerations. The in-
 fluence of neo-Stalinists in our political life
 must be restricted in every way (the text
 mentioned, as an example, the case of S.
 Trapeznikow, who enjoys too much influ-
 ence).
 [7]
 The economic reform must be deepened
 in every way and the area of experimenta-
 tion expanded, with conclusions based on
 the results.
 [8]
 A law on geohygiene must be adopted after
 broad discussion, and ultimately become part
 of world efforts in this area.
 With this article the author addresses the
 leadership of our country and all its citi-
 zens as well as all people of goodwill through-
 but the world. The author is aware of the
 controversial character of many of his state-
 ments. His purpose is open, frank discussion
 under conditions of publicity.
 In conclusion a textological comment. In
 the process of discussion of previous drafts
 of this article, some incomplete and in some
 respects one-sided texts have been circulated.
 Some- of them contained certain passages
 that were inept in form and tact and were
 included through oversight. The author asks
 readers to bear this in, mind. The author is
 deeply  grateful  to readers  of  preliminary
 drafts  who  communicated     their  friendly
 comments and thus helped improve the ar-
 ticle and refine a number of basic state-
 ments.-A. Sakharov                      -

 (OUTSPOKEN SOVIET SCIENTIST: ANDREI
 DeuTRIYEvICH SAKHAROV
 In the fall of 1968, the Soviet Communist
 party newspaper, Pravda, opened its authori-
 tative pages to the views of two prominent
 nuclear physicists In a nationwide debate
 on educational reform.      -
 Academician Andrei D. Sakhnrov, then 37
 years old, and a fellow academician, Yakov
 B. Zeldovich, urged separate schools for spe-
 cially gifted children to train the future gen-
 eration or scientists at an early age.
 The authors contended that it was india-
 putable that mathematicians and physicists,
 at least, were most productive In the early
 stages of their careers and that many of'tbe
 great discoveries In those fields had been
 made by scientists aged 22 to 26.
 Dr. Sakharov, for one, was reasoning from
 personal experience, He earned his doctorate
 in physics at the age of 28, joined In making
 it major physical discovery at the age of 29
 and, at 32, was elected a member of the Acad-
 emy of Sciences, the most prestigious posi-
 tion for a Soviet scientist, having skipped the
 usual intermediate Stage of corresponding
 member.
 III recent years Dr. Sakharov (pronounced
 SAH-khah-roff) has continued to voice his
 views on public affairs. But instead of being
 ommclally sanctioned by publication in Prav-
 da. his opinions, often critical of domestic
 apd :roreign policy, were circulating In menu-
 script among friends and associates.
 His latest essay, written last month and
 now available here, outlines a plan for So-
 viet-.American cooperation and ultimate rap-
 prochement that he views as the only way
 to save mankind from thermonuclear war,
 overpopulation and famine, and pollution of
 the environment.
 MEMBER OP THE F.LrTE
 As a member of the scientific and techno-
 logical elite of Soviet society, and as a man
 with broad intellectual horizons and range
 of  Interests,  Dr.  Sakharov  has not been
 afraid to speak out, even If his views are in
 conflict with omcinl policy.
 In the spring of 1968, as the new Soviet
 leadership was preparing to convoke the 23d
 congress of the Communist party, the coun-
 try was abuzz with rumors that Mr. Khru-
 sh4hev's successors were planning to rectify
 his unqualified 1968 condemnation of Sta-
 lin's rule.
 Academician Sakharov then joined fellow
 nuclear physicists and other Intellectuals in
 a petition sent to Leonid I. Brezhnev, the new
 party chief, opposing any planned restoration
 of Stalin's status. The petitioners said the
 Soviet people "will never understand or ac-
 cept" a rehabilitation of Stalin and they
 warned of a now split In Communist ranks,
 between the Soviet party and the Commu-
 nist parties of the West, if such a step were
 taken.
 It is unclear whether the high prestige of
 the signers and their argument proved per-
 suasive, but no dramatic steps to change
 Stalin's status were taken at the congress in
 1068.
 Later that year, Dr. Sakharov again joined
 a group of petitioners, this time to object
 to a newly adopted decree that made unau-
 thorized protest demonstrations a crime.
 Entirely the product of the Soviet period,
 Andrei Dmitriyevich Sakharov was born May
 21, 1021, and was graduated from Moscow
 University during the war year of 1942. Scams
 published biographical data contain no In-
 formation about his personal life or family
 background.
 He joined the Lebedev Institute of Physics
 In Moscow, where he earned his doctorate in
 1947 while working with Dr. Igor Y. Tatum,
 a specialist in quantum mechanics who, in
 1968, became one of three Russians to share
 the Nobel Prize In Physics.
 Research by Dr. Tatum and his students led
 In 1830 to a proposal that provided the theo-
 retical basis for controlled  thermonuclear
 fusion-the  harnessing of the power of the
 hydrogen bomb for the generation of elec-
 tricity for peaceful purposes.
 The  principle, Involving the use or an
 electrical discharge in plasma (ionized gas)
 and heat containment by a magnetic field,
 furnished the basis for much subsequent con-
 trolled-fusion research. In which a break-
 through to commercial application is yet to
 be achieved.
 For their work, both Dr. Sakharov and his
 teacher were elected full members of the
 Soviet Academy of Sciences In 1963. While
 Dr. Tamm had held the- probationary cor-
 responding  membership  for  20 years,  his
 young associate moved directly Into the high-
 est level of the Soviet scientific elite.
 Since 1969, Dr. Sakharov has been associ-
 ated with Academician Mikhail A. Leontovich
 in research on the theoretical aspects of con-
 trolled fusion.
 Dr. Sakharov', work has been publicized In
 the popular literature. A book for the gen-
 eral reader by V. P. Kartsev, entitled "Stories
 About Physics." scheduled for publicatl
 in Moscow later this year, describes his d
 Ign for an "explosive-magnetic generator," a
 device that would produce electricity from
 an explosion contained by a magnetic field.
 Dr. Sakharov was probably Influenced In
 his outlook by Dr. Tamm, himself it candi-
 date and courageous scholar who has at-
 tended some of the Pugwaeh conferences on
 science and International affairs. The meet-
 ings, which brought together eciontlets of
 East and West" were named for l'ugwash,
 N.S_ a Canadian village where the first con-
 ference was sponsored by Cyrus S. Eaton, the
 Cleveland Industrialist.

 AMENDMENT NO. 941
 Mr. MUNDT (for himself, Mr. MURPHY,
 and Mr. Yomia of North Dakotii) pro-
 posed an amendment to House bill 18037,
 supra, which was ordered to be printed.
 AMENDMENT  OF INTERNAL  REV-
 ENUE CODE OF 1954, RELATING TO
 CERTAIN DEDUCTION BY FARM-
 ERS-AMENDMENT
 AMENDMENT  NO. 940
 Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I submit
 an amendment to H.R. 2767, to amend
 the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to
 allow a farms;- an amortized deduction
 from gross Income for assessments for
 depreciable property levied by soil or
 water conservation or drainage districts,
 a bill which is pending on the Senate
 calendar.
 My amendment is designed to remove
 a present Inequity in our Federal ?ncome
 tax law with respect to the tax treatment
 of insurance p_oeeeds received by farm-
 ers resulting from the destruction and
 damage of crotre by hail.
 Mr. President, the technical problem
 arises when a farmer produces crops and,
 quite often, does not sell those crops
 until the following year. When those
 crops are destroyed in the same year In
 which he sells the previous year's crop,
 under the present tax law, he is required
 to repcrt and pay tax on the insurance
 proceeds, which are a substitute for the
 income from Vie crops, and the income
 from the prea.ent year's crops to the
 same year.
 If the farmer had not been subject
 to the vicissitudes of hail, his crops would
 have been raised and he would have sold
 them In the following year. There would
 then have been no doubling up of in-
 come.
 All my amendment does Is to give the
 farmer the opportunity, where lie has
 consistently followed the practice of sell-
 ing crops produced in one year in the fol-
 lowing year, of avoiding this doubling up
 hardship.
 I trust that the Members of the Sen-
 ate will recognize this Inequity and see
 fit to agree to my amendment. I propose
 to call it up at the appropriate time.
 The  PRESIDING  OF1TClR.  The
 amendment will be received and printed,
 and will lie on the table.
