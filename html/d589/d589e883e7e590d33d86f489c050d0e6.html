 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 "A"    USSR.    USSR Int~c~~ ~ rty Da.  utc~_ cam ~I?arm C ,rsri  td t of I' ogr     Embassy
 Moscow comments on signs of a Soviet intra-party dispute on the farm
 consolidation program.  An apparent attack on Politburo member
 Khrushchev's recent article regarding consolidation of collective farm
 villages has been made by Armenian party boss Arutyunov in the Armenian
 provincial press.  Arutyunov attacked "comrades" who "tended to disorient"
 the Party on objectives of the campaign for consolidation of collective
 farms.  He asserted that the main task is consolidation of farm work,
 not consolidation of villages.  The Embassy believes that the sharp tone
 of Arutyunov's remarks reflecting on a Politburo member is  significant,
 even though it was announced in PRAVDA on the day following the appearance
 of Khrushchev's article that the article had. been published for discussion.
 (S Moscow WEEKA, 30 Max 51).  COMMENT:  The new Soviet policy on consoli-
 dation of collective farms initiated under Khrushchev after his appointment
 as Moscow party boss in December 1949 appears to be, as the Embassy sug-
 gests, a long-standing subject of disagreement at the top level of the
 Party.  Another Politburo member, Andreyev, was publicly rebuked for his
 views on the organization of collective farm work a year ago.
 "C"         German Specialists to be Recruited by t S. West German sources pre-
 dicted that there would be a new East German campaign to recruit German
 specialists for work in the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Control Commission
 allegedly instructed Herbert Warnke, Chairman of the East German Communist
 Trade Union Federation, to open the campaign both in the Soviet Zone  and
 West Germany shortly.  The specialists, including scientists, woula be
 invited to sign three-year contracts.  Contracts of many German specialists
 taken to the Soviet Union immediately after the war are expected to expire
 25X1C      this year.  Several hundred have already returned to East Germany in the    25X1C
 past six months. (U FBID ticker, 30 Mar 51),  CD ET1.
 engineers in Sov Zone factories were being asked to fill
 out personal history questionnaires.                                    dis- 25X1C
 tributign of these   es ionnaires might be pre arations for deportation
 25X1C      to the USSR.                                               German and Austrian
 scientists and technicians in the Soviet Union have revealed that many of
 them were being allowed to return home with their families at the expira-
 tion of their contract period.
 "C"          KOREA.  Moscow Press Plate Up Chinese Reactions to MacArthur Statement.
 PRAVDA's rehash of the Chinese Peace Committee's rejection of MacArthur's
 truce offer says MacArthur aroused the indignation of other peace-loving
 people as well as Chinese, and caused confusion and embarrassment among
 ruling circles in Americanized countries.  The "bourgeois press hastened
 to show that MacArthur spoke on his own without securing agreement of the   25X1A
 US Defense or State Departments."                    The PRAVDA article
 was restrained in contrast with Chinese declarations quoted. The sugges-
 tion that even Western ruling circles do not see eye to eye with MacArthur

 the belief      25X1 C
 is current in Albania that the bombing of the Soviet Legation in Tirana
 on 19 February was a ruse on the part of the Soviets to justify severe

 the Soviets nee. to j'L.S   y .auner    n merely impose more repressive
 measures would indicate that Soviet control may not be as secure as it
 has been. Underground resistance activities, therefore, appear to have
 achieved a measure of success,                                                     25X1C
 "A"         Arrest of Vice Premier Jakova Rumored.
 Albanian Premier Enver Hoxha and Vice Premier Tuk Jakova
 25X1C         are at odds and Jakova is under arrest.  It is not known whether Jakova's
 arrest on or about 12 March is connected with the attempt on the lives of
 the Soviet officials. By 5 April all Communist Party members are reportedly
 to be called to their respective Party centers to discuss the situation
 created by the bombin    of the Soviet Legation in Tirana and Jakova's ar-
 25X1A                 rest.                                          COMMENT:                             25X1X

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA,  Czechoslovak Ambassador To France Not To Return To Paris.
 The American Embassy in Praha has been reliably informed that Dr. Adolf.
 Hoffmeister, Czechoslovak Ambassador to France, will not return to Paris
 and that his family is expected to arrive in Praha shortly.  The Embassy
 adds that no information is available regarding the future status of
 Vladimir Outrata and Rudolph Bystricky, Czechoslovak Ambassadors to the
 United States and Great Britain, respectively, who were still it Praha
 during the week ending 30 March.   (C Praha 603, 30 Mar 51). COMMENT;
 The probability of a purge of the Czechoslovak diplomats who had been
 recalled to Praha during February was discussed in the O/CI Daily Digest
 of 9 Mar 51,  More recent evidence continues to support this hypothesis.

 not been substantiated.
 "Bn    YUGOSLAVIA.  Lull in Satellite Ins_ tia bated Bor .er incidents. According to
 N.Y.Times correspondent Handler, Yugoslav sources reported on 21 March that
 the Balkan Satellites have refrained from provoking any border incidents
 since the Deputy Ministers convened in Paris on 5 March.  The Yugoslavs
 believe the lull in border incidents to be a temporary move designed to
 strengthen the Soviet position at the Paris meeting.  By this tactic, it
 is believed the USSR may hope to cast doubt upon repeated border incidents
 reported by,the Yugoslav Government and thereby indirectly undermine
 Western accusations that the Soviet Satellites are rearmingillegally.  The
 Yugoslavs also believe-that there is some connection between the quiet along
 their frontiers and reported events in Albania.  The Yugoslavs fear that the
 USSR may attempt to blame Yugoslavia for reported disorders in Albania and
 use this as a pretext for armed intervention. (U NY Times, 1 Apr 51).
 COMMENT:  It is impossible to judge the accuracy of the reported Yugoslav
 statement that no frontier violations have occurred since 5 March since the
 Yugoslavs have never reported every incident as it occurred. During the
 month of March, however, both Hungary and Bulgaria have addressed notes to
 Yugoslavia charging the latter with frontier violations. The Yugoslav ac-
 count of the relaxation of pressure on their frontiers may reflect their
 apparent fear of Western intervention in Albania.

 Government while the Majlis is not in session,  The Government has been
 using martial law to round up some extreme nation.listss~  The National

 the Quirino administration, even with US guidance, is unable to cope

 general offensive within Tonkin._
 "A"          Military Engagements.  DRV (Viet Minh) forces are continuing to probe
 French defenses in the Dongtr'ieu area north northwest of Haiphong apparent-
 ly in an attempt to draw French forces into piecemeal ambushes.  The French
 refuse to be tricked and are for their part attempting to attract DRV forces
 into open areas where the French hold the advantage.  Conversations between
 Hanoi Consulate officials and. high French military officials indicate that
 some thought is being given to the possibility that current DRV action is
 designed to cover the entry of Chinese Communist "volunteers".  French
 concern in this regard has been sharpened by a marked drop in trans-border
 intelligence during the past few weeks. (S Hanoi 527,1 Apr 5l)e
 "A"          DRV  anounces "General Countar Uffensi *allo Pamphlets clandestinely
 distributed in Saigon have announced "to all; asses of the Vietnamese
 people" that "the day of the general counter-of-fensive has come."  It is
 predicted that the DRV will triumph "with the formidable forces of the
 Russian Red Army and those of new China to help us."  (C Saigon 1751,1 Apr 51).
 COMMENTs  Although this explicit statement of DRV policy appears to be authen-
 tic, so many twists have been given during the past two years by DRV propa-
 gandists to the imminence of the "general counter. offensive" that this
 pamphlet is not necessarily to be considered as representing a decisive
 change in DRV strategy.  The view that the DRV has not net decided to adopt
 formally the slogan of "general counter-offensive" is supported by the
 absence, at this writing, of any recent radio broadcast on this theme.

 (C- State Hong Kong D-1254, 6 Mar 51).  CO   NTo  Hong Kong's exports to
 China during January were 45% above the December figure and amounted to
 perhaps half of China's total imports from the West, assuming that Jan-
 uary 1951 imports from non-Communist countries remained at the high level
 of October-Decembet 1950.  Chinese Communist purchasing agents in Hong
 Kong probably have been in a better position than importers on the main-
 land to deliver rapidly many of the industrial and strategic items which
 the Communists want from the West.  Although the Communists would undoubted-
 ly prefer to reduce their dependence on Hong Kong middlemen, they are
 apparently more strongly influenced at this time by the desire to speed
 up purchases because of the fear of increasing restrictions on strategic

 source has access to detailed information on high level Sino-Soviet de-

 in recent weeks, this report, like most other recent reports of Sino-
 Soviet intentions, appears to be largely a collection of rumors  deriving
 from widespread speculation as to future Sino-Soviet moves in Korea.
 "C"  j4.  North Korean Premier Exhorts the "Sowing Front"o  Radio Pyongyang
 reports that North Korean Premier KIM I1 Sung has been touring South
 Pyongyang Province to learn first hand about spring sowing operations,
 The Premier is quoted as saying that in order to win the victory farmers
 must provide more food for the nation and troops.  "If we fail on the sow-
 ing front", the Premier warned, "it will spell out failure on the fighting
 front".  (R FBIS Ticker, 31 Mar 51).              The Premier's remarks are
 a part of the campaign to insure a good crop in 1951 and lends further
 credence to reports indicating a food shortage in North Korea..
 "C"   JAN.  Growing Ryukvuan Publicity for Return to Japan,  The Okinawan
 Assembly on 19 March 1951 voted 15 to 3 in favor of the return of the
 Ryukyus to Japan.  The People's Party at its fourth convention on 18          25X1A2
 March voted similarly.  The Council for the Return of Amami Oshima            001
 (Northern Ryukyus) to Japan is now firml  established and has been en-
 dorsed by the Communists.                                     The movement for return of the
 Ryukyus to Japan is now in full swing, although the ordinary citizens of
 central and southern Ryukyus are apathetic or divided in opinion re-
 garding their future.  The Northern Ryukyus strongly favor the return.
 The Communist championing is unfortunate. If any of the islands are
 returned, the Communists will claim credit and if they are not returned
 the Communists will succeed in planting doubt of US integrity.  (S CINCFE
 Joint Weeka 13, 31 Mar 51).  Cos  The strong feeling of the
 Ryukyuans on this issue is shared by the Japanese, who look upon the
 temporary loss of these "traditionally Japanese" islands as virtually the
 only unfavorable aspect of the US peace treaty proposals.

 other hand, feels that the Quito demonstration was probably a peace-
 ful protest by leftist organizers which got out of hand, but reports
 a similar disturbance the night before in Guayaquil which undoubtedly
 was organized-by Guevara sympathizers.  The presidential palace has
 been placed under heavy armed guard, and the streets ar
 by the military and the police,
 plan a series of minor disturbances prior to a revolutionary attempt.
 (See also OCI  Daily Digest, 12 Jan and 15 Feb 51).  An alliance
 between the fascist-inclined Carlos Guevara Moreno group and the
 Liberal-Radical Party followers of Colonel Carlos Mancheno, first
 noted in October 1950, has been strengthened in the past few months.
 (Guevara himself is still in a Quito jail for a revolutionary attempt
 last July).  Its leaders may well feel that their movement has now
 achieved its maximum potential strength and that they should make
 their all-out try soon.  They still seem too weak to be capable of
 directly effecting the overthrow of the Government.  There is, however,
 a slight chance that they might unwittingly effect a change in
 administration through a revolutionary attempt by providing the
 personally ambitious Minister of Defense with an excuse for ousting
 President Plaza and taking over with a military junta under the guise
 of "protecting" the Government.

 "A"  Gromrko Reported Anxious to Proceed With IegaLtiatiom.a.  US delegate
 Jessup reports an impression received at an informa:`i    four power
 meeting that Soviet delegate Gromyko is very anxious to have some
 Western draft agenda in writing which he could submit to Moscow.
 Jessup also reports his impression that Gromyko was instructed to
 introduce the Atlantic Treaty item when  his  28 March proposal was
 not met with a Western draft in order to counteract any impression
 of Soviet weakness and unlimited concessions.  Gronyko also mani-
 fested interest in whether the first Soviet agenda item would be
 acceptable if reworded so as to show that "German demilitarization"
 could be either a cause or an effect of present international
 tensions in Europe.  (S S/S Paris 5$39, 31 Mar 51).  At the 2 April
 meeting the Western Powers are tabling a revised version of their
 draft agenda.  (S S/S Paris 5551; 2 April 51).  CO     :  Gronyko t s
 reported attitude may be indicative of his apprehension that the  .
 Kremlin is not satisfied with either his conduct of or the progress
 of the negotiations.  This would be particularly true if Gronrko
 had entered the negotiations, four weeks ago with instructions to
 obtain an agreed agenda,-which would be of course as close to Soviet
 terms as possible,

 "B"   UNITED KINGDOM.  Foreign Office Increasingly Worried by Iranian Oil
 Crisis,  US Embassy London reports that UK Government officials are now
 genuinely alarmed over the prospects of losing British investments in
 Iran and the oil supplies which the Government considers vital to the
 British economy.  The Foreign Office sees more liberal, financial terms
 to Iran as necessary, and is pressing the Anglo-Iranian Oil. Company in
 that direction, and also recognizes that lip service at least must be
 paid to the principle of nationalization- but at the same time it thinks
 it dangerous to relinquish title to the oil properties and continues to
 believe it will be useless to enter.. into negotiations with Iran until a
 .strong government has come into power.  (See OCI Daily Digest, 29 Mar 51).
 The Foreign Office further indicated that if efforts at persuasion in
 Iran are unsuccessful, it is prepared to consider pressure, beginning with
 financial measures and going as far as to move British troops to a near-
 by base in Iraq and other military precautions if British lives were en-
 dangered by a threatened seizure of the oil properties,  US Embassy
 London feels. it significant that the Foreign Office does not discount the
 possibility of employing force.  Meanwhile; the Foreign Office is attach-
 ing great importance to the high level US-UK talks on the subject scheduled
 to begin in Washington on 9 April, and has expanded the UK delegation with
 representatives from the Treasury and the Ministry of Fuel and Power in
 an effort to emphasize the importance to Brits of Iranian oil and of US
 support on this issue.  (S SIS London 5142, 30 Mar 51).  CO* ENT:  The
 likelihood of a strong Iranian Government for the British to negotiate
 with seems no greater than a week ago.  (See OCI Daily Digest, 29 Mar 51).
 Furthermore, despite its increasing concern over the situation, the
 Foreign Office seems no closer to specific proposals to make to any
 Iranian Government.  Nor is it clear just how the British believe they
 could effectively exert pressure in the present situation,
