 During the past two years, Moscow and Peiping appear to
 have arrived at a working relationship which has been evolving
 since the establishment of the Chinese People's Republic in 1949.
 This relationship has been characterized by Soviet grants to
 Peiping of economic assistance on a modest level, but including
 high priority items, general Soviet avoidance of direct involve-
 ment in potentially explosive situations in the Far East, and a
 willingness on the part of the Soviet leaders to champion China's
 claim to great power status in international affairs.
 This relationship reflects the practical interests presently
 shared by the USSR and China--i.e., Peiping is dependent on the
 Soviet Union for the essentials of economic and military assist-
 ance necessary to build up its position as an Asian great power,
 while Moscow relies on China as the center of Communist power in
 the Far East serving to counter Western-oriented power and to
 provide uncommitted. Asians ,with an. impressive. example, of Com-
 munist economic..an.d . military;.achievement 0

 I.  POLICY TOWARD YENAN?-1945-1948
 With the defeat of Japan and the immediate resumption of
 hostilities between the Fuomintang and the Chinese Communists,
 Moscow was confronted with the necessity of working out a stand
 on the status of Mao and his party.  The Chinese Communists were
 attacking the USSR's treaty partner which Stalin had pledged at
 Yalta to recognize and aids
 The timing of the Yenan group's successes could hardly have
 been apparent in 1945, and Stalin and Molotov were content to
 follow a wait-and-see policy and pay lip service to Yalta pledges
 of support for Chiang and a "unified democratic" China.
 Dismantling in Manchuria:
 i   r
 One of the earliest examples of Moscow's postwar errors in
 its policy toward Yenan was the wholesale Soviet looting of Man-
 churian industry.  This enormous grab was evidently due to either
 a callous disregard of the potential value which an undisturbed
 industrial base in Manchuria would have for the Chinese Communists
 or on a pessimistic calculation of Yenan's chances of controlling
 that area for some: 'time '.t.o,come ,  This looting of Manchuria
 has.,beenideScribed.?by many cOmpe.tent,:W.estern.lobservers  as a big
 mistake.  The machinery reportedly was not'adaptable for use in
 the USSR.  In 1948 large quantities of it were observed rusting
 on station platforms at major towns along the Transsiberiaz
 railroad, and probably very little of it could have been econom--
 ically returned for reinstallation in its original plant.  A few
 years later, though, a few small pieces of this machinery were
 reportedly returned, in their original packing cases, as part of
 the Soviet "aid" to the new Chinese People's Republic
 Moscow's Neutrality in The Chinese Civil War:
 In 1947, the strategic initiative in the Chinese military
 conflict passed from the Nationalists to the Communists.  By
 the end of that year, Communist units were deployed in strength
 along the railroads from North China to Manchuria.  A Communist

 offensive mounted in late December succeeded in cutting all rail
 connections. into Mukden and isolating all the major Nationalist
 garrisons in Manchuria,
 Meanwhile Moscow remained neutral, dropping occasional hints
 that it would be willing to replace the US as mediator between
 Chiang and the Communists.   The Soviet officials punctiliously
 followed Chiang on his various retreats, closing consulates as
 the territories in which they were located fell under Communist
 control, and, in the end, the USSR was the only major government
 to move with the Kuomintang to Canton.
 II.   THE KREMLIN FACES A TRIUMPHANT
 CHINESE COMMUNIST REGIME--1949-1950
 By late 1948, the Chinese Communists had completed the occupa-
 tion of Manchuria.                          Tientsin fell on 15 January 1949, and by the
 end of the month Peiping surrendered without a battle.  From mid-
 September 1948 to 31 January 1949 the Nationalists were estimated
 to have lost 45 percent of their total troop strength.
 By February 1949 the Intelligence Division of the Department
 of the Army reported that events had so enhanced the position and
 capabilities of the Communists that they were then capable of
 achieving a complete military victory over the Nationalist forces.
 Western observers.  in Moscow believed that the rapid sweep
 of events in China outpaced Soviet policy.  During 1948 Moscow
 several times intimated its readiness to mediate a political
 settlement between Chiang and the Chinese Communists.   Many
 diplomatic observers felt that while these conciliatory gestures
 might have been a pure smoke screen, it was more probable that
 the Kremlin had underestimated both.Yenan?s military capacities
 and Kuomintang weaknesses and thus believed that a political
 settlement in. China would be advantageous at this time.: The
 capture of Manchuria coupled with Mao's publicly stated intran-
 sigence toward the Kuomintang probably forced the Kremlin to a
 new appraisal of the China situation.

 On 8 January 1949, Chiang asked the Big Four to mediate in
 the Chinese civil war.  Ten days later the Kremlin handed its
 refusal to the Chinese ambassador.  There is tentative evidence
 indicating that this interval was utilized for a meeting between
 Soviet and Chinese Communist leaders to determine and coordi-
 nate policies.  This meeting might have come about on the initia-
 tive of the Moscow leaders, who found it necessary to make a deci-
 sion on the expected mediation request, or on the initiative of
 Mao who feared the USSR might favorably consider such a proposal.
 As the victorious Communist armies advanced toward the Yangtze,
 editorial comment on the China situation in the Soviet press dried
 up.    To many Western obsevers in Moscow, this indicated that the
 Chinese question had become too hot for any but the highest levels
 to handle.
 In September 1949, the Chinese Communist press defended
 Stalin's partnership with Chiang in the Chinese Eastern Railway
 and Soviet joint rights in Dairen under the 1945 Stalin-Chiang
 Treaty on the grounds that they were necessary to prevent Chiang
 from giving Manchuria to the US.  According to this line the USSR
 had taken the Manchurian machinery, first because it was entitled
 to war booty, and secondly to keep the equipment out of Kuomintang
 hands. The people of "new China" were called upon not to let
 "national emotion" cause them to be victimized by anti-Soviet
 propaganda.
 Soviet sensitivity to the China problem in that period is
 suggested by the arrest and expulsion from the USSR of Anna Louise
 Strong, one of the Chinese Communists' most ardent champions and
 a leading proponent of the "Yenan way" as a new guide for Asian
 Communism'
 .  On 20 April 1949 the Chinese Communist forces crossed the
 Yangtze without effective opposition and Shanghai fell on 25 May.
 On 2 October 1949, shortly before the fall of Canton, the
 USSR broke off diplomatic relations with the Nationalist govern-
 ment and recognized the Central People's Government of the Chinese
 People's Republic.  N. V. Roshchin, first Soviet ambassador to
 the Chinese People's Republic, presented his credentials to Mao
 Tse-tung on 16 October.

 The Victors Come to Moscow:
 Two weeks later, Wang Chia-hsiang, first Chinese Communist
 ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Moscow and Deputy
 Foreign Minister Gromyko led a"group of protocdl officers
 to meet him at the train.  Wang was one of the "'returned student"
 clique trained in Moscow and sent back to China by Stalin in the
 early 1930's to run the Chinese Communist Party.  His appointment
 mong other things was, perhaps intended as a gracious gesture to
 Stalin as was that of his successor, Chang Wen-tien, also a "re-
 turned student."
 On 6 November Malenkov delivered the important Revolution
 Anniversary address in which he optimistically appraised Soviet
 prospects for world revolution as a sequel to World War II.
 Malenkov's  sanguine  ,.outl.ook  ,has been attributed  to the,
 special importance attached by the Kremlin to the China victory.
 At the UN later that month, Vyshinsky.;. declared that his govern-
 ment no longer recognized the Nationalist delegation and walked
 out of the debate on China.
 In mid-December Mao Tse-tung arrived in Moscow, and Molotov,
 Bulganin, and Gromyko met his train.  The same day he was received
 at the Kremlin by Stalin, Molotov, Malenkov, Bulganin, and
 Vyshinsky.
 On 20 January 1950, Chou En-lai joined Mao in Moscow.  The
 selection of Foreign Trade Minister Mikoyan as the ranking
 official to greet him and his subsequent entertainment by econom-
 ic officials would suggest that the Chinese premier's mission at
 that time at least in part was connected with the $300,000,000 loan
 included ii the subsequent treaty.  This loan has been used pri-
 marily to restore looted Manchurian industries.
 .  Mao and Chou left Moscow on 17 February 1950, seemingly
 satisfied with the results of their visit.  Communist China had
 a new treaty committing the USSR to a mutual defense arrangement,
 a Soviet promise to withdraw from Port Arthur and to return the
 Chinese Eastern Railroad, and a long-term credit which, though
 not lavish, would at least permit the Chinese to undertake rapid
 reconstruction of key industries.  However, there were reports
 at this time of some disquietude in Chinese Communist circles
 at rumors from Moscow that the negotiations were not proceeding
 favorably, and it is perhaps significant that the treaty re-
 quired two months of negotiations.

 The New Regime Prepares for Peace:
 By spring of 195Q9progress toward economic stability and
 the final battle with the Nationalists--the "liberation" of
 Formosa--seemed good.   So far the Sino-Soviet alliance had pro-
 duced an agreement to send Soviet experts to China,  the forma-
 tion of three Sino-Soviet joint stock campanies and a joint
 Board of Management for the Changchun Railroad, the ratification
 of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Aid, the signing
 and ratification of a Sino-Soviet trade agreement for 1950, and,
 on the military side, a discernible build-up of forces on the
 mainland opposite Formosa.
 On 23 June Mao Tse-tung discussed China's progress in a
 closing speech at the second session of, the National Committee
 of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.   He
 stressed the importance of unity with the USSR.   Presumably he
 was aware of the imminence of the Korean adventure in the Far
 East although certainly not of the speed with which he would be-
 come involved.
 The Western reaction to the invasion of South Korea on 25
 June 1950 and the subsequent route of the North Korean army
 raised a new problem area for Sino-Soviet relations.
 Stalin was forced to put.real
 pressure on Mao to bring the Chinese into the Korean war.   The
 Chinese leader reportedly extracted __promises of greatly increased
 Soviet economic and military aid.
 However, Peiping must have estimated that it was important
 to keep North Korea from becoming a US-controlled base, border-
 ing as it would the strategic area of Manchuria.   Any display
 of reluctance by Mao to intervene in Korea might therefore have
 been mainly calculated to extract the most favorable terms from
 the Soviet Union.

 A redeployment of Chinese armies toward Manchuria had begun
 at least as early as                          After the UN
 counter-attack and offensive toward the       Parallel, the pace
 of the Chinese preparations was accelerated.  That autumn,
 Peiping used Indian and Burmese diplomatic channels to inform
 the United States that crossing the 38th Parallel by  "American"
 forces would necessitate Chinese intervention.   .
 By late September, some Chinese units were already present
 in Korea.   Large-scale intervention did not occur, however, until
 the last week in November, when US forces reached the Yalu and
 were overrun by a major Chinese offensive.
 By the end of 1950, the Communists had recaptured North
 Korea and by 4 January 1951 had taken Seoul.
 Peiping saved the day for Moscow, but the outcome of Stalin?s
 Korean gamble introduced serious new complications into the Sino-
 Soviet,relationship.
 Moscow Gives Back the Loot:
 Early in 1951, Moscow made much of the fact that it had re-
 turned to the Chinese all of the former Japanese property it had
 held in Manchuria.   These gifts had been promised a year earlier
 under the treaty Mao had negotiated in Moscow.  Peiping graciously
 acknowledged that the installations had been enlarged while under
 the direction of the USSR, whose administrators and trained tech-
 nicians had made it possible for the plants to be delivered in
 smooth running order.   It was subsequently disclosed, however,
 that one of the largest installations;,..allegedly returned--the
 Dairen Shipyard--had actually been formed into a joint stock
 company,
 Suggestions of Strain:
 By the first anniversary of the treaty on 14 February, there
 were signs of strain in the Peiping-Moscow axis.
 Any strain may well have resu  a   rom w a   oscow c nsi. er
 excessive demands by Peiping as the price for crossing the Yalu.

 It is possible that Mao was annoyed because the USSR was stalling
 on the aid it had promised when the Chinese entered the Korean
 war.
 On 18 February the military situation began to change.   The
 Chinese Communist drive was halted on the central front, and two
 days later UN forces launched a general counteroffensive.  On
 13 March the Communists broke off contact along the entire front,
 and the Allies reoccupied Seoul on the following day.
 The Communists launched two unsuccessful offensives, and by
 the end, of May they had been driven back across the 38th Parallel
 along most of the front.  On 21 June they lost their last strong-
 hold in South Korea.
 Soviet Cease-fire Proposal,.
 On 24 June 1951, Soviet UN delegate Malik made his proposal
 for a Korean cease-fire based on a mutual withdrawal of forces
 from the 38th Parallel.  Next day the Peiping People's Daily
 published the text of the Malik broadcast and declared that the
 Chinese people supported the suggestion.  On 10 July cease-fire
 talks began at Kaesong.
 A Quiet Period:
 Generally 1952 seemed a relatively uneventful year in Sino-
 Soviet relations.  On 11 February 1952 the Peiping People's
 Daily ran an article on the importance of the Sino- ovie  alli-
 ance, stressing that as long as China. stood with her "great
 ally," she would be able to smash "the imperialist plot of aggres-
 sion..!'   China's task, therefore, was to strengthen and consoli-
 date the "invincible. force" of the alliance.
 On'14 February, the second anniversary of the treaty, Bul-
 ganin, Molotov, and Miko an attended the Chinese embassy recep-
 tion in Moscow.                             the Soviet guests were            25X1
 amicable and stayed at the party for a proper number of hours.
 In Peiping, Liu Shao-chi and Chou En-lai attended a special cele-
 bration of'the event at the Soviet embassy.

 On 12 April 1952 the annual Sino-Soviet trade protocol was
 signed in Moscow, providing for a "considerable expansion in the
 exchange of goods in the current year as against the 1951 level."
 Another protocol was signed "by which the Soviet Union is to.
 deliver to the People's Republic of China equipment and materials
 during 1952 on account of the credit granted under the agreement
 of February 14, 19500"
 Stalemate in Korea,.
 Meanwhile, the Korean negotiations, which had broken down
 at Kaesong and been resumed at Panmunjom in late October 1951,
 were stalemated.                                      Stalin hoped for        25X1
 a Chinese break-through and hence was stalling.
 By June 1952, however, UN forces were on the move, and the
 Communists suffered heavy losses.  On 23 June UN planes hit the
 Yalu hydroelectric plants for the first time and by September
 North Korean targets were being hit by aircraft operating from
 carriers in the Northern waters.  At Panmunjom the UN negotiators
 broke off discussions on 8 October because of deadlock on the POW
 exchange, and there was some evidence that this occasioned sur-
 prise and concern in the Communist camp.
 The Chinese leaders might have been satisfied with the prac-
 tical benefits derived so far from the Korean war.   They had
 acquired the necessary Soviet assistance to build a first-class
 land army and a formidable air force, although at the cost of
 retarding their plans for industrial development and postponing
 the invasion of Formosa.  Moscow, on the other hand, had not
 only been forced to buy its way out of a threatening military
 disaster, but had increased the alarm and unity of the West.
 IV.  THE PROBLEM OF PEIPING's INDUSTRIALIZATION
 When Chou En-lai appeared in August 1952 in Moscow with a
 number of top-ranking Chinese economic officials, it appeared
 that Peiping was anxious. to get. back to its industrial develop-
 ment.
 ;Chou left Moscow in September 1952 after the announcement
 of rather unexciting Soviet concessions to Peiping   In accordance
 with the 1950 Sino-Soviet agreement,'a commission was to be. set up to

 `~-   complete the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to Peiping
 dot later than. 3L Decembef?,:1952..  It was also agreed that, ".at: the
 request of the Chinese government," the time limit stipulated in
 the 1950 agreement for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the
 Soviet naval, base at Port Arthur should be extended until the
 conclusion of peace treaties between Japan and the USSR and China.
 In early October, China's number-two man, Liu Shao-chi,
 publicly visited Moscow for the first time since he was there as
 a student at the Far Eastern University in 1918.  He went osten-
 sibly to represent Peiping at the 19th Party Congress, but no
 explanation was ever given as to why he stayed for some three
 months after the meeting.
 From late autumn 1952 until after Stalin's death, there were
 an unusually large number of ranking Chinese officials in Moscow.
 The top-level Chinese economic official who had come with Chou
 in August 1952 stayed on through the next summer.   The Chinese
 minister of trade, Yeh Chi-chuang, arrived in November 1952 to
 negotiate the annual trade agreement.   Curiously, the Chinese
 ambassador to Moscow was in Peiping during most of 1952 and 1953.
 The prolonged stays of these officials and reports of Soviet
 coolness and snubs to the Chinese in Moscow suggested that this
 was a period of possible strain in the Sino-Soviet relationship.
 Western journalists reported that the visiting Chinese officials
 were shabbily treated at Soviet parties in Moscow, being rele-
 gated to outer rooms.   In February 1953, only Bulganin among the
 Soviet leaders went to the Chinese embassy to celebrate the
 anniversary of the Sino-Soviet treaty.   It is possible that the
 Chinese were making further demands on the Soviet economy for
 the.long-sought domestic priorities at a time when Stalin was
 annoyed with Peiping's inability to break the military stale-
 mate in Korea.  However, the Soviet leaders were going through
 a period of internal tension they may well have considered more
 urgent than the problems of their Chinese allies.-
 Peiping may still have been optimistic about further Soviet
 aid during late 1952.  Although the heavy emphasis in propaganda
 on the less material aspect of their relationship seemed 'to
 Indicate that the optimism was tempered with caution.   In Novem-
 ber, the Chinese announced a Sino-Soviet Friendship Month, key-
 noted by such slogans as "study advanced Soviet technique'' and
 "learn from the experience of the Soviet Union."

 The other major Sino-Soviet problem, the Korean war, seemed
 to produce some moves which were badly co-ordinated between
 Moscow and Peiping.   In November 1952, Vyshinsky vehemently
 denounced the Indian resolution on a Korean armistice.   Indian
 diplomats expressed some surprise over this seemingly needless
 Soviet attack, as they had been in constant contact with the
 Chinese and had designed their proposal to meet what they felt
 were Chinese desires.
 On 10 March Pravda published a doctored photo of the 1950
 signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty.   In this version, Malenkov
 had moved next to Mao, and Molotov, Mikoyan, and Bulganin had
 been erased, like Beria, Khrushchev, Vyshinsky, Roshchin and
 Voroshilov.  Only Stalin, Mao and Malenkov were left.
 The implication must have been that there was a new man to
 be dealt with-and that his presence at a Sino-Soviet event had
 been chosen to illustrate his position as Stalin's heir.  Peiping
 and Soviet-bloc governments, however, treated the situation with
 cared  Malenkov was not singled out for praise, and his status
 was carefully described by the phrase  the Soviet government
 headed by G. M. Malenkov."
 On 25 March Moscow announced the signing of the annual
 protocol on trade between the USSR and China, a protocol to the
 agreement on credit to the Chinese People's Republic of 14 Feb-
 ruary 1950, and an agreement concerning Soviet aid to China in
 expanding and constructing power Stations.  The agreements, as
 usual, envisaged expanded mutual trade and specified that the
 USSR would supply China with heavy industrial and agricultural
 equipment in return for Chinese raw materials and foodstuffs.
 Appointment of Kuznetsova
 Chou, accompanied by the Chinese ambassador, returned to
 Peiping on 24 March 1953, again leaving behind in Moscow the
 economic and military aides who had gone there with him the pre-
 vious August.  Molotov, Malik, and the newly appointed,.ambassador
 to China, V. V. Kuznetsov, saw the Chinese premier to his plane,
 and Kuznetsov followed two days later.

 Peiping is certainly Moscow's most sensitive diplomatic post
 in the Orbit.  The Kremlin changed ambassadors there within a
 atter of hours after Stalin's death, replacing A. S. Panyushkin,
 who had arrived at this post only four months earlier.   In line
 with their cautious policy on happenings in the Soviet Union at
 that time, the Chinese gave no sign of their feelings about Mos-
 cow's new emissary.   In fact, the Chinese did not even announce
 the appointment until Kuznetsov departed for the Chinese capital
 on 25 March.
 Kuzaetsov's trade union background and experience in Soviet
 industry led to speciii1tiou that he was selected to aid the
 Chinese with labor problems, during they `initial stages of their
 first five-year piano.  ,His activitie  i,n China, however, received
 little public notice and consequently provided no clue as ,to why
 he was selected
 Ending of Korean Stalemates
 The. major problem settled by Stal,in,'s successors. with Chou
 was Korea.  Two days after Chou's arrival in Peiping, Peng Te4huai
 accepted General Clark's month-:old offer'for the exchange of sick
 and wounded and suggested resumption of the stalemated Panmunjom
 talks.
 These indications that a Korean truce was the first order
 of business are further strengthened by Soviet diplomatic leaks.
 A Soviet official in London hinted that the USSR wanted peace
 because the Korean war had proved too bevy a drain on China And
 the USSR,  Despite Rhee's mass release - o_f prisoners in June, an
 armistice agreement was signed at Panmunjom on 29 July.
 That summer, Moescow made- a big play to Chinese prestige.
 Soviet-commentators became far more generous in their appraisal
 of Mao's contribution to Marxist doctrine.   In August Malenkov
 and the whole party presidium attended a rather ordinary Chinese
 farm show, and Mikoyan gave a "grand reception" to mark its
 successful conclusion.

 `%'             Peiping Undertakes its Transition to Socialism:
 There were no such celebrations to mark the conclusion of
 the economic,-negotiations which Peiping's emissaries had been
 carrying on in Moscow for almost a year.                         Chou's chief aide,
 Li Fu?chun, evidently returned to Peiping during the summer of
 1953.   The results of his mission were not announced until Sep-
 tember, however, when Li reported to the Central People's Govern-
 ment Council that the USSR had "agreed to satisfy the demands" of
 the Chinese government and would provide aid for the construction
 of 141 basic industries in China in the course of an aid program
 to run through 1959.  There was no mention then of any formal
 agreement, which Li Fumchun has subsequently said was concluded
 in May.
 It would seem that the Chinese were not unduly jubilant over
 the agreement they had reached with Stalin's successors.  While
 Peiping was receiving industrial goods which were in short supply
 throughout the Soviet bloc, it had received no large additional
 credits to the $300,000,000 granted in 1950 for five years.
 Throughout 1953, it is possible that Peiping was going through
 a period of indecision on domestic policy.  The outcome of the
 Moscow negotiations undoubtedly played a great role in the diffi-
 *rr             culty of deciding what China's general line for the transition to
 Socialism was to be.  While Chinese industrialization has not
 apparently been limited by the quantity or type of industrial
 equipment the Soviet leaders were willing to provide, China's
 limited export capability and the need to spend nearly  half
 its trade earnings from the USSR on military,  imports, have been
 governing factors.
 Li Fu-shun, the man who had been most involved in these
 negotiations, wrote an article upon his return from Moscow for
 the China edition of the Cominform journal in which he criticized
 those comrades who "set the scope of our new development plans
 too wide and demand too much speed."
 In addition to this evidently disappointing deal, the Peiping
 leaders had to face other sobering announcements from the USSR
 that summer.  Malenkov's 8 August speech calling for concentra-
 tion on increasing consumer goods for the Soviet populace did
 not augur well in terms of what would be left over for China.
 Khrushchev's report a month later on the failure of Soviet
 agriculture just as the Chinese began their drive for collectivi-
 zation could also have been disillusioning.

 A connection between Moscow's preoccupation with its own
 troubles and Peiping's domestic policy was apparent.  In the
 autumn of 1953, Peiping announced a campaign of austerity simul-
 taneously with the Soviet aid agreement     In early 1954, the
 Chinese were also warned by the People's Daily not-to expect
 consumer goods from the USSR, since the Soviet economy developed
 according to a definite ratio which would not be changed to absorb
 more Chinese agricultural products or to produce more consumer
 goods to meet Chinese demands.
 Despite Khrus.hchev's implicit admission that Soviet agri-
 cultural methods had proved disappointing, the central committee
 of the Chinese Communist Party published in December a four-year-
 old "Decision on the Development of Agricultural Producers'
 Co-operatives" calling for establishment of 800,000 producers'
 cooperativesby 1957, a goal that was soon.upped to 3,000,000,
 embracing more than half of China's peasant population.
 The prolonged bargaining between the USSR and China could
 well account for the rather strained atmosphere at the October
 Revolution Day ceremonies in Moscow in 1953.  At the annual
 reception, Molotov was reported to have ignored the Chinese ambas-
 sador.  To Molotov's one remark that there were "many complicated
 problems" in the Far East and he was sure the Chinese ambassador
 "had many thoughts on that subject," Mikoyan responded contemp-
 low  that the Chinese ambassador '?doesn't think at all."
 Also beginning in the fall of 1953, a rather curious propa-
 ganda difference was noted between Peiping and Moscow.  On 19
 September Malenkov had gone out of his way in a speech to the
 visiting North Korean delegation to make a major address on the
 Far East.  There was a new situation in the Far East, Malenkov
 asserted, and the world should take note of it.  Now that peace
 had been restored in Korea, the Chinese People's Republic could
 be freely appreciated and its role as stabilizing factor in the
 Far East was to be noted.  He later said that the alliance
 guarantees "the peace of the world."  Peiping, however, seemed
 not to take to this bit of flattery with its implications of less
 need for direct assistance from the USSR.  The Chinese continued
 to stress the old formula--that the alliance guarantees "the
 peace of the Far East and the world"--emphasizing joint Sino?
 Soviet responsibility in the Far East.
 On the other hand Peiping was. not reluctant to claim ad-
 vanced political and economic status for its present stage of
 development.   In October 1953 the "general line" for the transi-
 tion to socialism in China was announced in a directive signed
 25X1

 Approved For Release 2008/08/01: CIA-RDP91TO 1172R000300270002-9
 by Mao.     While the substance of this line was to be modified and
 revised throughout the next year, the regime advertised through
 all media available to Peiping that China was ready for this
 in its year-end editorial for 1953 placed China in a pre=traits
 tion status, by carefully distinguishing between the Eastern
 European people's democracies, which were "building socialism,"
 nd the Chinese, who were "making progress in building a new life."
 Peiping's eagerness to claim Moscow's aid as the factor responsible
 for its ability to by-pass capitalise and move ahead so rapidly
 may have given the USSR more responsibility that the Kremlin
 leaders were willing to accept.
 In December 1953 a Soviet ideological expert, Pavel Yudin,
 replaced Kuznetsov as ambassador to China.  This shift was evi-
 l  somewhat of a surprise to Kuznets
 Yudin, however, was obviously far 'better
 qualified to handle any potentially dangerous ideological rifts
 which might develop between the two countries.
 This ideological discrepancy continued through the summer
 of 1954.   It was finally settled in September, when the long-
 awaited Soviet text on Political Economy was reviewed by Pravda,
 and China's movement in To socialism without a prior perio
 capitalist development was cited as an outstanding example of how
 each country must work out its own economic policy to build
 socialism.  However, China's claim to a unique state form--the
 "people's democratic dictatorship"--for the transition to socia-
 lism continues to contradict Political Economy's postulate that
 it is "impossible" to build a  oc a  s  society without the
 "dictatorship of the proletariat."
 Peiping As
 The year 1954 raised to a new high Moscow's efforts to demon-
 strate its regard for Peiping and the inviolability of the Sino?
 Soviet alliance.
 The annual Sino-Soviet trade protocol was signed on 23
 January.   It was announced that the USSR would supply China with
 metallurgical and mining equipment, power generating equipment,
 motor vehicles, tractors, agricultural and building machinery,
 structural steel, nonferrous metal products, petroleum products,
 chemicals, and other goods.  China was to provide nonferrous

 metals, soya beans, rice, peanuts, vegetable oils, meat, tea,
 tobacco, fruit, wool, raw silk, silk piecegoods, hides and
 other goods.
 At the Berlin conference in January, Molotov successfully
 manipulated an invitation for Peiping to attend the Geneva con-
 ference.
 On the occasion of the Sino-Soviet treaty anniversary,
 Molotov and his staff attended the Chinese embassy party in
 Berlin, while Malenkov and a high-level group including Khru-
 shchev honored the Chinese ambassador in Moscow.  Two weeks
 later, Malenkov and other leading party members attended a
 banquet for visiting Chinese journalists.
 In July, on his way back to Geneva, Chou stayed in Moscow
 for two days, and, since both Khrushchev and Molotov were absent,
 undoubtedly conferred with Malenkov.
 Peiping Comes of Age:
 When Chou again returned to Moscow in late July, Western
 diplomats noted his self-assurance with the Kremlin leaders.
 Chou took the opportunity to repay any snubs his countrymen had
 suffered when they were negotiating for economic aid a year
 earlier.  At a reception given in his honor by Molotov, the
 Chinese premier--with apparently little regard for the foreign
 diplomats and correspondents present--made some rather pointed
 and biting remarks 1A Mikoyan and Kaganovich. He spoke b them in English, a

 language they did not understand, and said he had no apology for
 this since the two officials had not'.bothered to learn Chinese.
 Chou told Mikoyan that, considering how many dealings he had
 carried on with the Chinese, it was time he learned their language.
 Mikoyan's defense on the grounds of the difficulty of the Chinese
 language was rejected by Chou's observation that Russian was
 equally difficult for the Oriental.  To Kaganovich, Chou remarked,
 "There's no excuse for you people."  These sallies could have
 been indicative of Chinese annoyance with the prolonged negotia-
 tions which had marked all of Peiping's.economic dealings with
 Moscow..
 With both Khrushchev and Malenkov, Chou probably discussed
 China's economic problems in light of the floods which by then
 were destroying large areas of badly-needed crops.  There is no
 evidence,'however, that Chou got more than sympathy from the
 Kremlin.  On the contrary, Chinese rice exports to the USSR in
 the second half of 1954 reached a record 275,000 tons.
 In September, Moscow made its most lavish gesture of friend-
 ship to China when Khrushchev, Bulganin and Mikoyan traveled to
 Peiping to help the Chinese Republic celebrate its fifth birth-
 day.   In retrospect, this trip may have marked the end of an
 era in Sino-Soviet relations.  By the autumn of 1954, Moscow was
 faced with a strong and growing China, quite possibly dissatis-
 fied with the extent of Soviet economic aid,. and engaged in a
 dangerously provocative adventure off the China coast.
 During his visit, however, Khrushchev gave no evidence that
 he championed a change in Soviet policy toward China.  He avoided
 any new pledge to Peiping on the Formosa question, carefully dis-
 tinguishing between Soviet "government" endorsement of China's
 claims to Formosa and the support of the Soviet "people" for
 Peiping's military aim of liberating the island.  Khrushchev
 generously endorsed Peiping's new constitutional plans which call
 for a moderate and almost unique transition to Socialism.  Before
 the Soviet, leaders left, they announced several major concessions
 whi'ch' both parties utilized to demonstrate to the world the
 firmness of their mutual alliance.

 V
 It may be that the Chinese extracted a commitment.. for
 increased military and economic equipment from Khrushchev while
 his group was in Peiping.  However, the additional modest Soviet
 credit announced in the 11 October joint Sino-Soviet communique
 was undoubtedly worked out in Moscow some time before the group
 left.
 If further commitments were made, they could easily have
 played a part in the resolution of the Soviet policy problems
 which culminated in the Malenkov shake-up.  A suggestion of a
 connection between Malenkov's demotion and the problem of aid
 to China can be noted in a series of articles in the authorita-
 tive Soviet journal Kommunist of February and March of this year.
 These articles criticized    ose individuals who had underestimated
 the importance of heavy industry, especially in light of the
 Soviet international obligations to "furnish friendly aid" for
 the "economic development of the other countries of the camp of
 There are indications that Peiping is continuing to receive
 significant military aid from the USSR.~
 While the present Kremlin leaders may possibly be moving
 toward stronger material aid to China, they still have not given-
 unequivocal support to Peiping's Formosan campaign,   Their
 propaganda has continued to portray this as an internal affair
 of the Chinese, and Molotov has meanwhile been busy keeping the
 way open for a diplomatic settlement.   In late March, Khrushchev
 took the strongest position to date
 Bulganin had likewise pledged

 cause"--again without spelling out what he meant by "aid,"

 policy speech.   In an early February interview with William

 ,
 Randolph Hearst Jr., Marshal Zhukov referred to Formosa as "one
 err' of those little things" and an "accident"--a viewpoint which
 Peiping might well have found annoying.   It would seem that Mos-
 cow clearly desires to avoid a general war over Formosa and is
 anxious to forestall any actions by either side which might lead
 to major military action and thus confront the Soviet leaders
 with very difficult and painful decisions.  Moscow has apparently
 sought to restrain American actions by hinting at the consequences
 of an attack on China.   The Austrian delegation left Moscow last
 April with the impression that the USSR would give China "all-
 out aid" in the event of war.
 Peiping and the Kremlin "New Team":
 The USSR appears to be exerting pressure
 on the Chinese to look for a peaceful solution to this question.
 Peiping, on the other hand, may consider that the new team in
 the Kremlin has gone farther, but still not far enough in its
 military backing of Peiping's aspirations.
 Moscow is certainly well aware of the sensitivity of the,
 Chinese.   In his reportedly unsatisfactory 8 February speech,
 Molotov had made a special effort to elevate the Chinese to co-
 partner status with Moscow as leaders of the camp of socialism.
 In early March Anna Louise Strong was exonerated and her connec-
 tion with and championship of the Chinese cause made this also
 appear as a possible play to Peiping.  Moscow's appointment on
 22 March of V. V. Kuznetsev as first deputy foreign minister
 and N. T. Fedorenko as deputy foreign minister put two China
 experts high in the Soviet Foreign Ministry setup.
 Prognosis:
 . It seems inevitable that Peiping's economic problems will
 continue to plague Moscow for the next several years.   The

 Peiping regime is now committed to rapid industrialization, and
 it starts from a considerably smaller industrial base than the
 Soviet Union had in its parallel period of development.  The
 pattern of present East-West relations makes it necessary for
 Peiping to depend on Moscow to provide the industrial equipment
 necessary for the achievement of its goals,  The Chinese have
 thus beep continually forced to tailor their program to Soviet
 willingness and capability to make Chinese economic progress
 possible.,
 In 1953 Mosoow  exports of capital goods to China amounted
 to nearly 3 percent of its total investment in capital goods.
 Although this appears small it represents a fairly substantial
 contribution at a time when the USSR is striving for greatly
 increased industrialization,  However, it would seem this is
 only the beginning of the Chinese demands upon the Soviet economy,
 and there may well be additional strains as Peiping attempts to
 force Moscow into subordinating:?some of- its more Ammedi'ate economic
 goals to the longer range in erests of the Chinese.
 In the political field, China's position as a junior partner
 seems now to be improving.   Peiping's growing strength and its
 expansionist tendencies should further strain the Sino-Soviet
 relationship,  Not only will Moscow have to share its leader-
 ship of the Communist camp in Asia but also it must take account
 of China's new dimensions as a world power.  The present Far
 Eastern situation, where Peiping's military might, created with
 the aid of Soviet materials and technicians, threatens to involve
 its benefactor in a general war with the United States, is
 illustrative of Moscow's problems with a growing China.
 Ideologically, the Communist theoreticians must take further
 note of Mao's successful "creative application of Marxism-Lenin-.
 ism."  The dynamic experiment in building Socialism which be-
 longed.to Moscow in the 1920's has now been transferred to Peiping,
 which in addition is bordered by those areas most vulnerable
 today to Communist expansion.
 Chou En-lai's role at the recent Bandung conference illus-
 trates the behind-the-scenes position in Asian politics which
 Moscow may have to accept as the corollary of publicly recogniz-
 ing Peiping's co-equal status.  The. Chinese premier showed a
 degree of flexibility and independence far greater than is custom-
 ary for Soviet bloc representatives in dealing with the non-Com-
 munist world.

 Chou did not defend the Soviet Union against public charges
 of tyranny and imperialism, and he gave Peiping's approval to
 the conference communique which contained features long chal-
 lenged by Moscow, although he has since plausibl-yexplained his
 actions as motivated by tactical considerations designed to
 get the widest possible area of agreement.  These included,
 endorsement for UN membership of seven Afro-Asian nations which
 the USSR had consistently vetoed, inferential approval of the US
 plan for the peaceful use of atomic energy and American economic
 aid, both of which Molotov has persistently denounced as "imperia-
 list tricks," and .finally', endorsement for a proposal on nuclear
 weapons and disarmament which deviates considerably from the
 Moscow line.
 While Chou by'no means abandoned the goals of world Com-
 munism at Bandung, he did not speak as a prisoner of Moscow's
 line.  Moreover, Chou was willing to encourage the belief that
 Communist China would develop along nationalist lines diverging
 to some degree from the USSR.  Chou's tactics suggested that
 Peiping wished to further at this conference both Sino-Soviet
 bloc objectives and Peiping's own goal of pre-eminence in Asian
 politics.
 Soviet ideology does not allow for other foci of Communist
 doctrinal authority.   In this respect, Peiping's power to make
 independent policy decisions represents one of the greatest
 trials that Moscow as the leader of international communism will
 have to face.
 Conclusion:
 For the future the problem of Sino-Soviet relations would
 thus seem to be that of constantly reconciling conflicting national
 interests.   Previously the greatest tensions an this relationship
 have appeared to come when the respective interests of,the two
 countries have become so antagonistic as to require modification.
 This was the case in the 1920's when the Chiriesc..~: party was
 nearly annihilated as a result of Stalin's policies, and it
 seemed again to be true in 1950 when Peiping's immediate goals--
 domestic development and the capture of Formosa--were put off
 by the press of events in Korea.   This conflict of interests may
