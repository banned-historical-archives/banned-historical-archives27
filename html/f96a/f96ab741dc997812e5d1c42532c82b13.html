Chinese Expectations for Jiang's Visit to the United States 
16 July 1997 
Chinese leaders have low expectations for major 
bilateral agreements in connection with Jiang Zemin's planned visit to the United 
States, primarily because they assess that Washington is not prepared to .respond 
positively to Chinese initiatives. The Chinese are instead focused on the fact of the 
visit itself, which carries immense symbolic importance to them. 
� Chinese leaders view the exchange of state visits as Washington's 
acknowledgment of China's reemergence as a world power and as the 
end of the opprobrium surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown. 
� Beijing thus is taking steps to promote a positive atmosphere in the 
runup to the summit, and Chinese leaders may seek a broad statement 
of principles that outlines the strategic basis for bilateral relations, 
according to various reports. 
Chinese officials have not ruled out agreements on outstanding bilateral issues, 
but they appear to be awaiting 
indications that Washington will meet their conditions before considering major 
concessions. Moreover, even if Beijing sees Washington moving forward, there are 
domestic constraints on what the Chinese might offer. 
� As this is a political year in Beijing, Chinese leaders are reluctant to 
make hard foreign policy decisions or offer concessions to the United 
States that might have negative domestic implications. Jiang in 
particular must balance his personal desire to use the visit to burnish his 
statesman credentials against his need to defend Beijing's interests.

Low Expectations 
the Chinese have modest 
expectations for agreement on substantive bilateral issues during Jiang Zemin's 
planned visit to Washington this fall. Even on key issues where significant progress 
has been explored, Beijing appears to have lowered its sights: 
� 
 China's chief WTO 
negotiator is now arguing that Jiang's visit offers only an 
opportunity to resolve some of the problems blocking China's WTO 
bid rather than to actually conclude an agreement on accession. 
� While Beijing continues to press publicly for permanent MEN status, 
Chinese diplomats 
focus merely on renewal for another year 
� 
The primary reason that Chinese expectations for the summit are low is that Beijing, 
has calculated that Washington currently has a 
limited ability to respond positively to any initiatives the Chinese might offer. 
Specifically, Chinese leaders argue that ongoing bilateral problems--such as the 
campaign financing scandal, a tougher than expected fight on MEN, and potential 
disputes over such issues as Hong Kong and human rights--are due largely to US 
domestic political factors, which have constrained the administration's options on 
policy toward China:

leaders were concerned that Sino-US relations were being victimized 
by different US interest groups that would hamper President Clinton's 
ability to formulate and implement China policy. 
� 
� 
Beijing views the campaign 
financing allegations as a partisan attack by "anti-China forces" that 
came just as "real progress" was being made in Sino-US relations. 
As a result, Chinese leaders appear to have decided that their 
requirement for reciprocity P in the relationship is not likely to be met under present 
circumstances. Beijing appears to be awaiting indications that its own conditions 
would be met before considering major bilateral _agreements in connection with the 
summit and thus upgrading its expectations. 
Beijing's Primary Goal is High Protocol 
Even if no substantial agreements are forged on bilateral issues, Beijing is eager to 
have the summit because of the immense diplomatic value the Chinese assign to it. 
Indeed Chinese leaders would rather 
waive major substantive accomplishments of the visit than allow bilateral disputes over 
those issues to overshadow the opportunity to have their president received in 
Washington. As a result, the Chinese have consistently focused more on the fact of 
the visit rather than any specific results of it: 
� Foreign Minister Qiin Qichen's primary purpose during his late April 
visit to Washington was to secure a firm date for the summit,

Approved for Release: 2022/10/18 C00725557 
Sccrct 
� Chinese officials emphasize the importance of the visit even when 
protesting US actions. 
The exchange of state visits is of profound symbolic importance to Beijing because 
Chinese leaders see it as a symbol of China's reemergence as a world power and the 
end of the opprobrium surrounding the Tiananmen crackdown. As the Chinese made 
clear in failed negotiations for a state visit in the fall of 1995, they believe Jiang must 
be received at the highest protocol level, requisite with his position and the treatment 
he has received in other world capitals. In an effort to mark the significance of the 
event and establish the rhetorical basis for a strategic relationship, Beijing reportedly 
may press for the issuance of a joint statement on bilateral relations similar to the 
documents Jiang signed with YeFtsin in April and Chirac in May, which were long on 
rhetoric and short on substance.  
Trying To Foster a Positive Atmosphere 
Given the importance Beijing assigns to the visit, Chinese leaders are trying to ensure a 
favorable climate in Sino-US relations in the runup to the summit. Beijing has made 
some specific gestures designed to improve the atmosphere: 
� Chinese leaders and officials have been unusually nonconfrontational in 
recent meetings with US counterparts and have reacted relatively mildly 
to several sensitive developments that would normally bring harsh 
protests--including US criticism of China at the UNHRC and delivery 
of F-16 aircraft to Taiwan, 
� 
Over the past several weeks Beijing has also been unusually 
forthcoming in bilateral discussions of individual human rights cases, 
Chinese authorities, moreover, 
recently overturned the conviction of two dissidents who were jailed in 
connection with the 1989 student demonstrations, and allowed the 
secretary of jailed dissident Wei Jingsheng to leave China for academic 
study in the United States.

� In April, China released to US custody a suspected drug trafficker, 
highlighting the move as a demonstration of Beijing's interest in  
improving Sino-US relations. 
� Officials from China's official news agency notified US diplomats last 
month that controls over foreign economic information would be lifted 
and--in the interests of maintaining good relations--US vendors would 
face no deadline for com liance with the remaining registration 
requirement.

government was encouraging the Chinese media to feature more favorable coverage of 
the United States and to avoid ultranationalistic stories or specific criticisms of the 
White House in advance of the Jiang visit. Accordingly, many articles that have 
appeared criticizing the United States have either been signed by individuals or 
published in the Chinese-backed Hong Kong press--which lends the regime a veneer of 
official deniability. 
Still Weighing Bilateral Deals 
In addition to those steps, Beijing continues to send overtures that it has not ruled out 
possible substantive agreements on outstanding bilateral issues: 
� For example,  
 in an effort to make Jiang's trip more "constructive and 
fruitful," the leadership is considering "compromises" on human rights, 
trade, and proliferation.

Sccrct 
we believe the Chinese may yet offer real concessions on 
key bilateral issues between now and the summit if they judge that such steps will be 
reciprocated. Below is an outline of China's bargaining position on the major agenda 
items. 
Proliferation. Despite some pessimism about US reliability as a supplier of nuclear 
technology, Beijing is likely to press for 
implementation of the 1985 Sino-US peaceful nuclear cooperation (PNC) agreement, 
arguing that China has met all or most of the conditions for it to proceed.2 The 
Chinese side may announce that nuclear export control regulations--which the Chinese 
have been working on for three years--have been enacted, thereby meeting a key US 
requirement. this probably would take the form of 
a State Council executive order near the time of the summit rather than formal 
legislation, which would need to be passed by the National People's Congress. There 
is precedent for such a procedure; in December 1995 the State Council issued detailed 
chemical export controls. Beijing probably is moving to meet some US requirements 
for implementation of the 
1985 PNC agreement because of its desire to obtain US civilian nuclear technology  
and power reactors  
The Chinese are likely to deflect any connection between the PNC agreement and 
chemical, missile, and conventional arms nonproliferation. Chinese officials have told 
US diplomats that Beijing shares Washington's nonproliferation goals, but they have 
rejected US appeals to halt what Beijing regards as legitimate exports: 
� If pressed on chemical exports, Chinese officials are likely to stress that 
both China and the United States ratified the CWC in April. Beijing, 
however, has characterized as unwarranted the sanctions Washington 
imposed on Chinese entities last month, according to press reports. 
� Chinese officials also reject US criticism on Chinese sales of missile 
technology and advanced conventional weapons, including cruise 
missiles to Iran, by pointing to what they describe as the" roliferation" 
problem of advanced weapons sales to Taiwan. 
2 The 1985 PNC agreement allows for the transfer of US civilian nuclear technology 
provided China meets certain conditions regarding the retransfer of nuclear technology to 
third countries and that China uses the US technology for peaceful purposes.

  Chinese leaders have yet to create a 
detailed action plan for WTO accession, and their concern 
about hurting domestic industries is still preventing forward movement: 
� The current tariff reduction package under consideration, for example, 
does not lower rates for automobiles and chemicals because they are 
considered "pillar industries" that need protection from foreign 
competitors. 
� While the central leadership is committed to state enterprise reform that 
will help make the economy more consistent with WTO, it wants to 
carefully control the pace of reform to head off potential instability 
resulting from increasing unemployment. 
� Various reports say that Jiang personally favors WTO accession. but 
not at the risk of harming China's fundamental interests. 
Trade and Big Ticket Contracts. Beijing frequently times the announcement of large 
purchases to coincide with state visits and will probably plan similar deals to coincide  
with the summit.

willingness to to purchase more US-manufactured goods, they claim that US export 
controls restrict many of the desired purchases. Moreover, China will probably import 
much less US grain this year because of ample stockpiles and the expectation of 
another good harvest. 
(b)(3) 
Human Rights. Beijing's overriding concerns about stability and maintenance of 
regime control will continue to limit Chinese leaders' willingness to make concessions 
on human rights issues.  they (b)(1) 
doubt the sincerity of US human rights concerns because they continue to believe that (b)(3) 
Washington's underlying goal is to subvert Communist rule. There also is tremendous 
reluctance in China's public security and military apparatus to making concessions on 
human rights. (b)(3) 
Nevertheless, a variety of reporting shows that Jiang and the Foreign Ministry 
occasionally support offering gestures--such as limited dialogue, release of dissidents, 
or the signing of international covenants--to foster positive bilateral relations to  
improve China's image. (b)(1) 
China is willing to resume the bilateral human rights dialogue or sign new (b)(3) 
international covenants--but only if the United States first drops its "confrontational" 
approach to China at the annual session of the UNHRC: 
� Beijing has underscored this linkage by opening human rights dialogues 
and legal exchanges with countries that opted not to cosponsor the 
"anti-China" resolution this year 
� 
if the United States is willing to 
take a "more positive" approach on the issue, Jiang could be prepared 
to offer major human rights concessions, such as the signing of the 
UN covenant on civil and political rights. 
Chinese Domestic Constraints 
Even if Beijing altered its assessment by calculating that Washington was ready for 
substantial agreements, there are limits to what Chinese leaders would offer. Because 
they are currently preoccupied with domestic concerns--such as sustaining a smooth 
transition in Hong Kong and preparing for the upcoming 15th Party Congress--they 
probably are disinclined to confront hard foreign policy decisions. Moreover, even 
under the best of circumstances, it is difficult for them to reach a consensus on any 
proposed concessions to Washington:

Sccrct 
The senior leadership's desire to avoid both internal crises and any 
serious confrontation with the US during what is essentially an 
"election year" in China has made consensus on major new initiatives in 
Sino-US relations highly problematic. For example, Beijing is reluctant 
to meet some of Washington's requirements for a bilateral WTO deal 
because it would involve economic policy measures that would hurt 
domestic Chinese industries. 
� Moreover, each member of the leadership is determined to avoid the 
appearance of being "soft" on the United States during the political 
jockeying in the runup to the party congress. On the contrary, each 
feels the need to burnish his nationalist credentials and demonstrate that 
he can stand up to US "pressure.'" 
Jiang is especially vulnerable because he must balance his personal desire to make the 
trip against his need to defend Beijing's interests and its agenda for the bilateral 
relationship: 
� Jiang is clearly anxious for the summit so he can burnish his credentials 
as a statesman and solidify support behind his stewardship of Sino-US 
relations, which was bestowed on him by Deng Xiaoping. 
� 
� 
Wild Cards: Potential Summit Spoilers 
These pressures on Jiang in large part reflect a consensus within the Chinese leadership 
that the conditions of the summit must not compromise national interests. As a result, 
we cannot rule out the possibility that Beijing would consider.canceling the summit 
under certain circumstances.

New US sanctions on China. Beijing has repeatedly condemned 
sanctions and threats of sanctions as "US oressure" and "interferenrp in 
China's internal affairs."  
 Accordingly, harsh sanctions on China--such as 
Category I MTCR sanctions or other packages being considered in the 
US Congress--would probably bring a renewal of such rhetoric and 
present an obstacle to Jiang's visit.
