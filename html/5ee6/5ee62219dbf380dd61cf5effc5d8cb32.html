 Zhao Ziyang:
 China's strongman, Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping, has groomed Premier
 Zhao Ziyang and Chairman Hu Yaobang to be his political successors.
 Deng expects the two men to continue his moderate economic and political
 policies and to provide the leadership stability and policy continuity that
 China has lacked.
 Although some Chinese have speculated that Zhao nay challenge Hu for
 preeminence after Deng is gone, he has done surprisingly little to cultivate
 the personal following necessary for any aspirant to power. We believe
 Zhao will be content to remain subordinate to Hu.
 In the succession period, we expect Zhao to continue to confine himself to
 his ministerial role, running the government bureaucracy and directing
 economic policy. His record suggests he will argue for continuing China's
 moderate economic and social policies. Zhao's views on foreign policy bear
 the stamp of his domestic priorities, indicating that he will work to
 maintain and expand China's foreign economic and commercial ties,
 including those with the United States.
 Because Hu is so much more controversial and because Zhao enjoys good
 working relations with most elements in the leadership, Zhao could emerge
 as a compromise leader if Hu encounters major opposition. We believe
 Zhao's lack of a network of supporters, however, would greatly reduce his
 chances of maintaining the top position over the long term.
 Unlike Hu, Zhao does not have a close personal relationship with Deng.
 We believe Zhao was tapped by Deng for the premiership because of
 Zhao's administrative talents and advocacy of Deng's reform program.
 Zhao also has ties to party conservatives who have reservations about Hu.
 We speculate Deng may have seen Zhao's ties as an asset in selling the
 reforms.
 Because Zhao is closely identified with the major government and
 economic policies initiated since 1980, he could be made the scapegoat ii'
 these experiments fail. We believe Deng does not have a personal
 commitment to Zhao and might sacrifice him to save Hu.
 Information available as of 22 July 1982

 Relatively little is known about Zhao Ziyang's nonpublic life and his
 personal relations with key leaders, particularly party Chairman Hu
 Yaobang. Much more is known about Zhao's views on major policy
 questions. We have made extensive use of Zhao's speeches and statements,
 in reaching
 our conclusions. We have also closely examined the pattern of Zhao's
 promotions, purges, and appearances for insights into his relations with key
 elements of the leadership.

 Zhao Ziyang:
 A Political Profile
 25X1
 In a sense, the Chinese leadership has spent the last
 20 years locked in a struggle for political succession.
 Mao Zedong cast about for years for a reliable
 successor, repeatedly embracing, then destroying
 many of the men who made China's revolution. In the
 process he nearly destroyed the Communist Party
 during the Cultural Revolution (1966-69).
 As one of China's veteran revolutionaries and today's
 strongman. Deng Xiaoping is determined to undo the
 damage Mao caused. Since returning to power after
 the Cultural Revolution, Deng has acted to restore the
 image of the party, repair its internal organization,
 and replace political enemies. Pragmatic as long as
 the party's prerogatives remain unchallenged, Deng
 wants to ensure that his successors continue the
 reforms he believes will make the country powerful
 and economically vigorous.
 The centerpiece of Deng's plan was the selection of
 Zhao Ziyang as Premier in 1980 and of Hu Yaobang
 as party Chairman in 1981. Hu is Deng's heir in
 managing the party's affairs. Ranked number one in
 the party today, he is Deng's closest ally and longtime
 protege.
 Ranked number four in the hierarchy, Premier Zhao
 Ziyang at 63 is a relatively young, results-oriented
 politician who in our view has been entrusted by Deng
 with implementing the reform of the government and
 economy. As measured by the standards set in Chi-
 na's propaganda in the last few years, Zhao comes
 close to typifying the ideal post-Cultural Revolution
 leader: an expert administrator who is pragmatic
 rather than ideological, conveys an image of public
 service, and assiduously respects the principle of
 collective leadership. With good health  physical and
 political  we expect Zhao will be at the center of
 Chinese politics well into the next decade.
 Zhao is also a study in contrasts. He is not "Deng's
 man," but he has benefited from Deng's patronage.
 He is one of the reformers and an architect of their
 policies, yet he is on good terms with the party
 conservatives. In a political system that stresses per-
 sonal ties, Zhao rose to the top largely on his ability.
 He has shown through his actions to be given to
 accommodation and orderly procedures  he formally
 transferred his seals of office to the Red Guards when
 he was ousted as first secretary in Guangdong Prov-
 ince during the Cultural Revolution  but he is capa-
 ble of vigorously purging his opponents. And, while he
 seems content at present to act the good minister for
 party Chairman Hu Yaobang, many Chinese officials
 have speculated that if flu stumbles Zhao is the
 logical replacement.
 Zhao is on record publicly and privately as favoring
 moderate economic growth and social policies, and we
 believe he will resist strongly a return to the more
 doctrinaire  and destabilizing  politics of the late
 1960s and earls 1970s. Given Zhao's concentration on
 economic development and his recognition of China's
 inability to "go it alone," we would expect film to be
 an advocate in the years ahead for maintaining an
 "open door" to the outside world and expanding
 China's commercial and economic tics. To the degree
 he assumes a role in making foreign policy, we believe
 he is likely to display the same pragmatic, nonideolog-
 ical orientation that characterizes his approach to
 domestic policy.
 Unlike most Chinese political figures, Zhao does not
 owe his rise to a powerful patron. Rather, he has had
 a series of benefactors, all of whom werc associated
 with the moderate wing of the party that opposed the
 radical policies of Mao Zedong. Zhao's first impor-
 tant patron was Tao Zhu, a Politburo member who
 died in 1969 after being purged in the Cultural
 Revolution. This relationship tied him distantly to I.in
 Shaoqi, who was purged by Mao, and to then-Premier
 Zhou Fnlai. Zhao fell in 1967 along with Liu and
 Tao.

 Figure 1. Zhao (extreme right)
 listens as Hu Yaobang talks to
 Chen Yun (L) and Deng Xiao-
 ping (R) during the Sixth Ple-
 num in June 1981. Li Xiannian
 is reading a party document in
 Some Chinese have told US academics that Zhao
 enjoyed the personal friendship of Zhou Enlai. Al-
 though a close relationship cannot be documented,
 Zhao's rehabilitation in 1971 when Zhou was begin
 ping to rebuild the party indicates, at the least, a
 respect for his abilities. Zhao's transfer from Inner
 Mongolia to Guangdong in 1973, and his reappoint-
 ment as first secretary the following year, also indi-
 cate high standing with Zhou.
 Deng Xiaoping
 Zhao's history of appointments put him within the
 outer circle of Deng Xiaoping's associates. When
 Zhao became China's youngest first secretary in
 1965, Deng would have approved the choice in his
 capacity as general secretary. After returning to
 power in 1973, Deng assumed responsibility for day-
 to-day management of the State Council and he
 probably joined in approving Zhao's appointments in
 Guangdong.
 Deng does not seem to have been Zhao's patron,
 however, and Zhao's career indicates other leaders
 have not identified him as Deng's man. Zhao was not
 purged with Deng in 1966 or 1976 and was rehabili-
 tated in 1971 before Deng. Nor does Zhao seem to
 have a deep-rooted personal loyalty to him. In the
 anti-Deng campaign that followed Deng's 1976 purge,
 for instance, Zhao kept a low profile but voiced pro
 forma criticism. Deng's staunchest supporters avoided
 criticizing their leader, and Deng's closest ally, Hu
 Yaobang, disappeared from public view.
 Whatever their personal relationship, there is mutual
 respect, and Deng and Zhao have shown through their
 statements and actions that they agree on reforming
 China's party, government, and economy. Deng prob-
 ably was instrumental in transferring Zhao from
 Guangdong to Sichuan, Deng's home province, in
 1975. Under Zhao's guidance, Sichuan quickly be-
 came a testing ground for controversial economic
 policies that stressed market forces and material
 incentives. Zhao's successes in Sichuan helped Deng
 define his strategy for economic modernization and
 refute proposals by Hua Guofeng and other Politburo
 members who favored a more doctrinaire approach to
 economic development
 Beginning in 1979 Zhao received rapid promotions
 that we do not believe could have been possible
 without Deng's support. Zhao moved from alternate
 membership on the Politburo to full membership in
 that year. In 1980 he was elevated to the Politburo
 standing committee and the premiership, and the
 following year he became a party vice chairman. We

 Secret
 believe it possible that Zhao may not have been
 Deng's first choice for these posts in every case,
 especially the premiership. There were other leaders
 much closer to Deng with records comparable to
 Zhao's, such as Vice Premier Wan Li. But Zhao's
 distance from Deng probably made him more accept-
 able to the other members of the Politburo standing
 committee, who were nervous about Deng's campaign
 to unseat Hua. We believe Zhao ideally suited Deng's
 needs at the time  a candidate with broad support in
 the party who would not appear to be solely carrying
 out a vendetta for Deng and whose ability was
 superior to the hapless Hua.
 If Deng does not have the strong personal commit-
 ment to Zhao that he has to Hu Yaobang, Deng
 might be inclined to sacrifice Zhao to save flu. We
 believeZhao's close identification with the reform
 program makes him the natural scapegoat if the
 government reorganization and economic policies fal-
 ter and come under heavy political attack.
 Party Conservatives
 We believe Zhao enjoys good relations with party
 Vice Chairmen Ye Jianying, 85, and Li Xiannian, 77,
 frequent opponents of Deng. As an official in Guang-
 dong in the I 950s and I960s, Zhao would have come
 to the attention of both men, who were ranking
 officials in the party bureau that supervised the
 Central-South region. Ye, moreover, is a native of
 Guangdong and has taken an active interest in its
 politics over the years.
 We believe Ye and Li may have been Zhao's principal
 backers when he was made an alternate member of
 the Politburo at the 1 1 th Party Congress in 1977.
 That meeting officially returned Deng to power after
 his 1976 disgrace, and, because he was just back,
 Deng probably was not strong enough to appoint
 Politburo members of his choosing; Hu, for instance,
 did not gain a Politburo seat for another 16 months.
 Ye and Li's sponsorship would also help explain how
 Deng later persuaded the two to accept Zhao as a
 replacement for Premier Hua Guofeng, whom Ye and
 Li had sided with on a number of issues. Ye's relaxed
 attitude toward Zhao's elevation contrasts sharply
 with his hostility to Hu Yaobang's later replacement
 of Hua as party chairman.
 Today, however, areas of disagreement between Ye
 and Li on the one hand and Zhao Ziyang on the other
 are easier to discern than agreement. Ye and Li
 represent the conservative forces in the party who are
 Li and Zhao's differences focus on economic policy.
 Throughout his career, Li has been an advocate of a
 Soviet-style central bureaucracy and a development
 strategy that stresses heavy industry; Zhao has
 pushed for a decentralization of economic decision-
 25X1
 25X1
 making and more investment in light industry. Zhao's
 reorganization of the government bureaucracy to    25X1
 make it more responsive to market forces and reduce
 waste and inefficiency reduced the influence of those 25X1
 who share Li's views.) 25X1
 Chen Yuri
 Another important relationship for Zhao is with Vice
 Chairman Chen Yun, 77, wh.
 is second only to Deng in prestige within the party and
 is China's leading economic policy maker. Like Deng
 and Hu, Zhao has taken pains to curry his favor, and
 he has Chen's confidence.
 Chen and Zhao agree on economic development strat-
 egy  reduced emphasis on heavy industry, stress on
 light industry, and creation of a more consumer-
 oriented economy  but they have differed over the
 pace and scope of this "readjustment."
 the Chinese media indicate Zhao is eager
 to press forward, but Chen fears that too abrupt a
 departure from central planning will lead to economic
 chaos and derail the reform program altogether. Since

 The Military
 Zhao Ziyang has had few direct dealings with the
 PLA. His government responsibilities include aspects
 of the defense budget, but he is not in the chain of
 command nor is he a member of the party's Military
 Commission.
 We believe Zhao's efforts to reform agriculture and to
 supervise the shift in the economy away from heavy
 industry may have strained his relations with the
 PLA, but direct evidence is lacking. According to
 press analysis, there was con-
 siderable agitation within army ranks in 1980 over the
 establishment of new agricultural responsibility sys-
 tems, because soldiers perceived that their families
 would be penalized while they were in the service.
 Special measures were devised subsequently to meet
 this concern. The shift in the economy toward con-
 sumer production also forced some defense plants to
 suspend production or to manufacture consumer
 goods instead, and this may have stirred some military
 resentment toward Zhao.
 Zhao has made efforts to accommodate military
 interests. In January, for example, he made a publicly
 reported visit to a unit of the Beijing Garrison, where
 he praised the PLA stating, "the party Central Com-
 mittee and people are very much satisfied." He
 concluded by noting how many soldiers were from
 rural areas and reminding them of the overall prosper-
 ity the new agricultural responsibility system was
 bringing to the countryside.
 Hu Yaobang
 Zhao seems to have a good working relationship with
 Hu Yaobang. They have divided their areas of respon-
 sibility along party-government lines, and there are no
 reports of conflict between the two. They frequently
 make joint public appearances to project an image of
 team players who will manage smoothly the important
 transition from the revolutionary generation to that of
 the less heroic but more technically competent succes-
 sors.
 Our analysis of their speeches and statements shows
 that Hu and Zhao generally agree on the major issues
 before the leadership and have similar views on the
 kind of China they want to build. They share a belief
 in the need to reduce party interference in everyday
 life and, correspondingly, to increase the role of a
 limited form of democracy at basic levels, although
 we believe Hu is much more closely identified with
 this view in the public mind. They argue for collective
 leadership and increased adherence to law rather than
 the whims of an individual leader. They expect to use
 foreign economic, scientific, and technical infusions to
 advance China's modernization, but within a general
 context of Chinese self-reliance.
 In our view, differences between the two men's back-
 grounds and styles, however, could lead to policy
 frictions especially after Deng leaves. Zhao has had
 extensive administrative experience in the provinces,
 while Hu has served primarily in the central party
 bureaucracy. Hu does not share Zhao's good relations
 with party conservatives, while Zhao is not as close as
 Hu to Deng. Hu generally has a more liberal and
 iconoclastic image, especially in the politically sensi-
 tive areas of ideology and culture. Zhao has a reputa-
 tion for compromise and accommodation, while Hu
 shares Deng's well-deserved reputation for confronta-
 tion.
 Proteges
 In a striking anomaly for a senior Chinese leader,
 evidence suggests that Zhao has not yet cultivated a
 loyal following within the party and state bureaucra-
 cies. A small number of cabinet and subcabinet
 officials in Beijing have career associations with
 Zhao, but they are fewer and far less influential than
 central officials who have ties to Hu. During the
 central government reorganization that Zhao directed
 last spring, moreover, he placed only one known,
 longtime personal associate in the State Council

 Standing Committee, Secretary General Du Xing-
 yuan. Even the secretary responsible for party affairs
 within the organs of the State Council, a position
 ordinarily assumed by the premier's man, is filled by
 an associate of Hu Yaobang.
 Zhao's history suggests no interest in building a
 personal empire. Evidence is sketchy, but our review
 of his career fails to establish a pattern of Zhao
 promoting individuals and then taking them along
 when he switched jobs, a common practice in China.
 When he moved from Guangdong to Sichuan, for
 instance, he did not transfer any identifiable disciples,
 although he had the opportunity to do so. The same
 was true when he moved to Beijing.
 This characteristic might disadvantage Zhao both in
 leadership power plays and policy implementation
 outside the narrow confines of agricultural and indus-
 trial policy where Zhao's influence is strong. Even
 Zhou Enlai, who served as a model faithful minister
 to Mao for four decades, promoted and protected an
 identifiable group that could be relied on to do his
 bidding. There is no hard evidence on this point, but
 Zhao may calculate that his approach has served him
 well in the past and that his political success is in part
 due to his nonthreatening image and an ability to
 work with everyone. Zhao may discover, however,
 that this tactic works better when one is down in the
 pecking order and has friends above than when one is
 near the top and responsible for implementing contro-
 versial policies.
 Economic Issues
 Zhao's approach to issues is essentially nonidcologi-
 cal. In 1979 he said the key to progress "lies in our ef-
 forts to emancipate our thinking in a bold way, to
 carry out reform with determination, to make new
 inventions with courage and to break with the cco-   25X1
 fetter the development of the productive force.
 This open-minded approach has the political utility of
 permitting him to compromise and adapt. After defi-  25X1
 tits, inflation, and some social instability caught the
 party by surprise in late 1980, for example, the
 implementation of new reforms took a back seat to

 Zhao has a reputation
 among Chinese as an effective advocate of his reform
 policies.                              the Premier
 is respected because he only speaks when he has
 something substantial to say. Zhao has also acquired
 a reputation as a bold economic innovator
 although he never attended
 college and is not a trained economist, Zhao gained
 the respect of even veteran economists by his willing-
 ness to listen and his capacity for tireless work. It
 remains difficult for us to assess Zhao's ability to hold
 his own in high-level party debate, however, because
 Deng Xiaoping still stands behind Zhao's policies,
 giving his words weight that might otherwise be
 lacking.
 Agriculture. Zhao made his first mark as an agricul-
 tural expert and the policies he instituted in Sichuan
 were subsequently used by reformers in Beijing to
 help promote their program nationwide. These poli-
 cies included allowing a larger role for private plots,
 free markets, and sideline occupations, practices once
 regarded as "capitalistic." In essence this was a return
 to policies instituted by Liu Shaoqi and Chen Yuri in
 the early 1960s, after the disastrous Great Leap
 Forward. In any case, Sichuan under Zhao went from
 a net grain importing province to an exporter.
 Our analysis of speeches and statements by Zhao
 shows that he generally favors loosening government
 controls on agriculture, including disbanding the com-
 mune system, which often destroyed incentive and
 added layers of nonproductive bureaucracy. He is a
 strong backer of the new agricultural responsibility
 system, which allows individual households to have
 more control over the land they farm--including the
 choice of crops  and ensures a farmer that his income
 will increase with his productivity.
 Industry. Zhao takes the same nonideological ap-
 proach to industrial development, and his speeches
 and statements reflect a belief in the need for major
 reform of the way China does business.

 the institute had four principles: decentral-
 ization, profit, greater reliance on market forces, and
 enhanced autonomy for enterprises. Zhao also took
 for himself the post of Minister-in-Charge of the
 State Commission for Restructuring the Economic
 System when he reorganized the government in May.
 In his Sichuan experiments, Zhao initially authorized
 six enterprises to retain a share of their profits, which
 they could use for new equipment, workers' bonuses,
 and welfare projects for the workers. He permitted
 bank loans to small private businesses and allowed
 enterprises to sell on the open market output that

 Secret
 exceeded their quotas. After a trip to Yugoslavia in
 1978, where he was much impressed by its economic
 reforms, Zhao expanded the program. The tax struc-
 ture was changed, allowing selected state-owned en-
 terprises to retain a larger share of annual production
 increases. Inefficient enterprises were to be closed or
 allowed to fail.
 To the leadership's chagrin, the industrial experi-
 ments when applied nationally added to China's prob-
 lems with deficits, inflation, and unemployment. Bud-
 get deficits, worsened by reforms that permitted local
 officials to devise their own investment plans, were a
 major concern. In a nationally publicized speech in
 early 1980 to a Sichuan provincial gathering, Zhao
 pointed to other problems as well. Zhao specifically
 cited increased corruption as government controls
 were relaxed, shortages and wasteful duplication re-
 sulting from enterprises concentrating on high-profit
 goods and avoiding low-profit necessities, and bonus
 payments to workers that did not discriminate against
 poor performers.
 Zhao has now stated publicly that it will not be
 possible to decentralize the industrial sector as quickly
 or completely as once thought, and he told former
 President Ford in early 1981 that it will be necessary
 to balance the budget before pushing forward with
 reforms. Zhao has also stated that China must be-
 conic more adept at using fiscal and monetary le-
 vers--taxes, prices, wages, and banking-before de-
 centralization can be effective. He has singled out
 China's illogical price structure, with its subsidies that
 distort costs and production, as a special bottleneck,
 but has admitted it will have to be adjusted very
 gradually, primarily to stem inflation of consumer
 staples and prevent excess production of high-priced
 goods.
 more concerned than Zhao about the social costs of
 major reforms and the economic dislocations that
 might arise from a larger role for market forces
 In achieving his modus viivendi with Chen, Zhao has
 demonstrated tact and skill. In speeches, such as the
 one he gave this spring at a national economic
 conference, he echoes Chen, admitting that "it is
 necessary... to strengthen the guidance of state plan-
 ning and administrative intervention," but he is also
 careful to keep alive his longer term plans for reform.
 Thus, we believe the Premier is confident that time is
 on his side, and that when Chen dies and after the
 readjustment period, the leadership will be more
 prepared to accept the costs of the reforms
 Government Reorganization
 Zhao also has built a reputation as an effective
 bureaucratic reformer. He has overseen the massive
 reorganization of the central state bureaucracy that
 began in early 1982, and is closely identified with its
 goals: a streamlined bureaucracy: clear lines of au-
 thority; accountability of officials; younger, more
 competent, and better educated men in responsible
 positions.
 Despite his public image, however, we do not believe
 Zhao was the force behind the reorganization. Before
 his speech on the subject in December 1981, he
 displayed no special interest in the subject. His failure
 to place a significant number of followers in high
 positions and the strength of the showing by Hu
 Yaobang's followers in the reorganization cast further
 doubt on the possibility that Zhao initiated the
 shakeup. We believe it more likely that the reorgani-
 zation was done at Deng's bidding, in part to remove
 his political opponents.

 Zhao's change of heart also reflects changes in the
 political situation during 1980-81, in particular the
 increased influence of Chen Yuri in economic affairs.
 While Chen and Zhao agree on the need for reform,
 including a larger role for market forces, Chen places
 a heavier stress on the role of central planning in his
 writings and speeches than Zhao. Chen also seems

 Social Issues
 Since the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976, the
 latitude granted Chinese dissidents and intellectuals
 in discussing Mao and the regime has been a sensitive
 issue. In general, the reform group around Deng has
 taken a more relaxed attitude toward intellectuals
 than do party conservatives and the military. Partly in
 response to pressure from the latter groups and partly
 out of genuine distaste for some of the activities of the
 dissidents and intellectuals, Deng has overseen a
 gradual narrowing of the scope for dissent since 1979.
 Zhao has tended to follow the consensus within the
 reform leadership and has not taken a leading role on
 this issue. In our view, he may believe that the regime
 In his public statements Zhao has dwelt on the need
 to promote intellectuals in the narrow sense of trained
 bureaucrats and technicians. He is in the forefront of
 those calling for high professional standards for party
 membership and government advancement. He comes
 down firmly on the "expert" side of the old "red
 versus expert" debate.
 In an interview with a Japanese journalist in 1981,
 Zhao expressed views on youth disaffection that are in
 keeping with his overall approach to problem solving.
 He said, "What is more important than education is
 to show them that if the modernization policy is
 implemented correctly things will inevitably turn bet-
 ter. We have to persuade the youth by the results of
 modernization."
 Foreign Policy
 Zhao is not known to have traveled outside China
 until he was 59. His first meetings with visiting
 dignitaries were often dry recitations of detailed
 economic policy. Nonetheless he impressed some visi-
 tors as a refreshing break from more dogmatic lead-
 ers, conveying a "touch of class" lacking in former
 Premier Hua Guofeng. Zhao's dignified bearing and
 trim appearance are said by some Chinese to be more
 appealing than Hu Yaobang's fidgety, excessively
 self-effacing style.

 In general, Zhao seems to us to understand China's
 limited influence in world affairs and prefers to
 concentrate on economic development. He is publicly
 associated with those party reformers who want China
 to keep an "open door" to foreign trade and technol-
 ogy, and he has invested considerable personal pres-
 tige in the newly established Special Economic Zones,
 where foreign involvement is encouraged. This distin-
 guishes him from the strong forces within the party
 pressing to minimize China's links to the outside
 world
 Zhao has not taken a personal position on relations
 with the United States or on Taiwan. He has stuck
 closely to the official line in discussing both subjects

 publicly articulated a new formulation of the princi-
 ples of Chinese foreign policy that drew China back
 somewhat from its close public association with the
 United States and identified it more closely with
 Third World concerns. Presumably if he strongly
 disapproved of this adjustment, Zhao would have

 Deng has spoken of Zhao and Hu as a team that will
 surmount China's recurrent and debilitating succes-
 sion crises. Like the traditional emperor and his
 faithful minister, they are expected to complement
 each other, providing stability at the top that will
 foster China's progress. China's history, however,
 contains more tales of conflict than of concord be-
 tween an emperor and his minister, and once Deng is
 gone his plans could go awry. We fully expect
 conservative interests within the party will attempt to
 divide Hu and Zhao.
 It is our view, however, that Zhao would be unlikely
 to make a naked grab for power from Hu. Thus far
 Zhao has demonstrated extraordinary deference to
 Deng and Hu. If Hu were to stumble badly then Zhao
 might be persuaded to step into the breach in the
 interest of leadership stability and policy continuity.
 But Zhao's limited power base within the Party would
 require the support of other major figures in a
 collective leadership just to survive. In the transition
 period, Zhao would have to subordinate himself to a
 new strongman or be pushed aside. Indeed, his record
 suggests he would be inclined to return to the role of
 the good minister.
 Strengths...
 Zhao would enter a succession battle with strengths
 that are more apparent than real. He has a dynamic
 style and personality, attributes commonly cited by
 Chinese observers including both officials and ordi-
 nary people who frequently praise Zhao's polished
 appearance and no-nonsense workstyle. Since becom-
 ing premier he has traveled throughout China in an
 unprepossessing fashion, which suits the popular mood
 for less ostentation and more hard work from the
 Zhao also has a record as a capable administrator
 with a talent for organization. His ability to work with
 all elements of the present leadership may make him
 an ideal compromise candidate if someone challenges
 Hu. Compromise candidates, however, historically
 have not fared well in the long run: Hua Guofcng was

 ... and Weaknesses.
 Zhao is a relative newcomer to national-level politics.
 He lacks what is crucial in party struggles  a long-
 standing personal following in the capital                                                                              and he has
 done surprisingly little to cultivate one. We believe
 that unless he works hard to establish a personal
 power base among the recently promoted officials, he
 could find himself without backing.
 Zhao is also accountable for the economy. The con-
 tinuing need to adjust economic policies has already
 increased the use of political and legal strictures as a
 substitute for material incentives. If economic circum-
 stances force cuts in popular programs or a decline in
 living standards, we believe some of Zhao's personal
 popularity and his rcputation as an especially capable
 official will suffer.
