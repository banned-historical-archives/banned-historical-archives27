The decision to drop murder 
charges against eight Geen 
0 Berets 
accused of 
"eliminating" 
Vietnamese 
triple-agent Thai Khac Chuyen 
in June 1969 was "approved" 
by President Nixon after the 
/ Central Intelligence Agency 
refused to provide witnesses 
for the court-martial. 
The official word came from 
Secretary of the Army Stanley 
R. Resor in September who 
said, "in the interest of 
national security it is my 
judgment that under the cirs 
cumstances, the defendants 
. cannot receive a fair trial."

charges. He later 
acknowledged, however, that

even thinking of making the 
Army a career ? until he 
received orders to. report to 
Ft. Riley, Kansas. 
"When I saw those orders I 
was furious," he said. '71 guess 
I was more sore than anything 
because the Army was putting 
me in a shelf job. They were 
its own. hiding mc." 
The press secretary said / Marasco went to Washing-
CIA Chief Richard Helms ton. lo his original assignment 
decided that the agency's branch, and put in his papers 
employes would not be allowed 
to testify for reasons of 
national security. 
'77- "The President," Ziegler 
said, "approved the decision." 
"We were released on Sept. 
30, 1969," former Capt. Robert 
F. Marasco said. "And we 
received VIP treatment all the 
, way home." 
"They were all crying," 
; Marasco recalled. "My wife, 
I my first wife, wasn't there. 
She was afraid of the news 
media. She was afraid they 
would ask her what she 
thought and that she would 
have to tell the truth." 
Mt rasco's first wife -- -- he 
has since remarried --- was 
deeply involved in the anti-war 
movement, he said. 
"She would not lie to the 
press," Marasco said. "She. 
would have told them what-
she thought of the war, the 
military . . ." 
The couple later discussed 
their problems and it was 
agreed that they would file for-
a Mexican divorce. 
Friends and neighbors, how-
ever, treated the Green Bei et 
with all the honors due to a 
homecoming hero. 
Maraaeo said the Chuyen 
Resor, after rioting that the 
Berets would be assigned to 
dirties "outside of Vietnam'," 
went on record as 
approving "the act which the 
Green Berets were accused o f 
carrying out. 
, ''l want to make it clear." 
he said, "that the acts which 
tt ere charged, but not proven, 
ta present a fundatitental 
?iolation of Army regulations, 
orders and principles. The 
Army will not and cannot

Preys Secretary Ronald 
to leave active duty. 
"They told me I had to wait 
seven months," he recalled. 
Meanwhile, Marasco 
received word that Rep. L. 
Mendel Rivers, chairman of 
the House Armed Services 
Committee, wanted to meet 
, with h.m. 
"He asked me if there was 
anythieg be could do,"

wanted out of the .artny." 
Rivers. Marasco said, called 
Gen. William \l'estmoreland, 
who was then Army chief of 
staff, and on Oct. 14, 1069 he 
was honorably discharged.

Mit arasco's problems 
were not over. 
St-I:cant weeks later he flew

and crashed heati-on into 
Alarasco's car. 
The driver of the second car 
was killed. Marasco suffered 
extensive injuries and was in a 
coma for three drys at Perth 
Amboy General Hospital. A 
passenger in his car also 
suffered extensive injuries. 
There were unofficial 
reports that the accident 
"could have been arranged." 
Marasco discounts those 
reports. 
"I guess there were always 
possibilities," he said. "There 
were anti-war people, and I'm 
not talking about student 
groups. There are some very 
big international organizations 
who oppose the ? war for 
political reasons." 
Marasco said he has no 
evidence that the accident was 
planned. 
"I had a private investigator 
look into it," he said. "He 
found nothing unusual. The 
mishap was sheer 
coincidence." 
An insurance settlement of 
$10,000 just about paid for 
hospital and other medical 
bills. Marasco was out of work 
for more than a year. 
"I sold a little insurance," 
he said. "I am` now vice 
president of my father's 
agency in Bloomfield. but I 
don't know what the future 
holds for me." 
Insurance is what he knows 
best, "outside of espionage, 
and there is not a very 
good market in that field for 
me because my picture. has 
been on the front pages all . 
over the world." 
Marasco says today he has 
no ill feelings about the Army. 
"I talked with a great many 
military men and they all feel 
that I got a raw deal," he 
said. "I do have some very 
strong feelings about Gen..

Marasco's cell was four by

continuously, and the average

Abrams, Marasco said,

to handle the case. 
The exchange, Marasco 
said, occurred iii September,

said. ''But it didn't seem

Marasco said. Smith "was not 
agreeing that he (Chuyen) 
should he eliminated. He was 
not disagreeing, either. He had 
no alternative, hut he had a 
special feeling for Chuyen." 
Marasco said Smith 
"became very nervous of

recently buried his mother in 
Florida and had become quite 
neurotic in Vtetnam. 
"He had decided that

Approved For Release 200110J/u4 : C 19I -RDP80-016 
By Richard E. Ward 
Second. of a series 
Clandestine sabotage, combat and 
espionage missions have been conducted in 
Laos and Cambodia by U.S. military per- - 
sonnel, despite White House denials and 
contrary to congressional prohibition. 
Such missions are top-secret actions 
directed by the Studies and , Observations 
Group of the U.S. Army Military Assistance 
Command, Vietnam, located in Saigon and 
'generally known by its initials, MAC-V 
SOG. The most comprehensive picture of 
these activities available, based on testimony 
of former participants in these missions, 
known as Cornmand and Control operations, 
is contained in a series of three articles by 
Gerald Meyer, published in the Nov. 5, 10 
and 12 issues of the St. Louis Post Dispatch. 
Unless otherwise indicated all material in 
this.artiele is based on the articles by Meyer, 
a regular staff member of the Post Dispatch, 
who interviewed former Special Forces 
members, helicopter pilots and others who. 
took part in the Command and Control 
operations during the 1960s and into 1972. 
The Post Dispatch's informants, whose 
names were not revealed to protect them 
from possible prosecution, stated that the 
clandestine commando raids were still in 
progress as of August. One informant said 
? that in August when he left Bien Hoa, one of 
? the Command and Control bases, more than 
teo Army Special Forces were stationed 
there and reinforcements were being sent 
from Okinawa. 
? The commando raids in recent years, 
utilizing Army personnel who generally 
command teams composed of mercenaries 
? from Laos, Cambodia and South Vietnam, 
were also sent into North Vietnam and 
liberated areas of South Vietnam. There is 
evidence that the Air Force has operational 
'jurisdiction over a similar program based at 
Nakon Phajon, Thailand,_iust .a.c TOSS the 
Laotian bat 
Rproved For Release 
Commando raids were ordered by 
Washington against the Democratic 
'Republic of Vietnam in the early 1960's, as 
documented in the Pentagon Papers,. but 
which provided few details. The present 
program, apparently undergoing a partial 
"Vietnamization," is an outgrowth of the. 
original escalation of CIA-Special Forces 
missions in Indochina ordered by the 
Kennedy administration. 
Although the Post Dispatch does not 
mention the CIA, it is clear that Studies and 
Observations Group is a CIA operation. The 
informant most knowledgeable about SOG, 
a Special Forces officer, was described by 
correspondent Meyer as fearful of being 
jailed or fined, saying: "If I talked to you and 
got 'caught, I could get 10 years in prison and 
a $10,000 fine." 
The Special Forces officer said that the 
connections between Command and Control 
and the 'MAC-V SOG' organization in 
Saigon were so highly classified that we 
would not risk commenting on them," wrote 
Meyer. 
Despite his reluctance to talk the officer 
explained that the Command and Control 
operations were "formally" under the 
direction of the Fifth Special Forces Group 
until January 1971, when the Fifth Special 
Forces officially was described as having 
been withdrawn from Vietnam. Actually, 
according to Meyer, "numerous Fifth 
Special Forces were left behind at Command 
and Control bases throughout South 
Vietnam" and various efforts were employed 
to conceal their continued presence. They 
were forbidden to wear the green beret and 
.Special Forces insignia while they remained 
in Indochina. .. ? 
Symbolic of the Command and Control 
operations, was a gestapo-like insignia, used 
ty one of the units, a green-bereted .skull 
with blood dripping from its teeth. This was 
the emblem of Command and Control 
Central. There were at least two other main 
units, Command and Control North and 
Command and Control South. The North, 
Central and South referred to the base areas 
of the commando teams. 
Apparently most of the operations under 
the Command and Control program, at least 
in recent years, took place in southern Laos. 
However, after the U.S.-Saigon invasion of 
Cambodia and subsequent Congressional 
prohibition against use of ? U.S. ground 
troops in Cambodia, it is safe to assume that 
the secret U.S. missions were increased in 
the latter country. 
Airborne bandits ? 
Typically, Command and Control missions 
comprised several U.S. officers or NCO's 
commanding a mercenary team ? which 
would land in Laos or Cambodia, and 
"aimed at taking prisoners, gathering in-
formation and disrupting communist ac-
tivities." The commandos would be tran-
sported in four helicopters, while four 
helicopter gunships would. provide air cover,

volved in missions. 
neSpeci'al'orces teran, who par-
ticipated in Command and Control raids 
from Danang, said he had taken part in 
missions in North Vietnam, Laos and 
Cambodia. "He said they were for the 
p rpose of gathering intelligence, rescuing 
ther American missions threatened by 
North Vietnamese forces, destroying 
supplies and disrupting enemy com-
munications facilities." 
Command and Control Central, operating 
put of Dakto and Kontum, near the tri-
Vborder area of South Vietnam and Laos and 
Cambodia was used for raids deep within 
the two latter countries. 
"A Special Forces soldier formerly 
assigned to Command and Control Central 
said that the group's missions were handled 
by about 150 Americans and from 30Q to 400 
Montagnard tribesmen. Men participating in 
missions first were transported to Dakto and 
then sent by helicopter across the borders, 
he said. 
"The missions were rotated among the 
men and casualties were severe, the man 
said.... Such teams usually included two or 
three American leaders and about half a 
dozen Montagnards. 
"Dakto was the starting point also for 
large 'hatchet forces,' with larger numbers of 
Americans and Montagnards. . ? . 
"Less frequently?apparently only about 
once every six months?very large groups of 
Americans were sent across the borders on 
so-called Slam (Search, locate and an-
nihilate) missions. More than 100 men 
sometimes participated in such missions.... 
"Some penetrations into Laos apparently 
were quite deep. Both the Special Forces ' 
(two of Meyer's informants) said the U.S: 
operated a radio relay station on a mountain 
top about 30 miles inside Laos. 
'This station, called the 'Eagle's Nest,' was 
used to transmit messages between South 
Vietnam and Command and Control teams 
operating beyond the mountain top in the 
Laotian countryside." 
The radio station, whose _exact location 
was not specified, could have been located 
near the Bolovens plateau, in Southern Laos, . 
where the Pathet Lao told this correspon-
dent in 1970 there was a secret U.S. base.

North Vietnam in Novem-
ber, 1970.) 
Scattered Around 
Though there are plenty' 
of toughly skilled . Ameri-
cans in Sbuth Vietnam to 
mount such raids if the 
chance arises, they are 
'scattered among many 
Units. There are also small 
outfits ? like Navy seal 
.teams?available for such 
things, but they are not 
specifically trained and 
kept in readiness for pris-
oner rescue grabs.. 
Consequently the stand-
down of the secret prison-
er rescue group has stirred 
heated words within the 
headquarters of U.S. Gen. 
Creighton W. Abrams. 
Abrams, who has an ill-
concealed suspicion Of the 
value of elite units super-
imposed on the Army's reg-
ular structure, has repor-
tedly resisted arguments 
to go lightly on the with-
drawal of such outfits. 
some operations of this 
type took place. 
Not Many Captives 
One reason the unit has 
few successes ,to its credit 
is that it was used sparing-
ly and under the strictest 
limitations. To avoid en-
dangering the lives of any 
captives with "fishing ex-
peditions." special raids 
were ordered only when 
intelligence turned up 
hard and immediate infor-
mation on the location of 
Viet Cong POW camps. 
Thus, while the unit had 
few successes it could 
equally boast few failures 
in the sense of botched or 
sloppy efforts. - 
The number of Ameri-
can captives in Viet Cong 
camps is also very small. 
Casualty figures list.. 463 
Americans missing in 
South Vietnam. The Unit-
ed States claims 78 of 
these were known from 
various sources to have 
been alive at the time of 
their capture and were 
consequently listed as 
war prisoners. Of these, 
however, only 20, have

? The withdrawal, 
however, underscores the 
unpublicized decline in all 
eland estine operations 
which has paralleled the 
pullout of regular troops. 
eseasagownen a su 
sidiary unit known as the 
B-57 Detachment precipi-
tated what became known 
as the Green Beret case. 
That case ? which in-
volved the execution of a 
suspected double agent?
blew the cover on how ex-
tensive clandestine opera-
tions had grown in South 
Vietnam. It also caused a 
number of heads to roll 
within the U.S. establish-
ment and resulted in a 
general hunkering down 
,CIA Cutback ? of cloak-and-dagger types. 
This actually hega

its involvement in 
many programs. Part of 
this was caused by 
Abrams, who disliked hav-
ing Army types under CIA 
command as was the case 
in several areas. At any 
rate, the CIA began to 
withdraw, provincial 
agents from the Phoenix 
program?aimed at root-

Cong "Phantom govern-
ment" officials?and quit 
funding (and controlling) 
such programs as the

Tau which turned out

Though the CIA's tenta-
cles still reach all the sen-
sitive areas of control in 
South Vietnam, the em-
phasis now is less on 
"operational" areas and 
more on pure intelligence 
gathering.

probably be sharply di-' 
minished within the next 
several months when the 
troop withdrawal program 
enters its final phase. 
Paralleling t h e s e de-
clines in the "secret war' 
is the increased use of sen-
sors and computers re-
quiring fewer men in the 
field and more brainpower 
at headquarters. 
Long-range patrols into

law offices and univer-
sities had gained their 
spurs in London, where they were sent 
to glean some of the methods of the 
British Secret Intelligence Service. 
Dulles enjoyed making wisecracks 
? about the Victorian and Indian Army 
traditions still surviving in the British 
secret service, but he had a healthy 
respect for its unrivalled experience 
and great professionalism. He knew 
that CIA could learn a lot from the 
British about operations in the Middle 
'East and Africa, where its stations 
were rapidly expanding. 
.7 After Archibald Roosevelt, one of 
4. CIA's foremost "Arabists", had re-
stored cordial relations with SIS when 
station head in London, a plan of co-
pperation was devised for Africa, where 
most of the former British colonies had 
gained independence, and were be-
coming subject to strong Soviet and 
Chinese pressure. Roosevelt was still 
in London when, in 1965, Rhodesia 
made her momentous "Unilateral 
. Declaration of Independence" (UDI), 
which led to the conflict with the 
British Government. 
? 
There is no better instance of the 
strengthening of CIA-SIS collabora-
tion than the hitherto undisclosed 
story of the services CIA rendered 
the British authorities in Rhodesia, 
particularly since about 1968. 
Indeed, in assisting the British SIS 
" in its thankless task of implementing 
the policy of economic sanctions 
against the Smith regime, CIA put its 
relations with the Portuguese in 
jeopardy. It has an enduring under-

supposed to watch the steady flow of 
Rhodesian pig-irm, tobacco, and other 
products through the Portuguese ports

Africa to Europe and the Far East. 
Merchants and shippers there ?had 
made fortunes out of the traffic which 
the Portuguese were bound, by United 
Nations resolutions and agreements 
with Britain, to regard as illegal. 
After the closure of British missions 
in Salisbury all information about 
Rhodesian exports dried up at source. 
At this juncture CIA stepped in to 
assist the British. It was not merely a 
labour of love. American tobacco

The CIA agent's were perpetually

Rhodesian tobacco was used for cigar

When these supplies dried 'up, Euro-

exports began to flow again, by the 
use of false certificates of origin and 
smuggling through the Portuguese 
ports and through Durban in South 
Africa, much' tothe displeasure of the 
Americans. 
Thus, obliging the British and help-

its agents to ferret out the secrets of the 
sanction-busting schemes devised by 
Mr Ian Smith's regime. Soon the CIA

Just how valid are ,the charges against the Central intelligence Agency? What 
guarantees do Americans have that it is under tighLcontrol? A pint-by-point de-
fense of the:organization comes from a man v,rho served in top posts for 13 years. 
V.E7 
Following is an analysis of intelligence operations 
.? by Lyman Ii. Kirkpatrick, Jr., former executive direc-
tor-comptroller of. ihe Central Intelligence Agency: 
The Central Intelligence Agency was created by. the Na-
tional Security Act of 3.017 as an independent agency in the 
executive branch of the United .States Government, report-
ing to the President. Ever since that date it has been sub-
jected to criticism both at home and abroad,: for what it has 
allegedly done as well as for what it 'has faded to do. 
Our most cherished freedoms are those of speech and the 
press and the right to protest. It is not only a right, but an 
? obligation of citizenship to be critical of our institutions, and 
no organization .can be immtine from scrutiny. It is necessary 
that criticism be responsible, objective a?d constructive. 
It should be recognized that as' Americans we have an 
inherent mistrust of anything secret: The unknown is always 
a worry. We distrust the powerful. A secret organization de-
sexibed as powerful must appear as most dangerous of all. 
It was my responsibility for my last 12 years with the CIA 
?fh?st as inspector general, then as executive director-
comptroller?to insure that all responsible criticisms of the 
CIA were properly and thoroughly examined. and, when 
-required., remedial action taken. I am confident this practice 
has been followed by my .suceessors, not because of any - 
direct knowledge, but bccatise the present Director of Cen-
tral Intelligence was my respected friend and colleague for 
more than two decades, and this is how he operates, : 
It is with this aS background that I comment on die cur-
Tent allegations, none of which are original with this critic: but, 
'any of which should be of concern to any American citizen. 
CIA and The Intelligence System Is Too Big. 
This raises the questions of how much we are willing to 
pay for national security, and how much is enough. 
First, .what arc the responsibilities of the CIA and the 
other intelligence organizations of our Government? 
Very briefly, the intelligence system is charged with in-
suring that the United States learns as far in advance as pos-
sible of any potential threats to our national interests. A 
moment's contemplation will put in perspective what this ac-
tually ncans. It can range all the way from Bussian missiles 
STATINTL 
pointed at North America to threats to U. S. ships or bases, 
to expropriation of American properties, to dangers to any 
one of OM allies whom we are pledged by treaty to protect. 
It is the interface of world competition between superior 
powers. IktN, are those who have served in the intelligence 
system who have not wished that there could be some 
two of responsibilities' or some lessening of encyclopedic re-
quiremeiils about the world. It is also safe to suggest that our 
senior policy makers undoubtedly wish that their span of 
required information could be Jess and triat not every dis-
turbance in every part of the world came into their purview... 
- (Note: This should hot be interpreted as meaning that the 
U. S. means to intervene. It does. mean that when there is a

solve the dispute. It does mean that we will resist subversion 
against small, new nations. Thus the demand by U. S. policy ? 
makers that they be kept informed.) 
What this means for our intelligence system is world-
wide coverage.

with the size and cost of the intelligence system. All Admin-

? 
' Mr. Mond repeated in an interview with 
thf.. Monitor charges he first aired at a 
forum on war .crimes sponsored by the 
Vietnam Veterans Against the War- as. part 
of the congress last Saturday. 
The tall, black veteran of seven years, 
Seven months service who left the Army in 
June., 1970, after being wounded three times 
?winner of the Silver Star and three Bronze 
Stars ? struggled with his emotions as he 
told the cheering NSA delegates on Monday 
that he had "made up my mind after a year 
of deliberations to disclose this information 
because these things were part of an on-
going philosophy of ... the executive branch 
of this country." 
. Mr. Mond said that about 3,000 Chinese 
were in northern Laos when he was in 
Thailand. from June, 1069 to June, 1970, and 
that they then controlled the quarter of the 
country north of the royal capital Luang 
Prabang. ? 
The majority were engineers, building a 
north-south road from.China to Luang Pra-
bang. He said "studies indicate" that they 
hoped to push down to Vientiane, the pres-
ent provisional capital. 
Chinese infantry units were in Laos to 
protect the road builders, he added, and 
antiaircraft installations were built in Lacs 
to protect them. 
? ? 
Incursions cscyibnd? 
? 
The incursions were aimed at watching-
Chinese moverrApprovedfotReleas 
? 
He also served with the 101st Airborne in 
Vietnam. 
The former captain cited as one main 
reason for his disaffection with American 
policies the massive flood of drugs pouring 
out of Lacs into Thailand and then into the 
? 
hands of American troops. 
added "it is inconceivable that this much 
opium could be transported on American 
aircraft without their superiors knowing it." 
Mr. P.Iond said he had never personally 
witnessed such shipments. However, he 
said, that while he was in Bangkok doing 
research for his study on Thailand "I talked 
with several young Air America pilots. They 
had been helicopter or fixed-wing pilots in 
Vietnam?and they told me that the drug 
trade from Vientiane to Bangkok was vast. 
They indicated that it was being flown in. 
I took it for granted that since they were 
relating this, they had firsthand knowledge." 
While in Thailand Mr: Mend's unhappi-
ness with the drug problem led him to 
write a letter in April, 1970, to the com-
mander of U.S. Army Support Forces in 
Thailand in which he indicated that be-
tween 10 and 15 percent of the junior enlist-
drugs daily.

aged the growing of poppies, the flower frcirn'l 
which opium is made, by Montag,nard tribes-
men (on-the opium rich Plain of Jars) whom. 
the agency recruits as mercenaries. 
Hc later qualified this statement by add-
ing, "perhaps they (CIA) don't always -need ? 
to encourage them (the Montagnards) to 
grow poppies because it is so lucrative." He 
added, "But I am sure they don't discourage 
them. If they cut .off this source .of income, 
they would have to -support the tribesmen 
far beyond what they are paying them now." 
Mr. Mond also charged that the opium is 
often flown illicitly to major populations in 
Laos by Air America, a private airline said 
to be controlled by the CIA. "Opium comes 
out of the Plain of Jars catch as catch can," 
he said in an interview with the Monitor, 
"hut from Moung Suoi, a major CIA bane 
which has an airstrip, . . . I am aware that 
pilots would fly it down to Vientiane for 
their own profit."

He said he "knew" that Air America was 
flying opium from Vientiane to Udon Thant 
on the southern Lao border from where it 
would be. transported to Bangkok and per-
haps on. to the United States. He said that 
the base at UdOn had one of the biggest drug

From the beginning, the core of the tragedy in Southeast Asia 
has been the inability of Western political leaders; and par-
ticularly American political leaders, to grasp the nature . of 
insurgency in areas formerly under colonial rule, or the limita-
tions of counterinsurgency to qUell it. Accordingly, The 
Nation is devoting almost this entire isSue 'to Eqbal Ahmacrs 
essay on the subject. In somewhat different form it will be a 
chapter in his forthcoming Reaction 'and Revolution in the 
Third World (Pantheon). Mr. Ahmad is a Fellow of the Adlai 
'Stevenson Institute in Chicago. 
To write on counterinsurgency one must first explain 
what the so-called "insurgencies" really are. In the United 
States that may be difficult because for the most part the 
social scientists who write on revolutionary warfare have 
been proponents of counterinsurgency. As a result, the 
biases of incumbents are, built into the structure, images 
and language of contemporary Western, especially Amer-
ican, literature on the subject. We have come to accept 
ideologically contrived concepts and words as objective 
descriptions. 
One could, take innumerable examples?terrorism, sub-
versicni, pacification, urbanization, protective 'reaction, 
defensive interdiction, etc.--and expose the realities be-
hind these words and phrases. The term counterinsurgency 
. is itself an excellent -example. Like all coinages in this 
area, it is value-laden and misleading. In fact, counterin-
surgency is not at all directed against insurgency, which 
Webster defines as "a revolt against a government, not 
reaching the proportions of an organized revolution; and 
not recognized as belligerency." The truth is, the Congress 
and the country would be in uproarif the government were 
to claim that U.S. counterinsurgency capabilities could 
conceivably be available to its clients for putting down 
"revolts not reaching the proportions of an organized 
. revolution." The truth is the opposite: counterinsurgency 
is a multifaceted assault against organized revolutions. 
, The euphemism is not used by accident, nor from igno-
rance. It serves to conceal the reality of a foreign policy 
dedicated to combating revolutions abroad; it helps to 
:relegate ? revolutionaries to the status of outlaws. The 
reduction of a revolution to mere insurgency is also an im-
plicit denial of its legitimacy. In this article, counterin-
surgency and counterrevolution are used interchangeably. 
Analytically, counterinsurgency may be discussed in 
terms of two primary models--the conventional-estab-
lishment and the liberal-reformist; and two ancillary 
'models?the punitive-militarist and the technological-at-
tritive. I term these latter ancillary because they develop 
after the fact?from actual involvement in counterre,volu-
.tion, and from interplay between the conventional and 
liberal institutions and individuals so involved. The . 
models, though identifiable .in to =s- of the iziesasit:u2U

scope of their applicatio , 
of the agencies and individuals favoring them, are oper-
ationally integrated in the field. 1 outline them here: 
.Although monolithic in its goal of suppressing revolu-
tions; the theory and practice of counterinsurgency reflects 
the pluralism of the Western societies to which most of its 
practitioners and all of its theoreticians belong. A pluralis-
tic, bargaining political culture induces an institutionalized 
.compulsion to compromise. Within a defined boundary, 
there ,can be something for everyone.. Hence, the actual 
strategy and tactics of counterinsurgency reflect compro- ? 
mise, no one blueprint being applied in. its original, un. 
adulterated form. This give-and-take contributes to a most 
fateful phenomenon of counterrevolutionary involvement: 
groups and individuals continue to feel that their particu-
lar prescriptions were, never administered in full dosage 
and at the right .intervals. They show a tendency toward 
self-justification, a craving to continue with and improve 
their formulas for success. Severe critics of specific "blun-
ders" and "miscalculations," they still persist in seeing 
"light at the end of the tunnel." I shall return to this in 
discussing the Doctrine of Permanent Counterinsurgency. 
Set I:7,2nRc!m 
We might view the conventional establishment approach 
as constituting the common denominator of the assump-
tions and objectives shared by- all incumbents; viz., an 
a priori hostility toward revolution, the view that its ori-
gins are conspiratorial, a managerial attitude toward. it as.. 
? 
a problem, and a ?technocratic-military, approach to its 
solution.. In strategy and tactics, this approach prefers con-
ventional ground and air operations, requiring large de-
ployments of troops, search-and-destroy missions (also 
called "in op-up operations"), the tactics of "encirclement" 
and "attrition"?which involve, on the one hand, large-
military fortifications (bases, enclaves) connected by "mo-
bile" battalions (in Vietnam, helicopter-borne troops and 
air cavalry); and; on the other hand, massive, displacement 
of civilian population and the creation of free-fire zones. 
The conventionalists also evince deep longings. for set 
battles, and would multiply the occasions by forcing, sur-
prising or luring the guerrillas into conventional show-
downs. The results of these pressures are bombings .(e.g., 
North Vietnam) or invasion of enemy "sanctuaries" across 
the, frontiers of 'conflict (e.g., Cambodia) and the tactio 
of offering an occasional bait in the hope of luring the 
enemy to a concentrated attack (e.g,., Dienbienphu, Kite 
Sanh). 
If the conventional-establishment attitudes constitute 
the lowest common denominator of counterreVolution, the 
liberal-reformists are the chief exponents of its doctrine,. 
and the most sophisticated programmers of its practice.

Tlie article' tha-t foll-ows is part of The 
Planning of the Vietnam ?War, a study 
by members of the Institute of Policy 
Studies in Washington, including 
Richard J. Barnet, M'arcus Raskin, and 
Ralph Stavins.* In: their introduction 
to the study, the authors write: 
"In .early 1970, Marcus Raskin con-
ceived the. idea of a study that would 
. explain how the Vietnam disaster hap-
pened by analyzi!!g.the planning of the 
.War. A group of investigators directed 
? by Ralph Stavins concentrated on 
'finding out who did the actual plan-
.ning that led to the decisions to bomb 
:North Vietnam, to introduce over a . 
half-million troops into South Viet-
'nam, to defoliate and destroy vast 
areas of Indochina, and to create 
.,millions of refugees in: the area. 
? ?"Ralph Stavins, assisted .by Canta 
Plan. John Berkowitz, George Pipkin, 
and Brian Eden, conducted more than 
300 interviews in the course of this 
.studj. Among those interviewed 
.were many ?Presidential advisers to 
.Kennedy and Johnson, generals and, 
'admirals, middle level bureaucrats who 
. occupied strategic positions in the 
? .national security bureaucracy, and offi-
cial's, military and civilian, who carried. 
out the policy in the field in Vietnam. 
?' "A number of informants backed up 
their oral statements with documents 
. their possession, _including informal 
fiminutes of meetings, 'as well as por-
tions of the official documentary rec-
ord ? now known as the "Pentagon , 
Papers." Our information is drawn not. 
only from the Department of Defense,. 
but also from the White House, the 
Department of State, .and the Central' 
? Intelligence Agency." 
The study is being?published in two 
. volumes. The first, .which includes the, 
article below, will be published early in 
August. The second will appear in 
May, 1972. . .? ?
