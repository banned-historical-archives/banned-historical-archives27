THE DEVELUMENT OF AMERICAN INTEREST 
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, 1943-1954 
1. Emerging Guidelines of United 3tates Policy 
In a pf..ess conference on 23 February 1945 aboard the USS Quincy while 
homeward bound from a wartime conference with Prime Minister Winston S. 
Churchill and Marshal Joseph Stalin at Yalta, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
told newsmen that he had been "terribly worried" about Indochina for two 
years. Roosevelt said that the Indochinese people wanted independence from 
France but were not ready for it. In his opinion the French had done nothing 
about educating the Indochinese people, had exploited their colonial posses-
sions in Southeast Asia, and ought not to be allowed to go back into Indochina 
after the area was cleared of Japanese occupation forces. In planning for the 
postwar period, Roosevelt wanted to put the French possessions in Indochina --
the protectorates of Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia, and Laos and the colony of 
Cochin China -- under an international trusteeship in order to educate the 
Indochinese people for self-government. (1) 
In his news conference remarks, President Roosevelt suggested a potential 
line of American policy which, as he noted, had been in the making for two 
years. At a conference with Secretary of State Cordell Hull on 5 October 
1943, President Roosevelt had suggested that Indochina and the Japanese-mandated 
islands of the Pacific, along with security points in many parts of the world, 
might be placed under international trusteeship. Speaking very frankly. with 
British Ambassador Lord Halifax in January 1944, Roosevelt had regretted the 
reluctance of the British and Dutch to end their colonialism and had noted 
that the case for Indochina was very clear. "France," he said, "has milked it 
for one hundred years. The people of Indochina are entitled to something bet-
ter than that." Roosevelt told Halifax that both Marshal Stalin and 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek "wholeheartedly supported" the view that Indochina 
should be made independent. (2) 
During the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, held in the autumn of 1944 to discuss 
the formation of a new United Nations security organization, Secretary Hull was 
hopeful that he could obtain agreement whereby all mandates and colonies would 
be ceded to the new international organization, which would tutor them for 
independence. This proposal, however, was not acceptable to several colonial 
powers, and it was also resisted by the US War and Navy Departments, which 
believed that the United States would need to acquire the sovereignty over 
former Japanese mandates for use as postwar bases. Spokesmen for the US Navy 
and members of the House Naval Affairs Committee actively supported a need for 
US bases in the mandates. (3) President Roosevelt nevertheless continued to be 
particularly interested in the fate of Indochina. When Roosevelt learned that 
France proposed to send a military mission to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten's 
Allied Southeast Asia Command to consult on military operations affecting 
Indochina, he issued orders that American approval must not be given to such 
a mission and that no American representative in the Far East was authorized

to make any "decisions on political questions with the French mission or any-
one else."(4) In a session with Marshal Stalin at Yalta on 8 February 1945, 
Roosevelt explained his plan to place French Indochina under a trusteeship 
noting that the British feared the implications of such an action in Burma.(5) 
A few months later, in a personal conversation in Washington, President 
Roosevelt told US Ambassador to China; Patrick J. Hurley, that he was not 
pleased by Vichy France's cooperation with Japan and that he wanted the 
establishment of a United Nations or international trusteeship, to prepare 
Indochina for independence according to the principles of the Atlantic 
Charter. (6) 
When the Dumbarton Oaks Conversations did not provide a definite proposal 
for handling international trusteeships, President Roosevelt secured agree-
ment at Yalta that the United States, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China, 
and France would consult on the matter prior to the meeting of the United 
States Conference on International Organization in San Francisco on 25 April 
1945. But President Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and on 18 April a meet-
ing at the US State Department attended by the Secretaries of War and Navy 
and other governmental representatives drew up a US position, which was 
approved by President Harry S. Truman. The US military input to this posi-
tion sought to establish a system which would embody the high ideals of the 
United States toward dependent peoples while safeguarding the vital security 
interests of the United States. As initially stated in the US position paper 
of 18 April and ultimately incorporated in Article 77 of the United Nations 
Charter approved at San Francisco, the United Nations trusteeship system was 
made broad enough to include "territories voluntarily placed under the system 
by states responsible for their administration."(7) Under the new policy, 
the US State Department informed Ambassador Hurley on 10 June 1945 that France 
was not likely to "volunteer" Indochina as a United Nations trusteeship, but 
that President Truman intended "at some appropriate time to ask that the French 
Government give some positive indication of its intention in regard to the 
establishment of basic liberties and an increasing measure of self-government in 
Indochina before formulating further declarations of policy in this respect." (8) 
Meeting with Mr. Georges Bidault, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the French 
Provisional Government, on 18 May 1945, President Truman accepted the principle 
of French participation in World War II in the Far East, but because of a 
pressing shortage of ocean shipping US military planners estimated that a two-
division French Expeditionary Corps would not be moved from France to the 
Pacific and made ready for operations before the spring of 1946. When they 
met at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Combined Chiefs of Staff 
agreed that the French corps should be employed in the liberation of Indo-
china under the command of Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander, 
Southeast Asia Command. Since Indochina had been within the borders of the 
China theater of operations, the (CS proposal involved a new dividing line in 
Indochina, which the Combined Chiefs of Staff recommended should be drawn to 
include the portion of Indochina lying south of the 16th parallel within the 
Southeast Asia Command. The Combined Chiefs rationalized that Lt. General 
Albert C. Wedemeyer, Chief of Staff to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in the 
China theater, required control of northern Indochina in order to cover the 
flank of projected Chinese operations in China.(9)

Because the theater boundary changes discussed at the Potsdam Conference 
also involved the transfer of large portions of the Southwest Pacific Area 
theater to the Southeast Asia Command, Admiral Mountbatten was given time to 
study-the proposals. When Japan surrendered on 14 August 1945, however, - 
Mountbatten was immediately assigned the mission of occupying and receiving 
the surrender of Japanese forces in the portion of Indochina south of the 
16th parallel. After establishing an air staging base at Don Muang Airfield 
at Bangkok, Thailand, British forces were landed by air at Saigon on 13 
September.(10) While British forces arrived in Saigon with instructions to 
cooperate with a French administration, the Chinese Nationalist Army which 
occupied northern Indochina would refuse to hand back any authority to the 
French until February 1946. In conversations with President Truman in 
Washington on 22-25 August 1945, General Charles de Gaulle protested that 
the French return to Indochina was being hampered by Allied occupational 
arrangements made without French consultation. De Gaulle recorded that 
President Truman assured him that the United States would make "absolutely no 
attempt" to hamper French undertakings in the Far East.(11) 
Although the United States did not hamper French undertakings, some 
American leaders were nevertheless alarmed when France's effort to reestablish 
control over Indochina met an active guerrilla resistance, centering in the 
Hanoi area of Tonkin. This movement was led by an old Vietnamese Communist, 
Ho Chi Minh, who was able to hide his Marxist ideology and flaunt a banner of 
Annamese nationalism. In September 1946, Ho's Vietminh guerrillas Shifted to 
open warfare against the French. After returning to the United States from 
long service as American Ambassador to France, William C. Bullitt published 
an article in December 1947 which decried the fact that Ho Chi Minh was being 
followed by many Annamiteswho disagreed with his Communist ideology but 
accepted him as a symbol of resistance to French Colonialism. Believing that 
it would be a disaster if France surrendered to Ho's Communists, Bullitt 
specifically proposed (1) that France issue a statement promising the 
Annamites preparation for freedom and eventual independence; (2) that France 
announce that it would give freedom to Annam but would not hand it over to 
the Communists; (3) that France would permit the non-Communist nationalists 
of Annam to prepare completepolitical, economic, and military organizations 
for control of the country; (4) that as soon as those organizations had 
been created France would negotiate a treaty providing that there would be 
no discrimination against French institutions and for the maintenance of 
necessary French bases; and (5) that France would leave to the Annamite 
nationalists the task of winning over Ho's nationalist adherents and of 
crushing the irreconcilable Communists in Hors forces. Bullitt believed 
that the Annamites would be willing to accept a basic principle of "inde-
pendence within the French Union," This article by former Ambassador Bullitt 
was entirely unofficial, but it was widely accepted, especially in France, as 
being a statement of American policy. (12) 
Following two years of negotiations, the French persuaded Bao Dai, scion 
of the Annamese royal family who had briefly headed the Annamese government 
sponsored by the Japanese in 1945, 
to become chief of state of Vietnam

effective on 14 June 1949. Formed by the union of the former protectorates 
of Tonkin and Annam and the colony of Cochin China, Vietnam was promised 
complete internal sovereignty, a national army, and membership in the 
French Union. On 8 December 1949, France further established the Associated 
States of Indochina, to include Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and the King-
dom of Cambodia. France agreed to provide the Associated States the use of 
French Union forces for defense, and the agreements also provided that the 
foreign policy of the Associated States would be coordinated with that of 
the French Union through a French High Commissioner and a high council, 
composed of representatives of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Before agreeing 
to serve as Vietnamese Chief of State, Bao Dai had demanded that the native 
militarized police formed by the French from remnants of colonial Garde 
Indochinoise rifle regiments should be reorganized as Vietnamese armed 
forces. Shortly after taking power, the Bao Dai government issued a series 
of decrees providing a juridical basis for the Armed Forces of the Republic 
of Vietnam. The Vietnamese units, however, were small auxiliaries to the 
French forces, and kept outside of Rao Dai's control.(13) 
Although the establishment of Bao Dai's government drew some nationalist 
supporters away from the Vietminh, Ho Chi Minh's guerrilla movement got a 
boost from the victory of the Communists in China. After 1949, Ho became 
an openly-avowed Communist. His government was officially recognized by 
Communist China in January 1950, and the Soviet Union added its support to 
Ho Chi Minh without delay. On 7 February 1950, the United States extended 
diplomatic recognition to the State of Vietnam, the Kingdom of Laos, and 
the Kingdom of Cambodia and announced that the US consulate-general in 
Saigon would be raised to the status of a legation with the arrival of a US 
minister to the three Associated States.(1)4) After talks with French 
Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson further 
announced his conviction that the Indochina area was imperiled by Soviet 
imperialism and that accordingly the United States would begin to provide 
economic aid and military equipment to France and to the Associated States.(15) 
Even before the Communist attack on Korea, the United States was recog-
nizing that the Vietminh war in Indochina comprised Communist aggression 
rather than simple anti-colonial aspirations, but the Soviet-inspired North 
Korean invasion of the Republic of Korea launched on 24 June 1950 made it 
plain beyond all doubt to President Truman that the Communist nations had 
"passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations and 
will now use armed invasion and war." Truman considered that the Communist-
led Vietminh drive against Indochina was a part of a general Communist 
offensive in the Far East, whose northern front was in Korea and which 
endangered all free nations on the periphery of Communist China.(16) From 
Tokyo, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur sent President Truman an 
assessment that Communist China would probably not move south with her own 
forces but would instead train and equip indigenous forces to infilter and 
take over the free nations of Southeast Asia.(17)

2. Southeast Asia as a Regional Problem (18) 
Meaningful as a term of convenience rather than as of a well-defined 
geographic entity, mainland Southeast Asia thrusts dawn into the South 
China Sea from continental land mass of Asia and is a composite of mountain 
systems, interior highlands and plateaus, and alluvial basins and deltas. 
Three great rivers form the basins and deltas which were occupied by 
Monogoloid peoples from Asia. The Chao Phraya basin and delta form the 
heartland of Thailand. The Red River and its delta dominate the Tonkin 
area of Vietnam, while the 2,700-mile-long Mekong River provides a border 
between Thailand and Laos, forms a heavily populated plain in Laos, and 
its tremendous delta provides the heartland of Cambodia, as well as the 
characteristic feature of the old Cochin China area of Vietnam. The 
Mekong enters the sea through five mouths, and while this delta is 
heavily cultivated and is crisscrossed by canals it is also marked by 
many swamps, marshes, and reed covered areas. 
Most of Indochina and much of Thailand is covered by natural vegeta-
tion, which ranges from mangrove swamps at the coastal fringes, to open 
decidious forests and grassed savannas in the interior lowlands, and to 
heavy canopied evergreen rain forests on the mountains. For the most 
part, the grassed savannas have been the result of primitive slash and 
burn agriculture. In this common procedure, trees are girdled and later 
burned, leaving a rudely cleared and temporarily fertile area which can 
be cultivated for a short time. Once abandoned, the burned area rapidly 
covers with a tall groWthof tough grass, bamboo, and scrub trees. 
The climate of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand is monsoonal, 
and is characterized by the southwest summer monsoon from roughly mid-May 
to mid-September in the north and early October in the south and by the 
northeast winter monsoon which lasts from mid-October in the north and 
from early November to mid-March in the south. In the tropical environ-
ment tempwatures are generally high as is the relative humidity, which 
is high during the southwest monsoon and only moderate during the north-
east monsoon. The monsoons also affect precipitation: heavy Showers 
and thunderstorms characterize the rainy season which coincides with the 
moist air of the sammer monsoon, while the northeast winter monsoon brings 
the driest period of the year. Typhoons may occur from March through 
December, but July through November are the predominant months for these 
tropical hurricanes. During a typhoon, torrential rains may occur over 
wide areas, and, in association with high sea swells, contribute to flooding 
of the deltas and coastal areas. Cloudiness and low visibility are greatest 
during the rainy season, and ground fogs commonly blanket the interior val-
leys during night and early morning hours. Although visiblities are gen-
erally best in most areas during the relatively dry northeast monsoon, 
tepperature inversions frequently cause haze as well as the ncrachin" 
combination of fog and light drizzle over northern Vietnam which severely 
limits visual flying in the winter months.

The terrain features of mainland Southeast Asia channelized the move-
ments of Mongoloid peoples southward from China over the centuries and 
gave rise to eventual national boundaries. In their historic southward 
movement the Annamese occupied the Red River delta of Tonkin, the coastal 
lowlands fronting on the South China Sea, and pushed aggressively into 
most of the Mekong delta, which became Cochin China. The Annamese drew 
deeply from the culture of China in their language, generally Confucian 
social order, and in their religion, which remained predominately a 
mixture of Taoism and northern Buddhism, although many Annamese were con-
verted to Catholicism by the French. As formed in 1949 by the union of 
Tonkin, Annam, and Cochin China, Vietnam was a long, narrow, "S" shaped 
country, often being described as similar to two rice baskets (the Red 
and Mekong deltas) on a carrying pole (the interior Annam Mountain Range). 
Near the middle, the country is only about 25 miles wide, while its 
maximum width is in the north is 300 miles and in the south 130 miles. 
In most cases, mountain ranges formed Vietnam's borders with Communist 
China on the north and with Laos and Cambodia on the west. At many points, 
however, the borders between Vietnam and Laos and CaMbodia remain indefinite. 
The aggressive ways of the Anname:e :rail tem historically 
With the Khmer ethnic group which is he maority stock of Cambodia. The 
Cambodians are predonfnately descendants of the Mon-Khmers, whose culture, 
with definite Indian antecedents, reached its heights in about 900 to 
1200 AD in the construction of the temples at Angkor. The state religion 
of Cambodia is southern Buddhism, and, while the family is the base of the 
social structure, the Cambodian family may be extended and scattered over 
a relatively wide region. 
The predominately mountainous landlocked country of Laos is generally 
bounded by the Mekong River on the west and the crest of the Annam Mountain 
chain on the east. The Lao are a tribal grouping of Thai-speaking people 
who migrated southward around the ninth century AD. With the center of 
their agricultural livelihood established in the Hekong basin lowlands, 
the culture of the Laotian Thai is similar to that of neighboring Thailand. 
TheLao religion is southern Buddhism superimposed upon an original primi-
tive base of Animism. Long inaccessible to the outside world, the culture 
of Laos remained essentially primitive and agrarian. 
As historically established by by a southward emigration of Thai people 
from China over many centuries, Thailand became a Texas-sized nation 
roughly shaped like a letter "P." The bulk of the country is a southwest-
facing river basin bounded by mountains on the west, north, northwest, 
northeast, and southeast, and by the Mekong River on the east. Through a 
combination of adaptability and shrewd diplomacy, the Thai rulers main-
tained the historic independence of their country, despite challenges to 
them by western colonial powers. Centering in the Chao Phraya River basin, 
the basic Thai population is remarkably homogenous, except for oversea 
national peoples. The Thai government attempted to assimilate minority-
peoples who live in the northern mountains and on the orat (Korat) 
plateau frontier region of eastern Thailand.

Throughout Southeast Asia the major Annamese, Khmer, and Thai ethnic 
groups occupied the best agricultural land of the deltas, coastal areas, 
and river basins, forcing aboriginal people and earlier immigrants back 
into the highland plateaus and mountains. In the north, these more prim-
itive and tribal people include the Muong, who live in the hills fringing 
Tonkin's Red River delta. The Man and Meo tribes occupy the mountains 
and mountain valleys on the frontiers of northern Vietnam and Laos, while 
tribal Thai people (as distinguished from the Laotian-Thai) range south-
ward in the central Annam Mountain chain. Southern Vietnamese and 
Cambodian highland groups include the Rhade, Harai, Mbong, Stieng, Bahnar, 
and Sedang tribal peoples, often collectively described as ?Montagnards." 
Living in remote villages and governed by headmen and councils of elders, 
these tribal peoples are generally self-sufficient and historically have 
avoided contact with the major lowland ethnic groups. For centuries the 
highland tribes provided barrier; 5etween the Thai, Annamese, and Khmer 
people, but in the years after 1945 they found themselves living on key 
frontier areas where they were increasingly drawn into the prevailing 
conflict. 
Especially in the period of western colonialism, some 1,500,000 
Chinese came to Vietnam and Cambodia, while about 3,000,000 settled in 
Thailand. These Overseas Chinese located in cities and towns as shop-
keepers, money-lenders, rice merchants, and sometimes laborers. They kept 
their own language, customs, and social organization; many of them avoided 
local citizenship and treasured an intention of returning eventually to 
China. Some 7,000 Indians also came to Cambodia and Vietnam, where they 
too held themselves aloof and were an aggressive group of money-lenders 
and small shopkeepers. In addition to these immigrants, as many as 40,000 
Europeans settled in Indochina -- most being French by birth or marriage 
The attitudes of the ethnic majorities toward the recent immigrants were 
varied. The Vietnamese generally regarded the Chinese as exploiters, 
whereas the Cambodians, although economically dominated by them, liked 
and admired the Chinese. The Thai regarded the Chinese as useful for 
economic purposes, but generally excluded them from political life. The 
Indians were almost universally disliked. The Vietnamese had little fond-
ness for the French, while the Cambodians, Laotians, and many of the 
mountain tribesmen long considered the French to be protectors against the 
Vietnamese and held them in better regard. 
In view of the predominant agricultural pursuits of the people -- chiefly 
rice production with some European-managed plantations producing rubber and 
other similar products -- the vast majority of the population of Southeast 
Asia lives in rural villages and hamlets. The few urban centers -- notably 
Saigon and Hanoi in Vietnam, Phnom Penh in Cambodia, Bangkok in Thailand, 
and the towns of Luang Prabang (the residence of the King) and Vientiane in 
Laos -- served as local or regional centers of trade, light industry, govern-
ment, and religion. All of these urban units are on waterways, and the 
coastal cities of Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam were served by railways. 
Although the French constructed a well-developed road system consisting of

St(a.Kt 
23 national highways in Indochina, this road system deteriorated markedly 
under the Japanese occupation during World War II. While Laos had no 
railways, it had been provided with a rudimentary road system by the French. 
Despite these roads, however, Laos was most accessible to the outside world 
through Thailand (via the Thai railway which connected Bangkok with Udon 
Thani (Udorn), near Vientiane) rather than through Vietnam. 
Prior to the Japanese occupation of Indochina, the French had built 
four fully equipped airports at Hanoi, Saigon, Vientiane, and Vinh, and 
over 100 landing fields scattered widely over the country. The Japanese 
took over Gia Lam Airfield at Hanoi and Tan Son Nhut Airfield just north-
west of Saigon and developed them into sizeable air facilities. The 
Japanese also developed secondary airfields at Cat Bi near Haiphong; at 
Bien Hoa near Saigon; at Hue, Vinh, and Tourane (Da Nang) on the east 
coast; and at Phnom Penh. Using an abandoned French emergency landing 
ground at Nha Trang, the Japanese built an extensive hard-surfaced naval 
airfield, which supported wartime air patrols over the South China Sea. 
In Thailand aviation developed as early as 1922 when the Siamese Royal 
Air Force instituted an airmail service, and regular internal air services 
were inaugurated in 1931 by an Amer:Lcan-organized Aerial Transport Company 
of Siam. In view of limited surface transport, air services were extensive 
between landing grounds at principal Thai towns. Don Muang Airfield at 
Bangkok served international air services. In preparation for their Malayan 
and Burma campaigns, the Japanese energetically developed Thai airfields 
during 1941, including Don Muang, Chiengmai, Koke Kathiem, and Phitsanuloke. 
Late in 1944 as the situation deteriorated for them in Burma, the Japanese 
improved still other "fall-back" air facilities in Thailand, including work 
of major dimensions at such locations as Ban Takhli, Ubon, and Udon Thani 
(Udorn). After World War II the Thais virtually abandoned most of the 
Japanese facilities, but they continued to maintain Don Muang as a major 
civil and military airfield. The Royal Thai Air Force also operated a 
flight school at Korat, and the Thai Navy maintained an air base at 
Sattahip.(19) 
Throughout Southeast Asia the social and environmental situation in 
the post World War II period appeared to meet the conditions which Communist 
China's Mao Tse-Tung had outlined as favorable for a "People's Liberation 
Movement." Peasant discontent could be mobilized against French colonialism 
in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia and against economic oppression -- including 
"landlordism" in both Indochina and Thailand. Once formed and motivated, 
the guerrilla forces could establish remote jungle bases without great dif-
ficulty, and Communist China itself provided both sources of supply and a 
safe rear base for the Vietminh who were already fighting in northern 
Vietnam. As a whole, Southeast Asia was a large physical area, with limited 
communications, so that existing governments could not quickly mobilize to 
defeat the Communist guerrillas.

3. American Aid to French Union Forces in Indochina 
When President Truman made the decision to extend aid to French Union 
Forces in Vietnam and to other Southeast Asian nations, the United States 
employed organizational arrangements that had been established for giving 
assistance to Greece and Turkey in 1947 and had been modified by experience 
since that time. In the case of Oreece and Turkey, President Truman's 
announcement of the need to resist Communist threats to those nations and 
the Congressional passage of requested aid appropriations had been followed 
by the survey groups of State-War-Navy representatives to each of the two 
countries to study and report their exact requirements. When the survey 
reports had been studied and adjusted in Washington, President Truman 
established the American Mission for Aid to Turkey and the American Mission 
for Aid to Greece, the former being headed by the US Ambassador to Turkey 
and the latter by a civilian chief designated by Truman. Each of these 
aid missions included separate and co-equal Army, Navy, and Air Force Groups, 
with the senior ranking officer being designated as coordinator in matters 
of common interest to the separate military groups.(20) 
According to Congressional criticism, the US Ambassador and the US 
Administrator of Aid to Greece tended to run "two shows," and when a new 
US Ambassador was appointed he was given over-all authority over the aid 
program. On 31 December 1947, the Joint Chiefs of Staff also directed 
the establishment of a Joint US Military Advisory and Planning Group (JUSMAP) 
in Greece, under a director with Army, Navy and Air Force Sections.(21) 
On 30 December 1948 the US Secretary of State suggested a similar unification 
for the separate Army, Navy, and Air Force Groups in Turkey; he further sug-
gested that in as much as the interest of the Army was "paramount" in Turkey 
that an Army officer should head the unified military mission. At Ankara, 
the incumbent Chief of the Air Force Group agreed that a new over-all chief 
of a unified military mission might be useful, provided he did not also 
command the US Army Group. This suggestion, however, was not accepted. 
When the Joint Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JAMMAT) was established 
on 7 November 1949, the Chief of the Army Group assumed the duty as JAMMAT 
Chief and retained his former assignment as well.(22) 
In visualizing the type of politico-military organization required to 
put American military assistance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
for the years to follow 1949, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson conceived 
that there would need to be a close relationship between the foreign policy 
of the State Department, military aid to be provided by the National Mili-
tary Establishment, and economic aid to be administered by the Economic 
Cooperation Administration. He also favored a system which would permit 
aid programs to be administered abroad through existing diplomatic and 
military channels. (23) Toward these ends and looking toward Congressional 
action on the Mutual Defense Act of 1949, an interdepartmental agreement 
between State, Defense, and ECA was signed on 15 June 1949 wherein all

agreed that the Chief of the US Mission -- normally the US Ambassador -- in 
a country receiving military assistance would be the executive director of 
the military assistance program in the country and would coordinate the 
political, military, and economic aid staffs to the extent that they were 
concerned with the military aid program. They further agreed that a Military 
Aid Program Section, under a senior military officer, would normally be 
established within the diplomatic mission -- the head of the MAP Section to 
act as military advisor to the ambassador on military matters. Since the 
MAP function was clearly understood to be separate from an intelligence 
gathering objective, the interdepartmental agreement did not address the 
old relationships whereby Army, Navy, and Air Force attaches had laag been 
accredited to foreign embassies. Passed by Congress in October 1949, the 
Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949 authorized President Truman to pro-
vide military assistance and to exercise his authority under the act through 
such agency or officer as he might direct. Truman accordingly delegated 
such authority to the Secretary of State, and the interdepartmental agree-
ment of 15 June came into effect, except that through a terminology change 
the military unit in a recipient country would be known as a Military 
Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG). 
In the process of providing military assistance to European and Asian 
nations in 1949-1950, each recipient nation was normally first visited by 
a survey group, including experts on military planning, logistics, and 
training. Within a country, the US MAAG prepared "country programs," 
which were ,coordinated with the US Ambassador and submitted to the Depart-
ment of Defense, with separate requirement plans for the ground, naval, 
and air forces. The system worked as long as programs were concerned with 
country requirements for equipment and training, but the MAAGs ran into 
difficulty whenagreements were needed to expand a country's military 
facility infrastructure and military-supporting industrial production. 
Such matters required intergovernmental political discussions that were 
beyond the capabilities of a MAAG.(25) Farly in 1951, General Lucius D. 
Clay, Special Assistant to the Director of the Office of Defense Mobiliza-
tion, made studies of these problems and sponsored negotiations between 
State, Defense, and ECA looking towarcl better coordination between economic 
aid, defense production, and military aid. An interagency memorandum of 
understanding signed on 15 February 1951 provided that in countries 
receiving aid the Ambassador, the MAAG Chief, and the BaA Mission Chief 
would "constitute a team under the leadership of the Ambassador." This 
"Clay-paper" also declared: "The Ambassador's responsibility for coordina-
tion, general direction, and leadership shall be given renewed emphasis, 
and all United States elements shall be reindoctrinated with respect to 
the AMbassador's role as senior representative for the United States in 
the country."(26) 
Although US military assistance actions in Southeast Asia took place 
in context with worldwide programs and procedures for rearming Free World 
nations, the actions in Southeast Asia had to be accelerated to meet the

crisis confronting France and the Associated States in Vietnam. At Saigon 
on 6 July 1950, Donald R. Heath became the US Minister to the Associated 
States when the Consulate General was raised to the status of Legation. 
In August 1950, Brigadier General Francis G. Brink, US Army, established 
the US MAAG in Saigon. At first, Lt Colonel Edmund F. Freeman, Air Attache 
in Saigon, handled air aid matters, but on 8 November, Flight A, 1173d 
USAF Foreign Mission Squadron, was opened as the Air Force Section, MAAG, 
Indochina, and Colonel Joseph B. Wells assumed the duty as Chief, Air Force 
Section. The immediate problem of the MAAG was to secure napalm, ammunition, 
and barbed wire as a matter of urgency since newly trained Vietminh bat-
talions, now using modern arms from China and field assault tactics, had 
begun to score substantial victories. In October the Vietminh captured two 
of the principal French Union forts at the Chinese border which guarded the 
classic invasion routes into Southeast Asia, forcing the French to retreat 
into a perimeter around Hanoi and Haiphong.(27) While French Union Forces 
in Indochina urgently requested military assistance, the French desired 
that the MAAG in Saigon would be limited to a duty of receiving and transmit-
ting logistics requirements. As signed on 23 December 1950, the Mutual 
Defense Assistance Agreement between the United States, France, Vietnam, 
Cambodia, and Laos (the Pentalateral Agreement) expressly precluded direct 
relations between the Associated States and the US MAAG and provided for 
indirect American military aid through France to Vietnam, Cambodia, and 
Laos. (28) 
When French Premier Georges Bidault formally requested American mili-
tary assistance for the French effort in Indochina on 22 February 1950 
(and Shortly thereafter followed up with particular requirements for $30 
million worth of equipment), the French attached immediate importance to 
the desperate situation cf.-their air units in Southeast Asia. The French 
Union ground forces had been built up by such expedients as the recruit-
ment of German war veterans, but the Trench Air Force in Indochina in the 
spring of 1950 was a worn-out collection of miscellaneous aircraft. The 
French Air Force order of battle included two squadrons of British Spitfire 
IX's (46 planes), three squadrons of American King Cobra F-63As (63 planes), 
two squadrons of German JU-52 transports (15 planes), and one squadron of 
American C-47As (20 planes), plus additional light liaison aircraft. The 
French Navy operated a PBY-5A patrol squadron (8 planes) and a reconnais-
sance squadron with 9 Sea Otter aircraft. Lack of specialized aircraft 
types forced the available planes to perform missions for which they were 
not designed. Fighters were used for strafing, reconnaissance, and 
bombing, but generally-bombing missions were carried out by JU-52 transports 
which were rigged for the purpose. In metropolitan France the French Air 
Force largely depended upon civil contract maintenance and as a result very 
few French military maintenance technicians were available for service in 
Indochina.(29) In the first assistance action for Indochina the French 
urgently requested an expedited shipment of 8 C-47 aircraft and sufficient 
fighter aircraft to replace the old qpitfire us. Since the eight C-47s 
were already being prepared for delivery to metropolitan France and merely 
required a change in place of destination, the USAF delivered them to

Saigon during June 1950. In October, 1,D F6F Hellcat fighters from US Navy 
sources arrived in Saigon on the French aircraft carrier Dixmunde, accom-
panied by a training unit of three US Navy air officers and 10 enlisted 
men. (30) 
Even though the office of Secretary of Defense gave the Indochina pro-
gram priority over all other MDA programs in the last half of 1950, the 
United States met some delays in meeting deliveries to Saigon. On 30 
August, MAAG Saigon requested immediate supply support for the F-63 air-
craft, which the French (who liked their 37-millimeter cannon for ground 
support) wanted to keep in action. In the United States, the King Cobras 
were long obsolete, and, after a futile search, the USAF Air Materiel 
Command found it impossible to procure either spare parts ci 37-millimeter 
ammunition for the F-63s. This project had to be cancelled, and a new 
project was established to replace the F-63s with 90 F8F Bearcat fighters 
from US Navy stocks. Another high priority project established in October 
involved the renovation and flight delivery of 24 3-26 and 5 RB-26 aircraft 
to Vietnam. iphen the B-26s were rady fc? Light in early N67mber, adiers 
head winds prevented them from makL- Ls,ni; o:-3.2-water :llght tc

Force Base to Tourane Airfield in Vietnam. thy the end of the year, the 
remaining 9 B-26s had gotten favorable winds and had departed Sacramento by 
fly-away.(31) Ferried in non-flyable status aboard aircraft carriers, the 
first delivery of 44 F8Fs reached Vietnam in February 1951 and the balance 
of the F8Fs arrived during the following month. Because of delays incident 
to the installation of a reconnaissance system, the RB-26s did not reach 
Vietnam until July 1951, but their delivery completed the planned MAP air 
program for Indochina. With the new equipment, the French Far East Air 
Forces retired its old Spitfires and King Cobras and greatly increased its 
sortie rate. The French had been averaging 450 sorties a week during the 
sia/wrier of 1950, and the average weekly sortie rate jumped to 930 during 
the spring of 1951.(32) 
Encouraged by military successes in the autumn of 1950, the Vietminh 
openly sought a quick victory in open field warfare early in 1951. At this 
juncture, however, assignment of an energetic new French high-caadssicner 
and commander-in-chief, General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, as well as the 
first arrivals of American aid, helped the French to score important suc-
cesses. When the Vietminh struck the Northern perimeter defenses of Hanoi 
in force on 6 January 1951, American material was rushed from the docks at 
Haiphong into immediate combat. General de Lattre attested that American 
aid "especially napalm bombs, arrived in the nick of time for use in repulsing 
. . . Viet Minh daylight offensive." After surveying the battle area, US 
Minister Heath believed that "French superiority in aviation and artillery 
was responsible for turning back the Viet Minh offensive. In particular the 
use of napalm, furnished by MWAP, was a decisive factor in the French holding 
operations." In.May 1951 the Vietminh attacked again in force, this time 
south of Hanoi along the Day River, and they were again repulsed with very 
heavy losses.(33)

In view of the French successes against the incautious Vietminh offen-
sives, President Truman was able to satisfy himself that the French were 
making progress against the Communists. He mentioned this fact to French 
Foreign Minister Rene Pleven when the latter visited Washington in late 
January 1951. At this time, Pleven pledged that France would do its utmost 
to resist the Communists, and Truman assured the French of continued 
American aid.(34) Following the victory at the Day River, Truman could 
state that the Communist assault had been "checked by the free people of 
Indochina with the help of the French." (35) 
Although the Communists were indeed "checked" in the spring of 1951, 
American leaders wanted to resolve the conflict in Indochina in order that 
France could make progress in producing and training the 20 divisions that 
it had promised for the defense of Western Europe under NATO. In order to 
resolve the conflict, France would reouire larger forces in Indochina. 
This conclusion became even more apparent after April 1951 when the Vietminh 
returned to widespread guerrilla operations. Under circumstances short of 
an overt Chinese Communist intervention, the United States was resolved not 
to commit American combat forces to the war in Indochina. Another problem 
affecting the conflict was the apparent fact that the French had given only 
token independence to Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, with the result that the 
Indochinese people were willing to sit on the fence and await the outcome 
of the war. By making a definite and public pledge of full independence to 
the Associated States as soon as military victory could be attained and by 
pursuing a vigorous effort to buildupnative military forces, France could 
hope to capture the loyalty of the Indochinese masses and simultaneously 
provide much of the military force needed to combat the Vietminh, although 
specific French reinforcements.would still have to be dispatched from France. 
The United States could provide increased materiel assistance to France and 
the Associated States. These American assessments and proposed actions were 
revealed to Congress in statements by Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall 
and Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Dean Rusk. In Paris, 
General Dwight D. Eisenhower urged them upon the French after January 1951 
when he established Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Paris. And they 
were explained in detail when General de Lattre visited Washington in 
September 1951 for conversations with the Departments of State and Defense.(36) 
At the request of Chief of State Bac) Dai, who called for the establishment 
of an indigenous air capability to accompany the expansion of the Vietnamese 
army, the French agreed to the creation of a Vietnamese air force in June 
1951. Effective on 25 June, Vietnam established an Air Training Center at 
Nha Trang Airfield, and on 1 July an agency known as the "Air Force Office" 
was opened in Saigon. The French turned over 30 MOrane-500 Criquet liaison 
aircraft (a French-built version of the German Fiesler Storch) to the 
Vietnamese, who opened a liaison flight at Nha Trang. On 1 August 1951 the 
French also established a Vietnamese 312th ppecial Mission Squadron at Tan 
Son Nhut Airfield, equipped with Mbrane-500s, two C-47s, and two C-45s. 
According to the first plans, the Vietnamese air arm was to include 660 men,

including 44 aircrew members. The first Vietnamese pilots received their 
flight training in French flying schools in France, Algeria, or Morocco, 
but French instructors initiated pilot training at Nha Trang in March 1952, 
with a contingent of 15 students. The Nha Trang Center also instituted 
Vietnamese observer training at this same time. A maintenance training 
school and a military training school for cadets and recruits were also 
opened at Nha Trang during 1952. Two Vietnamese db servation squadrons were 
activated with Criquets in 1953, and on 1 July 1954 a light combat squadron 
was added to the inventory and equipped with 16 twin engine Marcel Dassault-
315 combat liaison planes. The observation squadrons and the combat squadrons 
were organized into the 1st Group Liaison for Combat. At all times, French 
personnel retained command, administrative, and logistical control over the 
Vietnamese air arm, which was increased in size beyond initial plans but 
nevertheless remained relatively small and had little military consequence.(37) 
The beginnings of the Vietnamese air arm would be of later significance, 
but the French initially kept the undertaking outside the cognizance of the 
US MAG, whose major concern followirg the re-equipment of the French Air 
Force in mid-1951 was the continuing prnvisioning of air maintenance sup-
plies and the procurement of equipment required in the expansion of native 
ground troops. In his Washington conversations in September 1951, General 
de Lattre had thought it possible with French and American aid to build the 
Army of Vietnam to 120,000 men and 4,000 officers, all Vietnamese. As the 
planning objective matured, the Vietnamese Army was to be built to a four-
division organization by incorporating already existing battalions in a 
division structure and recruitment and training of new battalions. Modest 
battalion-structured augmentations were planned for the Laotian and Cambodian 
armies.(38) In support of the native troop buildup, the United States 
delivered more than 106 shiploads of materiel to Indochina by 1 February 1952. 
The armies of the Associated States were largely equipped with Mel rifles from 
the MAP supplies.(39) 
Early in 1952, United States spokesmen were optimistic that the Vietminh 
could be defeated if the French gave real independence to the Associated States 
and if the intended native forces were built up to provide a base for stable 
political governments. (Lo) In conversations with Mr. Jean LeTourneau, French 
Cabinet Minister for the Associated States in June, Washington officials 
agreed that the United States would further increase its aid for Indochina 
(which was already approximating one-third of the total annual cost of opera-
tions there) in the expectation that the aid would be especially devoted to 
the building of native armies.(41) Denoting the greater significance of the 
native governments, the United States raised the status of the Saigon Lega-
tion to that of an EMbassy in July, and Donald Heath was accredited as 
Ambassador to the Associated States.(42) 
Despite the political emphasis placed upon the expansion of the national 
armies of the Associated States, the program lagged badly. As the Americans 
saw it, the efforts to recruit in Vietnam were affected by a struggle between

Bao Dai, who insisted on being given control over the Vietnamese army, 
and the French, who insisted that native forces be kept within the frame-
work of the French Expeditionary Forces. Under the circumstances, the 
educated and middle-class Vietnamese, who might have come forward for 
officer training at the Dalat military academy or one of the officer 
training schools, generally did not seek military service. Troop units 
were filled with men who were either conscripted or enlisted for short 
terms. The death of General de Lattre from cancer in January 1952 also 
represented a severe loss of a charismatic leader who was sympathetic to 
Indochinese independence and was pushing the formation of native armies. 
On the other hand, French sources would state that two of the four 
Vietnamese national divisions planned for 1952 had to be dropped from the 
program because the US military assistance programming cycle was too slow 
in providing adequate weapons and equipment to put them in the field. (143) 
Whatever the reason for the slowness of the Associated States troop 
Expansion, the strength of the Vietnamese Army in October 1952 totalled 
71,000 men (2 divisions - 24 battalions), the Cambodian Army 11,000 men 
(6 battalions), and the Laotian Army 10,500 men (5 battalions).(44) The 
troop strength was considerably less than General Raoul Salan, the new 
French Commander, had expected to have available at the beginning of the 
dry-weather campaigning season in this month. In the past, the French had 
used air transport to good advantage in rapidly moving French Union forces 
to critical areas. In the kind of environment in Indochina, the French 
were especially fond of the slow flying Junkers-52 which posed minimum air-
field requirements, but these ancient aircraft could not be sustained in 
operations. To maintain the airlift, General Salan drew upon American aid 
for 10 additional C-47s delivered in March-April 1952 and 10 more which 
arrived in September-October 1952.(45) In the weeks following 14 October, 
the French would have to fly Lheir available transport aircraft to the 
limit, since the Vietminh chose to launch their expected autumn offensive 
against scattered French fortresses in northwestern Tonkin rather than 
against the Hanoi perimeter. Achieving initial surprise, the Vietminh 
captured outposts on the Nghia Lo Ridge-Black River line, but the French 
escaped a complete catastrophe by flyin reinforcements to surviving 
defensive positions at Son La and Na Sam, which the Communists were then 
unable to capture.(46) From Saigon, however, Major General Thomas J. H. 
Trapnell and Colonel Arvid E. Olson, Jr., who had taken over as Chief of 
MAAG and Chief of the Air Force Section MAAG earlier in 1952, signalled 
that the French air transport squadrons could not meet requirements laid 
on them. Acting on direction from Washington, the US Far East Air Forces 
hurriedly assembled 21 C-47 aircraft, moved them to Clark Air Base in the 
Philippines where the 24th Air Depot removed USAF insignia and added 
paradrop equipment, and delivered the planes to the French at Nha Trang 
Airfield in Vietnam. The project was nicknamed "Sea Dog," and the C-47s 
were lent rather than given to the French. Although the French could 
provide aircrews for the planes, they were unable to maintain them. After 
discussions in December, the 24th Air Depot Wing moved a temporary duty 
maintenance and supply detachment to Nha Trang effective on 4 January 1953. 
The detachment -- the first such movement of American service forces to 
Vietnam -- would remain at Nha Trang until 14 August 1953.(47)

During the fighting in northwest Tonkin, the French inflicted more 
casualties on the Vietminh than they took, and General Salan seized the 
opportunity to mount Operation Lorraine out northward from the Hanoi 
perimeter against Vietminh base areas. But in spite of some limited 
successes, the situation in Vietnam was increasingly discouraging to the 
French. In a long talk with Ambassador Heath in early November, Resident 
Minister Le Tourneau was preoccupied with the difficulty he faced in 
securing appropriations for continued military operations, both from Bao 
Dal's government and from the French National Assembly. At this same time 
in France, influential commentators -- who stressed France's limited fiscal 
resources -- began to express interest in an "internationalization" of the 
Indochina war, not by the commitment of free world military forces but 
through increased free world financial aid to France and the Associated 
States. (L8) 
In Washington the decisions of the Truman Administration from 1950 
through 1952 to afford greater assistance inside Indochina were accompanied 
by a continuing apprehensive assessment of the role of the Chinese Com-
munists in the conflict, as well as the possibility that the Red Chinese 
might overtly cormit forces in Southeast Asia. Addressing the American 
people on 7 May 1951, President Truman pictured Communism as rampantly 
aggressive throughout Asia and as being separately checked by American, 
French, and British responses in Korea, Indochina, Malaya, and the 
Philippines.(49) In the case of Indochina in mid-1951 there was no doubt 
that the Chinese Reds were actively training, equipping, and supplying 
Vietminh forces, but there was no evidence of overt Chinese intervention. (50) 
The intervention of the Chinese Communists in Korea during November 1950 
provided a similar expectation that the Chinese Reds might openly enter the 
Indochinese war. Moreover, from a military point of view, the Red River 
Delta of Tonkin was directly exposed to a Chinese attack, since easy access 
routes led southeastward dawn the valleys from the Chinese province of 
Yunnan. In 1951-1952 the Red Chinese air force was deployed at bases in 
Manchuria, but existing airfields in South China could accommodate the Rea 
air forces during an air offensive against the Tonkin area. Published in 
April 1952, a USAF intelligence assessment pictured the French as totally 
unprepared to meet a Chinese air attack. It was true that the F6Fs and 
F8Fs that had been provided to the French could be used as interceptors, 
but French pilots were not trained for such tactics, and the planes had 
been so exclusively committed to low-level air-to-ground work that their 
air-to-air systems had deteriorated. None of them had oxygen, and water-
injection equipment had rusted out. The French had no early-warning radAr 
or ground controlled interception capability; antiaircraft artillery was 
very scarce; and the airfields around Hanoi were packed with planes. The 
intelligence estimate concluded that a surprise air attack against Tonkin 
airfields could knock out 60 percent of France's operational aircraft, 
including 75 percent of its fighter strength. In view of the French 
vulnerability to air attack, the Special Assistant for Mutual Defense,

Department of Defense, proposed in October 1952 that 60 F-86E Sabre jet 
fighters should be allocated as military aid to the Itench in Indochina. 
While the USAF generally concurred that the action would be desirable, 
there was little evidence that the French Far East Air Force could main-
tain the aircraft, and in the end the planes in question were allocated 
to the British Royal Air Force, which would use them for the protection 
of American strategic deployment airfields in the United Kingdom. (51) 
In the event of an overt Chinese Communist attack across the border 
of Vietnam, the US State Department assumed that France and the Associated 
States would take the aggression to the United Nations.(52) In 1952 mili-
tary representatives of Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the 
United States began to hold periodic intelligence conferences to discuss 
courses of action that could be taken in the event of - organized Chinese 
Communist aggression in Indochina, but these conferences failed to provide 
any firm agreements for united action.(53) In a diplomatic conversation 
with British Foreign Minister Anthony Eden on 26 May 1952, Secretary of 
State Dean Acheson noted that in case of Chinese aggression against Indo-
china the United States would probably issue a severe warning and, if it 
were ignored, would then find it necessary to blockade China's coast and 
dislocate her communications. In this conversation, however, Eden 
expressed disbelief that China would enter the Indochina conflict and 
stated that, in any event, Great Britain was ?strongly opposed to any 
action which would seem likely to result in war with China."(54) When 
he briefed President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on the situation in Indo-
china on 18 November 1952, Secretary Acheson emphasized that the French 
were wavering in their support for the war, both in Paris and in Vietnam, 
and had begun to express some interest in getting international support 
for their cause. Acheson also not that the United States had been 
unable to secure any multinational consensus on a common policy in the 
event that the Chinese Communists entered the war.(55) 
Already familiar with the problem of France in Indochina as a result 
of his command of NATO forces with headquarters in Paris, President-elect 
Dight D. Eisenhower nevertheless held discussions of the matter with the 
men who would be key members of his administration when they were aboard 
the cruiser Helena in December 1952,. returning to the United States from 
a visit to the stalemated battlefront in Korea. At this time, Eisenhower 
determined that three steps must be taken in Indochina: (1) The French 
should give "greater reality" to the independence of the Associated States, 
thus depriving the Vietminh of their false claim that they were struggling 
for independence. (2) At the same time that the people of Indochina were 
given a national cause for fighting, greater reliance should be placed upon 
native armies, and better equipment and training facilities should be 
provided to them. (3) The Free World should give greater assistance in 
Indochina, since France had been carrying on a struggle which was over-
burdening her economic resources.(56) In accordance with President 
Eisenhower's policy, the United States assured France of its willingness 
to increase its aid programs if France would produce an adequate plan for 
resolving the conflict in Indochina. (57)

Before the French could respond to the American offer of increased 
assistance, the Vietminh mounted another offensive in western Tonkin 
which possibly proved more successful than they had planned. Employing 
forces that had remained in northwestern Tonkin and beginning the cam-
paign on 9 April, the Vietminh drove westward into Laos. As the Reds 
reached Sam Neua, the predominantly Laotian French Union forces began 
to retreat on foot toward the airhead at Xieng Khouang near the Plain 
of Jars, the high plateau that dominates north-central Laos. French air-
craft harried the Reds and dropped supplies to the retreating troops, but 
only about 700 of the 2,400 French Union forces arrived at the Plain of 
Jars. The French believed that many of the Laotian soldiers simply went 
home. Coordinated with the drive from Sam Neua, another Vietminh force 
pushed westward out of central Annam along Colonial Route 7 as a southern 
prong of a pincers aimed at Xieng Khouang. With the approach of the Reds, 
the French evacuated the town of Xieng Khouang but maintained possession 
of the airfield in the vicinity which was successfully defended by bat-
talions that were flown in and supplied by air. This position blocked 
further Vietminh movements toward Vientiane, but the Reds sent a small 
force southward to threaten Paksane, on the Mekong border of Thailand. 
Probably because of supply shortages, the Vietminh began to backtrack 
eastward on 6 May, but two regiments remained behind in the Sam Neua 
area, where Communist Laotian Pathet Lao insurgents now developed a posi-
tion of strength. (S8) 
The successful Vietminh invasion of Laos -- basically a campaign of 
containment and movement rather than pitched battles -- caused great alarm 
in Washington, Bangkok, and Paris. In Paris, where a NATO foreign minister's 
conference was in progress, French officials asked US Secretary of State 
John Foster Dulles for additional transport aircraft. Given the directive 
to provide the aircraft, the Far East Air Forces appropriately modified 
six 0-119 aircraft and flew them from Clark Air Base to Nha Trang, where 
Civil Air Transport contract pilots employed by the French moved them to 
Cat Bi Airfield near Haiphong on 5 May. The civilian pilots flew the C-119s 
on operational missions until French pilots could be checked out. Once 
again, the 24th Air Depot 'iving provided a maintenance and supply detachment 
to support these "Project Swivel Chair" C-119s, first at Cat Bi and later 
at Gia Lam Airfield near Hanoi. With the completion of the requirement 
for these planes, both the aircraft and the detachment were withdrawn from 
Vietnam in late July. (S9) In response to another request made by Thai 
Ambassador Pote Sarasin, who called upon Secretary Dulles on 5 May to 
express alarm for the safety of Thailand, emergency air shipments of 
military assistance ammunition and other urgently needed items were rushed 
to Bangkok within 24-hours of the time they were requested. (60) 
Recognizing the gravity of the situation in Indochina, the French cabinet 
on 8 May 1953 appointed General Henri Eugene Navarre as the new Commander-in-
Chief of French Union Forces in Indochina. Later in the month, Navarre 
arrived in Vietnam, bearing instructions to draw up a plan to defeat the 
Vietminh and to report back to Paris with recommendations and suggestions.

In order to assist with the planning, as well as to study local conditions, 
the United States assembled a Joint Military Mission to Indochina, headed 
by Lt General John W. O'Daniel, which arrived in Saigon on 20 June. Already 
in the Far East as Commander of the 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo), Major. 
General Chester E. McCarty, joined the O'Daniel mission, and as the senior 
air member was assigned to study air transport, training of the Vietnamese 
Air Force, employment of combat air, and air logistics. The air section of 
the initial O'Daniel mission report filed on 15 July was critical of French 
Air Force resource management and pointed out that the greatest factor 
limiting French air operations was a shortage of maintenance and logistical 
support personnel. The air mission members contended that the French needed 
additional maintenance personnel far more than additional aircraft and 
argued that any augmentation of French aircraft without the addition of more 
logistical personnel would decrease rather than increase the air sortie rates. 
With proper management and support. the French should be able to double their 
air transport capability without additional aircraft. Despite this conclusion, 
the mission took note of General Navarre's requirement for sufficient aircraft 
to support a simultaneous three-battalion paratroop employment: It proposed 
that if such an airborne assault were necessary, the United States would lend 
the French a requisite number of C-119s with French insignia affixed, to be 
delivered at Cat Bi Airfield on the day prior to an operation. After execu-
tion of the drop by French aircrew personnel, USAF crews would return the 
planes to their home bases.(61) 
In making his plan for operations, General Navarre proceeded from a recogni-
tion that the French Union Forces were spread-eagled over too many defensive 
positions and could not be effectively employed as mobile striking forces 
against the Vietminh main force units. He called for building a battle corps, 
with requisite artillery, engineer, armor, and communications support. He 
planned to maintain a reserve of special armor, commando, and light infantry 
battalions for attachment to battle corps groups and divisions. He visualized 
maximum cooperation between ground, naval, and air forces, including sufficient 
air transport capability to drop three paratroop battalions. So that his 
battle corps would be roughly equiValent in size to the Vietminh main force, 
Navarre would need to relieve French Expeditionary Forces from garrison duty 
and secure nine additional battalions from Trance, thus increasing the strength 
of French forces to 250,000 men. In order to take over defensive positions, 
Navarre recommended that Associated States forces should be improved in cali-
ber (especially the native officers) and expanded. His goal was to form from 
50 to 55 new native battalions by the end of 1954, which would involve building 
the Vietnamese Army to 300,000 men. (62) 
According to his writings, General Navarre included with his plan a state-
ment of his belief that with reorganized and augmented forces he could secure 
a coup nul -- or draw -- with the Vietminh, thus permitting negotiations to 
take place under favorable circumstances. (63) Such a caveat did not appear in 
the summary of the Navarre plan studied in Washington during August 1953. 
Secretary Dulles would subsequently state that the United States acceptance of

btC.Kt1 
the plan in September 1953 was in some part predicated on General Navarrels 
design to lure the Vietminh into open battle and break up organized Communist 
forces by the end of the 1955 fighting season and thereby reduce the fighting 
to a level of guerrilla warfare which could then be met for the most part by 
the national forces of the three Associated States. (614) In addition to aid 
funds already committed to France and the Associated States, a joint Franco-
American communique issued on 30 September announced that the United States 
would make up to $385 millions available to France prior to 31 December 1954 
to support intensified prosecution of the war against the Vietminh. This 
stipulated US financial support would be increased, and in March 1954 the 
United States would commit itself to reimburse France up to a maximum of $785 
millions for Indochina expenditures undertaken during calendar year 1954.(65) 
In a speech in the Senate on 30 June 1953, Senator John F. Kennedy stated 
his firm conviction that American aid to Indochina should be administered in 
such a way Has to encourage through all available means the freedom and 
independence desired by the peoples of the Associated States, including the 
intensification of the military training of the Vietnamese." To attain such 
an objective, he suggested that some change would need to be made in the terms 
of reference of the US MAAG at Saigon which was limited in authority to supply 
matters, had no operational or training functions, and could deal only with 
French military authorities, who in turn dealt with the Associated States.(66) 
By agreement with the French, the US MAAG-Indochina was limited to receiving 
logistical requirements, transferring title to MAP materiel, and insuring that 
proper use was made of the items supplied. (67) Possibly because of the limited 
duties, the Air Force Section of the MAAG was authorized only 7 officers and 8 
airmen when it was established in 1950, and any increase in the section's man-
ning required recommendation by the MAAG Chief, approval by the US Ambassador, 
and final review and approval of the Office of Secretary of Defense. Even 
though the volume of USAF materiel sent to Indochina increased markedly, the 
strength of the Air Farce Section was augmented very little. With a small staff 
and a heavy paper workload, members of the Air Force Section were in effect 
chained to their desks in crowded offices in Saigon and were unable to get out 
into the field to provide logistical advice or determine the end use being made 
of MAP items. Under the circumstances, Colonel Olson frequently requested field 
assistance teams from the Far East Air Materiel Command to assist the French 
with logistical problems, and Colonel Harold E. Kofahl, who replaced Olson as 
Air Force Section Chief in August 1953 continued the practice. As one of its 
recommendations, the O'Daniel mission advocated a substantial personnel aug-
mentation for the entire MAAG. These recommendations were approved by the 
Office of Secretary of Defense in January 1954, and in the following month 
the USAF began moving 10 additional officers and 20 additional airmen to its 
Air Force Section in Saigon. As a result of the increased manning authority, 
the Air Force Section was authorized 20 officers and 35 airmen as of 1 July 
1954. The new men included one Air Force lieutenant colonel for assignment 
as a liaison officer with the French Far East Air Force.(68)

Under normal aid procedures the French authorities in Indochina were 
expected to provide annual fiscal year MAP requirements to the US MAAG for 
its study and approval, for review by the US Ambassador, and then for 
processing in the Office of Secretary of Defense. In addition to these 
reviewing authorities, the Commander-in-Chief Pacific Area (CINCPAC), with 
headquarters in Hawaii, was responsible for planning in a theater area 
which had been extended to include Southeast Asia, and in January 1954 
CINCPAC was given the responsibility for reviewing all MDAP submissions 
and making recommendations on them as required in line with his responsi-
bility for area planning. (69) Both the annual NEAP country submissions 
and any changes to them required the MAAG to provide elaborate justifica-
tions, including a certification that the country's military forces were 
prepared to make good use of the materiel requested. The exacting procedures 
required for handling M1AP aid made it difficult for the MAAG Chief in 
Saigon to provide prompt logistical support to the French war effort. (70) 
In view of their military situation, the French found it very difficult 
to provide the US MAAG with programmed yearly aid requirements. This was 
particularly true of the French Far East Air Force, which had to relate its 
activities to a constantly changing and reactive surface campaign.(71) In 
this respect, the US MAAG could sympathize with the French, but its members 
nevertheless noted a certain changing attitude on the part of French 
authorities, particularly after high-level announcements were made in 
Washington as to the all-out support that the United States was prepared to 
offer to the Free World cause in Indochina. In a general description of its 
relationships with the French after mid-1953 the MAAG noted that French 
authorities were not only reluctant to accept advice, but they generally 
appeared to expect the United States to provide everything they requested, 
regardless of their ability to use or maintain it.(72) 
The expectant French attitude toward limitless American aid to be made 
available for the asking and their reluctance to accept advice was well 
manifest in demands for more and more air materiel, beginning in mid-1953. 
As already seen, both MAAG-Saigon and the O'Daniel mission warned the French 
that the manpower ceiling of the French Far East Air Force -- 10,000 per-
sonnel, including approximately 2,500 Vietnamese guards and ordinary 
laborers -- was totally inadequate to operate and maintain the number of 
aircraft already possessed in mid-1953 and that the addition of more aircraft 
would reduce rather than increase operational capabilities. To meet the French 
requirement for augmented air transport capabilities, General McCarty had 
proposed to lend the French operational C-119s on their demand. The French 
Air Commander, Major General Charles Lauzin, would not accept the American 
solution. Instead, late in August 1953, Lauzin informed the US MAAG that he 
wanted to use C-47s rather than C-119s for paratroop employments. He promised 
to get 650 additional air personnel from France and proposed to use an 
additional 1,000 Vietnamese Army soldiers to relieve other Shortages in man-
power. On this basis, he requested the MAAG to obtain by 1 October through 
NEAP from USAF sources 25 additional C-47s and necessary equipment to permit 
permanent activation of a fourth C-47 squadron. (73) The C-47s were delivered

in December 1953.(74) The strength of 100 c-47s had been initially justi-
fied to meet General Navarre's requirement for a three-battalion airdrop 
without employment of borrowed C-119s. In order to drop supplies to 
entrenching troops at Dien Bien Phu, however, the French called for addi-
tional C-119 support. Accordingly, the315thAir Division instituted 
"Project Iron Age" on 5 December, whereby its C-119s were ferried to Cat 
Bi Airfield and flown from there on combat air drops by either French or 
Civil Air Transport contract crews. In support of these continuing "Iron 
Age" drops the 315th Air Division would keep from 12 to 22 C-119s ready 
on station at Cat Bi and later Tourane until the project was terminated 
on 23 July 1954.(75) 
Subsequent to the first deliveries of 3-26 and RB-26 aircraft to Indo-
china, the US military assistance program had kept the two French light 
bomber squadrons up to an authorized strength of 24 B -26s, and it had 
continued to maintain the 4 RB-26s which were also operated by the light 
bomber squadrons. During the Vietminh invasion of Laos in mid-1953, the 
French needed additional longer range strike aircraft and requested 
additional military assistance B-26s. Because of USAF requirements in 
Korea, the planes could not be immediately provided, but after 27 July 
1953 the military armistice in Korea permitted a planned shipment of 6 
WAP B-26s and 1 R3-26 to Indochina, the former to be delivered to the 
French in January 1954. In this month, however, General Navarre requested 
that his two B-26 squadrons be increased to a unit strength of 25 planes 
in each and that he be given a third B-26 squadron with a similar unit 
strength. Once again, the French Far East Air Force did not have the 
ability to support the B-26s but on 8 January 1954 the Assistant Secretary 
of Defense (International SeQurity Affairs) directed the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force to provide aid to Indochina in the highest NEAP priority, without 
regard to funding. On 16 January 1954 the US National Security Council 
formally indorsed the ISA directive and additionally directed the services 
to make certain that all echelons of command understood that they would 
expedite supply and training support for Indochina "through any organiza-
tion or procedure as may be considered necessary to insure effective and 
prompt support." Acting on a USAF order received on 30 January, the Fifth 
Air Force ferried 16 B-26s from Japan to Clark Air Base, where French 
markings were painted on the planes prior to their delivery to Tourane 
Airfield on 14-16 February. These 16 "Project Market" planes were on loan 
to the French, but 22 MDAPB -26swere delivered in January and February and 
3 MAP RB-26sarrived in Vietnam in March. (76) 
In March and April 1954, French demands for more aircraft became 
increasingly desperate. Expedited deliveries to Indochina included 6 H-19 
helicopters drawn from Marine units in the Far East, 24 L-20 aircraft from 
the USAF inventory, and 12 F-87 aircraft diverted from the Thailand MDAP. 
Early in April, French High Commissioner Maurice Dejean told Ambassador 
Heath that the French required 18 C-47s "immediately" to cover attrition.

The Far East Air Forces was directed to provide the planes on loan on 1 
April, and they were moved out of itazuke on "Project Green Turnip" and 
were in place at Tourane on 9 April. To meet another demand early in % 
April, the Far East Air Forces staged an additional 25 B-263 aircraft 
("Project Saddle Soap") from Japan to Indochina, again on loan to the 
French. With the additional B-26s on hand, the French again requested 
that they be authorized a fourth NEAP light bomber squadron. This pro-
posal was turned down until the French could provide flight crews and 
maintenance crews, but during June the Far East Air Forces prepared and 
delivered 8 B-26C aircraft to the French Air Force in exchange for 8 B-26B 
planes that required heavy maintenance. (77) 
When he began to request additional aircraft in August 1953, General 
Lauzin had mentioned the prospects of getting augmented French personnel 
and of using more Vietnamese in support roles. As the added aircraft were 
received in the winter of 1953-1954, however, the personnel strength of the 
French Far East Air Force rose to only 11,2.41 men (8,145 French and 3,096 
indigenous) and the French air units remained approximately one-fourth 
understrength in authorized personnel.(78) In France, the United States 
Air Force in Europe opened an expedited training program for French 3-26 
crews and mechanics, and the French mechanics were scheduled to begin to 
reach Indochina in June.(79) To meet this emergency, USAF directed the 
Far East Air Forces on 31 January 1954 to use the resources of the Far 
East Air Logistics Forces (FEALOGFOR) to establish and man a provisional 
maintenance, unit in Vietnam. The directive specified that 200 Air Force 
mechanics plus other necessary personnel would be used to perform 0-47 and 
B-26 maintenance. Brigadier General Albert G. Hewitt, Commander FEALOGFOR, 
reached Saigon on 2 February, where he arranged for the establishment of a 
3-26 detachment at Tourane and the 0-47 detachment at Cat Bi. In a highly 
classified operation -- first nicknamed nProjec-6 Revere" and later "Duke's 
Mixture" -- the provisional FEALOGFOR field maintenance squadron was put 
together and airlifted to the operating locations at Tourane and Cat Bi 
beginning on 5 February. In a relaxation of security five days later, 
President Eisenhower announced that "some airplane mechanics. . MID 
would not get touched by combat" htd been sent to Vietnam. President 
Eisenhower further stated that these men would be withdrawn not later than 
15 June, and the French agreed during March to allocate 450 additional 
technicians in relief of the AmeriCan mechanics. While the President's 
timing could not be exactly accomplished, the US operating location at Do 
Son would be closed on 29 June and the other at Tourane on 17 July 1954.(80) 
In an effort to get information relating to the air logistical situation 
in Indochina, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, USAF Chief of Staff, directed the 
dispatch of a study mission to be headed by General Hewitt. The Hewitt mis-
sion arrived in Saigon on 29 March 1954 and its report on 6 April was a 
thorough coverage of the entire French air logistics situation. While some 
of General Hewitt's findings have been noted above, the main theme of his

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy ApprovgifE 2013/09/23: CIA-RDP85B00236R000100010001-2 
report dealt with essential French Air Force deficiencies. He pointed out 
that the French Far East Air Force's manpower ceiling (11,241 persons in 
March 1954, although the authorized ceiling was still 10,000) was essentially 
too small to support a ground force of 182,000 French Union troops. Many of 
the ground troops supported were at isolated positions that had to be sup-
plied by air; moreover, the Vietminh had so effectively cut rail and road 
communications throughout Indochina that materiel could be moved only by air 
or by water shipping. Among other basic difficulties, Hewitt pointed out 
that the French Air Force was essentially weak in logistical training, 
especially in supply, which had not been a recognized technical specialty for 
career development. 
These basic deficiencies were further compounded by the situation in Indo-
china. The majority of air supplies were at Bien Hoa Air Depot near Saigon, 
while the heavy fighting was in northern Vietnam. Since the French Army was 
reluctant to release air transport planes, aviation supplies had to be moved 
to the airfields at Tourane, Cat Bi and Do Son by slow water transport. Air 
:service stocks were maintained at these airfields, but the poorly trained 
stock technicians frequently could not find items that were actually in the 
local stocks. Consumption records generally were not kept, and logistical 
planners were unable either to calculate and requisition their advance needs 
or to keep available maintenance crews assured of a steady flow of work. In 
swnnary, greatly varying requirements for flying hours, too-long elapsed 
time out-of-commission for periodic maintenance, slow distribution of critical 
aircraft supplies, lack of built-up engines on hand at maintenance sites, lag 
in delivery of aircraft to maintenance sites and subsequent pick-up, and 
inadequate service stocks caused low in-commission rates for B-26s and C-47s. 
In April, during the Hewitt visit, the in-commission rate for these French 
aircraft was averaging less than 50 percent. Uhile the logistical situation 
confronting the French Air Force was very grave, General Hewitt nevertheless 
noted that it was improved over what it had been in late 1952 when he had 
earlier visited in Indochina.(81) 
Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference  
At the level of international strategy, the military armistice in Korea 
and the augmented American support for the French and Associated States in 
Indochina involved a danger that Communist China, which had long provided 
support to the Vietminh, would at the least increase its support for the 
Vietnamese Communist forces and might send its awn military forces into 
Indochina. In an address on 2 September 1953, US Secretary of State John 
Foster Dulles warned Red China against sending its forces into Vietnam, as 
she had done in Korea. "The Chinese Communist regime," Dulles said, "should 
realize that such a second aggression could not occur without grave con-
sequences which might not be confined to Indochina."(82) In a broader 
application of this same idea enunciated on 12 January 1954, Dulles let it 
be known that aggressors could no longer expect to prescribe battle con-
ditions that suited them. In deterrence of local aggression, Dulles said 
that the Eisenhower administration would emphasize a "capacity to retaliate, 
instantly, by means and at places of our own choosing." (83)

Secretary Dulles, statements had particular relevancy to the situation 
in Indochina, where the United States wished to contain Communist aggression, 
secure the national independence of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and was 
determined to assist the French in achieving a successful conclusion of the, 
Vietminh insurgency, without a unilateral commitment of US combat forces and 
without relieving the French of their own responsibilities. (8k) Possibly 
intending to act before the Navarre Plan could strengthen the western posi-
tion, Red China proposed on 15 September 1953 a Korean-like peace conference 
on Indochina. At this time, a desire for peace was strong in the Associated 
States, and France had indicated a willingness for negotiations, but the 
Vietminh spurned the idea of negotiations, probably because their military 
operations were quite successful.(85) French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault 
also recognized that large-scale American aid had been dependent upon his 
pledge to the United States on 29 September 1953 that France would cease all 
negotiations with Red China and the Vietminh. (86) If negotiations were 
eventually necessary, the United States wanted to negotiate from a position 
of strength. Secretary Dulles, therefore, Specifically opposed a prior 
commitment to negotiate at some fixed future date because he feared that the 
Vietminh would redouble their military effort and attempt to achieve a feat 
of arms and thus strengthen their diplomatic bargaining power. However, at 
quadripartite talks in Berlin, held from 25 January to 18 February between 
Dulles, Bidault, Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Dulles 
was over-ridden, and the conferees agreed that the problem of restoring peace 
in Indochina would be discussed at.a conference to begin at Geneva on 26 April, 
to which representatives of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, 
the USSR, Communist China, and other interested states would be invited.(87) 
Shaken by the Vietminh invasion of Laos in mid-1953, the French political 
and military position in Indochina remained weak in the winter of 1953.-1954. 
On the political level, King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia denounced France in 
June 1953 for failure to provide defense or carry out its commitments in 
Indochina and then fled to Thailand to publicize his criticisms. Seeking to 
ease these internal problems on 3 July, the French Government addressed notes 
to each of the Associated States, inviting them to enter bilateral discussions 
in Paris on the political, military, judicial, and financial issues involved in 
completing their independence and sovereignty within the French Union. His-
torically.on better terms with France than the other two states, Laos concluded 
a treaty with France on 22 October 1953, whereby She accepted membership in the 
French Union and was promised independence and internal sovereignty. Convened 
by Bao Dai in October 1953, a Vietnamese National Congress demanded that Vietnam 
be given complete independence, after which Vietnam would decide whether it 
would join the French Union. In return for concessions including full sovereign 
control within Cambodia and control of the Cambodian army, Sihanouk returned 
from exile but proved to be in no hurry about accepting any permanent relation-
ship with the French Union.(88) 
Under his announced plan, General Navarre expected to start spoiling 
attacks against the Vietminh beginning in September 1953 in order to fore-
stall enegy offensives. To this end he expected to operate against the

flanks and rear of the enemy. Navarre also knew that the French Government 
expected him to defend Laos, and the political necessity for this became 
more pressing after Laos cemented its relations with the French Union in 
October 1953. The activities of the Vietminh in northwest Tonkin had 
weakened the hold of the French over Black Thai tribal guerrillas, and it 
would be desirable to reestablish French authority in the Black Thai country. 
For all of these reasons, Navarre wanted to recapture an appropriate site 
in northwest Tonkin and to build a fortified ground-air base there. General 
Salan had already pointed out the strategic importance of the plain of Dien 
Bien Phu near the Laotian border and astride the main highway leading into 
northern Laos. Three paratroop battalions dropped upon the already existing 
airstrip at Dien Bien Phu on 20 November 1953, displaced Vietminh forces 
without difficulty, and immediately began to fortify the area.(89) 
As the French worked to develop an enclave of strength in northwestern 
Tonkin, their limited attacks elsewhere failed to close upon the elusive 
Vietminh, who again moved out of the central highlands of Vietnam in a 
Christmas 1953 offensive that carried all the way through the Laotian pan-
handle to Thakhet on the Mekong River. The need to respond to the mobility 
of the Vietminh cut into the mobile reserve that Navarre was attempting to 
gather together from dispersed locations, at the same time that the expan-
sion of native Vietnamese forces was giving difficulty. The withdrawal of 
experienced Vietnamese troops from existing units to encadre new levies 
weakened positions along the southern defenses of the Hanoi perimeter, thus 
allowing widespread infiltrations into the Red River delta. Around Dien 
Bien Phu, the Vietminh concentrated three divisions and a fourth division, 
which thrust at the Laotian capitol of Luang Prabang in January 1954, fell 
back and joined the siege at Dien Bien Phu. (90) 
The Communist investment of Dien Bien Phu was accompanied by an air-
lifted augmentation of the French and Associated States forces to the air-
head in ahill-surrounded valley. Since the Vietminh controlled all surface 
routes into Dien Bien Phu, the defensive garrison was completely dependent 
upon airlift from the airfields 150 miles away around Hanoi, and by mid-
January 1954 this air supply effort was requiring 20 C-119 and 50 C-47 
sorties each day. In the past, when the Vietminh had possessed no anti-
aircraft artillery, the French had been able to maintain fortified air-ground 
bases inside Communist areas, but early in January the French received radio 
intercept information indicating that at Son La (which the French had evacuated 
and was now in enemy hands) the Vietminh were stockpiling 37-mm antiaircraft 
artillery ammunition. At the request of the US Army attache in Saigon, two 
Far East Air Forces antiaircraft artillery intelligence experts, Captains 
Robert M. Lloyd and Robert W. Hickey, visited Vietnam between 16 January and 
5 February. In their briefings Captains Lloyd and Hickey explained the 
characteristics of the rapid-firing Soviet-made 37-mm weapons and emphasized 
that if such weapons were sited against the limited air -approach zones into 
Dien Bien Phu they could have "considerable success" against low-flying 
transport aircraft. After close study of the photographs of the enemy .

positions around Dien Bien Phu and other fragmentary intelligence data, 
the two experts concluded that the French had probably over-appraised the 
threat to Dien Bien Phu and that the Vietminh had not deployed any 37-mm 
weapons. (91) The Far East Forces Intelligence Roundup for February 1954 
noted that Vietminh 37-mm weapons would pose little additional threat to 
French F8Fs and B-26s but that they would considerably increase the 
hazard to slow-flying French transport aircraft.(92) 
At Far East Air Forces Headquarters in Tokyo, the FEAF Commander General 
Otto P. Weyland, already believed in January 1954 that the United States was 
getting over-committed in Indochina, possibly because high-level American 
officials were too largely influenced by high French officials and French-
selected Vietnamese. Weyland did not like the creeping involvement of FEAT 
in support of the French, with no straight-forward policy. As a matter of 
fact, he wanted the United States to give the French adequate MMAP funding 
so that they could prosecute the war and let the French bear full responsi-
bility for its outcome. He specifically recommended that the French use 
MDAP funds for contract maintenance of their aircraft rather than rely upon 
FEAT detachments. (93) While General Weyland did not presume to be an expert 
on Indochina, he made a trip there early in February 1954 that left him with 
the overall impression that the problem there was "primarily political and 
psychological.? He observed that the Vietnamese thoroughly disliked the 
French and that Vietnamese troops serving under French officers did not per-
form very, well. He was particularly impressed with the fact that Vietnamese 
laborers who worked at the Hanoi airfields by day might well be joining the 
Vietminh in depredations at night. (9L.) 
In Washington President Eisenhower was apprehensive about the prospects 
of troops invested in an isolated fortress, and he had the State and Defense 
Departments communicate his concern to the French.(95) General Navarre, 
however, was more optimistic. His advisers, citing their studies in col-
laboration with the American antiaircraft artillery experts, told him that 
the Vietminh would have great difficulty in bringing in and siting 37-mm 
weapons, that such weapons could be neutralized by counter-battery fire, 
and that flight approaches and drop zones could be so arranged as to mitigate 
the weapons and continue air resupply withoutexcessive losses.(96) 
According to Navarre, the French Minister for Defense Rene Pleven and Lt 
General Paul H. R. Ely, Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces, were 
impressed with the strength of Dien Bien Phu when they visited there in 
February. Navarre also said that General O'Daniel voiced enthusiasm for the 
organization of the fortress after making a personal inspection. In addi-
tion to its key location, the investment of Dien Bien Phu was consuming the 
large part of the Vietminh military forces and, if the Communists attenpted 
to storm the fortress, the Frenoh defenses could expect to inflict heavy 
casualties on the enemy in a set-piece battle.(97) While General Navarre 
would not have known of such assessments, two USAF assistant air attaches 
who returned from duty in Saigon early in 1954 expressed the belief that 
the Vietminh had no antiaircraft artillery-since a French raid on Vietminh

supply dumps near the border north of Hanoi at Lang Son had not disclosed 
a single antiaircraft weapon or shell.(98) In March 1954 one of the top 
ranking officers in the USAF Directorate of Intelligence, could only con-
clude that Ho Chi Minh was "stupid" to attack Dien Bien Phu and decimate 
his forces when the Vietminh "hit and run" tactics had been so much more 
effective. (99) 
In the Indochina War the Vietminh had not had the artillery firepower 
that they required to break through major French defenses, but, unknown to 
General Navarre, the Chinese Communists had been training and equipping 
Vietminh artillery and flak forces. In preparation for the assault on Dien 
Bien Phu, the Communists brought in disassembled weapons on the back of 
human carriers, assembled the weapons, and carefully emplaced them in dug 
out positions concealed by heavy vegetation. The French Air Force was 
using infra-red photography in an effort to ferret out Communist activities 
and this photography was effective against artificial camouflage, but the 
Communists very seldom disturbed the natural jungle canopy. Artillery 
pieces included 75- and 105-mm guns (the latter of American manufacture) 
and the antiaircraft order of battle was built around Soviet-made 37-mm 
automatic weapons and 12.7-mm heavy machine guns. In addition to these 
weapons, the Vietminh were well equipped with heavy mortars. As the siege 
progressed, the Communists brought in additional 105-mm guns and several 
Katyusha rocket launcher batteries. According to US air attache figures, 
the probable Vietminh antiaircraft defense deployed around Dien Bien Phu 
included 57 x 12.7-mm machine guns organic to the four Vietminh divisions 
and two separate antiaircraft battalions, each possessing 121L37-mm auto-
matic weapons and 18 x 12.7-mm machine guns. There were some reports that 
the 37-mm weapons were radar directed, but the air attache report believed 
these reports in error and suggested that well-trained weapons crews aimed 
and tracked only by sound and sight. To provide support the Communists 
opened a 100-mile road route to their major depot at Lao Cai on the Chinese 
border and were able to provide resupply needed to maintain a high rate of 
fire for theLr artillery. While the new artillery units were nominally 
Vietnamese, Chinese Communists advisors were very numerous and may have 
operated the artillery batteries. Chinese technicians also installed and 
maintained an extensive Vietminh field telephone net in the battle area, 
and Chinese Army personnel probably operated the fleet of 1,000 trucks used 
for Vietminh supply, about one-half of which arrived from Red China after 
early March.(100) 
The harbinger of the impending battle for Dien Bien Phu may have been 
guerrilla attacks against Gia Lam and Cat Bi airfields. Using plastic 
explosives, Vietminh infiltrations damaged or destroyed 10 civil transport 
aircraft at Gia Lam on the night of 3-4 March. On the night of 6-7 March, 
some hundred guerrillas raided Cat Bi, destroying a B-26 and 6 Criquets, 
and damaging three other B-26s.(101) The attack against Cat Bi appeared 
intended to destroy the C-119s parked there, but extra security guards 
had been posted and only one C-119 received minor shrapnel. holes. (102)

On 10 March secretly emplaced Communist guns began harassing fire 
against Dien Bien Phu's two airstrips, and at nightfall on 13 March the 
Vietminh launched massed attacks against French hill-position outposts. 
Both sides lost heavily in fightihg of unprecedented fury. The Vietminh 
suffered the heavier casualties, and the French replaced their losses by 
dropping two paratroop battalions into Dien Bien Phu on 14 and 16 March. 
But the Vietminh retained their hold on the hills surrounding Dien Bien 
Phu and sent plunging artillery fire down on the garrison and airstrips. 
All French air units -- including the French Air Force, naval aviators 
from the carrier Arromanches, and naval patrol airmen flying PB4Y-2 
Privateer bombers from Cat Bi -- contributed to the ground support at 
Dien Bien Phu, which averaged 43 sorties a day in the week of 11-17 March. 
Both in the air and on the ground, the French lost more aircraft in this 
week than in any similar period of time up until then. On 14 March, 
Communist gunners closed the principal airstrip at Dien Bien Phu and then 
proceeded to chop up some 7 F-8F8, 2 C-47s, 1 0-119, 4 Criquets, and 2 
H-19B helicopters caught on the ground. The 0-119 had been grounded after 
a mechanical failure several days earlier. On 14 March, Communist anti-
aircraft fire scored on a B-26 which crashed on landing at Cat Bi, and on 
the following day Red gunners shot down an F-6F and an F-8F. In the week, 
Communist flak also damaged 3 F-8Fs, 1 Criquet, and 1 C-119, the latter 
receiving a 37-mm hit in its wing. For two weeks, C-47s and smaller planes 
would be able to sneak into Dien Bien Phu at night to evacuate casualties, 
but the last air ambulance to attempt such a mission was destroyed by 
Communist 'artillery on 28 Mhrch.(103) 
After 13 March air landings of supplies and replacements were no longer 
possible, and the 170 tons of ammunition and 30 tons of food required each 
day to sustain the garrison at Dien Bien Phu had to be dropped from the air 
into zones which became smaller with each Communist advance. All military 
air transport aircraft including the US C-119s were committed to the air 
resupply effort. High altitude drops (8,000-10,000 feet) resulted in much 
of the cargo landing in enemy hands, and the expenditure of parachutes and 
other drop equipment so nearly depleted USAF stocks in Japan that emergency 
shipments had to be made from the United States. Parachuted drops from 
3,000-4,000 feet would have been more effective, but the air transport 
capability could not stand the losses arid damages from the 37-mm weapons 
at such an altitude, and the decision was made to lose supplies rather than 
the planes and their crews.(104). While the aircrews estimated that one-half 
of the supplies they dropped fell into enemy hands, French Foreign Legion 
soldiers who had been at Dien Bien Phu believed that the enemy recovered and 
use fully two-thirds of the supplies dropped. (l0) 
During Vietminh attacks the French fighters and light bombers gave 
direct support to their fellow troops on the ground, and at other times 
the tactical aircraft attacked lietminh artillery and flak positions. The 
fighters commonly dive bombed with bomb releases at 4,000 feet, and flights 
of two to three B-26s made low-1eve1 (8 to 1,200 feet) bomb runs. The

French also used PB4Y-2 patrol bombers in single-ship level bomb runs from 
10,000-12,000 foot altitudes. In the early days of the battle at Dien Bien 
Phu, French C-47s dropped napalm against suspected Red positions. Forced 
to attack from higher and safer altitudes, the French aircraft had greater 
difficulty locating and hitting the dispersed, dug-in, and carefully 
camouflaged Red artillery positions. Napalm, which had been so effective 
in the rice paddies of the Red River delta, made little impression against 
the canopied and rain-soaked forest cover on the hills around Dien Bien Phu. 
Communist ground-to-air fire was especially effective against French air-
craft in the early stages of the battle for Dien Bien Phu when attacking 
pilots were incautious and used stereotyped tactics.(106) After these 
initial losses, however, Americaaobservers reported that the French apparently 
decided to conserve aircraft at the expense of combat effectiveness.(107) 
The increasingly serious situation at Dien Bien Phu was reflected in 
developments at Paris and Washington. At a meeting of the French Council 
of National Defense in Paris on 11 March 1954, Defense Minister Pleven and 
Foreign Minister Bidault agreed to send General Ely to Washington on an 
information mission, which, among other matters, would seek to ascertain 
what the United states would do if Communist China eqployed its air force 
against the French Expeditionary Forces in Indochina. Before Ely could 
leave Paris, the surprisingly strong Vietminh attack against Dien Bien Phu 
made it evident that the French were in trouble. In a memorandum on 19 
March, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General Thomas D. White directed the 
Air Staff to examine as a matter of priority the capabilities of air forces 
to resolve the military problem in Indochina and to present conclusions on 
the subject of employing air force units there. Concerned with talk about 
employing US combat air and naval forces in support of the French, General 
Matthew B. Ridgway, Army Chief of Staff, sent a team of army experts to 
Vietnam to examine all factors that would need to be known in case American 
ground forces had to be deployed there. Since President Eisenhower also 
felt a need to get military information and judgment from sources in which 
he had utmost confidence, he ordered that General O'Daniel, then in Indo-
china on a tenporary basis, be designated as Chief of the MAAG at Saigon.(108) 
Earlier in the spring of 1954, well before the crisis at Dien Bien Phu, 
President Eisenhower had decided that any, prospective US military inter-
vention in Indochina must be based upon a legal right under international 
law, a favorable climate of free world opinion, and favorable action by 
Congress. Since he considered that there were adequate ground forces in 
Indochina, he had told his associates that he could see no value to putting 
US ground forces into Southeast Asia. President Eisenhower had reservations 
about employing US air strikes in support of the French, and he was not 
willing to consider these at all unless a coalition of powers including the 
British and French would give moral meaning to the intervention. (109) 
Following his arrival in Washington on 20 March, General Ely held con-
versations with President Eisenhower, Secretary Dulles, and the Chairman of 
the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Arthur W. Radford. Apparently, General

Ely did not completely understand the exact positions of the American leaders. 
When Ely and Radford met with President Eisenhower, Eisenhower directed 
Radford to give the French whatever they requested with priority. In view of 
his previously stated position, President Eisenhower was speaking of logis-
tical assistance, but Ely had the impression that there was no limit to the 
offer. In a meeting with the Secretary Of State, Dulles would not answer 
Ely's question of what the United States would do in the event of a Chinese 
Communist air attack, but Dulles said that overt US participation in the war 
would call for a better partnership than had prevailed with the French in the 
past, notably a willingness on the part of France to give independence tothe 
Associated States and to work cooperatively to expand the training of indigenous 
forces. In a number of talks with Admiral Radford, Ely was introduced to the 
possibility of direct US intervention against the Vietminh forces surrounding 
Dien Bien Phu with a force of 60 B-29 bombers, escorted by 150 carrier air-
craft of the US Seventh Fleet. General Ely reported the possibility of the 
American air strike -- soon nicknamed "Operation Vulture" -- to the French 
government, which on 29 March dispatched an officer to Vietnam to determine 
from General Navarre whether American intervention would be necessary to save 
Dien Bien Phu.(110) 
While the French pondered the possibility of American combat assistance, 
the battle for Dien Bien Phu entered a new stage. The Vietminh launched new 
massed attacks on the evening of 30 March, but French counterattacks met the 
assault with limited success. Taking advantage of a lessening tempo of 
Vietminh activity on 2-3 April, the French Union forces reinforced and 
adjusted their defenses enough to withstand another major Vietminh assault 
on the night of 4-5 April. The Communists were taking extremely heavy 
casualties: replacements employed on 4-5 April were young and poorly trained. 
(111) In Hanoi on 1-2 April, General Navarre heard the Paris emissary, 
Colonel Raymond Brohon, on the possible American air strike and, for the 
moment, doubted its advisability because he feared that it might trigger 
avert Chinese Communist intervention. (112) On the night of 3-4 April, how-
ever, Navarre reconsidered his position and messaged General Ely that the 
intervention of which Colonel Brohon had spoken "may have a decisive effect 
particularly if it comes before the Viet-Minh assault ."(113) In Paris on 3 
April, the French Government asked the United States to fly two battalions 
of paratroopers from France to Vietnam, beginning in about two weeks. Before 
the day ended this was approved and 15 April was specified as the date for 
the first airlift. (lib) At midnight on 4-5 April, French Premier Joseph 
Laniel explained the situation at Dien Bien Phu to US Ambassador Douglas 
Dillon and indicated that only American heavy bombers could destroy the 
Vietminh artillery around the besieged French forces. (115) Such strikes 
could be flown by American airmen, or, on the other hand, the French Govern-
ment asked the United States to consider the immediate loan of 10-20 B-29s 
to France, to be maintained by the USAF and flown by French aircrews. (116) 
In earlier references to Southeast Asia, Secretary Dulles had spoken 
of the determination of the United states to resist overt Chinese Communist 
aggression, but in a speech to the Overseas Press Club in Washington on

29 March he expressed strong opposition to the extension of Communism into 
Southeast Asia by "whatever means" and noted that the United States felt 
that this "should be met by united action."(117) This being stronger 
language than Dulles had previously used, British Foreign Minister Anthony 
Eden wanted to be sure that Dulles meant what he appeared to say: Eden 
though it important not to encourage the French by offers of limited military 
assistance that could not succeed. Accordingly, on 1 April, the British 
Ambassador informed Dulles that his government believed that the French situa-
tion in Indochina might be beyond salvage and that it was important not to 
jeopardize the forthcoming negotiations at Geneva.(118) 
After a discussion with President Eisenhower and acting at his direction, 
Secretary Dulles, Admiral Radford, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger 
lyes briefed the Indochina situation to a selected group of Congressional 
leaders on 3 April. The group included Senators Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard 
Russell, FArl Clements, Eugene Millikan, and William &lowland, and 
Representatives Joseph Martin, John W. McCormack, and J. Percy Priest. 
From the discussion it became clear that Congress would not support unilateral 
US intervention in Indochina. Instead, Congressional support would be con-
tingent upon three conditions: intervention must include a united action of 
Southeast Asian nations and the United Kingdom; the French would have to grant 
complete independence to the Associated States; the French must agree not to 
remove their forces when the other nations entered the conflict.(119) 
Since Congressional support for US air and naval assistance to France was 
now largely contingent upon a British alignment, President Eisenhower wrote 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill a personal letter on 4 April seeking united 
action. Three days later Churchill responded with little enthusiasm for the 
Eisenhower proposal. (120) In testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee on 5 April, Secretary Dulles revealed the extent of Communist Chinese 
activity around Dien Bien Phu and warned that the Red Chinese were ?coming 
awfully close" to overt military intervention, which President Eisenhower 
would not countenanae.(121) On 6 April, however, the United States informed 
France of the developments which would be necessary prior to a direct US 
intervention in Vietnam.(122) On this same day, the USAF recommended against 
lending 10-20 B-29 aircraft to the French: the planes would have to be flown 
from Clark Air Base; the French had little ability to operate B-293 and none 
to support them; and the large bombers probably would be ineffective against 
tactical targets existing in Indochina. (123) On 7 April, General Navarre also 
informed Paris that he did not have the capability to man borrowed B729s with 
flight crews and he posed the additional objection that, in the absence of 
fighter escort, the Communist Chinese might send in MIGs and shoot down the 
B-29s.(124) 
In the Far East, American officers sought to provide maximum logistical 
support to the French together with as much advice on the employment of 
weapons as very sensitive French commanders would accept. Prepared as a 
background input to USAF planning, a Far East Air Forces staff study completed

on 13 April was not very optimistic. This study noted that the French were 
still following their "arrogant" colonial policy in Indochina, which had so 
alienated native loyalties as to make a military solution in Vietnam prob-
ably impossible. Even so, rigid French ceilings on military manpower and 
reluctance to develop native forces had prevented what hope there might be 
to deal with the Vietminh. The French had not fully exploited the military 
power of airplanes, and as a result the French air force was insufficient to 
meet combat requirements at Dien Bien Phu, where the situation demanded 
interdiction of Vietminh supply routes leading to the area plus effective air 
strikes against the Vietminh concentrations ringing the fortress. (125) 
Despite the basic misgiving arising from the eroded political situation 
in Vietnam, both General Weyland and General Earle E. Partridge, who relieved 
Weyland in command of the Far East Air Forces on 26 March 1954, attempted to 
provide as much support as possible to the French air effort in relief of 
Dien Bien Phu. Eager for more aerial firepower against the Vietminh siege 
forces, the French high command on 18 March asked permission to use the 0-119 
transport aircraft that it had on loan from the Far East Air Forces to make 
drops of napalm upon the Communists, The French intended to fly such mis-
sions on moonlight nights. In January, General yland had ruled that the 
C-119s would be used only for air transport. In response to the new emergency, 
Wayland advised the French to use B.-26 combat aircraft for massed napalm 
drops, stated that tests of C-119s for dropping napalm during the Korean War 
had shown them too vulnerable for such work, but he nevertheless agreed that 
he would not attempt to prohibit the French from using the aircraft on napalm 
missions if such was believed necessary. (126) On 23 March, a C-119 loaded 
with 4,000 gallons of drummed napalm crashed while attempting to take off at 
Cat Bi and was damaged beyond repair, The French nevertheless continued to 
use 0-119 napalm drops around Dien Bien Phu during March and April and good 
results were reported, better than FEAFs tests in Korea had shown. (127) 
Implementing General Partridge's emphatic policy that "full, prompt, and 
effective" ammunition support should be provided to the French, the Far East 
Air Forces made air shipments of paraflares and white phosphorous bombs to 
Vietnam, while large Shipments of heavier ordnance went by surface vessel 
from Korea and Okinawa. (128) Early- in April, FEAF staff officers also called 
the attention of Major General Jacob E. Smart, Deputy for Operations, to the 
fact that FEAF had a large quantity of Hail or Lazy Dog munitions on hand, 
which had been manufactured for anti-personnel attacks during the Korean War 
but had never been used in combat. Each of these missiles was a small finned 
bullet, and 11,200 of them could be packed into a cluster adapter about the 
size and weight of a 500-lb bomb. The recommended tactic was to drop the 
clusters from 15,000 feet and burst them at 5,000 feet, allowing the finned 
bullets to attain a lethal velocity by the time they hit the ground. Con-
ventional trenches and foxholes would provide no protection against the 
vertical trajectory of the finned bullet. (129) On 7 April, General Smart 
offered to provide Hail missiles to the French, provided they were to be

used in relief of Dien Bien Phu under observation of FEAF officers. When 
the French accepted the conditions, 500 cluster adapters and 5 million of 
the finned bullets arrived at the port of Haiphong on 16 April. Lt Colonel 
William B. Sanders and Major Robert V. Prouty arrived at Saigon on 19 
April, and, pending the unloading of the bombs, visited Hanoi and Cat Bi 
to explain their operational employment. (130) 
The munitions ship carrying the Hail missiles was delayed getting 
berthing space at Haiphong and did not unload until 23 April. When the ship-
ment was unpacked, about half of the missiles were corroded and many had 
damaged fins that affected their ballistic flight. Although the FEAF observers 
recommended that the missiles be employed in a fairly large strike against 
personnel, the French preferred to use them against antiaircraft artillery 
batteries. Four PB4Y-2 aircraft, each carrying 12 cluster units, opened 
the attack on 26 April and through 2 May, the PB4Y-2s dropped 228 of the 
units and B-26s dropped 132. Colonel Sanders and Major Prouty were not 
able to get any concrete evaluation of the effectiveness of the missiles. 
The French, however, were happy with circumstantial evidence. On 30 April 
and I May the missile bombs were emp1o7ed extensively in support of air-
resupply missions, and on these dates -,he C-119s eperienced less anti-
aircraft fire than usual. In addition, the Vietminh were observed 
dispersing their antiaircraft batteries. On this basis, the French requested 
new shipments of the Hail missiles. In his formal report, Colonel Sanders 
stated that "the finned bullet attacks were successful but only due to 
volume rather than good delivery tactics."(131) Later on, same of the sur-
vivors from Dien Bien Phu reported that their Vieminh captors had questioned 
them about the Hail missiles, and one repatriated French officer stated that 
the "cigar Shaped pellets" were very effective against the Vietminh.(132) 
In an effort to get a better firsthand understanding of the situation in 
Indochina, Generals Partridge and Smart visited Vietnam from 14 through 18 
April and conferred with General Navarre at Hanoi before returning to Japan. 
While enroute homewards, Partridge radioed Brigadier General Joseph D. 
Caldera, Commander, PEA' Bomber Command (Provisional), to meet him at Haneda 
Air Base at Tokyo when his plane touched down there. Here Partridge told 
Caldera that Navarre had asked for supporting air strikes. Partridge 
instructed Caldera to go to Vietnam and confer with the French. Partridge 
specifically enjoined that Caldera would have complete operational control 
over any operation flown by his 3-29 bombers and that the bomber force would 
be employed as a total unit under mass-strike conditions. At this juncture, 
Caldera had available for combat the 98th Bombardment Wing with 32 B-29s at 
Yokota Air Base in Japan and the 19th and 307th Bombardment Wings with 67 
B-29s at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa.(133) 
Traveling with selected members of his staff in a B-17 rather than a 
3-29 to avoid an appearance of action on the part of the FEAF Bomber Command, 
General Caldera left Japan on 19 April and went directly to Saigon where he 
reported to Robert McClintock, the Charge d'Affaires at the American Embassy.

The Bomber Command staff was quartered at a downtown Saigon hotel, but 
only Caldera participated with McClintock and French officials in con-
versations at the Governor General's palace. On the basis of intelligence 
briefings and personal flights over Dien Bien Phu, General Caldera and his 
staff prepared a plan to fly a maximum effort strike with 1/10-second 
delay fused 500-pound general purpose bombs against the enemy forces who 
were lightly dug in around Dien Bien Phu. "The bombing raid," Caldera 
would reminisce, "could have effectively destroyed the entire enemy force 
surrounding Dien Bien Phu." According to General Navarre, the Caldera 
saturation-bombing plan required ground-based radar guidance, which could 
not be provided. Thus a mass strike so close to the entrenched can was 
out of the question, although Navarre indicated that he would have welcomed 
an American air strike against the major Vietminh supply base at Tuan Giao, 
the road-junction town about 50 miles northeast of Dien Bien Phu. In his 
recollection of this actions and conversations, General Caldera noted that 
General Navarre repeatedly requested information as to whether the B-29s 
could destroy the hostile antiairc&ft capability around Dien Bien Phu. 
Caldera also made a personal aerial'reconnaissance of the enemy supply 
lines from Dien Bien Phu to the Chihese border and presented targets to 
the French. He recalled that in Hanoi he discovered that the French 
possessed more fighter-bombers and light bombers than were being used on 
any given day, and that Brigadier General Jean Dechaux, the Commander of 
the Northern Area tactical air force, told him that the French air force was 
restricted as to the number of aircraft it could commit to a given strike.(134) 
During the same period that General Caldera was beginning his operational 
survey in Vietnam, Secretary Dulles had arrived in Paris and was told on 19 
April by Minister Bidault and General Ely that the situation at Dien 
Bien Phu was "virtually hopeless" and could not be saved except by massive 
US air intervention. Dulles suggested that Navarre and 01Eaniel ought to 
hold an emergency consultation. Or 23 April, however, in response to a request 
from Navarre to Paris that Operation Vulture be flown, Dulles told Bidault 
that B-29 intervention seemed out of the question under the -casting circum-
stances. Dulles conferred with Admiral Radford on the matter when Radford 
arrived in Paris on the evening of 24 April. They both now comidered the 
time to be too late for American support to be provided at Dien Bien Phu, 
but, as will be seen, their discussions with the French and British involved 
new allied policy to follow a French defeat in northwest Tonkin.(135) 
In Vietnam, General Caldera did not consider that he had been able to 
arrive at a meeting of minds with the French that would permit him to follow 
his instructions and enploy the Far East Air Forces Bomber Command as a mass-
strike force. He so informed General Partridge, who directed him to return 
to Bomber Command headquarters in Japan, which he did on 28 April. (136) 
Interestingly enough, Caldera did not learn for many years that the proposed 
B-29 operation was called "Operation Vulture." He thought this to be "a 
helluva name for Smokey Joe f5aldera7 and his Fearless Flyers in the FEAF 
Bomber Command."(137)

Although American combat air intervention was ruled out, there was 
still some hope for continued French resistance at Dien Bien Phu if the 
embattled garrison could be effectively reinforced and if its aerial sup-
ply could be maintained. The arrival of the French paratroopers from 
France who were being flown to Vietnam by USAF aircraft would permit 
release of experienced paratroop battalions held in reserve at Hanoi. 
Actually though, such reinforcement of Dien Bien Phu, as well as the dis-
patch of relief columns eastward from Laos, depended upon air transport 
supply. If the air transport planes could not buildupsupplies at Dien 
Bien Phu, reinforcements would be of little value. The thrust of Foreign 
Legion and Laotian troops from Northern Laos to Dien Bien Phu -- called 
Operation Condor -- would require air resupply whenit moved out eastward 
on 21 April. 
Alerted on 3 April for "Project Bali-Hai" -- the air movement of French 
paratroopers and some additional naval personnel to Vietnam -- the United 
States Air Force in Europe initially planned to accomplish the task with 
C-119 aircraft belonging to its 322d Air Division (Combat Cargo). These 
plans failed on 6 April when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to 
permit aircraft flight over India with French troops, even though the 
troops would be unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes. Because of 
longer distances between way stations, USAF directed the 62d Troop Carrier 
Wing to deploy C-124 aircraft from Larson Air Force Base, Washington, and 
perform the airlift. On 20 April, 6 C-124s picked up 514 passengers at 
Paris and Tunis and made the trip to Vietnam, with refueling stops at 
Tripoli, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Thailand. The planes 
unloaded at Tourane on 23-24 April. The second lift of 5 C-124s departed 
Marseilles with 452 passengers on 5 May and followed the same route except 
for overflying Dhahran, since King Ibn Saud had been angered by French-Arab 
relations in North Africa and would not allow a landing. The second lift 
arrived at Tourane on 8-9 May. All of the aircraft made the flights without 
incident, but the reouirement to by-pass India necessitated a long and 
hazardous over-water flight from Ceylon to Bangkok via the Nicobar Islands, 
passing south of the southern tip of Burma. (13t1) 
Anticipating the arrival of the additional troops from France, General 
0T Daniel outlined a plan for the relief of Dien Bien Phu that would have 
used forces held in reserve in the Hanoi perimeter. He visualized a para-
drop of three battalions at Dien Bien Phu plus an attack out of the Hanoi 
perimeter to Dien Bien Phu by armored groups and mechanized infantry. 
Because of Navarre's sensitivity to American advice, O'Daniel gave the 
plan to Mr. McClintock, who presented it to Commissioner DeJean. While 
the plan was considered, it was not accepted.(139) On 26 April, however, 
Navarre turned down a similar plan offered by Major General Rene Cogny, 
the commander at Hanoi, on the grounds that an operation from the perimeter 
would be too far distant from Dien Bien Phu, would deprive the Red River 
delta of needed defense and would drain the airlift capabilities required 
to sustain Dien Bien Phu.(140)

The arrival of the reinforcenents did permit General Navarre to drop 
small increments of the 1st Colonial Parachute Battalion into Dien Bien 
Phu on the nights of 3-5 May, but another planned troop drop in support 
of the Condor force had to be cancelled because of the scarcity of airlift. 
During April and early May, both French combat aircraft and air transport 
planes were vitally required. at Dien Bien Phu, but they were operating 
under severe restrictions of adverse weather, terrain, and hostile ground 
fire. Except for French carrier-based fighters, both the combat aircraft 
and the transport planes operated from the Hanoi area and were affected by 
weather there as well as over Dien Bien Phu. In early May, the "Cat Paw" 
detachment of the 483d Troop Carrier Wing which maintained the C-119s at 
Cat Bi Airfield had secured a Ground Control Approach (GCA) radar, but it 
would not be installed, and weather operations by relatively undisciplined 
pilots in the Hanoi area would often be hazardous. "The French," one 
American observer noted, "are not very well disciplined in air traffic 
control. They will navigate to a: homer and descend at each individual's 
discretion without consideration of lateral or vertical separation."(141) 
Air operations in the vicinity of Dien Bien Phu were under the nominal 
direction of an  ir controller insthe garrison there, but General Hewitt 
reported that the scheduling of planes into the area tended to be sporadic, 
causing times of very heavy congestion both of the air and of radio 
frequencies and other periods of very light activity. (l1.2) 
The combination of well-trained Communist antiaircraft artillery per-
sonnel admirably sited in terrain which channelized air approaches to the 
drop zone at Dien Bien Phu effected growing destruction to French aircraft. 
As the Communists trenched closer-to the French positions, the drop zone 
shrank to a diameter of about 2,000 yards by late April. Communist anti-
aircraft weapons sited on the high ridges on each side of the drop zone 
could catch aircraft flying through "the slot" at Dien Bien Phu in a 
murderous cross fire. To escape the flak, French C-47s commonly dropped 
parabundles from 10,000 feet, a safe altitude in that the C-47s might have 
to make several passes over the target before their complete loads could 
be kicked out. In deference to the ground fire, the C-119s raised their 
drop altitude to 5,000 feet, from which altitude they dumped their loads 
quickly in a single pass. The CAT-pilots were not entirely safe from flak 
at this height; they also complained that French C-47s dropped parabundles 
through their flights and that escorting flak suppression aircraft were 
known to drop bombs through their formations. These were hazardous condi-
tions for civilian crews, whose contracts did not call for flights into 
active combat areas. (1/13) In an effort to increase dropping accuracy from 
8,000-10,000 feet, French airborne technicians devised a procedure whereby 
a reefing line was used to hobble a cargo parachute until it neared the 
ground, at which time an explosive time-delay fuse cut the reefing line and 
allowed the parachute to deploy. Since the device appeared to work, the 
detachment of the US Army 8081st Quartermaster Airborne Supply and Packaging 
Company, which loaded the C-119s at Cat Bi adopted the parachute delay

apparatus and used it on all C-119 air drops during the last two weeks of 
the Dien Bien Phu campaign. (144) With the device, C-119 crews claimed that 
they could put cargo pallets in a 330 yard square from 10,000 feet, but the 
official French supply report from Dien Bien Phu noted that the device was 
disastrous ? on 27 April when only one-third of C-119 supplies could be 
retrieved. (1145) 
Among cargo-dropping aircrews -- both French and American -- there Was 
general agreement that escorting flak suppression flights operated too high 
to be effective and were not infrequently absent when the air transports 
needed them. (146) In April 483d Troop Carrier Wing records showed that 19 
C-119s received flak damage (major damage in 9 cases) while flying 477 
sorties to deliver 7,868 tons of supplies toDien Bien Phn0(147) On 24 -April, 
CAT-pilot Paul Holden was badly injured by 37-mm fragments, whereupon his 
fellow civilian pilots refused to fly to Dien Bien Phu again until they 
received adequate combat air support. (i18) Arrangements were made for 
French military pilots to man the vacant C-119 pilot seats, but on 26 
April Red flak shot down an F-6F and two B-26s. In view of the situation, 
General Lauzin assigned an absolute priority to flak suppression missions, 
at the epense of close air support strikes for the Dien Bien Phu defenders 
and interdiction of Vietminh supply lines.(149) 
Accompanied by very heavy flak suppression efforts including a heavy 
concentration of Hail missiles, the GAT pilots returned to their C-119s on 
30 April, and aerial resupply went well during this and the following two 
days. Heavy rains from monsoon clouds then greatly reduced aerial supply 
on 3-5 May, but on 6 May both flak suppression flights and transport sorties 
were flown in an intensive effort. Throughout the morning, Communist gun 
positions were either neutralized or elected to avoid revealing their posi-
tions, but in the late afternoon 37-mm guns opened up to score hits on a 
C-119 and to shoot down another C-119, flown by a legendary CAT pilot --
James B. McGovern, or "Earthquake McGoon" as he had come to be known in the 
Far East in deference to his huge size and bushy black beard. A Fourteenth 
Air Force fighter pilot in World War II, McGovern had remained in Asia with 
the Civil Air Transport Company and now died in the C-119 crash. (150) 
With the delivery of 196 tons of supplies on 6 May, the Dien Bien Phu 
garrison was in better shpe, although the heavy delivery did not compensate 
for a nuMber of poor supply days in the preceding two weeks. As it hap-
pened, however, the supply delivery on 6 May was not too important since 
Ho Chi Minh had given the order for a final assault to begin on the evening 
of that day. From its contacts within the close circle of Ho Chi Minh's 
advisors, French intelligence was able to inform the Dien Bien Phu garrison 
that the assault was coming. But in the preceding month the Vietminh divi-
sions had tunnelled closer and closer and were in good position for an all-
out assault. At 1730 hours on 6 May the Vietminh began a heavy artillery 
barrage, which was followed by massed infantry attacks. The Vietminh 
advanced without regard to casualties. At about noon on 7 May, the Vietminh 
308th Division broke into the heart of the French defenses, and the battle

was over by that evening. According to French statistics as of 5 May, the 
French Union forces had sustained 8221 casualties at Dien Bien Phu since 
November 1953 and the garrison on 5 May numbered 8,158 men. An unknown 
number of the French troops were killed in the last fighting; 885 wounded 
men were turned over to the French for repatriation; some men escaped; and 
about 7,000 men were kept by the Vietminh as prisoners of war. In the 
campaign the Vietminh lost 7,900 killed and an estimated 15,000 wounded. 
(151) While the Vietminh had suffered heavier personnel casualties than 
the French, Ho Chi Minh had scored a major political victory which was 
obviously timed to coincide with the beginnings of negotiations in Geneva. 
During March and April 1954, while attention was given to expedited 
actions that might assist the French at Dien Bien Phu, the main thrust of 
US military planning was concerned With a larger question of more extensive 
intervention in Indochina that would be required to meet an overt Chinese 
Communist aggression. The preparation of such contingency plans had to be 
based upon background studies which evaluated environmental factors, out-
lined force requirements, and considered necessary command arrangements. 
As directed on 19 March, the USAF Directorate of Plans assembled a 
task force of representatives from the Air Staff, the Tactical Air Command, 
and the Air Training Command, who on 19 April completed a study of the 
capabilities of air forces to affect military operations in Indochina. This 
study offered the general conclusion that airpower could contribute to the 
efforts of friendly surface forces in a war confined to the geographical 
boundaries of Indochina, but that it would be seriously limited in its 
effectiveness by the character of the enemy operations, the terrain, the 
weather, the lack of a will to fight on the part of the indigenous popula-
tion, the general scarcity df good air targets, and of target information. 
It further concluded that in the event of Chinese Communist intervention, 
air attacks could be progressively directed against mainland China's lines 
of communication and ultimately against her economic, governmental, military, 
and urban centers. While lacking in much essential detail, the study was 
not too optimistic about air intervention within Indochina. (152) 
While this Air Force study was in progress, Major General James M. 
Gavin, Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Operations, US Army, headed 
the team of Army experts that General Ridgway dispatched to Southeast Asia. 
Members of this team visited Taiwan, Saigon, and Thailand, and the team 
report envisioned that some eight US divisions, plus some 35 engineer 
battalions, would be required to fight in the Hanoi delta and possibly to 
seize Red China's Hainan Island, which flanked the Tonkin seacoast. Logis-
tical support requirements in Southeast Asia would be tremendous since the 
area lacked good ports, airfields, land communications, and air facilities. 
Based upon the team's findings, Gavin concluded: ulimle finally decided when 
we were all through what we were talking about doing was going to war with 
Red China under conditions that were appallingly disadvantageous." General 
Ridgway passed the Army report up to President Eisenhower, and he believed 
that the report had a considerable effect upon the President.(153)

The preparation DI' contingency plans required new studies of the 
American theater command arrangements in the Pacific-Far East. In 1950 
the US Far East Command with headquarters in Tokyo had been responsible 
for US security interests throughout East Asia, but in 1951 and 1952 the 
Far East Command's area of responsibility was reduced to include the 
Ryukyu Islands, Japan, Korea, and Mainland China north of the 32d Parallel. 
Other areas of the Pacific-Far East, including Southeast Asia and Mainland 
China south of the 32d Parallel were then assigned to the US Pacific Com-
mand, with headquarters in Hawaii. The Air Force did not have enough 
tactical air unit strength to organize a separate theater air force in each 
of the theaters. Accordingly, all tactical air units and air facilities in 
East Asia continued to be under the Far East Air Forces. Since no tactical 
air force units were assigned to the Pacific Command and in view of stringent 
personnel limitations, the Air Force did not organize a theater air force 
headquarters under the Commander-in-Chief Pacific (CINCPAC) but instead gave 
the senior Air Force officer located on Hawaii (who happened to be the com-
mander of the Military Air Transport Service's Pacific Division) additional 
duty as Commander, US Air Force Pacific (COMUSAFPAC). Without a staff or 
units to command, COMUSAFPAC was unable to take part in any operational 
planning generated by CINCPAC.(154) Upon repeated recommendations from 
CINCPAC, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed on 31 March 1954 that the Air 
Force would established a Headquarters, Pacific Air Force, at Hickam Air 
Force Base. While Commander, Pacific Air Force was to be directly responsible 
to CINCPAC, the Joint Chiefs stated that he would act as a subordinate com-
mander to Commander, Far East Air Forces on matters pertaining solely to the 
United States Air Force.(155) 
During the winter of 19.53-1954, the Far East Air Forces provided logis-
tical support to the French Union Forces on direct orders from Washington 
even though Southeast Asia was under the theater jurisdiction of Admiral 
Felix Stump as CINCPAC. When the time came to plan a formal contingency 
operation for supporting the French Union Forces and for evacuation of US 
personnel from Indochina, however, the Joint Chiefs of Staff assigned the 
task to CINCPAC. As directed, Admiral Stump issued a draft plan on 28 
April and followed it up with several operations plans for various contin-
gencies on 4 May. Following a pattern that he had already used in organizing 
the US contribution to the defense of Taiwan, Admiral Stump established a 
Southeast Asia Defense Command as a subordinate unified command directly 
under CINCPAC and charged COMSEADEFOOM to plan and prepare for operations in 
Indochina. The subunified commander would be provided with Navy, Air Force, 
and Central Intelligence Agency forces, and he was instructed to make provisions 
to employ up to eight Army divisions at a later date. In regard to his rela-
tions with the French, Admiral Stump specified that COMEADEFCOM would 
coordinate his operations with the CINC French Armed Forces Far East; he 
could assume operational control over French Union Forces, but the French CINC 
would not be permitted to command US forces. The Chief of MAAG Indochina 
would continue to coordinate logistical support for French Union Forces, but 
he would report to COMSEADEFCOM for additional planning and liaison duties.

At the start, US naval and air force forces would support the French 
Union Forces, but US operations would be expanded into a coordinated air, 
ground, naval action to destroy Communist forces in Indochina and to 
reduce the Chinese Communist capability to wage aggression in Indochina. 
CINCPAC would direct the execution of attacks against Mainland China with 
conventional and atomic weapons, out atomic weapons would be employed only 
on specific direction and only against targets supporting enemy action in 
Indochina. The Commander, Strategic Air Command, would conduct conven-
tional and atomic attacks against targets specified by CINCPAC, who would 
exercise control over the assignment of targets, timing of attack, and 
other coordination to insure that the attacks were limited to strictly mili-
tary targets. COMSEADEFCOM would maintain his headquarters afloat until 
he was directed to go ashore at Saigon.(156) 
Senior Air Force officers in Washington and Tokyo were already con-
cerned about the compartmentation of airpower involved in the division of 
the Pacific-Far East between two US unified theater commands. Air Force 
studies showed that possible contingencies in the Far East -- especially 
simultaneous Red Chinese aggression in both Korea and Southeast Asia --
would be difficult to oppose with divided American responsibilities, and 
the studies indicated to air planners that one US theater command --
preferably the Far East Command -- should be given an undivided authority 
in East Asia.(157) The Far East Air Forces staff was additionally troubled 
by Admiral Stump's organizational pattern which utilized subordinate unified 
commanders, each of whom would control packets of tactical air units. This 
arrangement was contrary to Air FOrce experience, which had shown that air-
power should be centrally controlled and employed when and where it was most 
needed. As soon as he had studied Admiral Stump's operations plans for 
Southeast Asia, General Partridge informed the Air Force on 4 May that he 
was distressed by the impending division of Far East Air Forces resources 
between two theater commands and now another subunified defense command.(158) 
In additional thinking on the command problem in Southeast Asia, Major 
General K. P. McNaughton, Vice Commander, Far East Air Forces, called 
attention to the fact that Admiral Stump was somewhat insensitive to Franco-
American relations. He had no idea that France would place its forces in 
Indochina under CINCPAC or COMSEALEFCOM, and he believed that France ought 
to be treated as a respectable great power. In a personal communication to 
Air Force Plans, McNaughton suggested that the joint war effort in Indochina 
should be given over-all direction from a Military Council, to be located 
in Paris and staffed by representatives of the US and French Chiefs of Staff. 
He recommended that military operations in Indochina should be directed by 
individual army, navy, and air force commanders, located in close proximate 
headquarters and jointly responsible for joint matters but each in command 
of their respective forces. The land force commander would be from the French 
Army, the naval commander from either the US Navy or the French Navy, and the 
Air Force commander would be a US Air Force officer, who would command all 
Air Farce theater air force units throughout the Pacific, as well as in 
Southeast Asia. This air commander would be able to deploy and employ air 
units anywhere they might be nee1ed.(159)

While the Pacific commanders were preparing their recommendations, 
President Eisenhower and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were making their own 
studies of a proposed command structure and concept of operations for 
Indochina. To get French thinking, President Eisenhower sent General 
Trapnell to Paris to discuss command arrangements with General Ely, who 
would relieve General Navarre as CINC French Union Forces in Indochina 
on 3 June and would also serve as French Commissioner General. Ely was 
not willing to accept any over-all American commander in Indochina and 
was also unenthusiastic about American ground troops, although he thought 
one or two US divisions might be acceptable as a show of good faith.(160) 
Completed on 22 May and briefed to President Eisenhower on 28 May, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff plan for Indochina emphasized that in the event of 
overt Red Chinese aggression and US intervention, the United States should 
not rely upon a static type of defense as in Korea but rather upon an 
offensive against Mainland China facilities supporting the aggression. 
Based upon this appreciation, the Joint Chiefs recommended that US par-
ticipation should be primarily limited to fast carrier task forces and 
USAF forces operating from bases outside Indochina. They strongly recom-
mended that the French should agree to firm programs to build indigenous 
defense forces as a prerequisite to US participation in the conflict. As 
for command, the Joint Chiefs recommended establishment of a top-level 
committee of military representatives, drawn from France, the United States, 
and other nations contributing substantial forces. In Indochina, the 
Allied CINC would be French, with an American deputy who would have a suf-
ficient staff to provide liaison with the French and coordinate US activ-
ities. The French CINC would also be provided with a US Air Advisor. 
CINCPAC would exercise command over all US forces based in Indochina and 
over other forces assigned to him for operations in Indochina. When the 
brie-Ped for him, President Eisenhower noted that he approved of 
the thinking that it included, although he did not believe that overt 
Chinese Com/mist aggression was likely. (161) 
If the American contingency plan for Indochina had been put into 
effect, CINCPAC and COMSEADEFCOM would have assumed direction over Strategic 
Air Command strikes and control over FEAF forces operating in or against 
Indochina. General Partridge therefore hurried the preparations to activate 
the Pacific Air Force headquarters, which opened under the command of Major 
General Sary Smith at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, on 1 July 1954.(162) 
In conversations with General Twining at a USAF Commander's conference on 
24-25 May, Partridge indicated that in the event of US intervention in Indo-
china he would favor a full use of US Navy aircraft from fast carrier task 
forces and noted that what he had seen in Indochina did not make him very 
enthusiastic about employing B-29s there with conventional weapons. In a 
personal message to Twining on 7 June, Partridge spelled out his thoughts 
in greater detail. He conceived that the war in Indochina was basically a 
civil war, where long-term pacification and unification (as opposed to 
destruction) were the prime objectives. He urged that the employment of

conventionally-armed B-29s against Indochina targets might provide favor-
able Short-term psychological effects upon French and Vietnamese forces 
but could not possibly produce decisive results. He did not think that 
the United States would do well to use indecisive, destructive air attacks, 
when the real task in Indochina was to build indigenous military, economic, 
political, and psychological leadership.(163) 
On the political level, President Eisenhower was in basic agreement 
with the Congressional belief that the United States should not intervene 
in Indochina without broad-based international support, but he was none-
theless convinced that Indochina was of major strategic significance to 
the Free World. In response to a newsman's question on 7 April, Eisenhower 
explained that Indochina was strategically important because it produced 
basic raw materials (tin, timesten, rubber) needed by the world, because 
it provided potential markets for a new, democratically-oriented Japan, 
because the surrender of any free people to Communist dictatorship was 
inimical to freedom, and because the loss of Vietnam would expose other 
Southeast Asian nations to Communist aggression. In illustration of the 
last point, he referred to the "falling domino' principle," or, as he said, 
"You have a row of dominos set up, you knock over the first one, and what 
will happen to the last one is the certainty it will go over very quickly. 
So you have tbe beginning of a disintegration that would have profound 
influences."(164) 
Convinced of the importance of Indochina, President Eisenhower and 
Secretary Dulles believed that a Show of Free World solidarity was neces-
sary to strengthen French resolution on 8 May, when negotiatiors from the 
United Kingdom, Soviet Union, France, United States, Communist China, 
Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and the Vietminh regime commenced discussions in 
Geneva. In Great Britain, Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Minister 
Eden were willing to discuss the establishment of a Southeast Asia regional 
defense organization, but they were more immediately interested in the 
success of negotiations at Geneva. They were very fearful that Franco-
American military planning might unduly encourage France and threaten the 
success of the Geneva negotiations,(165) For their part, the French began 
the Geneva talks at a time of great disadvantage. The French people were 
tired of the long losses, and the Vietminh victory at Dien Bien Phu was 
very damaging to both French and Vietnamese morale. The Vietminh, moreover, 
did not rest after their victory, but began to move troops and weapons 
toward Hanoi. On the night of 12 May 500 Vietnamese regulars deserted with 
their weapons at Hanoi; the French enclave was already riddled with 
guerrillas; and General Cogny, although optimistic with newsmen, let the 
American Consulate know that he had grave doubts about holding the Red River 
Delta. (166) In the emergency, the French war council directed that the 
safety of the Expeditionary Corps in Vietnam was now the prime consideration 
of the French Union Commander. He was directed to plan successive with-
drawals in the Red River perimeter, and, if possible, he would hold a line 
at the 18th parallel to safeguard the southern areas of Indochina. (167)

In the negotiations in Geneva, the Vietminh delegate, Pham Van Dong, 
appeared in no hurry to reach a cease-fire, and, as the discussions dragged 
on through Mr and most of June, President Eisenhower and Prime Minister 
Churchill grew closer together in their views. At a meeting in Washington 
on 25-28 June, Eisenhower and Churchill accepted a seven-point joint posi-
tion which they offered to the French Government as the basis for an 
armistice agreement that would be respected by the United States and Great 
Britain. Such an armistice would: (1) preserve the integrity and indepen-
dence of Laos and Cambodia and assure withdrawal of Vietminh forces from 
those countries; (2) preserve at least the part of Vietnam south of a line 
drawn inland from Long Hoi (roughly midway between the 17th and 18th 
parallels) and possibly an enclave in the Red River Delta as non-Communist 
territory; (3) not impose on Laos, Cambodia, and non-Communist Vietnam any 
restrictions impairing their right to maintain adequate forces for internal 
security, to import arms, or to employ foreign advisers; (4) not contain 
political provisions that would risk loss of the non-Communist area of 
Vietnam to Communist control; (5) not exclude the possibility of the 
ultimate reunification of Vietnam by peaceful means; (6) provide for the 
peaceful and humane transfer, under international supervision, of the 
Vietnamese who desired to move from one zone to another; (7) provide 
effective machinery for international supervision of the agreement. There 
was one all Anglo-American disagreement on the seven points: Churchill 
and Eden wanted merely to inform the French of the "hope" that the French 
would not accept less than the seven points, while Eisenhower and Dulles 
wanted themregarded as "minimal" negotiating points. (168) The joint 
statement issued by Churchill and Eisenhower pledged that the United States 
and Great Britain would press forward with plans for the collective defense 
of Southeast Asia and warned that "if at Geneva the French Government is 
confronted with demands which prevent an acceptable agreement regarding 
Indochina, the international situation will be seriously aggravated."(169) 
When the principal negotiators returned to Geneva beginning on 8 July, 
the most serious discussions centered upon a dividing line in Vietnam. The 
French insisted upon the 18th parallel, while Pham Van Dong argued that the 
Vietminh were in control of the central Vietnam highlands and that the 14th 
parallel should be the demarcation. The Red Chinese Foreign Minister Chou 
En-Lai appeared more interested in demilitarizing Indochina, thus denying 
possible bases there to the United States. It is also possible that Red 
China recognized that the United States would not accept the 14th parallel, 
and that the atomic might of the United States could not be pressed too 
far. Following a private discussion between the new French Premier Pierre 
Mendes-France and Chou En-Lai in Berne, the Vietminh were willing to accept 
the 17th parallel as a dividing line and the Geneva negotiations moved for-
ward so rapidly that US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs 
Walter Robertson would later charge that the Geneva agreements were not 
negotiated but represented "a deal between Chou En-Lai and Mendes-France, 
negotiated privately in Berne and brought to the conference as a fait 
accompli."(170)

As concluded on 21 July, the Geneva Agreements on Indochina comprised 
separate military accords for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, an unsigned 
final declaration of the Geneva nations, and a number of unilateral national 
declarations. The military agreement for Vietnam was signed by military 
representatives of the Vietminh and French Union Forces. It provided for a 
provisional military demarcation line at the 17th parallel (as well as a 
demilitarized zone on each side of the line) and for the removal of French 
Expeditionary Forces and the Vietminh to their respective sides of the line. 
It banned the introduction of frestrcops, military personnel, arms and 
munitions, or the building of military bases in Vietnam. Worn-out military 
equipment could be replaced on a piece-by-piece basis and personnel could 
be rotated on a man-for-man account, but the agreement prohibited reinforce-
ments "in the forms of all types of arms, munitions, and other war materiel, 
such as combat aircraft, naval craft, pieces of ordnance, jet engines and 
jet weapons, and armoured vehicles." The military agreement on Laos pro-
vided for the withdrawal of Vietminh fo:ces and for the concentration of 
Pathet Lao troops at specific locations in Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces 
pending national unification elections to be held in the summer of 1955. 
The French were authorized to leave 3,500 troops in Laos at Seno and 
Vientiane and to keep 1,500 instructors with the Royal Laotian Army. In the 
case of Cambodia, Vietminh forces were to be removed and Khmer Issarak 
dissidents reincorporated in the national community. In Vietnam, Laos, 
and Cambodia, International Control Commissions, with representatives from 
Canada, India, and Poland, would supervise the agreements. When dealing 
with questions involving violations or threats of violations that might lead 
to resumed hostilities the International Control Commissions were required 
to act with unanimity. The final declaration of the Geneva conference pro-
vided that Vietnamese elections would be held by July 1956, to be preceded 
by preparatory consultations between competent representatives of the two 
zones which were to begin not later than 20 July 1955.(171) 
In the final hours of the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union pressed 
for a resolution to require formal acceptance of the final declaration. 
The United States was not prepared, however, to join the final declaration, 
but the American delegate, Under Secretary of State Walter B. Smith, issued 
a statement which provided that tne United States would "refrain from the 
threat or the use of force to distarlba the agreements and would "view any 
renewal of the aggression in violation of the . . . agreements with grave 
concern and as seriously threatening international peace and security." 
The delegate from the State of Vietnam solemnly protested the hasty con-
clusion of the negotiations by an agreement in which it was not a party. 
He expressed concern that the French High Command had further arrogated to 
itself a right to fix a date of a future Vietnamese election, which was 
clearly of a political rather than a military character. (172) The official 
Soviet statement on the Geneva agreements noted that the decisions 
prohibiting establishment of foreign military bases in Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia, as well as the commitments of these countries not to enter military 
alliances, were "of greatest importance." It further declared that the 
decision to hold free elections t.n Vietnam "creates conditions for the 
national unification of Vietnam in conformity with the national interests 
and aspirations of the entire Vietnamese people."(173)

Alerted by General Cogny's pessimistic view of the situation in the 
Red River Delta reported on 13 May 1954, General Partridge directed all 
Far East Air Forces detachments in Indochina to make quiet plans to 
evacuate both Tonkin and other parts of Indochina on short notice. (174) 
Under this direction, the personnel of the /483d Troop Carrier Wing, 
8081st Aerial Resupply Unit, and the FEALOGFtDR Provisional Maintenance 
Squadron which comprised the "Cat Paw" 0-119 detachment at Cat Bi Air-
field were moved to Tourane (Da Nang) Airfield on 22 May. Although safer, 
Tourane was nevertheless comparable to an island in an enemy sea of 
rural areas controlled by the Vietminh. Five enlisted members (three Air 
Force and two Army men) of the detachment were captured by Vietminh guer-
rillas on 14 June while they were on an illicit swimming party outside 
the perimeter defenses. These men were held prisoner until 31 August when 
they were released to the French. Within the perimeter, the Americans heard 
small arms and artillery fire each night; aircraft setting down at Tourane 
were subjected to harassing fire; and on 13 July the Vietminh directed fire 
across the runways. (175) 
While the Far East Air Forces couIi control the movement and Evacuation 
of its own personnel, it was harder pressed to determine what was expected 
of it in other Evacuations. Planning for the implementation of "ProjF!ct 
Wounded Warrior" began as early as 10 June, when the French requested 
United States help in moving repatriated wounded from Dien Bien Phu to 
France. After many starts and stops, the project was finally initiated by 
C-1214 aircraft on 26 June. Under the operations plan, FEAF's. 315th Air 
Division and 61481st Medical Air Evacuation Group handled the evacuation 
from Saigon hospitals to Tachikawa Air Base near Tokyo via Clark Air Base. 
The Military Air Transport Service accepted the patients in Japan and 
evacuated them through the United States to destinations in France and North 
Africa. Five C-124 flights from 26 June to 10 July moved the 504 repa-
triates out of Vietnam.(176) Except for the problem of coordinating flight 
schedules and the availability of patients for movement on a given day, 
"Wounded Warrior" progressed smoothly. The employment of airlift in 
evacuating US, friendly-foreign, and Vietnamese nationals from Hanoi gave 
more difficulty, chiefly because of a lack of coordination among the various 
US agencies involved. At the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
CINCPAC undertook on 3 July 1954 to prepare plans for the recovery of US 
personnel and materiel from Indochina. CINCPAC directed MAAG Indochina to 
recover or destroy MDAP materiel and the Commander Naval Forces Philippines 
(COMNAVPH1L) to evacuate US nationals and selected aliens. NO one knew the 
magnitude of the tasks, and planning was conducted on the basis of gross 
rumors. In an aura of great confusion, FEAF air transport planes evacuated 
USAF personnel, the Philippine Air Lines evacuated Filipino residents of 
Hanoi, Civil Air Transport planes lifted Chinese evacuees, while French and 
Vietnamese civil and military aircraft, French naval vessels, the US Navy 
Fifth Amphibious Group, and the US Military Sea Transport Service lifted 
NEAP supplies and Vietnamese refugees to safe havens in South Vietnam. The 
confused evacuation from Tonkin began on 10 July and continued into the 
autumn of 1954 as some 880,000 persons moved southward.(177)

In Washington on 21 July in quick response to the Geneva cease-fire, 
the Office of Secretary of Defense directed immediate suspension to the 
delivery of all M1AP equipment. This instruction was supplemented by a 
second memorandum on 24 July, which directed the US military departments 
to cease unloading MBAP cargo on US controlled vessels in Indochina ports. 
A third memorandum on 3 August provided that undelivered and diverted 
equipment scheduled for Indochina would be used to empedite the buildup 
of military aid to Taiwan, Thailand, Japan, and the Philippine Islands, 
pending a revalidation of the aid programs for Indochina. (178) In response 
to these directions, USAF implemented nProject Paper Sack" which froze 
MDAP Shipments from the United States, diverted airlifted supply already 
enroute to a holding location at Clark Air Base, and took delivery of water-
borne supplies at the US military ports of Manila, Okinawa, and Yokohama. 
Considerable materiel -- notably ammunition -- was proceeding to Indochina 
on French vessels, and the title to these shipments had already passed to 
France. In case this and other NEAP equipment could not be used, the 
United States could legally recover it, but several years would be required 
to determine exactly what items were in the French dumps and depots. As of 
12 August usu instructed that all requisitions from Indochina would be 
submitted directly to Air Force headquarters for validation and that, for 
the time being, only requisitions for supplies needed to alleviate suf-
fering, prevent disease, and assist in the evacuation from Tonkin would be 
approved. (179) 
Most of the Far East Air Forces logistical support detachments were 
phasing out before the Geneva agreement, and the remainder were quickly 
terminated after 21 July. In August USAF directed FEAF to remove its 
loaned B-26s and C-119s from Indochina as soon as possible. The last of 
the 24 B-26s on loan to the French (one had been damaged beyond repair) 
arrived at Clark Air Base on 4 September, where the planes were inspected 
and repaired and then returned to the Fifth Air Force in Japan. The last 
of the 0-119 aircraft on loan to the French returned to Clark on 6 September, 
and the members of the "Cat Pawn detachment returned to their normal duty 
stations on the same day. With the removal of the FEAF personnel, USAF had 
completed its emergency support for the French and awaited the completion of 
any new military assistance policies that might originate in Washington. (180)

CHAPTER 2 
? SOUTHEAST ASIAN REGIONAL AND 
? -COUNTRY DEFENSE PROGRAMS, 1954-1959 
1. Concepts of Regional and Country Programs  
In the wake of the Geneva Conference, President Eisenhower and Secre-
tary of State Dulles did not conceal their dislike for many of the features 
of the agreements terminating hostilities. President Eisenhower welcomed 
the,end of blooded, but he thought it unfortunate that French policies 
and operations had not been more successful. He believed that the American 
aid that had been given to the French Union Forces had been unable to cure 
a fundamentally "unsound relationship between the Asiatics and the French 
. . . and therefore was of only limited value."(1) In a news conference, 
Secretary Dulles stated that the Geneva negotiations reflected the military 
developments in Indochina, where France had lost nearly half of Vietnam and 
the French people did not desire to prolong the war.(2) 
After Geneva the national policy of the Eisenhower Administration toward 
Southeast Asia pledged that the United States, in accordance with the United 
Nations Charter, Would not seek by force to overthrow the Geneva settlement. 
The United States remained firm in its dedication to the principles of self-
determination of peoples and its hope that the Geneva agreements would permit 
Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam to be fully sovereign and independent nations. 
Toward this end, President Eisenhower intended to maintain the US embassy to 
Vietnam in Saigon, and he requested the governments of Cambodia and Laos to 
accept the appointment of an ambassador or minister to be resident in their 
respective capitals. As A major element of policy, President Eisenhower 
indicated his hope that ".concert of Nations" would rally to the defense of 
free people in Southeast Asia. Secretary Dulles spoke of the requirement 
for developing collective defense in advance of aggression, not after it was 
underway. "In this connection," he added, "we should bear in mind that the 
problem is not merely one of deterring open armed aggression but of preventing 
Communist subversion which, taking advantage of economic dislocations and 
social injustice, might weaken and finally overthrow the non-Communist 
governments."(3) 
In conversations both before and during the Geneva negotiations, Secre-
tary Dulles wanted a formal Southeast Asian collective defense organization, 
whereas the British and Asian neutralist nations including India wanted a 
loose, mainly economic, organization. A middle ground was found at the 
eight-nation conference held in Manila in September 1954 and in the Southeast 
Asia collective defense treaty signed by the United States, Great Britain, 
France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines on 
8 September 1954. These nations agreed that armed aggression from the out-
side against any of the signatories would be regarded as a common danger and

met as such, the United States adding that the external aggression must be 
Communist. Under the Geneva agreement, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam were 
unable to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), but a 
protocol to the treaty extended the provisions of the articles providing 
for economic and technical assistance and for action against aggression to 
Cambodia, Laos, and the "free territory under the jurisdiction of the State 
of Vietnam." (14) 
On the part of the United States, the Southeast Asia collective defense 
treaty represented a broadening of the bilateral mutual defense treaties 
already existing with all of the signatories except Thailand. The Thai 
Government, gravely concerned about Communist activities in Laos and else-
where on Thailand's borders, would be a strong supporter of SEATO, but in 
1954 it would have preferred a bilateral defense pact with the United States 
that would have a definite commitment of US forces to the defense of Thailand. 
Thus US Ambassador William J. Donovan indicated that Thailand would be recep-
tive to US development of a jet airfield at Korat and the deployment of an 
F-814 tactical fighter wing there. As will be seen, the United States was 
actively undertaking to buildup Thai military forces and the Thai military 
infrastructure, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff were opposed to any commitment 
of US forces to a static defense of Southeast Asia, a view which was both 
shared and promoted by US Air Force leaders. In Senate hearings on the 
Southeast Asia treaty, Secretary Dulles pointed out that the United States 
had defensive commitments to Japan, Korea, and Nationalist China and would 
be compelled.to utilize mobile forces in support of its Pacific treaty com-
mitments. 1,Jhile the Joint Chiefs remained unwilling to express definite US 
force commitments to SEATO, they noted in 1956 that CINCPAC would inform 
the SEATO military advisors in broad terms of the status of US forces avail-
able in the Western Pacific, thus reassuring the SEATO nations of US support 
without definitely committing forces to SEAT0.(5) 
Within the week following the effectuation of the Southeast Asia Col-
lective Defense Treaty on 19 February 1955, the foreign secretaries of the 
SEATO nations, who would also comprise the SEATO Council, met in Bangkok 
to establish a necessary working organization. Here it was agreed that the 
SEATO Council would be served by a permanent secretariat in Bangkok, and 
that each Council representative would have a military advisor as well as 
counsellors on economic affairs to assist him. The military advisor would 
be at Chief of Staff or Theater Cammander level, and, in the case of the 
United States, the CINCPAC would function in this capacity. The SEATO 
Council recognized that Communist subversion would be a major threat in 
Southeast Asia, but it believed that counter-subversive activities would be 
primarily the responsibility of the individual nation concerned. The 
Council therefore did not establish a permanent committee to supervise 
countersubversive activities but instead provided that technical advisors 
on the subject would meet as necessary to exchange information and discuss

common policies useful for countering subversion. In an early report 
issued on 5 May 1955, the SEATO Military Advisory Group's staff planners 
determined that Communist China threatened Southeast Asia both politi-
cally and militarily, but that, of the two threats, the political threat 
of subversive activities was most immediate. This assessment coincided 
with the USAF strategic estimate for the period 1960-1965 which judged 
that aggression against friendly governments in Southeast Asia would 
most likely be conducted by indigenous dissidents, covertly supported by 
adjacent Communist nations.(6) 
On 1 October 1954 when President Eisenhower proposed to provide US 
assistance to Vietnam, he stated that the purpose of the offer was "to 
assist the Government of Viet-Nam in developing and maintaining a strong, 
viable state, capable of resisting subversion or aggression through mili-
tary means ?"(7) Later in the year, the Department of State announced 
that arrangements have been completed so that on 1 January 1955 the 
United States could begin supplying financial aid directly to the govern-
ments of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos "for the purpose of strengthening 
their defense against the threat of Communist subversion and aggression."(8) 
Even though American policy statements continued to stress the purpose 
of military aid as being to develop defenses against ComMunist subversion 
and aggression, air staff officers at Far East Air Forces noted in January 
1955 that the Southeast Asian nations were building "balanced" three-arm 
military services for the sake of "show." Prepared under the direction of 
Colonel Grover Brown, a FTAY Intelligence staff study particularly concerned 
with MLAP requirements in Thailand was soon expanded into a follow-on 
Southeast Asia study. Both studies believed that the major danger to free 
Southeast Asia nations was from subversive groups with covert external Com-
munist support. The studies recommended that Thailand and the other South-
east Asia nations should build forces and techniques for countering local 
subversion. Drawing upon British experience in combating guerrillas in 
Malaya, the studies noted that one of the principal objectives of military 
forces should be to maintain and strengthen a population's faith in the 
anti-Communist government. The Communist guerrilla would not attempt static 
defensive warfare, and an anti-guerrilla military plan would have need of the 
flexibility and rapidity of movement inherent in suitably-selected aircraft. 
The study of Thai requirements noted: "The use of light infantry units, 
capable of rapid movement by air, in undertaking forceful military actions 
in conjunction with air operations would demonstrate strength and deter-
mination on the part of the government forces. These ground forces should 
be used to launch bold strikes against guerrilla forces, camp sites, supply 
routes, and supply areas." Before guerrilla hostilities began, each nation 
would need to develop an adequate intelligence system, adequate air and air-
ground communications facilities, and a strong air-ground training program. 
The study of Thailand was passed on to the Royal Thai Air Force, and the 
larger study on Southeast Asia was dispatched to the Pacific Air Force for 
such use as it could make of its thinking in CINCPAC mutual. defense 
assistance planning. (9)

The concept of building Southeast Asia indigenous defense forces for 
an especial role of combatting internal Communist subversion was congruous 
with an Air Force concept that the Southeast Asia nations would never be 
able to develop the forces required to resist an overt Red Chinese attack 
and that such an eventuality would necessitate the employment of US mobile 
forces under SEATO. On the basis of what he had seen in Vietnam, General 
Otto P. Weyland had returned to the United States in March 1954 with a 
conviction that the USAF would have to develop within the Tactical Air 
Command a ready air task force which could be rapidly deployed to meet 
local Communist aggression. During 1955, General Weyland secured Air 
Force acceptance of the principle of a Composite Air Strike Force (CAF). 
(10) The United States, moreover, planned to move mobile forces already 
in the Western Pacific to implement SEATO defenses. In an obvious com-
bination of the FEAF proposals with the concept of defending Southeast 
Asia with mobile forces, General Nathan F. Twining, USAF Chief of Staff, 
approved an Air Force Council policy statement on 5 May 1955 regarding 
MDAP, which read: "National air forces must be developed in such a man-
ner that they can cope with indirect aggression and be able to defend 
themselves, to a limited degree, against avert aggression by other nations. 
At the same time these coalition nations must be encouraged to develop 
base complexes which can be used by USAF forces, when and if required."(11) 
In the Deputate of Operation:3, Pacific Air Force, during September 
1955, Colonel Davison Dalziel directed the preparation of a very compre-
hensive staff study outlining Air Force recommendations as to MDAP 
objectives in Southeast Asia. Major General Sory Smith, Commander, Pacific 
Air Force, took the study to Admiral Stump with a recommendation that it 
be followed in CINCPAC planning. This study concluded that indigenous 
Southeast Asia national air forces could not be developed to meet a major 
external Communist air attack, an eventuality that would require American 
air forces. It noted that Taiwan and the Philippines could aid the Free 
World air effort by performing reconnaissance and local air defense mis-
sions, but, other than this, the Southeast Asia air forces could contribute 
most markedly to mutual air activities by developing abilities to combat 
internal subversion within their individual countries. Drawing upon 
experience of Malayan, Philippine, and Indochina guerrilla operations, the 
study called for immediate beginnings of (1) counter-guerrilla country-
intelligence systems; (2) rapid country cOmminications for intelligence 
reporting, air, and air-to-ground operations; (3) a strong air-ground 
training program; (4) an intense reconnaissance program both by aerial 
and air-lifted ground scouting teams; and (5) special psychological war-
fare programs in suspected areas, including the dispatch of psywar teams 
to such areas. (12) 
The Pacific Air Force study included an annex of operational concepts, 
which rather remarkably included nearly all the "lessons" of counter-
insurgency that would be relearned after 1961. These concepts visualized 
and recommended the development of indigenous counter-subversive forces, 
to include relatively slow-flying strike aircraft capable of carrying a 
diversified weapons load and of remaining in a target area for a long

period of time, as well as a colleCtion'of light transport aircraft and 
helicopters and photo and visual reconnaissance aircraft. The concept 
of effective counter-subversive activities included very close coopera-
tion of air operations with the operations of highly-mobile ground 
commando troops. It visualized and discussed the employment of air and 
commando troops in air-mobile; psychological warfare, interdiction, 
attrition, and resources denial missions.. It urged; "The cohtinual use 
of air sureillahce, air commando teams; and the build-up of a strong 
and locally organized militia Should gradually overcome communist military 
and psychological. warfare efforts." (13) 
During 1956 the Pacific Air Force continued to urge CINCPAC to work 
toward the development of counter-subversive military force capabilities 
in Southeast Asia. It submitted another formal study looking toward this 
objective on 2 March 1956.(14) Alter a visit to Southeast Asia as a mem-
ber of a CINOPAC survey team in October-November 1956, General Smith 
reported to Admiral Stump that he was still convinced of the validity of 
the concept of preparing Southeast Asia air forces to perform internal-
security- missions which he had recommended in September 1955.(15) Viewed 
in retrospect, the FTAF/PACAF concepts of preparing US and Southeast Asia 
air forces for the tasks that they were best able to perform was very sound. 
As far as policy went, the Joint Chiefs of Staff fiscal year 1957 mili-
tary assistance program guidance stated that the military aid program would 
reach its greatest significance in terms of its contribution to the attain-
ment of US :national objectives and in the support of joint war plans. (16) 
While efforts would be made to develop integrated force capabilities in 
Southeast Asia, the circumstances affecting US mutual assistance programs 
in each country were extremely varied, with the result that the whole MAP 
program was enormously complex both at. the individual country level and in 
its administration. 
2. Thailand as a Free World Ally  
In beginning the expanded US assistance program for the Indochina 
countries, the Mated States had already accumulated some related exper-
ience from its assistance td Thailand; and, with Thailand's adherence to 
SEATO, Thai assistance programs became ad integral part of the defense of 
Southeast Asia. American decisions to extend military assistance to 
Thailand, culminating in the formal agreement signed at Bangkok on 17 
October 1950, were not oblivious to the fact that Thailand, although 
nominally a constitutional monarchy since 1932, was ruled by a civilian-
military bureaucracy rather than by the mass Of the Thai people. (17) 
Thailand's rultarshad historically preserved Thai independence by fol-
lowing an opportunistic foreign policy. The Thai monarchs traded upon 
Anglo-French rivalries to preserves their hational independence during the 
age of European colonialism, and, is Japan appeared to gain influence in 
Asia, Phibun Songgram, head of the Thai military caste, seized control of 
the Thai government in 1938. After a few hours resistance to Japanese

invaders in December 1941, Phibun allied Thailand with Japan against the 
United States and Great Britain. Phibun's rival, Pridi Banomyong left the 
country and headed a Free Thai movement, which, with Japan's declining 
fortunes, recaptured the Thai government by constitutional means in July 
1944. On the defeat of Japan, Pridi was able to cite a record of assistance 
to the allies and to conclude an easy peace treaty. With US support, 
Thailand was admitted to the United Nations in December 1946. In another 
short and bloodless coup in November 1947, Phibun returned to power in 
Bangkok, and Pridi fled to Communist China to head a . -Communist inclined 
"Free Thai" movement. At the outset of the 1947 coup, the Thai military 
remained discretely in the background; but in April 1948 the army moved in 
and openly took over the government, installing Phibun as premier. As a 
rice-surplus area, Thailand's principally agricultural population was well-
fed and fairly prosperous, but Thailand knew a Communist threat from Pridi's 
regime, from some 50,000 Vietnamese who lived on the northeast frontier 
(many of them refugees from the fighting in Tonkin), and from overseas 
Chinese in Bangkok.(18) 
At the outset of the US military assistance program, Brigadier General 
John T. Cole, US Army, was named Chief, US MAAG-Thailand, in Bangkok, and 
on 10 October 1950, the USAF section of the MAAG arrived in Thailand and 
established itself adjacent to the Headquarters, Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF), 
at Don-Muang Airfield, a few miles from Bangkok.(19) At the-arrival of the 
American aid team, the RTAF possessed a record of tradition that went back 
to 1911 when the Ministry of War had sent three officers to France to study 
aviation. In December 1941, Thai airmen had attempted to resist the 
Japanese, but their aircraft had been easily destroyed by Japanese Zero 
fighters. Thereafter, during this conflict, Thai airmen had built-up a 
good record of cooperation the US Office of 3-pecial Services and the 
British Force 136 in recovering and returning Allied aircrews downed in 
Thailand.(20) In 1950 the Thai Air Force was organized at the top on a 
grandiose scale as the equal of the Army and Navy while its tactical strength 
consisted of three fighter and one transport groups. Except for the pur-
chase of American T-6 and De Havilland Chipmunk training planes, the RTAF 
was equipped with a variety of old American, Japanese, and British planes. 
The Royal Thai Naval Air Force possessed one operational patrol squadron 
and three training squadrons. The Naval Air Force employed old Japanese 
seaplanes and had a few American L-4 and T-6 aircraft for training. In 
1950 Thailand had on order 20 T-i6s, 18 Chipmunk trainers, 18 Spitfire IX 
fighters, and 2 Grumman amphibians. While the Thais had long emphasized 
flight training, the strength of the combined air force and naval air arm 
was approximately equivalent to one USAF group. (21) The RTAF was capable 
of supporting the army against internal dissidents, but it had virtually no 
offensive or defensive capability against a strong or determined enemy. (22) 
In January 1951 the first shipments of American military assistance for 
the Thai Army reached Bangkok, and in April the RTAF received a shipment of 
30 T-6F training planes under MLAP. During 1950, the USAF also programmed

86 F-8F fighters for ultimate delivery from US Navy stocks to the RTAF.(23) 
Apparently-because of Thai Army-Navy rivalry rather than any ideological 
motivation, Thai naval officers attenpted a coup on 29 June 1951 during 
ceremonies incident to the delivery of the US ECA dredge '11Manhattanfl at 
Bangkok. Navy conspirators seized Premier Phibun at gunpoint and carried 
him away to the Navy's flagship. In the following 48-hours, Marshal Sarit 
Thanarat of the Thai Army, General Phao Sriyanon of the Thai police, and 
Air Chief Marshal Fuen Ronnapakas Riddhagni of the Thai Air Force rallied 
to the support of Phibun. Thai airmen sank the naval flagship, allowing 
Phibun to escape. They also attacked rebel positions around Bangkok and 
effectively ended the rebellion. When rumors spread that Americans had 
done the air bombings, the Thai government issued a denial that any US 
equipment had been used and stated that the attacks had been as moderate 
as possible. The Royal Thai Navy was reorganized by decree on 12 
July, with the RTAF receiving control over the Navy Air Force and the 
Army taking responsibility for coastal defense. In the wake of the 
unsuccessful COUP, Air Marshal Riddhagni gained influence with the emergent 
rulingtriurrvirate of Phibun, Phao, and Sarit. kith the military support, 
Phibun staged his own coup in November 1951 when he abolished the existing 
bicameral Thai parliament and replaced it with a unicameral legislative 
body, half of whose members were appointed by the government, chiefly from 
high-ranking military officers. (21.) 
Thailand's government was anti-communist and authoritarian, but it was 
also paternalistic and sensitive to external criticism, especially to - 
frequent Red Chinese charges that Thailand was an American stooge. The Thai 
Army, Air Force, and Navy sought to obtain as much American aid as they: 
could with as few strings as possible. Under American aid allocations, the 
Thai Army received by far the largest amount of assistance, but the RTAF 
received an initial 50 F-8F fighters together with a US Navy training detach-
ment on 6 September 1951. The remaining 36 F-8Fs reached Thailand in October 
1952. The RTAF used the F-8F Spitfire ICs, and some armed T-6s to equip 
five fighter squadrons. According to Admiral Radford, Thai pilots were good 
flyers and had little difficulty with more modern planes. With MAAG assistance 
the RTAF progressed from a "flying club" to an incipient air force, but its 
capabilities were still very limited. A lack of radar and very limited com-
mercial electrical communications made it bluntly true that Thailand had no 
air defense capabilities. In an effort to develop air facilities, Air 
Marshal Riddhagni was willing to overspend the RTAF's yearly-budget to improve 
facilities, but Thailand nevertheless continued to have a Hone-airfield air 
force." Only Don Mang Airfield possessed hard-surface runways and neces-
sary fuel storage.(25) 
The Vietminh invasion of Laos and movement toward Luang Prabang in 
April 1953 was greatly alarming to Bangkok since Thailand's borders were 
directly-threatened. At the urgent request of Thai Ambassador Pote 
Sarasin, the 'United States made airlifted shipments of ammunition and

other items to Thailand.(26) The Thais also placed an expedited request 
for 27 F8F aircraft to equip another fighter-bomber squadron and wanted 
more C-47 aircraft. USAF committed the 27 F8Fs to Thailand, but 15 of 
them had to be diverted to the French in Indochina and only 12 of the 
planes were delivered to Bangkok in December 1953. The C-47s were also 
badly needed in Indochina, but three of these planes were granted to 
Thailand and the RTAF purchased four others on the commercial market, 
bringing its inventory of C-47s up. to 11 aircraft.(27) In an effort to 
ascertain the exact state of affairs in Thailand, the United States sent 
a joint military mission there in September 1953. The mission was headed 
by Major General William N. Gillmore, who returned to Bangkok to head the 
expanded Joint US Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG) established as a 
result of the mission's recommendations.(28) 
In the spring of 1954, Thailand grew even more apprehensive about 
Vietminh successes in Indochina and on 29 May requested the United Nations 
Security Council to send a peace observation mission to prevent the Com-
munists from overthrowing the governments of Laos and Cambodia, only to 
have the Soviets block action on the request.(29) In this same season, 
the US Army survey visit to Southeast Asia led by General Gavin called 
attention to the strategic importance of Thailand and recommended US 
assistance for the construction of an all-weather highway from central 
Thailand through Korat toward the northeastern frontier with Laos.(30) 
As already noted, Ambassador Donovan recommended that the United States 
build airfields in Thailand and deploy USAF units there. Early in July 
1954, a joint Thai military mission headed by General Srisdi Dhanarajata, 
Deputy Defense Minister, arrived in Washington with substantial requests 
for military assistance that went well beyond anything previously planned. (31) 
Although the Joint Chiefs 7-)f staff recogni:ed the importance of Thailand, 
they were on record in opposition:to expanding Thai assistance at the expense 
of other international aid requirements. The Air Force was opposed to a 
static defense of Southeast Asia that would result in stationing USAF units 
there.(32) At Department of Defense level, however, the Thai military mis-
sion received better results. On 12 July the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
personally handed General Srisdi a letter pledging $25 million in US aid 
additional to military assistance that would be normally programmed. 
Another grant of $3 million was promised to begin the construction of a 
strategic northeast highway from Saraburi through Korat toward Udorn.(33) 
In the revalidation of Title III military assistance programs following 
the Geneva agreements, the United States agreed to provide Thailand 
(including aircraft already delivered) with a total of 169 F8F fighter-
bombers, 3 c-47s, 30 T-6F basic trainers, 6 T-33A jet trainers, and 31 
F-84G jet fighter bombers. The program also included a 45-day war reserve 
of ammunition.(34) This program would be supported by deviations from 
other mutual country programs: most of the ammunition stock would be 
diverted from Indochina and, in the spring of 1955, 20 F8Fs were released

the fiscal 1950-55 MDAP continued in 1955, the RTAF would be additionally 
authorized three RT-33A jet reconnaissance aircraft.(35) 
The Department of Defense decision to allocate $25 million of addi-
tional military assistance and the programming of the RTAF for jet air-
craft were obviously intended to permit Thailand to go beyond its own 
defense and to add to the collective security of the SEATO area.(36) At 
the outset, this intention was not completely understood by American 
officials in the Far East-Pacific area. Within the Thai government the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force agreed to divide the $25 million on a $17:$345 
ratio, and the Air Chief Marshal Riddhagni intended to spend most of the 
$5million to be received by the RTAF to develop Don Mang, Takhli, and 
Korat airfields for jet air operations.(37) General Gillmore, however, 
over-ruled the Thai recommendations on 22 September and proposed to 
emphasize Army development by allocating $18.1 million to the Army, $3.6 
to the Navy, and $2.4 to the Air Force. At the Pacific Command, Admiral 
:tumn indorsed Gillmore's propo,:ed allocation but recommended that con-
Linued cognizance be given to urgent requirements for the improvement of 
Thai airfields and of the naval base at Sattahip. In Washington, the Navy 
and the Air Force non-concurred with General Gillmore's proposals, the Air 
Force position being that the principal impediment to the Thailand assistance 
program was a lack of an adequate communications system and airfield complex. 
In December the Joint Chiefs accepted an ad hoc study committee recommenda-
tion that $7 million be allocated for construction and that material alloca-
tions be divided $10 million for the Army, $2.3 for the Navy, and $5.7 for 
the Air Force. Counting its share of the construction fund and its material 
allocation, the RTAF was authorized $6.2 million instead of the $2.4 million 
recommended by General Gillmore.(38) 
In a briefing on 14 October 1954 L'epresentative.3 of the office of Secre-
tary of Defense and the three military services explained their requirements 
in Thailand to newly-appointed US Ambassador John E. Peurifoy, who was then 
on his way to Bangkok. The Air Force briefing stressed a requirement for the 
development of communications and air facilities in Thailand.(39) With the 
allocation of a larger share of the $25 million extra defense assistance plus 
some additional economic aid money -- the entire US fiscal year 1955 funding 
finally amounting to $9.1 million for airfield work and $2.2 million for FCC 
storage -- Air Marshal Riddhagni laid out a program at Takhli, Korat, Koke 
Kathiem, and Phitsanulok and for some additional fuel storage at Don Muang. 
(40) The program turned out to be based upon optimistic cost estimates: even 
when cheaper hard surfacing was used for airfield surfaces instead of the 
originally-planned pierced steel plank, the program had to be cut back to 
10,000-foot cement concrete runways at Takhli and Korat and a shorter asphalt 
airstrip at Koke Kathiem.(41) According to its planning, the RTAF intended 
to station F-84 aircraft at Don Muang, Takhli, Korat, and Koke Kathiem. The 
improvements funded by the United States in 1954-55 would give Thailand the 
beginning of a strategically located base system, but the movement of aviation 
fuel to the up-country bases would continue to be very difficult since 
Thailand lacked pipelines, POL tank car capacity, and even an all-weather road 
net.(42)

In justifying American mutual security assistance for Thailand, 
Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter S. Robertson 
described the Thai government as "one of the strongest anti-Communist 
governments in all Asia." He viewed the threat to Thailand as being 
from Pridi's "Free Thai" movement based in Communist China and from 
Chinese terrorists in Bangkok. (1.43) In 1954-55, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
approved the combat force level for the RTAF at six fighter-bomber squadrons 
and one transport squadron with one of the fighter-bomber squadrons slated 
for modernization with F-84.G aircraft.(44) The decision to allocate jet 
fighters to the RTAF was a useful method of encouraging Thailand to develop 
jet air facilities that would be available to SEATO forces in an emergency, 
but it was contrary to the already-noted FEAF and PACAF concepts that 
Southeast Asia forces ought to be developed to combat internal subversion. 
In the Far East, American officials were somewhat less optimistic about 
Thailand than was the expressed view of the US State Department. In a visit 
to Thailand late in 1955 a PACAF inspection team commented: "The Thai govern-
ment, RTAF and people were friendly and definitely pro-US; however, their 
attitude seemed, generally, to be that if a requirement existed, the US would 
do it and pay for it. . . . The possibility of utilizing the RTAF effectively 
in a war mission appeared marginal. because of inadequate planning, stemming 
from the unwillingness of the Thais to recognize that they might have to 
fight with their air force -- it seamed impossible to convince them that they 
might have to 'fight in anger."(45) During the SEATO amphibious-airlift 
"Firm Link" maneuvers at Bangkok in February 1956, the RTAF refused to permit 
a static display of rubber-treaded tanks at Don Mnang, leading American 
observers to believe that the RTAF was wary lest the presence of tanks on the 
airfield would give General phaots national police an unfortunate balance of 
power that could lead to a coup. 'till in poor repute, the Thai Navy was the 
only service not represented in the parades that accompanied the "Firm Link" 
demonstrations.(46) There were alb() reports that the Thai Army was opposed 
to General Phaofs creation of a voluntary police defense corps which would be 
useful against subversive activities. The Thai Army also mistrusted US MAAG 
support for the voluntary defense corps, whose 40-man companies were being 
provided American financed uniforms and arms. (Li?) As a further complication 
to the American aid program, a very senior RTAF officer was quoted as saying 
that the Thai desire for jet aircraft was based primarily on political and 
prestige factors -- that the jets were desired only for show purposes: After 
visiting Thailand in November 1956, General Sory Smith wrote: "The Thais are 
definitely pro-US, yet at the same time there is a feeling that the Thai 
governmental leaders would not be inclined to fight a last-ditch stand against 
the Oommunists."(48) 
In making its post-fiscal year 1955 policy for mutual security assistance 
to Thailand, the US National Security Council stated the position that no 
more than one jet fighter squadron would be provided to the RTAF. At PACAF, 
General Smith considered this policy valid, especially after the RTAF official 
stated that Thailand wanted jets for prestige. ()9) In making recommendations

for continuing US assistance to the RTAF in March 1956, PACAF had accepted 
the earlier Washington decision that the RTAF would get F-84 jets as "a 
case of accepting reality" and without much enthusiasm. Given the fact 
that the Thais would get jet fighters, PACAF had recommended that the 
United States should build an aircraft control and warning system in Thai-
land and convert the RTAF to F-86F jets, which could be egployed either 
as fighter-interceptors or fighter-bombers. PACAF also recommended that 
RTAF force goals should include two transport squadrons, a helicopter 
squadron, and one-half of a RT-33 tactical reconnaissance squadron. (So) 
This force composition would give Thailand an indigenous air defense capa-
bility and increase its counter-subversive potential. The NSC policy 
limiting jets for Thailand gave PACAF an opportunity to emphasize a buildup 
of conventional air capabilities for the RTAF, but it posed a problem in 
that the F8F5 in Thailand and Vietnam were being supported by cannibalizing 
other F8Fs in the United States to get spare parts (Project "Swing Back") 
and spares support for F8Fs would be very difficult after fiscal year 1958. 
(Si) And, as General Smith pointed out, a policy of restricting the pro-
visioning of jets to the RTAF would make it rather more difficult to secure 
the development of airfields and an air control system in Thailand that 
would be needed as a base for SEATO operations. (52) 
In recognition of the NBC policy, the tactical situation, and the supply 
factors, the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1956 established the MAP-supported 
force basis of the RTAF at three squadrons of fighter bombers (2 F8F and 1 
F-84G), two squadrons of C-47 transports, and one composite reconnaissance 
squadron (3 RT-33s, 8 H-19 helicopters, and 7 T-6s).(53) Under this force 
posture, the US MAP completed the delivery of 31 F-84Gs to Thailand by mid-
1957, as well as two H-19A helicopters and five additional C-47s. In 
response to a request made by Chief Marshal Riddhagni in 1955 for 
primary training planes to replace his aging and unsupportable Chipmunks, 
the United States also delivered 75 T-6G aircraft during 1957.(54) In 
fiscal years 1959 and 1960 the United States would deliver no additional air-
craft to Thailand, and on 23 November 1957 Major General Richard C. Partridge, 
Chief US MUSMAG-Thailand, told Congressional investigators the flow of US 
military to Thailand was very slow. Partridge said: "Every program we put 
in is a mixture of stuff that has been on the program for the previous year 
and what we feel is necessary for the future. . . . Many, many things that 
are programmed do not get delivered here. . . . We make a new program each 
year, but the request is based on what we have not gotten before." (55) 
Even though the Thai ruling oligarchy of Phibun, Sarit, and Phao was 
considered to be anti-Communistic and pro-American, the struggles between 
the three men weakened the viability of the Thai government, leaving some 
doubt as to Thailand's value as a SEATO ally and no doubt at all that the 
Thai government could not affect internal policies without elaborate 
negotiation. During 1957 the Thai Army became increasingly resentful of 
corruption under Phaots police and fearful that Phibun might be growing 
soft in opposition to internal and external Communism. In a bloodless coup

on 16 September 1957, the Thai Army overthrew the Phibun government. 
Phibun fled to Cambodia, and Phao was allowed to leave the country 
several days later. 'Without delay, the police forces were reorganized 
and deprived of artillery and tanks. Although Marshal Sarit Thanarat 
emerged as the single strong man in Thailand, he was suffering from 
illness that would require extended treatment in the United States. 
The revolutionary party installed Pote Sarasin as head of a provisional 
cabinet which held office until a national election was held on 15 
December 1957. After this election Pote Sarasin resigned to fill the 
position of Secretary-General of SEATO and Lt General Thanom Kittikhachorn 
was, installed as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, while Field 
Marshal Sarit continued for the time as CINC of the Thai Army. After the 
coup, Air Chief Marshall Chalermkiat Watanangura emerged as CINC BTAF.(56) 
The Sarit coup of September 1957 established a government in Thailand 
that was more authoritarian but nevertheless more popular than the trium-
virate that it replaced. Thailand continued to be staunchly aligned with 
SEATO, fearful of Communist aggression in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, 
and heavily dependent upon American assistance. As 1957 ended, Thailand 
had an army of 95,000 men, composed of units which by US standards were 
about 60 percent effective. The navy had 90 ships (the largest was of 
the frigate class) and 18,560 men. The Thai Air Force had 24,498 per-
sonnel and 398 aircraft, organized into six fighter-bomber squadrons, two 
transport squadrons (one C-47 and one helicopter squadron), and a flying 
training school. None of the air units were combat ready by US standards, 
but there were sufficient trained pilots and operational aircraft to give 
an overall effectiveness of about 50 percent. The RTAF was training 
conscious, but its technical training programs were not very effective.(57) 
As this initial phase of US assistance to Thailand was ending, CINCPAC and 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff had recognized that in order for the RTAF to be 
effective it would have to be provided an aircraft control and warning 
radar system and additional jet aircraft, the latter because suitable con-
ventional fighters were unavailable to keep the F8Fs in operation.(58) 
3. American Assistance for the Republic of Vietnam 
In winning his war against France, Ho Chi Minh had built a Communist 
elite and the Vietminh army, which served as a basis for establishing and 
controlling the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Throughout history, 
emerging nations had usually developed leadership through revolutionary 
struggle and this would be the case in North Vietnam, even though Ho Chi 
Minh would reveal himself as a Communist "Benedict Arnold" who stole the 
revolutionary gains from the Vietnamese people and established a totali-
tarian regime based upon military force and Red terror.(59) Hard intel-
ligence of Communist activities in North Vietnam was difficult to obtain 
for several years, but American officers in South Vietnam knew that Ho Chi 
Minh was freely violating the Geneva agreements and building the North 
Vietnamese Army to new high levels with strong Chinese Communist support. 
By June 1956 the effective strength of the Vietminh had approximately

doubled, and its artillery firepower was reported to have increased by a 
factor of six. A year later, Ho Chi Minh possessed some 350,000 to 
400,000 troops in at least 20 divisions that were trained, equipped, and 
supported by Red China. According to the Chief, US MAAG Vietnam, Ho's 
army "could have walked through Vietnam to Saigon standing up" in 1956. 
In 1957 American intelligence reported that North Vietnam's economic 
conditions were bad, but, militarily, North Vietnam was "given the capa-
bility of overrunning South Vietnam within thirty days, provided no help 
were furnished to the south."(60) 
In the Republic of Vietnam south of the 17th parallel the French had 
permitted very little Vietnamese leadership to develop either at the 
political or military level, and, in President Eisenhower's opinion, the 
"lack of leadership and drive on the part of Chief of State Bao Lai was 
a factor in the feeling prevalent among Vietnamese that they had nothing 
to fight for."(61) Bao Dai left Vietnam for Europe prior to the Geneva 
Conference and did not return. The affairs of state in the Republic of 
Vietnam thus developed upon Ngo Dinh Diem, who was designated to succeed 
Prince Buu Loc as head of the cabinet in Saigon on 18 June 1954 and was 
formally invested as president of the council of ministers on 7 July. A 
scion of a mandarin family in Hue, Diem was a Vietnamese Catholic 
nationalist who had long been absent in France and the United States. At 
the outset of his tenure of office, Diem was counted to be honest but 
politically naive, as well as aloof, Obstinate, and suspicious. (62) 
In the aftermath of Geneva the Ngo Dinh Diem government not only 
looked northward toward Hanoi but also to the chaotic conditions south 
of the 17th parallel. Despite many demands, France had never given Bao 
Dai real authority over Vietnam's domestic institutions -- including the 
police and armed forces -- and the transfer of French control over the 
police, justice, security, public utilities, civil aviation, and army 
would be a lengthy and frequently bitter process. Contrary to the Geneva 
accords, the Vietminh left behind approximately 10,000 cadremen for a new 
Vietcong resistance movement when they evacuated the south in the autumn 
of 1954. With an obvious eye on the national elections prescribed to 
take place before July 1956, the Vietcong abandoned military operations 
temporarily in favor of political disruption.(63) In addition to the 
Vietminh, South Vietnam's incipient national unity wasfractured by three 
major sectarian organizations, which the French .had often subsidized for 
politico-military purposes. Centered in Tay Ninh province northwest of 
Saigon, the Cao Dai was a religious movement with an estimated 1,500,000 
adherents, an armed force of about 10,000 equipped troops, and about 
20,000 partly trained reserves. The Hoa Hao sect lacked unified leadership 
and was scattered at villages on the Ca Mau peninsula and in the Mekong 
Delta; the sect numbered about 500,000 members, 8,000 active military forces, 
and an unarmed reserve of about 7,000 men. Unlike the religious sects, the 
Binh Xuyen was an armed group of about 2,600 disciplined men who controlled 
gambling and vice around Saigon. Through intimidation of the French, the

Binh Xuyen had taken control of the local National Security Police and the 
Saigon-Cholon municipal police early in 1954.(64) The situation confront-
ing South Vietnam in the summer of 1954 appeared almost hopeless: thus a 
Far East Air Forces intelligence estimate starkly concluded: "Indochina 
is considered lost to the Communist bloc, and complete consolidation of 
their control is only a matter of time." (6S) 
During the eight years of the Indochina War, the French had built up 
their French forces to about 170,000 men by July 1954, and, chiefly during 
the few years prior to Geneva, the French had recruited a Vietnamese army 
of some 250,000 men, the exact nutbers being uncertain since desertions 
were heavy in mid-1954. Together with suppletivs who manned anall guard 
posts, as many as 4c0,000 South Vietnamese were under arms in July 1954. 
As organized in 1953, the Vietnamese army was nominally headed by a Chief 
of Staff, General Nguyen Van Hinh, an officer who had flown with the 
French Air Force in World War II and who held French citizenship. Under 
the French colonial system, French officers and non-commissioned officers 
normally commanded and were integrated in Vietnamese combat and logistical 
units. Vietnamese very seldom got above the rank of major in their own 
army, and in 1954 most Vietnamese officers were young, recent graduates of 
the Dalat military academy or an Officer candidate school. The Vietnamese 
army had almost no staff, artillery, armor, or engineering sections and 
no communications capability. (66) 
With a ceasefire imminent in mid-June 1954, Prime Minister 3uu loc 
requested formally that the United States assume responsibility for training 
the Vietnamese army vice the French, a proposition to which General Ely 
tacitly agreed. In Saigon, French and American officers worked out the 
details of a US training orogram, but in Washington on 4 August the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff were knowledgeable about the precarious state of political 
affairs in Saigon (in particular the fact that General Hinh was plotting 
to overthrow Diem) and recommended that the United States not assume a 
training mission in South Vietnam prior to establit:ment of political 
stability there. During SepteMber the Joint Chiefs reiterated this position 
on several occasions. On 24 SepteMoer, they stated that forces on the order 
of five divisions would be approoriate for Vietnam, that effective forces 
of this size could not be produced within a two-three year period, and they 
recommended that implementation of such a program be accomplished at low 
priority and not be permitted to Impair the development through MLAP of 
effective and reliable forces elsewhere. (67) From a military point of 
view, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended against increased involvement 
in support of the South Vietnamese army, but there were political reasons 
on the other side. Occupying ar advisory capacity in Saigon, Air Force 
Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, who had earlier advised the Philippine govern-
ment in successful anti-Communist campaigns, foresaw that the Vietnamese 
army was the only national organization that possessed any of the 
administrative abilities, executive skills, discipline, and strength to 
carry out actions directed by Diem's government in Saigon. (68)

In the progressive development of US policy, political considerations 
took precedence. On 17 August, President Eisenhower directed that American 
aid to Indochina would be rechannelled directly to the Associated States 
rather than through France. (69) Franco-American talks in Washington on 
27-29 September reached an agreement that France, with US monetary assistance, 
would retain expeditionary forces in Indochina pending the development of 
national forces for security purposes and that both the United States and 
France would continue to assist Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam in their efforts 
to safeguard their freedom and independence and advance the welfare of their 
peoples.(70) In a letter to Ngo Dinh Diem on 1 October, President 
Eisenhower said that he was instructing Ambassador Heath to examine with 
Diem ways in which American aid could assist "in developing and maintaining 
a strong, viable state, capable of resisting attempted subversion or aggres-
sion through military means." In return for aid, the US Government expected 
the Vietnamese government to undertake needed reforms responsive to the 
nationalist aspirations of the Vietnamese people.(71) On 11 October 
Secretary Dulles asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to re-examine their stand 
on US responsibility for training the Vietnamese army. While the Joint 
Chiefs did not substantially change their earlier position, a National 
Security Council meeting on 22 October engendered a Presidential directive 
to Ambassador Heath and General OlDaniel instructing them to strengthen 
the government of South Vietnam by insuring the loyalty of the South 
Vietnamese armed forces and by increasing their effectiveness. On 28 
October the Joint Chiefs were requested to develop a long-range program 
to produce the minimum South Vietnamese forces capable of insuring internal 
security. (72) In order to make a military evaluation of the situation and 
to dramatize the fact that the United States was interested in Vietnam, 
President Eisenhower designated General J. Lawton Collins on 3 November as 
Special US Representative ih Vietnam with personal rank as ambassador and 
authority to coordinate the operations of all American agencies in the 
country. One of Collins' principal tasks was to insure that there was a 
single Vietnamese army, loyal to President Diem; another was to make 
decisions on a crash program of assistance and to develop ground work for 
a long-range assistance program. (73) General Collins arrived in Saigon on 
8 November, and in this month the bitter struggle in which General Hinh 
(with apparent backing of Bao Dai) had been fighting for control of the 
government was cleared up. In the struggle about 20 percent of the 
Vietnamese officers backed Hinh, a like number backed Diem, and the rest 
tried to stay neutral. In November Hinh went to France to "consult!' with 
Bao Dai and a little later he was relieved as Chief of Staff.(74) In the 
reorganization of the army, all personnel took a loyalty oath to the 
government, and Diem installed Lt General Le Van Ty as Chief of Armed 
Forces General Staff. General Ty was also Chief of Staff of the Vietnamese 
Army, and because of the dominant size of the army the Joint General Staff 
and the Army General Staff were essentially one and the same (75) 
Where the French had been thinking in terms of a large Vietnamese army 
of some 270,000 troops that would cost the United States upwards of WO 
million a year to maintain, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended a force

buildup of three divisions plus small supporting air and naval forces. 
This small army of up to 90,000 troops was to be organized into mobile 
battalions. On 7 December, General Collins was authorized to use these 
force figures as a basis for further discussions with French and 
Vietnamese authorities.(76) In negotiations with General Ely and directly 
with the Government of Vietnam after 1 January 1955 (when the Associated 
States terminated their union with France), General Collins matured a plan 
on 19 January whereby the Vietnamese army would be supported at a strength 
of 90,000 men and the US MAAG would assume "full responsibility for 
assisting the Government of Viet-Nam in the organization and training of 
its armed forces." Since 342 US officers and enlisted men had been in 
Vietnam at the time of the Geneva agreements, the new US MAAG Vietnam 
would be limited to this strength, which was insufficient for training 
purposes. General O'Daniel accordingly split this strength between the 
MAAG and a separate Training Relations and Instruction Mission (TRIM) 
which included French, American, and Vietnamese personnel. Given Presidential 
approval on 29 January, the United States assumed responsibility for Viet-
namese army training on 12 February 1955, at which time Diem gained command 
authority over the Vietnam army from the French. But, even though General 
O'Daniel received the top-level training responsibility, the TRIM arrangement 
perpetuated a dual French-American training system, and many senior advisors 
to Vietnamese army units continued to be French officers.(77) 
Having made the decision to support and strengthen the government of 
Ngo Dinh Diem and to hold South Vietnam, President Eisenhower looked to 
Diem to use his reorganized Armed Forces and companion social reforms to 
further increase the stability and unity of his government. (78) Basically, 
the United States wished to see the pacification of areas previously occu-
pied by the Vietminh; establishment of a Vietnamese national assembly; 
streamlining and utilization of the Vietnamese national army; proper resettle-
ment of evacuees from North Vietnam; a program of land reform; establishment 
of an independent, fiscally responsible national Vietnamese budget; and 
establishment of an independent currency and foreign exchange program for 
Vietnam.(79) On a trip to confer with President Eisenhower in late January 
1955, General Collins was privately concerned about the strength of the 
Binh Xuyen, the Hoa Hao, and the Cao Dai as well as a fear that good men 
would not or could not work under Diem. Publicly, however, Collins 
indicated on one occasion that Diem would have "at least a reasonable chance 
of success," and on another that Free Vietnam "would at least have 50 out 
of 100 chances of safeguarding its freedom and escaping the claws of com-
munism" if it applied the entire program recommended by the United States.(80) 
Late in '954, after Diem had insured the loyalty of the Vietnamese army, 
he issued a national security directive which placed all insecure provinces 
under military authority, with this military authority to be phased out as 
civilian administrators became available and capable. With advice from TRIM, 
Diem employed a brigade in a pacification operation against the Ca Mau 
peninsula between 8 February-12 March 1955. After studying the lessons of

the "Freedom Campaign" in the Ca Mau area, an approximately corps-sized 
force was employed to pacify Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces between 
19 April-1 June. Essentially, these operations were march-ins by army 
troops into areas from which Vietminh had been evacuated northward. The 
army forces rehabilitated public works, broke up armed bands, gave security 
to local inhabitants, and destroyed communist organizations and arms caches 
left behind.(81) At the same time that the pacification operations were 
underway, the Binh Xuyen politico-bandit group precipitated a revolt in 
Saigon on 29 March that spread as elements of the Cao Dai and Hoe. Hao sects 
joined against the government. The Vietnamese army effectively dealt with 
these revolts, the Binh Xuyen being driven from Saigon and crushed in a 
final campaign in the Rung Sat area southwest of Saigon in September and 
October 1955. In January 1956, Vietnamese army units occupied Tay Ninh, 
breaking the Cao Dai armed insurgency, and the capture of various Hoa Hao 
leaders terminated this sect's revolt by 13 April 1956. Although organized 
revolts were ended, many sect members remained dissident and would be 
useful to the Vietcong.(82) 
By May 1955, when a new American Ambassador, G. Frederick Reinhardt 
arrived in Saigon, US plans for South Vietnam were being modified by a 
changing situation. Even though the United States reimbursed France for 
the cost of maintaining its forces in Indochina, the French needed troops 
for employment in Algeria. Mbreover, Frenchmen were increasingly 
unpopular with Diem. Rather suddenly in the spring of 1955, Paris directed 
substantial troop withdrawals which would cut its forces in Indachina to 
approximately 60,000 men by June. Within the following year, the French Air 
Force in Indochina would be reduced to an F8F operational training unit, a 
C-47 squadron, an L-20 liaison squadron, and an H-19 helicopter squadron. (83) 
During a visit to Saigon at the end of February 1955, Secretary Dulles 
and Assistant Secretary of State Walter S. Robertson had found Ngo Dinh 
Diem "tense and gravely concerned," but the United States had not deviated 
from a policy of backing Diem, and by June a State Department spokesman 
noted that events in April and May "give us increased ground for optimism 
that the situation will gradually stabilize itself and that the Government 
of Ngo Dinh Diem will pull through." (8L) From Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh called 
for Diem to begin discussions looking toward a national plebiscite for 
national reunification. When asked about the possibility of such an 
election on 28 June, Secretary Dulles pointed out that neither the Govern-
ment of Vietnam nor the United States had signed the Geneva agreements. 
If national elections were really free, Dulles favored them as a means of 
restoring freedom and unity to Vietnam. (85) In an open letter to his 
countrymen on 16 July, Diem also favored free elctions, but he thought it 
"out of the question for us to consider any proposal from the Viet Minh 
if proof is not given that they put the superior interests of the National 
Community above those of communism, if they do not cease violting their 
obligations as they have done by preventing our countrymen of the North 
from going South or by recently attacking, together with the communist

Pathet Lao, the friendly state of Laos."(86) When the Vietminh made a 
third demand on 19 July for a pre-election conference, the Government of 
Vietnam announced on 9 August that such elections would be impossible as 
long as the Communist regime of North Vietnam refused democratic freedoms 
and basic fundamental rights to the people of North Vietnam. (87) 
In October 1955 Diem took his position on the Vietnamese plebiscite 
to his countrymen in an election. The South Vietnamese were satisfied with 
his stand and also voted to depose Bao Dai as Chief of State. Having been 
elected president, Diem proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam and took office 
on 26 October. On this same day, the United States undertook diplomatic 
relations with the State of Vietnam(88) Assistant Secretary Robertson 
explained that the United States intended: "To support a friendly non-
Communist government in Viet-Nam, and to help it diminish and eventually 
eradicate Communist subversion and influence. To help the Government of 
Viet-Nam establish the forces nece-L4ary for internal security. To encourage 
support for Free Viet-Nam by the non-Communist world. To aid in the reha-
bilitation and reconstruction of a country and people ravaged by 8 ruinous 
years of civil and international war."(89) 
In the light of developments in Vietnam, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
readdressed their policy on force level recommendations during the summer 
of 1955. In 1954 they had recommended a Vietnamese force that would be 
sufficient to maintain internal order, but now, in view of the reduction 
of French forces and Ngo Dinh Diem' e stand against an inevitably dishonest 
national plebiscite, there was a strong possibility that the Vietminh would 
use their superior forces in an invasion across the 17th parallel. To 
repulse such aggression the Joint Chiefs proposed to place reliance on 
Vietnamese ground forces, aided by US air and naval forces which would use 
atomic weapons as needed. On 17 August, the Joint Chiefs recommended that 
Vietnamese force levels be raised tO a ceiling of 150,000 personnel -- to 
include 4 field divisions, 6 light divisions, 13 territorial regiments, plus 
apprwd_mately 4,000 air, 4,000 navy, and 5,000 civilians and supporting 
forces.(90) At this time, new decisions had to be made to comprehend the 
Geneva limitation that only 342 US military personnel could be assigned in 
Vietnam. Even though the United States had assumed that military mobile 
training teams sent to Vietnam on temporary duty would not count against 
this total, the limit of 342 individuals caused US strength to be spread 
quite thinly, especially as the French were withdrawing their personnel. 
On 25 August, the International Control Commission for Vietnam further 
ruled that all TDY military personnel had to be included in the 342-man 
personnel ceiling. For several years the United States would be unable 
to secure any relief from the 342-man limit on the MAAG, which would super-
vise training in the 150,000-man Vietnamese armed forces, as well as a 
40,000-meMber Vietnamese Self-Defense Corps. Since more advisory effort 
would be needed the only possible contingency was to use US civilian 
teams where possible to supplement the military effort. Thus the Vietnam

Ministry of Interior and the US Operations Mission were given responsi-
bility for developing a 55,000-man Civil Guard, which was to be primarily 
responsible for dealing with insurgent groups inside South Vietnam. Under 
contracts with the US and South Vietnamese government, Michigan State 
University undertook to assist in training and equipping the Civil Guard 
and sought to make the guard a rural police force. (91) 
Before Lt General Samuel T. Williams left Washington for Saigon where 
he assumed the position as Chief, US MAAG on 15 NaveMber 1955, he was 
briefed to prepare for a North Vietnamese invasion across the 17th parallel 
which would likely occur sometime after July 1956. Before General Williams 
arrived, the US MAAG had begun to organize the Army of Vietnam (now 
abbreviated "ARVN" and pronounced as "Arvin") into four field divisions 
(each with 8,500 men), six light divisions (each with 5,000 men), and 13 
territorial regiments unassigned to divisions. It was soon obvious to 
Williams that these miscellaneousunits could not be effectively employed 
against a Vietminh assault and that the association in which both US and 
French advisors were working to train ARVN units was both unsatisfactory 
and unacceptable to President Diem. In each Vietnamese unit under the TRIM 
arrangement, if the senior officer was French the second senior was an 
American. Or if the senior was an American, the second senior was French. 
Williams noted that there was considerable backbiting by the French, and, 
at the request of Diem, he removed the French advisors from ARVN units. In 
Saigon, however, the French continued to work in association with the US 
MAAG unti1.26 April 1956, when Lt General Pierre-Edie Jacquot, the French 
CINC Indochina, closed his headquarters and departed for France.(92) This 
action did not affect the associated training of the Vietnamese Navy and 
Air Force, which, as will be seen, would continue for another year. 
In the early part of July 1956 -- the month of the possible Vietrdnh 
attack across the 17th parallel -- General Williams went to Hue and 
attempted to put together enough ARVN resources to defend the line of 
demarcation. If the attack had come, Williams did not believe that the 
ARVN was well enough organized, manned, and equipped to resist it. With-
out definite table of organization and equipment, moreover, it was difficult 
if not impossible to state definite manning and equipment requirements for 
the Vietnamese army units. At Williams' recommendation, the Government of 
Vietnam convened a board of experienced officers, who studied the jungle, 
swamp, and mountain warfare requirements expected to be faced in Vietnam 
and recommended by mid-1957 a divisional organization suited to ARVN's needs. 
In view of the lack of roads in Southeast Asia, the new division's TO&E 
specified a bare minimum of motor transport and provided for a hand-carrying 
force. (93) 
Coincident with the termination of the French command in Vietnam on 26 
April 1956, the US MAAG redesignated the Training Relations and Instruction 
Mission (TRIM) as the Combat Arms Training and Organization Division (CATO) 
of the MAAG. At this same time, approval was given for a 350-US man

(including 68 Air Force personnel) Temporary Equipment Recovery Mission 
(TERM) which was able to free MAAG personnel from the former laborious 
diversion to tasks of recovering a large amount of surplus mutual security 
equipment and supplies remaining from the Indochina war. General Williams 
was able to assign American advisors to ARVN units down to regimental and 
separate battalion levels. (9L) Under the 150,000-man US MAP, the ARVN 
would be reorganized by 30 June 1959 into seven standard ARVN infantry 
divisions, a minimum-strength airborne brigade, plus five territorial regi-
ments, the latter being standard infantry regiments not assigned to divisions. 
By 1958 General Williams considered that ARVN had progressed so markedly as 
to prevent the Vietminh from considering an orthodox military invasion. In 
the event of a full-scale Communist invasion across the 17th parallel, the 
ARVN was expected to be able to conduct an effective delaying action for up 
to 15 days before taking up a close-in defense of the Tourane. (Da Nang) 
base area, where it could possibly hold 30 days more. Outside military help 
would be required to continue the defense of South Vietnam, provide for a 
counter-offensive, or defend the Saigon-Mekong Delta area againat large 
enemy forces advancing through the,Mekong Valley. (95) 
In public addresses in 1957-58, President Eisenhower viewed the US 
military and economic assistance programs, together with the courageous 
response of the Vietnamese people under the dedicated leadership of 
President Diem, as being the means whereby Vietnam had been saved for 
freedom.(96) There were, nevertheless, criticisms of the military 
assistance stance in South Vietnam. After visiting Southeast Asia in 
November-December 1956, Clement Johnson, Chairman of the Board, US Chamber 
of Commerce, thought that the time was ripe for substantial reductions in 
troop and equipment levels in Vietnam and the other countries. In view of 
SEATO, Johnson felt that the forces were larger and more heavily equipped 
than necessary for internal security.(97) US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow, 
who arrived in Saigon on 20 March 1957, viewed the maintenance of a 
150,000-man regular military force level in Vietnam as a necessity but 
nevertheless emphasized that the cost of this force level made it very 
difficult for Vietnam to improve its domestic economy as fast as was 
desirable. In November 1957 Durbrow also pointed out that in the original 
defense plans for Vietnam it had been expected that Cambodia and Laos 
would be "basically with the West. . . and the main thought was to be sure 
the Communists didnIt cross that narrow 17th parallel." Since there was 
increasing Communist influence in Laos and Cambodia, President Diem saw 
new requirements to strengthen his defenses along the western frontier.(98) 
As reorganized for field campaigns, the Army of Vietnam had a capability of 
engaging and defeating large guerrilla bands, but this did not preclude 
small isolated attacks by small bandit and other dissident groups against 
civilians friendly to the government and against small Vietnamese military 
detachments.(99) The Self Defense Corps and the Civil Guard were expected 
to provide local protection and deal with small incidents. In order to 
meet Communist activity in remote areas, Diem established the Self Defense

Corps late in 1955 under ARVN. Members of the Self Defense Corps were sup-
ported by MAP and were given short periods of military training at pro-
vincial training sites from which they returned to their villages to serve 
in small squads and platoons under village and district control. The Self 
Defense Corps units were armed with obsolete French weapons.(100) As 
already noted, the Civil Guard was under the Vietnamese Ministry of Interior 
and was financed, trained, and equipped by the US Operations Mission of the 
American Embassy, with the actual training and equipping being performed on 
contract with Michigan State University. The Civil Guard forces were 
assigned to province chiefs as rural police, to be employed either offen-
sively or defensively within a province as necessary. If Civil Guard forces 
were assigned to assist an ARVN operation, the forces remained under the 
command of the province chief who might or might not cooperate with the ARVN 
commander. (101) 
After observing that the Civil Guard forces were inadequately trained 
and equipped and had no established logistical supply channels, General 
Williams recommended repeatedly as early as mid-1957 that the Civil Guard 
should either be transferred to the direct control of the Vietnamese 
Ministry of Defense or that USOM should employ capable civilian training 
officers and buy the necessary equipment for the guardsmen. According to 
Williams, Ambassador Durbrow refused to make a change in the assignment. 
President Diem made the same recommendation and was quoted as saying that 
Durbrow was impatient at Diem's over-concern with security and lack of 
proper stress upon economic development. Williams also stated that the 
Embassy informed Diem in June 1957 that assistance funds would be withheld 
if he transferred the Civil Guard to military control. In William's view 
the small, poorly armed guard detachments were "sitting ducks" for the 
Vietcong attacks which came in increasing numbers after mid-1957. "I think 
undoubtedly," Williams recalled, "that our failure to assist the Government 
of Vietnam by providing US military advisers, arms and equipment, and 
training guidance for the Civil Guard -- and giving them a logistical base 
to work from -- was one of the biggest mistakes our policy makers made in 
Vietnam. "(102) 
The American mutual defense program for Vietnam gave transcendent 
priority to the development of the Army of Vietnam and only passing emphasis 
to the building of indigenous naval and air forces. The Vietnamese Navy 
was organized with some assigned river assault boats in 1952. Though some 
large craft were added after the 1954 Geneva agreements and US Navy advisory 
efforts began in early 1955, the Vietnamese naval program remained under the 
direction of the French high commissioner for Indochina and was carried out 
by a joint TRIM staff, under the immediate command of a French Navy captain, 
who was also CINC of the Vietnamese Navy. At the severe reduction of French 
forces in the first half of 1955, France formally relinquished command over 
the Vietnamese Navy an 1 July 1955, and an 20 August the senior Vietnamese 
naval lieutenant commander was appointed CINC of the Vietnam Navy. In the 
following year, the French gradually ceded control over naval installations 
in Vietnam.(103)

As has been seen, the Vietnamese Air Farce (VNAF) came into being at 
Chief of State Bao nails insistence in June 1951, without any guiding con-
cept other than General Nguyen Van Hinh's desire to build a close support 
tactical air arm specifically designed far local flying conditions. (104) 
On 12 January 1954, the French Air Farce requested that the United States 
modify its MDAP force basis in order to equip the Vietnamese Air Force 
with a transport squadron, a fighter squadron, and a training center. At 
this time, the US Air Staff was willing to provide an armed T-6 aircraft 
complement for a VNAF squadron, but it thought that any Vietnamese trans-
port pilots should be employed in the undermanned and over-equipped French 
transport squadrons.(105) In a public interview in March 1955, General J. 
Lawton Collins stated the concept that would be used in building an 
indigenous Vietnamese air force. Noting that South Vietnam would depend 
chiefly upon SEATO for air and naval support in case of external aggression, 
Collins stated that the Vietnamese would have "only light planes, and we 
will not attempt to build up any combat Air Force. It will be a small Air 
Force that will be used for liaison purposes, observation and adjustment of 
fire -- that kind of thing.u(106) 
In reviewing Vietnam force requirements on 17 August 1955, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff recommended a force level of approximately 4,000 individuals 
for the Vietnamese Air Force and specified its major cambat force objective 
as being two transport squadrons, one fighter bomber squadron, and two 
liaison squadrons.(107) Later that month in Washington, a USAF MDAP planning 
conference refined the fiscal year 1950-55 commitments and provided for 
equipping VNAF Squadrons generally with MDAP aircraft and materiel to be 
released by the French Air Force in Indochina. This programming called for 
VNAF to receive 20 F8F fighter bombers, 35 C-47 air transports, and 60 L-19 
liaison planes, 32 of the latter to be assigned to liaison squadrons and the 
remainder to the training school at Nha Trang.(108) This basic program 
would be followed with only a few deviations. MAAG-Saigon secured a devia-
tion to permit the allotment of 17 F8Fs and eight RF8Fs to the VNAF fighter-
bomber squadron. The RF8Fs were programmed in order to provide the 
Vietnamese with a small reconnaissance capability but as will be seen they 
would not be delivered. In addition to the JCS major force levels, the 
Pacific Air Farce also recommended that VNAF should be provided with one 
helicopter support squadron with a dual mission of airlift and air rescue. 
Since the French had received H-19 helicopters in Indochina under the fiscal 
year 1950-55 programs and the United States had agreed to continue to sup-
port these planes during the buildup of indigenous Indochina forces, the 
proposal to provide VNAF withahelicopter unit at such time as the French 
returned excess H-19s to MDAP custody was accepted in the Vietnam air 
program. (109) 
In his plan for Vietnamese training submitted in January 1955, General 
O'Daniel made the decision that the Air Force Section of MAAG Vietnam would 
be allocated 55 of the permissible 342 US military spaces.(110) The small 
size of the Air Force Secticn -- together with the fact that the USAF per-
sonnel were also responsible for making inventories, receiving, and 
determining disposition of huge quantities of excess MDAP air materiel that

had been retrieved in Tonkin and dumped at the Bien Hoa air depot -- had a 
major effect upon Franco-American plans for VNAF training. As was the 
case with the Army advisors, General O'Daniel divided USAF personnel 
between the MAAG Air Farce Section located in downtown Saigon and the 
TRIM section which operated at another.location and also at field locations. 
Air Force personnel in the two sections often displayed contrary views on a 
given subject, and an inspection team noted that the division Of Air Force 
responsibilities between MAAG and TRIM made for frequently uncoordinated, 
inefficient, and somewhat strained relationships between Air Force personnel. 
(111) In the delineation of responsibility for VNAF training, France agreed 
to provide officers and non-commissioned officer personnel in advibory 
capacity with major air headquarters and operational units; provide tech-
nical training support for Vietnamese assigned to an-the-job training (OJT) 
with French units; provide training spaces for Vietnamese in air training 
schools in France and North Africa; provide OJT training for Vietnamese 
maintenance and logistical personnel; and provide French Air Force personnel 
to staff and man VNAF units and the training school at Nha Trang until 
Vietnamese personnel were available. The United States agreed to provide 
advisory personnel to work in association with French personnel in major 
headquarters and operational units; maintain a small nucleus of personnel 
at the Nha Trang training school and the Bien Hoa air depot; provide limited 
air training in the United States; and furnish personnel to advise VNAF in 
logistical and supply procedures.(112) In the in-country training managed 
by TRIM, the French lir Force employed 123 advisors while the USAF could 
provide only 13 people.(113) 
USAF officers who were assigned in Vietnam and those who made inspection 
trips there reported unfavorably upon French training of the VNAF, both as to 
its progress and quality. On the operational side, USAF officers did not 
think that VNAF was progressing rapidly enough, and they were unhappy that 
the French were training Vietnamese logisticians according to inefficient 
French maintenance and supply procedures. Uncertainty as to how long the 
French would leave advisors in Vietnam was troubling, as well as the fact 
that French Air Force withdrawal plans turned bases over to the Vietnamese 
before the latter could man and operate them. In withdrawing, the French 
also withdrew certain equipment (such as portable electrical generators) 
which the VNAF required. Moreover, the French were increasingly unpopular 
with the Vietnamese and with President Diem, who wanted the French military 
advisors removed.(114) 
Although France's occupation of Vietnam ended with the withdrawal of 
the French GING on 26 April 1956, the French Air Force continued to bear the 
major responsibility for VNAF training. In fact, for several months after 
the dissolution of TRIM, the French were solely responsible for advising 
VNAF, and all that USAF officers could do was to give advice when requested, 
attempt to stay abreast of VNAF programs, and program for Vietnamese training 
in the United States.(115) In November 1956, however, the French agreed to

relinquish responsibility for VNAF depot supply training to USAFadvisors, 
since it had become apparent that if VNAF was to benefit from MAP support 
something similar to the USAF logistical system had to be installed. (116) 
After a visit to Southeast Asia, General Sory Smith reported that the 
United States could not hope to develop an effective aid program for the 
VNAF until it could take over the training mission from the French. (117) 
In April 1957 negotiations between President Diem and the French Ambassador 
led to a decision that all French training missions could be withdrawn 
from Vietnam at the completion of training classes in progress. In view of 
the fact that: the Air Force Section MAAG would have to advise VNAF, its 
authorization for USAF personnel was increased to 10 administrative and 29 , 
training officers and 30 administrative and 53 training airmen, for a total 
of 122 persons. All French military missions were removed from Vietnam by 
31 July 1957, leaving the United States completely responsible for assistance 
to Vietnam's army, navy, and air force. (118) 
Having failed to train Vietnamese Air Force command and logistical per-
sonnel, the French Air Force had great difficulty in turning over its 
authority to the VNAF, and these difficulties left long-lingering defects 
in the fledgling air arm. A French air officer commanded VNAF until 1 July 
1955, when VNAF came under the command of President Diem's government. At 
this time, Lt Colonel Nguyen Khanh, a Vietnamese Army paratroop officer 
already serving as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces General Staff, 
assumed command of VNAF. (119) In a rather hurried undertaking coincidental 
to the removal of French Air Force units, the 1st VNAF Air Transport Squadron 
was activated with C-47 aircraft an 1 July 1955, but for some time Frenchmen 
continued to fill most of the squadron's supervisory slots. After a year, 
the C-47 squadron was reorganized an 1 July 1956 as the 1st Air 'Transport 
Group, with the let and 3d Air Transport Squadrons and 32 unit equipment C447 
transports.(120) Already in being under other designations, the let and 2d 
VNAF Liaison Squadrons received MDAP L-19 liaison aircraft in 1955-56; and 
following VNAF assumption of authority over the training establishment at 
Nha Trang on 7 July 1955, this organization was also equipped with L-19s. 
(121) As the time approached for organizing the VNAF fighter-bomber 
squadron, Pacific Air Force officers were skeptical of the ability of the 
available Vietnamese pilots to handle F8Fs and made a tentative suggestion 
that this squadron might better be Outfitted with armed T-6 planes, a sug-
gestion which they knew would be poorly received by the status-conscious 
Vietnamese. Proceeding with the original program, the French operated a 
transition school at Cap Saint Jacques in the winter of 1955-56, and the 
1st VNAF Fighter Squadron was activated at Bien Hoa Airfield an 1 June 1956 
with 25 F8Fs and an expectation of receiving RF8Fs at a future date.(122) 
In addition to these MAP provided aircraft, the VNAF also operated a Special 
Air Mission Squadron with an Aero-CoMmander transport, three C-47s, and 
three Beechcraft C-45s -- planes that had been purchased by the Vietnamese 
gavernment.(123) With four officer pilots and 25 airmen, all French trained, 
the VNAF activated its 1st Helicopter Squadron at Tan Son Nhut Airfield on

1 June 1957. Lacking helicopters, the pilots maintained their flying 
proficiency with the French helicopter unit that transported members of 
the International Control Commission. The French unit terminated its 
activities an 26 April 1958 and 10 of its excess H-19 helicopters were 
reallocated to the 1st VNAF Helicopter Squadron. (124) 
By way of general summary, USAF persannel in Vietnam would note that 
VNAF proved more proficient in flying planes than in maintaining the air-
craft and the air facilities that were received from the French. Since the 
Indochina war had largely been fought in the north, the French had devoted 
most of their efforts to developing the air facilities around Hanoi. As a 
result, the air facilities that would be turned over to VNAF had numerous 
deficiencies. Tan Son Nhut Airfield near Saigon was South Vietnam's inter-
national airport and best air facility. Here with American aid a main 
7,200-foot asphalt runway and adjacent ramps-t were opened in mid-1956, and 
the US International Cooperation Agency would begin planning and ultimately 
complete another 10,000-foot cement concrete runway. At Tourane Airfield 
(which the Vietnamese began to call by its Annamese name, Da Nang, in 1958) 
the French laid down a NATO standard 7,800-foot asphalt runway in 1953-54, 
but this field lacked maintenance buildings and permanent facilities, such 
as runway lights. The old French air depot at Bien Hoa had permanent ware-
houses and hangers, but its pierced steel runway was short, even for con-
ventional F8F operations. Nha Trang's flight surfaces and buildings could 
accommodate light training functions, but the field had limited capabilities 
for tactical aircraft. At Cap Saint Jacques (which the Vietnamese would 
call Vung Tau) the French built and used an air base with a 5,900-foot 
pierced steel plank runway during 1955-56, but, in withdrawing, they stripped 
the airfield and left it almost demolished.(125) Even if the South Vietnamese 
air bases had been in good order, the VNAF's limited strength of 3,300 per- , 
sons as of 1 July 1955 (including 1,245 individuals still in training) would 
have made it difficult to take over the Vung Tau base; moreover, the base 
had been too completely gutted to permit it to be retained in use. (126) 
Under the French regime some Vietnamese had received aircraft main-
tenance and supply training in France ar at Nha Trang, but French Air Force 
personnel had managed VNAF logistics and had operated the Air Depot at Bien 
Hoa. Thus in July 1955 the VNAF had very little internal support capability 
and for a time was virtlially incapable of even squadron maintenance and 
supply. A major logistical crisis ensued when the MAP took over operation 
of the Bien Hoa Air Depot on I March 1956. While the Vietnamese adequately 
manned the facility with 359 military and 150 civilian technicians, VNAF 
supervisors were too inexperienced to manage control of supply, quality 
standards, or production. The situation was further complicated when the 
French suddenly withdrew their supply advisors in mid-August 1956, but, as 
has been seen, US HAAG advisors were able to step into this breach and 
begin to introduce USAF supply practices. Under American tutelage in 1957-58 
the VNAF logistical posture &mod some improvement. Prior to this, the Air

Force MAAG had been stymied in computing VNAF logistical requirements by 
a lack of inventories and the failure of using organizations to turn in 
excesses accumulated from the French, but in the last half of 1957 a 
temporary equipment-recovary mission (TERM) from the Southern Air Materiel 
Area Pacific (SAMAP) in the Philippines made headway in reducing excesses 
and implanting a consumption data reporting system. The Air MAAG estab-
lished and monitored a VNAF production control unit at the Bien Hoa depot. 
In 1958, composite MAAG, VNAF, and SAMAP teams made extensive surveys and 
prepared a document to serve as a guide for a proper logistical posture 
to be achieved in a time-phased schedule.(127) 
Although the VNAF logistical situation showed marked improvements in 
1957-1958 and the Vietnamese were entirely cooperative, the transition from 
French to American air logistical systems was very difficult. In general, 
the VNAF liaison squadrons became able to maintain their L-19s, but the 
fighter squadron had considerable difficulty with its F8Fs. Here the problem 
was a composite of limited Vietnamese skills, aged and obsolete aircraft, and 
declining supply support from Navy, sources in the United States. In October 
1958, Washington notified MAAG-Vietnam that armed T-28 aircraft would have to 
be programmed as replacements for the VNAF F8Fs. Such planes were unaccept-
able to the VNAF commander, who was galled that the Thais, Filipinos, and 
Chinese Nationalists had jets, and later in the year the US MAAG convinced 
the Office of Secretary of Defense that the VNAF was actually unable to con-
vert to any sort of new aircraft in the immediate future.(128) 
In mid-1958 the Vietnamese Air Farce attained an authorized strength 
of 4,140 military personnel, which at this time included 126 pilots, 105 
trainee pilots, 179 other aircrew Personnel, and 3,730 ground personnel.(129) 
In terms of the disproportionate17. large ARVN force, VNAF was very small 
and would not be able to provide a hard core for future expansion when this 
would be urgently required.(130) The VNAF was in theory an independent 
service, but in terms of organization and leadership it was dominated by the 
Vietnamese Any. Organizationally, VNAF was dependent upon ARVN for ordnance, 
quartermaster, engineering, signal, and other specialized services, including 
the maintenance of its physical air base plants. Only in the realm of air 
technical items was VNAF in any way independent and even then its directives 
and procedures had to be approved by the ARVN-controlled Joint General Staff. 
The Joint General Staff also directed such operations as the VNAF was expected 
to perform in tactical support of ARVN undertakings. VNAF's assigned mis-
sions included airlift of personnel and supplies; paradrop of personnel and 
supplies; visual and photographic reconnaissance; medical air evacuation; and 
tactical air-ground support. VNAF. used its liaison squadrons for visual 
reconnaissance, but it had no formal photographic reconnaissance capabilities 
since expected RF8Fs would not be made available to the 1st Fighter Squadran.(131) 
As the older and far larger service, ARVN also dominated VNAF's leader-
ship. At its beginnings in 1951, Vietnamese air officers were selected from 
the top cadets at the military school at Dalat, who upon graduation were

assigned to flying schools in France or North Africa, or to the Vietnamese 
flying school at Nha Trang. Non-commissioned officers and airmen were 
recruited from the Army.(132) When VNAF became independent on 1 July 1955, 
Lt Colonel Nguyen Khanh permitted many ARVN officers to transfer into VNAF . 
command and staff positions. Other high-ranking VNAF officers who conducted 
operations, planning, and support functions were "washed-out" pilot trainees 
who were "early returnees" from French aviation schools and arrived at a 
good time to be integrated into top staff positions. These "political officers" 
were resented by VNAF flying officers and were often less than competent in 
their performance of duty. On the other hand, VNAF flying officers were very 
young and relatively inexperienced. Lt Colonel Nguyen Xuan Vinh, who was 
appointed Acting Commander of VNAF in February 1958 and would continue to 
hold this title until 1962, had been born in North Vietnam in 1930. Colonel 
Vinh's effectiveness benefitted from personal favor he found with President 
Diem, but other young flying officers -- and most were about Vinh's age --
found it difficult to give and even more difficult to enforce orders. 
According to American observers, the officers liked to identify themselves 
with their subordinates down to and including enlisted grades, a trait that 
was partly due to integrated kinship ties throughout the country. Very few 
of the Vietnamese air officers seem to have had a basic concept of how their 
aircraft ought to be employed to have a maximum effect upon the enemy. If 
the strength of the VNAF officer corps left something to be desired, the 
morale and effectiveness of Vietnamese airmen -- with a MAAG-reported desertion 
rate of somewhere between 8 and 12 percent -- was even less satisfactory.(133) 
The American offer of assistance to South Vietnam made by President 
Eisenhower to Ngo Dinh Diem on 1 October 1954 was designed to aid the Vietnamese 
in developing a government that would be capable of resisting military aggres-
sion or subversion and would be politically enlightened and effective toward 
its citizens. Most American estimates in 1958-59 credited Diem with making 
progress toward achieving these objectives, although not as much or as fast 
as many observers would have liked. 
On the political level, President Diem led the Republic of Vietnam 
through general elections for the establishment of a National Assembly on 4 
March 1956 and the adoption of a constitution on 26 October of the same year. 
In his foreign policy Diem was a supporter of Free World programs. In con-
versations with Ambassador Durbrow in 1957, Diem favored the establishment of 
very close relations between South Vietnam and SEATO, but the United Kingdom 
and Canada objected that this would disrupt the status quo as viewed by the 
Communists and would have an adverse effect on India, and Diem dropped the 
idea of affiliation with SEATO. (134) In mid-1958 Pacific Air Force intel-
ligence estimated that Diem was popular enough with the Vietnamese people to 
win a free and democratic election if such could be held throughout Vietnam. 
(135) Other official evaluations recognized that Diem had weaknesses. Vice 
Admiral George W. Anderson, Chief of Staff, Pacific Command, pointed out that 
Diem's government in Saigon was "rather naive and that there is not too much 
71.

depth to its leadership." At this same time, Lt Colonel H. C. McNeese, 
Air Attache at Saigon, described Dien as "dedicated" but authoritarian. 
Diem himself described his government as a "controlled democracy. "(136) 
In speaking about Vietnam, Assistant Secretary of State Walter S. 
Robertson recognized that Diem had instituted firm control measures that 
caused criticism, but Robertson considered that the measures were largely 
justified by the continued threat of the Vietminh and the fact that about 
80 percent of Diem's countrymen were illiterate and required strong 
leadership. (137) 
With American assistance South Vietnam's economy steadily forged 
ahead from the chaos that had existed in 1954. In 1956 Diem issued a 
presidential decree aimed at breaking up large land holdings created 
during the colonial period and providing for the distribution of over 
600,000 acres of land to over 115,000 tenant farmer households. Other 
aspects of Diem's economic policy inclined toward economic nationalism. 
Concerned about Chinese domination of Vietnam's trade and commerce, Diem 
promulgated a series of decrees and ordinances restricting commercial 
operations to persons who had been born to Vietnamese citizenship, or had 
officially assumed it by 9 May 1957. The economic nationalism was popular 
with the Vietnamese, but American observers noted that French investors 
were withdrawing from the country and Chinese capital was idled.(138) In 
the spring of 1957, Ambassador Durbrow impressed on Diem the danger of 
bringing too much pressure upon the indigenous overseas-Chinese.(139) 
Official US. observers also did not believe that Diem was serious enough 
about establishing a comprehensive national budget or heavy-enough internal 
taxes. South Vietnam was nevertheless able to demonstrate substantial eco-
nomic prqgress, with the main gains taking place in agriculture. Rubber, 
the largest source of foreign exchange, surpassed pre-1941 production in 
1956, and exports of rubber would earn almost $48 million in 1960. In 1957, 
rice production passed pre-war levels, earning about $20 million in foreign 
exchange that year, and over $27 million in 1960. Also in 1960, the gross 
national product of South Vietnam amounted to $110 per capita as compared 
to only $70 per capita in North Vietnam. In view of this economic program, 
US economic aid, which totalled $281 million in fiscal year 1957, would be 
cut to less than $145 million in fiscal year 1961.(140) 
Given the establishment of a Southeast Asian regional defense organiza-
tion and the increasing strength of the Republic of Vietnam, American 
leaders saw the Communist threat to South Vietnam as shifting from overt 
attack from the north to possible internal subversion. By March 1958 
Admiral Stump considered that there was no chance that the North Vietnamese 
Army would be able to "walk-inn inta South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese 
would be delayed a sufficient time by ARVN forces and by the terrain to 
permit help to arrive from SEATO. (141) There were significantly different 
estimates of the strength and capabilities of Communist guerrillas remaining 
in South Vietnam. According to ARVN estimates as many as 10,000 Communist

guerrillas had remained in South Vietnam at the withdrawal of the Vietminh 
in 1954, but in late 1957 ARVN intelligence was reporting only 160 Vietcong 
in the central mountains of northern South Vietnam and only 1,100 in the 
Mekong delta. On 22 October 1957 Communist terrorists bombed US MAG and 
Information Service installations in Saigon, wounding 13 American military 
personnel, but President Diem was nevertheless optimistic about the military 
situation. On 26 October 1957, in an address occasioned by the second 
anniversary of the founding of the Republic, he stated that "order has been 
restored notwithstanding some isolated acts of brigandage or assassination 
perpetrated by Communist adventurers."(1)42) 
Subsequent events would make it evident that Diem was optimistic about 
South Vietnam's internal security and that the ARVN estimates did not sug-
gest the true power of the guerrilla forces. By mid-1957 the Communists 
had begun to infiltrate men and materiel assistance into South Vietnam, 
where the cadres grouped with sect remnants.(143) In 1958 Republic of 
Vietnam Armed Forces (RVNAF) estimates of Vietcong strength ranged upward 
from 2,000 to 9,0oq and BVNAF figures showed that Diem's district and village 
officials were being assassinated at a rate of 25 a month in the last six 
months of 1958.(1)i)i) The internal threats to Diem's government were reported 
to Washington, but there were different evaluations in Saigon as to the 
significance of the Vietcong threat.(145) Alarmed at the guerrilla activities, 
General Williams arranged for the MAAG to receive. weekly ARVN reports of 
Vietcong atrocities and submitted them to the US Embassy, which, Williams said, 
dismissed the reports as Vietnamese propaganda and a ruse to justify increased 
military aid. (146) On 8 April 1959 Diem declared that the Republic of 
Vietnam was engaged in a "hot war" and described its southern provinces as 
being in a "state of siege.1(147) According to Diem, however, Ambassador 
Durbrow believed him to be obsessed with the security problem and advised him 
to lay more stress on economic progress. (1h8) And in July 1959 Durbrow told 
an inquiring delegation of US Senators that according to his estimates there 
were perhaps 3,000 Communist cadremen in South Vietnam but that they were 
compelled to hide in the jungles, forests, and swamps and were only able "to 
sneak out and make attacks an individuals and different posts. "(1h9) 
3. Laos and Cambodia Were Special Problems  
In post-Geneva Conference assessments of Southeast Asia's potentials 
and vulnerabilities, Laos and Cambodia would clearly never contribute greatly 
to collective Free World defense efforts, but the two nations were geo-
graphically situated an the flanks of Thailand and South Vietnam in such a 
position as to provide a convenient corridor southward fram Hanoi. In the 
French Indochina war, the Vietminh had shuttled men north and south over a 
network of rude trails in the Lao panhandle, which would become known col-
lectively as the Ho Chi Minh trail. If Laos were to be taken into the 
Communist bloc in its entirety, J. Graham Parsons, US Ambassador at 
Vientiane from 22 June 1956 to 6 March 1958, pointed out "it would bring

Thailand into immediate proximity to Communist-controlled territory and 
would expose the flank of free Vietnam."(150) While Laos was a corridor 
for Communist infiltration, Cambodia was the heart of the old Indochina 
peninsula. Speaking at a MAP conference in November 1956, Captain J. E. 
Gilroy, a member of MAAG-Cambodia, described the strategic significance 
of this nation: "In Communist hands, Cambodia could be the springboard 
from which the Communist could launch political, economic, or military 
thrusts for the complete conquest of all Southeast Asia and even Indonesia. 
Vietnam is particularly vulnerable to attacks emanating from Cambodia. 
Excellent routes of advance also exist into Thailand and thence to Malaya 
and Burma."(151) 
Throughout most of the Indochina War, Communist groups in Laos and 
Cambodia caused France little difficulty, and this condition prevailed 
until 1953 when Vietminh drives into Laos established Communist Pathet 
Lao strongholds in Phong Saly and Houa Phan (Sam Neua) Provinces and 
centers of activity in the hills east of the town of Thakhek in the 
southern panhandle of Laos. At Geneva the Vietminh delegation unsuccess-
fully sought to secure recognition far the Pathet Lao as the true Laotian 
government, a position which President Eisenhower rejected in a letter to 
King Sisavang Vong on 10 May in which he also expressed conviction that 
the forces of freedom, working in unison, would repulse the Communist 
imperialism that threatened his kingdam.(152) 
The agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Laos signed on 20 
July 1954 by a representative of the French Union and a Vietminh officer 
who signed for the "Commander-in-Chief of the fighting units of the Pathet 
Lao" accorded special political rights to the Pathet Lao "pending a 
political settlement." Pathet Lao forces -- approximately 3,000 individuals 
-- were to be regrouped in Phong Saly and Houa Phan pending integration into 
the Royal Lao Army or demobilization. The Royal Lao Government was to 
administer the provinces but with the provision that it would take measures 
for representation of the interests of the Pathet Lao until scheduled Lao 
general elections were held in August 1955. Vietminh and most French troops 
were to withdraw from Laos, and no new military bases could be established. 
The French were authorized to leave up to 1,500 military personnel in Laos 
to train the Laotian army and to maintain two French military establishments 
in Laos, manned by not more than 3,500 men. These agreements were to be 
monitored by the International Control Commission for Laos, with India as 
chairman and members from Canada and Poland. The Geneve agreement an 
Cambodia reflected a general lack of Vietminh activity in the country. 
Vietminh forces were to be withdrawn, the Communists Khmer Issaraks were to 
be integrated into the national community, and the agreement was to be 
monitored by another International Control Commission.(153) 
On the basis of the Pentalateral Agreement of 23 December 1950, the 
United States was authorized to provide military assistance to Laos and 
Vietnam, and after negotiations on 27..29 September 1954 the United States

and France agreed that both nations would continue to support Cambodia, 
Laos, and Vietnam, with direct channels of US aid to the new states. 
Pending the establishment of American embassies at Vientiane and Phnom 
Penh, Donald It. Heath represented the United States in these capitals as 
well as in Saigon. On 14 September 1954, however, Ambassador Robert 
McClintock arrived in Phnom Penh and on 4 February 1955 an American lega-
tion was opened in Vientiane. With the arrival of Ambassador Charles W. 
Yost in Vientiane on 10 August 1955 the legation became an embassy. (154) 
In preparation for the Franco-American diplomatic talks in September 
1954 and in view of Cambodian requests for US military aid on 20 May and 
for combined military and economic aid on 1 September 1954, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff undertook studies of the feasibility of providing US military 
assistance to Laos and Cambodia and these studies would continue for more 
than a year. The Royal Laotian Army (Forces Armees du( Royaume, or "FAR") 
had had its legal basis in the Franco-Laotian accords of 1949 which had 
established it under the operational control of the French CIN0 in Indo-
china. A rudimentary force of about 1,200 men under French cadres in 1949, 
the Lao army increased to 9,500 men in 1952. Under the impetus of US 
HEAP the Cambodian army was increased to 9,000. The French had provided 
officers and non-commissioned officers to both the Laotian and Cambodian 
armies, with the result that native officers and non-coins had not been 
developed. In their initial study and report concerning US military 
assistance to the former Indochina states, the Joint Chiefs recommended 
that the United States could not develop effective forces in Cambodia 
unless it dealt directly with the armed forces there, without French 
participation and control in the undertaking. They further stated that 
they could not recommend any force objectives for Laos since the Geneva 
agreement would not allow the United States to train Laotian military 
personnel or supervise the use of US MDAP equipment. (1%) 
When Laos and Cambodia gained their independence on 1 January 1955, 
however, the political situation demanded that the United States undertake 
support of the indigenous armies. Even though there were reports that the 
exact strength of the Lao army was not known, the United States effective 
an 1 January 1955 provided direct cash grants to Laos through its newly 
established national bank to provide pay to the Lao military forces at 
rates set by the French, this unique arrangement being justified by a 
belief that the Lao army was the principal bulwark against Communism in 
Laos. Early in 1955 the American Minister in Vientiane pointed out that 
the United States was already paying the Lao army and that the Geneva agree-
ment did not prevent the provision of military equipment to Laos and 
asked for guidance as to an appropriate strength for the Lao military forces. 
Citing their original objections, the Joint Chiefs would again refuse to 
specify a MDAP military force level, but in view of the Lao political situa-
tion they advised that 23,500 Lao troops should be adequate for internal

security. Early in 1956, following recommendations by Ambassador Yost and 
Admiral Stump and as the result of Admiral Radford's very strong support 
for the action, the Joint Chiefs acknowledged a requirement for expansion 
of the Lao army to 25,000 personnel, this modest increase being acceptable 
in view of psychological, political, and morale -- rather than military --
reasons.(156) In the case of Cambodia, the Joint Chiefs continued to find 
themselves unable to specify military force levels for MDAP as long as the 
French controlled the program. Pursuant to the Cambodian request and fol-
lowing an interchange of notes at Phnom Penh, however, the United States 
agreed effective on 16 May 1955 to provide direct military assistance to 
Cambodia. As the result of a MDAP survey, Ambassador McClintock favored 
US support of 31,000 Cambodian military personnel, with the Army to be 
organized into battalions. In the iatter half of 1955, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff acknowledged the commitment made by the Ambassador, but they advised that 
the 31,000 strength figure ought to be considered a maximum requirement.(157) 
The peculiar circumstances under which American military aid was to be 
rendered to Cambodia and Laos affected the US organization in the two 
countries. At Phnom Penh, Brigadier General Edwin S. Hartshorn, Jr., 
opened a MAAG in June 1955 with a strength of 29 officers and 30 enlisted 
men. Since MAP planning for Cambodia at this time did not encompass USAF 
equipment, no USAF people were incladed in the predominantly Army-manned 
MAAG. A French military mission of some 400 officers and men was solely 
responsible for advising the Cambodian general staff and for training, while 
the US MAAG provided technical and logistical assistance, to include end-use 
checks of US equipment at battalion level. In the first of many subsequent 
misunderstandings of US policy, the Cambodian government charged in April 
1956 that the United States was using its aid to coerce Cambodia into joining 
SEATO and had obliged Vietnam and Thailand to impose measures of economic 
warfare against Cambodia for the saMe alleged end. The United States flatly 
denied the charge, but the sensitive Cambodians arbitrarily limited the 
strength of the US MAAG to a maximum of 61 regularly assigned people and 35 
temporary duty (not to exceed 90-days) personnel.(158) When the first 
American aviation assistance was allocated to Cambodia in the latter half 
of 1956, the small program was monitored by USAF personnel from the MAAG in 
Saigon without difficulty. Being on bad terms with Vietnam, however, the 
Cambodian government objected to the procedure, compelling the United States 
to increase its air personnel in the JUSMAAG-Thailand by one officer and 
one airman to handle Cambodian air assistance programming. (159) 
In Laos the United States paid the Royal Army and provided equipment 
to it on the recommendation of the French, with only a small ability through 
the Embassy to determine what was happening. By agreement between the 
State and Defense Departments, a US Programs Evaluation Office (PEO) was 
activated. at Vientiane on 15 December 1955, headed by Thomas H. Unger and 
eventually consisting of 40 individuals, some of whom were retired US mili-
tary personnel. Organizationally, the PEO was assigned to and manned by 
the International Cooperation Administration and was attached to the US

Operations Mission in Vientiane. The functions of the PEO were similar to 
those of a MAAG with the exception that a French military mission was res-
ponsible for all Lao military training. The PEO personnel were authorized 
to make end-use inspections of American equipment held by Laotian army 
units in the field, but the Lao government did not like for PED people to 
be exposed to public view, and the US Embassy demanded that any end-use 
checks would be carried out with cautious discretion. On occasions, such 
as one for six weeks in September-October 1956, the US Embassy suspended 
field inspection visits by PED personnel.(160) 
Where army units organized during the Indochina War provided a basis 
for post-Geneva ground forces in Laos and Cambodia, the French had made 
only the most embryonic beginnings of Lao and Cambodian air forces, and 
these had been undertaken primarily to enhance the prestige of the local 
rulers. Established on 1 April 1954, the Cambodian air arm was a part of 
the Cambodian army and was initially to be equipped for training and 
occasional transport of key officials. Cambodia received its first planes 
from the French in mid-1955 and by November 1955 possessed 3 C-47, 2 
Cessna-180,. and 3 Cessna-170 transports, 4 FD-25A Fletcher attack planes, 
14 MS-733 and 3 MS-500 trainers, and 3 ms-500 liaison aircraft. In 
November 1955 33 Cambodian pilots and 12 pilot candidates were being 
trained by the French. The Cambodian aircraft were not organized into units 
and all of them were located at Pochentong Airfield at Phnom Penh, the only 
improved air facility in the country. (161) 
In Laos in 1955 a Lao air arm existed as a part of the Lao army, but 
it was chiefly a courtesy title for a small force of 220 people, 12 Lao 
pilot officers in training in France, 4 C-47s, and 9 mS-500 Crickets. The 
aircraft were located at Vientiane on loan from the French Air Force. A 
detachment of six French officers flew the Lao planes, and the French also 
operated 2 L-20s and 5 H-19 helicopters located at Vientiane, Xieng Khouang, 
Sam Neua, and Boun Neua in support of the International Control Commission. 
Lao Army troops in the field frequently required air resupply in excess of 
the Lao air arm's capability. In these cases, the French usually chartered 
civilian C-47s flown by Air Laos pilots. (162) The Lao unit was commanded 
by a French air officer, and French military ground crews maintained the Lao 
aircraft until late 1956. At this time the French maintenance crews 
returned home and contract maintenance had to be arranged.(163) 
In both Laos and Cambodia terrain conditions demanded aerial resupply 
for any effective military ground movement and the lack of all-weather 
roads in the mountains of Laos virtually demanded air support for any field 
undertaking. The air facility system in both countries, however, was 
extremely poor, the facilities in Laos being poorer than in any neighboring 
country except Cambodia which was the poorest. In a program begun in 1954 
the French improved Seno Airfield near Savannakhet for their awn use, giving 
it a 5,250-pierced steel plank runway and making it the best military air

facility in Laos. A US ISA project would provide another PSP runway at 
Vientiane which would be able to accommodate aircraft as large as C-130s 
in dry weather. There was a short aspihalt runway at Pakse, and a 31950-foot 
flight surface on the Plain of Jars near Xiang Khouang. The other Lao 
fields -- including that at Luang Prabang, the royal capitol -- were flat 
surfaces, usable only in dry weather. With ICA funding, Lao air facilities 
would be improved in 1957-59, but they would continue to be rudimentary.(164) 
Of a total of 15 usable airfields in Cambodia, only eight airfields had 
possibilities for handling a C-47 aircraft. In fact, Pochentong Airfield at 
Phnom Penh -- with a 5,298-foot PSP runway -- was the only developed airfield 
in the country. (165) 
The people of Laos and Cambodia were so predominantly rural and lacking 
in mechanical skills as to make recruitment and training of indigenous air 
force personnel very difficult. Very few Laotians understood the English 
language, and only 10 percent of than were literate. Very few Cambodians 
possessed a western education or any sort of a technical background, and 
most of them had no interest in any type of a military career.(166) Taking 
into consideration the lack of suitable manpower and economic poverty in 
Laos and Cambodia, the Pacific Air Force recommended in March 1956 that no 
efforts should be made to develop any.air forces in those countries beyond a 
minimal capability for air transport and air liaison. For Cambodia and Laos, 
PACAF accordingly recommended that both countries be allotted one composite 
transport/liaison squadron with C-47,.LT-6C, and T-6 aircraft.(169) Under 
review in PACOM in the spring of 1956, these force recommendations were 
substantially raised. In June 1956, CINCPAC proposed that Cambodia be pro-
vided an L-19 liaison squadron, a composite C-47/L-20 transport squadron, and 
an LT-6G armed reconnaissance squadron. The CINCPAC farce recommendation for 
Laos included a C-47 transport squadron, an LT-6G armed reconnaissance 
squadron, and a composite L-19/H-19 squadron.(168) In Washington at the 
direction of the Office of Secretary of Defense, four C-47 aircraft were 
included in the fiscal year 1956 MAP for Laos. As they had also done in 
regard to Army MAP commitments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff wished to see what 
political developments were going to occur in Laos and Cambodia before making 
aviation assistance commitments to these countries. In their final decision, 
moreover, the Joint Chiefs accepted PACAF's recommendations rather than those 
of PACOM, establishing the force objective for Cambodia as being a composite 
squadron with 25 C-47 and L-19 aircraft and for Laos as another composite 
squadron with 30 C-47 and L-19 aircraft.(169) There would be some substitu-
tion of aircraft types, but the camposite squadron objectives would not be 
changed for several years. 
The social, political, and economic situation prevailing in Laos after 
1954 greatly complicated the initiation and implementation of American 
assistance programs. When Laos gained its complete independence on 1 January 
1955, its government was a constitutional monarchy headed by aged King 
Sisavang Vong, who maintained his royal residence at Luang Prabang. Because

of infirmities, Sisavang Vong lived in virtual retirement, and Crown Prince 
Savang Vathana had exercised the royal powers since 1950 and would be 
formally invested as king following the death of the old king on 29 October 
1959. As a part of his ceremonial duties, the Lao king promulgated laws 
and designated the prime minister and cabinet members. Both Sisavang Vong 
and Savang Vathana were counted to be pro-western and anti-Communist.(170) 
Under the Lao monarch's ceremonial umbrella, political power in the 
land-locked kingdom was centered at the political capital of Vientiane, 
where factional politics sprang fram familial groupings of the French-
educated elite. Each family group had a base of power in a particular 
region, but its political following was not necessarily restricted to a 
region since a few individuals had begun to attain more general support 
throughout Laos, even though the vast majority of the two million Lao 
were for the most part not politically conscious. These clan groups 
included the Champassak family, whose head, Prince Boun Oum, was the 
dominant figure in southern Laos; the Sananikone family, important in 
Vientiane and headed by Phoui Sananikone; the equally-prestigious Souvannavong 
family which often shared political authority in Vientiane; and the cadet 
branch of the royal family, which included neutralist-inclined Prince Souvanna 
Phouma and his half-brother, Prince Souphanouvong, who nominally headed the 
Communist Pathet Lao.(171) 
Under close surveillance of the International Control Commission, Prime 
Minister Katay Sasorith worked to accomplish the goal specified by the Geneva 
agreement which called for a reintegration of the Pathet Lao into the Lao 
community, a feat which would also include reestablishment of government 
control over Houa Phan (Sam Neua) and Phong Saly provinces. During 1954-55 
the Pathet Lao showed no signs of adhering to the Geneva agreement but 
instead demanded continued control over their occupied provinces and recog-
nition as equals in the national government. As a price for participating 
in a national election, the Pathet Lao demanded election law changes that 
would have been advantageous to them. When their demands were not net, the 
Pathet Lao boycotted the election held on 25 December 1955 and refused to 
allow balloting in Sam Neua and Phong Saly.(172) 
Even though the Pathet Lao lost political influence which they might 
have attained in the National Assembly by boycotting the 1955 election, a 
strong sentiment for national unity led to the appointment of neutralist 
Souvanna Phouma as prime minister on 31 March 1956, with a pledge to settle 
the Pathet Lao issue. With the assistance of the International Control 
Commission, Souvanna Phouma and Souphanouvong made an agreement effective on 
1 August 1956 to stop sporadic fighting between Royal Lao Army (FAR) and 
Pathet Lao troops. At a meeting in Vientiane in the same month preliminary 
agreements were made looking toward the reintegration of the Pathet Lao 
battalions into the Royal Army. Soon after this, Souvanna Phouma accepted 
a Red Chinese invitation and visited Peking with ten of his cabinet members.

The activities of Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma caused some apprehen-
sion to the US government and to US Ambassador J. Graham Parsons, who 
arrived in Vientiane on 22 June 1956. The basic American concern was that 
Souvanna Phouma might make damaging concessions to the Pathet Lao to secure 
national unity. The United States opposed the visit of the Lao cabinet 
members to Peking, and it was additionally alarmed when it appeared that 
as many as 5,000 Pathet Lao troops might be integrated into the Royal Lao 
Army.(174) The corrupt Lao administration of the US aid programs as well 
as the inflationary effect of the aid programs on the Lao economy also 
began to be apparent in late 1956. As has been peen, the US aid programs 
had begun effective on 1 January 1955 when the United States had begun to 
provide about $34 million a year to pay and equip the Lao Army. Other 
programs in economic, health, and education fields amounted to an addi-
tional $34 million a year. To support most programs, the United States 
purchased Lao kip from the National Bank of Laos at the rate of 35 kip to 
each dollar. In order to absorb the new kip thus placed in circulation, 
arrangements were made whereby Lao importers would pay 35 kip to the Lao 
treasury for every dollar's worth of goods they were licensed to import, 
and the exporters would be paid in dollars outside Laos. In the interest 
of establishing support without delay, the Lao government was given pri-
mary control over cash-grant dollars. The flow of American goods into 
Laos under these programs was not only at a rate approximately ten times 
higher than the Lao economy could support, but the cash-grant arrangements 
were corruptly administered. Because of Lao inflation the prevailing kip-
dollar rate in Southeast Asia was 100 to 1, and Lao importers found them-
selves able to settle their accounts quite advantageously with cheap kip 
obtained in Thailand and Hongkong. In addition, import items were over-
invoiced, delivered short or defective, or diverted to other countries, 
particularly Thailand. when these abuses became apparent, the United States 
pressed Souvanna Phouma to devalue the kip was well as to tighten up on the 
issuance of import licenses. In December 1956, US aid to Laos was tempo-
rarily suspended but it was renewed when the Lao government undertook 
reforms in the management of import licensing.(175) 
Late in 1956 the Pathet Lao increased their price for integration 
within the national community, and by 28 December Souvanna Phouma had 
agreed to integrate Pathet Lao troops into the Royal Army, to give civil 
service positions to Communist functionaries, to accept the Pathet Lao 
as a legal political party, to schedule supplementary elections for an 
enlarged National Assembly, to include the Pathet Lao in his cabinet, 
and to accept economic aid from any nation. These concessiaas appeared 
quite dangerous to the United States, and, mainly as a result of efforts 
made by Deputy Prime Minister Katay Sasorith,. they were not placed before 
the National Assembly prior to its adjournment in March 1957. When the 
Pathet Lao increased their demands in early 1957, to include a demonstra-
tion of Lao neutrality involving exchange of diplomatic representatives 
with the Communist bloc and immediate acceptance of aid from Communist 
China, the US State Department expressed a hope that the Royal Government 
of Laos would ?not be dictated to by dissident groups enjoying no 
constitutional status. "(176)

After a period of political instability marked by Souvanna Phouma's 
resignation in May 1957 and the Assembly's failure to agree on any other 
successor, Souvanna Phouma returned to the premiership in August 1957 and 
reinstituted negotiations with the Pathet Lao. The United States and 
Great Britain now opposed the establishment of a coalition government, 
but India and France wanted to see a settlement of the Lao problem. The 
articulate population of Laos also wanted a settlement, and, in early 
November 1957, Souvanna Phouma and Souphanavong reached an agreement which 
called for the installation of two Pathet Lao leaders into the national 
cabinet, integration of some 1,500 Pathet Lao troops into the Royal Army, 
the holding of national elections for an expanded National Assembly, and 
finally the reincorporation of Phong Saly and Sam Neua into the national 
community.(177) On a visit to Washington in January 1958, Souvanna Phouma 
assured President Eisenhower that he "recognized that the Communist ideology 
is a danger to the Free World, and stressed that any system which throttled 
the dignity and freedom of the individual could have no appeal for the Lao 
people." Nhen State Department representatives pressed Souvanna to devalue 
the kip to its appropriate worth, he pointed out that such devaluation 
would create popular discontent and handicap the anti-Communist parties in 
the May election. An agreement subsequently arrived at, however, provided 
that beginning 1 April 1958, US dollars would be placed in a blocked 
segregated account, that kip at a rate of 35 to the dollar would be issued 
against these dollars to pay Lao troops, and that the dollars would not be 
used by the Lao government until agreement had been reached on monetary 
reform. (178) 
According to J. Graham Parsons, who returned fram Laos on 8 February 
1958 to become Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, 
the United States hoped that the Lao elections scheduled for 4 May 1958 
would go badly for the Communists. In the election, 20 new seats were to 
be filled in the National Assembly, raising the membership to 59, and an 
additional seat of a deceased legislator would be at stake. If the Pathet 
Lao . -- who were campaigning as the Neo Lao Hak Sat (Lao Patriotic 
Front) -- could be held to three or four seats in the full legislature, 
it might be possible, when the Souvanna Phouma government resigned after 
the election, to form a new government that would not include Communists. 
If this came about, Laos would have arrived at a point where the fighting 
was ended, the Communists would have been rolled back in Sam Neua and 
Phong Saly and eliminated from the governmeAt, and Laos would be united 
and independent. (179) 
Before leaving Vientiane, Ambassador Parsons had feared that us aid 
had not penetrated far enough into the rural areas of Laos to have an 
impact upon the villagers, who might well succumb to Communist propaganda 
and support NLHS candidates in the May election. Parsons therefore 
inaugurated "Operation Booster Shot" -- a village aid program with some 
90 work projects, including well-digging, erection of small irrigation 
and flood control dams, repair of schools and temples, repair of roads

and airfields, construction of hospitals, and delivery of some 1,500 tons 
of food, medical and construction supplies, and other useful commodities 
to rural areas.(180) Few of the villages could be reached by road, and 
most of the aid goods would have to be dropped from the air. As directed 
by the Pacific Air Forces, Brigadier, General C. H. Pottenger, Commander of 
Japan-based 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo), established a small trans-
port task force under Lt Colonel Harry B. Bankard which arrived at Bangkok 
on 27 March and moved to Vientiane on 4 April. In missions flown from 27. 
March through 14 May, the mission commander used a total of two C-124s of 
the 1503d Air Transport Wing, seven C-130s and eight 0-119s of the 483d 
Troop Carrier Squadron, and four C-119s from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron. 
The aircraft were brought to Don Muang or Vientiane as needed and employed 
on 280 flights that airlifted 1134.8. tons and airdropped 301.1 tons of 
construction equipment, building supplies, medical supplies, food, and 
clothing. Heavy equipment drops into Houa Khong, Phong Saly, and Sam Neua 
included such items as D-4 bulldozers, quarter-ton trucks and trailers, a 
sheeps-foot earth roller, soil brick machines, and pre-fabricated hospitals. 
The C-119s operated successfully froM the 3,900-foot PSP strip at Vientiane, 
but all crews -- even though accompanied by a Civil Air Transport pilot who 
knew the country -- had difficulties locating small drop zones in moun-
tainous areas. In the morning hours before the clouds formed, a layer of 
smoke from native slash and burn farmer fires normally rose to 12,000 feet 
and critically reduced visibility up to that level. Despite the fact that 
the operation mushroomed and continued longer than anyone originally 
anticipated, the air phase of "Operation Booster Shot" was effectively 
accomplished under difficult conditions.(181) 
As a whole "Operation Booster Shot" cost less than one-tenth of the 
American aid to Laos in 1958 and for the fizsttirne made the assistance pro-
gram meaningful to Lao villagers. Commenting on "Booster Shot" on 18 June 
1958, the new US Ambassador Horace Smith wrote: "It can safe4-.- be said 
that this particular aid program . . . has had a greater impact on Laos 
than any other aid program which the United States has undertaken in this 
area to date."(182) The effort, however, had come too late to counteract 
the Pathet Lao propaganda which charged that Chinese merchants and Lao 
officials reaped the benefits of American aid rather than the Lao villagers. 
The pro-government forces also hopelessly weakened their chance for 
electoral victory by running 85 candidates for the 21 seats at stake. Only 
13 NLHS candidates ran and nine were elected, while another four seats were 
won by a peace party that was headed by a Chinese Communist sympathizer, 
Quinim Pholsena, and favored contacts with Soviet bloc countries. Standing 
for election at Vientiane, Prince Souphanonvong received more votes than 
any other winning candidate. Shaken by the extent of the leftist victory, 
Phoui Sananikone's Independents and Katay Sasorith's Nationalists merged to 
form the Laotian People's Rally (LPR) under the leadership of Souvanna Phouma. 
In Washington, a Congressional inquiry into the administration of American 
aid was already underway, and, in view of the corruption in the import pro-
gram and the need for monetary reform, the United States did not make its 
normal deposit of dollars in the Lao bank account in New York on 1 July 
1958.(183)

In the interval that his government remained in office, Souvanna 
Phouma announced that Laos had accomplished the objectives of the Geneva 
agreement and asked for the removal of the International Control Commis-
sion, which adjourned sine die on 20 July 1958 over the objections of its 
Polish member. For a Nir1472s it appeared that Souvanna might weather 
the crisis, but he had begun to get serious opposition from anti-Communists. 
During earlier crises, the Royal Lao Army had remained aloof from politics, 
even though the Army's Chief of Staff, Colonel Ouane Rathikone, had often 
remarked to US representatives that he could resolve the political indeci-
sion with military action. Instead of attempting a coup, Ouane met with a 
group of other young reform-minded men on 17 June to form a new political 
organization called the Committee for the Defense of National Interests 
(CDNI). On a vote concerning monetary reforms on 23 July, the young 
reformers combined with other National Assemblymen opposed to Souvanna and 
brought down Souvanna's government. On 18 August 1958, Phoui Sa.nanikone 
inaugurated a new cabinet which excluded Souphanouvong and the other Pathet 
Lao representatives and included four CDNI members. Phoui emphasized that 
Laos would remain neutral, but that it would not accept a Communist ideology. 
In negotiations with the United States, Phoui on 10 October revised the kip 
to dollar exchange rate from 35 to 1 to 80 to 1, thus in effect introducing 
free convertibility of the kip and eliminating the need for the notorious 
system of import licenses. In view of the monetary reform, the United States 
promptly reinstituted its aid program. In other world affairs, Phoui refused 
aid from the Soviet Union and Communist China and also refused to exchange 
diplomatic relations with the Communist bloc nations.(184) 
As viewed from Washington, the Phoui government was the best that Laos 
had had since achieving its independence. "Despite all the things that went 
wrong in Laos in the administration of the aid programs," observed Secretary 
Robertson, "Laos has the best government today it has ever had and has been 
saved from being taken over by the Communists."(185) Both North Vietnam 
and the Pathet Lao, however, vigorously demanded that the International Con-
trol Commission be reinstituted in Laos, Hanoi making the assertion that peace 
in Indochina was indivisible. After a visit to Vientiane in September 1958 
incident to the establishment of closer relations between Laos and the Republic 
of Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Nhu, brother and political advisor to President Diem, 
stated that the new Phoui government was the strongest that Laos had ever had. 
Nhu nevertheless pointed out that the presence of a strong government in Laos 
could lead to covert Communist intervention aimed at bringing about a more 
stringent neutralization of the country.(186) 
Although the United States had been paying and providing some military 
equipment to the Royal Lao Army, the French had exercised sole responsibility 
for Lao military training. As France withdrew her forces from Vietnam, 
French diplomats in Saigon by mid-1957 were urging a similar withdrawal from 
Laos. At the request of OINCPAC and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary 
of State informed the French government that it was important to SEATO plan-
ning for the air base at Seno to be kept in operation. Accordingly, France 
agreed to continue to maintain Seno though on a reduced scale.(187) At this 
same time, the Laotians were growing impatient with the French. The French

major who commanded the Laos air arm reported a loss of discipline in 
late 1957 and asked the Minister of National Defense to name a Lao as 
commander; this was done in January 1958 when a Lao army colonel, S. K. 
Sasorith, assumed the post as an added duty.(188) By late 1958 the 
French force in Laos, originally 5,000 strong had fallen to approximately 
800, and Seno was the only remaining French base in Laos. In November 
1958, Premier Phoui advised US Ambassador Horace H. Smith that the French 
ambassador had told him that the French would reduce the Seno garrison still 
further both for the sake of economy and to transfer more personnel to 
Algeria. Phoui felt that the Seno garrison reflected an Lao sovereignty, 
but he wanted increased training assistance for Lao military forces.(189) 
Where the Joint Chiefs of Staff had initially considered military 
assistance for Laos to be a political problem, General Maxwell D. Taylor, 
Army Chief of Staff, became concerned about the military situation in Laos 
in July 1958, especially the effect that the withholding of US assistance 
might be having upon the Lao army. In August, Taylor persuaded the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to send a memorandum to the Secretary of Defense asking him 
to express grave concern to the Secretary of State concerning the danger of 
delaying US aid funds. In order to obtain first-hand military information 
about Laos, Brigadier General John A. Heintges was placed on detached ser-
vice from the US Army and sent there In November 1958. After spending 
approximately a month in the country, he prepared recommendations which were 
generally accepted by the new CINCPAC, Admiral Harry D. Felt, and incorporated 
in a conceptual plan for improving the Lao army, which Felt submitted to the 
Joint Chiefs on 13 December. These proposals included a reorganizations and 
increased staff for the Program Evaluation Office, dispatch of a logistics 
team to inventory Lao military equipment on hand and speed delivery of needed 
items, employment of US mobile training teams, training of Lao officers at 
the Infantry School in the United States, and the dispatch of Army Special 
Forces and psychological warfare teams to work with the Program Evaluation 
Office. The plan was approved by the Program Evaluation Office, Ambassador 
Smith, Lao civil and military officials, and the French Embassy and French 
Military Mission in Vientiane.(190) 
The prospective withdrawal of French forces from Laos also demanded that 
some action be taken to provide added airlift and air-resupply to the Lao 
ground troops, who would otherwise have limited maneuver capabilities. When 
Major General Donald R. Hutchinson, USAF Assistant for Mutual Security, visited 
Laos in October 1958, Ambassador Smith convinced him that strengthening the 
Lao air arm might prove decisive. As its share of the 25,000-man Lao army 
strength, the Lao air force was authorized 721 spaces to man a single com-
posite squadron. Under French tutelage, however, the Lao air force had made 
little progress. In mid-1958 it had 527 persons assigned, including one 
fully qualified pilot, 36 pilot trainees, and 490 ground personnel. Under 
the US MAP, old French aircraft had been removed from Laos, and at mid-1958 
Laos had 6 C-47s, 6 L-19s, and 1 L-20. The L-20 Beaver was the sole 
remaining plane of the four of this type that had been delivered during 1958.

The L-20s were very useful for reconnaissance and lightly-loaded lifts 
into crude airfields, but three out of the four that had been provided 
had been lost in crashes. The Lao L-19s were sometimes used for liaison 
but more frequently were employed in the difficult task of attempting to 
train Lao pilot candidates.(191) Although Lao pilot training had been 
very slow and tedious and some arrangement would have to be provided to 
take care of logistical support of the Lao aircraft, Ambassador Smith 
stated a requirement for two additional C-47s and three L-20s to be 
delivered as soon as possible.(192) 
In the winter of 1958-1959 the French wanted to withdraw from Laos 
and the United States was considering additional military assistance. 
Atidst this background of changing policy, the North Vietnamese moved to 
extend their control into Laos. Between 23-29 December 1958, Hanoi sent 
two companies of regular North Vietnamese troops into Laos, and this 
force dug in at positions near the town of Tchepone in Savannaket province, 
just west of the demarcation line between North and South Vietnam. These 
forces were the first increment of the NVA 70th Battalion, 559th Transporta-
tion Group, which would be fully emplaced in the Lao panhandle by May 1959 
with a responsibility for transporting weapons, ammunition, mail, and 
supplies into South Vietnam. The battalion would also guide infiltrating 
groups southward and bring same sick and wounded men back to North Vietnam. 
(193) At the first deployment of NVA forces into Laos the full implication 
of the North Vietnamese action was not fully apparent, but Premier Phoui 
Sananikone immediately protested the invasion to Hanoi, where Foreign 
Minister Pham Van Dong countered with an accusation that Lao aircraft had 
repeatedly violated North Vietnam's airspace and that Lao troops had made 
incursions into North Vietnamese villages. When Hanoi offered to negotiate 
on the withdrawal of its troops from Laos, Phoui angrily rejected the pro-
posal, believing that the North Vietnamese were attempting to get the 
International Control Commission returned to Laos. In the emergency Phoui 
called the National Assembly into session and obtained on 15 January 1959 
special powers both to govern for a year without recourse to the Assembly 
and to remake his government. In the remodeled Phoui government announced 
on 24 January, CDMI men secured cabinet posts for influential Lao army 
officers, including Colonel Phoumi Nosavan, who became Secretary of State 
for Defense and the strong man in the new government. A relative of 
Thailand's Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, Phoumi had become active in the 
CDNI following his return from a military school in Paris in August 1958. 
In an announcement of new policies at a press conference on 11 February 
1959, Phoui stated that the Lao government considered "the application of 
the Geneva agreements as fully accomplished? and that Laos "as a sovereign, 
independent country could not tolerate interference in her internal affairs.? 
For these reasons he would not accept the Communist position that Laos 
would continue to be bound by the terms of the Geneva agreement until such 
time as a settlement was found in Vietnam. (194)

On 13 January 1959 the US Department of Defense accepted the Heintges-
Felt military assistance recommendations for Laos, and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff proceeded on the assumption that the recommendations would win final 
approval after intergovernmental negotiations in France. As a matter of 
fact, Phoui's announcement that Laos was no longer bound by the Geneva 
agreement provided a legal basis for the introduction of American military 
training into Laos without international negotiations. Within the Program 
Evaluation Office, the United States began to replace key people with active 
duty military personnel in civilian clothing. This number included General 
Heintges who became PEC chief. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Inter-
national Security Agency also accepted the recommendation that Laos would be 
provided with two additional C-Las and three L-20s, and the USAF was 
authorized to get the planes to Laos as soon as possible. At this point 
three hitches developed in the projected Laos assistance program. The US 
State Department issued public denials that US military personnel were in 
Laos and demanded that augmentations of American advisors be kept small. 
In consultations in April the French government considered that the Geneva 
agreement was still binding on Laos and rejected the Heitges-Felt assistance 
plan. Under accords subsequently reached in Paris in May and June 1959, the 
French would continue to have the responsibility for military training in 
Laos, but each French military supervisor would have an American deputy and 
problemsbetween the two authorities would be referred to the Chief of the 
French Military Mission and the Program Evaluation Office. The French would 
continue to be responsible for all Lao tactical training, but they would 
have only nominal supervision over logistical training and support which 
would be taken over by Americans. Under this agreement the United States 
undertook on 23 July to furnish additional technicians (who would wear 
civilian clothing and were expected to be in Laos no more than six months) 
to conduct an emergency training program that would expand the Lao army from 
25,000 to 29,000 men. The combined Franco-American joint training program 
was scheduled to begin on 1 September-1959, with an objective of training 
6,250 Lao active and potential officers and non-commissioned officers in a 
seven-week long course.(195) The proposal to provide Laos with additional 
aircraft also ran into a difficulty arising from the fact that the USAF had 
no excess C-47s in its inventory and raised questions as to whether the MAP 
aircraft should be purchased from commercial sources. The procurement of 
the L-20s was held up by an uncertainty in Washington as to how many of 
these planes were still operational in Laos.(196) 
When Premier Phoui Sananikone announced in February 1959 that the 
Royal Lao Government was no longer bound by the Geneva agreements, Communist 
China began a very strong series of denunciations of the Phoui government. 
In notes to the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, Red China's Fbreign 
Minister Chen Yi demanded immediate action to restore the ICC in Laos. A 
little later, the Peking Foreign Minietry stated that US and Lao authorities 
aimed to drag Laos into SEATO and to turn the country into a military base.

resolved to proceed with the integration of the two battalions of Pathet 
Lao troops that continued to exist after the Vientiane agreement. Each 
battalion numbered about 750 men. One was camped in a valley south of 
Luang Prabang, and the other had been living in an old French cantonment 
on the Plain of Jars. On 17 May the battalion near Luang Prabang accepted 
integration into the Royal Axmy, but on the morning of 19 May the canton-
ment an the Plain of Jars was empty. Lao paratroops were dropped along the 
fugitive battalion's apparent route of flight, but the Pathet Lao troops 
escaped and began to prepare for renewed hostilities. According to Lao 
reports, the Pathet Lao recruited previously demobilized Communist troops 
in June and were further reinforced by several companies of Black Thai 
troops that had been armed and indoctrinated in North Vietnam. On 20 July 
the Pathet Lao seized Muong Son village near Sam Neua, and ten days later 
they moved back into Phong Saly province. On 4 August the Lao government 
proclaimed a state of emergency in its five northern provinces. That same 
day it requested the Secretary General of the United Nations to inform mem-
bers of the situation and charged that North Vietnam was giving support to 
the Pathet Lao guerrillas. (198) 
Occurring during monsoon rains, the renewed Pathet Lao attacks sur-
prised the Lao Army, and the meaning of the Communist operations proved 
difficult to determine both at the time and afterward. In view of the 
outbreak of fighting in Laos, the US State Department expressed concern 
on 1 August that the Communist Pathet Lao and the Communist regimes in 
China and North Vietnam were seeking to promote a serious crisis and to 
obtain concessions contrary to the will of the Royal Lao Government. (199) 
After this initial statement, the United States held firm in its support 
for the Government of Laos, and, as will be seen, increased military 
assistance and also mobilized forces preparatory to an active SEATO under-
taking in the battle area. The Soviet Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, 
charged that Laos had violated the Geneva agreements, the Vientiane agree-
ments of 1956-57, and had "flooded the country with U.S. servicemen." Both 
the Soviet Union and Communist China called for reinstitution of the Laos 
International Control Commission, a proposition which was unacceptable at 
this time to Laos and to the United States.(200) On 8 August Phoui 
Sananikane stated that the Communists were attempting to form "a base from 
which to attack the south and a corridor through which to attack South 
Vietnam."(201) Based upon retrospective observations from Saigon, Ambassador 
Durbrow would also believe that the attacks in Laos were designed to bring 
pressure an the Lao government to prevent its alignment away from the left 
and also to draw attention away from the Vietminh buildup in the Lao pan-
handle and the preparation of the Ho Chi Minh trail routes into South Vietnam. 
(202) On the other hand, US Ambassador Horace Smith would note that General 
Phoumi Nosavan was prone to use the threat of Communism to further his own 
purposes, (203) and W. J. Lederer, coauthor of The Ugly American (a best 
selling novel very hostile to US assistance which was having a large impact 
in the United States) would charge that the 1959 crisis in Laos was pur-
posefully inflated by the Phoui government to reduce the effect of the report

of the House Committee on Government Operations, which had been published 
on 15 June and was very critical of the US military aid program in Laos. (204) 
Although it was difficult to get solid information in Washington about 
the early fighting in remote northeastern Laos, US estimates were that the 
Pathet Lao did not have more than 3,000 troops available and that they 
probably were unable to employ more than 1,000 of these at one time.(205) 
The Pathet Lao, however, were operating in familiar and very favorable 
terrain. Phong Saly was bordered on one side by Communist China and on the 
other by North Vietnam, while Sam Neua was bordered on the north, east, and 
south by North Vietnam. Both provinces were very vulnerable to Communist 
ground thrusts into them. Still, the 3,000 Pathet Lao could hardly be 
expected to stand against superior units of the 25,000-man Lao army, if 
Lao troops in sufficient numbers could be concentrated in the northeastern 
provinces, most feasibly by air transport. In early August the Lao army was 
resolved to hold the town of Sam Neua at all costs, since among other reasons 
its short clay-surfaced airstrip was the only air facility in the province that 
could serve C-47 aircraft. The Lao air arm committed its transports on a 
troop shuttle-between the Plain of Jars and Sam Neua, and to get additional 
airlift, J. C. Skinner, the retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who handled 
air matters in the Vientiane PEO, chartered transport planes and crews from 
Air Laos and Civil Air Transport. At this time nine Lao military pilots 
were qualified to fly C-47s under visual flight conditions, and other Lao 
pilots in training were used as copilots aboard the Lao C-47s. The air-
craft carried soldiers, ammunition, and supplies into the mountain-surrounded, 
rain-soaked airstrip at Sam Neua and evacuated civilians on their return 
trips.(206) 
Under the Franco-American combined training agreement, France was 
pledged to keep 600 regular troops in Laos, half at the training school 
at Seno and half with Laotian military units. By 1 August the initial 
increments of 12 US Army Ranger training teams were positioned in each of 
the four Lao military regions, and on 21 August Washington approved the 
PEO's plan to add 17 US military and 103 Filipino technicians to its staff 
to supervise operations of the Lao military technical services. During 
August Ambassador Smith and Admiral Felt recommended still further expan-
sion in the Program Evaluation Office, but US Under Secretary of State 
Robert Murphy objected to the rapid increase in the number of Americans in 
Laos, from 249 on 15 July 1959 to 494 if all of the new proposals were 
approved. Murphy pointed out that India had been surprisingly cooperative 
in the expanded use of American military personnel in Laos and ought not 
to be embarrassed by being confronted with still more Americans.(207) 
Spurred into action by the airlift crisis in Laos, USAF resolved the long-
delayed commitment of the two additional C-47s and three L-20s to Laos. 
The two C-47s were taken from the PACAV's active inventory; the L-20s were 
increased to five in number and were obtained from the US Army; and the 
planes were delivered in Laos on 8-10 September. (208)

In the last days of August the Lao Army commander at Sam Neua reported 
that two outlying positions were under attack by combined North Vietnamese 
and Pathet Lao forces. Although the commander considered that he could 
repel the Pathet Lao, he did not believe that he could stand against the 
North Vietnamese. President Eisenhower was prepared to participate in a 
SEA:TO intervention in support of Laos, but there were still some unresolved 
questions as to whether North Vietnamese troops were actively engaged in 
the fighting. In discussing the matter on 29 August President Eisenhower 
and British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan agreed that it would be helpful 
if the United Nations would send observers to Laos to reveal the true facts 
of the situation. On 4 September, Laos appealed to Secretary General Dag 
Hammarskjold for assistance of the United Nations against the North Vietnamese 
aggression, and on 8 September the United Nations Security Council voted to 
send an observation mission to Laos. When this was announced, the Lao Army 
reported that the Communists promptly ceased attacks around Sam Neua and 
hastily withdrew. After arriving in Vientiane On 15 September, the UN 
investigating subcommittee viewed documentary evidence for two weeks before 
visiting the battle area. In its report on 3 November, the subcommittee 
stated that evidence presented to it by the Royal Lao Government indicated 
that military activity in Laos had been undertaken by Pathet Lao and North 
Vietnamese regular army units. On the other hand, the subcommittee was 
unable to secure testimony from the Pathet Lao or the Democratic Republic 
of Vietnam. US Secretary of State Christian Herter endorsed the report, 
since he considered that it revealed that: "Pathet Lao or enemy groups 
. . . had received their supplies, equipment, logistical assistance, and 
the help of political cadres, from across the border."(209) 
At the time of the apparent crisis at Sam Neua, USAF Chief of Staff 
General Thomas D. 'White recommended that the United States should establish 
a full-scale MAAG in Vientiane and take over Lao military training. The 
Joint Chiefs substantially accepted White's recommendations on 4 September, 
and on 20 September Ambassador Smith also recommended that a full-scale US 
MAAG be established, though as an operational segment of the US Operations 
Mission and with the PEO designation. Once again, Under Secretary Murphy 
opposed any additional expansion of US military advisors, and in fact 
recommended that the United States cut its staff rather than increase it. 
(210) As a result of the American decision to continue to respect the 
Geneva agreements in regard to Laos, the combined US-French training pro-
gram instituted on 1 September remained heavily dependent upon French 
participation. This program included the twin objectives of preparing 
the Lao armed forces both for conventional field operations and for counter-
insurgency work. Accomplishment of the counterinsurgency task involved 
turning out 600 six-man military psychological warfare teams, each of which 
would be able to go into a remote area and demonstrate positive govern-
mental betterment programs to the people. Because of the Sam Neua crisis, 
the joint training program was slow to receive cadres from the Lao army for 
training. The first psychological warfare teams did not complete their 
courses until December 1959, and only about 328 of these teams would be 
trained.(211) As a result of increased US MAP support levels, the Lao

army would be increased to 29,000 men, organized into 24 infantry, 1 
artillery, 2 parachute, and 1 armored cavalry battalions. Augmentation 
forces included 2,900 national police and 20,000 "Auto Defense" or militia 
forces.(212) 
The potential of aviation for the support of military operations in 
Laos was well demonstrated in the autumn of 1959. Even though it was only 
a rudimentary force, Jake Skinner considered that the Lao air force per-
formed well in the air transport function. In October the total airlift 
requirement in Laos was about 700 flying hours, and with eight C-47s and 
six L-20s the Lao airmen flew more than 530 hours of cargo pay time. 
Skinner also pointed out that a few armed aircraft would have been invalu-
able for interdiction and close support, and he suggested that the Lao 
airmen needed and could operate up to six armed T-28 aircraft in tactical 
support of ground operations. In line with this reasoning, three T-28s 
were programmed for delivery to Laos under the fiscal 1961 MAP, but, as 
will be seen, the delivery of these planes would be overtaken by events. 
Helicopters would also have definite utility in Laos both for logistical 
support and for the deployment of the psychological warfare teams to 
remote operating locations. Four SH-19 helicopters were available from 
a MAP commitment to Indonesia that had been cancelled, but it would be 
impossible to prepare the Lao air force to operate or maintain these air-
craft without great delay. When the French were unable to assume respon-
sibility for the helicopter project, the Air Materiel Force Pacific Area 
bailed the four H-19s to Air America, Inc., the newly incorporated local 
off-shoot of Civil Air Transport, and in the early spring of 1960 Air 
America would begin to operate and maintain the helicopters under a MAP-
financed agreement with the Government of Laos, monitored by the PEO.(213) 
The Lao air MAP projections, like the planned expansion of the Lao army, 
was heavily dependent upon French participation. The French Military 
Mission assisted with air operations and planning, conducted flight train-
ing, and either supervised or performed most of the air maintenance. (214) 
The story of developing US military assistance programming in Cambodia 
remained fraught with local political considerations rather than manifesta-
tions of avert Communist aggression. Although Cambodia had requested and 
had begun to receive American military and economic assistance in 1955, the 
country was described as "frantically neutralist" and often appeared more 
pro-Communist than pro-Western. The political complexities, which so 
greatly complicated American aid programs in Cambodia, were largely produced 
by the one-man rule of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. He had become king in 1941, 
but in March 1955 he abdicated in favor of his father and promptly organized 
a political party, which won all National Assembly seats in September 1955 
and returned Sihanouk to power as premier and foreign minister. Interspersed 
with frequent resignations and returns to power, Sihanouk would be in and out 
of the premier's office until 1960 when, at his father's death, he would 
accept a title of Head of State.(215)

At the same time that Sihanouk was willing to accept American 
assistance, he was equally solicitous of aid from the Soviet Union and 
Communist China. A Cambodian-Red Chinese aid agreement signed on 21 
June 1956 pledged both nations to observe mutual coexistence and pro-
vided that Red Chinese economic assistance be offered without conditions. 
The Soviet Union also gave Cambodia a 500-bed hospital. After alleging 
that South Vietnamese troops had invaded Cambodia some 19 times in 1957-58, 
Cambodia signed a trade agreement with North Vietnam on 19 November 1958.(216) 
In explanation why the United States was willing to provide military 
assistance to Cambodia, Assistant Secretary of State Robertson stated in 
1959: "'We are supporting the Cambodian Army because the alternative of 
our support is to have the Cambodian Army supported by the Chinese Com-
munists."(217) Other than this, the US MAP expectation was that the 
Cambodian military forces would be capable of maintaining internal security 
in populated areas and along communications routes within the country. (218) 
The US MAP authorization for Cambodia did not change from the initially 
authorized 31,000 armed force personnel, including an 1,100-man Navy and a 
950-man air force. At the end of 1959, the Cambodian air force consisted of 
28 MAP-supported aircraft and 20 non-MAP planes, the MAP aircraft being 5 
c-47s, lo L-19s, 12 LT-6Gs, and 1 LT-20. Since the French handled all air 
operations and training, the Air Force Section, MAAG-Cambodia, consisted of 
only one officer and one airman, who provided technical advice.(219) 
Because Cambodia obviously could not be relied upon in any emergency, 
the Pacific Air Force followed a policy that MAP support for the Cambodian 
air force should be a token aid to maintain Cambodia as a possibly friendly 
neutral. (220) This policy held good until mid-1960, when Prince Sihanouk, 
shortly after taking over as Chief of State an 13 June, denounced American 
aid programs and declared that if they were not changed he would ask the 
Communist bloc for aircraft and arms. At this juncture and in the months 
that followed, USAF insisted that there was no valid military reason for 
providing sophisticated combat aircraft to Cambodia. In a visit to the 
United States in November 1960, however, the Cambodian Minister of Defense 
Major General Lon Nol again proposed requirements for military aid, 
including jet aircraft. Once again, neither CINOPAC nor USAF recommended 
providing Cambodia with jets, even in token numbers, but as a gesture of 
favor to Sihanouk on 27 April 1961 a joint State/Defense message directed 
that four T-37 jet planes would be delivered to Phnom Penh to be available 
for a fly-by an Cambodian Independence Day -- 9 November. The aircraft 
were delivered at considerable cost by special airlift, but the expedited 
action had little significance since the Cambodians did not fly tne new 
planes for several weeks after their arrival.(221)

Command but as a subordinate to the Far East Air Forces on purely Air 
Force matters, was a useful but hopefully temporary measure designed to 
mitigate the existing US Unified Command Plan which divided the Pacific-
Far East between the US Pacific Command and the United Nations Command/ 
Far East Command. To the Air Force this arrangement violated two basic 
principles -- unity of command and economy of force. Because Air Force 
units were assigned to the Far East Air Forces, Commander FEAF was com-
mitted to provide forces to satisfy the contingency plans made by CINC 
UNC/FEC for operations in Northern Asia and by CINCPAC for operations in 
Southeast Asia. With only limited air resources available, the Far East 
Air Forces would not have been able to satisfy both theater commanders if 
the Chinese Communists had commenced simultaneous aggression both to the 
north and the south.(222) 
At the same time that the Pacific-Far East was divided between two 
unified commands, Admiral Felix Stump implemented a PACOM organization 
that established additional "subordinate unified commands," including the 
Taiwan Defense Command, the Philippines Command, Marianas-Bonins Defense 
Command, and the Hawaiian Defense Command. In August 1954, shortly after 
taking command of the Pacific Air Force, Major General Sory Smith 
approached Admiral Stump to protest that the divided PACOM structure 
would paralyze the employment of airpower since the theater air commander's 
forces were being partitioned out to subordinate unified commanders who 
would use them for defense of local pieces of real estate. General Smith 
urged that the theater air commander should be responsible for all air 
operations in the theater in order that the available air force units 
would be used in their most effective role regardless of their location. 
Admiral Stump had some sympathy for Smith's point, but he would not modify 
the PACOM organization because he said that the Pacific Command's area was 
so vast that overall direction must be on the spot and that a unified com-
mand could not be exercised from Hawaii over forces located as far away as 
the Philippines and the Marianas. Stump also stated that division of res-
ponsibility by command, exercised through component commanders, had led to 
disaster at Pearl Harbor in 1941. He insisted that a single commander in 
each area be responsible for all military operations in the area.(223) 
In a major Air Force policy action on 6 May 1955, the Air Council in 
Washington approved a study which concluded that air operations in the 
Pacific-Far East required centralized direction and control, that deploy-
ment of air units in depth with dispersed forward operating bases would 
be required in order to reduce vulnerability, and that preparations should 
be made for the employment of cellular components of air units (possibly as 
small as a single nuclear-capable air vehicle) from forward bases. (22L) 
In line with this decision, General Laurence S. Kuter, who took command of 
the Far East Air Forces on 4 June 1955, was opposed to the divided unified 
command structure in the Far East-Pacific and to the further segmentation 
manifest in the PACOM subordinate unified commands. "The operation of 
aircraft," he stated, "should not be confined to arbitrary geographic

boundaries nor should they be placed under the operational control of a 
commander during wartime who has had no previous opportunity to develop 
experience in training, equipping, and operating Air Force units. By 
virtue of the system of subordinate unified commands, air strength is 
dissipated and confined within relatively small geographic areas. Further 
the air units so dissipated are placed under the operational control of a 
component commander with a limited objective."(225) 
With much the same reasoning that he opposed compartmentation of 
tactical air resources, General Kuter was favorable to USAF Air Materiel 
Command proposal to centralize global air logistics management under its 
jurisdiction, even though such a reorganization would divest the Far East 
Air Forces of its command authority over its subordinate Far East Logistics 
Force. "To continue to partition our logistic support system," Kuter 
believed, "is just as wasteful and dangerous as to partition our air power." 
After a period of study, the Far East Air Logistics Force was transferred 
from FEAF to the command jurisdiction of the Air Materiel Command effective 
on 1 October 1955 and redesignated as the Air Materiel Force Pacific Area 
(AMFPA). As a result of internal reorganization during the several following 
months, AMFPA assigned its Japan-based Northern Air Materiel Area Pacific 
(NAMAP) area support and technical assistance responsibilities for Japan and 
Korea, while the Southern Air Materiel Area Pacific (SAMAP) located at Clark 
Air Base received similar responsibilities for Okinawa, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Guam. (226) 
During 1954 the Pacific Air Force had some degree of success in 
indoctrinating planning officers at PACO'S with the Air Force position that 
forces ought not to be permanently assigned to subordinate unified commands.  
menu. ar in ? existing INCPAC planning or e ?e ense o 
Taiwan was tested when Red Chinese threats forced the evacuation of the off-
shore Tachen Islands. CINCPAC's plans comprehended US activity during three 
phases: Phase I, comprising Chinese Nationalist patrols, reconnaissance, 
and training; Phase II, military operations necessary to defeat Communist 
forces in the event of actual attack or invasion of Taiwan or the 
Pescadores Islands; and Phase III, expanded air operations against the 
Chinese mainland if directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In Phase II, 
Vice Admiral 1. M. Pride, Commander US Seventh Fleet, was authorized to 
establish the US Taiwan Defense Command with authority over Air Force (CTP 
78) and Navy components (CTF 72 and UTY 77). On 25 January, Brigadier 
General Harold W. Grant established a Headquarters Air Task Force Fifth 
(Provisional) at Taipei. According to plan, this air task force should 
have been under the operational control of Admiral Pride, but instead 
Admiral Stump agreed to place COMATF5 under the operational control of 
COMPACAF during the emergency. Working with the Chinese Nationalist Joint 
Operations Center, the air task force provided air cover over Taiwan and 
the vessels used to evacuate the Tachen Islands. (228)

As it happened during the Tachen crisis, the conduct of air operations 
was divided between CINCPAC's air and naval component commanders as well as, 
the subordinate mlified commander, and to alleviate this in the future the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff ruled that full responsibility for Taiwan defense 
would be placed under the Taiwan defense commander.(229) It was also evi-
dent that the US Taiwan defense organization would need to be a joint head-
quarters rather than arradled designation for the Commander of the Seventh 
Fleet. In Hawaii, General Smith recommended that a Taiwan defense command 
should be established as a joint headquarters, with an Air Force officer to 
serve as its deputy commander. This proposal was backed by usa and FEU 
and was approved by Admiral Stump in April 1955. In order to provide the 
Pacific Air Force with personnel to handle duties in Taiwan, as well as . 
elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the Thirteenth Air Force, with headquarters at 
Clark Air Base in the Philippines was transferred to PACAF effective on 1 
June 1955. For psychological reasons, the new US organization at Taipei was 
initially named the Formosa (Taiwan) Liaison Center (US) but it provided a 
joint staff to Admiral Pride. AE of 24 June 1955, the USAF component was 
passed to Thirteenth Air Force command and designated Air Task Force-13 
(Provisional). Under command of Brigadier General Benjamin 0. Davis, Jr., 
ATF-13 would be subordinate to the Thirteenth Air Force in Phase I opera-
tions. In Phase II, General Davis would be controlled by COMTAIWANDEFCOM(US) 
and would become his air component commander (CTF-78). Early in 1956, 
Admiral Stump regularized these agreements in a comprehensive directive. 
This provided that the senior naval officer in the Taiwan area would be 
the Taiwan Defense Commander as well as the Navy service component commander. 
The Chief US MAAG-Taiwan, an Army general officer, would retain responsibilities 
for MDAP materiel and training and would function as TAIWANDEFCOM Army com-
ponent commander. The Commander ATF-13 would be the Air Force service com-
ponent commander and he would also support the Chief MAAG-Taiwan in 
training the Chinese Nationalist Air Fbrce.(230) 
Generals Kuter and Smith agreed to Admiral Stump's regularized plan 
for the US Taiwan Defense Command largely because Stump assured Smith 
verbally an 31 January 1955 that Taiwan was a special situation and that 
ATF-13's subordination to Thirteenth Air Force and to the Commanders of 
FEAF and PACAF would not be affected.(231) In this same month, however, 
CINCPAC began to use the Taiwan Defense Oommander as a model for other con-
tingency planning in Southeast Asia. In the case of Laos, the CINCPAC 
operations plan called for commitment of six lir Force tactical squadrons 
to an operation in support of Royal Lao forces. If this plan were approved, 
General Kuter assumed that it would be shortly followed by other similar 
plans for the defense of Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand that would contain 
additional camnitments of air units and would amount to a "further 
emasculation of air power." Kuter urged that the Southeast Asia area 
ought to be treated "as a whole, rather than as several smaller problems 
with limited objectives." Air Force planners posed Kuter's objections 
when the plan came before the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it was withdrawn 
from consideration without action.(232) Subsequent to guidance provided

by President Eisenhower and the National Security Council, however, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff on 11 July 1956 directed CINCPAC to prepare a special 
contingency plan for US participation in the event of North Vietnamese 
aggression in Vietnam. As prepared in Hawaii, CINCPAC Operations Plan 
46-56 again used the Taiwan model. It provided that a US Vietnam Defense 
Command would be established and that the Fifth Air Force would pass opera-
tional control of air defense and supporting forces earmarked for service 
in Vietnam to the Commander, Vietnam Defense Command. Commander PACAF would 
designate a senior USAF officer to serve as air component commander of the 
Vietnam Defense Command and also provide appropriate personnel to serve on 
the joint staff of the Vietnam Defense Commander. This was accepted by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff.(233) 
In the same period that the Pacific air commanders were unable to pre-
vent the proliferation of subordinate unified commands, they got acceptance 
of only a portion of their thinking in regard to the consolidation of the 
US unified commands in the Pacific-Far East. In the spring of 1955, US 
Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
that the worldwide unified command structure was too large, unwieldy, and 
overly expensive in manpower and money. He directed the Joint Chiefs to 
study simplification, reduction, and consolidation of commands, and they 
in turn directed similar studies by unified and specified commands. As he 
was requested to do, General Kuter on 11 July 1955 gave the CINCFB a very 
comprehensive study which called attention to the major problems stemming 
fram the existence of two unified commands in the Pacific and recommended 
that a single unified command be established. He also provided a copy of 
the study to the Chief of Staff, USAF, and General Smith brought a copy to 
the attention of CINCPAC. In their final report to the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, both Unified Commanders stated that the idea of a single unified 
command had some merit but neither specifically recommended it.(234) 
When the US Unified Command Plan came under discussion in the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff early in 1956, the Chairman, Air Force Chief of Staff, 
Chief of Naval Operations, and Commandant US Marine Corps recommended that 
the Far East Command be disestablished and that the Pacific Command remain 
as the single US unified command in the Pacific-Far East: This majority 
recommendation was approved by Secretary Wilson on 27 June 1956 for more 
detailed study and implementation. In elaboration of his plan of the 
preceding year, General Kuter recommended an 5 August 1956 that the Pacific 
Command should consist of two categories of subordinate commands: principal 
component commands (namely US Army Pacific, US Navy Pacific, and US Air 
Force Pacific) and four subordinate joint commands (Hawaiian Command, 
Southern Pacific Command, Northern Pacific Command, and Marianas-Bonins 
Command). He conceived that all forces allocated to CINCPAC would be 
assigned to the principal component commands and retained under the 
operational control of the service component commanders in peace and in 
war. Under conditions of local war, operational control of joint forces

could be assumed by a CINCPAC designated task force commander who would 
be selected from the service component predominantly involved. Thus, the 
Taiwan Defense Command should be disestablished and replaced by a Joint 
Task Force Taiwan. The subordinate joint commands would not have combat 
responsibilities but would support the US Ambassadors and MAAGs in their 
areas, coordinate administrative and logistical activities in their areas, 
and perform other required non-combat obligations. While Kuter assumed 
that the CINC United Nations Command would be preserved in Korea because 
of the armistice arrangements, he insisted that the CINC Air Force Pacific 
should have complete responsibility for air defense throughout both the 
CINCPAC and CINCUNC areas.(235) In Hawaii, General Smith touched upon 
another aspect of PACOM-PACAF relationship on 6 August 1956 when he requested 
permission to provide representation at SEATO military meetings, specifically 
a forthcoming ad hoc intelligence meeting that would discuss the Communist 
air threat to Me SEATO area.(236) 
In response to General Smith's request for authority to send Pacific 
Air Force representatives to SEATO military conferences, Vice Admiral George 
Anderson, PACOM Chief of Staff, informed Smith on 22 August: "CINCPAC 
is charged with the responsibility of acting as the United States Military 
Advisor for SEATO. It is the policy, of this headquarters to utilize CINCPAC 
staff members as representatives at SEATO meetings, except When technical 
assistance is required from the components. This policy, in part, is based 
upon CINCPAC's desire to arrive at SEATO meetings with a United States posi-
tion. In arriving at the United States position, the views of the component 
commanders will be appreciated and utilized in preparing this US position. 
. . . On this basis, CINCPAC must continue to furnish the US representatives 
and provide them with the best obtainable information prior to their 
attendance at such meetings:" Although the CMCPAC response was negative, 
it had one favorable aspect in that it stated that the PACOM components 
would participate in the preparation for SEATO conferences, an opportunity 
which had not previously been afforded to the Pacific Air Force.(237) 
In the inter-command negotiations that took place between Admiral 
Stump and General Lyman L. Lemnitzer, CINC Far East Cumilaand, from 30 
September to 5 October 1956, neither General Kuter nor General Smith was 
allowed to be present and each was Instructed not to discuss command 
amalgamation plans with USAF.(238) Admiral Anderson would later reveal 
that Stump and Lemnitzer had discussed one form of command organization 
which was vaguely similar to General Kuter 's recommendation. This would 
have established a subordinate command structure that would have included 
a Northwest Pacific area and a Southwest Pacific area, with subordinate 
commanders, joint staffs, and assigned units. Anderson said that this 
structure was not accepted because Stump and Lemnitzer felt that it would 
not be economical in terms of personnel requirements and because it would 
parcel out the command of operational forces. Instead of this alternative, 
CINCFE and CINCPAC recommended a plan to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 5 
October that would recognize the three component commanders -- the Pacific

Fleet, the Pacific Air Forces, and the US Army Pacific -- as the principal 
subordinate PACOM commands with responsibility for the administration, 
training, logistics support, and operation of assigned type forces. The 
recommendations also included the retention of all existing subordinate 
unified commands including two additional ones to be established in the 
northwestern Pacific. (239) 
When the Stump-Lemnitzer plan was submitted to the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff on 5 October 1956, Air Force studies indicated that it fell short 
of meeting the basic guidance that had been provided by Secretary Wilson 
and Admiral Radford. In preparation for the transfer of the Pacific Air 
component command from Tokyo to Hawaii, Headquarters, Pacific Air Force, 
was redesignated on 1 July 1956 as Headquarters, Pacific Air Force/Far 
East Air Forces (Rear) under Major General Sory Smith, and on 10 September, 
as studies were proceeding on the Stump-Lemnitzer plan in Washington, 
General Smith released a file of PACAF/FEAF (Rear) consolidated policy 
statements in order to insure that Air Force command problems were resolved 
in consonance with policies that he and General Kuter laid down. These 
statements reminded air officers that all USAF forces in the Pacific (other 
than JCS-exempt strategic forces) should be assigned to a single air com-
mander rather than to a local area commander; that PACAF/FEAF (Rear) was 
opposed to parcelling out air forces and that, in any event, the command 
and control of air forces should be vested in an air force component com-
mander at any level of command; that effective utilization of SEATO air 
forces would need to be based upon centralized control, coordination of 
effort, mobility, and flexibility; and that, despite the existence of the 
US TAIWANDEFCOM, it was the PACAF/FEAF (Rear) policy to urge that any USAF 
forces allocated for the defense of Taiwan and deployed to Taiwan be 
under the operational control of the Air Force component commander of a 
joint task force organizational structure.(240) 
In Joint Chiefs actions In Washington, the Chief of Staff USAF sub-
mitted comments on the Felt-Lemnitzer proposals on 5 November 1956 together 
with an alternate draft plan which reduced the number of subordinate unified 
commands for the Pacific. The Army and Navy comments submitted on 26 
November and 17 December generally approved the Felt-Lemnitzer plan. After 
additional review, the Joint Chiefs of Staff resolved divergencies and 
recanmended a final reorganization plan to Secretary Wilson an 28 December 
1956.(241) On 20 June 1957, CINCPAC issued an instruction defining the 
tasks and responsibilities of the command, and, on 1 July 1957, CINCPAC 
assumed responsibility for the entire Pacific-Far East area, with his 
headquarters and joint staff opening at Camp Smith, Hawaii. Also on 1 
July, Headquarters, Far East Air Forces completed its movement from FUchu 
Air Station, Japan to Hickam AFB, Hawaii, and on this date this old head-
quarters was redesignated Headoparters, Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and 
Headquarters, PICAF/FEAF (Rear) was disestablished.(242)

As defined in the CINCPAC instruction, the US Pacific Command was 
the single US unified command in the Pacific-Far East, directly respon-
sible to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with the US Navy to serve as the JCS 
executive for PACOM. The three major component cammands-were the US Army ? 
Pacific, the US Pacific Fleet, and the Pacific Air Forces. These commands 
were expected to perform functions previously outlined in preliminary plan-
ning, but CINCPAC additionally stipulated that both CINCPACKT and 
CINCPACAF would perform assigned offensive air tasks on a mutually-supporting 
basis. The new organization included three subordinate unified commands. In 
Japan, Commander US Forces Japan would be an additional responsibility of the 
Commander, Fifth Air Force, who would be jointly staffed to execute authorita-
tive coordination over US Forces but would not have either offensive or defen-
sive operational responsibilities. In Korea, Commander US Forces Korea would 
be an additional responsibility of the Commanding General, US Eighth Army, 
who after a year's transition would also serve as CINC United Nations Command. 
The Taiwan Defense Command continued to be a different type of subordinate 
unified command, since COMTAIWANDEFCOM was charged with planning to assist 
the Chinese defense and had a joint staff and in-being service components, 
the latter to remain under operational command and control of their parent 
service organization in Phase I operations but to COMB under the operational 
control of the COMTAIWANDEFCOM in Phase II operations. The US MAAGs and 
JUSMAAGs were militarily responsible directly to CINCPAC and thence to the 
Department of Defense with the Navy as executive agent. In the Philippines, 
the Ryukyus, and in the Marianas-Bonin Islands, CINCPAC appointed CINCPAC 
representatives who would personally represent him in administrative, 
logistic, and political matters. The CINCPAC representatives were charged 
with coordinating joint matters between the services and reporting resolved 
issues to CINCPAC. In countries where there were no US operating forces, 
the Chief of the MAAG or JUSMAAG wonld act as the CINCPAC representative.(243) 
Looking back in short retrospect, General Kuter hailed the establishment 
of the Pacific Air Forces as the attainment of a long-sought objective of the 
? United States Air Force. "For the first time in its history," Kuter wrote, 
"all USAF fighting forces assigned to the Pacific and the Far East areas were 
consolidated under a single commander in the field."(244) As the PACOM 
reorganization went into effect, however, the future of the US Taiwan Defense 
Command remained to be determined since Admiral Stump's instruction of 20 
June 1957 required a study to determine how the command structure on Taiwan 
could be consolidated. As they existed, the Taiwan Defense Command, the US 
MAAG-Taiwan, and Air Task Force-13 provided three chains of command concerned 
with the coordination of US and Chinese military air training and operational 
measures. In Washington, Air Force and Army planners would have preferred to 
have eliminated the Taiwan Defense Command and to have consolidated all mili-
tary activities on Taiwan under a Chief, MAAG, who would have been an Army 
lieutenant general, but ',Admiral Stump considered this arrangement impracticable 
and politically infeasible since it might imply a decline of US interest in 
Taiwan. As an alternate and preferable solution, COMTAIWANDEFCOM proposed to 
make a combination of the Taiwan Defense Command, the MAAG, and ATF-13. The

Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the plan on 31 January 1958, and an 14 
March 1958 the headquarters of the Taiwan Defense Command and the MAAG 
were consolidated and designated as the US Taiwan Defense Command and 
Military Advisory Group. The Commander of the Taiwan Defense Command was 
designated as commander of the new command, and the Chief MAAG became its 
deputy commander. In a further adjustment effected on 1 April 1958 when 
Major General Fred M. Dean assumed command of ATF-13, Dean would continue 
to exercise operational control of all USAF units assigned or deployed to 
Taiwan, but he was additionally designated as Chief, Air Force Section, 
US Taiwan Defense Command and Military Advisory Group. This change com-
bined the advisory functions of the Air Force Section and the operational 
control functions of ATF-13 into a single channel while retaining the 
separate functions of the two groups.(245) This organizational model 
would be subsequently used in Southeast Asia, and, when it was completed, 
an Air Force review of the PACOM reorganization concluded that the 
organizational structure and mission responsibilities in the Pacific were 
sound and adequate, with the single exception that the assignment of 
offensive air tasks to both CINCPACAF and CINCPACFLT was "questionable 
from the Air Force point of view. "(2L6) 
Under the diplomacy of the Eisenhower-Dulles administration as early 
as 1953-54, a major objective of the US Mutual Defense Assistance Program 
was to build the internal strength of Free World nations in order that 
they would be able to participate in a collective defense effort against 
a monolithic Sino-Soviet Communist threat. In an address on US policy 
toward Communist China an 28 June 1957, Secretary Dulles stated that 
Communism in China was "a passing and not a perpetual phase" and that the 
United States ought to do all that it could "to contribute to that passing." 
(247) In a dialogue before a Congressional committee on 12 June 1958, 
Assistant Secretary of State Walter S. Robertson argued the US policy of 
isolating Communist China and making the Chinese Communists dependent upon 
the Soviet Union had been "one of the greatest factors in maintaining the 
peace in Asia." He explained his reasoning by saying: "For instance, 
the Chinese Reds cannot engage in a major war in Asia unless they get a 
green light from Russia. And Russia has to be sure that the situation 
in Europe, in the Middle East, and in other areas where they have res-
ponsibilities is such that they can commit themselves to supplying China 
in a major war in Asia. In my humble opinion, the greatest factor for 
peace and the safety of the free world is to keep the Chinese Communist 
economically and militarily dependent upon the Russians. To the extent 
they become independent, you double their combined capacity for aggressions 
against the free world."(248) 
Even though the US objective visualized that mutual defense assistance 
would enable recipient East Asian nations to resist internal and external 
Communist threats and participate in collective free world security efforts, 
the organization for managing MAP aid that emerged in 1954-1955 was not .

conducive to the establishment of a common collective defense posture. 
The US Far East Command remained responsible for developing military 
forces in Japan and the Republic of Korea to the level of the MDAP force 
objectives established by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. In developing 
the type forces for Japan and the Republic of Korea, the Far East Command 
had made good use of its component commands. Thus the Japanese and ROK 
air forces were built up under guidance provided by the Far East Air Forces 
and in close association with the Fifth Air Force.(249) According to Joint 
Chiefs of Staff decisions in early January 1954 (which were further imple-
mented during the year) the US Pacific Command was given the regional MDAP 
responsibility for Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia. Under the unified command arrangement already outlined, the Far 
East Air Forces was the superior authority to PACOM's Pacific Air Force as 
far as purely Air Force matters were concerned; in addition, the Far East 
Air Forces was the superior headquarters to the Far East Air Logistics 
Force which was responsible for providing through its 6410th Materiel 
Group (DAP) the air logistical support required by air MAP components in 
all of the recipient countries in Fast Asia. (250) 
-Although Admiral Stump as CINCPAC possessed regional MDAP planning, 
review, and implementation responsibilities for Southeast Asia, the initial 
country MDA programs were devised by Washington emissaries and, as has been 
seen, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff felt themselves unable on the basis of 
their military judgment to specify initial force objectives for Vietnam and 
any force objectives at all for Laos and Cambodia.(251) From the point of 
view of PACOM, military aid programs in Southeast Asia would remain polit-
ically complex. "It seems in many respects," commented Vice Admiral 
Anderson, PACOM Chief of Staff, "that every time we propose something which 
will improve our military posture we run into the traditional response of 
our friends in the State Department: You can't do that, we have an election 
coming up!"(252) 
Initially issued on 26 March 1954 and revised on 14 July 1955, Depart-
ment of Defense Directive 5132.3 established the Secretary of Defense as 
the authority within the Department of Defense for developtent and imple-
mentation of the military assistance program. It also provided that CINCPAC 
and other unified commanders would be in the direct military channel of com-
mand over the MAAGs and JUSMAAGs in their commands. By interpretation Army, 
Navy, and Air Force personnel assigned to MAAGs and JUSMAAGs were not con-
sidered to be "allocated to CINCPAC" and the service elements of these groups 
were regarded as being under command of CINCPAC rather than of the PACOM 
component commanders. In order to handle his MAP responsibilities, Admiral 
Stump integrated the functions into PACOM's J-Staff with the single exception 
that within the J-4 Joint Logistics Division a small Foreign Aid Branch, 
consisting of seven officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, was assigned 
to administer the logistics portion of the military assistance program. By 
the basic CINCPAC directive on MAP, MAAG chiefs were allowed to communicate

directly with the military departments, the component commanders, or 
other service agencies only on technical and other matters concerned 
solely with service military assistance such as equipment nomenclature, 
pricing, and financial procedures. On 20 February 19551 however, OINCPAC 
stated that he would require the continuing advice and assistance from 
his component commanders regarding MAP matters and that the component com-
mands would maintain continuing studies, participate in field trips, and 
maintain close liaision with the CINCPAC joint staff.(253) 
While Admiral Stump was organizing a highly-centralized MAP organiza-
tion early in 1955, the Far East Air Forces in Tokyo was operating on a 
belief that there should be only one Air Force position in the Pacific and 
that all airmen should contribute to the achievement of the common objec-
tive. Thus in February 19553 General Partridge held two conferences of 
air attaches and MAAG-air representatives from all the East Asian nations 
to discuss mutual plans and problems.(254) Looking toward a nuclear strategy, 
the Air Council's approval of a proposed Air Force composition in the Pacific 
in 1960 recognized the need for a great many dispersed airfields, and as 
General Kuter pointed out in his study of the Pacific Command organization 
on 11 July 1955 allied air units would become increasingly important to the 
defense against Communist aggression in the Far East. According to schedules, 
there would be 74 MDAP air squadrons in the Pacific and only 46 USAF squadrons 
by 1958, and Kuter urged that FEAF -- as the major USAF component in the 
Pacific -- must be recognized as the agency charged with developing and 
integrating mnAP air forces throughout the Western Pacific.(255) 
As far as USAF was concerned, the Far East Air Forces did have uni-
lateral responsibilities in the Pacific, but, in Hawaii, Admiral Stump was 
described as a man who was "exceedingly, if not unduly sensitive an the 
subject of command prerogatives."(256) In February 1955 Stump reminded 
General Smith that CINCFAC was primarily responsible for Southeast Asian 
MAP. He also directed General Smith and the other PACOM component com-
manders to review the status of MAP-supported units to insure that they 
were developing in a manner compatible with US military and political 
objectives and would complement and enhance US strategic plans.(275) 
During the time that the Far East Air Logistics Force had been in the 
FEAF command jurisdiction, the Far East Air Forces had possessed a major 
logistical control over MAP air activities throughout East Asia, but the 
transfer of the materiel function to the Air Materiel Command and the 
establishment of the Air Materiel Force Pacific Area an 1 October 1955 
removed FEAF's MAP air responsibilities for countries in CINCPAC's area of 
responsibility. Despite this changed circumstance, the Far East Air Force 
obtained approval from USAF and held another East Asian air attache con-
ference on 17-22 October 1955. At least a part of the air attaches felt 
that they were far separated from the mainstream of Air Force thinking and 
had benefited by being brought up to date on the Air Force and FEAF "party 
lines."(258) In November 1955, when FEAF proposed to hold another meeting

of MAAG-air representatives from all of the East Asian nations in Tokyo, 
the CINCPAC staff objected strongly to the reference in the invitational 
message which referred to "FEAF's unilateral responsibilities" in PACOM's 
area of the Far East. Some members of the CINCPAC staff stated that this 
was "an apparent attempt by FEAF to indoctrinate the Chiefs of the Air 
Force Sections with FEAF philosophy and concepts."(259) Air Force Section, 
MAAG, meetings would continue to be held in the Far East, but they would 
be conducted at periodic intervals under the logistical support aegis of 
the Air Materiel Force Pacific Area. Held in Japan and the Philippines, 
these AMFPA MAAG conferences would be generally limited to logistical 
problems, and they would include USAF and CINCPAC representatives. 
In his role as advisor to Admiral Stump an MAP progress, General 
Smith sent a team of PACAF staff officers headed by Colonel W. F. Bond 
to Southeast Asia in November and December 1955. The team was not able 
to get transportation into Laos and Cambodia, but in the other countries 
it found that the MAAGs were dominated by the Army and functioned as Army 
organizations. In each country, the MAAG chiefs, deputy chiefs, and 
chiefs of staff were Army officers, and especially in the Philippines and 
in Vietnam the air sections were described as "relegated to a minor role 
and treated as junior partners." The team reported that the air sections 
did not have access to pertinent war plans, did not and were not expected 
to coordinate or consult with other MAAG-air sections in neighboring 
countries, and that there was in general "a deplorable lack of definite 
relationship between the MDAP supported country air forces and objectives 
of the US strategic operational concept."(260) 
Working together in the Air Force proposals, Generals Kuter and Smith 
undertook to improve the air organization for insuring that MAP air forces 
would develop in a manner consistent,- 4iLdi an overall strategy. Kuter had 
observed that the Japanese and Korean air forces had been closely associated 
with the Fifth Air Force and had made- excellent progress. Toward this same 
end on 17 February 1956, General Smith charged the Thirteenth 21r Force to 
monitor and review MDAP air activities throughout Southeast Asia, with a 
view toward insuring that the development of country air forces would be 
consistent with US strategic plans and that air facilities would be developed 
to implement such plans.(261) On 2 March 1956, General Smith submitted a 
basic concept for Air MAP to CINCFE which proposed that country air forces 
in Southeast Asia be developed only to a capability necessary to combat 
guerrilla-type hostilities, to maintain internal order, and to provide a 
dhow of force in conjunction with other Free World air units and that the 
development of the country air forces should be handled in such a manner 
as to provide a basic environment in terms of air bases, navigational aids, 
and logistic facilities that would be required if USAF units were employed 
to meet aggression in Southeast Asia. In order to bring about the develop-
ment of improved air bases, navigational facilities, and basic logistical 
facilities, Smith recommended that F-86 Sabre jets to be released by con-
version of FEAF fighter wings should be programmed for Thailand and the 
Philippines. (262)

The PIDAF/FEAF mutual air assistance program proposals could not be 
immediately implemented. In Washington, the National Security Council 
ruled against giving Thailand more jet aircraft. With very limited per-
sonnel, Headquarters, Thirteenth Air Force could not undertake the respon-
sibility of monitoring MDAP air activities in Southeast Asia unless it was 
authorized 28 additional people. The Far East Air Forces requested the 
personnel from USAF, only to be turned down because the Air Force was 
engaged in "Project Wring Out," the desperate effort to reach an authorized 
137-wing augmentation strength within restrictive and rigidly set manpower 
levels. In April 1956, Kuter and Smith discussed the manning problem and 
agreed that they would seek to increase Thirteenth Air Force participation 
in Southeast Asia air activities even if it could not review and monitor 
the MAP activities.(263) On 10 September 1956, one of General Smith's 
policy statements directed that MAP activities would be encouraged to give 
more attention to the development of air facilities, to include a modern 
communications and electronic environment.(264) An Air-MAAG conference 
held in January 1957 laid heavy stress upon the need to develop air base 
complexes and necessary environments through country MAP recommendations. 
(265) Although the need for air facilities in Southeast Asia was well 
apparent, an object lesson occurred during SEATO Exercise Air Link held in 
Thailand an 29-31 May 1957. At Don Muang Airfield the US ICA had developed 
a fuel distribution system on the basis of a relatively small predicted use 
by Royal Thai Air Force and civilian aircraft. The system proved incapable 
of meeting the added requirements of RAF Venom and USAF F-100 and C-119 
aircraft staged to Don Muang for the air-ground maneuver. The Thirteenth 
Air Force Considered that the USAF made a very poor showing in the exercise.(266) 
Knowing that airpower was a composite of professional airmen, air 
vehicles, and operating facilities, General Kuter expected that the estab-
lishment of the Pacific Air Forces on 1 July 1957 would allow the Air Force 
to pursue a single position in the Pacific and to implement air objectives 
in a systematic manner.(267) Through several circumstances, the PACOM 
reorganization did not work out as Kuter expected. As the US military 
representative to SEATO, Admiral Stump still did not choose to permit his 
component commanders to attend the meetings of the SEATO military advisors, 
thus ruling out a prospective means whereby PACAF might have influenced 
developments in a part of the Southeast Asia country air forces.(268) 
In his statement of tasks and responsibilities under the new PACOM organiza-
tion, moreover, Admiral Stump provided that service personnel in the MAAGs 
and JUSMAGs would continue to be outside the command of PACOM component 
commanders. He also visualized that the Chiefs of the MAAGs and JUSMAGs 
would, in the direct line of command from CINCFE, perform military functions 
other than MAP, such as preparing implementing operations plans to support 
CINCPAC plans. Under the old CINCPAC MAP directives which remained in 
effect, the MAAGs were allowed to communicate directly with service depart-
ments or their agencies, including component commanders, on technical 
matters, but, with the establishment of the Air Materiel Force Pacific Area, 
the MAAGs had begun to depend upon this agency for technical support and

would expect very little of this type of assistance from PACAF. (269) 
Seeking to accomplish by persuasion what he could not do by command, 
General Kuter invited all the Pacific-Far East Air attaches and Air-MAAG 
chiefs to Hickam AFB in early November 1957 and urged them to work 
together and establish a mutual understanding which could integrate the 
more than a dozen separate "packets of democratic air power" which now 
existed with little coordination in the region. (270) 
In the first half of 1958, the Pacific Air Forces made plans and 
issued a detailed description of a PACAF Mobile Strike Force that would 
be available for an initial 15 days of combat in Southeast Asia and be 
capable of departing its home bases within 24-hours after an execution 
order was received. Named Commander Thirteenth Air Force on 4 March 
1958, Major General Thomas S. Moorman, Jr., was charged to take command 
of the PACAF Mobile Strike Force as it deployed to Clark Air Base and 
thence to Southeast Asia bases. The units allocated to the Mobile Strike 
Force included three troop carrier squadrons and a combat airlift support 
unit (CALSU) from the 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo); a tactical 
fighter squadron, tactical bomber squadron, reconnaissance task force 
(RTF) with a photo processing center (PPC), and ane-half of an air 
refueling squadron from the Fifth Air Force; a tactical fighter squadron 
from the Thirteenth Air Force; and a search and rescue detachment from 
the 31st Air Rescue Squadron of the Air Rescue Service (Pacific). 
Logistical support for the strike force would be provided from Clark Air 
Base, and the Thirteenth Air Force would draw upon PACAF resources to 
establish air base group detachments for location at forward air bases.(271) 
As finally issued the PACAF Mobile Strike Force directive incorporated 
some of the lessons learned in SEATO Exercise Vayabut which culminated in 
Thailand on 24-25 April 1958. Tha exercise involved the employment of 
PACAF, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Royal-Thai Air Force units in sup-
port of two Thai infantry divisions which were defending a line not far 
north of Bangkok against a simulated Communist land aggressor force. For 
the first time, the use of nuclear weapons was inserted into the scenario 
of the exercise. As he witnessed the maneuver, Lt General Frederic H. 
Smith, Jr., Commander Fifth Air Force, was concerned about the lack of 
reality in the whole affair, based upon his experience in jungle warfare 
during the Buna-Gona and Luzon campaigns of World War II. In these 
campaigns, American airmen had successfully interdicted the Japanese 
when they had attempted to cross New Guinea's Owen Stanley Mountains 
between Buna and Port Moresby, and in the last year of the war on Luzon 
Smith's V Fighter Command had saturated an area at the Ipo Dam with 
napalm permitting friendly troops to overcome strongly fortified Japanese 
positions with light casualties. "In jungle warfare," Smith told his 
Fifth Air Force Staff when he returned to Japan, "you never see the enemy 
until he cuts your throat or you cut his. He encircles and approaches 
you from the rear." He reminded his staff about the fetish against

using nuclear weapons against populated areas and asked the staffmen to 
study how nuclear weapons could be used against terrain objectives both 
to interdict hostile movement and to denude jungle cover. "If you can 
reduce forest to desert," he thought, "you can change the whole theory 
of war."(272) 
In Headquarters, Fifth Air Force, a Tropical Concept Committee drew 
upon a study of the history of World Wer II and Korea, a knowledge of 
nuclear weapon effects, and an analysis of the situation in Southeast Asia 
to prepare a study entitled "Atomic Weapons in Limited Wars in Southeast 
Asia" which was issued on 22 July 1958. The nuclear effects portion of 
the study would be published in unclassified form after a two-year clearance 
process: this part of the study demonstrated how atomic bombs could be used 
for "situation control" in rain forests, valley routes, mangrove forests, 
bamboo groves, karst areas, and mountain defiles both to block hostile move-
ment and to clear away concealment cover. The air logistics portion of the 
study was even more startling since it revealed that the scarcity of air 
facilities (especially jet fuel storage) in Southeast Asia would not permit 
a mobile air strike force to operate for any substantial length of time in 
the strength that would be needed to fight a war with conventional weapons.(273) 
Admiral Harry D. Felt, who relieved Admiral Stump as CINCPAC on 1 
August 1958, postulated his concept of forward defense of the Pacific on the 
two pillars of the strong mobile forces of the United States and the support 
of friendly allies who would be strengthened by the military assistance pro-
gram.(274). This strategy received a severe test in the operations in defense 
of Taiwan in August and September 1958. Where the current CINCPAC operations 
plan for the defense of Taiwan visualized the employment of nuclear weapons 
against threatening Chinese Communist airfields, President Eisenhower directed 
that nuclear weapons would not be authorized in the initial stages of a Red 
Chinese assault. While PACAF's mobile air strike force and the Tactical Air 
Command's CASF X-Ray Tango deployed to Taiwan without great difficulty, the 
communications-electronic environment there was very limited, and air 
facilities -- runways, taxiways, ramps, and dispersal areas -- needed a lot 
of improvement. Emergency actions incident to the Taiwan operation cost the 
military assistance program $200 million over and above the moneys programmed 
for the Republic of China requiring cuts elsewhere in the world-wide fiscal 
year 1959 commitments.(275) On 15 December 1958, General Curtis E. LeMay, 
USAF Vice Chief of Staff, might well have been thinking of the Taiwan opera-
tion when he provided reactions to the Fifth Air Force study on the use of 
atomic weapons in Southeast Asia. He thought that the proposed use of nuclear 
weapons for "situation control" was "a valuable addition to present concepts 
for limited war." But he noted: "The President, of course, must approve the 
release of atomic weapons for a limited war contingency, and the authority 
for expending weapons, even on an individual basis, might well be retained 
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff or at a higher level."(276) In August 1959, 
USAF would direct PACAF to qualify aircrews for the delivery of high explosive

ordnance by 1 June 1960, a directive which PACAF handled by qualifying 
the crews of the two F-100 and one B-57 squadrons of its mobile strike 
force for conventional bombing. At this same time, PACAF also requested 
CINCPAC to make arrangements to stock conventional ordnance in Southeast 
Asia. (277) 
In the same season that the experience in Taiwan was forcibly 
demonstrating that Southeast Asia countries lacked an operation environ-
ment required to support American contingency plans, the Department of 
Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 was being put into effect. The new 
organizational framework for the Defense Department was outlined in a 
revised DOD directive on 31 December 1958. Both the reorganization act 
and the directive envisioned a marked strengthening of the authority of 
the Secretary of Defense and the unified commanders. The commander of a 
unified command was directed to exercise "full operational command" over 
assigned service forces, but the military departments and the component 
services were responsible for the administration and support of their 
respective theater forces. (278) 
Within PACOM the authority of CINCPAC was greatly strengthened, but 
his operational command would continue to be exercised through the com-
ponent commanders or the commanders of subordinate unified commands, and 
the component commanders would be responsible for the administration and 
support of the theater forces.(279) Acting promptly under his new 
authority and mindful of the lack of coordination between MAP and the 
theater strategy, Admiral Felt embarked in the fall of 1958 upon a pro-
gram designed to provide the MAAG$ with detailed guidance in the form of 
a CINCPAC Priority List of Accomplishments. This document was designed 
to establish a priority order for improving the capabilities of country 
forces to perform missions. It also provided guidance to MAP agencies 
since it contained guidelines for country undertakings in accordance with 
regional and country priorities. The priority undertakings were listed as 
projects that could be programmed by the MAAGs as country dollar ceilings 
would permit.(280) 
In the aftermath of Taiwan, Air Force officers redoubled their efforts 
to secure the development of an adequate operating environment in South-
east Asia countries. General Kuter made a strong presentation on the sub-
ject at the UsAF Commanders Conference held at Patrick AFB in November 1958. 
The Air Materiel Forces Pacific Area prepared a MAP study which was briefed 
for Lt General W. F. McKee, Vice Commander AMC, during a visit to Hawaii, 
also in November 1958. This study pointed up the inconsistencies between 
PACAF's mobile strike force planning and the lack of adequate operating 
facilities in Southeast Asia. It saw no reason -- other than lack of 
previous coordination -- why MAP/ICA projects could not be closely related 
to PACAF requirements. The study revealed a belief that the establishment 
of closer programming relationships between PACAF and the MAAGs would

result in PACAF requirements such as POL, ammunition storage facilities, 
ground-to-air communications, fire trucks, refueling vehicles being in 
place, utilized, and maintained by the indigenous air forces and thus 
available for PACAF or USAF use, should this become necessary. (281) 
While the solutions to the problem of providing a need air operating 
environment in Southeast Asia appeared simple, the divided responsibilities 
for MAP which had existed for so long made the problem too complex for 
solution in 1959. In the first place, the Military Assistance Program had 
not been designed and funded for the purpose ofbuildingfacilities to be 
ultimately used by USAF units, and in reality the requirements were US 
defense requirements rather than MAP/ICA responsibilities. In final pro-
gram reviews in Washington, DOD-ISA frequently deleted country projects 
that could not be justified in terms of indigenous requirements as indeed 
it was required to do by law.(282) The predominantly-Army orientation of 
the MAAGs gave trouble, especially since air equipment was high-priced and 
diverted funds from other competing projects. Even when the MAAGs were 
directed to include air projects from CINCPAC's priority list of accomplish-
ments, the MAAG people were sensitive to the criticisms that had appeared 
in The Ugly American. Speaking for the Laos PED, for example, Jake Skinner 
poigga out that it was "extremely difficult to explain why you need an 
8,000 foot heavy duty runway, flat concrete and sweepers to go with it in 
a country that uses Gooney Birds."(283) 
Another set of problems in coordinating PACAF plans with MAP programs 
came from PACAF's very limited associations with military assistance mat-
ters. The MAAGs communicated directly with the Air Materiel Command or the 
Air Materiel Force Pacific Area on technical air logistical matters, and 
only in rare instances was PACAF called upon for assistance or advice and 
only then when a MAAG needed a specific item of supply from PACAF tactical 
units.(284) While USAF looked to PACAF for information about Southeast 
Asia country base development projects, the construction programs were 
handled for CINCPAC by the Navy's Bureau of Pacific Docks, and even the 
responsible PACOM officers noted that they found it hard to get specific 
facts about the exact status of construction programs.(285) In addition 
to these problems, CINCPAC procedures made it very complicated and time-
consuming for persons from PACAF or AMYPA to visit a MAAG, even at the 
invitation of the MAAG Chief. In 1959 a minimum of seven messages was 
necessary in order to accomplish an approved clearance.(286) 
At the conclusion of the SEATO Air Progress maneuver held at Don 
Muang on 2-8 March 1959, Air Vice Marshall Kamol Thejatunga and General 
Moorman prefaced their report to SEATO with the warning that they had not 
gamed logistics in the exercise and recommended that matters of POL and 
armament stores ought to be tested in the future. They also suggested that, 
in order to move toward standardized national force logistics, all of the 
participating SEATO air force units ought to be supported from in-place

logistical systems at SEATO bases.(287) As it happened, the logistical 
deficiencies of Southeast Asia would not have to wait another SEATO 
exercise but were instead demonstrated in August and September 1959 when 
President Eisenhower took steps to implement CINCPAC's contingency plan 
for the support of Laos. US planning for Laos had begun at the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff level on 28 October 1955 when General Maxwell Taylor had 
asked for a study of the movement of a two-division US force there, and 
the Joint Chiefs had subsequently accepted the plan to move the initial 
combat elements into Laos by air and to employ sealift to move- the required 
supply buildup and follow-up echelons.(288) Published in June 1959, CINCPAC 
Operation Plan 32(L)-59 *called for the deployment of Joint Task Force 
116 from Pacific bases with combined airlift and sealift swiftly into Laos. 
The task force would hold the main cities, freeing Lao army for concen-
trated operations against hostile forces. On 5 September 1959, President 
Eisenhower approved a CINCPAC alert and directed that if the operation were 
launched it should be done "with great swiftness." Under the operation plan, 
PACAF was charged to move expeditionary forces to the airfields at Vientiane 
and Seno and provide logistics support for 30-days or until overland supply 
could be established from Bangkok. At a critical moment on 16 September, 
however, the airfield at Vientiane was made unusable by heavy rains. The 
large airlift scheduled for Vientiane could have been diverted to Udorn 
Airfield in Thailand, 40 miles south of Vientiane, but it was doubtful that 
the road from Udorn to Vientiane would support sustained truck traffic. At 
this point, the Laotian erisis subsided and the CINCPAC contingency opera-
tion would not be required, but the experience had again demonstrated the 
very limited capabilities of Southeast Asian airfields to support mobile 
air force deployments. (289) 
After a visit to PACAF.in November 1959, Major General D. R. Hutchinson, 
USAF Assistant for Mutual Security, offered the terse conclusion that there 
had been absolutely no correlation between CINCPAC war plans and the country 
military assistance programs in the past and that such correlation must be 
obtained in the future.(290) Back in Washington on 11 March 1960, General 
Hutchinson raised the question of the imbalance of service representation 
in the US MAAGs. Pointing out that the May 1957 JCS assignment of MAAG 
chiefs had given the Army 16 of the 23 worldwide positions, he suggested 
that this resulted in unbalanced MAP recommendations from the field. The 
Air Force now became actively interested in getting a more equitable balance 
of service representation in the MAAGs, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff would 
need several years to redress the imbalance.(291) 
The immediate task in the Pacific in the winter of 1959-60 was to 
insure that PACAF was permitted some regular authority to act on the USAF 
portion of the PACOM military assistance program. One avenue of approach 
open to General Emmett O'Donnell, Jr., who took over as CINCPACAF on 1 
August 1959, was an internal Air Force action that would make PACAF the 
principal air logistical advisor to the Air Force slections of the MAAGs.

1959 the function of administering Air Force contract technical service 
for the MAP (which had been performed by the Air Materiel Force Pacific 
Area) was transferred to PACAF. Another change in an Air Force regulation 
on 5 February 1960 eliminated the previously authorized direct communica-
tions between Air Materiel Command activities and PACT and provided that 
all such communications on air logistical matters would flow through 
CINCPACAF. In addition to these Air Force actions, a revision of DOD 
Directive 5132.3 issued on 29 February 1960 instructed Unified Commanders 
to draw upon the advice and assistance of component commanders in the 
development of long-range military assistance plans and programs. EMphasizing 
the significance of the new directives, General Thomas D. White, USAF Chief 
of Staff, wrote to O'Donnell on 25 March 1960 emphasizing that O'Donnell must 
play an important role in influencing the preparation of the air portion of 
PACOM's military assistance program. "To an inereasidg degree," white 
wrote, "the capability of MAP air forces must be oriented toward complementing 
the USAF war effort, and your active participation in MAP planning toward that 
end is urged."(292) 
After the spring of 1960, the Pacific Air Forces would have a more 
substantial part in the direction of US military assistance activities in the 
Far East. In retrospect, however, it was obvious that too little attention 
had been given to the development of indigenous air forces in the Southeast 
Asia countries, while the allocation of efforts, funds, and manpower to the 
indigenous Southeast Asia ground forces had been disproportionately large. 
As a result; the country air forces in Southeast Asia were small and chan-
nelized and did not have a sufficiently broad base of personnel with basic 
skills and education to permit necessary expansion. None of the country air 
forces had well-organized systems for operations and training, supply and 
maintenance, intelligence, communications-electronics, or civil engineering. (293) 
In 1958-1959 it was very obvious that the Southeast Asia MAP air programs 
had not been properly balanced either in terms of internal country defense 
requirements or in terms of an overall Pacific-Far East cooperative defense 
strategy. Arrangements were being made to improve the situation, but in view 
of the Communist threat to South Vietnam and Laos time was running out. In 
the case of Laos, J. C. Skinner, the air representative an the PEO, was 
encouraged in November 1959 by the prospects for a more realistic air pro-
gram, but he nevertheless noted that in Laos it might already be getting "too 
late to plow."(29)) The same conclusion was equally true in South Vietnam 
where defense preparations after 1954 had been dominated by ground force 
thinking, with the result that the Vietnamese Air Force was hopelessly 
inadequate to meet requirements which arose when, by May 1959 at the latest, 
Hanoi in effect declared war on South Vietnam and committed its political and 
military apparatus to the struggle.

CHAPTER 3 
BEGINNING OF THE NEW SOUTHEAST ASIAN WAR IN LAOS 
1960-1962 
1. Analyses of the Developing Communist Threat  
As late as April 1958 US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles found it 
possible to believe that the Communist proceas "of trying to pick up one 
country after another has been pretty well brought to a stop by our col-
lective defense treaties around the world which give notice that the Soviets 
cannot attack one without everybody coming to its defense."(1) From 1954 
to 1958 the American threat of massive strategic retaliation coupled with 
collective Free World defense alliances had preserved the peace in South-
east Asia, but by 1957 the Soviets :were approaching a condition of plentiful 
nuclear weapons, and on 4 October 1957 the globe-circling flight of Russia's 
Sputnik indicated that the Soviets:nad scored a significant breakthrough 
in ballistic missile technology.. These developments encouraged Hanoi, 
Peking, and Moscow to attempt new and more aggressive ventures in Southeast 
Asia beginning in 1958. 
At the Geneva Conference in 1954 Ho Chi Minh had been bitterly dis-
appointed when the Soviet Union and Red China were willing to settle for a 
military armistice and a politically divided Vietnam, whereas Ho considered 
that the French colonials had been defeated and that all of Vietnam lay 
within his grasp. In backstage maneuvers at Geneva, however, Soviet Foreign 
Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had been more interested in defeating the 
European Defense Community than in securing maximum gains for Hanoi, and 
there was informed speculation that an arrangement was made between Mendez-
France and Molotov to trade off French participation in EDC for a settlement 
in Indochina that was not too unfavorable to France.(2) 
In addition to other gains, the Vietminh delegates at Geneva had hoped 
to secure an autonomous sovereign,Pathet Lao area in northern Laos, but, in 
private talks with Mendez-France, Red China!s Chou En-lai (who was unwilling 
to push the risk of US intervention in Indochina too far) had settled for 
reintegration of Laos under a coalition government.(3) In the years after 
1954 Communist China provided substantial military assistance for the North 
Vietnamese Army, but the Soviet Union showed less interest in the future 
of North Vietnam, as well as some evidence of concern that Hots extremely 
brutal land reform program had seriously diminished his popularity through-
out Vietnam. According to one informed reporter the Soviets actually did 
not want the national plebiscite called for in the Geneva Agreements in mid-
1956 because they believed that an internationally supervised secret ballot 
might well go against Ho, and in any event, Soviet support for the election 
was no more than perfunctory.(4) In 1957 the Soviets proposed that North 
and South Vietnam and North and South Korea be admitted to membership in

the United Nations as separate entities, the Soviet spokesman arguing that 
the "realistic approach is to admit that there are two States with conflict-
ing political systems in both Korea and 7iet-Nam."(5) 
On the day following the final session of the Geneva Conference Ho 
Chi Minh had emphasized his determination to establish Communism over all 
of Vietnam by calling for a "long and arduous struggle" to win the southern 
areas, which he described as "territories of aurs."(6) In the first year 
after Geneva, Hanoi sent a small number of Vietcong cadres across or around 
the 17th parallel, and in 1955-56 General Van Tien Dung, chief of staff of 
the North Vietnamese Army, dropped from sight and was in South Vietnam 
expanding the Comhmmist apparatus and preparing for future infiltration. 
In these years, however, the Vietnamese Communist Lao Dong party worked 
for unification by political means, including subversion and actions short 
of open armed conflict. This Lao Dong policy was maintained over active 
protests of the Communist party members and cadres in South Vietnam, who 
felt themselves losing substantial strength to President Diem's pacification 
programs. In the wards of a major Vietcong analysis of its experience 
captured in 1966, the majority of party members and cadres in South Vietnam 
were convinced by 1958 that "it was necessary to launch immediately an 
armed struggle in order to preserve the movement and protect the forces."(7) 
In the mid-1950's the Chinese Communists followed the Soviet lead in 
announced policies of peaceful coexistence with the West and the develop-
ment of internal socialism as a transitional base for an eventual Communist 
society, but by 1958 the Chinese Rads were impatient with the slowness of 
Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to exploit Russia's apparent breakthrough 
in strategic technology. In 1958 Peking launched a "Great Leap Forward," 
with bold goals of advancing doctrinnaire Communist both inside and outside 
China. In China the "Great Leap Farward" would attempt to build a Marxist 
order of peoples' communes. In its foreign policy, Peking expressed willing-
ness to risk the danger of general nuclear war in order to spread international 
Communism. As they appeared to Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern 
Affairs Walter S. Robertson, the first signs of Red China's "increasing 
arrogance" came in mid-1958, when Peking launched all-out economic warfare 
against Japan, urging Overseas-Chinese merchants to boycott Japanese products 
and flooding Southeast Asian markets with cut-rate priced Chinese goods. 
Armed aggression soon followed in July 1958, when Red China commenced armed 
attacks against Chinese NationsliAt garrisons an Quemoy- and Matsu Islands 
in the Taiwan Straits. (8) During the Taiwan Straits crisis Khrushcher 
respected the Sino-Soviet defense pact of 1950 and placed the threat of 
Soviet nuclear weapons behind China. In an Obvious change in Soviet 
position from the year before, moreover, a Soviet veto in the United Nations 
Security Council on 9 December 1958 blocked the admission of the Republic 
of Vietnam to the United Nations which was sponsored by France, japan, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States.(9)

The bristling belligerency of Red China was paralleled by aggression in 
Southeast Asia. As has been seen, NVA troop movements into the Lao pan-. 
handle in December 1958 were preparatory to an expanding North Vietnamese 
program for moving men and supplies into South Vietnam. Making public a 
decision probably taken earlier, the Lao Dong party on 13 May 1959 called 
for the reunification of Vietnam by "all appropriate means," thereby signalling 
the beginning of revolutionary armed warfare against the Republic of Viet-
nam. In this same month, North Vietnam organized the 559th Transportation 
Group with a mission of forwarding support to Vietcong bases within South 
Vietnam. The 70th Battalion went to the Lao panhandle, and in June the 
603d Battalion was formed near the Narth Vietnamese naval base at Quang Khe 
with responsibility for clandestine maritime infiltrations into South 
Vietnam. By January 1960 a special training base for Vietcong infiltrators 
was operational at Son Tay, northwest of Hanoi. In Nghe An Province, the 
NVA 324th Division was ordered to begin training infiltrators, and at this 
same time the Xuan Mai infiltration center was set up southwest of Hanoi, 
with a capacity to handle several 1000-man classes at one time.(10) 
Intelligence of the NVA activities was not yet available in 1959-1960, but 
early in 1959 it was nevertheless evident that the directing hand of 
Communist activity inside Laos and South Vietnam was shifting from indigenous 
Pathet,Lao and Vietcong leaders to Hanoi and Peking. (ii) The sudden 
resumption of Communist warfare in Laos in July 1959, moreover, coincided 
with Chinese Communist probes against India's borders and also with Chair-
man KhrUshchevls imminent arrival in the United States for talks with 
President Eisenhower--discussions which the Chinese Reds opposed.(12) 
In subsequent years it would be apparent that Red China's increasingly 
doctrinnaire stance after 1958 offered an ideological challenge to the 
Soviet leadership of international Communism that Khrushchev would not accept, 
and the Sino-Soviet split was beginning in 1958. During the Taiwan 
Straits crisis, Khrushchev honored Russian defense agreements with China, 
but Khrushchev was clearly frightened by the strident Red Chinese assertion 
that a general nuclear war would advance the cause of international 
Communism. The Sino-Soviet split would be quite useful to Hanoi, since 
both China and Russia would cultivate the support of Ho Chi Minh. In 
Washington during 1959-1960, however, a continuing concept of monolithic 
international CammardEmi, said to have been most deeply implanted in the 
State Department's Bureau of Far Eastern Affairs(13), made it difficult 
for US policy planners to recognize the exact nature of the Communist 
threat to Laos and Vietnam. On 12 August 1959, Allen W. Dulles, Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency, identified Communist China as the 
principal danger in East Asia, warning the National Security Council's 
Operations Coordination Board that the United States should be prepared 
for trouble from Red China anywhere in the Far Eas1o.(14) On 17 August, 
Assistant Secretary of State J. Graham Parsons discounted the likelihood of 
a Sino-Soviet split and stated his belief that Communist China would "remain 
firmly alined with its nuclear partner, the Soviet Union, which has on

several recent occasions thrown the weight of its nuclear threats behind 
Chinese Communist actions." Parsons envisioned that local forces in Laos 
and South Vietnam would deal with small incursions from alien territory and 
with internal insurgencies that were "believed" to be organized by the 
North Vietnamese, but he saw no change in the concept that SEATO would be 
the "broader deterrent" to Communist aggression against Laos, Cambodia, and 
Vietnam.(15) In August 1960 another State Department spokesman indicated 
that overt Chinese Communist aggression against Southeast Asia would be 
met by nuclear strikes against Chinese targets.(16) In the months that 
would follow, a continuing belief in the monolithic Communist threat to 
Southeast Asia would affect US policy toward the conflict in Laos and South 
Vietnam. 
2. Uneasi Peace and Renewed Hostilities in Laos  
The Lao crisis of 1959 had demonstrated weaknesses in the government 
headed by Prime Minister Pilau' Sananikone, the Royal Lao Army, and in 
CINCPAC plans for rendering active military aid to Laos. Any prospects of 
alleviating these weaknesses depended upon diplomacy and the US mutual 
assistance programs, neither of which promised a quick fix to the problems. 
As a matter of national policy, the United States had no desire to 
intervene in the internal affairs of Laos and undertook to support duly 
constituted governments in Laos in their efforts to maintain the independence 
and integrity of Laos against Communist encroachment either from within or 
without the country. (17) As a matter of fact, however, uncertain consti-
tutional precedents in Laos made it difficult for Western nations to remain 
aloof from internal Laotian politics. When the Phoui government was ending 
its year of exceptional powers in December 1959, Brig Gen Phoumi Nosavan 
and four other Army generals led a military coup on 31 December, demanding 
caretaker status over the Royal Lao Government pending the election of a 
new National Assembly. On 4 January, US Ambassador Smith, together with 
the British and French ambassadors and the Australian charge d' affairs, 
called upon King Savang Vatthana and informed him that he had been misinformed 
if he believed that a military dictatorship would receive the approbation 
of friendly foreign governments. Heeding the advice, the King named a 
venerable Lao, Lou Abhay, as Prime Minister and limited military membership 
in the transition government to Phoumi, who continued to be Minister of 
National Defense. (18) 
In the Lao elections for the National Assembly on 24 April 1960, General 
Phoumi was generally credited with making the arrangements which gave the 
Communist Neo Lao Hak Sat party the privilege of naming candidates but 
insured that Army-sponsored candidates would gain an overwhelming victory. 
The Red Prince Souphanouvong, although held under house arrest in Vientiane, 
was encouraged to name nine candidates who could meet stringent criteria

specified as qualification for the national legislature. The new Lao Army 
psychological warfare teams proved useful in presenting government programs 
in remote sections of the country. A nine-battalion Army force swept through 
the region heavily infested'hy guerrillas east of Pakse. This force 
crossed the Bolovens Plateau as far asSaravane and Attopeu. In six weeks, 
no guerrillas were encountered, but the force dropped off the new psychological 
warfare teams in important villages to safeguard the election. (19) One 
315th Air Division combat cargo mission reminiscent of "Operation Booster 
Shot" was attempted and generally miscarried. At a request from the Laos 
PEO made in March, PACAF on 16 April directed the .315th Air Division to 
stage a C-130 to Udorn Airfield in Thailand for an airdrop of two D-4 
bulldozers and two quarter-ton trucks to Phong Saly, Laos--the equipment 
to be used to construct an airstrip. In the first drop on 26 April two 
trucks and one of the bulldozers were successfully delivered but the bull-
dozer damaged the plane at its exit. After repairs to the aircraft, the last 
bulldozer was dropped on 29 April, but now only one of five cargo chutes 
deployed properly and the bulldozer was demolished.(20) 
The result of the Lao election on 24 April was a landslide for the pro-
government forces, and General Phoumi night well have been offered the 
leading post in the new government. Partly because of renewed Western 
Objections to military rule, however, King Savang Vatthana selected Tiao 
Somsanith, a man of more moderate leanings, to head the Royal Government 
which took office on 2 June. Phaumi Nosavan remained as Minister of Defense, 
but there was now no doubt that he was the strong man in the government. 
One of Phoumi's announced intentions was to press the trial of Prince 
Souphanouvong on long delayed changes for offenses against state security. 
In view of this development, Souphanouvong and fifteen other imprisoned 
Pathet Lao leaders escaped from detention on the night of 23 May and rejoined 
Pathet Lao military units in northeastern Laos.(21) 
Apparently unknown to anyone in Laos or even in Bangkok, a 30-year old 
Lao Army Captain Kong Le, Commander of the elite Royal Lao 2d Parachute 
Battalion, had been plotting a coup d'etat for several months, and, during 
the early hours of 9 August, Kong Le's force of 600 paratroopers seized 
Vientiane. According to first reports, Kong Le's men were disgruntled 
because their pay had been delayed and they were tired of pursuing the 
Pathet Lao. General Heintges, Chief of the PEO, knew Kong Le personally 
and did not believe that the young Kha tribesman had the intelligence or 
the education to plot the course that his revolt subsequently took. 
Heintges believed that the Communists seized the golden opportunity and 
furnished Kong Le's propaganda. At a rally on 11 August, Kong Le demanded 
an end to the military campaign against the Pathet Lao. In the next few 
days Kong Le forced the National Assembly to depose Prime Minister 
Somsanithrs government and to approve a new government headed by Sauvanna 
Phauma. In the new cabinet, General Phoumi was allocated the positions of

Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister, but Phoumi, who was in close 
contact with Marshal Sarit in Thailand, would not leave his base in Savannakhet 
to take the offices in Vientiane. In a statement of policy, Souvanna Phduma 
stressed his intention of ending the civil war, maintaining a struggle 
against foreign interference, accepting aid from and maintaining friendly 
relations with all countries, and implementing a policy of strict neutralism. (22) 
In Washington during the week following Kong Le's coup, President 
Eisenhower described the situation in Laos as "very confused." He needed 
time to secure clarification of what had happened.(23) On 17 August, Acting 
Secretary of State Douglas Dillon announced that the United States would 
have nothing to do with General Phoumi and was keeping its hands off affairs 
in Laos. In Vientiane, Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown, who had arrived at 
his new post less than a month before the coup, told Souvanna Phauma 
that the United States would remain absolutely neutral in the government 
crisis. At this sane time, Brown told Phoumi that the United States would 
not support any separatist movement, or attempt to Solve the situation by 
force but rather believed that Phoumils participation in the new government 
was most important.(24) On the other hand, Marshal. Sarit was sympathetic 
to Phoumi and deeply distrustful of Souvanna Phouma. Applying economic 
pressure, Thailand closed off commerce with Vientiane, and Sarit told a 
Free World ambassador that he might well take a new look at his relations 
with the United States in view of its mishandling and inaction in the 
Laotian crisis. South Vietnamese leaders, worried about Souvanna's talk of 
reducing South Vietnam's representation in Vientiane, closing the Chinese 
Nationalist consulate, and recognizing the Soviet Union, were also critical 
of the United States' refusal to back Phoumi. They felt that the United 
States was permitting a situation to develop to a point that would lead to 
a Communist takeover of Lacs.(25) 
At the time of the Kong Le coup, the Lao army outside Vientiane was 
widely dispersed on anti-guerrilla operations throughout the country. By 
late August, however, the Lao Army Commander, General Duane Rathikone, 
estimated that Kong Le controlled about 1,800 troops out of the total regular 
strength of 29,500. By distributing weapons from the warehouses in Vientiane, 
Kong Le armed a number of civilians, thus bringing his strength up to approx-
imately 6,000 men. In Savannakhet, General Phoumi could count upon troops 
loyal to Prince Boun Oum Champassak, wham Phoumi put forward to head the 
counter-revolutionary regime. Phoumi could also expect covert assistance 
from Marshal Sarit in Thailand, including the release to him of 200 Lao 
paratroopers who were in training in Thailand. In a myriad of political 
moves and countermoves, Phoumi brought most of the Lao military to his side, 
but the Pathet Lao radio on 19 September directed guerrilla forces loyal to 
Prince Souphanovvong to avoid clashes with the Souvanna-Kong Le troops and, 
wherever possible, to join them in fighting Phoumi. The first victories 
went to Kong Le's paratroopers, who drove Phoumi forces out of their 
advance position at Paksane in mid-September, forcing many of the men to flee

across the Mekong into Thailand. On 22 September King Savang told 
Ambassador Brown that his first concern was to reestablish the integrity 
and unity of the armed forces, and an 26 September Savang dismissed Phoumi 
from the Souvanna cabinet.(26) 
In Washington during August and September a division in the germane 
positions of the US State and Defense Departments toward the Laotian crisis 
allowed the situation to deteriorate and caused the United States to miss 
an opportunity to intervene overtly without entailing a direct risk of 
a major-power confrontation. The State Department wanted a political 
settlement of the situation by compromise and coalition government in Laos. 
The Defense Department and the Joint Chiefs of Staff pushed for solid and 
effective support of Phoumi as the only known pro-Western element in Laos.(27) 
The United States joined France and Great Britain on 27 September in a state-
ment in support of the Souvanna Phouma government, but in October the actions 
of this government made it appear ta President Eisenhower that "Souvanna 
Phouma was either an accomplice or a: captive of Captain Kong Le who, 
himself, was an accomplice of the Ccirffaunist Pathet Lao." On 28 September 
Pathet Lao guerrilla pressure compelled troops loyal to Phoumi to abandon 
Sam Neua town and its airfield, yet Souvanna expressed willingness to 
negotiate with the Pathet Lao to form a coalition government. Souvanna was 
also willing to receive an ambassador from the Soviet Union and requested 
a Soviet airlift of "foodstuff and her supplies" into Vientiane. A 
special US mission to Laos--headed by Assistant Secretary of Defense John 
N. Irwin and Assistant Secretary of State J. Graham Parscns--arrived at 
Vientiane on 12 October, but this mission was unable to persuade Souvanna 
to break off his negotiations with the Pathet Lao. The following day, the 
Soviet Ambassador arrived in Vientiahe, where he met a warm demonstration 
from Kong Le's forces and promised that gasoline, food, and medical supplies 
would begin to arrive from the Soviet Union via Hanoi. After conferences 
with Secretary Parsons in Bangkok, Ambassador Brown secured Souyannals 
approval for a plan whereby the United States would restore cash-grant 
aid to Souvanna but would also provide military assistance to General 
Phoumi under a gentlemen's agreement that Phoumi would use the equipment 
only against the Pathet Lao. (28) 
Soviet delays in providing promised aid to Souvanna indicated that 
Moscow was assessing the prospects of a great power confrontation in Laos 
and might also be having difficulty mobilizing airlift forces. On the 
political level, a declaration by Ihrushchev at the United Nations General 
Assembly in September 1960 had called attention to "the grave danger of 
colonial wars growing into a new world war." On the other hand, the 
Chinese Communists asserted Lenin's teaching that war was useful for 
extending Communism. These Sino-Soviet doctrinal divergencies were placed 
in debate in November 1960 by a world conference of Communist parties in 
Moscow (with Ho Chi Minh representing North Vietnam). The outcome of the 
debate would be a new Connunist doctrine an war that would represent a

compromise between the Chinese position that war was useful and the Soviet 
rationalization that any hostility could expand into thermonuclear destruction. 
Khrushchev described the new doctrine which had been worked out in November 
and December in an address entitled "For New Victories of the World Communist 
Movement" which he delivered an 6 January 1961. He noted that "world wars" 
and "local wars that would grow into a world thermonuclear war" were to be 
avoided. On the other hand, "national liberation wars" through which 
colonial people could attain independence were "not only admissible but 
inevitable" and could be fully supported by Communists. (29) 
During November 1960 the United States was committed to support 
Souvanna Phouma's government of Laos and to give military assistance to 
General Phoumils counter-revolutionary group. Souvanna's actions, however, 
seemed increasingly unwise, especially his flying trip to Sam Neua an 
18 November where he met Souphanouvong and received the latter's agreement 
to participate in a coalition government. When Souvanna appeared to move 
to the left, General Phoumi benefited from defections of Lao military 
commanders--including General Ouane--to his side. By 23 November all 
organized Lao troops were under Phoumi command except for the units in 
Vientiane under Kong Le and Souvanna Phouma. With the beginning of dry 
weather, General Phoumi started a march from Savannakhet toward Vientiane, 
and an 9 December Souvanna Phouma delegated his civil and military powers 
to the High Command of the Lao Army and flew to exile in Cambodia. Mambers 
of the National Assembly, meeting in Savannakhet, voted no confidence in 
Souvanna, and, acting without delay in Luang Prabang on 12 December, King 
Savang Vatthana recognized Prince Bonn Oust as the head of a provisional Lao 
government. (30) 
In addition to the political complexities involved, the Soviets also 
apparently had some difficulty mobilizing an airlift task force for 
service in Southeast Asia. In late November, however, the Soviet Air 
Force brought Ilyushin-14 planes that had been engaged in the Congo to 
Hanoi, and the Soviet Union commenced shuttle flights into Vientiane Air-
field on 3 December. American Observers were not able to approach too closely, 
but General Heintges believed that the first Soviet flights included not 
only petroleum products requested by Souvanna Phouma but also advisors and 
weapons for Kong Le, whose forces had begun to melt down to the hard core 
of his paratroopers. At any rate on 10 December, Quinim Pholsema, the pro-
Chinese and anti-American member of Souvanna's cabinet who had remained in 
Vientiane, went to Hanoi aboard an IL-14 and made a firm arrangement with 
the Russians whereby arms and supplies would be airlifted to Kong Le, in 
return for an alliance between Kong Le and the Pathet Lao. After 3 December, 
the Soviets began to employ five IL-14's each of which made two daily flights 
between Hanoi and Vientiane. The Ilyushin flights arriving an 11 December 
unloaded six 105 mm. howitzers and ammunition for Kong Le, who could of 
course also use the food and gasoline regularly transported to Vientiane.(31)

When Fhoumi's forces attacked Vientiane an 13-14 December, the Soviet 
assistance to Kong Le proved too limited to permit the latter's forces to 
mount an adequate defense of the administrative capital. But the Soviet 
supplies enabled Kong Le to begin an orderly withdrawal to the Plain of 
Jars, where the Soviets opened an airhead and began to lay down equipment 
for Kong Le and also for North Vietnamese troops that were moving into Laos. 
The Soviet transport planes also parachuted supplies along Kong Lets line 
of retreat, enabling his three surviving companies of paratroops to reach 
the Plain of Jars on 31 December.(32) In Washington as General Phoumi was 
retaking Vientiane and Prince Bonn Oum's government was recognized by the 
King, President Eisenhower hoped that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization 
would take charge of the Lao controversy in support of a properly constituted 
provisional government of Laos. Preparatory to a SEATO intervention in 
which US forces would be expected to occupy Vientiane and Luang Prabang, 
CINCPAC declared an alerting Defense Condition 3 for all forces earmarked 
for Joint Task Force 116 on 14 December. At this early juncture, 
however, Eisenhower thought it important that Phoumi receive air trans-
ported supplies from Thailand and that some air reconnaissance flights be 
flown to check enemy activities. For one thing, the United States needed 
some photographs of the Soviet air transport planes in action. (33) 
Employing a VC-47 airplane borrowed from the US Embassy in Saigon, the 
USAF air attache to Vientiane commenced low level reconnaissance flights 
over northeastern Laos on 17 December. This improvised reconnaissance 
plane got definite intelligence on its first flights and a hand-held oblique 
camera was used to secure photos of Russian aircraft dropping supplies on 
21 and 27 December.(34) With intelligence in hand concerning the illegal 
Soviet airlift activities, Admiral Felt proposed to the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff on 20 December that a few pilots an armed reconnaissance could find 
good hunting along the route between Vientiane and Luang Prabang and around 
Xieng Khouang. He pointed out that the Royal Thai Air Force had at least 
50 T-6 aircraft equipped with .30-caliber machine guns and capable of 
carrying light bombs or napalm and that it might be possible to get some 
combat-ready Thai pilots to volunteer for missions in Laos. For the long 
run, however, Felt proposed that the United States should get Thailand to 
provide Laos with 10 armed T-6's and to give transition training in the 
operation of the planes to Lao pilots.. Then, after a Laotian warning to the 
Russians, the Lao pilots could begin attacks against the Soviet air transport 
planes and Pathet Lao artillery and vehicles. As an initial reaction, the 
State and Defense Departments authorized Admiral Felt to go ahead with plans 
to prepare the Lao pilots to operate T-6's in combat.(35) 
Although President Eisenhower favored SEATO support for the Bolin Cum 
government and the State and Defense Departments reacted favorably to 
Admiral Felt's suggestions for offensive air action, the SEATO allies were 
less enthusiastic. For one thing, there was some question as to the 
legality of the Boun Own government and as to whether the Soviet airlift

which had been requested by Souvanna Phouma was in fact illegal. Before 
leaving Vientiane for Phnam Penh, Souvanna Phouma had not resigned the 
Prime Minister's portfolio, and he continued to refuse to do so, rationaliz-
ing that his formal resignation was not required since King Savang Vatthana 
(even though acting under coercion) had automatically removed the incumbent 
premier when Bonn Own was installed. Sauvannais action permitted the Soviets 
to maintain the fiction that Souvanna remained the lawful head of the govern-
ment of Laos and that the Soviet airlift was supporting this government. In 
a letter to President Eisenhower on 30 December, British Prime Minister 
Harold Macmillan recommended that the first essential to SEATO action in 
Laos would be to establish "a proper legitimate government" under Bonn Own, 
a matter which could best be done by persuading Souvanna Phouma to resign 
and by having the Lao National Assembly confirm Bonn Own as premier. In a 
staff meeting concerned with Laos, President Eisenhower directed that the 
political actions suggested by Macmillan be pursued and that a new appeal 
for united action be made to France. He was not optimistic about France, 
however, since he noted that the French disliked Phoumi Nosavan and hoped 
that Souvannars neutralist government would work. Eisenhower also directed 
that Task Force 116 should be brought to a condition of intense readiness 
and that the Russians should be warned that the United States was gravely 
concerned about Laos. At the conclusion of this meeting on 31 December, the 
State Department issued a note declaring that the United States was mindful 
of its SEATO obligations and would "take the most serious view of any 
intervention in Laos by the Chinese Columnists or Viet Minh armed forces or 
others in support of the Communist Pathet Lao, who are in rebellion against 
the Royal Laotian Government." (36) 
On 30 December Admiral Felt recognized the political problem in Laos, 
but he nevertheless messaged the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he favored 
military action to stop the Soviet airlift and to burn up Communist supply 
dumps and aircraft on the ground.(37) In fact, the crisis in Laos was 
worsening. In its mission on 27 December, the improvised air attache 
reconnaissance C-47 was damaged by ground fire, a fact that led Felt to 
suggest that Phoumi request both the United States and Thailand to initiate 
air reconnaissance flights over Laos. Despite the growing danger, however, 
the air attache crew flew the D-47 an another reconnaissance mission from 
Vientiane north to Luang Prabang and east to Xieng Khouang on 31 December. 
Near Xieng Khouang the C-47 crew received very damaging ground fire, but it 
nevertheless reported a large convoy of 40 to 50 enemy vehicles in the area. 
A radio message from the crew permitted Mao troops under Lt Colonel Tang 
Pao to escape from Xieng Khouang into surrounding mountains, where these 
farces commenced a very effective harrassment of the Pathet Lao.(38) As 
directed by Washington, Admiral Felt declared Defense Condition 2 for Joint 
Task Force 116 on 31 December, and he further requested the dispatch of a 
CASF 0-130 transport squadron from the United States to Clark Air Base. 
With the arrival of the 773d Troop Carrier Squadron from Sewart Air Force 
Base on 2 January 1961, JIT-116 was fully ready to go to the assistance 
of the Lao government. (39)

In exile at Phnom Penh, Sourana Phouma refused to accept a proposition 
whereby the King would send him to Paris as ambassador if he would resign . 
his claim to the Laotian premiership, and he also refused to return to Laos 
until a coalition government was possible. On 4 January 1961, the Lao 
National Assembly nevertheless unanimously voted its support for Boun Oum's 
cabinet.()0) As far as the United States was concerned, Boun Gum's govern-
ment was completely legitimate, but on 5 January President Eisenhower 
received a letter from French President Charles de Gaulle which made it 
evident that France would not participate in a SEATO intervention. De 
Gaulle stated that the failure of the United States to accept an earlier 
tripartite approach to global problems was partly responsible for the 
situation in Laos.(41) On instructions from Washington, CINCPAC reduced 
the alert of JTF-116 to DEFCON 3 on 6 January, and on the following day 
a US State Department white paper on Laos stated that the United States 
would work with other free nations to pursue "whatever measures seem most 
promising."(42) In the closing fortnight of his administration, President 
Eisenhower was regretfully unable to find an answer to the "cloudy and 
serious" situation in Laos. At a briefing for President-elect John F. 
Kennedy an 19 January 1961, Eisenhower nevertheless emphasized that Laos 
was the key to all of Southeast?Asia. He believed that any new Lao coalition 
government that included Communists would be fatal and said that he would 
be willing "as a last desperate hope, to intervene unilaterally."(43) 
The failure of SEATO to act in Laos meant that General Phoumi's 
military campaign against the Pathet Lao and Kong Le forces would be 
conducted by the Royal Lao Arnv (FAR), with some assistance from the 
United States, Thailand, and South Vietnam. Phoumi envisioned a six months 
campaign, to begin with initial operations to clear Route 13 between Vientiane 
and Luang Prabang. His force would then commence a second phase offensive 
along Route 7 which would disperse and destroy Pathet Lao-Kong Le forces in 
Sam Neua. A third phase offensive would clear Phong Saly province. Phoumi 
estimated that the second and third phases would be accomplished by 31 May 
1961. His campaign would require 10 battalions of Laotian troops, thus 
necessitating a withdrawal of most government forces from the southeastern 
Lao panhandle. To cover this area the FAR would need increased forces, but 
meanwhile Phoumi revealed that he had an agreement with South Vietnam for 
one of its divisions to move into southern Laos as an intervention force 
when and if he asked for assistance. Previous American aid programs had 
provided the Lao Army with light weapons that could be easily transported in 
difficult terrain, with the result that Lao forces were deficient in artillery. 
Phoumi also required additional airlift. The United States had already 
provided four H-34 helicopters to Laos, and it now agreed to expedite the 
delivery of 11 additional H-34's, all to be maintained and operated on a 
contract basis by Air America. Already scheduled to be relieved as Chief, 
Programs Evaluation Office by Brig Gen A. J. Boyle in January 1961, one of 
General Heintges' last duties in Vientiane was to arrange to provide US 
logistical support for PhoumiTs projected six-month field campaign. ()4)

As outlined in December 1960, Phoumi's optimistic campaign plan did not 
anticipate the fact that the North Vietnamese and the Russians were rapidly 
transforming the Plain of Jars into a vast armed camp and that the ragged 
Pathet Lao were being encadred by regular Vietminh forces. At the sane time 
that the Soviets were ferrying in 105 mm. howitzers, mortars, and 37 mm. 
flak guns, the North Vietnamese were opening overland transportation on 
Route 7 from Barthelemy Pass on the border to the Plain of Jars. The Soviet 
IL-14's were also developing other strong points in Laos outside the Plain 
of Jars. On 31 December, the Embassy C-47 recce flight noted that an old 
airstrip at Pang Vieng, on the Royal Highway between Vientiane and Luang 
Prabang, had been lengthened to 4,350 feet and that an IL-14 was an the 
ground there unloading cargo.(45) 
Early in January 1961 Admiral Felt made a determined effort to improve 
the Lao Army's fighting spirit by providing air reconnaissance and fighter 
support. As suggested by Felt, Phoumi requested reconnaissance from both 
Thailand and the United States. Both governments recognized the requirement, 
but each apparently believed that the other should provide it. The Joint 
Chiefs of Staff authorized Felt to raise the question with Thai officials 
of using one of their RT-33's, preferably without insignia and piloted by a 
Thai volunteer. Prime Minister Sarit was skittish about assuming the task 
and instead urged the United States to fly the missions with U-2 planes. 
As a temporary expedient, PACAF provided a camera-equipped Fifth Air Force 
SC-47 and a professional reconnaissance crew who began to fly missions out 
of Vientiane on 11 January. These flights drew some ground fire, but they 
confirmed the existence of a good many potential aerial targets both in 
the Plain of Jars area and on Route 7 toward the Vietnamese border.(46) 
Late in December 1960, Thailand was willing to transfer 10 T-6 aircraft 
to Laos, provided the United States would provide the RTAF with more-modern 
T-37 jets in exchange. The first four T-6's, with wing-mounted .30 caliber 
machine guns and equipment to handle either 5 inch rockets or bombs were 
ready for transfer an 4 January. Lao pilots were flown to Thailand for 
transition, a task that met some delay when several of the Lao airmen 
experienced difficulties, including air sickness, in gunnery maneuvers. On 
9 January, Lao pilots flew the T-6's to Savannakhet, and they moved to 
Vientiane on the following day. (147) 
On 7 January the Joint Chiefs of Staff informed Admiral Felt that Phoumi 
was authorized to make inmEdiate use of the T-6 aircraft?armed with guns 
and rockets but not with bombs?with first priority to be given to Communist 
airlift an the ground or in the air and second priority to hostile troops, 
dumps, and other similar military targets. On the afternoon of 10 January, 
the Lao Government delivered a note protesting Soviet air violations of 
Laos to the Soviet Embassy, where an official read and refused to accept 
it, stating that the Soviet Union did not recognize the Boun Own government. 
On 11 January, the Lao T-6 pilots flew their first combat mission on a road 
sweep from the Nam Lik River north of Vientiane to the Pang Vieng airstrip.

They located no targets and expended their ordnance on two bridges. 
Admiral Felt was not pleased and directed that air strikes aught to be . 
scheduled against specific targets. On 15 January, the Lao pilots located 
and destroyed two large trucks at yang Vieng. On the ground, after failing 
to get started for several weeks, Phoumi's forces crossed the Nam Lik River 
on 14 January and captured yang Vieng on 16 January. (L8) 
The morale of Phoumi's flyers soared when they destroyed the trucks on 
15 January, but two days later one, of the T-6's was shot down by ground 
fire, and the Lao pilots began to complain about the slaw speed of the 
T-6's and the difficulty they had in making attacks with guns and rockets. 
On the ground, Phoumi's commanders did not continue their attack after 
taking Vang Vieng, and the Pathet Lao-Kong Le forces continued to hold the 
important ground at Phau Koun, at the junction of highways 7 and 13. 
Unless given more effective armament, the Lao pilots refused to consider 
attacking flak-defended targets on the Plain of Jars, and Phoumi posed 
requirements for B-26 light bomber for attacks against more strongly 
defended enemy positions. Both General Bayle and Admiral Felt recommended 
that the Joint Chiefs authorize the use of bombs and napalm on the T-6' s, 
but in this they were opposed by Ambassador Brown, who held the strong 
Presidential mandate as head of the US Country Team. Brown had not been in 
favor of moving the T-6's into Laos in the first place; he did not want to 
escalate the conflict and argued that bombing would invite retaliatory air 
attacks against Royal Lao airfields and depots. On 30 January, Admiral 
Felt took exception to a message in which Ambassador Brawn apposed the 
introduction of new weapons and techniques into Lace but nevertheless 
expressed hope that Phouthi would recapture the Plain of Jars area. In a 
message to the Joint Chiefs, Felt thcught the Ambassador's analysis 
contained small basis for the hops expressed. "There is a larger and better 
basis for hope," he said, "by removing restraints which have been self-
imposed on the kind of support we can give Phoumi's fighting men, by continu-
ing to bolster leadership at troop level and by building morale by winning 
the fight." (L9) 
Late in January the Lao T-6's 'reportedly made some successful rocket 
attacks in support of Phaumist forces closing on Phou Khoum from both 
north and south, and the road junction town was captured an 3 February. 
American Observers now thought that the Phoumi forces would proceed eastward 
at a good clip along Highway 7 to.the Plain of Jars, while another column 
moved northward from Paksane along Route 4 aiming at Xieng Khouang. But the 
enemy forces had been allowed to build up defenses, and both of the 
government drives faltered and halted. In citing reasons for the failure 
to break the stalemate on the approaches to the Plain of Jars, a ranking 
Lao general pointed to law troop morale due to poor logistical support, to 
Phoumi's inability to delegate authority or to give an order with any 
assurance that it would be carried out, and to the political negotiations

that were progressing during the campaign. King Savang Vatthana proposed 
that Burma, Cambodia, and Malaya should send a peacekeeping neutral nations 
committee to Laos. He also spoke of reconciliation with the Pathet Lao 
and did not condemn Souvanna Phouma. The implication that the King did not 
wholeheartedly support the Boun Own government weakened Phoumils position, 
and observers reported that Phoumi gave more time to politics than to his 
lagging military operations.(50) 
In an assessment of practical steps that could be taken to hasten the 
capture of the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khauang with a minimum of escalation, 
General Boyle reported on 27 February that the Pathet Lao-Kong Le-Vietminh 
forces (undoubtedly with foreign advice and assistance) were increasingly 
professional in the use of mines, artillery, and terrain. Boyle counted 
the Lao T-6 pilots to be only marginally effective because they refused to 
risk enemy ground fire, but he noted that the prohibition against their 
using bombs and napalm also limited the air effort. On the other hand, he 
observed that his intelligence was uncovering many specific military targets 
for air strikes. In consideration of these factors, Boyle recommended that 
the most immediate practical step that could be taken to capture the Plain 
of Jars-Xieng Khouang area would be to remove the prohibition against 
bombing and to provide volunteer pilots to fly the Lao aircraft. He 
proposed that air strike missions would be flown selectively and only 
against specific pinpointed concentrations. Boyle said that he had not 
discussed these proposals with Phoumi and that he did not know what his 
reaction would be. He could preserve security by stationing volunteer pilots 
at out-of-the-way airfields such as Thakbek. While Ambassador Brown forwarded 
Bqyle's assessment to Washington, he emphatically disagreed with it. He 
assumed that the enemy would retaliate in kind to air attacks with bombs 
and that the government's airfields, depots, and population centers would 
be far more vulnerable to aerial bombing than would hostile targets. He 
also thought that T-6 attacks against the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang 
would not be effective because these areas were defended with antiaircraft 
artillery. He said that the use of napalm had a "particularly bad odor for 
Laos and the world generally." He did not want the United States to escalate 
the conflict and provoke retaliation upon Laos and Thailand, for which the 
United States would be blamed. "I think," Brown concluded, "we must accept 
fact that this war is going to be long and conducted under certain limita-
tions imposed by larger considerations."(51) 
In evaluating Baylets recommendations and Brown's reactions, Admiral 
Felt suggested that the American Embassy in Vientiane would contribute to 
the military effort if it would indicate that it was fully in support of 
Phoumi's operations--a remark that may have been occasioned by a belief that 
King Savang's proposal for the three-nation peace-keeping mission had 
originated in the US State Department. In an interchange of messages with 
General Boyle, Felt urged the PEO Chief to see Phoumi and to get him to send 
the Lao T-6/s against Communist motor convoys and supply dumps. On I March

Boyle reported that Phoumi would push the T-6 pilots to undertake such 
strikes, but he noted that Phoumi did not feel secure enough with his 
subordinates to issue positive orders and to take the necessary disciplinary 
action to see that they were carried out. It needs to be repeated again 
and again," Felt messaged the Joint Chiefs on 1 March, "that the only sure 
way to save Laos now is by successful military action."(52) 
In his 1 March message to the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Felt stated that 
the Kong Le-Pathet Lao-Vietminh forces had became strong enough on the Plain 
of Jars to attempt an offensive when they wished, most probably against 
Luang Prabang. Almost as CINCPAC visualized, the enemy probed the Phoumist 
force holding the Phou Khoun road junction on 6 March. Phoumits poorly led 
Mobile Group 2 yielded to panic, and the Reds gained the road junction town 
on 8 March, after which they quickly moved north and scuth to block the 
Vientiane-Luang Prabang highway for a distance of 55 miles. In the course 
of all-out efforts to support the Lao ground forces, the Lao pilots cracked 
up a T-6 in a landing accident at Vientiane on 11 March and lost two T-61s 
either to ground fire or in a mid-air collision on 12 March. During the - 
fight, the Laotians captured a member of the 925th Independent North 
Vietnamese Infantry Regiment, who admitted that North Vietnamese regulars 
were being employed as artillerists, truck drivers, engineers, and as other 
specialists in Laos.(53) Already shaken by military reverses, the morale 
of the Boun Own government dropped still lower because of political develop-
ments. .According to Phoumi, King Savang was prepared to accept almost any 
political formula for ending the war. Phoumi himself went to Phnom Penh on 
10 March to seek an accord with Souvanna Phouma, and the two men cautiously 
endorsed the idea of a 14-nation international conference to end the 
hostilities. Upon returnina to V4.entiane, Phcumi appeared desperate and 
could not be persuaded to go on a military offensive on any front. General 
Boyle reported that the military'situation was dangerously critical, with 
the Communists increasing pressure everywhere.(54) 
During the first two months of his administration in Washington, 
President John F. Kennedy made no revealing public commitments on Laos, but 
one of his associates recollected that the new President "probably spent 
more time on Laos than on anything else." Kennedy established an inter-
departmental task force on Laos, headed by Walt Whitman Rostow of the 
White House staff who later in 1961 would become Chairman of the State 
Department Policy Planning Council, and demanded daily briefings from it on 
the situation in Laos. At a White House meeting on 9 March attended by 
Admiral Felt, President Kennedy heard a program for action from the Laos 
task force and directed 17 actions. These actions included increased military 
assistance to Laos, with an especial effort to be made to increase the 
quality of leadership of the FAR and the size of the Mao force. Thailand 
was to be persuaded to provide Phoumi four Thai-operated 105 mm. artillery 
batteries. The PEO and the JUSMAG in Bangkok would be augmented with 
additional officers and men.

At tne same time tnat iJresident Kennedy was authorizing a far-reaching program 
of increased American involvement in Laos--a program that would be 
implemented under the code-name "Millpond"--his public allusions expressed 
hope that the war could be ended by negotiation. On 8 March, Kennedy was 
"hopeful that it would be possible to set up some procedures where neutral 
nations could guarantee the security of Laos and also isolate it from 
military pressures on both sides." In a reference to the Souvanna-Phoumi 
discussions at Phnom Penh, Kennedy emphasized on 15 March that the United 
States would resist external aggression against Laos but actually hoped that 
negotiations could provide "a genuinely independent and neutral Laos."(56) 
Upon his return to Hawaii, Admiral Felt urged General Boyle to persuade 
Phoumi to return to an attack before the enemy seized all of northern Laos. 
For the moment, however, Phoumi replaced some of his discredited commanders, 
directed his troops to begin preparations to dislodge the enemy from bong 
Kassy an Route 13, and then took off to escort King Savang an a seven day 
series of ceremonial functions.(57) The Lao government's military situation 
worsened each day. On 23 March, Vietminh assault forces spearheaded a Pathet 
Lao attack against Kam Keut, thus opening a drive into the Lao panhandle. 
On 24 March, Communist antiaircraft gunners on the Plain of Jars deliberately 
shot down the US air attache SC-47 that had been providing excellent recon-
naissance photos of Red activities. The only survivor was Maj Lawrence R. 
Bailey, an Assistant Army Attache from Saigon. At the end of iiierch, a 
professionally directed Communist attack decisively defeated the Lao govern-
ment forces at Tha Thom, thus driving the Phoumists back down Highway 4 
toward Paksane and ending a potential threat to Xieng Khouang. In this 
defeat the Lao air force lost another T-6 when the Thai pilot flying it 
crashed south of Tha Thom. (58) 
As the situation worsened in Laos, President Kennedy met with the 
National Security Council on 20 March. At this meeting, Rostow proposed 
to move a limited number of Marines into the Mekong valley of northern 
Thailand not to fight the Pathet Lao but to indicate to the Soviet Union 
that it had a choice between a ceasefire and negotiations or American 
intervention. Reportedly over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
who favareda stronger aation,the President accepted Rostow's proposal. That 
same day, CINCPAC increased the readiness of JTF-116 and directed the move-
ment of Seventh Fleet units to the Gulf of Siam. On 21 March, the 315th 
Air Division (Combat Cargo) began a three-day airlift of personnel drawn 
from Marine Air Group 16 from Okinawa to Udorn Air Base in northeastern 
Thailand, where the Marines were charged to develop a helicopter operational 
base and to turn over 17 HUS-1 (H-34) helicopters to Air America. Other 
"Millpond" actions placed PACAF personnel on temporary duty with the PEO in

Laos and the JUSMAG in Thailand. (9) In a major public Statement on Laos 
on 23 March, President Kennedy called attention to the large-scale Soviet 
airlift, the delivery of heavy weapons to anti-government forces, and the 
presence of North Vietnamese "combat -specialists" in Laos. He emphasized 
that SEATO was mindful of its special responsibilities. He said that the 
United States supported the goal of a neutral and independent Laos, a 
cessation of armed attacks by externally based Communists, and constructive 
negotiation which could help Laos back to independence and neutrality.(60) 
Before leaving Hawaii on 19 March to attend the SEATO Military Advisors 
Conference in Bangkok, Admiral Felt directed his staff to prepare a plan 
for a SEATO action in Laos that would include American, Thai, Filipino, 
and Pakistani forces. On this direction, the CINCPAC staff prepared and the 
Joint Chiefs approved on 29 March an outline plan for the administrative 
movement of friendly forces into key Lao cities to free Royal Lao forces 
for combat operations.(61) In crier to signify the gravity of the situation, 
Secretary Rusk went to Bangkok to .the SEATO Council meeting on 27-29 March. 
In these discussions, French reluctance to participate in a military opera-
tion apparently influenced the Council to issue a statement favoring 
negotiations and promising appropriate actions if diplomacy failed. The . 
British and Australians, however, appeared agreeable to participation in the 
implementation of SEATO Plan 5, with the result that the improvised "go 
along" CINCPAC intervention outline could be replaced with a stronger 
operation plan. (62) 
At the end of March while Admiral Felt was in Southeast Asia, he held 
conversations withGeneral Phoumii who wanted the United States to expedite 
delivery on all the support scheduled for the Ro7e1 Lao Arm and aleo wanted 
the United States to intervene ard help him. Felt urged, however, that 
the Laotians should ocanterattaolon their own and demonstrate that they 
would fight for their freedam.(63) While he was in Bangkok, Admiral Felt 
also discussed the employment of the unmarked B-26 Millpond aircraft which 
had arrived in Thailand. On 21 March the Joint Chiefs of Staff suggested 
that the B-26's be committed in an emergency with strike priorities to be 
supply dumps, enemy heavy weaponsiand transport, and close support for troops 
as third priority. Felt agreed that the B-26's should be committed in a way 
which would get the greatest possible shock effect, but he explained that 
all hands in Laos were convinced that it would be necessary to use the 
B-26's with bombs to break up Comtunist defense of the Plain of Jars.(64) 
General Boyle also asked Admiral Felt to consider the feasibility of equipping 
the helicopters that were being brought to Udorn with rockets and machine 
guns so that they could support Lao ground operations. After investigation 
Felt concluded that it would be impractical to arm H-34's because the 
advantages of suppressive fire would not offset the loss of lift capability. 
He wanted to rely upon the B-26's for armed air support.(65)

As April began the professionally directed Communist forces were every-
where victorious over the defensive minded Phoumists. On 3-4 April, Soviet 
I1-14's dropped Kong Le paratroopers west of Pang Vieng, establishing an 
immediate threat to the Lao supply line from Vientiane. This Communist 
attack occurred just as the American PEO got Phoumi to renew his own offensive. 
In Phoumi's air-ground maneuver, seven 0-47's and 14 helicopters, covered 
and escorted by four T-6's, lifted 640 men of Phaumi's 1st Paratroop and 
26th Infantry Battalions to an airhead east of the Communist defenses at 
along Kassy. This Muong Kassy offensive should have severed the Communist 
troops on the Royal Highway from their logistic support base on the Plain 
of Jars, but the vertical envelopment failed because the FAR troops were 
reluctant to engage the enemy. On the other hand, the Kong Le paratroopers 
who had dropped west of Pang Vieng made rendezvous with Pathet Lao 
guerrillas and, swarming out of the mountains, captured Pang Vieng on 22 April. 
As April progressed, the Communists launched attacks in the Lao panhandle, 
driving panic-stricken government forces to the Mekong at Thakhek. 
Intelligence available to the PEO revealed that the Communists were well 
equipped and well supplied: overland convoys from North Vietnam into Laos 
via Route 7 were running twice a week with average loads of 120 to 150 tons 
per convoy.(66) 
On 5 April Admiral Felt advised General O'Donnell and the other PACOM 
component commanders that the situation in Laos was approaching a crisis and 
directed them to be prepared to move forces into Thailand. As the situation 
worsened, the Thirteenth Air Force used 0-124 aircraft that were standing by 
at Clark Air Base to move a heavy radar Combat Reporting Center (CRC) of 
the 5th Communications and Control Group to Don Muang Air Base on 15-17 April. 
To provide air defenses for Bangkok, the Clark based 510th Tactical Fighter 
Squadron sent a "Bell Tone" detachment of six F-100 'S to Don Milang on 
16 April.(67) Effective on 20 April, Headquarters Joint Task Force 116 at 
Camp Courtney, Okinawa, and Headquarters Air Component Command JTF-116, 
were respectively redesignated as Headquarters SEATO Field Forces, and Head-
quarters Air Component Command SEATO Field Forces.(68) In an action 
planned earlier but held up until the Lao government formally requested it, 
President Kennedy on 20 April converted the PEO-Laos into the MAAG-Lacs, 
ordering the Americans at Vientiane to put on their military uniforms and to 
get out into the field with the demoralized Lao troops.(69) 
The Communist successes in Laos more than ever convinced Admiral Felt 
that the way to deal with the hostile forces would be with air attacks against 
their communications lines and logistics inside Laos. Except for the 
heartening ambushes made by Colonel Pang Paols Meo guerrillas in the central 
Laotian mountains, the Communists were operating their air and surface 
supply lines with impunity. Felt urged that air attacks with effective, 
conventional ordnance against hostile supply routes and similar fixed targets 
could blunt the Red offensive.(70) In addition to the American Millpond 
B-26's, the Lao Air Force had 10 qualified T-6 pilots, and the delivery of 
the final two T-6's on 26 April would give the Laotians seven of the armed

trainers. If necessary, sone of these T-6's could be flown by non-Lao 
volunteer pilots. (71) Ambassador Brown had earlier opposed any US action 
that would increase the risk, but on 23 April he asked the State Department 
for authority to use bombs if a ceaeefire could not be arranged or if the 
enemy threatened Vientiane or other major objectives.(72) That same day, 
the Departments of State and Defense authorized Ambassador Brawn and General 
Boyle to use bombs an the B-26's and T-6's if the enemy pushed toward 
Vientiane; they also authorized immediate moves to reinstate American aerial 
reconnaissance over Laos.(73) The reinstatement of air reconnaissance was 
not too difficult since PACAF borrowed an RT-33 photo jet from the Phillipine 
Air Force and began "Field Goal" reconnaissance flights from Udorn on 
24 April.(74) On 26 April, General Phoumi pled for authority to use bombs 
both to make the air effort more effective and to have a shock effect on 
the enemy forces. General Boyle and Admiral Felt endorsed the request for 
immediate employment of bombs, but Ambassador Brown was more hopeful that a 
ceasefire could be arranged and stated that half-measures such as bombs for 
the T-6's would be "wholly ineffective." At this juncture Brown did not 
want to commit the Millpond B-26's and he would not authorize the use of 
napalm. Admiral Felt now requested the Joint Chiefs to see that Ambassador 
Brown was directed not to interfere with military commanders once military 
action has been joined. Quite shortly after this, President Kennedy would 
issue a new directive more closely defining the relationship of a country 
ambassador with a theater military commander, but on 30 April Ambassador 
Brown instructed General Bayle that the Lao air arm would not be authorized 
to employ bombs.(75) 
At the highest policy level in Washington, President Kennedy's decisions 
on Laos were by all reports influenced by the failure of the American-
supported Bay of Pigs invasion of Communist Cuba that began on 15 April 
1961. When called to the White House on 20 April to confer with President 
Kennedy about the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation, former Vice-
President Richard M. Nixon would recall that the conversation turned to 
Laos and that he urged the President to take some affirmative action 
there, at least a commitment of American air power. Nixon remembered that 
Kennedy replied: "I just don't think we aught to get involved in Laos, 
particularly where we might find ourselves fighting millions of Chinese 
troops in the jungles. In any event, I don't see haw we can make any 
move in Laos, which is 5,000 miles away, if we don't make a move in Cuba, 
which is only 90 miles away."(76) 
President Kennedy was also said to feel that he had not adequately 
examined the plans for the Cuban invasion, and at the National Security 
Council meeting on Laos on 27 April Kennedy actively questioned the whole 
range of planning alternatives for handling the military crisis in Laos. 
As a basic position, the State Department's Laos task force, supported 
by Ambassador W. Averell Harriman who was at this time in the Far East on 
an inspection trip, reccrimended a limited commitment of American troops in

the Mekong valley. While they differed individually on some specific 
details, the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed on the fundamental proposition. 
that: "Any intervention with US forces in Laos, either unilaterally or under 
SEATO auspices, should be taken only after firm US governmental decision to 
the effect that the United States is thereby prepared and committed to succeed 
in its military intervention regardless of the extent of possible consequent 
Communist escalation; this is an unequivocal position which is fundamental 
to US military actions." When this meeting failed to reach common agree-
ments, the President accepted Vice-President Johnson's suggestion that 
individual written positions of the Service Secretaries and Joint Chiefs 
ought to be prepared. In New York City for a speech on the evening of 
27 April, President Kennedy visited General of the Army Douglas MacArthur 
who advised against committing American ground forces on the mainland of 
Asia and added that, if the United States intervened in Southeast Asia, it 
must be prepared to use nuclear weapons if the Chinese entered the conflict 
in force. He also reminded Kennedy that it would be politically difficult 
to justify intervention against Communism in Laos while rejecting it against 
Communism in Cuba.(77) 
Where the British had appeared earlier to be agreeable to an implementa-
tion of SEATO Plan 5, high level discussions at the end of April revealed 
that they were concerned about an automatic extension of operations on up 
to an engagement with Red China which was implicit in the wording of the 
plan.(78) To Roger Hilsman,who was Director of Intelligence and Research 
in the State Department during this period, the Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed 
to hold a "never again" determination to avoid a limited war on the 
continent of Asia and were demanding an advance commitment that if there 
was to be US fighting no holds would be barred--including the use of nuclear 
weapons.(79) For the military services, the situation was far more complex 
than Hilsman thought. Speaking of PACAF capabilities, General O'Donnell 
estimated that his air forces could successfully prosecute a small "small 
war" in Laos with conventional weapons but that a large "small war" against 
large, organized North Vietnamese or Chinese Communist forces could not be 
defeated with conventional weapons unless there were a "truly massive increase" 
in the size of the US Air Force and Army. Some progress has been made in 
improving Southeast Asian airfields, but there still were very few fields 
that would be usable for sustained transport operations or for Century 
Series aircraft. O'Donnell thought that national policy aught to recognize 
the military facts of life.(80) In a similar strategic analysis, General 
George H. Decker, DS Army Chief of Staff, was unenthusiastic about a ground 
war in Laos. The US Army could fight there, but because of terrain, 
communications, and possibilities for logistic support any conflict in Laos 
could evolve into a war which night mire down sizeable US forces. "This 
is the last place in the world," Decker said; "I would like to see . . . 
/ffs Forcei7 committed unless absolutely necessary . . . . If it were only 
The Father: Lao that were involved, there would be no problem. But 
undoubtedly North Vietnamese would come in and probably the Chinese Communists,

and when they do, it is hard to predict where our commitment would stop."(81) 
In response to a Secretary of Defense query on 31 March 1961, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff had been studying the question as to whether the United 
States should or should not employ nuclear weapons in a conflict with 
Communist China. The completed study approved on 9 June 1961 would recognize 
that with existing military capabilities the United States could not 
successfully engage the Communist Chinese with conventional weapons. Giving 
a well-rounded presentation, however, the JCS study enumerated the existing 
force deficiencies for a conventional war and recommended positive courses 
Of corrective action. (82) 
When President Kennedy and the National Security Council met on 1 May 
to consider the individual written responses from the military services, the 
government of Laos had already requested a cease fire and negotiations, but 
the Communists had not officially responded. The papers from the Service 
Secretaries and the Joint Chiefs 'were nevertheless said to have revealed 
many specific considerations unknown to the President. According to 
Presidential Assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., President Kennedy was 
?appalled at the sketchy nature of American military planning for Laos--the 
lack of detail and unanswered questions." In order to get a ceasefire in 
Laos, the majority of the papers seemed to favor a landing of American 
troops in Thailand, South Vietnam, and in the Lao panhandle (which at the 
moment had not been fully occupied by the Reds); if this did not produce the 
armistice, air attacks on Pathet Lao positions would follow. Schlesinger 
also recorded that the military proposals seemed to require 140,000 men 
and a potential employment of tactical nuclear weapons.(83) 
In the few days at the end of, April during which Washington was so 
closely examining its alternatives in Laos, the Royal Lao government was 
able to obtain some military assistance from Thailand and South Vietnam, 
although not as much as Phoumi requested. Marshal Sarit of Thailand had 
urged SEATO action from the time of the Kong Le revolt, and on 25 April he 
obtained his cabinet's approval fbr the commitment of Thai forces in Laos. 
Believing that the Communists would continue to drive on Vientiane pending 
ceasefire talks, Phoumi asked Sarit to commit a Thai regimental combat team 
(3,500 men) to recapture yang Vieng. Instead of this force, Sarit passed 
two Thai artillery batteries to Phoumi, who immediately attempted to send 
one of them to the defense of the village of Muong Phalane in southeastern 
Laos' Savannakhet Province. The Communists prevented the battery from 
reaching its destination and captured Muong Phalane on 3 May, thus preparing 
for their occupation of the important air strip at Tchepone after the cease-
fire took effect. In a recasting of its agreement to send a division into 
southeastern Laos in case the Communists became active there, South Vietnam 
dispatched a 150-man special force unit across the border into Laos. By-
agreement with Vientiane, the South Vietnamese rangers were free to operate 
on a security mission in a 10-kilometer strip inside the Lao frontier, and 
the special force unit was chiefly interested in guarding the entry routes

into South Vietnam. These rangers picked up remnants that fled Tchepone, 
but they reported that the morale of the Lao troops was so low that they 
would not patrol unless the South Vietnamese formed an advance guard. (8b) 
Perceiving the helplessness of Phoumi's troops to defend any major Lao 
population center, American observers in Vientiane were fearful that Phoumils 
nerve would break and that he would call for SEATO intervention, even though 
he had promised to consult with US officials before doing so. Instead, 
Phoumi took advantage of the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union and 
Great Britain an 24 April, calling for the reestablishment of the International 
Control Commission to supervise a ceasefire in Laos and then for an international 
conference of nations at Geneva. The proposal received immediate backing 
from Hanoi, and on 27 April the Lao government accepted the armistice, 
proposing that the ceasefire take effect on the following day. There was 
no response from the Pathet Lao, who were scoring victories; by 3 May, 
however, the Communist forces had accomplished their apparent military objec-
tives, and the ceasefire orders were issued from Sam Neua and Vientiane. 
Members of the Interational Control Commission arrived in Vientiane on 
8 May, but they would not be allowed to enter Communist territory for several 
days. As a matter of fact, neither the Phoumists nor the Communists would 
observe the ceasefire, even though the civil war was entering a phase of 
international negotiations at Geneva.(85) 
When the conflict in Laos appeared to be entering a negotiational phase, 
the US State Department examined the problem that had arisen between Admiral 
Felt and Ambassador Brown concerning the status of an American ambassador 
in a country in which active military operations were in progress. In an 
executive order issued on 3 November 1960, President Eisenhower had markedly 
increased the primacy of the US ambassador in a US country team by providing 
that he would have "affirmative responsibility" for all US country programs 
including military assistance, would keep informed of all US activities in 
the country for which he was responsible, and would report "promptly to the 
President as to any matter which he considers to need correction and with 
respect to which he is not empowered to effect correction."(86) On 29 May 
1961 President Kennedy dispatched a letter to each US ambassador abroad 
which informed them that they were in charge of the entire US mission in the 
countries where they served. The mission included representatives of all 
US agencies, but did not include US military forces operating in the field 
where such forces were under the coomnand of a US area military commander. 
Kennedy explained that the line of authority to military forces ran from 
the President, to the Secretary of Defense, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
and to the area commander in the field. "Although this means," Kennedy 
wrote, "that the Chief of the American Diplomatic Mission is not in the line 
of military comnand, nevertheless, as Chief of Mission, you should work 
closely with the appropriate military comander to assure the full exchange 
of information. If it is your opinion that activities by United States 
military forces may adversely affect our overall relations with the people

and government . . . you should probably discuss the matter with the military 
commander and, if necessary, request a decision by higher authority."(87) 
Under Secretary of State Chester Bowles had drafted the Presidential letter 
and ardently championed it as a means to insure that all US representatives 
in a foreign country would "speak with a common voice and are not played 
off one against the other by a foreign government." (88) In a circular to all 
ambassadors on 8 July, Bowles noted: "The President's letter makes clear 
that the Ambassador's decision stands pending appeal, if any, to Washington."(89) 
Under the new authority a US ambassador would not have operational control 
of US combat forces, but he would be kept informed of what they were doing 
and if he disagreed with the activity he was authorized to inform Washington 
where the Departments of Defense and State would make a decision on the 
matter. Moreover, an ambassador had the authority to contact the President 
directly if he disagreed with departmental decisions.(90) 
3. Diplomacy at Geneva and  Oontued Fighting in Laos  
One of the difficult tasks confronting President Kennedy and his 
advisors was to determine the exact nature of the Communist threat to South-
east Asia, which was changing from the old monolithic threat directed from 
Moscow and welding together the actions of the Soviet Union, Red China, the 
Vietminh, and the Pathet Lao. President Kennedy and his senior policy makers 
could see that monolithic Communism had been fractured, but the effects of 
polycenttism were only beginning to unfold in Southeast Asia. (91) It was 
clear that one of the basic causes of conflict in Southeast Asia was the 
deeply held ambition of Hanoi to unify Vietnam under Communist control. 
It was equally clear that the Soviet Union, Communist China, and North 
Vietnam did not represent a single sweeping threat to the world. But 
President Kennedy was familiar with Khrushchev's 6 January 1961 address 
"For New Victories of the World ,3ommunist Movement," and he considered that 
any weakening of US resolution in support of threatened Southeast Asian 
nations would tend to encourage separate Soviet pressures in other areas of 
the world and that unless checked "the aggressive ambitions of Communist 
China and North Viet-Nam?largely North Vietnamese in old Indochina, over-
lapping in Thailand, Chinese in the rest of Southeast Asia?would surely 
feed on one another." (92) 
One of the most difficult decisions to be made concerned the real 
import of Khrushchev's new doctrine of support for local insurgency in 
emerging nations which was apparently already being implemented in Laos. 
Shortly after he took office, President Kennedy secured a detailed analysis 
of Khrushchev's speech, which he circulated among top governmental officials 
with instructions to "read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest."(93) In a 
special message to Congress on 28 March 1969 Kennedy pointed oat that non-
nuclear war and "sub-limited or guerrilla warfare" had been the most active 
and constant threat to Free World security since 1945. He urged that the 
United States must seek to increase its ability to respond to limited aggression 
with non-nuclear weapons. Although the main burden of local defense against

overt attack, subversion, and guerrilla warfare in most areas of the world 
would have to rest on local populations and local military forces, Kennedy 
said that the United States would require strong, highly mobile forces 
trained to combat lesser forms of aggression, some of wham would have to be 
deployed in forward areas, with a substantial airlift and sealift capability 
and prestocked overseas bases to support them. (914) 
On the other hand it was possible to see in Khrushchev's address (and 
in the Soviet support for the Communists in Laos) a man who was driven by 
an impelling need to retain the allegiance of Ho Chi Minh in a developing 
split with Red China. On 4 April the Soviets broadcast exclusively in the 
Vietnamese language a message which stated that the major Soviet objective 
was to get an international conference on Laos and that a ceasefire, 
although not a "precondition" to the conference in the Soviet view, would 
create a situation favorable to negdtiations. This direct appeal to North 
Vietnam implied that Hanoi had the necessary authority to stop the fighting 
in Laos.(95) In a candid discussion of the Lao problem with the Indian 
ambassador later in April, Khrushchev reportedly said that the USSR had 
entered the Lao struggle to prevent Chinese involvement, explaining that a 
Chinese involvement in Laos might have caused the conflict to spread to the 
Taiwan Straits, raising the question of Soviet obligations to support China 
under the Sino-Soviet defense pact.(96) Early in April Peking urged the 
North Vietnamese not to agree to a ceasefire when victory was so close to 
the grasp of the Communists, but Hanoi apparently accepted the Soviet 
position, and on 24 April the Soviet Union joined with Great Britain in a 
call for an immediate ceasefire, the convening of an international conference 
on Laos to meet in Geneva on 12 May, and a request to India to reconvene 
the Laos International Control "ommission.(97) 
Although it appeared that Khrushchev might have compromised Soviet 
support for "wars of national liberation" in the case of Laos, President 
Kennedy and Secretary of State Dean Rusk got a mixed impression of Soviet 
intentions when they attended a summit conference with Khrushchev in Vienna 
on 4 June 1961. Khrushchev agreed with Kennedy's proposal that "we all get 
out of Laos," and their joint statement reaffirmed their support of "a 
neutral and independent Laos under a government chosen by the Laotians 
themselves, and of international agreements for insuring that neutrality 
and independence, and . . . the importance of an effective ceasefire." 
But while Khrushchev considered Laos negotiable, he was completely unwilling 
to regard Vietnam in a similar light. In conversations, moreover, Khrushchev 
stressed the historical inevitablity of the triumph of Communism and went 
around the globe pointing out countries that were ripe for revolution. He 
told Kennedy that the Soviet Union aught not to be blamed for all the disorders 
in the world, but he stated bluntly that he would support revolutionary 
groups in countries where it was possible to do so. Khrushchev was careful 
to say more than mice that he was not speaking for China. "We came away," 
Secretary Rusk said, "feeling that he looks upon what is happening in these 
underdeveloped parts of the world as an opportunity, as fertile ground . .

and he looks upon the kind of technique that they are using now as a way to 
jump over alliances, to outflank alliances like NATO."(98) In June at 
Geneva Soviet Minister Andrei Gramyko would shrug off any Russian respon-
sibility for continued Communist ceasefire violations in Laos with the 
explanation that, while the Soviet Union desired a ceasefire, the Pathet 
Lao, prompted by the Chinese Communists, were pressing for military 
advantages.(99) Even though indications such as these pointed to some 
flexibility in Soviet policy, Khrushchev's 6 January 1961 address looked 
more and more like a controlling Soviet policy. Referring to the address 
in 1962, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara would comment that in 
it Khrushchev "stated as clearly as any one has ever stated, to my 
knowledge, the strategy of the Soviet Union." (100) 
In the negotiations for the neutralization of Laos the Soviets had 
indicated that they would expect Prince Souvanna Phouma to head a coalition 
government which would include Pathet Lao representatives. The United 
States, on the other hand, was committed to Boun Gum's government and to 
the rightist Phoumi. Souvanna Phouma, moreover, had a reputation of being 
very close to the Communists. Americans found it hard to understand Souvanna's 
fond, familial relationship with his Pathet Lao half-brother, Prince 
Souphanouvong, and Souvannal,s insistence that the Pathet Lao were a group 
of Lao nationalists?who were only secondarily Communists and whose goals 
were similar to those of the neutralists.(101) As a matter of fact, 
responsible Lao officials tended to look upon the Chinese and North Viet-
namese as being Communists and the Pethet Lao as something else. Even though 
Prince Souphanouvong was obedient to Communism, Premier Phoui's Minister 
of Justice explained to an American in August 1959 that Souphanouvong had 
never lost his loyalty to the Lao monarchy. Indication of this had occurred 
in 1953 when the Pathet Lao-Vietminh troops approached to within four kilometers 
of Luang Prabang but turned back when Souphanouvong had promised to "cut 
off the head of anyone who attacks the royal city."(102) Ambassador Harriman 
met Souvanna Phouma when both were in New Delhi late in March 1961; Harriman 
was favorably impressed with Souvanna and recommended him to Kennedy for a 
position in a coalition Laotian government.(103) .Acting on President 
Kennedy's instructions, Lt General James M. Gavin (US Army-Ret.) the US 
ambassador to Paris, also met Souvanna Phouma and determined that he was 
indeed dedicated to a "free, neutral, and independent Laos."(104) Possibly 
indicative of new thinking, an Administration spokesman would soon Observe 
the lesson from Laos was that "anticommunism is not enough for men to live 
or die for."(105) 
The Communist success, the failure of SEATO to respond, and the 
prospects for neutralizing Laos troubled both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and 
the free Southeast Asian nations. On 12 April the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
forwarded a memo to the Secretary of Defense which concluded that from a 
military point of view any political solution involving the establishment of 
a neutral government in Laos could result in great military disadvantages. 
They also supplied the Secretary with a list of measures which would aid in

counteracting the adverse military implications of a political settlement 
in Laos.(106) If Laos were dragged behind the Iron Curtain, General Lyman 
L. Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pointed out, it would 
expose the frontiers of Thailand and South Vietnam to Communist infiltration. 
During a visit to Southeast Asia, Lemnitzer had learned that most of the 
12,000 Vietcong guerrillas operating in South Vietnam had recently come 
down through the Lao panhandle and had infiltered across the western border 
of Vietnam.(107) In Thailand, Marshal Sarit was reported to be considering 
a more neutral foreign policy and an offer of foreign aid from the Soviet 
Union. Thai officials complained that US aid was proportionate;y less for 
their country than for Cambodia. (108) In Phnom Penh, Sihanouk told the US 
ambassador the Communist agents and guerrillas from North Vietnam were using 
the thinly populated northeast corner of Cambodia as a corridor from Lace 
into South Vietnam. Sihanouk was attempting to move additional Cambodian 
troops to his northern border and said that it was inportant to establish 
International Control Commission posts in the area to observe Communist 
movements.(109) When he visited Southeast Asia early in May 1961, General 
Earl G. Wheeler, US Army Chief of Staff, observed that America's friends 
had a feeling of "almost despair . . . with respect to the situation in 
Laos ."(110) 
To reassure America's friends, President Kennedy sent Vice-President 
Johnson to Southeast Asia in May 1961 with letters assuring the Asian leaders 
of continuing and increased US support. Johnson stopped first in Saigon, 
where he met with President Diem. He next visited Manila, where a joint 
communique with President Carlos Garcia announced "complete agreement on 
the seriousness of the situation in Southeast Asia." On 14 May, Johnson 
flew to Taipei for consultations with President Chiang Kai-shek and then on 
16 May to Bangkok for talks with Field Marshal Sarit about the situation 
in Laos. In his trip report to President Kennedy, Johnson recommended: 
"Ally help, economic as well as military, we give less developed nations to 
secure and maintain their freedom must be a part of a mutual effort. These 
nations cannot be saved by United States help alone. To the extent the 
Southeast Asian nations are prepared to take the necessary measures to make 
our assistance effective, we can be and we must be unstinted in our 
assistance." (iii) 
In preliminary sessions of the 14-nation International Conference for 
the Settlement of the Laotian Conflict beginning at Geneva an 12 May 1961, 
the Soviets insisted that Pathet Lao representatives be seated along with 
representatives of the Boun Own and Souvanna Phouma governments. Secretary 
Rusk opposed this as tantamout to recognition of the rebels, but an 15 May 
the conference agreed to seat all three Lao groups as ',spokesmen" for the 
forces operating in Laos thus preparing for the beginning of plenary conference 
sessions an 16 May. On 17 May the United States and the Soviet Union proposed 
that all foreign troops be withdrawn from Laos, but the Soviets proposed 
that the International Control Commission should be governed by a rule of

unanimity and also that it act only on instructions of Great Britain and the 
Soviet Union as co-chairman of the conference. The United States opposed 
this as giving the Soviet Union a "double-barreled veto.-" In his major 
presentation on 17 May, Secretary Rusk stated that a broad outline for the 
settlement of the Lao problem must include three separate points: "First: 
A definition of the concept of neutrality, as it applies to Laos, which all 
of us gathered here could pledge ourselves to respect. This definition must 
go beyond the classical concept of nonalinement and include positive assurance 
of the integrity of the elements of national life. Second: The development 
of effective international machinery for maintaining and safeguarding that 
neutrality against threats to it from within as well as without. Third: 
Laos will need, if it wishes to take its place in the modern world, a 
substantial economic and technical aid' program. We believe that such aid 
could be most appropriately administered by neutral nations from the area 
and that it should be supported by contributions from many states and 
agencies. "(112) 
At the summit in Vienna, Kennedy and Khrushchev endorsed a concept of 
neutral and independent Laos much like the status of Burma or Cambodia and 
recognized the need for an effective cleasefire.(113) This concept was not 
acceptable to Communist China's Foreign Minister Chen Yl who stated at Geneva 
on 12 June that Red China would "never be a party to . . . enforcing an 
international condominium over Laos in the name of international control over 
its neutrality."(114) There were two other difficulties confronting the 
Kennedy-Khrushchev concept. Although the three Laotian Princes--Boun Oum, 
Souvanna Phouma, and Souphanouvong--professed harmony when they met at 
Zurich on 21 June, they made no progress in agreeing about the exact details 
of a Laotian coalition government.(115) The Communist rebels in Laos showed 
no inclination to respect a ceasefire while the Royal Lao Army was being held 
generally to a defensive. The Communists had started an artillery attack 
against a Meo mountain position at Padang a few miles south of the Plain of 
Jars on 22 April. When the artillery continued after the ceasefire, three 
Lao T-613 made a strafing mission against the guns on 26 May. This mission 
and other support was ineffective, and on 7 June Padang had to be evacuated. 
On 12 June, following three days of attack, Kong Le/Pathet Lao infantry 
forced the retreat of Lao Army units farther toward Paksane, and on 14 June 
the Red forces captured two villages in the Paksane area. When Padong fell, 
the US delegation temporarily boycotted the Geneva negotiations, but it soon 
returned Without altering the situation or obtaining an effective ceasefire. 
(116) Despite the best efforts of the United States and the Republic of 
Vietnam to get the Vietnam ICC to go to Hanoi and stop the traffic, the Soviet 
IL-14's continued to airlift military supplies from Hanoi into Laos, now 
increasingly to the airhead of Tchepane.(117) Beginning in April when he 
visited Hanoi, Souvanna Phouma had signed a number of economic and cultural 
agreements with North Vietnam, including one which permitted the North Viet-
namese to run trucks with construction workers and materials into Pathet Lao/ 
Kong Le territory. There was no control over this privileged traffic, which 
was, of course, free to transport military supplies.(118)

On 24 June, the Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded a memorandum to the 
Secretary of Defense stating that if the current trend at Geneva continued 
the result would be a Laos more Communist than neutral. They therefore 
recommended that Secretary McNamara should seek high governmental decision 
that in the event of the next proven Communist ceasefire violation the United 
States should withdraw its delegation from the Geneva conference and under-
take military operations into Laos through SEATO, or with the SEATO members 
who would participate, or if necessary unilaterally.(119) With the dry season 
in Laos approaching without any substantial accomplishments at Geneva, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterated an 7 September that the United States must 
take immediate and positive action to prevent a Communist takeover in Laos 
and the ultimate loss of Southeast Asia. In further planning, the Joint 
Chiefs still wanted a SEATO type intervention or a variation of such a plan, 
which could include South Vietnamese forces.(120) 
Showing good faith toward the Laotian ceasefire the United States had 
suspended the RT-33 Field Goal photo reconnaissance flights over Laos on 
10 May 1961, and Project Field Goal was withdrawn from Udorn to Don Muang, 
where the flight crew flew photo missions along the uneasy Thai frontiers. 
At the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Project Field Goal resumed 
photo missions over Laos on 4 October against several key Communist-held 
areas north of Vientiane, including Pang Vieng airfield and Route 13. The 
single RT-33 aircraft completed 32 missions over Laos by 10 November, and it 
observed hostile ground fire on four of the missions. (121) As a part of the 
same reconnaissance requirement but under a cover story that it was 
photographing flooded Mekong River lowlands, the Fifth Air Force, as will 
be seen, deployed "Project Pipe Stem" to Tan Son Nhut Air Field at Saigon. 
This project included four RF-101 aircraft, six flight crews, a photo processing 
cell, and support personnel. It began flights on 17 October, hurriedly 
flying 67 sorties in a 31-day operation in which it photographed assigned 
targets in South Vietnam, along the Laotian-Cambodian-South Vietnamese border, 
and in the Tchepone area of southern Laos. As a replacement for both Field 
Goal and Pipe Stem, another "Project Able Mable" with a detachment of four 
Fifth Air Force RF-1011s, flight crews, photo processing cell, and support 
personnel arrived at Don Muang on 6 November and took over the reconnaissance 
mission four days later. The RT-33 was now converted into a "Mail Pouch" 
photo courier which ferried film back either to a photo processing center 
which remained at Tan Son Nhut or on the Clark Air Base. Able liable was 
charged to provide immediate tactical reconnaissance to the MAAGs in Laos 
and South Vietnam and to meet intelligence requirements levied by theater or 
national level. (122) 
At the insistence of Ambassador Brown, Field Goal reconnaissance flights 
were required to operate at 40,000 feet or above, allegedly to avoid detection. 
Since the flights received ground fire, they had obviously been detected. 
On 4 November, Ambassador Brown further directed that no reconnaissance 
flights would be flown over the Plain of Jars and Xieng Khouang areas without 
his prior approval, and from 6 through 10 November he directed that no recon-

naissance would be flown over the Plain of Jars. At this juncture, Admiral 
Felt informed General Boyle that frequent reconnaissance of the Plain of 
Jars and Xieng Khouang was a military requirement and that Bayle would schedule 
the flights when he considered them necessary. Later in the month, PACAF 
was also able to secure an agreement waiving the arbitrary 40,000 foot rule 
and allowing the photo planes to operate at an optimum altitude in context 
with camera equipment and enemy defenses. (123) Despite the operational 
restrictions, the photography of the RT-33 and RF-101's revealed a large 
Communist buildup on the Plain of Jars, at Vang Vieng, Sam Neua, Phong Saly, 
and Tchepone. At the latter place, the Reds were building a very large 
logistical depot. The depots were being supplied by Russian aircraft and 
truck convoys. If the logistical buildup continued, the Vietminh would possess 
logistical support quite close to both the Mekong lowlands of Laos and the 
other battle area in South Vietnam. (l2)) 
When the American Program Evaluation Office in Vientiane was converted 
into a US MAAG on 20 April 1961, the United States assumed primary respon-
sibility for training and advising the Royal Laotian armed forces--
previously a cooperative endeavor with France. The arrival of American 
advisors at Lao troop units increased the morale of the Lao forces, while 
the helicopters operated by Air America increased the tactical mobility of 
the Lao Army and permitted it to hold many enclaves within otherwise 
inaccessible Communist territory. As a matter of fact, however, some time 
(111. was required to build the former PEC into a full-scale MAAG effort and to 
prepare the Laotian forces to absorb additional equipment that the United 
States could undertake to provide.(125) In the newly established MAAG Laos 
the USAF element was authorized a strength of 13 officers and five airmen. (126) 
In the US fiscal year MAP, the Lan Air Force was funded to receive 14 T-28 
Nomad ground-support configuration aircraft, with a scheduled delivery of 
not later than 30 June 1962. To be delivered at Bangkok, these more modern 
aircraft were to replace the T-6's in the Lao Air Force.(127) 
The immediate task of the new P03 team of air advisors which reached 
Savannakhet in September 1961 was to increase the practically nonexistent 
discipline, motivation, and operational effectiveness of the handful of 
Lao pilots who could fly T-6 aircraft. At this time, 12 Lao pilots were 
undergoing training in Thailand to augment the 10 T-6 pilots who were flying 
from the rudimentary airfield just southeast of the city of Savannakhet. 
This field had a 4,800-foot scd surface runway which was in very poor con-
dition, despite Laotian promises to rehabilitate it. Only about 16 miles 
away, the French Air Force continued to maintain title to Seno Air Base though 
they were now keeping it on standby status. By November 1961 the T-6 pilots 
were displaying greatly improved tactics, aggressiveness, and air discipline. 
Lao pilot training conducted in Thailand also progressed satisfactorily: 
12 pilots graduated in December 1961 and an additional 12 in February. 
Furthermore, two pilots graduated from a flying school in France and were 
assigned to fly Lao O-47's. As of 1 March, there were 39 qualified RLAF

pilots on hand, with an additional eight in training in Thailand. Still 
a part of the Royal Lao Army, the Lao Air Force--under the command of a . 
young flying officer, Colonel Thao Ma--was progressing, but its capabilities 
were limited. After a briefing during a visit to Thailand in December 1961, 
General O'Donnell had some doubts that the Lao Air Force would be able to 
operate the T-28's by the date when they were slated for delivery. (128) 
Through provident management, the US MAAG built up good stocks of most 
munitions and supplies to a level sufficient to maintain the Royal Lao Army' 
in combat for three or four weeks. The estimate of the military situation 
in Laos included two factors in favor of the Phoumists: the Kong Le 
Neutralists and the Pathet Lao forces were not getting along together very 
well, and the Meo guerrillas commanded by Colonel Vang Pao 
posed a constant danger to the Communists. 
Generally loyal to the Royal Lao government, the Meo tribesmen liked to fight 
and were at home in the mountains and jungles of northeastern Laos. The Meo 
troops forced the Vietminh and Pathet Lao to stick rather closely to the 
roads and highways. Because of the great success with the Meo people, MAAG-
Laos began to train and equip a guerrilla unit of Kha tribesmen who 
inhabited the Plateau des Bolovens region of southern Laos. The Kha were 
well disposed to anyone with military and economic aid, but they generally-
considered themselves inferior to the Lao and were far less willing to fight 
than the Meo. On the other hand, the Soviets had delivered large quantities 
of military supplies to the Neutrnlists and the Pathet Lao and the Vietminh 
had not only trained the Pathet Lao but encadred the Pathet Lao units. Thus 
while there had been a substantial increase in the capability of the Royal 
Lao Army after the ceasefire, this increased capability was offset by even 
greater improvements in the capabilities of the Pathet Lao and Kong Le forces. 
In the winter of 1961-1962, CINCPAC intelligence stated unequivocally that 
the Royal Lao Army could handle the Pathet Lao/Kong Le forces but could not 
stand successfully if these forces were spearheaded by the Vietminh forces 
known to be stationed in Laos. In the latter case, the Pathet Lao/Kong Le/ 
Vietminh were capable of taking Vientiane in 30 days and other major cities 
such as Paksane and Thakhek within two to four weeks.(129) 
Although troubled by ceasefire violations, the International Conference 
on Laos made gradual progress in working out acceptable agreements on the 
international aspect of the problem. By December 1961, the conference had 
reached a point where negotiations could not proceed until there was a 
coalition government in Lace that could speak for the entire country and under-
take the responsibilities and Obligations of neutrality and independence.(130) 
In the judgment of Ambassador Harriman, who assumed the duty as Assistant 
Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs this same month, the declaration 
of Laotian neutrality and implementing protocol that had been drafted in 
Geneva would serve US security objectives if they could be put into effect.(131) 
In Laos, however, Prime Minister Boun Oum and General Phoumi were opposed 
to participation in a coalition government with Souvanna Phouma and repre-

sentatives of the Pathet Lao. Asked to consider ways in which Boun Oum 
and Phoumi could be brought into line, Ambassador Brown remarked: "The . 
hard fact is that the sanctions we have available to us are somewhat like 
the atom bomb--too big to use without causing us almost as much harm as 
those to whom they are applied." In order to impress Phoumi without weaken-
ing the Royal Lao Army too much, Brown recommended suspension of further 
deliveries of military supplies into Laos.(132) While hesitant to hinder 
military assistance or refugee relief, the State Department suspended the 
$3 million cash grant aid payment to Laos in January 1962.(133) 
For a brief moment on 19 January) Souvanna Phouma got agreement from 
Boun Oum and Phoumi on a new coalition government in which Souvanna would be 
prime minister, and the US cash grant was restored. On 25 January, however, 
Pathet Lao/Vietminh forces began to direct mortar fire against a Royal 
Laotian position at Nam Tha, only about 15 miles from the Chinese border in 
far northwestern Laos. The mortar fire was directed against Nam Tha airfield 
where Phoumi, contrary to American advice, had been airlifting troops. 
Despite the ceasefire violation, President Kennedy expressed hope that a 
meeting scheduled with King Savang Vatthana on 2 February where the member-
ship in the new government was to be determined would not be abandoned. 
Boun Own nevertheless announced that he was breaking off negotiations until 
the Pathet Lao ceased their attacks. In view of the developments, the 
United States again suspended its cash grant payments in February, March, 
and April. But to get operating funds Boun Own released unsupported currency 
from the Bank of Laos, thus sustaining his government but greatly inflating 
the Lao price level. Angered by the impasse, Souvanna Phauma demanded that 
the United States and Thailand cease their military assistance to the Boun 
Oum-Phoumi government and threatened to abandon his conciliation efforts, 
leaving the other factions to fight out a solution.(134) 
Any action that the United States could take to hasten the establishment 
of a coalition government in Laos involved its relationships with Thailand, 
whose government was disturbed both by SEATO's lack of responsiveness and 
by a fear that a Neutralist coalition government in Laos would soon be 
dominated by the Communists. In a conversation in Bangkok in December 1961, 
General Wallop, the J-2 Intelligence. Officer of the Thai Armed Forces 
Supreme Command, had expressed the opinion to General OTDonnell that after 
the formation of a coalition government Laos would turn completely Communist 
within two to three years.(135) After discussions of the SEATO treaty 
relationships with Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman in Washington, Secretary 
Rusk issued a formal statement on 6 March 1962 noting that the United 
States, in accordance with its constitutional processes, would act unilat-
erally to defend Thailand against Communist aggression. Rusk reasoned that 
the obligations of the SEATO treaty were individual as well as collective and 
reaffirmed that the American obligations did not depend upon the prior 
agreement of all of the other parties to the treaty. (136)

In a Secretary of Defense Conference in Hawaii an 21 March 1962, Secretary 
McNamara discussed the military situation in Laos and the feasibility of . 
bringing pressure on Phoumi by withdrawing the US MAAG. Al]. of the military 
leaders agreed that the MAAG should not be withdrawn, because, as General 
Lemnitzer expressed it, this would be an "irrevocable step" that would hand 
Laos over to the Communists and have a devastating psychological effect on 
Thailand. In the course of the discussion, Secretary McNamara noted that 
he had not realized that the Vietminh/Pathet Lao/Kong Le forces were capable 
of taking all of the major Lao cities in very short order and asked for 
comments on what the United States could do in case the Communists resumed 
all-out fighting. Admiral Felt believed that Communist logistics would be 
overextended and vulnerable to Meo guerrilla attacks and to American air 
strikes within Laos against identified supply buildup points in key locations 
such as Xieng Khouang, Tchepone, Saravene, and the border passes. He pointed 
out that the air activity could be "a graduated response," which could be 
accompanied by movement of a task force headquarters to Vientiane, the 
deployment of US air units to Udorn and Don MUang, and the employment of 
US ground units to secure the urban areas 'of Laos and to release the Royal 
Lao Army for active fighting. General 0/Donnell and Admiral Felt disagreed 
on the capability of the Chinese Communist Air Force to affect an American 
air campaign. O'Donnell thought that the Chinese could move air units into 
North Vietnam and take out the airfields being used by the United States. 
Admiral Felt pointed out that Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers off the east 
coast of Vietnamand USAF air units deployed in Thailand could stop any 
volunteer Red Chinese air effort from North Vietnam before it could be 
effectively employed. Speaking of the climate of opinion in Washington 
against the commitment of US or SEATO forces into Laos, General Lemnitzer 
favored an ultimate strategy whereby Phcumi would regrcup into the Lao 
panhandle and defend a line running just north of Thakhek and Tchepone. He 
felt that if fighting were resumed the only US recourse would be "to 
continue to support Phoumi and make him fight." He remarked that he would 
like to see Phoumi begin to regroup his forces to the south, partionlArly 
those in the far northwestern Nam Tha area.(137) 
While the American military leaders were meeting in Hawaii, Secretary 
Harriman was in Bangkok in conference with Marshal Sarit, whose intercession 
might persuade Phoumi to participate in a coalition government. At a 
meeting with Phoumi at Nang Khai on the Thai bank of Mekong on 24 March, 
Sarit explained why it was advisable for General 'Mound to accede to the 
coalition. When Phoumi's response appeared to be argumentative, Secretary 
Harriman was reported to have interrupted and to have told Phoumi with 
"brutal frankness" that "he could not expect American troops to come to Laos 
and die for him and that the only alternative to a neutral Laos was a Communist 
victory." Harriman had further conversations with Phoumi in Vientiane which 
were described as having been marked by an "animated and occasionally venomous" 
atmosphere. During the trip, Harriman's assistant, William H. Sullivan, 
visited Souvanna Phouma at his "capital" in Kiang Khay and assured him that 
the United States was doing its utmost to expedite the formation of a coali-

Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 13 April that the United States, 
Thailand, and France were urging the government of Laos to negotiate for a 
coalition government, but he nevertheless remarked: "It is very hard to 
prophesy about what is going to happen in Laos."(139)

CHAPTER 4 
BUILDING COUNTERINSURGENCY CAPABILITIES 
IN SOUTH VIETNAM, 1959-1962 
1. Origins of the CINCPAC Counterinsurgency Plan for Vietnam  
One of the most successful Communist myths of the Vietnam war, successfully 
perpetrated in spite of the preparatory Communist aggression in Laos as early 
as December 1958 and the Lao Dong's directive for the initiation of revolution-
ary warfare in South Vietnam an 13 May 1959, would be that the conflict in 
South Vietnam was a civil war and thus an internal matter between the Vietnamese. 
This myth was demonstrably false. In explaining Hanoi's policy on 10 July 1959, 
Ho Chi Minh wrote: "1,101 are building socialism in Vietnam, but we are building 
it in only one part of the country, while in the other part, we still have to 
direct and bring to a close the middle-class democratic and anti-immerialist 
revolution." (1) In the progression of events, the Vietcong would also record 
that their revolutionary warfare operations began in late September 1959 when 
two ARVN battalions, searching for guerrillas in the marshy Plain of Reeds near 
the Cambodian border southwest of Saigon, were successfully ambushed and 
defeated by two companies of Vietcong troops. (2) Hanoi's policy directives, 
the buildup of NVA infiltration-support activities, and a marked increase in 
confirmed infiltration of at least 4,556 Vietcong oidremen into South Vietnam 
in 1959-1960 would make it evident that as early as mid-1959 at the latest 
Hanoi had declared war an the Republic of Vietnam and had committed its political 
and military apparatus to the struggle. (3) 
Among US authorities in Saigon the full dimension of the threat that Hanoi 
posed to the Government of Vietnam was obscured by an optimistic belief that 
with moderate American assistance President Ngo Dinh Diem's government had made 
substantial progress in bringing economic growth and internal stability to 
South Vietnam. Vietnamese national intelligence activities, moreover, were 
closely controlled by Diem for his awn political purposes, and there was little 
or no readily available basic intelligence from South Vietnamese sources 
relative to the specifics of the Vietcong threat, including such items as 
leadership, tactics, '!organization, logistics, or projected plans. (4) As a 
result of such factors, modifications of US assistance programs made in 
1959-1960 were not so much concerned with the internal threat inside South 
Vietnam as with the avert threat presented by Communist activities in Laos, 
particularly to the sparsely populated Central Highlands, closely adjacent to 
the Lao border. This was an area in which Diem had been intensely interested 
since 1957, when he had conceived a program for building nagrovilles" or 
"new communities" around Pleiku, Kontum, and Ban Me Thout with the idea that 
yeoman farmers would be settled there an new agricultural lands, thereby 
extending security into the area. Unable to secure American funds for the 
construction of roads and resettlement projects in the Central Highlands,

Diem nevertheless proceeded with such plans. By February 1959 he had 
established some 28 of the outposts, and an 7 July 1959 he announced an 
expanded program to create more of the "prosperity and density centers" in 
the exposed rural areas. (5) Although the United States did not support 
the Highlands resettlement activity, the US MAP was extended in the first 
half of 1960 to provide support for ARVN Ranger campanies, which the Govern-
ment of Vietnam indicated in February 1960 were necessary to operate on its 
borders as trailwatchers and commandos.  
pr the ARVN Ranger training 
center, initially at Da Nang and later au Trang, successful implementation 
of the program required US Army Special Forces training teams, with an increase 
of the size of the US MAAG to 685 persons. Over objections of North Vietnam 
to the International Control Commission, the United States accepted the added 
advisory strength an 5 May, and the US Army teams arrived during the month. 
At this same time, Diem established an ARVN Ranger force with a planned strength 
of 10,000 men. (6) 
In a first recognition that the US MAP efforts required revision in order 
to assist the Government of Vietnam in expanded efforts against the Vietcong, 
Admiral Felt initiated a Vietnamese counterinsurgency study by the CINCPAC 
staff in April 1960. Phrased in broad terms, this CINCPAC study called 
attention to the fact that successful Vietcong guerrilla operations were 
aggravating a spreading discontent with Diem's government that was already 
prevalent among Vietnamese intellectuals and to some extent among the laboring 
class. Nhen Felt received the study in July, he ordered preparation of an 
outline plan which he sent to Washington with a recommendation that the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff coordinate it with interested departments and agencies. After 
review in the Departments of State and Defense, the counterinsurgency plan was 
sent to Saigon for further development by Ambassador Durbrow and by Lt. Gen. 
Lionel C. McGarr, who on 31 August 1960 replaced General Williams as Chief of 
the US MAAG. Elaborated by the Vietnaft country team during the autumn and 
winter of 1960, the Vietnam counterinsurgency plan envisioned that the principal 
task confronting the Government of Vietnam would be the restoration of individual 
security, a task that would involve military,economic, and political reforms, 
many of which would not be palatable to President Diem. Other items recommended 
by Admiral Felt and General McGarr were not approved by Ambassador Durbrow. (7) 
The Vietnam counterinsurgency plan envisioned that President Diem should 
relax his direct control over the Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces (RVNAF). 
It recommended that the Joint General Staff be strengthened and that it would 
establish a joint operations staff with responsibility for developing national 
pacification plans. Military control would be exercised through normal command 
channels, but supreme authority in an area in which pacification operations 
were to be conducted would be vested in a senior tactical military commander. 
The US MAAG also believed that Vietnamese military and paramilitary forces 
should be placed under one control and that the ARVN strength should be increased 
from 150,000 to 170,000 -- 15,000 of the additional men to be organized into

added infantry, ranger, and marine units and the other 5,000 to be used for 
increased logistic support for ARVN and for the assumption of logistic support 
for the Civil Guard. In October 1960 General McGarr and Admiral Felt recom-
mended the proposed ARVN strength increase through military channels in 
Washington, but Ambassador Durbrow opposed the increase for economic reasons 
and it remained under study. In November 1960, however, the Vietnam Civil 
Guard was transferred from the Ministry of Interior to the Ministry of Defense, 
and in early December the US MAAF became responsible for providing it with 
training and equipment. Because of shortages of MAP funds the US MAAG was 
able to program immediate support for only 32,000 of the 68,000 members of the 
Civil Guard. (8) 
In a general description of the US MAP support for the Republic of Vietnam 
up through 1961, Maj. Gen. Theodore R. Milton, Commander, Thirteenth Air Force, 
would note that it was "entirely dominated by classic ground-force thinking." 
(9) When sustained interest focused on the VNAF it was seen to be limited by 
lack of trained pilots, technically qualified support personnel, and obsolescing 
aircraft. In August 1959 President Diem worsened VNAFIs limited personnel 
situation when he terminated contracts with French aircrews and service personnel 
who operated the Air Vietnam commercial airline and replaced the Frenchmen with 
flight crews and mechanics drawn from VNAF. (10) Also in August the VNAF Com-
mander, Colonel Vinh demonstrated his dissatisfaction with the long obsolete 
F8F fighters in his 1st Fighter Squadron by grounding all of them after a 
mysterious crash which appeared to have been staged. In September 1969 the 
Government .of Vietnam stated a requirement for jet aircraft to replace the 
F8Fs, pointing out that the United States had provided jets to Thailand and 
the Philippines. In sympathy with the requirement, Admiral Felt got two T-33 
trainers and four RT-33 photo aircraft included in FY 1961 MAP funding for 
VNAF. These jet versions of the old USAF Shooting Star F-80 fighter promosed 
to provide VNAF a beginning of jet capabilities, as well as an initial recon-
naissance force. As replacements for the R8Fs in FY-1961 MAP funding, VNAF 
was first programmed to receive AD-4s from US Navy stocks, but upon further 
study the Navy could not forecast continued supply support for these obsolete 
planes. As a result the program objective was amended early in 1960 to include 
25 AD-6 aircraft, a type of aircraft still operational in US fleet units, and 
which would be redesignated several years later as A-IHs. The first six of the 
AD-6s arrived in Vietnam in September 1960, and the last of the 25 planes 
would be delivered on 22 May 1961. As will be seen the RT-33s were pledged to 
VNAF in MAP commitments, but they would not be delivered because of the Geneva 
prohibition against jet aircraft. (11) Late in 1960, when some of the new 
ARVN: ranger units were ready for field employment, the US Office of Secretary 
of Defense recognized that the H-19B helicopters handed down by the French to 
the VNAF 1st Helicopter Squadron were worn out and gave approval for an 
expedited delivery of 11 H-34C helicopters to Vietnam, the machines being 
obtained from the US Army and airlifted to Saigon without renvation, the first 
four in December 1960 and the others a little later. (12) 
Arrival of the more modern AD-6s and H-34s did not immediately benefit 
VNAF capabilities. Poor maintenance and supply support at Bien Hoa and a

long pipeline time required to process spare parts requisitions to Army and 
Navy sources through Air Force Logistical Command MAP channels caused excessive 
aircraft-out-of-commission rates, and the tupply support for AD-6s and H-34s 
would not begin to catch up with requirements until late 1961. Meanwhile, in . 
the three months of August through October, the 1st Fighter Squadron flew 20 
combat sorties, the L-19 liaison planes 917 combat hours, the H-19s made 166 
hours on operational missions, while the C-47 transport group flew 32 operational 
sorties. (13) Based in the Saigon area and rigidly controlled by President 
Diem and the Joint General Staff, VNAF units had virtually no country-wide 
operating capability in these months in which the Vietcong were expanding their 
attacks throughout South Vietnam. A PACAF survey team reported: "The high 
level approval required for on-call.fighter strikes, along with poor communica-
tions and/or procedures for requesting strikes, builds in excessive delays for 
efficient use of tactical air effort. This is particularly true in view of the 
hit and run guerrilla tactics of the Viet Cong." (14) 
In Hanoi on 10 September 1960 the Third National Conference of the Lao Dong 
Party announced the objective of forming in South Vietnam "a broad national 
united front" of workers, peasants, and soldiers that would overthrow President 
Diem, and the tempo of Vietcong insurgency and infiltration quickened after this 
new manifestation of Communist intention. In base areas around Saigon hard-core 
Vietcong strength reached an estimated 4,000 men, and the Vietcong units were 
able to mount raids with 100 to 300 men.- In October the Government of Vietnam 
charged that attacks in the Kontum-Pleiku area involved regular NVA units 
operating out of Laos, thus constituting avert aggression. (15) The apparent 
Nue inability of the Diem government to deal with the Vietcong insurgency sparked 
dissatisfaction within the Vietnamese Amy, and in a surprise coup attempt on 
11 November 1960 a paratroop force led by Colonel Nguyen Van Thi seized. most 
of the key government centers in Saigon and prepared to attack the Presidential 
palace. The leaders of this attemptea military coup called for Diem's resigna-
tion, citing his autocratic rule, nepotism, and inability to save the country 
from Communism. The leaders made no effort to seek support of disaffected 
civilians, and the coup was put down on 12 November when Brig. Gen. Nguyen Khanh, 
Chief of Staff of the Joint General Staff, led loyal troops into the capital 
and subdued the rebels. (16) 
In the wake of the November 1960 coup attempt, Diem's brother and political 
advisor, Ngo Dinh Nhu, announced that the Diem government would introduce far-
reaching reforms in South Vietnam, but as it happened both Diem and Nhu emerged 
from the crisis more reluctant than ever to decentralize authoritarian controls. 
Instead of providing the independent military authority which Admiral Felt and 
General McGarr wanted for counterinsurgency operations, Diem intended to secure 
his position where possible by pitting one officer against another within the 
military hierarchy. Moreover, Nhu would continue to believe that US officials 
in Saigon had been involved in the attempted coup, and relations between 
Ambassador Durbrow and Diem became very difficult after November 1960. Although 
Nhu's suspicions were groundless, US military advisors observed and reported

continuing manifestations of RVNAF discontent with the Diem government. An ' 
Air Force officer, Who served with the MAAG in 1960-1961, noted that hope 
built up with many VNAF officers when Diem promosed reform after the 1960 
coup attempt but then waned as Diem failed to produce the promised liberaliza-
tion of his government. On several separate occasions during the autumn of 
1961 US representatives in South Vietnam would be approached by military 
leaders, who sought to determine the prospective American reaction to a coup 
attempt against Dim. (17) 
The Communist politburo in Hanoi apparently viewed the November 1960 coup 
against Diem as an evidence of massive dissatisfaction within the RVNAF and 
moved quickly, although with some confusion, to establish the promised Shadow 
government in South Vietnam. Announced as having been formed on 20 December 
1960, the National Front for Liberation of Vietnam (NLF) was said to include 
a broad range of non-Communist and nationalist opposition to Diem. Under the 
NLF facade the Lao Dong Party would continue to direct the insurgency, but in 
a further move to obscure Hanoi's control late in 1961 the southern branch of 
the Lao Dong party would be renamed the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP). 
The .PRP immediately volunteered its support to the NLF and was organized on 
lines exactly parelleling the NLF hierarchical structure. And instructions 
from the Provincial Committee of the Lao Dong party in South Vietnam's 
Ba Xuyen province issued on 7 December 1961 explained: "The People's Revolu-
tionary Party has only the appearance of an independent existence; actually 
our party is nothing but the Lao Dong Party of Viet-Nam, unified from North 
to South, under the direction of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, 
the chief of which is President Ho." President Diem would obtain a copy of 
these instructions and would ?end it to President John F. Kennedy with the 
observation: "Here at last is a public admission of what has always been 
cloar -- that the Viet Cong campaign against my people is led by communists." 
Under Hanoi's overarching command and the NLF nationalist facade, the People's 
Revolutionary Party culminated in a standing committee of high ranking members 
known as the Central Office for South Vietnam (COSVN), and COSVN would provide 
local direction to the insurgency in South Vietnam. (18) 
2. President Kennedy Expands Assistance to Vietnam  
When President Kennedy took office on 20 January 1961 the subversive effort 
against South Vietnam was well underway, but the situation in Laos was deterio-
rating even more rapidly and for a time overshadowed the problem in South 
Vietnam although, of course, the new US national planners recognized that Laos 
and Vietnam were intimately related. Following a briefing of the US counter-
insurgency plan for Vietnam, President Kennedy approved it in principle on 
30 January and agreed that the United States would support the proposed 20,000 
man increase in the RVNAF and expanded military training for the Civil Guard. 
During the next several months, however, the International Security Agency 
of OSD would be unable to determine a proper source for the additional MAP

funds that would be required to support the added Vietnamese forces, and 
any implementation of the broad aspects of the counterinsurgency plan would 
require actions that President Diem was going to be reluctant to order. (19). 
Although President Kennedy's attention was momentarily diverted from Vietnam, 
he was greatly impressed with the threat posed by Communist insurgency in 
developing nations. On 1 February he directed Secretary of Defense Robert S. 
McNamara to examine ways of placing more emphasis upon the development of 
American counterinsurgency forces. At this time there were no US forces 
especially prepared to conduct operations against insurgents; even the US 
Army Special Forces were principally trained to conduct offensive guerrilla 
warfare in support of conventional military operations. Two other Presidential 
actions followed the Bay. of Pigs invasion and placed the Department of Defense 
in the business of paramilitary activity. In June 1961 Kennedy issued a 
National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) stating that the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff had na responsibility for the defense of the nation in the cold war 
similar to that which they have in conventional hostilities." Another NSAM 
in July 1961 stated that any large paramilitary operation, wholly or partly 
covert, that required significant numbers  of militarily trained personnel, 
amounts of equipment that exceeded normal stocks, or military 
experience of a kind and level peculiar to the Armed Services, would properly 
be a primary responsibility of the Department of Defense, 
During the early months of 1961 the Vietcong redoubled their campaign 
of terror in an effort to disrupt South Vietnamese presidential elections 
scheduled for 9 April. The number of hard-core Vietcong estimated to be in 
South Vietnam increased to 14,000, and in March General Nguyen Khanh stressed 
to an American observer that the NVA forces in southern Laos had become strong 
enough to push over the border and set up a "popular" government in the 
Central Highlands any time that this would be politically desirable. If the 
Communists did this, Khanh speculated that the Sino-Soviet bloc would follow 
the technique used in Laos by recognizing the shadow regime as the legitimate 
government of South Vietnam and providing assistance to it. Renewing his 
interest in Vietnam in the course of public addresses delivered in April, 
President Kennedy expressed concern that well-disciplined Vietcong guerrillas, 
organized and sustained by North Vietnamese support from across South Vietnam's 
borders, had assassinated over 4,000 civil officers, 2,000 state employees, 
and 2,000 police during 1960. (21) 
After 9 April, when President Diem and Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho 
received an overwhelming majority in the South Vietnamese election, the US 
Embassy was able to present the CINOPIC counterinsurgency plan, with its

asked by the Americans, at least on paper. He reactivated a National 
Internal Security Council, established a National Intelligence Agency, and 
appointed Maj. Gen. Duong Van Minh as Commander ARVN Field Forces, with

instructions to work with General McGarr in counterinsurgency planning. 
Other directives inactivated former military regional headquarters and 
replaced them with three ARVN corps tactical zones and one Saigon divisional 
tactical zone. The tactical zone commanders were made responsible for con-
ducting all anti-guerrilla military operations in coordination with the 
aovernmentis psychological and political campaigns. Diem accomplished the 
minimum organizational actions recommended in the CINCPAC plan, but he was 
in no hurry to implement a national counterinsurgency plan or campaign. (22) 
. In April President Kennedy set up an interagency Vietnam Task Force 
headed by Deputy Secretary of Defense, Roswell L. Gilpatric, to determine 
the need for additional measures in support of Vietnam, and an 21 April, he 
named Frederick E. Nolting, Jr., who had been counsul general in Paris, as 
Ambassador to Vietnam, vice Ambassador Durbrow. At a National Security 
Council meeting on 29 April, Kennedy approved several measures recommended 
by the Gilpatric task force. These included the establishment of a combat 
development and test center in Vietnam, expansion of civic action and 
economic development programs, the augmentation of the 685-man MAAG by 
approximately 100 military advisors as the beginning of an expanded advisory 
effort, and a last-minute addition to the fiscal year 1961 MAP of a heavy 
radar facility to be sited near Da Nang where it was expected to observe and 
report Soviet flights across the Laotian border. (23) 
At a meeting with Chairman J. W. Fulbright of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee an 4 May, President Kennedy discussed the possibility of sending 
US. forces into South Vietnam, but on the following day, Kennedy told newsmen 
that this would not be appropriate until it could be discussed with Vietnamese 
leaders by Vice President Johnson, who would arrive in Saigon on 11 May. At 
the request of Secretary Maamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff nevertheless 
considered the possible commitment of US forces to South Vietnam and on 10 May 
recommended in favor of an immediate deployment of sufficient US forces to 
provide a visible deterrent, to release RVNAF forces from static deployments 
to undertake active counterinsurgency operations, to assist in training 
Vietnamese forces, provide a nucleus for US SEATO operations, and to indicate 
the firmness of US policy in Southeast Asia. Asked to give the Joint Chiefs 
an estimate of force requirements, Admiral Felt discussed the matter with 
his component commanders on 11 May. At this conference, General O'Donnell 
pointed out that South Vietnam was so deficient in airfields and ground 
environment that it could not accommodate any air strike force larger than 
a few rotational B-57s and F-102s which could operate frau Tan Son Nhut for 
short periods of time. In his response to the Joint Chiefs on 11 May, 
Admiral Felt recommended that forces sent to Vietnam should comprise a single 
US Army infantry division with appropriate supporting troops; 8 B-57s for 
border surveillance, close support and counter-VC operations; L. F-102s for 
?air defense; and possibly two or three jet reconnaissance aircraft. If 
American forces were sent to Vietnam, Admiral Felt recommended that the Chief 
MAAG be designated Commander, US Forces Vietnam, and that he would exercise 
control -- under CINCFAC -- of all American forces in South Vietnam. (24)

On 11 May President Kennedy directed that the Department of Defense 
would continue to study the size and composition of US forces which might 
be required in Vietnam in case the Diem-Johnson talks indicated a need for 
them, but he also asked for an assessment of the value and cost of increasing 
the RVNAF from 170,000 to 200,000 by creating two additional divisions for 
service in the northwest border region. The communique issued on 13 May at 
the conclusion of the Diem-Johnson talks agreed that the United States and 
thellbpublic of Vietnam would work together to augment the RVNAF and made no 
mention of a requirement for US forces. Upon his return to Washington, 
Moreover, Vice President Johnson did not envisage a need to commit any 
American troops other than training missions, and he emphasized that the 
Southeast Asian nations must make decided efforts -- with stronger support 
from the United States -- to develop their economic and political systems 
as well as to defend themselves. In conversations with Johnson and his party, 
however, Diem had been fearful that the Communists would employ the same 
strategy against South Vietnam that they had used against Laos -- infiltration, 
aerial resupply, and establishment of a recognizable government. (25) 
The Presidential program for Vietnam was sent to Admiral Felt and 
Ambassador Nolting on 20 May as 30 separate but mutually supporting military, 
political, and economic action items that were to be carried out on a priority 
basis with a sense of urgency. The political actions were intended to increase 
Diem's confidence in the United States, Diem's popular support in his own 
country, and to improve Vietnam's relations with its neighbors, particularly 
Cambodia. Economic actions included assistance for Vietnam's economy, as well 
as a determination of the ability of the Vietnamese economy to support larger 
military forces. The military actions included installation of a radar surveil-
lance system; immediate increases in the size of the RVNAF by 20,000 men; MAP 
support for the Civil Guard and Self-Defense forces, and necessary MAAG 
augmentations. In addition, studies would devise means to prevent enemy 
infiltration into South Vietnam, examine the prospects of increasing the 
manning of the RVNAF above the 170,000-man ceiling, and look toward establish-
ment of a facility in Southeast Asia which would develop and test new tech-
niques to assist the United States and South Vietnam in a joint campaign 
against Communist insurgents. (26) 
President Kennedy's 20 May 1961 program was designed to provide urgent 
assistance that would help the people of South Vietnam to help themselves, 
but the program had hardly been started before it began to be evident that 
the threat to the Republic of Vietnam was more severe than had been thought. 
At the Vienna summit early in June 1961, Kennedy found that Khrushchev was 
willing to accept a neutralization of Laos but would not include Vietnam in 
a similar agreement. Looking backvard upon Khrushchev's grim refusal at 
Vienna to ameliorate the conflict in Vietnam, Secretary of State Dean Rusk 
would speculate that after the summit conference in June 1961 the United 
States should have put down "a lot of blue chips immediately" to head off

"the other side" and to have said: "You can't have South Vietnam." He 
suggested that such action would have prevented misunderstanding within the 
Communist world regarding the United States position in South Vietnam. (27) 
Although both CINCPAC and the Joint Chiefs of Staff advocated and would 
reiterate recommendations for the deployment of US combat forces to South 
Vietnam, President Kennedy preferred to continue the actions ordered in his 
20 May program but to accelerate them in view of Vietcong successes. 
The original proposal for the expansion of the RVNAF to a strength of 
200,000 men had visualized that the additional personnel would form two more 
ARVN divisions, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff accepted a changed planning 
objective calling for "two division equivalents, including necessary Navy 
and Air Force augmentation." In view of the deteriorating situation in 
Southeast Asia, the Joint Chiefs recommended an 21 June that the increase of 
the RVNAF from 170,000 to 200,000 would be in the best interests of the 
United States. At this time Acting Secretary of Defense Gilpatric advised 
the state Department of the assessment but recommended that the increase not 
be initiated until the earlier 20,000 man addition was amalgamated. (28) 
To obtain a judgment on the economic ability of South Vietnam to support 
expansion of its military forces, President Kennedy sent a financial survey 
group headed by Dr. Eugene Staley to Saigon. In its report in July the 
Staley group favored additional aid for Vietnam, following three tenets: 
security requirements should have first priority; military operations could 
not achieve lasting results unless economic programs were continued and 
accelerated; and it was in the interest of both countries to achieve a free 
society and self-sustaining economy in South Vietnam. On 11 August, President 
Kennedy approved MAP support for a RVNAF of 200,000 men, but he directed that 
Diem be informed of the Staley committee's basic recommendations. (29) 
Plans for expanding VNAF followed Vice President Johnson's visit. 
It included MAP support for a second fighter squadron, a second helicopter 
squadron, a third L-19 liaison squadron, and a photo reconnaissance unit. 
In planning for the fighter squadron, USAF assistance thinking rationalized 
that the Communists had abrogated the Geneva accord of 1954 and that VNAF 
should be provided with F-86 jets rendered surplus by the conversion of 
American fighter squadrons to more modern aircraft. (30) In May 1961, 
however, OSD/ISA accepted a North American Aviation Company proposal to 
modify 100 excess USAF T-28A aircraft in an armed "Nomad" configuration 
similar to T-28B models, this despite USAF reservations as to the potential 
effectiveness of such modified aircraft. On 30 June, OSD funded the "Nomad" 
program and provided that 30 of the aircraft would be committed to Vietnam. 
(31) When OSD/ISA requested recommendations for providing MAP planes for a 
VNAF reconnaissance unit, the Joint Chiefs accepted the USAF position that 
the Geneva accord had been broken by the Communists and recommended that 
several T/RT-33 jets be provided. The Joint Chiefs also pointed out that 
the introduction of even a few jets into South Vietnam would result in an

expansion of facilities, ground environment, and "know how" that would be 
most valuable if US air units were subsequently forced to operate in the 
country. When the Secretary of Defense did not acknowledge the JCS 
recommendation, Admiral Felt asked 03D to secure State Department approval? 
for the introduction of photo jets into the VNAF. On 18 October, Ambassador 
Molting opposed this as a violation of the Geneva accords, terminating the 
MAP proposal for the remainder of the year. (32) 
Although Ambassador Molting opposed jet aircraft for VNAF, both he and 
Admiral Felt thought it imperative that the T-28s be sent to Saigon very 
quickly, well before the MAP project could provide the Nomad-modified T-28s. 
After review of possible sources, the OSD directed that the US Navy would 
provide 30 T-28Cs to VNAF. In an expedited action, USAF received these 
planes on the west coast of the United States and handled their transporta-
tion to Saigon, where the first 15 of the aircraft arrived on 15 December. 
(33) As worked out in MAAG Saigon With VNAF, T-28 pilots would be provided 
by upgrading Vietnamese liaison pilots to the fighter cockpits. Activation 
of the VNAF 3d Liaison Squadron at Nha Trang on 1 December was handled by 
discontinuing the Nha Trang training center and mustering instructors and 
L-19s there into the liaison squadron. Where the Nha Trang center had not 
been very efficient in the past, the action nevertheless meant that VNAF 
flight training would have to be accomplished in the United States. In the 
fiscal 1962 MAP, 12 additional H-34As were committed to VNAF, but it was 
obvious that VNAF was experiencing great difficulties with the 1st Helicopter 
Squadron and would find it very difficult to provide a cadre for the pro-
jected 2d Helicopter Squadron. (34) While the VNAF expansion plans were 
getting underway, the activity was complicated by a proposal advocated by 
high-ranking ARVN officers, including General Khanh, that the VNAF liaison 
and helicopter squadrons should be transferred to the ARVN and that the 
three ARVN corps commanders shoula also be given operational control of 
detachments of VNAF fighters and transport aircraft that would be based in 
their corps areas. (35) 
The problem of attempting to control border infiltration into South 
Vietnam had been under consideration some time before it was mandated for 
special study in President Kennedys program of 20 May 1961. Over 900 miles 
of South Vietnamese territory bordered on neighboring Cambodia, Laos, and 
North Vietnam. Three-quarters of the linear distance was in rugged moun-
tainous terrain and the remainder in the swamps and jungles of the Mekong 
Delta. Portions of the border with Laos and Cambodia had never been agreed 
upon. An early MAAF recommendation had favored the use of a large number 
of helicopters to patrol the border, but this proposition held recognized 
disadvantages in the number of helicopters that it would require and the 
absence of facilities for maintaining them. On 2 June the Joint Chiefs 
recommended that CINCPAC examine a?concept of aerial border surveillance 
with high-performance planes. In May 1961, incident to the Lao crisis,

the RVNAF established patrol bases and austere airstrips along the border 
of Laos and, from the experience, favored the use of roving ground patrols 
mounted from fairly large bases along the border. At the end of August, 
the RVNAF approved the reorganization of the border outposts in the northern-
most I ARVN Corps in accordance with, the patrol base concept. In October 
Deputy Secretary Gilpatric quizzed the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the 
feasibility of requesting employment of SEATO forces in South Vietnam for 
border control. The Joint Chiefs replied that this would place the SEATO 
units in a very vulnerable position, would grossly compound communications 
and logistical support problems, and would reduce but not stop VC infiltration. 
The Joint Chiefs also recommended that any real defense of Southeast Asia 
would include a concentrated effort in Laos where SEATO could take a firm 
stand, rather than in spreading out SEATO forces throughout Southeast Asia. 
(36) 
As a part of the expanding American advisory effort 
opened an enlarged Ranger Training Center at Nha rang 
October, the US MAAG proposed to employ 27 Ranger Companies and 39 ARVN or 
Civil Guard Companies, augmented by Montagnard scouts, to man 25 border bases 
from which aggressive patrols would operate on both sides of South Vietnam's 
borders to locate, harass, and ambush VC infiltrators. The plan required a 
c-47 landing strip at each border base and would necessitate increased amounts 
of air transport to provide logistical supply. General McGarr submitted the 
MAA 4 plan for using Rangers on border patrol on 8 November, and the RVNAF 
Joint General Staff accepted the basic concept an 13 December when it also 
directed the Field Command to prepare a final Vietnamese plan. ? di-
ately began to recruit and instruct 3,000 Montagnard scouts, bu e Joint 
General Staff proved to be in no hurry to commit the 5,000 Rangers that 
would be needed to initiate the plan. The JGS was reluctant to release 
Ranger units for border patrol until they could be relieved from posts in 
South Vietnam's interior by newly trained Civil Guard and Self Defense Corps 
units. (37) 
President Kennedy's requirement calling for the development of a South 
Vietnamese radar surveillance capability to warn of Communist overflights 
for clandestine supply or intelligence purposes "on a priority basis as a 
matter of urgency" did not promise to be easy to accomplish since VNAF had 
no aircraft control and warning capability. At Tan Son Nhut the VNAF 1st 
Radar Squadron possessed two light TPS-1D search radar sets and two TPS-10D 
height finders. This equipment had been in storage in Vietnam from 1954 to 
1958, when the VNAF had begun to try to use it for training. The 1st Radar 
Squadron had never controlled any aircraft, and many of the technicians who 
had received radar training in the United States were spread throughout the 
VNAF, often in jobs unrelated to their training. (38) In Washington, MAP 
funds were immediately provided for two heavy combination FPS-20/6 radar 
installations, most feasibly to be located at Tan Son Nhut and Da Nang, but

delivery of this equipment could not be promised until September 1962. To 
fill the interim gap and to provide immediate refresher training to the VNAF 
technicians, Admiral Felt requested and on 11 September the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff directed the deployment of a mobile combat reporting post from the 
507th Tactical Control Group at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, to 
Tan Son Nhut. Equipped with MPS-11 search and MPS-16 height-finder radars 
and manned to the CRP level with 67 people, the 507th began its airlifted 
movement on 26 September and completed the journey on 3 October. Even 
though all identification marks on boxed equipment had been ordered painted 
out and the Americans were not allowed to do any assembly work after dark 
the CRP at Tan Son Nhut was operational on the morning of 5 October. In 
addition to providing control and warning services, the 507th detachment 
immediately began training 37 VNAF technicians. Personnel of the detachment 
the first USAF unit to arrive in Vietnam -- were also pressed into service to 
supervise the building of a tent city, to meet incoming aircraft, and in 
general to facilitate the arrival of other USAF personnel in Vietnam. (39) 
Because of President Kennedy's penetrating interest in counterinsurgency, 
Secretary McNamara gave an extremely high priority to the establishment of 
a facility in Southeast Asia that would develop and test new techniques to 
combat insurgency. This interest engendered Project Agile, under the direction 
of the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). The 
establishment of a combat development and test center in Vietnam promised to 
be potentially overlapping with the legal functions of the US MUG, but, by 
29 June 1961, Vietnamese, Department of Defense, and MAAG officials agreed to 
establish a small center manned by research and development personnel within 
Headquarters RVNAF in Saigon, under the supervision of the Vietnamese Joint 
General Staff. This Combat Development and Test Center (CDTC) was given a 
direct channel of communications to ARPA on R&D matters, with information 
to be provided to CINCPAC. The small nucleus of ARPA personnel also served 
as a focal point for technical contract people who were sent to Saigon under 
the auspices of ARPA or the Director of Defense Research and Engineering. 
By 5 August, the CDTC had commended work on projects that included a chemical 
to kill the tapioca plant which was an important source of food for guerrillas, 
use of patrol dogs, and the use of Chemical defoliant agents to destroy jungle 
foliage in Vietcong assembly, ambush, and hiding areas. (40) 
As Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis E. LeMay was impressed with 
the imperative nature of President Kennedy's instruction on 3 March 1961 that 
the military services would examine their capability to engage in counter-
guerrilla operations and to render training assistance to developing countries. 
Reflecting back to Army Air Forces air-commando experiences in Southeast Asia 
during World War II, LeMay directed the Tactical Air Command to form a small 
unit that would have a capability to conduct selected covert air operations. 
Accordingly on 14 April 1961, the Tactical Air Command activated the 4400th 
Combat Crew Training Squadron -- nicknamed "jungle Jim" -- at Eglin Air Force 
Base, Florida. Under command of Colonel Benjamin H. King, the 4400th Squadron

was authorized a personnel strength of 124 officers and 228 airmen and an 
aircraft complement of 16 C-47s, 8 B-26s, and 8 T-28s. To man the organiza-
tion, Colonel King accepted Volunteers, most of whom described as "gang ho" 
individuals who were attracted by the challenge of unconventional air 
operations. (41) In August 1961 the Jungle Jim squadron was operational, and, 
after a study of the problem of interdicting infiltration into South Vietnam 
had been made by the Joint Strategic Survey Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
on 24 August informed the Secretary of Defense that since the Vietcongxere 
receiving their support from North Vietnam both by inland trails and coetal 
junks an interdiction of Communist support would facilitate military control 
of the Vietcong. In the event the United States did not desire to commit its 
forces openly, there were covert, unconventional, and guerrilla-type opera-
tions that could be made effective. (42) 
On 5 September, Secretary McNamara informed the departmental secretaries 
that he intended to establish an experimental command in South Vietnam under 
the MAAG as a laboratory for the development of improved organizational and 
operational procedures for conducting sub-limited war. On the basis of this 
information, General LeMay called Secretary of Air Force Eugene M. Zuckert's 
attention to the potentialities of the Jungle Jim squadron, and on 19 September 
Zuckert recommended to McNamara that a detachment of the 4400th Combat Crew 
Training Squadron Should be moved with C-47s, T-28s, and B-26s to Vietnam where 
it could serve as a vehicle for acquiring and developing experience in counter-
insurgency.operations, while at the same time contributing to VNAF training. 
(43) Secretary McNamara liked the proposal, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
recommended an 5 October that a detachment of the 4400th should be placed 
with the MAAG in Vietnam with a mission of training the VNAF and participating 
in research and development testing of counter-guerrilla techniques. (44) 
Despite the increased American economic and military aid that began to 
arrive in Vietnam under President Kennedy's 20 May program, the war continued 
to go badly for the Government of Vietnam. In June Ambassador Nolting reported 
an increase in Vietcong attempts to assassinate provincial chiefs and other 
intermediate-level government officials. Beginning an 20 June, the RVNAF 
mounted an elaborate triphibious campaign in the Mekong Delta, employing some 
5,000 ARVN troops, an airborne battalion, river boat groups, and combat air 
support. This ponderdus force easily entered guerrilla-dominated areas, 
but its results were temporary since there were no available paramilitary 
forces to control the area when the regular forces withdrew. (45) In August 
ARVN reported 41 engagements between its forces and the Communists. In 
September the Communists mounted attacks with forces of up to 1,000 men in 
Kontum province, and an 18 September an estimated force of 1,500 guerrillas 
overran and seized Phuoc Vinh, the capital of Phuoc Thanh province. Terrorist 
activity increased. A grenade was thrown into Ambassador Nolting's automobile 
in September. After the serious setbacks in September, government forces

undertook no major operations until 28 October. On that day they launched 
a planned ten-day operation against the Vietcong base area northeast of 
Saigon known as Zone D which progressed until an ARNN paratroop battalion 
ran into an ambush on 1 November, whereupon the campaign was cancelled. (46) 
Although established by President Diem on paper, the RVM National Intelli-
gence Agency had been incapable of performing its mission, and the explosion 
of Vietcong insurgency in the swnner and autumn of 1961 was apparently a 
great surprise to everyone except the Communists. In October 1961 CINCPAC 
estimated that the Government of Vietnam fully controlled only about 30 
percent of the villages in the rural areas of the country. (47) In an 
address before the Vietnamese National Assembly an 2 October 1961, President 
Diem was deeply apprehensive. Speaking of the war, he said: "It is no 
longer a guerrilla war . . . . It it a war waged by an enemy who attacks us 
with regular units fully and heavily equipped and who seeks a strategic 
decision in Southeast Asia in conformity with the order of the Communist 
International." President Kennedy read Diem's speech, and he also took note 
of the stream of threats and vituperation against the Republic of Vietnam 
and the United States that was flawing night and day from Hanoi. In addition 
to the Communist problem severe floods on the Mekong River in mid-October 
inundated the greater part of three delta provinces, leaving an estimated 
500,000 people hungry and homeless. (48) 
In a consideration of the situation in Vietnam an the morning of 
11 October 1961, President Kennedy authorized US advisors to assist with 
counter-guerrilla operations against the Communist supply center at Tchepone 
in Laos and he directed deployment Of a detachment of the 4400th Combat Crew 
Training Squadron to South Vietnam, subject to Diem's concurrence and for 
the initial purpose of training Vietnamese forces. Later in the day, Kennedy 
also announced that he was sending a mission headed by his military advisor, 
General Maxwell Taylor, to Saigon to secure an "educated military guess" on 
the situation and to discuss "ways in which we can perhaps better assist 
the Government of Viet-Nam in meeting this threat to its independence." In 
his letter of instructions to Taylor, Kennedy stressed that the mission 
"should bear in mind that the initial responsibility for the effective 
maintenance of the independence of South Vietnam rests with the people and 
government of that country." The mission would be concerned with political, 
social, and economic problems as well as the military problem, and Walt W. 
Rostow was included as deputy to General Taylor. (49) 
President Kennedy's announcement that he was sending the Taylor mission 
to Vietnam produced immediate responses from the Communist nations which 
were in part predictable but nevertheless influential an American policy. 
On 12 October Chinese Communist Premier Chou En-lai warned that Red China 
could not "be indifferent to the increasingly grave situation caused by 
United States imperialism in South Vietnam." In the next several dayS 
Ho Chi Minh went to Peking to discuss the situation with Mao Tse-tung and

Defense Minister Lin Piao. The Soviet Union connected the Taylor mission 
with the flagging diplomatic discussions an Lacsat Geneva, charging that the 
United States was planning to send troops to South Vietnam in order to 
affect the situation in Laos. On 14 October North Vietnam protested to the 
Vietnam ICC that the Taylor mission was intended to "intensify United States 
intervention in South Vietnam and prepare the way for introducing United 
States troops." (50) In the words of one US diplomat, President Kennedy 
"was in a delicate and fragile phase of the negotiations in Geneva, which 
could be upset by ham-handed political or military moves in Vietnam." (Si) 
One of the problems at the time of the Taylor mission was to determine 
the exact military situation in South Vietnam. On 18 October, the day that 
Taylor and Rostow landed at Tan Son Nhut, President Diem proolaimed a state 
of national emergency throughout South Vietnam. In private discussions, 
Diem asked Taylor for a bilateral defense treaty with the United States and 
for deployment of US combat troops to South Vietnam. In conversations and 
also in a letter to the International Control Commission on 24 October, Diem 
emphasized the international aspects of the Communist threat, the stated 
determination of Hanoi to "liberate the South," the massive infiltration of 
Communist agents, and the ruthless strategy of terror against the South 
Vietnamese people, women and children included. (52) In Diem's view the 
major Communist threat to South Vietnam was the likelihood that the Vietcong 
would establish a "liberated territory" in the central reaches of the Republic. 
This was a possibility, but CINCPAC intelligence assessments had begun to 
question it after 1 October and to assert instead that the Communists were , 
seeking to consolidate control over the rich agricultural areas of the south, 
to isolate Saigon and the Diem government from the remainder of the country, 
and to keep the infiltration approaches to Laos open. (53) In order to 
provide needed intelligence coincidental with the Taylor visit, the US 
Fifth Air Force was permitted to deploy a detachment of its 15th Tactical 
Reconnaissance Squadron from Okinawa to Saigon, under the cover story that 
the men and planes would participate in the Vietnamese National Day Celebration. 
The cover story was abruptly changed to one of photographing the Mekong floods 
when Diem unexpectedly declared the national emergency and cancelled the 
National Day Celebration, but the Pipe Stem reconnaissance detachment arrived 
at Tan Son Nhut on the morning of 18 October, and began to operate its four 
RF-101 photo jets on tactical missions two days later. The planned 8-day 
operation was extended until 24 November, and the Pipe Stem detachment flew 
67 photo sorties against objectives in South Vietnam, along the Vietnamese 
borders, and up to the Tdhepone area of Laos. (54) 
In separate submissions of military actions to the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff before and during the time that the Taylor mission was in the theater, 
Admiral Felt outlined steps that he considered should be taken at once in 
South Vietnam. As soon as he was informed that President Kennedy had approved 
movement of a detachment of the 4400th COTS to South Vietnam, he recommended

that the Air Force should prepare 4 SC-47s, 4 RB-26s, and 8 T-28s for 
deployment without delay. On 18 October he recommended to the Joint Chiefs 
that the Pipe Stem reconnaissance flights be continued as long as possible, 
quick deployment of the Jun le Jim s adron d ta- ed delivery 
of the T-28s to VNAF, 00-4 
improvement 
of communications, ana aeployment or two US Army transport helicopter 
companies to Vietnam. He also urged that the airstrip at Pleiku be improved 
and that stores of ammunition, common equipment, and war consumables be pre-
positioned in Vietnam preparatory to a possible introduction of SEATO forces. 
On 21 October Felt validated a request that had been made by General McGarr 
for the deployment of six spray-equipped aircraft to Vietnam to be used for 
aerial defoliation and crop destruotion according to the concept worked out 
by Project Agile, favored by President Diem, and approved by Ambassador 
Nolting, provided the planes would be unmarked and the crews would wear 
civilian clothing. At meetings in Hawaii on 28 October, PACAF officers 
assured Colonel King, who would lei Detachment 2 of the 4400th Squadron to 
Vietnam, that there would be no major logistical problems in preparing a tent 
camp and other support arrangements at Bien Hoa Airfield. Thus reassured, 
CINCPAC asked that the detachment be sent to Vietnam immediately, without 
waiting for the Air Force to procure some desirable L-28 liaison aircraft 
for it or to configure the T-28s with Sidewinder air missile intercept 
capabilities. (55) On 28 October in Washington, Secretary Rusk was sensitive 
to the international implications of increased US military activity in Vietnam. 
He recommended that the USAF aircraft sent to Bien Hoa should be marked with 
VNAF insignia and arrive at Tan Son Nhut at staggered intervals in order to 
obscure the fact that the planes belonged to the same unit and to avoid 
getting the ICC interested in Bien Hoe. If need be, the arrival of the planes 
could be covered with a story that they were required for flood relief or 
else would be used to train the VNAF. Admiral Felt ruled out the flood relief 
story because the flood waters were already receding. He thought that the 
most valid explanation would be the overt Vietcong and North Vietnamese 
aggression, but he accepted the USAP recommendation that the detachment of 
Jungle Jim would have the unclassified mission of training the Vietnamese 
Air Force. (56) 
In an interim report to President Kennedy an 25 October, General Taylor 
described the Diem government as lacking confidence because of Vietcong 
successes and uncertainty in regard to the US policy in Laos. The South 
Vietnamese military was ineffective because of unreliable intelligence and 
unclear command channels. At this time Taylor suggested a number of actions, 
none entailing commitment of US military forces and all hinging upon an 
agreement on Diem's part to undertake reforms. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
generally agreed with the interim recommandatians but went on record that 
the United States should commit itself to the clear objective of preventing 
the fall of South Vietnam, including involvement of US military forces if 
necessary. (57) After accomplishing individual survey tasks, the principals

of the Taylor mission assembled at Baguio in the Philippines where they 
continued to receive information While they were drawing up a very long 
report for President Kennedy that was completed on 3 November. In addition 
to recommendations for political, governmental, and administrative reforms' 
by the Diem government, the basic thrust.of the report favored increased 
military aid and advisory support for a broadly conceived counter-guerrilla 
campaign inside South Vietnam. In this effort the United States should 
expand its HAAG into something approximating an operational headquarters in 
a theater of war, build up its military advisors to some 8,000 men, step up 
Vietnamese training, improve intelligence and communications, place more 
emphasis on research and development, and give quick military and economic 
support to limited RVNAF offensive operations. In addition to the use of 
US military units for combat support tasks, the report mentioned an alter-
native deployment of possibly 10,000 US ground troops to Vietnam, this 
force to be used for defensive duties, releasing ARVN units for service 
against insurgents. Although Taylor and his colleagues conceived that the 
major requirement was for American support for a counterinsurgency campaign 
inside Vietnam, they warned that future requirements beyond the recunnended 
counterinsurgency program would depend upon the nature of the settlement 
ultimately attained in Laos and the manner in which Hanoi adjusted its 
conduct to such a settlement. If Hanoi continued its guerrilla infiltration 
the time could come when the United States would be compelled "to attack the 
source of guerrilla aggression in North Viet-Nam and impose an the Hanoi 
government a price far participating in the current war which is commensurate 
with the damage being inflicted an its neighbors to the south." (58) 
As had been their attitude toward the interim report, the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff regarded the final Taylor mission proposals as being less forceful 
than the situation demanded. Observing that loss of South Vietnam would 
lead to rapid communization of neighboring nations, they desired deployment 
of strong US military forces rather than a gradual entry of combat support 
units. They proposed to warn Hanoi of punitive action unless Vietcong 
aggression ceased. (59) Back in his post as Chairman of the State Depart-
ment Policy Planning Council, Rostow was reported to have argued forcibly 
for a contingency policy of retaliation against North Vietnam, graduated to 
match the intensity of Hanoi's support to the Vietcong. At his request 
PACAF had provided Rostdw with two aerial target lists to support such a 
concept of reprisal harassment against North Vietnam. (60) Admiral Felt 
could see advantages and disadvantages in introducing US combat forces into 
Vietnam, but he held' to the opinion that the United States should not 
introduce large numbers of combat forces until it had taken the other means 
available to support, the South Vietnamese that he had recommended on 
18 October and which had been substantially accepted in the Taylor report.

The proposed military options in South Vietnam were discussed at the 
National Security Council on 11 November. A joint State-Defense memorandum 
of 13 November, made after consultations in which the Joint Chiefs did not 
participate, was unfavorable to a commitment of US combat troops in Vietnam, 
reasoning that such could cause a military escalation, would provoke apathy 
and possibly hostility among South Vietnamese, might jeopardize chances of 
securing a political- settlement in Laos, and could promote political reper-
cussions within the United States if ITS forces were unilaterally employed 
independently of SEATO. (62) On 13 November, President Kennedy approved 
increased US airlift for the Diem forces to include helicopters, light 
aviation, and transport aircraft and USAF personnel and aircraft for air 
reconnaissance and aerial spray operations. (63) After discussing the 
State-Defense memorandum with the Nttional Security Council, President Kennedy 
announced on 16 November that he would follow the recommendations of the Taylor 
report and bolster South Vietnam's military strength but that he would not 
commit US combat forces at that time. On 22 November he further directed that 
Diem would be informed of US willingness to increase aid in a joint undertaking. 
The United States would provide more men and equipment, step up training, and 
help establish better communications and intelligence systems. In turn, Diem 
would be expected to place South Vietnam on a war footing, mobilize its 
resources, give its government adequate authority, and overhaul the RVNAF 
military establishment and command structure. The military clause of NSAM 111 
issued on 22 November authorized uniformed US military personnel in South 
Vietnam for "air reconnaissance, photography, instruction in and execution of 
air-ground support techniques, and for special intelligence." (64) 
3. US Military Command Arrangements: 2d ADVON AND MAO' 
In May 1961 Admiral Felt had irdicated that in the event that US combat 
forces were sent to Vietnam he would expect the US MAAG Chief to be designated 
Commander, US Forces Vietnam, and given operational control -- under CINCPAC --
of all American forces. In contingency plans for possible US operations in 
Southeast Asia, Admiral Felt had approved the concept that Joint Task Force 
116 would be deployed to the threatened area and that the Commander JTF 116 
would be provided Army, Navy, and USAF component commanders. The impending 
deployment of US combat support units to Vietnam early in November 1961 did 
not exactly fit either contemplated situation, and new ideas were required 
to meet the command situation. 
In Hawaii, Lt. Gen. Paul D. Harkins, CC Army Forces in the Pacific, 
considered that the command situation in Vietnam could be most adequately 
managed by a "double-hattind'arrangement whereby the Chief US MAAG Vietnam 
would be recognized in an expanded role as Commander US Forces Vietnam. 
General McGarr in Saigon also indicated that he expected to exercise control 
over the Jungle Jim squadron detachment when it reached Vietnam. At first

Admiral Felt was willing to accept this arrangement, which would have been 
appropriate to a training situation. On the other hand, PACAF protested 
that the Jungle Jim detachment would have both an overt training and a covert 
operational mission and that by law a MAAG was not authorized to command or 
control military operations. PACAF also anticipated a significant increase 
in air operations both in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia and recommended 
that it be permitted to establish an advance echelon of Thirteenth Air Force 
headquarters in Saigon to exercise command and control over USAF units in 
Southeast Asia. (65) 
The PACAF recommendation was in context with existing CINCPAC contingency 
planning, and an 2 November Admiral Felt accepted it in his directive issued 
to Generals O'Donnell and McGarr. Felt noted that the detachment of the 
4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron would have an avert training mission 
but that it might be called upon to conduct covert operational missions in 
support of RVNAF actions against the Vietcong within the borders of South 
Vietnam. The CINCPAC responsibility for the avert training mission would 
be carried out through the Chief MAAG, who would function through the Chief, 
Air Force Section, MAAG. The CINCPAC responsibility for the covert opera-
tional mission would be carried out through CINCPACAF, and by CINCPACAF 
through the commander of an Advance Echelon, Thirteenth Air Force, to be 
established in Vietnam. In order tb provide close coordination of both overt 
and covert air missions, the Chief, Air Force Section, MAAG, and the Commander, 
Advance Echelon, Thirteenth Air Force, would be the same man, and, although 
assigned to the MAAG, he would have dual but equal responsibilities to both 
CINCPACAF and Chief, MAAG Vietnam. The advance echelon commander would also 
be responsible for all Air Force activities in Southeast Asia that were not 
assigned MAAG functions, and for this reason PACAF was authorized to establish 
detachments of the advance echelon at Don Muang in Thailand and elsewhere as 
required. In recognition of the increased responsibilities incumbent upon 
the new position, Felt recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the 
rank of the Chief, Air Force Section, MAAG Vietnam be raised to that of 
brigadier general. He also recognized that the Advance Echelon, Thirteenth 
Air Force, would have to have some activity name against which it could levy 
requisitions for personnel and support, but he enjoined that such a name 
would avoid any appearance that a new US command was being introduced into 
Southeast Asia. (66) 
The movement of PACAF units into South Vietnam were conducted with the 
utmost secrecy. The 6009th Tactical Support Group was established at 
Tachikawa Air Base in Japan as a contingency war plan organization under 
command of Colonel Claude G. McKinney. It was alerted an 28 October and 
deployed to Clark Air Base an 1 November. Three days later the group went 
to Bien Hoa where it began to establish base facilities to receive the 
Jungle Jim detachment. (67) Detachment 2, 4400th Combat Crew Training 
Squadron commenced departure from Florida an 5 November, and while the

deployment was in progress the detachment was given the nickname of 
"Farm Gate" in order to avoid continuing confusion with the "Jungle Jim" 
designation of the parent squadron organization remaining in Florida. 
Colonel King led the oversea flight of Farm Gate's four SC-47s, while the 
eight T-28s were disassembled and airlifted to Clark Air Base, where they 
were reassembled and flown by two's to Tan Son Nhut and thence to Bien Hoa. 
The planes arrived at Tan Son Nhut on international flight plans as American 
aircraft, but at Bien Hoa they were given new tail numbers and repainted 
with VNAF insignia. The first planes arrived at Bien Hoa an 14 November, 
and Farm Gate was operationally ready on 16 November, although all of its 
SC-47s and T-28s were not on hand until 24 November. Early in December 
Colonel King took delivery of four of the B-26s that had been sent to the 
Far East earlier in the year for possible clandestine employment in Laos; 
these attack bombers were euphemistically described as RB-26s, but they 
were hard-nose strafing models and not photo aircraft. By all reports the 
151 men of Farm Gate were highly motivated. General O'Donnell described 
Farm Gate as "a hot outfit ready to go" and said that it would be "hard to 
hold back.? (68) 
By 11 November, Farm Gate was enroute to Vietnam, additional deployments 
of a Ranch Hand detachment of six aerial spray-equipped C-123s and a Mule 
Train 0-123 air transport squadron were impending, and plans were being 
made to use USAF personnel to establish a tactical air control system in 
Vietnam. Preparatory to closing out the Pipe Stem RF-101 reconnaissance 
operations at Tan Son Nhut, the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron from 
Misawa Air Base was beginning Able Mable detachment reconnaissance flights 
from Don Muang Airfield in Thailand, but Detachment 1, 15th Tactical Recon-
naissance Squadron, would continue to operate a photo processing cell at 
Tan Son Nhut after the withdrawal of the Pipe Stem RF-101s. Even though 
Secretary McNamara had not yet given approval for the assignnent of a USAF 
brigadier general in Saigon, General O'Donnell thought it imperative to 
proceed with the establishment of a PACAF command organization that would 
be able to take control of Air Force activities in South Vietnam and 
Southeast Asia. (69) 
As his personal selection to fill the two-hat position of Chief, Air 
Force Section MAAG Vietnam and Commander, Advance Echelon Thirteenth Air 
Force, General O'Donnell nominated Brigadier General Rollen H. Anthis, who 
was serving as Vice Commander, Thirteenth Air Force. Anthis had a good back-
ground on the situation in Southeast Asia, and both General O'Donnell and 
General Moorman agreed that there were "few brigadiers in whom we have 
any greater confidence." While Anthis awaited orders from Washington, 
PACAF issued instructions an 15 November for an air unit in Southeast 
Asia which met the criteria of anonymity specified by Admiral Felt two 
weeks earlier. The order directed the establishment of Detachment 7, 
Thirteenth Air Force, in Saigon, and Detachments 8, 9, and 10 of an

organization described as "2d Advon" at Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa, and Don Muang. 
The designation "2d Advon" had no meaning and was used because of Admiral 
Felt's admonition that the advance echelon in South Vietnam would not be 
described as a command. The advance echelon commander was not supposed to 
have a staff, but Felt winked at the burying of such a staff in Detachment 7. 
At Tan Son Nhut, Detachment 8 (2d Advon) was established to serve as what 
Anthis would describe as the "prime set-up" for an air operations center, 
combat reporting center, and the photo processing cell. Detachments 9 
(2d Advon) and 10 (2d Advon) were organized at Bien Hoa and Don Muang vice 
the 6009th and 6010th Tactical Support Groups, the emergency war plan units 
that had been used as a vehicle for deploying base service personnel to 
-those locations. In General Moorman's words, 2d Advon was a "freak," but 
the arrangement provided a means for controlling USAF operations in South-
east Asia and met requirements that unit designations Should be meaningless. 
(70) 
Having received authority from Secretary McNamara to assign a USAF 
brigadier general as Chief, Air Force Section MAAG Vietnam, Admiral Felt 
concurred on 16 November in the assignment of Anthis to the dual position of 
Chief, Air Farce Section MAAG Vietnam and Commander, 2d Advon. (71) On 
20 November, Anthis arrived in Saigon, first establishing the 2d Advon office 
in a roam in the downtown Brink Hotel. Within a few days, however, Anthis 
secured another office adjacent to the one occupied by Colonel Vinh in the 
VNAF headquarters building at Tan San Nhut. The reason for Anthis' assignment 
was quite puzzling to Colonel Vinh, and Ambassador Nolting, who first learned 
about the 2d Advon on 24 November, informed the State Department that he 
found it incomprehensible that a new US military headquarters Should have 
been established in Vietnam without prior consultation with the US Ambassador 
and the Government of Vietnam. Molting asked Anthis to delay any further 
organizational activities until he could get some clarification, and he 
wanted it precisely understood that any combat or quasi-combat operations 
carried out by 2d Advon in Vietnam would be cleared with him in advance. 
After several messages were passed, Admiral Felt convinced Molting that the 
2d Advon was not a new command but rather an organization to administer 
and control PACAF elements that might be deployed in Southeast Asia, in 
coordination with MAAG Vietnam if such were appropriate, and by early 
December the EMbassy had no further objections to 2d Advon. (72) As 
initially set up, Detachments 7, 8, and 9 were small units, austerely manned 
by key personnel drawn on temporary duty from the Fifth Air Force, Thirteenth 
.Air Force, and Headquarters PACAF. The absence of key personnel necessarily 
affected the other PACAF activities, so much so that it was obvious by 
mid-December that General O'Donnell was going to have to get personnel 
assistance from USAF. (73) 
While the organization of 2d Advon was in progress, similar discussions 
were in progress looking toward a reorganization of the overall US military 
command function in South Vietnam. In Washington, US Army officials were

a driving force in an effort to establish a completely new US unified 
command in Vietnam separate from the US Pacific Command. Generals Harkins 
and McGarr, however, continued to advocate a double-hatting whereby the 
Chief, MAAG Vietnam, -would also serve as Commander US Forces Vietnam. (74) 
On 22 November the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to Secretary McNamara 
that a subordinate unified command under CINCPAC designated as US Forces 
Vietnam would be organized in Saigon, with Army, Navy, and Air Force 
component commands. The Joint Chiefs conceived that the COMUS Vietnam would 
be co-equal in status with the US Ambassador, and that the new command would 
draw together all US activities in the country (including intelligence, the 
MAAG, and economic assistance with military implications) that were related 
to the counterinsurgency effort. (75) On 27 November Secretary McNamara 
approved the establishment ofCOMUS Vietnam and provided that it would be 
headed by a four star commander. (76) Where this recommendation negated 
the CINCPAC contingency planning concept for a possible employment of 
JTF-116 into South Vietnam, Admiral Felt considered that the enlargement 
of the MAAG with additional personnel, ? the deployment of PACAF units into 
Vietnam, and the impending arrival of US Army helicopter companies indicated 
a need for COMUS Vietnam. He proposed that the Commander, 2d Advon, would 
immediately begin to serve as the air component commander to COMUS Vietnam, 
that an Army component command would be organized upon the arrival of the 
US Army helicopter companies, and that a Navy component would be provided 
for but not established until some US .naval forces were assigned. (77) Felt 
proposed that the COMUS should be provided a small joint staff, and on 
8 December he forwarded a detailed table of distribution for the MACV 
J-Staff to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, under which a US Army general would 
be the COMUS and the Air Force would be allocated responsibility for filling 
the positions of Chief of Staff, J-2 Intelligence, and J-5 Plans. (78) 
In the high policy level discussions of the US command arrangements in 
South Vietnam it was obvious that the establishment of a four-star COMUS 
Vietnam would signal a major commitment of US prestige and would constitute 
an endorsement of the viability of President Diem's government. In their 
recommendation on 22 November, the Joint Chiefs therefore proposed that 
before altering the command structure the United States should clearly define 
its objectives in Vietnam and extract a commitment for a joint military 
program from Diem. (79) Admiral Felt suggested that the establishment of 
the new US command might well provide Diem with the assurance of American 
support that he appeared to require before implementing corrective reforms 
in his government. (80) On 5 December General LeMay was so gravely concerned 
that the level of assistance proposed for South Vietnam would not be sufficient 
to defeat the Vietcong that he asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to inform 
Secretary McNamara and the President that a clear statement of US objectives 
was urgent, together with a positive contingency commitment to introduce US 
forces into South Vietnam for overt operations if enemy military actions 
demanded it. (81) Other than for making a few RVNAF organizational chanes,

however, President Diem had not been willing to accept a military counter-
insurgency plan. In an effort to get an acceptable plan, MAAG Vietnam in 
October 1961 had prepared a limited venture for clearing the Vietcong out 
of Zone D, one idea being that a pilot-experience would give the RVNAF 
experience in counterinsurgency operations and the other being that the 
Diem government badly needed to score a military victory to maintain morale. 
On 6 December Admiral Felt provided General McGarr with a revised draft of 
a CINCPAC outline plan for comprehensive military action with a suggestion 
that it be given to General Minh to be used as his awn. One of the essential 
features of this plan involved important authority to be given to an ARVN 
counterinsurgency task force commander who would be able to concentrate 
military units in the area in which counterinsurgency operations were under-
taken, the concentration being thought necessary in order to provide something 
on the order of an 18 to 1 preponderancy of force believed essential for anti-
guerrilla warfare. (82) 
Where the Department of Defense appeared to favor stronger support for 
Diem including establishment of COMUS Vietnam, the Department of State was 
more skeptical. In New Delhi, US Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith received 
an impression from Indian diplomats that Diem was losing his evocative 
leadership and support within South Vietnam. Unhappy about the Taylor-
Rostow report, Galbraith made a personal trip to Saigon and on 20 November 
wrote President Kennedy a personal letter urging that Diem was "a wasting 
asset" who was "losing, not gaining popularity." He recommended that the 
United States should not seek to build Diem up and was strongly opposed to 
putting US ground troops into Vietnam. (83) In regard to COMUS Vietnam both 
Secretary Rusk and Ambassador Nolting opposed the proposal on the ground 
that it was too drastic a change. In a counter-proposal the State Department 
recommended extension of the authority of the MAAG Chief over the additional 
US military forces and over portions of economic aid and intelligence related 
to counterinsurgency. State was particularly opposed to assignment of a 
four-star US military commander in Saigon, believing this would be "an 
irrevocable and 100 percent cammitment to saving South Vietnam." (84) 
In November and December the actions of Diem's government were not 
reassuring to the United States. In an apparent response to American demands 
for reform, the Presidential Palace in Saigon was credited with preparing a 
series of newspaper articles which denounced the United States for imperialism. 
(85) Diem continued to drag his feet in regard to the establishment of an 
inviolate chain of command in the RVNAF and giving General Minh unimpeded 
authority as Chief of the Field Command, and General Minh reported that his 
friends were asking him if his request to command the joint task force proposed 
for the operation in Zone D was designed to give him control over forces for 
a possible coup. (86) Other RVNAF officers felt that the United States was 
pushing too hard; they referred to counterinsurgency planning as the "American 
Plan." (87) Conversation between Diem, Nolting, and McGarr revealed that

Diem did not believe that American ideas and methods would necessarily fit 
his country. In the matter of military advisors, Diem wanted to approve 
categories of US advisors on a case by case basis because he explained that 
"he didn't want to give the monopoly an nationalism to Ho Chi Minh." (88) 
Having employed resettlement projects of his own, Diem was attracted to the 
ideas of Sir Robert K. G. Thompson, the former Permanent Defense Secretary 
of Malaya during the insurgency there, who arrived in Saigon in September 1961 
as head of a British advisory mission. In the month of Thampson's arrival, 
the Government of Vietnam Strategic Hamlet Program was initiated under the 
guidance of Diem's brother and political advisor, Ngo Dinh Nhu. Diem quoted 
Thompson as saying that the British had lost three years in their counter-
insurgency effort in Malaya by not building a pacification and development 
infrastructure and by initial reliance on military solutions. He pointed 
out that the American Zone D plan was an example of a militarily-oriented 
plan. It would be fine if it were a successful operation, but a failure 
would be very detrimental to the morals of the ARVN and of the country. At 
any rate, no ground work had been laid in Zone D which would permanently 
separate the Vietcong from the people. Diem believed that permanent victory 
would depend upon a restoration of faith of the people in the government, and 
that resettlement would be necessary in accordance with a long range strategic 
plan. (89) 
The uncertainties involved in the proposals for the organization of the 
expanded US assistance effort and the strategic concepts to be followed made 
it very difficult for General O'Donnell and his PACAF staff in Hawaii. On 
13 November O'Donnell nevertheless advised Felt that the establishment of a 
country-wide tactical air control system (TACS) to permit the most effective 
use of the limited VNAF capabilities was the single most pressing requirement 
in Vietnam. The Vietnamese did not have such a system and could not provide 
it. This proposal was taken under study by the PACOM staff, where the initial 
reaction was that the existing VNAF control system was rudimentary but possibly 
adequate. (90) General McGarr,s plan for handling the US Army H-21 helicopter 
transport companies contributed to the TACS problem. He was preparing to 
assign the two companies which the Joint Chiefs ordered deployed on 21 November 
to the control of the US Army Senior Corps Advisors, one at Tan Son Nhut in 
support of the III Corps and the other at Qui Nhon in support of II Corps. 
The Joint Chiefs authorized a third H.21 company on 4 December, and McGarr 
slated it for location at Da Nang in support of the I Corps. McGarr also 
urged the RVNAF Joint General Staff to reorganize VNAF's three L-19 squadrons 
and one H-34 squadron into four composite squadrons, three of which he con-
ceived would be located at the three corps field headquarters under operational 
control of the corps commanders and the fourth to be held in general support 
under operational control of the Commander, Field Command. With this reorgani-
zation, McGarr conceived that each ARVN corps would have an organic capability 
for adequate L-19 reconnaissance, sufficient helicopter lift to move combat

patrols of platoon or company-size forces and to effect critical resupply 
and casualty evacuation, and a means for accamplishing staff and command 
liaison. On 2 December General McGarr also requested allocation of a 
number of US Argy AC-1 Caribou light air transports, L-20 and L-28 liaison 
aircraft, and UH-1 helicopters to be used in support of MAAG Army field 
advisors, a request which the Department of Army preferred to meet by 
assigning officially constituted units rather than detachments of aircraft. 
(91) During late November and early December there was uncertainty as to 
how the 16 Mille Train C-123 air transport aircraft which the 346th Troop 
Carrier Squadron (Assault) was deploying from Pope Air Force Base, North 
Carolina, would be controlled and employed in Vietnam. In order to secure 
maximum utilization of this airlift General O'Donnell visualized central 
control; he proposed that the Mule Train squadron would be based at Clark 
and would maintain a detachment of operational aircraft at Tan Son Nhut 
subject to mission priorities and allocations of airlift space by General 
McGarr but under operatibnal control of Commander, 2d Advon. But Admiral 
Felt had agreed to the allocation of the US Army helicopter transport 
companies to the ARVN corps areas and early in December he was considering 
a similar division of the C-123s between the corps areas. (92) 
On the other hand Admiral Felt agreed that Farm Gate tactical aircraft 
must be under the control of Cammander, 2d Advon, and shortly after Secretary 
McNamara directed USAF on 10 November to furnish six Ranch Hand spray-equipped 
aircraft for employment in Vietnam, Felt assigned operational control over 
spray operations to PACAF and 2d Avon and gave planning and coordinating 
responsibilities to General McGarr. There was now same question as to how 
the Ranch Hand and Farm Gate units would be profitably employed. In regard 
to herbicide operations the Vietcong had already gathered their seasonal 
crops and it was too late to employ the Ranch Hand spray aircraft against 
the enemy's food, but General McGarr's plan for Zone D visualized defoliation 
flights into this heavily forested, lightly populated, jungle area. The plan 
envisioned selective strip defoliation around the zone's perimeter and along 
roads and trails penetrating into the base area. (93) Despite the original 
concept that Farm Gate might be employed in covert operations, Admiral Felt 
advised General McGarr on 16 November that the primary mission of the detach-
ment would be to conduct tactical training and tactical pilot up-grading for 
VNAF, the objective being to get VNAF pilots checked out and combat ready in 
T-28s on a priority basis. (94) 
On 3 December General O'Donnell began a six day visit in South Vietnam 
and Thailand, and in a two hour visit with Diem he found that the Vietnamese 
President was intensely interested in getting a better employment of airpower 
against the Vletcong. Diem presented an elaborate map talk of the Vietcong 
organizational structure extending dawn the north/south Annamite mountains 
into base areas in the "Nam Bo," the "southern area" or roughly old Cochin 
China. In the northern mountains including parts of Kontum, Quang Tin, and

Quang Ngai provinces, Interzone V provided a receptacle for infiltrators 
arriving from the north and west, the main area of Interzone V being called 
War Zone X or the Do Xa war zone. Interzone V funnelled men and supplies 
south to the Nam Bo war zones, which included Zone C in northwestern Tay Ninh 
province adjacent to the Cambodian border; Zone D northeast of Saigon in 
heavy jungles of Phuoc Long, Binh Long, and Phuoc Thanh provinces; the 
Cong Thap Mtoi war zone where the Cambodian province of Svay Rieng juts out 
into Vietnam in the conformation called the "Parrot's Beak;" and the Upper 
and Lower U-Minh war zones, in the U-Minh forest of the Mekong Delta's 
Ca Mau peninsula. Diem developed as a principal theme the vital significance 
of airfields and air transport to his national communications; he stressed 
the point that air operations must assume considerably increased importance 
in the more intense operations he foresaw. Defense Minister Thuan also 
talked with O'Donnell about an increasing role for the air effort and stressed 
the importance of accelerated construction of an airfield in the central high-
lands at Pleiku. These conversations led O'Donnell to believe that Diem was 
willing to approve an expanded air effort, and, if the TACS could be installed, 
O'Donnell believed that Diem would get a demonstration of the advantages that 
could be attained by establishing clear channels for the control of his military 
forces. On the other hand, Colonel Vinh was gravely concerned about General 
MhGarr's desire to divide up the small pilot and technical capability of the 
VNAF and to establish an "ARVN air force." Vinh's main hope for expanding 
VNAF tactical fighter strength lay in up-grading L-19 and C-47 pilots; if the 
liaison squadrons were transferred to ARVN control this would be impossible. 
And, of course, the transfer of the VNAF helicopters and liaison squadrons 
could not be supported by very limited maintenance and repair facilities. 
Vinh not only opposed the plan very vocally, but in November he sought to 
forestall its effects by approving the requests of a good many L-19 pilots 
and instructors for fighter transition, admitting privately that possibly 
half of the men were probably not really qualified for fighter training. (95) 
In his increased manifestation ,of interest in air matters, President 
Diem approved a concept for a Ranch Hand defoliation of jungle cover along 
key roads on 4 December, and on this same day Admiral Felt directed PACAF 
to develop a concept for a combat employment of Farm Gate within South 
Vietnam. On 4 December in Washington, Secretary McNamara met with the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and approved the use of Farm Gate aircraft on combat missions 
with "US/GVN" crews, and on 6 December the Joint Chiefs approved such missions, 
provided a combined US and Vietnamese crew was aboard the aircraft. (96) 
Submitted to CINCPAC on 6 December the PACAF concept for Farm Gate provided 
that, using the training function as a cover, US aircraft and personnel would 
be employed in support of RVNAF actions against the Vietcong within the borders 
of South Vietnam with the objectives of denying Vietcong supply routes and 
concentrations, establishing armed air patrols of South Vietnam's borders and 
shore lines, seeking out and destroying/disrupting Vietcong command and control 
organization, seeking out and destroying any Communist airlift into South

Vietnam, and developing and implementing an aggressive program of offensive 
air operations. Thase Farm Gate missions would be controlled by Commander 
2d Advon, but as soon as possible a simplified TACS would be needed to 
permit full utilization of both Farm Gate and VNAF strike aircraft. (97) 
The CINCPAC draft outline plan for comprehensive military action against 
the Vietcong sent to Saigon on 6 December contained many of these air 
actions. The objectives would be to attack Vietcong lifelines and support 
bases with anti-guerrilla ground operations and air actions. The plan 
called for development of combat air bases at Da Nang and Pleiku and provided 
that air operations would stress photo reconnaissance, air surveillance of 
coastal regions, and close air support to include timely strikes against 
enemy targets located by operating forces. (98) In reporting his conversations 
with Diem to Admiral Felt, General O'Donnell noted that US evaluations were 
turning up many lucrative targets for air strikes, and he again emphasized 
that a limited TACS and a jointly manned VNAF-USAF air operations center would 
be needed. On 8 December, Admiral Felt gave his approval for the establishment 
of the limited tactical air control system, and for the moment it appeared 
that Eft Gate would be cleared for combat operations. On 15 December, however, 
Ambassador Nolting directed that no F_arm. Gate combat mission should be flown 
until he authorized it. (99) 
While in a conversation with President Kennedy in November, Secretary 
McNamara had "volunteered to look after" the war in Vietnam, (100) and in 
order to examine approaches to the Vietnamese problem McNamara and General 
Lemnitzer met with Admiral Felt and the CINCPAC component commanders in 
Hawaii on 16 December, thus initiating a series of Secretary of Defense 
conferences which would be held each month for several months and periodically 
in either Hawaii or Saigon following this. In initial remarks, McNamara 
revealed on 16 December that State-Defense negotiations would delay organiza-
tion of a new US military headquarters in Saigon and that it was President 
Kennedy's policy not to introduce US combat troops into Vietnam at this time. 
After hearing an intelligonce briefingL)r.1 27NAF operations, McNamara expressed 
concern at the danger of antagonizing people by indiscriminate bombing. He 
also stated that Nhile naval and air support operations are desirable, they 
won t be too effective and we should not think they will end the war." When 
briefed on General McGarr's Zone D plan and Diem's reluctance to implement 
it, McNamara expressed some sympathy for Diem's personal position and 
suggested that McGarr and Nolting should attempt to get agreement on specific 
proposals rather than press Diem to agree to general concepts. At the close 
of this discussion item, McNamara and Lemnitzer instructed Felt and McGarr 
to continue to press for the Zone D operation but to try to get Diem to 
agree to smaller warm-up operations as a beginning of a counterinsurgency 
campaign. The same instructions were applicable to border control; here it 
was important to start active patrolling and ambushing measures at the most 
vulnerable spots along the Lao border. (101) 
In area of special Air Force interest, General O'Donnell considered that 
he got a fairly favorable reaction from the Secretary of Defense and the

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. McNamara and Lemnitzer approved a 
combat employment of Farm Gate within South Vietnam, provided operational 
missions were flown with a Vietnamese on board. General Lemnitzer thought 
that there might be some covert employment for Farm Gate later on, but he 
again specified that all missions would be limited to South Vietnam, since 
Farm Gate was an experimental unit committed to South Vietnam -- not Laos. 
Where Admiral Felt had been querying OlDonnelLas to the practicality of 
installing a TACS in phased increments, the Secretary of Defense directed 
O'Donnell to set up the tactical air control system from PACAF assets as 
soon as possible, a time that O'Donnell promised would be about two weeks. 
When General NbGarr's plan to transfer VNAF units to ARVN control was dis-
cussed, Admiral Felt opposed it on the ground that team-work was required 
rather than reorganization, and MbNamara agreed. Instead of establishing 
an ARVN air force, the Secretary of Defense and CINCPAC asked McGarr and 
Nolting to press Diem for a truly unified defense organization and to 
elevate the VNAF and Vietnamese Navy to an equal level with ARVN on the 
Joint General Staff. McNamara also agreed with O'Donnell's proposal that 
USAF and VNAF. air operations Should be coordinated and directed through a 
joint operations center, with a USAF commander controlling US operations 
and the VNAF commander controlling Vietnamese air operations. In the 
discussion of the deployment of Mule Train, McNamara emphasized that this 
was combat air lift and he intended it to be used not for taxi service but 
to support combat effort, to include, for example, air drops of material 
and South Vietnamese personnel. The discussion of an employment for the 
spray-equipped Ranch Hand aircraft brought out the fact that there was little 
experience as to how well defoliation would work and that Diem had not agreed 
to assume responsibility for such activity. General O'Donnell thought that 
the success of the Zone D operation might depend too much on untried ? 
defoliation, and Ambassador Nalting pointed out that defoliation would alert 
the Vietcong to impending operations. Secretary McNamara nevertheless expressed 
eagerness to see limited defoliation of key transportation routes begin quickly 
in order to get the project going. (102) 
Throughout the day-long conference, Secretary McNamara emphasized that, 
except for the limitation against employment of US combat forces, manpower 
and money would not be permitted to stand in the way of getting the job done 
in Vietnam. He wanted to get US Army operations and intelligence advisors 
into the field with ARVN units, and he announced an intention of calling 
upon the services to augment the MAO with highest quality personnel to 
provide intensive guidance at the South Vietnamese unit level. He approved 
construction items to provide POL facilities at Qui Nhon and Tan Son Nhut 
and to improve the airfield at Pleiku. As the conference ended, McNamara 
concluded by stating that he had only one objective in South Vietnam "that 
is to win this battle." (103) In summarizing the significant developments 
of the Secretary's Conference, General O'Donnell was impressed by Secretary 
McNamara's "extremely strong statement of US determination that South Vietnam 
173

would not be permitted to fall to Communism." (104) Very soon, however, 
organizational and operational policies originating both in Washington and 
in Saigon revealed that the United States would continue to follow a cautious 
course emphasizing ground rather than air action. 
Both Admiral Felt and General O'Donnell believed that over-cautious 
policies that had restricted air employment in Laos had not been in the best 
interest of the United States, and, given authority to employ Farm Gate 
aircraft with combined US-VNAF crews inside South Vietnam, they were anxious 
to commence air strikes. On 23 December, Admiral Felt informed Generals 
McGarr and O'Donnell that Able Mable and Pipe Stem reconnaissance had revealed 
many Vietcong targets which were "ripe for popping." He directed them to 
coordinate with the Government of Vietnam and to begin to employ Farm Gate 
and VNAF aircraft against targets that would "carry fight into the heart of 
the Vietcong." (105) Since the Farm Gate Crews were ready and impatient for 
action, General Anthis received the directive with high optimism. (106) 
In Washington, however, General Lemnitzer received an information copy of 
the Felt message, and on 26 December he messaged CINCPAC that Farm Gate 
would be employed on combat missions only when the TTAF did not have the 
capability (because of lack of training, equipment, etc.) to perform the 
required missions. Such a utilization of Farm Gate would be with a combined 
US and VNAF crew, and all such missions would be for the purpose of pro-
viding necessary training for Vietnamese personnel so that the VNAF could 
perform the required missions at the earliest possible date. (107) 
The same cautious attitude was evidenced in connection with defoliation 
operations, which the US State Department mistrusted because it feared that 
the employment of even common non-toxic herbicidal chemicals in world-wide 
agricultural use would provoke Communist charges of chemical warfare. As a 
result of conceptual planning already noted, the USAF Tactical Air Command 
was directed to deploy an aerial spray detachment as a crash project. The 
on17 ITS_47 r,r7nr7ati= 7:4th any Juch activizy was an aeriai 
spray detachment at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. On 211 NovPmbr, 
personnel from Langley and aircrews and six C-123 aircraft from the 464th 
Troop Carrier Wing at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina were organized as 
Tactical Air Force Transport Squadron Provisional-1, with Captain Carl W. 
Marshall as Officer-in-Charge. Bringing six C-123s and 69 men, this provi-
sional squadron -- nicknamed Ranch Hand -- arrived at Clark Air Base on 
6 December, where it awaited policy decisions as to its use. In the next 
several weeks very meticulous plans were prepared by the country team in 
Saigon, reviewed and substantially reduced in scope and tightened in 
procedure by CINCPAC, and again reviewed and limited by the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, who on 12 January 1962 authorized a test spray flight along 
Highway 15 between Bien Hoa and Vung Tau (Cap St. Jacques). Arriving at 
Tan Son Nhut on 6 January, the Ranch Hand crews studied aerial photographs 
and made two familiarization flights along Highway 15 before flying their

first spray mission an 13 January. According to the rules for such operations, 
RVNAF personnel were to be aboard etch spray plane to identify the proper 
objective; Vietnamese were to be used to the maxillxum extent possible in the 
ground handling of the defoliant ahamicals; all areas where food crops were 
growing were to be strictly avoided; and province chiefs were to be given 
three days advance notice of spray flights in order to explain the non-toxic 
activity to citizens who might be affected. Since the 0-123 spray aircraft 
had no armor plating, General O'Donnell feared that advance notice of their 
activity would make them very vulnerable to Vietcong ground fire, and 2d 
Advon scheduled fighter cover for the 0-123 spray operations. Despite this 
precaution, a 0-123 on a familiarization mission was lost on 2 February with 
its entire crew. The cause for this first US aircraft loss in Vietnam was 
unknown, but enemy ground fire or sabotage were distinct possibilities. (108) 
At the same time that Washington policy makers were providing Farm Gate 
and Ranch Hand with operational restrictions, fewer precautions were attached 
to the US Army helicopter and fixed-wing aviation units and to the USAF Mule 
Train 0-123 squadron deployed to South Vietnam to provide combat support for 
the RVNAF. In fact the H-21 helioapters of the 8th and 57th Helicopter 
Companies arrived at the port of Saigon aboard a US aircraft carrier on 
11 December, in full view of representatives of the International Control 
Commission, who promptly recorded the violation of the Geneva agreement. 
According to the HAAG plan, these companies were based at Tan Son Nhut and 
Qui Nhon under the operational control of the US Army senior advisors to the 
ARVN III and II Corps. On 26 January 1962, the US Army 93d Helicopter 
Company arrived at Da Nang and was placed under operational control of the 
US Army senior advisor to the ARVN I Corps. These helicopter companies were 
charged to fly combat support missions for the RVNAF for which VNAF units 
were not yet qualified and to help:in training ARVN in air mobility tactics. 
In addition to these helicopters, the Army deployed the 18th Fixed Wing 
Aviation Company with 16 U-1 Otter!aircraft; after arriving at Nha Trang 
on 7 February the liaison aircraft: (which could transport 2,000 pounds of 
cargo or seven passengers) gave support to US Army field advisors. In its 
initial planning, the MAAG considered that one H-21 helicopter company to 
each ARVN corps "was about right," but in January 1962 Secretary McNamara 
emphasized that if more helicopter:companies were required the MAAG should 
not hesitate to ask for them. (109) 
As was the case with the US Army helicopters, rules of operation for 
the USAF Mule Train 0-123 assault transport aircraft deployed to Vietnam 
permitted the aircraft to bear US markings. Under command of Lt Col 
Floyd K. Shafner, the 346th Troop Carrier Squadron -- which would comprise 
Tactical Air Force Transport Squadron Provisional -2, also known as the 
Mule Train detachment -- launched its first eight C-123s from Pope Air Force 
Base on 20 December, and the first four Mule Train planes went on from Clark 
to Tan Son Nhut on 2 January, where they flew their first mission on the 
following day. According to a revised basing plan, the Mule Train squadron

was in place in South Vietnam by 27 January, 12 of the C-123s being operated 
from the main location at Tan Son Nhut, two from Da Nang, and four being in 
rotation to and from Clark for necessary maintenance. In the organizational 
control of Mule Train PACAF was able to prevent division of the C-123s 
between the ARVN corps areas, and instead the planes were operated under 
2d Advon as a part of a tactical airlift system in South Vietnam which included 
the C-47s of the VNAF 1st Transport Squadron. With the arrival of the first 
C-123s, the US MAAG established a joint airlift allocations board (JAAB) to 
determine the priorities and make space allocations for airlift requested by 
US users. In the VNAF-USAF Joint Operations Center being established at 
Tan Son Nhut, airlift officers from PACAF's 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) 
joined VNAF representatives to man the JOC Airlift Branch, which received 
validated requests for airlift and planned, controlled, and directed the 
actual performance of air transport flights by either USAF C-123 or VNAF 
C-47 aircraft. In addition to airlift services, Mule Train was charged to 
provide training and support for the operations of the ARVN airborne brigade. 
(110) While this rudimentary airlift organization provided some centralized 
control and permitted a more efficient use of scarce air transportation, it 
failed to work as efficiently as expected. The JAAB never functioned according 
to the concept for it, and, unable to get firm advance priorities for airlift, 
the JOC Airlift Branch frequently had to make sudden changes in the daily frag 
orders issued to Mule Train, causing inefficiency and confusion at the opera-
ting and air terminal levels. Within the JOC Airlift Branch, VNAF personnel 
handled the scheduling of Vietnamese air transport planes and seldom provided 
an exact accounting of the VNAF C-47 activities. As a matter of practice, 
the USAF officers in the JOC Airlift Branch scheduled C-123 sorties when the 
C-47 lift could not meet RVNAF requests. PArly in 1962 it was evident that 
the VNAF 1st Transport Group did not have enough crews to attain a maximum 
aircraft utilization. (ill) 
At the 16 December Secretary of Defense Conference, General O'Donnell 
was especially pleased when Serretnr7 M.7.1niaTa stated that TTA? mast be made 
a part of a Joint General Staff team responsive to corps commanders require-
ments, this to be accomplished through VNAF representation on the Joint 
General Staff, organization of a VNAF-USAF Joint Operations Center, and the 
establishment of a country-wide Tactical Air Control System (TACS). Following 
the Secretary of Defense conference, General McGarr secured a directive 
establishing spaces for nine VNAF officers on the Joint General Staff and for 
twelve an the staff of Field Command, and General Anthis obtained a commitment 
whereby VNAF would provide officers and airmen to a JOC at Tan Son Nhut and to 
subordinate Air Support Operations Centers that were to be opened at Da Nang 
and Pleiku. Despite these commitments VNAF was extremely short of highly 
qualified operations and intelligence officers and could not produce enough 
men to fill the spaces made available. The non-flying VNAF colonel who had 
been serving on the JGS was promoted to brigadier general and three VNAF 
lieutenants were added to the JGS, and, as will be seen, many of the VNAF 
officers assigned to the JOC had additional duties. (112)

In World War II and Korea the tactical air control system had proven 
its value both for air defense and for close air support of friendly ground 
forces. The JOC was the highest eohelon of the TACS and provided centralized 
planning, direction, and control of tactical air operations in a combat 
theater. It was supported by an Air Force Control and Reporting Center (CRC) 
which provided central radar control and warning services. Subordinate to 
the JOC, Air Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) were designed for location in 
each major subordinate ground command area. Each ASOC was supported by an 
Air Force Control and Reporting Post (CRP) which also extended the radar 
warning and control capabilities of the CRC. On the ground in Vietnam after 
mid-December PACAF and Thirteenth Air Force officers rapidly put together 
a plan -- nicknamed "Barn Door" -- for the TACS in Vietnam, including a 
combined VNAF-USAF JOC at Tan Son Nhut and two tailored ASOCs to be co-
located with the ARVN I and II Corps headquarters at Da Nang and Pleiku. 
Since the ARVN III Corps headquarters was located in Saigon it appeared that 
it could be served directly by the JOC at Tan Son Nhut. In the plan the 
USAF Sth Tactical Control Group would expand its GRP at Tan Son Nhut into 
a CRC and it would also install and operate the CRP at Da Nang. The VNAF 
would operate the CRP at Pleiku, using equipment it had on hand and newly 
trained technicians. The USAF 1st Communications Group was directed to 
operate a communications center at Tan Son Nhut and high frequency radio-
teletype circuits to Da Nang, Bien Hoa, Pleiku, and Nha Trang. (113) 
General O'Donnell had told Secretary McNamara that he would establish the 
TACS within two weeks, and the installation task was expedited after 
31 December. 1961 when Ambassador Nolting obtained the Vietnamese government's 
approval for the system. The JOC was opened at Tan Son Nhut an 2 January, 
with a VNAF major as Director and a USAF lieutenant colonel as Deputy 
Director. The I ASOC was also opened at Da Nang, this also with a VNAF 
Director and a USAF Deputy Director. Air transport aircraft of the 315th 
Air Division lifted men and equipment for the TACS into South Vietnam from 
2 to 14 January. (114) 
As a result of expedited action, the TAWS was reported as operational 
on 14 January 1962, but it was admittedly austere and left a lot to be 
wanted. In the Joint Operations Center both the VNAF Director and the VNAF 
Chief of the Combat Plans Divisian had additional duties and spent little 
time within the center. VNAF personnel insisted upon accustomed three-hour 
afternoon siestas which came at the very time that the operations officers 
needed to plan and issue warning orders for a following day's air operations. 
In addition to this, several of the USAF officers temporarily assigned to 
the JOC were inexperienced in the duties that they were expected to perform. 
(115) Manning and equipment of the I and II ASOCs took more time to complete. 
At Da Nang the CRP was erected on 13 January and became operational later in 
the month. At Pleiku the II ASOC was established on 17 February, but it was 
not fully operational until the following month. The VNAF light radar unit 
began to move to Pleiku on 12 February and was in limited operations late 
that month. (116)

SECK" 
The single greatest obstacle to the effective operation of the TAOS 
was the limited capacity and frequent failure of point-to-point communications 
between the JOC, the ASOCs, and the operational airfields. On 15 January 
1962 Secretary McNamara approved a proposal made by the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
that an MRC-85 tropospheric scatter communications system be procured and 
installed by a civil contractor in South Vietnam. The contract for the MRC 
project -- nicknamed "Back Porch" -- was awarded to Page Communications 
Engineers on 26 January, and the project would provide numerous main link 
communications channels to interconnect Saigon, Nha Trang, Pleiku, and 
Da Nang, with a connecting link from Pleiku to Ubon, Thailand. (117) In order 
to support the TAOS until the Back Porch system became operational PACAF 
requested and received newly developed AN/TSC-15 high frequency single side-
band radio sets which were delivered to Clark an 30 December 1961 for installa-
tion in the field by the USAF 1st Mobile Communications Group. The TSC-15 
sets theoretically provided long distance Channels of voice and teletype to 
the TAOS, but several unforeseen problems plagued the equipment. Operators 
were compelled to work in small mobile vans and were asked to endure temper-
atures of up to 130 degrees. Atmospheric conditions in Southeast Asia made 
for very poor high frequency transmission, and the fact that practically 
everyone was using high frequency bands caused jamming. In summary, from 
January to September 1962, when the Back Porch system became available for 
beneficial occupancy, the TAOS did not have the fast, positive, and dependable 
communications required to permit centralized control over decentralized air 
operations. (118) 
As a result of the prolonged State-Defense negotiations concerning the 
organization of an appropriate US superior military command in Vietnam, the 
US MAAG was described as "over its head in operations and intelligence planning 
to the neglect of its primary duty, the training and advisory effort." (119) 
Where MAAG Vietnam had been authorized a strength of 685 persons in May 1961, 
it was authorized 2,394 MAP supported and 5,1i35 non-MAp supported spaces at 
the end of December 1961. Of the 2,394 MAP supported spaces, 2,066 were 
allocated to the Army, 6 to the Marine Corps, 135 to the Navy, and 187 
(68 officers and 119 airmen) to the Air Force. (120) After the December 1961 
Secretary of Defense Conference in Hawaii, Secretary McNamara entered dis-
cussions with Secretary Rusk and worked out a compromise agreement whereby 
the subordinate command to be established under CINCPAC in Vietnam would be 
named the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, and would be 
roughly modeled after the US Command in Taiwan. Secretary McNamara continued 
to insist that COMUSMACV must be a four-star Army commander in order to 
emphasize the "positive impact of Change" in US policy. (121) 
After Presidential approval and selection of Lt. Gen. Paul D. Harkins 
as COMUSMACV, the US Military Assistance Command was established in Saigon 
on 8 February 1962, and Harkins was promoted to four-star rank. As COMUSMACV,

Harkins was charged with the mission of assisting and supporting the 
Government of Vietnam in its efforts to provide for its security, to defeat 
Communist insurgency, and to resist avert aggression. COMUSMACV was assigned 
direct responsibility for all US military policy, operations, and assistance 
in South Vietnam and the authority to discuss both US and Vietnamese military 
operations directly with President Diem and governmental leaders. He had 
direct access to CINCPAC and through him to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
Secretary of Defense. COMUSMACV was to consult with the US Ambassador on 
political and basic policy matters and was instructed to keep the Ambassador 
fully informed on military matters. In cases of difference in view, both 
CCMUSMACV and the Ambassador were to be free to communicate the difference 
to Washington for decision. As CINCPAC's single spokesman in South Vietnam, 
COMUSMACV was given operational command of all US forces and military agencies 
assigned or attached to his command, including the US MAAG. (122) 
As a subordinate unified commander to CINCPAC, General Harkins was 
authorized a MACV joint staff with representative Army, Navy, and Air Force 
officers in proper positions of responsibility. As seen, Admiral Felt had 
recommended to Washington on 8 December that the positions of MACV Chief of 
Staff, J-2 Intelligence, and J-5 Plans should be filled by Air Force officers, 
this in view of Felt's belief that air action would be important. General 
Harkins, however, wished to select Maj. Gen. Richard G. Weede, USMC, as his 
Chief of Staff and proposed that an Air Force officer should be assigned to 
the pivotal staff position as J-3 Operations instead of to the Chief of Staff 
post. In final recommendations to Secretary McNamara an 31 January 1962, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed to allocate the MACV staff positions of 
Commander, J-4 Supply, J-5 Plans, and J-6 Communications and Electronics to 
the Army; J-1 Personnel to the Navy; Chief of Staff to the Marines; and J-2 
Intelligence and J-3 Operations to the Air Force. (123) While in Hawaii on 
19 February, Secretary McNamara informed Admiral Felt that he was going to 
take the J-3 billet from the Air Force and give it to the Army. In Felt's 
view this would unbalance the MACV staff and he accordingly proposed that 
the rank of the J-5 position be up-graded to a brigadier general slot and 
allocated to the Air Force and that a colonel position as Deputy J-3 should 
also be changed from the Army to the Air Force. On the afternoon of 
20 February in Washington, General La:May personally attempted to persuade 
Secretary McNamara to change his mind about the J-3 position, but McNamara 
was unpersuaded in his intended action, although he remarked that he would 
re-examine the question should circumstances develop which mightwarrant 
reconsideration. As a consequence, General LeMay knew no alternative but 
to support Felt's recommendations. The Joint Chiefs also accepted the 
CINCPAC proposals and with Secretary McNamarals consent they approved a 
MACV manning authority on 2 March which allocated the J-3 position to the 
Army and the J-5 and Deputy J-3 slots to the Air Force. In this allocation 
of the MACV staff positions, the Air Force received none of the key opera-
tional billets (Commander, Chief of Staff, Operations) and only one of the

five flag rank billets, this being the position of Assistant Chief of Staff 
Plans, which was initially filled by Brig. Gen, John A. Dunning and later by 
Brig. Gen. Milton B. Adams. Of the 105 officer spaces authorized on the 
MACV staff, the Army was allotted 54, the Navy and Marines 29, and the Air 
Force 22. (124) 
In the organizational planning for MACV the Joint Chiefs of Staff and 
Admiral Felt envisioned that MACV would be the superior headquarters to the 
US MAAG and to Army, Navy, and Air Force component commands, the Navy component 
to be organized at a later date if required: As managed by General Harkins, 
however, the organization of MACV components deviated significantly from the 
JCS planning. In the case of the US MAAG, operations and intelligence functions 
which had been bogging down the organization were moved to MACV. Maj. Gen. 
C. J. Timms, who had been serving as Deputy to General McGarr, was appointed 
Chief of the MAAG, which continued to be divided into Army, Navy, and Air 
Force sections and responsible for MAP plans and programs, providing training 
and logistical advice and assistance to the RVNAF, and administration of US 
field advisory detachments with the RVNAF. (125) Although Harkins expressed 
satisfaction with the division of MACV and MAAG functions, the dividing line 
was less neat than it appeared. In the reorganization, Harkins did not want 
General Anthis to serve as both MACV air component commander and Chief of 
the MAAG Air Force Section, and at Harkins' suggestion Admiral Felt directed 
on 12 May that Anthis be relieved as Chief of the MAAG Air Force Section and 
that the position be filled iwith the USAF Colonel who was the incumbent 
Deputy Chief of the Air Force Section. Felt also requested General LeMay to 
issue the necessary orders to accomplish the change. From the Air Force view 
the action promised to complicate a situation whereby Air Force liaison 
officers with ARVN divisions should be under Anthis' command but were instead 
assigned to the MAAG. General LeMwr, moreover, objected to thel nrcposed 
reduction in rank of the Chief, MAAG Air Force Section, and delayed issuing 
any orders until Anthis' authority as MACV air component commander could be 
more clearly defined. In October Felt and Harkins would agree to accept 
Brig. Gen. Robert R. Rowland as Chief, MAAG Air Force Section, and, effective 
on 1 December 1962, Anthis was relieved of the MAAG duty and General Rowland 
took over a few days later. Although Anthis and Rowland worked together in 
close cooperation, the division of functions between the two left some 
"gray areas." Some of the Air MAAG people were responsible for advising and 
training in connection with MAP matters. How far they could go in advising 
before they entered into operational activities, or in their training before 
they became operators, posed some recurring differences of opinion. (126) 
The organization of MACV subordinate force commands led to numerous 
complications and resulted in deviations from usual standards for joint action 
of US Armed Forces. The MACV Air Force Component Command was established on 
10 February, when PACAF designated Commander, 2d Advon as the MACV air component 
commander, with the additional specification that Commander, 2d Advon would

continue to serve as the Thirteenth Air Force/PACAF forward air commander 
responsible for any unilateral Air Force operations in Southeast Asia. (127) 
On the other hand, General Harkins conceived that COMUSMACV was "responsible 
for all that US military do or fail to do in SVN" and argued that he should. 
have full operational command over all US military resources in South 
Vietnam, including any projected combat operations that might be performed 
by the Farm Gate detachment. He also maintained that he should have command 
over the service support for Army and Air Force units deployed in South 
Vietnam. In spite of Harkins' arguments, Admiral Felt issued a directive 
an MACV command relations on 20 April which established the principle that 
all US military units deployed to South Vietnam with the primary mission of 
advising and assisting the training and operations of South Vietnamese 
military and paramilitary forces would be under the operational command of 
COMUSMACV, but other units deployed to South Vietnam in a supporting role 
would remain under the command of CINCPAC component commanders, unless 
voluntarily placed under COMUSMACV. In exercising operational command, 
moreover, COIMUSMACV would act through his component commanders, this being 
a provision that General Anthis considered to be very important in view of 
the thin USAF representation on the MACV staff. (128) Under the MACV command 
relationship directive of 20 April, Commander, 2d Advon was responsible to 
COMUSMACV for training and assistance matters inside South Vietnam and to 
Thirteenth Air Force/PACAF for unilateral service matters and prospective 
combat operations in Southeast Asia. Unlike the Air Force choice in command 
relationships, the CINC Army Pacific elected to give COMUSMACV operational 
command over DS Army helicopter companies in South Vietnam. Established as 
the MACV component Army command, the US Army Support Group, Vietnam, provided 
only administrative and logistical support to Army units in Vietnam, and 
General Harkins exercised direct operational command over Army helicopter 
companies through the MAAG Senior Army Advisors at each ARVN corps. This 
arrangement appeared contrary to aocepr-ad US Armed Forces organizational 
principles which specified that a unified commander should not personally 
command one of the component forces. It also required that the MACV joint 
staff handle many peculiar Army matters, more appropriately the work of an 
Army component command staff. In regard to a MACV Navy component command, 
Admiral Felt continued to believe that there was no requirement for it. On 
1 July 1962, however, the MACV structure was rounded out with the establish-
ment of Headquarters Support Activity Saigon. Since the Department of the 
Navy was responsible for the logistical support of CINCPAC, the Headquarters 
Support Activity Saigon was a Department of Navy agency which provided 
common administrative and logistic support including construction, commissary 
and exchange, and housekeeping services to MAAG and MACV units. (129) 
In view of the publicity accompanying the establishment of the Military 
Assistance Command Vietnam an 8 February, Lt. Gen. Thames S. Moorman, Vice 
CINCPACAF, taw no reason why 2d Advan should continue to be a secret and 
freakish organization. The fact that the anonymous Detachment 7, Thirteenth

Air Force, was known as "2d Advon" was classified, and it was very difficult 
to process classified orders for the movement of personnel, equipment, and 
supplies to 2d Advon and its anonymous units. On 20 February Moorman asked 
Felt to accept a reorganization of 2d Advon as a standard USAF air division, 
thus providing a meaningful designation that could provide a basis for 
clearing up the air organization in Southeast Asia. (130) This proposal 
came at an inopportune time. The International Control Commission was 
examining the establishment of MACV to determine whether it was a violation 
of the Geneva agreements. In Washington Under Secretary of State George 
Ball urged that the United States should go along with the ICC and "play 
the game partly their way" by approaching problems on a case by case basis 
and maintaining "a decent veil of hypocrisy." In response to questions 
President Kennedy insisted that there were no US combat forces in Vietnam 
in the usual sense of the word, although he said that training missions 
were authorized to fire back in self-protection if fired upon. (131) In 
late February Admiral Felt and General Harkins considered that it would be 
impolitic to organize 2d Advon as an air division since this could be mis-
construed as the introduction of a large operational command. (132) 
In the course of a visit to South Vietnam early in April 1962 General 
LeMay and the members of his party determined that something must be done 
about the anomalous organization of 2d Advon and its non descript detachments. 
On some bases as many as nine separate air detachments were present, with no 
single individual in charge of them. LeMay's trip report recommended that an 
air division should be authorized to replace 2d Advon and that an air base 
structure should be organized at each major operating location, and the 
Department of Air Force unilaterally prepared to establish 2d Advon as an 
organized and constituted unit to which USAF units and personnel could be 
legitimately assigned. (133) While new organizational plans were being 
staffed two events hastened their acceptance and affected their tenor. As 
will be seen, US forces were deployed to Thailand on 15 May, and at this 
time General Harkins was designated COMUSMACTHAT as well as COMUSMACV. 
And on 2 June, the Vietnam ICC found North Vietnam to be in aggression but 
nevertheless recorded that establishment of USMACV constituted a violation 
of the Geneva agreements. (134) In view of these PACAF issued orders on 
7 June officiPlly redesignating the Thirteenth Air Force detachments: 
Detachment 7 was designated 2d Advon, Thirteenth Air Force; Detachments 
8, 9, 11, and 12 were discontinued and the 6220th, 6221st, 6222d, and 
6223d Air Base Squadrons were designated and organized at Tan Son Nhut, 
Bien Hoa, Da Nang, and Nha Trang Air Bases, with assignment to 2d Advon. 
(135) On 19 July Ambassador Molting was no longer opposed to the organiza-
tion of an air division in South Vietnam, provided it was accomplished 
without publicity. After SOMB delay incident to discussions of an overall 
US command in Southeast Asia, Hq 2d Advon was discontinued an 8 October 
1962, and the 2d Air Division was concurrently organized at Tan Son Nhut 
with assignment to the Thirteenth Air Force and under the command of General 
Anthis. (136)

In manning the two Air Force general officer positions authorized in 
Saigon, Generals LeMay and ()Mennen had handpicked Anthis and Dunning and 
were completely satisfied with them, but LeMay and 0Mbnnell nevertheless 
recognized that General Harkins required closer day-to-day associations 
with senior Air Force officers on the ?WV staff. Early in April during 
his visit to Saigon, LeMay attempted to persuade Harkins that there was a 
need for added air representation on the MACV staff, and Harkins agreed to 
consider it if Anthis or Dunning could make a convincing case. On returning 
to Washington General LeMay was very critical of the fact that air activities 
were "depreciated in South Vietnam rather than appreciated." At a Joint 
Chiefs of Staff meeting attended by Secretary McNamara, LeMay stated that 
air planning was often omitted from field operations in South Vietnam, that 
Anthis had difficulty getting to see. Harkins, and that neither General Harkins 
nor General Weede properly understood air operations. When asked to comment 
on the matter, Anthis readily agreed that he had direct access to General 
Harkins and had never been reluctant to give Harkins his views. Admiral Felt 
also informed Washington that Anthis: could see Harkins at any time and added 
that he considered Harkins and Weede to be superior officers who were fully 
experienced in air-ground tactics. (137) As will be seen, General LeMay 
would continue to work for increased air representation on the MACV staff 
without achieving positive results. 
As the US military command organization took shape in Southeast Asia 
during 1962 the Air Force was successful in establishing General Anthis as 
the single Air Force component commander in the area and in maintaining his 
command and control over USAF units. This arrangement insured that a single 
USAF officer would be responsible through General Harkins to Admiral Felt 
on bilateral matters and through the Thirteenth Air Force to PACAF on 
unilateral Air Force operational, slministrative, and logistical matters. 
(138) Other than this, the Air Force did not salvage much. While it was 
not always apparently easy for the Air S-Gaff in Washington to understand, 
the evolving CINCPAC organization was fairly well divorcing CINCPACAF from 
operational considerations and limiting his primary authority to the task 
of providing logistical support to the 2d Air Division. (139) The very thin 
Air Force representation in positions of responsibility on the MACV staff 
made it difficult for the 2d Air Division to secure a needfully expeditious 
staffing of air proposals through the preponderantly Army-manned MACV staff 
to the COMUS. In the pursuit of his duties General Harkins was necessarily 
absent from Saigon for periods of time with the result that his MACV staff 
carried on much of the business of command. Where it was true that General 
Anthis and the air officer who headed the MACV J-5 Plans Division -- initially 
General Dunning and later General Adams -- had direct access to General 
Harkins, it was also true that General Anthis found that at least some of his 
written communications were only belatedly referred to Harkins' attention. 
In addition, Harkins followed the Army practice of using his J-3 Division

for day-to-day operational planning, with the result that the MACV J-5 
Plans Division was somewhat outside the routine activity of the MACV staff. 
As a matter of fact, the J-5 Division was physically located in another 
part of Saigon, some distance from the main MACV staff offices. (140) 
During 1962 the deficiencies in the MACV staff were very clear to Air Force 
officers who were attempting to establish a control medium through which 
air and ground power could make a maximum cooperative contribution to 
counterinsurgency operations, but the deficiencies were not so easily 
recognized by other influential men who appeared to believe that counter-
insurgency. was predominantly an Army mission and that VNAF-USAF contributions 
to such operations would be limited.

Chapter 5 
Air Actions Against the Vietcong in 1962 
1. Emerging Concepts of Military Strategy 
At the time that the expanded Aterican assistance effort for South 
Vietnam was authorized in November 1961 the Vietcong believed that victory 
was virtually in their grasp. Their forces surrounded Saigon and other 
urban centers and were effectively blocking many of South Vietnam's strategic 
highways. (1) In the American assessment of the situation at the end of 
1961 the Communists had completed the first phase of insurgency -- organiza-
tion of a subversive organizational apparatus -- and had begun second-phase 
overt military attacks led by hard-core guerrilla forces, most of wham had 
been trained in North Vietnam. During the first four months of 1962 as many 
as 1,000 Communist cadremen were moving into South Vietnam each month, and 
in addition the North Vietnamese were using Soviet airlift support to main-
tain two regiments in the Lao panhandle for probable commitment in South 
Vietnam. It was possible that the Communists meant to move through the 
Central Highlands and cut South Vietnam in half. On the other hand, there 
were reports that the Vietcong were attempting to build up supplies within 
Zone D sufficient to sustain operations of a division-sized force against 
Saigon. (2) 
In the American view the composite North Vietnamese-Vietcong threat to 
the Republic of Vietnam demanded a centralized nation-wide counterinsurgency 
strategy which would provide security for Saigon and the other major govern-
mental and communications centers and lines of communications, keep the 
Vietcong off balance with strike and destroy operations, clear and hold the 
Vietcong base areas, and seal off South Vietnam's land and sea borders against 
further infiltrations from North Vietnam. (3) Dien, however, feared a RVNAF 
coup against his government and remained unwilling to accept the central 
military authority required for nation-wide counterinsurgency strategy. In 
January and February 1962, however, he gradually acknowledged a general con-
cept for national action against the Vietcong which was incorporated in 
separate plans for accomplishing various counterinsurgency tasks. Each plan 
represented compromises, and more often than not the separate plans were 
poorly intercoordinated. (4) 
In discussions concerning employment of military forces against the in-
surgency, President Diem wanted VNAF and Farm Gate to insure that the Communists 
did not provide aerial resupply to the Vietcong as they had been doing for the 
Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese in Laos. In conversations with Generals 
O'Donnell and McGarr, Diem was also quite willing to authorize saturation air 
attacks against the Vietcong war zones without much concern for exact targeting 
in these areas, which he assumed to be solidly hostile since ARVN forces were 
unable to enter then. Neither O'Donnell nor &Garr was willing to undertake 
indiscriminate bombing that could well be counterproductive to pacification 
efforts. (5) In his post as head of the British Advisory mission,

SECRt I 
Sir Robert Thompson was quite fearful that air actions would result in 
innocent casualties with a resultant alienation of potentially friendly people 
from the government cause, and this same fear was shared by influential men 
in the US State Department, including Assistant Secretary Harriman and Roger 
Hilsman. (6) 
On the basis of his experience in Malaya, where the Chinese insurgency 
had been limited to one country and had received little or no outside assistance, 
Sir Robert Thompson actively advocated the necessity for a governmental pacifi-
cation infrastructure of strategic hamlets in South Vietnam. He considered 
that South Vietnam's villages were the foundation of the countryrs social life, 
as well as the source of food and manpower for Vietcong irregular forces. 
These ideas were well received by President Diem late in 1961, and Thompson 
developed them into a "Delta plan" of proposed operations. This Delta plan 
conceived that the rich agricultural regions along the Mekong were the most 
vital area of South Vietnam and that Diem should protect them by beginning 
to build strategic hamlets in relatively safe "white" areas controlled by 
the government and to extend them out into Communist dominated "red" areas, 
thus establishing a "spreading oil spot" pacification program which would 
result in a solid mantle of security. (7) Assistant Secretary of State 
Harriman agreed that the strategic hamlet program had merit since it had 
given victory in Malaya. Admiral Felt also thought that Thompson's concept 
was sound, but both he and General Lemnitzer disagreed with what Felt under-
stood to be Thompson's proposal "to concentrate on the Delta and forget about 
the rest of the country." Too great a concentration of effort in the Delta 
might result in losses in the northern ARVN I and II Corps Areas. (8) 
Under unusual circumstances the emerging strategic guidelines for counter-
insurgency operations in South Vietnam were worked out in context with pro-
posals that were acceptable to President Diem at Secretary of Defense 
Conferences held in Hawaii on 15 January and 19 February 1962. Diem would 
not accept a single RVNAF task force for counterinsurgency operations because 
of internal political reasons, but he was willing to agree that each ARVN 
coprs should establish a "forward command post" to control counterinsurgency 
clear and hold operations within each of the corps areas. Diem had already 
initiated the strategic hamlet program under Nhu's guidance in September 
1961, and on 3 February 1962 he signed a decree designating an Inter-Ministry 
Committee for Strategic Hamlets under Nhu with the mission of developing a 
national plan for secure villages to include technical, logistical, and 
administrative aspects. He wanted to construct 6,066 defended hamlets during 
1962, in addition to 784 already constructed and 453 under construction. 
When Diem would not agree to conduct a major operation against Zone D, 
Secretary McNamara directed on 15 January that this plan should be dropped 
and that plans for a smaller clear-and-hold operation should be prepared. 
In response to this direction, Admiral Felt's staff surveyed Vietnam and 
determined that Binh Duong province was an optimum area for a clear-and-hold 
operation since it contained significant Vietcong groups which hazarded Saigon__ 
and Bien Hoa. In Thampson's view Binh Duong province was a "red" area which

SECRET 
if cleared would be difficult to hold without a considerable commitment of 
ARVN troops to maintain security. Diem nevertheless accepted the Binh Duong 
operation -- to be called Operation Sunrise -- and to be implemented in 
March 1962 -- as the publicized beginning of the national strategic hamlet 
program. When Thompson pointed out the potential defects of Sunrise to Diem, 
Diem responded: "It makes the Americans happy, and it does not worry either 
me or the Viet Gong!" (9) 
After uncertain beginnings the combination of decentralized ARVN clear 
and hold operations and the loosely directed strategic hamlet program rapidly 
burgeoned into the major strategic undertaking against the Vietcong. Reflecting 
the fears of Admiral Felt and General Lemnitzer that too great an emphasis on 
the Delta might result in losses in the north, Secretary McNamara directed on 
19 February that attention should be given to a clear-and-hold operation in 
guerrilla ridden Quang Ngai province, the region of Vietcong activity on 
Vietnam's east coast which had never bee. completely returned to government 
contra. (10) Manifesting American interest in the hamlet program, the US 
Interagency Committee for Province .ichabilitation was established in April 
1962, and the United States undertook to provide some 1,830 hamlet construc-
tion kits during 1962 with additional projections for 1963. Nhu encouraged 
each province commander to establish strategic hamlets, and the accelerated 
program progressed so rapidly that no one was sure how many were under con-
struction or where. In July 1962 General Harkins estimated that 2,400 had 
been built and that 6,000 should be completed by the end of the year. (11) 
In the strategic hamlet program and other political matters, Diem relied 
heavily on Nhu for decisions, but Diem also followed his own convictions. 
During July in the east coastal province of Phu Yen, he launched Operation 
Sea Swallow, which included an initial construction of strategic hamlets on 
the narrow coastal plan to protect a critical section of the main north-south 
road and rail lines. From this beginning, Diem envisioned that Sea Swallow 
would extend and enclave of strategic hamlets westward up the valleys into 
the Annamite foothills, thus cutting the Vietcong infiltration routes. (12) 
In August 1962, around Lac Thien, south of Ban Me Thout in Darlac province, 
Diem employed special force units 7,o bring in bulldozers in disassembled 
pieces and to construct strong points, an airstrip, and roads in the midst 
of a Vietcong area. All efforts by, the military to dissuade Diem from this 
activity fell on deaf ears, since he maintained that the operation was 
essential in order to protect the large area of rice cultivation around 
Lac Thien that would otherwise go to the Vietcong. Surprisingly, the Lac 
Thien operation was initially successful: the Vietcong moved out and govern-
ment forces secured and maintained control of the area. (13) 
2. Early Employments Test Counterinsurgency Tactics and Techniques

motivated air commando crews of the Farm Gate detachment -- came to Vietnam

changed orders from Washington instead charged them to train and supplement 
the VNAF and to develop tactics and techniques for air combat in a situation 
which Secretary McNamara described to the press as "not full-scale warfare 
but guerrilla warfare." (14) Since there was no initial agreement at higher 
levels concerning the strategy to be followed, the early military operations 
tended to be improvised rather than systematic, and there was no overall 
plan for the conduct of air operations which in the initial months took place 
on a day-to-day experimental basis. (15) 
Upon arriving at Bien Hoa the Farm Gate detachment found a run-down French 
air base, virtually surrounded by the Vietcong. This was well demonstrated 
in December, when the Vietcong captured an American Army sergeant travelling 
on one of the roads between Bien Hoa and Saigon. At this time American person-
nel were not allowed to possess sidearms off base, and they were instructed 
to move about in small groups for safety. According to reports the Vietcong 
had three companies of trocps in Bien Hoa province and four additional 
companies within 20 kilometers of Bien Hoa City. Approximately 700 ARVN 
soldiers defended the airfield, but heavy vegetation and swampy terrain sur-
rounding it promised easy cover to any of the enemy who wished to make a 
surprise attack. The flight surface at Bien Hoa used by the Farm Gate planes 
and the AD-6s of the VNAF 1st Fighter Squadron consisted of a single pierced 
steel plank runway 5,800 feet long and 150 feet wide. Tearouts in the tie 
strips of the steel plank required constant attention of welding crews, and 
the 315th Air Division C-130s that brought Barn Door communications equipment 
to Bien Hoa for the tactical air control system further deteriorated the 
PSP runway. (16) 
After completing local familiarization and orientation flights, Farm Gate 
undertook its immediately assigned task of teaching ccunterguerrilla tactics 
and techniques to the already combat capable flight crews of the 1st VNAF 
Fighter Squadron. At Nha Trang in November and December USAF T-28 mobile 
training teams were beginning to provide pilot transition and technical 
training for the newly formed 2d VNAF Fighter Squadron, which was being 
equipped with T-28 tactical fighters. After completion of transition at 
Nha Trang, the new T-28 pilots were brought to Bien Hoa for gunnery, bombing 
and rocketry training by the Farm Gate detachment. As handled by Farm Gate, 
this training cycle lasted three weeks per class. (17) With the return of 
Colonel King to the United States, Lt. Col. Robert L. Gleason assumed command 
of Farm Gate on 21 December 1961, and the detachment continued training while 
awaiting expected combat employment. This first American combat mission 
came on the afternoon of 26 December, when General Anthis believed that Farm 
Gate was cleared to strike and sent an attack against a collection of Vietcong 
sampans located on a waterway near Saigon. The strike was successful against 
a clearly hostile target, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued immediate 
orders that Farm Gate would be employed on combat missions only when the VNAF 
did not have the capability to perform the missions and then only with a 
combined US and VNAF aircrew. (18)

The operating restriction limiting Farm Gate to combat missions that 
would not be performed by VNAF and then only with mixed USAF-VNAF aircrews 
left same doubt about a profitable employment for the American airmen. 
Already proficient Vietnamese AD-6 pilots were not T-28 qualified and, while. 
committed to do so on a day-to-day basis, did not enjoy flying with Farm Gate 
in the back seats of T-28s when they could be piloting their awn AD-6s. The 
pilots fram the 2d VNAF Squadron who were being prepared for combat in T-28s 
fitted the back seat employment much better, but here too there was a 
difficulty: Occasionally, it was proposed that all of the new T-28 pilots 
should be flown in a front seat position in combat missions prior to com-
pleting their training with Farm Gate, but this was to be rejected because 
it seemed imperative that the pilot actually flying an aircraft on operational 
missions with heavy ordnance should be completely qualified. And after the 
VNAF pilot became completely qualified there was no need for a Farm Gate 
instructor pilot to fly a rear seat position. In short, it was soon obvious 
that the back-seat operational training for VNAF pilots might be more 
political than utilitarian. (19) 
Under the stated restrictions affecting Farm Gate, several employments 
of the American unit appeared possible and were undertaken. Implementing 
CINCPACis requirement for a coastal surveillance to determine the magnitude 
of waterborne infiltration into South Vietnam, Farm Gate employed an SC-47 
and two T-28s in Operation Short Coant air surveillance flights, the first 
series between 6-22 December 1961 and the second series between 5-7 February 
1962. In the December Short Count flights the Farm Gate planes sighted 
6,294 junks and sampans moving in South Vietnam's coastal waters. While 
these sightings were recorded, the air crews were unable to determine whether 
or not a given vessel might be hostile, and MAAG Vietnam was unable to develop 
meaningful intelligence fram the surveillance. (20) 
In the USAF concept for counterinsurgency operations, a capability for 
waging airborne psychological warfare was of high importance, and Farm Gate's 
SC-47s had a capability both for dropping leaflets and for disseminating 
information by aerial broadcasts. Such an ability to broadcast messages to 
people in remote and semi-literate areas held definite potential, and the 
Farm Gate SC-47s were equipped with a loud-speaker system mounted underneath 
the planes. From 14 December through 11 February 1962, Farm Gate flew seven 
psychological warfare missions, four of them over Vietcong-dominated areas. 
In the first tests of the aerial broadcast technique, Vietnamese villagers 
were impressed by the voice fram the sky, but the belly-mounted speakers 
proved to be only marginally effective and potentially hazardous. To deliver 
an intelligible message with this speaker configuration the 5C-47 had to 
make a run over a target at an altitude of 600-feet and with an airspeed 
of 100 knots or less, and even then the message length time could not exceed 
about 50 seconds. Mountainous terrain or enemy ground fire would obviously 
make such low-level broadcasts very hazardous. Amore powerful speaker 
system was a definitereqairement !but meanwhile the Farm Gate personnel got 
improved operating results by removing the belly speakers and mounting them 
in the door of the SC-47. This configuration allowed the aircraft to circle

a given spot while a crewman kept the speakers aimed at a specific target. 
Even with this change, the SC-47 still had to operate at a hazardous altitude 
of 400-600 feet. On a psychological warfare-leaflet dropping mission near 
Dalat on 11 February, Farm Gate lost its first aircraft when a low-flying 
SC-47 crashed from unknown causes with the loss of six USAF, two US Army, 
and one South Vietnamese crewmen. As soon as news of the crash reached the 
United States, Farm Gate's psychological warfare mission was in trouble. 
Secretary McNamara received queries fram Congress and the public, and he 
himself was more than a little interested as to why eight Americans and only 
one Vietnamese had lost his life on a mission that was supposed to be flown 
to train the South Vietnamese. (21) 
Because of a lack of landing lights and usually unserviceable flight 
instruments, the VNAF tactical fighter pilots had little experience and less 
inclination to operate at night, even though the Vietcong habitually used the 
hours of darkness for their attacks against the small RVNAF outposts that 
were spread widely throughout South Vietnam. Farm Gate's SC-47s were equipped 
for dropping aerial flares to illuminate targets, and both the T-28s and 
B-26s were capable of night attack. On the night of 7 January, AIWN requested 
the VNAF to strike a collection of sampans, and since VNAF pilots could not 
operate at night the Joint Operations Center directed Farm Gate to employ 
joint USAF/VNAF crews and to fly the mission with an SC-47 and two T-28s. 
The Farm Gate planes proceeded to the specified target area, and the SC-47 
crew illuminated the area. As it happened there were no sampans in the area 
and no ordnance was expended, but the tactics were thoroughly feasible. 
After this the JOC maintained a Farm Gate SC-47 on strip alert for night 
defense employment and cammitted either T-28s or B-26s to accompany the flare 
ship. In these night defense operations, the SC-47 approached the target 
area with the T-28s or B-26 in trail and about 2,000 feet higher. When the 
SC-47 illuminated the target the strike aircraft attacked the Vietcong. 
These tactics invaribly forced the Vietcong to break off their attacks, but 
they were not so successful in destroying enemy troops, who rapidly faded 
back under jungle cover as soon as they saw the flares. Many forts and hamlets, 
moreover, lacked rapid communications required to let the JOC know that they 
were under attack. Under Farm Gate tutelage VNAF C-47 crews began to fly some 
of the nigitiflare missions on 5 February, but the VNAF tactical fighter pilots 
remained reluctant to participate in the night operations. (22) In January 
1962 General LeMay proposed that the combination of flare-fighter defense 
offered a fruitful potential for development as a means of protecting the 
new strategic hamlets. LeMey proposed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff an outline 
plan for quick reaction forces consisting of AWN airborne troops, either 
Mule Train or VNAF air transport detachments, and VNAF T-28 strike aircraft. 
He proposed to deploy these forces at nine locations in South Vietnan placing 
any area within 50 miles of one of the quick reaction forces. He also proposed 
that trained communications teams should be established in each South Viet-
namese village (a village being a collective grouping of dispersed hamlets) 
to forward requests for assistance and to direct the quick reaction forces

to objective areas. The Joint Chiefe approved the concept and sent it to 
CINCPAC. The CINCPAC staff thought the concept good, but the staff shelved 
the plan for several months because of its requirement for an extensive 
communicationa network and because of the possibility that it would idle 
mobile airborne reserve forces. while they were standing by awaiting 
occasional employment. (23) 
Both VNAF and Farm Gate were available for the close support of ARVN 
operations, including cover and support for air mobile force employments. 
The first combined US/South Vietnamese employment of air mobile forces 
occurred between 23-30 December 1961 in an area held by the Vietcong north-
west of Saigon. On the first day the two US Army helicopter companies lifted 
360 Vietnamese airborne troops to five locations in the objective area, and 
additional troops were helicoptered in an 27 December. During the critical 
phases of the helicopter lifts, a VNAF airborne forward air controller (FAC) 
L-19 and two ADI-6s orbited the area, but no targets appeared. This exercise 
resulted in two Vietcong killed, one wounded, and 46 suspects captured. 
Another larger cambined air-ground ooeration was mounted on 5 January 1962 
in an attempt to rescue prisoners iincluded the captured US noncan) from a 
reported Vietcong prison camp. Under cover of AD-6s, T-28s, and B-26s 
which expended ordnance in preparatory strikes directed by a VNAF airborne 
FAC, approximately 1,000 ARVN troops were landed in lifts made by 31 H-21 
helicopters. Here again the operation was a successful training exercise, 
but the information about a Vietcong prison camp in the area proved erron-
eous. (24) .In his analysis of the large-scale WRAF strike and destroy 
operations conducted during January and early February, General Timmes drew 
the lessons that preliminary aerial reconnaissance of the objective areas 
sometimes resulted in loss of surprise, same of the plans were too complex 
for the state of training of the RVNAF, movement of ARVN troops tipped off 
the Vietcong to the operation, and there was a need for better coordination 
through the Joint Operations Center between ground and air units. (25) 
In the same weeks new tactics and techniques were under development by 
Farm Gate, the Ranch Hand C-123 aerial spray detachment was having difficulty 
with its defoliation operations. Leaving three of its aircraft at Clark, 
Ranch Hand deployed three of its C-123s to Tan Son Nhut. Each of these planes 
was fitted with an internal 1,000-gallon chemical tank and demountable spray 
bars attached under their wings. On 13 January the three aircraft at Tan Son 
Nhut began to spray a swatch 200 meters wide on each side of Route 15 for the 
distance of 43 miles between Bien Hoe. and Vung Tau. Between 13 and 16 January, 
ten sorties were flown to spray the 6,812 acres of jungle growth along Route 
15, the spray being dispensed on a basis of approximately one gallon per acre. 
Camplete defoliation was expected to occur within ten days after spraying, 
but while leaves turned brown the Vegetation remained alive and there were 
very few immediate military advantages. Several attempts were made to burn 
the sprayed areas, but these were also unsuccessful. The Vietcong had a 
field day with the spraying: they not only claimed that the spraying con-
stituted chemical warfare, but they encouraged the Vietnamese peasants to

believe that any plant that died anywhere was due to the spraying. The 
Government of Vietnam established a board to sift and evaluate claims for 
accidental destruction, but any claim that was turned down would obviously 
antagonize the claimant. Early in February it was clear that the spray 
project's start had been badly managed. General O'Donnell described it as 
"a blooper from start to finish." PACAF was not at all opposed to a prospec-
tive decision that would discontinue the herbicide program and convert the 
Ranch Hand C-123s back into standard transport planes as an augmentation to 
Mule Train. (26) 
3. Air Defense at Saigon and Pleiku 
One of the purposes of the expanded American assistance to South Vietnam 
in 1961 had been to provide insurance against the possibility that the Soviet 
Union might expand its airlift flights already being flown in Laos and provide 
aerial support to the Vietcong in South Vietnam. Air defense was also a 
reason for establishing the Tactical Air Control System in South Vietnam: 
the Barn Door operations plan for the TACS issued by PACAF/Thirteenth Air 
Force in December 1961 provided that the Joint Operations Center at Tan Son 
Nhut would "allocate and control all available or assigned tactical air 
resources for counter air (air defense), interdiction, close air support, 
reconnaissance, airlift, and special air operations. (27) In accordance 
with existing US Army-USAF joint doctrine, a Joint Operations Center was 
expected to provide a unity of control over air defense, air interdiction, 
and air support for ground forces. 
Employing transport aircraft which were operational at Hanoi, the Soviets 
had an ability to provide either overt or covert aerial resupply to Vietcong 
forces in South Vietnam, and early in 1962 there were rumors in Hue that the 
Vietcong forces in the Central Highlands were receiving clandestine air 
resupply drops. The air warning radars at Tan Son Nhut and Da Nang frequently 
picked up unidentified tracks of flying objects that sometimes proved to be 
atmospheric phenomena but were more often US Army aircraft which were making 
flights unknown to the Combat Reporting Center at Tan Son Nhut. Ekperience 
with the Da Nang radar, moreover, showed that terrain screening to its west 
was such that early warning and detection of medium and low flying aircraft 
was inadequate. If Communist planes did enter South Vietnam's airspace they 
would have to be intercepted with AD-6s, T-28s, or B-26s, none of which were 
admirably suited for the purpose. (28) In order to provide unity of air 
action in South Vietnam General O'Dbnnell made a strong recommendation at 
the 19 February Secretary of Defense Conference for what he described as the 
need for "law and order in the air," or maintenance of centralized control 
and coordination of all air operations -- including helicopter combat support 
operations -- by the Joint Operations Center. The discussion which ensued 
indicated apparent agreement by all participants that all air operations 
should be closely coordinated by the JOC both to insure effective air defense 
and tactical air operations. (29)

SKR" 
Guy, 
Although the air defenses of South Vietnam were designed to defend 
against Communist intrusions, the air defense system was first tested and 
found wanting by two personally disaffected Vietnamese flyers. On the 
morning of 27 February, two VNAF lieutenants diverted their combat-loaded 
AD-6s from a planned air strike in the Delta and repeatedly attacked the 
north wing of President Diemls Gia Long Palace with 500-1b. general purpose 
bombs, napalm, rockets, and 20-mm. gun fire. Antiaircraft fire shot dawn 
one of the AD-6s and its pilot was captured; the other pilot escaped to 
Phnon Penh where he emerged uninjured fram a.crash landing. During the 
attack the VNAF 1st Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa launched two flights of 
AD-6s in an effort to intercept the rebels, but these planes were unsuccess-
ful in their main mission and also picked up numerous hits from small arms 
fire'. Farm Gate aircraft at Bien Hoa were scrambled to avoid possible 
destruction on the ground; the American pilots found themselves in the air 
without knowing whether their "guns were hot" or who the enemy might be. 
Interrogation of the captured VNAF lieutenant eventually indicated that the 
two pilots were engaging in a personal vendetta against Ngo Dinh Nhu and that 
there was no general VNAF plot agaitst President Diem. While the investiga-
tion continued, however, Diem grounded the VNAF, and, as will be seen, VNAF 
aircraft operating in the III Corps Area around Saigon would not be permitted 
to carry heavy ordnance as a result of this incident. In the immediate 
aftermath to the attack on the Presidential Palace it was obvious that South 
Vietnam's air defenses were imperfect and that President Diem would not be 
willing to agree that the air defenbe system should be given controlling 
authority over ARVN antiaircraft fire. (30) 
In view of the Da Nang radar's inability to cover the western approaches 
to South Vietnam and the limited range of the light radar operated by the 
VNAF at Pleiku, PACAF forwarded nn P.5 March an rnmediate requirement to 
CINCPAC for the location of a USAF heavy radar at Ubon, Thailand, where the 
set would be able to cover air movements over southern Laos and northwestern 
South Vietnam. PACAF also asked for a deployment of F-102 jet interceptors 
from the Philippines to South Vietnam if this were politically feasible. (31) 
In March Vietcong activities were soaring toward a new all-time high of 1,861 
armed attacks, incidents of terrorism and sabotage, and subversive operations, 
causing apprehension that the Communists might make an even more substantial 
move to escalate the wax. (32) On the night of 19/20 March the newly opera-
tional VNAF radar at Pleiku -- nicknamed "Pagoda" -- picked up seven unknown 
tracks in flight over the Central Highlands. In an attempt at an interception, 
Farm Gate scrambled an RB-26 from Bien Hoa and when it arrived in the area 
Pagoda control placed the B-26 crew directly over one of the unknown tracks. 
The RB-26 crew, however, was unable to see anything below it. Visual recon-
naissance next day sighted some bundles in the trees in the general area of 
the previous night's suspected hostile air activity. On the night of 20/21 
March Paris CRC at Tan Son Nhut observed sightings of unknown tracks coming 
out of Cambodia, but these tracks faded out when two Farm Gate T-28s were 
scrambled. As soon as the T-28s were recalled to Bien Hoa, Pagoda CRP at

Pleiku reported ten to fifteen tracks coming out of Cambodia, proceeding 
at 80-120 knots at low altitude. An SC-47 and two RB-26s were dispatched 
from Bien Hoa. The SC-47 dropped flares in the vicinity of the unknown 
tracks, but once again the RB-26 crews made no visual sightings. A Viet-
namese officer at Pleiku nevertheless reported that he monitored Chinese 
and Vietnamese radio transmissions which may have come from an unknown 
aircraft. (33) 
Already concerned about the soaring rate of Vietcong incidents, President 
Diem requested on the morning of 21 March that US jet interceptors should be 
brought to South Vietnam to deal with any repetition of enemy overflights. 
Ambassador Molting quickly cleared a deployment with Washington, and on 
22 March the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing moved a Water Glass detachment of 
three F-102 and one TF-102 jet interceptors to Tan Son Nhut from Clark Air 
Base, obstensibly for the purpose of VNAF training. The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff authorized US aircraft to engage and destroy hostile aircraft encountered 
inside the geographical limits of South Vietnam, if other practical means of 
bringing the hostile intruder under control were not possible. (34) At the 
Secretary of Defense Conference underway in Hawaii on 21 March Secretary 
McNamara gave immediate approval to an emergency proposal to move the mobile 
radar that the 5th Tactical Control Group was operating at Don Muang Airfield 
and to relocate it as a CRP at Ubon Airfield, Thailand, provided that the 
Thai government would approve. (35) The speedy arrival of the Waterglass 
F-102 jets at Saigon favorably impressed the Vietnamese government with the 
American intention to react quickly in the event that the Communists raised 
the tempo of operations in South Vietnam. (36) As a matter of fact, however, 
the air defenses of South Vietnam remained far fram perfect. In day training 
missions flown from Tan Son Nhut, theF-102s were much too fast to intercept 
low, slow-flying liaison planes which simulated enemy intruders. Accumulated 
experience also showed that two pilots in a TF-102 would have a better change 
for an interception than a single pilot in an F-102,, with the result that 
subsequent rotational Water Glass deployments to Saigon employed TF-102s 
drawn from the Fifth and Thirteenth Air Force. On 31 July Admiral Felt 
ordered the F-102s to be relieved by three US Navy AD-5Q interceptor aircraft 
from Cubi Point in the Philippines. These slower interceptors carried a 
pilot and radar operator, and they were quite successful when operating with-
in 50 miles of Saigon. The Navy interceptors maintained the air defense alert 
for six weeks and were then relieved by the rotational Water Glass F-102s. (37) 
After an agreement was reached with the Government of Thailand, the 5th 
Tactical Control Group disassembled its mobile radar at Don MUang and moved 
it on a deployment called "Barn Door II" to Ubon Airfield in eastern Thailand, 
where this installation tied into the South Vietnamese air defenses was 
declared operational on 10 May 1962. (38) In their deployed locations the 
radars at Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang, Pleiku, and Ubon could cover the airspace 
of most of South Vietnam at altitudes above 5,000 feet, but because of 
screening by mountainous terrain they were limited in overlap coverage

at altitudes below 5,000 feet. Other sites where the coverage would have 
been more advantageous could have been obtained, but these sites were 
impracticable because of inaccessibility or insecurity. (39) Although 
General Anthis was never able to determine whether the Pleiku and Tan Son 
Nhut radars had actually sighted Communist aircraft on the nights of 19/20 
and 20/21 March and there would be later reason to discount this, the incidence 
rate of unknown radar tracks diminished after the expanded air defense system 
was established and air traffic control over South Vietnam improved. At 
Anthis' request, MACV issued a directive on 22 August 1962 that all US military 
aircraft would display radar identification signals if so equipped and would 
in any event contact and identity themselves to one of the radar control 
centers when they werewithin radio range of such a center. (40) This directive 
did not establish the "law and order in the air" under the Joint Operations 
Center thought necessary by General O'Donnell, but with the passing of months 
without any sign of enemy air activity General Harkins would state that every-
one knew that there was "no air battle in Vietnam, and there are no indications 
that one will develop." (41) 
4. Air Interdiction Proves Controversial 
Early in 1962 the combined capabilities of VNAF and,Farm Gate exceeded 
opportunities for their employment. General Anthis figured that Farm Gate's 
four B-26s and eight T-28s were capable of one operational sortie for each 
aircraft each day, but by political direction the Farm Gate planes could be 
employed only on missions that could not be performed by the VNAF and then 
only witha combined VNAF-USAF crew. In January 1962 the VNAF 1st Fighter 
Squadron also should have had an ability to fly at a rate of one operational 
sortie a day for each of its 20 AD-6s, but only in day operations since its 
crews were not trained for night and bad weather flying. (42) In World War II 
and Korea tactical airpower had to be able to interdict the flow of enemy 
supplies, equipment, and reinforcements into and within a battle area, and 
Air Force doctrine envisioned that air interdiction was second in importance 
only to the maintenance of friendly control of the air over the battle area. 
General Anthis understood these airpower lessons, and he went on record with 
the statement that aerial interdiction objectives -- such as Vietcong training 
areas, troop concentrations, supply depots, and sampans -- would comprise the 
"host lucrative targets" in South Vietnam. (43) In the initial planning for 
Vietnam, Admiral Felt and General O'Donnell conceived that interdictory air 
attacks against the Vietcong base areas in South Vietnam would be very 
effective in reducing these hostile redoubts, many of which had never been 
entered by AWN farces. (44) 
In the counterinsurgency environment of South Vietnam, however, the task 
of air interdiction was unusually complex. The Vietcong seldom wore distinc-
tive uniforms and usually intermingled with the civilian population, any 
sanpan could be either Vietcong or friendly, there were innocent people as 
well as Vietcong in the -Communist war zones. In this environment it was

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2013/09/23: CIA-RDP85B00236R000100010001-2 
obvious to General Anthis that successful air interdiction depended upon 
timely intelligence and effective aerial reconnaissance which would permit 
targeting for air interdiction strikes. (45) Intelligence and reconnaissance 
capabilities were weak in early 1962 and were slow to develop. Within the 
RVNAF the Vietnamese Air Force had two C745 transports that had been rigged 
with cameras for day photography; an RVNAF Air Photo Intelligence Center was 
located in the J-2 Division of the Joint General Staff and 12 Vietnamese 
photo interpreters were being trained to man the center; the Vietnamese L-19 
air observers were capable of visual reconnaissance, but the VNAF L-19 
squadrons were being drained of their most experienced pilots to man the new 
tactical fighter squadron. (46) Operating from Bangkok, Able liable RF-101s 
maintained a sustained sortie rate of 2.8 photo flights each day, and Able 
Mable flights were available to cover objectives of highest priority interest 
to MACV and the RVNAF, but this was a second priority effort during the first 
half of 1962 since the major national concern at this time called for photog-
raphy of Laos. When operating over South Vietnam the RF-101s customarily 
staged through Tan Son Nhut and upon the completion of their missions turned 
their film over to the USAF Photo Processing Cell (FPC) at Tan Son Nhut for 
Processing and interpretation. The RF-101 was a good vehicle for general war 
reconnaissance of clearly fixed hostile targets, but it was hardly appropriate 
for the situation in South Vietnam where the enemy customarily kept under 
heavy foliage by day and moved at night. (47) Scanty of human source intelli-
gence made the task of air reconnaissance much more difficult. One of the 
major US assistance efforts undertaken in December 1961 was to build up RVNAF 
intelligence activities with US intelligence advisors. The MACV J-2 Division 
was manned with 44 persons and 230 US military intelligence advisors were 
assigned to RVNAF units, but from the air viewpoint, the MACV intelligence 
organization was oriented toward Amy ground operations. (48) Under normal 
conditions RVNAF J-2 interrogations of captured prisoners should have provided 
significant human intelligence, but South Vietnamese law gave little time for 
questions since a prisoner could be held in military custody for only tvo 
days before being turned over to provincial authorities for a court hearing. 
(49) 
Although aerial reconnaissance and military intelligence shortcomings 
affected all military operations they were especially relevant to a prospec-
tive air interdiction activity. Early in 1962 requests for air interdiction 
strikes came to the VNAF-USAF JOC from province chiefs, ARVN units deployed 
in the field, and covert agents. If the VNAF accepted an approved inter-
diction target, USAF officers had no authority to question such a strike, 
but General Anthis demanded that mature consideration be given any inter-
diction mission to be flown by Farm Gate personnel. During daylight hours 
no strike was permitted unless the target was specifically marked by a VNAF 
FAC. During the hours of darkness, when use of a FAC was not feasible, 
additional assurances were required that there were no friendly people in 
the vicinity of a target. Essentially, however, the American airmen were 
completely dependent upon Vietnamese sources for tactical target information, 
and targets were usually described in vague terms such as "groups of huts," 
"troop concentrations," or "VC strong points" at specified map coordinates.

Despite elaborate precautions air strikes carried some element of danger, 
especially in the heavily populated and poorly mapped delta area. In one 
incident in January ARVN officers were particularly insistent upon securing 
an early morning air support strike against the Vietcong-dominated village 
of Bathu, located very close to the Cambodian border in the "Parrot's Beak." 
The VNAF lacked capability to fly a. mission that was to arrive at daybreak, 
and the Farm Gate commander initially turned down the mission because the 
target area was too close to the Cambodian border. The ARVN insisted that 
the mission was critically important, and on 21 January the Farm Gate 
commander led a strike in an SC-47 which he positioned along the Cambodian 
border and from which an airborne coordinator directed bomb, rocket, napalm, 
and strafing passes flown by eight T-28s and three RB-26s. A second C-47 
carried the Minister of Defense and the ARVN III Corps commander as observers. 
Although the Farm Gate commander was confident that no one made a mistake, 
three separate maps of the area planed the border in three different places, 
and on 22 January the Cambodian government charged that two single-engine 
fighters had crossed into Cambodia And killed one villager and injured three 
others. South Vietnam's Defense Minister Thuan shrugged off the incident 
since he said the whole area was a "VC hot bed," but at Washington's 
insistence South Vietnam subsequently issued an apology and provided monetary 
compensation. The US State Department also suggested that steps should be 
taken to minimize any further incidents that might disturb always delicate 
relations between South Vietnam and Cambodia. On 25 January General Anthis 
issued a secret directive providing that no Farm Gate strike would take place 
within five miles of the Lao-Cambodian borders during daylight or within ten 
miles of them at night. He recognized that the directive would give the 
Vietcong a sanctuary along the borders, but he pointed out that his directive 
did not affect the VNAF which could continue to operate up to the border 
provided there were no violations of Lao or Cambodian air space. (51) 
In view of the uncertainty about some portions of South Vietnam's borders 
General Anthis thought his order of 25 January to be a prudent safeguard, but 
he also believed that elsewhere in South Vietnam interdiction strikes could 
and should be properly managed against the Vietcong. On 29 January a joint 
VNAF-Farm Gate effort employing all available strike aircraft in flights 
from Bien Hoa, Pleiku, and Da Nang simultaneously attacked 14 carefully pin-
pointed enemy targets in five major target areas. Strike results were 
reported to be good. In a conversation with General Moorman, Defense Minister 
Thuan quoted a Vietcong document which indicated that the air strikes flown 
in Ba Mayen province had been exceptionally accurate. In fact, Thuan said 
that the Vietcong were becoming concerned about spies in their midst because 
of the timeliness and accuracy of the strikes. Despite assurances such as 
these, Moorman, Anthis, Molting, and McGarr had some nagging doubts about 
the validity of targets recommended by the South Vietnamese and needed as 
much assurance as they could get that hostile objectives were being hit. 
Toward this end on 3 February, General McGarr emphasized to the Joint General 
Staff the importance of developing accurate and timely intelligence for air 
strikes, exercise of proper controls to assure that only Vietcong targets 
were struck, and the need for maximum post-strike assessment of the results 
of air strikes. (52) Sensitive to Washington criticisms of air operations,

Admiral Felt prepared an assessment of the potentiality of air operations 
in Vietnam based upon an analysis of counterinsurgency experience in Greece, 
the French Indochina war, and Algeria. He was unwilling to accept restricted. 
air strikes that would make innocent and guilty suffer alike when Vietcong 
were detected in a village. He recognized that when friendly and hostile 
people were intermingled, the only positive system of target location was to 
employ ground forces who could identify the people who shot at them. But to 
wait until foot troops could run down and fix a will-of-the-wisp guerrilla 
enemy in considerable lumps would curtail the maximum employment of available 
airpower. Felt was personally impressed with the good intentions of RVNAF 
officers to avoid indiscriminate use of weapons against innocent people, and 
he believed that the problem of profitably directing air strikes could best 
be handled by developing an effective air/ground communication capability 
for close air support, and, as far as independent air attacks were concerned, 
everyone should be as careful as possible when attacking targets near 
friendly areas. (53) 
During early February US State Department officials were very concerned 
about air operations in Vietnam. An influential group, including Assistant 
Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs Harriman and Director of Intelligence and 
Research Hilsman, felt that air attacks could well be counterproductive to 
the pacification of South Vietnam since they wouldalienate the families and 
friends of innocent persons who might be accidental victims of air attack. (54) 
Secretary Harriman announced that he would attend the Secretary of Defense 
Conference to be held in Hawaii on 19 February, and it appeared that the 
future of air operations in Vietnam could well be determined in the discussions 
to take place at this time. ,General Anthis was warned of this eventuality and 
prepared himself to give a "make or break" briefing in Hawaii. 
As it happened the principal subject addressed at the Secretary of Defense 
Conference on 19 February was the emerging strategy for employment of ARVN in 
clear and hold operations and the concomitant strategic hamlet program, and 
General Anthis emphasized that close air support operations would contribute 
to the clear and hold activity at the same time that air interdiction strikes 
launched throughout South Vietnam would keep the enemy off balance. Anthis 
stressed that every effort was being made to prevent counterproductive air 
attacks and that the employment of airpower would become even more precise 
as improved intelligence generated better targets. After hearing Anthis' 
briefing, Ambassador Harriman quoted Sir Robert Thompson as having told him 
that bombing was not productive. Ambassador Nolting camnented that he felt 
air operations were best in a close ground support role rather than in inter-
diction. In a few general comments Secretary McNamara ruled that US partici-
pation in air missions should "balance risk vs gain," that air strikes must 
not trespass on Cambodia s borders, and that air operations should be 
conducted only when the net result would be "plus" -- they should not be 
attempted when there was a chance of killing innocent people in order to 
kill a few Vietcong. In other air matters, McNamara appeared impressed with

Anthis' discussion of flare strike air tactics for relieving outposts under 
night attack, and he saw no reason why strategic hamlets could not be provided 
with cheap but effective radios that would permit them to call for prompt 
military assistance. He directed CINCPAC and MACV to work with the US Opera-
tions Mission to provide hamlets with short range VHF-FM voice radio sets. 
McNamara was quite concerned that eight Americans and only one Vietnamese had 
been lost in the crash of the Farm Gate SC-47 psychological warfare aircraft; 
when he asked and was told that VNAF could take over psychological warfare 
operations, he stated that he did not want Americans to do anything that the 
Vietnamese could do. In the discussion of the aerial spray herbicide opera-
tions, the State Department view was that the mission was "too reminiscent 
of gas warfare . . . and the Viet Cong would use it to good propaganda 
advantage of the Americans making war on the peasants." Both O'Donnell and 
Moorman thought that defoliation should be phased out as militarily ineffective. 
McNamara, however, wanted the experiments with herbicides to continue: he would 
press ARPA to discover why the aerial spray technique had not worked. McNamara 
also stated three policies applicable to all US advisors in Vietnam: do not 
employ US personnel to do a job that could be done by the Vietnamese, do not 
expose US personnel to casualty hazards except where necessary in the perform-
ance of an assigned mission: do not refer to US activities as "combat opera-
tions" but rather as "training or support activities" regardless of the fact 
that incidental combat might be involved. (55) In context with these policies, 
Farm Gate surrendered psywar missions to VNAF as soon as a VNAF C-47 could be 
modified with speakers. Effective with the beginning of VNAF leaflet drops 
and psywar broadcast flights in March, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff directed 
that US aircraft would refrain from such operations except in unusual 
circumstances. (56) 
Where Air Force leaders in Washington had feared that Assistant Secretary 
Harriman would advocate very restrictive air operations at the meeting held 
in Hawaii on 19 February, General O'Donnell thought that Anthis' briefing was 
well received and had reduced interest in applying further restrictions to 
air operations. (57) In fact Secretary McNamara approved O'Donnell's suggestion 
for an added interdiction task which involved locating the sites of the 20 to 
4o Vietcong radio transmitters in South Vietnam with radio direction-finding 
planes and then destroying them with air strikes. (58) 
The issue of "indiscriminate" and "counterproductive" air attacks, however, 
was far from dead. During an orientation tour of Vietnam late in February, 
Brig. Gen. Harvey J. Jablonsky, US Army Chief of Infantry, was told by two 
Army advisors that the Vietcong were exploiting strafing and bombing attacks 
effectively for propaganda purposes. After an air attack the Vietcong were 
said to remove killed or wounded males, leaving only women and children, so 
that when the people returned to the village they got the impression that 
only women and children were targets of air strikes. After hearing Jablonsky's 
report, Ambassador Nolting assembled Generals Harkins, Timmes, Jablonsky, and 
Anthis on the afternoon of 3 March for a discussion centering around a 
positive identification of friends and foes. Nolting's immediate thought

was to reduce air activity, but Jablonsky could not provide any specific 
instances of indiscriminate air attacks, and Harkins urged that further 
restrictive actions would benefit the Vietcong. (59) In addition there 
was evidence that well managed interdiction based on good intelligence could 
be very successful. Thus on 2 March the ARVN II Corps commander requested 
an immediate air strike against a group of Vietcong who were holding a 
meeting in the village of Hung Nhon. The JOC validated the request and 
dispatched two VNAF AD-6s and a Farm Gate B-26, the latter required for 
augmented firepower. The strike surprised the Vietcong, and napalm, frag 
bombs, rockets, 20-mm., and 50-caliber fire killed at least 12 of the enemy 
and produced a large secondary explosion. (60) 
In a further debriefing at PACOM on 13 March, General Jablonsky repeated 
the charges that he had made in Saigon, adding that ARVN forces were not 
getting air support when they needed it.. Apparently-because of Jablonsky's 
allegations the Secretary of Defense Conference held on 21 March reopened 
the examination of air activity. At this time Ambassador Nolting did not 
suggest reducing air operations which were currently having a good effect, 
but he urged that they must be kept under close analysis to prevent the 
adverse effect of killing innocent people. Other participants including 
Secretary McNamara agreed that air operations should continue, but under 
strict controls and stringent intelligence criteria. In the view of Roger 
Hilsman, who returned to Washington from a trip to Southeast Asia at this 
time, the compromise in regard to interdictory air strikes brought the worst 
of two worlds: military men were disturbed by the stringent restrictions 
on air effort, while he and other State Department men fretted about the 
propaganda advantage of the air attacks to the Communists. (61) 
As a result of the controversy in regard to the possibility that air 
interdiction strikes might kill innocent people, General Anthis was on 
notice not to undertake an air strike that could injure the civil population. 
Effective implementation of the interdiction mission required timely intelli-
gence, which was difficult to obtain despite efforts to improve the intelligence 
establishment in Saigon. A proposal to establish a Joint Target Acquisition 
Group in Saigon to help solve the problem of preplanning air strikes against 
fixed targets was unacceptable to the Vietnamese for political reasons. (62) 
In a move to improve the flow of human source intelligence that might be 
obtained from prisoners of war, the Government of Vietnam gave the RVNAF 
jurisdiction over all prisoners who had infiltrated fram North Vietnam, who 
might be held in military custody pending interrogation. With assistance 
from American advisors the RVNAF Joint General Staff J-2 opened a prisoner 
of war interrogation center in Saigon. (63) In order to assist the RVNAF 
in handling human source intelligence of air force interest, Admiral Felt 
authorized the establishment of a detachment of the USAF 6499th Support 
Group in Saigon. Six officer and six. airman intelligence specialists from 
the 6499th reached Saigon during March 1962, but the detachment carmiander 
and another officer were soon removed because of lack of qualifications.

By July the 6499th Group detachment received authority so that its intelli-
gence specialists were permitted to place questions of air interest through 
RVNAF interrogators to prisoners held in the J-2 JIGS POW interrogation 
center in Saigon. (64) 
Under normal circumstances the JOC Intelligence Branch and the 2d Advon 
Intelligence Directorate might have used intelligence originating in Saigon 
and in the field to plan country-wide air interdiction activities, but the 
round rules of the war made these activities little more than "record 
keeping and statistic gathering agencies." (65) Any namination for a pre-
planned air strike originating in Saigon had to follow a lengthy verification. 
Thus the 2d Advon Intelligence Directorate could submit a recommended target 
to the JGS Air Photo Intelligence Center where further research was initiated 
and target data sheets and folders were prepared. One copy of the product 
was sent to the responsible local Vietnamese province chief for verification 
that the targets were hostile anc another copy to the JOC for preliminary 
planning. If the province chief verified the target and wanted it attacked 
he passed the word up to Field Command, which determined whether the target 
would be attacked by air or ground action. This process took from several 
days to several weeks. On the other hand, most intelligence actually 
originated at ARVN division/province chief levels, and these authorities 
usually originated the requests for action against identified enemy activities, 
these requests being passed fram division/province to the ARVN Corps, to the 
ASOC, and then to the JOC. In either procedure determination whether a 
target would be attacked rested solely with a local province chief, who was 
best able to certify that friendly people would not be hazarded by the 
military activity. (66) . 
The restrictive procedures made it difficult to attack Vietcong activities 
that could be discovered, and it was also true that hard intelligence of 
Vietcong activities remained difficult to obtain. General O'Donnell's 
expectation that the location of Vietcong radio transmitters could be pin-
pointed for air attack, for example, proved optimistic. In March special 
airborne homing radio units that had been developed for the US Army Security 
Agency were installed in three Army L-20s and it was thouglt that these 
planes could secure very accurate "fixes" of the sites of the enemy radios. 
Also in March, USAF delivered a C-54 aircraft, nicknamed "Hilo Hattie" and 
outfitted with a high frequency/direction finder, an infrared system, and 
cameras to include a 100-inch oblique installation, to the 6091st Recon-
naissance Squadron in Japan for testing against the Vietcong radio trans-
mitters in South Vietnam. Hilo Hattie flew its first operational mission 
from Tan Son Nhut on 12 April. The Army L-20s and Hilo Hattie revealed 
that there were more Vietcong transmitters in South Vietnam than had been 
thought, but the existing state of the art in high frequency/direction 
finding equipment did not permit a precise location of the radio sets. In 
the ten months after April 1962 the Hilo Hattie crew made five separate 
tours from Tan Son Nhut And flew a total of 102 special missions. The plane's

day and night camera systems worked well for ordinary photography, but the 
infrared and DF equipment could not be made to function satisfactorily. (67) 
In the spring of 1962 most air interdiction strikes were directed against 
small collections of Vietcong guerrillas and sampans which appeared near ARVN 
positions, but late in May meticulous oas/mAcv planning completed the targeting 
of the Do Xa war zone headquarters area of Interzone V for air attack. The 
targeting activity identified, authenticated, and prepared folders with photo-
graphs of 19 pinpoint objectives spread over an area of approximately 230 
square miles. Even though the objective area was under observation for some 
time, prestrike reconnaissance was flown on 25 May, and on the following day 
a Vietcong defector was flown over the area in a last re-validation of the 
targets. In repeated strikes on 27 May a composite force of VNAF/USAF 
aircraft flew 11 B-26, 11-AD-6, and 6 T-28 sorties against 14 of the pin-
pointed targets, five of the targets being found to be weathered out on this 
day. Despite the elaborate briefings, one B-26 crew hit a friendly village, 
killing four persons and destroying 10-12 structures. The strike pilots did 
not see any Vietcong, but bomb damage assessment photography showed an instal-
lation described as a command post destroyed, 140 other structures burned and 
destroyed, and 30 damaged. General Nguyen Khanh described the attacks as a 
"total success," and Ngo Dinh Nhu reported that approximately 400 Vietcong 
were killed. Vietcong defectors from Interzone V attributed their desertion 
to the bombing attacks. (68) In an assessment of the Do Xa attacks and also 
of the other limited air interdiction activity that had been conducted PACAF 
and 2d Advan officers considered that the air strikes disrupted Vietcong 
security in base areas that were beyond the reach of ARVN ground operations. 
In a message to Washington on 4 June, however, the American Embassy in Saigon 
questioned the wisdom of the 27 May attack, describing it as area bombing of 
a "strike zone covering . . . about 230 square miles." (69) Other unnamed 
"American observers" offered assessments that the results of the 27 May 
attack were exaggerated, that only about 50 enemy personnel had been killed, 
and that the commander of Interzone V had escaped the attack. (70) 
Most of the early controversy concerning air interdiction attacks involved 
assertions that they were counterproductive to pacification because they were 
apt to injure innocent people, but by the late spring of 1962 there was also 
a growing belief in the MACV J-2 Intelligence Division that air interdiction 
could not be made to be militarily effective against the Vietcong. (71) The 
first substantial activity of the J-2 was the assembly of data required for 
an initial Vietcong order of battle. Published on 15 April, this order of 
battle listed 18 battalions, 79 companies, and 136 platoons, with an overall 
Vietcong strength of 16,305 hard-core troops in South Vietnam -- the total 
being somewhat less than the 25,000 strength that the RVNAF had accepted. 
In addition to the regular troops, the Vietcong were estimated to possess 
a paramilitary organization of some 10,000 part-time guerrillas. (72) The 
order of battle fixed the tentative locations of the Vietcong hard-core 
forces in the base areas of the Nam Bo and Interzone V. (73) According to

MACV intelligence an additional 1,000 to 1,800 Vietcong infiltered from Laos 
between 1 May and 15 June, and enough of these men reached Zone D to encadre 
another Vietcong battalion. (74) 
Although the Vietcong were operating their hard-core forces from protected 
base areas, the MACV J-2 study on Vietcong logistics completed in June 1962 
described the enemy as being relatively invulnerable within his base areas to 
conventional attack, other than to ground operations that would isolate his 
forces from the populace and which would stop or substantially reduce infil-
tration from Laos. Some heavy weapons with ammunition, some small arms, and 
some medical supplies were brought from North Vietnam. In May 1962, for 
example, ARVN patrols captured several Chinese Communist weapons as well as 
several French submachineguns that had been modified to accept the common 
7.62-mm. ammunition used by Communist nations. Inside Vietnam, however, the 
Vietcong military structures rested upon an organized political echelon, a 
layer of part-time guerrillas, and finally the hard-core forces. Most Vietcong 
supplies including food were being procured inside South Vietnam. In the base 
areas the Vietcong would husband their resources and could sally forth for 
combat when they chose to do so. (75) 
After receiving and studying the MACV J-2 Vietcong logistics study, 
Admiral Felt informed General Harkihs on 9 July that he could not accept the 
conclusion that the Vietcong were relatively invulnerable to logistical 
problems in their base areas. In his view air strikes were already destroying 
bits and pieces of the Vietcong logistics system and he wanted them continued. 
In addition he wanted to send ARVN rangers and regular ARVN units into the 
Vietcong war zones to fight, guerrilla style. "It is, of course," Felt 
messaged, "basic to our side that the initiative be denied the VC. Our 
concept is to harass them, push them down and extend them far beyond the 
capabilities of their logistics support, thus destroying them." (76) General 
Harkins accepted the concept of small ARVN actions of longer duration, but 
he pointed out that ARVN commanders ,were not up to large-scale efforts except 
on rare occasions and that the ARVN .rangers lacked sufficient trained leader-
ship that they would require for extended field operations. (77) 
Unlike the ARVN, VNAF had an ability to carry the war into the tangled 
jungle areas held by the Vietcong, if it could obtain valid target intelligence. 
In a presentation to USAF Corps and Division air liaison officers on 9 August, 
Colonel Ralph A. Newman, ALO with the RVNAF Field Command, stressed the need 
to strike Vietcong concentrations before they could attack and instructed 
the new Liaison officers to work closely with ARVN division and regimental 
G-2 and G-3 personnel to identify air targets. Two days later, General Anthis 
asked Defense Minister Thuan to consider the fact that VNAF was flying a 
substantial number of sorties which did not have occasion to expend ordnance. 
Most of the VNAF crews were reluctant to land with unexpended external 
ordnance; hence since 1958 they had been accustomed to jettison their un-
expended stores in uninhabited areas -- called "free areas" -- near the

operational airfields. Anthis pointed out that better use could be made of 
unexpended ordnance. Each ASCC oukht to be furnished a list of pre-planned 
targets, which could be assigned as alternates to be hit if ordnance remained 
available after an escort mission. He also proposed that "free areas" 
could be designated in Vietcong territory, most desirably in Zone D. Anthis 
suggested to Thuan that Vietnamese province chiefs were familiar with Vietcong 
concentrations within their areas of responsibility and could be encouraged 
to submit both pinpoint and free area targets, which, of course, would be 
checked through ARVN intelligence channels prior to listing them for ordnance 
expenditure. (78) Even though the rules of engagement precluded apy classic 
armed air reconnaissance operations in Vietnam, General Anthis had a plan 
in August for activities along those lines. In deployments from their home 
bases to forward airfields, tactical aircrews were briefed to reconnoiter 
primary areas of Vietcong activity. If they encountered a likely air strike 
target, this information was passed to the TACS for the development of an 
immediate target mission. (79) 
General Anthis, the ASOC directors, and the air liaison officers pressed 
ARVN to designate pre-planned air targets, but the expanded interdiction 
program was slow in getting started. After a visit to Vietnam, General 
Moorman informed General Harkins on 3 September that the I and II ASOCs had 
no backlog of pre-planned air targets, and he advised General Harkins that 
a target backlog at each ASOC would insure better scheduling, distribution, 
and utilization of aircraft as well as keeping continuous pressure on the 
Vietcong. (80) On 12 September, Admiral Felt added support for air inter-
diction when he advised General Harkins that Zone D ought to be re-elevated 
to a top priority and that "area denial" techniques ought to be used to 
make this zone too hot for the Vietcong to occupy. "Entire extent of 
techniques and devices available for such purpose," Felt advised, "should 
be used. We have in mind, for example, scatter bombing with butterfly 
bombs, proven lethal in Korea, and other type AF mines. We also visualize 
use of chemical irritants and defoliants to expose targets for air strikes .... 
In other words we want to destroy or drive sick, starved, blistered, and 
blasted Viet Cong from Zone D so that we can scoop them up outside of their 
nest or prevent them from setting foot in the area again." (81) 
Spurred into action by Admiral Felt the MACV J-2 in coordination with 
the Joint General Staff commenced an all-out effort to target Zone D, 
preparatory to mounting an intensive air campaign against the area as soon 
as possible. As soon as Zone D was targeted Generals Harkins and Anthis 
planned to do the same type targeting nation-wide. (82) On 3 October, the 
ARVN 5th Division submitted an outline plan with 129 specific air targets 
for aerial bombing of Zone D, providing the beginning of the targeting 
effort. As planning progressed, President Diem laid plans for a large-
scale five-day bombing attack against Zone D desirably to begin on 
1 November and to be followed by an ARVN special force penetration through 
the area. In Diem's opinion, the one man who had the greatest knowledge

of this area, the best record as a guerrilla fighter, and the best rapport 
with local Montagnards was a Lieutenant Colonel Dien, the Chief of Phuoc 
Long province. Diem therefore intended to place Dien in supervision of 
operations in Phuoc Long, Binh Long, and Phuoc Thanh provinces -- the new 
command to be designated the PET Special.Tactical Zone. Simultaneously 
with the PBT operation in III Corps against Zone D, Diem intended that the 
I and II Corps would cooperate in a similar bombing and follow up penetration 
into War Zone X, the headquarters of Vietcong V Interzone, which lay in the 
mountain astride the dividing line between the two ARVN corps. (83) 
The high level American and Vietnamese interest in air interdiction 
attacks was reflected by increased targeting of both pinpoint and area 
objectives for bombing attack, notably in War Zones D and X. In both regions 
the provincial chiefs, as the individuals most knowledgeable of enemy and 
friendly disposition, designated "free areas" for air attack, these areas 
comprising known centers of Vietcong activity, usually deep in the jungles 
or mountains, where population was scarce. The areas nominated by the 
province chief were forwarded upward through military channels for approval 
by the AWN Corps Commanders and the Field Command. VNAF strike crews 
were prebriefed on these free areas as alternate targets and could attack 
them without a FAC; Farm Gate aircraft, on the other hand, were not permitted 
to attack a target in the free areas unless it was marked by a VNAF L-19 FAC. 
Free areas, bounded by map coordinates, were established in each corps area, 
but most of them were located in War Zones D and X. (8)4.) The JOC and ASOCs 
also began to frag the limited type of armed reconnaissance over known areas 
of Vietcong activity that was permitted by the rules of engagement. For 
the most part this activity amounted to visual reconnaissance performed by 
strike aircraft while enroute to and from forward airfields; here again, 
Farm Gate aircraft could not attack any target of opportunitL, they 
without control by a FAC, unless they were called upon to act in self-defene. 
(85) 
In addition to the formal targeting of Zone D objectives worked out 
at the JGS-MACV J-2 level, the ARVN III Corps Cammander accepted the objective 
that no atrike aircraft would leave his area with unexpended ordnance and 
lent his active support to an Authorized Low Priority Interdiction Target 
(ALM) program. In this program, air liaison officers worked with province 
chiefs to identify pinpoint locations of Vietcong activity by map coordinates. 
The province ,chiefs forwarded ALPIT target lists to the ARVN corps commanders 
for final approval, and the ASOCs held them for use as alternate targets for 
strike aircraft. Since the Vietcong moved about from one place to another 
and as a precaution against friendly people moving into the area, the province 
chiefs were required to revalidate the ALPIT lists every seven to ten days. 
In fact, the PBT ALO monitored and supervised the ALPIT lists pertinent to 
his zone every day, because he understood that one air strike against friendly 
people could destroy the whole program. In practice, strike pilots who were 
not able to attack their primary targets reported to the III ASOC and asked

for an ALPIT secondary. The use of the ALPIT lists greatly reduced the 
previous situation where 40 to 45 percent of strike sorties had not been 
able to place ordnance on the enemy. Under the rules of engagement, Farm 
Gate aircraft could not attack an ALPIT objective unless it was marked by 
a VNAF FAC. (86) 
At the time that the expanded air and ground operations against Zone D 
were being planned, South Vietnam's usually strained relations with Prince 
Sihanouk, Cambodian Chief of State, worsened in a manner that would affect 
operations against the Vietcong. Believing himself threatened by both 
South Vietnam and Thailand, and more aggressively by the former, Sihanouk 
on 20 August appealed to President Kennedy to summon a meeting of representa-
tives of the nations that had neutralized Laos and accord Cambodia a similar 
neutrality and territorial integrity. In response, Kennedy stated that the 
United States respected Cambodia's neutrality, territorial integrity, and 
independence and suggested that other interested nations could do the same. 
?resident Diem, however, rationalized that such a guarantee would imply 
that Sout4 Vietnam had been an aggressor against Cambodia in the past and he 
would not take the action outlined by President Kennedy. To President Diem 
the weight of some captured Communist weapons, including Chinese Communists 
heavy infantry weapons such as 57-mm. recoilless rifles and associated 
ammunition captured as far south as the Delta, indicated that they came into 
South Vietnam by sea, and there was little doubt that the Vietcong redoubts 
in the Nam Bo drew support fram across the border in Cambodia. Information 
available to President Diem led him to assert that Vietcong direction in 
Zone D came from a point just across the border in Cambodia. Fran time to 
time South Vietnamese troops disguised as fishermen went across the border 
into Cambodia and captured munitions. Sihanouk was concerned about this 
activity. On 10 September, he charged that South Vietnamese amphibious 
craft with air cover violated Cambodian soil by making landings at Koh Raker, 
a village on the lower Mekong River. Sihanoux threatened that if South 
Vietnam committed two more such aggressive acts Cambodia would sever its 
diplomatic relations with South Vietnam and recognize North Vietnam. (87) 
On 21 October the South Vietnamese provided one of these incidents when a 
RVNAF naval operation against the island of Phu Quoc, lying just off the 
Cambodian coast, seized 17 tons of ingredients for making explosives, all 
packed in old Japanese cement bags overprinted with Cambodian legends. (88) 
The US State Department was very concerned about the Cambodian border 
problem and about Sihanouk's threats to invite Chinese Communist assistance. 
In meetings with Diem and Thuan, Ambassador Nolting stressed that South 
Vietnam must avoid any military actions that might lead to the introduction 
of Chinese Communist forces on the flank of Vietnam. (89) On 15 November, the 
RVNAF OIS issued a directive that no ground or air operations would be 
planned or initiated within a ten kilometer area on South Vietnam's borders 
without its prior approval; where the border was clearly distinguished by 
a river, road, or similar geographical feature, RVNAF forces could pursue an

enemy to within two and on-half kilometers of the border, but if the border 
was not clearly distinguishable the pursuit would cease at five miles 
distance from it. VNAF pilots were authorized to open fire on a hostile 
aircraft which penetrated ten kilometers into South Vietnam but they were 
cautioned that any aircraft they fired upon must fall inside Vietnamese 
territory. (90) 
President Diem accepted the border restriction since, as he told 
Ambassador Nolting, he did not want to disturb the situation "at a time 
when Washington was using a magnetic influence on Sihanouk," but the 
restriction was unpopular with South Vietnamese officials who observed 
that the Vietcong moved back and forth across the Cambodian border at 
their pleasure. The restriction would make it difficult for the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam to control the people who lived just inside its own 
borders: in the heavily populated Delta, 408,500 people lived within ten 
kilometers of the border. As will be seen, the restrictions sheltered 
Vietcong headquarters installatiom.discovered in December 1962 in northern 
Tay Ninh province and complicated RVNAF operations against these hostile 
activities. (91) In Washington early in December, however, both the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and Secretary Rusk were apprehensive about the serious con-
sequences of border incidents and wondered whether the border restrictions' 
went far enough. Rusk asked Nolting and the Joint Chiefs queried Felt 
about the location of several "free areas" near the Cambodian border. 
Rusk urged that the political significance of another border incident 
outweighed any probable military advantage of air operations in the border 
area. "Militarily," Rusk stated, "there is general agreement that success 
Ides not in drawing tight cordon sanitaire in Maginot manner along vaguely 
.Thfined frontier, but primarily in working outwards from rural areas won 
over to GVN and, secondarily, through strikes against VC strongholds. 
Usefulness of latter, when carried out near frontier, must be considered 
less important than political-diplamatic problem of GVN-RKG relations." 
The Joint Chiefs also suggested to Felt that some other name should be 
given to the "free areas." Admiral, Felt was unwilling to give the Vietcong 
more sanctuary by broadening the restricted zones any farther. He had no 
objection to changing the name of the "free areas," and as a matter of 
expediency the 2d Air Division began to refer to them as "approved inter-
diction targets." (92) 
Admiral Felt had visualized "area denial" air actions against Zone D 
including the use of such munitions as delayed-fuzing ordnance and butterfly 
bombs, but as General Anthis would observe this concept had to be laid 
aside because "it smacked of 'indiscriminate bombing.'" Even in Zone D it 
was impossible to be certain that all victims would be Vietcong. On 
11 November, Admiral Felt also proposed that C-123 aircraft be uted to 
drop large quantities (he specified 10,000-pound drops) of napalm on marked 
targets in the up-coming Zone D offensive. On 1 December, the US State

Department questioned this proposal, and on 8 December Secretary Rusk stated 
that political considerations suggested limiting the use of napalm to high 
priority targets which were clearly Vietcong installations. Rusk also 
informed Nolting that future plans for using large amounts of napalm in 
any one operation should be cleared with the State Department. In the end, 
General Harkins did not permit the use of US aircraft to deliver napalm 
in the Zone D operation because of the absence of hard evidence of Vietcong 
concentration sufficiently large to promise military benefits outweighing 
political and psywar risks involved. He did not agree, however, that any 
more restraints ought to be placed upon RVNAF military operations, and 
Ambassador Nolting supported Harkins' position that the restraints already 
imposed upon the RVNAF were making it very difficult to carry the war into 
the heart of the enemy's sanctuaries. The restrictions ruled out most 
psychological weapons, but Anthis nevertheless lent his support to an 
activity wherein F-102s made high speed flights across Zone D at night, 
breaking the sound barrier and causing sonic booms. It may not destroy 
anything," Anthis cumnended, "but I can say positively there has been 
considerable VC sleep lost in the last few weeks." (93) 
S. Air Support for ARVN Operations Proves Complex, 
At the 19 February 1962 Secretary of Defense Conference sensed agreement 
that the major airpower mission in South Vietnam would be to provide air 
support for ARVN operations. At this time the rudimentary tactical air 
control system (TACS) was in being, and on 28 February General Moorman urged 
Anthis to take the initiative in offering air support to ARVN commanders. (94) 
In the next several months the program of "selling" air support included a 
necessary strengthening of the VNAF-USAF JOC at Tan Son Nhut and the ASOCs 
at Da Nang and Pleiku. It included procurement and deployment of USAF air 
liaison officers (AL0s) and forward air controllers (FACS). It also involved 
"selling" air support to locally powerful AWN commanders who were jealous 
of their personal authority, naturally secretive about their plans, and had 
no previous experience in the employment of tactical air support. 
In addition to providing a unitary air defense capability for South 
Vietnam, the VNAF-USAF tactical air control system was designed to provide 
positive control over all offensive aircraft in South Vietnam. In the 
basic organization, the JOG was equipped with a combat plans division, with 
responsibility for handling all preplanned air support requests, and a 
combat operations division, which was expected to manage immediate air 
support requests and to monitor air activities in progress. On the basis 
of VNAF and Farm Gate strike capabilities, the JOG was charged to determine 
how requests developed by ARVN units could be accomplished and to issue 
fragmentary orders for the camnitment of aircraft. The I and II Air Support 
Operations Centers were located adjacent to the I and II Corps Tactical . 
Operations Centers, and were responsible for receiving requests for air 
support that came up through the TOCs, passing these requirements on to the

JOC, and exercising final responsibilities for the control and coordination 
of aircraft sorties which the JOG allocated to them. As an economy measure, 
the JOC served in lieu of a III ASOC. Rotational fighter detachments were 
maintained at Da Nang and Pleiku to provide quick response, but these 
planes were to be fragged by the JOC., In the basic concept it was intended 
that the VNAF-USAF Joint Operations center would be a vehicle for overall 
air planning throughout South Vietnam as had been the function of such 
operations centers in previous wars. It would thus need to have a day-to-day 
knowledge of ARVN operations, and toward this end an ARVN liaison officer 
and a US Army liaison officer were assigned to the JOC in late February 1962. 
The US Army lieutenant colonel assigned to the ground liaison officer (GLO) 
function was highly enthusiastic and undertook to prepare and maintain data 
on all planned ARVN operations so that tactical air could be injected into 
the operations very early in the planning. (95) 
Although the functions and organization of the proposed Joint Uperati,....ns 
.bnter and the Air Support Operatirns Centers were ciaal'ly described in 
joint US An/USAF manuals, the ehtironmental situation Ln South Vietnam 
early in 1962 worked against the proposed centralization of control inherent 
in the doctrinal tactical air control system. The VNAF/USAF JOC was promptly 
manned, but problems of personnel, communications, and lack of experience 
reduced its effectiveness. Failure of the ranking VNAF officers to perform 
their assigned functions forced a heavy burden on the first USAF officers who 
served relatively short temporary duty tours in the JOC. A number of these 
USAF TDY officers, moreover, lacked experience in the duties that they were 
expected to perform. (96) As has been seen, communications between the JOC 
and the ASOCs were unreliable until the Back Porch communications system was 
in use. There were frequent communications outages in the long lines, and 
as late as April the system between Tan Son Nhut and Pa uc luau

the. aircraft asoigned on rotation al duty at Da Nang and eleaku could not 
be moved from these posts wdtnout ipecial deployment approval Zrom VNA.1? 
Headquarters. This prevented the JOC from moving these aircraft rapidly 
and efficiently to areas where they might be most needed, The kRVN I and 
II Corps Look it for granted that the AD-6s at Da Nang and Pleiku "belonged" 
to the respective corps, and, in addition, in April the JOG learned that 
the 2d fighter Squadron at Nha Trahg was flying T-2d strikes in response to 
local requests without informing the JOC about the matter. On the other 
hand, the ARVN I and II Corps observed that the JOC was heavily committed 
to operations requested by Field Gammand and the ARVN III Corps and thus 
believed that they were expected to rely exclusively on the few planes 
deployed at Da Nang and Pleiku. In April General Anthis made staff visits 
to ARVN crops, division, regiment, and battalion levels and found that there 
was very little understanding of the manner in which the TACS was expected 
to provide support for ARVN operations. (97)

Despite the general agreement at the 19 February Secretary of Defense 
Conference that the JOC should exercise a centralized authority over all 
air operations in South Vietnam, it was difficult to bring helicopter 
operations under the JOC authority. General Harkins took it for granted 
that the assignment of the US Army GLO to the JOC solved the problem of 
coordinating helicopter operations. The GLO was expected to prepare and 
display data on all ARVN ground operations that were planned or in progress 
and if tactical air was not requested he was to determine the reasons why 
this had been the case. On 12 April Harkins also issued an order drafted by 
General Dunning, directing: "All helicopter support missions being flown 
where enemy ground opposition can be expected will normally be accompanied by 
suitable armed tactical aircraft. Mission planning will include air cover 
required. This support will be requested through the appropriate ASOC in 
each corps area." When General LeMay visited Saigon on 20 April, General 
Harkins assured him that the JOC was fully aware of all US Army activities 
in South Vietnam, but in a subsequent briefing at the JOC the US Army GLO 
stated that the COMUSMACV order was seldom observed. At 2d Advon General 
LeMey was briefed that only 10 percent of the heliborne operations in 
Vietnam used air support. (98) At this time a majority of ground actions 
were involving ARVN forces of company-size or smaller, and many were ex-
tremely brief fire fights involving a handful of troops. The statement 
that tactical air was used in only 10 percent Of ground operations was thus 
misleading, but it was nevertheless, true that the ARVN was not fully 
exploiting air support and that the JOC was not coordinating all air opera-
tions. In the JOC the US Army GLO found it next to impossible to secure 
data on planned ARVN operations because the ARVN commanders were very sensitive 
to efficient Vietcong espionage and personally planned and launched operations 
with minimum notification, even to their awn staffs. Some of the ARVN com-
manders were fearful that the JOC could be a ready source of information to 
the Vietcong if it learned of their plans. Since the VNAF dispatched its frag 
orders from Tan Son Nhmt to its squadrons in the clear over possibly insecure 
teletype circutits there were such dangers of security leaks. (99) 
General LeMey's criticisms produced some beneficial effects at the JOC. 
Shortly after LeMay's visit USAF officers -- including Lt. Col. Charles J. 
Bowers as deputy director -- were assigned to the JOC on permanent change of 
station orders. Under the new and more vigorous USAF deputy director, the 
JOC required the ASOC's to submit daily requirements for air support sorties 
to the AOC, which allocated sorties on the basis ofrequests and availability. 
The fact that aircraft were physically collocated with the I and II-ASO-Cs 
did not give them license to use the planes without prior approval of the 
JOC or proper accounting to it. At Harkins' direction, General Timmes in 
coordination with Anthis sent out a personal letter to all US Army advisors 
pointing out the importance of using tactical air to support ground 
operations. (100)

On the other hand, US Army oiCicars in South Vietnam Rere dissatisfied 
with the operations of the TACS. A meeting of MAAF Sen .r Advisors on 
4 May, presided over by General Harkins and Times, was eritical of the 
operations of the TACS and voiced 4 general belief that the system was too 
rigid to meet counterinsurgency requirements in Vietnam. On 7 May Anthis pro-
posed to Harkins that joint directives should be issued giving the JOG control 
of all air activities within South! Vietnam. While Harkins did not respond, 
a MACV letter of instruction on the conduct of heliborne/close air support 
operations issued on 18 July provided that helicopter support operations 
normally required and would be provided appropriate air escert but authorized 
US Army senior corps advisors to waive the requirement for escort with the 
advice and consent of a helicopter unit commander. (101) A CINCPAC instruction 
issued on 6 June 1962 provided that an Air Force component commander would 
have "coordinating authority" over all air operations in a subunifi6:1 ,oplwand

campaign which were being drawn up, but meanwhile on 18 August MACV Directive 
No. 34 provided that the Air Force Component Commander would act as coordina-
ting authority for COMUSMACV to coordinate VNAF activities and all US air 
operations of air units operating in the MACV area but not assigned or 
attached to the Air Force Component Commander. After this directive was 
published, the Assistant Deputy J3 MACV drafted an implementing directive 
that gave the Air Force Component Commander authority to issue relations

The US Army was committed to provide and maintain the communications equipment 
employed by the Tactical Air Control Party which was to serve the Air Force 
FAC in the field. In addition to these doctrinal requirements affecting US 
organization, President Diem required that no VNAF air strike could deliver 
ordnance unless the targets were marked by a technically and politically 
qualified VNAF air observer who was assigned to one of the VNAF liaison 
squadrons. The air observers were low-ranking officers, many of whom had 
been shot at for years, and they were subject to severe punishment if they

Air Force Barn Door operations plan required this same positive control by 
a VNAF FAC for the delivery of Farm Gate ordnance. Under the Barn Door 
order PACAF also sent five temporary duty USAF FACs to Vietnam, but since 
the VNAF FACs would continue to direct air strikes three of the PAGAF FACs 
were assigned as JOC duty officers and -only Captains Thomas N. Cairney and 
Douglas K. Evans were used to coordinate the FAC program. In the new TAGS, 
VNAF designated liaison pilots to perform FAC duty with specified ARVN 
regiments, but because of the shortage of these pilots the men designated 
as FACs had to continue to fly as liaison pilots from squadron airfields. 
In case of a commitment to an operation they were expected to go to their 
respective regiments, get briefed, and then return on the day of the 
operation to perform the FAC duty, each accompanied by a VNAF observer 
who alone had the specific authority to mark a target. In a recognition 
of the fact that US Army and USAF radio equipment was designed for different 
purposes and could not inter-net, the Barn Door operations plan envisioned 
the organization of ground mobile air control teams -- each to include an 
AN/VRC-30 jeep equipped with radios for ground-to-air communications with 
air control and strike aircraft. (105) 
In maneuvers in the United States the AN/VRD-30 ground mobile air control 
jeep provided an adequate interface between USAF supporting forces and the. 
supported Army units, but the vehicle was of no real value in Vietnam in a 
situation where there was a heavy use of ARVN heliborne movements and where 
surface mobility was circumscribed by cut, mined, or ambushed roads and 
next-to-impossible jungle and swamp terrain. Only the L-19 aircraft could be 
employed for FAC work. Its radios were compatible with VNAF and Farm Gate 
aircraft, although the VNAF FACs frequently could not speak English and thus 
could not communicate with the Farm Gate crews who could not speak Vietnamese. 
In order to have communications with ARVN, Civil Guard, and Self Defense Force 
units, the VNAF L-19s were provided with portable AN/PRC-l0 Army radios, 
which were lashed in their back seats. Because of electrical problems the 
L-19 could power only one radio antenna at a time, and In practice the pilot 
of the L-19 customarily handled transmissions to strike aircraft and the 
observer in the rear seat talked to ground units ahd also marked targets with 
manually-thrown smoke grenades. In addition to the language difficulty, 
there were not enough VNAF L-19s or VNAF observers to meet expanding require-
ments for controlling air strikes, and the VNAF L-19s were customarily flown 
at altitudes of about 5,000 feet, much too high for an effective marking of 
targets. (106) 
As a matter of policy General Anthis conceived rightly enough that VNAF 
ought to provide air liaison officers to ARVN divisions, since Vietnamese 
flying officers among other obvious advantages would have disciplinary 
authority over VNAF personnel who provided support to the divisions. But 
it was manifestly impossible for VNAF to divert scarce pilots to ALO duty, 
and early in 1962 it appeared possible that US Army advisors with the ARVN 
divisions could also handle air liaison functions. In February 1962 a

travelling instructional team from the USAF Air-Ground Operations School 
visited the ARVN divisions and attempted to indoctrinate ARVN commanders 
and US Army advisors with the workings of the TACS, the availability of 
VNAF and Farm Gate support, and how to obtain it. Despite this indoctrina-
tion, some of the ARVN commanders remained reluctant to request air support 
because they did not understand the capabilities of the air weapon systems. 
(107) 
At the institution of the TAOS it was obvious that the scarcity of the 
VNAF FACs would be a major limitation on effective employment of effective 
close air support, and a VNAF-USAF FAC seminar conducted on 12-13 February 
1962 visualized ways to use indigenous forces to perform the mission. At 
this seminar Captains Cairney and Evans urged that USAF FACs be brought to 
Vietnam both to train VNAF FACs and to assist in controlling Farm Gate air 
strikes. In handling Farm Gate, the USAF FAC would pilot the VNAF L-19 and 
give language asistance to the VNAF air observer, who would ,ontinue to 
bear the basic responsibility forimarking targets. Another proposal appearing 
to have merit was to train ARVN officers as Forward Air Guides (FAGs) and to 
return these men to their ground units where they would be prepared to work 
closely with airborne VNAF FACs in identifying and marking targets. This was 
a fix favored by General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., Commander, USAF Tactical 
Air Command, as a means of conserving pilots. At the end of his tour as 
Farm Gate commander in March, Lt. Col. Robert L. Gleason also recommended 
that USAF FACs be brought to Vietnam, where they would fly VNAF L-19s with 
VNAF air observers aboard. As an alternate proposition Gleason also recom-
mended that Farm Gate be provided with L-28 Helio Courier light aircraft 
to be employed for airborne forward air control under conditions such as 
adverse weather or darkness .when VNAF L-19 pilots were unable to fly. Under

units some man-pack equipment that could communicate with existing UHF,i'MF 
aircraft radios. Such equipment, however, could not be available in 
necessary quantity from US production sources before mid-1963. As an 
interim improvisation the MACV committee elected to retrofit the VNAF and - 
Farm Gate and the US Army helicopters in Vietnam with US Army AN/ARC-)4 
radio equipment which could net With the PRC-10 radios possessed by ARVN 
units. (109) 
Each of the recommendations for improving the FAC capability was accepted 
and was put into effect with varying results over a period of many months 
that followed. In the period of operational doldrums after the 27 February 
air attack on President Diem's Palace, the VNAF readily agreed to train

ARVN FAGs. It began classes of two-week duration, each for 40 ARVN guides, 
at Tan Son Nhut on 16 April. The FAG training continued for a year without 
positive results. Most of the ARVN commanders sent staff officers to take 
the training, men who enjoyed the temporary duty at Saigon but upon return 
to their units disappeared in their old staff assignments and were never 
available for duty with frontline battalions and companies. In the end the 
VNAF would remain unwilling to issue a directive that authorized an air 
strike against a target marked by a FAG, even in the absence of a VNAF air 
observer. The VNAF rationalized that the FAGs were not adequately trained 
and that only a trained VNAF air observer could be trusted not to make a 
mistake in marking a target. The FAG program continued for many months 
after it should have been abandoned and diverted attention from the efforts 
that might have been given to training additional VNAF air observers. (110) 
In September 1962 Farm Gate received the first two of four L-28s, planes 
subsequently designated U-10As, for testing to include their use as airborne 
control aircraft. In a FAC employment these planes gave good results as far 
as aircraft performance was concerned, and they proved especially worthwhile 
for carrying an airborne coordinator into a mission area where numerous 
strike aircraft would be working. The use of the U-10 did not obviate the 
requirement for a VNAF air observer, however, and the 11-10 Helio Courier was 
too expensive an aircraft for general usage as a FAC plane. (111) 
The program for retrofitting VNAF and USAF aircraft with AN/ARC-44 radio 
equipment was carried out but was less than satisfactory on two counts. The 
US Army procured the sets from a single production source in the United States, 
and the Air Force Logistics Command had great delays in getting the sets 
required to equip USAF and VNAF aircraft. Ry January 1963 all US Army heli-
copters in Vietnam were equipped with the ARC-4h, while the VNAF had 20 planes 
so equipped and the USAF units had 18 aircraft equipped. As a matter of fact 
USAF C-123s, the last aircraft to get the ARC-44 sets, would not be equipped 
until early 1965:- In operationaluse the PRC-44/PRC-10 combination permitted 
air-to-ground contact, but the quality of the frequency modulated, short-
range communications was poor. The PRC-10 ground radios had an effective 
range of only five to six miles, and jungle canopy foliage further attenuated 
their transmissions. Aircrews found it hard to raise contact with the PRC-10s, 
and the few frequency channels available for air-ground communications led to 
serious jamming over target areas. Particularly in helicopter escort missions 
the incompatibility of various radios remained a serious detriment to success-
ful operations. (112) 
Early in April the 2d Advon stated a requirement for USAF FAGs to be used 
for training and in operations in Vietnam, and later in the month General 
LeMay not only accepted the program but expanded it to include ALOs. General 
Harkins agreed with the expanded ALO/FAC program, and PACAF undertook to 
provide temporary duty officers pending the arrival of the first PCS personnel 
from the United States in early August 1962. According to manning authoriza-
tions, the 2d Advon was authorized ALOs in the ranks of lieutenant colonel for

assignment to the ARVN corps and in the ranks of major for assignment to 
ARVN divisions, airborne brigade, special forces, and to an ALO/FAC section 
in the JOC. Assignment of company ,grade tactical fighter pilots as FACs 
was based on one for each regular ARVN infantry regiment plus one each for 
the ARVN airborne brigade and for autonomous ARVN infantry regiments. (113) 
When the TDY ALOs and FACs arrived from?PACAF units in May and June they were 
sent into the field with admittedly vague instructions asking them to "sell 
air power" and to provide reports of their experience that would provide a 
,basis for the formalization of the:A.LO/FAC program. General Anthis expected 
the USAF representatives to urge ARVN commanders to request air escort for 
overland convoys, to integrate fixed-wing air cover and escort into,heliborne 
operations, to make use of ARVN forward air guides that had been trained, to 
buildup a backlog of interdiction-type targets that could be attacked by 
crews who were released from other missions with unexpended ordnance, and 
to speed the transmission of air support mission requests through ARVN communi-
cations networks. The ALOs were :also asked to discover missions for tactical 
airlift, and to encourage th,s ARTI. to make orderly requirements for aerial 
reconnaissance. (114) 
The USAF ALOs and FACs approached their duties with high enthusiasm and 
made excellent contributions. Records of MACV ground actions from I May 
through 12 August 1962 showed that, air support was used on 133 out of 336 
actions, giving a 39.5 percent ratio. (115) The statistics bore out the fact 
that the ALO-FAC program was "selling" airpower, but there were some problems 
in the undertaking. One of the problems was transitory, having to do with 
the initial 120-day temporary duty tours of the first ALOs and FACs. Under 
agreement with VNAF each ALO was allocated an L-19 for his use and the FACs 
flew with the VNAF liaison squadrons. Most of the American pilots had to be 
checked out in L-19s, requiring a non-productive period of time at the begin-
Tf temporary duty. 11 TAF liaison ci-,..adr,ins ted Jat that 
this check-out responsibility warted operational flying hours, resulted in at 
least two check-out accidents, and reduced the value of s-loro-tour personnel. 
(116) This problem passed with the arrival of PCS personnel, but there was 
continuing uncertainty as to the organizational responsibilities of the ALOs 
and FACs. At the ARVN divisions, the USAF ALOs joined the US Army MAAG and 
received housing and other support from the MAAG. Although designated for 
service with ARVN regiments, the USAF FACs lived with the VNAF liaison 
squadrons where they piloted L-195 on missions with VNAF air observers aboard 
to mark targets. In the I Corps, for example, the USAF FACs spent about 75 
percent of their time with the VNAF liaison squadron and only about 25 percent 
with the ARVN regiment, even though a regimental FAL was expected to be avail-
able to advise a regimental commander. In the MACV organization General 
Anthis insisted that the ALOs and FACs should be assigned to 2d Advon rather 
than to the Air Force Section of the MAAG, his rationale being that the men 
were an integral part of the TAGS At a meeting on 24 September, however, 
Generals Harkins, Weede, and Timmes indicated to Anthis that they considered 
the ALOs to be US air advisors and further asserted that each ALO ought to 
be the principal air advisor to the US Army corps or division advisorsin

matters of tactical air support. After much discussion it was agreed that 
the ALO would not be a subordinate to the Army advisor, but Anthis never-
theless instructed all of the ALOs to work cooperatively in a MAAG-team 
relationship with Army advisors. Shortly after this time, however, the 
rank of the US Army MAAG advisors at ARVN divisions was increased to colonel 
and the deputy US Army divisional advisors became lieutenant colonels, with 
the results that the USAF ALO major was in no position to act as an equal with 
this array of rank, the matter of rank being very important to ARVN officers. 
In an effort to fit the USAF FACs into a proper organizational framework, Lt 
Colonel Byron K. Kahn, the USAF I Corps ALO, established a procedure whereby 
all new FACs spent a month with the VNAF liaison squadron and then joined 
their respective ARVN regiments and served much the same liaison function as 
an ALO did at a division. These procedures brought some order into the ALO-
FAC program, but the individual ALOs and PACs were nevertheless quite sure 
about the matter of for whom they were supposed to work; the FACs especially 
thought that they had too many bosses. (117) 
As a matc,er of policy General Anthis and other 2d Air Division officers 
urged that the VNAF must take over the ALO-FAC function as soon as it could 
possibly secure enough qualified officers to do so, and in the meanwhile USAF 
personnel performed these functions, solving some problems and encountering 
others with which they could not effectively cope. The ALOs reported that 
it was very difficult to have any sort of a daily planning conference because 
the ARVN commanders were reluctant about revealing their intentions for an 
operation until the very last moment. Frequently the ARVN commanders would 
not reveal .the nature of a proposed forthcoming maneuver, but merely requested 
the ALO to insure that a certain number of VNAF aircraft would be held on a 
ground alert commitment in case they might be needed. The ARVN unit commanders, 
moreover, were sensitive about the loss of face that they would sustain if 
they requested air suppert that could not be provided. Frequently the ARVN 
commanders would attempt to vet an informal feel as to whether air support 
might be available to them in case they asked for it, and if they were told 
it might not be available they would seldom follow up with a formal request. 
Nhen a division ALO learned of a forthcoming operation it was frequently at 
a last moment, giving very little time to gat a FAC from a liaison squadron 
and have him briefed an the operation for which he would be expected to mark 
targets. None of the Americans were fluent in the difficult Vietnamese 
language and all of them found it difficult to understand ARVN preoperational 
briefings When they were held. In their flights with the VA P liaison 
squadrons, the USAF FACs made a contribution by demonstrating that the L-19s 
were less vulnerable to small arms fire than many VNAF pilots imagined and 
that adequate visual reconnaissance and target marking demanded flying at 
low altitudes. The USAF FACs also checked the effectiveness of VNAF observers, 
but the USAF personnel had no disciplinary authority and the VNAF tended to 
resent criticism of its personnel, even when it was deserved. (118)

In 1962 nothing could be done about getting the desirable VNAF personnel 
to man ALO and FAC positions with ARVN units, but it appeared to General 
Anthis that arrangements could be made to speed requests for air support 
through ARVN channels. In jungle warfare, when there was hardly any chance 
to use supporting artillery as an alternate form of firepower, Anthis could 
see no reason why air support requests had to be passed slavishly up the ARVN 
chain of command. At Anthis' recommendation the RVNAF JOS accepted a stream-
lined air request concept in June 1962 whereby regiments were authorized to 
send air support requests directly to the Corps TOC, with the divisions 
monitoring and having an authority to cancel the request. In the paramilitary, 
a province chief was authorized to request air directly from the ASOC with 
the division tactical zone monitoring. Although the JGS authorized the stream-
lined air request procedure, lower unit ARVN commanders remained generally 
unwilling to act independently of their higher echelons. Most of them insisted 
on sending their requests up through channels, where at each echelon of command 
the requests had to be acted upon, often by named individuals who were not 
infrequently difficult to locate at a particular moment. In the retransmissions, 
the air support requests were frequently disapproved, delayed, or lost. Anthis 
understood what was happening, but he could not change ARVN habits overnight. 
He did, however, instruct the USAF regimental FACs and the division ALOs to 
monitor mission requests and to inform the ASOCs When mission requests were 
made. This procedure allowed the ASOCs to check and identify instances of 
delayed or lost mission requests. (119) 
Although the TACS in its initial establishment had recognized weaknesses 
resulting from the inexperience of Vietnamese airmen and communications 
difficulties, it made the most efficient use of the very limited VNAF-Farm 
Gate tactical air capabilities. But where the TAGS involved a central control 
and allocation of air effort, President Diem was unwilling during 1962 to 
approve a central control over nation-wide counterinsurgency operations, 
which he preferred to take place as decentralized activities under local 
command arrangements. Thus in the MACV plans for "Operation Binh-Minh" or 
"Operation Sunrise" submitted to Diem early in March 1962 as a desired beginning 
of counterinsurgency campaigns, General Harkins recommended that ARVN operations 
against the villages and hamlets on the southern fringe of Zone D north of 
Ben Cat in Binh Duong province ought to be under a joint task force commander 
and would desirably yield a badly needed military victory to the South Vietna-
mese as well as continuing pacification of the area. Where the MACV recommenda-
tions called for a joint task force commander, Diem instead chose to use the.. 
ARVN 5th Division for the operation and gave the division commander, Colonel 
Vanh Thadh Cao? responsibility for conducting the operation. At the beginning 
of action on 16 March, Cao made planned helicopter airlift impossible by 
moving without advance notice. He made no use of committed VNAF air support, 
which sat on call at Bien Boa. As Gaols troops marched in, the Vietcong. 
easily withdrew back into Zone D, obviating any decisive accomplishment other 
than a simple occupation of territory. Relocation of the peasant population 
in the area was poorly handled. Cao's troops brutally uprooted homesteads

and held the peasants in camps for several weeks before these local people 
were compelled to build the new strategic hamlets in which they would live. 
Since the Vietcong remained as strong as ever in Zone D, AWN rangers would 
have to be kept on duty in the new strategic hamlets to protect them against-
Cammunist attack. (120) 
? The lack of success with large operations on the nature of Operation 
Sunrise together with Diem's mistrust for centralized military authority 
brought changes in the MACV concepts of counterinsurgency operations. Instead 
of large operations, the greater proportion .of operations were designed to 
maintain pressure on the Vietcong in short-duration hit and withdraw actions 
(soon referred to as "search and clear operatione) designed to exploit the 
initiative with heliborne movements, most frequently conducted during single 
daylight periods, the troops returning to fortified positions prior to 
darkness. (121) In their initial employment in Vietnam early in 1962, the 
three US Army H-21 helicopter companies -- each employed in support of one of 
the ARVN corps -- greatly improved the mobility of ABVN units and had provided 
a means of bringing force quickly to bear against the elusive Vietcong. 
Enhancing surprise, Army helicopters usually made low-level, contour-flights 
(usually maintaining about 700 feet altitudes) to objective areas. In view 
of the successful employment of the Army H-21s, Secretary McNamara approved 
the deployment of a US Marine Corps helicopter squadron with 24 UH-34D heli-
copters to Soc Trang Airfield to support ARVN operations in the Makong Delta. 
The Marine movement began on 9. April, and the squadron helicopters came 
ashore from. an aircraft carrier on 15 April. In July Secretary McNamara and 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved movement of two additional H-21 companies 
to Vietnam, one to be located at Pleiku and the other at Bien Hoa. When the 
additional Amy companies arrived in September the Marine helicopter squadron 
at Soc Trang traded stations with the Army H-21 compamr at Da Nang, since 
the more-powerful UH-34s would be more effective than the H-21s in operating 
in mountainous terrain. The Marine helicopters customarily remained at 2,000 
foot altitudes while enroute to and returning from lproing areas. At their 
objective the Marine H-34s landed quickly in high-speed downward spirals. 
When hostile ground fire was expected the US Army helicopter lifts were 
escorted by a VNAF L-19 FAC and VNAF fighters, the latter being on hand to 
provide enroute protection, to soften enemy resistance in the landing zone, 
and to work against the flanks of the landing area as the H-21s landed. 
Where fixed-wing air support was optional with Army helicopter companies, 
the Marine helicopter squadron made routine use of fixed-wing support, 
both for escort and for preparatory strikes against landing zones. Under 
the circumstances whereby the Army helicopter lifts frequently did not employ 
tactical air support, only 81 tactical fighter sorties were flown in support 
of helicopter opetations in the months of January through May 1962. (122) 
According to a sympathetic record of Vietcong experience, the Communist 
guerrillas did not understand how to oppose the new ARVN air mobile tactics 
early in 1962, but they were provided with information about the anti-helicopter 
tactics that had been useful against the French in Algeria. (123) In order

to obstruct helicopter landings on potential terrain proximate to their 
positions, the Vietcong began to plant stakes, two to three inches in 
diameter and six to 15 feet tall throughout the area, close enough together 
to engage the rotor blades of helicopters. (124) By digging a circle of 
six megaphone shaped holes in the ground, each deep enough to accommodate 
a single aural observer, the Vietcong designed and used a crude but effective 
acoustical early-warning post that was able to provide a rough vector of 
approaching aircraft. The &errillas also dug defense positions on the edges 
of logical landing zones, usually in the fringes of adjacent tree lines. 
Even more importantly, since the Vietcong continued to be lightly armed, 
Vietcong instructions for dealing with helicopter landings enjoined that the 
concealed troops must aim. volley fire up underneath the helicopters while 
they were approaching and departing landing zones. (125) 
At the Secretary of Defense Conference on 21 March, Secretary McNamara 
had asked what was being done to protect the transport helicopters and being 
dissatisfied with the answers he received directed that emphasis be given to 
providing the protection. In experiments in the United States looking toward 
the development of air cavalry the U5 Army had developed a capability for 
employing armed HU-1A turbine-powered helicopters to provide local fire 
support for airmobile operations, and the Army Chief of Staff General George H. 
Decker proposed that the Army was prepared to deploy HU-ls to Vietnam to provide 
suppressive fire. On the other hand, Admiral Felt was convinced that fixed-
wing aircraft would be superior to armed helicopters for covering landing 
operations. (126) PACAF assessments also emphasized that heliborne assaults 
ought to have mandatory fixed-wing air cover, escort, and preliminary air 
strikes against landing zones. Although the evidence was fragmentary, the 
PACAF position was in some degree supported by experience in Vietnam through 
June, by which time 84 US Arty and Marine helicopters had been damaged by 
ground fire and four US Army helicopters had been destroyed in action, two 
of the latter by friendly air to avoid their capture after they had been 
shot down. Although the Marine emphasis on fixed-wing support appeared to 
have reduced the Marine helicopter losses, the difference in tactics between 
the Army and Marine helicopter pilots also probably affected the loss rate. 
On the other hand the OSD/ARPA Field Unit in Saigon studied the increasing 
Vietcong success against helicopters and demonstrated that most of the 
damaging small arms fire was received from underneath the helicopters during 
their approach to a landing zone and during their departure from it. The 
OSEVARPA field study stated that fixed-wing aircraft could not feasibly 
maintain suppressive fire at these junctures, and recommended that armed 
helicopters be tested as a supplement to fixed-wing helicopter escort. Each 
heliborne assault force should be assigned sufficient armed helicopters to 
provide lead, front, and rearward protection, a minimum of four armed heli-
copters being therefore recommended for each helicopter force. (128) At about 
this same time a Defense Intelligence Agency staff member visiting in Vietnam 
returned to Washington with the report that VNAF softening-up strikes prepara-
tory to heliborne landings alerted the Vietcong, who rushed to prepared 
trenches and fox-holes from which they directed volley fire against the 
approaching helicopters. (129)

Because of the growing damages sustained by the heliborne forces, 139 
combat air sorties in support of helicopters were flown in July. (130) 
During the month the Farm Gate detachment, now commanded by Lt. Col. E. H. 
Mueller, Jr., also perfected tactics whereby an element of two T-28s was 
in support of Army helicopter flights. In enroute escort the T-28s waited 
at altitude while the helicopters got into formation and gained their cruise 
altitude. Then one of the T-28s descended to approximately 200 feet above 
the terrain and proceeded slightly ahead of the lead helicopter, making slaw 
S-type maneuvers and searching for indications of-enamy action. The second 
T-28 maintained a position above the helicopters in readiness to make an 
immediate firing pass against any target located by the lead T-28. At the 
landing zone the helicopters usually assumed an in-trail posture for landing, 
and the T-28s broke off formation and flew on each side of the helicopters, 
ready to strafe the flanks of the landing zone if enemy fire was received. 
Mueller reported that these tactics were considered very satisfactory by 
helicopter pilots. (131) 
Although Admiral Felt remained convinced that the transport helicopters 
ought to make maximum use of fixed-wing air support, General Harkins supported 
the US Army position that helicopter gunships were necessary. On 9 July 
Harkins concurred in the OSD/ARPA proposal for armed helicopter tests in 
Vietnam. (132) At the Secretary of Defense Conference held on 22 July, 
Harkins further justified armed helicopters on the basis that fixed-wing 
aircraft often could not support helicopters because of weather conditions, 
lack of endurance of the fighters, and inability of the fighters to fly slow 
enough to stay with the helicopters. Anthis stated privately that Harkins' 
justification was without basis of fact, but Secretary McNamara accepted 
Harkins's requirement for armed helicopters. On 27 July the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff directed the deployment of the US Army Utility Tactical Transportation 
Company (Provisional) with 15 armed HU-1A and HU-1B helicopters from Okinawa 
and Thailand to South Vietnam. US crews would be utilized to fly the HU-1 
gunships, and "suppressive fire" from helicopters would be considered fire 
in self defense. On 6 September the Joint Chiefs amended their original 
instruction to provide that the US marked and piloted helicopter gunships 
would carry a Vietnamese observer, and they stated that the flights would be 
considered defensive in nature and that suppressive fire resulting from 
escort missions would be considered defensive fire. (133) 
Admiral Felt initiated actions to move the HU-1 helicopters to South 
Vietnam, but he nevertheless cautioned General Harkins on 3 August that 
increasing Vietcong ground fire made it mandatory that a professional job 
of preplanning be done prior to each helicopter lift operation. "We may 
find," he messaged Harkins, "that armed helos can make a contribution, but 
there is no question whatsoever regarding the concept of providing air 
cover with fixed-wing aircraft." (13).j.) In conversations with Harkins and 
other members of the MACV staff relative to the employment of armed Army 
aircraft in Vietnam, General Anthis emphasized that there could not be two 
separate air wars conducted in the limited confines of South Vietnam and 
220

SECRET 
that Army air operations must be under the TACS. nthis also favored a 
mandatory requirement for fixed-wing fighter support of helicopter operations, 
and, as has been seen, attempted to get a positive MACV regulation on the 
subject. Anthis nevertheless noted a growing belief on the part of US Army 
officers that the new armed Army aviation was strictly organic to the Army 
and was to be flexibly employed to accomplish locally independent operations. 
MACV Directive 34 issued on 18 August recognized the overall coordinating 
authority of the TACS only for air traffic control purposes. (135) Despite 
Admiral Felt's strong admonition that heliborne operations ought to have 
coordinated fixed-wing support, General Harkins took the position that fixed-
wing air support could not be provided for all helicopter operations because 
of the limited capabilities of VNAF and Farm Gate and other requirements for 
tactical air operations. (136) 
Although the Vietcong were only beginning to learn about effective anti-
heliborne tactics in June, the Communist guerrillas had long been proficient 
in ambushing ARVN road and rail movements. Successful Communist ambushes 
not only damaged the government cause but provided a ready source of equipment 
and weapons to the Vietcong. In -the months of January through August 1962 
there were 462 convoy ambushes: 32 in I Corps, 74 in II Corps, and 356 in 
III Corps. The highways north of Saigon near Zone D showed up in the statis-
tical accounting as the favorite locale for Communist ambushes. (137) On the 
morning of 16 June some 400 to 500 members of two Vietcong battalions sortied 
out of Zone D and working after daylight established ambush positions along 
the highway to Bien Hoa, about five kilometers south of Ben Cat. Local 
civilians living in the new strategic hamlets provided no alarm, and at 1000 
hours the Communist guerrillas successfully ambushed a motorized ARVN convoy, 
killing two American advisors and 23 ARVN personnel. Air support was not 
requested and scrambled from Bien Hoa until 1257 hours; by this time the 
Vietcong were in full withdrawal back toward Zone D but a B-26 and two AD-6s 
under L-19 control nevertheless killed 50 of the enemy and enabled pursuing 
ARVN troops to recover nearly all of the weapons and equipment taken from the 
convoy. (138) For the moment the Ban Cat ambush confirmed Admiral Felt's 
early assessment that Zone D was a major threat to Saigon that would have to 
be eliminated by air strikes and ARVN penetrations. (139) On the other hand, 
2d Advon staff officers pointed to an obvious conclusion that an L-19 observer 
airborne over the ARVN convoy could have sighted and reported the presence of 
the Vietcong, thus preventing the convoy from running into the ambush. Another 
object lesson occurred on the morning of 14 July when a Vietcong force of 
battalion strength ambushed another ARVN convoy enroute from Saigon to Phuoc 
Long, a distance of only 33 miles. In this attack the Vietcong killed 25 
persons including a US Army advisor and wounded 29 others. No air cover for 
the convoy had been requested, and as a matter of fact nei#her the ARVN III 
Corps nor the Field Command knew that the convoy was on the road. Air support 
was requested an hour and a half after the attack began, long after the 
guerrillas had completed their work and withdrawn with their booty. (1)40)

In a briefing to MACV on the subject of Communist ambuehee General Anthis 
made the point that air power could make a major contribution to successful 
counterinsurgency operations by deterring Vietcong actions. Air cover for 
convoys and rail movements would provide employment for unused VNAF and Farm 
Gate sortie capabilities, and it was entirely possible that guerrillas would 
be deterred from an ambush by the simple presence of an unarmed L-19 over a 
convoy, since the liaison aircraft would be able to call for immediate air 
support, thus preventing the guerrillas from looting the convoy, which was 
their principal object for laying ambushes. General Anthis argued that air 
escort of selected trains and convoys should be made mandatory, and General 
Harkins took the case to Secretary Thuan and General Ty. After JGS staffing, 
General Ty issued a very strong directive on convoy escort at the end of 
July. The directive required mandatory overhead combat air cover for trains 
or convoys that carried arms, ammunition, or other important cargo. All other 
important convoys were to be escorted by an L-I9 02 Other airc.l'aft oecomnended 
by VNAF, and. tile resbonAble authority for ailes,0Ae:A conlioy that was 
ambushed with heavy damages would be relieved from commnd. (141) 
As soon as the Joint General Staff order requiring air escort for convoys 
anu trains was issued, it bore good results. On 3 August two L--.0s sighted 
200 guerrillas lying in wait for an ammunition train headed north between 
Quang Ngai and Da Nang. The Vietcong immediately fled. Later in the month 
another L-19 stopped the lead vehicle just short of the explosive charge. (142) 
Only 32 requests for convoy escort had been made from January through July, 
but 5o6 requests were submitted and honored between August and October. Most 
train and convoy escort was provided by L-19 aircraft, which were expected 
to observe the track or road in advance of the train or convoy for signs of 
ambush and to radio for ground or air reinforcements in evert of an ambush. 
Lxkeot in bile oas,, of high priority cargoes where combat air .over was 
mandatory, combat airdraft committed to train cr convoy escert were normally 
held on ground alert awaiting call from L-19s. Although the little L-19s 
,eterred attack, the work was not without complexities. On many occasions 
convoys were very late getting started; this used up L-19 flying time and 
sometimes a second L-19 had to be sent out to complete the escort run. 
Especially in 1962 incompatibilities in L-19 and vehicular radio equipment 
made air-ground radio communications difficult to impossible. The convoy 
escort task was also expensive in terms of air sortie capabilities. Counting 
both L-19 and combat air sorties, convoy escort sorties averaged 175 a month 
from August through December 1962, or approximately 10 percent of the total 
tactical air effort. The task could have been simplified: 2d Air Division 
operations analysts pointed out that ARVN road movements within the III Corps 
could be restricted to given days and hours on which all vulnerable roads 
could be covered by L-19s while a couple of armed fighters or a B-26 could 
stand airborne alert in the vicinity of the roads that were being used. 
This proposal was not followed through, and air cover for trains and convoys 
continued to be expensive but very effective: no train or convoy escorted 
by air would be ambushed for many months after July 1962. (143)

The success of aerial cover for trains and convoys in deterring Communists 
ambushes -- long a source of materiel to the Vietcong and damaging psychologi-
cal losses to the ARVN -- provided an indication that a similarly mandatory . 
order for fixed-wing air support for US Army heliborne operations might have 
prevented victories that stimulated the lagging morale of the Communist 
guerrillas. On the other hand, General Harkins pointed to the large cammitment 
of VNAF and Farm Gate to convoy escort as an added reason why it could be 
impossible to provide tactical air support for all heliborne operations. (1)44) 
At the same time that VNAF and Farm Gate capabilities were quite limited the 
emphasis on short-duration "search and clear" operations by ARVN resulted in 
a.high percentage of small operations, some 26 percent being of company size 
and 58 percent of platoon size in the last months of 1962. (145) Conducted in 
substantial numbers the short hit-and-withdraw operations were effective in 
keeping the Vietcong off balance, but they weredifficult to support with 
tactical aircraft, unless the aircraft could operate from forward airfields. 
Thus, in short heliborne operations on the Ca Mau peninsula in July and August 
1962, ARVN forces surprised the Vietcong and knocked out the U-Minh battalion 
headquarters, killing 197 and capturing 98 guerrillas in two actions. The 
first operation was covered with AD-6s from Bien Hoa, but in the second VNAF 
attempted to use the short and waterlogged airstrips at Soc Trang as an 
advanced base. The airstrip was too hazardous for effective AD-6 flights, 
and the VNAF logistical support for the forward deployment was poorly handled, 
again demonstrating that VNAF had difficulty operating away fram its regular 
bases. (146) 
Another air-ground operation -- Lam Son 2 -- conducted by the ARVN I Corps 
against the Vietcong 90th Battalion at a.point some 55 miles south of Da Nang 
and inland from Quang Ngai on 30 August illustrated the complex nature of 
joint operations and the enemy's growing ability to counter heliborne assault. 
Operational planning required some 200 ARVN Rangers and 200 Vietnamese Special 
Force troops to be airlifted both from Da Nang and for an advance operating 
location at Quang Ngai in two lifts by 10 VNAF H-34s and 12 US Argy H-21s, 
the commitment of four T-28s to fly helicopter escort, and preparatory landing 
zone strikes by four AD-6s, four T-28s, and one 3-26. US Army advisors were 
insistent that a US Army Caribou transport plane, flying from Da Nang, would 
serve as the airborne command post (ACP) for the mission, this in spite of 
objections by the I Corps ALO, Colonel Kahn, that the fuel range and orbit 
capability of the Caribou would require it to land and refuel some time during 
the operation, thus removing airborne:: command and communications capability 
from the area of the operations. Early on the morning of 30 August six C-123 
transports ferried 200 ARVN troops from Da Nang to the advance base at Quang 
Ngai, while at the same time the Caribou ACP checked the weather in the objec-
tive area and gave a go-ahead for the beginning of the first heliborne lift 
of 200 troops fram Da Nang. The tactical strike planes made their pre-
landing attacks between 0700 and 0730, but when the first helicopters appeared 
at 0730 fog had rolled into some of the landing areas and the ACP ruled

against a landing and diverted the helicopters to Quang Ngai. When the fog 
lifted, the ACP called for the mission to continue, and the four T-28s escorting 
the helicopter lift were directed to make a short pre-landing strike between 
0915 and 0925. This strike was cancelled when an H-34 reached the landing 
area prematurely. In the two hours that had elapsed since the first landing 
zone strikes, the Vietcong had rallied and directed intense fire at the heli-
copter lift. One H-21 was damaged but escaped to an emergency landing where 
after the crew was retrieved the helicopter was destroyed by a T-28 to prevent 
its capture. The second wave of helicopters landed without incident at 
approximately-1030 hours, shortly- after which the Caribou ACP had to return 
to Da Nang, where it remained for more than an hour getting refueled. Alerted 
for this eventuality-, orbiting fighter aircraft provided a relay for passing 
messages back to Da Nang, but the AHVN forces on the ground had no contact 
with their commander while the Caribou remained in Da Nang. At 1545 a first 
wave of helicopters withdrew troops without incident, but the last helicopter 
lift out was not finished until 1800, and by this time the Vietcong regrouped 
and directed fire against the helicopters. Another H-21 was hit and crashed; 
the wounded crewmen were retrieved, and this helicopter was also destroyed 
by T-28s. (147) 
Already troubled by the increasing tempo and effectiveness of Vietcong 
ground fire against helicopters, AdsrLral Felt required a full report of the 
Lan Son 2 engagement. Air evaluations sought reasons why the T-28s that 
covered the objective area had not been able to suppress the fire that shot 
down the two helicopters. For one thing, the limited communications Aboard 
the Caribou, even when it was over the objective, had to be used either to 
communicate with the fighters or the ground troops and fighter control was 
frequently interrupted. A USAF FAC flying an L-19 also had difficulty getting 
his VNAF observer to allow him to fly below 5,000 feet the pilot finally 
managed to get dawn to 2,000 feet by cranking up his altimeter to show the 
higher altitude, but in three hours over the objective area the Vietnamese 
observer attempted to mark, only one target and his smoke bomb missed this by 
3,000 feet. In his analysis, General Harkins pointed to the delays between 
the pre-landing air strikes and the initial helio landing and the other delay 
in the withdrawal, both of which had permitted the Vietcong to rally and 
shoot down the helicopters. (148) 
The search and clear operations continued in each ARVN corps area, with 
a greater concern for increasing enemy defenses which in some measure reduced 
the possibilities of surprise. At Da Nang on 22 September the ARM 2d 
Division commander laid plans for a heliborne attack -- Ngo Quyen 20 --
against two Vietcong companies reported that day to be in the Phuong IA Dong-
Thanh Truc valley region. The division commander wanted to start the operation 
on 24 September, but he did not consider that the six VNAF T-28s in the 2d 
Fighter Squadron detachment on station at Da Nang had enough fire power to 
provide adequate air support. Delayed until other aircraft could arrive, 
Ngo Auyen 20 was executed on 26 September but failed to find the Vietcong,

who had apparently slipped away southward. In his report of the operation 
the USAF ALO with the 2d Division., Major William J. Kuntz, recammended that 
a small number of AD-6s or B-26s ought to be kept at Da Nang in readiness 
to provide immediate support for the 24 Marine helicopters located there. 
In their operations from Soc Trang the.Marine helicopter crews considered 
that Farm Gate had done a good job supporting their operations, but after 
moving to Da Nang in September the Marines did not feel that the VNAF T-28s 
had enough firepower to support them adequately. (149) 
By early autumn of 1962 the 2d Advon and Farm Gate were very concerned 
about increasingly effective Communist ground fire, which not only continued 
to hazard American transport helicopters but demonstrated a new ability when 
it shot dawn a Farm Gate T-28 on 28 August and one of the Farm Gate U-10s on 
17 October. (150) On the other hand, US Army officers accompanying the Army 
Utility Tactical Transport Company when it arrived at Nha Trang were most 
optimistic about the defense abilities of the UH-1 helicopter gunships, each 
of which was equipped with two 2.75-inch rocket pods, each containing 8 tubes. 
Each UH-1 also carried two .30 caliber machineguns, one mounted on each landing 
skid. After assembling at Nha Trang during September, the UTT company was 
committed to test operations on 14 October, initially on the Ca Mau peninsula 
where the ARVN 21st Division was operating against the U Minh guerrillas. 
In this area President Diem was very anxious to clear out the guerrillas since 
they were blocking the production of charcoal required for cooking in Saigon, 
forcing the Vietnamese government to bring in coal at a considerable expense 
to the economy. (151) 
In a conversation on 19 October General Anthis expressed a hope that the 
US Army UH-ls and other Army aircraft being brought to Vietnam for test could 
be kept under the TACS, only to be informed by the Army test director, Brig. 
Gen. E. L. Rawny, that he had directions from Washington "to close his eyes 
to present doctrines and methods of operations -- look into the future --
not bound by old and outmoded concepts." Rowny told Anthis that he expected 
the armed helicopters to provide firepower previously furnished by artillery 
and to handle "close in air support targets," but that tactical fighters 
could continue to handle targets out in front of the ground troops. (152) 
In the Delta tests beginning on 12 October, however, the armed HU-ls were 
operated in coordination with fixed-wing air cover obtained through the Joint 
Operations Center. In fact during the initial phase of operations running 
from 12-21 October two VNAF L-19s'positioned at a forward strip at Ha Tien 
flew an average of two reconnaissance sorties each day over projected 
objective areas. To provide air escort for the helicopter lifts on 21-24 
October, two T-28s were deployed to an airstrip at Rach Gia, and AD-6s were 
employed to provide pre-landing strikes and overhead cover for the helicopter 
columns. In the new helicopter formation, one HU-1 was placed on either side 
of the H-21s, slightly in advance but on the same level; two additional HU-is 
were placed above and toward the center of the H-21s; a fifth HU-1, carrying 
the armed helicopter tactical director, was positioned to the rear of the

helicopter formation and above all of the other ships. One minute from 
helicopter landings, the RU-is became responsible for suppressive fire in 
the landing zone; at this time the escort fighters pulled up and orbited 
over each side of the zone, thus being in a position where they were safe 
from HU-1 fire but still available On call. (153) 
In the initial armed helicopter tests the Army project officers emphasized 
that the RU-is supplemented but did not replace fixed-wing fighter protection, 
and since the Ca Mau heliborne operations continued to have fighter escort 
it was difficult to assess the value of the armed helicopters. Air Force 
officers who flew in the armed RU-is reported that they were quite maneuverable 
and that their rocket and machinegun fire was reasonably accurate. Except for 
extreme overcrowding of the limited number of poor airstrips on the Ca Mau 
peninsula, the 21st Division operation against the U Minh guerrillas progressed 
well. Initially the guerrillas had probably been alerted by the large amount 
of L-19 reconnaissance into their area and were lying low. As the operations 
continued hostile ground fire increased. Six of the HU-1 gunships absorbed 
hits successfully, but on 5 November ground fire downed a low-flying Farm Gate 
B-26. Other Farm Gate planes met damaging fire. On a night strike with 
napalm near Soc Trang, the Farm Gate commander, Lt. Col. Myles M. Doyle, 
barely managed to limp his B-26 home after losing an engine to Vietcong 
30-caliber hits. In Doyle's estimation the Communist ground fire against low 
flying planes in the Delta was becoming very serious. He accordingly issued 
orders for his pilots to strafe while delivering ordnance at low levels, thus 
hopefully pinning dawn enemy gunners. (154) Unknown to the Americans at this 
time, the growing Communist fire in the Delta was an indication that the 
Vietcong were confident that they had discovered tactics that would be effec-
tive against heliborne operations and they were preparing for an opportunity 
to inflict a Major defeat on an incautious ARVN airmobile operation. 
6. Herbicide Operations Remain Politically TrOublesome. 
On the basis of the first trials of aerial herbicide defoliation missions 
flown by the C-123 spray-equipped Ranch Hand detachment, General O'Donnell 
informed Secretary McNamara at the 19 February 1962 Secretary of Defense 
Conference that the activity was a waste of transport airframes. O'Donnell 
recommended that the tanks and spray plumbing be removed from the five Ranch 
Hand C-123s so that they could be added to the airlift force. At this time 
Secretary McNamara wanted the spray tests to continue until technical judgments 
were available, but it was nevertheless possible to reduce the number of 
Ranch Hand aircraft. In April the USAF Tactical Air Command moved two of 
the spray C-123s to the Middle East, where they were needed to spray locust 
infestations and save food crops. At this time the Tactical Air Command 
added two standard C-123 transports to the Mille Train airlift detachment. (155) 
At Secretary McNamara's direction a scientific team headed by Brig. Gen. 
Fred J. Delmore, commander of the US Army Chemical Corps Research and Develop-
ment, visited South Vietnam in April and fairly easily determined what had

Nome-
gone wrong in the early Ranch Hand defoliation flights. The flights had 
taken place at a time that most of the plants were in a dormant stage and 
had not readily absorbed the herbicide. The herbicide defoliant had also 
been too thinly dispensed and it was necessary to adjust the spray nozzles 
of the C-123s to release a larger volume of the liquid defoliants. In 
April President Diem assured General LeMay that he was willing to allow 
the continuation of defoliation flights. He also wished to use chemicals 
against the food crops that the Vietcong had under cultivation in their 
base areas. Diem explained that the Communist guerrillas in the Central 
Highlands were seizing food from Montagnard tribal people; if same of the 
crops could be destroyed the Montagnards would relocate in strategic hamlets 
being provided for than and the Vietcong would go hungry. (156) General 
DeImore's report of the technical difficulties previously encountered by 
Ranch Hand at the Secretary of Defense Conference held in Saigon on 11 May 
cleared the way for undertaking a spray mission which could involve either 
defoliation of jungle cover or crop destruction. Ambassador Molting requested 
that the two activities should be considered as separate categories of activ-
ity, and this would be the case after this time. Secretary McNamara autho-
rized General Harkins to submit proposals for defoliation to Washington. (157) 
Although the Goverment of Vietnam and the rank and file of the ARVN 
displayed a consistent opinion during 1962 that herbicidal operations --
both defoliation and crop destruction -- could be profitably exploited in 
the campaign against the Vietcong, the United States chose to continue to 
handle the herbicidal activity on a limited, closely controlled, test basis. 
At the Secretary of Defense Conference on 11 May Admiral Felt was concerned 
with the fact that the Vietcong had killed two ARVN perimeter guards in the 
forest just north of Bien Hoa Airfield. He accordingly suggested that the 
area around Bien Hoa should be sprayed with defoliant, and on 25 June 
Washington approval was received for the defoliation of the forest area north 
of the runway at Bien Hoa to be done by VNAF H-34 helicopters. These spray 
flights were conducted on 17 and 21 July. In addition to the lien Hoa 
project, General Harkins recommended that Ranch Hand C-123s be used to 
defoliate some 9,000 acres or about 50 linear miles of mangrove forests 
along the rivers and canals of the Ca Mau peninsula, thus depriving the 
Vietcong of ambush cover along these main arteries of travel in this region. 
This was approved on 21 August, and the spray operations were begun on 
3 September by the two Ranch Hand C-123s which were now joined by another 
spray-equipped C-123 sent from the United States. The Ca Mau operations were 
completed on 11 October, and the results were favorable: 90 to 95 percent 
of the growing vegetation along the waterways was not only defoliated but 
killed; vertical visibility was increased by a factor of 5 to 7 times. 
Following this demonstration of technical feasibility and tactical utility, 
the RVNAF on 3 December recommended an extensive defoliation of 88,629 acres 
of vegetation along South Vietnam's principal highways. On this same day a 
Joint US State-Defense directive authorized General Harkins and Ambassador 
Nolting to approve defoliant operations for clearing roadsides, power lines,

railroads, and other lines of communications, as well as areas adjacent to 
depots, airfields, and other field installations. Other defoliation targets 
had to be referred to Washington for approval by the President. Despite 
the new authority for defoliation, Ambassador Molting and General Harkins 
refused to undertake the large operation desired by the RVNAF. In addition 
PACAF was skeptical about the tactical value of such an extensive defoliation 
operation in terms of its costs. The Ranch Hand C-123s were equipped with 
975-ga1lon spray tanks and would have to despense "Purple" herbicides (a mix-
ture of 2, 4-D and 2, 4, 5-T common agricultural chemicals) at a rate of a 
gallon and a half per acre to obtain desired technical results. Added to 
the expense of C-123 flying hours, the Purple herbicide cost $6.25 a gallon. 
(158) 
Although aerial spray operations promised to deny food to the Vietcong, 
crop destruction carried much more complex political implications than did 
defoliation. On 7 July Ambassador Molting and General Harkins jointly recom-
mended approval of a limited test crop destruction mission in Phu Yen province 
wherein VNAF aircraft would do the spraying and in Phuoc Long province where 
ARVN ground troops would destroy growing crops with hand sprays. In discus-
sion on 23 July Secretary McNamara doubted whether the United States should be 
associated with food destruction and wondered why Diem did not buy weed killing 
chemicals on the open market and proceed on his own. At any rate, the proposals 
demanded mature study in Washington because of their potential world-wide 
implications. (159) 
In the months that crop destruction remained under study, Vietcong propa-
ganda against defoliation gave an unexpected advantage to the Government of 
Vietnam, especially among the Montagnard tribal people. According to Nhu, 
the Montagnards had been impressed with the victory of Ho Chi Minh over the 
French and had not given South Vietnam much change of success. The Montagnards 
were animists and were impressed with the Vietcong charges that a tree that 
died anywhere in Vietnam was killed by chemicals. Nhu said that the high-
landers believed that a power to kill trees would permit a South Vietnamese 
victory, and they began to leave the highlands in numbers and present them-
selves for resettlement in strategic hamlets. The movement of the Montagnards 
deprived the Vietcong of an accustomed source of food. Reports from Vietcong 
prisoners captured in II Corps indicated that food was very short and that 
the guerrillas were having to turn from fighting to farming in order to 
sustain themselves. (160) 
On a visit to Washington late in September, Defense Minister Thuan 
pressed the United States to provide chemicals for crop destruction, and 
on 4 October the US State Department announced that crop destruction was 
approved in principle, provided precautions were taken to avoid damage to 
non-Communist crops and to provide food relief for any refugees from affected 
areas. On 20 October the State Department added the additional provision 
that any crop destruction target should be submitted for Washington clearance 
before it was sprayed. (161) By this time the rice crop in Phu Yen province

had matured and was no longer a valid target. As a test case, however, four 
VNAF H-34s sprayed 745 acres of rice, potatoes, manioc, and soya beans in 
Zone D, destroying food in an amount sufficient to feed 1,000 Vietcong for 
more than a year. On 3 December the State Department approved a hand-spraying 
operation in Thua Thien province, which, when finally conducted in February 
1963, would merely serve to demonstrate that the use of hand sprayed chemicals 
for crop destruction saved troop labor. (162) 
On the basis of the herbicidal defoliation operations and the crop 
destruction tests conducted during 1962, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff informed 
President Kennedy that defoliation should be continued as necessary in Vietnam 
because properly applied herbicides provided a degree of military and psycho-
logical advantage that might deter an enemy from military operations. They 
also noted that the use of herbicides in crop destruction denied food to 
insurgents and recommended that the Vietnam country team should be given 
authority to approve crop destruction targets as well as defoliation objectives. 
Although herbicidal defoliation and crop destruction had demonstrated military 
utility, President Kennedy recognized the adverse internation political impli-
cations of such operations and would extend no blanket authority for them. 
He did not wish Americans to appear to be making war upon the Vietnamese 
peasants. (163) 
7. Aerial Reconnaissance Fails to Meet Requirements  
In the early months of 1962 the Able Mable RF-101 photographic reconnais-
sance detachment operating fram Don Mhang Airfield in Thailand adequately 
accomplished US national requirements for strategic reconnaissance throughout 
Southeast Asia, but the aerial reconnaissance system did not meet tactical 
requirement in South Vietnam. The procedure whereby the Able Mable RF-1Ols 
staged through Tan Son Nhut to cover objectives of highest priority interest 
to MACV and the RVNAF, turned their film over to the small Pipe Stem photo 
production center (PPC) at Tan Son Nhut, and then returned toBangkdk did not 
satisfactorily meet requirements for tactical air targeting, and it was even 
less responsive to ARVN needs for aerial reconnaissance. Under the JGS 
procedure for requesting aerial photography issued on 7 May 1962, two 
categories of reconnaissance requests -- immediate and pre-planned -- were 
forwarded up from requesting ARVN units through ARVN G-2 channels into the 
TACS in the same manner that air support requests passed upward through G-3 
channels. At the Joint Operations Center the reconnaissance branch received 
the mission requests and fragged Able Mable to fly them. Resultant photogra-
phy was of necessity processed in Saigon, interpreted by either the RVNAF 
Air Photo Intelligence Center or the Pipe Stem PPC, and delivered to requesting 
units in the field by a US Army courier plane. In this process elapsed time 
between a photo request and the delivery of photography ran to many days. 
The ARVN 2d Division G-2 at Da Nang) for example, expressed himself as being 
more than unhappy that 30 to 45 days elapsed between the time that he filed 
preplanned photo requests and his receipt of interpreted photos. (164)

As early as January 1962 it was obvious to PACAF reconnaissance officers 
that aerial reconnaissance system requirements in the insurgency situation in 
Vietnam were different from those of World War II or Korea. In January PACAF 
pointed out the need for abilities to locate Vietcong night activities through 
night photography, intra-red photography, and side-looking air radar, and 
adaptations of infra-red "snooper scope" techniques for visual air observation. 
Most of these systems would require research and development. Meanwhile, the 
2d Advon required night photography to help in the location of small Vietcong 
buildups that occurred mostly at night and dispersed with daylight. Although 
the classified Hilo Hattie aircraft provided same night photo capacity, MACV 
secured Government of Vietnam and US Embassy clearance during April and 
requested that two RB-26 night photo aircraft be added to the Farm Gate 
detachment. (165) 
During April MAAG Vietnam also prepared MAP projections for the establish-
ment of a VNAF air reconnaissance program. In 1961 the US State Department 
had indicated that it might relax its opposition to VNAF receiving the four 
RT-33 photo aircraft progr.zuned in FY-1961 MAP, and the Thirteenth Air Force 
was prepared to provide jet transition to a first camplement of VNAF jet 
pilots. The MAAG study therefore recommended that VNAF be provided four 
RT-33s, three RC-47s, and approximately 14 RT-28s, the RC-47s being recommended 
as an interim fast first step to provide VNAF with an immediate photo capability 
and because it was anticipated that there could be continued objections to 
providing jet aircraft to the VNAF. In order to provide responsiveness to 
user's requests, the study proposed to locate small VNAF PPCs (each with 
approximately 6 persons and requisite equipment) at Pleiku and Da Nang but 
visualized that the Pipe Stem PPC at Tan Son Nhut would accomplish bulk print 
production and immediate photo interpretation reports. This program was 
recommended in April, and ii was examined in June by a CINCPAC intelligence 
survey team which visited South Vietnam. The survey team additionally recom-
mended that the three camera-equipped C-14.7s should be locally deployed in 
each of the ARVN corps, that two Able Mable RF-101s be wholly committed to 
missions in Vietnam, and that in addition to the two limited PPCs to be 
deployed to Pleiku and Da Nang the VNAF should also develop a PPC at Tan Son 
Nhut which would be able to meet RVNAF bulk printing and IPIR requirements. 
The CINCPAC intelligence survey team also recommended that the USAF should 
establish an austere USAF reconnaissance technical squadron in Saigon that 
would be prepared to meet detailed photo interpretation and target production 
duties for all of Southeast Asia. (166) In a visit to Saigon on 17 July, 
General Walter C. Sweeney, Jr., Commander, USAF Tactical Air Command, urged 
General Anthis to proceed with the establishment of the small VNAF PPCs at 
Pleiku and Da Nang as soon as possible because he judged that these facilities 
would be able to speed the delivery of reconnaissance products to the I and 
II Corps. (167) 
Where the MAAG and CINCPAC programs for VNAF air reconnaissance emphasized 
aerial photography, the OSD/ARPA Field Unit in Saigon on 26 June recommended 
approval of a new research and development task concerned with attaining

maximum air surveillance over a selected sector of Vietnam (Tay Nith was 
recommended) so that all major roads, railroads, villages, hamlets, and 
outposts would be observed around the clock from the air on a varied 
schedule but as frequently as possible (desirably every two hours). The 
Field Unit proposed that the Vietnamese sector commander would provide 
observers for the surveillance flights,-and that the continuing visual air 
reconnaissance would not only deter Cammunist activity but it would be able 
to maintain a constant check on guerrilla activity. Understanding that L-28 
(1f-10) aircraft were being assigned to Farm Gate, the Field Unit proposed 
that these planes should be committed to a four-month test of the maximum 
air surveillance proposal. (168) The OSD/ARPA Field Unit proposed that it 
would exercise control over the project as a research and development effort, 
but it asked that an especially competent Air Force officer be assigned to 
the test agency as project officer. General Harkins immediately non-concurred 
with the project since he stated that it was of an operational nature not 
properly within the scope of the authority of the OSIVARPA Field Unit. On 
29 June Admiral Felt also non-concurred because the project would commit 
significant numbers of aircraft and personnel to an operation in a single 
province for a four-month period. He favored a broader undertaking whereby 
air surveillance concepts would be exploited as part of a country-wide air 
reconnaissance plan. (169) Felt also objected to the maximum air surveillance 
undertaking because as he said it had taken three years of labor to get 
President Diem to centralize the RVNAF organization to a point where ARVN 
forces conducted operations under-cammand of ARVN division commanders rather 
than province chiefs. He conceived that a national counterinsurgency campaign 
must be a unified effort, not a series of uncoordinated and unrelated actions 
at province levels. (170) 
On 14 July Admiral Felt .approved the deployment of two Black Watch RB-26 
night photo aircraft from Thailand to the Farm Gate detachment, and the RB-26s 
arrived at Bien Hoa within the week. (171) At the Secretary of Defense Con-
ference held in Hawaii on 23 July, Felt spoke strongly in favor of providing 
the RT-33 photo jets to VNAF but he based his rationale on the fact that the 
United States had provided jets to Thailand, Cambodia, and even Burma but had 
not delivered the promised T-33s to South Vietnam. Secretary McNamara told 
Felt to provide additional justification, but MdNamara was at the mament 
quite negative on the subject since he did not want to violate the Geneva 
accords and questioned the superiority of a jet photo plane over conventional 
photo aircraft. In a continuing dialogue, General Harkins also supported the 
photo jets on 8 August, but as an alternative he recommended that two USAF 
RF-101s be introduced into South Vietnam and that the VNAF should be provided 
with the RC-47s and RT-28s. In amessage to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 
8 August, Admiral Felt urged strongly that fram a military point of view the 
RT-33s were superior reconnaissance vehicles and ought to be used to provide 
vitally needed intelligence. He pointed out that the US Army was introducing 
jet turbine-powered HU-1A helicopters into Vietnam in violation of the Geneva 
accords. He opposed the use of RC-47s because of their demonstrated vulner-
ability in Laos, and he pointed out that the RT-28 would be difficult and 
expensive to modify into a camera plane and could at best be equipped with 
only limited camera installations. (172)

In Washington the State Department opposed jet photo aircraft for VNAF 
on political grounds while Secretary McNamara did not judge that Admiral Felt 
had made an adequate justification of the military requirement for the action. 
Although the RT-33 photo jets remained in the VNAF MAP commitments, the VNAF 
MAP reconnaissance program was firmed up in September to include three RC-47s 
to be fitted with cameras in an emergency deviation from FY-1962 MAP funding 
and 18 RT-28s to be provided from FY-1963 MAP funds. VNAF was expected to 
deploy the three C-47s at airfields within the three ARVN corps areas, and 
it was also expected to operate small PPCs to be built at Da Nang, Pleiku, 
and Tan Son Nhut. The VNAF 716th Squadron was activated at Tan Son Nhut as 
a reconnaissance unit in September, and at this time the two VNAF C-45 photo 
aircraft (planes that had been in the Special Air Mission squadron, one 
equipped with a 6-inch vertical camera and the other with a 12-inch vertical 
camera) were assigned to the 716th Squadron. On the basis of MAP funding the 
VNAF reconnaissance program could not expect to attain full operational 
capabilities before the midsummer of 1964, and, as will be seen, the program 
was not attractive to the Vietnamese and would be overtaken by events. While 
awaiting projected reconnaissance aircraft the 716th Squadron would fly strike 
T-28s. Of the several PPCs projected for VNAF operation, only the small photo 
cell at Da Nang would begin limited operations in January 1963. (173) 
In approving the two Black Watch B-26s for Vietnam on 14 July 1962, Admiral 
Felt remarked that these planes would provide an interim night photographic 
capability until VNAF was able to assume the responsibility. Other theoretical 
interim arrangements soon followed. On 28 July Admiral Felt accepted the 
objective of establishing an austere USAF reconnaissance technical squadron 
to be assigned to 2d Advon and located at Tan Son Nhut. By September the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the proposed project, and on 20 November they 
accepted the cost submissions for the reconnaissance technical squadron. 
This 13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, with an austere strength of 
13 officers and 84 airmen, would be activated at Tan Son Nhut on 10 April 
1963. (174) Meanwhile still other arrangements were being made for USAF to 
operate reconnaissance aircraft in Vietnam. Based on the precedent of the 
operation of rotational F-102 jet interceptors in Vietnam, the US Embassy 
did not object to a deployment of RF-101s to Saigon, provided the basis were 
temporary. Generals Harkins and Anthis both wanted to move Able Mable from 
Bangkok to Tan Son Nhut, but for several months Admiral Felt opposed this 
because he hoped that high altitude reconnaissance over Laos could be con-
tinued. By October 1962, however, Able Mable was flying approximately 88 
percent of its sorties over South Vietnam, and when all aerial reconnaissance 
over Laos was suspended it was no longer reasonable to retain Able liable at 
Don Mtang. Accordingly on 14 December 1962 Able Mable moved its four 
rotational RF-101s to Tan Son Nhut. At the new operating location Able Mable 
continued to maintain a flying rate of 2.8 sorties a day, but the total photo 
objective coverage per sortie greatly increased as a result of the reduction 
of the previous deadhead time spent between Bangkok and Tan Son Nhut. (175) 
In the last half of 1962 the two RB-26 photo aircraft attached to Farm Gate 
gave good service despite operational difficulties. Flash-illuminant

cartridges required by the RB-26 night photo system were in short supply, 
somewhat limiting night photography. Another operating problem had to do 
with night photos of the flooded rice paddy terrain of the Delta: illuminant 
reflections from the water-covered areas tended to blur night photos. In - 
addition to these things, one of the R3-26 photo planes was lost in a ground 
accident at Bien Hoa on 20 October. (176) 
When Admiral Felt nonconcurred with the proposed OSD/ARPA Field Unit 
recommendation for the maximum air surveillance test project on 29 June 1962 
he expressed a concern that air projects with local applications would inter-
fere with the most effective utilization of scarce air capabilities in country-
wide applications such as air escort for trains and motor convoys. In 
Washington, however, Secretary McNamara accepted the OSD/ARPA Field Unit 
proposal and remanded it to General Harkins for implementation. The 2d Air 
Division proposal for handling the project was devised by its Director of 
Operations, Colonel Winston P. Anderson, who worked out planning for "Opera-
tion Cat and Mouse." In this pLan, Anderson outlined a requirement for 
continuous day visual coverage o be flown by Farm Gate L-28 (U-10) crews 
over the ARVN 7th Division area south of Saigon, this area being proposed 
because there was a great amount ,of Communist movement back and forth through 
the area and because intelligence of Vietcong activities was relatively good. 
Anderson proposed that the air liaison surveillance crews would locate 
targets and call for immediate air strikes to be flown against them by B-26s 
or AD-6s. Anderson's plan failed for one essential reason: the VNAF could 
not provide air observers to serve as airborne FACs aboard the L-28s, and 
VNAF would not accept an alternate solution which would have authorized 
airborne ARVN FAGs to mark targets for air strikes. (177) 
At the same time that the 2d Air Division could not produce capabilities 
to test the concept of maximum air surveillance, the US Army proposed and 
secured approval for the deployment of its 23d Special Air Warfare Detach-
ment to Vietnam for test purposes. The detachment at its arrival at Nha 
Trang on 20 September was equipped with six US Army OV-1 Mohawk turboprop 
observation aircraft, planes equipped with cameras and also .50-Caliber 
machineguns. It also possessed two portable photo laboratories which could 
process photography at divisional headquarters or other remote locations. 
The initial US Army test proposal visualized that VNAF pilots would be 
trained to fly the two-place Mohawks and that the planes were to be used in 
support of local province/sector operations as both strike and reconnaissance 
aircraft. Admiral Felt would not accept the province/sector allocation and 
instead demanded that Mohawk air operations must be coordinated through the 
Joint Operations Center as a part of a unified air effort. In accordance 
with this CINCPAC guidance the initial test directive prepared by the Joint 
Evaluation Group-Vietnam (JOEG-V) required that the US Army Mohawks be 
integrated under the TACS, but in processing the directive the MACV Chief 
of Staff deleted the provision from the plan and directed that the Mohawks 
be assigned as organic air in support of the ARVN II Corps. Under this 
arrangement teams of two Mohawk aircraft were placed in direct support of

ARVN divisions when the 23d SWAD became operational on 14 October. The team 
of two Mohawks at Qui Nhon in support of the ARVN 9th Division received its 
missions and reported to the 9th Division tactical operations center. The 
Mohawk team commander was merely responsible for providing the TACS with 
flight plans that would permit identification of the aircraft. Although 
primarily employed for visual and photo reconnaissance the Mohawks also 
carried ARVN artillery observers and were authorized to return fire in self 
defense when the ARVN observers approved strike targets. (178) The Mohawk 
control arrangement was unsatisfactory to General Anthis, who urged that the 
limited air reconnaissance capabilities available in South Vietnam did not 
permit the luxury of giving aircraft to unit commanders for their awn use. 
But when Anthis protested to Harkins, Harkins only response was: "We must 
all be objective." (179) 
When General Anthis first learned that the US Army was sending the Mohawk 
reconnaissance aircraft to South Vietnam he pointed out that the Air Force 
was in danger of losing assigned roles and missions through a failure to 
provide resources to perform them. (180) Air Force officers who flew the 
Mohawk considered it a hazardous aircraft for field operations, since it was 
not rugged enough for rough field usage and was blind to its rear, making it 
potentially vulnerable to attack from that direction by hostile aircraft or 
to ground fire when pulling up from a target. (181) The combination of the 
Mohawk and the portable field photo labs, however, was very responsive to 
local ARVN requirements. In November the USAF FAC with the 23d ARVN Division 
at Ban Mb Thuot pointed out that the II Corps Mohawk detachment made a 
9-hour delivery on photo requests, whereas the best Air Force photo delivery 
was usually seven days. (182) In the best time possible, with RF-101s flying 
from Tan Son Nhut and the Pipe Stem PPC working at maximum efficiency', a 
typical RF-101 mission in periods of good photo weather could turn out an 
exposed and interpreted photo in an elapsed time of 5 hours and 15 minutes, 
or in 3 hours and 30 minutes if an aircraft was already airborne when the 
mission request was received and no photo interpretation was required. The 
major slowness in the centralized air reconnaissance system continued to be 
delivery of photos from Tan Son Nhut to requesting units in the field by 
US Army liaison courier aircraft, but it was nevertheless true that the 
locally deployed Mohawks could make delivery of emergency photo requests 
within two to three hours. (183) There was another defect in employing 
local air reconnaissance in that the intelligence gathered by the Mohawks 
was often not made available to the overall intelligence system where it 
could be useful to increase, confirm, or deny information held by the 
intelligence community. (184) Admiral Felt pointed out that the local 
employment of the Mohawks did not represent an economical use of forces 
and that the deployment of US aircraft of any- description to Vietnam ignored 
the basic US policy that the American task was to train the RVNAF and not 
to fight the war. (185) Notwithstanding these things, COMUSKACV cited 
excellent results that had been attained by the Mohawk aircraft that were 
operating with the 9th ARVN Division. On 14 December he asked that four

additional Mohawks be assigned to the 23d SWAD in order that other tests 
could be undertaken in the other ARVN corps areas under different terrain 
conditions. General Harkins urged that the Mohawks accomplished immediately 
responsive reconnaissance of targets of interest to ARVN division commanders 
and that the Mohawk activities were complementary to rather than competitive 
with Air Force reconnaissance capabilities. (186) 
8. Air Transport Developments 
At the establishment of the South Vietnam airlift system in January 1962 
temporary duty airlift specialists from PACAF's 315th Air Division (Combat 
Cargo) joined VNAF transport officers to man the JOC Airlift Branch, which 
was expected to control the operations of the Mille Train C-123 detachment --
actually the USAF 346th Troop Carrier Squadron -- and the VNAF 1st Transport 
Group. In March 1962 arrival of rotational TEY personnel from the 776th 
Troop Carrier Squadron allowed the original Mule Train crews to begin to 
rotate, and by June Mule Train was completely manned by 776th Squadron crews 
and personnel. (187) During February 1962, Mule Train transported 1,035 
passengers and 449 tons of cargo; air dropped 174.5 tons of resupply to 
RVNAF outposts; and dropped 996 airborne personnel for training purposes. 
Considering the fact that the C.-123s were frequently employed in long hauls 
with light loads, MAN calculated that the Mule Train transports were 
operating at 91 percent of their capability. (188) 
Although the tempo of Mule Train operations during February 1962 indicated 
that the detachment needed more C-123s to meet airlift requirements, it was 
soon apparent that South Vietnam airlift system was not working in the manner 
that was planned. The JAAB never functioned according to the concept for it, 
and, since it was unable to get firm priorities for airlift, the JOC Airlift 
Branch often made sudden changes in its daily frag orders after they were 
issued to Mule Train, causing inefficiency and confusion at the operating 
and air terminal levels. (189) Within the JOC Airlift Branch, USAF personnel 
scheduled the C-123 airlift while VNAF personnel handled RVNAF requests for 
VNAF C-47 flights. When MAI reouests exceeded C-47 capabilities, C-123 
sorties were scheduled to supplement the C-47 lift, but routinely the JOC 
Airlift Branch did not get a comprehensive reporting of VNAF C-47 activities. 
It was obvious, however, that the VNAF 1st Transport Group did not have 
sufficient aircrews to attain maximum aircraft utilization, and as far as 
could be determined the VNAF devoted about 25 percent of its total effort to 
transporting Vietnamese VIPs and civilians. (190) Although the C-123s were 
deployed to Vietnam for a tactical employment, statistics of Mille Train 
operations for January-May 1962 indicated that the C-123s were being primarily 
employed to haul cargo and passengers. (191) In the absence of an effective 
airlift system, it was impossible to get a feel concerning whether airlift 
requirements were being met. (192)

The Air Force had developed and procured the 0-123 Provider as a 12-ton 
capacity assault transport with Army requirements taken into consideration, 
but in the late 1950s the Army had also procured DeHaviland CV-2B Caribou 
light air transport planes for its organic use. The Caribou had a 2-1/2-ton 
capacity and good short take-off and landing characteristics. A single 
Caribou was tested in Vietnam in the winter of 1961-1962, and in early March 
1962 Admiral Felt informally remarked to General Anthis that he was getting 
a lot of pressure placed upon him to authorize the deployment of an Army 
Caribou company to Vietnam. In a formal proposal on 19 March, General Harkins 
submitted a request to Felt for expanded airlift to include a Caribou company, 
another squadron of C-123s; and removal of the spray equipment from four of 
the five Ranch Hand C-123s so that they could be used for airlift. While 
Harkins said that he could not forecast future airlift requirements, he was 
sure that they would increase. He also rationalized that the Caribou trans-
ports would be needed to operate into airfields that would not accommodate 
C-123s and he said that there were 162 airfields in South Vietnam that could 
be used by Caribou transports while only 115 could handle 0-123 aircraft.(193) 
The deployment of additional C-123s and CV-2Bs to South Vietnam promised 
to overload limited air facilities, and Admiral Felt wanted more consideration 
to be given to increasing the utilization of the USAF C-123s and the VNAF 
C-475 before recommending additional transport planes. One question requiring 
clarification was the number of airfields in South Vietnam that could accom-
modate C-123s. General Harkins' estimate that only 115 of the 182 airfields 
in South Vietnam could serve C-123s while 162 could handle Caribous was based 
solely upon the stated length of the air strips; little informatLon was 
available an wheel load capacities, but it was presumed that the surface of 
remote strips would break down much sooner from repeated landings of heavier 
C-123s than the lighter Caribous.(194) At the end of March, the C-123s had

not refused any trip into any airfield because of operational limitations, 
but 2d Advon nevertheless commenced a survey of aerial photographs and 
launched a C-123 on exploratory sorties into little known airfields to 
examine operating conditions. A survey, of aerial photographs also revealed 
fewer airfields than previously listed since some fields had been listed 
separately by their French and Vietnamese names. (195) Based upon evidence 
accumulated in April 1962, the 2d Advon would conclude that many of the 
small airfields appearing on the maps of South Vietnam were actually un-
suited for either C-123 or Caribou operations because of low loading bearing 
capacity, overgrowth with vegetation, or lack of security from Vietcong 
attack. The directory of usable airfields in South Vietnam distributed by 
2d Advon on 6 April considered 83 airfields suitable for C-123 operations, 
but the 2d Air Division later estimated that C-123 aircraft could land at 
145 of the 153 airfields in South Vietnam under unrestricted combat and 
dry weather conditions. (196) 
In view of his desire not to overload available Vietnamese air facilities 
with excessive numbers of aircraft, Admiral Felt favored the greater load 
carrying ability of the C-123 over the Caribou, provided the C-123 could be 
shown to have approximately the same short field capability as the Caribou. 
(197) Pending accumulation of more evidence on the requirements for additional 
transport airframes of any kind, the Secretary of Defense Conference in March 
1962 determined to secure improved utilization of aircraft already in Vietnam. 
As noted earlier, one decision of this conference concerned the future of 
aerial spray operations for herbicidal purposes, and in April two of the 
Ranch Hand spray C-123s were removed and replaced with standard transport 
C-123s. In an organizational change directed by the USAF Tactical Air Command 
to improve management, Tactical Air Transport (11:ac'ron, Pro1isional-2, was 
established at Tan Son Nhut on 29 May, and Mule Train and Ranch Hand were 
consolidated in this provisional squadron under a single commander. (198) 
At the recommendation of General Anthis, Secretary McNamara and Admiral Felt 
also agreed at the March Secretary of Defense Conference that it would be 
practicable to augment the VNAF 16t Transport Group with 30 USAF C-47 pilots, 
thus permitting better use of the VNAF C-47 squadrons, whose pilot strengths 
were being drawn down by the use of transport pilots to fill T-28 cockpits. 
These USAF C-47 pilots reached Tan Son Nhut in March and April, where someone 
referred to them as a- rather untidy lot and thereby engendered their collec-
tive nickname as the "Dirty Thirty." At first the relations between the 
Americans and Vietnamese C-47 pilots were strained since the VNAF pilots 
regarded themselves as fully as capable as the Americans, even though they 
employed flight techniques that they had been taught by the French. Tension 
mounted between the two groups of pilots until an occasion in August, when 
the VNAF 1st Group commander, Lt Col Nguyen Cao Ky, assembled both the 
American and Vietnamese pilots and asked them either to roll up their sleeves 
and fight out their disputes or else end the "prima donna" business, shake 
hands, and have a drink all around. This meeting cleared the air and resulted 
in a very close and cordial relationship vetween the American and Vietnamese 
C-47 pilots as well as an increased utilization of the VNAF transport planes.

Despite Admiral Felt's unwillingness to approve the deployment of Caribou 
or additional 0-123 transports to South Vietnam at the time of the March 
Secretary of Defense Conference, General Harkins persisted in efforts to 
provide a justification for a Caribou company-. By late March, Army officers 
in MACV conceived that the Caribou company could be based at the unoccupied 
airfield at Vung Tau, thus avoiding overcrowding at Tan Son Nhut. Pram 
Vung Tau, the Caribous could be dispersed to provide intra-corps support 
for American advisors in the field as well as aerial supply to isolated US 
and ARVN troops at remote locations. On 9 April General Harkins recommended 
this concept to Admiral Felt, urging that it was to be in addition to the 
logistics airlift being performed by VNAF and USAF transport aircraft. (200) 
At about this same time, Colonel Jasper Wilson, MAAG Senior Army Advisor 
with the ARVN II Corps at Pleiku sent a letter to COMUSMACV inclosing a long 
list of complaints about delays encountered in airlift of food and personnel 
to that place. (201) Once again, Harkins' proposal of 9 April left Admiral 
Felt unconvinced. For one thing, the Army 18th Fixed Wing Aviation Company 
with 16 U-1A Otter aircraft was already located at Nha Trang with the mission 
of providing intra-corps support, and each of the Otters could transport a 
ton of minimum-size bulk cargo or seven passengers. (202) 
When they visited South Vietnam in April 1962, General LeMay and his staff 
representatives concluded that additional transport aircraft -- either C-123s 
or Caribous -- were not required for a normal airlift mission at the time, but 
they were critical of the lack of an effective airlift system and recommended 
that an officer experienced in theater airlift should be sent to Vietnam to 
set up an airlift system. In conversations with President Diem and General 
Harkins, however, General LeMay strongly recommended that something be done 
about the "Quick Reaction" plan that USAF had recommended to the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff in January and the Joint Chiefs had transmitted to CINCPAC. This 
plan included a "Fire Brigade" concept, in which C-123s and ARVN paratroopers 
would stand alert for on-call scrambles and employments in response to calls 
from Vietcong-besieged hamlets. Very shortly after the LeMay party visit, 
PACAF traced dawn the Quick Reaction plan which had been held in the CINCPAC 
staff, and Admiral Felt sent it to CCMUSMACV for review. On 1 May, Colonel 
George M. Foster, PACAF Director of Transportation, reported to General Anthis 
for duty to assist in establishing an optimum airlift system. (203) 
With the deployment of American forces into Thailand and the designation 
of General Harkins as COMUSMACTHAI as well as COMUSMACV on 15 May, arrangements 
had to be made to establish a Southeast Asia airlift system which would be 
more complex than the initial thinking about an in-country South Vietnam 
system. PACAF's 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo), with headquarters in 
Japan, handled the air movement of JTF-116 forces to Thailand with facility, 
but, after the air movements were accomplished, the 315th Air Division had no 
direct relations with COMUSMACV/THAI. (204) Still attempting to justify 
additional air transport aircraft for Vietnam, General Harkins on 22 May.

was willing to accept the fact that the C-123s could operate into most of 
the airfields of South Vietnam, but he pointed out that an "eye-ball" survey 
made by members of the MAAG-Vietnam Army Aviation Division had located 45 
other airfields that would best be served by Caribou aircraft. Harkins also. 
thought that the Quick Reaction concept of employing ARVN troops on alert, 
immediately ready to be airlifted to troubled areas, was highly desirable 
and would be implemented as additional aircraft became available. Harkins 
asked Felt to accept a concept whereby C-123 aircraft would be employed for 
main-line, long-haul airlift to 39 airheads, while Caribou aircraft would be 
employed to provide short-haul feeder air transport from the airheads to 
54 locations. The Caribou was desirable for this local air transport task 
because it could handle bulky and heavy items that could not be lifted by 
U-1A Otters or HU-1A helicopters. In regard to specific aircraft require-
ments, Harkins requested the assignment to MACV of one additional C-123 
squadron of 16 aircraft (5 for Mule Train, 5 for strip alert, 2 for training, 
and 4 on maintenance) by 1 June 1962. He also asked that one Army Caribou 
company be assigned to MACV by 15 June, and he proposed that two Caribous 
would be used in each corps in direct operational support of corps advisors, 
four would be committed to the logistical air transport system, two would be 
used for COMUSMACV staff support, and four would be on maintenance. (205) 
On 25 May Admiral Felt accepted the COMUSMACV requirement for an 
additional 0-123 squadron and requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to provide 
it as soon as practicable. At this time, Felt told Harkins that his plan for 
daily air supply to 54 locations through 39 airheads "would mean that many 
of your customers are eating too high on the hog," and accordingly he would 
not accept the concept of using Caribou aircraft for feeder services. He did, 
however, permit the deployment of the Army 1st Aviation Company (Caribou) to 
Thailand with JF-1l6 in order to wit a good test of a new type airplane 
under operating conditions in Southeast Asia, and he suggested that Harkins 
as COMUSMACV/THAI had authority to operate an element of the Caribou company 
in South Vietnam on a temporary basis, if he maintained the parent organiza-
tion with supply and maintenance facilities in Thailand. (206) On 26 May 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed that the USAF Tactical Air Command would 
undertake an immediate deployment of C-123 squadron to Vietnam under the 
nickname "Saw Buck II." Under this order, the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron 
moved with 16 C-123s from Pope Air Force Base to Clark Air Base by 7 June. 
Four of the C-123s went to Don Muang Air Base in Thailand on 11 June, and 
the last of the remaining 12 aircraft arrived at the squadron deployment base 
at Da Nang on 15 June. In South Vietnam the Saw Buck II squadron was placed 
under control of Tactical Air Transport Squadron Provisional-2, and the 
arrival of the additional planes brought the total to 33 C-123s, one of which 
was lost without crew fatalities in a major accident on 15 July. (207) After 
getting established in Thailand under JTP-116 at Korat Air Base the Army 1st 
Aviation Company deployed six Caribous to South Vietnam, where they were 
employed in pairs under corps advisors. (208) In July General Harkins was 
already discussing plans to move the entire Caribou company to Vietnam, and,

with the reduction of American activities in Thailand, he would succeed in 
reassembling the entire 1st Aviation Company at Vung Tau in mid-December 
1962, an action which was justified by the increasing need for airlift 
support and for the conduct of Army tests to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the Caribou in a counterinsurgency role (209) 
In the words of General Moorman the establishment of a Southeast Asia 
Airlift System ccmplete with a combat cargo group turned out to be "the 
damnedest exercise in overstaffing a proposal that I have ever heard of." 
(210) Since the 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) possessed a concentration 
of the airlift expertise in the Pacific, the initial PACAF proposal in May 
1962 was that the 315th Air Division should establish a subordinate combat 
cargo headquarters in South Vietnam and take control of the C-123s. At 
Thirteenth Air Force, General Milton objected to this proposal since it 
would complicate relations with MACV by creating another air headquarters 
in Vietnam separate from 2d Advon. Accordingly, General Moorman asked Milton 
to consider an alternate proposal whereby the 315th Air Division would estab-
lish and man a combat cargo group in South Vietnam that would be placed under 
the operational control of the Air Component Commander MACV. The combat 
cargo group would be the facility through which the Air Component Commander 
would exercise operational control over airlift units assigned or attached to 
2d Advon, and it would operate all USAF air terminal facilities in Southeast 
Asia. Both of the PACAF proposals envisioned the establishment of a viable 
MACV airlift allocation board that would receive airlift requests and allocate 
the airlift capability of USAF transport units that were under MA-CV/THAI 
operational control. General Milton accepted Moorman's alternate proposal 
since it promised to provide professional supervision of airlift operations 
"without creating another little empire." (211) 
During June cognizant members of the COMUSMACV were briefed on PACAF's 
concept for the Southeast Asia airlift structure and generally agreed with it. 
On 6 July, General Moorman pointed out to CINCPAC that airlift was a limited 
resource that required careful, effective, and efficient management through 
centralized control and direction. He asked CINCPAC to approve the establish-
ment of a combat cargo group in South Vietnam assigned to the 315th Air 
Division but under the operational control of the Air Component Commander 
MACV. He also asked that MACV set up an airlift allocations board. The 
establishment would require about 50 additional personnel in Thailand and 
Vietnam to man the combat cargo group, an aerial port squadron, and small 
transport movement control (TMC) sections at Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Don 
Muang. On 18 July, Admiral Felt requested Harkins to comment on the PACAF 
proposal, and, on 23 August, Harkins approved the general concept with some 
changes. A MACV study showed that the function of the proposed airlift 
allocation board could be performed within the MACV J-4 staff, and Harkins 
wanted the airlift allocation system to include all Army, Navy, and Marine 
resources except helicopters. (212)

During July the 315th Air Division had hand-picked some of its most 
professional and dedicated airlift specialists to proceed on temporary 
duty in South Vietnam, but weeks passed while these alerted men awaited 
orders. (213) Because of the delay in securing a MACV response to the 
airlift system proposal, General Moorman also discovered that the CINCPAC 
staff had forgotten all about it, requiring new PACAF briefings. On 
17 September, however, CINCPAC directed MACV to establish a joint airlift 
allocations board within its J-4 staff and PACAF to establish a combat 
cargo group responsive to the JAAB. The combat cargo group was to be 
assigned to the operational command of COMUSMACV/THAI to be exercised 
through the AFCC MACV; it would exercise operational control over USAF 
airlift units under the control of MACV/THAI and would be responsible for 
air terminal operations of the USAF aerial port squadron in South Vietnam. 
Employing TDY personnel from the 315th Air Division, PACAF designated and 
organized the 6492d Combat Cargo Group (Troop Carrier) and its subordinate 
6493d Aerial Port Squadron at Tan:Son Nhut effective on 21 September, both 
being provisional units that would be replaced by the 315th Troop Carrier 
Group, Assault, and the 8th Aerial Port Squadron effective on 8 December 
1962. These units were assigned to the 315th Air Division but further 
assigned to the operational command of COMUSMACV to be exercised through 
his AFCC. (214) 
Anticipating CINCPAC s directive of 17 September on the Southeast Asia 
airlift system, COMUSMACV directed on 9 September that all C-123 missions 
in Southeast Asia would be approved by the JAAB located in the MACV J-4 
staff. (215) On 11 October MACV Directive No. 42, "U.S. Military Airlift 
System Within Southeast Asia," generally but not completely followed the 
guidance of the CTNCPAC directive ox 17 September. The cover letter signed 
by the MACV Chief of Staff omitted the Air Component Commazder's responsi-
bilities in the airlift system, and the body of the directive did not make 
it clear that the air terminals would operate under the operational control 
of the combat cargo group. At the working level, airlift specialists on 
TDY from the 315th Air Division organized the combat cargo group, and worked 
with the MACV J-4 staff to organize the JAAB. The board began to accept 
requirements and determine priorities and then to pass them to the combat 
cargo group for mission accomplishment even though, because of Anthisf 
objections, MACV Directive No. 34 was not officially released. On 1 November, 
Anthis discussed his views on the directive with General Harkins, and on 
8 November the directive was issued with an appropriate change, stating: 
"AFCC will act as coordinating authority in coordinating operations of all 
air resources." (216) As it was established, the Southeast Asia airlift 
system was broad enough to encompass contributions of Army Caribous, Marine 
R4Ds, and VNAF C-47s, and General Harkins had led Admiral Felt to believe 
that one of the principal reasons Tor deploying the Caribou to South Vietnam 
would be to supplement C-123 air logistical transport operations. As he had 
agreed to do, General Harkins directed that four Caribou aircraft be allocated

to the airlift system as they became available, and four of the planes were 
declared available for airlift missions during the period of 1-8 December. 
After this, and despite Anthis' verbal protests to Harkins, no Caribou 
would be available to the airlift system pending several months of 
negotiations. (217) 
Although the professional airlift specialists in the combat cargo group 
were naturally interested in establishing a clean, straight line airlift 
organization, General Anthis insisted that the C-123s be responsive for 
tactical airlift missions within the TACS through the JOC or the ASOCs. 
In June 1962 the new TDY ALOs were urged to "discover" tactical airlift 
missions for the C-123s, and the arrival of the Saw Buck II C-123s permit-
ted implementation of the fire brigade, quick reaction plans. Basically, 
the fire brigade was a composite fast-reaction force composed of 5 c-123, 
5 C-47, and 1 L-19 aircraft with 500 ARVN airborne brigade troops on a 
30-minute alert for emergency employment, 24-hours a day. The 0-123 alert 
status was increased to 6 aircraft (5 at Tan Son Nhut and 1 at Da Nang), 
and 500 ARVN paratroopers were successfully dropped in a capability demon-
stration on 5 June 1962. A coordinated MS/2d Advon joint operations plan 
for the fire brigade concept was formally published on 17 October 1962, 
but the concept, which visualized the co-location of paratroop battalions 
and transport aircraft at eight dispersed locations throughout South Vietnam, 
was never completely implemented. In a reduced fire brigade plan, 5 C-123s 
and 5 VNAF C-47s and 350 ARVN paratroopers were committed to one-hour alert 
at Tan Son Nhut and one 0-123 and one C-47 were held on similar alert at 
Da Nang. Tests showed that the force could react in 30 minutes, but several 
months would pass before it would be used in an active operation, indicating 
that while the fire brigade might have intrinsic merit it was not proving 
out because it was not being requested. Under such circumstances, the com-
mitment of C-47s and C-123s to alert appeared a waste of airlift. (218) 
The record of Mule Train/Saw Buck airlift accomplishments between June-
December revealed that the C-123s continued to be used more as logistical 
carriers than in the primary tactical role for which they had been designed. 
It was obvious that Army helicopters and light transports were performing 
tactical transport missions. At the same time, MACV had to provide a very 
large airlift for logistic support throughout Vietnam because of a lack of 
secure surface transportation. (219)

9. Expanding Requirements Strain VRAF and Farm Gate 
When President Kennedy made the decision to provide expanded US advisory 
assistance to the RVNAF in November 1961 he bore a conviction that the war in 
Vietnam could be won only as long as it was South Vietnam's war. Although 
this Presidential conviction was not exactly spelled out in formal policy 
statements, President Kennedy continued to emphasize in public statements 
that American advisors were expected to assist in training and transportation. 
He maintained that the United States had not sent combat troops to South 
Vietnam in the usual sense of the word, although, he explained, "the training 
missions that we have there have been instructed if they are fired upon they 
would, of course, fire back, to protect themselves."(220) In other state-
ments of US policy President Kennedy manifested a clear determination to resist 
the attempted Communist subjugation of South Vietnam.(221) With the progress 
of events it became apparent to General Sweeney at the USAF Tactical Air 
Command that US national policy an-counterinsurgency was to assist indigenous 
military personnel to assist themselves and that the primary effort must be 
indigenous.(222) On the other hand, President Kennedy was also deeply 
interested in increasing the counterinsurgency capabilities of the US Armed 
Services, and toward this end at the 15 January 1962 Secretary of Defense 
Conference Secretary McNamara announced that he hoped to make South Vietnam 
"a proving ground, training ground, or laboratory for tactics-techniques 
and weapons."(223) During a visit to Southeast Asia shortly after he became 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell D. Taylor emphasized 
in September 1962 that all of the US Armed Services should use South Vietnam 
as a laboratory to bring in new hardware and to develop new tactics and 
equipment for counterinsurgency operations.(224) The lack of clear hierar-
chical values assigned to the three US national policies relevant to the 
Republic of Vietnam -- resisting Communist subjugation, developing indigenous

forces to fight their awn war, and training in and development of US Armed 
Services counterinsurgency capabilities -- greatly complicated the task of 
fielding air force units necessary to meet expanding operational require-
ments. 
At their arrival at Bien Hoa in November 1961 the highly-motivated men 
of the Farm Gate detachment fully expected to employ their 4 SC-47s, 4 RB-26s, 
and 8 T-28s in clandestine combat operations against the Vietcong. On 16 Novem-
ber, however, Admiral Felt stated that the primary mission of the Farm Gate 
detachment was to conduct tactical training and tactical pilot up grading for 
the VNAF. (225) On 6 December the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized the use 
of the Farm Gate aircraft on combat missions with a combined US and &VII crew 
aboard as a part of combat crew training requirements in South Vietnam. (226) 
This instruction was confirmed at the 16 December Secretary of Defense Con-
ference when Secretary McNamara authorized Farm Gate missions in active 
combat roles within the borders of South Vietnam provided at least one South 
Vietnamese national was aboard each aircraft so committed. McNamara verbally 
commented that Farm Gate operations ought to be closely monitored and used 
for "important jobs." (227) On 26 December, however, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff stated in additional clarification and amplification of the Farm Gate 
mission that the US aircraft were to be employed on combat missions only when
the VNAF did not have the capability (because of lack of training, equipment, 
etc.) to perform the required missions. Any such missions would be with a 
combined US and GVN crew, and such missions would be for the purpose of 
providing necessary training for GVN personnel so that the VNAF could perform 
the required missions at the earliest possible time. (228) 
In computing available cqmbat sorties early in 1962 General Anthis 
figured that Farm Gate's four B-26s and eight T-28s were each capable of 
operating at a rate of one operational sortie each day, but the rule of 
engagement limited Farm Gate plans to missions that could not be performed 
by the Vietnamese and focused attention on the capabilities of the VNAF as 
they existed and were programmed. In the MAP projection the VNAF 1st Fighter 
Squadron at Bien Hoa was authorized 20 AD-6 unit strength aircraft, which 
Anthis figured should be flown at a rate of one operational sortie for each 
aircraft each day. The VNAF 2d Fighter Squadron being readied for combat 
at Nha Trang was scheduled to receive a total of 30 unit equipment T-28Cs 
with 14 T-28Bs to be committed to transition training. The VNAF 1st, 2d, 
and 3d Liaison Squadrons possessed their authorized strength of 15 L-19s 
in each squadron. The VNAF expansion was being managed by upgrading L-19 
pilots from the liaison squadrons and from the VNAF flight training center 
into T-28s, but the shortage of trained Vietnamese pilots still fundamentally 
affected plans for VNAF augmentation. At the beginning of 1962 VNAF possessed 
only 225 pilots, and in order to provide 271 pilots needed to man cockpits 
and fill other high prioritypositionAadditional flight training would have 
to be conducted in the United States. The VNAF AD-6 pilots were proficient

in daytime flight, but the AD-6s were former carrier aircraft and had no 
landing lights. As a result the AD-6 pilots had never flown at night to 
any extent. Flight instruments had became inoperative and very few 
Vietnamese aviators were qualified for night or all-weather operations. 
(229) 
Inability of VNAF pilots to operate at night or in adverse weather 
provided an operational mandate for Farm Gate, while VNAF pilots who required 
combat training provided crew members for the B-26s and T-28s. Although both 
Farm Gate and 1st Fighter Squadron were located near each other at Bien Hoa, 
relations between these two squadrons remained almost indidental. As has 
been seen, the AD-6 pilots did not like to fly in the rear seats of Farm Gate 
T-28s; moreover, the two squadrons were separately fragged for operations by 
the Joint Operations Center, a practice which worked against a common partici-
pation in missions. Unlike the 10-6 pilots, the VNAF T-28 pilots from Nha 
Trang required gunnery, bombing, and rocketry training provided by Farm Gate 
and also provided the Vietnamese -_,.rewmen that Farm Gate required for opera-
tional missions. (230) In addition to the training mission Farm Gate developed 
tactics for night hamlet defense and demonstrated that aircraft detachments 
could operate from remote locations for extended periods of time. Before the 
arrival of Farm Gate the Vietnamese airmen had convinced President Diem that 
aviators had to work from the established airfield at Bien Hoa where they 
could secure logistical support. But when Farm Gate sent a detachment to 
Pleiku, Diem saw that this was feasible, and the 1st Fighter Squadron began 
to stage rotational detachments of two AD-6s to Pleiku and to Da Nang. (231) 
The statement by Secretary MeNtmara on 19 February that US advisors must 
not be employed in jobs that could be done by the Vietnamese impacted upon 
the Farm Gate mission, but the attack by the two VNAF AD-6 pilots against 
President Diem's Palace on 27 February provided a new operational mandate for 
Farm Gate. Greatly shaken by the bombing of his residence, President Diem 
grounded the 1st Fighter Squadron pending security investigations. The 
squadron was released for flying late on 1 March, with the proviso that the 
AD-6s could carry only 20-mm. ammunition. On 14 March the 10-6s were allegedly 
authorized to employ a full spectrum of ordnance, but the Joint General Staff 
would continue to restrict the employment of bombs in the II and III Corps 
areas. In the emergency, when VNAF was restricted in operations, Ambassador 
Nolting secured authorization from Washington for the use of Farm Gate planes 
to support planned and approved operations, with the understanding that AD-6s 
would fly missions with the Farm Gate aircraft, thereby avoiding a public 
impression that the United States was taking over combat operations. (232) 
On 10 March the Thirteenth Air Force requested that immediate action be taken 
to augment Farm Gate with the four additional B-26s that were already in the 
Far East and that four additional T4.28s be assigned to the American detachment, 
the rationale being that the B-26s had proven themselves to be the best 
tactical aircraft for the counterinsurgency mission, the T-28s were required

to permit Farm Gate to maintain detachments of these planes at airfields 
readily adjacent to the ASOC's, and finally that ARVN was being educated 
to the use of air power and would require additional support. General 
Harkins and Ambassador Nolting initially supported the movement of the 
four additional B-26s to South Vietnam, but at the Secretary of Defense 
Conference on 21 March Secretary McNamara took note of the fact that the 
VNAF 2d Fighter Squadron was becoming operational and asked haw much longer 
US pilots would have to fly with VNAF. In response to the question General 
Anthis stated that Farm Gate would have to continue to fly withthe VNAF 
for some time as a demonstration force and in order to check on the state of 
training and standardization in the Vietnamese air force. McNamara accepted 
this response, but in Saigon the proposal to expand Farm Gate with the four 
additional B-26s stalled on General Wbede's desk. (233) 
When General LeMay visited South Vietnam beginning on 21 April the initial 
buildup of VNAF strike aircraft was nearing completion. In the 2d Fighter 
Squadron, 25 T-28 pilots were programmed as combat ready, and the assignment 
of 30 US C-47 pilots to the VNAF 1st Transport Group not only beefed up the 
VNAF transport squadrons but also released enough experienced Vietnamese 
transport pilots to complete-the pilot manning of the 2d Fighter Squadron. 
In context with a programmed utilization rate of 30 hours per month for 
T-28s and 25 hours per month for AD-6s, PACAF projections considered that 
VNAF should be able to fly 140 T-28 and 55 AD-6 sorties each week. Since 
the combat training of VNAF T-28 pilots was nearing an end, Farm Gate was 
having more and more difficulty getting a Vietnamese crewman for its flights. 
Although General LeMay noted that the VNAF had improved considerably, he did 
not consider that it would have an ability to meet all of the operational 
requirements in South Vietnam for some time to come. In addition, LeMay was 
concerned that Farm Gate was not flying anywhere near its potential. He 
emphasized to General Harkins that Farm Gate crews must fly more missions in 
order that American airmen being rotated through South Vietnam would get 
valuable counterinsurgency experience that might well be needed in some other 
part of the world. LeMay thought it important to get some relaxation of the 
restrictions which required a VNAF crewman to fly aboard Farm Gate planes 
and limited Farm Gate to offensive missions which the VNAF was unable to 
perform. (234) Back in Washington, General LeMay found little support for 
his proposals to reduce the operating restrictions on Farm Gate. Instead of 
expanding US participation in Vietnam, Secretary McNamara wanted to reduce 
it by maximum programming of Vietnamese military capabilities. In context 
with the counterinsurgency doctrine that indigenous forces should fight 
their own war, General Sweeney urged Anthis to make plans whereby VNAF would 
take over the Farm Gate planes at some target date that should be established 
as soon as possible. (235) BY local arrangements with VNAF, General Anthis 
nevertheless managed to secure an arrangement whereby 11 Vietnamese cadets 
were assigned to Farm Gate until they could be sent to the United States for 
flight training, and these cadets were used to provide the Vietnamese member 
of Farm Gate flight crews. (236)

When it became fully operational in May and June 1962 the VNAF 2d Fighter 
Squadron, based at Nha Trang with a rotational detachment of six T-28s at 
Da Nang, provided a much needed combat air capability in the central and 
northern areas of South Vietnam. This allowed the VNAF 1st Fighter Squadron 
and the Farm Gate detachment, to concentrate operations in the southern portion 
of the country. (237) As a result of the added strike squadron and some 
improvement in VNAF AD-6 pilot proficiency, VNAF offensive sorties inclined

Since the January-June operational statistics revealed that the combined 
VNAF-USAF strike capability had remained substantially higher than monthly 
sorties flown, the statistics could be interpreted to mean that the VNAF 
augmentation had been generally successful. In a forecast of VNAF require-
ments projected for six months from mid-1962 a PACAF reference paper called 
attention to the fact that available air assets were not being exploited 
fully, called for continued training of VNAF personnel, and recommended 
eventual replacement of the VNAF T-28s, which did not have enough firepower 
or external ordnance stores capability to support counterinsurgency operations 
to an optimum degree. (238) 
In the air estimates during June 1962 it appeared that the expanded VNAF 
together with Farm Gate could accomplish substantially morecombat missions 
than were being requested, including fixed-wing air cover for convoys and 
trains, mandatory fixed-wing air escort for helicopter assault operations, 
and additional interdiction and close air support strikes. Secretary McNamara 
was also pleased on 23 July with the progress of short-term actions in South 
Vietnam, but he directed that General Harkins would prepare a plan for a 
long-range three-year RVNAF program to include phasing out of major US combat, 
advisory, and logistics support activities. (239) M9Namara's directive marked 
the beginning of long-term planning for VNAF expansion, and in the short term 
it made it more difficult to provide USAF reinforcements for Farm Gate. On 
the other hand, as has been seen, movement of two additional US Army helicopter 
companies to Vietnam in September would require additional fixed-wing escort 
and support sorties. 
Even though VNAF had progressed markedly in a few months, VNAF failed to 
generate combat sorties expected from it in July, when new operational missions 
began to be requested in increasing numbers. With 27 T-28s and 22 AD-6s as 
unit equipment General Anthis considered that VNAFs two fighter squadrons 
should be able to generate 1470 operational sorties a. month, 70 percent to be 
allocated to the TACS and 30 percent to be used for training and maintenance. 
Instead VNAF made an average of only 7 AD-68 out of 22 and 11 T-28s out of 
27 available to the TACS each day. In addition VNAF usually allocated to the 
TACS only 11 L-19s out of approximately 44 and 8 C-47s out of 34. Even though 
there was a recognized shortage of pilots, the available pilots continued to 
lack night and all-weather proficiency. Pilots were reluctant to fly during 
siesta times or over weekends. The turn-around time between missions averaged 
two hours and sometimes took three, whereas a reasonable turn-around time 
should have been an hour or less. The best scramble time available from a 
VNAF C-47 flare ship had been 40 minutes, and it often required over an hour 
to get one of the flare alert planes airborne. Although the Americans had 
understood that VNAF had been cleared to operate with a full spectrum of 
ordnance, VNAF strikes after February had continued to be armed with only 
napalm, rockets, small fragmentation bombs, and cannon fire, except for two 
operations in the I Corps area. In addition to these operational problems, 
VNAF was very reluctant to move aircraft to advanced deployment locations.

This reluctance appeared to be a product of a lack of VNAF housing and 
messing facilities for crews deployed to Da Nang and Pleiku and the fact 
that the VNAF units received only a 1000 piasters a month for temporary 
duty per diem. Where the 2d Fighter Squadron had been expected to maintain 
detachments at both Da Nang and Pleiku,.it had demurred at accepting the 
later assignment, which had been assumed by the 1st Fighter Squadron and 
Farm Gate. (240) As a result of VNAF h failure to produce anticipated combat 
sorties and increasing demands for air missions, Farm Gate operations reached 
new high levels beginning in July. By the end of this month it was becoming 
obvious that the soaring mission requirements could not be met unless VNAF 
increased its effectiveness and that Farm Gate could not continue a high 
rate of operations unless it got additional aircraft and crews. (241) 
Although Colonel Nguyen Xuan Vinh was considered to have done a generally 
creditable job as VNAF commander, he was a product of early French flying 
training and had always been more of a scholar than an operational flying 
officer. In order to prepare himself for a higher position in the Vietnamese 
government, Vinh wanted to attend an aeronautical engineering graduate course 
in the United States and with President Diem's indorsement he requested and 
received MAP orders on 8 August to proceed to the United States. At mid-month 
Lt. Col. Huynh Huu Hien, a man considered to be a highly qualified operational 
officer, replaced Vinh as VNAF commander and was promptly promoted to the 
rank of colonel. (242) In a meeting with Defense Minister Thuan on 10 August, 
General Anthis pointed out the progress that VNAF had made, but he detailed 
all of the problems that existed within the organization, most notably the 
requirement that VNAF must begin to generate more operational sorties for 
employment against the Vietcong. (243) Upon taking command Hien was given 
personal authority to employ 100-pound bombs against the Vietcong, but 
heavier ordnance still required JGS approval. (211)1) MCre ilitereoted in 
operational matters than his predecessor had been, Hien actively cleared 
lists of pre-planned interdictiou targets through the jGS -In order to provide 
last resort targets for VNAF planes released from escort missions with unex-
pended ordnance. (245) Allegedly to confuse the Vietcong, Hien secured JGS 
approval for a redesignation of VNAF squadrons effective on 19 September, 
namely the 514th Squadron (1st Fighter), 516th Squadron (2d Fighter), 110th 
Squadron (1st Liaison), 112th Squtdron (2d Liaison), 114th Squadron (3d 
Liaison), 211th Squadron (1st Helicopter), 213th Squadron (2d Helicopter) 
43d Group (1st Transport), 413th Squadron (1st Transport), 415th Squadron 
(2d Transport), 312th Squadron (Special Air Mission), 716th Squadron 
(Tactical Reconnaissance), 12th Air Base Squadron (Nha Trang Air Base), 
23d Air Base Squadron (Bien Hoa Air Base), 30th Air Base Squadron (Tan Son 
Nhut Air Base), and 41st Air Base Squadron (Da Nang Air Base). (2).6) The 
new designations also emphasized the organizational unity of the VNAF and 
may have been partly inspired by a proposal made by the US Army Chief of 
Staff on 16 August to transfer the VNAF helicopter and liaison squadrons 
to the ARVN. (247)

Under Colonel Hien's more vigorous leadership the VNAF greatly increased 
its operational sorties beginning in August, but in this month it became 
evident to General Anthis that VNAF was too limited in pilots and trained 
flight leaders to meet his standard of an operational mission each day from 
each assigned AD-6 and T-28. The two VNAF fighter squadrons possessed only 
seven or eight qualified flight leaders, and the plan undertaken in the 
winter of 1961-1962 whereby Vietnamese pilot training had to be conducted 
in the United States was working poorly from unforeseen causes. In emergency 
actions early in 1962 the projected MAP training program for Vietnamese pilots 
was increased from 65 to 115 pilot spaces during fiscal year 1962 and from 
35 to 150 pilot spaces during fiscal year 1963. After the February bombing 
incident, however, President Diem demanded extensive security investigations 
on all applicants for overseas training, and these extensive personal investiga-
tions delayed the flaw of trainees and caused some quota spaces to go unfilled. 
In October only 133 Vietnamese were in flight training in the United States 
and it would be September 1963 before all of these men could complete their 
training and return to Vietnam. Moreover, language and other problems of the 
strange training environment was making for a very high wash-out rate among 
Vietnamese flight trainees in the United States. Although the shortage of 
trained pilots was the principal factor affecting VNAF's rate of operations, 
other problems defied immediate solutions. VNAF ground crews continued to 
require two to three hours to refuel and rearm strike aircraft where the Farm 
Gate crews could turn a strike aircraft around in an hour or less. Because of 
poor living conditions and shortages of per diem funds the VNAF squadrons 
resisted forward deployments, preferring instead to fly longer and less 
responsive missions from their home bases, a procedure which also increased 
non-productive flying hours. As a result of all these conditions, General 
Anthis figured in September that the best that VNAF would be able to do in 
the way of generating strike sorties for some time to come would be to fly 
about 1,000 sorties a month, of which approximately 675 sorties could be 
used for combat operations and the remainder for continuation flying 
training. (248) 
Early in August at the same time that General Anthis was applying spurs 
to the VNAF, he also asked PACAF to consider augmenting Farm Gate to meet 
immediate pressing requirements. He predicted that the mission demands 
during August would compel the existing Farm Gate planes to overfly their 
monthly programmed flying hours and pointed out that the arrival of the 
additional US Army helicopter companies at Pleiku and Bien Hoa during 
September would generate still more mission requests for fixed-wing aircraft 
support. Anthis specifically suggested that additional USAF forces be 
allocated that would enable him to keep a deployed air strike team on perma-
nent station at Pleiku and another at Soc Trang in the Delta. As one response 
to Anthis pressing requirement the Thirteenth Air Force Obtained authority 
and deployed the four additional B-26s that were in the Far East to Farm 
Gate in mid-August. (245) Even though VNAF increased its sorties during 
August, Anthis was forced to fly Farm Gate planes and crews flat out during 
250

the month in order to meet mission requirements. The B-26s and T-28s were 
programmed with support for 400 flying hours a month but were flown at a 
rate of 500 hours during August. Manned on a basis of one crew per aircraft, 
B-26 crews averaged 56.5 hours and T-28 crews 63.7 hours of combat flying. 
Early in September General Anthis reluctantly recognized that he must cut 
back the rate of Farm Gate flying, even though the combined VNAF-Farm Gate 
capabilities would be insufficient to meet requirements, forcing the Joint 
Operations Center to turn down mission requests made to it. (250) 
Unable to meet operational requirements and facing the additional prospect 
that the arrival of the two additional US Army helicopter companies and 
improving dry season weather would generate still additional requirements, 
General Anthis on 14 September fontally submitted a requirement to MACV that 
Farm Gate be augmented with 10 B-26s, 5 T-28s, and 2 C-47s. He proposed to 
maintain a deployed air strike tean of 6 B.-26s and 1 C-47 at Pleiku and 
another deployed air strike team of T-28s and 1 C-47 at Soc Trang. The 
main body of B-26s would be held at Bien Hoa, from which their speed and 
range would permit them to operate where they were most needed. General 
Harkins did not respond to Anthis' 'request, but held it without action. 
On 14 September, however, Anthis had sent a copy of his message to PACAF, 
and, when nothing was heard from General Harkins, PAOAF submitted the 
proposal to USAF on 29 September with a recommendation that it be examined 
and made an item on the agenda of the Secretary of Defense Conference to be 
held early in October. In the USAF examination of Anthis' proposal, General 
Sweeney at the Tactical Air Command and Brig. Gen. Gilbert L. Pritchard, 
commander of the Special Air Warfare Center, agreed that USAF could provide 
the planes and crews but cautioned that Anthis ought to go slow in adding 
to Farm Gate until he was completely convinced that VNAF was doing as much 
as it could. Sweeney urged that Farm Gate "should not be permitted to 
become a crutch to compromise progressive and objective development of 
indigenous capabilities." On 6 Octobei, USAF advised PACAF that the specified 
aircraft could be provided, and on the following day PACAF recommended to 
CINCPAC that Farm Gate be augmented as Anthis recommended. On 8 October 
in Hawaii Secretary McNamara was briefed on the requirement for additional 
air support in Vietnam. He was most interested in taking steps to develop 
a wholly adequate Vietnamese air force. Instead of the 130-odd Vietnamese 
officers in flight training in thel United States, he said that there ought 
to be 300 or more. Since no Vietnamese pilots were being trained to fly 
B-26s, he instructed Admiral Felt to examine the prospects for securing 
30 Chinese Nationalist pilots for assignment to the VNAF C-47 group, thereby 
releasing 30 VNAF transport pilots to begin B-26 transition training. 
Specifically in regard to the Farm Gate expansion, McNamara stated that if 
General Harkins was convinced that he needed a bigger Farm Gate program he 
should present his case in detail to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. McNamara 
added that he would be "cool" to such a proposal, recalling that it was 
contrary to the policy position taken by the President to build indigenous 
forces. He wanted Farm Gate to train rather than operate. (251)

At the same time that his proposal for Farm Gate expansion was being 
considered at higher levels, General Anthis was having operational problems. 
He considered that the August mission requirements were a fair statement 
of what was needed. In this month Farm Gate operations were up 65 percent 
over July totals, but in September they had to be reduced to 37 percent of 
the July totals, chiefly because the 1/1 crew/aircraft manning could not 
sustain the high rate of operations at the August level. One possibility 
would be to increase Farm Gate crew manning to a 1.5/1 ratio and augment 
maintenance and support by one-third thereby increasing utilization of 
assigned airframes. During September Anthis also had a difficult time 
getting Vietnamese crew members. The VNAF would make no pilots available 
for such assignment and pressed for the return of the 11 aviation cadets 
so that they might receive language training preparatory to going to the 
United States. General Ty wrote Harkins a letter asking relief from the 
restriction that a VNAF crewman fly aboard Farm Gate planes. This appeared 
impossible and as a result Colonel Hien assigned 15 VNAF non-commissioned 
officers to Farm Gate who would be available to fly on combat missions. 
This arrangement provided a ready source of Vietnamese bodies, but it was 
a subterfuge since the enlisted Vietnamese had no aspirations for flight 
training. When he heard of the arrangement General Moorman urged Anthis 
to be as legitimate as possible. (252) When Admiral Felt visited South 
Vietnam on 22 October, Anthis got little satisfaction as to whether Farm 
Gate would be augmented, Felt merely reporting that Secretary McNamara was 
cool about the matter and suggesting that any augmentation might have to 
be put through in very small piecemeal basis. On the other hand, Colonel 
Hien opposed the proposal to use Chinese pilots to fly VNAF transports and 
this possibility for VNAF pilot augmentation fell through. When Felt was 
in Saigon Anthis told him about the 15 Vietnamese NCOs who had been assigned 
to fly with Farm Gate. Felt accepted this, but he cautioned: "Let's not 
make a point of spreading this around." (253) 
Although Admiral Felt queried Harkins about MACV requirements 
for the 2d Air Division and Farm Gate, Harkins continued to make no recom-
mendation on the matter of the Farm Gate augmentation. According to 
information reaching the 2d Air Division, Anthis' recommendation went through 
the MACV staff readily enough until it reached General Weede. While the 
Farm Gate recommendation languished, other aviation matters received faster 
consideration. On 25 October, for example, Harkins recommended to CINCPAC 
that the US Army Special Forces (Provisional) being formed at Nha Trang 
should be provided an organic US Army aviation unit for its support, in-
cluding four liaison aircraft, four Caribous, 12 HU-1D helicopters, and 
four armed Mohawks. (254) As will be seen, some part of the MACV delay in 
forwarding the request for Farm Gate augmentation had to do with calcula-
tions in progress of aviation requirements to support the MACV National 
Campaign Plan being drawn up for presentation to the Vietnamese. The 
proposed Farm Gate expansion also involved planning for the three-year

expansion of VNAF. After some seeming delay, General Harkins accepted the 
Farm Gate augmentation that Anthis had proposed in September and on 7 November 
formally recommended to CINCPAC that Farm Gate had an immediate requirement 
for augmentation with 5 T-28s, 10 B-26s, and 2 C-47s. It was likely that an 
additional augmentation would be required in order to support the larger 
aviation requirements of the National Campaign Plan. The CINCPAC staff 
required only two days to handle the recommendation, and Felt forwarded it 
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 9 November with the notation that there was 
no reasonable alternative in sight to provide urgently needed combat air 
power. (255) 
In view of President Kennedy's mandate that the primary thrust of American 
assistance in South Vietnam should be to prepare the RVNAF to fight its own 
war, the proposal to augment Farm Gate received detailed study in the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff and at higher levels during November and December. In the 
continuing justification of the Farm Gate expansion the PACAF commanders 
offered evidence that during 1962 -VNAF had demonstrated significant growth 
but by September 1962 had reached a plateau of operational sorties which 
would continue until the return of the 133 Vietnamese pilot trainees from 
the United States sometime in 1963. (256) In 2d Air Division-PACAF analyses 
the VNAF-USAF monthly operational sorties flown in the last half of 1962, 
shown in the following chart, represented a maximum accomplishment which 
nevertheless did not meet operational requirements.

In the last half of 1962 air support and air interdiction continued to 
be the principal offensive employment of VNAF and Farm Gate aircraft. The 
activities of the USAF ALOs and FAes stimulated ARVN commanders to request 
air support and to nominate air interdiction targets, with the result that 
these air activities increased. By September 1962 the Joint Operations 
Center was being compelled to turn down some air support requests for lack

of available aircraft; other air, support missions were scheduled with less 
than an optimum number of strike aircraft; and it was likely that still 
other air support missions were not requested by ARVN commanders who did 
not want to lose face by asking for missions that might not be available. 
The increasing numbers of air interdiction sorties recorded in operational 
statistics in the same months that the JOC was turning dawn requests for 
air support did not reflect a lack of transcendent interest in air support. 
Instead, improved targeting of hostile interdiction objectives permitted 
the ASOCs to direct strike aircraft released fram other missions with un-
expended ordnance to alternate last-resort interdiction targets.

In the last half of 1962 the Joint Operations Center also gave mandatory 
overriding priorities to the escort of Vietnamese trains and motor convoys 
and of ARVN heliborne operations. The escort of the trains and convoys was 
more expensive in terms of VNAF L-19 resources than of strike aircraft, but 
trains and convoys that carried ordnance or other valuable cargo required 
fixed-wing strike air cover and thus required a commitment of strike sorties. 
As a result of Admiral Felt's emphasis upon fixed-wing combat air escort 
for heliborne operations, air escort for helicopter assault operations in-
creased in August 1962 but did not materially enlarge in the monthly totals 
after this time, this despite increasing enemy opposition and the greater 
number of heliborne operations that were being mounted.

The question as to whether Farm Gate should be augmented with additional 
strike aircraft also involved a reconsideration of the proposition often stated 
during the winter of 1961-1962 that the counterinsurgency war in South Vietnam 
would be primarily a ground war, possibly something on the order of 90 percent 
ground and only 10 percent air actions. During 1962 the HVNAF estimated that 
the Vietcong had sustained an estimated 25,000 casualties, of which 6,800 or 
26 percent were claimed as casualties inflicted by air operations. In addition 
to inflicting casualties, information from Vietcong prisoners indicated that 
the pressure of air operations limited the enemy's options and courses of 
action. Airpower was making a major contribution by deterring Vietcong actions, 
this by escort of surface trains and convoys, by protecting vulnerable heli-
borne operations, by preventing the enemy from forming large concentrations in 
the field. The latter activity was keeping the level of violence at a guer-
rilla stage, small enough hopefully to be handled by government forces. As a 
result of air operations during 1962 General Moorman considered that airpower 
had demonstrated that it was of equivalent importance to ground operations in 
a counterinsurgency effort. (257) This military assessment of the role of 
airpower in the counterinsurgency environment in South Vietnam was not com-
pletely shared in Washington. After a visit to Southeast Asia during December 
1962 Roger Hilsman and Michael Forrestal reported to President Kennedy: "On 
the use of air power and the danger of adverse political effects, our impression 
is that the controls on air strikes and the procedures for checking intelligence 
against all sources are excellent. In spite of this, however, it is difficult 
to be sure that air power is being used in a way that minimizes the adverse 
political effects . . . and the 1168 of air power is going up enormously." (258) 
The decision to augment Farm Gate for combat was not lightly or easily 
made in Washington. In order to secure Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
approval for his recommendation of 9 November, Admiral Felt found it necessary

to indicate to General Taylor that he would not be asking for additional US 
combat aviation to support the MACV National Campaign plan. (259) On L. Decem-
ber the joint Chiefs recommended approval of the Farm Gate expansion on the 
grounds that increasing requests for air support far exceeded the combined - 
capabilities of VNAF and Farm Gate. Early in December, Secretary McNamara 
concurred in the augmentation but directed that the State Department's coordina-
tion would be obtained before he submitted the matter to President Kennedy for 
his personal decision. On 31 December, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gilpatric 
finally informed the Joint Chiefs that President Kennedy approved the Farm 
Gate expansion as requested. (260) The time required to make this decision to 
increase the strike aircraft capabilities in South Vietnam unfortunately was 
working in favor of the Vietcong. At the same moment that President Kennedy's 
decision was being delivered to the Joint Chiefs, the Communists were preparing 
to defeat an ARO heliborne operation in an engagement in which a lack of 
strike aircraft would prevent proper air support, and the Communist victory at 
Ap Bac was going to be a significant turning point in the war in South Vietnam.

Chapter 6 
The Neutralization of Laos, 1962-1963 
1. The United States Responds to a Threat to Thailand  
In analysis of potential US actions which might bring pressure upon Boun 
Oum and General Phoumi Nosavan to agree to a neutralist coalition government 
for Laos on 2 January 1962, US Ambassador Winthrop Brown remarked that any 
drastic action might drive the rightist Phoumi to take some military move in 
hope that inevitable Pathet Lao reaction would force the United States to 
implement the Southeast Asia Treaty and came to his support. (1) Under the 
protocol to the SEATO treaty the Government of Laos had the authority to call 
upon the SEATO powers for assistance against Communist aggression, and in the 
course of Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on 9 April 1962, 
Secretary McNamara explained that the SEATO powers had not intervened in Laos 
because the Government of Laos had not requested it and because there has not 
been "any large movements of LCommunistl troops introduced into Laos." 
McNamara continued: "Had it been .necessary [for the Communists] to introduce 
such movements of combat forces into Laos from outside the country, I think 
it is entirely possible that SEATO would have been called upon, would have 
responded, and would have effectively contributed to the defense of that 
country." (2) 
In the weeks after 25 January when the Communists had begun to harass 
Nam Tha in northwestern Laos, General Phoumi ignored American advice and air-
lifted reinforcements there, building the garrison's strength to some 5,000 
men. Pathet Lao and Vietminh forces kept the Phoumist garrison under a light 
siege until 2 May, when a Cammunist force about equal in size to Phoumi's 
defense forces commenced a well-coordinated three-pronged assault preceded 
by artillery preparations. In each case, the Vietnamese acted as shock troops 
and Pathet Lao conducted follow-up actions. On 3 May, the Communists captured 
Muong Sing and its airfield west of Nam Tha, and concerted assaults were 
launched against Nam Tha on 6 May. Shortly after American advisors were evac-
uated by helicopter, Communist troops infiltrated into Nam Tha, whereupon 
Phoumi's officers abandoned their troops, seized available vehicles, and 
began a disorderly retreat toward the Mekong. Communist elements had preceded 
the retreating Phoumist forces to Vieng Phu Kha, about halfway between Nam 
Tha and Ban Houei Sal on the Thai border. Contact at this point turned the 
retreat into a rout, and Phoumi s force of about 5,000 men was pursued the 
last 40 miles by two or three truck loads of Communist soldiers. About 3,000 
of the completely demoralized Lao troops destroyed government stocks at Ban 
Houei Sai and fled into Thailand. The New China News Agency reported the 
Communist capture of Ban Houei Sal, but Able Mable photographs and MAAG visual 
air reconnaissance (both being used to locate Phoumist stragglers as well as 
to get definite information on a very confused situation) revealed that the 
Communists were careful not to come to the Mekong, thus directly hazarding 
Thailand. There was no 'evidence that Chinese Communist troops participated 
in the battle, as charged by the Lao government. (3)

The initial Washington press reports of the Nam Tha ceasefire violation 
stated that President Kennedy and his advisors felt that the Laotian govern-
ment had provoked attack by reinforcing Nam Tha against the advice of 
American officials, and at a news conference on 9 May Kennedy expressed the 
hope for a restoration of the ceasefire and continued political negotiations. 
(4) With Michael V. Forrestal, the President's Special Assistant for Far 
Eastern Affairs, working as coordinator, the State Department put together 
a paper representing the ideas of Secretary Harriman, William H. Sullivan, 
and other specialists in the Intelligence and Far Eastern Affairs Bureaus. 
The paper estimated that the Communists meant to discredit Phoumi but believed 
that they might well continue their probing if the United States did not apply 
counterpressure. It recommended a series of diplomatic moves designed to make 
it clear that the US goal was to reestablish the ceasefire and create a 
neutral Laos through a government of national union but that the United States 
should if compelled occupy the territory held by the Royal Lao government up 
to the ceasefire line. It specifically proposed to send the Seventh Fleet 
to the Gulf of Siam, to move a US battle group already in Thailand on SEATO 
maneuvers to the Thai border opposite Vientiane, to transfer another battle 
group of about a thousand men to Thailand, and to take steps to improve 
communications routes in northeast Thailand in case an occupation of parts 
of Laos were actually necessary. (5) 
On 10 May Roger Hilsman and Secretary Harriman presented the State Depart-
ment paper at a meeting of the National Security Council. In his initial 
reaction, President Kennedy was reluctant to send American troops into Thailand 
because it might prove to be difficult to withdraw them. While the President 
agreed that a do-nothing policy might encourage the Pathet Lao to further 
attacks, he nevertheless found it distasteful to intervene without a full 
knowledge of what was happening. According to Hilsman, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff additionally recommended a crash training and re-equipment effort to 
restore the Lao military forces. Without finally committing himself, President 
Kennedy directed that orders be issued to start the Seventh Fleet moving to-
ward the Gulf of Siam. During the evening two emissaries sent by President 
Kennedy discussed the Lao situation with former-President Eisenhower, who 
favored a very strong move, if necessary putting American troops into Laos. 
(6) 
Even though President Kennedy required more exact data before committing 
American forces, he approved a very strong policy statement after it had 
been staffed by concerned agencies. This statement noted that US policy was 
based upon the fundamental assumption that the Lao Army was totally incapable 
of preventing the Communists from over-running Laos, if North Vietnamese 
units remained actively engaged. It continued: me Nam Tha debacle is a 
graphic demonstration of the correctness of our basic assumption. No matter 
from what perspective this debacle is viewed, the root cause rests with 
General Phoumi. We can only arrive at a position of absolutely no confidence

in Phoumi either politically or militarily. We believe our best interest 
would be served if he were eliminated entirely from the Laotian scene. 
This effort will be pursued as an undeviating policy objective parallel 
with our continuing fundamental policy of attenpting (A) to restore the 
cease-fire, (B) to establish a coalition government, and (C) to put the 
Geneva agreements into effect." It Vientiane the US MAAG personally delivered 
the news to Phoumi that the United States had lost confidence in him as a mili-
tary leader. The re-equipment of the defeated troops would be initiated only 
when Phoumi completed a long list of needed military reforms. (7) 
Always anxious that the Communists might establish positions of strength 
on Thailand's borders, the Thai government viewed the rout at Nam Tha with 
the utmost gravity. In a statement issued in Bangkok, the Government of 
Thailand noted that the Communist seizure of Muong Sing and Nam Tha in 
flagrant violation of the Lao ceasefire had pushed Communist forces toward 
the Thai border, and it requested that American forces be stationed in 
Thailand to cooperate with Thai armed forces in defense of Thailand. (8) 
"I can honestly do no less, despite implications," US Ambassador Kenneth 
Todd Young messaged Washington from Bangkok, "than recommend preparation 
for pre-emptive occupation of strategic areas in the Mekong Valley on 
opposite sides of the river in Laos and Thailand." (9) On 12 May, as directed 
by President Kennedy, Admiral Felt alerted Joint Task Force 116 for an immedi-
ate deployment to Thailand. Within the next few days, President Kennedy 
emphasized that the Americans were going to Thailand at the request of the 
Thais to stabilize the situation rather than to change the US policy toward 
Laos, which Continued to be the reestablishment of an effective ceasefire 
and prompt negotiations for a government of national union. He pointed out 
that the United States did not know whether or not the Communist breach of 
the ceasefire at Nam Tha was the beginning of a general series of ceasefire 
violations that would imperil Thailand. (10) After meeting in Bangkok on 
16 May, the SEATO Council Representatives emphasized that the movement of 
forces into Thailand was "entirely precautionary and defensive in character" 
but it was also "a warning that any Communist aggression would be resisted." 
(11) In retrospect Roger Hilaman would note: "The purpose of putting the 
troops in Thailand rather than Laos was to say, 'Look, if you don't have a 
cease-fire and don't negotiate and you do break the cease-fire and attack in 
Laos, then we will introduce troops.' We put them into Thailand to deliver 
a double message, a message that we would stand if challenged but that it 
was a limited response. We were not ambitious to unite Laos and make it a 
bastion of anticommunism." (12) 
When President Kennedy issued orders for the movement of American forces 
into Thailand, both the Joint Chiefs of Staff and CINCPAC were presented with 
a number of unforeseen planning difficulties. The existing CINCPAC 32 series 
operations plan was the basic plan for US operations in Southeast Asia. The 
plan was developed to meet four phases of prospective hostile activity: 
259

Phase I -- Alert, Phase II -- Insurgency, Phase III-- External aggression 
by North Vietnam, and Phase IV -- External aggression by Communist China. 
In this plans series, Operations Plan 32-59 Phase II (Laos) was available 
for implementation. This plan required the movement of Joint Task Force 
116 to Laos very quickly. With a small permanent nucleus staff (USMC TF-79)-
in being on Okinawa, the Commanding General, 3d Marine Division was the 
designated commander of JTF-116. While PACAF was canmitted to provide an 
Air Force Component Commander and combat forces to include an F-100 tactical 
fighter squadron and a reconnaissance air task force (six RF-101s), the 
surface forces designated for JTF-116 were predominantly US Marine units. 
If needed after the additional deployment, Army battle groups would reinforce 
the Marines and command of JTF-116 would pass to an Army general officer. (13) 
Even though CINCPAC would implement Operations Plan 32-59 Phase II 
(Laos) as the instrument for effecting the US deployment, the plan had to be 
modified to meet unforeseen conditions. The Thai government was genuinely 
alarmed and required reassurance in addition to the deployment of JTF-116. 
The Army 1st Battle Group, 27th Infantry, which had just completed partici-
pation in the SEATO Air Cobra maneuvers, was already in Thailand and would be 
present when the Marines arrived. According to arrangements made with 
Marshal Sarit, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed CINCPAC on 13 May to estab-
lish the US Military Assistance Command Thailand (USMACHTHAI), thus giving 
Thailand the same over-all American command status already accorded to Vietnam 
by the organization of the US Military Assistance Command Vietnam (USMACV) 
earlier in the year. The Joint Chiefs of Staff provided that General Paul D. 
Harkins, COMUSMACV, would also serve as COMUSMACTHAI. As COMDSMACHTHAI, 
General Harkins would report directly to CINCPAC, and USMACTHAI would consist 
of JTF-116, JUSMAG Thailand, and such other US military elements as were in 
Thailand or ordered there separately. The Joint Chiefs also directed CINCPAC 
to designate Lt. Gen. J. L. Richardson, Deputy CINC US Army Pacific, as 
Commander dliT-116 and to send him to Thailand. (14) On this same day, General 
O'Donnell designated Brig. Gen. Stephen D. McElroy, Vice Commander, Thirteenth 
Air Force as Air Force Component Commander for JTF-116. (15) 
Preparations for the aerial phase of the deployment of American forces 
to Thailand began on Okinawa between UC Task Force 79 and the 315th Air 
Division on 10 May, when the air division received a revealing order cancel-
ling the retrograde airlift of the Army battle group from Thailand. (16) 
For the next few days, however, the air deployment planning was general. 
On 15 May CINCPAC established USMACTHAI, designated General Richardson as 
Commander JTF-116 under CINCPAC Operations Plan 32-59, Phase II (Laos), and 
directed Richardson to assemble an advance echelon staff in Hawaii and to 
proceed to Bangkok as soon as practicable. CINCPAC defined the mission of 
JTF-116 as being: (1) to give a clear indication of US intention to carry 
out commitments in defense of Thailand, (2) to have a "precautionary impact" 
on the situation in Laos, and (3) to position US forces for faster reaction 
time for possible future actions. (17)

Hastily assembling a small advance echelon staff, General Richardson 
left Hawaii on 15 May, stopped briefly in Saigon for conversations with 
General Harkins and then flew on to 'Bangkok where he opened his command 
post in the US MAAG compound on the evening of 16 May. Meanwhile on 15 May, 
the. 1st Battle Group, 27th Infantry moved to a bivouac near Korat, where it 
would be reinforced by 1,200 troops later in May and early June. To assist 
the movement of the Marines who were arriving at Bangkok on naval vessels, 
the 315th Air Division concentrated a force of C-130 transports at Don Muang. 
The 3d Marine Expeditionary Brigade began to come ashore on 16 May, and the 
315th Air Division plied a two day shuttle service between Don Mhang and 
Udorn beginning on 17 May. The Marine garrison going into Udorn included a 
battalion landing team of about 1,800 men, Detachment "Z" of Navy Mobile 
Construction Battalion No. 3, and a Provisional Marine Air Group, the latter 
comprised of an A4D jet fighter squadron and a helicopter squadron. At the 
completion of the shuttle flights between Bangkok and Udorn, 315th Air 
Division C-130 aircraft want to Naha Air Base, where on 19 May the 315th 
commenced an airlift stream moving personnel and equipment from Okinawa to 
Thailand which continued until 3 June. With the arrival of designated 
JTF-116 headquarters personnel from Okinawa, General Richardson established 
Headquarters, JTF-116 at Karat on 22; May but left a Rear Echelon of the 
headquarters in Bangkok. Headed by Maj. Gen. Donald M. Weller, USMC, who 
was chief of staff of JTF-116, this Rear Echelon would work with Maj. Gen. 
J. T. Conway, Chief of MUSMAG, in performing the functions of USMACTHAI. 
Elements of the Army 9th Logistical Command already in Thailand were grouped 
together at .Korat. Late in May, an Army Utility Transport Company, with 
10 HUlA armed helicopters, was moved. fram Okinawa to join the Army battle 
group. The Army's 1st Aviation Company arrived at Korat on 10 July with 
18 Caribou light transport planes, six of which were soon sent to Vietnam. 
(18) 
Drawing upon the Thirteenth Air Force headquarters staff, General 
McElroy formed the first increment of the Air Force Component Command staff 
at Clark Air Base on 14 May. The serious nature of the assignment was ex-
pressed in a warning in the travel orders, which contained: This is not a 
Field Training Exercise." On 14 May, the Thirteenth Air Force's 510th 
Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed its F-100 jets from Clark to Takhli. 
As soon as he received a task force movement directive, General McElroy 
accompanied the advance cadre of the AFCC to Don Muang on 16 May, where the 
Royal Thai Air Force allowed the AFCC to set up on the second floor of the 
Thai air-ground operations school building. As early as 18 May same USAF 
personnel were integrated into the Thai Air Operations Center (AOC), but 
a full-scale USAF AOC was in operation on 1 June. Getting a US Combat 
Reporting Center (CRC) set up took longer since at the end of the Air Cobra 
exercise, Detachment 1, 5th Tactical Control Group, which had been operating 
a CRC at Don Muang, had torn down its heavy radar and had begun an expedited 
movement to Ubon Airfield, where it was setting up to cover the critical 
northwestern air approaches to South Vietnam. A fix for this situation

awaited the accomplishment of a Tactical Air Command CASF deployment --
nicknamed "Sawbuck" -- which the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed on 18-22 May. 
In this CASF, the 478th Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed from Cannon AFB, 
New Mexico, to Clark Air Base on 20 May and then on 4 June further deployed 
to Takhli, where it relieved the 510th Squadron for return to Clark. On 
19-20 May, the 62d Troop Carrier Squadron began to move 16 0-130 transports 
from Sewart AFB, Tennessee, to Clark Air Base, where it would augment 315th 
Air Division Airlift for a month. Personnel required to establish the 
separate US CRC at DonMaangwere drawn from the 728th Aircraft Control and 
Warning Squadron at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. This CRC moved from Clark 
to Don Muang on 5 June, and it became fully operational on 22 June. Added 
to these initial deployments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff further authorized 
"Sawbuck II" encompassing the deployment of the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron, 
with 16 C-123 aircraft. This CASF departed Pope AFB, North Carolina, on 
28 May. Four of these aircraft were sent to Don Muang and the others were 
located at Da Nang Airfield in South Vietnam. (19) 
When asked to describe the work of the Air Force Component Command of 
Joint Task Force 116, one member of General McElroy s staff would recall: 
"AFCC was required to play it by ear." (20) Where the American forces had 
rushed to Thailand with some expectation of being employed in active opera-
tions, it was soon evident that the whole affair would turn out to be an 
extended exercise. According to JTF-116 plans, General McElroy should have 
moved his headquarters and AOC to Korat to join General Richardson, but the 
existing Thai communications links radiated out from Don Muang to the up-
country airfields and there were no cross-communications between the forward 
airfields. As a result, the AFCC had to remain at Don Muang. General 
Richardson also wanted to move the Able Mable photo processing center from 
Don Muang to Korat, but here again Richardson somewhat ruefully reported 
that the PPC was "in concrete" and could not be moved from Don Muang. (21) 
Even though the Royal Thai Air Force was extremely cooperative, the Thai 
government ruled that all allied forces in Thailand would operate on a 
coordinated basis under separate national control. Under this rule, Allied 
air units that came into Thailand in May and June -- Royal Australian Air 
Force No. 79 Squadron with Avon Sabres at Ubon, a Royal New Zealand Bristol 
Freighter Squadron at Korat, and the Royal Air Force No. 20 Squadron with 
Hawker Hunter aircraft at Chiang-Mai -- were outside the control of JTF-116. 
General McElroy nevertheless established working relationships whereby the 
Thai, British, Australian, and Marine tactical fighter effort was coordinated 
through his AOC. The American fighters were fragged for high explosive 
attacks against Lao targets and maintained strip air defense alert commit-
ments, but the major air effort comprised simulated air defense missions and 
cooperative air-ground training sorties. The Allied tactical fighter squadrons 
consistently honored American requests for training sorties, and the RNZAF 
Bristol Freighter squadron shared intra-Thailand airlift responsibilities 
with the C-123s of the 777th Troop Carrier Squadron. (22)

Although General McElroy was able to improvise working procedures 
lending Some semblance of unity to the air effort in Thailand, the command 
arrangements were nevertheless inconsistent with the PACAF objective of 
establishing a unity of USAF activities throughout Southeast Asia, most 
desirably under the aegis of the Thirteenth Air Force. Under the PACAF 
command arrangements in effect after November 1961 the 2d Advon in Saigon 
had command authority over the collection of USAF detachments in South 
Vietnam and also over Detachment 10 at Don Muang. Under command of Colonel 
William J. Jones after 27 February 1962, Detachment 10, Thirteenth Air Force, 
possessed operational control over Bell Tone and Able Mable and also provided 
them housekeeping services. In this manner the Bell Tone detachment of four 
F-102 air defense fighters which periodically rotated from Clark Air Base 
to Don Muang was made a part of a theater-wide air defense complex. The 
versatile RF-101 day photo reconnaissance planes, rotated to the Able Mable 
detachment by the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron until 23 May 1962, 
and by the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron for a stint after this, 
happened to be based at Don Muang but performed missions for American activi-
ties in Laos, Vietnam, Hawaii, and Washington. When night photography was 
needed to cover Communist activities in Laos, PACAF added two Black Watch 
RB-26s to the Able Mable task force on 18 May. This was intended to be a 
temporary expedient to be used until "Toy Tiger" camera and illumination 
modifications could be made to permit RF-101s to perform night photography. 
(23) Although 2d Advon, Thirteenth Air Force, had became subordinate to 
COMUSMACV when this headquarters was established, PACAF nevertheless con-
tinued to possess a direct channel of authority to both Bell Tone and Able 
Mable, which was appropriate since they performed theater air functions. 
When CINCPAC was preparing his orders to CJTF-116, Lt. Gen. Thomas S. Moorman, 
Vice CINCPACAF, argued that Bell Tone and Able Mable ought not to be placed 
under a local area commander, but his reasoning was not accepted at the time, 
and CJTF-116 was authorized control of all US forces in Thailand. (24) 
On a higher level, Admiral Felt also had misgivings about the command 
arrangement in Southeast Asia. The establishment of COMUSMACTHAI and the 
deployment of J2F-116 to Thailand, when coupled with the "two hat" status 
for General Harkins as both COMUSMACV and COMUSMACTHAI, produced a layering 
of staffs and an unnecessary duplication of command functions. And if General 
Harkins was to serve in a "two hat" capacity he needed a small separate staff 
and operational deputies who would be in active charge of the two country 
organizations -- MACV and MACTHAI. After discussions with General Harkins 
and securing the endorsement of-PACOM component commanders, Admiral Felt 
recommended to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 30 May a general reorganization 
of the command arrangements in Southeast Asia. Coincident with an early 
disestablishment of JTF-116, Felt proposed that General Harkins' dual role 
as COMUSMACV-COMUSMACTHAI be formalized by establishing a new Headquarters 
USMACV/THAI. In this position, General Harkins would have a small staff in 
Saigon and would be superimposed over the separate headquarters of USMACV 
and USMACTHAI, each of which would be headed by a Deputy Commander. The

Deputy Commander, USMACTHAI could be either an Army or Marine major general, 
but Felt recommended that the Deputy Commander, USMACV should be an Air Force 
lieutenant general. He demonstrated that this recommended command structure 
would permit an easy transition into the implementation of the CINCPAC 
32-series operations plans or the SEATO contingency plans. (25) 
For a variety of reasons that would be disclosed over the next several 
months, the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not directly reply to CINCPAC's command 
reorganization recommendation of 30 May. Informal information from Washington 
nevertheless indicated that the concept of a single command structure in 
Southeast Asia was acceptable in principle to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
although only the Army chief wanted to go to the extreme of establishing a 
separate US unified command in Southeast Asia. (26) Rarly in June, Admiral 
Felt was instructed to proceed with planning for an early disestablishment 
of JTF-116 and the establishment of a single COMUSMAC over both Vietnam and 
Thailand. On 16 June, CINCPAC accordingly issued a planning concept whereby 
most of the US forces in Thailand would be assigned to the operational control 
of the new COMUSMACTHAI but that some other forces -- including the Able Mable 
air reconnaissance task force -- would be kept directly under command of 
PACOM component commanders. (27) 
In any coMmand arrangement in Southeast Asia, Genera150'Ebnnell and 
Moorman were adamant that there should be a single Air Force component command 
that would be responsive to theater air as well as local air missions. In 
line with CINCPAC's 30 May recommendation, General Moorman believed that an 
air component commander ought to be designated to General Harkins. Toward 
this end, PACAF requested USAF to act unilaterally to redesignate the 
anomalous 2d Advon, Thirteenth Air Force as an organized and constituted unit 
and to replace its equally anomalous detachments with regularly organized 
units. As far as Thailand was concerned, this woula involve redesignation 
of Detachment 10 as the 6010th Tactical Group, with command over two air base 
squadrons, the 6011th at Takhli and the 6012th at Ubon. This was not only an 
organizational ploy but it was sorely needed since Colonel Jones' Detachment 
10 had been compelled to split its strength into small units which were pro-
viding housekeeping services to the AFCC at Don Muang, the fighte-: squadron 
at Takhli, and the radar Combat Reporting Post (CRP) at Ubon. (28) As far 
as he was personally concerned, General Harkins was in favor of a single 
Air Force component commander, but the CINCPAC planning concept of 16 June 
envisioned a separate assignment of forces to COMUSNACV and COMUSMACTHAI. 
At this juncture, General O'Donnell still hoped that the over-all reorgani-
zation would provide a single air component, but meanwhile General McElroy 
and Colonel Jones were having administrative problems which demanded relief. 
On 20 June, General 0' Donnell announced that the air organization in 
Thailand would be separate from but parallel to the 2d Advon organization 
in Vietnam. He therefore directed that General McElroy would be the Air 
Force Component Commander to COMUSMACTHAI and also the Commander of the 
6010th Tactical Group. As commander of the 6010th General McElroy would be

directly responsible to the Thirteenth Air Force and would have operational 
control of Able Mable. This cammand organization went into effect on 
10 July, when PACAF published orders establishing the 6010th Tactical Group 
and its two air base squadrons. (29) 
Encouraged by tentative agreements of the Lao princes in early June 
looking toward a Lao union Government, President Kennedy dramatized the 
good intentions of the United States by ordering the withdrawal of 1,000 
Marines from Thailand. Following a White House announcement, the Provisional 
Marine Air Group and one Marine company began to move out of Udorn on 
2 July for Bangkok, where the units loaded aboard waiting vessels. (30) 
Later that month, at the Secretary of Defense Conference in Hawaii on 
23 July, Secretary McNamara said he wanted to remove the remaining Marines 
and the Army battle group from Thailand within two to three months. He said, 
however, that the USAF tactical fighter squadron on deployment at Takhli 
would have to remain in Thailand for the time being since its removal would 
doubtless lead the British, Australians, and New Zealanders to follow suit. 
In a general discussion of the removal of the American forces, no one posed 
objections to the redeployment of the Marines, but General Harkins wanted 
to continue to send US Army units into Thailand for training, perhaps every 
four months, after the withdrawal of the battle group. McNamara agreed and 
authorized expenditure of approximately $50,000 to construct a temporary 
camp near Korat for deployed US forces. (31) 
On 27 July the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the withdrawal of the 
remainder of the Marine Expeditionary Brigade from Thailand, and in early 
August these forces were withdrawn from Udorn and returned by airlift and 
sealift to their station on Okinawa, the withdrawal being completed on 
7 August. By this time Admiral Felt was also considering the removal of 
the Army battle group and the Air Force tactical fighter squadron, but the 
,political implications dictated that any withdrawal be coordinated with the 
Thais far in advance of actual withdrawal. In lieu of withdrawing the 
Army battle group without relief it was decided on 13 August to relieve 
this battle group with another from Hawaii and that prior to the completion 
of a four months training tour a final decision would be made as to whether 
the new battle group would be replaced or relieved. In late August and 
early September, the 1st Battle Group, 35th Infantry (Reinforced) was 
replaced by the 1st Battle Group, 27th Infantry (Reinforced), the rotation 
being completed on 4 September. On 14 August, the Joint Chiefs decided 
that a tactical fighter squadron would be a continuing requirement in 
Thailand for some time. Accordin glY, 430th Tactical Fighter Squadron crews 
and personnel were flown out fram Gannon AFB to Takhli, where they relieved 
the men of the 478th Squadron on 3-4 September. (32)

The question of when Joint Task Force 116 could be disestablished in 
Thailand was, of course, affected by political relations with the Thais, 
but it was also dependent upon inter-related factors including Southeast 
Asian command organization under discussion in Washington, future American 
strategic plans for Laos, and future US military and logistic plans for 
Thailand. At a closed-door session on Laos held on 10 May during a visit 
of Secretary McNamara and Admiral Felt to Saigon, Admiral Felt strongly 
insisted that US air strikes should have been conducted against the 
Communists in Laos from the beginning of their campaign against the Royal 
Lao forces and a future US strategy ought to be based upon offensive US air 
action. General Lemnitzer partially agreed with Felt's emphasis upon air 
action, but he laid even greater stress upon requirements for large amounts 
of US ground strength. In a private conversation following the conference, 
Admiral Felt remarked that he had been unable to get McNamara and Lemnitzer 
"to understand that all actions do not have to be taken on the ground --
they had to tie all operations with ground operations." Felt was also dis-
turbed that McNamara had stated that Laos had "nothing to do with South 
Vietnam" -- a statement which Felt said was just not true. Upon his return 
to Hawaii, Felt initiated planning for Laos according to a concept that 
provided for increased employment of airpower and for the commitment of 
additional air units. With Joint Chiefs of Staff approval of the new con-
cept, CINCPAC operations Plan 32-63, Phase II (Laos) was prepared and 
published on 7 September 1962. This plan visualized that in the event of 
renewed Communist aggression, US and Thai forces would hold around Vientiane 
while cutting-off and securing the panhandle area of southern Laos. The 
tactical concept of the revised plan put more emphasis on the offensive use 
of airpower and the probability that US forces would be required to seize 
ground objectives against enemy opposition, rather than make unopposed 
movements into Laos. The concept also provided that early air strikes would 
be conducted against enemy forces, bases, and lines of communications and 
that a positive aerial interdiction program would be conducted, with the 
objective of isolating southern Laos from Vietnam. American forces to be 
committed in Thailand and Laos included two tactical fighter squadrons, one 
tactical bomber squadron, a tactical reconnaissance task force, and a detach-
ment of an air commando group from the Air Force; one infantry division and 
one light armored cavalry regiment from the Army; and an expeditionary 
brigade, composite air group, and appropriate supporting elements from the 
Marines. (33) 
The deployment of American forces to Thailand in May and June 1962 
adequately demonstrated that the existing Thai logistic base was inadequate 
to support US or SEATO operations. As a result, CINCPAC and the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff established an anticipatory action program for Thailand 
which was soon referred to as "Special Logistics Actions Thailand" or "SLAT". 
The preliminary planning for SLAT was mainly accomplished by the Rear Echelon 
of JTF-116 at Bangkok in coordination with the US Navy Officer in Charge of 
Construction (OICC). In this matter, the Rear Echelon, JTF-116, was

functioning in lieu of USMACTHAI, which was not manned. Projects were 
drawn up and forwarded to Washington, where on 22 and 29 June Secretary 
McNamara approved 15 of them, some tentatively pending completion of 
engineering studies. The project list included additional locomotives and . 
rolling stock for Thai railways; building of POL pipelines inland from the 
ocean terminal at Bangkok; the construction of a "major air terminal" at 
Nakhon Phanam; the construction of engineer storage depots at Korat and 
Udorn and storage of tactical pipeline, pierced steel planking, and other 
engineer supplies in them; the construction of PSP taxiways and parking 
areas at various Thai airfields; and the development of a tropospheric 
scatter communications system between Bangkok and Saigon. (34) With the 
exception of US pre-positioned equipment and supplies, it was planned that 
title to the logistical improvements would pass to the Thais, who would use 
them to enhance their defense capabilities while sibultaneously maintaining 
than in readiness to support US or SEATO contingency operations. (35) 
During the summer and autumn of 1962, both the CINCPAC "Panhandle" 
operational concept and "SLAT" were under active examination. Ambassador 
Young spent "numerous strenuous hours" with Maj. Gen. J. T. Conway, Chief 
of JUSMAG, "probing many military, economic and political problems affecting 
optimum and feasible security forces for Thailand from purely American view-
point." Ambassador Young was convinced that the major danger to Thailand 
was internal subversion and insurgency, and, as he said: "Our tasks here 
as in Vietnam are to beat Mao and Ho at their awn game of fluid village 
warfare." .In short, Young wanted to equip and train the Thai armed forces 
for a counterinsurgency mission. After discussions with General Harkins, 
Richardson, Conway, and Weller, however, Young reluctantly agreed with the 
military plan to develop Thai forces according to a "two track" approach, 
whereby infantry battalions and airlift mobility would be emphasized. This 
would permit the regular Thai forces to be used for combatting insurgency 
incidents, while maintaining a rfadiness for conventional military operations. 
Ambassador Young explained his feelings and "reservations as Chief of Mission 
and the President's representative" in a message to Secretary Rusk on 
30 September 1962. Early in 1963 he would became even more convinced that 
the American MAP for Thailand should be principally used to prepare the Thai 
armed forces to resist insurgency. (36) 
Where Ambassador Young had political reservations that could affect 
the conduct of proposed CINCPAC operations in Laos, General Maxwell D. Taylor, 
the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, displayed some military 
skepticism about the "Panhandle" plan when he was briefed by General Harkins 
in Bangkok on 14 September. Noting that the Allied force consisting of a 
US Army division, Thai division, and US Marine brigade was expected to hold 
Vientiane and cut off southern Laos against a potential opposition of 14 
North Vietnamese divisions, Taylor suggested the facts of life would indicate 
that a more modest objective might be in order, or at least a coordinated 
effort, including an operation from South Vietnam or possibly a threat from

the east by way of the South China Sea. Taylor was also interested about 
the logistics actions that would be required to support the US force of 
some 100,000 men through Thailand. (37) 
While Air Force officers did not question the CINCPAC operation plan 
for Laos, they were actively concerned about the SLAT project which called 
for the construction of a major air terminal at Nakhon Phanom. No one at 
General McElroy's Air Force Component Command was consulted about the proposal 
to locate a new airfield at the site at Nakhon Phanom, which was on the left 
bank of the Mekong River directly opposite Thaknek in Laos. Air Vice Marshal 
Dawee Chullasapya of the Royal Thai Air Force did not like the site because 
it would be extremely vulnerable to infiltration from Laos and because the 
generally swampy terrain in the area was likely to cause drainage problems. 
Both Air Vice Marshal Dawee and General McElroy thought that consideration 
whould be given to locating the airfield farther from the border and where 
soil conditions would be better and pointed out that such a site was available 
near the town of Sakon Nakhon. When directed to prepare design instructions 
for an engineering study of a major air terminal, PACAF specified a require-
ment for an 8,000-foot runway that could be expanded to 10,000 feet. Both 
the objections to the site and the PACAF criteria were rejected by CINCPAC 
on 7 August, when he issued his own design instructions for an airfield at 
Nakhon Phanom, to include a 6,000-foot PSP runway capable of handling C-130 
and C-124 landings. CINCPAC reasoned that the field would be advantageous 
for injecting troops into the Thaknek area and thence across the narrow 
neck of Laos. If it became necessary to establish air superiority over the 
airhead, this could be done from existing airfields in Thailand or from 
Seventh Fleet aircraft carriers. (38) 
At the Seventh Secretary of Defense Conference held in Hawaii on 
8 October 1962, Secretary McNamara and Assistant Secretary Harriman were 
briefed on CINCPAC Operations Plan 32-63, Phase II (Laos). Although Secre-
tary McNamara directed that the entire plan would be reviewed in Washington 
for logistic feasibility, neither he nor Harriman had any critical suggestions. 
McNamara advised that the plan ought to be made generally acceptable to the 
Thais, to include provisions for maintaining protective forces in northern 
Thailand, and to provide that Thai forces would fight beside US forces, this 
in order to make the plan acceptable to the American public. McNamara also 
emphasized that the SLAT program should be responsive to CINCPAC's Ops Plan 
32-63. (39) Following the Secretary of Defense Conference, the SLAT program 
was firmed up as quickly as negotiations with Thailand would allow. Early 
in September Detachment "Y" of Navy Mobile Construction Battalion No. 3 had 
already replaced Detachment "2" of Navy Mobile Construction Battalion No. 10 
at Udorn, and Detachment "Y" was almost immediately moved to Nakhon Phanom. 
The main body of Navy Mobile Construction Battalion No. 3 closed into Nakhon 
Phanom in November 1962, under CINCPAC orders to complete bare-base air 
facilities as earlier specified as early as possible but in any event by 
June 1963. (L4) When negotiations failed to settle the question of the

ownership of the proposed POL line from Bangkok to Don Muang, this item 
was removed from the SLAT program for separate consideration, and other 
projects were finally approved early in 1963. As finalized, the US-Thai 
logistics agreement provided for increasing the rolling stock of the Thai 
railways, the construction of Nakhon Phanom airfield, developing a tropo-
scatter communications system, the construction of the engineer storage 
depots, and for an additional road construction project which would permit 
military traffic to by-pass the congested city of Bangkok. (41) 
The progress in developments looking toward an international neutrali-
zation of Laos as well as other US undertakings allowed military planners to 
get back to the task of devising a command structure for Southeast Asia as 
a necessary preliminary to the disestablishment of JTF-116. Within the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, General LeMay firmly believed that airpower was being 
"depreciated rather than appreciated" in Southeast Asia because of several 
factors, not the least of which was an Army orientation in the commands 
there. LeMay accordingly pushed hard for acceptance of an Air Force lieu-
tenant general as Deputy Commander, USMACV, and on 22 August the Joint Chiefs 
concurred in the assignment and requested Secretary McNamara to approve it. 
In this and in general principle, the Joint Chiefs were favorable to Admiral 
Felt's recommendations of 30 May, but the State Department and the Secretary 
of Defense were not. The State Department was critical of the "formidable 
array of rank" that would result in Saigon and also objected that it would be 
a "political minus" to place US activities in Vietnam and Thailand under a 
single US military commander. Secretary McNamara withheld his approval in 
deference to President Kennedy"s mandate that the level of US forces in 
Thailand be reduced as rapidly as possible. (42) 
The protocol of the declaration of the Geneva Conference on the 
neutrality of Laos signed on 23 July 1962 provided that all foreign troops 
were to be withdrawn from Laos by 7 October 1962. At the time of the agree-
ment, the United States had 685 military advisors in Laos, and orders were 
issued to Maj. Gen. Reuben H. Tucker', US Army, to select 70 members of his 
MAAG Laos staff for integration into the JUSMAG Thailand. (43) On 15 Sep-
tember 1962, Admiral Felt had no positive indicators as to the withdrawal 
of US forces from Thailand, but he told General Harkins that he doubted that 
Harkins would be authorized a COMUSMACTHAI staff to be resident in Thailand. 
He suggested that Harkins employ the Chief JUSMAG Thailand as his resident 
chief of staff for USMACTHAI without an additional staff allowance. (L44) 
When he visited Saigon and Bangkok early in this same month, General Taylor 
was actively interested in plans for command organization. In regard to 
the existing organization, Taylor told Harkins it looked like he was "putting 
layer upon layer upon layer and that the Sec Def would not stand for it." 
In Bangkok Taylor observed that the Air Force did not believe "in fragmenting 
the air effort to the same extent that ground forces were required to tdo7"

McElroy assured Taylor that "General OIDOnnell's ultimate objective for 
the air effort in Southeast Asia was one single command for both South 
Vietnam and Thailand." (45) 
After having studied Admiral Felt's advice and discussing command 
organization with General Taylor, General Harkins was opposed to employing 
a MAAG for operational and intelligence planning since this would dilute 
its primary training and advisory duty. Harkins wanted to retain the 
COMUSMACTHAI designation because of its prestige value with the Thais and 
with SEATO nations. He was sure that it would be practical to have a single 
air command for both Vietnam and Thailand, while maintaining separate, 
USMACTHAI and USMACV headquarters to handle local operational functions. 
(46) On 19 September, Admiral Felt nevertheless proposed two alternate 
command reorganization plans which could be effected at the dissolution of 
JTF-116. The first alternative would disestablish COMUSMACTHAI and retain 
CHJUSMAG Thailand as the senior US representative in Thailand with some 
augmentation to handle SLAT and other operational functions. Operational 
control of units rotating through Thailand would be exercised through 
PACOM component commanders with CHJUSMAG in a coordinating role. The second 
alternative was applicable in case USMACTHAI had to be retained through 
political necessity. In this case, Felt proposed to give CHJUSMAG Thai an 
additional hat as Chief of Staff COMUSMACTHAI and to allow General Harkins 
as COMUSMACV/THAI to exercise operational control of forces in Thailand. 
He noted that CINCUSARPAC and CINCPACAF concurred in either proposal but 
preferred the second, but that General Harkins probably would agree only 
with the second alternative. (47) While General Taylor did not make detailed 
recommendations on the subject of command after visiting East Asia, he told 
President Kennedy and Secretaries Rusk and McNamara that military command 
in Southeast Asia required attention since "it appears layered, fragments 
the US air power in the area, and fails to provide General Harkins with an 
adequate staff." (48) 
In preparation for a closely-held discussion that was to take place 
between Secretary McNamara, Admiral Felt, and Generals Taylor and Harkins 
during the Secretary of Defense Conference at Hawaii on 8 October 1962, 
Admiral Felt solicited his commanders' final thinking on command organiza-
tion in Southeast Asia. Late in September, General Harkins sent Felt a 
working paper which argued the case for a USMACTHAI organization separate 
from JUSMAG Thailand. In addition to his earlier ideas, General Harkins 
made a case for an organization that would provide a quick transition into 
a fighting situation wherein a CINCPAC or SEATO plan might be implemented 
and proposed that General Tucker's 70 persons who were arriving in Bangkok 
from Vientiane could staff a USMACTHAI organization. Admiral Felt would 
not accept these proposals. In case a CINCPAC or SEATO operations plan 
should be implemented, appropriate combat component commanders would arrive 
in Southeast Asia very quickly. Felt further visualized that CHJUSMAG ought 
to be returned to his former high status in Thailand. He had already

provided directives which allowed General Tucker to know that, even though 
located in Bangkok, he would continue to perform US MAF support functions 
for Laos. (49) On L. October General O'Donnell sent Admiral Felt a detailed 
analysis of the PACAF position on a Southeast Asia command structure. In 
summary, PACAF supported moving with all possible speed toward the establish-
ment of one subordinate unified commander responsible to CINCPAC for US 
efforts in Southeast Asia, and the identification of General Harkins' estab-
lishment in Saigon as the focal point for all planning and operations on the 
Southeast Asian mainland. PACAF recognized that actually identifying Harkins 
as the single over-all commander might be a political problem, but it believed 
that "deliberate, progressive steps should facilitate and accelerate" such 
an eventuality. It might be temporarily necessary for CHJUSMAG Thailand to 
double as chief of staff USMACTHAI, but the CHJUSMAG Thailand should not have 
operational or planning responsibilities but should concentrate on advisory 
and training functions. General O'Donnell pointed out that General Harkins' 
staff in Saigon should be a proper joint staff and urged that Harkins' 
deputy commander should be an Air Force lieutenant general. He urged that 
the Commander, 2d Advon (which would appropriately redesignated as the USAF 
2d Air Division) should be recognized as the single air component commander 
in Southeast Asia subordinate to General Harkins in the unified cammand 
chain. (50) 
Held as planned on 8 October, the discussion of Southeast Asia military 
command organization was limited to McNamara, Taylor, Felt, and Harkins. These 
men agreed that General Harkins would continue as CCHUSMACV/THAI and would be 
assisted by a small joint staff to handle Southeast Asian planning as directed 
to be done by CINCPAC. In Bangkok, CHJUSMAG Thai (General Conway) would serve 
concurrently as Deputy COMUSMACTHAI. Secretary McNamara stated that General 
Harkins would remain in direct charge of the counterinsurgency program in 
South Vietnam and would not require an Air Force deputy in South Vietnam. 
The conferees considered two other matters which would require subsequent 
decision. It was proposed to concentrate "all air responsibilities" in 
Southeast Asia (less Air MAA( functions) in the Commander, 2d Air Division, 
who would report to Harkins in his dual Thai/Vietnam position. Here, Admiral 
Felt noted that he would prefer to have the Commander, 2d Air Division, 
report directly to C1NCPACAF for US air operations. Similarly it was proposed 
to place the Army Logistical Support Group in Thailand and any Army troops 
rotated into that country under General Conway. Here again, Admiral Felt 
preferred to keep these responsibilities under CINCUSARPAC. (51) Admiral 
Felt's position on the control of Air Force and Army troops in Southeast Asia 
sprang from his concept that US forces in Thailand and Vietnam were "performing 
advisory and military assistance functions and are not there for combat.... 
If a fighting plan should be executed, a combat component commander would 
arrive on the scene quickly." (52) After the Secretary of Defense Conference 
and just before General Harkins left Honolulu for Saigon, Admiral Felt reminded 
Harkins that there had been no change in the relationship existing between 
CINCPAC and COMUSMACV/THAI. (53)

Not completely settled at the Hawaii conference, the command organiza-
tion in Thailand required subsequent discussion. In an action planned earlier, 
the US MAAG Laos was withdrawn on 6 October, and, on the following day, General 
Tucker assumed the title of Deputy Chief, JUSMAG, Thailand. (54) Immediately 
following the Secretary of Defense conference, Felt again expressed his desire 
that COMUSMACTBAI would not normally exercise anything more than a necessary 
coordination over PACAF and ARPAC forces in Thailand, which would be working 
there for support rather than combat purposes and could be appropriately 
controlled by CINCPACAF and CINCARPAC through their local agents -- the 2d 
Air Division and US Army Support Group "A". (55) After a meeting with 
Generals Harkins and Conway at Bangkok on 18 October, however, Admiral Felt 
agreed that Deputy COMUSMACTHAI would comprise two major divisions: (1) JUSMAG, 
and (2) Engineer, Communications, Planning, and Support Activities. He 
further agreed that operational control over Army support elements would be 
exercised by Deputy COMUSMACTHAI, who would be "the US voice in Thailand." 
When a joint table of distribution was being prepared for DEPCOMUSMACTHAI, 
Felt further agreed that planning for SEATO and CINCPAC exercises and war 
contingencies did not fit very well under support activities and approved 
three functional divisions: (1) JUSMAG, (2) Planning, and (3) Functional 
support groups. Admiral Felt's concession in regard to Army support forces 
did not apply to the 2d Air Division. "In other words," he messaged the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, "there is no change in current arrangement wherein 
one air force commander serves both SVN and Thailand." (56) 
After long existence as an anomalous organization described for political 
reasons as "2d Advon," the Pacific Air Force was permitted to discontinue this 
headquarters effective on 8.0ctober and to designate and organize the Head-
quarters, 2d Air Division, at Tan Son Nhut airfield with assignment to the 
Thirteenth Air Force.(57) Although the Air Force was not giving up its 
position that COMUSMACV/THAI required a high-ranking air officer as his deputy, 
General Anthis continued in command of the 2d Air Division at its establishment 
and was recognized as Air Force Component Commander, MACV/THAI. In a wrap up 
approval of the Southeast Asia command organization which had been worked out, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed on 10 November 1962 that operational control 
of all Air Force activities in Southeast Asia (except for MAAG functions 
which would remain under the MAAG Chief) would be exercised through a command 
channel running from CINCPAC to COMUSMACTHAI-COMUSMACV to Commander, 2d Air 
Division. The Commander, 2d Air Division, would be responsible to COMUSMACTHAI-
COMUSMACV for all operational matters with which the units of his command 
were concerned. CINCPACAF was responsible for administration and logistics 
of the 2d Air Division. (58) 
Coincidental with their approval of the reorganized US military organiza-
tion the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the return of Commander, Joint Task 
Force 116 to "designate" status. On 24 November, General Richardson began 
disestablishment of the task force. On this date, the advance party of the

1st Battle Group, 35th Infantry departed Thailand for return to Hawaii, and 
three days later Military Air Transport Service C-135s commenced redeploying 
the main body of the army battle group in an airlift completed on 4 December. 
The Air Operations Center at Don Muang was inactivated on 24 November, and 
the personnel returned to their home stations. On 5 December the Air Force 
Component Command at Don Muang was inactivated and General McElroy and his 
staff returned to their former duties. In September, the Army's Utility 
Transport Company had moved its armed HUlA helicopters to Vietnam, and in 
early December the 1st Aviation Company moved with its CV-2B Caribou light 
transport planes to Vietnam, bedding down at Vung Tau. With the departure 
of General Richardson on 8 December, JTF 116 was inactivated. (59) As agreed 
upon in the command reorganization, all USAF units in Thailand remained 
attached or assigned to the 6010th Tactical Group. On 8 December, the 6010th 
was assigned to the 2d Air Division, thus reuniting all Air Force units in 
Southeast Asia under a single commander. (60) 
The removal of Air Force tactical air units from Thailand -- although 
accepted as a planning objective -- proved difficult to accomplish without 
a reduction in needed capabilities or political repercussions. Using Don 
Muang Airfield as its forward operating base, the 15th Tactical Reconnaissance 
Squadron had assumed responsibility for operating the Able Mable air recon-
naissance task force on 23 May. This force flew photographic reconnaissance 
missions for JTF-116 and for other requesting agencies. In addition to a 
normal four RF-101 day photo aircraft, Able Mable used two RB-26s to fly 
50 night photography sorties over Laos between 29 May and 21 July, when the 
RE-26s were released at Don Muang and transferred to Bien Hoa Airfield in 
Vietnam. Representing an especially modified photo system for night use and 
improved low-level high-speed photo work, two "Toy Tiger" RF-101s were placed 
in operation at Don Muang between 2 July and 4 September. On nightmissions 
over Laos, the modified RF-101s got good results, but photoflash cartridge 
illumination required them to operate below 1,500 feet. This altitude was 
quite hazardous for high-speed navigation in mountainous terrain. Upon 
spotting a target, moreover, the pilot had to check 26 switches, dials, 
settings, and indicators, and to activate his cameras he had to use switches 
in two widely separated positions, While the Toy Tiger system was judged 
too hazardous for night operations, it was used extensively for day pin-
point photography before 7 September, when the Toy Tiger project was can-
celled and the modified aircraft were removed from Able Mable. (61) 
The agreements on Lao neutrality signed in Geneva on 23 July did not 
reduce the national and theater requirements for intelligence of continuing 
Communist activities in Laos, especially in the southeastern provinces 
flanking South Vietnam. Except for Able Mable, Admiral Felt had only meager 
intelligence collection capabilities in Laos. A continuation of Able Mable 
flights necessarily carried some element of risk since the Pathet Lao had 
demonstrated a mobile antiaircraft artillery capability, but both Ambassador

Young and General Richardson wanted Able Mable to continue to gather intelli-
gence from Laos as long as Washington did not forbid it. (62) For these 
reasons, Able Mable continued to operate in Laos, albeit with some circum-
spection. During a daily road reconnaissance over Route 7 on the morning 
of 14 August, Captain Thomas A. O'Meara spotted a convoy east of Phong Sayan 
and when he descended to 8,000 feet to get a photograph his RF-101 was hit 
by antiaircraft fire. O'Meara returned his badly damaged plane to a success-
ful crash landing at Don Muang, but the ground fire shot off his right forward 
camera access door with US markings on it. The Communists recovered the door 
and claimed a violation of Laotian neutrality. (63) 
Acting on instructions from Washington, CINCPAC suspended all Able Mable 
flights into Laos on 15 August, but he requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to 
permit a minimum of one reconnaissance flight a week at 8,000-foot altitudes 
qcross Pathet Lao strongholds to include Tchepone, Saravane, the Plaine des 
.1.17res, Sam Nreua, Ban Nam Bac, and Veng Vieng. (64) In -fiashington General 
-lor assured ?rE.,.,:ideht Kennedy that reconnaissance flights across Southern 
taos at attitudes of 35,000 feet would not be detected; moreover, such 
flights could be made in the course of movements of RF-101s from Bangkok to 
aigon. On 6 September, Able Mable was permitted to make flights through 
tans south. of 17030' north at altitudes not less than 35,000 feet, With 
notification for each such flight to be provided to CINCPAC 24-hours in 
advance. While visiting in Bangkok on 14 September General Taylor was visibly 
startled when told by General McElroy that the Able Mable Flights possibly 
could be tracked by North Vietnamese radar located south of Vinh. At Taylor's 
direction the flights were again suspended for a few days until PACAF intelli-
ence determined that hostile radar had only a marginal capability to detect 
-lrcraft c,verflying southern Laos and no ability to determine the type, 
nationality, or purpose of such a flight. (65) 
inc.7tuction to fly a: not less than 35, :0(..) feet, Able Mable 
was able to secure photographs of Communist activity in the Lao panhandle, but 
the effectiveness of the photography was reduced. After study at DOn Muang, 
General McElroy also pointed out that Communist radars could doubtless detect 
all flights over southern Laos at altitudes above 20,000 feet and flights 
lower than this could be visually identified. (66) In an effort to improve 
the scale of photography, CINCPAC requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to 
authorize Able Mable flights over southern Laos at altitudes of 20-25,000 
feat. On 27 September the Joint Chiefs authorized this altitude but now 
ruled that the RF-101 flights would remain south of the 15th parallel. (67) 
As Washington placed more and more of Laos off limits to aerial recon-
naissance, Able Mable found that 88 percent of its requests for photography 
received in October 1962 originated in South Vietnam and involved coverage 
of targets there. Located at Don Muang, the RF-101s had to make unnecessarily 
long flights to accomplish reconnaissance in South Vietnam. While a move of

Able Mable from Don Muang to Tan Son Nhut promised some possible political 
difficulties with the International Control Commission for Vietnam, the 
relocation of Able Mable in South Vietnam would be sensible from an opera-
tional viewpoint. For reasons of his awn, however, Admiral Felt resisted 
the move and even asked the US Ambassador. in Saigon to pose some objections 
to it. On 6 November, the Joint Chiefs of Staff nevertheless authorized 
the stationing of up to four RF-101s at Tan Son Nhut, provided they were 
rotated periodically to counter possible ICC queries. At the same time, 
the Joint Chiefs ordered a discontinuation of RF-101 flights over Laos except 
when prior authority was requested from and granted by them. Admiral Felt 
now proposed to station two RF-101s at Tan Son Nhut and leave two at Don Muang, 
but the Thirteenth Air Force demonstrated that such a split operation would 
be too costly to support. On 14 December the Able Mable air reconnaissance 
task force accordingly deployed from Don Muang to Tan Son Nhut. In the opera-
tions fram Thailand, Able Mable had turned in a splendid record of more than 
a thousand sorties, many over defended areas in Laos, without the loss of a 
single reconnaissance pilot. (68) 
For political reassurance to Thailand the Joint Chiefs of Staff were 
compelled to maintain a Tactical Air Command F-100 rotational squadron at 
Takhli for longer than a real military requirement existed for it. For its 
part, the Tactical Air Command was already committed to maintain a rotational 
F-100 squadron at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa from April 1962 to November 1963 
while PACAF s 18th Tactical Fighter Wing converted to F-105 aircraft, and 
the requirement for the additional rotational squadron at Takhli doubled the 
burden. In October 1962 at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, the 
Tactical Air Command made strenuous efforts to recover the squadrons at 
Kadena and Takhli, but despite this grave emergency the joint Chiefs would 
not permit redeployment. In another review of the Takhli requirement in 
November, the Joint Chiefs again found it valid. Therefore, the 522d 
Tactical Fighter Squadron deployed personnel by MATS airlift and relieved 
the 430th Squadron at Takhli on 15 December. (69) After prolonged negotiations 
between the Departments of State and Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were 
at last able to approve a reduction of the Takhli commitment from 18 to 6 
F-100s effective on 1 February 1963. On this date, the 4440th Aircraft 
Delivery Group (TAB) began a very laborious job of ferrying the "tired 
condition" F-100s from Takhli to the United States, and the 27th Tactical 
Fighter Wing established Detachment 1 at Takhli, comprising six F-100s and 
56 men (including eight pilots). Rotated every 60 days, the personnel of 
Detachment I was charged with the mission of providing a show of force, 
conducting air patrols along the Thailand border with Laos, and maintaining 
readiness for implementation of CINCPAC-USMACTHAI contingency plans in Laos. 
(70 At Don Muang the 405th Tactical Fighter Wing also continued a now semi-
permanent Bell Tone detachment, to which the 509th Fighter Interceptor 
Squadron rotated four F-102s with necessary personnel from Clark Air Base 
every two weeks. Attached to the 6010th Tactical Group, the Bell Tone F-102 
crews flew training missions with Thai controllers and F-86s, concurrently 
providing a continuing evidence of American interest in Thailand. (71)

2. The Geneva Neutralization of Laos and Its Aftermath  
Following the military debacle at Nam Tha and the US announcement that 
it had lost faith in Phoumi Nosavan, negotiations in Laos looking toward a . 
coalition government progressed rapidly. After meetings on the Plaine des 
Jarres, Souvanna Phouma announced on 11 June that Boun Gum and Souphanouvong 
had joined him in signing an agreement establishing a coalition cabinet. 
Souvanna Phouma was to be prime minister; Souphanouvong was to be one of 
the two deputy prime ministers and Phoumi would be the other. Souvanna 
would retain the key portfolio of defense to be given up by Fhoumi, and the 
latter would be minister of finance. Boun Oam would return to Savannakhet 
and retire from government. Of the 19 cabinet ministers, 11 were to be 
neutralists, four rightists, and four Pathet Lao. In the arrangement, either 
deputy prime minister was empowered to veto a decision at a cabinet meeting. 
72) In an exchange of notes on 12 June, Chairman Khrushchev and President 
:,hat the ormation of a government of national union under 
13ouvanna would make it possible for the Geneva Conference to push on toward 
71n international neutralization of Laos. (73) 
In a national television broadcast and a news conference early in July, 
Secretary Rusk emphasized that the agreement on Laos under renewed negotiation 
in Geneva would "clearly provide that Laos is not to be used as a channel of 
communication or pathway into neighboring countries...." This would be an 
obligation of the Lao Government, of the Soviet Union and Great Britain as 
co-chairmen. of the Geneva conference, and of the International Control Com-
mission for Laos. With the compulsory withdrawal of all foreign military 
personnel from Laos and the internationalization of aid for Laos, Rusk 
believed that infiltrated ,unblies would cease to flow out of Laos to 
neighboring countries. He pointed out that intelligence in South Vietnam 
reveal. whether the areement on Laos was being carried out; while the 
United States was going to approach the agreement with the expectation that 
all parties would carry out their commitments, he noted that if they did 
not "the agreement would become unhinged." (74) 
At Geneva, Quinin Pholsena, now representing Souvanna Phouma's new 
government, presented the fourteen nation conference with a declaration on 
the neutrality of Laos, which was incorporated into the final agreements, 
together with a conference declaration and a protocol signed by the delegates 
on 23 July. The signatories accepted the Lao government's statement of 
neutrality and further agreed that they would not commit or participate in 
impairments of Lao sovereignty, independence, neutrality, unity, or territorial 
integrity; would not resort to force, threats, or other measures that would 
impair peace in Laos; would refrain from all direct or indirect interference 
in Lao internal affairs; would not attach political conditions to their 
assistance to Laos would not bring Laos into military alliances or agreements; 
would respect the Lao wish not to be protected by alliances or coalitions, 
including SEATO; would not introduce foreign troops or military personnel 
into Laos would not establish any foreign military base or installation of

any kind in Laos; would not use Lao territory for interference in the internal 
affairs of other countries; and would not use the territory of other countries 
for interference in Lao internal affairs. The protocol recognized the Inter-
national Control Commission for Laos and provided that it would act unanimously 
on matters regarding foreign forces in Laos but by majority vote on other 
matters, including procedural questions." All foreign military personnel were 
to be withdrawn from Laos under the supervision of the ICC and, except for 
French military instructors in limited number and for a limited time, the 
introduction of foreign military personnel into Laos was prohibited. It 
further provided: "The introduction into Laos of armaments, munitions and 
war material generally, except such quantities of conventional armaments as 
the Royal Government of Laos may consider necessary for the national defense 
of Laos, is prohibited." (75) 
In order to get the agreements on Laos, the United States made sub-
stantial concessions, including the acceptance of the Soviet nominee --
Souvanna Phouma -- to be the prime minister. (76) President Kennedy expressed 
optimisn on 23 July that international problems could be settled by patient 
diplomacy, and a joint statement issued by Kennedy and Souvanna Phouma on 
31 July confirmed Souvanna's determination to perfect independence, unity, 
and neutrality and Kennedy's willingness to support the efforts. (77) 
Handled as US executive agreements, the Geneva declaration did not require 
Senate confirmation, but Assistant Secretary Harriman defended it as consonant 
with US policy objectives. Harriman candidly admitted that except for the 
fact that the Soviets had made it plain that they would be responsible for 
Communist bloc adherence to the agreements he would have very little confidence 
in the accords. "It is hard to see," he added, "what Mr. KhrushChev gains in 
personal reputation if he fails to carry out his agreement with President 
Kennedy and his agreement as signed in Geneva." In a letter to Congressman 
Melvin R. Laird, Harriman reiterated the same thought that the Soviet Union 
had agreed to be "responsible to see that the Communist countries, particularly 
Communist China and North Vietnam, live up to the agreements." Harriman was 
additionally confident that the ICC was more powerful than before and could 
plan an effective role in reports to Great Britain and the Soviet Union on 
possible violations to the agreements. (78) In an address in Chicago on 
18 September Roger Hilsman expressed confidence that if the North Vietnamese 
did not honor the Geneva agreement on Laos but continued to infilter men 
through Laos that it would still be possible for the South Vietnamese to 
interdict the infiltration routes, especially by the use of armed Montagnard 
tribesmen. In retrospect, Hilsman believed that the Geneva agreement was 
advantageous to the United States since the North Vietnamese would have to 
keep their use of Laotian infiltration routes "down to a guerrilla warfare 
level." (79) 
After having suspended its monetary support to the Boun Oum government 
for five months at the beginning of 1962, the United States made an interim 
cash grant payment to the Boun Oum Government at the end of June and another

to Souvanna Pouma's government in July immediately before the Geneva agree-
ment was signed. (ao) In regard to military assistance to the Royal Lao 
vvernment after neutralization, Assistant Secretary Harriman stated that 
US policy envisioned continued and very important assistance to the coalition 
Twernment in implementing an orderly demobilization of the Laotian military 
forces, thus determining that the Royal Lao forces were not demobilized more 
rapidly than the Pathet Lao. (81) The manner in which US military assistance 
that might be requested by the Lao government would be administered presented 
3rme difficulty, since the US MAAG would be withdrawn. Arriving in Vientiane 
to July, Leonard Unger, a career diplomat who had just spent four years in 
3angkok, part of the time as deputy chief of mission, became the US Ambassador 
to Laos. In order to handle US military assistance after withdrawal of MAAF 
personnel to Bangkok, Secretary McNamara proposed that additional military 
attache strength be added in Vientiane to provide assistance to the US 
ierations Mission in its undertaking of any MAAG function. This had not 
7,)rk(i well in the past since military attache duty was of an intelligence 
:1-re: consequently, Admiral Felt got acceptance of the augmentation of US 
tU with 25 capable individuals who would handle MAP matters in Vientiane in 
-;00peration with General Tucker's nonresident MAAG Laos in Bangkok. Under 
this arrangement US personnel would be available to process and coordinate 
7.1A.P equipment requirements, but no American military advisors would be 
q7ailable for service with Laotian army and air force units. (82) 
According to 1961 MAP projections Laos was scheduled to receive 14 T-28 
Nomad aircraft not later than 30 June 1962, but political considerations 
affected this and other Lao air assistance programs. With only five T-6s 
remaining in operation in March 1962, General Phoumi asked for three replace-
;nt planes of this type. The planes were available in storage in Thailand, 
rn 22 March the US State Department asked that no action be taken to 
--place the damaged planes in order to avoid encouragement to Phoumi. In 
727der to expedite Lao trainel.rg in the T-28s, three of these aircraft were 
diverted to Thailand from a shipment to South Vietnam, and a training program 
was completed on 22 August when 12 Lao pilots, 16 Lao mechanics, 16 civilian 
contract mechanics, and 16 RTAF mechanics had been trained. On 27 April, 
Iowever, the Office of Secretary of Defense directed that the T-28s would 
not be delivered to Laos, and on 14 August CINCPAC directed that four of the 
planes already enroute would be delivered to Thailand and the remainder 
stored in the United States tentatively earmarked for Laos. In October, 
the 14 stored planes were committed to South Vietnam. (83) 
During his visit to Washington in late July 1962, Souvanna Phouma 
revealed tentative plans to reduce the size of the Royal Lao Ar (FAR), 
the Pathet Lao, and the Neutralist forces and to create a new neutral Lao 
Army with a strength of something like 25,000 men, with each of the factions 
providing about a third of the strength. This planning objective was subse-
quently revised to provide a permanent Lao army of 30,000 and a police force 
of 6,000, both to be manned in equal increments from the Phoumist forces (FAR)

the Pathet Lao, and the Kong Le Neutralists. (84) After a cabinet meeting 
in Vientiane, Prince Souphanouvong announced on 6 August that the Lao 
coalition government would continue all previous aid agreements that were 
not prohibited by the Geneva protocol. (85) Thus the Soviets could continue . 
to supply the Kong Le Neutralists and the Pathet Lao. Believing that the 
United States should continue to support the FAR until it was merged into 
a neutral Laotian government force, Admiral Felt proposed on 18 August that 
unless otherwise directed he would consider only austere FAR training require-
ments for vehicles, weapons, aircraft, and organizational equipment and did 
not intend to replace combat losses of equipment. He would, however, continue 
to provide POL, spare parts, commercial consumables, clothing, and small 
closely-controlled shipments of ammunition to the FAR, all in quantities 
required for continued training. Felt also proposed to provide POL and spare 
parts for Air America and construction material for civic action projects 
approved by Ambassador Unger. In the latter case, Felt was very anxious 
that ths civic action program among the Kha people of the Bolovens area 
proceed without interruption. (86) Fe recommended that a selected number 
of the Kha be used to man an intellience and warning network along the 
Ho Chi Minh trail through southeastern Laos, to be prepared to receive South 
Vietnamese commando or ranger troops, and to serve as potential evasion and 
escape teams. (87) 
In accordance with International Control Commission procedures, all 
foreign military forces weretobe withdrawn from Laos through established 
checkpoints before 7 October. At Adthiral Felt's direction, Thai volunteers 
who were serving with the MAAG in Laos were not assembled for withdrawal 
but were returned to Thailand as quietly as they had been introduced into 
Laos. (88) In regard to the. American withdrawal, however, Felt instructed 
General Tucker to delay the removal until the last practicable time and 
then insure a maximum exposure. "I want final departure of personnel," 
Felt instructed, "to be of significant size with flags flying and tails 
over the dashboard." (89) On 6 October, the last group of MAAG personnel, 
including General Tucker, passed through the ICC checkpoint. Altogether the 
United States withdrew 193 officers, L1.70 enlisted men, and 3 civilians from 
Laos for a total of 666 persons. About 400 Filipino advisors who had been 
repairing equipment and handling supplies in Laos were also checked out. (90) 
On the day that he closed the MAAG in Vientiane, General Tucker explained 
to General Fhoumi the guidelines that Admiral Felt had provided for future 
FAR supply, which would be adhered to. Under this program, continuing US 
MAP would amount to supplies valued at about $268,000 a month -- this being 
the total for October 1962. (91) In order to provide supplies to the ethnic 
hill peoples of Laos whose regular livelihood had been disrupted by war, 
representatives of the United States and of the Souvanna Phouma government 
signed a formal agreement on 7 October whereby Air America planes and crews 
would operate in support of the Royal Government with US AID funding. (92)

In an expectation that good faith on the part of Chairman Khrushchev 
and the Soviet Union, President Kennedy had hoped that a genuine political 
settlement could be reached in Laos, but Secretary Rusk would remember 
that President Kennedy was ifbitterly disappointed" with the Communist 
adherence to the Geneva accords. (93) At the time of the Laos ceasefire 
there were known to be about 10,000 North Vietnamese troops in Laos, of wham 
only 40 checked out through the inspection sites that the Communists permitted 
the ICC to set up on the Plaine des jarres and at Nam Ping in Khammouane 
Province. Some of the North Vietnmese troops infiltered into South Vietnam, 
since 1,000-1,800 Cunaunist Vietnamese were reported to have moved out of 
Laos into South Vietnam in a sudden spurt of activity between I May and 15 
June 1962, but in January 1963 General Tucker was convinced that 8,000 
Vietminh troops were still in Laos, acting both in battalion-sized units 
and as cadres for the Pathet Lao forces. (9)4) At the first evidence that 
Hanoi was going to perpetnfe a massive violation of the Geneva agreement, 
British diplomats wanted to insist on a strict observance of the Geneva 
c,Alference intentions with !-spect to the International Control Commission, 
but the United States hesitaed to make a disturbance that might prevent 
Couvanna Phouma from getting the coalition government firmly established, 
rationalized that the ICC would be inadequate to the task of finding Vietminh 
troops in the jungle, and believed that Vietminh "guerrilla" infiltration 
could be successfully met in the Mekong Lowlands or the South Vietnamese 
Highlands. As a matter of fact, the Pathet Lao generally forbade the ICC 
from entering areas held by their forces, and on other occasions allowed 
ICC investigations only at sites that were clearly sanitized for inspection. 
(95) 
In an assessment of Communist activities in Southeast Asia presented 
at a PACAF Commanders Conference on 4 April 1962, Maj. W. J. Phillips, a 
PACAF intelligence staff officer, called attention to a prevalent belief 
that the battles in Laos were being fought by small guerrilla bands who waged 
elusive and fleeting attacks. On the contrary, Phillips pointed out that 
from the time of Kong Le's revolt onward, the Soviets had utilized airlift 
in a well-planned, sustained, and fairly massive logistical effort from 
Hanoi into Laos. By virtue of initial Soviet airlift support followed up 
by road construction effort, the Vietminh/Pathet Lao/Kong Le forces had been 
able to consolidate their control over virtually all of Laos except the 
Mekong River Valley. Phillips described the Communist activity at Tchepone, 
which the Vietminh clearly wanted as a base for use against South Vietnam, 
as a classic example of the use of airlift in support of a ground campaign 
in a region with initially limited surface communications. Hard after 
Vietminh/Pathet Lao troops captured Tchepone, Soviet 11-14 aircraft began 
operating into the new airhead. Then road construction outward from Tchepone 
began, and truck convoys took over the movement of men and supplies as soon 
as surface communications were built or improved. Looking backward, Phillips 
noted that less than a handful of World War Il fighter aircraft offensively 
employed in Laos could have disrupted the Communist campaign. Looking forward, 
he predicted that under an impotent neutral government, Laos would continue

to be "the principal, open supply artery to enemy forces in South Vietnam." 
(96) North Vietnam had already begun a substantial road improvement program 
in Laos during the cease-fire, and both North Vietnam and Communist China 
lent economic assistance to the Souvanna Phouma government in the form of 
road construction. The Vietnamese made substantial improvements on the 
routes through the Annamite Mountains between North Vietnam and Laos. The 
Chinese built roads across their Yunnan border into Phong Saly Province. (97) 
Even though the removal of the MAAG from Vientiane reduced the amount of 
information about North Vietnamese infiltration through Laos, PACAF never-
theless estimated in October 1962 that: The failure of the Vietnamese 
troops to make any significant withdrawal from Laos, and the continued refusal 
of the Pathet Lao to permit members of the coalition government to travel to 
areas under Communist control, leaves little doubt that the Communist fully 
intend to continue to use Southeastern Laos to infiltrate troops into South 
Vietnam." (98) 
Lacking real power other than the prestige of having been picked to 
head the Laotian troika government, Souvanna Phouma was unable to secure 
cooperation from either the Communists ar the conservatives. Where the 
Pathet Lao forces had earlier supported Souvanna, only Kong Le's military 
force now remained directly loyal to him. Plans to reform all elements into 
a single neutral Lao army made no progress, and the three military forces 
continued to occupy positions that they had been holding. Still effectively 
in control of the Royal Lao Army (FAR), Phoumi Nosavan was inclined to carry 
out the wishes of Ambassador Unger. While Phoumi talked of demobilization 
plans, he actually demobilized only a few ineffective units and continued 
to maintain a strength of same %,000 men with American supply support. 
Kong Le claimed to command 6,000 troops, but his Neutralist forces (now 
sometimes called "Centrists") were divided between Vang Vieng and the Plaine 
des Jarres. Altogether, the Pathet Lao were estimated to have 9,000 troops 
with a heavy concentration virtually surrounding Kong Le's garrison on the 
Plaine des Jarres. (99) Kong Le was supported by Soviet supplies, and the 
Pathet Lao drew support both from the Soviet Union and North Vietnam. In 
September 1962, however, Kong Le found his support on the Plaine des Jarres 
drying up due to Pathet Lao diversions and also discovered that the Pathet 
Lao were making efforts to alienate same of his subordinate commanders. In 
the first week of October, Souvanna Phouma suddenly requested that both 
American and Soviet planes would be used to airlift supplies to isolated 
pockets of Kong Le troops. (100) 
Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma's request for American airlift in support 
of General Kong Le's forces surprised Western observers, but Ambassador Unger 
authorized Air America aircraft to be used for the purpose. Later in October, 
however, US AID Laos requested General Tucker to provide supplies -- including 
clothing, personal equipment, and mosquito netting -- for Kong Le's forces. 
While Tucker had the ability to provide supplies for the Neutralists out of 
FAR MAP commitments, Admiral Felt frankly questioned whether it would be

sound to support Kong Le forces until the United States had same assurance 
that they would not again be hostile. At the most, he proposed to restrict, 
supplies to the Neutralists to health and comfort items such as blankets, 
tentage, and medicines and requested guidance from Washington. (101) 
The Soviet Union also gave outward appearance of being taken by surprise 
by a decision obviously made in Hanoi to strangle the Kong Le Neutralists. 
When the Soviet Embassy received Souvanna Phouma's request, it immediately 
promised him use of the Soviet transport planes flying out of Hanoi. The 
promised planes, however, were not available for same time. While the 
Soviets were evidently considering policy, the Soviets suffered a serious 
defeat when they attempted to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba and 
they were additionally concerned about the Chinese Communist invasion of 
India's borders. During the Geneva negotiations of 1961-1962, the Soviets 
and the Chinese Communists had displayed a degree of solidarity, but the 
events of October 1962 broadened the Sino-Soviet schism. (102) As President 
Kennedy would point out, the Soviets were in a position to exercise control 
over Communist activities in Laos as long as the supply lines were being 
maintained by Soviet airlift. (103) Now, however, Hanoi wanted to isolate 
Kong Le and get on with the civil war in Laos and the subjugation of South 
Vietnam; in the yawning Sino-Soviet schism, Hanoi was in a position to in-
crease its demands upon both the Soviets and Red China. In order to 
extricate themselves fram an embarrassing situation, the Soviets delivered 
the first of a consignment of nine LI-2 (Russian version of the DC-3) air-
craft to Vientiane on 2 December. Russian crews accompanied the planes to 
operate them until Lao crews could be trained, and the Soviets stressed 
that three of the planes would be for the Neutralists, three for the Pathet 
Lao, and three for the FAR. At this same time, the Soviets turned over to 
North Vietnam the IL-14 aircraft that the Russians had been operating in 
Southeast Asia since December 1960. The Vietminh were accordingly expected 
to provide supplies to the Pathet Lao, principally over the improved roads 
into Laos from North Vietnam. (104) 
The Communists were determined to isolate the Kong Le Neutralists, and 
they had been making some progress in subverting one of Kong Le's subordinates, 
Col. Deaune Souvannarath, who would soon announce himself as head of the 
"True Neutralist Forces." On 27 November, Deaune's men shot down an Air 
America C-123 while it was landing at an airstrip on the Plaine des Jarres, 
killing the US crewmen. Kong Le's efforts to arrest Deaune's gunners were 
frustrated by the Pathet Lao, who asserted that Air America was a para-
military organization that was being used by the United States to drop arms 
and ammunition inside Laos. Assistant Secretary Harriman reasoned that this 
was a clear test case of US determination as well as a defiance of the 
Souvanna Phouma government, in whose service Air America was operating. 
Admiral Felt suggested that F-100s of the 430 Tactical Fighter Squadron 
from Takhali could be used to escort Air America planes. (105) At the 
instigation of the Polish member, however, the ICC took note of the Pathet

Lao charge that Air America was a paramilitary organization forbidden by-
the Geneva agreement and asked Souvanna Phouma for an investigation. In 
discussions with Ambassador Unger, Souvanna pointed out that the Soviets 
had given transport aircraft to him and that it would be possible for the 
United States to do the same, thus permitting the contract support to be 
phased out as soon as possible. When his opinion was requested, Admiral 
Felt demonstrated that the United States would lose its ability to insure 
that the Meo tribesmen would continue to receive supplies if the US Aid 
contracts with Air America and Bird et Son (this being a newly-negotiated air 
service contract with an American firm operating in Thailand) were phased out. 
In January 1963, Ambassador Unger secured acceptance of a compromise whereby 
the United States would give two C-46 transports to the Laotian government 
and the contract air services would continue to operate. Unger indicated 
that he would accept distinctive markings to show the humanitarian aspect of 
the Air America Planes and allow representatives of the ICC or the three 
Laotian factions to accompany supply-drop flights. As the matter wound up, 
Souvanna Phouma still held to an oblective of phasing Air America out of 
Laos over a period of time, but, in the meanwhile, he did not make a reply 
to the ICC request for an investigation. (106) 
Souvanna Phouma's indecisive handling of the Air America incident 
revealed the essential weakness of his position. Kong Le's Neutralists 
were the only military forces directly loyal to Souvanna, and, as General 
Tucker pointed out in a military assessment on 12 January, Kong Le's troops 
on the Plaine des Jarres were so surrounded by the Pathet Lao as to place 
Kong Le in a position of "talking from the jail-house." If a conflict 
began, Tucker did not believe that Kong Le's forces could escape from the 
Plaine des Jarres with anything but their small arms. (107) Under the 
circumstances, Souvanna Phouma began to compromise his Neutralist position 
by moving closer to General Phoumi and the United States. In a strange turn 
of events, Roger Hilsman and Michael Forrestal, both visiting in the Far 
East at President Kennedy's direction, flew to the Plaine des Jarres in one 
of the Russian aircraft early in January 1963 to talk with Kong Le. The 
Neutralist commander claimed to have the Plaine des Jarres under control, 
though he said he knew the Pathet Lao were out to get him. In case of a 
Pathet Lao attack, Kong Le estimated he could hold out for a week. He had 
a great amount of Soviet equipment, but some of it was inoperable and he 
was short of POL. Kong Le also remarked that the morale of Air America 
crews had declined since the loss of the C-123. Back in Vientiane, Ambassador 
Unger in concurrence with Hilaman and Forrestal recammended that the United 
States should begin to support Kong Le. The State Department promptly 
approved the recommendation on 14 January, despite an expression of mis-
giving from Admiral Felt who cited General Tucker's appraisal of Kong Le's 
vulnerability and hoped that the MAP "would not be used as a grab bag." 
Admiral Felt did not want to divert support from the FAR in order to 
bulwark Kong Le's vulnerable forces. A joint State/Defense directive 
issued on 20 February nevertheless provided that the Kong Le forces would 
be given the MAP equipment they needed, including ammunition, if they were 
attacked by the Pathet Lao. (108)

In an effort to secure support for the neutralization of Laos, King 
SavangVatthanaand Souvanna Phouma left Laos on 11 February for a six-week 
tour of the signatory countries of the Geneva protocol. On the following 
evening at his home at Phong Sayan on the Plaine des Jarres, Col. Ketsana 
Vongsouvanah, one of Kong Lets key neutralists who had resisted Cammunist 
subversion, was assassinated. American and Lao officials suspected that 
the murder had been arranged by the leftist Lao foreign minister, Quinim 
Pholsena. (109) Heartened by the beginning of a receipt of American 
consumable supplies at the end of February, Kong Le began to eliminate some 
of the dissidents from his forces. Upon his return to Vientiane in the 
latter part of March, Souvanna Phouma acted through intermediaries to get 
an assurance that General Phoumi would aid Kong Le in a joint defense of 
the Plaine des Jarres, and he approved Kong Le's arrest of several of the 
pro-Cammunists in his ranks. (110) In the last week of March, Colonel 
Deuan's dissidents began to fire on Kong Les positions, and on 31 March 
the Pathet Lao joined the sporadic fighting. Adding more fuel to the 
renewed flames, Quinim Fholsena was machine-gunned and killed by one of 
his personal guards. The guard later said that the foreign minister had 
been plotting with the Chinese Communists to overthrow Souvanna Phouma, 
but a statement signed by Deputy Premier Souphanouvong and broadcast over 
a Pathet Lao radio station asserted that the United States was responsible 
for the murder of Quinim. (111) 
Early in April, Kong Le managed a relatively orderly withdrawal of 
small bodies of his troops from exposed positions in Khang Khay, Xieng 
Khouang, and Ban Ban, concentrating in the western third of the Plaine des 
Jarres. He established his command post at Muong Phanh, three miles west 
of the Plaine des Jarres airfield. On 8 April, Souvanna Phouma requested 
the ICC to send a ceasefire team to the combat area, a motion resisted by 
both the Polish Commissioner and Souphanouvong who claimed that the fight 
was between factions in Kong Le's forces. Led by Souphanouvong, who flew 
to Khang Khay on 17 April, Pathet Lao officials began to leave Vientiane, 
alleging that security precautions were inadequate to protect them. On the 
morring of 18 April, a Pathet Lao-Dissident attack shelled the Plaine des' 
Jarres airfield out of operation and forced Kong Le farther westward, but 
he continued to hold a dirt landing strip at Muong Phanh. The US Argy 
attache reported that the attack was so seriously waged that Kong Le would 
be expelled from the Plaine des Jarres unless he received assistance. 
Following a meeting with Kong Le in Vientaine on 22 April, Phoumi used 
RLAF planes to fly two battalions of FAR troops to the Plaine des Jarres, 
and on 23-24 April the United States made a first airlift of machine guns 
and infantry weapons to Kong Le. With the arrival of Indian and Canadian 
ICC representatives (the Polish members would not participate) a ceasefire 
quieted the hostilities for the moment, but Kong Le had nevertheless lost 
most of his outposts on the Plaine des Jarres. (112)

In the evolution of American policy toward the April crisis in Laos, 
the US State Department issued a statement on 8 April which noted the Kong Le 
Neutralists were under attack by Pathet Lao supported by Vietminh military 
forces and called upon Great Britain and the Soviet Union to stop the 
fighting. On the same day in Paris where he was attending a SEATO Council 
of Ministers meeting, Secretary Rusk noted that the United States fully 
supported the Geneva agreement and asked the ICC be accorded access to Pathet 
Lao areas which had not been opened to its inspection. Enroute to Europe 
and to Moscow for discussions of Laos, UnderSecretary of State Harriman told 
a television interviewer on 14 April that President Kennedy had decided that 
the United States must not became involved in Laos. He stated that there 
were no plans to commit US troops and that military supplies would be sent 
only if requested by the Lao government. (113) At the diplomatic level there 
was hope that the Soviet Union, as a co-chairman of the Geneva Conference, 
would take steps to end the crisis, but on 22 April Pravda echoed Chinese 
Communist charges that the United States was to blame for the tension in Laos. 
After a three-hour meeting with Khrushchev on 26 April, Harriman announced 
that the Soviet Union joined the United States in its support of the 1962 
agreement on Laos. Privately, however, Harriman reported that Khrushchev 
said that he was bored by the subject and asked irritably why Washington 
bothered so much about Laos. (114) 
In an appearance before a Congressional Committee, Roger Hilsman, who 
had became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, implied on 
14 May that the United States was waiting to see whether Khrushchev was going 
to live up to his commitments on Laos. "Our policy in Laos," Tinsman said, 
"is to pursue the Geneva Agreements to the bitter end.... If we pursue the 
Geneva accords to the end we still have all the options we had a year ago." 
(115) During May and June Great Britain pressed the Soviet Union to ensure 
that the Left-Wing party in Laos respected the Geneva settlement, but nothing 
was accomplished. By 19 June, a joint State-Defense analysis of the Lao 
situation recognized that both Moscow and Peiping, in view of their dispute 
over Communist strategy, were going to compete with each other to support 
the Pathet Lao erosion attacks in Laos. Both regimes would hope steadily 
to improve Communist positions without arousing free world counteraction. (116) 
The task of devising a new United States policy on Laos required exami-
nation of many options and the collection of estimates and opinions in South-
east Asia, Hawaii, and Washington. Both in Paris when he was attending the 
SEATO Council meeting and later in Bangkok on 23 April, when he met with the 
SEATO Military Advisors, Admiral Felt discussed the prospect of accelerating 
an already-scheduled SEATO exercise, thus placing SEATO forces in Thailand 
at a time that might influence Communist activities in Laos. The SEATO 
allies were unenthusiastic, but Felt nevertheless maneuvered Seventh Fleet 
units off the coast of South Vietnam. (117) After returning to Bangkok from

Paris, SEATO Secretary General Pote Sarasin sought out Ambassador Young 
and attempted to impress upon him that an Asian's view of Laos was evidently 
different from that of a Westerner. Pote explained that SEATO shows of force 
in Thailand might impress the Russians but would have little effect on the 
Pathet Lao and Vietminh. He compared the Pathet Lao/Vietminh with mice 
eating away at the foundations of the free position in Laos. He said that 
to try to stop the nibbling by deploying the Seventh Fleet was "quite like 
trying to shoot mice with cannon." In an Asian s opinion, Pote urged that 
actions would have to be undertaken inside Laos to strengthen and assist 
Souvanna Phouma. A few days latter, Marshal Sarit told Young that Thailand 
was waiting for the United States to give leadership and take actions inside 
Laos to stop Pathet Lao and Vietminh encroachments, to support Souvanna, and 
to restore the territory from which Kong Le had been driven. (118) 
In assessments as early as January 1963, General Tucker had been 
very pessimistic about the military prospects in Laos and had suggested that 
the best that the United States colJd hope for was a partitioned country. 
He was convinced that the "Director'3 of the Hammer and Sickle forces" could 
take over all of Laos within two wcek3 if they wanted. They had not done so 
because this would arouse the United Aates, saddle the Reds "with the care 
and feeding of all the Laotian people who live in the Mekong River cities," 
and would not contribute to the advantageous position that the Communists 
already occupied. The Communists already controlled eastern Laos and the 
important system of Ho Chi Minh trails leading into South Vietnam. (119) 
In March the Red Prince Souohanouvong voiced a proposal that it might be well 
for Laos to be partitioned into Communist and non-Communist areas along 
existing lines. At this time the State DepartMent did not like the proposal 
because it would involve the loss of the enclaves in Communist territory 
held by Kong Le, but it asked Admiral Felt whether Phoumi!s FAR forces would 
be able to restore government control over southeastern Laos prior to a 
partition agreement. Both Admiral Felt and General Tucker replied that the 
Communists would make a strong fight to hold Tchepone and the Ho Chi Minh 
trail complex -- areas which the FAR was unable to hold in 1961-1962 and 
which it probably could not reconquer. (120) In April and May, both President 
Diem and Marshal Sarit believed that Communist activities on the Plaine des 
Jarres were designed to cover Vietminh buildups in southeastern Laos and were 
more than a little interested in rumors that Laos might be partitioned. Diem 
was not adverse to a partition plan that would end the futile attempt to 
give substance to the Geneva accords, but Sarit rejected partition completely 
since it would be preliminary to a Communist takeover of all of Laos. Sarit 
believed that the Communists wanted Laos only because it was an avenue of 
approach to Vietnam, Thailand, and Singapore. (121) In a summarization of 
the partition option, the State Department ruled out this option since the 
Reds would have nothing to lose by it, the Neutralists would be squeezed out, 
and because it would be more difficult to support the Meo in areas behind 
Communist lines. (122)

'3ECRET 
In undertaking to provide Kong Le s Neutralists with American weapons 
to replace the Soviet equipment which they held, Secretary Rusk instructed 
Ambassador Unger on 23 April that the United States was confronting a diffi-
cult situation. Rusk did not want to encourage Phoumi Nosovan and Kong Le 
to a point where they would undertake a foolish military move and be defeated. 
At this same time, Rusk did not believe that Kong Le should be discouraged 
from some offensive actions, since the United States had long urged Souvanna 
Phouma to be more resolute against the Communists. (123) American fears that 
the old Neutralist, Souvanna Phouma, might not be resolute enough.to deal 
with the Communists or might be alienated from the Souvanna-Kong Le-Phoumi 
coalition began to be dispelled in early May. Although Ambassador Unger found 
Souvanna notably discouraged, Souvanna now recognized that Souphanouvong had 
completely gone over to the Vietminh and that the Pathet Lao wanted war rather 
than peaceful negotiations. (124) In continuing harmony, Phoumi provided kip 
funds for paying Kong Le's Neutralists troops. Phoumi also pointed out that 
the Neutralist forces lacked staff teaining and cooperated in the establish-
ment of a Neutralist general staff neadquarters in Vientiane. (125) 
Despite these favorable developments, American military assistance 
policy continued to be circumscribed by a determination to avoid violation of 
the Geneva agreements and by a persuasive fear that General Phoumi might 
generate a situation which would lead to a severe defeat for the FAR. Even 
though ICC Chairman Avtar Singh told Ambassador Unger that it was important 
that Kong Le not be driven from the Plaine des Jarres, Unger was reminded: 
lath respect augmenting Armed Forces memory of Nam Tha debacle made one 
think that was not the answer." (126) In order to increase the capabilities 
of the FAR, General Phoumi asked the US AID Director on 22 April for in-
creased financial assistance for the Lao military and also for six of the 
T-28 aircraft which had been earlier scheduled for Laos but had been diverted 
to other recipients. (127) Souvanna Phouma agreed that the T-28's would be 
needed and recommended that they be moved to Savannakhet. (128) On 4 June, 
Prime Minister Sarit agreed to make a gift of six Thai T-28s to Phoumi, 
and the US JUSMAG in Bangkok promptly initiated arrangements whereby the 
RTAF would provide refresher training to 12 Lao pilots and 16 Lao mechanics 
that had received T-28 training in 1962. The Thais approved the arrange-
ments and waited for the Lao government and the American Embassy in Vientiane 
to implement them. (129) In Hawaii, Admiral Felt was enthusiastic about the 
prospect that the "wraps" might be removed from the Lao Air Force. He 
forwarded a list of prospective air targets appropriate for General Phoumi 
to strike with his T-6 aircraft (and perhaps the T-28s) if the situation 
developed and requested the Joint Chiefs of Staff to authorize a USAF 
colonel or lieutenant colonel to serve as an air attache with the RLAF 
Commander, Colonel Ma, at Savannakhet. (130) Ambassador Unger questioned 
Phoumi on his proposed use of the T-28s, but he took the occasion to tell 
Phoumi that he hoped it was not going to be necessary to introduce any T-28s 
into Laos, since this would represent a rather large escalation of the 
conflict. (131) On the same day, Unger warned Secretary Rusk that Lao forces 
simply did not have a will and capacity to fight the Vietminh no matter how 
well equipped, trained, or advised they might be. (132)

As a result of habesseJior Unger's admonition, the matter of air rein-
forcements for Laos would be held up. In the meanwhile, the RLAF got an 
opportunity to demonstrate !_ts mettle with its old T-6s, only three of which 
could be counted combat capable. These old planes lacked instruments, had 
no operational radios or gun sights, and were armed only with 30-caliber 
wing guns and 5-inch rockets. (133) The opportunity came in southeastern  
Laos where in April and May. US Aid field representatives 
the Pathet Lao and Vietminh were on the move toward the 
FAR-garrisoned towns of Attopeu and possibly Saravene. (134) Purely as a 
precaution, since the use of heavy munitions would have to be approved by 
higher authority, Admiral Felt got permission in May to earmark a stock of 
100-pound general purpose and frag bombs in Thailand for possible employment 
on Lao T-6s in an emergency either on the Plaine des Jarres or in southeastern 
Laos. (135) In early June when two battalions of Pathet Lao and three battal-
ions of Vietminh forces were reported to be concentrating around Attopeu, 
Colonel Ma sent his three aeilable T-6s to the airfield at Pakse. The T-6s 
flew daily rocket sort:Lee e-Lnst hostile positions and supply points around 
Attopeu. The attacks were eaaluated as effective 
against the enemy. Since he lacked artillery, the FAR commander of the 
southeastern military region was willing to state that Attopeu would have 
been lost without the T-6 attacks. In a message from Washington on 2 July, 
the State and Defense Departments indicated they would be willing to autho-
rize the use of bombs to prevent a communist capture of Attopeu, but by 
this time the US Acting Chief of Mission in Vientiane (in the absence of 
Unger) could message that the situation at Attopeu was greatly improved. 
At this time, however, the Embassy requested that arrangements would be 
facilitated -- regardless of opposition -- for the movement of T-28s into 
Laos if the situation worsened at Attopeu. (136) On this same day, three 
T-6s hit a lathet Lac ricamgent during a lunch-siesta period; FAR ground 
troops moved in behind the strike to count 32 PL/VM dead and easily routed 
the remainder of the 'zed enemy soldiers. (137) 
During the June crisis around Attopeu, US State and Defense planners 
were working on a study of proposed courses of action to stabilize the situation 
in Laos for presentation to President Kennedy. Ready for circulation on 
19 June, the draft State-Defense paper recognized that the root of the problem 
in Southeast Asia was the aggressive effort of the North Vietnamese to 
establish Communist control in Laos and South Vietnam as a stepping stone 
to control all of Southeast Asia. The paper proposed that the United States 
should continue to respect Lao neutralization but should nevertheless begin 
to effect a program of graa'aated increases of political and military pressure 
that would provide stabilization of the situation in Laos without setting 
in motion an irreversible pattern of US commitment. The planners proposed 
three escalating phases of political and military activity: Phase I, with 
the objective of securing a reconstitution of the Lao coalition government 
and the Geneva agreemens; Phase II, with the same objective but with a 
decided increase in the miRtary effort in Laos including same measures within

the Geneva framework; Phase III, with the objective of achieving a "hard" 
partition of Laos that would insure a friendly control of the Laotian pan-
handle, the Mekong lowlnads, and, if possible, a foothold on the Plaine des 
Jarres. The military measures. proposed. for the three phases included: I, 
the use of non-US forces that could be supported with some stretching of 
the Geneva accords; II, the non-combatant use of US forces; and III, the 
combat use of US forces in Laos. In their review of the State-Defense study, 
the Joint Chiefs welcomed the intent to pursue positive actions rather than 
to react to Communist initiatives, but in Phase III they preferred to apply 
direct military pressure against North Vietnam instead of committing US 
forces to ground action in Laos. (138) In his submission of requested 
comments on the State-Defense paper, Admiral Felt believed that the situation 
in Laos demanded earlier and more dramatic actions than would be possible 
under the gradually escalating concept of actions outlined in Washington, 
many of which would require coordination with the SEATO allies. In his 
recommendation, Felt proposed six sequential "packages" of actions each to 
contain diverse but related undertakings that could proceed simultaneously, 
thus avoiding taking individual single actions and then waiting for the 
enemy's reaction before proceeding to the next action. (139) 
The State-Defense paper on Laos, together with the Joint Chiefs' 
comments were presented to President Kennedy on 19 June. At this time, 
Kennedy approved most of the proposed actions of Phase I for tentative imple-
mentation and announced that he would again review the Lao problem in about 
a month. The discussion on 19 June did not resolve disagreements as to 
Phase III, but after the meeting Secretary McNamara directed the Joint Chiefs 
to develop the new approach to waging pressure against North Vietnam in lieu 
of committing the United States to a ground campaign in Laos. Accordingly, 
the Joint Chiefs directed CINCPAC to prepare a new operations plan that 
would include air and naval (including amphibious) operations against North 
Vietnam that would be followed by other appropriate and feasible operations. 
This directive would produce a new OINCPAC Operations Plan 99-64, but mean-
while on 30 July President Kennedy again reviewed Phase I actions and 
directed an implementation of them. These actions included American aid for 
the FAR and Kong Le forces without further demobilization and including 
heavy weapons; establishing US contact with the FAR, the Neutralists and 
pro-Western tribal groups! increased American air resupply and augmentation 
of Souvanna Phouma's airlift capabilities; encouragement of the FAR to 
eliminate pockets of Pathet Lao within its area of control; provision of 
T-28 aircraft and armament to the FAR to conduct reprisal strikes; commence-
ment of a strategic hamlet program in the Mekong Valley; and expansion of 
the use of highly mobile South Vietnamese border patrols in Laos to inter-
dict entry into South Vietnam and to gather intelligence. The last action 
had not been included in the initial State-Defense draft paper which had, 
instead, proposed that as a last step in Phase I the United States should 
resume aerial reconnaissance over Laos, even though this would be an overt 
violation of the Geneva Agreement. (140)

In a meeting with representatives of the British and French Embassies

remaining within the framework of the Geneva agreement. Hilsman said that 
the United States had been thinking about increasing the heavy weapons 
of the FAR and the Neutralists; increasing Phoumi's airlift; encouraging 
the FAR and the Kong Le forces to gain firmer control over the areas they 
held; providing refresher training for Lao T-28 pilots and mechanics; and 
improving intelligence capabilities in Laos. HiIsman said that the United 
States was "not particularly impressed by the military utility" of the T-28s 
in Lao hands but that they would help considerably to build morale, since 
Souvanna had requested them. (141) 
Even though Hilsman did not indicate unusual concern about the T-28s, 
the State and Defense Departments were more actively exercised about the 
situation in southeastern Laos and the impact that the T-28s could have at 
a moment of crisis. On 3 July, a State-Defense message directed the American 
Embassy in Vientiane to make progress to perfect an arrangement whereby 
Thailand would release the T-28s to Laos on American direction in a moment 
of crisis. The message also advised Vientiane to pre-position bombs in Laos, 
where they would be immediately available for use in a crisis. (142) In 
accordance with earlier agreements, Thailand conducted the refresher training 
for the Lao pilots and mechanics in two increments beginning on 9 July, (1).3) 
but other aspects of the T-28 program proved vastly complicated. The American 
Embassy in Vientiane opposed pre-positioning of bombs in Laos because it did 
not believe it could control their use. This matter was resolved by a State-
Defense directive which authorized the Embassy to maintain the physical posses-
sion of the fuzes for the bombs stocked in Laos. (144) Where Phoumi had 
believed that Sarit had agreed to turn over T-28s to the RLAF on a simple 
directive, the Thai Prime Minister seemed to have second thoughts. Accordingly, 
Thailand demanded that the United States take title to the T-28s-and deliver 
them to Souvanna Phouma at his request. In a letter marked "very secret" 
on 20 July, Souvanna formally requested the United States to replace the worn-
out RLAF T-6s on a one-for-one basis with T-28s. (145) On this dame date in 
London, the British Foreign Officer informed the United States that it did 
not believe that T-28s flown by Lao pilots would be very effective as any-
thing more than a morale booster and doubted that there was enough emergency 
in Laos to justify an action that could be exploited as a violation of the 
Geneva Agreement. (146) On 26 July, a French Embassy representative called 
upon Assistant Secretary Hilsman and told him that France's position was 
that the T-28s could be legally introduced into Laos as replacements for 
T-6s but that the United States would need to be sure that it could keep 
Phoumi under control. (147) 
As a result of the Anglo-French reactions, US authorities made a rather 
careful analysis of Phoumi's concepts of operations and especially his ideas 
about employing the T-28s. When the matter of the T-28s began to be discussed, 
General Phoumi indicated on 11 June that he wanted the planes to work against

Pathet Lao and Vietminh artillery positions hazarding the Plaine des Jarres. 
(148) This employment of the planes was not inconsistent with the State-
Defense position that Phoumi should not be allowed to over-extend himself. 
(149) At a briefing on 10 July, however, the US Military Attache found 
Phoumi in excellent spirits and disposed to undertake a vigorous campaign to 
free Laos of Communists. He proposed to stage a large airborne operation 
astride Route 7 near the Vietnamese border and to strike east from Nhommarath-
Mahaxay. With these two routes chopped off, the Pathet Lao would be trapped 
for destruction. Phoumi did not think the Vietminh would enter the conflict 
because they would fear international reprisal. Phoumi urged that T-28s 
would be essential in the operations. (150) When the Pathet Lao began to 
probe Kong Le positions on the Plaine des Jarres on 13 July, Phoumi urgently 
proposed to employ T-28s in attacks both around the Plaine des Jarres and 
along Route 7 and to jump six parachute battalions across Route 7 east of 
Ban Ban. (151) When Admiral Felt responded that jumping six battalions so 
close to North Vietnam would surely provoke the Vietminh, Phoumi modified 
his plan of action. He proposed to permit the Pathet Lao to penetrate into 
the center of the Plaine des Jarres before loosing T-28s on attacks along 
Route 7 and jumping same FAR battalions close to the Plaine des Jarres to 
mouse-trap the Pathet Lao. (152) 
The American country teams in Vientiane agreed that Phoumi's military 
plans seemed to be designed to entrap the United States into an active inter-
vention in Laos, but there was little question that the RLAF needed replace-
ments for its old T-6s. When the fighting flared up on the Plaine des Jarres, 
Colonel Ma moved his three combat capable T-6s from Pakse to Paksane, thus 
permitting them to cover the Plaine but leaving the Attopeu-Saravane area 
without air support. (153) .0n 20 July, Souvanna Phouma expressed a fear of 
an imminent attack from the Plaine des Jarres and formally requested delivery 
of T-28s. (.54) Responding to Phoumi's request for a critique on his suggested 
plans, the DB State and Defense Departments messaged on 20 July that Phoumi 
must not be allowed to over-extend himself or undertake an injudicious 
offensive in an expectation that the United States would bail him out of a 
bad predicament. The message further provided that the mission of the T-28 
aircraft would be "defensive in the broad sense." Phoumi was to be impressed 
with the fact that the T-28s "should only be used when the military situation 
requires and should not be used in such a way as to extend area or scope of 
fighting." (155) Under these guidelines, the United States passed the title 
to the T-28s to Laos on 26 July, and the first three of them were flown to 
Pakse on 29 July. Early in August, the remaining Lao T-6s were replaced on 
an individual basis by the other T-28s. (156) On 30 July, the US Chief of 
Mission visited Phoumi and impressed upon him that Washington had reacted 
negatively to his offensive planning. Phoumi agreed that the T-28s would be 
used only for defensive actions and that he would limit his operations to 
a "highly mobile defense" on all fronts. (157)

Although other Lao air reinformement actions stretched the Geneva 
agreement more than the transfer of the T-28s, these actions gave less 
difficulty in their execution. In order to provide same air reconnaissance 
capability in Laos, Thailand transferred a camera equipped C-47 to the 
RLAF in late March 1963. Flying this-C-47 on 17 April, a US Air Attache 
crew first discovered the extensive Chinese Communist road building effort 
in Phong Saly province. (158) When the Russian transport aircraft were 
wearing out, Souvanna Phouma requested additional US transports, preferably 
as gifts but as contract operations if necessary. At about this same time 
in May, ICC Chairman Singh overruled the objections of the Polish commis-
sioner and announced a conclusion that Air America was a purely commerical 
organization not falling within the terms of the Geneva protocol. (159) 
As a part of the Phase I stabilization actions, the Department of Defense 
on 23 July approved delivery to Laos of C-47 cargo aircraft, three U-17A 
liaison aircraft, and three additional H-34 helicopters. These aircraft 
were delivered during September and October 1963. The three H-34e would 
be operated by Air America, and this company's operations were generally 
limited by decision to governmental-ordered non-military missions including 
resupply for the Meo and Iia tribal groups. On the other hand the other 
civil contractor -- Bird and Son -- employed leased and awned C-46s and 
other special aircraft including two Caribou and three Helio Couriers pro-
vided or leased under Phase I actions. Because Bird and Son aircraft 
regularly and Air America H-34s on occasion transported troops and war 
materials, the companies were in technical violation of the Geneva protocol. 
(160) But the RIAF lacked the capabilities to operate the transport aircraft 
required to supply the Conservative-Neutralist forces, and the United States 
had little alternative but to undertake this technical violation of the 
international neutralization of Laos. (161) 
Other Phase I actions were being undertaken at the same time additional 
aircraft were being provided to Laos. At first, Admiral Felt protested 
the allocation of heavy 105-mm. howitzers and 4.2 mortars to the Neutral-
ists on the Plaine des Jarres since these weapons would be vulnerable to 
capture there and because Kong Le's troops were not trained to operate 
them. In the end, Felt was overruled because of Presidential interest in 
demonstrating a determination to assist Kong Le. In order to increase the 
capability of FAR and Neutralist forces, both Felt and Unger favored an 
extensive encadrement of Lao units with Thai instructors, who could accept 
Laotian citizenship overnight. Phoumi accepted some Thai volunteers in 
artillery and air units, and he supported an extensive training program for 
Lao military specialists that was begun in Thailand in September 1963, but 
he resisted any encadrement of Lao units with Thai personnel, preferring 
instead to expect a commitment of large Thai units to combat in Laos in 
a time of emergency. The employment of the Thai personnel was not without 
embarassment: on 11 September 1963 a Thai pilot left a T-28 formation in 
which he was flying and may have defected. No trace of the pilot or 
aircraft was found. Increased American aid for the FAR and Neutralists

logically demanded the return of American advisors to Laos, which was 
forbidden by the Geneva agreement but could be managed by assignment of 
additional assistant military attaches in colonel or lieutenant colonel 
ranks. Admiral Felt placed a requirement for two additional Army 
assistant attaches to serve on the Plaine des Jarres, an Army assistant 
attache to serve with General Phoumi, and an Air Force assistant attache 
to advise Colonel Ma. The three Army assistant military attaches were 
provided in July, but PACAF had more difficulty producing an officer for 
assignment as advisor to Colonel Ma at Savannakhet since this individual 
was supposed to be experienced in tactical air warfare and also fluent 
in the French language but the position was filled early in August. (162) 
In addition to the military actions, the State-Defense study on Laos 
called for simultaneous political actions to place pressure on the Com-
munists to live up to their part af the Geneva Agreement. In the develop-
ing political actions, the Laos International Control Commission flew to 
Pathet Lao "capitol" of Khang Khay on 29 July, only to be lectured by 
Souphanounvong in what was described as being a "professorial" manner. 
The Red Prince found it regrettable that Souvanna and Kong Le had let 
themselves serve as a screen behind which the American imperialists were 
again introducing war materials into Laos. (163) British Foreign Secretary 
Lord Home tackled Soviet Foreign Minister Gramyko early in August, again 
seeking to persuade the Soviet Union to accept its role as a Geneva co-
chairman.. Recalling Khrushchev's remark to Harriman that he was bored 
with Laos, Home pointed out that such boredom could lead to another great 
power confrontation. Gromyko nevertheless said that the three Lao princes 
obviously could not get,along with each other and that there was nothing 
that Russia could do about this. He also said that the obstructionist 
Polish ICC commissioner was acting correctly under the Geneva instructions 
and that it was up to the members of the ICC to work together in harmony. 
(164) In an assessment of the Lan situation on 12 August, Secretary Rusk 
found no change in the Soviets. "Khrushchev's response to recent western 
approaches," Rusk stated, "clearly indicates persistent Soviet refusal 
to give more than nominal cooperation .... Soviet attitude attributable 
in large measure to their obvious inability [to] influence Chi Cams and 
unwillingness to test whatever authority they may still have over the 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam." (165) In an effort to get Souphanouvong 
to return to his vacant posts in the coalition government, Souvanna Phoma 
proposed to neutralize Luang Prabang and move the administrative capital 
there, but this offer was rejected, Ostensibly to secure medical treatment 
but actually to request the Soviets to renew their supplies to him, Kong Le 
went to Moscow in August. This diplomatic probe also failed. In an 
address before the United Nations General Assembly on 20 September, Prime 
Minister Souvanna Phouma was clearly despondent about the disorders and 
failure of the ICC to act effectively in Laos. In the interests of peace, 
he appealed to .the great powers, especially the signatories of the Geneva 
agreements, to respect "both the letter and the spirit of the undertakings 
into which they have entered." (166)

In the event that the Phase I actions failed to secure a genuinely 
neutralized Laos and Communist adherence to the Geneva agreement, the 
State-Defense paper of 19 June envisioned a progressive application of 
additional pressure in Phase II actions to include expansion of the US 
military advisory role with the FAR and Kong Le forces and the removal of 
any restrictions on the offensive action of these forces and on the use 
of Lao T-28s and T-6s. While political soundings indicated that no progress 
had been made in attaining a neutralized Laos, Washington authorities pre-
ferred to continue to maintain a defensive in Laos during the autumn of 1963. 
Developments in South Vietnam were very serious and demanded the utmost 
attention of the Kennedy administration. And, although there had been some 
apprehension that the news of the arrival of the T-28s in Laos might set off 
a vigorous Pathet Lao/Vietminh offensive on the Plaine des Jarres, this was 
not the case. Instead, the beginning of very heavy monsoon rains in early 
August flooded the mountain streams of Laos and made all travel and resupply 
very difficult. (167) By 14 August, General Phoumi indicated that all 
Vietminh battalions had been withdrawn from the eastern Laos as far south-
ward as the Nape Pass. There was, however, no reduction in the Vietminh 
activity in the Tchepone area, and Phoumi believed that the Vietminh were 
having difficulty with supply rather than purposefully de-escalating the 
war. (168) Events on 5 September proved Phoumi right. Late on the afternoon 
of that day, an Air America C-46 on charter to US AID outbound from Sayan-
nakhet and bound for Ban Houei Sane on a rice-dropping mission was shot down 
by heavy ground fire received while in the vicinity of Tchepone. A Bird and 
Son C-46 with Lao markings also reported encountering bursts of flak at 
10,500 feet a couple of hours later in the same area where the Air America 
plane went down. (169) As a reprisal to this hostile action, there was an 
option of using the Lao T-28s in support of guerrilla operations in south-
eastern Laos. On 11 September, however, the Department of State reiterated 
the policy that it was not the intention of the United States to take the 
initiative in a military escalation in Laos and refused to grant approval 
for the use of the T-28s in support of guerrilla operations. (170) In a 
briefing at Udorn on 15 December, a representative of the US Embassy in 
Vientiane explained the Ambassadors concern that military and air operations 
against the Pathet Lao were to be clearly in context of defense or 
retaliation. (171) 
When President Kennedy addressed the United Nations General Assembly on 
20 September, he found more optimism in the situation in Laos than did 
Souvanna Phouma. "A neutral coalition in Laos, while still in difficulty," 
Kennedy said, "is at least in being." (172) On the positive side of the 
assessment, the Phoumi-Kong Le forces were gaining in effectiveness during 
the lull in fighting, and Phoumi used airlift to reinforce the Plaine des 
Jarres with eight FAR infantry battalions -- four located in the Plaine 
and four in the area near Xieng Khouang. This represented a decided 
advance for the FAR into areas that it had failed to penetrate by combat

in 1961 and 1962. (173) In the economic field, the United States, Britain, 
France, and Australia negotiated with Souvanna Phouma's government to 
restore a value to its monstrously inflated currency. In the agreement 
that became effective on 1 January 1964, the Lao government devalued the 
kip from 80 to 240 to the dollar, increased taxes, and created a legal 
open market for the kip (which had been selling at around 400-500 to the 
dollar). The western nations set up a foreign excnange operations fund 
to buy excess kip and thus stabilize its value. As a part of the economic 
reforms, the United States also changed the system whereby it provided 
aid to Laos, so that the bulk of the general economic assistance would 
take the form of financing very carefully controlled commodity inports. 
(174) 
During his tenure as Ambassador to Laos, Ambassador Brown had estab-
lished himself as the undisputed leader of the US Country Team, and, after 
the neutralization of Laos and the withdrawal of the American MAIG, Ambas-
sador Unger occupied a position of unique supremacy in military as well as 
civil matters. While Unger kept CINCPAC informed of military operations, 
the Ambassador to Laos had no responsibility to the US unified command in 
the Pacific. In regard to general military and policy advice, Unger 
depended upon the US Military Attache. He was reported to ask advice of 
the USAF Air Attache only on technical matters. These attaches, moreover, 
were responsible to the Ambassador and were outside CINCPAC military com-
mand channels. Any communications from the attaches to CINCPAC or their 
respective military departments went through the EMbassy and to the State 
Department for retransmission. (175) 
As has been seen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff frequently queried Admiral 
Felt to solicit his recommendations regarding military matters in Laos. 
CINCPAC's recommendations on military matters, however, were frequently 
not accepted in Washington, and his position on actions to stabilize the 
situation in Laos which he forwarded on 19 June 1963 was reported to have 
arrived too late to be fully considered at the meeting during which 
President Kennedy approved the new course of US policy in Laos. (176) 
Despite its responsibilities for Air Force MAP, the PACAF only monitored 
the more than fifty State/EMbassy messages passed to it by PACOM concerning 
the Lao T-6/T-28 transaction. Commenting on this, Maj. Gen. Glen W. Martin, 
PACAF Deputy Chief of State for Plans and Operations, exclaimed: "The 
extent to which the State Department has gotten into the details of routine 
Air Force business is actually fantastic." (177) In Saigon, where he was 
Air Force Component Commander, MACV-THAI, General Anthis, wrote Martin: 
"We do not have access to the messages you refer to but the end product 
as sent down through CINCPAC/MACV channels reflect some pretty fuzzy 
thinking on State's part." As a matter of fact, Anthis needed information 
from Laos as an input to his planning for Vietnam and Thailand. To a 
degree he was kept abreast of developments in Laos by fairly regular 
briefings given to him by Lt. Ccl. C. E. Rigney, Air Force Attache in 
Vientiane. (178)

In the formulation of the Thai Master Force Plan during 1962, Ambassador 
Young was convinced that internal subversion rather than external attack 
was the main Communist threat to Thailand, but, as has been seen, he was 
persuaded to accept a "two track" plan whereby infantry and air force units 
would be prepared for conventional military defense operations and would be 
additionally employed in civic actions and counterinsurgency projects. In 
April 1963, however, Young sent CRJUSMAG Thailand a memorandum requesting 
that the MAP plans reflect a greater emphasis on counterinsurgency. In a 
very unusual action, Ambassador Young also wrote directly to Secretary 
McNamara disagreeing with the MAP projection for Thailand and recommending 
that a predominant emphasis should be given to counterinsurgency. In July, 
the Embassy informed the State Department that money should be taken from 
MAP and applied to AID political and economic development projects or else 
the MAP-supported Thai armed forces should be influenced to provide much 
larger returns in terms of increased deterrence to subversion and insurgency. 
(179) At a conference of State and Defense personnel held at Udorn in 
December 1963 in an effort to harmonize policy, a member of the Bangkok 
Embassy staff argued that the USAF F-100 flight should be removed from 
Thailand and replaced with an allegedly more useful Air Force Special Air 
Warfare (SAW) detachment. (180) 
Among some officials of the Kennedy administration, a very high degree 
of authority for the US Ambassadors in Southeast Asia appeared right and 
appropriate. After their visit to South Vietnam and Laos at the beginning 
of 1963, Eilsman and Forrestal gave President Kennedy an "eyes only" 
recammendation calling for the appointment of a very prestigious individual 
who could dominate all other governmental representatives as ambassador 
to Vietnam. (181) Held by Admiral Felt in May 1963, a PACOM MAAG Chiefs 
Conference discussed the "country team." Even though Ambassador Young's 
direct correspondence with Secretary McNamara was believed to be unprece-
dented, Felt advised the MAAG Chiefs not to get too excited about it since 
all MAAG s could justify their programs through a military chain of cammand. 
But Felt urged the MAAG Chiefs to give him their best military judgments; 
concurrence of the ambassador in the judgment was not important. (182) 
In Thailand the arrival of J. Graham Martin as the new U.S. Ambassador 
brought a more measured view of MAP planning in the latter part of 1963. 
Martin favored a development of Thai counterinsurgency capabilities, 
though not as a crash program at the expense of MAP. Later that year, 
Martin would also accept the PACAF position that an F-100 flight and a 
SAW detachment could not be equated against each other and that both were 
in fact required in Thailand but for different reasons. (183) The harmoni-
zation of defense and political policy in Laos was less felicitious, even 
after October 1963 when the rainy season ended and the Communists renewed 
their probes of FAR and Neutralist defenses, and the Western defenses of 
South Vietnam neared collapse. Already on record as being somewhat less

than enthusiastic about the failure to employ airpower in Laos, Admiral 
Felt was very skeptical about the Vientiane Embassy's description of the 
fighting in Laos as "skirmishes" since Felt pointed out that the Pathet 
Lao/Vietminh had established control over most of Laos in three years 
of "skirmishing." (184) As will be seen, Ambassador Unger would reluctantly 
be compelled to release bombs to the Lao Air Force, but he would continue to 
believe that it would be in the best world-wide interest of the United States 
"to keep low emphasis on the situation in Laos." (185)

CHAPTER 7 
NATIONAL COUNTERINSURGENCY PLANNING IN VIETNAM, 
1962-1963 
1. The MACV National Campaign Plan: Concepts and Requirements 
In the Communist estimate of the situation in Vietnam, 1961 had been 
a "Front" year in terms of victories, but there were unmistakable signs 
in mid-1962 that US actions in Southeast Asia had disrupted Communist 
plans. Inside South Vietnam the National Liberation Front was troubled 
by the establishment of strategic hamlets, and it issued carders on 23 
June for intensified Vietcong attacks against them. Heliborne operations 
had caught the Vietcong off balance.(1) The strong US show of force into 
Thailand in May 1962 affected the situation in Vietnam. According to Ngo 
Dinh Nhu, the Soviet Union was reluctant to continue to supply the two 
North Vietnamese Army (NVA) regiments stationed in the Lao panhandle, and 
Hanoi was not prepared to take over their support. Nhu said that the NVA 
regiments in Laos were in trouble. In a sudden spurt of activity between 
I May and 15 June 1962 some 1,000 to 1,800 infiltrators moved from Laos 
into South Vietnam, but in the month after 15 June only 80 infiltrators 
from Laos were sighted, and these men apparently returned to Laos after a 
foraging raid on a South Vietnamese village. The remainder of the NVA 
force in Laos marked time, awaiting new policy and consuming supplies 
that the Communists had consigned for movement into Zone D, where the 
Vietcong had been attempting to stockpile enough food and equipment to 
support a division-sized unit for attacks against Saigon. (2) 
Indicating that Hanoi might be willing to give up its efforts to 
unify Vietnam by force, the National Liberation Front released a state-
ment on 17 July 1962 calling for the creation of a neutral state in 
South Vietnam along the lines of the neutralization of Laos. At the same 
time Ho Chi Minh was quoted as praising Diem's patriotism and nationalism. 
After an interview with Ho Chi Minh in July, the historian Bernard Fall 
noted that Hanoi was impressed by the result of US bombing of North Korean 
industry during the Korean war and was apprehensive for the safety of its 
new factories if the Vietcong war should spread and bring US bombs over 
North Vietnam.(3) Where in 1959 Ho had predicted defeat of the Government 
of Vietnam in one year, he had begun by September 1962 to say that victory 
might take 15 to 20 years.(4) 
In Washington some consideration was given to the prospects for a 
political solution to the Vietnamese problem, a proposition suggested to 
President Kennedy in a memorandum from Ambassador Galbraith on 4 April 
1962. At his post in New Delhi, Galbraith continued to believe that Diem 
was a weak and ineffectual leader and that US policy ought to look toward 
political solutions for Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs of Staff vigorously 
disagreed on 13 April, stating that the effect of such an action would be 
to put the United States in a position of initiating negotiations with the

Communists in search of a disengagement from what had become a well-known 
commitment to take a forthright stand against Communism in Southeast Asia.(5) 
In Saigon President Diem told the National Assembly on 9 October that the 
war against the Vietcong had taken an "incontestable turn" for the better, 
but in private conversations Vietnamese governmental leaders Diem and Nhu 
did not understand the reasons why the United States had agreed to a neu-
tralization of Laos. They opposed any similar neutralization for Vietnam, 
which they considered would be merely a siren-song to lull the war-weary 
and would result in an eventual Communist takeover. In conferences with 
President Diem and Nhu on 22 October, Admiral Felt and Ambassador Nolting 
found both men worried about US policy toward South Vietnam and assured 
them that the United States had not weakened its resolution to resist 
Communism in Vietnam.(6) In his awn government, Diem put off all sug-
gestions that he broaden the base of authority since it was well known 
that the Communists had approached many of his opponents with proposals 
for a neutralized coalition. 
At mid-1962 it was evident that US support for the Government of 
Vietnam had arrested many former adverse trends. As already noted, 
Secretary McNamara recognized this fact on 23 July when he directed 
General Harkins to look ahead to -a three-year program to train and equip 
the RVNAF and phase out major US combat, advisory, and logistics support 
activities. Since US requirements planning for South Vietnam would depend 
upon some definite nationwide campaign plan, MACV staff officers in the 
period from July to September 1962 prepared a MACV National Campaign Plan 
(NCP) that would hopefully guide the RVNAF. General Harkins briefed the 
NCP to Secretary McNamara on 8 October, following which it was presented 
to the RVNAF Joint General Staff, to Secretary Thuan, and to President 
Diem, all of whom accepted it in 'principle and authorized joint RVNAF-US 
planning.(7) 
In its essentials the MACV National Campaign Plan was a collection of 
concepts rather than an exact military plan. It took note of the fact 
that ARVN was being manned with nine regular divisions, but that if the 
total fighting people in South Vietnam were reckoned in division strength 
figures South Vietnam would possess approximately 51 divisions. It 
envisioned that all South Vietnamese forces would be brought under unified 
leadership, this through reforms of the Joint General Staff and the estab-
lishment of four largely autonomous ARVN corps tactical zone (CTZ) area 
field commanders. The concept of operations was predicated on destruction 
of low echelon enemy elements and their replacement capabilities; the 
maintenance of pressure on Vietcong supply, communications, control, and 
support facilities, and the limiting of insurgents to designated areas; 
and, following the accomplishment of these preliminaries, the RVNAF would 
launch a general offensive to annihilate the enemy. The planning called 
for three time-phased activites in the OTZs: I--Preparation, II--Conduct 
of the Campaign, and III--Consolidation. In late 1962 General Harkins 
conceived that an explosion of the total RVNAF capabilities would destroy 
the Vietcong, hopefully in 1962. Harkins conceived that the Phase II

"Explosion" operations would begin immediately after the "Tet" Lunar New 
Year holiday on 28 January 1963, and at a meeting on 9 January 1963 
Harkins pointedly reminded Diem that he had promised to win during 1963. 
Diem responded, "Sure, sure," but demurred that the strategic hamlets 
would have to be completed first and that this would not be done before 
the spring of 1964. Following Diem's lead, the Joint General Staff 
ruled that the Phase I preparation phase could not start until three-
quarters of the strategic hamlets had been completed and two-thirds of 
the national population was under such control. (8) 
On the positive side the MACV NCP was the first expression of a 
countrywide counterinsurgency strategy that was acceptable to President 
Diem, but on the negative side the plan's generalized concepts provided 
an uncertain basis for computing exact military requirements, although 
1L was evident that the plan represented Navy and Army views about the 
nrganization and employment of air power and would be quite expensive in 
Lf-,s reauirements for aviation resources. Issued by Admiral Felt on 6 
June 196L, a new CINCPAC Instruction, "Policy Governing the Establishment 
of Combat Operations Centers and Air Operations Centers," accepted -- in 
the view of General O'Donnell -- the US Marine Corps position that air 
operations in a contingency situation did not require the degree of 
central control by an Air Force component commander judged necessary by 
the Air Force. As has been noted, this instruction made it incumbent upon 
PACOM subunified commanders to organize a combat operations center for 
joint planning and coordination and an air operations center which would 
function under an Air Force component commander to control the operations 
of USAF units and to serve as a coordinating authority over the operations 
of other air units not assigned to ar made available to the Air Force but 
which were operating in the area of responsibility of the Air Force com-
p=ent commander. On the other hand, Admiral Felt conceived that this 
instruction recognized the fact that each of the US armed services pos-
sessed aircraft units which might or might not be volunteered to Air Force 
control and required that air operations in a contingency situation should 
be coordinated by the Air Force component commander.(9) In an implementing 
directive on 18 August, MACV referred to the already operational VNAF-USAF 
Joint Operations Center as the "Air Operations Center" and envisioned the 
organization of a RVNAF "Combat Operations Center" under the JGS. The NCP 
made the same requirements, and orders issued by President Diem an 26 
November for some unknown reason designated the JGS center as the "Joint 
Operations Center" and redesignated the VNAF-USAF JOC as the "Joint Air 
Operations Center. "(10) 
Other concepts relating to force organization contained in the NCP 
appeared to trace back to a US Army conceptual study submitted to 
Secretary McNamara on 16 January 1962 which proposed that since counter-
insurgency operations would be conducted primarily in a land environment 
and among people the US Army should develop and provide both the air units 
and the ground forces required to provide support to friendly indigenous 
ground forces engaged against insurgents. This concept had not been

approved, but on 19 April 1962 Secretary McNamara had requested the 
Secretary of the Army to provide.him with an imaginative study of the 
future role of Army aviation without regard to traditional military . 
doctrine. The Army had establiShed a Tactical Mobility Requirements 
Board under the presidendy of Lt. Gen. Hamilton H. Howe, and after 18 
weeks study the Howze Board had recommended an 20 August the estab-
lishment of a new air-assault (later airmobile) division, Which would 
possess 459 Organic aircraft, including armed helicopters and Mohawk 
aircraft for an important part of its firepower. In addition to 
organic transport helicopters, the airmobile division would be supported 
by an air transport brigade, which would possess 54 transport helicopters 
and 80 Caribou transport aircraft and would be prepared to pick up cargo 
delivered by Air Force transports and carry it forward to the airmobile 
units in the field. The Howze Board suggested that the airmobile con-
cept would be extremely useful to meet local requirements for air-ground 
operations in a counterinsurgency environment such as that in Southeast 
Asia.(11) In the same month that the Howze Board report appeared, the 
US Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations stated that experience in 
Vietnam demonstrated that "a counterinsurgency force commander must have 
instantaneous authority and capability to utilize any element of his 
force, including aircraft and crews without going through interservice 
coordination machinery. 11(12) In the RVNAF reorganization recommended by 
the NCP and accepted by President Diem in a series of decrees, arders, 
and directives on 26 November, the central Field Command was inactivated 
and South Vietnam's territory (outside of the Capital Military District 
around Saigon) was divided among four corps tactical zones (the new IV 
CTZ being established in the Mekong Delta with headquarters at Can Tho). 
The draft command and force annex to the NCP, which was drawn up by the 
MACV staff and coordinated with the South Vietnamese government before 
being shown to the 2d Air Division, provided that the corps tactical zone 
commanders would exercise operational control over VNAF elements allocated 
to support their operations.(13) 
As will be seen, the CINCPAC instruction of 6 June did not provide the 
Commander, 2d Air Division, with an effective degree of positive control 
of air operations over South Vietnam, and the designation of the Joint 
General Staff center as a "Joint Operations Center" produced confusion 
among RVNAF personnel who had only begun to understand the duties performed 
by the VNAF-USAF agency at Tan Son Nhut, which was immediately redesignated 
as the Joint Air Operations Center (JAW) and subsequently the Air Opera-
tions Center (AOC). By mid-December the JGS-JOC was established under 
direct control of Lt. Can. Le Van Ty, Chief of Staff of the JGS. In manning 
the JGS-JOC, ARVN was allocated 81 officer spaces and VNAF 15 (only 6 of 
which could be immediately filled). As a counterpart advisory element to 
the JGS-JOC, MACV organized the MAC Staff Element (MACSTELM), and the 
MACSTELM officer spaces were divided so that 24 US Army officers, 3 US Navy 
officers, and 6 USAF officers were assigned.(14) The relationships between 
the JOS-JOG and the JAOC were not precisely defined, but in general the

JGS-JOC provided broad strategic guidance to the JACO, established 
priorities for air support when air resources could not meet all 
requirements requested by the CTZ's, and maintained information status 
boards on current RVNAF combat activities.(15) 
It appeared at first that the NCP command and force annex would 
result in control of VNAF units at the CTZ level, thus limiting the 
functions of the JACC to a control over USAF aircraft through the 
tactical air control system. After viewing the draft annex, however, 
General Anthis stoutly maintained that operational control of Air Force 
units would not be assigned to CTZ commanders, and that air support must 
be made available through the TABS. In subsequent force tasking the 
VNAF was charged to provide special support to CTZ's (not the CTZ com-
manders), to provide unrestricted strafing of secret Vietcong bases, and 
to perform close air support, air reconnaissance, photography, and air-
lift.(16) The RVNAF reorganization required the organization of an 
additional VNAF-USAF air support operations center at the new IV CTZ, 
and at this same time the 2d Air Division took note of the fact that the 
arrangement whereby the VNAF-USAF JOC at Tan Son Nhut had functioned in 
lieu of a III ASOC had not worked too well although it represented a 
saving of personnel. In the III Corps arrangement a III corps representa-
tive had been located in the operations center at Tan Son Nhut and had 
received requests for air missions directly from the corps or its divisions 
and passed them to responsible persons in the operations center. Under 
this arrangement no single agency at III Corps had had complete knowledge 
of air requests made within the corps. In January 1963 initial manning 
was provided for the III ASOC in Saigon (later Bien Hoa) and for the IV 
ASOC at Can Tho. The new ASOC's were officially recognized as opera-
tional effective on 15 March, but both had been functioning with limited 
personnel for several weeks before this. (17) 
At the same time that General O'Donnell pointed out the defects in 
Admiral Felt's policy in regard to aviation organization in a subordinate 
unified command, he also questioned the wisdom of Felt's increasing use 
of MACV for the performance of planning. In order to maintain unity of 
air capabilities throughout the Far East, PACAF's organizational concept 
visualized that the 2d Air Division was a forward operational echelon of 
the Thirteenth Air Force and conceived that the Thirteenth Air Force and 
PACAF would be responsible for planning and implementing the air phase of 
operations in Southeast Asia. On the other hand, MACV was charged to pre-
pare the national counterinsurgency plan for Vietnam, and also for con-
tingency and exercise planning in mainland Southeast Asia. As an operating 
headquarters in a forward area, the 2d Air Division was not in a proper 
position to assume basic responsibilities for air planning in Southeast 
Asia, but COMUSMACV nevertheless looked to the 2d Air Division to provide 
supporting air plans as inputs to MACV plans. Since the responsibility for 
planning followed a direct chain of command from COMUSMOV to CINCPAC, the 
Thirteenth Air Force and PACAF staffs were not in line to review plans, 
although they were responsible for providing administrative and logistical

support for air activities required in the plans. The fact that the 
MACV J-staff was predominantly manned,by US. Army officers further com-
pounded the problem.(18) Back-channel information messages from 2d Air 
Division to Thirteenth Air Farce and PACAF allowed the latter two 
organizations same knowledge of MACV planning, and the Thirteenth Air 
Force sent temporary duty officers to augment 2d Air Division plans 
functions thus in same measure preserving the integrity of PACAF's planning 
cycle, but the command arrangement was nevertheless awkward and had some 
adverse impact upon air actions necessitated by the MACV NCP. 
Unlike the earlier CINCPAC counterinsurgency plan for Vietnam, which 
had visualized a most effective use of limited RVNAF resources through 
the central agency of the Field Command as a national counterinsurgency 
task force, the MACV NCP's requirment for simultaneous "explosion" 
operations in the four separate CTZ's posed a very large requirement for 
force capabilities. Where nscessary ground capabilities to support the 
plan could possibly be obtained by mustering all ARVN and popular defense 
force units into the effort, air!support could not be so simply attained. 
In the view of USAF officers in Saigon the NCP concept of operations was 
too vague to provide definite computations of air requirements, but as 
far as could be determined the strike sortie rate under the expanded 
explosion operations would more than double and there would be increased 
requirements for reconnaissance, target spotting/identification, and 
aerial resupply.(19) Plans for meeting expanded NCP air requirements 
necessarily involved the question of haw much and how fast VNAF's still 
limited pilot and support base could be expanded. 
The three-year RVNAF. military assistance program requested by.Secre-
tary McNamara on 23 July 1962 was prepared by MAAG Vietnam, in which ariz. 
Gen. Robert R. Rowland served as Chief, Air Force Section, and handled 
VNAF augmentation planning. Available in August, Rowland's "get well" 
program for VNAF followed McNamara's guidance and was quite ambitious. 
It projected the activation of a secand-VNAF AD-6 (now being redesignated 
as the A-IH) fighter squadron in fiscal year 1964, the activation of two 
additional VNAF fighter squadrons in fiscal year 1966 both to be equipped 
with Northrup-156 light jet fighters (the aircraft that USAF was developing 
for MAP and Which would be designated as the F-5 Freedom Fighter), and 
replacement of the planes in the VNAF T-28 squadron and in one of the VNAF 
A-Ill squadrons with the F-5 Freedom Fighters in the fiscal year 1966-68 
time frame. The projection included a total of nine VNAF L-19 liaison 
squadrons (one for each ARVN division) and four VNAF helicopter squadrons. 
The VNAF air reconnaissance program included the already projected squadron 
with 4 RT-33s and 18 RT-28s, and the air transport projection visualized 
combination of the VNAF C-478 into a single squadron during fiscal year 
1965 and provision of two VNAF C-123 squadrons, one in fiscal year 1965 
and the other in fiscal year 1968.(20) 
In the presentations of the proposed VNAF program, Maj. Gen. C. J. 
Timmes, Chief of the US MAAG ob,jected that the helicopter and liaison

squadrons should be assigned to the ARVN rather than to VNAF. When 
Admiral Felt heard the RVNAF MAP projection briefed an 20 October, he 
questioned the prospective cost of the VNAF program and also suggested 
that where the US State Department might conceivably approve the four 
RT-33 jet reconnaissance it. would not likely accept F-5 light jet 
fighters. Felt was receptive to Rowland's proposal to provide VNAF 
with a total of four H-34 helicopter squadrons, but he cut the VNAF 
liaision squadron projection back from nine to a total of four squadrons, 
the additional liaison squadron to be activated in fiscal year 1964. 
Although Felt remarked that the F-Ss would probably be shot down 
politically, he allowed the jet projections to stay in the VNAF program 
because he thought that it was important to provide jet aircraft to VNAF. 
VNAF pilot and technical training in the United States would continue 
and be expanded, but General Rowland called attention to the advantages 
of pilot training in Vietnam. In October it was agreed that a USAF Air 
Training Command field training detachment would come to Vietnam, use 
H-19s taken out of local storage, and open a helicopter pilot training 
program at Tan Son Nhut. In December it was also agreed that a USAF ATC 
field training detachment would be sent to Nha Trang to initiate liaision 
pilot training, thus not only providing personnel for the new liaison 
squadron but also permitting experienced VNAF L-19 pilots to up-grade to 
T-28s and experienced T-28 pilots to move up to A-1H cockpits.(21) 
As will be seen, the VNAF MAP projections would be overtaken by events 
and would be changed by higher authority, but they nevertheless provided 
an indication to General Anthis that prospective VNAF air capabilities 
would be insufficient to support the aviation requirements of the MACV NCP. 
In addition to the Farm Qate augmentation Which had been requested on14 
September 1962 (and, as was seen, reflected current rather than NCP 
requirements), the 2d Air Division submitted a request for a USAF aug-
mentation to support the NCP to MACV on 6 October 1962, The request went 
through the MACV staff with general concurrence until it reached the MACV 
Chief of Staff, who returned it with a memo citing "lack of specific 
justification." After getting more specific ground action data from MACV, 
another 2d Air Division requirements study was submitted on 23 November. 
These calculations indicated a requirement for a temporary USAF augmenta-
tion for service in Vietnam to include one T-28 squadron (25 aircraft), 
one 3-26 squadron (25 aircraft), two additional RF-101 aircraft, two 
additional RB-26 aircraft, and three squadrons of USAF liaison aircraft. 
General Anthis considered it necessary to get the USAF liaision squadrons 
(which could be equipped with USF L-28s, US Army L-19s, or commercial 
Cessna-185s) because many strike missions had been delayed or deferred 
for lack of FAC aircraft, because more visual reconnaissance and convoy 
cover was required, and because the VNAF liaison objective had been cut 
back from nine to four squadrons.(22) 
Airlift requirements for the support of the NCP were calculated an the 
basis of the NCP logistical support plan prepared in MACV J-4 under the 
direction of Brig. Gen. Frank A. Osmanski, whose concepts of "wholesale"

and "retail" air transport channel operations followed thinking similar 
to that of the Howze Board. The logistic plan visualized sea lift to 
five port areas -- Saigon, Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Can Tho --
with 0-123 airlift radiating out from these ports to third destination 
airfields where air cargo would be picked up by integral corps air-
craft including Otters, Caribous, and helicopters. The C-123s would 
also handle high priority movements between Saigon and the second-
destination port airfields. Osmanski estimated that it would be neces-
sary to move 36,000 short tons per month by air to support NCP operations. 
An estimated 4.3 million ton miles of airlift per month was visualized as 
necessary, some 2.1 million ton miles more than could be provided by the 
two 0-123 squadrons and one Caribou company that were in Vietnam. 
Accordingly, on 2 December, General Harkins requested that two more 
squadrons of C-123s (32 aircraft) and one additional company of CV-2B 
Caribou aircraft (16 planes) should be sent to Vietnam, the first addi-
tional 0-123 squadron to arrive ab Da Nang in the first half of January 
1963 and the second additional C-123 squadron to be prepared to move to 
an airfield that would be designated to receive it during the last half 
of March. (23) 
In its early development the Civil Irregular Defense Group program 
in South Viet am had been managed by the US Embassy's 
ith assistance provided by US Army Special Forces training 
a en s. By July 1962 pure7lyllitary contributions to the CG pro-
gram had begun to outweigh th 
ontribution, leading to the decision 
e  
to transfer the program to MACV, which would organize Hqs. US Army Special 
Forces (Provisional) at Nha Trang on 15 September 1962 and complete the 
entire transfer by 1 July 1963. In the United States the US Army recom-
mended to the Secretary of Defense that Army special warfare aviation 
detachments should be formed to pl-cvide organic airlift and strike support 
for US Army Special Forces, and the Howze Board report made a similar 
recommendation. Within USAF, moreover, Brig. Gen. Gilbert L. Pritchard, 
Commander, USAF Special Air Warfare Center, conceived that USAF air 
commando units ought to work very closely with US Army Special Force units, 
receiving requests from Special Forces directly and performing the mission  
  Both in meetings with 
Col. George C. Morton, who woild command the US Army Special Forces 
(Provisional) Vietnam, and in MACV staff considerations during October, 
General Anthis argued that Farm Gate and the Combat Cargo Group were 
already providing strike and logistical air support to the Special Forces 
and could continue to do so. "If every operation in South Vietnam were 
provided with its awn separate air force," Anthis maintained, "the result

would quite obviously be a fragmentation and waste of the limited resources 
available, and non-effective use of air power." On 25 October, however, 
General Harkins recommended to C/NCPAC that US Army Special Farces Vietnam 
should be provided an organic airlift and fire support unit to comprise 
four L-20s or L-28s, four Caribous, 12 HU-1D helicopters, and four Mohawks. 
Harkins specified that all operations of the organic Special Farces air-
craft would be fully coordinated with the TACS.(25) 
In advice to Admiral Felt in regard to air support for the US Army 
Special Forces, PACAF emphasized that General Anthis could respond to the 
total air requirements in Vietnam and that separate air forces for each 
functional operation would be unwarranted and wasteful. This position 
was reinforced by MACV estimates that the Special Forces would require 
some 36 close air support sorties a month, plus a monthly airlift of 
approximately 680 short tons of cargo from the Nha Trang Special Forces 
logistical depot to Special Forces supply points in the ARVN CTZs. 
Obviously in some agreement with PACAF's position during November, Admiral 
Felt ruled that air support in Vietnam should be closely coordinated and 
centrally controlled and stated that he would not permit any direct assign-
ment or allocation of air support specifically to the CIDG or Special 
Forces. When Harkins then proposed to employ Air America contract airlift 
in support of the Special Forces, Felt again replied that if such air-
craft were employed they should be operated as a part of the total air 
capability and not committed to the exclusive use of the Special Forces. (26) 
Despite the CINCPAC objections to the further proliferation of aviation 
forces in Vietnam, the issue of organic US Army aviation support for 
Special Forces remained under consideration in Washington. In a command 
decision in Vietnam in early December, moreover, General Harkins withdrew 
the four Army Caribou transports that had been available for a short time 
tD the Southeast Asia Military Airlift System for common-use scheduling 
and committed them for the support of the Army Special Forces in the four 
CTZs. On 14 December, Harkins also cited excellent test results obtained 
from the six Army Mohawks assigned to the 23d Special Warfare Aviation 
Detachment at Nha Trang, and he recommended that four additional Mohawks 
should be sent to Vietnam, possibly to be used for Special Forces support.(27) 
2. ARVN Defeat at Ap Bac and Review of MACV Plans and Organization  
During conversations with Admiral Felt on 22 October, President Diem 
was not ready to think about countrywide "explosion" operations, but he 
believed that the time had come for a series of all-out attacks against 
Vietcong strongholds. In the Delta it would be important to work against 
the U Minh guerrillas on the Ca Mau peninsula, who were preventing move-
ment of charcoal to Saigon, thus denying the people fuel for cooking fires 
and forcing the government to bring in coal at an unnecessary expense. The 
Plain of Reeds southwest of Saigon was also important since this marsh area 
afforded the Vietcong access to that Diem called the "Holy Sanctuary" of the 
Cambodian border and also dominated the one main highway leading northward 
from the rich food resources of the Delta. Diem nevertheless believed that

it would be difficult and time-consuming to bring the Delta under full 
government control, and he was most-interested in clearing the enemy out 
of War Zones C and D to the north of Saigan.(28) 
As has been seen, the ARVN 21st Division mounted heliborne opera-
tions against the U Minh guerrillas in October 1962, now having additional 
support from newly arrived US Army HU-LA helicopter gunships. The major 
operations, however, were cast against Zones C and D, under the overall 
direction of Brig. Gen. Ton That Dinh, the former commander of the ARVN 
II Corps who took command of the ARVN III CTZ. At Diem's personal direc-
tion, ARVN Ranger forces were committed to penetration operations into and 
through Zone D under command of a Lieutenant Colonel Dien, who was placed 
in charge of operations in Phouc Long, Binh Long, and Phuoc Thanh provinces 
-- the new area of operations being designated as the PBT Special Tactical 
Zone. Diem had highest respect for Dien and for the difficulty of the 
Ranger mission in the dark jungle reaches of Zone D; Diem emphasized that 
when Dien asked for air support he must be sure to get it. While PBT 
Special Zone Ranger worked against Zone D, the ARVN 5th Division was 
expected to intensify its campaign into Zone C in northwestern Tay Ninh 
province. (29) 
The PBT Special Zone operations against Zane D began on 20 November 
1962, when after a pre-landing bombardment, five Mule Train C-123s and 
12 VNAF C-47s dropped 500 ARVN paratroopers at an obscure zone selected 
for a base camp at the eastern edge of Zone D. The weather was poor, the 
drop zone inadequately marked, and the C-123s had difficulty putting their 
strings of paratroopers into the small zone, but the pre-landing attacks 
by 15 AD-6s were reported highly effective in shielding the drop zone from 
Vietcaag apposition.(30) On 19 December the PBT Rangers launched Operation 
Holiday as a panetration into Zone 0, where double tree canopy cover 
extended upward to 80 foot heights. In the penetration, Dien asked for air 
support only as a last resort. Close support included a B-26 which dropped 
napalm on 23 December, and a B-26 and two T-28s which delivered general 
purpose bombs on 1 January. In additian, Dien requested and received eight 
interdiction strikes against Vietcong activities plotted in the near vicinity 
to his line of march. The effect of, air ordnance against targets in the 
heavily forested (but fairly dry) terrain proved better than expected. The 
napalm exploded in the tree tops but_ enough of it burned down to reach the 
jungle floor. The deputy Senior US Army Advisor visited four of the inter-
diction targets and found evidences that the enemy had hurriedly left them 
during the air attacks. Rockets and .50-caliber fire had penetrated the 
jungle canopy and 500-1b. bombs had burst trees, scattering lethal wood 
fragments. No casualties were noted but ten fresh graves were found. Mid-
way in a three week operation, Dien replaced the three Ranger companies 
used in the initial drive with three fresh Ranger companies that were lifted 
in by helicopter on 3 January. In addition to disrupting the Vietcang 
sanctuary, the Rangers killed 62 and captured 10 of the enemy at a cost of 
12 killed and 68 wounded. They also captured quantities of enemy equipment, 
including a 60-mm. mortar made in Rod China.(31)

In response to a report of a large Vietcong assembly east of Tay 
Ninh City, the ARVN III Corps hurriedly conceived and launched an ARVN 
5th Division heliborne attack called ?Autumn Breeze Phase IV between 
19-21 December. The size of the Vietcong force was exaggerated, but 
the ARVN troops caught three Vietcong, who yielded exact information 
about the location, functions, and staffing of 12 NIS-COSVN head-
quarters installations scattered through northern Tay Ninh province. 
This information was additionally verified by special agent reports, 
and General Dinh requested the Joint General Staff to authorize a maxi-
mum three-day air strike against the target that would be designed to 
exploit surprise and inflict maximum personnel casualties. Most of the 
targets, however, lay within the 10-mile restricted attack zone that had 
been established a month earlier at US insistence along the Cambodian 
border. Hesitating to disturb relations with Cambodia, President Diem 
initially disapproved the air attacks but upon reconsideration he felt 
that the opportunity was too great to forego. Instead of the intensive 
air strikes, the Joint General Staff directed that Operation Burning 
Arrow, scheduled to begin on 2 January 1963 would include a heavy hour-
long air attack (including Some delayed action bombs) against nine of 
the 12 targets farthest from the Cambodian border, preparatory to an air 
drop of some 1,250 ARVN paratroops and a heliborne landing of a battalion 
of ARVN rangers to seize the nine objectives. The air plan included 
additional "light strafing attacks" to be mounted against the enemy posi-
tions during the landings, to be followed by airborne alert Lr-19s and 
fighters from daylight to dark and airborne C-47 flare ships on station 
through the night of 2/3 January. Diem directed that American pilots 
would watch the ARVN troops closely so that they would not inadvertently 
cross the Cambodian border. To forestall warning the enemy by pre-
liminary reconnaissance flights (as many as ten observation flights had 
been made over same objective areas in past operations) the people with 
a need to know the lay of the land in the objective areas were assembled 
in a C-123 and taken over the areas in one straight-through flight.(32) 
On the morning of 2 January 1963, the Joint General Staff committed 
the entire farce of VNAF AD-6s and Farm Gate B-26s and T-28s at Bien Hoa 
to the support of Burning Arrow. The elanding air attacks apparently 
surprised the Vietcong. In the paradrops that followed some element of 
surprise was probably sacrificed, since the ARVN Airborne Brigade com-
mander found Vietcong stakes in his drop zone and kept the C-47s and 
C-123s circling for some time until he decided to go ahead with the drops. 
Including prelanding air strikes and some continuing strikes through the 
day, 26 AD-6, 16 B-26, and 24 T-28 sorties were flown before the ter-
mination of Burning Arrow. General Dinh called the air support "splendid" 
and so informed President Diem and General Harkins. In light ground 
combat, ARVN troops sustained 9 killed and wounded, while the Vietcong 
lost 76 killed and 16 prisoners. The paratroops and rangers also captured 
a number of individual weapons and an important cache of documents at 
COSVN's communications center. Initial assessments based upon POW reports 
and upon an intercepted Vietcong radio message credited the air strikes on 
2 January with killing some 400 persons, but later information obtained by 
General Dinh from Cambodia led him to report that the initial air strikes 
and the delay-fuzed bombs had inflicted heavier losses than earlier reported. 
Dinh stated that three NLF VIPs had been killed, two others had been

seriously wounded, and that betwnen 800-1,000 Vietcong had been killed. 
Dinh refused to release this information to be public because it had 
come from within the Communist sanctuary in Cambodia, and he did not 
wish to aggravate South Vietnam's delicate relations with Sihanouk.(33) 
In the US assessment, Operation BUraing Arrow was evaluated as the most 
successful operation yet to have been conducted in the ARVN III Corps. 
General Dinh was judged to have made an intelligent use of tactical air 
support in the operation.(34) 
On the same day that III CTZ operations in Zones C and D were meeting 
substantial success, it was doubly unfortunate that a Vietcong victory 
was shaping up on 2 January 1963 in the new IV CTZ south of Saigon at the 
village of Ap Bac -- a victory that would restore the lagging morale of 
the Vietcong to a remarkable degree and would also cast a pall over US 
relations with President Diem's government. In the war in the Delta 
during 1962, the ARVN 7th Division, under command of Lt. Col. Bui Dinh 
Dam, had enjoyed a reputation of having killed more Vietcong than any 
other ARVN division, and the 7th Division's operations in the Plain of 
Reeds had appeared likely to deprive the Vietcong of their control over 
this important area, covering access routes between the Delta and 
sanctuary bases north of Saigon. American armored M-113 amphibious 
vehicles had proved very useful in the swamps of the Plain of Reeds. 
The Vietcong agreed with this estimate of the situation: the NLF leader-
ship was getting desperate and had almost concluded that it must yield 
control of the Plain of Reeds and withdraw Vietcong regular force units 
to northern sanctuary bases.(35) 
Late in December ARVN intelligence pinpointed the location of a 
Vietcong radio that was believed to be protected by a company of hardcore 
Vietcong in a relatively inaccessible area near the village of Ap Bac, 
about 15 miles northwest of the 7th Division command post at My Tho, and 
an 29 December Colonel Dam revealed to his staff his intention to con-
duct Operation Due Thang against the objective. Dam envisioned heliborne 
landings in an arc north and west of Ap Bac, from which the troops would 
sweep southward to meet a mechanized M-113 armored company that would be 
moving northward. The US Army Senior Advisor, Lt. Col. John P. Vann, 
recommended that the operation should begin on 31 December, but helicopter 
lift would not be available an this day and Dam decided to postpone it to 
2 January, since New Year's Day was an American holiday. The USAF ALO, 
Maj. Herbert L. Prevost, first learned of the planned operation an 30 
December, and he prepared a plan for fixed-wing air support. Prevost 
visited the JAOC on 31 December and was told that the JGS had committed 
all available aircraft to the support of Burning Arrow on 2 January and 
that no fighter cover or escort could be committed for Due Thang. Despite 
this information, the USArmy' 93d Helicopter Company agreed to go ahead 
with the heliborne operations, with one HU-1B and four HU-1A armed heli-
copter gunships to be used for cover and escort. In final briefings on 
1 January 1963, Major Prevost reiterated that no fighter support would be

available for Duc Thang, but he suggested that in an emergency the JAOC 
might respond to immediate air support requests from the 7th Division. 
Prevost also informed the JAOC that Operation Due Thang was going to be 
conducted on 2 January. His telephone call to the JAOC was informal and 
was prompted by his concern that the operation was going to be conducted 
without tactical air support. He also hoped that some tactical air sup-
port might still be available at a last moment.(36) 
Where the 7th Division expected to meet a Vietcong company in the 
vicinity of Ap Bac, Operation Due Thang commencing at 0648 hours on 2 
January 1963 was instead opposed by a well-trained Vietcong battalion, 
armed with several heavy machine guns and a number of automatic rifles, 
and well dug in under tree lines bordering the selected helicopter 
landing zones. The first three helicopter lifts from Tan Hiep airfield 
landed ARVN companies in the northern arc positions at 0703, 0910, and 
0935, but the Vietcong opened a strong fire against the fourth H-21 lift, 
shooting down an H-21. The HU-I gunships began to attempt to suppress 
the enemy fire, expending altogether 8,400 rounds of .30-caliber and 
7.62-mm. machinegun amnunition and 100 x 2.75-inch rockets. Another H-21 
that was attempting to rescue the crew of the downed helicopter was shot 
down, and an 1W-1B was disabled and crashed. Two other disabled H-21s 
also went down before they could return to Tan Hiep. At 1005 hours, the 
VNAF L-19 over Ap Bac sent an immediate air support request to the JAOC, 
which responded to the emergency by diverting two AD-6s that had been 
armed for strafing attacks in Tay Ninh province. These planes arrived 
at 1035 and thereafter the JAOC kept either B-26s or T-28s continuously 
active in the Ap Bac area. These planes were also armed for strafing 
and were unable to quiet the Communist guns. At about 1540 a Fart Gate 
B-26 came in with heavy ordnance, and its multiple runs with napalm, bombs, 
rockets, and guns broke the Vietcong defense positions at the edge of Ap 
Bac village. In the meantime, the Vietcong battalion had won the ground 
battle. The armored M-113 company was put out of action when the Viet-
cong concentrated fire against unprotected gunners an the amphibious 
vehicles. ARVN heliborne forces were pinned down by enemy fire. At noon 
the ARVN IV Corps commander, Brig. Gen. Huynh Van Cao, and the US Army 
Senior Corps Advisor, Colonel Daniel B. Porter, Jr., arrived at Tan Hiep, 
and Colonel Porter with support from Vann and Dam proposed that ARVN 
paratroops be called for an dropped east of Ap Bac to close the unguarded 
escape route open to the Vietcong. In mid-afternoon, Cao asked for a 
company of paratroops and at the JGS General Ty provided three companies. 
At 1610 hours the JOS directed that the paratroops be dropped; 319 troopers 
were assembled at planesides at Tan Son Nhut; the six C-123s of the 
immediate-response "Fire Brigade" force blocked at 1740 hours; and the 
drop took place at 1815 hours; but at Cao's order the drop zone was to 
the west of Ap Bac rather than to the east. During the night hours of 2/3 
January, the separate groups of ARVN troops engaged in fire fights with 
each other, while the Vietcong battalion escaped with all of its wounded 
and all but four of its dead. As ARVN troops moved cautiously into Ap Bac 
on 3 January, advance elements came under short round fire of friendly

4.2-inch mortars, losing 5 killed and 14 wounded. In the final reckoning, 
65 1BVN and 3 US advisors were killed, 100 ARVN and 6 US advisors were 
wounded; 14 helicopters were hit by enemy fire and five were shot down. 
The South Vietnamese captured two Vietcong, found four bodies, and 
estimated that 101 of the enemy were killed. In a briefing of the opera-
tional results, Lt. Col. Vann recommended that several ranking ARVN 
officers should be relieved from oommand, and he would continue to 
criticize the decision to drop the paratroops west of Ap Bac, saying to 
newsmen: "They chose to reinforce defeat rather than try for victory. "(37) 
In the Communist assessment the battle at Ap Bac was a major turning 
point in the war in South Vietnam. It provided Vietcangtroops with an 
indication that they could stand and fight against the American heli-
copters and M-113s. The Communist leaders at Ap Bac took credit for the 
development of a new tactic of the deliberately invited battle and defeat 
of government forces: a tactic described as "wipe-out-enemy-posts-and-
annihilate-enemy-reinforcements." The tactic would be used in numerous 
battle to follow in the Delta and almost always to good advantage.(38) 
The outcome of the battle and the press reports about it produced serious 
mistrust between Americans and Diem's government. Initial press reports 
by American newsmen stated that American advisors had been killed while 
attempting to lead ARVN troops who would not follow or fight. These 
reports gave the impression that embarrassed President Kennedy, whose 
State of the Union message to Congress an 14 January 1963 would declare 
that the spearhead of aggression had been blunted in South Vietnam. The 
reports also embittered South Vietnamese leaders. In a conversation with 
Admiral Felt on 9 January, Minister Thuan and General Ty professed amaze-
ment about the press coverage of Due Thang. Thuan complained that 
American correspondents lere only dnterested in splashing news on the 
front pages when Americans got hurt. He also told Felt that he had been 
present at General Cao's command post on 4 January and had been surprised 
to hear the US Advisor openly criticizing Cao's decision in regard to the 
employment of the paratroops. In another revealing nuance, Madam Ngo 
Dinh Nhu recalled American press reporting of the earlier Presidential 
palace bombing incident, when she and her Children had been in grave 
danger and the news stories, in her opinion, revealed an 'Till-concealed 
regret that the bombing had failed in its objective."(39) 
Arriving in Saigon an 8 January for three days of conferences, Admiral 
Felt was strongly critical of the unescorted helicopter operation at Ap 
Bac. He suggested to General Ty on 9 January that the Joint General Staff 
should iSSUB an order similar to the order an convoy cover and requiring 
fixed-wing air support for all heliborne operations. General Harkins 
insisted, however, that the helicopters at Ap Bac had not been shot down 
because of a lack of air cover and argued that with the limited number of 
tactical aircraft available in South Vietnam mandatory air cover simply 
could not be provided for every heliborne operatian.(40) Next day at MACV 
headquarters, Felt bluntly stated that the Dug Thang heliborne attack

should never have been conducted without fixed-wing air support and 
that it was time that people learned that armed helicopters were not 
an adequate substitute for fixed-wing support. Before departing for 
Bangkok on 11 January, Felt took Anthis aside and told him that he 
had put on the "show" at MACV for definite purposes, a remark which 
Anthis understood to man that Felt wanted to emphasize that the Army 
was not giving proper recognition to air activities.(41) In line with 
Felt's remarks, General Anthis formally recommended to General Harkins 
on 16 January exact procedures to insure that ARVN commanders and US 
Army helicopter company commanders would coordinate all heliborne assault 
operations with the JAOC and locally-responsible ASOC; that every heli-
borne landing would be protected and preceded immediately by fighter 
aircraft; and that MACV instructions governing heliborne operations 
should be modified to require fighter escort for all heliborne operations, 
as well as prior coordination of the operations with the JAOC and res-
ponsible ASOCs.(42) 
At a meeting on 7 January the US Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed that 
General Earle G. Wheeler, US Army Chief of Staff, should lead a team of 
senior representatives to South Vietnam to obtain an up to date assessment 
of the situation. Upon arriving in Vietnam on 16 January, the Wheeler 
team was interested in a broad assessment of the situation and did not 
take a detailed look at Duc Thang. In response to questions put to him 
at a wrap-up session, General Harkins informed General Wheeler that he 
did not =eider that he required stronger Air Force representation on 
his staff: if the Air Force got permission to assign a lieutenant general 
as MACV deputy commander, Harkins said it would be a waste of good talent. 
Harkins professed satisfaction with air organization, and Anthis told 
Wheeler that he had info/111(3d Harkins of changes that he considered to be 
needed, more snecifically the definite requirement that the JAOC must be 
completely informed on US Army air activities. Harkins insisted that the 
Mohawks ought to be allowed to carry rockets, and that the rule whereby 
armed helicopters were restricted to returning fire only when fired upon 
was too restrictive. Wheeler agreed with this. In other remarks, Wheeler 
indicated that his team agreed that the TAGS must be fully informed of all 
military air operations in South Vietnam.(43) Lt. Gan. David A. Burchinal, 
the senior USAF representative on the Wheeler team, urged that US Army 
representatives ought to be assigned to the ASOCs$ that air planning 
should be accomplished jointly with ground planning, and that there should 
be mandatory reports of all air operations to the JAOC. The Wheeler team 
report, however, noted that the JAOC aught to be "fully exploited," with 
the proviso that this did not imply centralized control of all aviation 
assets, certain of which would continue to be more appropriately controlled 
at lower organizational levels of the army and air structures. The team 
report also noted that South Vietnam was in a large measure "a special 
situation," which ought to be approached not in terms of "textbook solutions" 
but with a possible view to "new techniques and different applications." The 
Wheeler report also recommended change in the rule limiting armed helicopters 
to return fire in self defense: on 17 February the Joint Chiefs of Staff

accepted the recommendation, authorizing US helicopters "to engage 
clearly identified Viet Cong elements which are considered to be a 
threat to the safety of the helicopters and. their passengers. 't(4) 
In November 1962 Admiral Felt had insisted that the Mohawk armed 
reconnaissance aircraft should not be armed with rockets or used in 
an offensive role, but after the Wheeler team visit he relaxed this 
earlier stand and permitted the Mohawks to be armed with 2.75-inch 
rockets.(45) 
During the visit to South Vietnam, the Wheeler team also examined 
the MAOV National Campaign Plan, and the Wheeler team report generally 
endorsed the planning concept, which involved "many small operations, 
with decentralized control" which would be undertaken "at an accelerated 
pace by each corps, division, and sector commander in his own area."(46) 
The Wheeler team noted that the tempo of small operations had reached 450 
a month and would substantially increase in the months to come. The team 
report expressed confidence that the NCP provided for adequate coordina-
tion of political, economic, and military operations. On tha other hand, 
Roger Hilsman and Michael Forrestal made a visit to Southeast Asia at 
President Kennedy's recommendation in December 1962, and were critical of 
"elaborate, set-piece" military operations and of the fact that it was 
difficult to be sure that air power was being used "in a way that minimizes 
the adverse political effects." Hilsman and Forrestal informed President 
Kennedy that the large US effort in South Vietnam was being managed by a 
multitude of people without any real over-all direction. They recommended 
that a single strong executive -- possibly the right kind of general but 
even better a major civilian public figure -- should be appointed as US 
ambassador and given authority to dominate all departments and agencies. (L7) 
Said to reflect the views of Hilsman and Forrestal, a State Department 
paper released under the authority of Under Secretary Harriman an 22 March 
endorsed the employment of air transport planes and helicopters to increase 
RVNAF mobility, the use of air to relieve units, posts, and hamlets under 
attack, aerial reconnaissance, and possibly close air support of government-
initiated offensive operations. The paper was very critical of air inter-
diction operations, Which were described as basically a conventional war 
concept, requiring clearly defined hostile territory that did not exist 
within South Vietnam. Although the Wheeler team report endorsed emphasis 
on small unit operations under decentralized control, the Department of 
Defense would not concur in the Harriman paper, but Harriman sent it to 
Ambassador Molting for a response. Ambassador Nolting prepared a fully 
factual evaluation of the conduct of air operations in Vietnam, and his 
reply to Harriman and Hilsman supported the continuation of air inter-
diction missions under careful controls to prevent accidental air strike 
damage. (48) 
The defeat at Ap Bac, particularly the press reporting of the US 
advisory role in the combat there, produced new guidance affecting plans 
for air capabilities to support the National Campaign Plan. When General 
Harkins briefed Admiral Felt on 10 January concerning aviation require-
ments to support the NOP, Felt, more or less heatedly, tore the briefing 
apart. Felt said that the proposed USAF tactical augmentation ignored 
the fact that the United States was training the Vietnamese and not 
:113

SECRET 
fighting the war in South Vietnam and that the augmentation would be 
intolerable to President Kennedy's administratian. If the analysis of 
air requirements was correct, Felt said that it proved that the National 
Campaign Plan was not feasible and aught to be revised. Felt also sug-
gested that USAF could not support the proposed tactical augmentation, 
that MACV had given him canflicting stories about the capability of 
South Vietnamese air bases to support additional aircraft, and he remarked 
that in order to get General Taylor's approval for the limited Farm Gate 
augmentation which President Kennedy had accepted on 31 December 1962 he 
had assured General Taylor that he would not be requesting an additional 
augmentation of USAF units.(49) On the other hand, the Wheeler team was 
more sympathetic to an effort to provide the aviation forces considered 
necessary to support the NCP, and before leaving the theater General 
Wheeler remarked that the matter of providing Mohawks and Caribou trans-
ports for the support of the US Army Special Forces was "still up for 
grabs." Wheeler pointed out to Felt that the Secretary of Defense had 
not prohibited US Army special warfare aviation detachments: if the 
Special Forces in Vietnam required organic Army air support, CINCPAC 
should feel free to recommend this to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.(50) 
As will be seen the National Campaign Plan would not be revised to 
reflect reductions in planned requirements for aviation support, but 
rather efforts would be made to improvise aviation capabilities to support 
the ambitious plan. As general guidance, Washington policy continued to 
play down the role of the United States in the war effort and to seek to 
turn the conflict over to the South Vistnamese. Already concerned about 
news reports of US combat air activities in Vietnam, Secretary Rusk was 
additionally anxious on 2 February, when Hanoi called upon the Vietnamese 
International Control Commission to secure the withdrawal of USAF air units 
which it said were "playing a key role" and causing widespread damage in 
South Vietnam. On 15 February Rusk conceded that American reporters could 
not very well be prevented from witnessing US operations, but he demanded 
that the Embassy and MACV would give out no information relative to US 
combat air operations because the United States ought not to accuse itself 
of violating the Geneva accords or give the Communists an excuse for overt 
escalation of the hostilities.(51) Later in February, US news media 
carried stories that US helicopters were authorized to fire upon identifi-
able Communist concentrations. Secretary McNamara refused to discuss the 
matter other than to say that US military personnel were under instructions 
to fire only when it was necessary in the interest of their own safety. 
Rusk reiterated: "Our policy remains that American role in Vietnam be 
strictly limited to advisory, logistic, training functions."(52) 
3. Improvisations of Air Control Systems and Air Capabilities  
In World War II and Korea, the US Army had not possessed significant 
numbers of organic aircraft in field units and had taken an active interest 
in making theater air control and allocation systems function most effectively. 
But in Vietnam the arrival of US Army organic aviation units presented General 
Anthis with an entirely new situation which he described as being one in which

.." 
he had to attempt to "sell" kir Focce support to the try, which was "a 
customer that is also a competitor."(53) Mindful that the US mission in 
South Vietnam was to make a maximum development of the scarce capabilities 
of the Vietnamese kir Force and that available air facilities in South 
Vietnam were quite limited, Admiral. Felt and General O'Donnell fully 
accepted the Wheeler team's recommendation that the Joint Air Operations 
Center and the Joint Airlift Coordination Board should be "fully exploited" 
to plan and program the joint US Army-USAF air effort in Vietnam. (5t) Con-
fident that OCMUSMACV shared this same "common ground" as to how aviation 
should be controlled, General O'Donnell wrote Harkins an 8 March 1963, 
asking him to make a proper use of the Air Operations Center and the 
tactical air control system to ensure unity or the air effort in Vietnam. 
"Until the Army air effort joins the club, with the intent to cooperate 
wholeheartedly in the achievement of valid operational objectives," 
O'Donnell wrote, "there will not be unity in the air effort. "(55) 
In an effort to improve the responsiveness of the tactical air 
control system, a team of officers -- including Generals Anthis and 
Khanh, Colonel Hien, and other MACV and HVNAF officers -- had visited 
II CTZ units down to the battalion level in November 1962 and had 
determined that the chief defect in the TAGS was the inability of ARVN 
administrative communications to pass air support requests to the ASOCs. 
The ARVN communications moved air support requests very slowly at best 
and often the requests were lost somewhere in transit and never reached 
the ASOC. (56) Air-ground maneuvers conducted by the US Strike Command 
in the United States during 1962 had recommended that the United States 
should return to organizational procedures used in World War II whereby 
air request communications down to Army battalion levels should be .owned 
and manned by the Air ForCe.(57) In order to get needed field communica-
tions for USAF ALOs and FACs, USAF provided the 2d Air Division in the 
winter of 1962-63 twenty contingency teams, each with an airman operator 
and a commercial KWM-2A single-sideband "suitcase" radio. When accom-
panied by a contingency team, an ALO or FAC had quick radio communication 
to the ASOC; he could insure that requests for air support passed through 
ARVN channels reached the ASOC, and if the emergency were appropriately 
serious the ALO/FAC radios could be uaed to request immediate air support 
directly from the ASOC. This contingency "information" capability was not 
up to the standard to be expected in the required ARVN air request net, 
and there were not enough of the 1W111-2A radio sets to provide them to each 
ALO/FAC. After the visit to II CTZ, Anthis -formally recommended to the 
JOS that an air request net be established within the ARVN.(58) 
It was General O'Donnell's view that the tactical air control system 
had proved its value during the battle for Ap Bac, when strike aircraft 
had been diverted to support the defeated ARVN forces. With additional 
communications -- either an ARVN or a STRICOM air request net -- the TACS 
could be made sufficiently flexible to support the decentralized National 
Campaign Plan in South Vietnam. General Harkins did not agree. In let-
ters to Felt and O'Donnell on 22 March, Harkins stated that the geography 
and the imperfect communications in South Vietnam ruled out any concept

of direct centralized control of the total air effort from the central 
j.A.OG. Harkins intended to commit deployed VNAF-USAF air strike teams to 
the specific support of the CTZs in which they were based and to place 
them under the direct control of the ASOC in the CTZ where they were 
located. The main effort of the JACC would be to redistribute strike 
potential among the several CTZs in response to the tempo of local opera-
tions and in consonance with the priorities established by the JGS-JOC.(59) 
In March MACV established a Flight Service Network, hubbed by a Flight Ser-
vice Center continuously located with the CRC at Tan Son Nhut, and 
Harkins argued that a mandatory requirement that all military air flights 
be reported to the flight following service would satisfactorily meet 
Admiral Felt's. directive that the MACV air component commander possess 
"coordinating authority" over all air operations in South Vietnam. In a 
conversation on 27 April, General Moorman pressed Harkins to state a 
requirement for the ARVN air request net. Harkins assured Moorman that 
such a requirement would be forthcoming, but it was not.(60) 
Seeking a settlement of the air organizational problem on 20 May, 
Admiral Felt informed Harkins that all USAF assets in South Vietnam must 
be operated under the TACS, with the Air Operations Center assigning or 
allocating the air resources to the ASOCs, which, in turn, would directly 
commit and control the resources for whatever period of time the AOC made 
them available. Felt also suggested that Harkins could place US Army air . 
units under the TACS, but that in any event operations of the units would 
have to be coordinated through the TACS in order to prevent mutual inter-
ference,.to facilitate flight following, to simplify air defense identifica-
tion problems, and to provide for offensive combat support when the tactical 
situation so required.(61) Harkins did not agree that he could place non-
USAF air units under the TACS because, he said, the TACS did not possess 
sufficient common communications to provide precise coordination of all air 
activities throughout South Vietnam. Instead, Harkins accepted a task 
organization and management plan for US Marine and US Army aviation resources 
prepared by the MACV J-3, Maj. Gen. Richard G. Stilwell, Which was briefed 
on 7-8 June and issued as MACV directive an 8 July. This task organization 
placed general supervision over allocations of Army and Marine aviation in 
the MACV J-3 Army Air Operations Section, but brigaded all Army and Marine 
aircraft under aviation headquarters in each CTZ headquarters: specifically 
a Marine headquarters in the I CTZ and Army aviation battalion headquarters 
in the II, III, and IV CTZs. Working through the commanders of the aviation 
headquarters, the Corps Senior Army Advisors would plan, direct, and control 
the employment of all US Army and Marine Corps aviation units and aircraft 
operating in direct support of their respective corps. Harkins also issued 
strict orders that Army and Marine aviators must scrupulously comply with 
flight following rules to the full extent of their communications capabilities. 
General Anthis did not concur in this aviation organization plan and asked 
General Harkins not to approve it, stressing that the new arrangement would 
result in at least two and probably five separate air control systems -- and 
separate air wars -- within the limited area of South Vietnam. But Harkins

replied: "Letts give these things a three or four month trial and if it 
doesn't work out we will change it." Within a few months Anthis' pre-
dictions about separate control systems proVed correct: General Harkins 
(who had not stated a MACV requirement for an ARVN tactical air request 
net) approved a request for experimental command communication nets 
within the CTZs for controlling ArmY and Marina aviation.(62) 
During its survey of the situation in South Vietnam, the Wheeler 
team was skeptical of the MACV requirements for transport airlift in 
addition to the 31 VNAF C-47s, 36 USAF C-123s, 16 US Army Caribous, and 
16 US Army U-1A Otters that were already present. Both Wheeler and Felt 
were apprehensive that additional transport aircraft would overburden the 
limited air facilities, and the Wheeler team report recommended that MACV 
"fully exploit" the Southeast Asia Airlift System and the Joint Airlift 
Coordination Board mechanism to secure a greater utilization from avail-
able transport airframes. The report also offered General Harkins a team 
of airlift experts who would be abaB to get increased results. As has 
been seen, the C-123s were not being fully utilized: practically all air 
transport movements radiated with Cargo out of Saigon and the C-123s 
frequently returned home empty. The US Army, moreover, wanted its 
Caribous and Otters deployed in direct support of the CTZs rather than 
to be committed to the common-user airlift system. At the time of the 
Wheeler visit, PACAF was additionally concerned that General Osmanski's 
NCP airlift plan -- with three stages of airlift and consequent transfers 
of cargo -- would be inefficient.(63) Admiral Felt took no action on the 
MACV reqUest for airlift augmentation until be sent a member of his staff 
to Vietnam to examine prospective Airbase loadings. In late January, Felt 
informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff that better utilization could be made 
of available airlift resources in Vietnam, but he requested deployment of 
an additional C-123 squadron and another Caribou company, provided the 
latter and the Caribou company already in Vietnam were included in the 
established airlift system. In order to replace the Caribous assigned to 
US Army Senior CTZ advisors, Felt asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff for an 
additional platoon of light transport Otters, which would be employed in 
the CTZs. Felt's recommendation in regard to the C-123s reflected planning 
actions at PACAF, where note was taken of the fact that MACV NCP airlift 
projections had been scaled down fram 36,000 to 24,000 tons per month. 
PACAF also demonstrated that an increase of tie C-123 aircrew/aircraft 
ratio to 1.5/1 would provide added airframe utilization, thus reducing the 
immediate need for the second of the two additional C-123 squadrons requested 
by MACV. (64) 
In a message to General Wheeler on 1 February, General Harkins declined 
to accept service of a team of USAF airlift experts, and he agreed to place 
the Caribous under the SEAAS when additional Otters arrived.(65) Based upon 
Admiral Felt's recapitulation of airlift requirements made on 23 February, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended and Secretary McNamara approved the 
deployment of an additional C-123 squadron to Da Nang to be operational in 
May 1963, the increase in C-123 crew manning recommended by PACAF so as to

permit the C-123s to operate at a rate of 60 hours a month for each air-
craft, and the alerting of a fourth C-123 squadron to be on standby status 
in the United States for deployment if it were needed. The Washington 
authorities also directed deployment of eight Otters, 16 0-1A liaision 
aircraft, and 10 UH-1B helicopters, these for assignment in direct support 
of the CTZs, one mission, as will be seen, being to provide service to the 
Army Special Forces. An additional Caribou company was approved for 
deployment to South Vietnam provided MACV found it necessary to airlift 
POL during the NCP. At Admiral Felt's direction shipment of the heavy 
equipment for this Caribou company was begun by sea, with the idea that 
the planes would be deployed by air if they were required.(66) 
During March and April projected monthly NCP airlift tonnages did 
not reach projected estimates, and the arrival of the USAF 777th Troop 
Carrier Squadron at Da Nang with 16 C-123s on 17 April increased SEAAS 
airlift capabilities. In May, MACV reduced the monthly NCP airlift pro-
jections from 24,000 tons to 16,500 tons, but General Osmanski continued 
to insist that his airlift estimates would become realistic and that MACV 
had a reuirement for the three squadrons of C-123s and the additional 
company of Caribou aircraft. Where General Harkins had agreed that the 
Caribous would be placed under the SEAAS, CINCARPAC in Hawaii objected to 
this, urging Admiral Felt to recognize that the US Army had purchased the 
Caribous in order to provide a short take off and landing plane that would 
be immediately responsive to Army commanders in combat zones for the move-
ment of troops and critical supplies. Although centralized control of 
airlift might be more efficient for the movement of cargo, CINCARPAC urged 
that at corps level and below immediate responsiveness to a commander's 
requirement was more important than efficiency. During May Admiral Felt 
attempted to hold COMUSMACV to the agreement that both Caribou companies 
would be assigned to the SEALS, but he was overcome by counter argumenta-
tion and accepted the formula incorporated in the MACV directive on task 
organization and management of USMC/US Army aviation resources issued an 
8 July whereby the two Caribou companies were assigned the mission of sup-
porting the SEAAS but one of the Caribou ccmpanies was further required 
to deploy its aircraft within the CTZs for immediate support to corps 
activity. Although NCP airlift tonnage requirements were not materializing 
and it was not necessary to airlift POL, Admiral Felt permitted the US Army 
61st Aviation Company to proceed to Vung Tau with its 16 Caribous early in 
July. Effective on 1 August, the US Anny 1st Aviation Company's Caribous 
were committed to active participation in the SEAAS; the 61st Aviation 
Company was also committed to the SEAAS, but its aircraft were withdrawn 
and divided among the CTZs where they operated under control of the US 
Army Senior CTZ Advisors.(67) 
As has been noted, the organization and requisite force capabilities 
for providing air strike and airlift support for the US Army Special Forces 
(Provisional) Vietnam was still undecided in the winter of 1962-63 and 
negotiations continued in Washington and Saigon. Possibly reflecting HOWZ8 
Board thinking, General Harkins wanted an organic airlift and fire support

unit for the Special Farces, but General Anthis saw no reason why support 
for the Special Forces could not be accomplished through the tactical air 
control system and the Southeast Asia Airlift System, albeit with high 
priorities for support since the Special Force "A" teams would be operating 
with Vietnamese CIDG units in remote areas where they would have urgent 
requirements for air support. Determined in December 1962 to give the 
Special Forces the kind of air support through the TAGS that would be 
"difficult to criticize," General-Anthis assigned a full-time liaison 
officer to duty with Colonel Morton's Special Farces headquarters at Nha 
Trang, and Lt. Col. Charles J. Bowers, USAF Deputy Director of the JAOC, 
impressed upon the ASOCs that Spedial Farces should be given a first 
priority for strike, airlift, and: reconnaissance requests. In January. 
1963, a small VNAF-USAF Sub-ASOC was established in the command post of 
the VNAF 516th Squadron at Nha Trang, the Sub-ASOC being useful to provide 
closer coordination of the activities of the VNAF T-28s, for the processing 
of emergency requests originated by Special Forces, and prepared to inte-
grate Army Mohawk operations into the TACS had this been ordered.(68) In 
Washington Secretary McNamara told the Secretary of the Army to see what 
he could work out with the Air Force in regard to Special Forces support, 
and at a meeting on 8 January 1963 Air Force Secretary Eugene C. Zuckert 
explained that the Air Force did not feel strongly about the assignment of 
liaison aircraft and helicopters to the Army Special Farces but opposed 
an organic assignment of Mohawks and Caribous.(69) When Wheeler team 
representatives visited Nha Trang later in January, Colonel Morton expressed 
satisfaction with the strike and airlift support he was receiving from the 
2d Air Division and he saw no reason why, with augmentation, this support 
could not continue to take care of Special Forces needs. Morton made the 
specific point that he did not want to create a "Special Forces Air Force;" 
all that he wanted was a'"taxi service" of liaison planes and helicopters so 
that Snecial Forces B-teams located at the CTZ headquarters could vii the 
Special Forces A-teams at remote locations in the field.(70) 
In the resolution of US Army Special Forces air support question, 
Admiral Felt wanted maximum use to be made of the Joint Air Operations 
Center and the Joint Airlift Coordination Board, and on 23 February the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the addition of US Army Otters, liaison 
aircraft, and helicopters to the MICV strength which were expected to 
operate under the CTZs and provide the additional services desired by 
Colonel Morton. Under 2d Air Division policy, the US Army Special Force 
teams received first priority consideration when they requested air sup-
port, but Special Forces regulations regarding air strike support reflected 
the proprietary interest of the CTZ commanders in their geographical areas 
of authority. No combat air strike could be requested by an A-team unless 
approved by the locally responsible Vietnamese province chief and all 
requests had to be approved by the tactical operations center (TOC) of the 
CTZ responsible for the area in which the A.-team was operating. Preplanned 
air support requests were submitted through ARVN command channels, but 
immediate air support requests were transmitted directly from the A-team 
to its parent B-team located at each CTZ and thence to the ASOC, which

checked for approval with the CTZ TOC before ordering the mission. In 
view of the red tape involved with preplanned support, the Special Force 
A-teams tended to request immediate 'air support which could be obtained 
more rapidly.(71) Beginning on 27 March and for several days afterward, 
a US Army Special Forces team, working with the responsible province 
chief and irregular force units, requested and received immediate air 
support from USAF air commando crews in an operation in the Seven Mountains 
area of southwestern Vietnam near the Cambodian border. The IV Corps TOC 
processed the requests for air strikes, but the IV CTZ commander had not 
approved the operation, and the Joint General Staff protested that US Army 
Special Forces and 2d Air Division crewmen had initiated an uncoordinated, 
unilateral US air-ground operation without its knowledge or approval. (72) 
The JCS demanded that the Special Force teams adhere to normal ARVN air 
request channels, but after extended discussions a JOS directive issued an 
21 August recognized the Special combat air support requirements of the 
Special Forces. Forecast or preplanned air support requests originating 
with an A-team had to be forwarded through ARVN command channels, but the 
A-team simultaneously passed information about the request up through its 
B-team to Headquarters, Special Forces. Emergency or immediate air support 
requests went from the A-team to the B-team to the ON TOC, and at the same 
time the A-team informed Headquarters, Special Farces, directly about the 
special request and it notified the appropriate CTZ TOC. The informational 
channel permitted the B-teams and the Headquarters, Special Forces, to main-
tain a check and prevent requests for air support from becoming lost in the 
ARVN bureaucracy. (73) 
In the same months that the TACS was adapted to the task of providing 
strike and reconnaissance support for the US Army Special Forces, the 
Southeast Asia Airlift System provided airlift support which Colonel Morton 
reported to be excellent. It their remote operational locations US Army 
Special Forces A-teams and CID& units were chiefly supported by air-landed 
or air-dropped supply. The A-teams made logistical support requests through 
their parent B-teams, Which relayed the requests to the Special Forces 
Logistical Operations Center, this center being located at Tan Son Nhut 
until 1 July 1963, when it opened at Nha Trang coincident with the transfer 
of CID* support from CAS to MACV. The Logistical Operations Center prepared 
cargo packages and manifested them for delivery, either directly to the 
field unit or through forward supply points, the principal one of these 
being located at Da Nang in support of Special Forces operations in the I 
CTZ. At a meeting on 7 March, the Army Special Forces were guaranteed a 
daily allocation of 40,000 pounds of SEAAS airlift, and in addition the 
Special Forces were authorized support by Army Caribou, Otter, and heli-
copter aircraft allocated to the control of the CTZs.(74) The Airlift 
Section of the JAOC had no difficulty meeting Special Forces requirements 
for C-123 airlift, and each day it scheduled Farm Gate C-47s for light 
Special Forces loads and for pinpoint paradrops. According to the Special 
Forces, the C-478 were greatly respected by A-team commanders for their 
dependability and efficiency in the delivery of supplies. When the Special 
Forces Logistical Operations Center moved to Nha Trang on 1 July 1963, the

2d Air Division established a transport movement control (TMC) section 
in the Sub-ASOO there, and it also deployed three C-123s and two 0-47s 
to Nha Trang to handle the bulk of Special Forces supply requests. In 
June Colonel Morton freely stated that the C-123s and C-47s were pro-
viding the backbone of his supply system; he also remarked that he was 
generally unable to rely upon CTZ Caribou aircraft for logistical sup-
port since these planes were not made available an a regular basis and 
were subject to last minute cancellations.(75) 
When 2d Air Division computations of requirements for liaison air-
craft to provide air support to the National Campaign Plan first emerged 
in the autumn of 1962, the requirements produced unusual complications. 
General Anthis justified an increased number of liaison aircraft because 
many strike missions had been delayed or deferred because of insufficient 
FAC planes, because more visual reconnaissance was needed, and because 
there was an increased need for convoy cover.(76) The three VNAF liaison 
squadrons (the 110th at Da Nang, the 112th at Tan Son Nhut, and the 114th 
which was moving from Nha Trang to Pleiku) possessed 52 L-19s, or approx-
imately half of the minimum figure of 102 L-19s which the 2d Air Division 
calculated would be needed to support expanded strike operations under the 
NOP. The 112th Squadron at Tan San Nhut, moreover, was committed to the 
support of both the III and IV OTas, and its strength was spread rather 
thin. Under the VNAF program approved by Admiral Felt another VNAF 
liaison squadron would not be activated until the first half of 1964; 
meanwhile, General Anthis asked that three USAF liaison squadrons be 
crganized and deployed to Vietnam. At the force requirement briefing on 
10 January 1963, Admiral Felt's first thought was that the USAF liaison 
squadrons were out of the question because the Air Fbrce could not provide 
the light planes or the crews for many months. Later in January, however, 
:JT-lt evaluated the requirement and submitted a request for two instead of 
three USAF liaison squadrons, each to be equipped with L-283 or equivalent 
light planes.(77) 
In discussions in the United 'States during 1962, Generals Sweeney and 
Pritchard had made a strong case for the proposition that the USAF could 
not stand the expense of a worldwide forward air control/strike control 
and reconnaissance (FAC/SCAR) program in terms of money and pilot costs, 
and they favored the use of Army forward observers to supplement Air Force 
FACs. On L. December 1962 a USAF program review conference turned down a 
PACAF requirement for Air Force airborne forward air controllers, both 
because of costs and the belief that low and slow flying aircraft could 
not survive in a modern combat environment.(78) In January 1963 the USAF 
Air Staff knew some doubts as to whether the Air Force ought to procure 
the 44 light planes for service in Vietnam, but in view of the fragmenta-
tion of air resources that would reault if the Army performed the mission 
it supported the 2d Air Division requirement. In Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
studies during February, the Air Force took the position that Felt's pro-
posed employment of the two liaisonisquadrons for forward air control and 
visual reconnaissance -- both being Lir Force missions -- demanded that 
USAF provide the liaison squadrons. The Army, on the other hand, considered

that these employments were normal duties of Army liaision squadrons and 
also pointed out that it possessed inventories of Lr-19 (0-1) aircraft, 
while the Air Force had no suitable light planes that could meet the 
requirement.(79) On 11 March, the Joint Chiefs of Staff forwarded the 
two-squadron liaison augmentation requirement to the Secretary of Defense 
with the request that he meet with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and 
the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force to determine the service that 
would provide them. If the squadrons were primarily for RAC work and 
visual reconnaissance, the Air Force ought to provide them; if not, the 
Joint Chiefs were in favor of sending one USAF U-10 (L-28) squadron and 
one Army 0-1 (L-19) squadron.(80) 
The 2d Air Division conceived that the liaison squadrons would be 
employed primarily for FAC-type operations and only incidentally for 
other missions and insisted to MACV that they should be Air Force units. 
But in a teleconference with CINCPAC on 21 March, General Weede estimated 
that only 25 percent of the mission would be FAC-type operations, had no 
objection to receiving one USAF U-10 squadron and one US Army 0-1 com-
pany, and further stated that irrespective of service affiliation, both 
squadrons would operate under the TACS, with the JAOC and AS0Cs allocating 
aircraft employment to satisfy combat requirements. (81) At this point 
Admiral Felt considered that a compromise was in order to get a decision 
that might otherwise be hung up indefinitely; he also noted Weede's 
statement that both of the squadrons would be under the direction of the 
JAOC, even though one would be manned by the Air Force and the other by 
the Army: Admiral Felt therefore accepted the compromise, and on 25 
March Secretary McNamara ruled that one USAF liaison squadron and one DS 
Army liaison company would be provided. In the interest of simplifying 
logistical support, General LeMay further directed that the USAF squadron 
-uculd be equipped with 22 0-1s, to be procured from the Army. (82) 
Even in short retrospect the handling of the liaison squadron matter 
did not give good results. When added to the 52 VNAF 0-1s, the 44 American 
0-1s did not total the 102 liaison aircraft that the 2d Air Division com-
puted as necessary to meet TADS requirements for support of the NCP. 
General Anthis attempted to hold MACV to the commitment that the US Army 
0-1A company would operate under the JAOC, but under the MACV directive 
on Army aviation organization of 8 July General Weede committed the newly 
arriving US Army 72d Aviation Company's 0-1s to meeting specific support 
functions in the four CTZs and authorized any Army 0-1s not so committed 
to be made available to the JAOC and the ASOCs. While the Army 0-1s were 
employed for convoy escort and visual reconnaissance, they were not avail-
able for FAC duty. As will be seen, the USAF 19th Tactical lir Support 
Squadron (TASS) was activated at Bien Hoa an 8 July 1963, but its aircraft 
and aircrews trickled in slowly and the squadron did not become fully 
operational with its main body at Bien Boa and a detachment of six 0-1Ds 
at Can Tho until 15 September. Other factors plagued the FAC/SCAR program, 
these having to do with the draw down of the VNAF 0-1 liaison squadrons . 
to man the additional fighter cockpits. At the time that he authorized

the deployment of the two US liaison squadrons, Secretary McNamara stated 
that the American personnel would not remain in Vietnam for more than a 
year and would turn the 0-is over to the VNAF as soon as it could operate 
them. McNamara would also remark later on the introduction of the USAF 
liaison squadron had been an error in judgment on his part, this because 
the 0-is were in McNamara 's view simple aircraft that should have been 
operated by the Vietnamese. (83) In the programmed VNAF expansion, it was 
in fact expected that expedited in-country training by USAF field training 
detachments would produce quick results. In the case of helicopter 
training, the results were very favorable. An elite group of 12 officers 
and 47 airmen comprising ATC FTD 917s arrived at Tan Son Nhut in January 
1963, began training of 15 VNAF helicopter student pilots in H-19s in 
February, and graduated the entire class in June, thus bettering results 
attained in the United states where 44 percent of VNAF helicopter trainee 
pilots normally washed out.(84) But Air Force preparations to open a 
FTD for liaison pilots at Nha Trang were delayed by lack of existing 
in-house proficiency: 25 Cessna-185 aircraft were purchased for use as 
U-17A training planes, and the 25 officers and 69 airmen Who would com-
prise AM FA) 921R underwent Cessna factory training in July and August. 
These preparations took time, with the result that the Air Training 
Center did not open at Nha Trang until 14 September 1963. The initial 
liaison pilot course accommodated 50 students, with one month preflight 
instruction and three months (80 hours) primary flight training, but under 
this schedule the products of VNAF in-country liaison pilot training would 
not be available before early 1964.(85) 
The completion of plans for increases in air strike and reconnais-
sance capabilities in support of the National Campaign Plan required an 
exacting review of Air Force abilities to support an enlarged USAF air 
commando effort, as well as planned augmentatians of VNAF strength. In 
October 1962, when the requirement to augment Farm Gate's strength with 
5 T-28s, 10 B-26s, and 2 C-475 was under study, PACAF had asked the 
Tactical Air Command to consider an alternative proposal to increase the 
existing 1/1 Farm Gate aircrew/aircraft manning to 1.5/1, thus permitting 
greater utilization of assigned aircraft. The Tactical Air Command had 
such an ability to increase aircrew manning, though it would require TAC 
to provide some craws who did not have- Special Air Warfare Center training. 
These same studies had revealed that USAF would have difficulty in pro-
viding additional T-28s and B-26s for service in Vietnam since B-26s were 
held in a rather scarce category and air planners were casting about for 
SOMA other more satisfactory aircraft type to replace the relatively 
lightly armed T-28s in special air warfare forces.(86) At the MACV force 
requirement briefing in Saigon on 10 January 1963, Admiral Felt refused 
to accept the requirement for an additional squadron of USAF B-26s and 
another of USAF T-28s and instead said that USAF should program addi-
tional support and personnel including pilots to increase the flying hours 
of the existing air commando detachment strength. Felt acknowledged the 
2d Air Division requirement for two additional Able Mable RF-101 jet phpto 
aircraft and two more Black Watch RB-26 reconnaissance aircraft, but he

indicated that as an alternative he would prefer VNAF to be given the 
four jet reconnaissance RT-33s which had long been authorized in the 
MAP. At this same briefing Felt approved the recommended three-year 
VNAF projection to include a second A-1H fighter squadron to be 
activated during fiscal year 1964 and the eventual activation of other 
VNAF fighter squadrons to be equipped with F-5 Freedom Fighter jets.(87) 
Later in January the MACV-2d Air Division requirements were discussed 
with General Wheeler's team. The aviation requirements were further 
refined in these discussions and in negotiations in Washington. 
Given approval by President Kennedy on 31 December 1962, the Farm 
Gate augmentation package of 5 T-28s, 10 B-26s, and 2 C-Las was 
expeditiously deployed to South Vietnam during January 1963. As he had 
proposed to do, General Anthis established a deployed air strike team 
(DAST) of 6 B-26s and 1 C-47 at Pleiku and another DOT of 5 T-28s and 
1 c-47 to Soc Trang airstrip in the Delta. The airstrip at Pleiku had 
been developed with MAP funding during 1962 and could accommodate the 
S-26s, but the unimprovea 3,200-foot runway at Soo Trang permitted only 
limited operations with the light T-28s.(88) In February Admiral Felt 
formally proposed that Farm Gate's manning should be increased by up to 
100 percent and that its aircrew/aircraft ratio be increased to 2/1, with 
additional support as necessary to permit the existing unit to increase 
its sortie rate. This recommendation was accepted by the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, in lieu of the additional T-28 and B-26 squadrons.(89) Where 
Admiral Felt had hoped that the State Department might permit VNAF to 
receive the four jet reconnaissance RT-33s, Secretary Rusk announced on 
6 February that "over-riding political considerations" and "international 
risks" prevented this, and shortly thereafter the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
approved and authorized ah increase in USAF reconnaissance, including 
authority for Farm Gate to possess four reconnaissance configured RB-26s 
and the deployment of two additional RF-101s to Tan Son Nhut, thus giving 
Able Mable six jet photo planes. Two of the Farm Gate planes would be 
night photo RB-26Cs and the other two were to be experimental Sweet Sue 
RB-2614,- especially outfitted with night photo and Reconofax IV infrared 
sensing devices.(90) In addition to the Sweet Sue infrared aircraft, 
USAF put forward an added request for authority to send two RB-57 jet 
reconnaissance planes to Vietnam for testing, aircraft to be equipped 
with improved day and night cameras and infrared sensors. Ambassador 
Molting was agreeable provided the aircraft would have no offensive 
strike capability. With approval in Washington during March, PACAF 
made arrangements whereby these two Patricia liynn RB-57s would be 
operated by the Fifth Air Force's 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron from 
a temporary duty location at Tan Son Nhut.(91) In the developing RVNAF 
MAP projection early in 1963, VNAF possessed the 514th Squadron with 26 
A-1Hs, the 516th Squadron with 23 T-28s, the 716th Squadron which was 
operating 14 T-28s pending programmed deliveries of RT-28s early in 1964$ 
and was authorized to organize the 518th Squadron although A-IH aircraft 
for it would not be delivered until early 1964. Admiral Felt supported 
the follow-on requirement that VNAF be provided F-5 jet fighters, but on 
6 may 1963 Secretary McNamara opposed the introduction of any type jets

into the VNAF both because of political reasons and cost of the planes. 
He directed that more attention should be given to building VNAF transport 
and helicopter squadrons and that proposals for jet fighters should be 
dropped.(92) 
During 1962 the 2d Air Division had been chiefly manned with tem-
porary duty personnel an short rotational assignments that permitted a 
large number of Air Force people to gain personal experience in a 
counterinsurgency environment. Although this was a desirable objective, 
the 2d Air Division nevertheless found it difficult to maintain con-
tinuity of purpose with short-tour people. Moreover, the 2d Air Division 
lacked complete control over the Farm Gate detachment and the Mule Train 
C-123 squadrons which were attached to it from the USAF Tactical Air Com-
mand. In order to increase the USAF manning incident to the greater 
requirements of the National Campaign Plan it would be necessary to draw 
upon Air Force at-large personnel, and USAF therefore agreed in February 
1963 that Farm Gate and the C-123 squadrons should be assigned to PACAF 
on a permanent change of station and that aircrews would be provided for 
a one-year PCS tour of duty.(93) The transfer of Tactical Air Command 
resources to PACAF was accomplished an 1 July 1963. At this time 
Detachment 2A, 1st Air Commando Group (the Farm Gate detachment) was 
redesignated as the 1st Air Commando Squadron. Effective on 8 July, the 
personnel and equipment of the Tactical Air Command C-123 troop carrier 
units serving in Vietnam were used by PACAF to activate the 309th, 310th, 
and 311th Troop Carrier Squadrons, with assignment to the 315th Troop 
Carrier Group, Assault. In the transfer PACAF gained assignment of the 
51 C-123Bs, 4 SC-47s, 11 T-28s, L. U-10s, and 21 B-26 aircraft in Vietnam 
that had previously belonged to the Tactical Air Command.(94) 
While the reorganization planning was in progress, the 2d Air Division 
r-ecc;mmended that the magnitude oifits efforts justified a regulation Air 
Force wing structure and the assi*Imant of regularly constituted units, 
but this was not allowed and the -objective of the reorganization became one 
of preparing a provisional organization largely within existing manpower 
authorizations, that could be expanded.(95) Effective on 8 July PACAF 
orders established the following 2d Air Division unit organization: (96)

In the reorganization PACAF and the 2d Air Division gained command 
authority aver former Tactical Air Command TDY units, but the 2d Air 
Division remained dependent upon other PACAF commands. The logistical 
concept underlying the reorganization visualized that the Thirteenth 
Air Force's Clark Air Base in the Philippines would provide "hard core" 
maintenance and supply support and that the consolidated air maintenance 
squadrons (CAMRONS) in South Vietnam would accomplish only limited 
organizational and field maintenance. (97) The 315th Troop Carrier Group 
continued to be assigned to PACAFTe 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) 
with its headquarters in Japan and attached for operational command to 
the 2d Air Division. According to Col. Thames B. Kennedy, commander of 
the 315th Group, this arrangement appeared more awkward than it was, 
since his prime loyalty was to Ganeral Antbis and he was additionally 
able to draw upon the 315th Air Division for personnel required to 
establish transport movement control offices and aerial port detachments 
required in South Vietnam.(98) One of the major weaknesses in the new 
organization was the lack of a single organizational control aver the 
packets of Able Mable, Black Watch, Sweet Sue, and Patricia lynn recon-
naissance effort. While the reorganization was being planned, Anthis 
and his deputy commander, Col. Harvey E. Henderson, had requested that 
the 2d Air Division be authorized a USAF tactical reconnaissance squadron 
under command of an experienced "Mr. Recce" lieutenant colonel which 
could provide a central control aver the diverse reconnaissance capabilities. 
USAF was not able to authorize the tactical reconnaissance squadron within 
its authorized force structure. Under the improvised arrangement effected, 
the Commander, Detachment 1, 33d Tactical Group had some central control 
aver recannaissance activity, but Colonel Henderson would continue to 
maintain that the 2d Air Division required a properly constituted tactical 
reconnaissance squadron to knit together the fragmented reconnaissance . 
elements.(99) In view of the requirement for organizational flexibility 
in a counterinsurgency environment, the 2d Air Division reorganization was 
slowly accomplished: a 2d Air Division study called attention to the

lengthy time required to prepare, justify, and process unit manning docu-
ments up through Air Force command channels. Colonel Winston P. Anderson 
expressed the same thought more bluntly: "We seem," he observed, "to 
scratch, beg and go through endless conventional channels of red tape for 
everything we get. "(100) 
L. Increasing Strains in US-GVM Relations Affected Military Plans  
After examining the situation in South Vietnam in January 1963, 
General Wheeler's Joint Chiefs of Staff team concluded: "The situa-
tion in SVN has been reoriented, in the apace of a year and a half, 
from a circumstance of near desperation to a caadition where victory 
is now a hopeful prospect." At this time MACV intelligence estimated 
that, through infiltration and local recruitment, the strength of Viet-
cong main force units had grown to 22,000-25,000 men. The Communists 
were also estimated to be infiltering about 500 men a month into South 
Vietnam by way of Laos and Cambodia, but the rata of this infiltration 
was actually undetermined. During his visit, General Wheeler pressed 
MACV intelligence for some hard evidence of the exact extent of the 
infiltration and was unable to get it. In final analysis the Wheeler 
team report noted that the cantinuation of the infiltration of trained 
Vietcang cadremen from North Vietnam was an indication that "it is not 
realistic to ignore the fact that we have not given Ho Chi Minh any 
evidence that we are prepared to call him to account for helping keep 
the insurgency in South Vietnam alive," but it also stated that "we are 
winning slowly on the present thrust" and there was "no coapelling 
reason to change."(101) 
One of the most encouraging marks of progress in South Vietnam 
by the Wheeler team was the marked increase in US military advisory 
strength with RVNAF units from some 900 men at the beginning of 1562 to 
over 3,000 at the end of 1962. At the beginning of 1962 there had been 
no advisors at battalion levels in the ARVN, but at the end of the year 
there were over. 400 US advisors serving with battalions and comparable 
units in the Vietnamese armed forces. The number of US advisors with 
province chiefs had grown from 2 in January 1962 to over 100 in December 
1962.(102) As a result of the buildup of US advisory strength which 
occurred in the first half of 1963 following the Wheeler visit, MACV in 
June 1963 was authorized a total US military strength of 16,652 individuals, 
of whom 4,790 were USAF personnel.(103) 
From the beginning of increased US assistance to South Vietnam early 
in 1961, General Harkins had expected that the culmination of the American 
assistance effort would come in the spring of 1963 by which time he con-
ceived that. the RVNAF would saturate the Vietnamese countryside with 
military actions, small and large, to seek out and destroy and fragment 
the Vietcong effart.(104) As already noted, Harkins wanted the 
"explosion" operations to begin immediately after the Tet holiday on 
28 January 1963, and in the meeting on 9 January 1963 he pressed Diem 
3'2,7

to make good his promise to win in 1963.(105) Immediately after the 
victory at Ap Bac, the Vietcong were not notably aggressive, but Admiral 
Felt suggested that the lull in military action could have "both visible 
_andhick1.anmeann,nirasfore]anintel1igencereportof""ereT. 
January 1963, where representatives of Hanoi, the NLF, and the Soviet 
Union reportedly agreed to a plan to add 12 battalions to the Vietcong 
strength, two-thirds of these troops to be transferred into South Vietnam 
from Laos and the remainder to be recruited in South Vietnam. (106) 
Despite General Harkins' growing impatience, the RVNAF Joint General 
Staff proved in no hurry to begin the general offensive operations. Pre-
pared on the basis of the concepts of the MACV National Campaign Plan, 
the RVNAF General Offensive Plan was not signed out by General Ty until 
22 February 1963, and at this time General Ty directed each of the CTZ 
commanders and the commander of the Capital Military District to prepare 
individual plans for Phase I preparatory operations for submission to the 
JGS prior to 15 March. Implementation of the Phase I plans would await 
the direction of the JGS. Obviously concerned about the delays, Harkins 
wrote Diem a letter on 23 February, calling upon Diem to move swiftly to 
exploit the initiative that had been established over the Vietcong. 
"Time and weather," Harkins expostulated, "are either for us or against 
us. In the high plateau, and in Southern Vietnam, half of the dry sea-
son has already passed. When the wet season arrives, we will no longer 
be able to apply all the mobility and firepower we have developed. 
Between now and then, the VC must not be allowed to regroup or rest. 
We must attack and destroy them. We must hurt them so badly that they 
will be forced to apply all their remaining resources merely to survive. 
If we don't, the VC may /neutralize much of the gain we have won at great 
cost and effort) 
The reluctance of the RVNAF to undertake the General Offensive 
Campaign was only one symptom of "less good" relations between the United 
States and the Government of Vietnam. According to reports reaching 
Admiral Felt, President Diem had became increasingly seclusive during 
1962 and left many decisions to Ngo Dinh Nhu and to the "functionaires? 
within the Saigon government. (108) Nhu and Diem were fearful of US 
policy in Laos as a harbinger of weakening US policy in support of South 
Vietnam. Issuance of Senator Mike Mansfield's report on Vietnam on 24 
February 1963, with its description of a country less stable than it had 
been seven years earlier and "more removed from . . . the establishment 
of popularly responsible and responsive government," appeared to be a 
further indication of weaker US support. (109) Both the Saigon government 
and the RVNAF high command were deeply resentful of the US journalistic 
reporting of the defeat at Ap Bac, and in early March Defense Minister 
Thuan told General O'Donnell that irresponsible allegations of indis-
criminate bombing done by the VNAY were having aflcorrosive influence" an 
the military effart.(110)

At the same time that Diem and Nhu were fearful of weakening US 
support, they also regarded the growing number of American advisors in 
South Vietnam and many of the military undertakingss urged upon them as 
infringements on South Vietnam's nationalism and sovereignty. Diem 
acknowledged the need to arm and organize Montagnard CG units, but he 
was slow to take action on US Army Special Force projects among the 
mountain tribes, probably because these people had always been closer 
to the French than to the Annamese.(111) American efforts to organize 
and exploit human source intelligence appeared logical to MACV since 
human source intelligence promised to provide testimonial evidence of 
the enemy's intentions, but Diem's government did not fully support the 
establishment of intelligence organizations, which in the oriental view 
could threaten the security of a governing regime. (112) Interior Minister 
Luong stated that difficulties arose with the United States because many 
Americans, specifically US military personnel and USOM representatives, 
involved themselves in affairs that affected the internal politics of ;Ile 
Republic of Vietnam. Diem found the activities of the Special Forces, 
Rural Aid Advisors, and Sector Advisors to be Varticularly irritating." 
(113) Even though US economic assietance financed the major portion of 
the counterinsurgency program in Vietnam, Diem objected that US controls 
over South Vietnamts matching counterpart piaster funds degraded Vietnam's 
internal savereignty.(114) 
American relations with the Government of Vietnam appreciably declined 
during the early months of 1963 and becamecritical in April, When Ngo Dinh 
Nhu decried US "infringements" on Vietnamese sovereignty in a series of 
private and public statements. At a meeting on 5 April, Nhu discussed 
relations between the United States, mentioning that US aid came with too 
many strings attached and repeating his apparently long-held belief that 
the United States had supported the November 1960 coup attempt against 
Diem. Obviously acting on higher direction, the VNAF commander, Colonel 
Hien, discussed with his commanders on 10 April the subject of preparation 
for a total withdrawal of US support. Hien announced that VNAF must con-
serve resources, prepare to go it alone, and get ready for hard days ahead. 
In a press interview with an American newsman late in April, Nhu was quoted 
as demanding withdrawal of more than 2,000 US advisors at lower unit levels, 
saying that some American casualties had occurred because the advisors were 
ndaredevils" who exposed themselves needlessly to enemy fire. Nhu also 
repeated the charge that Americans were behind the attempted coup in 1960. 
(115) 
Although the Government of Vietnam made no official request for a 
reduction in US advisors, Nhu's press statement embarrassed Washington. 
On 29 April, Secretary McNamara indicated that he was considering a 
1,000-man reduction in the US force level in Vietnam. At the Secretary 
of Defense conference in Hawaii an 6 May, McNamara stated that a program 
would be prepared to remove the 1,000 US advisors in one package by 
December 1963. The conference also emphasized that US military personnel 
must respect the fact that actions in South Vietnam were controlled and

directed by the Government of Vietnam and that: "This is not a U.S. 
war and personnel being interviewed should not imply the U.S. is 
fighting this war."(116) Secretary McNamara' also emphasized that 
American efforts should be directed toward turning over equipment in 
US units to the Vietnamese as rapidly as possible. (117) As it hap-
pened, the direction to plan a US fotce reduction came before all of 
the additional US personnel and units committed to MeV for support of 
the National Campaign Plan had arrived in South Vietnam. In light of 
this, CINCPAC obtained approval for a policy whereby units and personnel 
enroute to Vietnam could continue onward travel but the MACV strength 
was frozen: other than on a man-for-man replacement basis, any, addi-
tional personnel movements to Vietnam, either PCS or TDY, would require 
special approval. (118) 
Except for the "somewhat less good" relations between the Saigon 
government and the United States, which Ambassador Nolting described as 
not "bad" but "delicate," most indicators in South Vietnam were favor-
able to the Government of Vietnam. Both Nolting and Harkins agreed 
that "the current RNN leadership is the best the US can get. It is 
sincere, albeit not particularly adept, but it is better than most in 
Southeast Asia."(119) USOM evaluations of the political and socio-
economic situation were encouraging. Successful collection of an 
excellent rice crop had improved the economic outlook, and with the 
completion of about 50 percent of the strategic hamlet program, some 
60 percent of the population was sheltered in defended locations.(120) 
During April RVNAF forces reported 900 offensive engagements, leading 
General Harkins to suggest that the Phase II general offensive had 
already started -- a suggestion which overlooked the fact that the 
Vietcong were more aggressive than at any time in the previous year, 
mounting 391 incidents including 128 armed attacks.(121) 
As the spring of 1963 and the sunner rainy season approached, the 
RVNAF provided no definite clue as to when the general offensive might 
be expected to begin, other than suggestions that the long delayed 
undertaking could probably begin on 1 July 1963. On 18 June confirmed 
this date in an order, stating: "Per agreement with the Secretary of 
the Strategic Hamlet Program . . . Phase Two will officially launch on 
1 July, and all ground forces in Vietnam will operate a minimum of 
twenty days out of each month." The "total general offensive" would be 
expected to attain "complete annihilation of the enemy to support com-
plete RVN control. "(122) General Harkins was enthusiastic about the 
beginning of the all-out campaign and convinced that the strategy was 
correct. "The whole idea of this plan," he would say, 'Vas to saturate 
the countryside with RVNAF actions, small and large, to seek and destroy 
and fragment the VC effort."(123) Unfortunately the emphasis upon the 
"total general offensive" would shortly develop into a fatal defect in 
the MACV planning, which had displayed slight regard for Vietcong offen-
sive capabilities. As early as the end of April, the Communists launched 
their own general offensive in South Vietnam, and the war would begin to 
go badly for the RVNAF, which was poorly prepared to resist the enemy 
attacks.

CHAPTER 8 
INDECISivt OPERATIONS AND POLITICAL COLLAPSE IN SOUTH VIETNAM 
1963 
1. Air Missions Under the RVNAF General Offensive Plan  
In the view of the Pacific air commanders, the relatively favorable 
position attained in South Vietnam during 1962 would have been impossible 
without the air operations conducted by VNAF with USAF support. They also 
understood that the VNAF/USAF tactical air control system simultaneously 
provided centralized allocation and direction of scarce air resources 
through the Air Operations Center and decentralized control of air opera-
tions through the Air Support Operations Centers. The system was 
sufficiently versatile to handle countrywide air operations and local air 
support within the CTZs.(1) On the contrary, General Harkins concepts 
of the National Campaign Plan visualized decentralized command of VNAF 
aviation by ARVN CTZ commanders. In the case of nationwide air defense 
Harkins saw a requirement for a central air control system, but in this 
regard he believed that there was little likelihood that the Cammunists 
would send aircraft over South Vietnam. (2) 
Under CINCPAC instructions the MACV Air Force component commander had 
mission responsibility for air defense in the subunified command area of 
operations, and, in addition to this, 2d Air Division officers successfully 
secured a broader statement of VNAF responoibilities i.. the force 
tasking of the RVNAF General Offensive Plan than had been contained in the 
original MACV National Campaign Plan. As issued by the Joint General Staff 
on 22 February 1963, the General Offensive Plan charged VNAF to provide 
special support to CTZs, to provide "unrestricted strafing" of secret 
Vietcong bases, and to perform close air support, air reconnaissance, 
photography, and airlift. The General Offensive Plan included provisions 
for centralized control over VNAF-USAF resources through the tactical air 
control system and decentralized operations from staging bases to provide 
quick reaction in support of friendly ground forces in the corps tactical 
zones and in the special zones. (3) 
The RVNAF General Offensive Plan, however, did not envision a 
coordinated nationwide campaign but instead all-out ground operations 
mounted and controlled by ARVN caamanders in the separate tactical zones. 
The CTZ commanders were charged to prepare operational plans for their 
separate areas. Both in the preparation of these operational plans and by 
controlling requests for air support, the CTZ commanders in effect controlled 
the dimensions of air activity within their zonal boundaries and thus 
throughout the whole of South Vietnam. Thus, early in 1963, air inter-
diction was practically out of the question in the IV CTZ area since the

CTZ commander would not approve such a mission, even against known and 
confirmed Vietcong installations, for fear of political repercussions that 
would result from possible casualties to non-combat personnel. (4) In the 
I CTZ on 2 January, the CTZ cammander issued an order that no air strike 
would be flown in his area without his personal approval, or, if he were 
absent, the approval of his chief of staff. Both men were frequently 
absent from the I CTZ headquarters in Da Nang, making it impossible to 
provide immediate air support strikes when they were requested from the 
field. (S) In mid-1963 Brig General Do Cao Tri was moved to the command 
of the ARVN 1st Division and soon afterward to the command of the I CTZ. 
One of the most determined fighting men in Vietnam, Tri insisted-that all 
aviation in his CTZ should be under his command. He habitually used the 
VNAF C-47 flare ship at Da Nang as his personal transport for flights 
throughout Vietnam, and he required VNAF to assign helicopters and liaison 
aircraft to divisions and task forces on a continuing basis rather than a 
mission assignment basis, thus tying up a considerable nunber of aircraft 
and aircrews and restricting flexibility to meet mission requirements. 
Even though Tri's orders were contrary to standing regulations, the 
relatively low-ranking VNAF persons in the I A50C were afraid to refuse to 
obey Tri's directions to them.(6) Under such command arrangements, a 
countrywide air campaign against the Vietcong was impossible, and as a 
matter of fact the Joint General Staff required advance notice of CTZ 
operations only whenthe CTZ commander required a commitment of additional 
resources from Saigon. 
2. Developments in Air Defense and Air Traffic Control 
In the MACV/RVNAF operational planning for 1963 the only countrywide 
mission visualized for VNAF/2d Air Division was to provide air defense 
for South Vietnam, especially against the feared eventuality that Canmunist 
ilrcraft might make air supply deliveries to the Vietcong under cover of 
darkness. The establishment of air defense radar control centers at Tan 
Son Nhut, Da Nang, and Pleiku, and the addition of the radar at Ubon in 
Thailand, provided high level surveillance over South Vietnam, and the 
rotational deployments of USAF Water Glass F-102s and US Navy EA-1F 
(AD-5Q) all-weather fighters to Saigon provided an interceptor capability; 
but mountain screening prevented overlapping radar coverage at altitudes 
lower than 5,000 feet, the USAF jet F-1028 were only marginally effective 
in low level interceptions, and the US Navy conventional EA-1Fs did not 
have enough speed to react to possible Communist intrusions in areas 
remote from Saigon. In July 1962 a USAF orientation group stated that 
Vietnam appeared "to be wide open to hostile air activity below 2,000 
feet. "(7) During the meeting with Admiral Felt and General Harkins on 
9 January 1963, President Diem stated that ARVN units had found Vietcong 
weapons that had dropped by parachute; although General Harkins doubted 
the reliability of the report, there was nevertheless same continuing 
uncertainty as to whether the Vietcong were receiving air resupply. (8)

In the early months of 1963 Water Glass F-102 teams and US Navy 
EA-1F interceptors continued to rotate to Tan Son Nhut on six-week tours, 
and the unknown tracks they investigated proved friendly. In an expansion 
of the radar coverage, VNAF deployed a TPS-1/10D training radar from Tan 
Son Nhut and established it at BanMe. Thuot, where it went on the air as 
"Pyramid" combat reporting post in February 1963, thus filling in radar 
coverage over much of south-central South Vietnam.(9) On the nights of 
10-15 February, an unusual number of low-level, slow-flying radar tracks 
were detected in the vicinity of Pleiku and Da Nang. The tracks appeared 
shortly after midnight and- disappeared shortly before dawn, and, as had 
been the case at the same season the year before, there was a possibility 
that the Communists were making low-level night flights over northern South. 
Vietnam. Water Glass F-102s and Navy EA-1Fs were deployed to Pleiku, where 
they remained on combat air patrol overnight before shuttling to Da Nang 
in the morning. Various techniques were used, including the dropping of 
flare a in the vicinity of the unknown radar tracks. None proved successful, 
since the targets invariably disappeared from both ground and air intercept 
radars when aircraft approached them. Near Da Nang on 14 February, however, 
an EA-1F finally intercepted a flight of ducks, leading to the conclusion 
that the unknown tracks (and those observed in 1962 as well) had been 
generated by flights of migrating water fowl. (10) 
After the episode with the migrating water fowl, General Harkins 
was more than ever convinced that there would be no air battle for Vietnam 
but, as has been seen, Harkins recognized the requirement for a flight 
following service in South Vietnam. Although General O'Donnell could not 
agree that this service would provide General Anthis the coordination 
authority over air operations requisite to the situation, there had been 
a requirement for a flight following service in Vietnam from November 1961 
onward. As a safety measure, the Ittle Train tranzport squadrons had 
established their awn flight-following network, using high frequency radio 
sets. As a normal procedure, Farm Qate crews reported their in-flight 
positions to the nearest control radar every thirty minutes, but on 10 
January 1963 an Army Mohawk was lost during an unreported flight out of 
Qui Nhon, and more than 250 search sorties were flown before the downed 
plane could be located. On MACV orders, the Flight Service Network, hubbed 
at a Flight Service Center continguous with the CRC at Tan Son Nhut, went 
into limited operations in March 1963, although the system would not be in 
full operational use for a number of months after this. (11) 
The reduced likelihood of Communist air intrusions into South Vietnam 
and the opening of the MACV Flight Service Network raised questions as to 
whether it was necessary or appropriate to keep the Water Glass F-102s 
and Navy EA-1Fs at Tan Son Nhut. At this juncture, General Anthis was 
very concerned about the large number of miscellaneous military aircraft 
(233 planes, ranging from Army helicopters and liaison planes to Air Force 
RF-101s and F-102s) crowded into Tan Son Nhut, which also served commercial 
and civil air traffic. If a jet tangled up with one of the Army planes 
that jammed the traffic patterns, there would be a nasty situation. Anthis 
would have preferred to clear Tan Son Nhut's 10,000 foot runway by moving

out some of the helicopters, but this could not be managed, and he agreed 
to PACAF's proposal that the F-102s and EA-1Fs could just as well held on 
call in the Philippines for rapid movement to Vietnam if they were needed. 
At PACAF request, Admiral Felt authorized this withdrawal of Water Glass 
and the Navy detachment on 21 May,'and at this time the Thirteenth Air 
Force was tasked to maintain a capability to return the supersonic F-102s 
to Tan Son Nhut within 12 hours and the Navy unit was charged to be prepared 
to return its slower EA-1Fs there within 48 hours. The new USAF activity 
was nicknamed "Candy Machine," and the mission was stated to be to "prevent 
the intrusion of any hostile aircraft into RVN airspace."(12) In the last 
half of 1963 no-notice deployment tests checked the ability of Candy Machine 
to deploy on rapid notice, but in these months there were no combat require-
ments for the interceptors in South Vietnam. 
3. Border Control and Air Interdiction Operations  
One of the first tasks assigned by President Kennedy for US military 
activity in South Vietnam was to determine a means to control cross-border 
infiltration, and toward this end had worked to recruit, train, 
and deploy CIDG border control units to be led either by ARVN Rangers or 
US Special Force advisors. In the I, II, and III CTZs early in 1963 
Montagnard scout units backed up by CIDG strike companies manned border 
defenses. Altogether along Vietnam's 900-mile land border, there were 103 
border outposts, manned by detachments ranging in size from platoon to 
battalion. In addition to border defenses, these outposts had a potential 
to support cross-border penetration missions. (13) Since Diem believed 
that the Communists enjoyed sanctuary bases in Cambodia, he was not at all 
opposed to clandestine cross-border operations, but, as has been seen, 
pressure from the US State Department caused the RVNAF Joint General Staff 
to issue an order on 15 November 1962 that no ground or air operation would 
be planned or initiated within a 10 kilometer area on South Vietnam's borders 
without its prior approval. Since this strip of demilitarized territory 
along South Vietnam's borders permitted a de facto Vietcong safe haven, MACV 
considered the RVNAF border restriction to7e-177ipletely incongruous with 
the present and proposed border control plans. "(1J4) 
Although President Diem allowed Admiral Felt to know that he considered 
the border operational restriction to be "worrisome, "(15) both Diem and the 
ARVN CTZs were suspicious of US Army Special Forces activities among the 
tribal people who comprised many of the CIDG border control units. Some of 
this resentment surfaced during the incompletely coordinated US Army Special 
Forces operation against Vietcong forces in the Seven Mountains of south-
western South Vietnam on 27 March-1 April 1963. In support of this 
operation, USAF air commando pilots mounted a pre-assault bombardment which 
the US Army Special Forces commander credited with killing some 150 of the 
enemy, permitting the Special Forces to move into the mountains. During 
continuing ground penetrations into the enemy sanctuary, Captain John Sercel, 
the 2d Air Division FAC assigned to the ARVN 33d Regiment, accompanied the 
Special Forces on foot and directed support air strikes with a PRC-10 radio.

The operation was admittedly successful not only in penetrating into the 
enemy held area but in bringing Vietnamese off the mountains and into 
government control, but, as already noted, the IV CTZ commander, General 
Cao, protested the uncoordinated intrusion into his territory, and new 
OGS rules required Special Force teams to go through ARVN channels to 
secure air support. (16) 
In the aftermath of the Seven Mountains operation, the South Viet-
namese also indicated that they wanted to take complete charge of border 
operations. On 10 April the Joint General Staff announced new operational 
procedures to apply to operations along South Vietnam's borders, almost 
completely eliminating the restrictions that had been imposed on 1.5 November 
1962. ARVN ground forces were authorized to operate up to the border where 
it was clearly distinguished by a geographical feature such as a river or 
road. In other cases, they were restricted to 1,000 meters of the border, 
and along the demilitarized northern border a corridor of 10,000 meters 
applied. Vietnamese aircraft were authorized to operate up to the border 
if it were clearly distinguished by a geographical feature; in other areas, 
air operations could be conducted within 2,000 meters of the border if a 
FAC were utilized or 5,000 meters if a FAC were not present. All operations 
in the border areas were to approved by the CTZs rather than by the 
JGS.(17) The US State Department quickly instructed Ambassador Nolting to 
attempt to get the new procedures suspended penAing a study of the military 
justification for them. In conversations with Minister Thuan and General 
Ty, Nolting and Harkins stressed that border violations seriously affected 
the common interest of the United States and the Republic of Vietnam, but 
the South Vietnamese were unwilling to change their new instructions, which 
went into effect on 1 May 1963. Ambassador Nolting believed that there was 
no question but that considerable eUpplies were coning to the Vietcong from 
Cambodia and consequently had some sympathy for the new border operating 
procedures. Admiral Felt's posiLiud was that border incidents with 
Cambodia were disturbing but that military considerations demanded that 
every possible step be taken to stop the infiltration, including steps 
through diplomatic channels to let the Cambodian government know that the 
United States was aware of the Vietcong use of Cambodian territory and was 
concerned that the Cambodians had not eliminated Vietcong supply lines. 
In a letter to Felt on 30 April, General O'Donnell proposed that USAF 
resources be sent into Vietnam to make aerial surveys of the borders and 
correct map inaccuracies, a project which would yield both civil and 
military benefits. (18) 
The subject of South Vietnamese border control was discussed as an 
agenda item at the Secretary of Defense conference in Hawaii on 6 May. 
Here, summarized the plan to place up to 8,000 men on 
stations at the border, but he did not expect that the Special Forces and 
Vietnamese irregulars could do more than restrict Communist movement into 
South Vietnam. General Harkins stated that the Vietnamese border ought to 
be defined, marked, and cleared, but this could not  be done in the near 
future, and he accordingly agreed with assessment that the

border control posts would hinder and not stop infiltration. The near 
impossibility of stopping infiltration into South Vietnam (and Laos as well) 
at the borders led to a restricted-attendance session which discussed the 
feasibility of bringing pressure on Hanoi to stop the aggression. In 
discussions with President Kennedy during April in connection with the 
situation in Laos, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had briefed a list of eight 
illustrative targets in North Vietnam (Dong Ho! and Vinh airfields, a couple 
of highway bridges, POL storage, the Haiphong thermal power plant, a 
rolling mill, and a chemical plant) which could be attacked by US carrier-
and Thai-based aircraft with the design of convincing Ho Chi Minh that he 
should desist fram intervention. Such attacks would probably cause Chinese 
Communist air assistance to be given to North Vietnam. In the discussions 
in Hawaii, Secretary McNamara indicated that the option of air strikes 
against North Vietnam ought to be incorporated in CINCPAC planning, but at 
this time he directed that  State Department policy decisions which  had 
1-lameered  into North Vietnam should be cleared up/ 
ough Roger Hilaman 
das present at the Hawaii conference an se assessments, he was 
more sanguine about the future of the Special Forces-Montagnard border 
control effort. He stated on 14 May that the canbination of strategic 
hamlets and the Montagnard irregular force units was making dramatic gains 
in South Vietnam. He said that US Special Forces teams were training the 
Montagnard irregular units, which were "patrolling so as to cover the 
mountain trails and choke down the Communist infiltration." He predicted: 
"You have circles; in the center of each circle is a special is a special 
forces team. These circles are getting bigger. When they close up, I 
think you will see a noticeable choking down of the use of the infiltration 
groups. 11(20) 
In addition to the employment of air power against Vietcong infiltra-
tion routes, Admiral Felt held to his conviction that coordinated air 
strikes against Vietcong war zones and secret bases would accamplish 
significant results during the HVNAF general offensive of 1963. He 
accepted the assessment that the Vietcong bases and zones were the "vortexes 
of VC power," which contained the "nuclei of the VC 'governmental' 
structure," served as "protective sanctuaries" from which tactical military 
power was launched, and were "little arsenals and installations" that 
served the need of the Vietcong. (21) Although Felt wanted maximum use of 
airpower against the Vietcong sanctuaries, all air interdiction activity 
under the FUNAF command arrangements depended upon the individual interest 
of the largely independent CTZ commanders, and interdictory strikes had to 
be very closely managed to prevent casualties to non-hostile people. Despite 
efforts of USAF air liaison officers to "sell" interdiction, air attacks 
against enemy targets not associated with AHVN ground operations, with a 
few notable exceptions, declined in effectiveness during 1963. In the IV 
CTZ, for example, General Cao, who habitually feared that air interdiction 
might cause political repercussions, was reluctant to name interdiction 
targets. In one case during Operation Due Thang 4, conducted in Chuong

Thien province between 8-11 February, Cao yielded to persuasion that 
interdiction would be in order: he requested and received two B-26 strikes 
into the middle of a remote mangrove swamp, an area which as far as the 
Corps ALO could determine was absolutely devoid of any human activity. ? 
Other ARVN commanders limited air interdiction strikes to abandoned 
villages from which the people had been removed incident to relocation in 
new strategic hamlets. These interdiction strikes deprived the enemy of 
potential shelter and used up ordnance on aircraft which had not expended 
in a primary mission, but they doubtless were not very damaging to the 
Cammunists.(22) 
During continuing penetrations into Zone D in February and March 1963, 
the PBT Tactical Zone commander, Lt Colonel Dien used preplanned air inter-
diction strikes to good effect as cover and support. These Hard Times 
ranger probes reached and burned the Vietcong Zone D headquarters early in 
February, and early in March they destroyed a number of 'Vietcong camps 
along the Ma Da river. As time parsed, the Communists adapted to the 
initially successful air strikes. In the later stages of the Hard Times 
operations, Diens men found that the Communists had built deep, log-
covered bunkers, and a prisoner stated that the Vietcong counted upon 
attacking aircraft to circle before striking, allowing sufficient time for 
everyone to take cover in the relatively invulnerable underground shelters. (23) 
During March, the USAF ALO and US kimy advisors serving with the PBT Special 
Zone secured plots of Vietcong installations and Obtained approval for a 
sustained assigned low priority interdiction target (ALPIT) bombing program, 
in which aircraft returning to base with unexpended ordnance were given 
interdiction objectives in the PBT Special Zone for attack under the direction 
of a VNAF FAC. These ALPIT strikes Commenced on 1 April, and some were flown 
almost every day. The results were difficult to assess since the targets 
Ilere deep within the jungle, but on 30 April an aerial response to an 
immediate strike request surprised a group of assembled Vietcong. The 
Phuoc Thanh province chief who inspected the area on the day following the 
strike estimated that more than a hundred of the enemy had been killed. 
Vietcong deserters said that the ALPIT strikes created casualties, damaged 
morale, and kept the Communist troops on the move. The program, however, 
probably constituted no more than a harassment. Most of the strikes were 
made by only one or two aircraft; objectives were not based on current 
intelligence since the best average time between agent sightings of Vietcong 
groups and the arrival of their reports at PBT headquarters ran to two days; 
and, in any event, the list of ALPIT objectives in Zone D had been bombed 
out at the end of May. At this time the Vietcong were still in firm 
possession of Zone D, and they continued to collect road use taxes and 
exact tribute from plantation owners for the privilege of living in or near 
the area. (2b) 
Where the air and ranger operations against Zone D were modest, 
President Diem spared no RVNAF resources when, after several months 
planning, Operation Dan Thang 99 was mounted between 24 April and 24 May 
against the Do-ka headquarters area of the Vietcong V Interzone located in

the mountains on the borders of Quang Ngai, Kontam, and Quang Tin provinces. 
The II CTZ commander, Brig General Nguyen Khanh, was in personal charge of 
the operation; five regiments of ARVN troops and two battalions of Viet-
namese Marines (approximately 10,000 men) were committed; and an advance 
party of the II AMC, under direction, of Maj Tran Van Minh, the VNAF 
director of the JAOC, deployed to the II CTZ advance cammand post at Plateau 
Gi to handle preliminary interdictory air strikes and subsequent close air 
support. Flown on 1-3 May, the three-day preliminary air interdiction 
effort committed 36 A-IH, 14 T-28, and 34 3-26 sorties to strikes against 
Vietcong targets, and a total of 115 A-1H, 108 T-28, and 74 B-26 sorties 
were flown during the operation. All requests for air support were honored, 
and the support was described as timely, adequate, and effective. The three-
day bombardment probably permitted the heliborne assault deep into enemy 
territory to proceed without opposition, but the air strikes also doubtless 
flushed the Vietcong, who dispersed into the mountains and generally avoided 
contact with ARVN and Marine troops. Dense foliage in many of the target 
areas hit by aircraft obscured exact mission results, but the air strikes 
were credited with killing 5 Vietcong, destroying 238 structures, and 
damaging 77 other structures. The RVNAF ground troops began to retire from 
the Do-Xa area on 8 May and the withdrawal was completed on 24 May, at which 
time the over-all results of Dan Thang included 106 Vietcong KIA, 6 captured, 
and 1 surrendered. (25) Operation Dan Thang 99 yielded significant tactical 
advantages: if they had not been destroyed, the Vietcong had been driven 
out of the Do-XA area and badly scattered, and they would need several months 
to return, there and again establish Vietcong Region 5, which like the old 
Interzone V guarded infiltration routes to the other Communist base areas. (26) 
In the conduct of air interdiction missions during 1963 both USAF and 
VNAF airmen worked under the rigid rule that aircraft delivering ordnance 
would be under positive control of a VNAF FAC. As a matter of record, 
General tothis considered this a sound precaution and did not desire to 
change it, even though it prevented potentially lucrative attacks against 
targets of opportunity that could have been flown by armed reconnaissance 
missions. VNAF and USAF aircrews staging to and fram forward airfields 
were encouraged to fly low and look for enemy activities, and this activity 
was described as "armed reconnaissance," but these crews were not authorized 
to attack the activities they located unless they could secure assistance 
from an airborne FAC. (27) The rigid requirement for FAC direction was 
aggravating to USAF crews who observed and reported that US Army Mohawks, 
operating under less restrictive rules of engagement, frequently flew at 
altitudes of 50 feet, looking for the Vietcong to shoot at them so that they 
could fire back. (28) The inability to attack targets of opportunity was 
also troubling to USAF air liaison officers, who reported that frequent 
enemy movements made it very difficult to target fixed interdiction 
objectives. In early August, the PBT Zone ALO noted that much of Zone D 
could be certified to be free of friendly civilians and recommended that 
"target of opportunity zones" be established within the enemy-held area in 
which aircraft would be able to attack enemy activities they observed. This 
would allow strike planes to attack targets of opportunity which in the past

had slipped away during the time required to get strike approval. At this 
same time, the II CTZ ALO also reported difficulty in securing good targets 
for preplanned interdiction strikes and recommended that armed reconnaissance 
missions accompanied by FAC aircraft should be scheduled into areas of known 
Vietcong activity to seek out targets of opportunity. If no such targets 
were located the strike aircraft could expend their ordnance on the huts 
and minor structures that were currently being nominated as preplanned 
interdiction objectives. (29) 
Issued on 2 August, a revision of the 2d Air Division regulation 
concerning operational policy and restrictions authorized USAF pilots to 
return enemy air or ground fire directed against them, but, as a matter 
of policy, continued the requirement that day strike targets should be 
marked by a VNAF FAC. (30) At this time, the 2d Air Division was not willing 
to use the self-defense authority as a means of promoting armed recon-
naissance,(31) but in the III CTZ the USAF ALO, Lt Colonel David S. Mellish 
nevertheless secured authority in September to begin a selected counter-
insurgency air targets (SCAT) interdiction program. In this program the 
Vietnamese province chiefs certified target areas as free of friendly 
people and the III ASOC received authority to schedule air strikes under 
FAC control into the areas, each such target area normally being reviewed 
at weekly intervals by provincial authorities to insure that it remained 
clear of friendly people. The SCAT targets were struck on a priority, pre-
planned basis rather than as low-priority, last-resort targets, as had been 
the case with ALPIT.(32) 
The SCAT interdiction effort gave good results in Tay Ninh and Phuoc 
Thanh provinces during October, but Mellish observed that enemy personnel 
concentrations rapidly scattered and took cover as soon as the L-19 smoke 
grenade was fired to mark the target for strike planes. In flights over 
Zone D in unarmed L-19s, USAF ALOs had no difficulty observing Vietcong 
concentrations and receiving fire fram them, but these groups rapidly 
dispersed when strike planes appeared. "Armed reconnaissance," Mellish urged, 
...is desperately needed in wholly VC areas. We have 
extensive areas of III Corps in which province officials 
will guarantee that anything which moves is VC. Viet-
namese pilots should sweep these areas and shoot VC on 
sight. At present, we are ineffective because our 
politically inspired target marking is the best possible 
air raid warning system the VC could hope to have. (33) 
At the 2d Air Division, Colonel Donald H. Ross, Director of Operations, 
personally agreed with Mellish, but he reminded his associates that the 
war was being waged by the South Vietnamese and not by the United States. 
The requirement that air strike targets be marked by VNAF FACs was a 
safeguard against killing friendly people and could not be abandoned. (3L)

4. Successes and Failures in Air Strike Suppprt  
Although General Anthis considered that carefully targeted and 
precisely controlled aerial interdiction strikes against the heart of the 
Vietcong war effort -- his base camps, assembly areas, logistic 
installations -- to be a necessary complement to the RVNAF campaigns to 
clear and hold South Vietnam, he recognized that the over-riding mission 
of the V1TAF/2d Air Division during the nationwide counterinsurgency campaign 
would be to provide unstinting air support to ARO operations. This support 
included close air strike support, aerial cover and landing zone preparations 
for heliborne operations, night hamlet defense, and air escort for convoys 
and trains.(35) During the first half of 1963, the CTZ commanders were, 
in the words of the RVNAF General Offensive Plan, charged to engage in 
operations to "prepare the battlefield to include relocation of Republic 
of Vietnam population. "(36) In the several months after their victory at 
Ap Bac, the Vietcong were not notably aggressive, and the pattern of RVNAF 
operations conducted in the CTZs proceeded according to planned undertakings 
rather than in response to Communist attack. Under these circumstances the 
incompletely developed VNAF/USAF tactical air control system met require-
ments, and VNAF/2d Air Division flight capabilities could be stretched to 
meet programmed needs, but there were evidences of emerging weaknesses in 
the TACS and in air capabilities that would be very damaging in the last 
half of 1963, when the RVNAF attempted the "explosion" operations at a 
time that the Communists were also in full attack. 
During the first half of 1963 most vulnerable South Vietnamese surface 
movements continued to be escorted by overhead VNAF L-19s, and important 
trains and convoys were assigned strike aircraft cover. In this task, 
7TP7 ond UFVC7 ninnos fls 'LI sorties in January-, 142 in February, 174 in 
March, 157 in April, 246 in May, and 152 in June. No convoy with air cover 
was attacked by the Vietcong, and, while it was impossible to say whether 
the Communists refrained from ambushes because of the air cover, the Viet-
cong would be quick to attack motor convoys and trains later in 1963 when 
the movements took place without aerial escort. (37) 
Developed from original Farm Gate tactics, night flare/strike air 
support in defense of friendly outposts and hamlets under attack continued 
to be a most effective employment of airpawer in the counterinsurgency 
environment. In support of the mission VNAF maintained a C-47 flare 
aircraft on night ground alert at Pleiku, another C-47 on ground alert 
at Da Nang, and a third C-47 on airborne alert each night over the III and 
IV CTZ areas, the airborne flare ship answering the earlier problem of 
getting a VNAF flare C-47 scrambled at Tan Son Nhut in less than an hour. 
Where the VNAF thus assumed the flare function, the commander of the VNAF 
514th Squadron persistently refused to accept JAOC frag orders for A-1H 
night strike alert crews at Bien Hoa and Pleiku, maintaining that his 
pilots were not prepared to fly at night. By May General Rowland proposed 
to Colonel Hien that VNAF pilots could be accompanied by Americans in 
night flights. Hien tartly rejected the offer, saying that this would give

the Vietnamese a feeling that they were being "controlled and watched," 
and later in the month VNAF A-1H crews began to stand about half of the 
night alerts. In the conduct of a flare/strike support mission, the 
strike aircraft normally worked under the direction of the VNAF flare 
plane, but they did not require a 7NAF FAC in order to expend ordnance in 
defense of an installation which was under attack. Night close air support 
of friendly troops under attack, however, required the target marking 
services of a VNAF FAC. Success of flare/strike defenses depended in a 
large degree upon the speed with which the incidence of an attack could be 
reported to an ASOC. By May most of the villages in South Vietnam had been 
provided with USOM radios, and the time from an attack to the arrival of 
the attack report in the ASOC averaged about 48.4 minutes, one reason for 
this excessively long time being the short ranges of the provincial radio 
transmitters which necessitated retransmissions of messages, often at 
district, sector, and division levels. Early in 1963 the Vietcong night 
attacks were not persistent and were customarily broken off when a flare 
plane arrived. As a matter of fact, Vietcong attacks against hamlets and 
outposts in this season were not numerous, the night flare activity 
averaging only 33 C-47 sorties a month from January through April. (38) 
In the far northern I CTZ, USAF air liaison officers reported during 
the spring of 1963 that no one, from the CTZ commander at Da Nang on down, 
appeared to be pushing operations "in a more or less status quo type region." 
The ARVN 1st and 2d Divisions considered that they controlled the coastal 
plain back to the mountains. The mountains belonged to the Vietcong except 
in the immediate vicinity of Special Forces camps, but the ARVN nevertheless 
considered that the Vietcong did not amount to more than a harassment 
capability. In making hellborne supply missions to Special Forces camps, 
the Marine H-34 squadron insisted upon enroute fixed wing air cover from 
the VNAF 516th Squadron's detachment of eight T-28s at Da Nang, but 
regimental US Army advisors seldom asked for T-28 pre-heliborne landing 
Zone preparations, apparently becauee the operations were being run against 
platoon-size or smaller Vietcong bands and also because of a belief that 
the preparatory air strikes would alert the enemy to impending landings. 
As already seen, the I CT2 commander or his chief of staff had to approve 
any request for an air strike mission, and periodic reports of 2d Air 
Division officers who visited the IiASOC from January to July suggested 
that the US Army advisors dominated the I CTZ tactical operations center 
and funnelled many air support requests to the two Mohawk aircraft 
stationed at Da Nang. (39) 
In the central II CTZ the area of operations stretched over the 
central highlands, through the central mountains, and into the coastal 
lowlands of Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, And Phu Yen provinces. In the central 
highlands successful resettlement of the Montagnards had deprived the 
Communist guerrillas of ready sources of food, forcing them to divert their 
efforts from military operations to agriculture. Except for one battalion 
on semi-static duty as protection to the II CTZ headquarters at Pleiku, the 
22d Division at Dalat was reported to be engaging the Vietcong in company-
sized independent actions. In the coastal reaches of the II CTZ, the 9th 
Division had became combat ready at Qui Nhon in October 1962 and was

responsible for clear and hold operations associated with the strategic 
hamlet program in Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Phu Bon provinces. The 25th 
Division became operational in Quang Ngai province in January 1963 and 
was charged with the pacification of this single province, which as far back 
as the French colonial times had been a hot-bed of Communist resistance. (1O) 
Air Support activities in the II CTZ materially increased when the eight 
USAF B-26s joined the four VNAF A-1Hs kept on deployment at Pleiku, 
probably because the planes couldipe seen by ARVN officers and were readily 
available for II ASOC employment. But, where the planes at Pleiku were 
readily available to meet air support requirements in the central highlands, 
communications between Pleiku and the division command posts at Qui Nhon 
and Quang Ngai were frequently unreliable and monsoonal weather conditions 
in the mountains east and northeast of Pleiku often hampered flights from 
Pleiku into the coastal provinces. (t1) 
In order to receive ready air support of their operations in the II 
CTZ coastal provinces, the commanders of the 9th and 25th Divisions wanted 
detachments of T-28s or A-Ills permanently stationed at Qui Nhon and Quang 
Ngai airports, as was the case with the US Army Mohawks. In deference to 
the weather problem, two B-26s were posted from Pleiku to Da Nang where 
they received II ASOC frag orders for operations in the II CTZ coastal 
provinces, but the VNAF lacked capabilities or an inclination to operate 
detachments at Qui Nhon or Quang Ngai, with the result that the operations 
of the 9th and 25th Divisions had to be supported by VNAF planes staged 
forward from either Pleiku or Nha Trang to meet pre-planned activities. (42) 
This procedure met endemic complaints from the ARVN division commanders, 
who did not wish to disclose their plans until the last moment. For a time 
in January, moreover, the commander of the VNAF 110th Squadron refused to 
send any L-19s to Quang Ngai because he resented an occasion when an ARVN 
G-3 officer had "usurped the job of a VNAF observer" in an artillery 
adjusting mission. Throughout the spring the 9th Division ALO, Lt Colonel 
Henry C. Meier, protested that the lack of control over VNAF FACs staged 
to Qui Nhon was a persisting problem. Similarly, VNAF T-28 pilots sent to 
Qui Nhon and Quang Ngai usually arrived late for planned operations, even 
with two days' advance notice. Because of late arrival of T-28s at Qui 
Nhon on 12 February, the H-21s conducted a heliborne operation with no 
air cover. TWhen we speak of immediate air strikes in this division," 
Meier wrote, "the ARVN only laugh and I can hardly blame them. "3) 
As has been noted, VNAF aircrews performed well during the II CTZ 
operation against the Communist Do-Xa headquarters area from 24 April 
through 24 May, one of the probable reasons being the close personal super-
vision of Major Tran Van Minh, the very capable director of the JAOC who 
was on temporary duty at the advance command post of the II ASOC at 
Plateau Gi. On the other hand the Vietnamese airmen did not perform 
according to professional standards on 13 June when the 9th Division 
conducted Dan Thang 888 (Phase I), an 800-man heliborne attack against 
Vietcong positions around An Khe, midway in the mountains along Route 19 
between Pleiku and Qui Nhon, The L-19 that marked the landing zone was

late because his observer could not be found at the appointed time; only 
one of four prestrike A-1Hs properly delivered napalm on the prestrike 
run; and the H-21s were required to circle and wait until the preliminary 
air preparations were completed. When Dan Thang 888 (Phase II) was 
conducted in the same area on 15 Juney the VNAF director of the II ASOC 
went to the staging base at An Khe in an attempt to supervise the VNAF 
crews. He was not successful. The VNAF FAC brought prestrike A-1Hs onto 
the landing zone ten minutes early, and on five different occasions during 
the operation VNAF L-19 pilots and observers were not available to accept 
strike aircraft at assigned rendezvous points. The only feasible solution 
to the problems experienced with the VNAF FACs appeared to be the use of 
USAF piloted L-19s with VNAF air observers for FAC duty. (1414) 
In the view of the USAF AI0s, VNAF air crews did not meet professional 
standards in the operations in the II CTZ during the first half of 1963, 
and at times their poor performance jeopardized the success of the RVNAF 
operations.(45) On the whole, however, the combat situation in the II CTZ 
demonstrated marked gains for the government cause. The operation into 
the Do-Xa area disrupted a major Vietcong base. Moreover, efforts of the 
Communists to take advantage of the removal of 25th Division troops from 
their normal stations during the Do-aa operation failed badly. During the 
week of 15-20 April, the strategic hamlet defenses,in Quang Ngai province 
held up against major Communist attacks: the local people volunteered 
information about Vietcong movements, enabling the popular defense forces 
to kill 383 of the enemy as against 33 friendly dead. In view of the 
favorable developments, General Harkins considered that the Communists had 
lost their opportunity to bisect South Vietnam by making a drive from Laos 
across the II 012. In order to intensify explosion operations in the IV 
CTZ, Harkins recommended to Diem that the 9th Division be moved from Qui 
Nhon to a new combat assignment in the Delta.. (L.6) 
In the III CTZ north of Saigon the preparatory operations preliminary 
to the RVNAF general offensive committed PBT Special Zone forces to ranger 
probes into Zone D, the ARVN 5th Division to operations against the 
Communists in Zone C of Tay Ninh province, while the ARVN 23d Division 
engaged the Vietcong bands in the Ban Me Thuot area and also lent 
protection to the somewhat soft hamJets in the same vicinity. Tactical air 
support in the III CTZ was potentially limited because it was necessary to 
divide the L-19s of the VNAF 112th Liaison Squadron at Tan Son Nhut between 
the III and IV CTZs, making for a deficit of FAL services in both corps. 
Availability of communications also affected III CTZ tactical air support: 
the III ASOC drew on USAF and VNAF aircraft at Bien Hoa and supported the 
PBT Zone and 5th Division, but, in recognition of poor communications 
between the III Corps and Ban Mb Thuot, the 23d Division was authorized 
eight T-28 sorties a day from Nha Trang, sorties which were requested from 
and fragged by the Sub-ASOC at Nha Trang. In addition to these communications 
problems, the deeper probes of the 5th Division into Tay Ninh province 
beginning in March 1963 outran dependable land lines of communication, making

it difficult for the III ASOC to keep abreast of requirements developing 
in this sector. By mid-1963 the deficient ARVN air request communications 
impeded prospective air support almost everywhere in the III CTZ. A study 
of the TACS showed that an average of 31.4 minutes elapsed between the time 
that a III CTZ unit request for immediate air support was filed and its 
receipt at III ASOC. After this, VNAF ground alert aircraft required 30 
additional minutes to scramble. (147) In an incident in June the divided 
control between the III ASOC and the Sub-ASOC at Nha Trang produced a mix-
up when two force units engaged against a Vietcong stronghold northwest of 
Phan Thiet each requested air support from both the III ASOC and the Sub-
ASOC, resulting in separate flights of A-IHs and T-28s appearing over the 
same area at the same time, neither knowing that the other would be there. (148) 
In May the III ASOC also began to have difficulty meeting III CTZ requests 
for preplanned air support, principally because of lack of VNAF FAL aircraft 
and crews but also for want of tactical aircraft. Both because of delays 
in getting immediate tactical air support and because of growing turn-downs 
in requests for preplanned fixed wing missions, the employment of US Army 
armed helicopters for fire support became routine in the III CTZ, the ARVN 
staff officers explaining that Thedivisions Would not use VNAF and USAF 
support when organic helicopter gunships were so readily available. (149) 
At its establishment in November 1962 the IV CTZ controlled operations 
in the area stretching through the Mbkong lelta from Saigon to the tip of 
the Ca Mau peninsula, the ARVN 7th Division being responsible for the 
military zone from Saigon to the southernmost channel of the Mekong and the 
ARVN 21st Division, with a command post at Bac Lieu, bearing the respon-
sibility for operations against the Viet Cong on the Ca Mau peninsula. The 
generally flat and water-sodden terrain of the heavily populated Delta 
provinces, where transportation was by criss-crossing canals and only 
secondarily by roads, promised to complicate military operations against the 
elusive Vietcong guerrillas, who were able to bring together substantial 
forces for battles at places and times of their choosing. Land-line 
communications were limited and generally impracticable when command posts 
moved into remote areas, necessitating heavy use of radio communications. 
The Communists obviously monitored the radio communications, and were also 
believed to get information from informers, possibly in IV CTZ headquarters 
at Can Tho. (So) During January and February 1963, the IV ASOC became 
established at Can Tho, and the deployment of five USAF T-28s to Soc Trang 
and a detachment of L-19s from the VNAF 112th Liaison Squadron to Can Tho 
provided locally available strike and control aircraft. (51) In common 
with all of the airfields in the Delta, Soc Trang was a very limited air 
facility: its unlighted, 3,200-foot runway was suitable only for daytime 
T-28 operations. The glide slope was too steep for a T-28 to make a safe 
landing on the runway when it was wet; a T-28 could take off at night or in 
inclement weather but it could not again land at Soc Trang under such 
conditions and thus had to go on to Saigon to recover at the end of its 
mission. In April 1963 the MACV MAP submission included a project to 
construct a conbat airfield at Can Tho to replace Soc Trang. It was estimated 
that the construction of a 6,000-foot runway at Can Tho would cost some

and the project was kept under study in Hawaii. (52) The col 
against the construction of the Can Tho air facility were i-
and the possibility that it might not be ready for operatioi 
Delta was brought under military control. 
In the months after Ap Bac the ARVN 7th Division was nc 
aggressive. The division commander correctly believed that 
had monitored his communications during the defeat at Ap Bac 
required any of his unit commanders who wanted tactical air 
deliver the request to the division TOC, a practice which re.

TOC requests for air support, moreover, were for on-call grc

The initial employment of Eagle Flight tactics in a 21st Division 
heliborne operation known as Due Thang 9/42 on 9-10 April produced first 
evidences of confusion. Preparatory to this operation the ARVN G-3 
requested air cover and support from the IV ASOC without informing either 
the US Any or the USAF advisor and the request made no mention of projected 
Eagle flights. Early on 9 April, Major Burgin learned that an Eagle flight 
was going out without escort; he called for T-28 cover from Soc Trang and 
covered the flight, but later in the morning another Eagle flight went out 
without escort. No one got hurt, possibly because there was no enemy 
opposition. (S9) OperationEuc Thang 10/42 on 19-20 April represented a 
second employment of Eagle flight tactics and produced reports of confusion 
that went all the way back to the United States. In this operation, the 
objective was the Vietcong regional headquarters in western Kieng Giang 
province, located between the Seven Mountains and the Cambodian border. The 
scenario was very ambitious, calling for the 21st Division troops to move to 
the town of Rach Gia by motor convoy on 18 April and to direct a surface 
feint toward the southeast and away from the intended objective, while 
concurrently on 19 April helicopter lifts landed troops to assault the Viet-
cong headquarters. Eagle flights would land blocking forces along the 
probable Vietcong escape route to the Seven Mountains. The IV ASOC was 
requested to provide air cover and support for the helicopter operations 
and also strikes against the westernmost of the Seven Mountains on the 
mornings and afternoons of 20 and 21 April. The plan was basically good, 
but it may have been compromised since the Vietcong abandoned their head-
quarters several days before the assault. Ultimate confusion marked the 
fighter efforts to cover helicopter flights, whose plans changed without 
notice in what Major Burgin described as a "Chinese firedrill" employment. 
On the second day, all helicopter radio frequencies were changed from those 
specified in the frag orders, without notice to Burgin and to the great 
confusion of supporting strike pilots who orbited the area waiting for 
helicopters which often did not appear as fragged and could not be contacted 
when they did became airborne. There was no contact with the Vietcong on 
the ground, but two HU-lBs and seven H-21s were hit by enemy fire. The 
interdiction bombing in the Seven Mountains provided the only real element 
of success in the operation since USAF and VNAF strike pilots claimed 345 
fleeting Vietcong killed in action. (60) 
In evaluating the conduct of Duc Thang 10/42, Colonel Cowee commented 
upon the "whimsical uncoordinated changes in planned helicopter operations 
directly affecting the escort. "(61) A USAF pilot wrote a.letter back to 
the United States expressing bewilderment about the lack of Army-Air Force 
coordination.(62) In an effort to improve communications, General Anthis 
requested the MACV Joint Frequency Coordinating Board to establish standard 
radio frequencies for heliborne operations and to require them to be used. 
The 2d Air Division also assigned one of its KWM-2A radios and an operator 
permanently to the 21st Division ALO, thus giving him a rapid communications 
link back to the IV ASOC which would permit him to manage sudden changes 
in air support requirements. (63) During May an Air Ground Operations 
School orientation team from the United States spent time with the 21st

Division and developed good understandings of the procedures for air 
support at battalion and campany levels. (6)4) Always aggressive and now 
convinced of the value of tactical air support, the 21st Division commander 
insisted that helicopters have air cover overhead before they took off and 
established a new policy whereby the USAF ALO would be in the air over 
objective areas in an L-19 to provide local coordination for air support. 
Where the 21st Division G-3 had previously been content to make a lump one-
time operation requirement for air support prior to a planned engagement, 
he began to provide the IV ADC with timely requests and changes in air 
support requirements while operations were in progress. Pre-strikes, 
escort, and air cover became mandatory in 21st Division planning. (6S) 
As early as 30 April, Colonel Cowee had begun to point out that the 
limited number of tactical aircraft available for the support of IV Corps 
was proving adequate to support the 21st Division only became the 7th 
Division was not very active, and the increased interest of the 21st 
Division in tactical air support introduced still larger tactical air 
requirements. Even with improving coordination, it was still exceptional 
for troop lift helicopters to take Off as scheduled, and the spur of the 
moment activities of Eagle flights were impossible to anticipate in advance 
plans. The only sure way to cover helicopters was to have substantial 
numbers of air alert fighters overhead and to improvise cover and escort 
according to the helicopter actions. In June, however, the 7th Division 
remained relatively inactive, and the 21st Division obtained maximum 
tactical air support for two well-managed heliborne operations. On 14-15 
June, in the vicinity of Kien Giang, Operation Due Thang 19-20/42 employed 
B-26 pre-strikes and T-28 cover and escort, and the successful 21st Division 
troops killed 33 of the enemy (10 by air) and took 30 prisoners. In An-
Xuyen province on 22-26 Juhe, Operation Duc Thang 21-22/42 resulted in 107 
enemy killed (55 by air), 72 prisccers, and substantial captures of arms 
and munitions. "Air support coordination," Major Burgin reported, Nee 
outstanding. "(66) 
In contrast with the 21st Division successes, the 7th Division's long 
neglect of tactical air support became apparent on the afternoon of 5 July, 
when the division commander aimed a heliborne assault against a Vietcong 
force in Kien Hoa province, without a prestrike, fixed-wing cover or escort, 
but relying on the firepower of four UH-1B gunships. The UH-lBs proved 
unable to silence Communist guns dug in at the tree line adjacent to the 
helicopter landing zone, and before the afternoon was over 11 helicopters 
had been hit and three US Army crewmen were wounded. Responding to 
emergency air support requests, a B-26 at 1365 hours, another B-26 at 
1630 hours, three T-28s at 1710 hours, three T-28s at 1755 hours, and two 
AD-6s at 1825 hours took the Vietcong under attack. The Communists with-
drew at nightfall but left behind the bodies of 24 men who were killed by 
the air strikes.(67) After this experience the 7th Division commander 
began to demand and get heavy commitments of tactical air support when he 
attempted operations, and, for this and other reasons, the IV ASOC would 
soon begin to experience a critical shortage of available strike aircraft.

During the planning of the National Campaign Plan/General Offensive 
Plan it was evident that tactical air capabilities to support greatly 
expanded ARVN operations would be austere, and there were manifestations. 
of vulnerability in the air capabilities during the spring of 1963. In 
all areas of Vietnam, but especially in the Delta, the Vietcong increased 
their ground fire against aircraft. At the end of his tour as Farm Gate 
commander, It Colonel Doyle recommended on 6 February 1963 that more 
firepower should be added to air strikes) so that with two B-26s instead 
of one and with four T-28s instead of two the crews would be able to cover 
each other during low-level passes. Loss to enemy ground fire of two 
B-26s during February and a T-28 in June lent weight to Doyles recommenda-
tion. General Anthis concurred with the requirement for larger flights in 
principle, and the JAOC and ASOCs scheduled them when airframe supply and 
demand permitted, but Anthis was unable to accept the practice as policy 
because VNAF and USAF had only a limited number of aircraft and could not 
i-Tford to increase the size of flights at the expense of refusing too many 
-'equests for air support. Anthis also stressed the importance of good 
defensive flying: mutual cover where possible, suppression of hostile fire 
by strafing, evasive maneuvers, and avoidance of exposure to ground fire 
when not engaged in operational missions. (68) If tactical air requirements 
were to be met, the VNAF would be expected to do a good job, and, at the 
conclusion of his tour of duty as 2d Air Division Director of Operations in 
April 1963, Col Winston P. Anderson, pointed up continuing VNAF deficiencies. 
He noted that the VNAF squadron commanders and flight crews "seem to do as 
they please," an observation that was apparent from slackened effort each 
weekend and on holidays, minimum Vietnamese representation in the JAOC 
during early afternoon siesta hours, the reluctance of aircrews to fly low 
enough to accomplish effective FAC and visual reconnaissance missions, and 
fhe continued Vietnamese reluctance to deploy aircrews to outlying 
airfields. (69) 
In his assessment to the Secretary of Defense conference on 6 May 
General Anthis acknowledged weak spots but was nevertheless optimistic 
that the air effort had made progress. Secretary McNamara, however, pointed 
out that the relative proportion of sorties flown by VNAF was no greater 
than it had been the year before and directed that VNAF must assume a greater 
part of the combat effort.(70) In view of Anderson's criticisms and 
McNamara's directive, Generals Anthis and Rowland attempted to "supply the 
adrenalin" to get the VNAF up to a maximum performance capability by the 
time of the expected beginning of the RVNAF general offensive on 1 July. 
During May Colonel Hien made Vietnamese pilots available far night hamlet 
defense flights, and in this month the VNAF generated a new high total of 
combat sorties. Although the number of VNAF sorties declined in June, 2d 
Air Division officers did not observe the beginning of a downward trend. 
Colonel Harvey E. Henderson, Deputy Commander 2d Air Division, expressed good 
expectations when he observed: "In my six months here, I have been amazed at 
the rapidity with which the VNAF have learned and improved their operations. "(71)

Although from the beginning of plans for the RVNAF general offensive 
it had been evident that tactical aviation capabilities to support the 
magnitude of operations contemplated would be quite marginal, the delay 
in the initiation of the all-out offensive had given additional time to 
develop VNAF and USAF strike capabilities and there was hope that these 
combined forces would be sufficient. As has been seen the tactical air 
control system had worked during the months that ARVN was on the offensive, 
but -- although the fact was obscured in generally optimistic intelligence 
reporting -- the military initiative in South Vietnam began to pass to the 
l'ietcong in mid-1963, and the intompletely developed TAGS and declining air 
strike capabilities would not be able to provide highly responsive immediate 
air support to friendly troops under attack or to furnish requisite preplanned

air support for the great number of relatively short and small actions of 
the ARVN that commenced after mid-1963. The resurgence of Vietcong military 
activity began in April, when the widening pressure on the Plain of Jars in. 
Laos may have been designed to cover the passage of other infiltrators 
through the Lao panhandle into South Vietnam before the start of the rainy 
season. (72) The severe political crises which began with the first of the 
Buddhist riots at Hue on 7 May clearly heartened the Vietcong. The number 
of strategic hamlet and outpost attacks increased sharply in June and July. 
Late in July the Vietcong were notably successful in attacking hamlets south 
of Ban Me Thuot and in laying ambushes on the roads leading into the area. 
Intimidated by the Canmunists, the Montagnard people in the area were less 
cooperative sources of intelligence as to enemy activities.(73) Shortly 
before midnight on 16 July, the Vietcong directed 20 to 30 rounds of 60-mm. 
mortar fire against troop housing at Can Tho airfield. Seventeen ARVN and 
US Special Forces troopers were wounded in the 10-,minute attack, and the 
guerrillas escaped without casualties. (Th) 
Viewed in retrospect, key indicators on the insurgency in Vietnam from 
July onward indicated an unfavorable shift in the military situation. The 
trend in Vietcong casualties, weapons losses, and defections went down while 
the number of Vietcong armed attacks and other incidents inclined upward. 
This monthly trend, however, was not immediately obvious. (7S) The focus of 
high-level American attention on the Buddhist crisis obscured the fact that 
RVNAF offensive operations were not developing as envisioned and that the 
Vietcong were scoring military successes. General Harkins was pleased by 
statistics which showed that the RVNAF was approaching 15,000 operations a 
month in July and August 1963, and in a conversation with President Diem in 
the latter month the COMUSMACV expressed the overall opinion that the 
7ational Ca.mpaign Plan was progressing well, although he pointed out that 
many operations were not based upon hard intelligence and made no contact 
with the enemy, the number of night operations was too small, and one-day-
only operations were much too frequent. Be also told Diem that the South 
Vietnamese were failing to patrol deeply into Vietcong areas, failing to 
pursue enemy forces who broke contact, and not taking proper advantage 
of aerial reconnaissance of enemy activities. (76) Beginning in September 
field reports from the operating level revealed that the war was not going 
well and outlined Vietcong strategy. Where hamlets were soft and vulnerable, 
as in the area south of Ban Mb Thuot, they were being over-run. In the 
harder hamlets of Quang Ngai province, the guerrillas infiltrated "activity 
teams" of three to five men inside the walls to persuade the people to 
accept the anti-government "struggle of the Buddhists." In September, ARVN 
intelligence identified the beginning of large-scale, well-planned enemy 
operations in the Mekong Delta, where the Vietcong could bring together sub-
stantial forces at times (nearly always in mid-afternoon) and places of 
their choosing, with the obvious design of subsequently ambushing and 
destroying RVNAF relief troops. (77) As will be seen, Secretary McNamara 
and General Taylor verified to their satisfaction during a visit to Vietnam 
in the period 24 September to 1 October that the military situation was

progressing well, although the political situation in Saigon was highly 
uneasy. (78) On 7 October, General Harkins told members of the House Foreign 
Affairs Far East Subcommittee that the political situation had not seriously 
affected the military effort and that the war was going well. (79) 
In the same months that the heightened tempo of RVNAF operations and 
vigorous Vietcong attacks posed added requirements for air support, VNAF 
and USAF capabilities did not increase as projected but instead decreased,

In view of the peak total of 1013 VNAF combat sorties flown during May, 
the decline in the VNAF combat .effort in June and afterward was inconsistent 
with the manning and aircraft strength of the Vietnamese air arm. General 
Rowland continued to admonish Golonel Hien that VNAF should be generating 
more combat sorties, but Rowland privately observed that Hien, who had been 
so vigorous when he had first taken command, appeared to be losing control 
over the VNAF squadron commanders, who evidently possessed extreme degrees 
of latitude in determining the nuMbers of aircraft to be made available to 
the AOC and felt free to ignore AOC frag orders with impunity. On the 
other hand the Vietnamese air commanders may have been operating in 
accordance with Hienls instructions given in late May to conserve resources 
and prepare to go it alone in the future with reduced American assistance. 
In any event, VNAF appeared far more interested in training than in combat. 
At the end of August the strength of the VNAF fighter detachment at Da 
Nang was cut in half to four T-28s, the 516th Squadron commander justifying 
this action as being necessary in order to release a part of his T-28 pilots 
for up-grade training to A-1H. Similarly, in September, the 514th Squadron 
commander made only an average of nine of his 26 A-IHs available to the AOC 
for daily strike missions and justified this as necessary because he needed 
to use flying hours to support A-IH pilot up-grade training. Although the 
new VNAF 518th Fighter Squadron was activated at Bien Hoe. on 15 October,

the squadron would not receive its complement of MAP A-1Hs until early 1964 
and was of no help during the emergencies of the autumn of 1963. For reasons 
that were not clear to Americans, the VNAF 514th Squadron canmander generally 
ignored AOC 1' rag orders requiring napalm, the type of munition frequently 
requested by ARVN field canmanders operating during the rainy season in the 
III and IV CTZs based on their observation that the incendiary was more 
effective in the water-logged terrain than explosive munitions. On the 
occasions when VNAF crews deployed away from their home bases, the Viet-
namese airmen appeared to lack motivation, initiative, and reliability. (80) 
Under the rules of engagement, the USAF 34th Tactical Group's 1st 
Air Commando Squadron was authorized and expected to assume combat commit-
ments not performed by VNAF, and the 1st Air Commando Squadron had been 
authorized augmented personnel strength in order to permit it to generate 
more combat sorties without additional airframes. Because of unanticipated 
H.__L-:?:umstances, however, the 1st Air Commando Squadron was unable to generate 
required additional sorties. The "can do" spirit of the Farm Gate air-
crzews had caused them to overstress their aircraft in combat on frequent 
:.-)ccasions, and the Farm Gate detachment had had an authority to limit the 
normal maintenance performed on aircraft in accordance with a field operating 
environment. In July, when PACAF assumed ownership of the Farm Gate planes, 
Colonel Harold E. Walker, 2d Air Division Director of Materiel, found that 
the Farm Gate planes had been so overstressed and poorly maintained that 
they were actually unsafe to fly. The operational readiness rate of the 
Farm Gate aircraft was only 50-60 percent at this time, chiefly because of 
a high non-operational supply (NORS) rate. In-flight mechanical losses and 
enemy action further degraded air commando capabilities. On a combat mission 
on 16 August, a wing separated from a B-26 in flight, killing the two 
rican and one Vietnamese crewmen. In September, 23 aircraft received 
battle damage; another B-26 and a T-28 were lost because of mechanical 
failures; and on 23 September, three Vietcong guerrillas cut through the 
perimeter fences at Nha Trang and blew up two of the air commando c-47s 
with package explosives. (81) 
After the crash of the B-26 on 16 August, General Anthis flew a 
mission in one of the planes and thought that the B-26s could be kept in 
operation if the crews would fly them cautiously, employing soft approach 
and recovery tactics. To be safe, however, each B-26 would have to be 
rotated through depot maintenance contracted with Air Asia on Taiwan. Even 
though he thought that the planes could be kept in operation, Anthis 
strongly urged on 2 September that the battle weary B-26s should be replaced 
as quickly as possible either with dual-control A-1E US Navy fighters or 
with "On Mark" B-26KS that were being refurbished in the United States. 
In the months of August and September the let Air Commando Squadron was 
down to an average of nine T-28s and 9-12 B-26Bs, yet still committed to 
increase the 1962 sortie rate by 20 percent to support the National Campaign 
Plan. On 11 October, Anthis described his problem to Maj Gen Sam Maddux, Jr.,

Thirteenth Air Farce Commander, saying: Ne are really hurting for lack of 
strike airplanes. Right now we are down to nine of our authorized T-280s. . ? ? 
The T-28 situation, coupled with the 3-26 problem, has definitely curtailed 
our operations. We did not get our requested increase in strike aircraft 
for the NCP, and our present unsatisfactory posture even further aggravates 
things. "(82) 
After October the 2d Air Division's aircraft problem got worse in 
terms of possessed planes, but at Bien Hoa the 34th Consolidated Aircraft 
Maintenance Squadron implemented standard USAF maintenance procedures and 
increased the operationally ready rate. With an average of 45.2 possessed 
aircraft (instead of the authorized 62), the 34th CAMRON got the average 
operational ready rate for all types of aircraft up to 78.3 percent for 
the months of August through December. The rigid management procedures, 
however, affected operational scheduling. Under old Farm Gate practices, 
it had been possible to refuel, rearm, and turn around a flight of two T-28s 
in 30 to 45 minutes, but PACAF Safety checklists made two-hour turnarounds 
for T-28s and three-hour turnaround for B-26s the new norm at Bien Hoa. (83) 
The shortage of aircraft and the reduction in flying contributed to an air-
crew morale problem in the 1st Air Commando Squadron which was overmanned 
in terms of limited aircraft. Air canmando crews expressed demoralization 
at sitting around, doing nothing for days at a time, awaiting their turn to 
be scheduled for a strike mission. (814) 
Although the shortage of strike aircraft seriously affected combat 
operations, the predominant cause of unsatisfied requests for air support 
missions in the months of May through August was the lack of VNAF L-19 
(0-1) forward air control aircraft and crews, with 431 requests for air 
support being impossible on this account.(85) In view of this, Colonel 
Donald H. ROSS, 2d Air Division rector of Operations, hoped that the 
arrival of the US Army 73d Aviation Campany and the activation of the USAF 
19th Tactical Air Support Squadron would have a beneficial effect, even 
though the total number of liaison aircraft would still be less than computed 
as necessary to support the National Campaign Plan. This hope did not 
materialize. As previously noted, MACV did not place the 22 0-1s of the 
73d Company under the operational control of the TACS but instead allocated 
them to the support of the US Argy senior division advisors, whereupon VNAF 
promptly withdrew its L-19s that had previously been provided to the ARVN 
divisions on the ground that they were no longer needed. The US Amy. 0-1s 
took over local visual reconnaissance and convoy escort missions formerly 
provided by the VNAF liaison planes, but the removal of the VNAF L-19s 
left the USAF ALOs and FACs without local air transportation, unless they 
could borrow aircraft from the Argy advisors. (86) 
When it became fully operational on 15 September under command of Lt 
Colonel John J. Wilfong, the USAF 19th TABS maintained 16 0-1s at Bien Hoa 
and six 0-18 in a detachment at Can Tho. By the end of the year, the 18th 
TASS flew 3,862 sorties, including 483 forward air control, 1,221 visual

reconnaissance, and 1,518 combat support liaison. The "prompt response and 
can-do attitude" of the 19th TASS led to a heavy demand for its services, 
but as a matter of policy Colonel Wilfong sought to insure that the Americans 
augmented rather than supplanted the efforts of the VNAF liaison airmen. 
Some reduction in the VNAF liaison effort was expected to accompany the 
transfer of the more experienced Vietnamese L-19 pilots to fighter training, 
but it seamed to Colonel Wilfong that, when the 19th TABS began operations, 
the Vietnamese reduced their liaison flying more than was reasonable. 
"Instead of augmenting the VNAF capability," Wilfong noted, "it seems we 
replace them in many instances. "(87) 
American opinion about the performance of the individual VNAF FACs 
ranged from some sympathy to strong criticism. The USAF pilots who flew 
with the Vietnamese FACs understood that these men had been performing a 
boring and somewhat thankless task for many years and with no end in sight. 
The average VNAF FAC was said to be afraid that the law of averages was 
working against him, and it was difficult to get him to work below 2,000 
feet. If the FAC directed an attack against friendly people, he was subject 
to criminal prosecution, and if a FAC plane was holed by enemy fire he was 
criticized. The prevailing American assessment, however, was that the VNAF 
FAC crews were unaggressive and performed unreliably in the field. By 
October, American criticism of the VNAF FACs was running so strongly within 
the 2d Air Division that General Anthis and Colonel Ross expressed concern 
with the mounting criticism in the ALO/FAO reports, which to them indicated 
a "trend of our people to think we must run things. "(88) 
In view of the limited tactical air capabilities and the worsening 
combat situation in South Vietnam, 2d Air Division officers made consistent 
and continuing efforts to find feasible ways of increasing the responsiveness 
and effectiveness of tactical air support. General Anthis and his operations 
staff actively reviewed the monthly reports of the ALOs and the after action 
operational reports of the ALOs and FACs in a search for improved procedures, 
many of which could not be effected but were nonetheless carefully 
evaluated. The matter of improving Army-Air Force coordination was of 
particular interest both at the ASOCs and at 2d Air Division. At Da Nang, 
Lt Colonel Hubert R. Mann sought the assistance of the US Army Senior Advisor 
to the I CTZ in order to get someone on duty in the tactical operations 
center who could approve immediate air strike requests. The US Amy Senior 
Advisor did not agree that the TOG could be made a full-time and responsible 
center for planning operations and approving missions, but the I CTZ 
artillery commander was assigned to the TOG and given authority to approve 
many of the air support mission requests that had formerly required approval 
by the I CTZ cammander or his chief of staff. (89) When Lt Colonel Charles 
R. Allen, Deputy Director, II ASOC, got no response to proposals that a 
daily TOC-AOC planning conference should be held to permit more effective 
coordination of air-ground operations, General Anthis on 7 August directed 
that under his coordinating responsibility for MACV air operations the ASOCs 
would chair and conduct a daily coordination conference to be attended by

representatives of the CTZ ALO, USA/UM aviation headquarters, the TOC, 
the Airlift Branch (TMC), and others as appropriate. Next day, However, 
the MACV J-3 informed the four US Army senior corps advisors that Anthis' 
directive was not MACV policy. Colonel Ross nevertheless instructed the 
ASOCs to hold the daily planning meetings and to get the best attendance 
possible, and, after making a flight in support of a heliborne operation 
in Tay Nihh province and being unable to contact the helicopter forces on 
an unknown radio frequency, General Atthis wrote General Harkins on 2 
September that attendance of the III Corps aviation cammander at the daily 
planning conference held by the III ASOC would have provided a smooth 
coordination of the air effort. Once again, Anthis did not get MACV J-3 
support for his recommendation, the J.3 reasoning that air was the support-
ing force and that the ASOC people should go to the supported force and 
obtain the information that would be made available to them. ASOC officers 
continued to seek out the information.that they needed, but the concept of 
"it is here, you come and get it" appeared basically wrong, since cooperation 
should have been a mutual concern. (90) 
In the autumn of 1963 the 2d Air Division also continued to consider 
proposals for reducing the time required to respond to requests for air 
support. In the III CTZ Colonel Mellish was particularly insistent that 
outlying ARVN units, Self Defense Corps forces, and Civil Guard troops 
ought to be permitted to flash immediate air support requests directly to 
a responsible TOC since he rationalized that the intermediate echelons were 
seldom able to give any immediate assistance to these remote units when' 
they were attacked. He also recommended that USAF FACs should be assigned 
to province chiefs (whose forces were most heavily engaged with the enemy) 
and be equipped with single sideband radios so that they could make 
immediate air requests directly to the TOC and ASOC. These recommendations 
continued to be essentially objectionable to ARVN commanders, who were 
jealous of their authority, but in view of the emergencies prevalent during 
the autumn SOW short-cuts were permitted. Most ARVN commanders, however, 
still would not permit lower echelons to bypass their headquarters.(91) 
In order to speed air support, Mellish also proposed a more extensive 
employment of pairs of air alert aircraft, each flight to leave its base 
early in the morning, loiter up to two hours the vicinity of prospective 
enemy activity while awaiting a call from an ALO, and, if no call were 
received, attack a previously assigned law-priority target. After this, 
Mellish recommended that the flight should land at a forward airfield, 
refuel and rearm, and remain there during the day on ground alert. In 
reviewing Mellish's proposal, Colonel ROSS remarked that it had one 
significant defect, namely that the small number of available VNAF-USAF 
strike aircraft simply would not permit the dispersion of aircraft all 
over Vietnam awaiting prospective employments. Despite the limited avail-
ability of aircraft, however, the AOC recognized the intrinsic value of air 
alert: if an ARVN operation was planned against a Vietcong unit of company 
size of larger on-station air cover was provided if it were at all possible.(92)

In offensive employments, when strike pilots, and FACs were working 
in support of preplanned ARVN operations, the crews and controllers could 
normally get some pre-mission briefings which allowed them to understand 
the operation plan, but as more and more missions had to be flown in 
response to Vietcong initiated attacks pre-mission briefings were seldom 
practicable. In response to immediate air support requests, the VNAF FACs 
frequently had to fly many miles to an unfamiliar area where they established 
radio communications with the grorind force unit, got instructions on the 
location of friendly and enemy troops, and only then spotted targets for 
strike crews who arrived at the scene with no pre-mission information. 
Under the circumstances there was usually a lag in time between the arrival 
of a VNAF FAL over an objective area and the time that he was prepared to 
mark targets, and on two occasions in Tay Ninh province early in October the 
VNAF FACs, unfamiliar with the local situation, required 25 and 35 minutes 
to identify the Vietcong. In the last half of 1963, the USAF ALOs 
repeatedly urged that VNAF ALOs and FACs should be attached to ARVN divisions, 
where they could became intimately familiar with local situations, overcame 
the language barrier between USAF ALOs and FACs and the ARVN officers, and 
promote the use of tactical airpower. The 2d Air Division stated an 
imperative requirement that counterpart VNAF ALOs and FACs should be assigned 
to ARVN divisions, but the VNAF refused to consider such assignments, 
citing scarcity of qualified personnel, failure of young officers to perform 
professionally whenremoved from close supervision, and frequent lack of 
harmony between VNAF and ARVN officers. (93) Seeking to get ground infor-
mation briefings for strike aircrews at a conference at MALV on 7 October, 
Colonel Henderson repeated the earlier 2d Air Division requirement that 
ARVN ground liaison officers should be attached to tactical air units to 
:-rovide them with current order of battle information and that a ground 
liaison officer communications net should be established. Once again, the 
MAW response was negative, the reasoning continuing to be that ARVN 
commanders did not like to give out order of battle information for security 
reasons. (91j.) 
The reduced availability and lack of immediacy of tactical air support 
after June 1963 encouraged an already noted tendency on the part of ARVN 
divisions?notably the 5th and 23d in the III CTZ and the 7th in the IV 
CTZ -- to attempt to rely upon immediately available organic helicopter 
firepower. In numerous small operations in the Ban Mb Thuot area during 
September, for example, the 23d Division requested fixed-wing air support 
for only one operation. (95) On the other hand, USAF-VNAF flare/fighter 
support provided the only rapid response feasible against guerrilla attacks 
against South Vietnamese hamlets and outposts, and in June, July, and August 
the increasing night attacks caused the number of flare/combat air strike 
sorties to rise to 70/44, 72/52, and 79/62, respectively. By August, the 
number of night attacks in the III and IV CTZs exceeded the responsive 
ability of the single VNAF C-47 which stood night air alert over the Saigon 
area. Two incidents dramatized the problem. On the night of 16 August, 
the Communists struck Pho Sixth outpost on the Ca Mau peninsula. Indecision

on the part of the province commander as to whether to request air support 
contributed to delay in summoning the air alert C-47, and in the hour and 
forty-five minutes before the flare ship arrived the Canmunists overran 
the outpost. A few nights later in the III CTZ, Vietcong forces scored a 
major propaganda victory when, taking advantage of the removal of ARVN 
special forces to participate in raids against Buddhist pagodas in Saigon, 
the Reds promptly sacked the Ben Tuong strategic hamlet, which had been 
established a year earlier with so much publicity in Operation Sunrise. (96) 
The increasing night attacks demanded 'additional countermeasures. On 
16 August a III CTZ planning conference, held to discuss rapid reinforcement 
of strategic hamlets under night attack, proposed to use flare ship illumi-
nants to light the way for helicopter airlifts of company-sized forces into 
hamlets under attack. This planning was dismissed as impractical: nearly 
1,200 hamlets were potential targets in the III CTZ and the reaction time 
of a heliborne reinforcement force flying in the dark did not seem very 
attractive.(97) Analysis of the PhoSinh attack noted the delay incident 
to the summoning of the air alert C-47, but it was nonetheless true that 
the single VNAF flare plane held over Saigon could not reach the Ca Mau 
peninsula in an acceptable time. The IV CTZ ALO, Lt Colonel K. L. Collings, 
pressed for a commitment of two flare planes nightly to the IV CTZ, one to 
be held on orbit over Can Tho and the other deeper down over the Ca Mau 
peninsula.(98) Although the 2d Air Division acknowledged the requirement 
for additional flare ships, there was a good question as to how they could 
be provided. Each night alert A-1H began to load two flares in addition 
to strike ordnance, the flares to be used only in the event that flare 
aircraft were not available.(99) Employment of C-123 crews, carrying an 
additional VNAF navigator/communicatar, offered the best prospect for 
additional flare missic=7, but airflow characteristics around the C-123's 
rear aircraft cargo door and limited Access to troop lump doors proved 
tricky for flare drops. When hand reaeased, the Mark V and VI flares 
tended to hit the sides of the plane and could sweep back into the open 
rear cargo door. To meet the problems local manufacture provided a chute-
equipped flare box, constructed so that it could be strapped at the edge 
of the rear cargo ramp with only the release tube chute protruding under 
the almost-closed cargo door. This simple device permitted the C-123s at 
Tan Son Nhut to join the VNAF C-47s in nightly flareship alerts in September, 
and during this month VNAF and USAF crews flew 172 flare and 132 strike 
sorties against Communist night attacks. In October, fewer Vietcong attacks 
demanded only 60 flare and 94 strike sorties, but after this all-out Communist 
night assaults demanded a maximum VNAF-USAF night employment. (100) Up to 
three flare aircraft were kept over the IV CTZ each night, permitting one 
of the planes to reach any point in the Delta within 20 to 30 minutes. 
Operational records revealed that no Delta outpost or hamlet was success-
fully overrun after arrival of a flare/strike team, but it was nevertheless 
true that the hamlet program in the Delta was severely overextended and 
many installations lacked local defenses capable of withstanding enemy 
attack even long enough to permit arrival of air assistance. (101)

August that the ARVN 9th Division should be moved from QUi Nhon to a new 
assignment in the Delta, where the strategic hamlet program was moving 
slowly, overextended, and insufficiently protected. (102) The Communists 
also recognized the vulnerability of Mbkong Delta when on the night of 9/10 
September they escalated the war in the Delta from simple guerrilla tactics 
to well-planned and sustained field operations, following the tactics of 
"wipe-out-enemy-posts-and-annihilate-enemy-reinforcements." At 0120 hours 
on 10 September, the Communists initiated a five day battle -- which the 
ARVN 21st Division named Due Thang 35/42 -- with an 81-mm. mortar assault 
against Soc Trang airfield. Within five minutes, four USAF 1st Air Commando 
Squadron pilots scrambled aboard two T-28s, radioed the AOC that the field 
was under attack, requested a flare ship and additional fighters, and then 
began strafing attacks against the muzzle flashes of the enemy mortar 
positions, which were also placed under fire by ARVN mortars. The quick 
response drove off the Vietcong mortar crews who obviously intended but 
failed to neutralize the American fighters and helicopters on Soc Trang 
airstrip. In view of the emergency, the T-28 crews believed that they were 
morally and legally justified in making their attack. The 34th Tactical 
Group commander also described the aggressive action of the pilots in 
support of the base "commendable" but he nevertheless pointed out that they 
had violated the rules of engagement. Since Soc Trang was an "installation," 
the T-28 pilots should have had targeting assistance fram either a FAL or a 
flare plane before delivering ordnance. (103) 
The Communist mortar.attack at Soc Trang was the first phase of a 
coordinated effort in which the main thrust was simultaneously launched 
against the district headquarters towns of Dam Doi and Cal Nuoc near the 
tip of the Ca Mau peninsula. At about 0140 hours on 10 September, elements 
of the Vietcong U Minh and 96th battalions attacked Dam Doi with recoilless 
rifles, mortars, launch bombs, and automatic weapons. Simultaneously, another 
Vietcong hard-core battalion, reinforced by local guerrillas, attacked and 
overran Cal Nuoc. In addition, the enemy erected road blocks and laid 
mines on the road between Bac Lieu and Ca Mau, the only surface convoy route 
to the lower peninsula. Beginning at 0745 hours, T-28s from Soc Trang 
escorted and provided prelanding strikes for heliborne South Vietnamese 
Marines lifted to Dam Doi. Most of the landings went well, but at about 
1412 hours one of the T-28s providing prelanding support for a subsequent 
landing made a third pass over an enemy machine gun, was badly damaged, and 
forced to crash. An armed HU-IB picked up the T-28 crew, and the plane was 
subsequently destroyed to prevent its machine guns fram falling into enemy 
hands. While the South Vietnamese Marines encircled Dam Doi, the 21st 
Division staff secured and planned an airdrop of 498 men fram the ARVN 5th 
Airborne Battalion at Cal Nuoc. Later than planned, 10 C-47s and 7 C-123s 
delivered the paratroops beginning at 1733 hours. In continuing fighting 
at the Dam Doi encirclement during the next several days, the Communists 
lost 122 men killed (including 30 by air strikes) and a substantial quantity

of munitions (including a 50-caliber machine gun, two tripod-mounted 7.92-mm. 
machine guns, and a 75-mm. recoilless rifle). Around Cal Nuoc, the ARVN 
paratroopers killed 50 Vietcong, captured 8 prisoners, and seized a number 
of weapons. The air support for Dec Thang 35/42 was outstanding in quantity 
and aggressiveness. Sorties flown on-10 September broke all IV ASOC records 
for a single day, and the totals for 10-14 September ran to 72 air cover, 
10 escort, 18 prelanding, and 22 FAO sorties. Prestrikes and close air 
support, particularly in fighting south of Dam Doi, were instrumental in 
the overall success of the operation. Although Duc Thang 35/42 could be 
counted as a productive government victory, the Vietcong had proven able to 
stand against well-trained Marines and paratroopers, they had reduced the 
district towns of Dam Doi and Cal Nuoc to rubble, and they had killed and 
wounded 153 civilians. (104) 
The battle at Dam Doi and Ca! Nuoc focused attention on the situation 
in the IV CTZ. During the fighting, the AOC was able to divert additional 
tactical air support to the IV CTZ, once again demonstrating the flexibility 
of centrally controlled tactical a3roower, but in his initial report as 
Deputy Director of the IV ASOC on 24 September Lt Colonel Milton R. Pierce 
stated that the most critical deficiency confronting his activity was that 
of insufficient strike aircraft to support the bitter war in the Delta. It 
was standard practice in the 21st Division area at this time of aircraft 
shortages to cover heliborne operations with a single B-26, a practice 
which filled the escort requirement only on paper and indicated the thinness 
of tactical air resources. (105) The five USAF T-28s located at Soc Trang 
were invaluable as a quick-reaction force, but the rudimentary airstrip 
limited the operations of even these planes, which as time passed were 
insufficiently armed to deal with hostile weapons. If they could be obtained, 
heavier armed A-IHs or B-26s had to came from Bien Hoa, a thirty minute 
flight to the vicinity of Can Tho or an hour flight to the deep Delta. The 
Vietcong obviously understood the advantages presented in this situation 
since they normally did not show their hands before mid-afternoon, making 
it difficult to get aircraft into the area, into position, and to conduct 
a sufficient number of strikes during remaining hours of daylight.(106) 
When Secretary McNamara and General Taylor surveyed the tactical situation 
in the Delta at the end of September, General Harkins stated that a tactical 
air base should already have been built at Can Tho to meet urgent aviation 
requirements in the IV CTZ. In other briefings on the Telta situation, 
Secretary McNamara learned that the poorly-administered Ielta hamlet program 
had advanced into areas which could not be defended by available ARVN and 
paramilitary forces. In a meeting with President Diem, McNamara urged that 
the ARVN 9th Division should be sent to the Delta as recommended by General 
Harkins, and in Hawaii on 1 October he stated that no more strategic hamlets 
should be built in the Delta until those that existed could be protected. (107) 
Yielding to McNamara's judgement in regard to additional ground forces for 
the Delta, President Diem agreed to the movement of the 9th Division to the 
IV CTZ and it became operational at Sadec on 14 October. A few days later, 
Diem also accepted Harkins' recommendation that the boundary between the III 
and IV CTZ should be shifted to the Mekong River, thus as Harkins argued

reducing the problem of the IV CTZ to the deep Delta and concentrating III 
CTZ resources and attention on the provinces surrounding Saigon.(108) As 
soon as Harkins endorsed the project, Anthis and Rowland submitted an urgent 
requirement for a combat airfield in the Delta, most feasibly at Can Tho. 
Prospects that the airfield would be costly and require two years to complete 
continued to hold up acceptance in Hawaii, but in January 1964 CINCPAC would 
approve the construction of a new austere airfield at Can Tho to be usable 
in one year. (109) 
Undaunted by their losses at Dam Doi and Cai Nuoc, the Communists 
lost little time in contriving another major battle which was to take 
place near Loc Ninh, Chuong Thien province, in the center of the Ca Mau 
peninsula. Local guerrillas and NLF troops prepared well-camouflaged gun 
emplacements and foxholes along the edge of the narrow strips of dry land 
that would have to serve helicopter landings at Loc Ninh. Most of the fox-
holes were five to eight feet deep, with notches cut into the sides to permit 
occupants to fire and then to drop to the bottom of the holes during aircraft 
passes. A Chieu Hoy amnesty program defector brought information to the 
ARVN 21st Division that the 1096th Vietcong Battalion was using the area near 
Loc Ninh as a rest area and training camp, and the Communists confirmed the 
report on 17 October by beginning attacks on the outposts around Loc Ninh. 
At mid-day on 18 October, the 21st Division 0-3 planned a helicopter assault 
into three landing zones, and he requested strong tactical air support which 
exceeded normal IV ASOC allocations. The Air Operations Center was pressed 
with aircraft shortages and could not make the additional support available, 
but the IV ASOC could count on its normal daily allocation: 5 USAF T-28s, 
2 A-IHs, and 1 B-26. In the maturing plan, the B-26s and A-1Hs were 
committed to cover and escort, and two T-28s were scheduled for preplanding 
strikes against each of the three landing zones.(110) 
The ARVN 21st Division's Operation Duc Thang 43/$3021 began according 
to plan on the morning of 19 October. At 0926 the first helicopter lift 
proceeded to Loc Ninh as scheduled, and the two prelanding strike T-28s 
encountered only light ground fire at the LZ. In mid-morning, however, the 
Vietcong opened fire on the second lift, pinned down the AWN troops that 
landed, and hit and damaged the B-26 and a T-28, forcing them to leave 
their covering stations. The third helicopter lift overshot its assigned 
LZ and Vietcong fire shot dawn one of the H-21s in this aft, injuring two 
of the four Americans Aboard. After landing, the ARVN troops in the second 
and third lifts were pinned down by Vietcong automatic weapons, and air 
support ran out as the VNAF FAC expended all of the available air cover in 
close air support strikes. At the 21st Division command post, the division 
commander called on the ALO, Major Robert K. Butler, to get more air 
support, intermixing his requests with statements such as "when you really 
need it, you can never get it." Air strikes were renewed in the afternoon 
when the planes had turned around and returned. The US Argy advisors praised 
the aggressiveness of the support, especially the B-26 which continued to 
attack with other ordnance after its guns malfunctioned, even though in one

pass it was fired upon simultaneously by six to eight automatic weapons 
positions. The air strikes did not quiet the deeply-dug Communist firing 
positions, and the Vietcong showed no hesitation in shooting at aircraft 
while the planes were attacking. The Vietcong held their positions all day, 
finally withdrawing under cover of rain at nightfall. The ALOss request for 
a flareship and fighters to pursue the retreating enemy was called off 
because the ARVN forces were uncertain about the locations of their men. 
Altogether during the day, 6 VNAF A-1H, 8 VNAF T-28, 15 USAF T-28, and 2 
USAF B-26 strike sorties were flown, and .2 VNAF T-28s, 4 USAF T-28s, and 
2 B-26s were hit by ground fire. Friendly losses included 41 killed, 84 
(12 US) wounded, and an H-21 shot down. The enemy losses included 32 
confirmed killed and 59 freshly dug graves were also found in the immediate 
vicinity of the battle.(111). 
The Vietcong hailed the battle at loc Ninh as an equivalent victory 
to that scored earlier in the year at Ap Bac and regarded it as a justifi-
cation for continued employment of the tactics whereby they would attack 
enemy posts and then ambush the ARVN reinforcements. (112) In his report of 
the operation, Major Butler pointed out that either napalm incendiaries 
or 500-lb. bombs would have been appropriate against the deeply dug 
Communists firing positions, since low shower cloud bases prevented the 
supporting aircraft from effective high-angle strafing attacks. The IV CTZ 
ALO, Colonel Collings recommended four-ship aircraft flights that would be 
able to keep Communist positions under continuous fire during attacks 
against them, thus reducing damages to the friendly planes. And the 
experience at Loc Ninh caused Colonel Pierce to remark once again on the 
scarcity of air support in the IV CTZ, which had averaged less than 10 
aircraft a day since the establishment of the IV ASOC.(113) The ARVN 21st 
Division also learned lessons from r4oc Minh. Early on the morning of 7 
November, some 200 Vietcong attacked a pagoda and then holed up in a mud-
walled fishing settlement on the coast about 20 miles southeast of Soc 
Trang. Late that afternoon, an ARVN and Civil Guard troops fixed the 
location of the Vietcong and determined that there were no friendlies in the 
walled position. The government troops did not attempt a frontal assault, 
but instead the four T-28s at Soc Trang made repeated attacks against the 
enemy position. Next day, blood marks within the walled enclosure showed 
that at least 40 Vietcong had been killed by air. The US Army advisor 
commented that if the ARVN forces had attacked, there would have been 
another "loc Ninh. "(114) 
As it happened, the Communist victory at Lac Ninh occurred at almost 
the same time that the ARVN general offensive was collapsing. General 
Harkins would continue to believe that the offensive foundered because of 
the declining political situation,(115) but other examinations of the RVUAF 
"explosion" operations questioned whether the campaign had ever became 
effective. An examination, of operations reports by the US Joint Chiefs of 
Staff led to the conclusion that the military situation in South Vietnam was 
declining from July 1963 onward,(116) and PACAF received much the same 
impression from an examination of the following monthly totals of Vietcong

The decline in the offensive accomplishments of tactical airpower was 
attributable in part to the growing scarcity of tactical air sorties, but 
in the IV CTZ Colonel Pierce pointed to the remarkable accomplishments of 
a very limited number of aircraft and suggested that little effort had been 
made to maximize tactical air capabilities. "The role of tactical air," 
Pierce wrote, "has been discounted by most counterinsurgency experts in 
recent years, but our experience here is proving them wrong. I am con-
vinced that decisive air firepower will eventually be recognized as 
essential to successful prosecution of even the smallest of wars. I 
believe that, given the resources, we could soon prove it beyond doubt. "(117) 
S. Problems of Aerial Reconnaissance  
The USAF-VNAF air reconnaissance establishment planned and in process of 
development in South Vietnam early in 1963 was designed to meet broad Southeast 
Asia reconnaissance requirements, aerial reconnaissance needs within South 
Vietnam in support of the National Counterinsurgency Plan/General Offensive 
Plan, and immediate air requirements within the four OTZs inside South 
Vietnam. The 2d Air Division's reconnaissance plan envisioned a phased 
reduction of USAF air capabilities as quickly as the VNAF 716th Squadron, 
programmed for equipment with 3 RC447s, 4 RT-33s, and 18 RT-28s, reached a 
full operational capability of 374 sorties a month -- an eventuality 
expected to be attained by midsummer 1964. The VNAF reconnaissance program 
encompassed the deployment of detachments of Vietnamese photo reconnaissance 
aircraft and self-sufficient photo processing cells (PPOs) to each of the 
four CTZs, thus providing locally competent capabilities for aerial photo-
graphy, photo processing, initial interpretation, and reporting of 
intelligence. (118)

As has been seen, the VNAF 716th Squadron was activated at Tan Son 
Nhut in September 1962, but at this time the VNAF possessed only two old 
C-45 photo aircraft, and the 716th was committed to interim employment as 
a reduced-strength T-28 tactical fighter squadron.(119) In January 1963, 
the VNAF established a nine-man PPC at Da Nang, but plans to build other 
VNAF PPCs for the II, III and IV Corps at Pleiku, Bien Hoa, and Can Tho 
did not come about, since MAP facility construction at Pleiku was slow and 
plans for Can Tho awaited decision about the airfield to be built there. (120) 
Early in 1963, as has also been seen, the Able Mable RTF at Tan Son Nhut 
was increased to six RF-101s; two of the Black Watch RB-26Cs were operating 
out of Tan Son Nhut while the third RE-26C was deployed to Da Nang where it 
was fragged by the I ASOC; and at their arrival two Sweet Sue RB-26Ls and 
two Patricia Ly-nn RB-57s would be bedded down at Tan Son Nhut.(121) In 
February 1963, the 6091st ROconnaissance Squadron, located at Yokota Air 
Base, Japan, replaced its Hilo Hattie C-54 with a specially-equipped Brave 
Bull C-97 reconnaissance aircraft that would fly missions from Tan Son 
Nhut. (122) 
Requests for photo reconnaissance missions increased during the planning 
and preparation phase for the National Campaign Plan/General Offensive Plan. 
During the period 1 January to 31 March 1963, USAF and VNAF planes completed 
230 requests for reconnaissance. Of these, 69 were for ARVN operational 
planning, 23 were in support of heliborne operations, 121 were for the 
location of Vietcong activities, 3 were visual inspections of anti-helicopter 
defenses, 2 were terrain study, 7 were in support of civic action projects, 
and 5 were for miscellaneous purposes. In support of US Army Special Forces, 
the 2d Air Division instituted a continuing program to photograph and 
maintain photo files in the airlift section of the JAOC of outposts and 
Special Force campsites to show the best approaches and drop zones for 
aerial supply. Reconnaissance requests received in January-March resulted 
in 233 sorties flown by Able liable, 88 by RB-26Cs, and 19 by VNAF C-45s. 
In addition, 2,111 visual and 7 hand-held camera photo sorties were logged 
by VNAF L-19s.(123) 
Early in 1963, General AnthiE was not satisfied with the responsiveness 
of the USAF-VNAF reconnaissance establishment and identified two major 
problems, one having to do with the JGS procedure for handling reconnaissance 
requests and the other concerning the lack of organic courier capabilities 
for delivering reconnaissance products to requestors. The Jus directive 
on reconnaissance that had been issued on 7 May 1962, specified two 
categories of reconnaissance requests -- immediate and preplanned -- to be 
forwarded upward through ARVN G-2 channels into the TACS in the same way 
as air support requests passed upward through G-3 channels. In March 1963, 
Anthis asked the J15 to specify that all reconnaissance requests would be 
handled as immediate requests and forwarded directly from battalions to 
ASOCs, which would normally use the reconnaissance sorties available to 
them to accomplish the missions. If requests received exceeded allocated 
sortie capability, the ASOC would forward such requests to the OGS-JOC.

Although all reconnaissance requests would be handled as immediate requests, 
the priority assigned to the mission request would indicate its urgency. 
These recommendations were included in a new JGS memorandum on 15 April 
1963, which also set priorities as follows: Priority 1 -- mission must be 
performed immediately, possibly by aircraft in flight at the time; Priority 
2 -- request must be fulfilled as soon as possible; Priority 3 -- request 
may be performed when weather permits; Priority 4 -- request may be performed 
when higher priority requests have been fulfilled. (l21) The other problem 
affecting timeliness of completed reconnaissance concerned the delivery of 
photographs and reconnaissance products to requestors by improvised courier 
services. In order to speed deliveries, General Anthis requested assignment 
of a couple of U-3Bs or preferably T-37s at the Secretary of Defense Conference 
on 6 May 1963. At Secretary McNamara's direction, two U-3Bs arrived from 
the United States on 24 May to serve as couriers to speed the delivery of 
reconnaissance products throughout South Vietnam. (125) 
By exploitating USAF reconnaissance capabilities while simultaneously 
building the VNAF reconnaissance squAdron and PPCs hopefully to be co-located 
with CTZ command posts, PACAF visualized a professionally competent air 
reconnaissance system for South Vietnam of the same characteristics that 
had been demonstrated during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.(126) A 
variety of circumstances in South Vietnam worked against attainment of this 
professionally competent system. For one thing, the reconnaissance require-
ments of the insurgency situation in Southeast Asia proved different from 
those of World War II, Korea, or Cuba. Even more immediately, however, the 
reconnaissance system envisioned for South Vietnam was predicated upon the 
VNAF capabilities which, for the greater part, were not going to develop. 
At Da Nang, the I ASOC was able to frag the RB-26C kept deployed there and 
the VNAF PPC also provided immediate support to I Corps requirements, but 
the other ACs had no local air reconnaissance and could not practicably 
frag the reconnaissance force at Tan Son Nhut; instead, the aas-Joic made 
reconnaissance allocations, the AOC fragged reconnaissance missions, and 
intelligence products had to be delivered from Tan Son Nhut. In 1963, this 
was considered to be a temporary expedient that would be changed when VNAF 
manned its PPCs and reconnaissance squadron. (127) In the meanwhile, how-
ever, the USAF-VNAF system had difficulty competing with the responsiveness 
of the locally available US Army Mohawk detachments and PPCs under test 
in II CTZ. Especially in April, May, and June, USAF ALOs in II CTZ were 
concerned about slow deliveries of requested RF-101 reconnaissance photos, 
which, while generally excellent, were not responsive enough to meet their 
requirements. "Mohawks," noted Lt Colonel Meir, the 9th Division ALO, 
"might only take a small picture, but this was here in 24 hours and a 
mall picture is better than no picture at all. :1(128) There was no doubt 
of the responsiveness of the Mohawks when attached to ARVN divisions, but 
the locally gathered intelligence was not fed into the over-all intelligence-
reconnaissance system where it could have been used by the entire intelli-
gence community to increase, confirm, or deny information already held. (129) 
As Mohawk tests were nearing completion, General Harkins announced his

intention to keep them in Vietnam to fulfill operational requirements of 
ininediate concern to ground commanders. Harkins stated that the Mohawks 
were "complementary" rather than "competitive" to USAF-VNAF tactical air 
reconnaissance and that coordination of the Mohawk effort with that of 
other tactical air reconnaissance activities was not necessary since the 
Mohawk effort was "outside of the Specialized capabilities of other photo 
aircraft. "(130) Even though by the autumn of 1963, the central USAF-VNAF 
air reconnaissance system had become able, almost without exception, to 
deliver reconnaissance products to requesting agencies on or before requested 
deadlines,(131) but ARVN divisions:had found it convenient to rely upon 
locally available organic Mohawk reconnaissance. "We believe," the USAF 
ALO at ARVN 5th Division reported in November, "virtually all requests for 
visual and simple photographic reconnaissance are intercepted and flown by 
organic aviation. "(132) Under these circumstances, the employment of the 
US Army Mohawks -- aircraft that were not programmed for either ARVN or 
VNAF -- served to palliate the requirement to develop VNAF tactical air 
reconnaissance, this despite the announced American policy of preparing 
South Vietnamese forces to fight their awn war. 
Although the VNAF 716th Squadron was operational as an interim tactical 
fighter unit, the conversion of the squadron to its intended reconnaissance 
mission went slowly. In October, the squadron gained operational photo-
graphic capabilities with a single camera-equipped RC-47, and camera 
equipment was being installed in the two other programmed RC-47s and in 
six T-28Ds that had been delivered in South Vietnam. The remaining eight 
RT-28s were programmed for modification in the Dated States and were 
scheduled for delivery to Vietnam by January 1964.(133) In the absence of 
VNAF photo reconnaissance Capabilities, USAF aircraft flew nearly all of 
the USAF-VNAF air photo effort during 1963, with the peak of effort occurring 
in April and May, in the climax of planning for the RVNAF general offensive, 
as demonstrated in the following chart:

agencies was, almost without exception, being made on or before established

reconnaissance program was not offering maximum value under conditions 
of counterinsurgency -- an environment which presented different reconnais-
sance requirements from those that had been met in World War II, Korea, 
and during the Cuban missile crisis. Viewed in retrospect, the lack of a 
single USAF manager for aerial reconnaissance in Southeast Asia -- or even 
a 11r. Reconnaissance" in 2d Air Division -- made it difficult to meld the 
separate packages of aerial reconnaissance capabilities into a complete 
aerial reconnaissance program, or even to identify the unique requirements of 
aerial reconnaissance in the new and strange environment. 
One of the first unique problems of aerial reconnaissance met during 
1962 and continued into 1963 was that of locating fugitive Vietcong radio 
transmitters from the air -- a task that had initially appeared simple to 
accomplish with airborne high frequency/direction finding (HF/DF) equipment. 
As has been seen, this task was undertaken by HF/DF equipped US Army L-20s 
and by the USAF Hilo Hattie C-54 and proved to be very difficult. By 
January 1963 the communications detection activity revealed that some 224 
Communist radio transmitters were active, but it was unable to fix the 
exact location of the sets close enough for air strikes against them. In 
the search for the Vietcong transmitters, the US Army D-20s proved more 
successful than Hilo Hattie, whose HF/OF equipment and also its Reconofax 
IV infrared photographic equipment performed poor1y.(135) In January 1963, 
General Anthis privately questioned whether the Vietcong radio transmitters 
ought to be attacked since they were the best current indicators as to the 
location of Vietcong leadership and hardcore troops and it might be better 
to listen to the traffic.than end it.(136) This view was not apparently 
officially accepted, and since Hilo Hattie was not giving positive results 
the 6091st Reconnaissance Squadron retired the plane in February 1963 and 
began to stage an electronic intelligence and camera-equipped C-97, nick-
named "Brave Hull," to Tan Son Nhut for operational flights in Southeast 
Asia. (137) In its turn, the Brave Bull 0-97 was unable to fix the location 
of enemy transmitters, but its long focal length camera served other useful 
purposes. 
Under the conditions of insurgency, PACAF aerial reconnaissance 
officers envisioned that airborne infrared (IR) reconnaissance systems, 
capable of detecting the electromagnetic radiation emitted by small camp-
fires, vehicles, structures, trails, and streams underneath foliage and 
tree cover, would be of great value in identifying Vietcong activities 
that would be hidden in normal photography. Because of technical problems 
the Reconofax IV IR photo equipment installed in Hilo Hattie did not work, 
but on 2 March two RB-26L "Sweet Sue" aircraft, equipped with factory-
installed Reconofax sensors and cameras, arrived at Tan Son Nhut from Fort 
Worth, Texas, for assignment to the Farm Gate detachment and later the 1st 
Air Commando Squadron. At the end of a 90-day shakedown, the technical

representative who accompanied the infrared equipment was unable to make 
the Reconofax IV system (originally designed for installation on B-58s) 
work. Spares left by Hilo Hattie turned out to be differently configured, 
making it impossible to use them in Sweet Sue. Climatic conditions, 
especially dust and moisture, fouled the sensors in the RB-26Ls; moreover, 
photo flare cartridge ejectors were forward of the infrared system so that 
heat from each ejected flare employed for night photography saturated the 
infrared detector and rendered its film useless. Test equipment had to be 
scrounged in the theater and locally-available airmen selected for IR 
maintenance training had little electronics background. In June, the JAW 
scheduled the Sweet Sue planes for IR missions; the system was flown six 
times and failed each time. While the Sweet Sue infrared would never work, 
the RB-26L turned out to be an excellent photo aircraft in the counterin-
surgency environment and was so employed. The glass nose of the RB-26L 
accamnodated a navigator, who was very valuable for visual navigation to 
pinpoint targets when map data was inaccurate. (138) 
In addition to the Sweet Sue HB-26Ls, which were limited to operating 
within South Vietnam, USAF proposed to outfit two RB-57E aircraft with 
advanced and improved equipment, including Reconofax VI sensors and K-52 
panoramic cameras, and to attach the Patricia Lynn RB-57E detachment to 
the Able Mable reconnaissance taSk force for prospective employment both 
within South Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia. The two Patricia 
Lynn RB-57s reached Tan San Mut on 6 May. Although PACAF had believed 
that the RB-57s would arrive campletelTequipped and with 90-day spares, 
integral components of the infrared sensors proved to be lacking. Once 
again, the RB-57s gave good performance with their camera systems, and the 
new K-52 panoramic camera' provided horizon-to-horizon photography of 
very clear resolution even when the RB-57 was operated at high speed and 
low altitude. The fact that both horizons appeared in the panoramic 
photograph increased a photo interpreter's perspective but required 
additional training on the part of interpreters, who had to learn to 
compensate for distortion inherent in the wide lateral coverage. (139) 
AS Colonel Henderson wrote General Moorman on 25 July, the failure of 
Sweet Sue and Patricia Lynn infrared equipment was "giving the USAF a 
black eye." Henderson's request for aggressive action led to the organiza-
tion of an expert Air Force Logistics Command "Big Safari" technical team 
that began local assessments and rework of the Patricia Lynn infrared 
equipment at Clark Air Base late in September. In initial operational 
missions generated by the 2d Air Division beginning in April 1964, the 
Patricia Lynn Reconofax XI sensors would provide technically competent 
imagery on film of Communist habitations in Zone D and of vessels on the 
coastal and inland waterways of the Delta. A 60-day evaluation completed 
in June confirmed the Patricia Lynn infrared as an operational capability 
for locating Communist night activity in given locations; but at this 
time, photo interpreters would still have to be trained to make maximum 
use of the infrared imagery and means would have to be found whereby the 
resultant intelligence could be exploited. (]J40) In short, the equipment

worked but the intelligence system did not have a plan to exploit the 
information it could provide: 
The political situation in Southeast Asia also presented difficult 
aerial reconnaissance problems. In January 1963, the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff team which visited Vietnam noted that restrictions against overflights 
of Laos and North Vietnam were making victory more remote in South Vietnam 
and recommended that Admiral Felt secure authority for air and ground 
reconnaissance missions into Laos. On PACAF recommendation, Admiral Felt 
on 18 February requested authority for four RF-101 special daylight flights 
at altitudes not less than 10,000 feet to cover the Tchepone area. When 
approval for these missions was not given, Felt requested in April that 
the Brave Bull C-97, which outwardly appeared to be a transport aircraft, 
be allowed to photograph Tchepone. Again, on 29 June, General Harkins 
urgently importuned Admiral Felt for permission to photograph Communist 
buildups reports in southern Laos. (141) Since Washington authorities were 
unwilling to authorize reconnaissance flights over Laos, General O'Donnell 
proposed to Felt on 30 April that PACAF should be authorized to make an 
aerial mapping survey of Vietnam's borders, conducted with full publicity 
as an assistance project beneficial to all countries concerned. This 
proposal was also unacceptable. Although limited to operating over South 
Vietnam, 2d Air Mivision photo aircraft, nevertheless, managed with 
vertical and oblique cameras to photograph approximately 85 percent of the 
Lao and Cambodian border during 1963. These border surveillance photographs 
helped provide intelligence information About personnel and materiel infil-
tration routes along South Vietnam's periphery. One notable set of RF-101 
photos revealed heavily fortified positions just inside Cambodia with 
well-used pathways connecting across the border with known Vietcong 
installations, providing substantial proof that the Communists were enjoy-
ing a sanctuary in Cambodia. (142) 
At the same time that political restrictions limited aerial reconnais-
sance to South Vietnam, CTZ concepts for prosecuting the counterinsurgency 
campaign within South Vietnam posed problems to a centralized air reconnais-
sance system. The development of intelligence centered within the separate 
corps areas affected the operations of transport planes and strike aircraft 
that flew across the arbitrary boundaries of the corps tactical zones to 
accomplish missions. For example, troop carrier crews found that intelli-
gence was frequently not available in the I ASOC area to support necessary 
flights fram Da Nang into the IV ASOC area. (143) In the Spring of 1963, 
centrally located air cammando crews camplained that they never saw target 
photographs during pre-mission briefings. After looking into the matter, 
General Anthis issued instructions that each operational air base and ASOC 
be provided sets of target folder photographs to be used for aircrew 
briefings. This procedure worked well enough when major air attack 
objectives were being targeted through the Joint General Staff, but the 
impetus of the counterinsurgency campaign soon shifted to the individual 
corps areas where the ASOCs often lacked pre-mission target photography. 
In October 1963, the 23d Division ALO secured photo reconnaissance of his 
area that was very helpful in identifying targets for airstrike, helping

pilots recognize objectives, and initiating ground operations. In 
general, however, the air strike crews continued to lack pre-mission 
target photography. Bomb damage assessment photography was very difficult 
to manage despite a standing AOC reconnaissance requirement that all air 
strikes that could be covered immediately would be photographed for BDA. 
There was usually at least a one-half hour delay before reconnaissance air-
craft could arrive over a strike area, and many small, hastily-ordered air 
strikes could not be covered at all. To the AOC Reconnaissance Branch, 
the lack of success with BDA dictated a requirement that COIN strike air-
craft carry camera pods and accomplish their own assessment photography. 
On the other hand, B-26 crewmen who did take BDA photos of their strikes 
complained that they never got their photography back from processing at 
Tan Son Nhut.(1)1h) 
The central operating location of Able Mable at Tan Son Nhut gave 
some trouble to the conduct of RF-101 missions. With their jet speed, the 
RF-101s could fly to and from Tan Son Nhut to the most distant reaches of 
the I CTZ in an hour and 40 minutes and still have an effective time in 
the target area of 50 minutes, but high speed -- coupled with often 
inaccurate maps and objective coordinates -- at times made it difficult 
for an RF-101 pilot to locate small pinpoint targets unique to guerrilla 
warfare in an area that was not familiar to him. Thus, in June 1963, 
RF-101 photographs of pinpoint landing zones requested by the 9th Division 
ADO were as far as six kilometers off target. (145) In order to compensate 
for navigation errors and map coordinate errors of pinpoint targets, the 
tactical reconnaissance crews began to turn on their cameras extra early 
and leave them on extra late, thus providing a request for more photography 
than wanted. At the same time, US Army and ARVN requestors became prone to 
ask for area coverage when actually an effective strip or pinpoint photo 
would have sufficed.(146) Other environmental factors contributed to an 
emphasis upon area and vertical photography. In regions of dense, unbroken 
foliage, vertical photography was more effective than oblique photography, 
and in areas where the jungle canopy was frequently broken, vertical 
photography often proved necessary to locate spots of interest before 
oblique photography could be useful. Other types of spot photography were 
also affected by the environment. Camouflage detection film was of some 
value, but where dense natural jungle growth was so readily available, the 
enemy seldom had need for artificial cover and, if he did, he could rapidly 
renew cut branches with freshly-cut vegetation. Night flash photography 
not only alerted the enemy of interest in an area, but yielded poor photos 
since the jungles absorbed too much light and water-covered rice paddy 
land reflected too much glare for good photography. (147) 
Seeking to insure that customers would understand how to request the 
type of reconnaissance best suited to meet their needs, the 2d Air 
Division's Targets Branch prepared and issued on 9 September 1963 a Photo 
Reconnaissance Handbook explaining the various types of air reconnaissance 
that could be flown in South Vietnam.(148) The majority of requests, 
however, continued to be for large-scale vertical area cover photography,

often of areas as large as 20 by 30 kilometers. For example, in 
October 1963, the PACAF reconnaissance survey mentioned that requesting 
agencies were submitting invalid requirements for masses of contact prints. 
thereby saturating the photo system. An accounting of photo completions 
from January through June 1964 would show47.7 percent vertical area 
cover, 28.8 percent vertical and oblique strips, and 23.5 vertical and 
oblique pinpoints. Flying such large amounts of vertical area cover, 
especially when parts of any area to be photographed were usually obscured 
by clouds at any given time, strained RF-101 capabilities and, of course, 
contributed to built-in delays in the accomplishment of requested photo-
graphy. In the Air Operations Center, the USAF Deputy Director, Lt Colonel 
Fowler, suspected that the reconnaissance officers in the ASOCs were not 
helping requestors to select the type of reconnaissance that could best 
meet their needs. Fowler remarked that the ASOC reconnaissance officers 
were former tactical reconnaissance pilots who were prone to accept the 
challenge of any request received and to pass it on for accomplishment 
without first examining it for suitability, feasibility, and necessity to 
a requestor, or for its effect upon the over-all reconnaissance capability. 
On the other hand, in the counterinsurgency environment, vertical area 
photography was proving very useful for mapping and operational planning 
and it would be provided, even though this type of reconnaissance was 
contrary to the concept of quick-reacting tactical reconnaissance.(149) 
By October 1963, General Anthis judged that "from a pure coverage 
standpoint," the 2d Air Division could accomplish "most requests for 
photography," but he, nevertheless, pointed out that in the counterinsurgency 
environment the air reconnaissance effort was not yielding maximum amounts 
of intelligence, which was, after all, the purpose of air reconnaissance. 
Small and often fleeting insurgency targets were difficult to locate and 
photograph. Anthis though that professionally trained reconnaissance 
crews were necessary to achieve quality results, but he offered a preliminary 
suggestion that a composite strike/reconnaissance aircraft should be 
developed and provided for counterinsurgency warfare and that counterin-
surgency aircrew training should cross-train crews to accomplish both 
missions.(150) At this same time, other 2d Air Division officers were 
beginning to emphasize the critical importance of sustained, daily visual 
reconnaissance in locating insurgent activities -- this despite the 2d Air 
Division's failure to get resources needed for the "cat and mouse" concept 
and a general inability to persuade VNAF strike fighter pilots to undertake 
low-level visual reconnaissance missions. The III Corps ALO, Lt Colonel 
Mellish, was particularly insistent that ALO/FACfs and VNAF observers could 
locate the Vietcong, even in heavily-wooded areas, if they got dawn low 
and looked for them. (151) Air reconnaissance system requirements were 
also emerging. On the Air Force side, Colonel Harvey Henderson, Deputy 
Commander 2d Air Division, continued to urge that the fragmentary RB-26, 
RB-57, and RF-101 capabilities be consolidated in a tactical reconnaissance 
squadron and that the 13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron be placed 
under control of the lirector of Intelligence, 2d Air Division. (1S2) In

addition to single management of USAF reconnaissance, there was a need to 
insure that information obtained by all reconnaissance activities --
USAF, US Army, and VNAF -- was properly reported, screened, evaluated, and 
exploited for common-user intelligence purposes. (1S3) 
6. Air Transport Capabilities Exceeded Requirements. 
Where strike aircraft proved inadequate in number fully to support 
the National Campaign Plan/General Offensive Plan, it was evident by early 
1963 that MACV requirements for air transport were exaggerated, partly 
because of uncertainty as to how successfully the Vietcong would interdict 
surface travel but also because Brig General Frank A. Osganski, MACV J-4/ 
favored US Argy concepts of aerial transport organization which visualized 
arbitrary second and third destination delivery of air cargoes in forward 
areas by US Army Caribou aircraft and cargo helicopters. The MACV J-4 
logistics movement concept for intensified operations envisioned the 
establishment of redistribution depots at Da Nang (I CTZ) by 1 May, Nha 
Trang (III CTZ and Special Forces) by 1 June, Qui Nhon (II CTZ) by 1 July, 
and Can Tho (IV CTZ) by 1 August. The depots at Saigon would continue to 
support III and IV CTZs, ami the majority of materiel would continue to 
be delivered by air and sea to Saigon, where it would be shipped by sea to 
Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Can Tho. The SEA Sealift System went 
into operation on 31 March 1963, and a US LST departed Saigon every seven 
days and made a 12-day round trip, unloading at Da Nang, Qui Nhon, and 
Nha Trang, and returning to Saigon.(154) 
In December 1962, General Osganski conceived that lack of security 
would make South Vietnamese rail and highway systems of limited value 
during intensified operations and that locations inland from the coastal 
redistribution centers would have to be supplied predominantly by air. 
He thought that POL would be included in aerial cargoes. At this point, 
projected airlift requirements approximated 34,000 tons per month, including 
special commitments of tactical airlift. On the basis of this planning, 
as has been seen, General Harkins requested a third and fourth C-123 
squadron (32 aircraft) and a second CV-2B Caribou company (16 aircraft). 
In context with the MACV plan, the 2d Air Division and 315th Troop Carrier 
Group proposed in a formal briefing for General Harkins on 16 February 
envisioning expansion and exploitation of the Southeast Asia Airlift 
System as originally conceived in MACV Directive No. 42. Under guidance 
from the Joint Movements Allocation Board in MACV J-4, the Airlift Branch 
in the Joint Air Operations Center would manage utilization of the 64 USAF 
C-123s, 32 VNAF C-47s, and 32 US Argy CV-2Bs. Transport Movement Control 
sections would be established in each of the ASOCs and also at Qui Nhon 
and Nha Trang. The C-123s would make the initial distribution from Tan 
Son Nhut to the four other primary depots and secondary distribution from 
Tan Son Nhut and the four other primary depots to 29 additional destinations. 
Integral corps aircraft would make tertiary or final distribution. The 
TMCfs would exercise flying control over corps aircraft -- not in order to

control the flying assets but to maintain flight safety and to preclude 
saturation of airfields and airspace. General Harkins asked for a copy 
of the briefing to study and his remarks indicated that he did not believe 
that the airlift requirement would be as large as Osmanski had stated 
since roads were being cleared and Vietcong incidents against road and 
rail traffic were decreasing and ought to decrease still more as intensi-
fied operations progressed. (155) At another meeting held on 7 March 
between General Osmanski, Colonel Leon M. Tannenbaum, Commander of the 
315th Troop Carrier Group, and Colonel George C. Marton, Commander of US 
Army Special Forces (Provisional) Vietnam, it was agreed that the Special 
Forces at Nha Trang would be guaranteed 20 tons of airlift every day, or 
600 tons of airlift a month from the SEAAS.(156) On 17 April, the USAF 
777th Troop Carrier Squadron arrived at DaNang with 16 C-123s, whereupon, 
the 32 C-123s already in Vietnam were concentrated at Tan Son Nhut, with 
3 of them further detached to Don Muang in Thailand. ($7) 
Discussions and developments had also been in progress to refine airlift 
requirements. While the logistical depot system was unchanged, it no longer 
appeared necessary to plan initially to move large quantities of POL by 
air or to transport all dry cargo to second and third destinations by air-
craft. On 18 April, the NCP monthly airlift requirements were revised 
down to 14,561 tons, plus 600 tons for Special Fbrces, plus 1,500 tons of 
tactical airlift, or a round total of 16,500 tons per month. Narking 
around the clock, the 315th Troop Carrier Group, whose commander also 
served as 2d Air Division Director of Air Transportation, adjusted the 
requirement of new airlift schedules. Effective 24 MAY, the 8th Aerial 
Port Squadron expanded with the activation of Detachment 6 at Qui Nhon 
and Detachment 7 at Can Tho. On 5 June, PACAF alerted sourced subcommands 
to begin deploying 120-day temporary duty personnel to the new TMCs and 
to aerial port detachments being established to support NCP airlift 
requirements. (158) 
In all planning for the National Campaign Plan airlift, the 2d Air 
Division and 315th Troop Carrier Group continued to assume that US Army 
Caribous and VNAF C-47s would be incorporated in the Southeast Asia Air-
lift System as provided by MACV Directive No. 42. But in fact, the tonnages 
specified in the April NCP airlift plan were within the capabilities of 
three 0-123 squadrons and a single Caribou campany. In the projection, the 
C-123s would be expected to provide more than 80 percent of the total NCP 
airlift requirement. A tactical analysis of the C-123B transports in 
Vietnam published on 15 April 1963, offered the major conclusion that the 
C-123B had successfully performed tasked airlift missions in South Vietnam 
and that a replacement aircraft with less load carrying capability would 
be economically unsound, infeasible, and detrimental to counterinsurgency 
airlift operations. In addition to the primary airfield system in Vietnam, 
there were at least 59 assault airstrips (2,000 feet or less) and 88 non-
established or hastily prepared facilities that would accept the C-123B,

assuming adequate weather, landing surface, and security measures were 
met. At other locations, the C,123s consistently delivered paradropped 
supplies very successfully with a modified "Bent Bow" rapid delivery 
technique. This system utilized prefabricated roller conveyors in the 
cargo compartment and ramp. At the point of a drop, the pilot pulled up 
the C-123s nose and increased power; simultaneously, the loadmaster 
released restraining gates, and a "pusher" helped get the load started 
seaward where it was gravity-fed out of the plane. With proper timing, 
8,000 pounds of cargo could be delivered in one pass into a drop zone 
less than 1,000 feet long. At the same time that the C-123B operational 
test was in progress, a service test of an experimental YC-123H, equipped 
with jet assistance take-off pods and wide track and reduced foot print 
pressure landing gear was service tested in Vietnam and demonstrated load 
carrying advantages in primitive operating conditions. Thus while the 
C-123B was judged to be an optimum counterinsurgency aircraft in Vietnam, 
it was conceivable that, if NCP airlift requirements increased, the C-123B 
force should be augmented with C-123Hs or C-130s.(159) 
Through centralized direction of the utilization of airlift capacity, 
the Southeast Asia Airlift System praised to secure the most economical 
employment of available airlift and to avoid overcrowding of scarce air 
facilities. But while the concept of central direction was stated in MACV 
Directive No. 42, the AOC Airlift Branch did not in fact secure authority 
commensurate with its responsibility. Although VNAF and USAF officers 
jointly manned the AOC Airlift Branch and the TMCs, VNAF C-47s were not 
formally reported as part of the airlift system and separate transport 
frag orders were issued for Vietnamese and American transport planes. The 
lack of a cammon transport frag order and activity reporting system was a 
weakness to central direction, but it seemed more apparent than real. The 
VNAF officers in the AOC Airlift Branch fulfilled RVNAF requirements as 
far as they were able, and the USAF officers picked up requirements beyond 
the capability of VNAF transport planes. The separate frag order procedure 
was also applicable to the situation existing on 5 June, when Washington 
authorities directed that US owned aircraft would not be used for the 
purpose of transporting Vietnamese troops in connection with the Buddhist 
incident in Hue. (160) Although MACV Directive No. 42 provided that the 
16 Caribous of the US Army 1st Aviation Company would support the SEAAS, 
divergent US Army concepts of air transport organization made it difficult 
to integrate these aircraft into the common airlift system and to maximize 
their use in support of NCP airlift plan requirements. As has been seen, 
General Harkins followed Army wishes and committed eight of the Caribous 
to the use of US Army senior corps advisors, leaving eight Caribous for 
common use. In a meeting on 15 January, 315th Group representatives 
received an assurance that the 1st Aviation Company would provide the 
SEAAS with a weekly forecast of Caribou availability to the system. This 
promised forecast would not be provided, and CV-2B Caribou commitments to 
the SEAAS would vary from a daily average of 1.0 airframes in January, to 
1.7 in February, to 1.7 in March, to 1.1 in April, and reached a low of

0.8 in May.(161) On the other hand, the monthly US Army test reports on 
the Caribou stated that CV-2B availability was 10.9 airframes during 
February and 11.6 during March; correspondingly, under MACV directive, 
daily Caribou commitments to the SEAAS should have averaged 2.9 airframes 
for February and 3.6 airframes for March. (162) 
Under the Southeast Asia Airlift System concept there was no reason or 
wisdom in planning to break up and trans-ship air cargoes at arbitrary 
first, second, and third distination airheads provided that the 0-123, with 
its 12 ton carrying capacity, could operate directly into a third 
destination forward airstrip. The system also envisioned maximum employ-
ment of the smaller and lighter Caribou, with its 2 1/2 ton carrying 
capacity, into airstrips where the load-bearing surface could not support 
the heavier C-123B. In the National Campaign Plan, only three specified 
airstrips required the Caribou because of short runway length and low load-
bearing surfaces. In the final NCP airlift plan, 54 second destination 
airheads were arbitrarily to be serviced by Caribous.(163) On the other 
hand, the Army test team engaged in Caribou tests accepted the US Army's 
new concept of airmobile land operations whereby Army transport aircraft 
such as the Caribou and Chinook ought to handle most combat area airlift 
to second and third destinations as a matter of routine. The monthly 
Caribou test report covering March was quite critical of the lack of 
responsiveness of the SEAAS to the needs of users and advocated decentralized 
assignment of CV-2B aircraft to corps areas. (164) The basic doctrinal 
difference between the Air Force concept of centralized control and 
decentralized execution of airlift operations and the Army's concept of 
decentralized assignment of aviation made it difficult to demonstrate that 
predicted NCP airlift tonnage requirements were not materializing, even 
though this was becoming evident in the monthly operational statistics for 
the 315th Troop Carrier Group's C-123s, which were the major operating 
potential of the Southeast Asia Airlift system:

Including USAF T-47 and C-123 operations and tactical as well as NCP 
airlift, the Southeast Asia Airlift'System moved only 3,898 tons during 
May, or 44 percent of the months forecast commitment under the MACV NOP 
airlift plan. In addition, VNAF C-47s and US Amy CV-2Bs operating out-
side the system moved 2,415 tans for .a total airlift movement of 61314 
tons within South Vietnam. In view of the reduction of the forecast NCP 
airlift requirement to 16,500 tons and also because even the reduced NCP 
airlift requirements were not developing, Colonel Tannenbaum informed 
General Osmanski that SEAAS could accomplish the NOP airlift without the 
second Caribou company and the fourth C-123 squadron. (165) 
Late in May Colonel Thomas B. Kennedy, a veteran of the Berlin and 
Korean Airlifts, arrived in South Vietnam to assume the duty as Director 
of Air Transport and Commander 315th Troop Carrier Group. In a visit to 
General Osmanski to introduce Colonel Kennedy as his successor, Colonel 
Tannenbaum was told by Osmanski that he had not shown Tannenbaumls state-
ment of capability to accomplish the NOP airlift without additional Caribous 
to either the MACV J-3 or to General Harkins. Instead, Osmanski said that 
he had determined that the additional Caribou company was necessary and so 
recanmended to General Harkins.(166) In the first half of June, the SEAAS 
was still operating at about 44 percent of the forecast rate, but in a 
discussion of 17 June General Osmanski again affirmed his belief that the 
tonnage projections of the NCP were valid and insisted that, since General 
Harkins intended to use one Caribou company in support of the senior corps 
advisors; a second company would be required to serve with the SEAAS. (167) 
As June continued, the SEAAS had no difficulty meeting NCP requirements 
even though the system handled two special movements into Thailand and the 
relocation of the Army Special Forces from Saigon to Nha Trang, thus using 
considerable airlift outside the NCP commitments. Inside Vietnam, nine 
scheduled SEALS flights were cancelled for non-generation of loads. NCP 
logistical buildups were occurring at the Da Nang, Nha Trang, Qui Nhon, 
and Saigon air terminals, but the prospective use of Can Tho as a primary 
logistical redistribution center was increasingly doubtful since the short 
runway at Can Tho was gradually sinking in the Delta mud. (168) 
Although the reduced MACV NCP airlift projection did not require the 
additional Caribou company, Admiral Felt had initiated action to move 
the heavy equipment of the 61st Aviation Company to Vietnam by sea. Since 
the movement was in progress, Felt informed Harkins on 24 June that the 
planes of the second Caribou Company could proceed to Vung Tau, but he 
stated his desire that both Caribou companies would be included in the 
over-all airlift system and that Amy Otters should provide direct support 
to the corps senior advisors. (169) Issued on 8 July, MACVIIrective No. 44 
assigned both Caribou companies the mission of supporting the SEAM but 
it also provided that the aviation headquarters being established in the 
corps tactical zones would be allocated the types and numbers of aircraft 
which the JGS/RVNAF and MACV jointly adjudged essential for continuous 
support of operations within the corps. Accordingly, the Caribou aircraft

of the newly arriving 61st Aviation Company were allocated to corps 
tactical zones -- three to I CTZ, four to II CTZ, four to III CTZ, and 
four to IV CTZ. Effective on 1 August, the 16 Caribous of the 1st Aviation 
Company were allocated to the SEAAS for common user airlift. (170) In its' 
final report of the Caribou tests, the US Army test team considered that 
MACV Directive No. 44 represented a successful compromise between the Air 
Force concept of centralized single manager airlift and the Army's require-
ment for flexible airlift immediately responsible to individual corps 
requirements. The team report repeated the assertion that experience had 
shown that on occasions the C-123B airplanes operating in the SEALS could 
not react fast enough to meet tactical urgencies. (171) Colonel Kennedy, 
however, pointed out that the charge that the SEAAS lacked quick respon-
siveness to local emergencies was not supported by precise statistical 
data but only by the statement of an Army officer serving as deputy advisor 
in II Corps.(172) Kennedy also noted that the use of the 61st Aviation 
Company's 16 Caribous within the corps areas and outside cognizance of the 
SEAAS led to duplication of routes and duplication of effort provided by 
SEAAS. General Anthis regretted that the establishment of parallel Army 
aviation was not only increasing costs but significantly reducing the 
effectiveness of operations. "In actuality," he wrote, "the long standing 
Air Force principle of a centrally controlled base of resources provides 
greater flexibility and responsiveness than does a system of parcelled 
out resources that can normally be used only in a particular corps geographic 
area. This parcelling out of CV-2B's is only symptomatic of the total effort 
the Army aviation organization is undertaking. "(173) 
As Director of Air Transportation, 2d Air Division, Colonel Kennedy 
was responsible for over-all direction of the Southeast Asia Airlift System 
both in operations in Thailand and in support of the NCP in South Vietnam. 
The system for handling routine logistical requirements was firmed up as 
follows: Vietnamese armed forces and US forces determined their monthly 
estimated requirements for airlift and forwarded them to the Combined 
Movement Allocations Board, which was located in MACV J-4 but operated in 
conjunction with the RVNAF JGS. The Combined Movement Allocation Board 
determined the amount of routine logistical airlift to be allocated to 
each requestor each month and provided the camnitments to the Transport 
Movement Control Section of the Air Operations Center, an agency jointly 
manned by VNAF air transport officers and the 315th Group's Combat 
Operations Section. In addition to routine logistical activity, the SEAAS 
responded to on-call operations of preplanned and emergency nature. In 
preplanned operations the SEAAS normally sought 24 to 48 hours advance 
notice of an airlift mission requirement. Emergency airlift requirements 
required response on as little as 15 minutes notice, often by diversion of 
aircraft in flight. The three aircraft kept on alert at Tan Son Nhut 
and the single alert transport at Da Nang also responded to emergencies.(174) 
Each of the three USAF C-123 squadrons committed eight aircraft each day to 
the SEAAS. Early in August the 1st Aviation Company had some maintenance 
difficulties that held down its in-commission rate, but by the end of the 
month it was also committing eight Caribous to the SEAAS each day. The

committed aircraft were fragged by the AOC/TMC, and a full-time liaison 
officer from the 1st AVCO was assigned to. the AOC/TMC to keep the status 
and .reports of the Caribous current.(175)_ The _SEAAS?also controlled the 
transport operations of:the theist Air Commando Squadron's .C-47s, two of the. 
644/S and :ffiFee-Sthe-i-C-=1-23-Iing stationed at Nha Trang for use in 
supporting Army Special Forces.(176) The VNAF air transport activity 
remained outside the SEAAS, receiving requirements from the JGS and 
issuing a separate airlift frag order. Based on his awn observations, 
Colonel Kennedy felt that the VNAF air transport group did not commit 
enough of its 31 C-47s to daily Airlift missions and noted that it was a 
rare day when more than 5 of the Vietnamese transport aircraft flew airlift. 
He recognized, however, that VNAF was engaged in extensive flight training 
to increase the number of its qualified transport crews.(177) Any 
capability of the 61st Aviation Oompany found in excess of senior corps 
advisor's requirements was in theory to be made available to the SEAAS. 
This did not occur, and, in fact, only in the I Corps did the SEAAS have 
some success in maintaining cognizance of the activity of the Caribous 
allotted to corps support. (178) 
The relatively large logistical airlift requirements specified in the 
MACV National Campaign Plan airlift planning did not develop. In May 
1963, air shipment from Saigon to Can Tho, Nha Trang, Qui Nhon, and Da 
Nang was limited to frozen or chilled items, repair items required to 
remove equipment from deadline, small light-weight expensive equipment 
readily subject to pilferage or damage, items required for relief of 
emergency, mail, and items to prevent work stoppage.(179) By 30 June, 
only 50 percent of the airlift tonnages estimated by MACV were materializing 
at the origin stations; as a result, MACV revised the airlift forecast and 
where the peak of 14,561 'air logistical tonnage had been expected in 
October this was slipped to December.(180) Even after the beginning of 
the offensive phase of the NCP, airlift tonnages requiring shipment failed 
to increase. The requirement for August was only 5,240 tons and for September 
only 6,200 tons.(181) The cargo and passengers carried by the C-123s 
showed little appreciable increase in the last half of 1963:

predicated upon a large number of 30-minute sorties to be flown from the 
coastal airfields. Instead, airlift requirements did not generate in 
expected amounts at the coastal ports, and the average airlift sortie 
continued to run to one to two hours, with a consequent reduction in 
system airlift tonnages. (182) 
By October the Southeast Asia Airlift System had more capacity than 
seemed likely to be needed and plans were made for its reduction. In 
Colonel Kennedy's view, both the C-123 and the Caribou were excellent 
aircraft, though designed against different criteria. The Caribou could 
operate into runways of shorter length and with less load-bearing capacity 
than the C-123, although the C-123 had reversable propellers which on 
wet surfaces, permitted it to land in distances that the Caribou (which 
had not yet been equipped with reverse-pitch propellers) could not manage. 
The C-123s operated into 95 different airfields and some 66 different drop 
zones, most of which were completely uncontrolled as far as air traffic 
was concerned. The Caribous worked well on short distance hauls, where 
smaller air cargo was involved. The 1st Aviation Company was completely 
cooperative with SEAAS management, and, in Colonel Kennedy's estimation, 
showed appreciation of the fact that a centrally controlled airlift could 
guarantee schedule reliability. At the same time, Colonel Kennedy and 
General Anthis agreed that a follow-on counterinsurgency transport ought 
to better the performance of both the C-123 and the Caribou. Kennedy 
recommended an easily-loadable plane with a 20,000 pound cargo capacity, 
possessing short-field landing and takeoff characteristics of approximately 
1,000 feet, and with an ability to operate on soft surfaces such as packed 
dirt or sod strips. Anthis also wanted an intra-theater workhorse. which 
would better the C-123 characteristics. For the time being, both Kennedy 
and Anthis recummended that the C-123 be kept and improved. (183) When 
General Taylor and Secretary McNamara visited Vietnam in late September, 
Anthis pointed out that airlift requirements had not reached MACV's fore-
cast NCP levels, and Secretary McNamara instructed General Harkins that, 
if either a C-123 squadron or a Caribou Company could be released, the 
Caribou squadron should be released first and returned to the United 
States. (184) In its December reassessment of NCP airlift support require-
ments, MAN reduced the over-all 16,500 tons per month to 10,100 tons. 
Accordingly, personnel of the 1st Aviation Company, the USAF "Dirty Thirty" 
C-47 pilots that had been flying with VNAF, and half of the 8th Aerial Post 
Squadron's manpower were released as a part of the 1,000-man reduction in 
MACV strength. The US Army 61st Aviation Company remained in Vietnam in 
support of corps senior advisors, and the Amy retained 22-25 CV-2Bs in 
South Vietnam, part of these Caribous being designated as "float" aircraft 
or spares which insured that each corps area would have available an 
allocated number of operational aircraft. Once again, as had been the 
practice prior to August, two Caribou aircraft were allocated each day to 
the SEAAS by tail number. If these particular aircraft were out of 
commission, the SEAAS could not schedule them. (18)

Unlike the other large airlifts to Berlin and in Korea, the Southeast 
Asia Airlift System was called upon to devote a large amount of its effort 
to tactical operations. In 1963 about 30 percent of the troop carrier . 
operations were tactical, including paradrop resupply, airborne paratroop 
flights, and assault airlandings. AS has been seen, the SEAAS made 
determined efforts -- including committed airframes at Da Nang and the 
Nha Trang -- to give maximum support to the Special Forces. In airlift 
emergencies of 1964 the special commitments at Da Nang and Nha Trang 
would complicate efficient airlift scheduling, but in 1963 Colonel Morton, 
commander US Army Special Forces, Vietnam, praised the reliability and 
responsibility of C-47 and C-123 operations. Many special forces units 
in remote areas were supported by air drops, these occurring at scattered 
locations anywhere in relatively large areas, the precise drop place 
commonly changing from day to day. Both the Mule Train C-123s and the Air 
Commando C-47s received commendations for their accurate drops. In 
August, the US Army test units pointed out that air drops to Special Force 
A-teams were very expensive because of the cost of parachutes and rigging 
and recommended that more use be made of resupply by helicopters or light 
aircraft. In response to a request from MACV to justify the amount of 
supplies delivered by parachute during the week of 8-15 October, however, 
US Army Special Forces cited the factthat helicopter delivery of supplies 
was possible only if helicopters were available and the distance fram the 
supply point to the detachment was within range. Even if helicopters 
were suitable for a particular mission, they were frequently not available 
because of other corps commitments. If available, there were occasions 
when their use was not practical. Thus on 9 October, the delivery of 13,860 
pounds to a Special Force DZ at Ta Bat would have required 14 H-34 sorties, 
each involving 110 minutes flying time per round trip, as campared to two 
C-123 sorties actually reauired to airdrop the supplies. Based at Da Nang 
and also staging C-123s to Nha Trang, the 777th (redesignated the 311th) 
Troop Carrier Squadron handled much of the Special Forces support. In 
addition to this, the 777th received a personal cammendation from General 
Anthis for the facility with whibh it accomplished an airborne assault 
lift in support of the JGS directed air movement of troops and equipment 
into the Plateau Gi airstrip on 28 April. Fourteen assault missions airlifted 
459 ARVN troops and 13.2 tons of arms and nmunition into the marginal 
airstrip in a decidedly "know haw" manner well within the time limits 
established for the mission. (l8&) 
With properly detailed preplanning and pre-mission briefings, the C-123 
crews were consistently able to navigate to unfamiliar areas and place their 
para-bundles in pinpoint drop zones, even in the Delta where changing water 
levels made it difficult to select land marks and maps did not reflect day-
to-day topography. Properly conducted airborne paratroop operations 
demanded the same highly coordinated preplanning, but here the RVNAF Joint 
General Staff habitually provided very little preliminary notice of an 
impending airborne operation. Without exception, Colonel Kennedy's first

knowledge of impending paratroop missions came from rumors, followed by 
informal notification from various sources. At times, he went through VNAF 
and queried whether the OGS might be contemplating an airborne operation. 
Allegedly to preserve secrecy, all exact details about an airborne operation 
were closely held until frequently it was too late for detailed operational 
preplanning and crew briefings. As a rule, the VNAF 0-47 crews knew the 
areas over which they were called upon much more intimately than the 0-123 
crews and therefore suffered less from the generally inadequate pre-mission 
preparation. Designated drop zones were usually small, and the C-123s 
were frequently required to drop their troops on the chutes of the troops 
dropped from VNAF C-47s. This practice presented several problems. 
Positive early identification of olive-drab parachutes was extremely 
difficult. Moreover, the C-123s were faster and carried twice the number 
of paratroops as the C-47s, with the result that they could not drop their 
stick of paratroops in the same distance as the C-47s. On a purely 
mathematical basis, if the 0-123 put its first man on the first chute 
dropped from a C-47, the last of the 48 men aboard the 0-123 would land 
1,450 feet beyond the 22d or last man dropped from the 0-47. The 0-123 
crews were usually briefed to expect detailed instructions from a VNAF FAC 
over the drop zone, but this was extremely difficult when the FAC, fighters, 
and troop carrier aircraft were talking on the same frequency, in two 
languages, at the same time. (187) 
Under these circumstances, the 0-123 crews had difficulty handling 
paratroop operations. In the III CTZ operation north of Berta on 28 
January 1963, C-47s and C-123s were called upon to place 1,400 paratroopers 
in a jungle clearing 400 x 750 meters in dimensions, the C-123s being 
instructed to have the first man in the stick brush the inside branches of 
the trees, or words to that effect. In a rather remarkably successful 
operation under such risky circumstances, one paratrooper was killed 
because of a severed static line and 14 were injured in tree landings. (188) 
In subsequent operations -- on 14 March in Long An province, on 21 March 
in Vinh Long province, on 24 March in Tay Ninh province, and on 10 June 
in Tay Ninh province -- the C-123s had difficulty putting all of their 
paratroopers in the drop zones. Although ultimately a success, the para-
troop operation in An Xuyen province on 10 September developed significant 
difficulties. Based on rumor, the 315th Group recovered and reconfigured 
six C-123s at 1235 hours. The troops were not chuted at specified takeoff 
time of 1540, and the C-123s did not get off until 1610, when the planes 
proceeded individually trying to make up as much lost time as possible. 
In the waning light, chutes that had been dropped by VNAF C-47s were not 
visible, but all parachutists were nevertheless placed in the drop zone. 
On 20 October in Bien Duong province, the 0-123 crews were briefed to drop 
on a FAC 's smoke marker, but the transport crews were greatly confused by 
other smoke dropped to mark fighter targets, and in the confusion 338 men 
were dropped four kilometers from the selected drop zone. The worst tragedy, 
however, would occur on 24 November in An Xuyen province. In this 
operation, the 0-123 crews were assured in the pre-mission briefing that

maps which showed the Cal Nuoc river as lying within the drop zone were 
erroneous. Instructions were to begin drops on chutes from VNAF 
As it happened, the C-47s dropped long and the C-123s dropped even longer, 
with the result that eight men drawned.in the Cal Nuoc river, the feature 
that was not supposed to be there. Most of the C-123 paratroopers landed 
on the far side of the river, where they were out of action during the 
fighting. (189) 
Immediately following the An Xuyen mixup, General Anthis called on 
Colonel Kennedy to solve the navigation problem; Maj General Tran Van Don, 
Chief of the aas, directed the VNAF commander to avoid such deficiencies 
in the future; and the US Army Advisor with the ARVN Airborne Brigade 
reported that parachutists would likely became reluctant to jump from the 
C-123s.if such errors persisted. Colonel Kennedy promptly took actions 
on items under his authority, many of which had been under way for some time. 
The most highly qualified personnel were designated as lead crews and given 
training on peculiar navigation problems. An English-speaking VNAF 
navigator was requested to assist the 0-123 leader. The C-123s were 
instructed to use their tactical troop carrier channel for inter-plane 
communications during airborne operations. No drop would be made, 
regardless of briefed instructions, if there was any doubt in the lead 
crew's mind as to the identificatibn of the drop zone. Beyond these and 
other like actions, Kennedy pointed out that the fundamental requirement 
was to get.more notice from the JIGS of an impending airborne operation and 
a guaranteed minimum of one hour between the notification of the exact drop 
zone and take-off time, this to allow the minimum essential time for 
planning, crew briefing, aid manning of aircraft. (190) In turn, General 
Anthis asked General Harkins to recognize that "we need to get the aas to 
release information sooner than is now being done and in an orderly 
fashion. "(191) 
By this time, however, the airborne assault problem was becoming even 
more complex. Under the "Fire Brigade" alert plan five VNAF C-47s and 
three USAF C-123s had been maintained in constant readiness to drop two 
companies of ARVN paratroopers, but by November 1963 increased Vietcong 
strength and firepower required a response with at least a full ARVN air-
borne battalion. The number of C-47s and C-123s required to lift a battalion 
could not be held on alert but would have to be marshalled from planes 
committed to daily airlift. The reasonable solution would be for the JIGS 
to provide adequate advance notice of impending airborne operations, but 
Vietnamese officers would continue to maintain secrecy until the last 
moment. Both VNAF and the Airborne Brigade would be powerless to change 
the ingrained practice, and, in a continuing struggle not to be caught short, 
USAF officers would be ?ampelled to run down every shred of rumor indicating 
that an airborne operation might be in the offing. (192)

7. Collapse of the Diem Government Precipitates Military Crisis  
"If Diem goes," the US Joint Chiefs of Staff had advised Secretary 
McNamara on 14 April 1962, "we can be sure of losing his strengths but 
we cannot be sure of remedying his weaknesses. Achievement of US 
objectives could be more difficult without Diem than with him."(193) In a 
description of the political climate in South Vietnam in February 1963, 
General Moorman noted that Diem wielded dictatorial power and that except 
for an agreement to permit popular election of local functionaries in the 
strategic hamlets he was not likely to move toward more liberal procedures 
in the foreseeable future, especially at the higher levels of government. 
Moorman's assessment showed understanding of Diem's position, pointing out 
that Diem recognized that the Vietcong were willing to accept a coalition 
government which they could dominate and a neutralization of South Vietnam 
similar to the arrangement on laos.(194) In August and September 1963, 
General Anthis believed that President Diem was "fairly well liked" by his 
people, although he had not provided all the reforms that the people (and 
the United States) wanted. On the other hand, Diem's brother and sister-
in-law Ngo Dinh Nhu and Madam Nhu -- were "not too popular." In September, 
Anthis told Secretary McNamara and 'General Taylor that "VNAF loyalty was 
unquestionable for President Diem and to country but they were ashamed of 
SVN image created in eyes of world by GVN actions as controlled by the 
Nhu's."(195) General Jacob E. Smart, who had assumed command of PACAF on 
1 August 1963, spent 5-8 September in South Vietnam and messaged his 
observations to General LeMay: "My own feeling," Smart stated, "is that 
if we intend to remain committed in Viet Nam -- and I believe that it is 
strongly in the national interest that we do so -- then we must support 
Diem. Whether we like him' or his family is not germane. . . . My 
conclusion is that we must stick with Diem and that we must quickly 
demonstrate this by positivi action even though we may have to pay same 
price in terms of embarrassment because of what has come to pass. We are 
probably going to have to Swallow the fact that Diem will not exile his 
brother out of RVN, and from my discussions I am not at all convinced that 
this should be our objective. I get distinct impression from Vietnamese 
that he is valuable and important to Diem, just as Diem is important to the 
nation. "(196) 
At the 6 May 1963 Secretary of Defense Conference in Honolulu, 
Ambassador Nolting characterized US-Republic of Vietnam as being "somewhat 
less good" than they had been six months earlier. Nolting described Diem's 
concern that the United States was infringing on South Vietnam's sovereignty 
and Nhuls demands for phasing-down American Special Forces, Rural Aid 
Advisors, and Sector Advisors, or the portion of the advisory effort that 
had created jealousies and conflicts in Diem's political base. Nolting also 
mentioned that Diem and Nhu were suspicious of American policy: the Mansfield 
report and the deterioration of the situation in Laos were interpreted as 
harbingers of weakening US policy in support of South Vietnam. Although US 
economic assistance was financing the major portion of the counterinsurgency 
program in Vietnam, Diem objected that US controls over the Vietnamese

contribution of counterpart piasters on the grounds that this degraded 
Vietnamese internal sovereignty. Nolting described Nhu as amen who was 
"efficient and continues to accumulate power." Despite these causes for 
concern Nolting emphasized: "The Country Team is of the unanimous opinion" 
that the current RVN leadership is the best the US can get. It is sincere, 
albeit not particularly adept, but it is better than most in Southeast Asia." 
In the discussion of this political report, Secretary McNamara asked about 
his impression that there was a great exaggeration of Diem's dictatorial 
powers as campared to Thailand. Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman, 
who was present at the conference, replied that Sarit was a popular and 
efficient dictator, whereas the liberal wing of the US press was using 
inefficiency as a weapon against the Diem government. (197) 
In a celebration of Buddha's birthday in Hue on 8 May, Buddhist 
demonstrators openly paraded with religious flags in violation of the 
ordnance going back to Bao Dai's government in 1950 which had prohibited 
flying of any other flag in public unless the national flag was beside it, 
and a monk, Thich Tri Quang, delivered a sermon protesting the Diem govern-
ment's discrimination against Buddhists. Civil guard troops moved against 
the Buddhists, and in the ensuing riot an explosion killed several civilians 
including children. In communique to the press, the monks demanded that 
government admit responsibility for the loss of life, rescind the flag 
regulation, and give Buddhists equality with Catholics. (198) At the same 
time the Buddhist problem was beginning to fester, articles recording an 
Anti-American interview given by Ngo Dinh Nhu to an American reporter were 
printed in a Washington newspaper, On 15 May, Chairman Otto Passman, whose 
Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations was holding hearings 
on foreign appropriations .for 1964, expressed indignation to Secretary 
McNamara. "Certainly," Passman said, "the Diem government ought to be made 
to understand that the American people have no interest in propping up an 
unpopular regime if it is more concerned with the pursuit of personal aims 
than with the protection of the country fram communism." Nhuls interview 
was embarrassing to President Kennedy. On 22 May he told newsmen that he 
was hopeful that the military sitUation would permit the. withdrawal of 
some Americans by the end of the year. If requested to withdraw troops, 
the United States would do so immediately. (199) 
In May President Diem received a delegation of Buddhists but offered 
no redress pending investigation of the controversy (which he considered to 
be political rather than religious) by a committee headed by Vice President 
Nguyen Ngoc Tho, who was a Buddhist. Early in June the demonstrations 
began again in BUG and spread to Quang Tri and Nha Trang. In a policy 
directive on 5 June, Washington directed that US awned aircraft would not 
be used to transport Vietnamese troops in connection with the Buddhist 
incident, and General Harkins issued directions that members of his command 
would stand aloof from the controversy, neither taking positions nor actively 
aiding or abetting either protagonist. The turmoil appeared to quiet after 
Diem broadcast an acknowledgment of errors committed by same government

officials, but in Saigon on 11 June an aged Buddhist bonze burned himself 
alive publicly. On 14 June a New York newspaper printed a front-page story 
by a Washington correspondent stating that the United States would publicly 
condemn Diem's treatment of the Buddhists if he did not settle their 
grievances promptly. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Thuan 
immediately informed US Minister William Truehart, who was in charge of 
the American Embassy during Ambassador Noltingfs temporary absence, that he 
was "deeply distressed and angry" about the news story, which would "ruin" 
negotiations with the Buddhists. Accordingly, Truehart asked for and 
received authority from Washington to state publicly that there had been no 
change in US policy to support the Government of Vietnam and that the 
United States was gratified at the progress in negotiations with the 
Buddhists. In continuing negotiations on 15-18 June, the Government yielded 
to most Buddhist demands but refused to assume official responsibility for 
the deaths in Hue until an investigation was campleted.(200) 
Several months before the Buddhist trouble Ambassador Nolting had 
requested to be relieved in Saigon for personal reasons, and on 27 June 
President Kennedy announced that Henry Cabot lodge would succeed Nolting.(201) 
After several weeks quiet, the Buddhists again demonstrated on 16 July 
when crowds of bonzes and nuns congregated in front of Noltingls residence 
in Saigon, demanding that the United States compel the Government to keep 
its promises to the Buddhists. Violence erupted next day as the Saigon 
police broke up continuing demonstrations. At this juncture, the US Air 
Attache in Saigon, Lt Colonel Robert L. F. Tyrrell, messaged Washington 
that the Buddhist situation was "causing continued animosity between the 
government and the armed forces and is spreading to all segments of the 
population. It is now common to hear Vietnamese discuss the possible over-
throw of the present government." Tyrrell reported that at a dinner party 
on 17 July, Maj General Duong Van Minh, Diem's military advisor, stated 
that "the present government cannot continue," and revealed that Lt General 
Le Van Ty, RVNAF Chief of Staff, and counted to be very loyal to Diem, had 
cancer and would have to go to the United States in the near future for 
treatment. Tyrrell reported speculation that Minh, who had the popular 
support of the military forces, or Maj General Tran Van Don, the Chief of 
Staff of the Joint General Staff and considered the professionally most 
qualified military officer, would head a coup. "While at this time," 
Tyrrell messaged, "we cannot determine if a coup is imminent all of the 
elements are present and it appears to us to be only a matter of timing. "(202) 
In Washington shortly after he was nominated to go to Vietnam, Lodge had a 
long talk with a "distinguished Vietnamese" who said that "unless they left 
the country no power on earth could prevent the assassination of Mr. Diem, 
his brother, Mr. Nhu, and Mr. Nu's wife -- that the situation . . . had 
developed to a point where their deaths were inevitable. "(203) On 17 July 
President Kennedy expressed hope that same solution could be reached for the 
Buddhist dispute, which, he said, "certainly began as a religious dispute." 
He was also hopeful that the Vietnamese people could "reach an agreement on 
the civil disturbances and also in respect to the rights of others. "(201)

In Vietnam, Buddhist leaders strongly criticized Ambassador Nolting's 
statement that he saw no signs of religious persecution and felt that the 
demonstrations were impeding the war against the Vietcong. Between 4 and 
16 August several more well-publicized self-immolations took place. At 
Nha Trang, the VNAF base commander expressed the opinion that the purpose 
of the demonstrations and immolations was to impress Ambassador Lodge with 
the seriousness of the Buddhist trouble at his arrival in Saigon on 22 
August. At the Presidential palace, Madame Nhu charged that the US Embassy 
had threatened and blackmailed the South Vietnamese government to make her 
stop talking. She said that the government should ignore the immolations. (205) 
Informed persons in Saigon expected sweeping and decisive changes in 
policy from Ambassador ledge, and President Diem may have decided to clear 
the decks before Lodge's arrival. At approximately 2100 hours on 20 August, 
the RVNAF Joint General Staff was called into an emergency meeting and Tran 
Van Don took over as RVNAF Chief of Staff, replacing the ailing le Van Ty. 
On Nhu's invitation, the senior generals signed a remonstrance calling on 
the government to seize and silence the Buddhist leaders of the agitation. 
At 2400 hours, Diem declared a state of siege to insure the security of the 
rear areas. General Dinh, III CTZ;Cammander, was named Military Commander 
of the Saigon-Cholon area, while General Tri was named Military Commander of 
Hue and of I CTZ. Although under nominal ARVN authority, Vietnamese Special 
Forces and special police stormed Buddhist pagodas in Hue and Saigon before 
dawn on 21 August, detaining monks andnuns but missing Thich Tri Quang, 
who took refuge in the US embassy. In a conversation with Harkins on 23 
August, Don emphasized he intended to keep a buffer between the people and 
the troops, to use the police to maintain order and the Army only if the 
police were not able to cope with Conditions. While Don emphasized that 
he took orders from Diem and not Nhu, he let Harkins know that Dinh was 
receiving instructions directly rather than through him and that Special 
Forces and police were receiving orders neither through himself nor Dinh. 
Don wanted martial law to end as soon as possible. He urged that the United 
States should continue to support Diem but force him to clean house, try to 
show him how to run the government by delegating authority of ministers and 
broadening his narrow outlook. Don's suggestion -- which he asked not to be 
attributed to him -- was the establishment of an interim mixed military and 
civilian cabinet, with Minh to be Interior Minister and responsible for 
maintaining law and order, the incumbent Brig General Tran Tu Oai to retain 
the Ministry of Information, and another general to be Minister of Defense, 
with Minister Thuan remaining as Secretary of State to the Presidency. (206) 
The raids on the pagodas strengthened the position of men in Washington 
who had never completely trusted President Diem or his family. On 21 
August, Undersecretary of State George Ball released an official statement 
that the United States deplored repressive actions of the nature of those 
instituted against the Buddhist leaders. (207) Within the State Department 
there was a feeling that the United States must use the leverage of economic 
and military assistance to stand up to Diem and Nhu. On 24 August, while

President Kennedy was at his summer hame at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, 
and other senior officials were away for the weekend, Hilaman, Ball, 
Harriman, and Forrestal drafted and cleared with Deputy Secretary of Defense 
Gilpatric and General Taylor a message of instructions to Ambassador lodge. 
The message stated that the United States could no longer tolerate the 
systematic repression of the Buddhists nor the domination of the regime by 
Nhu. The Vietnamese generals could be told that the United States would 
find it impossible to support Diem unless an acceptable solution was found 
to the Buddhist problem and a more responsive and representative government 
formed. Diem should be given every chance to solve the problems, but, if he 
refused, the possibility had to be faced that he could not be saved. The 
United States would take no part in the action, but, if anything happened, 
an interim anti-communist military regime could expect American support.(208) 
On 26 August, the Voice of America beamed a broadcast in Vietnamese stating 
that high American officials said that Nhu and not Vietnamese military 
leaders was responsible for the attacks on the pagodas and mass arrests of 
monks and students, that top Vietnamese military leadership had agreed to 
martial law but were not advised of secret police plans to attack Buddhists, 
and that the United States might sharply reduce its aid unless Diem got rid 
of the officials who were really responsible for the attacks.(209) On 21 
August an Embassy message had informed the State Department that the Vietnamese 
generals appeared to have an ability to depose Diem, but as Don explained to 
Harkins on 23 August the generals were actually stalemated since none of them 
had a complete control of the Special Forces responsible to Nhu. In a 
refutation of the VOA broadcast on 27 August, a Joint General Staff communique 
stated that the responsible ARVN commanders had unanimously proposed martial 
law to Diem and the measures related to it. (210) 
In the week after his arrival in Saigon on 22 August, Ambassador lodge 
was absolutely convinced that the Diem government was in its terminal phase 
because its abuse of the police power had aroused the deep resentment of 
the Vietnamese people.(211) In Washington, Secretary Rusk also told the 
returning Nolting that the US Government had turned against Diem because of 
the Buddhist immolations. According to Nolting, Rusk said: "We can't stand 
any more burning."(212) At a National Security Council discussion of Vietnam 
on 28 August, Nolting urged that a decision not to go along with Diem and 
Nhu would be to renege on past commitments. Ball, on the other hand, expressed 
the view that the consequences of continuing to support Diem and Nhu would 
be that the war against the Vietcong could not be won and he said that he 
did not agree with Nolting since Diem and Nhu had violated their commitments --
and massively. Harriman cammented that he had disagreed with Nolting's views 
for many months and felt that Nolting had been profoundly wrong in his advice 
to go along with Diem. Bileman agreed with Ball and Harriman.(213) According 
to Nolting, Vice President Lyndon Johnson was one of the few advisors to 
President Kennedy to recammend against undermining Diem. In years to acme, 
Nolting would continue to blame himself for this failure to persuade President 
Kennedy and the State Department that Diem's "moral integrity" was a source 
of strength in Vietnam and that his deposition would be a tragedy for both 
Vietnam and the United States. (211.)

News reports of alleged persecutions of Buddhists had worldwide 
repercussions. Citing border ciolations and ill-treatment of the Buddhists, 
Cambodia broke diplomatic relations with South Vietnam on 27 August. On 
29 August President Charles Die Gaulle offered France's good offices for the. 
reestablishment of peace and harmony in Indochina. On the following day, 
De Gaulle's statement was revealed to be part of a long-range French 
political solution looking toward a reunification of North and South Vietnam 
in "independence and neutrality."(215) At the request of Asian and African 
members of the United Nations, Secretary General U Thant wrote Diem on 31 
August asking him to ensure "the ekercise of fundamental human rights to all 
sections of the population" of South Vietnam.(216) On 31 August, Chiang Kai 
Shek talked at length about South Vietnam with General Smart, making it 
specifically clear that everything the United States did there was closely 
watched by all Asia and that it we's essential that the United States would 
win. In Thailand, influential figures including Lefense Minister Thanom and 
Dawee talked with Smart about Vietnam. As Buddhists, they were unhappy 
about the religious problem, but Dawee recognized that the conflict was more 
political than religious. The Thai leaders were more concerned about Communist 
gains in Southeast Asia than unhappy about the religious problem. Still 
mindful of US actions with respect to Laos, they did not hesitate to express 
doubt as to US reliability in the event of their awn need.(217) In responding 
to U Thant on 5 September, Diem also emphasized that there had been no 
suppression of Buddhism and that government actions were attempting to free 
the Buddhist hierarchy from political agitation and propaganda, which was 
working for the benefit of foreign interests and against the interests of 
the Buddhist religion and the higher interests of the state. Diem invited 
U Thant to send a UN fact-finding mission to Vietnam. This investigation would 
be discontinued as no longer useful after 1 November, but the Costa can 
member of the mission would state that he personally found no religious 
discrimination or persecution ann.that the trouble involved only a small 
part of the Buddhist community and was oolitical.(218) 
Unlike U Thant's investigation, DeGaulle's proposal to unify and 
neutralize Vietnam profoundly affected the political situation in Saigon. 
Ngo Dinh Nhu freely admitted to having contacts with National Liberation 
Front leaders,(219) and during the late summer of 1963 the US Department 
of State received reports that Nhu had been and continued to be in contact 
with North Vietnam and the NLF, presumably for the purpose of exploring the 
possibility of reaching an agreement along the lines of a Gaullist reunified, 
neutral Vietnam. In conversations in Saigon, the French Ambassador reportedly 
urged that Nhu should be supported because he had contacts in the north and 
could work out arrangements on hostilities with the Vietcong. On 2 September, 
Nhu told Lodge that he had had a conversation with the Polish member of the 
International Control Commission, who had sought to elicit Nhu's reaction to 
de Gaulle's proposal so that he could transmit it to North Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Pham Van Dong.(220) Newsman Joseph Alsop reported Nhuls contacts 
with the north in a New York newspaper on 18 September(221), and MACV reported 
that many top level ARVN officers seemed to be convinced that Nhu would make 
a deal with Hanoi if he felt that this was in his best interest.(222) After

the coup, military junta leaders would extensively question Colonel Hien as 
to whether he had flown Nhu into Zone D to meet with NLF leaders to discuss 
a coalition government, an allegation which Hien steadfastly denied. (223) 
Unlike Ambassador Nolting who had used the country team to secure a 
policy consensus, Ambassador Lodge ran the US Mission after his arrival on 
22 August as "a one-man operation, conducted in total secrecy." Even General 
Harkins was left in the dark on Lodge's activities and his cable traffic. 
Getting nowhere with Diem and Nhu and possibly because he considered the days 
of the Diem government to be numbered, Lodge stopped seeing them.(224) After 
a time, on Washington's direction, lodge would restore the country team, but, 
early in September, General Smart noted that: "The American team in RVN 
left me with an impression of a divided house and diverapnt di-par-Finns " 
Smart said that opinions about Diem ran the gamut from 
 view that Diem could be supported and that Nhu was useful to an 
opposite conviction that the Diem government must be eliminated without 
consideration as to what would replace it. (22S) An analysis of the reports 
t,hat flowed to Washington from Embassy, MACV, and the Air Ittache in the 
period following martial law revealed markedly differing opinions. MACV 
reports were rather conservative in the information included and in their 
speculations; the Embassy traffic evidenced a heightened, but constrained, 
apprehension toward the evolving situation; and Air Attache messages tended 
to report the more brutal and terroristic incidents, the more radical views 
of intelligence sources, and speculated upon more extreme eventualities. (226) 
In view of the divergent intelligence, Secretary McNamara would later direct 
that the service attaches attached to the American Embassy in Saigon would be 
deleted, remarking that he meant to have established a singular military 
intelligence reporting system.(227) Early in September 1963, however, the 
Embassy and MACV were unable to agree on a common appraisal of the attitudes 
of key segments of the Vietnamese population toward Diem, Nhu, and the Buddhist 
crisis.(228) Sent to Vietnam as a two-man fact-finding team, Joseph Mendenhall 
of the State Department and Maj General Victor Krulak returned to Washington 
with such different reports that President Kennedy, after hearing their 
briefing, asked whether they were sure they had visited the same country. (229) 
In an appearance on a national television program on 2 September, 
President Kennedy estimated that the Government of Vietnam could not win the 
war without popular support, and, in his opinion, the Government had gotten 
out of touch with the people. The repressions against the Buddhists had 
been very unwise. In response to a question as to whether the Government 
had time to regain support of the people, Kennedy said: "I do. With changes 
in policy and perhaps with personnel I think it can. If it doesn't make 
those changes, I would think that the chances of winning it would not be 
very good."(230) In order to bring pressure on Diem, Lodge recommended 
suspension of American aid, but Rusk and McNamara were opposed, fearing that 
it would hurt the war effort. In another television interview on 9 September, 
Kennedy also stated that he did not think it would be helpful to reduce aid 
to South Vietnam at that time. (231)

By mid-September, President Kennedy appeared to be coming to a conclusion 
that Lodge, Harriman, lineman, and Forrestal were right on the question of 
increased pressure, but on 21 September he sent Secretary McNamara and General 
Taylor on one more trip to South Vietnam, the purposes being to get additional 
information and to attempt to encourage Diem to attend to the serious problems 
in his government. In the initial conference with McNamara and Taylor on the 
morning of 25 September, Ambassador lodge was pessimistic about the Diem 
regime, but from other briefings and observations in Saigon and in the field, 
McNamara and Taylor reached the conclusion that the military effort had not 
deteriorated and still had momentum, though additional emphasis would need 
to be given to pacification operations in the Delta. The McNamara party 
judged that the Diem regime was continuing to consolidate its strength and 
control throughout the country and had been successful in dividing the 
factions opposing it. Some of the military were hostile to the Diem regime, 
but the military was more hostile toward the Vietcong and likely to continue 
to support Diem. McNamara's group was reluctant to take any action to cut 
off any economic aid. McNamara nevertheless saw three major problems: 
That, although substantial progress had been made, more effective military 
action was required against the Vietcong; that political unrest in South 
Vietnam was growing and was caused by the Diem regime; and that (most serious 
of all) there were internal political problems in the United States 
associated with the first two problems. He felt that a persuasive case must 
be put to the US public and Congress in order to gain support for the 
Administration's handling of the conflict in South Vietnam. In a conference 
with Diem,. MnNamara emphasized that South Vietnam's leadership must conduct 
Its military and political effort in a way that would win US political 
support and reminded Diem that there were serious problems in the Government 
that required correction. As for the US military advisory effort, McNamara 
and Taylor announced their conviction that with an accelerated schedule for 
victory the major part of the US military task could be completed by the 
end of calendar year 1965, by which time the insurgency should be reduced to 
sporAdic banditry in outlying areas. McNamara and Taylor also announced that 
the 1,000-man US military advisor cut by the end of 1963 would proceed as 
scheduled. (232) 
On 2 October, following a National Security Council discussion of the 
McNamara-Taylor report and Lodge's recommendations, President Kennedy 
approved a statement of US policy. The United States would continue to work 
with the people and Government of South Vietnam to deny the country to 
Communism and to suppress the externally stimulated and supported Vietcong 
insurgency as promptly as possible. The military program was sound in 
principle and had made progress, though improvements were being sought. On 
the political level, the statement noted: "The political situation in 
South Viet-Nam remains deeply serious. The United States has made clear its 
continuing opposition to any repressive actions in South Viet-Nam. While 
such actions have not yet significantly affected the military effort, they 
could do so in the future."(233) According to Presidential Assistant 
Schlesinger, Secretary McNamara returned to Washington with personal doubts

whether Diem could last even if he took corrective action and was more 
inclined to agree with Lodge that there was no alternative to US pressure 
on Diem. McNamara would later state that he had begun to observe that the 
erosion of public confidence was effecting military operations. He feared 
that Diem would continue his repressive measures and remain in power but 
would lose public support and military operations would be adversely affected; 
or, alternatively, Diem would continue his repressive measures and build up 
so much resistance that he would be thrown out. (23).i.) 
Events in Saigon early in October were not assuring to authorities in 
Washington. On 4 October, Vietnamese plainclothes police physically assaulted 
American newsmen, provoking a serious protest from Ambassador lodge. On the 
following dgy, another Buddhist monk, in the sixth and most publicized of 
all the immolations, burned himself in Saigon. On 17 October Nhu declared 
to the press that he could not understand why the United States had "initiated 
a process of disintegration in Vietnam" and again accused the CIA of 
instigating a coup against the Diem government. (235) To Assistant Secretary 
of State Hilsman, Diem had cut himself off fram his people and fram the 
United States. The United States could not continue to provide aid that 
was being used to repress the Buddhists and to arrest students.(236) On 16 
October the Senate Foreign Relations Cammittee approved an amendment to the 
foreign aid authorization bill expressing the sense of Congress that aid 
should be extended to or withheld from Vietnam, as the President determined, 
only "to further the objectives of victory in the war against communism and 
the return to their homeland of Americans involved in that struggle. "(237) 
In September, in the aftermath of the pagoda raids, the United States had 
already begun to delay commercial import program assistance which among 
other things, generated piasters used to pay the RVNAF, but this action 
would not immediately affect the military effort since South Vietnam had 
accumulated savings through the CIP that could be spent, reducing any 
immediate effect of delayed US assistance. (238) On 21 September a South 
Vietnamese spokesman revealed that the United States was holding up the 
CIP and had also warned that it would cut -off aid to ARVN Special Forces 
if they were used for political purposes. On 22 October, the US State 
Department confirmed that South Vietnam had been told that US support 
would no longer be provided to the elements of the Special Forces which 
were not committed to field operations or engaged in related training 
programs.(239) In Washington, Mlavid E. Bell, Administrator, Agency for 
International Development, would explain that the United States was not 
attempting to force Diem out of office but instead only to change his 
policies. The US AID Administrator in Saigon, however, observed that it 
was undoubtedly the realization that the United States could not be bluffed 
into restoring import financing that finally set off the coup against Diem. (240) 
On 21 July Admiral Felt had advised the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the 
Vietnamese generals were thinking about coup action, though it was unlikely 
that they were united or knew how to proceed. But as time passed, a major 
plot against Diem polarized under the leadership of Generals Duong Van Minh,

Tran Van Don, and Le Van Kim, and ultimately reflected a coalition of 
older men who wanted to overthrow Diem's dedicated anti-communist govern-
ment in order to seek a neutralist solution to the war and younger officers 
who still wanted to win the war and believed they could do it better. (241) 
The plotters obtained promises of cooperation from Generals Do Cao Tri in 
I CTZ and Nguyen Khanh in II CTZ and subsequently recruited General Ton 
That Dinh, who commander the III CTZ and was also military governor of 
Saigon. Troops from Dinh's 5th Division would be used in the coup, but it 
would be necessary to neutralize General Huynh Van Cao, the IV CTZ commander, 
who would remain loyal to Diem and whose 7th Division was at My Tho, in 
close proximity south of Saigon. Ironically, Diem's agreement announced on 
19 October to shift of the III CTZ boundary to the Mekong River and transfer 
of the 7th Division to the III Corps, both to be affected on 1 November, 
provided a necessary ingredient for the successful revolt and may have 
dictated the timing of the coup. While US officials were careful in 
avoiding any part in the coup, there were persistent reports in US military 
circles that it was afoot. On 27 August, Admiral Felt gave orders to put 
all PACAF air transport planes in readiness for emergency employment, and 
in early September the US Joint Chiefs of Staff designated operational 
areas for a naval task force off Vietnam where it would be ready for a 
possible emergency evacuation of American civilians. Confirming earlier 
oral instructions, the Joint Chiefs late on 29 October directed CINCPAC to 
sail the task force to the designated areas, quietly and inconspiculously. 
On this same day, Operation Candy Machine was activated, sending three USAF 
F-102 jet interceptors to Tan San Nhut. When General Harkins was notified 
that these actions had been directed, he was surprised since he said he did 
not have information from Ambassador Lodge that the Generals, coup was 
imminent.(242) 
On the morning of 1 November, the ARVN coup leaders established them-
selves in the Joint General Staff compound and began moving elements into 
Saigon. General Don called a meeting of top military officers for 1300 
hours at the alS. The Commander of the Vietnamese Navy was summoned and 
given opportunity to join the coup. When he refused, he was murdered by 
his escort. The VNAF Commander, Colonel Hien, was flying on the morning of 
1 November and had no inkling of the events in progress. Upon landing at 
Tan Son Nhut, he was told of the 1300 meeting at the JGS, but he instructed 
a member of his staff to explain that he would be late and to ask if his 
deputy commander, Lt Colonel Do Khan Mai, could attend in his place. This 
being agreeable, Hien went to lunch before returning to his office at 
1315. Here he received a call from one of his squadron commanders saying 
that Mai had directed some T-28s to take off and asking if it was all right. 
He approved the takeoff but soon received another call from the AOC stating 
that the 5th Division commander, Colonel Nguyen Van Thieu, would not allow 
the aircraft to take off. Hien immediately called General Minh who said 
he would look into the matter. Shortly afterward, Mhi returned with armed 
guards, who took Hien to the Jots where he was locked up. Meanwhile, at the 
1300 hour meeting at the Joint General Staff, General Don announced that

the coup was in progress and invited all to join. 
Troops with 
red neckerchiefs poured into Saigon rram the north, and by 1430 hours all 
of the Vietnamese Special Forces in the city had been captured and Nhu's 
Special Forces commander had been taken outside the JS and shot. (214.3) 
The military rebellion was conducted with precision, and the coup 
forces quickly captured important installations in Saigon, simultaneously 
surrounding Diem and Nhu inside the Presidential Palace. Under General 
Minh's orders, Mai employed four VNAF A-1Hs and two T-28s, whose carefully 
selected pilots made gun and rocket strikes against the Presidential Guard 
Brigade compound in Saigon during the mid-afternoon. Minh did not permit 
bomb attacks against targets in Saigon, but the threat of air strikes with 
500-pound bombs undoubtedly contributed to the rapid collapse of pro-
government forces. Minh also intended to use bombs against the Palace 
after the first day, had ARVN coup forces not overcame the resistance. 
Control of VNAF also helped neutralize General HUynh Van Cao. Efforts 
of the General Cao to bring IV CTZ forces to Saigon to assist Diem were 
stymied when a new 7th Division commander brought all ferries to the north 
bank of the Mekong River and threatened that Cao would be bombed by VNAF. 
planes if he attempted a river crossing. Diem's last hope of relief thus 
failed, and during the evening of 1 November Diem and Nhu eicaped the 
palace through an underground passage and sought refuge in Cholon. On the 
following day they attempted to surrender and were murdered while they were 
being taken to the MS compound. (21414) 
As fighting ended in Saigon on 2 November, a Military Revolutionary 
Council of 24 generals and colonels, under the chairmanship of Maj General 
along Van Minh and the vice-chairmanship of Maj. General Tran Van Don emerged 
as the new South Vietnamese government. The MRC dissolved the National 
Assembly, suspended the 26 November 1956 constitution, and decreed a 
provisional constitution on 4 November, in which seven short articles 
revealed that power would remain in the ERZ. A provisional government was 
announced on 5 November, the function as Chief of State to be discharged 
by General Minh and the premiership by the former vice-president, Nguyen 
Ngoc Tho. The cabinet included four general officers and twelve civilians, 
with the generals holding the key ministries of National Defense (Tran 
Van Don, who also retained his post as aas Chief), Security (Ton That Dinh, 
who also continued to command III CTZ), and Information (Mai Hnu Xnan). 
Most of the members of the new government were Buddhists. Although many 
of the civilians were subcabinet administrators in the Diem regime, none 
was a seasoned political figure and most were natives of Cochinchina. Even 
Premier Tho, as Diem's vice-president, had been permitted a voice only in 
matters of economic policy. (2145) 
The United States extended recognition to the Republic of Vietnam's 
provisional government on 8 November and on the following day announced 
the resumption of conmodity import assistance. (2146)

Ambassador Lodge judged that the generals were united and determined 
to step up the war effort and recommended that the United States ought not 
to press too hard for political reforms and early elections. In their 
initial weeks in office, however, the generals made little progress. Don 
and the others asserted that the strategic hamlets (which they now preferred 
to call "fortified hamlets") had been pushed too hard with what amounted to 
forced labor. They agreed that the program should be continued but only 
after existing hamlets were consolidated and improved. They wanted to make 
major efforts to win over the Hoa Hap and Cao Dai, and to reduce the 
influence of Chinese racketeers and extortionists. (21i.7) Addressing military 
policy on 2 December, General Don spoke bravely of uniting all Army, Navy, 
Air Force, civil agencies, and paramilitary forces for a coordinated all-
out effort to free Vietnam from the Communist threat. Under his direction 
as Minister of Defense and Chief of the Joint General Staff, Don announced 
his intention to reorganize and employ the Joint General Staff as a small 
policy-making agency and to use the JGS Joint Operations Center, in 
coordination with the corps commanders, to run the war. Don also stated 
that the total Army, Air Force, Navy, and paramilitary combat power within 
the corps areas would be divided between the corps co1imanders.(248) 
Under the new Minh regime, major undertakings were announced, only to 
remain stalled awaiting more definite instructions from the central govern-
ment while at the same time wholesale purges and transfers added uncertainty 
and inactivity in military and provincial organizations. Thus in the III 
CTZ, the 5th Division ALO reported that the division was not only diverted 
from combat by transfer of units to "coup duty" but was also receiving many 
new commanders who required orientation toward the war effort. (2L.9) In a 
meeting with Minh on 20 December, Secretary McNamara pointedly informed 
him that it Would be impossible for Dinh to command the III CTZ and be 
Minister of Security and that he-must gi7e up me of the jcbs; shortly 
afterward Brig General Tran ThienKhiem, who had been deputy chief of the 
alS, was given command of III C1 and Dinh remained in Saigon. (250) 
Another high-level change was apparently intended to place General Knanh, 
who had put down the revolt against Diem in 1960, farther from Saigon. On 
12 December, General Tri replaced-Khanh as cammander of II CTZ, and Khanh 
took command of I CTZ at Da Nang vice Tri. In addition, Colonel Nguyen 
Chanh Thi, who had led the 1960 coup and had returned from exile in Cambodia, 
was assigned as Khanhts chief of Staff, reportedly to keep watch on Khanh.(251) 
Immediately after the coup, Mai was promoted to colonel and assigned as 
VNAF commander. Other VNAF officers who had supported the coup also 
received promotions, this number including Nguyen Cao Ky, =mender of the 
43d Transport Group, who was promoted to colonel with no immediate shift in 
Assignment. Colonel Hien, remained in arrest and under close questioning 
for several weeks; in late November he was released from the service and 
would ultimately find employment as an Air Vietnam pilot. Early in December, 
Mhi also learned that he was in trouble with the Army generals in the junta, 
men wham he privately characterized as pro-French "opportunists" and 
lacking a true nationalist revolutionary spirit. Other reports, however,

attributed Mai's downfall to his lack of operational experience and 
former association with Nhurs Can Lao party. On 16 December, Colonel Ky 
became VNAF commander, and Mai was released to serve in the newly created . 
position as Vietnamese military attache in West Germany.(252) 
As the explosive situation was evolving in Saigon on 1 November, the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff messaged Admiral Felt that it was possible that the 
Vietcong or North Vietnamese might attempt to exploit the opportunity 
presented to them. In the case of threatening moves by North Vietnam or 
border crossings in significant numbers, CINCPAC was to be prepared to 
implement his Operations Plan 99-64, which (though drawn up to halt 
aggression against Laos) could be employed to conduct punitive and crippling 
operations against North Vietnam, in an ascending order of intensity and 
to a degree necessary to halt military aggression against South Vietnam. (2S3) 
In the very early morning hours of 2 November, Saigon time, Secretary 
McNamara also announced the movement of US military forces toward South 
Vietnam as a precautionary measure should it become necessary to protect 
;unerican lives. (2) In December the North Vietnamese would begin their 
move to exploit the chaos in South Vietnam but the immediate response 
fell to Vietcong units already in place, who received orders immediately 
after Diem's death to intensify operations on all fronts, to expect a 
disintegration of government authority in the countryside, and to take 
maximum advantage of it. (25) 
On the afternoon of 1 November, the VNAF grounded all USAF aircraft 
in South Vietnam, but before nightfall the grounding order was lifted with 
the request that USAF airmen would maintain and support the battle against 
the Vietcong to their maximum capability while VNAF pilots were on alert 
to support the coup operation.(256) The Vietcong reaction to the disorder 
in Saigon was immediate and vigorous. By midnight on 1 November, eight 
outposts were hit by the Vietcong, but all of these attacks broke off as 
flareships appeared. In the week following the coup, the Vietcong made 
a peak total of 71 hamlet and outpost attacks; and during November, 284 
flare and 298 strike sorties were flown in an effort to defend the embattled 
outposts and hamlets. This effort declined to 176 flare and 76 strike 
sorties in December. (2S7) The defense of the hamlets and outposts was 
vigorous but demoralized Civil Guard, Self Defense Corps, and hamlet 
militia proved no match for the Vietcong, who demonstrated a tremendous 
reserve capability by tripling their rate of operations in the first 
week of November. Government losses were estimated at 2,800 men and 
Vietcong losses only 2,900 in November. The Government forces lost 
nearly three weapons for every one captured from the Vietcong. Altogether 
in November the Vietcong captured enough weapons to arm five 300-man 
battalions.(258) In the defensive emergency the 2d Air Division and VNAF 
blew every escort request that was made, a total of 161 such sorties being 
flown in November and 260 in DeceMber; but in the second week of November 
the Vietcong nevertheless caught and successfully ambushed a train just 
inland from the coastal city of Phan Thiet in Binh Thuan province. (2S9)

The most intense Vietcong activity in November centered in the provinces 
south and southwest of Saigon, but the Communist guerrillas were also 
active in the central coastal reaches of Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh 
provinces. (260) 
In one of his last policy comments on Vietnam made on 14 November, 
President Kennedy revealed that Secretary Rusk and Secretary McNamara 
were going to Honolulu for a meeting on 20 November which would assess the 
situation, determine how to intensify the struggle, and how to bring 
Americans out of Vietnam. Mow," Kennedy continued, "that is our objective, 
to bring Americans home, permit the South Vietnamese to maintain themselves 
as a free and independent country, and permit democratic forces within the 
country to operate -- which they can, of course, much more freely when 
the assault from the inside, and which is manipulated from the north, is 
ended. "(261) After hearing the political military country team briefings 
on 20 November by Lodge and Harkins, Secretary McNamara summarized the 
situation: "South 'Vietnam is under tremendous pressure from the VC. . . . 
The Generals head a very fragile government. The United States should not 
try to cut the corners too fine. We must be prepared to devote enough 
resources to this job of winning the war to be certain of accomplishing 
it instead of just hoping to accomplish it. "(262) Admiral Felt and General 
Harkins were assigned the task of developing a new campaign plan with 
priority emphasis on the areas south and southwest of Saigon. The Honolulu 
conferees also resolved to adhere to the plan established before the change 
in the government, calling for accelerated development of Vietnamese combat 
and combat support capabilities and reduction of the number of US personnel 
in Vietnam.(263) Accordingly, the much publicized withdrawal of 1,000 
American military men from South Vietnam proceeded as scheduled: The first 
contingent of 300 departed on 3 December and the remaining 700 on 13 
December. (26L) 
In November and December, General Harkins continued to express 
optimism that the main force of the Vietcong effort -- which had fallen 
heaviest on Civil Guard, Self -Defense Corps, and hamlet militia units --
and had not hurt ARVN too badly had peaked and that regular RVNAF forces 
would recapture the initiative. (26) This optimism proved generally 
unfounded. In the case of VNAF, Colonel Mai agreed in mid-November to 
increase the daily allocations of aircraft to the AOC, and in November 
and December the VNAF A-1H and T-28 squadrons increased their strike 
sorties, though not enough to compensate for declining serviceability of 
USAF B-26s and T-28s, whose ranks were additionally reduced by battle 
damages:

The statistical summary of strike sorties, moreover, did not reveal 
continuing elements of VNAF weakness. Word-picture reports indicated 
that the VNAF FAC activity continued deficient: Thus in the 5th Division 
on 6 December, an L-19 FAC and two T-28s deployed to Tay Ninh airport in 
response to an immediate air request calling for a strike against a Viet-
cong battalion whose position was fixed. Pleading necessity for refueling 
his half-full tanks (even though the mission objective was only ten 
minutes from Tay Ninh) and having lunch in the meanwhile, the VNAF FAC 
delayed the mission and the target dissipated. At Nha Trang, the USAF 
ALOIs report for November stated that VNAF T-28 escort for emergency 
Special Farces resupply missions had deteriorated. As one example, on 
18 November, a Special Forces "A" team was under attack and requested an 
emergency resupply of ammunition and the ALO requested escort for the 
supply aircraft. After a considerable delay, he was informed that the 
VNAF refused the mission because the T-28 pilots could not expect to get 
back to Nha Trang until 15 minutes after sunset.(266) These were new 
evidences of a lack of firm control over the VNAF from its top command, 
but, on the other hand, as will be noted, other VNAF crews valiantly in 
battle emergencies of this period. 
In the ground war, offensive ARVN operations of platoon size and 
larger dropped immediately after the coup but went back up to 500-600 a 
day by 20 November.(267) New ARVN offensive efforts, however, were 
blunted by mismanagement and by defeats inflicted by the Vietcong. In 
the 7th Division south of Saigon, a new commander -- Colonel Phan Van 
Dong -- markedly increased operations of the long lethargic unit, but this 
commander was relieved toward the end of November. Almost immediately, 
during Operation Duc Thang 63/TG in Long An province between 25-27 
November, two battalions were assigned clearing operations in the same

battalions engaged each other, sustairing between them 2 KOA and 20 WIA. 
"Ibis action," according to the Senior US Argy advisor, "proved to have 
a very demoralizing effect on both units, 11(268) 
During Operation Dan Chi 4-5/42 in An Mayen province between 24-27 
November, the habitually aggressive ARVN 21st Division again fell victim 
to a Vietcong ambush, carefully planned and executed by a Vietcong 
battalion. Before dawn on 24 November the Vietcong attacked the Cha La 
outpost and strategic hamlet near the tip of the Ca Mau peninsula. The 
21st Division promptly initiated a plan to move four heliborne troop 
lists into two landing zones, with prestrike, escort, and air cover by 
fixed-wing aircraft. Under cover of darkness on the night of 23/24 
November, the Vietcong dug gun pits and emplaced some five 7.9-mm machine 
guns andat least one twin 50-caliber machine gun at the principal landing 
zone. After a prefunctory prestrike, the heliborne assault force landed 
at 1038 hours, and Communist fire immediately shot down an H-21 and 
damaged 10 H-21s and UH-lBs. The ground troops made very little movement 
toward the entrenched Vietcong, but USAF and VNAF B-26s, A-1Hs, and T-28s 
conducted spirited and sustained attacks, in which valor at times out-
weighed discretion since some of the fighters were observed pulling up 
directly over the area of heavy ground fire. As has been seen, C-47s 
and C-123s attempted to drop an airborne battalion to cut off the Vietcong 
escape, but this effort failed when the C-123s put most of their troops 
into and on the far side of the Cad. Nuoc River. The Vietcong escaped during 
the night of 24 November, but when ARVN troops moved into the vacated 
enemy positions on 25 November they found three bodies and other indications 
that as many as 150 Vietcong had been carried away in sampans. Brig 
General Robert H. York observed the entire operation and personally 
cammended the effectiveness and Atilization of tactical air, but the 
operation was costly to participating aircrews, with Most of the damage 
being done by 50-caliber fire. kircraft losses included a CH-21; a B-26 
shot down with the loss of its crew; and two VNAF A-IHs and a T-28 which 
crashed on landing because of battle damages. A total of 25 aircraft 
were hit by ground fire. The 2d Air Division pointed out that in support 
of a heliborne force consisting of 12 H-21s, 8 troop carrying HU-lBs, 
and 5 UTT gunships, VNAF and USAF had provided 4 T-28s on prestrike, 2 B-26s 
for escort, and 3 B-26s, 8 A-1Hs, and 12 T-28s for air cover, thus making 
Dan Chi 4 the largest one-day close air support operation yet rendered. 
In IV CTZ, however, Colonels Collings and Pierce pointed out that the 
magnitude of the air support was nevertheless grossly inadequate to the 
task encountered. Collings repeated his demands for flights of four 
aircraft. Pierce estimated that at least 40 sorties (with 500-pound 
bombs, rather than 100-pound ordnance) should have been used against the 
Communist entrenchments. A special Don-Harkins evaluation concluded: 
"Operation Dan Chi failed to develop any momentum or make major ground 
contact with the VC. The heavy ground fire, which delayed and disrupted

the heliborne movement of troops, allowed the VC to successfully with-
draw before they could be engaged. "(269) 
Where ARVN offensives went poorly in the Delta, the Vietcong were 
also active in the III CTZ and PBT Special Zone north of Saigon. In an 
otherwise cheerless month, the PBT Zone ALO, Captain Richard W. Von Hake, 
negotiated one small air victory against Vietcong guerrillas along the 
Dong Nai River, men who habitually fired at aircraft but were not found 
by a battalion sweep through the area in November. On 8 December, Von 
Hake persuaded the province commander (who insisted he was wasting his 
time because the battalion had just been through the area) to make an 
L-19 flight with him. Over 50 people were observed and the L-19 drew 
brisk ground fire (much to the disbelief of the province chief who kept 
muttering about the ground sweep had proved there were no enemy in the 
area). Von Hake prepared a plan for air strikes which the province chief 
cleared with the PBT Zone Command. On 9 and 12 December, leaflets were 
dropped into the area warning that persons who associated with the Viet-
cong were in danger. The area was bordered on the east and west by 
strategic hamlets, and hamlet chiefs blocked off passage into it from 
dawn to noon on 14 December. This same morning, Von Hake and a VNAF 
observer flew into the Vietcong area, discretely trailed by three T-28s 
and two B-26s. When the 1-19 was fired upon, the VNAF observer marked 
the target and the strike planes promptly attacked. The results were 23 
confirmed Vietcong KIA and probably others wounded. (270) This small 
victory indicated that armed reconnaissance was applicable to the situation 
in Vietnam, but it, of course, did little to diminish the Vietcong strength 
in Zone D. Twice early in December, the Zone D guerrillas ambushed small 
ARVN convoys that did not have air escorts. And on 23 December in Binh 
Long province, ARVN decided to move a convoy even though no air cover was 
available. The convoy encountered a Vietcong ambush and suffered 14 
KIA, seven WIA, five MIA, seven trucks and two armored cars damaged, three 
30-caliber machine guns and 16 smaller weapons lost. (271) 
In November and December, VNAF and USAF aircraft flew fewer helicopter 
escort sorties than earlier in the year -- 73 in November and 83 in 
December. Credits for Vietcong killed by air strikes totalled 835 in 
November (4 in I CTZ, 30 in II CTZ, 356 in III CTZ, and 445 in IV CTZ), 
but dropped to 333 in December (6 in I CTZ, 0 in II CTZ, 285 in III CTZ, 
and 42 in IV CTZ).(272) In some measure, these statistics reflected 
reduced ARVN offensive operations, but it was also incontrovertible that 
(despite MACV directives which required the use of VNAF aircraft to the 
fullest before the employment of US planes) that US Army helicopter gun-
ships were being used increasingly in place of fixed-wing air support. 
Thus on 2 November, the MACV Combat Operations Center received a request 
from the III CTZ G-3 Advisor for UH-1B air support of friendly troops 
engaging a Vietcong concentration near Saigon. Maj General Richard 
Stilwell ruled out VNAF or USAF fixed-wing support, implying that only 
helicopter gunships could provide support without endangeringfriendlies.

Two flights of UH-lBs provided the fire support. The request was never 
received at the III CTZ TOC or the III Asoc.(273) 
In III CTZ the ARVN 5th Division was already noted for its preference 
of helicopter gunships over .fixed-wing air support, and this contributed 
to a major ARVN defeat during Operation Dai Phong 35, which commenced on 
the afternoon of 31 December. At this time the 32d Ranger Battalion ran 
into an estimated two-battalion VietCong force at a point approximately 
10 miles west of Ben Cat and eight miles southeast of Dan Tieng. The 
rangers formed a defense perimeter and fought hard and well, but they 
were outnumbered and needed assistance. Since the 5th Division had 
battalions at Ben Cat and Dan Tieng it appeared there was a good opportunity 
to close on the Vietcong force and destroy it. Ground relief forces, 
however, would not arrive until noon on 1 January, long after the rangers 
disintegrated. Even more remarkably) VNAF had an L-19 FAL and at least 
two A-1Hs (each armed with 12 x 100-pound bombs and 800 rounds of 20-mm 
ammunition) continuously on station over the encircled rangers all 
afternoon long on 31 December, and additional strike aircraft were readily-
available at Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhut. Repeatedly during the afternoon, 
the 5th Division ALO, Captain Kent C. Spears, requested the ARVN G-3, the 
ARVN chief of staff, and the US Army Advisor to use the A-IHs against 
clearly distinguished enemy positions. Instead, the ARVN G-3 called for 
and used three flights of armed HU-llis without positive results, and the 
orbiting relays of A-IHs returned to Bien Hoa without expending their 
ordnance.. Ranger casualties totalled 6 KIA, 12 WU, and 31 MIA, and 
an engagement that might have been a victory became another disheartening 
defeat. In acting command of 2d Air Division, Colonel Henderson considered 
that the failure to use available air firepower "appears to border on 
being criminal" and informed General Stilwell of his concern. Ambassador 
Lodge messaged the same conclusion tco Washington: "This . . just one 
more example, albeit one of most striking, of Vietnamese failures to take 
advantage Of superiority in firepower: which can be obtained by rapid 
reaction to VC troop concentrations." Citing Dai Phong 35, Admiral Felt 
bluntly suggested to Harkins that he should remember that the firepower 
of the A-1H was overwhelmingly superior to that of the 1W-1B. "It 
appears to me," Felt noted, "that education program on use of airpower is 
unsatisfantory."(274) 
"There are encouraging signs," stated Assistant Secretary of State 
Roger Hileman on 13 December, "that the new government will prosecute the 
war with greater energy and understanding of what must be done to achieve 
success than was true under Diem. Support of the people ,both urban and 
rural, is essential and the military have moved to reverse the police-
state methods current under Dien and have indicated also their intent to 
improve the all-important strategic hAmilet program."(275) Other assess-
ments of the political and military situation in South Vietnam in this 
same season were decidedly more pessimistic. Nominally headed by civilian 
Prime Minister Tho, the new government was dominated by its military

members, most of whom attempted to retain responsibility for the 
direction of military operations while at the same time assuming additional 
responsibility for the administration of the political and econamic 
institutions of the country. During his visit to Vietnam on 19-20 
December, Secretary McNamara observed that military security had deterio-
rated since the coup both because of inept leadership and the massive 
Vietcong effort.(276) While six weeks had passed since Diem's overthrow, 
the Minh government had made no plans to get on with military operations, 
particularly in the Delta, where McNamara wanted an intensified campaign. (277) 
On the political scene during December, the return of Vietnamese 
exiles from France reintroduced a Gaullist presence in Saigon at the 
same time the Minh government was shaken by rumors that the United States 
might favor a negotiated neutralist solution for Vietnam. As urged by 
Ambassador Lodge, the United States would vigorously scotch the rumors 
about US policy, but in late December and early January, while student 
demonstrations against neutralism and Gaullism were mounting, Minh's 
advisory Council of Notables accused the Military Revolutionary Council of 
lacking a firm policy on neutralism and recommended that relations with 
France be broken off.(278) On the international level, Cambodia's break 
in relations with South Vietnam and the United States and Sihanouk's 
embracement of speedily provided Chinese Communist military assistance
. 
presented a grave new threat to South Vietnam. (279) Where Communist 
support for the Vietcong in the Delta through Cambodia had already proven 
"very worrisome," the situation was rapidly worsening. On 24 December, 
an ARVN probe in the Delta captured five tons of ammunition, 90 percent 
of which was of Chinese Communist manufacture.(280) By the end of December 
1963 itWas evident that the military and political situation in South 
Vietnam had markedly deteriorated since the assassination of President Diem. 
Ti would worsen in 1964 as the North Vietnamese redoubled their activities 
both in Vietnam and in Laos.

Chapter 9 
MONTHS OF CRISIS IN VIETNAM AND LAOS, 
NOVEMBER 1964-FEBRUARY 1965 
1. Communist Escalations Affected US Policy  
In assessments following the overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem, 
the leaders of the National Liberation Front sensed victory for Communism. 
With Diem's fall they considered that the Free World cause was seriously 
weakened from all points of view, military, political, and administrative. (1) 
In November and December 1963, shortly after the overthrow of Diem and when 
it was evident that the governmental change had not produced significant 
defections to the Communist cause, Hanoi probably made its decision to commit 
men and then units of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) to hasten victory in 
Indochina. In Laos on 2 November 1963, the Pathet Lao captured a long-
established Meo position in an unprovoked attack, and, at the 9th Plenum 
of the Third Central Committee of the Lao Dong Party in Hanoi in December, 
the militant First Secretary Le Duan hailed Mao Tse-tung as the apottle 
of revolutionary strategy to be pursued. At this time, the Lao Dong party 
assessed the balance of forces and issued a secret directive setting forth 
the guidelines to win the "special war" that was beginning. (2) Training 
schedules at Hanoi's infiltration centers were suspended and the soldiers 
were headed south as quickly as preparations could be made, some 4,700 
Communist cadremenentering South Vietnam in January through May 1964. 
During 1963 the great majority of the infiltrators had continued to be 
ethnic southerners, but from the beginning of 1964 there were more and 
more ethnic northerners, many of them draftees into the NVA for duty in 
South Vietnam. The Vietcong had formerly relied upon old French and 
American weapons, chiefly from stockpiles captured prior to 1954 in 
Indochina and Korea, but in 1964 the flow of weapons from North Vietnam 
overland and by sea consisted almost entirely of the latest arms acquired 
fram Communist China. (3) 
The full dimensions of the Communist threat in the aftermath of 
President Diem's assassination were not immediately apparent to American 
policymakers. As a result of Saigon country-team briefings at the special 
State-Defense Conference held at President Kennedy's direction in Hawaii 
on 20 November 1963, Secretary MCNanara judged that "a certain euphoria" 
had set in since the coup. "The Generals," he said, "head a very fragile 
government."(4) Taking office following the assassination of President 
Kennedy on 22 November, President Lyndon B. Johnson on 26 November published 
NSAM 273 which confirmed US objectives in South Vietnam as being to assist 
the Republic of Vietnam in winning the war against the Communist conspiracy; 
to assist the RVN in consolidating, holding, and developing increased public 
support; to insure that US military and economic assistance did not fall 
below the levels sustained during the Diem government; and to persuade the 
RVN to concentrate its efforts in the critical Mekong Delta area. (5) On 2 
December President Johnson wrote General Taylor a memorandum stating that 
South Vietnam was the "most critical military area" confronting the United 
States and cautioning that the Joint Chiefs would see to it that the very

best available officers were assigned to General Harkins, including "blue 
ribbon men" at every level. (6) 
Where General Minh's government was viewed as "fragile" at the outset, 
Secretary McNamara found the new regime in Saigon to be "indecisive and 
drifting" when he visited Vietnam at President Johnson's direction on 
19-20 December. The generals were heavily concerned with political matters 
and had little time to consider a revitalization of pacification or the 
declining military situation, which in the view of all US principals had 
been much worse certainly at the end of October than had been thought at 
the time. Unless current trends were reversed in the next two or three 
months, McNamara judged that they would lead "to neutralization at best 
and more likely to a Cammunist-controlled state." As a matter of policy, 
Secretary McNamara recommended that the war ought to be waged by the South 
Vietnamese and that increased US resources and personnel would hinder rather 
than help the counterinsurgency campaign. In McNamara's assessment, the 
chief military danger continued to be Vietcong insurgency in the critical 
provinces surrounding Saigon -- Long An, Dinh Thong, Kien Hoa, and Binh 
Doung -- and he urged Minh to assign more troops to pacify these provinces. 
In order to get more information about infiltration into South Vietnam, 
McNamara directed that U-2 high altitude photo planes be brought to South 
Vietnam on an urgent basis.

operations in Laos to impede the flow of Communist personnel and material arming. 
50X1 
At the urging of Secretary Namara, General Minh's Military Revolutionary 
Committee government took steps in the latter part of December to sort out their 
political and military responsibilities, So that a greater concentration on 
military undertakings would be hopefully possible, but Saigon's management of 
the war remained inept in January 1964. On 18 January, 115 helicopters -- the 
largest airlift thus far in the war -7 carried 1,100 Vietnamese troops into 
Zone DI but despite its magnitude Alla operation f4i1ed to engage am?r enemy 
forces. (ii) The new regime sought a rapprochement with the Cao Dai and Hoa Hao 
sectsl.long alienated by President Diem and Who controlled key areas along the 
Cambodian border. At local levels, however, ARPN commanders and provincial 
officials not only disagreed as to their respective authority but many worked 
out "live and let live" agreements with the Vietcong. (12) At Da Nang, where 
he had been sant to command the I CTZ, Maj General Nguyen Khanh conceived that 
some of the mwebers of the 12-man MMC were "playboys" who were not giving 
full support to the war effort and that others were plotting to arrest 
General Minh and other officers including Khanh himself and declare for South 
Vietnamese neutralism. Before dawn on 30 January, and without American pre-
knowledge, General,ghanh headed .1740-Ion of younger R7NAF generals whose 
forces Managed a relatively blodnisa comp in Saigon. In a conversation 
with General Harkins on the afternoon of 31 January, the 37-year old Khanh 
explained that the coup VAS pro-American, pro-Western, and anti-neutralist and 
assured that he =mad get about the jOh of stepping up the war againet the 
enemy. President Johnson inmediatelr sent Khanh a personal note of support. (13) 
In General Harkins' opinion, Khanh was the "otrongest military character 
in the caran'and best ableto give strong direction to a Saigon govern-
ment. Nevertheless, Khanh lacked political appeal and his control of the 
South Vietnamese army was itself nntertain.(14) The Communists moved very 
quickly to exploit the political &Ammar, and the new regime displayed little 
prowess in handling the crises. Before dawn an 6 February, a Vietcong regimental 
headquarters and reinforced battaliOn defeated and drove the militia out of Ben 
Cau hamlet in Tv Minh province. The Vietcong forced the people to dig firing 
and shelter positions and settled in to await the AMVN relief effort. Although 
precise air Strikes could have dislodged the Vietcong defenses with minimum 
damage to the friendly people tripped inside the hamlet, the III CTZ commander 
authorised fire attacks against the hamlet and permitted indiscriminate 
artillery, air, and helicopter gunship fire throughout the day on 6 February. 
The firepower did not especially hurt the Vietcong, who easily escaped after 
nightfall, but the hamlet wen destroyed and civilian casualties ran to 
27 killed, 29 wounded, and 670 burned in varying degrees. Despite quick 
arrival of WOK civil relief euppligie, surviving civilians were described 
as more grateful to the Vietcong She had made them dig shelters than to 
the RVNAF relief effort. In a penetrating evaluation of the Ben Can 
tragedy, the USAF counterineurgencyexpert, Mkj General Edward G. Lansdale,

pointed out that the RVNAF had violated a cardinal rule in failing to 
protect and help people who were under Vietcong attack and predicted that 
such actions would help defeat the cause of freedam in Vietnam. (15) Hard 
after the Ben Cau tragedy, the Khanh regime came under increased difficul-
ties with Cambodia, set off by Sihanouk's charge on 11 February that two 
VNAF aircraft had attacked a Cambodian village and killed five people. 
Sihanouk asserted that the United States was partly responsible because 
it had "overarmed" South Vietnam and also because Washington had "torpedoed" 
his plans for an international conference to establish Cambodia's neutrality. 
After other border incidents Sihanouk accepted arms from China and the 
Soviets, and on 19 March, when ARVN forces were operating near the border, 
Cambodian T-28s shot down a USAF 0-1, resulting in the death of the VNAF 
observer and the USAF pilot, Capt H. T. Scobel.(16) 
After 8 February, when Marh formerly announced himself as premier 
and Duong Van Minh as chief of state, AMbassador Lodge and General 
Harkins stressed to Khanh the importance of intensifying the tempo and 
more particularly the effectiveness of operations against the Vietcong. 
Khanh was not interested in renewing the offensive until after the Tet 
holidays, but on 22 February the Government of Vietnam published the 
Chien Thang National Pacification plan, which MACV had been attempting 
to put into effect since Diem's overthrow. The plan conceived that 
local "spreading oil stain" or "spreading oil spot" military clear-and-
hold operations would begin in relatively safe areas and progressively 
roll back the Vietcong. Within areas that were pacified a "new life 
development program" would improve the standard of living of the civilian 
population. According to the plan, Phase I roll-back pacification opera-
tions were to be completed in the I and II CTZs by 1 January 1965 and in 
the III and IV CTZs by 1 January 1966, and in each case Phase II operations 
to annihilate the Vietcong in their secret base areas were expected to 
follow the Phase I pacification efforts. (17) Acting within the Chien Thang 
oil spot pacification concept, CTZ commanders were expected to provide 
separate plans for accamplishment of the overall objective. Thus in the 
III CTZ, a "Hop Tao" program instituted in June was expected to push 
outward fram Saigon in concentric circles until the adjacent six provinces 
(Gia Dinh, Bien Hoa, Binh Luang, Hau Nghia, Long An, and Phuoc Tuy) were 
firmly under government influence.(18) 
The Chien Mang plan appeared soundly conceived, and General 
Harkins believed that it would succeed "provided there are no more 
coups and Khanh stays alive."(19) On the other hand, the success of 
the local pacification operations depended upon direction guidance from 
Saigon and energetic, qualified ARVN and provincial commanders. Neither 
could be provided by the Khanh government, which was hard pressed to 
remain in power. In a press conference on 1 March, Khanh charged that 
French agents were plotting to assassinate him, overthrow his govern-
ment, and impose a neutralist settlement. The French embassy denied 
the charge, but on 6 March Khanh replaced three of the incumbent CTZ 
commanders and five of the nine ARVN division commanders. A wholesale 
replacement of 23 province chiefs soon followed. Under Minh and Khanh, 
nine provinces had three chiefs in three months, one had four, and 
scores of lesser officials were replaced. The disruption of leadership

shook the confidence of ARVN troops and the South Vietnamese populace. 
Army and paramilitary desertion rates increased, and 48 Saigonts effective-
ness decreased the prestige and power of the well-disciplined Vietcong 
increased. (20) The ultimate effect of the weakness in the Saigon govern-
ment and the decentralization of military command would ultimately be the 
emergence Of the CTZ commanders as virtual warlords, but immediately in 
March and April the bizarre command situation vastly complicated local 
pacification plans and operations. Thus in Long An province the ARVN 
commander charged to clear-and-hold was not .on speaking terms with the 
province chief and the province chief not on_apeakinjg terms with at least 
one of his dialf1aTaiiiida7--thusifiang-prigreas uncertain. fn other areas 
regimental ccomanders requested air strikes against targets that province 
chiefs did not want destroyed, producing a possibility that VNAF/USAF 
could be used as a scapegoat for same untoward incident resulting from 
disagreements between newly assigned local authorities.(21) 
In the light of current US intelligence of Hanoi's aggressive prepa-
rations for expanding support to tha Vietcong, General Leay suggested: 
"We are swatting flies when we ought to be going after the manure pile." 
In a memo to the Joint Chiefs on 21 February, Le:May recommended positive 
and bolder actions to include bombing of specific targets in North - 
Vietnam.(22) In a memorandum to Secretary Rusk, Walt Ii.,Rostow also 
pointed out Ho Chi Minh was vulnerable to bombing since he had an indus-

William H. Sullivan, to examine contingencies for increasing pressure

In meetings in Saigon on 8-10 March, Secretary McNamara and General Taylor 
expressed hope that the Khanh government could rally to its responsibilities, 
but they gained the overall impression that principally from a lack of govern-
mental direction the military situation in South Vietnam was unquestionably 
growing worse. About 40 percent of South Vietnam's territory was under pre-
dominant influence or control of the Vietcong, this territory including the 
critical provinces surrounding Saigon. Although Khanh was confident that ARVN 
forces could clear the Vietcong from the countryside, he was not confident that 
areas that were cleared could be held. In this connection, Khanh favored 
continuation of covert activities against North Vietnam, but he stated that his 
primary concern was to establish a firm base in South Vietnam and that he did 
not wish to engage in avert activities against North Vietnam until "rear-area 
security" had been established. No one was very optimistic that the limited 
34A operations were very successful, although it was possible that the 
clandestine operations could be expanded by releasing restraints on GVN and 
VNAF forces or by bringing in Vietnamese-marked B-57 aircraft to be operated 
by VNAF and covert USAF crews. The subject of aerial mining of North Vietnam 
waters was discussed at length, and McNamara directed that training of Viet-
namese pilots for mine laying should be commenced at once, using selected 
pilots and A-1H aircraft. Ambassador Lodge considered that aerial reconnaissance 
of North Vietnamese LOCs into South Vietnam would he a good idea, but he was 
opposed to "massive destruction" actions before attempting a "carrot and stick" 
approach, whereby Hanoi could be offered advantages for callingrthe aggression 
while at the sane time confronted with covert actions such as unacknowledged 
air strikes. In discussion of hot pursuit across South Vietnam's borders, two 
conclusions emerged. Since the United States was attempting negotiations to 
keep Sihanouk from abandoning whatever neutrality he might have and from reach-
ing an accommodation with Hanoi and Peking, hot pursuit across the Cambodian 
border might not be worth much militari1y and would have political repercussions. 
In regard to Laos, however, General Tgylor proposed that South Vietnamese units, 
aided by aerial reconnaissance and aerial resupply, should conduct hot-pursuit 
border control operations, and McNamara directed that operations into Laos 
larger than battalion size should be authorized only with the approval of 
Souvanna Fhouma.(26) 
After further discussions with CINCPAC an 12 March, Secretary McNamara 
returned to Washington where he recommended 12 steps to Change the adverse 
trend of the war in South Vietnam to President Johnson an 16 March. The 
recommendations generally proposed to take actions within South Vietnam, 
but one of them required preparations to initiate, on 72 hours notice, border 
control actions against Communist activities inside Laos and Cambodia and "tit-
for-tat" retaliatory bomb strikes and commando raids by South Vietnameee forces 
against North Vietnamese targets (such as communications centers, training camps, 
and infiltration routes). Another action called for plans and preparations to be 
in a position on 30 days notice to initiate a program of graduated overt military 
pressure against North Vietnam to include VNAF and USAF air commando air attacks 
against military and possibly industrial targets. The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
reviewed Maanara's report on 14 March, and- accepted General LeMay's conclusion 
that the 12 proposed actions would be insufficient to turn the tide against the 
Vietcong in South Vietnam without positive action being taken against the Hanoi 
government at an early date. Secretary MbNamara's report was not amended in

terms of the JCS review, and President Johnson approved NSAM 288 on 17 March 
with MaNamarats 12 actions, which he enjoined all agencies energetically 
to support.(27) In a major address on 26 March, Secretary McNamara con-
sidered that he covered US objectives in some detail, when he explained 
the four options open to President Johnson. First, the United States could 
withdraw, but this option was totally rejected. Second, Vietnam could be 
neutralized, but under the shadow of Communist power "neutralization" would 
in reality be an interim device to permit Communist consolidation and 
eventual takeover. Third, military actions could be initiated outside South 
Vietnam, particularly against North Vietnam, in order to supplement the 
counterinsurgency program in South Vietnam, and this option was being carefully 
studied. Fourth, the United States could concentrate on helping the South 
Vietnamese win the battle in their own country. The fourth option had 
been approved by President Johnson since it was essential no matter what 
else was done. Even if they proved necessary, actions outside South 
Vietnam,s borders, McNamara believed, would be a supplement to -- not a 
substitute for -- progress to be made within South Vietnam.(28) 
Both in NSAM 288 and in his personal analysis, President Johnson 
viewed the essential task as being to strengthen South Vietnam. Follow-
ing a SEATO Council meeting at Manila on 15 April, Secretary Rusk and 
General Wheeler visited Saigon. Here General Wheeler reviewed the poten-
tial for increased pressure on North Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge, namely, 
the 34A covert operations which Wheeler implied had already- achieved con-
siderable success, the possibility of covert US support for South Vietnamese 
aerial mining and air strike operations, and finally the potential for 
covert joint US-GVN aerial reconnaissance, naval displays and bombardments, 
and air attacks. In his report to Plgesident Johnson, Sacretary Rusk had 
generally encouraging impressions, but he reported that US officials 
appeared to be inhibited from bold new efforts by a feeling that resources 
for the support of Vietnam were closely limited, and he also wondered 
whether enough Americans had been committed to assist on a crash basis 
in the development of civil administrative services in areas in which 
the holding process should be vigorously processed. On 28 April President 
Johnson messaged Ambassador Lodge a proposal for additional civil advisors, 
the additional man to be matched by withdrawal of "two or three hundred" 
military personnel so that there would be no increase in total American 
numbers but "merely- a shift of effort toward the art of peace."(29) 
In reflecting upon the events of 1964, President Johnson would come 
to believe that the Communist leaders might have misjudged American 
intentions and have made the decision to drive straight to their Objective 
of subjugating the independence of South Vietnam. (30) In the Lao panhandle, 
the NVA 559th Transportation Group was joined by at least three "Combined 
Forces" (Binh Than 3,4,5) -- units containing construction workers, signal 
men, and motor truck operators, all being employed in developing Lao infil-
tration routes. In April, the 95th Regiment of the NVA 325th Division was 
recalled from duty in Laos, and, back in North Vietnam, the 95th underwent

special military and political training for operations in South Vietnam. 
Hanoi also began to form new regimental-sized units for dispatch south-
ward. Thus the 32d Regiment was activated with personnel drawn from a 
number of established units and filled with trainees from the San Tay and 
Xuan Mai infiltration centers. (31) As Will be seen in more detail, the 
Communists had been making serious probes against Lao government forces 
since November 1963, and on 27 April the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese 
launched heavy attacks against Lao Neutralist forces on the Plain of Jars. (32) 
In the Mekong delta of South Vietnam the Vietcong boasted that they could 
take any district headquarters when they wished, and on the night of 12 
April a Vietcong regiment with three battalions overran the district capital 
of Kien Long on the southern end of the Ca Mau peninsula. In the air-ground 
battle there, the Communists lost at least 55 men KIA including the regimental 
commander, but 283 ARVN and 9 US advisors were casualties, the district 
capital was destroyed, and some 200 Vietnamese civilians were killed or 
wounded. In a successful terrorist activity on 2 May, a Vietcong underwater 
demolition team sank the USNS aircraft carrier Card while it was berthed in 
the Saigon River delivering helicopters. The Vietcong successes were sub-
stantially softening the South VieInamese population, while the activities 
in Laos presaged a possibility that the Communists might cut off the Hue area, 
thus presenting South Vietnam with another syMbolic "Dien Bien Phu." Where 
General Khanh had earlier expected to give priority to strengthening his 
government's position within South Vietnam, he told AMbassador Lodge on 
L. May that he wanted to declare war on North Vietnam, have the United States 
start out-country bombing, and to get 10,000 US Army Special Forces troops 
"to cover the whole Cambodian-Laotian border. "(33) 
In an interview on 13 April, Ho Chi Minh declared that if the United 
States and South Vietnam attempted to carry the war into North Vietnam, 
the North Vietnamese had "powerful friends ready to help." In the same 
interview, Ho spoke favorably of President de Gaulle's proposals to neu-
tralize South Vietnam, but he added that American forces would have to be 
withdrawn as a precondition to such discussions and that he would expect 
France's subsequent support for a peaceful unification of Vietnam. (3b) 
Later in the month, Hanoi's military undertakings in Laos appeared to be 
designed to secure the reconvening of the 14-nation conference on Laos, 
which if in session at a time of military reverses in South Vietnam would 
be useful to the Communist cause to negotiate a neutralization of that 
country. At the same time that Hanoi, with the support of Communist 
China, was engaging military-political pressure, the United States also 
was perfecting contingency planning. The Vietnam Coordinating Committee's 
studies noted that North Vietnam's economy was principally agrarian and 
included relatively few industrial targets whose destruction would have 
immediate military implications, but the working group outlined a scenario 
whereby gradually increasing air pressure starting with psychological

At the SECDEF conference in Hawaii on 1-2 June, Ambassador Lodge 
predicted that a selective bombing campaign against military targets in 
North Vietnam would bolster the shaky Khanh government and give the war-
weary South Vietnamese a feeling of unity. The Honolulu discussions 
concentrated on the implications of air attacks against North Vietnam, 
with the consensus being that major actions should await further de-
velopments.(44) As JCS chairman, General Twlor had not agreed to the 
Joint Chief's recommendations on 30 May, and after the Honolulu con-
ference Secretary McNamara accepted Taylor's view. On 10 June, he 
requested the Joint Chiefs to develop a three-phase air strike plan 
against North Vietnam that would begin with demonstrative strikes to 
show US readiness and intent to progress to an attack an all signifi-
cant military targets in North Vietnam. (1) In Hanoi on 18 June, the 
Canadian member of the Vietnam International Control Commission reminded 
Pham Van Dong that the United States was aware of the degree to which 
Hanoi controlled the Vietcong and that in the event of escalation the 
greatest devastation would fall upon North Vietnam. (!6) As requested 
by Secretary McNamara the Joint Chiefs of Staff J-3 and CINCPAC planners 
identified 94 air targets in North Vietnam and prepared contingency plans 
for their destruction in mounting phases of air activity. (17) Although 
these preparations were made, US policy continued to be that of countering 
insurgency within the borders of Laos and South Vietnam. 
2. Reorganization of Command Structures in South Vietnam 
In 1962 the US Military Assistance Command Vietnam had been organized 
primarily to provide advice and assistance to the MAP, and it had been 
modified, but not substantially reorganized, during the advisory years. 
Several factors argued for change in military organization during the 
winter of 1563-1964. In the upheaval following President Diem's assassi-
nation, RVNAF organization was changing, and at his arrival in Saigon as 
Deputy COMUSMACV on 27 January 1964 Lt General William C. Westmoreland 
was strongly committed to a reorganization of the US Military Assistance 
Command which he intended would eliminate duplication, facilitate coordi-
nation, econamize on personnel, and simplify advisory efforts with the 
Vietnamese. Unlike the earlier pattern of sub-unified military cammand 
organization represented by MACV, CINCPAC Operations Plan 37-64, approved 
by the Joint Chiefs on 17 April 1964, marked a return to CINCPAC component 
command integrity in its organization for air operations against North 
Vietnam, which would be conducted by CINCPACAF and C/NC Pacific Fleet 
under the overall direction of CINCPAC rather than oamusmAcv, who, Felt 
believed, should give full attention to the counterinsurgency operations 
inside South Vietnam and to adjacent problems in Laos. (148) 
When the US Joint Chiefs of Staff team had visited Vietnam in 
January 1963, General Wheeler had asked whether the United States 
required command authority over the Republic of Vietnamese Armed Forces, 
and General Harkins had responded that this would be contrary to US 
national policy and in any case would hot be accepted by the Vietnamese 
government.(49) Under US policy, Vietnamese forces would not be subor-
dinated to US control, and, while ETNAFallitary reorganization undertaken

by the Minh and Khahh governments in the winter of 1963-1964 had the benefit 
of VS advice, the activities of the SOuth Vietnamese military establishment were 
under the Vietnamese High Command and outside US control, since the advice 
given could be accepted or rejected.(50) As has been seen the UNAF Joint . 
General Staff's approach to military organization, first announced by Maj General 
Than Van Don in a speech on 2 DeceMber 1963, was to give the four OTZ commanders 
command over all air, naval, and parandlitary forces within their corps areas. 
The JOS submitted the proposal to MAC7 on 8 December and required a response 
within six days. Learning of the proposed reorganization, General Jacob E. 
Smart, CINCPACAF, personally protested to General Harkins an 13 Deceniber that 
the meager air resources of the VNAF simply could not be fragmented between the 
separate corps without a complete lass of effectiveness. At this moment, 
General Harkins agreed that such, a sweeping reorganization would be unnecessarily 
disruptive and asked General Don to give the matter more study. (51) 
Although the prospective fragmentation of VNAF was postponed, backdoor 
information in Saigon indicated that the US Ar mr Suction of the US NAAG 
continued active support for an organizational concept whereby the CTZ 
commanders were to be given local control over all military resources necessary 
for their counterinsurgency operations.(52) The same command concept was 
incorporated in the Chien Thang National Pacification Plan, which was drawn up 
without inputs from the 2d Air Division or MAW. On 31 January 1964, Maj 
General Joseph H. Moore, a long-time friend of Westmoreland's who had been 
serving as Tactical Air Command Deputy for Operations, arrived in Saigon as 
the new 2d Air Division commander, and on 6 February he was presented with 
the Chien Thang plan's requirements tor VNAF reorganization, not for comment 
but as an accomplished fact.(53) The plan called for the organization of VNAF 
tactical wing headquarters assigned to the corps areas with locations at Da 
Nang, Pleiku, Bien Hoa, and projected for Can Tho when the new airfield was 
completed there. It was planned that a rifth camposite airlift and reconnais-
sance wing would continue to operate 'Inder the central direction of the Air 
Operations Center. (54) 
Except far the personal influence of Colonel Nguyen Cao 4-, whose 
activity during the Minh coup had gained him caramond of the VNAF an 16 Decem-
ber 1963 and who increased his prestige by supporting the Khanh coup on 
30 January 1964, the VNAF might well have been divided between the four 
CTZs. In view of the political instability and rumors of coups by 
splinter groups, Ky personally assured Generals Moore and Rowland that 
he had no intention of relinquishing centralized control over VNAF, 
and to this end Ky took the position that the semantics of the Chien 
Thang plan required the new wings to be assigned to geographical corps 
areas rather than to corps commanders. Effective an 15 March the 41st 
Tactical Wing was established at Da Nang, under command of Major Pham 
Long Suu, the strongest VNAF officer Ay could provide, and the 516th 
Fighter Squadron was moved to Da Nang from Nha Trang. Similarly, the 
62d Tactical Wing was organized at Pleiku, under command of another strong 
VNAF officer, Major Minh. In April, when Mej General Trani Thien Khiem, 
CINC MAP', recommended assignment of VNAF liaison and helicopter equadrons 
to ARVN, Ky told Khiem that he resented the implication that Mr was not 
operating satisfactorily and that if apr air units were given to the AEVNI 
Khiem could get a new air commander. General Harkins also opposed the

transfer as likely to cause confusion, and Khiem backed away from it in 
the face of Ky's remonstrance. (SS) In negotiations with Ky., General Moore 
attempted to preserve the integrity of the tactical air control system, 
including the responsibilities of the ASOCs. Since the VNAF wing comman-
ders at Da Nang and Pleiku advised and conjoined planning with the CTZ 
commanders, the I and II ASOCs were reduced in effectiveness. The sub-
ASOC at Nha Trang was closed when the 516th Squadron moved to Da Nang, 
and coincident with the organization of the 41st Wing at Da Nang the 
VNAF personnel and VHF radio communications were removed from the I ASOC 
to the wing operations building on the flight line. General Moore 
protested that the I ASOC ought to function effectively in a location 
adjacent to the I CTZ tactical operations center, but icy insisted that, 
in the case of a coup attempt, the I CTZ commander must not be able to 
seize control of the ASOCIs communications, thereby preventing timely 
use of the 41st Wing to thwart the coup attempt. (S6) 
On the whole, General Moore considered that the VNAF organization 
was close enough to classic tactical air organizational concepts to be 
acceptable, and the Thirteenth Air Force commander, General Maddux, 
made the decision not to argue about the defects of the organization. (7) 
By maintaining the integrity of his command (and also defending VNAF 
bases against ARVN take-overs) icy was able to employ the Vietnamese air 
units as a national counter-coup force. On the other hand, the VNAF 
organization reduced American influence over Vietnamese air operations. 
Unknown to the US Argy and USAF advisors at Da Nang until just before 
the attack took place (and then only because white phosphorous bombs were 
required from US stocks), the 41st Wing and I CTZ staffs planned and laid 
on a night time/distance medium-level bombing mission against a reported 
Vietcong training center inland from Da Nang on 30 March. Twelve T-28s 
and four A-1 Hs were used on the raid, and Colonel Ky, who rode in one of 
the T-28s, described it a highly successful demonstration of a "new night 
bombing capability." ARVN photo interpreters gave a glowing account 
of damages to the Vietcong, but US Army photo interpreters were unable 
to find the same results.(58) The employment of VNAF as a political 
force had some detrimental aspects. Favored "palace guardu air units 
based at Bien Hoa and Tan Son Nhut appeared to have higher priorities 
for support than those farther from Saigon, and sincere young VNAF 
officers were bewildered and frustrated because their seniors were so 
deeply involved in political affairs. (S9) 
In the Air Force view, the major command problem in Vietnam since 
1962 had been the inability to get experienced air officers of properly 
influential rank assigned to the MACV joint staff, not for the purpose 
of service aggrandizement but to insure that the capabilities and 
limitations of airpower were adequately recognized and supported in 
counterinsurgency plans and operations. It was the Air Force position 
that the MACV subunified command staff should be jointly manned rather 
than dominated by US Army officers, and that component subunified Argy 
and Navy commands should be organized under COMUSMACV, with an equivalent 
stature to the 2d Air Division. Sympathetic to the requirement for a

senior USAF representative in the mainstream of MACV current operational 
,policy formulation, Admiral Felt recommended in September 1963 that the 
MACV chief of staff position should be filled by an Air Force officer 
when it became vacant in mid-1964, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved 
the recommendation on 7 November. During the December visit to Saigon, 
however, Secretary McNamara in discussions with General Harkins determined 
that Lt General William C. Westmoreland should be assigned in a new posi-
tion as Deputy COMUSMADV, that the J-1 position (then manned by the US Navy) 
should be filled by Brig General B. Sternberg of the US Army, and that the 
USAF colonel serving as J-2 should be downgraded to Deputy J-2 and replaced 
by Brig General C. A. Ibungdale of the US Marine Corps. Secretary McNamara 
also considered the existing MACV organization to be too complex and 
directed General Harkins to submit a reorganization plan that would save 
personnel and simplify functional arrangements.(60) The staff changes 
reduced the Air Force allocation of J-staff positions to the post of J-5 
Plans held by Maj General Milton B. Adams, but in McNamara 's estimation 
the Air Force was well represented in Saigon since in addition to the J-5 
it had general officers present as ad Air Division commander and Chief, 
Air Force Section, MAAG.(61) 
In Hawaii, Admiral Felt and General Smart questioned the wisdom of 
a sweeping reorganization of the US Military command and assistance 
effort in South Vietnam which would take place over several months and 
at the same time that the Government of Vietnam was already badly con-
fused by two coups. In Saigon, however, General Sternberg prepared a 
preliminary feasibility study of the reorganization which represented 
General Westmoreland's thinking that the MACV and MAG functions should 
be cambined and that MACV should be more in the nature of a "specified 
army command" than a "subordinate joint cammand."(62) Although General 
Smart could see that the preponderant size of the US Army advisory and 
assistance effort in Vietnam demanded large US Army representation in 
the MAND and posed additional requirements for the organization of a US 
Army component headquarters, the logic of the insistence that the US 
Army should daminate the MACV staff escaped him. In conversations with 
Secretary McNamara and General Taylor on 12 March, General Smart urged 
that the MACV reorganization ought to place airmen in planning and 
decision-making positions in order that airpower would be effectively 
employed. Secretary McNamara, however, replied that he knew of no 
operation that had suffered for lack of air support, and while General 
Taylor interjected that he knew of same such instances he considered 
that they were caused by inadequate communications and could not be 
attributed to faulty organization or unsound policy. Admiral Felt 
nevertheless stated that there were instances where US Army advisors 
would not pass on requests for Air Force support but sought to use 
Army aviation resources instead, thus furthering US Army doctrinal 
concepts. (63) 
After receiving and staffing the MACV reorganization study sent 
forward on 12 March, Admiral Felt posed a number of specific objections 
to it to the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 22 March, all adding up to a sum-
mary recommendation that the major reorganization should not be under-
taken but that COMUSMACV should eliminate duplication and unnecessary

staff elements on his own authority. On 8 April, however, Secretary 
McNamara gave an unqualified approval to the reorganization and 
authorized COMUSMACV to reorganize and man his headquarters as he saw 
fit, the reorganization to be effected by changes in a new MACV joint 
table of distribution that provided its manpower authority.(64) At 
this juncture, PICIF continued to hope that conversations between 
Generals Westmoreland and Moore would result in an increase in the 
number of senior kir Force personnel in the command and operations 
sections of the MACV staff. (65) General Westmoreland agreed that 
General Moore -- as Air Force component commander -- had not been used 
properly in the past and would be consulted on MACV air plans and policy 
in the future, and so informed General Wheeler on 17 April.(66) Other 
than this, the kir Force fared poorly. The MACV J-3, Maj General 
Richard.G. Stilwell, complained that the incumbent lir Force Deputy J-3 
(who was highly regarded by the 2d Air Division) was unable to "look at 
J-3 matters except through USAF tinted glasses," did not know anything 
about ground operations, and was of little use in the J-3. Accordingly, 
Stilwell secured a change in the deputy J-3 slot from kir Force to Army 
manning.(67) General Moore urged that an Air Force officer should be 
assigned as MACV chief of staff when General Weede completed his tour 
in May, but instead Maj General Richard Stilwell was moved up to chief 
of staff and another Army officer, Brig General W. E. DePuy, replaced 
Stilwell as MACV J-3.(68) 
The MACV reorganization became effective on 15 May 1964, at which 
time MA41 Vietnam was disestablished. US Army HAAG functions were 
absorbed into an expanded MACV staff; the US Army CTZ advisory groups 
were assigned directly to MACV; the Air Force Section, MAAG, was 
redesignated as the Air Force Advisory Group and, while assigned to 
MACV, was further assigned to the Air Force camponent commander for 
command and operational control. In the new arrangement, General Moore, 
as kir Force component commander, was the senior advisor to the VNAF and 
responsible for the Air Force Advisory Group and Air Base Advisory Team 
activities, and General Rowland, as Chief of the Air Forae Advisory 
Group, would act as Moore's deputy for the VNAF military assistance 
program. (69) In General Smart's view, the MACV reorganization did 
nothing to provide additional air knowledge and experience in MACV 
positions having a direct relationship to the direction of operations 
in Vietnam; moreover, where the reorganization had been expected to 
streamline effectiveness and reduce personnel, the new MACV JTD proposed 
an increased staff authorization for 283 US Amy, 24 US Navy/Marine, and 
3 USAF personnel. As a minimum, Smart recommended that 38 additional USAF 
officers should be assigned as certain directorate and branch chiefs in 
the MACV staff. (70) In September, MACV submitted a revised JTD which 
included 71 additional Air Force spaces, chiefly for field advisory work 
and none for Smart's recommended changes on the MACV staff. (71) 
On 20 June, General Westmoreland relieved General Harkins (who had 
reached retirement age and would not be extended) as COMUSMACV, introduc-
ing the possibility that an Air Force officer could be named Deputy 
COMUSMACV. Earlier in June, General Westmoreland initially stated that

he would not need a deputy commander, but, in US Joint Chiefs of Staff 
discussions of the matter, General LOW advanced the position that in 
order to preserve the unified nature of MACV the Deputy COMUS should be 
from another service from that of General Westmoreland and that, in view 
of prospective broadening air operations in Southeast Asia, the Deputy , 
COMUS shOuld be an Air Force general. The Navy and Marine Corps agreed 
with LeMay. On the other hand, General Wheeler did not consider that 
Westmoreland required a deputy in the immediate future, and he suggested 
that if air operations were expanded the Commander, 2d Air Division, could 
be given the additional designation as Deputy COMUSMACV for Air. In his 
opinion as JCS Chairman, General Taylor recommended that the deputy posi-
tion should be filled, that he should be able to provide across-the-
board assistance to Westmoreland, and that, in view of the nature of 
operations in South Vietnam, it was that the deputy should 
be any:thing other than a two- or three-star Army general. Taylor also 
asked Westmoreland for additional thoughts, and Westmoreland recommended 
a US Army general officer be assigned as his deputy. On 18 June, 
Secretary McNamara approved Taylor's recommendation by a pencilled note 
on the chairman's memo, and Lt General J. L. Throckmorton was subsequently 
assigned as Deputy COMUSMACV. In JCS actions, General LeMay continued to 
raise the issue of the need for Air Force expertise on the MACV staff 
including an Air Force general officer in the command section, mid, in 
September, General Westmoreland proposed that the 2d Air Division command-
er be given the additional duty as Deputy COMUSMACV for Air Operations. 
Both PACAF and USAF opposed the additional designation since it did not 
promise to provide the MACV staff any real additional help in air matters, 
but Westmoreland submitted the proposal in a revision to the MACV joint 
table of distribution, and on 12 November 1964 CINCPAC bowed to the 
"political climate" and reccmmended-it to the joint Chiefs of Staff. (72) 
In JCS actions in Washington early in 1965, the Air Force would 
continue to insist that COMUSMACV required a joint staff fully repre-
sentative of all US services and arLAir Force officer as Deputy COMUSMACV, 
but by March General Westmoreland would begin to urge that the situation 
in Southeast Asia demanded implementation of the organizational actions 
specified in CINCPAC Operations Plan 32, namely the establishment of 
Headquarters, COMUS Southeast Asia (COM(JSSEASIA). In addition to the 
increasingly unilateral US military effort against North Vietnam, Thailand 
had never liked the Saigon residency of the double-hatted COMUSMACV-THAI 
and now demanded that any combat employments of US forces from Thailand 
should not be commanded from Saigon. In view of Thai sensitivities, 
Ambasssdor Graham A. Martin had recommended in June 1964 that COMUSMACV 
and COMUSMACTHAI be split, and, in the event that this were done, the 
Joint Chiefs had recommended that a USAF lieutenant general be appointed 
COMUSMACTHAI. Secretary McNamara postponed coordination of the split 
in November 1964, and General Westmoreland opposed it, arguing among 
other things that the 2d Air Division was conducting air operations 
throughout Southeast Asia and control of the many and varied air opera-
tions in one theater should be under one air commander. After discus-
sions with General Moore, Westmoreland proposed on 30 March 1965 that 
moves be taken toward establishment of COMUSSEASIA, with headquarters

either in Saigon or Korat, that both MACV and MACTHAI should be under 
overall command of COMUSSEASIA, and that the 2d Air Division should be 
upgraded to a numbered Air Force, under command of a USAF lieutenant 
general and a major general deputy commander, the former to act as 
Westmorelandfs Air Force Component Commander with command over all 
Air Force combat and support units in Southeast Asia, coordination 
authority over other USAF activities in Southeast Asia, and further 
coordination authority over US Navy air operations over land in 
Southeast Asia. Since US contingency plans required establishment of 
COMUSSEASIA only in the event of overt Chinese Communist intervention, 
COMUSSEASIA would never be organized, but, on 31 March, CINCPAC favored 
command changes that would look toward this eventuality. In the pro-
gression of organizational events, General Moore, as Commander, 2d Air 
Division, would be promoted to lieutenant general on 25 June 1965 with 
additional duty as Deputy COMUSMACV for Air Operations. On 8 July, the 
2d Air Division would be relieved from assignment to the Thirteenth 
Air Force and assigned directly to PACAF. On 8 July, COMUSMACV and 
COMUSMACTHAI were officially separated. In the air command reorganiza-
tion, Commander, 2d Air Division received cumaand authority over PACAF 
organizations in South Vietnam, and operational control over PACAF orga-
nizations in Thailand, the latter remaining assigned to the Thirteenth 
Air Force for administration and logistic support. (73) 
In the same months after mid-1964 in which over-all US command re-
lationships in Southeast Asia were in transition, the MACV reorganiza-
tion of 15 May 1964 had SOMB beneficial aspects for the 2d Air Division 
but also produced some complexities. Air Force officers generally 
agreed that the consolidation of USAF activity incident to the assign-
ment of the Air Force Advisory Group to the Commander, 2d Air Division, 
for command and operational control was both overdue and beneficial. 
The combination of USAF functions increased the unity of USAF activity 
and relieved a previous situation whereby MAAG Air Base Advisory Teams 
and 2d Air Division ALOs and ASOC personnel had sometires been played 
at cross-purposes by the Vietnamese.(74) In recognition that the MACV 
staff was not manned by adequate numbers of qualified Air Force personnel, 
General Westmoreland frequently stated that the 2d Air Division must pro-
vide the MACV staff with all assistance and advice on air matters. (75') 
Reflecting the harmonious associatinn of General Moore with General 
Westmoreland, MACV and the 2d Air Division established better working 
relationships and, as will be seen, the relationships of US Army and 
US Air Force elements in Vietnam also markedly improved in the last 
half of 1964.(76) 
On the other hand, General Westmoreland continued in personal 
command of US Army components in South Vietnam, a practice that was 
in violation of the US Unified Action Armed Forces principle that 
unified commanders must be divorced from service operations while 
commanding unified activities and which also, in effect, subordinated 
the MACV Air Component Commander to the Army Component Commander. The 
lack of joint service expertise on the MACV staff made it difficult 
for the staff to handle legitimately joint matters. For example, as

will be seen, the MACV Joint Airlift Allocations Board was actually only 
one badly swamped staff officer in the MACV J-4 division. (77) The MACV 
Joint Research and Test Activity (JRATA), headed by Brig General John K. 
Boles, Jr., was so dominated by Army officers in rank and numbers that 
USAF was reluctant to undertake any testing of combined concepts or 
combinations of equipment in Vietnam. (78) Although the assignment of 
the USAF colonel to the MACV J-3 for liaison duty in the RVNAF Joint 
General Staff had good results in getting consideration for air matters, 
only eight of 45 officers in MACV J-3 were USAF officers and only the 
USAF MS liaison officer was a full aolonel.(79) The scarce air exper-
tise in the MACV J-3 worked against its handling major air matters, and 
these were generally entrusted to the 2d Air Division staff. The MACV 
J-3 nevertheless took increasing control of day-to-day air operations, 
initially through the agency of the J-3 manning of the American MAC 
Staff Element (MABSTELM) in the RVNAF MS-Joint Operations Center. 
Under the May 1964 MACV reorganization, an Army Air Operations Section 
(AAOS) was established and manned with J-3 personnel in the JGS-JOC, 
with the mission of allocating US Arly Aviation to the CTZs and main-
taining operational control over other US Army aviation resources that 
were not allocated. In the expectation that increased cooperative 
planning would result, General Moore got General Westmoreland to co-
locate the AAOS with the VNAF/USAF Air Operations Center, but, as a 
matter of fact, any joint planning and scheduling done was conducted 
in the RVNAF JGS-JOC, and the AAOS and AOC were only action agencies. 
In this organizational complex, the MACV J-3 channeled operational 
directions pertaining to VNAF/USAF activities to the JGS-JOC, which 
passed them to the AOC for implementation. On occasions, the MACV J-3 
did not use the circuit through the JGS-JOC but went directly to the 
AOC, In order to provide coordinaticn to US Army and USAF infra-red 
reconnaissance, the MACV Target Research and Analysis Center, as will 
be seen, would be organized in December 1964 as a function of MACV J-2 
and with a missim of centralized targeting, which included requirements 
for reconnaissance levied upon the AAOS and the AOC. (So) 
During 1964 the organizational procedures of MACV J-3 and MACV J-2 
effectively by-passed the Commanders of VNAF and of the 2d Air Division 
in the handling of day-to-day air operations, and, although the organi-
zational frameworl.c of.te TACS followed doctrinal lines, the initiative 
of the tactical air acmpander in managing in-country tactical air warfare 
tasks of air superiority, air interdiction, and air support was reduced, 
this despite General Moore's title as Deputy COMUSMACV for Air Operations. 
The organizational developments gradually implanted during 1964 would 
in months to follow yield a Joint Air-Ground Operations System in South 
Vietnam, incorporating the Army Air-Ground System (AAGS) and the Air 
Force Tactical Air Control System and reflecting a stated concept that ' 
aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and air interdiction operations 
would be immediately responsive to the requirements of ground commanders. 
Under the JAGOS, the highest echelon of the LAGS would be the Tactical 
Air Support Element (TASE) of the MACV Combat Operations Center, the 
TASE being made up of a J-2 Air Group and a J-3 Air Group. The TASE 
handled all matters related to ground requested tactical aerial reconnais-
sance, close air support, and aerial interdiction within South Vietnam,

validated requests, and passed Air Force missions into the TACS for 
execution. The MACV directive which established the JAGOS noted that 
all delivery of aerial firepower in South Vietnam.-- including aerial 
interdiction, which had long been considered an initiative of an air 
commander -- would be ground support and would be responsive to the 
initiative and requirements of ground commanders. (81) 
3. Collapsing Tactical Air Capabilities in Vietnam Demanded Attention 
During his conversation with Secretary McNamara in Hawaii on 12 March 
1964, General Smart emphasized that the attitudes particularly of senior 
personnel who often stated that South Vietnam conflict was a "ground war" 
had not permitted an emphasis upon a proper role for air forces. He 
pointed to the two air control systems in South Vietnam -- the TAGS and 
the Army aviation system -- as producing mutual interference and as an 
evidence that the Army wanted to prove a case for Army aviation and the 
feasibility of using strike helicopters and strike aircraft under Army 
control. Smart insisted that the war in South Vietnam could not be 
classified as a "ground war" or "air war" but was a conflict that de-
manded the best effort that could be mustered by the combined strengths 
of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, integrated with economic, political, 
and psychological efforts of non-military agencies. (82) 
Although General Smart's logic did not secure the addition of air 
expertise to the MACV command echelon, the focus of attention in air 
problems accompanying the organizational changes, together with mani-
festations of failing tactical air capabilities, brought evolutionary 
rather than immediate improvements -- many of the improvements coming 
too late to affect the declining tactical situation. As matters stood 
at the beginning of 1964, there was a high-level hope that the assign-
ment of Generals Westmoreland and Moore in Saigon would result in a 
clarification of air problems. When Westmoreland was preparing for his 
new assignment, General Wheeler specifically instructed him that he was 
expected "to get the air missions straightened out." Wheeler continued 
to emphasize that he would not tolerate any fight for "hide bound doc-
trinal concepts" which interfered with the war effort. When Army doc-
trine interfered with the war effort, Wheeler said that he, as Army 
Chief of Staff, could and would change doctrine with a stroke of his 
pen. (83) In January 1964 Admiral Felt suggested that the unnecessary 
ARVN defeat west of Ben Cat, which resulted framenploymentof armed 
helicopter fire support rather than strike aircraft, denoted a lack 
of adequate air advice to the ARVN, and General Harkins promised that 
Westmoreland and Moore would survey the situation and provide procedures 
for a fully coordinated air support effort. (8L) 
"The word for the Air Force in Vietnam," General Anthis had written 
in his end-of-tour report as Commander, 2d Air Division, "is austerity." 
At his arrival, General Moore had Anthis' summation that air resources 
in South Vietnam were not meeting requirements -- or opportunities for 
air employment -, because of the war-weariness of air commando aircraft, 
the limited capability of VNAF to expand, and the slowness of the

inadequate AHVN air request net in passing requirements for air support. (8S) 
In accordance with the "Accelerated HVNAF Model Plan" developed following 
Secretary McNamara 's visit to Saigon in October 1963, the USAF 34th Tacti- ? 
cal Group was expected to begin to phase out of Vietnam beginning with the 
19th Tactical Air Support Squadron in mid-1964 and the 1st Air Commando 
Squadron in mid-1965. As has been seen, Secretary McNamara was quite 
insistent that the US 0-1s should phase out of South Vietnam as soon as 
new VNAF liaison squadrons could be organized, and General Harkins deter-
mined that the 19th TASS, which provided FAC aircraft, should be phased 
out before the US Amy 73d Aviation Company, whose 0-1s served US Army 
Advisors. In the VNAF program, the new 518th Fighter Squadron was sched-
uled to receive MAP A-1H aircraft beginning in March 1964, and in this 
same month the 716th Reconnaissance Squadron was programmed to have its 
18 RI-28s and 3 RC-47s. In order to meet expected attrition at the 1963 
rate and continue in operation during 1964, the USAF 34th Tactical Group's 
1st Air Commando Squadron expected to receive 18 rebuilt "On Mark" B-26Ks, 
the first two to be delivered in June 1964. As previously seen, the air 
commando B-26s were very war weary, but the 2d Air Division expected that 
they would survive with careful flying and that predicted attrition rates 
would hold good, provided the Vietcong did not introduce large caliber 
weapons with antiaircraft sighting devices. The USAF T-28s were programmed 
to be replaced on a one-for-one basis with dual-piloted A-1E aircraft in 
the second quarter of 1964.(86) 
In the last half of 1963 the VNAF and USAF had been unable to meet 
requirements for combat strike sorties in support of AHVN operations, 
and in January 1964 the III CTZ ALO reported that the VNAF-USAF were not 
filling half of the air support requests originating within the corps, 
a condition that was obscured by the serious deficiencies in the III CTZ 
air request net, which prevented many requests for air support from reach-
ing the ASOC.(87) Already behind the power curve, VNAF-USAF aircraft re-
ceived growing damages from Vietcong ground defenses, which commonly in-
cluded captured 50-ca1iber machineguns.(88) The ground fire shot down a 
T-28 and B-26, and, even more ominously on 7 January a B-26 lost its tail 
section on a test flight, resulting in the death of the pilot and co-pilot. 
On 11 February another B-26 at Eglin AFB in the United States lost awing 
in flight; and all B-26s in Vietnam were promptly grounded and were out of 
combat, except for straight and level flying with minimum ordnance loads. (89) 
In view of the uncertain combat worthiness of the old B-26s, PACAF had 
recommended on 8 January that one squadron of the 3d Bombardment Wing's 
light jet B-57 aircraft should be deployed to Bien Hoa from Japan. The 
3d Wing's B-57s were being phased out of the USAF inventory, but they 
were admirable planes for service in Vietnam, since their jet speed would 
enable them to respond quickly to air support requests. (90) At a MACV 
staff meeting on 17 February, Generals Harkins and Westmoreland expressed 
great concern over the loss of the B-26 capabilities, which Westmoreland 
described as the USAF "Sunday Punch capability." In the next two weeks, 
both General Harkins and Admiral Felt recommended that a squadron of B-57s 
be brought to Bien Hoa and operated under Farm Gate rules, with combined 
USAF-VNAF crews and Vietnamese markings. On 2 March the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff recommended the B-57 deployment to Secretary McNamara. (91)

....m.?..1\L I 
At conferences in Saigon on 8-10 March, Secretary McNamara was 
most interested in discussing }VNAF clear-and-hold operations. He 
questioned General Moore about VNAF requirements, but delayed discussions 
about replacement aircraft for USAF since he thought this to be peripheral 
to the main problem. When the matter came up, McNamara inferred that it 
would be cheaper to give extra aircraft to VNAF than to bring in more USAF 
aircraft. Before departing Saigon, however, McNamara decided to equip 
all three of the Vietnamese fighter squadrons with A-1H aircraft, this 
by providing the 514th Squadron with 25 A:.ls to replace its T-28s. He 
also directed that the USAF 1st Air Commando Squadron would be provided 
30 A-lEs to replace its B-26s and T-28s.(92) In Hawaii on 12 March, General 
Smart pointed out to Secretary McNamara that more than 30 percent of the 
enemy casualties in South Vietnam (14,944 out of 49,100 casualties in 
1962-1963) had been attributed to the tactical air effort. If a small 
number of obsolete aircraft could produce casualties in these quantities, 
an increased number of more capable aircraft could logically be expected 
to produce more. Secretary McNamara replied that he appreciated the 
reasons why B-57s were desired but that there introduction was "hard." 
He felt that before this "hard" task was undertaken, the United States 
should exploit the easier road of introducing increased non-jet air 
strengths if it could be demonstrated that doing so would materially 
assist in winning the war. Although McNamara was unwilling to introduce 
the B-57s for air support within South Vietnam, he was interested in 
their potential employment in the 34A covert operations against North 
Vietnam. General Smart did not feel that he had sufficient time to 
present the case for the B-57s to McNamara and asked General LeMay to 
do what he could with the Secretary. McNamara was not persuaded. His 
recommendations, approved by President Johnson, included providing the 
VNAF 25 A-IHs in exchange for its T-28s, and on 20 March he informed 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff that B-57s would not be deployed to Vietnam 
to offset the air support capability caused by the collapse of the B-26s 
but that he would consider moving the B-57s to another Pacific base. As 
recommended by LeMay and Felt, arrangements were completed by the month's 
end to deploy 48 B-57 aircraft and accompanying personnel without 
dependents from Yokota Air Base in Japan to Clark Air Base in the 
Philippines. (93) At Bien Hoa, Colonel Benjamin S. Preston:, Jr., 34th 
Tactical Group commander, attempted unsuccessfully to get some use from 
the B-26s; he found, for example, two old Norden bomb sights and had 
them lashed in the glass noses of two RB=26s for straight and level 
bombing. This experiment showed little pramise; moreover, every 3-26 
on hand had cracked stress plates and loose rivets throughout their 
wing structures. The B-26s clearly could not be saved, and on 8 April 
the last of the B-26s and RB-26s were ferried to Clark Air Base for 
salvage. (9!) 
As long as the T-28s had not faced significant ground fire they had 
been effective counterinsurgency planes, despite their relatively slow 
speed and armament loading limitations. With the growth of Vietcong 
ground fire, they werequite vulnerable. On 18 February, a T-28 was hit 
while flying an interdiction mission, the crew fortunately escaping 
major injury in a crash landing. The following day, another T-28 was

shot down while making a strafing pass in support of a ground operation, 
and the crewmen were killed. Three VNAF A-1Hs were also lost in February 
because of enemy ground fire. (95) Since the T-28s had outlived their 
safe employment in Vietnam, replacement A-1 Skyraider aircraft promised 
increased tactical air capabilities, and the new VNAF 518th Fighter 
Squadron, with ten of twenty-five authorized A-1Hs, began to fly combat 
from Bien Hoa on 18 March.(96) In MeV on 18 March, however, Colonel 
George I. Ruddell, the Deputy J-3, completed a survey of the effect of 
hostile ground fire on aircraft survivability which indicated that the 
time had come when enemy defenses demanded a return to standard Air 
Force four-aircraft fighter flights,thus permitting each echelon of two 
planes to protect the other during low-level passes. These tactics 
necessitated more airframes, and Colonel Ruddell recommended that the 
34th Tactical Group be provided two squadrons each of 25 A-1Es, rather 
than the single squadron of 30 A-1Es. General Harkins accepted the re-
quirement as did PACAF, which determined that the second USAF A-1E 
squadron could be outfitted and in place by November 1964. On 1 April, 
Admiral Felt recommended the two USAF A-1E squadrons to the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff.(97) 
In the fortnight when the requests for 34th Tactical Group augmenta-
tion were going fox-Ward, Colonel Preston, who had just been compelled to 
stand dawn the combat-worn B-26s, had reason to doubt whether he could 
keep the 1st Air Commando Squadron in operation at all. He had taken 
action to transition 10 B-26 pilots to T-28s, but on 24 March, while on 
a bomb run near Soc Trang, a T-28B, piloted by Captain Edwin G. Shank, Jr., 
lost a wing and crashed, killing Shank and the VNAF crewman. Preston 
went into the jungle, examined the wreckage, and determined that the wing 
bolts had sheared off under high-G stress under circumstances virtually 
identical to the earlier crash loss of another T-28 the previous October. 
After the accident in October, all -'228s had been closely inspected, and 
in Preston's estimation aircraft maintenance in the 34th Group was excel-
lent. The loss of the T-28, following so closely after B-26 wing failures, 
made pilots "leary," and on 1 April General Moore informed USAF that "the 
2AD is practically flat out of business." On 9 April another T-28 crew, 
making a third strafing pass over a heavily defended target, snapped off 
another wing and crashed. Colonel Preston had already arranged for two 
North American aircraft specialists to fly to Bien &a, and these engi-
neers ran inspections on the T-28s and also provided flying restrictions 
on the planes. The T-28 simply could not take "slam-bang type flying" 
since it was a trainer and not a properly stressed fighter bomber: the 
T-28 lost on 9 April, for example, was judged to have been pulling at 
least seven Gs. At the recommendation of the engineers, Preston retired 
the five remaining "Jungle Jim" T-2135 that had been in combat since 
November 1961. -Nine newer T-28s released by VNAF were borrowed, thus 
providing the 1st Air Commando Squadron with 15 serviceable T-28s for 
combat. Pilots were warned about G-limits, were cautioned not to land 
if carrying external ordnance, and "B" model T-28s were flown with 
limits on ordnance loadings on wing stations. In order to cut damages 
from hostile small arms fire, Preston also obtained an order from the 
2d Air Division establishing a 1,000foot minimum altitude restriction

on 34th Group attack runs. Under these restrictions the USAF T-28s 
would remain in operation until they could be replaced with A-lBs.(98) 
Early in 1964 the threatened collapse of USAF air commando capa-
bilities occupied much of the attention of the 2d Air Division, but a 
running survey of field operations, principally underway in the III and 
IV CTZs, revealed problems in the control of strike aircraft. As far as 
incomplete recordings showed, 1,546 air strike requests were received by 
the A.SOCs in January-March 1964, of which 424 could not be honored, in-
cluding 230 because of lack of available aircraft. These figures did 
not represent true requirements, since ARVN commanders did not like to make 
requests after being turned down, and III CTZ FACs reported that they also 
were discouraged at the prospect of encouraging requests for air support 
that could not be honored. (99) The pattern of operations in January yielded 
slight results. On 16-19 January the ARVN 21st Division's Operation Dan 
Chi 7 in An Xuyen province employed the greatest number of tactical air 
support sorties yet flown in the division's area of responsibilitY (44 
sorties on the first day) but the heliborne operation made no significant 
contact with the enemy.(100) an 17-28 January, the ARVN 7th Division 
mounted Operation Phung Hoang 1 as a large search and clear heliborne and 
water invasion into the Thanh Phu district of Kien Hoa province where a 
prisoner of war reported and aerial photography confirmed the presence 
of a Vietcong base area and training camp. Despite artillery fire and 
prelanding air strikes by T-28s and B-26s against landing zones, first 
waves of helicopters on 17 January met strong ground fire that shot down 
a UH-1B gunship and scored multiple hits on all 32 helicopters. On 18 
January the operation continued, and another armed UH-1B was hit, went 
down in the water, and only the copilot and a crewman were successfully 
rescued in an incident that did much to establish a requirement for a 
professional air rescue force in South Vietnam. In afidition to pre-strikes, 
continuous fighter cover was maintained over the Phuong Hoang 1 area on 
17-18 January; by 19 January the Vietcong had lost 46 killed and 97 captured, 
plus their training center, but friendly losses included 20 dead, 25 wounded, 
and two UH-1B helicopters destroyed. (101) The problem had been pointed out 
earlier, but air reports of Dan Chi 7 and Phung Hoang 1 emphasized that 
JGS-MACV regulations did not provide any guidance as to aerial coordination 
and who was in command over a heliborne landing area. The only person who 
actually had authority to tell tactical air what to do was the VNAF FAC, 
who lacked rank and experience to be an air commander. (102) 
In the same weeks of January 1964 that large ARVN operations were 
not accomplishing spectacular results, there were indications that smaller 
applications of air strike forces and air support for provincial forces 
could be profitable. In the ARVN 5th Division area of the III CTZ, for 
example, the USAF ALO pointed out that Vietcong cooking fires were lit 
freely at dusk, an indication that the enemy understood that VNAF pilots 
did not like to fly at night. On 16 January, a VNAF C-47 flareship and 
4 A-1Hs successfully attacked one Vietcong assemblage in Tay Ninh pro-
vince, but most night attack air requests submitted by the 5th Division 
40 were not honored. In day pinpoint strikes in Tay Ninh province only 
14 of 67 requested interdiction targets were struck in February. In

addition, 27 last resort SCAT targets were hit, but in regard to these 
targets VNAF 514th Fighter Squadron pilots went on record with complaints 
that they were "sick and tired of expending their ordnance on nothing 
but empty fields, trees, and jungles. "(103) One of the problems affecting 
air interdiction strikes in Tay Ninh province was the fact that the ARVN 
5th Division commander required all of them to be processed at some length 
through his headquarters, with the result that any immediate sightings of 
the enemy disappeared before they were targeted. On the other hand, USAF 
ALOs operating with provincial forces in two separate employments in 
Phuoc Tuy province and in the Binh Lam Special Zone (Binh Thuan and Lam 
Dong provinces) during January and February reported good results from 
SCAT strikes against enemy held areas which could not be entered by the 
provincial troops. In these "remote locations" in the east coast provinces 
of the III CTZ, the problems affecting air operations were complicated by 
circumstances and regulations. At Baria, the Phuoc Thy FAC had good 
rapport with the province chief who was authorized to approve air targets, 
and reported that he knew the enemy's activities like the back of his hand, 
but in order to manage an attack he had to get a usually disinterested VNAF 
FAC, who had no familiarity with the areal, to f4 to Baria to mark the 
target. (104) The Binh Lam Special Zane ALO had much the same report of the 
unrealibility of VNAF PACs who were sent to Phan Thiet for operations, and 
the problem was compounded by the fact that the popular force commanders 
vastly feared any sort of close fire support, whether by artillery, armed 
helicopters, or strike aircraft. The Binh Lam ALO recommended the USAF 
ALO/FAC program had mainly been concerned with advising corps and division 
staffs whereas it would have been more advantageous to have worked with 
province chiefs and with regimental, battalion, and company cammanders.(105) 
After January US Army advisors in the TIT and IV CTZ stressed the 
importance of small unit operations and quick reaction helio assaults 
throughout the day and desirably Into the night. in the case of larger 
heliborne operations, the peak periods of air cover, escort, and pre-
strike had normally lasted only 1 to 3 hours a day, and operational 
schedules could be preplanned, but the changing concept called for quick 
reaction on the part of tactical fighters over a period of at least ten 
hours a day.(106) In the III CTZ, the III ASOC recognized that VNAF normally 
required 30 minutes to scramble aircraft in response to an air support 
request, and, where feasible, attempted to keep aircraft on air alert over 
the main operational areas of the III CTZ so that they might be directed 
to the support of any of several small operations that might be in progress. 
Even with air alert, however, an hour was required to process a request for 
air support through the III CTZ ARVN air request net. (107) In order to 
increase responsiveness, the III CTZ ALO, Lt Colonel Mellish, advocated 
forward staging of fighter aircraft into advanced airfields, and on 
17-18 March three T-28s were sent on ground alert to Phan Thiet where 
Vietcong activity was expected at a time that Binh Lam Special Zone 
forces were resettling several thousand Montagnards in Lam Dong province. 
Since the Vietcong did not respond to the operation, the T-28s had no 
employment and the 34th Tactical Group pointed out that the planes were 
exposed to very marginal safety considerations, which ought not to be 
done unless the importance of the Operation was great enough to warrant

the risk.(108) In addition to the problem of responsiveness, the number of 
tactical air sorties available for the support of the III CTZ on a busy 
operations day was approximately 30, whereas by comparison US Army 
aviation support assigned to the III CTZ included 17 utility UH-IBs, 
11 HU-1B gunships, 2 Caribou transports, 4 Otter utility transports, 
2 Mohawk armed reconnaissance planes, and 8 L-19 liaison aircraft -- an 
aircraft complement that was said to fly an average of 275 sorties a day. (109) 
In the changed concept of smaller ARVN operations in the road-
limited IV CTZ after January 1964 as many as four or five heliborne 
operations -- including Eagle flight and rapid response helicopter 
flights -- were not uncommonly underway each day in the 9th and 21st 
Division tactical areas of responsibility. Except for the five USAF 
T-28s at Soc Trang, there was a built-in delay of one and one-half hours 
in getting ground alert aircraft from Bien Hoe. Under these circumstances, 
the optimum tactical air support for Eagle flights would have been to 
have kept the division ALO and an ARVN G-3 air officer airborne in an 
0-1 aircraft during ARVN helicopter operations to serve as an air coordi-
nator and to bring in fighters from air alert stations when required. 
Such a liaison aircraft capability did not exist: the VNAF 112th Squadron 
kept a detachment of five 0-ls at Can Tho, but these aircraft were limited 
to FAO target-marking duty. The USAF ALOs begged rides on Army liaison 
planes where possible but more commonly were grounded at the division 
command post with no more knowledge of the air situation over an objective 
area than was provided by the US Army liaison communication relay plane, 
which maintained cover over heliborne landing areas. (110) The amount of 
tactical strike effort available to the IV ASOC was also very limited: 
during March only 71 of 126 air support requests of the 9th Division 
could be honored, and in April only 64 of 148 requests were approved. 
One of the major ALO/FAC functions was reported to be that of keeping 
ARVN officers from becoming discouraged with limited air support. (ill) 
In view of limited availability of strike aircraft, the TV ASOC 
followed a practice of providing as much cover as possible in the vicinity 
of heliborne operations (generally two fighters on two-hour air alert 
stations) and of responding strongly only when the Eagle flights or rapid 
response forces encountered significant opposition. In the words of the 
IV CTZ ALO, Lt Colonel Clarence R. Osburne, the situation virtually 
conceded immediate air support to armed HU-1B helicopters, who frequently 
"saved the day" whereas a flight of heavily armed tactical fighters might 
have "made the day."(112) On 12 April, when the Vietcong destroyed Kien 
Long district town in Chuong Thien province, VNAF turned in an outstanding 
performance, including a A-1H hit on a Vietcong 105-mm howitzer before 
dawn and almost continuous air support strikes throughout the daylight 
hours. The TACS made it possible to muster 30-45 air strike sorties at 
Kien Long, but this was all that could be provided from the Bien Hoa 
resources, and it was insufficient to prevent a serious government 
defeat. (113) 
Following the arrival of Generals Westmoreland and Moore in Saigon, 
Admiral Felt had understood that General Harkins would establish a MACV 
ad hoc committee to examine the directives regarding overall coordination

SECRET 
of the air effort. Instead, Harkins decided that Westmoreland and Moore would 
look over the situation and make suggestions for changes.(114) One needed 
change was almost immediately obvious. The US Army senior corps advisor at 
the III CTZ had long been a notorious partisan of Army aviation. He did not 
invite the USAF corps ALO to attend OTZ air planning conferences, and, as a 
matter of fact, was not on speaking terms with him. The III CTZ Army advisors 
had prepared pacification plans which included no reference to the employment 
of tactical air support, and, when General Moore sent his plans chief to offer 
help in rewriting the plans, the Army senior advisor refused to accept the 
assistance because he said the plans were satisfactory. After Moore mentioned 
this to Westmoreland, a MACV directive was issued on 16 March requiring that 
province pacification plans prepared by the CTZs would include an air opera-
tions annex to be provided by USAF advisory personne1.(115) At the III CTZ 
headquarters, the US Army senior advisor now carefully called the ALO to all 
briefings and planning conferences. Moreover, when the incumbent US Army senior 
advisor completed his tour in May, he would not be extended but would be 
rotated to the United States.(116) 
Early in March, Westmoreland and Moore visited each of the ARVN corps and 
division headquarters, and Moore returned from the field trip with a feeling 
that the significance of the two separate control systems for VNAF-USAF tactical 
aircraft and the US Army aircraft had been exaggerated. In the USAF view the 
existence of the separate control systems caused ARVN commanders to receive 
conflicting advice about air support and also prevented fullest development 
and utilization of the TACS. Moore, however, was confident that there could 
be cooperation between the systems and remarked: "The Army is just as strongly 
opposed to Air Force control of its aircraft as we are for the Army to control 
ours."(117) On the other hand, Moore favored proposals to expand the TAGS 
by the addition of a USAF-manned and operated air request communications net 
similar to the US Strike Command-Tactical Air Command air request system that . 
had been worked out in maneuvers in tie United States. These nets would 
eliminate the long delays encountered in passing air requests up through channels 
over ARVN communications. To be known as the "VNAF Air Request Net," the USAF 
operated system could most feasibly be initially established in the III CTZ 
and 7th Division area, since forces there were most actively engaged in combat, 
and, if the initial net was accepted by the RVNAF, it could be expanded to 
other CTZs.(118) 
The Westmoreland-Moore field visit also brought out the circumstances 
that air advisors were numerically scarce among ARVN units. The 2d Air 
Division had a manpower authority for 17 lieutenant colonels as ALOs with 
ARVN corps and divisions and for 32 captains/lieutenants as air-advisor 
FACs with ARVN regiments. These numbers were very small when compared 
with US Army advisors -- up to 500 in a CTZ, with assignments down to company 
levels. The 2d Air Division had never been authorized an air liaison 
officer on the top-level RVNAF Joint General Staff, and the lieutenant 
colonel AIOs with the corps and divisions were out-ranked by US Army 
colonel-rank advisors. In forward planning, the 2d Air Division had 
kept the rank of advisory personnel as low as practicable to avoid dwarfing 
relatively low-ranking VNAF counterparts, and it expected that VNAF would 
begin to assign Vietnamese air officers as ALOs as soon as it had 
enough officers. In January 1964, Colonel Ky understood the require-
ment for the Vietnamese ALOs and promised to assign 15 new pilots

to the duty as soon as they completed TC-1D flight training. In view of 
Admiral Felt's admonition that ARVN needed better air advice, the Thirteenth 
Air Force recommended on 21 January that a senior USAF colonel should be 
assigned to the aas and that the rank of USAF corps ALOs should be increased 
to colonel, thus giving these officers equal prestigeto the Ugt Army senior 
corps advisors. (119) 
General Moore's plans for the VNAF Air Request System also provided a 
means to increase USAF air advice at lower ARVN levels since a USAF pilot 
FAC and two radio operators would man tactical air control parties (TACPs) 
allocated for service at commind levels down to battalion. All TACPs would 
process requests for air support and provide advice to ARVN commanders, and 
those at battalions and regimental levels would be expected to direct close 
air support strikes. In order to man the countrywide VNAF Air Request Sys-
tem the 2d Air Division's authority for FACs would have to be increased to 
58 officers, but a part of these could be secured by drawing upon pilots 
fram the USAF 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron, which, despite efforts 
to keep it. remained slated for inactivation in mid-1964. Although VNAF 
airborne FAr:s would still bp readd to mark more remote and hard-to-find 
interdiction targets, Moore was persuaded that the old restriction that 
VNAF FACs must mark all air targets ,ould be relaxed since he saw no 
reason why with improved communications the USAF FACs, US Army liaison 
pilots, and US Army and ARVN forward air guides could not be used to 
designate air targets in close air support work. (120) 
On 15 April General Moore presented a package plan for improving VNAF 
responsiveness to General Harkins, with specific recommendations including 
the establishment of the VNAF Air Request System, training and assignment 
of VNAF ALO/FACs down to battalion levels as soon as possible (initially 
as counterparts to and eventually to replace USAF ALO/FACs), and assign-
ment of a USAF liaison officer to tha JGS, as wel1 as expansion Of VNAF 
representation in the JGS-JOC. un i5 and. 16 April, Moore met with General 
Harkins and with General Wheel-ar -,7',;3 then in Saigon and ,1g-;In presented 
both the plan for increasing VNAF raspcnivsne:.5"and the requiremant fc)r two 
additional squadrons of USAF A-1E aircraft. After same questioning, 
Wheeler agreed to support the aiditional requirement for USAF A.-1Es 
upon his return to Washington, and both Wheeler and Harkins readily sup-
ported the package plan for improving VNAF responsiveness. On 17 April 
Harkins requested the RVNAF to take necessary actions to put the plan 
into effect. Authority was included for a USAF colonel advisor to the 
Jas-Joc in the revised MACV JTD, and General Moore was authorized to use 
PACAF resources to establishthe VNAF Air Request Net in the III CTZ and 
7th Division area without delay. General Wheeler's trip report was con-
sidered in Washington on 28 April at a meeting of the Secretary of Defense 
with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Secretary McNamara at this time directed_ 
that the VNAF Air Request Net would be established not only in-the III CTZ 
but in all CTZs as quickly as possible, and be authorized USAF to deploy 
combat-ready TACPs from the Tactical Air Command on temporary duty pending 
procurement of personnel and eauiament for assignment to the 2d Air Division. (121)

In the expansion of the air advisory force, PACAF thought it important 
that the rank of the corps ALOs be increased to colonel, but, when Moore 
so recommended, Westmoreland said that it would be unacceptable since the 
US Army senior advisors in the CTZs would continue to be the MACV senior 
advisors and would be responsible for advising corps commanders on all 
military matters, including employment of airpower. The USAF corps ALO 
would be expected to advise the MACV senior advisor, and Westmoreland 
assured Moore that the USAF lieutenant colonel ALOs would be used to the 
fullest extent. At this juncture, Ky announced that his VNAF wing com-
manders would be the chief air advisors to the CTZ commanders, and General 
Moore acceded to Westmorelandls demand that the USAF corps ALO would be 
subordinate to the US Army senior corps advisor. (122) 
When General Moore had been preparing to go to his new assignment 
in Saigon, General LeMay had instructed him to recommend improvements 
in aircraft in South Vietnam as soon as he had been on the job long enough 
to form an opinion. On 7 April, with planning for the improved VNAF Air 
Request System nearing fruition, the retirement of the B-26s already a 
fact, the T-28s in trouble, and Secretary McNamara opposed to a B-57 
squadron in South Vietnam, Moore wrote LeMay that the A-1E was the most 
preferable aircraft for USAF operations and that three squadrons, each 
with 25 unit equipment A-lEs, would be required for assignment to the 34th 
Tactical Group. This number of squadrons included the already assigned 
let Air Commando Squadron whose B-26s and T-28s were to be replaced with 
A-IHs, the second squadron recommended by canusmAcv and CINCPAC as 
required to permit standard four-ship fighter formations in deference 
to hostile ground defenses, and a third A-1H squadron not previously 
recommended, which Moore justified on the basis of predictable increases 
in air strike requirements that would: be generated by the more efficient 
VNAF Air Request System which would be maturing early in 1965, when the 
squadron could be based at the new Can Tho airfield under a)nstruction 
in the Mekong Delta. (123) In conversations with General Wheeler on 15-16 
April, Moore did not denigrate VNAF progress but pointed out the require-
ment for the three USAF A-1H squadrons in terms of the professional re-
quirement to respond quickly to on-call air support missions and to set 
a proper example for Vietnamese airmen. As provided to the Joint Chiefs 
and Secretary McNamara, Wheeler's trip report described VNAF activity and 
motivation as being low and recommended the three USAF .AIH squadrons. (124) 
General Moore's major problem in justifying the requirement for three 
squadrons of USAF A-1Es in addition to three squadrons of VNAF A-1Hs was 
the lack of hard statistics. A study prepared by the 2d Air Division 
Operations Analyst, Richard T. Sandborn, nevertheless demonstrated that 50 
A-lEs and 75 A-1Hs would generate a total combat sortie potential of 3038 
per month, this figured on the basis that the sortie potential for the 
A-1E and A-1H would be 30 and 25 sorties per aircraft per month respec-
tively and that 10 percent of the sorties generated would be required 
for training. Based upon an extrapolation of the rising number of air 
support requests being received as well as the requirement for larger 
aircraft flights, Sandborn computed that the combat sortie requirement 
would be 4476 sorties by August 1964 and would increase after this. (125) 
At the Thirteenth Air Force, General Sam Maddux pointed out that demands

for a third USAF A-1E squadron might result in the end of the retention of 
the B-57s at Clark. In any event, the A-1E squadron could not be accanmodated 
in South Vietnam until Cm Tho airfield was completed early in 1965, and he 
saw no need to make an issue about the third squadron at such an early time. 
From Washington, however, General William H. Blanchard, USAF Vice Chief of 
Staff, stated that the Air Force could support the third squadron and was 
making plans for it to reach full equipment at the new Can Tho airfield by 
March 1964. On 27 April, PACAF recommended to Admiral Felt that the third 
USAF A-1E squadron be introduced into South Vietnam. (126) 
Although General Wheeler justified the USAF A-1E expansion on the grounds 
that VNAF's effectiveness was law, this justification provided a reverse 
implication that increased USAF capability would delay the development of 
VNAF self-sufficiency, thereby undermining the principle that US advisors 
were expected to prepare the RVNAF for combat rather than engage in combat 
themselves. Two events in March and April revealed that the rule limiting 
USAF advisors from engaging in combat was being strained if not violated. 
On 8 March Colonel Thomas M. Hergert, the Deputy Chief, Air Force Station, 
MAAG, was killed when the VNAF A-1H in which he was flying wing to a 
Vietnamese pilot on an interdiction mission was shot down by ground fire 
east of Tay Ninh. As a MAAG advisor, Colonel Hergert was within the para-
meters of training, but he became the 26th USAF.Combat death in Vietnam 
since January 1962.(127) On 21 April, however, a series of letters written 
home by Captain Shank before his death in combat on 24 March, became avail-
able to US Congressmen and soon were printed in the public press. The Shank 
letters were critical of the serviceability of USAF aircraft in South Vietnam 
and further revealed that the 1st Air Commando Squadron pilots were flying 
combat accompanied by Vietnamese basic airmen (popularly known as "sandbags") 
who were made available solely to meet the restriction that a Vietnamese 
crewman must be a member of an air commando crew. With the appearance of 
the Shank letters, General Moore recommended that the arbitrary restriction 
that a Vietnamese be aboard USAF strike aircraft should be eliminated since 
the non-rated airmen in no way contributed to the success of air commando 
missions which were normally only flown to augment VNAF and perform tasks 
which VNAF pilots were incapable of accomp1ishing.(128) PACAF further 
demonstrated that VNAF was programmed for pilots on the basis of 1.5 pilots 
to each VNAF cockpit, thus diversion of 50 to 75 pilots to flying with the 
USAF A-lEs would seriously degrade VNAF sorties. If legitimate VNAF ob-
servers were assigned to flying with the USAF A-lEs, the VNAF liaison/FAC 
program would be bankrupt. (129) 
At their meeting with Secretary McNamara on 29 April, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff recommended that the USAF A-1Es in Vietnam be increased 
to 50 aircraft and two squadrons in order to meet the requirement stated 
by COMUSMACV and CINCPAC. The Joint Chiefs also advised Secretary 
McNamara that they concurred in the recommendations of General Wheeler's 
report, one of which proposed the third USAF A-1E squadron. After dis-
cussion with General Taylor on 5 May, Secretary McNamara approved the 
increase of USAF strength to 50 A-1Es and two squarlrons.(130) In Hawaii 
Admiral Felt's PACFOM staff was reportedly "cool" to the requirement 
for a third USAF A-1E squariron on the ground that it would delay VNAF 
self sufficiency, but on 8 May Felt recommended that the Joint Chiefs

of Staff authorize USAF to form the third squadron for possible deploy-
ment to South Vietnam in 1965. In regard to the fate of the B-57s at 
Clark, Felt accepted General Smart's suggestion that they held for 
possible contingency employment and recommended to the Joint Chiefs that 
these B-57. squadrons would be an "ace in the hole. "(131) As has been 
seen, the B-57s would be retained for potential employment in CINCFAC 34A 
operations, but the matter of the third USAF A-1E squadron and the whole 
VNAF program was one of the principal subjects of discussion when 
Secretary McNamara and General Taylor visited Saigon on 11-13 May. 
At the outset of the Secretary of Defense conferences in Saigon on 
11-13 May, General Harkins' forecast of the likely trend of Vietcong 
activity during the remainder of the year envisioned continued incidents 
but no large scale unit activity. This prediction lacked a sense of 
urgency and had a bearing upon subsequent discussions of air require-
ments. In these discussions, General Taylor stated that the justifi-
cation by extrapolation of a third USAF A-1E squadron simply would not 
sell in Washington, and the introduction of the subject of VNAF require-
ments branched into a considerable discussion of the Shank letters, in 
the course of which Secretary McNamara reiterated that US forces were not 
in South Vietnam to take part in combat. He directed General Moore to 
get the VNAF trained so that it could do everything itself, and to this 
end he ordered that the VNAF pilot ratio for fighter aircraft would be 
increased from 1.5 to 2 per aircraft and that the VNAF 716th Reconnaissance 
Squadron would be equipped with 25 11.-IHs by 1 October 1964 and converted 
into a fourth Vietnamese fighter squadron, this in lieu of a commitment of 
a third USAF A-1E squadron. (132) 
In a planeside news interview a.Washington following his return from 
Saigon, Secretary McNamara emphasized that USAF-personnel were in Vietnam 
training the VNAF to fight an "anti-guerrilla war. "(133) Within OSD 
Secretary McNamara let it be known that he firmly intended that USAF 
Farm Gate strike operations would phase down and preferably be out of 
South Vietnam in approximately 120 dAys.(134) And on 20 May, General 
Taylor messaged new JCS rules of engagement to Admiral Felt, reaffirming 
the policy of the US government that US military personnel would not take 
part in combat. The ultimate objective was to remove USAF Farm Gate air-
'craft from combat, and continued use of the Farm Gate aircraft was autho-
rized only under the condition that "they fly bona fide operational 
training missions against hostile targets to prepare the participating 
VNAF personnel for eventual replacement of US pilots." The new rules 
recognized that US Army helicopter operations would continue to introduce 
US personnel into combat situations, but they stated: "It is emphasized 
that helicopters are for use as transport and that their weapons are for 
the protection of vehicles and passengers. Armed helicopters will not be 
used as a substitute for close air support strikes. "(135) 
At almost the same time that General Wheeler's criticism of VNAF was 
being considered in Washington, General Smart happened to be at Bien Hoa 
Air Base on 25 April when, under Ey's direction, 17 A-1Hs were combat loaded

and deployed to Da Nang on an unannounced mission that proved to be the 
beginning of Operation Quebec Tango 202, the name given to the air phase 
of Operation Quyet Thanh 202, a II CTZ seven-battalion search-and-clear 
helfborne operation against the Vietcong 5th Military Region Command 
which had reestablished in the old Do-Xa area of northwestern Quang Ngai 
province. In support of Quyet Thanh 202 from 27 April through 31 May, 
VNAF provided 266 L-19/L-20 sorties, 429 A-1H/T-28 sorties, and 102 R-34 
sorties, the helicopter sorties including psywar, aeromedical evacuation, 
resupply, and aerial crop destruction spray missions. In addition to a 
daily average of 10 A-1Hs available at Da Nang for the operation, the VNAF 
516th Squadron kept 5 T-28s deployed at Quang Ngai airfield, where they 
managed quick reactions to immediate air support requirements. The initial 
secrecy with which the operation wa8 mounted evidently caught the Vietcong 
by surprise, resulting in capture and destruction of the largest accumula-
tion of automatic weapons to that date in the war. The 5th Region installa-
tions were again broken up, but as the operation terminated it was not 
possible to leave behind three CIO 3 strike companies as had been planned, 
since enemy forces had been scattered but not destroyed. The well-coordi-
nated employment of combat aviation gave Ganeral nart confidence that 
VNAF effectiveness was markedly increasing, and when the DoXa bases were 
broken up General Westmoreland induced the Vietnamese to move the 25th 
Division (less one of its regiments) south from Quang Ngai to Hau Nghia 
province, immediately west of Saigon, where the Vietcong almost had 
complete control. (136) 
Although Quyet Thanh 202 increased VNAF prestige, the month-long 
operation consumed almost one-half of the combat sorties generated by 
the Vietnamese during May, and, in addition, VNAF and USAF aircraft 
conversions were begun in this month, with a reduction of VRAF capabilities. 
The USAF 1st Air Commando Squadron had already borrowed 9 of the VNAF 
516th Souadron's T-28s, and the 516th sent a first increment of T-28 pilot3 
to Bien Hoa, where the Pacific Fleet's Naval Air Squadron VA-152 began a 
A-1 transition training course on i May. Although the 516th pilots were 
experienced in flying the light T-28s, the larger A-1Hs had considerably 
more torque and a tail wheel rather than the tricycle landing gear to 
which the 516th pilots were accustomed. One of the A-1Hs used for transi-
tion was washed out by a Vietnamese in attempted takeoff and several others 
were run off the runways in taxi accidents. During May the 516th received 
10 A-1Hs from MAP deliveries; these planes sat on the ramps at Da Nang, 
but the VNAF 41st Wing maintenance squadron had difficulty with the un-
familiar aircraft, with the result that the in-commission rate on the 
planes averaged only 4 to 5 daily and sometimes dropped to 3.(137) At 
Bien Hoa the 1st Air Commando Squadron remained operational with borrowed 
T-28s, but the squadron lost another T-28 in a non-fatal takeoff accident 
on 1 May, and on 20 May six of the T-28s it was operating were hurriedly 
transferred to combat in Laos, leaving only eight aircraft on hand. (138) 
Chiefly as a result of the declining T-28 capabilities, VNAF-USAF combat 
sorties flown declined in May at the same time that the number of requests 
for air support was increasing.

In mid-May air planners in Saigon followed Secretary McNamara 's 
guidance literally in developing a plan for expansion of VNAF fighter 
pilot capabilities to a level of two pilotsfor each plane, the expansion 
of the VNAF fighter force to four A-1H Squadrons with additional recom-
mendations as to the number of VNAF fighter squadrons that would be 
required to get the USAF air commando aircraft withdrawn from combat as 
early as possible. The McNamara guidance included conversion of the VNAF 
tactical reconnaissance squadron into a fourth fighter squadron by October, 
and authorized the use of all VietnaMese pilots -- including air transport 
pilots -- to fly fighters. As the crash plan to accomplish the McNamara 
program was nearing completion it was affected by the JCS rule of 20 May 
that USAF strike aircraft would not be employed in combat unless they 
were providing bona fide operational training to participating VNAF 
personnel. This restriction portended a marked reduction of USAF combat 
capabilities at a time that in-coumry air resources were already inadequate 
to meet requirements and when VNAF would be building two new A-1H squadrons. 
In recognition of the immediate emergency, MACV ruled that the 1st Air 
Commando Squadron could continue to Operate its eight T-28s with 
Vietnamese crewmen who were not necessarily pilot potential, but that 
as soon as A-1Es were received in sufficieninumber the T-28s would be 
withdrawn from use and A-1E combat operations would be strictly limited 
to bona fide training. (139) 
The VNAF fighter plan was approved and forwarded by MACV on 28 May 
and represented a crash program to accomplish Secretary McNamara's di-
rectives in the shortest possible time. The plan placed primary emphasis 
on manning the three existing VNAF fighter squadrons with two pilots per 
plane by 1 October and the organization and manning of three additional 
VNAF fighter squadrons as soon as MAP aircraft could be provided but de-
sirably by 15 February 1965. All Vietnamese pilot resources would be 
drawn upon, and in the accelerated pilot training program the 34th Group 
would provide an initial two-week Phase I indoctrination course, VA-152 
would provide a five-week Phase II transition course, and the 34th Group 
would provide a Phase III operational training course. The initial Phase 
I indoctrination was justifiable because of the difficulties that VA-152 
was having getting the Vietnamese pilots ready for solo flights in the 
single-seat A-1Hs.(140) Admiral Felt considered that it would be essential 
to keep the USAF air commando A-1Es in operation while VNAF was under ex-
pansion and accordingly validated the Phased training program,(141) but the 
ultimate VNAF fighter program remained under consideration for the next 
several months. During a Secretary of Defense-Joint Chiefs of Staff 
meeting on 8 June, Secretary McNamara provided the additional guidance 
that the first four VNAF squadrons would receive emphasis and the fifth 
and sixth secondary consideration. On 17 June Admiral Felt accepted a 
PACAF evaluation and reported to the Joint Chiefs that the MACV plan tried 
to do too much too soon, would place too much priority on training with a 
degradation of combat capabilities, and in any event could not be supported 
by projected MAP A-IH deliveries. Felt recommended that the VNAF 516th 
Squadron be brought to full strength in September, and that the new 520th

Squadron be organized at this time and made operational at the new Can 
Tho airfield by the end of 1964. Felt pointed out that with minor degrada-
tions sufficient VNAF personnel could be made available to man four fighter 
squadrons without inactivating the two VNAF C-47 transport squadrons. On 
24 July the Joint Chiefs of Staff accepted the four-squadron projection, 
three of the VNAF squadrons of A-1H aircraft to be combat ready by 30 
September and the fourth by December 1964, all with a two-to-one pilot-to-
cockpit ratio. In addition to this action, the Joint Chiefs would continue 
studies regarding the eventual VNAF fighter squadron program.(142) 
When Lt Colonel John Porter, commander of the 1st Air Commando Squadron, 
led the first flight of six A-lEs to Bien Hoa from the Philippines on 30 
May, Colonel Preston noted that the 34th Tactical Group "moved up into the 
big league of COIN warfare circles with a first line aircraft." The full 
VNAF pilot training program would not begin until July, but 12 Vietnamese 
1T-28 and C-47 pilots selected for A-1 training were at Bien Hoa, and the 
first strike sorties were flown by the A-lEs on 1 June. (1.43) In view of 
his experiences with the Farm Gate B-265 and T-28s, CoLonel Preston admitted 
that he would probably have been enthusiastic about any new aircraft, but 
Colonel William E. Bethea, who assumed command of the 34th Group on 16 
June, was equally impressed by the large and varied ordnance carrying 
capability of the A-1E, its ability to operate off a 4,000-foot runway 
with full ordnance, its extremely long range which translated into loiter-
ing capability; in short, all of these characteristics fitted for counter-
insurgency. On the other hand, the A:4E was very slow, and its normal 
cruising speed of 155 knots would retard rapid response to air support 
requests, especially in the far reaches of the Mekong delta. The A-1 also 
had little ability to defend itself in aerial combat. By the end of June, 
12 A-lEs had been received by the 1st Air Commando SquAriron, and on 30 June 
the USAF T-28s flew their last combat mission5 in Scuth Vietnam and were 
retired. At this time the 34th Group discontinued use of the Vietnamese 
airman basic "sandbag" observers, and began to participate in the phased 
transition training of VNAF pilots. (1141.) 
The arrival of the USAF A-lEs and additional VNAF A-1Hs during June 
did not compensate for the reduction in the number of T-28s available for 
combat missions. As shown in the following chart, VNAF-USAF combat 
sorties declined in May and were much lower during June:

The decline in combat sorties was accompanied by a steadily rising volume 
of requests for air support strike aircraft. Where the ASOCs received 
1,546 requests in the quarter year of-January-March, they received 2,040 
in the quarter year April-june, and in this second quarter 807 requests
could not be honored, including 668 not honored for lack of aircraft. (145) 
Through the spring of 1964 the inadequacy of tactical air resources 
was of overriding significance to the battle effort in South Vietnam, but 
there was nevertheless hope that STRICOM air request communications and 
expanded ALO/FACs at lower ANWN levels could provide a most effective 
utilization of scarce strike airpower. In April, Maj General Tran Thien 
Khiem, CBC RVNAF, readily agreed to the STRICOM-type system, and 4y 
promised to provide Vietnamese air officers to serve as ALOs. The 2d 
Air Division expanded its ALO/FACs for the initial undertaking in the 
III CTZ by drawing pilots from the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron; 
it also got an unexpected windfall of B-26 pilots for this duty when the 
light bombers were grounded. In April and May, 20 USAF ALO/FACs were 
assigned in the III CTZ and 7th Division areas, and VNAF made eight 
officers available as ALOs. PACAF rounded out the tactical air control 
parties by sending radio operators to man the TACP radios, the TACPs 
being Posted to the III ASOC, the division ALO posts, and at ARVN regi-
mental command posts. The system was counted operational on 15 May, and, 
according to the design of the request net, a TACP accompanying an ARVN 
battalion was able to flash an air support request directly to the III 
ASOC, while other TACPs at intermediate command posts monitored trans-
missions. If intermediate echelons did not object to an air request 
within five minutes, the request was supposed to be considered valid by the 
ASOC and the Corps TOC. The forward TACPs also possessed man-pack radios 
and were expected to be able to direot close air uupport strikes from the 
ground, thus being prepared to supplement the often unavailable target-
marking services of VNAF L-19 airborne EACs. (146)

In recognition of the fact that USAF communications between the 
ASOCs and AOC were far better than parallel US Army communications, 
General Westmoreland directed that the US Army Aviation Battalion Control 
Center which had been located in the JGS-JOC would move physically within 
the VNAF-USAF AOC, and this move commenced on 18 May. Under the MAOV 
reorganization, the US Army aviation control center became the Army 
Aviation Operations Section of J-3 MACV and although its command author-
ity was separate from the TACS, General Moore expected that the physical 
co-location of the AADS and the AOC would permit an increasing degree of 
planning and coordination of US Army, VNAF, and USAF air activities, an 
eventuality that did not materialize, as has been seen. (147) In the 
initial field deployment in the III CTZ, the single side band PRO-47 and 
KWM-28 radio sets which provided the backbone communications in the VNAF 
air request net met local operating problems, some produced. by the tropi-
cal environment and others probably attributable to unfamiliarity of the 
operators with the equipment. (148) These point-to-point communications 
problems were solvable, but the effectiveness of the VNAF Air Request 
System weo limited by the unwillingneos ef ARV N comnariders eo allow it 
to function according to its desian. The, RNA? JGS IA not selle 
expected mandatory directive for the empA.eynent of the VNAF Air Requet, 
System; ARVN unit commanders readily em4Jrized direct passing ef air 
reconnaissance requests over the system, but they refused to be by-passed 
where strike firepower was concerned. As a result, the VNAF Air Request 
Net served information purposes, but all official requests for air support 
continued to travel the time-consuming route over the old ARVN air request 
net.(149) 
The assignment of highly motivated USAF ALO/FACs to lower AWN command 
levels incident to the establishment of the VNAF Air Request System was 
very useful in providing guidance to AftIN commanders in the employment of 
tactical air support, but the ground. FAils In the forward TACPs were aen-
erally unable to replace the airborne PACs in controlling close support 
strikes. The RITNAF oas did not relax tho restriet.ich wereby etrike Lr 
craft, were forbidden to release ordnance in proximity -be ground forees 
except under control of a VNAF FAC. This rule led to a near tragedy on 
23 April, when USAF T-28s were over the position where the AWN 52d 
Rangers were trapped near Trung Lap. The T-28s had voice communications 
with US Amy L-19 and also with wounded American'advisors on the ground, 
but they were not permitted to use their ordnance. Fortunately, a platoon 
of armed US Army helicopters arrived, were fired upon, and thereupon 
countered the Vietcong threat, while the T-28s jettisoned their unused 
ordnance and returned to base.(150) Even if VNAF strike crews had been 
willing to accept targets from USAF ground FACs, there were other problems 
inherent to such employment. The USAF controllers could not communicate 
with Vietnamese pilots in the Vietnamese language- This might have been 
solved by assignment of VNAF ALO/FAC counterpartS, but the ALO/FAC duty 
was clearly unpopular among Vietnamese air officers, and Secretary 
McNamara's program objective of manning VNAF fighters with a 2t1 pilot ' 
to aircraft ratio severely limited the number and caliber of VNAF pilot& 
who could be assigned as ALO/FACs.(151) Finally, the human and natural

environment worked against ground TACPs. The initial TACP radio equipment 
was heavy and bulky, making it virtually impossible for a ground FAC to 
man-pack it through the jungles with ARVN foot soldiers. (1S2) The USAF 
ALO in the 7th Division additionally pointed out that it was impossible 
to direct an air strike safely from the ground because of the many civilians 
who milled around and could be seen only from the air. (1S3) Jungle and 
mountain terrain limited ground visibility, and in the delta FACs on the 
ground found it virtually impossible to determine the range to enemy firing 
positions because of the absence of elevated positions in the flat terrain 
and the numerous tree lines and canal ridges that obstructed the view. (154) 
In mid-1964 USAF ALO/FACs generally agreed that ground TALPs could not 
replace airborne control, but that effective air support demanded some-
thing better than the slow and plodding VNAF L-19s and often disinterested 
observers. (15) The optimum solution would be to provide the USAF ALO/FACs 
with 0-1 aircraft which would permit them to perform local liaison, recon-
naissance, and control functions. In May strong pleas were made to prevent 
the inactivation of the USAF 19th TAW, but Admiral Felt said he was unable 
to help in the matter and the squadron remained under orders to transfer 
its aircraft to VNAF and inactivate. (156) 
Like the buildup of VNAF air striking forces, the VNAF Air Request 
System held promise for the future, but in July 1964 neither the Vietnamese 
air capabilities nor the control procedures were appropriately prepared to 
withstand the resurgent Vietcong attacks, which made this the bloodiest 
thus far in the war. During July C-47 and C-123 flare support provided 
outposts and rural life villages more than doubled over the earlier months 
of 1964. The number of night combat fighter support sorties also increased. (l7) 
On the night of 6 July, however, the VNAF A-1H pilots at Da Nang were not 
qualified for night combat when the Oammunists attacked the Nam Dong 
Special Forces Camp near the DMZ. The I ASOC sent a flareship which re-
mained over the camp dropping flares until dawn, and at first light two 
A-1Hs and an 0-1A FAC were over the target but were not able to strike 
because the FAC could not establish radio contact with the camp. The 
aircraft remained in the area, and after about an hour an SDC company 
was contacted and the A-1Hs were directed against the withdrawing enemy. 
In this attack, the Communists partially overran the camp, killing 55 
South Vietnamese, two US Special Forces soldiers, and an Australian 
advisor. The delay in A-1H reaction was attributable to inability of 
516th Squadron pilots to fly at night, and the operating rule that for-
bade the 0-1 FAC from marking a target in close proximity to friendly 
forces without positive identification. (158) 
An even greater tragedy occurred on 21 July in Chuong Thien province. 
Here in a before dawn attack the Vietcong attacked the Xang Cut outpost,, 
while a hard core VC battalion and two local guerrilla companies estab-
lished carefully concealed ambush positions an both sides of the road 
which would be traveled by ARVN relief forces. A US Army observer flew 
over the camouflaged enemy without seeing them, and when the ARVN 1st 
Battalion, 31st Regiment entered the three-kilometer long ambuscade it 
was taken under fire with machine guns and mortars. The damage was done

within the hour required to get a VNAF FAC to the scene, and two VNAF 
A-1Hs on ground alert at Bien Hoa did not arrive for an hour and a half 
after the air support mission was requested. The ARVN battalion was 
virtually disintegrated, losing 41 KIA.and 56 WTA.(159) Captured enemy 
documents revealed that the Vietcong were disdainful of VNAF capabilities, 
and on the morning of 28 July the Vietcong attacked two hamlets and an 
SDC post immediately north of Ben Cat in Binh Duong province. A battalion 
of the ARVN 8th Regiment responded, lost a lead tank to 57-mm recoilless 
rifle fire, and broke apart under assault fram a two-battalion enemy 
force. In an initial air support strike four USAF A-1Es accepted targets 
from a US Army 0-1F pilot, but the VNAF A-1H pilots next on station 
refused to act without a VNAF FAC, even though the US Army liaison pilot 
was accompanied by an ARVN observer and marked enemy positions with smoke 
rockets. By the time that the VNAF FAC arrived, most of the Vietcong 
had faded away into the jungles. In their analysis of this battle, the 
US ALOs in the III CTZ saw no reason why any qualified observer, regard-
less of nationality or branch of service, should not be authorized to mark 
targets for strike aircraft. The VNAF Director of the III Af0C, Captain 
Nguyen Van Truong, suggested that the RVNAF had made the regul.F,tion on 
air strike control more rigid than advisable as a result of inadevertent 
strikes on friendly forces and suggested that the rules be liberali7ed to 
allow not only FACs but FAGs or any equivalent personnel in any branch of 
the Armed Forces to mark targets for airstrikes.(160) 
Within the 2d Air Division the outstanding lesson to be drawn from 
the Communist victories in mid-1964 involved the fact that the desire of 
many influential persons to characterize counterinsurgency as something 
distinctly different fram other states of armed conflict had resulted 
in the failure to develop adequate air firepower required to defeat the 
determined insurgent organization. (161) In order to obviate Communist 
ambushes like the one in Chuong Thien, the Deputy Director of the IV 
ASOC, Lt Colonel Pierce, stated a requirement to maintain a'7:7AF 3-1 
FAC and two flights of four fighters airborne over each delta province 
during daylight hours and to be able to back this f--;rce up with )10 to 50 
strike sorties within two hours. Although Pierce welcomed prospective 
improvement of inadequate control facilities he speculated that even 
with a 100 percent improvement of control facilities there would be no 
more than a 5 percent improvement in operations, since any significant 
improvement would have to come from increased tactical airpower.(162) 
The 2d Air Division also noted that small air strikes of two planes at 
occasional intervals against well-known Conmunist base areas were doing 
little more than to harass the Vietcong. It recommended that the civilian 
population should be notified to leave Vietcong havens and that large scale 
bombing should then commence against them. An ideal method of attack would 
be to utilize USAF tactical air strikes that could be flown from bases in 
Thailand, Okinawa, and the Philippines. With in-flight refueling, the 
USAF aircraft need not ever land in South Vietnam. (163) 
In mid-1964 General Westmoreland was also "deeply concerned" with 
the increasing numbers of successful Vietcong hamlet and outpost attacks 
and ambushes of ARVN troop units and convoys, and his basic approach to

the Communist challenge lay in an expansion of US forces into the 
Vietnamese provinces at district level, thus catalyzing Vietnamese 
para-military and lower level ARVN unite to a higher tempo of paci-
fication effort.(164) In April Westmoreland considered that the VNAF/ 
USAF reaction time to night hamlet and outpost attacks was too slow and 
he directed US Army advisors to prepare plans to maintain US Army armed 
helicopters, SOMB equipped with flares, on night alerts at provincial 
headquarters, prepared to scramble in immediate support of hamlets and 
outposts.(165) Both as a result of the discussions of offensive employ-
ments of Special Forces in border surveillance and also because the 
Communists had begun battalion size attacks against Special Force camps, 
Westmoreland requested that the US Army Special Forces Vietnam be increased 
in strength and transferred an permanent change of station. He also asked 
on 16 July that he be provided one helicopter oampany in direct support of 
each AWN division, plus additional armed helicopter air mobile companies 
and platoons. (166) In order to bring Communist ambushes under control, 
Westmoreland directed US Army advisors to impress their Vietnamese counter-
parts with the necessity for detailed priorplanning for operations and 
troop movements, the main thrust of the directive pointing out that once 
the Vietcong elected to stage an ambush they were fixed in position where 
"air and artillery can really pay off." Westmoreland also asked the JGS 
to provide for fast and effective reaction to Vietcong attacks by heliborne 
alert forces, this by designation of one company per division as an alert 
reaction force, assignment of a helicopter unit in direct support of each 
division, detailed planning to insure fast mounting of an effective hell-
borne attack with necessary air support, and provision for fast reinforce-
ment of division alert forces by corps and general reserve alert forces. (167) 
Following the Chuong Thien ambush, General Westmoreland instructed 
General Moore and Brig General Delk N. Oden, Commanding General, US Amy 
Support Command Vietnam, to find ways and means to increase the integration 
and effectiveness of the total US air capability in support of troop move-
ments, convoys, and reaction forces. On 1 August, Moore and Oden published 
a formal agreement, which Westmoreland considered to be "excellent." The 
agreements reached by Moore and Oden were incorporated in substance in 
MACV Directive No. 95-4, Aviation/Air Operations in RVN, issued on 1 
August. In organizational arrangements, the co-location of separate US 
Army/US Marine Corps and NAF/USAF control agencies would be expected to 
improve coordination; the Army Aviations Operations Section and the 
VNAF/USAF Air Operations Center were already together, and the US Army/US 
Marine Aviation Elements at the CTZ headquarters were to be similarly 
co-located with the ASOCs. Both ASOCs and Aviation Elements were to be 
responsive to the CTZ Tactical Operations Center, VNAF/USAF aircraft 
being allocated to the ASOC by the AOC and US Army and UC aircraft 
being assigned to the operational control of the US Army senior corps 
advisor. Joint and combined preplanning would be conducted at least 
daily. Ground reaction forces would not narmallyrmove without air support. 
On many occasions, armed helicopters would engage and fix the enemy until 
the arrival of more heavily armed fighters, and, in the event fighter air-
craft were not available in sufficient numbers, additional armed helicopters 
would be employed. Armed helicopter targets would be identified by the 
ground commander; strike aircraft would normally be directed by a FAC (either

airborne or on the ground, and of any service provided appropriate communica-
tions were established) but in an emergency a ground commander could assume the 
responsibility for designating the target to the strike aircraft by any avail-
able means.(168) 
As viewed at higher Air Farce staff levels in PACAF and USAF the Moore-Oden 
agreement was perhaps useful as an interim-measure necessitated by particular-
ized conditions in South Vietnam, but it nevertheless differed in many important 
respects from proven tactical air doctrine that had been developed and tested 
over many years. The agreement perpetuated two separate USAF and US Army 
aviation control systems, and the coequal situation of the USAF ALO/ASOC and 
the US Army/Marine Aviation Element under the Corps TOC resulted in a condition 
whereby a corps commander could receive conflicting advice on the employment 
of airpower. While the VNAF-USAF AOC retained nominally central control over 
all tactical air effort and the VNAF and USAF air commanders could withdraw air 
resources for special missions, routine day-to-day operational control of 
tactical aircraft in the I and II CTZs were in the hands of the ASOCs. On 
repeated occasions, General LeMay had insisted that there was no valid require-
ment for armed helicopters in Vietnam because fixed-wing aircraft ought to perform 
the function more effectively, but the Moore-Oden agreement recognized a com-
plementary requirement for both armed helicopters and tactical support 
aircraft.(169) Where the new arrangements were viewed with skepticism 
in USAF, the VNAF had always been sensitive to the likelihood that it might 
inadvertently attack friendly people and refused to accept the new arrange-
ment whereby persons other than professional VNAF FACs were authorized to 
mark targets for fighter strikes.(170) 
Although General Moore and his Deputy Commander, Colonel Allison C. 
Brooks, recognized that some persons believed that the 2d Air Division 
was being "hoodwinked" in the roles and mission agreements, both were 
inclined to balance theory against practicality. .Since MACV and the 
Vietnamese High Command were dominated by Army officers, Moore remarked 
that it was "to be expected that an Army atmosphere in plans, operations 
and support will generally prevail." Both Moore and Brooks noted that 
US Army helicopter pilots wanted all the tactical air support they could 
get, and they agreed that in the existing environment -- with no enemy 
counterair and spotty ground defenses -- the armed helicopters performed 
useful purposes, chiefly in that the immediacy with which an armed heli-
copter could return ground fire tended to compensate for inaccuracy and 
relatively light weight of the helicopter firepower. The advantages of 
helicopters would likely be reduced when the enemy introduced more 50-
caliber and 40-mm. weapons. As a knowledgeable tactical air officer, 
Brooks judged that the USAF concept of centralized control of all air 
resources was "fundamental and sound," but he pointed out that the rela-
tively slow A-1 aircraft available in Vietnam could not be moved rapidly 
from one base to another and that it was well that they be dispersed 
geographically into the areas where battles occurred. The allocation of 
aircraft to ALO/ASOCs gave these air officers bargaining powers in daily 
planning conferences, which had not been the case when they had not had 
aircraft that they could commdt without approval of the AOC. The air

principle of centralized control and the planes could be shifted when and ?

L. American Responses to Hanoi's Summer Crisis in Laos 
The Communist rulers of North Vietnam regarded themselves as the 
natural heirs of the French colonials in Indochina and held to the long 
term objective of establishing hegnmopy over Laos. In the immediate 
Communist strategic scenario in 1964, however, Laos was important because 
the panhandle provided infiltration routes to South Vietnam and also out-
flanked RVNAF defenses at the DMZ. In addition, North Vietnam's General 
Vo Nguyen Giap would continue to recall the politico-military victory at 
Dien Bien Phu, when the key-military battle had coincided with international 
negotiations in progress in Geneva, and had broken French resolve. In 1964 
Giap still pursued the Dien Bien Phu syndrome: thus military attacks against 
Prime Minister Souvanna Phoumais weak defenses in neutralized Laos were cal-
culated to yield a reassembled international conference on Laos, which would 
be in session at the time of morale-sapping Communist victories inside South 
Vietnam. 
Despite creeping Communist aggression, US policy in Laos in 1962-63 
sought to stabilize Lao neutrality, if possible within the framework of 
the 1962 Geneva settlement. At the request of Souvanna Phouma the United 
States had provided six T-28 aircraft to replace worn out T-6s, and 12 
RLAF pilots had received transition training in Thailand. By:November 1963 
two of the T-28s had been lost and the remaining aircraft did not permit the 
RLAF to maintain sufficient pilots in combat-ready status to handle addi-
tional planes that would need to be provided in an emergency. On 2 
November 1963, moreover, a long-held key Meo position in northeastern Laos 
fell to an unprovoked Pathet Lao attack, and US Ambassador Leonard Unger 
in Vientiane informed Secretary Rusk that other cases of creeping aggression 
were likely to follow. On 9 November, Secretary Rusk established a require-
ment for air action against repeated Pathet Lao-North Vietnamese tactics 
and indicated a need to train Lao forces for air-ground operations. (172) 
Initial State-Defense proposals in Washington conceived that Thailand 
would be prepared to provide Laos with the T-28s required to maintain com-
bat readiness, but the Royal Thai Air Force was reluctant to give up air-
craft, and the US Air Attache and US.EMbassy in Bangkok instead proposed 
that a USAF 1st Air Commando Wing T-28 detachment should be stationed at 
Udorn in northeastern Thailand where it would assist the RTAF, train RLAF 
pilots, and be prepared to augment the Lao air force in an emergency, 
either by transferring aircraft to it or by covertly participating in 
combat.(173) PACAF strongly supported the deployment of the Special Air 
Warfare detachment, and Admiral Felt recommended it to Washington on 7 
December. (174) The Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended the deployment to 
Secretary McNamara on 30 December, and Admiral Felt made interim arrange-
ments whereby Thailand provided the ALAF with two attrition T-28s on 21 
February 1964 in return for an agreement that the aircraft would be shortly

replaced by the United States.(175) From the first discussion of the 
deployment of the SAW detachment to Udorn, PACAF conceived that the de-
tachments mission would be operational (with training as a cover) and 
that, while the detachment would be responsive to Ambassador Unger's 
requirements, it would be under the operational control of COMUSMACV-
THAI, exercised through the Canmander 2d Air Division.(176) After 
Thailand provided diplomatic clearances, the Secretary of Defense on 
9 March authorized deployment of the SAW detachment. The USAF Special 
Air Warfare Center promptly organized Detachment 6, 1st Air Commando 
Wing, with a strength of 41 personnel and four T-28s and under command 
of Major Drexel B. Cochran. Nicknamed "Water Pump," Detachment 6 began 
departing Hurlburt AFB on 16 March. Its T-28s were airlifted by C-124s 
to Tan Son Nhut where they were reassembled and flown to Udorn. Water 
Pump became operationally ready at Udorn on 1 April. (177) 
While the high-level decisions were being made about Water Pump, the 
Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese increased the creeping military pressure 
against Royal Lao and Neutralist forces on the Plain of Jars on 23 January. 
The Communists were also building up for more substantial attacks. Ambassador 
Unger had earlier opposed the use of bombs on Lao aircraft and favored 
keeping the conflict in Laos at "low emphasis," but on 3-4 March he queried 
Washington about the feasibility of relaxing restraints on the employment 
of the six Lao T-28s so that "defensive operations" would be interpreted 
to include reprisal for aggressive enemy actions and also interdiction of 
a build-up for attack. At this same juncture, the US Embassy in Bangkok re-
ported that Thai morale was slipping because of lack of responses to the 
Communist moves in Laos. On 9 March, Admiral Felt was authorized to send 
USAF F-100s stationed in Thailand on obtrusive show of force flights up to, 
but not across, the Lao border. On 11 March, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
agreed that restrictions imposed on the Lao T-28s should be relaxed but 
felt that the six aircraft inherently could not play a major role. They 
specifically recommended that restrictions on bombs and napalm should be 
removed and that the first priority for attack should be Communist convoys 
in-bound into Laos. They suggested that US aerial reconnaissance could be 
flown and that consideration should be given to the use of American and 
third country air forces to provide air support in Laos. On 20 March the 
State Department advised Unger that a limited number of bomb fuzes could 
be released to the RLAF, but the other JOS proposals remained under State 
Department study. (178) 
In Vientiane a coalition of frustrated Rightists, headed by Generals 
Siho and Kouprasith, launched a COW) against Souvanna Phouma on 19 April. 
The United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, are France promptly pro-
tested the coup, and, on 23 April, Souvanna merged Neutralists and 
Rightists in a new Lao government. While these actions were in progress, 
the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese launched heavy attacks, which by 17

Souvanna Phouma, Unger released the first batch of bomb fuzes to the Lao 
air force on 17 May, and the T-28s went to work. On direction from Admiral 
Felt the four Water Pump T-284 at UdOrn were painted with Lao markings 
and turned over to the RLAF on 18 May, giving it a total of seven combat,. 
ready aircraft. Earlier in the month Ambassador Unger did not want US 
air reconnaissance over Laos, but on 18 May the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
directed that Able Mable RF-101s would fly during the daylight hours of 
the following day low-level photo reconnaissance over the Lao panhandle 
routes leading into South Vietnam. While these flights were in progress 
on 19 May, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed an immediate movement of 
10 T-28s (6 T-28s and 4 RT-28s) from South Vietnam to Udorn, and, on the 
same day in Vientiane, Souvanna Phouma accepted Ungerts proposal to initiate 
Iff-101 flights over the Plain of Jars, these being necessary to boost morale 
and spot targets for the T-28s. Souvanna emphasized, however, that the 
United States must take full responsibility for any violation of Lao heu-
trality involved in the overflights. In Washington, the US State Department 
announced that the reconnaissance flights were justified by the long-standing 
refusal of the Communists to allow the International Control Commission 
to inspect their territory. The Joint Chiefs of Staff directed the PDJ 
reconnaissance flights, and they were initiated on 21 May by Able Mable 
RF-101s staging through Da Nang and by US Navy RF8As flying from the air-
craft carrier Kitty. Hawk which was standing off Da Nang. An American 
observer reported that Kong Le jumped up and down with joy when the US 
jets appeared over the Plain of Jars. In this show of force, however, 
one law-flying Navy jet took hits from 50-caliber and 37-mm weapons which 
sent it limping back to a fortunately successful recovery on the Kitty 
Hawk. (180) 
When the Lao air force T-28 pilots commenced attacks with 100-pound 
bombs on 17 ay, the first really lucvative targets were the aauunition 
and supply dumps, well stocked in anticipation of the beginning of the 
rainy season, which Kong Le had left behind when he retreated off the Plain 
of Jars. On 18 May, Brig General Thab Ma, RLAF Commander, arrived at Udorn 
with three Lao pilots and picked up the four Water Pump T-28s. Three hours 
after an intermediate landing at Vientiane, the four aircraft flew combat 
missions. The 10 T-28s from South Vietnam arrived at Udorn on 20 May. 
The Lao pilots with whom General Moore talked during a two-day trip to 
Vientiane and Udorn on 23-24 May liked the T-28s, one referring to flying 
it as being just like driving a sports car, but General Ma had only 12 
pilots capable of flying the T-28s, and the Lao air force also needed 
help in arming and maintaining the planes. Souvanna Phouma insisted to 
Unger that all-out T-28 strikes were essential if Mhong Kheung, Ban An, 
and Mhong Soui were to be held. Unger messaged Rusk to make sure that 
he knew the degree to which the United States was becoming involved in 
violations of the Geneva agreement, but he considered that this was 
absolutely necessary to meet urgent requirements in an ugly situation. 
Accordingly, both Unger and Lt Colonel Robert L. F. Tyrrell, the Air 
Attache in Vientiane, recommended use of the USAF Water Pump pilots in 
combat, since they could guarantee a very high order of accuracy in the 
delivery of ordnance. On the other hand, Unger told Moore that it would

be in the best interests of the United States to keep low emphasis on 
the situation in Laos, and it would be practically impossible to put the 
Water Pump pilots secretly into combat. Moreover, Water Pomp was needed 
to train pilots and to maintain the Lao aircraft. The decision was there-
fore rather quickly made that Water Pump personnel would remain in an  
instructor status.

Between 17 May and 4 June the RIAF T-28s flew approximately 175 
combat sorties. The pilots enthusiastically reported successful results 
on every type of target they struck, and, while these results were doubt-
less exaggerated, the morale of the Kong Le forces defending Muong Soui 
greatly improved and the T-28s inhibited Communist attack. Significantly, 
the enemy did not concentrate for any large-scale attack after the begin-
ning of the bombing, and Meo ground patrols operating around Communist 
positions reported that they observed Communist troop casualties, that 
coolie laborers deserted because of fear of air attack, and that enemy 
vehicular traffic was dispersed and camouflaged by day and mved only 
at night or occasionally in bad weather. By 5 June Ambassador Unger 
judged that the Communists had gotten the "sial" that the United States 
was deeply concerned about their blatant violations of Lao neutrality. 
On this day, Sauvanna Phouma was also greatly encouraged by the combat 
situation, and authorized General Kouprasith to begin preparations for 
Operation Triangle, which was to be an air-supported ground offensive 
against three Pathet Lao battalions holding the junction of Highways 7 
and 13. Clearing this pocket would relieve Kong Lets forces to the east 
at Muong Soul and restore free movement along Highway 13 from Vientiane 
to Luang Prabang.(182) 
Except for the firm intention of General Smart and General Maddux 
that General Moore should be the single USAF operational air commander 
in Southeast Asia, air command organization for support of operations 
in Laos were indefinite on 17 May. In Bangkok, Maj General Ernest F. 
Easterbrook, as DEPCOMUSMACTHAI was the senior US military officer in 
Thailand and believed that he should control any US military activity 
in the country.(183) The Udorn activity, however, was fraught with the 
requirements of Ambassador Unger in Laos rather than the MAP in Thailand,

and Unger, determined to play down emphasis on military operations, main-
tained tight control of all bathing operations, making decisions on 
ordnance used (he continued to maintain physical possession of all bomb 
fuzes and to release them for each mission), employment of other than Lao 
pilots, and targets to be struck (which were often for political rather 
than military effect). As an added complication, General Ma was not 
certain how well the Lao and Thai pilots would work together and wanted 
the United States to assume control over the Thai augmentation force. (i81) 
In Vientiane on the morning of 24 May, General Moore discussed command 
organization with Ambassador Unger. They agreed that Lt Colonel Tyrrell, 
as Air Attache, would coordinate air operations in Laos for the US 
Embassy. They also agreed that a 2d Air Division operations center should 
be set up at Udorn, this because Vientiane airport had very few available 
facilities, because Unger wanted as few Americans in Laos as possible, and 
because the T-28s on loan to the RLAF would be maintained at Udorn. Before 
leaving Udorn, Moore directed Major Cochran to set up an AOC in a corner of 
the Air America hangar at Udorn with a direct communications line to another 
rudimentary AOC at Vientiane and a communications linkup to the AOC in Saigon. 
Early in June, Moore secured approval from PACAF to send a senior USAF colonel 
to Udorn as a 2d Air Division deputy and to move a detachment of the 35th 
Tactical Group, which was located at Don Muang Airfield, Bangkok, to Udorn 
to provide base services and begin building some troop housing. (185) 
Although Major Cochran 's Water Pump detachment was actually no more 
than a small T-28/SAW mobile training team, it was called upon for heroic 
activities. Receipt of four additional former-VNAF RT-28s (with cameras 
removed) allowed Water Pump to resume training. In short order Water Pump 
released the 10 Thai pilots for c!ambat, on 8 June, two of them being cross-
trained to fly three 1T-28 photo planes that would soon be provided. Under 
direction of the Vientiane Air Attache, Water Pump personnel manned the 
shoestring air operations center at Vientiane. In the normal operating 
pattern during June, four Lao pilots were stationed at Vientiane with 
four of the loaned T-28s and flew =Lesions against the Plain of Jars. The 
other nine Lao T-28 pilots were kept with the six RLAF T-28s at Savannakhet 
and engaged in operations over southern Laos. Each morning from Udorn, six 
Thai pilots flew T-28s to Vientiane, where the planes were combat loaded 
and made 12-18 strikes a day under direction of the Air Attache/Water Pump 
AOC against targets on the Plain of Jars. At the end of the day, the 
Thai pilots flew back to Udorn to remain over night. Once they were 
exposed to combat, the Thai pilots performed well: a Water Pump member 
commented that they "could fly with Any fighter pilots in the world and 
serve as flight leaders for most." After the Thai pilots were released 
for combat, Water Pump began training 10 Lao pilots tc operate T-28s in 
combat. Many of these men required English language instruction and the 
group required several months to became operationally ready. In addition 
to operations and training, Water Pump, together with Air America, ope-
rated the base at Udorn and provided maintenance for all of the T-28s 
committed in Laos, including the six RLAF planes at Savannakhet, which 
were usually rotated back to Udorn in very sad mechanical condition. 
After its establishment on 11 June, Detachment 2, 35th Tactical Group,

took over base support and maintenance, and Water Pump received an 
expanded training mission on 26 June when the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
approved plans to deploy a C-47 mobile .aircrew and maintenance training 
team from the USAF Special Air Warfare Center to Udorn. This 21-man 
MTT jointed Water Pump in July and commenced Lao C-47 proficiency and 
tactical training, the latter including night flare-drop operations. (186) 
In the initial JCS order for US jet air reconnaissance operations 
over Laos on 18 May, General Taylor assigned execution responsibility 
to COMUSMACV, and, when the Joint Chiefs committed US Navy carrier air-
craft to the reconnaissance flights on 20 May, General Westmoreland 
charged the Commander, 2d Air Division to coordinate the photo recon-
naissance. The Joint Chiefs assigned the nickname "Yankee Team" to 
the joint effort, and General Moore promptly organized a joint USAF/USN 
Yankee Team command post within 2d Air Division Operations, manned on 
the Navy side with a Navy captain and two lieutenant commanders from 
Task Force 77.4, The command post received photo targets from MACV, 
allocated them between Able Mable RF-101s and the EL-Li_ Hawk's RF-84.s, 
and in the first few days both General Moore and Rear Admiral Bringle, 
CTF-77.4, got off as many sorties as possible since both anticipated that 
the authority to overfly Laos would not last very long and it was 
important to get as much intelligence as possible. (187) On 22 May Admiral 
Felt recommended a continuing low-level reconnaissance program over Laos 
and a one-time complete photo coverage of North Vietnam but requested a 
short moratorium on flights over Laos to evaluate intelligence and lay 
more effective plans. The Joint Chiefs endorsed Felt's recommendations 
to the Secretary of Defense. There was no response on North Vietnam, 
but the Joint Chiefs instructed Felt on 25 May to put the low-level 
flights over Laos on a continuing basis, notifying them 36 hours in 
advance of each flight and providing specific justification if more 
than nine sorties were to be flown in a 2h-hour period. Under the 
new instructions CINCPAC issued the execution orders for the Yankee 
Team flights. (138) 
In discussions with Moore in Vientiane on 24 May, Ambassador Unger 
stressed that he did not want to "overdo" military actions in Laos, 
and, on 26 May, Unger recommended that reconnaissance flights be sus-
pended until 30 May since he thought that this would have a good 
psychological effect. At this time, General Westmoreland stated that 
some intelligence objectives in the Lao panhandle still had not been 
adequately photographed. Admiral Felt also ruled that the flights 
would continue, and in a tacit division of responsibilities Able Mable 
reconnaissance concentrated in the Lao panhandle and US Navy aircraft 
continued reconnaissance flights over northern Laos. (189) Early in June 
both the Navy RF-8A pilots and the T728 crews noted a "tremendous increase" 
in the number of 37-mm antiaircraft positions in the Plain of Jars area. 
The T-28s generally avoided the Communist gun-defended areas, (190) but 
the US Navy reconnaissance pilots were apprehensive that repeated low-
level photo missions over the same flight lines were establishing

predictable patterns of activity that would permit the Communists to 
concentrate enough antiaircraft weapons to mousetrap a reconnaissance 
jet. On 6 June an RF-8A, while photographing Route 7, was disabled 
by Communist guns and the pilot parachuted a few miles south of the 
Pathet Lao stronghold at Ban Ban. In Washington, President Johnson 
directed that the Navy would fly two low-level reconnaissance sorties 
on 7 June, with escorting fighter bombers under instructions to return 
fire if the reconnaissance jets were fired upon. This mission was flown 
as ordered on 7 June. It received ground fire; the escorting F-8Bs 
returned the fire, and one of them was shot down, its pilot parachuting 
into the jungle about 20 miles southwest of Ban Ta Viang.(191) 
In March 1962 a Rescue Coordination Center manned by a few rescue 
controllers had been established in the Air Operations Center at Tan Son 
Nhut, but despite recommendations by Generals Arthi,s and Moore no pro-
fessional USAF search and rescue forces had bcen authorized for Southeast 
Asia, the prevailing thought at MAN and CINCPAC being that helicopters 
belonging to VNAF, the US Army, or the US Marine3 could be mobilized to 
perform search and rescue when aircrews went down. This arrangement 
had worked, but not very well. It WAS possible, for example, that the 
US Army helicopters which had attempted to rescue the four swimming 
survivors of the helicopter that had gone down in the sea near the 
mouth of the Mekong on 18 January 1964 may have inadvertently drowned 
two of the men they were attempting to rescue with their rotor wash. 
Where professional SAR crews would have let down straight overhead and 
used their rotor wash to smooth out the area around the swimmers, the 
untrained helicopter crews approached at low level, creating waves in 
front of them(l92) In any event, General Moore was at Udorn on the 
morning of 6 June when Air America transport planes picked up the Mayday 
message from the RF-8A Yankee Team tilot on the ground. The Air America 
aircraft searched out the downed plot, also sighting two companies of 
enemy troops closing on him. At mid-afternoon two Air America H-34s 
attempted a pickup but both received heavy ground fire, one being so 
severely hit that a crewman was hospitalized. The helicopters withdrew 
to the nearest landing ground and called for fighter support. Four 
Thai-piloted T-28s were launched from Vientiane but did not locate the 
rescue area, whereupon General. Smart initiated a flash authority 
to Moore to employ USAF piloted T-28s from Udorn and. USAF F-100s from 
Takhli. During the late afternoon, seven USAF T-28 sorties and five 
F-100s were in the area but weather had deteriorated and there were no 
further sightings of the downed pilot, who was captured but would escape 
four months later and make his way to safety. If the air rescue effort 
could have been quickly managed, General Moore believed that the downed 
pilot could have been successfully retrieved, but the rescue attempt was 
not coordinated by a single authority. Fortunately, in the successful 
rescue of the US Navy F-BA fighter pilot on 7 June, Lt Colonel Tyrrell 
and Water Pump assumed responsibility for coordination and control of 
the search and rescue effort. The downed pilot was located on a wooded 
ridge 4,800 feet high: the first two Air America H-34s could not hover 
at that altitude but a third managed a successful hoist pickup. (193)

The uncoordinated SAR efforts broke loose a decision to deploy professional 
USAF search and rescue capabilities to Southeast Asia. On the evening of 
6 June, Moore messaged a request to Thirteenth Air Force for USAF H-43 
rescue helicopters and for authority to escort RF-101s with F-100s, and 
General Maddux in turn requested expedited CINCPAC attention to the SAR 
problem. On 19 June an H-43B base rescue detachment arrived at Nakhom 
Phanom from Okinawa and in the next several weeks professional SAR de-
tachments were organized at the principal South Vietnamese and Thai bases. 
An HU-16 rescue plane, equipped with a full range of radios and radars to 
serve as a rescue control center for an on-scene SAR commander, was de-
ployed to Da Nang but would orbit over Nakham Phanam while missions were 
in progress and be prepared to control any necessary SAR efforts which 
for a number of months would continue to be flown with Air America H-34s 
since the H-43B helicopters were suited only for operations in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the airfields on which they were located. The SAR effort 
on 6 June also produced a political confrontation of a sort with US 
Ambassador Graham A. Martin in Bangkok, who was not informed of the fact 
that General Smart had directed use of USAF Thai-based aircraft in the 
emergency in Laos for nearly 24 hours after the event. Ambassador Martin 
messaged Secretary Rusk that "this is really a hell of a way to run a 
railroad," but he nevertheless asked and secured a blanket authority from 
Deputy Minister of Defense Dee on 8 June whereby in air rescue emergencies 
US aircraft based in Thailand would be permitted to support BAR efforts in 
Laos. (19I) 
On 7 June, when the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized armed fighter 
escort for Yankee Team reconnaissance aircraft, General Smart directed 
the Fifth Air Force to deploy three KB-50 conventional tankers to Clark 
Air Base and the Thirteenth Air Force to alert six F-100s at Clark to be 
used for fighter escort and fire support. During the day the 4215t Air 
Refueling Squadron deployed the tankers to Clark, and the Thirteenth Air 
Force alerted the 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which was on rotational 
duty at Clark from the Tactical Air Command. Following the shoot-down of 
the Navy fighter bomber during the day on 7 June, President Johnson dir,:Dcted 
a retaliation, and the Joint Chiefs assigned the mission to the USAF, direct-
ing a strike by eight F-100s with maximum conventional ordnance -- napalm 
being suggested -- to be made on 9 June against Communist antiaircraft guns 
inside an old Star-of-David shaped fort lying between the airstrip and the 
town of Xieng Khouang. Five Strategic Air Command KC-135 jet tankers were 
diverted to Clark to reftel the F-100s and the KB-50s were committed to 
inflight refueling of RF-101s, which would provide immediate poststrike 
photography. The eight F-100s went to Da Nang on 8 June, and the flight 
commanders studied target photography at Tan Son Nhut for a planned low 
level napalm drop to be followed by dive bombing attacks with 750-1b. 
general purpose bombs. Shortly after midnight on 9 June, Da Nang time, 
the Joint Chiefs directed that napalm would not be used, and the napalm 
tanks were down-loaded and replaced with bombs. New refueling plans also 
had to be hurriedly made, both in view of the changed ordnance and also 
because the Joint Chiefs messaged that overflights of Thailand would not 
be permitted. In a dive bombing attack, target weather conditions would

be critical, but an hour before the takeoff an Air America Caribou ope-
rating in the general vicinity of Xiang Khouang reported seven-tenths 
broken cloud coverage. Despite the Constantly changing plans, the mission 
took off as scheduled and made- successful rendezvous with the KC-135s for 
refueling over Laos. The tanker route and the route of the fighters had 
to be changed because of towering cumulus clouds, with the result that 
the F-100s had less than preplanned fuel when they reached the target area, 
which also proved to be covered with cumulus that rose to 15,000 feet. The 
two flights becaMe separated. The first four F-100s located and salvoed 
their bombs on the star-shaped fort hear Xieng Khouang. The second four 
F-100s made five orbits and were about to jettison their bombs and depart 
when they located a star-shaped fort near an airstrip, which they success-
fully attacked, and which proved to be Phang Sayan. As a result of the 
mixup, the primary target received only about 20 percent destruction, but 
the fort near Phong Sayan -- which fortunately was in Communist hands --
was about 50 percent destroyed. SiNiof the F-100s received post-attack 
aerial refueling and returned to Da Nang, but two were too short of fuel 
after leaving the target and had to violate instructions and recover at. 
Ubon Airfield in Thailand. Mission results were less than desired, but 
the final PACAF assessment was that the 615th Squadron had done a good job 
considering the many changes in very strict restrictions, the uncertain 
weather, and the lack of navigational aids in Laos. (195) 
Although there was no question in Souvanna Phouma's mind that the 
armed violations of Lao neutrality by the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese 
justified the military responses that had been taken, he was very conscious 
of the necessity for maintaining the Geneva agreements and insisted for 
political reasons that the United States and Laos must avoid acknowledging 
actions that would provide propaganda advantages to the Communists. He 
insisted that the United States mus play the game the Communist way, 
namely. to ."act but don't talk about it." Unhappy about the Washington 
publicity given to the armed Yankee Team escorts, Souvanna, following the 
9 June strike, asked that reconnaissance be called off. Apparently after 
some time for reflection and in vi of continuing Communist troop move-
ments, Souvanna met Unger on 11 June midasked that the reconnaissance 
be commenced again, though without publicity. Souvanna also wanted to 
make maximum use of the T-28s to interdict supplies arriving over routes 
to Xieng Khouang (No. 7) and toward Thakhek and Savannakhet (Nos. 8 and 
12), and to destroy the ComMunist supplies already in place, thus crip-
pling the enemy so that Lao forces it due course would be able to retake 
the Plain of Jars. Later in the month Souvanna proposed that US air 
strikes could be conducted against enemy convoys moving on Route 7 in 
support of a buildup hazarding Nbung Soui, but only at night when the 
nationality of the aircraft would not be provable. (196) 
The Yankee Team reconnaissance began again on 14 June, but under new 
rules reflecting both political and Military factors. A considerable 
body of reconnaissance photography had been accumulated, and Admiral Felt 
recommended intermittent and random operations to meet specific require-
ments. Ambassador Unger required a daily summary of all missions and 
advanced information on all missions plannedin a 24-hour period, this

to enable him to have exact knowledge to respond to Communist propaganda 
charges. Unger did not oppose retaliatory armed response to Communist 
ground fire, but he opposed suppressive fire on the part of armed escort 
prior to ground fire against the reconnaissance planes. Up until 9 June, 
CINCPAC had had execution authority for all Yankee Team missions, but in 
the renewed flights the Joint Chiefs of Staff retained execution authority 
for each flight flown. By 16 June, the Joint Chiefs provided that Yankee 
Team flights would normally be flown at medium altitudes (this defined as 
being above the effective range of hostile ground fire); that low level 
reconnaissance flights, flown when medium level would not produce desired 
results, would be accompanied by armed escorts, but would normally avoid 
areas of known strong antiaircraft defenses; and that low-level reconnais-
sance of areas of strong antiaircraft would be conducted only for specific 
cogent reasons on a case by case approval basis and when authorized by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. Since reconnaissance was necessary only to update 
intelligence, the new schedule of Yankee Team flights was greatly reduced. 
In the weeks after 9 June, USAF Yankee Team flights of two RF-I01 and four 
F-100s went out only on 14 and 27 June. (197) In July available USAF re-
sources for Yankee Team were employed on only ten days. Of the missions, 
two were high-priority low-level flights and the remainder were medium 
level. The escorts returned fire during a law-altitude mission at the 
panhandle town of Nhommareth on 31 July. 
During Joint Chiefs of Staff discussion after mid-June, General Lellay 
mistrusted the ad hoc responses in Laos which he insisted did not look 
toward a broader effort that recognized that there could be no satisfactory 
solution to the military problems in South Vietnam and Laos without military 
action against North Vietham. In early July, LeMay also recommended that 
US night air strikes be flown against Route 7, although day operations 
would be more effective. Accepting LeMay's paper, the Joint Chiefs recom-
mended on 11 July that operational cammanders be authorized to conduct the 
night air strikes for their psychological and deterrent effect. On 21 
July, Secretary McNamara disapproved the recommendation for night opera-
tions, stating: "It is not desired to involve U.S. forces in Laos to 
such a degree under present circumstances. "(198) 
In the emergencies of June, the improvised 2d Air Division command 
establishment at Udorn maintained liaison between Tan Son Nhut and 
Vientiane, and the activation of Detachment 2, 35th Tactical Group provided 
local base services and maintenance support. General Moore went to Udorn 
at frequent intervals to give personal direction, and the COMUSMACV staff 
normally kept the MACTHAI staff informed of crash activities for the benefit 
of Ambassador Martin in Bangkok. Because of the increased significance of 
air activities in Laos after mid-June, General Smart began to develop plans 
for a full-scale 2d Air Division command and control facility at Udorn, to 
include an air support operations center and a radar caMbat reporting post. 
The employment of USAF jets based at Takhli to cover the SAR attempt in 
Laos on 6 June without approval of Thailand had already embarrassed Ambassador 
Martin, and when Martin learned of the plans for the Udorn ASOC/CRF he sent 
a stinging letter to General Maddux, protesting Thirteenth Air Force/2d Air

Division activities in Thailand, which were undertaken without his knowledge 
and prior arrangements for Thai agreement. At this juncture both Ambassador 
Martin and General Easterbrobk were said to be thinking hard about a command 
arrangement whereby an Air Force component commander to Deputy COMUSMACTHAI 
in Bangkok should be in charge of air operations over Laos. (199) 
In order to clarify these matters, General Smart recommended to 
CINCPAC on 2 July that command and control of air operations over Laos 
should not be vested in MALTHAI, which was oriented to training and MAP, 
but should be vested in PACOM air component command channels. The 
CINCARPAC did not concur that command and control of an operation could 
be diverted away from a responsible subunified commander, but he conceded 
that COMUSMACTHAI ought not to be in the chain of command for Laos opera-
tions.(200) On 4 July, CINCPAC directed that COMUSMACV would be the coor-
dinating authority for the continuing Yankee Team missions, with authority 
to delay, cancel, or reschedule missions according to local conditions. 
The MACV authority was exercised through the 2d Air Division command post. 
The Joint Chiefs of Staff continued to require 36-hours advance notice of 
Yankee Team flights. (201) In a harmonizing meeting with Martin and 
Easterbrook in Bangkok on 9 July, Moore successfully convinced them of the 
requirement for the ASOC/CRP at Udorn and agreed to insure that close 
liaison would be maintained between Udorn and MACTHAI. On 18 July, Colonel 
Jack H. McCreery, who had been serving as the Deputy Director of the AOC 
at Tan Son Nhut, led the 2d Air Division advance party to Udorn, where 
McCreery was initially titled Deputy Commander for Laos Affairs and a 
little later Deputy Commander, 2d Air Division in Thailand. Manned by 
elements of the 5th Tactical Control Group and 1st Mobile Communications 
Group, the CRP was operationally ready at Udorn on 26 July.(202) 
When Souvanna Phouma proposed Operation Triangle on 5 June, there 
was a great skepticism as to the success of such a Lao air-ground offen-
sive, since the Royal Lao and Neutralist troops had never been able to 
sustain a successful operation. In Vientiane, however, Lt Colonel 
Tyrrell nevertheless observed that T-28 successes had weakened Pathet 
Lao morale and strengthened the spirit of the FAR-Neutralist troops. In 
preparation for a three-column offensive designed to clear the junction of 
Routes 7 and 13, Thailand made available a 300-man artillery commitment, 
eight US Army advisors were brought in to follow along in the field with 
the Lao regimental groups mobile, and USAF FAC/ALO teams were introduced 
to accompany the three ground forces. A FAC deployed with the leading 
element of each ground force and passed support requests back to the ALO 
by UHF radio or courier. The ALO accompanied the ground commander and 
communicated with the Air Attache by radio. The Air Attache communicated 
with the AOC at Vientiane by telephone and also exercised control over 
the Udorn-based T-28s, upon their daily arrival at Vientiane. The USAF 
units at Udorn, in turn, provided MAXIMUM support based on requirements of.-
Lt Colonel Tyrrell, as Air Attache. The beginning of the seasonal summer 
monsoon rains over northern Laos in June and July delayed airlifts of 
artillery into Muong Soul, thereby holding up Operation Triangle, but pre-
liminaries were completed by 15 July. Between 20-28 July, the T-28s flew

an average of over 30 sorties a day. The ground operation kicked off on 
25 July, aided by 14 T-28 strikes called in by Kong Le against trenches 
and field artillery positions blocking his advance, and after the air 
strikes the positions were taken with Only three reported Neutralist 
casualties. Similar strikes supported the other prongs of the offensive. 
The southern prong of Operation Triangle moved northward along Route 13 
and seized Milong Kassy at the end of July. Fran the Muong Soui area, 
Kong Le troops moved westward along Route 7, advancing to Phou Suong. 
The northwest prong moved against the junction of Routes 7 and 13, blocking 
Pathet Lao reinforcements from the northwest and west and taking the junction 
on 30 July. Lao morale soared as the successful two week operation liberated 
important real estate and relieved Neutralist forces blockaded at Muong Soui. 
The successful employment of the T-28s were a major factor in the victory, 
but the onset of summer rains also helped, since North Vietnamese forces 
had been pulled back to lighten supply requirements during the season of 
muddy roads, leaving the area to be defended relatively ineffectively by 
Pathet Lao troops. (203) 
Through the summer months the military responses in Laos were keyed 
to international diplamatic soundings and negotiations. President Johnson 
described US objectives as being a firm adherence to the Geneva agreements 
and support for Souvanna Phouma's national union governmsnt.(20)4) On 17 May 
Secretary Rusk informed the Polish ambassador in Washington that if the 
Cannunist attacks continued in Laos the Geneva accords would be destroyed 
and asked the ambassador to have his government put pressure on Peking and 
Hanoi to stop the military course of action or run the risk of war with 
the United States.(205) In mid-May, the United States stoutly resisted 
Communist Chinese proposals that the foreign ministers of the Geneva 
conference nations meet in Cambodia to address the question of Laos first 
and then confer on all Southeast Asian problems.(206) On 27 May the Polish 
diplomatic initiative for a new Laos conference that would not include 
discussions of Vietnam placed the Laos crisis in more favorable perspective, 
and on 18 June Secretary Rusk emphasized that the United States was taking 
only "necessary, limited measures" in Laos and its purpose was not to 
escalate the fighting."(207) The effect of diplomacy on the responses 
in Laos was rather clear throughput the summer, but was quite apparent 
during Operation Triangle, when on 22 July Ambassador Unger authorized 
employment of napalm in case of heavy Communist attacks against Muong 
Soui or reversals to the Lao offensive, only to retract the authority 
on 31 July, when Soviet Premier Khrushchev threatened to declare that the 
Soviet Union could no longer bear its responsibility as Geneva power co-
chairman unless there was an immediate 14-nation conference on Laos. (208) 
On 30 July the US State Department supported Souvanna Phouma's position 
that he would be willing to attend a Geneva .international conference pro-
vided a ceasefire was effected under ICC supervision and the Pathet Lao 
withdrew from the areas it had illegally occupied by virtue of their May 
attacks. (209) Ironically, at the US State Department level, the Lao victory 
in Operation Triangle posed complications to the objective of stabilizing 
the situation in Laos. The Lao victory promised to provoke Communist esca-
lation, which the United States did not want. Secretary Rusk could now see

utility in a Geneva conference limited to Laos, but, if Souvanna and the 
United States continued to insist upon a Communist withdrawal from the 
Plain of Jars, the Communists would inevitably insist that Souvanna yield 
the Triangle gains. If Souvanna relaxed his claim to the Plain of Jars 
or gave up Triangle gains it would be doubtful that he could maintain power 
in Vientiane. (210) At this juncture, no decisions on Laos proved immediately 
necessary, since the anticipated Communist escalation of conflict was 
occurring in Vietnam, where Peking and Hanoi apparently felt that there 
was a better chance to gain power through an imminent collapse of the 
Saigon government than through an international conference on Southeast 
Asia. 
S. Tonkin Gulf Attack and Its Aftermath  
During April 1964 high level USAF U-2 reconnaissance showed that Hanoi 
was readying forces for the invasion of South Vietnam through Laos. The 
Lao government in Vientiane was weak, Souvanna was less than satisfied 
that discussion with the Pathet Lap had failed to restore a neutral govern-
ment of national union, and the Communists were preparing for renewed 
military offensives at the beginning of the autumn dry season. (211) The 
Khanh government in Saigon was almost completely ineffective, and Hanoi 
was attempting to score a dramatic military or political success to clinch 
their victory. In the words of General Maxwell Taylor, who arrived as 
US Ambassador in Saigon on 7 July: "We lived dangerously in this period; 
never sure from night to night when a new coup might overthrow another 
feeble government or when we might lose some important town to a surprise 
attack or a military base to mortar fire. "(212) From a military view the 
strategic situation lent weight to General LeMay's assessment to the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, reiterated on 26 Jute, that there could not be a satis-
factory solution to the military problem in South Vietnam and Laos without 
military action against North VietnaM.(213) In mid-1964 highest level US 
policy recognized the Hanoi-Peking threat to Southeast Asia but emphasized 
in-country responses in Laos and South Vietnam and the supremacy of civil 
authority. In his letter of instructions to Ambassador Taylor on 2 July, 
President Johnson stated that Taylor's responsibility included the whole 
military effort in South Vietnam and authorized the degree of command and 
control that Taylor considered appropriate.(214) This Presidential in-
struction impacted upon the long standing military responsibilities of 
Admiral Ulysses S. Grant Sharp, who became CINCPAC on 1 July 1964, follow-
ing retirement of Admiral Felt. The policy of dealing with aggression 
separately by individual countries also split the unity of the airpower 
of the Pacific Air Forces, under command of General Hunter Harris after 
1 August 1964, into three packages of separate operations -- in-country 
South Vietnam, operations in Laos, and plans for operations against North 
Vietnam. (215) 
In order to provide some pressure against Hanoi with minimum risk, 
President Johnson had against 
North Vietnam at the beginning of January 1963', and resources for con-
ducting the missions began to be committed at the end of the month,

Counterinsurgency and Special Activities (SACSA) of the Joint Chiefs of

Special Operations Group (MACSOG) and included'

ew ox tne 
the information that South Vietnam was parachuting commandos into North 
Vietnam. He also said that VNAF was training for special missions that 
would include attack, support, and paradrops on a large scale outside 
South Vietnam.(216) In an emotional address at a rally on 18 July marking 
Vietnam's "day of shame" -- the anniversary of the 1954 division of the 
country -- Khanh asserted that his government could not remain indifferent 
before the firm determination of all the people who were considering the 
"push northward as an appropriate means to fulfill our national history." 
Next day, the Government of Vietnam issued a statement declaring: "If 
Communist China and Communist Vietnam obstinately continue their war of 
aggression, the government and entire people of Vietnam will step up the 
war with determination until total victory liberates the whole of our 
national territory. "(217) In a conference with Taylor on 23 July, Khanh 
insisted that North Vietnamese draftees had been taken prisoner in South 
Vietnam and that the war had entered a new phase. On 24 July, Khanh asked 
Taylor whether he should resign. After these discussions, Taylor noted that 
"Marching North" could -- if strongly opposed by the United States -- foment 
dissatisfaction with American policy and result in detriment to the chances 
for success of in-country pacification. It was also possible that "one 
maverick pilot taking off for Hanoi with a load of bombs" could touch off 
an unwanted extension of hostilities. Instead of voicing unqualified US 
opposition to the "March North" campaign, Taylor suggested that the South 
Vietnamese should be involved in contingency planning for extended actions 
against North Vietnam, thus gaining time for the South Vietnamese govern-
ment to stabilize.(218) Ambassador Taylor requested and received a brief-
ing from MACV on the prospects for offensive guerrilla warfare, and after 
25 July MACV initiated planning with the RVNAF JGS for cross-border offensive 
guerrilla operations into the Lao panhandle, initially airdrops of 
teams to be followed by an establishment of str 
South Vietnamese bridgeheads into Laos to interdict North Vietnamese infil-
tration.(219) In a continuation of operations, four South Vietnamese 
patrol boats left Da Nang on 30 July and shelled a North Vietnamese radar 
station on Hon Me island and a communications transmitter on Hon Ngu island --
both islands off the North Vietnamese coast near Vinh and heavily involved 
in Hanoi's sea infiltration activity -- on the night of 30/31 July. (220) 
In keeping with normal military intelligence requirements, US naval 
DeSoto patrols routinely operated in international waters off the coasts 
of Asia, monitoring hostile activities by visual and electronic sightings.

In March 1964 the latest De Soto patrol into the Tonkin Gulf had encountered 
weather that had greatly reduced visual intelligence collection, and the 
commander of the US Pacific Fleet was apprehensive about growing North 
Vietnamese and Chinese Communist electronic orders of battle, which (together 
with Red Chinese aircraft) posed a potential danger to US fleet units operat-
ing off Da Nang. (221) On 10 July a detachment of the USAF 6091st Reconnais-
sance Squadron arrived from Japan at Don MUang Air Base, and on 14 July the 
detachment's C-130B aircraft began to fly airborne cammunications reconnais-
sance missions, nicknamed Queen Bee, over the Gulf of Tonkin. In addition, 
a DeSoto patrol was approved to beginlon 31 July. This patrol by the 
destroyer Maddox was uneventful until the late afternoon of 2 August when 
the ship was met and fired upon off Han Mb island by three high-speed North 
Vietnamese Swatow patrol boats. The attacks were beaten off by the Maddox 
and by aircraft from the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga. Since there was no 
rational enemy motive for the attack, Secretary McNamara thought it possible 
that the attack on the Maddox resulted from a miscalculation or an impulsive 
act of a local cammander. The Maddox, however, was 28 miles off the North 
Vietnamese coast and in international waters. At the direction of President 
Johnson, the United States dispatched a note of protest to Hanoi, and at the 
same time the President made public his instructions to the Navy to continue 
the DeSoto patrols and to add another destroyer to the patrols. On 3 
August the Maddox and the C. Turner  Jay entered the Gulf of Tonkin, 
covered by daylight combat-Irrils from the Ticonderoga. During 
the night of 3/4 August, South Vietnamese 34-A forces raided a mainland 
radar station on Cape Vinh Son and a security station near Cua Ron. The 
DeSoto patrols were uneventful during daylight hours on 3 and L. August, 
but in bad weather on the night of 4 August the Maddox reported that the 
patrol was under attack. Admiral Smart recommended authority for immediate 
punitive air strikes against North Vietnam, and President Johnson -- while 
emphasizing in a radio and television address that the response would "be 
limited and fitting" -- directed that the Pacific Fleet would on 5 August 
local time conduct Operation Pierce Arrow, a one-time maximum effort attack 
against North Vietnamese Swatow boat bases and supporting POL storage at 
Vinh. Sixty-four, strike aircraft were launched in two waves from the air-
craft carriers Ticonderoga and Constellation against five boat bases and 
the Vinh oil storage. Eight boats were destroyed and 21 were damaged; 
the oil storage was 90 percent destroyed; two Navy aircraft were lost to 
antiaircraft defenses at Hon Gai. At President Johnson's request, the US 
Senate and House enacted a joint resolution approved on 10 August declaring 
that: "Consonant with the Constitution of the United States and the Charter 
of the United Nations and in accordance with its obligations under the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States is . . . prepared 
as the PreSident determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use 
of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia 
Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom." 
In September Hanoi published a lengthy white paper which justified the 2 
August attacks against the Maddox as appropriate to defense against 34-A 
attacks and declared that none of ib e naval craft were present in the area 
on the night of 4 August, when the DeSoto patrol vessels reported them-
selves under attack. (222)

Concurrently with the reprisal attack order on 5 August, President 
Johnson authorized and the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed positive 
emergency actions under CINCPAC Operations Plan 37-64 to move additional 
forces into the Pacific and particularly Southeast Asia. The rotation 
of Candy Machine F-102 jet interceptors to South Vietnam was already 
approved by Saigon, and, while the Tonkin reprisal strikes were in progress 
on 5 August, six 509th Fighter Squadron F-102s from Clark Air Base 
landed at Da Nang while six other 16th Fighter Squadron F-102s from 
Naha Air Base, Okinawa, established an air defense alert at Tan Son Nhut.(223) 
At noon on 5 August, General Westmoreland met General Khanh and the RVNAF 
commanders to outline the purpose of the Pierce Arrow strikes and request 
authority for defense alert and augmentations in South Vietnam. Westmoreland 
recommended maximum alerts against expected Vietcong retaliations and 
particularly suggested that VNAF mount maximum efforts against the Vietcong 
to throw them off balance and disrupt their retaliatory plans. Khanh 
agreed to these measures as well as the deployment of F-100s to Da Nang 
and B-57s to Bien Hoa, but he stated and repeated that if either the 
North Vietnamese or the Chinese Communists attacked any part of South 
Vietnam the Government of Vietnam would retaliate by air attacks at targets 
of its own choosing and would not "require a green light from Washington.? 
Subsequent to this meeting, however, Ambassador Taylor called on Khanh, 
delivered a letter from President Johnson which underlined the need for 
closest bilateral consultation, and Khanh told Taylor that he fully accepted 
this requirement.(224) The movement of additional USAF forces into Thailand 
required coordination with the Thai government, ami, while the Thai govern-
ment coordinated the deployments, it was reluctant to agree to combat sorties 
being flown out of Thailand. On the morning of 7 August, Deputy Defense 
Minister Dawee called on Ambassador Martin and, after a lengthy discussion, 
reluctantly agreed that US aircraft could launch combat sorties from Thai 
bases if this became absolutely necessary. He hoped that other assets could 
be employed from South Vietnamese bases before Thai-based assets were used 
and that, in the event that Thai-baLced units were committed to combat, it 
would not be necessary to reveal publicly that they were flying from 
Thailand, (225) 
On 6 August, General Moore established a 2d Air Division command 
post at Tan Son Nhut separate from the VNAF-USAF AOC, placed his staff 
on two 12-hour shift operations, and began to tie all USAF units together 
through the existing TACS, utilizing the US manned side of the TACS.(226) 
On 7 August, General Westmoreland proposed that COMUSMACV and the Govern-
ment of Vietnam Would appoint the Commander 2d Air Division as the combined 
air commander, and that the combined air commander would, with an RVNAF 
deputy, exercise operational command over USAF and VNAF forces for offensive 
air strikes into North Vietnam and Laos, for air defense of South Vietnam, 
and for air support of combined RVNAF-US mobile ground forces, which (under 
comand of the Deputy COMUSMACV and an RVNAF deputy) would conduct opera-
tions in the northern provinces of South Vietnam to block and repel in-
cursions of aggressor forces. The counterinsurgency operations inside 
South Vietnam would remain under RVNAF control, with MAN assisting the

effort. At this time Admiral Sharp acted only upon the air organization 
for activities against North Vietnam, and on 8 August he determined that 
these would be managed by CINCPAC through CINCPACAF and CINCPACFLT. 
According to Sharp's decision, the control of Air Force forces against 
North Vietnam would be exercised through CINCPACAF to Commander, Thirteenth 
Air Force to Commander, 2d Air Division. In this control, the large and 
expert staffs of PACAF and PACFLT would be utilized, and, since Commander, 
2d Air Division worked for both COMUSMACV and CINCPACAF, coordination 
would be easily effected. Sharp also pointed out that the arrangement 
would permit COMDSMACV to concentrate upon counterinsurgency in South 
Vietnam and at the same time he would be able to monitor air activities 
against North Vietnam through Commander, 2d Air Division. (227) 
Issued on 5-6 August, the JCS directives for USAF unit deployment 
into Southeast Asia and to the Pacific came on a no-notice basis and 
called for immediate movements. Identification of 30 MIG-15/17 Communist 
jet fighters on Phuc Yen airfield at Hanoi on 7 August, which had been ? 
flown in from Communist China immediately following Pierce Arrow, lent 
added urgency to the air deployments.(228) On the afternoon of 5 August, 
8 F-100s of the 615th Tactical Fighter Squadron, which was still an its 
rotational deployment at Clark Air Base, deployed uneventfully to Da Nang. 
The same evening, 36 3-57s of the 8th and 13th Bomb Squadrons ran into diffi-
culty getting into Bien Hoa when rains lowered visibility and slicked the 
("WV runway. One of the B-57s crashed in Vietcong-held territory in its approach 
to Bien Hoa and two others were damaged in landing accidents. Other deploy-
ments followed. I reconnaissance task force of 6 RF-101s from Misawa and 
Kadena augmented Able Mable at Tan Son Nhut, and the 405th Tactical Wing 
deployed 10 F-100s from Clark to Takhli. A refueling element of 8 KB-50s 
from PACAF's 421st Air Refueling Souadron moved from Yokota to operating 
locations at Tan Son Nhut and Takhli. The flight of 8 F-105 jet fighters 
of the 36th Tactical Fighter Squadron from Yokota to Clark to Korat was 
delayed by weather, but these planes reached the Thai airfield on 9 August, 
completing the immediate PACAF deployments. In the same days, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff also directed CINCSTRIKE to deploy a Tactical Air Command 
(or AFSTRIKE) composite air strike force -- nicknamed One Buck -- to the 
Pacific. In the One Buck movements, the 614th and 522d Tactical Fighter 
Squadron's F-100s landed at Clark Air Base on 8-9 August; the 363d 
Composite Reconnaissance Unit (6 RF-101s) reached Kadena on 13 August; and 
48 C-130 transport planes drawn from the 314th, 463d, and 516th Troop 
Carrier Wings arrived at Clark and Kadena between 9-21 August. In support 
of the deployments, the Strategic Air Command provided 48 KC-135 jet 
tankers, operating principally from Hickam AFB and Anderson AFB on Guam 
to provide in-flight refueling. SAC also established a Yankee Team 
Tanker Task Force of 8 KC-135s at Clark on 5 August.(229) 
At the request of the United States, the Canadian member of the 
Vietnam ICC visited Premier Pham Van Dong in Hanoi shortly after the 
Pierce Arrow reprisal and told him that the United States viewed Hanoi's 
role in Laos and South Vietnam as critical and warned that if Hanoi

persisted in aggression it could expect to continue to suffer the con-
sequences. Pham Van Dong was reported to be "utterly unintimidated" 
and "calmly resolved" to pursue the course already embarked upon to a 
successful conclusion. Prior to Pierce Arrow, North Vietnam's aircraft 
inventory was ineffective for air defense, consisting of 30 trainers, 
50 transports, and 4 light helicopters. On 7 August aerial photography 
of Phuc Yen airfield near Hanoi revealed 30 MIG 15/17 jet fighters which 
had obviously been flown in from Communist China. The Communist Chinese 
also moved larger numbers of MIG-15s and 17s to Hainan Island and South 
China bases.(230) Immediately after Pierce Arrow, Admiral Sharp requested 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff to secure a new rule of engagement whereby US 
aircraft -4ould be authorized to pursue hostile attacking aircraft into 
hostile airspace, rather than stopping at a three mile line off North 
Vietnam's coast.(231) On 8 August General Harris asked Sharp to take note 
that the MEGs on Phuc Yen were a direct threat to the security of PACAF 
forces deployed in Southeast Asia and that destruction of these jet air-
craft would constitute a "sharn lesson" to Communist China with respect 
to further deployments or additional plans for aggression. Harris 
propos:Id that in three hours after receipt of a directive to strike, 
the USA' F-100s on alert at Da Nang could prosecute a low-level high-
speed surprise attack against the aircraft parked at Phuc Yen with 
cluster bomb CBU-2A weapons to be followed by flak suppression and 
attacks against individual remaining aircraft with AGM-12B/LAU-3 rockets, 
if necessary. If desired, the USAF F-105s at Karat could fly the 
mission, but Harris recommended the F-100s at Da Nang because they were 
on a high state of alert and nearest to the target (232) 
On 9 August, Ambassador Taylor remarked that General Khanh was in 
a "fairly euphoric state" as a result of the US reprisal to the Tonkin 
Gulf attack, but on 10 August Taylor's estimate of the situation in 
South Vietnam judged that Khanh's ineffective government had only a 
50/50 chance to last out the year. Taylor stated that the US Mission 
objectives were to do everything possible to bolster the Khanh govern-
ment, to improve the in-country pacification campaign against the 
Vietcong, and to be prepared to implement contingency plans against 
North Vietnam by 1 January 1965.(233) Reflecting Taylor's estimate, 
Assistant Secretary of State William P. Bundy prepared a draft policy 
memorandum on the subject "Next Courses of Action in Southeast Asia" 
which was considered by the National Security Council at noon on 14 
August. The memorandum projected a sequence of actions including a 
short "holding phase" for the remainder of August, avoiding any actions 
that would give the Communists an excuse for escalation; a phase of 
"limited pressures" in September through December to maintain the 
initiative and morale of the Khanh government without major risks of 
50X1 escalation, including overt perations, training VNAF pilots to fly 
jet aircraft, cross-border operations into the Lao panhandle, reintroduc-
tion of DeSoto patrols, and specific "tit-for-tat" reprisals; and a phase 
of more serious pressures beginning on 1 January 1965, such as action 
against infiltration routes and facilities progressing upward to actions 
against military-related targets in North Vietnam. (23L) Following the

NSC meeting on 14 August, the Bundy paper was cabled to CINCPAC and the 
US Embassies in Saigon and Laos. On 17 August, Admiral Sharp recommended 
that the Tonkin Gulf response had created a momentum with advantages that 
should not be lost. He did not like the proposed two-weeks suspension 
of operations, wanted continuous and effective pressure against the 
Communists in Laos both on the Plain of Jars and in the panhandle, and 
50X1 
thought it appropriate to resumelictions and DeSoto patrols. Sharp 
also pointed out that US air units *t a Nang, Bien Hoa, and Tan Son Nhut 
were vulnerable to a Vietcong attack. He suggested US ground troops for 
the defense of those bases and proposed that the establishment of a major 
US base most feasibly at Da Nang would indicate to the Communists that 
the United States meant to remain in Southeast Asia until its objectives 
were achieved. (23S) On 18 August, the US Mission response from Saigon 
recommended that the United States should attempt to gain time for the 
Khadh government to develop evidences of viability and not get too deeply 
involved militarily with North Vietham and possibly Red China if the base 
in South Vietnam was insecure, to maintain Khanh's morale by providing 
assurances of readiness to increase pressure on Hanoi if he did his part, 
to hold Hanoi in check and restrain infiltration from the north, and to 
develop a posture of maximum readiness for escalation of pressure against 
North Vietnam with 1 January 1965 as the target D-day. Given an under-
standing on Khanh!s part that he would stabilize his government and make 
50X1 would be prepared to resume perations and DeSoto patrols, resume 
progress with the Hop Tac p7cifiTion plan around Saigon, the US Mission 
U-2 flights over North Vietnam, Initiate air and ground strikes against 
infiltration routes in Laos, and consider appropriate tit-for-tat bombing 
operations to compensate for Vietcong depredations in South Vietnam. (236) 
In the progression of planning, the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 24 August 
recommended a list of 94 selected targets in North Vietnam grouped in five 
basic categories (airfields, line cf ccmmunication, military installations, 
industrial installations, and armed reconnaissance routes) that were suita-
ble for air attacks with readily available forces in the event a policy 
decision was made to conduct combat operations against North Vietnam. (237) 
At this same time, the Joint Chiefs sent the 94 targets to CINCPAC with 
directions to develop strike plans for four patterns of attack in ascending 
order of severity against North Vietnam. On 26 August the Joint Chiefs 
informed Secretary McNamara that, contrary to Ambassador Twlor's position, 
they considered significantly stronger military pressures on North Vietnam 
were required to provide the relief and psychological boost necessary for 
the attainment of governmental stability and viability in Saigon. They 
recommended emphasis on pacification in South Vietnam, interdiction of the 
Vietcong line of communications through Laos by operations in the panhandle 
and through Cambodia by strict control of waterways leading therefrom, by 
denial of Vietcong sanctuaries on the Cambpdian-South Vietnam border through 
the conduct of "hot pursuit" oper into Cambodia, and by increased 
50X1 pressure on North Vietnam through operations and DeSoto patrols. 
Believing that even more forceful m ary actions would be required, the 
Joint Chiefs advocated prompt and calculated responses to Vietcong/Pathet 
Lao actions in the form of air strikes against targets in North Vietnam 
appropriately selected fromihe 94-target list. (238)

While US policy was under discussion, the Saigon government wallowed 
in confusion. On 16 August, the Military Revolutionary Council supported 
Khath's bid for supreme power by electing him president in place of Maj 
General Duong Van Minh, who Was given a new position as supreme advisor 
to the MTC. This unilateral action produced large-scale student and 
Buddhist demonstrations. On 25 August, Khanh resigned, but the MRC was 
unable to select a successor and two days later named a triumvirate of 
provisional leaders, namely Major Generals Khanh, Minh, and Than Thien Khiam, 
which was designated as an interim ruling body pending transfer of authority 
to a civilian government. The triumvirate was ineffective and was replaced 
on 3 September with a 15-man leadership committee, which shortly after 
selected Khanh as acting premier and Minh as chairman of the leadership 
committee. In the US Mission assessment of the Saigon governmental con-
fusion, it was believed that Khath would probably stay in control but the 
governmental leaders were exhausted and would be hard pressed to maintain 
even an appearance of a valid government. (239) 
The rapid decline of the 'Math government's effectiveness provided the 
background to analyses of potential military actions which were discussed 
preparatory to a visit of Ambassador Taylor to Washington for an in-depth 
review of US policy. On 19 August, Taylor sent his deputy, U. Alexis 
Johnson, to Vientiane where Johnson conferred with Ambassadors Martin and 
Unger on the most effective means of eliminating the enemy infiltration 
infrastructure in the Lao panhandle, specifically barracks areas, storage 
warehouses, control points, and key bridges. The ambassadors were not 
optimistic, reasoning that VNAF and 1st Air Commando Squadron A-li were 
too heavily cammitted in Vietnam to perform the task and that additional 
T-28s should not be made available to the Lao air force because of a lack 
of trained Lao pilots. The only feasible means of knocking out the 
enemy targets was believed to be to use Yankee Team escorts in retalia-
tion for ground fire against reconnaissance e.irr.nft, but the -am':assadors 
did not recummend this because of the relatively small number of Yankee 
Team escorts available at Da Nang, ,he F-100s at rakhli and the F-105s at 
Karat being unavailable for the escort/strike mission into Labs because 
of Thai political restrictions which limited their employment in Laos to 
emergency search and rescue support. Although the ambassadors report 
was not sanguine, General Westmoreland directed the 2d Air Division to 
develop plans by 29 August which would reveal requirements needed to 
attack the 17 fixed installations and 5 key bridges identified as being 
significant to the infiltration through the panhandle. These operations 
plans involved the camplete details for six options of RLAF/USAF attack and 
two options of VNAF/Air Commando attack. This large task was completed as 
directed and forwarded to Washington, while on 24 August Ambassador 
Taylor chaired a long session of his Mission Council, which he had 
organized to include General Westmoreland, in discussions of US alterna-
tives in Vietnam, one question being what would be an incident that would 
appropriately warrant a reprisal. (2)40) On 31 August in Washington, 
Secretary McNamara asked the joint Chiefs for answers to three questions 
about the North Vietnam 94-target study. He wished to know whether enough

ordnance and POL would remain available in the theater to execute ayhase 
IV defense of Southeast Asia against Communist Chinese attack under CIITCPAC - 
Op Plan 32-64 after conducting a full scale attack against the 94 targets ? 
in North Vietnam. He also wanted valid estimates of the effect of each of 
the four patterns of attack on the North Vietnamese economy, on Hanoi's 
capability to support the Pathet Lao/Vietcong, and on North Vietnam Is 
ability to escalate through the use of North Vietnamese forces against South 
Vietnam and Laos. Finally, if the destruction of the 94 targets did not 
destroy Hanoils will and capability to wage war, he asked what course of 
action should be taken. Several months would be required to answer these 
knotty questions. (214) 
Early in September, discussions between Ambassador Tgylor, Secretaries 
Rusk and McNamara, and General Wheeler substantially revised Bundy's 
"Courses of Action for South Vietnam" and the resultant paper went to 
President Johnson on 8 September. The study generally accepted Taylorls 
views that the Government of Vietnam would be too weak in the next two 
or three months for the United States to undertake any major deliberate 
risks of escalation and that the Communists would probably avoid provoca-
tive actions against the United States. In order to assist South Vietnamese 
morale and to show the Communists that the United States still meant 
business (while at the same time keeping the risks low and under control), 
the paper recommended immediate resumption of US naval patrols in the Gulf  
of Tonkin be nd the 12-mil 1 t 
and the initia on o 
air strikes in the Laos panhandle. Finally, the United States should be 
prepared to respond on a tit-for-tat basis in the event of an attack on 
US personnel or a special enemy action against the South Vietnamese, but 
it should not deliberately provoke an incident in order to retaliate. (212) 
In the Joint Chiefs of Staff review of the Bundy paper on 8 September, 
General LeMgy pointed out that the recommendation would not convey a clear, 
positive signal to Hanoi of US resolution. The Marines also considered 
that in response to the next significant Communist act -- such as a 
battalion-size Vietcong attack -- the United States and South Vietnam 
should commence a retaliatory program against North Vietnam in accordance 
with the 94-target plan. (2L.3) Following discussions with Ambassador Taylor, 
President Johnson accepted the recommendations in the Bundy paper on 10 
September. The Presidential NSAM directed resumption of US naval 
as soon as Ambassador Tgylor returned to Saigon, resumption of 
operations after completion of the first DeSoto patrol, and the initiation 
of discussions with the Government of Laos for air and ground operations 
in the panhandle, it being understood that these operations would have 
limited effect. The first order of business was to strengthen the fabric 
of the Government of Vietnam.(244) 
The American efforts to strengthen the .Saigon government with limited 
actions met little success, nor were the actions apparently especially 
troubling to Hanoi. One of the major concerns during the governmental 
instability was that Khanh might lose control over the RVNAF and face a

military coup. This event occurred on 13 September, when Maj General 
Duong Van Due, the IV CTZ commander, led armored elements under his com-
mand to Saigon, where they occupied public buildings and disarmed the 
national police in a coup effort protesting Khanh's capitulation to 
Buddhist and student demands. In the emergency, Air Commodore Ky rallied 
the VNAF to Khanh's support. VNAF A-1Hs from Tan Son Nhut put on a 
show of force over Saigon; the US State Department announced firm support 
for the Khanh government; and the coup forces withdrew on 14 September. 
After the abortive coup, Khanh made sweeping changes in military cam-
menders. The appointment on 26 September of a High National Council, 
with a membership of 17 civilians and charged to draft a provisional 
constitution and designate a civil chief of state, outwardly appeared 
to be a step toward governmental stability, but a US Special National 
Intelligence Estimate on 1 October concluded that the South Vietnamese 
government had continued to decay during September and would not be 
greatly improved by a return to a nominally civil government. In the 
governmental anarchy, pacification efforts collapsed and the military 
staff in Saigon was unable to make decisions affecting needed changes in 
RVNAF directives. (2I) 
In accordance with ?resident Johnson's directive the US destroyers 
Morton and Edwards went into the Gulf of Tonkin on another DeSoto wtrol, 
and on the night of 17/18 Seotember the two ships reported and fired on 
radar contacts. In a 48-hour crisis and at JCS direction, CINCFAC 
issued a frag order for substantial reprisal air attacks against North 
Vietnam. In the process of getting out the order, targets and weapons 
were changed several times, with the result the 2d Air Division command 
post was swamped with orders and counter-orders. In the end, the frag order 
was not executed because the Navy was unable to find positive evidence 
that the North Vietnamese attack had occurred. Following the episode, the 
JCS directed CINCPAC to maintain a tactical readiness to execute immediate 
air strikes against preselected targets when naval patrols were in the 
Gulf of Tordciri, and C7707AC ,irg,ctod that at. such +-.imes the TfE",;et:-, 
Da Nang and Bien Hoa would be alerted and programned to attack Philo Yen 
airfield. After 17/18 September, Amb.assador Taylor saw no advantage in 
resuming the DeSoto patrols, except for essential intelligence purpDses. 
USAF RTI-47 Box Top electronic intelligence aircraft were committed to 
weekly flights over the Gulf of Tonkin, and DeSoto patrols were not resumed 
50X1 during 1964.(246) The operations were reactivated under tight US 
controls on h October, and during the month the coastal raids consisted 
of two shallow probes of the enemy defenses at Vinh, an unsuccessful 
effort to capture a junk, and a bombardment of the Vinh Son radar and 
Mui Dai observation post. At the appearance of the MIGs at Phuc Yen, 
there was some question whether the Duck Hook C-123s could continue to 
operate safely into North Vietnam, but the JCS Joint Staff believed they 
could in view of the fact that the MIGs were relatively short ranged, 
there was no GCI at this early date., and Communist radar warning ( hile  
extensive at higher altitudes) Was not effective below 3,000 feet.

In preparation for the Lao panhandle operations directed by President 
Johnson, US Mission representatives from Bangkok and Vientiane attended 
discussions at the Embassy in.Saigon on 11 September. At this time, the 
options began to narrow down to the single alternative of Lao T-28 
attacks with support from Yankee Team. Souvanna Phouma was reluctant to 
see VNAF participation in air strikes into Laos; moreover, earlier planned 
offensive South Vietnamese offensive guerrilla raids into Laos were initially 
limited by Ambassador Unger to shallow penetration raids to a depth of 20 
kilometers by company-sized units. When the Communists rather easily located 
and destroyed several eight-man Leaping Lena reconnaissance teams dropped 
into the Lao panhandle, General Westtoreland did not believe that offensive 
guerrilla cross-border ground operations could be begun before 1 January 
1965 at the earliest.(248) From a military viewpoint, it would be difficult 
for the T-28s to handle the Panhandle interdiction targets. The T-28s had 
to continue interdiction operations against the Plain of Jars and Route 7, 
and in August Communist flak emplacements got 57-mm weapons in addition 
to the lighter 37-mm pieces already operational. In an air rescue cover 
mission over the Plain of Jars on 14 August, the 36th Tactical Fighter 
Squadron made the first combat employment of USAF F-105D Thunderchief 
fighters when it undertook rocket and gun attacks against Communist gun 
emplacements. On this same cover mission, a 522d Squadron F-100 took a 
hit from the ground that forced the pilot to eject, but he was successfully 
picked up by an Air America H-34. On 18 August, a Lao T-28 was shot down 
over Route 7, and the North Vietnamese claimed that the T-28 had intruded 
across the border and also reported capture of the Thai pilot. At this 
juncture, General Harris was privately apprehensive that the Laotians were 
"getting in over their heads."(2)9) In September planning for the Lao 
panhandle interdiction attacks, 2d Air Division targeting indicated that 
the T.-28s could not safely be sent against a number of the more heavily 
defended objectives on the 22 target corridor interdiction list, and on 
30 September the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that US jets should 
participate in the corridor air strikes both because this was necessary 
against the harder targets and because the combined strikes could destroy 
the Communist facilities quickly before the North Vietnamese could disperse 
and hide them. Ambassadors Taylor aud Unger did not believe that the Lao 
government was likely to persist against the corridor infiltration targets 
unless there was US participation, but Unger wanted to use the Lao T-28s 
in most interdiction operations and felt a prolonged harassment was more 
desirable and would be more acceptable to Souvanna Phouma. He did agree, 
however, that the more difficult targets could be struck by American 
jets. (250) 
During September, 33 T-28s were available for combat in Laos PPH for 
training at Udorn, and in order to continue operations against the Plain 
of Jars and Route 7 and also pilot training while undertaking the addi-
tional corridor strikes, a JUSMAG conference in Bangkok on 1 October 
established a requirement for 40 T-248s, including 4 RT-28s and 4 T-28s 
for continued training. (251) In the division of effort, the Udorn-based, 
Thai-piloted T-28s continued to operate northward from Vientiane, while

General Ma's Lac-piloted T-280 were to operate from Savannakhet into 
southern Laos and the Panhandle. On 6 October a US State-Defense message 
authorized Ambassador Unger to urge the Lao government to begin air strikes 
over a period of several weeks against 13 of the 22 interdiction targets 
identified by the 2d Air Division in the Lao corridor. Unger was authorized 
to inform the Lao that Yankee Team suppressive fire strikes against the 
nine "difficult" targets could be anticipated later, but could not be 
authorized at the beginning of the program. In Washington on 13 October 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff reiterated that US jets should participate in 
the corridor strikes; on this same day, a State-Defense message authorized 
US combat air cover and search and rescue support for the RLAF but forbade 
any US air strikes against the corridor objectives. (2S2) 
At the request of the Lao government, Yankee Team jets flew uneventful 
high cover during the first three days of the T-28 corridor strikes when 
they began on 14 October, but there were no Communist aerial reactions 
and the CAP missions were discontinued. according to Lt Colonel Tyrrell's 
projections, the Savannakhet T-2s were capable of flying about 450 
combat sorties a month. aLd shoe one at Vient',.ahe had heard anythih 
about an plans for ground op:ras:.15 ti the ii.;a rlaiitary Region 
of southern Lacs it appeared ..hat the bulk of the Savannakhet sorties 
should be ayailabie to hit cc-.:ridcf interdiction targets. On October, 
Tyrrell went to Savannakhet and briefed. the Third Military Region 
Commander, General Bounpone, on the corridor interdiction program 
plans, and to Tyrrell's surprise Bounpone issued on the following day 
a very secret plan for Operation Victorious Arrow, an ambitious scheme 
envisioning that Southern Region troops would campaign eastward with 
T-28 air support, move along Route 9, recapture MUong Phine and ultimately 
Tchepone, thus closing the corridor infiltration routes. Bounpone 
expected that the ARVN 1st Division would help his operation by attack-
ing westward along Route 9, an eventuality that would prove optimistic. 
Tyr,,ell was puzzled by the s&derAv FR hut C7enereJ_ Ma 
told him that Bounpone was envious of The prestige gained by General 
Kouprasith as a rosalt of his in Operaion -triangle and wanted 
an equivalent victory. Operation .iotorious Arrow made little progress 
but consumed about half of the Savannakhet T-28 sorties. During October 
the Lao T-28 corridor strikes attacked 13 of the targets on the 22-
target list, plus three other similar targets located and cleared by 
Vientiane. Post-strike photegraphy revealed substantial damage to a few 
of the enemy installations, but most of them were lightly bombed and 
would require additional effort. The reconnaissance also showed that 
the North Vietnamese were rapidly dispersing. Moreover, the most signifi-
cant targets -- the troop barracks and a military area at Tchepone, another 
military area at Ban may, and the key read bridge at Nape where Route 8 
entered Laos through Nape pass -- were too strongly defended to permit 
T-28 attack. While the Lao T-28s were operating from Savannakhet, the 
Thai-piloted T-28s which staged through Vientiane generated about 350 
sorties a month in support of operations in northern Laos, including 
interdiction of Route 7, the short route from North Vietnam to the Plain 
of Jars. The Vientiane T-28s could not safely attack the prime interdiction

target, the road bridge near Ban Ken village, where Route 7 crossed the 
Nam Mat river. In July three unsuccessful T-28 strikes were flown 
against this target, and a T-28 was shot down during one of them. In 
October, night-flying RF-8A Yankee Team jets got visual sightings of 
heavy Communist truck traffic moving along Route 7, indicating that the 
Communists were intending to renew their offensive from the Plain of 
Jars. (253) 
6. Continuing Counterinsurgency Preparations in South Vietnam  
When Admiral Sharp ruled that air operations against North Vietnam 
would be controlled through CINCPACA.F and CINCPACFLT, he emphasized 
that General Westmoreland's principal responsibility as CamusmAcv would 
be to concentrate his energies in assisting the RVNAF in waging a 
successful counterinsurgency effort within South Vietnam. (254) Ironically, 
after the trials and errors of the 7..961-1964 counterinsurgency undertakings, 
the US military command in Saigon began to develop in mid-1964 concepts 
and force capabilities that might have been very useful in the earlier 
years, but which, in the autumn and winter of 1964, would be unable to 
cope with the paralyzing weakness of the Saigon government and overt 
North Vietnamese aggression, the latter manifested by heavy deliveries 
of modern weapons to the Vietcong and southward infiltration of regular 
North Vietnamese army units. In an important change from the earlier 
emphasis upon advisory assistance to RVNAF regular military forces and at 
higher unit levels, General Westmoreland's initial US force requirements 
proposals of 26 June and 21 July looked toward expansion of US military 
assistance to South Vietnam's politico-military provincial (sector) and 
district commanders as well as to lgwer-level RVNAF units. In South 
Vietnam's governmental organization, the South Vietnamese premier appointed 
military officers as province chiefs, and the province chiefs named subor-
dinate district chiefs. These officers were responsible for day-to-day 
governmental administration and commanded the regional and popular forces 
who did much of the fighting against the Vietcong, and were usually the 
principal objects of Vietcong aggression. In something of a change in 
CINCPAC policy, Admiral Sharp understood the significance of the provinces 
and districts to a counterinsurgency effort and agreed with Westmoreland's 
promise that US advisory efforts should be expanded at the district level, 
thus hopefully catalyzing the Vietnamese people to a higher tempo of 
pacification operations.(255) 
Although General Moore counted Westmoreland to be the "biggest booster" 
for tactical air support, (256) the initial MALT' requests for additional US 
aviation forces to support the expanded counterinsurgency effort during 
fiscal year 1965 ran strongly to US Army aviation and US Army aviation 
concepts. Citing the need to provide administrative and logistical support 
for 4,200 additional US lower level field advisors, including US advisory 
teams at 100 additional district headquarters, Westmoreland requested 
augmented air transport to include a fourth 0-123 squadron which would 
perform "wholesale" airlift under the Southeast Asia Airlift System, 
a second US Army Caribou ccanpany to handle "retail" airlift within corps

areas outside the SEAAS, two additional US Army air mobile helicopter 
companies (50 UH-lBs), and two additional air mobile platoons (20 UH-lBs). 
Some of the additional UH-lBs were to be used for command and control and 
the others were to be armed helicopter gunships. Analysis of Westmoreland's 
requirements at PAC' indicated a legitimate need for the additional C-123 
squadron since the Vietcong were beginning an effective interdiction of 
South Vietnam's surface transportation. In July, as will be seen in more 
detail, the 0-123 capability to handle requirements was already saturated 
and it was necessary to bring C-130s of the 315th Air Division into South 
Vietnam to help with SEAAS airlift. PACAF supported the requirement for 
the 16 C-123s but asserted that the additional Caribou company would not 
be needed if the Caribou company already in Vietnam were placed under 
central control of the SEAAS for efficient common use. Already concerned 
about the Moore-Oden agreement which recognized a ?complementary" require-
ment for armed helicopters and tactical air support, General LeMay strongly 
objected to the introduction of additional less-effective and potentially 
vulnerable helicopter gunships into Vietnam and argued that, if more 
aerial firepower were needed, proper arrangements should be made to increase 
fixed-wing air support. In JCS discussions, LeMay and the Commandant of 
the US Marine Corps asked for additional justifications of the MACV re-
quirements for Army aviation, out on 7 August Secretary McNamara irected 
that Westmoreland's list of requirements would be provided to him. (27) 
As will be seen, the aircraft for the additional squadron of USAF C-123s 
were withdrawn from the Air Force Reserve and were flown to Tan Son Nhut 
by rotating replacement crews beginning on 17 September, and the 19th Air 
Commando Squadron, Troop Carrier, was organized and aseLgned to the 315th 
Troop Carrier Group effective on 8 October 1964. On 10 August a Royal 
Australian Air Force detachment with six Caribous arrived at Tan Son Nhut 
and made its aircraft available to the SEAAS, but the additional US Army 
Caribou company was not placed under operational control of the Southeast 
Asia Airlift System. (258) 
Even though the MACV requirements for additional aviation were met, 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Queried General Westmoreland on II August 
about the prospective continued employment of armed helicpters, a matter 
which was of interest at high level since the Department of ArrPj on 
1 August proposed to develop an advanced aerial fire support system 
helicopter. The MACV response to JCS questions made on 19 August asserted 
that armed helicopters had many advantages over fixed-wing air support. 
The 2d Air Division critique of the MACV response considered that many 
of the alleged advantages of the armed helicopter were not valid, and 
the continuing discussion consumed a great amount of intellectual staff 
effort for the purpose of "getting on record" -- effort that Colonel Allison 
C. Brooks thought could have better been applied to a consideration of 
the increasingly desperate combat situation in South Vietnam (29) Where 
the MACV response was a hearty endorsement of armed helicopters, Westmoreland 
did not neglect tactical aviation. For the first time, MACV critiques 
of ARVN operations began to point out frequently missed opportunities 
where tactical air support could have been applied against the enemy. 
Citing a battle on 19 August in Phu Yen province when three ARVN

battalions attacked a Vietcong force of about 500 men without once calling 
for air support, the MACV critique commented that "the major fault was 
the lack of employment of air support."(260) Where earlier counterinsurgency 
pundits has posited that air strikes were apt to be counterproductive 
to pacification, Westmoreland was impressed with the informed findings 
of the Research and Development (RAND) Corporation analyst, Leon Goure, 
who concluded after interviews with Vietcong prisoners that the adverse 
effects of air strikes on pacification were much less than originally 
assumed. Goure also determined that the Vietcong greatly feared the 
liaison aircraft because they were frequently spotters for strike air-
craft. (261) 
One of the more fortunate aspects of the MACV's justification of a 
requirement for additional helicopter firepower was to focus attention 
upon the lack of tactical strike aircraft and liaison planes, a combined 
shortage which General Moore in August stated was the most important 
limiting factor to countering the insurgency. Although USAF A-lEs 
were kept operational in July through the mandate that they could be 
employed in the expedited training of VNAF pilots, the training program 
was conducted at a cost of approximately one-fourth of the total strike 
fighter capability that would otherwise_have been available in Vietnam. 
As initiated in July, A-1 transition comprised three phases. In Phase 
1 at Bien Hoa, the 1st Air Commando Squadron provided ground schools, 
introduced the Vietnamese pilots to the log-1 aircraft, and allowed the 
Vietnamese to fly the planes to and from Bien Hoa and combat targets. 
The USAF instructor pilot in the fully instrumented left seat of the A-1E 
delivered the ordnance and landed the plane, and the Vietnamese student 
taxied the A-1 to the parking ramp. After 10 such indoctrination flights, 
the Vietnamese pilots were transferred to Phase II transition training 
conducted by the US Navy VA-152 Squadron's Detachment Z, which possessed 
4 A-1Es borrowed from the 1st Air Cannando Squadron and 15 A-ills that 
had arrived in Vietnam on MAP assignment to the VNAF 516th Squadron. In 
this phase, VA-152 provided a traipse four rides in the dual-position 
A-1Es and then attempted to solo him in a single position A-1H. After 
a month's trial this schedule was changed since the Vietnamese pilots 
proved unable to handle the A-ills without additional preliminary instruc-
tion. In August the 1st Air Commando Squadron took back its four A-1Es 
and began a new training program. Phase I remained a two-week, 10-flight 
familiarization, but a new Phase IA was added wherein the 1st Air Cannando 
Squadron gave the students 24 hours of dual instruction and prepared 
them for a final one-hour solo flight. Phase II training was reduced 
from five to four weeks. After this, Phase III was conducted by the 
34th Tactical Group for a period of eight weeks of combat operations. (262) 
During the months of July through September 1964, the ASOCs received 
3553 requests for air support but were Able to honor only 2403, 918 of 
the requests not honored being attributable to a lack of aircraft.(263) 
Because of training requirements only 8 of the 29 A-lEs possessed by 
the 1st Air Commando Squadron were available for 12 combat sorties a 
day, and only an average of 30 of the VNAF A-ills were available for 
36-45 combat sorties. (2614) The situation was quite serious within the

CTZs. Thus the III ASOC on an average day in September received an 
allocation of 8 A-1H and 12 A-1E sorties for employment, and, in addition 
to the smallness of the allocation, the A-1E sorties had to be flown 
on a time schedule demanded by training and were not available for 
scrambles against targets of opportunity. (265) In the II CTZ only 5 
A-IHs on deployment from Da Nang to Pleiku were normally available for 
strikes, and only 3-4 of these were usually operational on a given day. (266) 
In addition to the scarcity of combat sorties, the Vietnamese pilots did 
not like the Phase III training, which was hazardous in the combat environ-
ment. The let Air Commando Squadron had a series of eight aircraft crashes, 
at least two known to have been caused by hostile ground fire, these on the 
night of 23 September when two A-lEs, on a low level napalm pass in the 
Delta, were silhouetted by flares and caught in barrage fire. After this, 
the 34th Group discontinued use of napalm on night support missions, but 
VNAF was greatly disturbed by the loss of Vietnamese pilots when flying 
with Americans and wanted out of the combat training phase. (267) 
Because of the lack of strike aircraft General Moore recommended in 
August that VNAF be authorized a fifth and sixth A-IH squadron and that 
arrangements be made to employ USAF jets that were at Bien Hoa and Da 
Nang for in-country air support. On 26 August, MATT forwarded the recom-
mendation for the organization of the fifth and sixth VNAF A-1H squadrons, 
which would not be practicable, however, before the last half of 1965. At 
its meeting on 2 September the Joint Chiefs of Staff gave in-depth con-
sideration to lagging tactical air support in Vietnam. During the following 
week, President Johnson was unwilling to authorize employment of B-57s or 
F-100s in Vietnam, but Ambassador Taylor agreed that it was possible to 
delete the requirement for a bona fide Vietnamese trainee pilot aboard 
A-1E combat missions. As a result of these developments, the Joint 
Chiefs recommended that USAF A-1Es be authorized to engage in combat 
with a VNAF observer when a Vietnamese pilot was, not available. 
McNamara's initial reaction was informally reported to be "entirely 
negative," but on 25 September he was willing to allow USAF A-1E combat 
operations with either a Vietnamese observer or student pilot aboard. 
The Joint Chiefs made another effort to secure an authority whereby a 
USAF crew could respond to an immediate air support request, but 
Ambassador Taylor responded that this would open the door to a wide use 
of American crews, and McNamara agreed. On 14 October, the Joint Chiefs 
accordingly allowed the rule of engagement to revert to the status prior 
to 10 May 1964, thus authorizing A-1E combat operations with either a 
VNAF pilot or observer. On 15 October the Joint Chiefs also recommended 
that VNAF should expand to a fifth A,.1H squadron in May 1965 and to a 
sixth A-1H squadron in October 1965 and that two USAF A-1E squarirons 
would be required until the sixth VNAF fighter squadron was operational. (268) 
In the last quarter of 1965 both the USAF 34th Tactical Group and the 
VNAF gained additional strike fighter capabilities, though not as much as 
had been projected. The USAF 602d Fighter Commando Squadron was organized 
under the 34th Group on 12 October and began to build personnel and air-
craft strength. The fourth VNAF fighter squadron -- the 520th was 
organized at Bien Hoa in October and was slated to move to the new

Can Tho airbase when this facility became serviceable. Because of the 
political crisis in Saigon, VNAF refused to transfer C-47 pilots to 
A-1 transition training, thus contributing to a shortfall in the 
projected manning of Vietnamese fighter squadrons on a 2:1 pilot: 
cockpit ratio. On 5 November, Colonel P. O. Suu, Commander of the VNAF 
23d Tactical Wing, newly organized at Bien Hoa, assigned 26 Vietnamese 
airmen to the 34th Group and at the same time informed Colonel Bethea 
that Vietnamese pilots would be glad to continue to train with Americans 
but would no longer "sit in the right seat in flight as before." By the 
end of November, 160 Vietnamese A-1 pilots were trained and the expedited 
transition program ended. Detachment Z of VA-152 departed Vietnam on 29 
November, and the 34th Group became responsible for transitioning VNAF 
trainees received from the United States, this program requiring 90 hours 
of A-1E transition and all training missions except two to be flown by 
the Vietnamese student from the left:seat. With a student pilot in control, 
these A-1E sorties could not safely be used for combat purposes. Moreover, 
the Vietnamese "observers" proved generally irresponsible (part of them 
usually being in jail or AWOL on aw,given day), and this limited 34th 
Group combat sorties. In early December, Colonel Bethea was producing 
about 50 A-1 sorties a day, of which only about 17 could be made avail-
able to the AOC for combat purposes. The 34th Group found the A-is 
admirable in combat but difficult to:maintain, chiefly because of in-
flight engine failures. Where the 34th Group managed to keep 80 percent 
of its A-1ES operational in November 1964, the VNAF was hard hit by poor 
maintenance and had only 58 percent of its A-1Hs in operation. The VNAF 
516th Squadron was even more vexed by the problem of maintaining its 
A-1Hs; it possessed an average of 15,aircraft in December, but its sortie 
rate was only 6.18 aircraft a Tho now VNAF 520th Squadron commenced 
limited operations in December, but construction was lagging at new Can 
Tho (now, called Binh Thuy airfield) and the field was insecure at night. 
On 20 December the 520th Squadron began daily deployments of five A-IHs 
to Binh Thuy where the pilots were on call for air support missions during 
the day but for safety's sake returned to Bian Hoa before nightfall.(269) 
As will be seen, the VNAF used its A-1 training to good stead in 
critical operations during December but it was nevertheless true that 
VNAF-USAF A-1 strike capabilities increased only slowly in the last 
half of 1964, as shown in the following chart:

In addition to other problems, the diversion of VNAF sorties to "coup 
duty" reduced combat capabilities; thus in October the A-1Hs flew 659 
combat and 496 combat support sorties, most of the latter comprising 
show of force air patrols over Saigon. In the months of October through 
December 1964 air support missions flown again lagged behind mission 
requests: the ASOCs received 3,466 requests for air support, Of which 
1,122 could not be honored because of a lack of available aircraft. In 
addition to the requests turned-down, many air support missions flown 
were limited to flights of two aircraft. Over 90 percent of the targets 
attacked in the I CTZ, for example, were hit by two A-ls -- two for an 
enemy battalion, two for a training center, two for a platoon. (270) 
Despite 2d Air Division efforts to secure the development of new 
concepts of USAF Forward Air Controller/Strike Control and Reconnaissance 
(FAC/SCAR) functions as necessary to counterinsurgency, these functions 
required large numbers of pilots to crew 0-1 liaison planes and had not 
been approved. At mid-1964 the USAF 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron 
was slated to inactivate and turn its 0-1Fs over to the VNAF 116th 
Liaison Squadron which was to be activated. Anxious to retain the i9th 
TASS, General Moore included a recommendation in the 2d Air Division 
study concerning the expansion of VNAF approved by MACV on 28 May that 
the USAF liaison squadron would be retained. When Colonel Bethea took 
command of the 34th Group in mid-June he was told of the plans to 
inactivate the 19th TASS, but he was instructed to drag his feet on the 
matter as long as possible. Although the VNAF Direct Air Request System 
was being installed, the 2d Air Division ALO/FACs in the field emphasized 
that the forward air control function could not practicably be performed 
by a tactical air control party on the ground. When Admiral Sharp forwarded 
the VNAF expansion study, he deleted the requirement to retain the 19th 
TASS and reported that it would phase out as scheduled. As a result, 
USAF disassembled personnel support for the 0-1 squadron all tha way 
back through the pipeline, including combat crew training for 0-1 
aircraft, and effective on 8 August PACAF issued orders inactivating 
the 19th TASS.(271) At this time, however, a Washington fact-finding 
team both in debriefings for General Westmoreland and in its final report 
stressed that the field requirements for 0-1 liaison aircraft far exceeded 
availability of aircraft and asserted that USAF ALO/FACs frequently could 
not perform their duties because of the scarcity of liaison aircraft. On 
11 August, Westmoreland expressed surprise to Sharp that the 19th TASS 
was being inactivated and asked that it be retained. He recommended that 
U-17A aircraft be purchased to equip the VNAF 116th Liaison Squadron. 
This recommendation was formally reported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and was approved by Secretary McNamara on 25 Sptember.(272) 
The reversal of the high-level decision to phase-out the 19th TASS 
left the squadron in limbo. Until the pipeline support for the 19th 
TASS could be restored, the 34th Group had 24 0-1F aircraft and only 
12 liaison pilots, three of wham would shortly complete their tours. A 
detachment of 0-1Fs remained at Bien Hoa to provide operational training

for newly graduated Vietnamese liaison pilots arriving from the training 
center at Nha Trang, but 10 0-1Fs required employment, and Colonel Bethea 
placed these planes on permanent deOloyment to the ASOCs to be flown by 
ALO/FACs.(273) At the same time tha the 0-1s were farmed out, a combi-
nation of favorable circumstances laid the grundwork for the beginnings 
of continuous visual surveillance bT TISAF FAC o in coordination with pro-
vince and district chiefs, something itat had not proven practicable 
earlier. In May, Major Alan G. Nelsr)n, the ALO to the ARVN 9th Division, 
had proposed an experimental positivi! visual reconnaissance plan for lanh 
Binh province at the mouth of the Mekong, and, in July, 2d Air Division 
operations analysts found merit in the proposition and advocated that it 
be tested. (27L) On 21 September an 0-1 and a VNAF observer were assigned 
to Captain Lloyd E. Lewis, the USAF FAC with the ARVN 14th Regiment at 
Tra Vinh, and Captain Lewis began to fly the plane on day-long surveil-
lance missions in cooperao_aon -,7ith the Virh Einh province commander. 
The test snowed that VisounR L!tivivr ar-.7eciaby decreased., offensive 
ground action was more eff,ct:v% with fewer friend:1.v casualties, inter-
diction targeting and air strikts were more effective. (27) 
While the Vinh Binh l,est wa.; undirway in September, the 2d Air 
Division operations and intellience directorates received "Top Dog" 
personnel augmentations, and a ,Selected Counterinsurgency Air Target 
(SCAT) working group was formed to gd_ve some sustained thought to a 
more profitable employment of aoAer. The working group soon determined 
that the old SCAT program had 10,T its original utility: preplanned 
SCAT targets had been generated T VI and by the time that they might 
be hit the intelligence was t.;ree or, f)ur weeks old, with the result that 
if the enemy had been at CTe r2perted he had probably 
moved before an air attac took n1/2cy Analysis of cast operations 
showed that the ins-argenc had Le ea 7eIcent small ,ctions with fleet-
ing targets (ambushes, namlet lnd ea-t attacks, road blockades) and 
only 5 percent large scale onerataens, The SCAT working group recommended 
a maximum exploitation of continuel:,s: Ti:ual reconnaissance, and the 
establishment of active target n,:' eenters at the TOC/A.SOC level in each 
CTZ headquarters, similar t, the kt centec that was in existence 
at the III CTZ headquarters.(275 
In the same months that the orleticoili,:y oi the employment of USAF 
ALO/FACs to provide continuous isual roconnalssance and strike control 
was being examined, two RAND ana'r,t, William R. Graham and Amron H. 
Katz, were in Southeast Ar,la on t&ary dut,r from 26 June through 
6 October gathering data for a now ceunterinF;Irgency concept which they 
described as the "Single :ntegretei Attnck Tem,i' the name reflecting

recognition that the SLAT concept was more applicable to insurgency than 
to the field warfare that the Vietcong were beginning to wage in Vietnam, 
the Graham-Katz study was well received and did much to hasten conceptual 
approval for a USAF airborne FAC/SCAR function. General Westmoreland 
wished to accept as much of the SIAT proposal as possible. The 19th TASS 
was reactivated at Bien Hoa on 21 October, and MACV recommended to CINCPAC 
that the unit equipment for the 19th TASS and the four VNAF liaison 
squadrons should be increased to 30 aircraft in each squadron. (277) 
At a later time, an airborne USAF Forward Air Controller (FAC) would 
work in close association with friendly ground troops and an airborne USAF 
Strike Control and Reconnaissance (SCAR) controller would be associated with 
aerial interdiction, but at the inception in 1964 the USAF FAO/SCAR program 
was intimately related to the VNAF Air Request System, which the 2d Air 
Division was installing in a phased development that paralleled the buildup 
of VNAF fighter forces. Following the initial installation and manning of 
the VNAF Air Request Net in the III CTZ and 7th Division area, the system 
was installed and manned in the IV CTZ in August. Arrival of 20 USAF FACs 
on temporary duty from sTRIcor on 25 3eptember faoilitated establishment 
of VNAF Air Request Nets in the I and II CTZs during October and November, 
the installation of the countrywide syStem being counted as com7lete on 
1 December. At this time 50 USAF ALO/FACs, 17 AL0s, and the four ASOCs 
were provided radio equipment and operators to make the system work. In 
addition to the USAF personnel, VNAF continued to provide eight recent 
liaison pilot graduates as ALOs in the III CTZ, men who were not qualified 
for the duties expected of them. (278) 
Before General Moore commenced the installation and manning of the 
expensive VNAF Air Request System, he had agreement from the FTNAF 
Joint General Staff that a directive would be isEued making use; of the 
system mandatory and that VNAF would begin to provide qualified Vietnamese 
ALO/FACs to serve as counterparts to USAF personnel. Following the unsuc-
cessful September coup against him, General Khanh made sweenin chnges 
in the JGS and in field commanders, and the new men were not a party tO 
the initial agreement with General Moore and were unfamiliar with the Air 
Request System. During October and November a USAF Air-Ground Operations 
School briefing team made a countrywide circuit, explaining the time-
saving features of the Air Request System, and, on 27 October, General 
Rowland requested Ky to use his influence to get acceptance for the 
system. At this same time a MACV survey team visited the CTZs to get 
information that might convince the RVNAF to order the system used, 
and Maj General Richard Stilwell requested the RVNAF Chief of Staff 
to accept the VNAF Air Request Net, to provide VNAF personnel to man 
it, to disperse VNAF 0-1As to forward operating locations, and to 
authorize persons other than VNAF air observers to mark targets. These 
efforts were fruitless. The ARVN field commanders would not permit 
themselves to be by-passed in requests for air strike support. Neither 
VNAF nor ARVN were willing to assume the responsibility under the 
Vietnamese civil law for mistakes that the other might make in marking 
targets for strike aircraft, and VNAF strike pilots refused to accept 
targets unless they were designated by a VNAF air observer. VNAF also 
demurred at deploying its 0-1A planes and crews on permanent location

at forward airstrips, citing lack of security from guerrillas, logistical dif-
ficulty in supporting deployed aircraft and crews, and loss of control over 
the planes and crews at remote sites. (279) 
In a progression of planning for a full development of the PAC/SCAR 
function, the 2d Air Division conceived requirements for additional 
TACPs who would be located with Viethamese province chiefs, thus 
connecting the province-district radio nets into the VNAF Air Request 
System, and for three additional USAF 0-1F squadrons to provide an 
adequate number of air vehicles for a dispersed countrywide FAC/SCAR 
program. Tests of hand-held cameras showed that the 0-1 crews could 
secure photographs of Vietcong targets which were of value to intelligence 
and to mission planning. (280) The FAC/SCAR program could not be implemented, 
however, unless the RVNAF would accept it, and the Office of Secretary 
of Defense was reluctant to accept additional American commitments in 
South Vietnam until the political confusion cleared up. On 6 November, 
Secretary McNamara approved the JCS recommendation for the expansion of 
VNAF to a fifth and sixth fighter squadron. The Office of Secretary of 
Defense also approved the MACV recammendation that the VNAF liaison 
squadrons be expanded to a unit equiPment of 30 aircraft, this by MAP 
deliveries of 68 0-1As and U-17As in March through May 1965. On 
6 December the Office of Secretary of Defense also indicated that the 
expansion of the 19th TASS to 30 0-1Ft would probably be approved in 
the future, but a decision on the matter would be delayed until the 
political situation in Saigon settled dawn.(281) As a result of the 
indecision about its future, the manning of the 19th TAM was down to 
seven airmen and nine pilots in Decakber, when it finally received eight 
single-engine pilots who would have to be checked out in 0-1s. Because 
of combat attrition the 19th TASS alto urgently needed five additional 
0-1s to bring it back up to its old authorized unit equipment strength 
of 22 aircraft and to provide three planes for attrition and maintenance 
fleet.(282) The VNAF liaison squadrons possessed only 60 of 120 authorized 
0-1As and U-17As.(283) In the critical fighting the winter of 1964-1965, 
FAC aircraft were in very short supply. In the embattled II CTZ, for 
example, all airstrikes were controlled with only four available 0-1 
FACs. In view of the scarcity of aircraft and higher priorities which 
had to be given to forward air control and convoy escort, it was 
impossible to implement the sustained air surveillance concept. (28L) 
In the first flush of enthusiasm for the new counterinsurgency mission 
in January 1962, the Farm Gate detachment had visualized many new ideas 
for inflicting maximum casualties among dispersed guerrillas in extremes 
of terrain varying from flat marshy land to dense jungle. Among the new 
concepts, Farm Gate envisioned the development of a lightweight, small 
caliber, high-rate-of-fire gun which could be fired from C-47s and C-123s 
(as well as Army helicopters and light aircraft) and the use of free-
falling "Lazy Dog" weapons for night hamlet defense. (28S) Employment 
of newly developed Air Force cluster bomb units also appeared worth 
tests in a counterinsurgency environment. (286) Tests of Lazy Dog and 
CBUs were not pressed since experiments at Eglin Air Force Base indicated

that they would not penetrate jungle cover very well, and in addition 
Admiral Felt wished to hold these weapons in reserve for a more serious 
national emergency than Vietnam.(287) Because of distractions to the 
combat effort produced by service testing in Vietnam during 1963, General 
LeMay also followed a policy that tests ought to be conducted in a 
controlled environment in the United States. The fact that the Joint 
Operational Evaluation Group Vietnam and its successor MACV Joint Research 
and Test Activity (JRATA) were headed by US Army generals and dominated 
by US Army Officers contributed to the Air Force reluctance to conduct 
tests in Vietnam. (288) By August 1964, however, USAF Research and Develop-
ment had produced a number of new weapons which had been tested by the 
USAF Special Air Warfare Center and were believed ready for operational 
suitability evaluation. After a visit to Vietnam a USAF munitions survey 
team recommended that modern ordnance should be programmed to complement 
and eventually replace the older ordnance being employed in Vietnam. (289) 
In September, moreover, Vietcong ground fire was seriously hazarding 
low flying aircraft on napalm runs, and the loss of the two A-is to enemy 
ground fire while making low-level napalm passes on the night of 23 
September demanded a new approach to hamlet defense. In a quick change 
in tactics, 2d Air Division ruled that fragmentation clusters would be 
substituted for napalm on night flare-assisted missions and that fighters 
would deliver this ordnance from a dive, thus minimizing the time that 
they would be illuminated by flares. The frag attacks could not be 
delivered too close to a defense position, and it was, evident that some 
better approach to night defense was required. (290) 
During September the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Admiral Sharp released 
the Mark-44 Lazy Dog for use in Vietnam and the CBU-2 for prospective 
out-of-country employment, and USAF requested operational suitability 
tests for several munitions, including rapid-fire 7.62-mm gatling gun 
pods that could be installed either on the racks of an k-1 or mounted 
and fired from the side cargo doors of an orbiting C-47. The USAF 1st 
Combat Application Group had devised and run tests on a three-gun, side-
firing installation in a C-47 at Eglin Air Force Base. In view of the 
long interest in Lazy Dog, test drops were begun with little delay. 
As will be seen, Lazy Dog (also nicknamed "ELEA") showed initial promise, 
but continuing analyses revealed that the free-falling finned bullets 
were relatively ineffective in vegetated terrain. Moreover, the fins 
on the small projectiles easily bent out of shape when they were loaded 
into the dispensers in which they were dropped, resulting in missiles 
tumbling and being relatively ineffective. The variations in the size 
and shape of the pattern of the falling projectiles was also unpredictable, 
precluding use of Lazy Dog as the expected substitute for napalm when 
enemy and friendly forces were relatively close to each other.(291) Other 
new weapons also failed to demonstrate full reliability. When installed 
and tested on A-ls, a new XM-70 pod for launching 40-mm grenades initially 
appeared to have promise as an antipersonnel weapon, but the feed system 
frequently malfunctioned and the system was thus not reliable. Moreover, 
at the same time that the grenade launcher was under test, the old 2.75-
inch aerial rocket, previously minimized in use because it buried in the

ground before exploding, was restored to operational use by a new warhead 
and XM-427 super quick graze action fuze. A new Vestco" mix of napalm 
incendijel proved stable in storage, andaddition of stabilizing fins to 
napalm tanks allowed aircraft to deliver the munition in a dive bomb mode, 
thus avoiding small arms fire and also driving the bomb through jungle 
canopy. In such tactics, however, the fire pattern was small and left 
a long burning incendiary puddle in the impact crater, and the optimum 
napalm delivery continued to be the low level spash attack. In the effort 
to maximize antipersonnel weapons effects, the 2d Air Division was unable 
to get reliable results with variable-time (VT) radar proximity fuzed 
general purpose bombs, and fell back on a time-worn "daisy cutter" technique 
whereby nose-fuze extenders were attached to bombs to produce a waist-high 
explosion. (292) 
In this same season of active weapons tests, PACAF and the Tactical 
Air Command were reluctant to see the minigun-equipped C-47 tested in 
combat since it was an obsolete plane, which might be very vulnerable to 
enemy ground fire and in any event would not be anything more than a 
palliative for the lack of sufficient numbers of strike fighters. In 
Washington, however, General John P. McConnell, the USAF Vice Chief 
(who would succeed General LeMay as Chief of Staff on 1 February 1965) 
agreed that an armed C-47 would be a highly specialized weapon that 
would probably be useful only in a very permissive environment, but, on 
the other hand, McConnell reasoned that a C-47 could fly long-duration 
night alert missions and could quickly respond to Communist surprise 
attacks. McConnell believed that the C-47 could keep high enough to 
remain above the range of Communist small arms and could pin down the 
enemy with its miniguns until strike aircraft could arrive. The armed 
C-47 would thus help compensate for the inability of the insufficient 
numbers of strike aircraft and the consequent impracticability of night 
fighter airborne alerts. On 2 November, General LeMay was briefed on 
the armed C-47 and directed an immediate combat evaluation. Early in 
December a test team equipped two 34th Group C-47s with miniguns, and 
the first combat mission was flown on 15 December. The armed C-47s 
were an almost instant success in night missions against enemy troops 
in the open. The C-47 pilot had an improvised gunsight, and by putting 
his wing down in a maneuver like a "pylon 8" he could direct fire from 
the three miniguns mounted in the left-hand cargo door very accurately. 
The. guns spewed out their small caliber bullets at a rate of 18,000 
rounds a minute into a field of fire about the size of a football field. 
Each gun was served by an aerial gunner who could clear jams and reload 
the gun pods in flight. The light miniguns were ineffective against 
material and the small caliber bullets were easily deflected in wooded 
terrain, but the AC-47 gunships proved outstanding for night fort and 
hamlet defense. Awed by the stream of tracers, the Vietcong referred 
to the new "ray gun" being employed against them.(293)

integrated air reconnaissance system fully responsible to users' require-
ments did not develop in Southeast Asia during 1964. In the employment 
of air forces the lack of a coordinated air reconnaissance-intelligence 
program aimed at development and maintenance of a target system fully 
responsive to the forces committed to destroy the targets was a most 
serious limitation. In General Moore's analysis, the air reconnaissance 
effort was fractionalized to support both in-country and out-of-country 
combat and planning efforts and did not fully meet tactical requirements 
in either area. (29t) While many factors were involved, the USAF Tactical 
Air Reconnaissance Center placed much of the blame for the failures of 
air reconnaissance upon the absence of senior air officers, knowledgeable 
in the field of air reconnaissance, in positions of appropriate influence, (29S) 
At the beginning of 1964 the 2d Air Division's reconnaissance 
capabilities consisted of six Able Mable RF-101s, two Patricia Lynn 
RB-57s, two Sweet Sue RB-26s, and two Black Watch RB-26Cs, plus the 
13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron. In the command organization 
the aircraft detachments were under operational control of Detachment 
1, 33d Tactical Group at Tan Son Nhut, and the Able Mable RF-IC1 
commander served as operations officer of Detachment 1. This arrange-
ment placed the experimental infrared photography activities of Sweet 
Sue and Patricia Lynn and the night photo operations of Black Watch 
under an RF-101 officer who was not necessarily familiar with the 
operational capabilities of these aircraft. (296) The 13th RTS was in 
process of developing from a mediocre photo processing center (PPC), 
and it was assigned to the 33d Tactical Group, although under opera-
tional supervision of the 2d Air Division Director of Intelligence, 
who prepared the effectiveness reports of the commander of the 13th RTS. 
The command assignment of the 13th RTS to the 33d Tactical Group, was 
awkward, and the 13th RTS commander found himself training men who 
were freely transferred to other units at Tan Son Nhut by the base 
commander.(297) As has been seen, Colonel Harvey Henderson, 2d Air 
Division Deputy Commander during 1963, recommende,1 consolidation of the 
fragmentary RF-101, RB-26, and RB-57 into a USAF tactical reconnaissance 
squadron under an experienced "Mr. Reconnaissance," but this proposal 
would have caused USAF to exceed its authorized unit force levels. Under 
2d Air Division plans to phase out of South Vietnam, moreover, the USAF 
reconnaissance activities were programmed to reduce rather rapidly as 
the VNAF 716th Composite Reconnaissance Squadron became combat opera-
tional with three RC-47s and 18 RT-28s, plus locally responsive PPCs in 
the four CTZs. The three VNAF Re-47s began to fly daily photo missions 
in November, and by 10 January the 716th Squadron appeared to be making 
substantial progress since it possessed 10 photographic configured T-28s 
and would receive the other eight RT-28s later in the month. The pro-
grammed operational ready date was I March 1964 although it was probable 
that difficulties with the camera installations would extend this date 
to about 1 July. The 2d Air Division planned that 716th Squadron air-
craft would be deployed to the CTZs where they would work with the local 
PPCs. As the 716th Squadron reached its planned capability of 374 
sorties a month, Able Mable RF-101s would be phased out, and the 2d Air 
Division also conceived that the local deployments of VNAF photo recon-
naissance would eliminate any need for retention of the six US Army

Mohawk armed photo reconnaissance planes in Vietnam, one of which was 
shot down and destroyed during a low-level reconnoiter on the Ca Mau 
peninsula on 10 January. (298) 
During the spring of 1964, the 2d Air Division reconnaissance projec-
tions were buffeted by unforeseen events. In his meetings in Saigon 
and Hawaii late in 1963, Secretary McNamara directed a major aerial 
reconnaissance effort of South Vietnams borders, and, without prior 
knowledge of CINCPACAF, Strategic Air Command Lucky Dragon U-2 aircraft 
arrived at Bien Hoa to provide very high altitude photo flights over 
Southeast Asia. Although the 13th RTS occupied new facilities that had 
been under construction for it at Tan Son Nhut, the large amount of photo-
graphy generated by Lucky Dragon and Able Mable in the expanded recon-
naissance effort could not be handled by the still-developing 13th RTS 
and a large part of it had to be processed by PACAF, SAC, and US Navy 
facilities located in the PhilippineTslands and Japan. The U-2 
photography was of vital importance to national strategic planning, but 
the very small scale photographs had limited value for tactical uses. (299) 
The second-phase analysis and the film library of Trojan Horse photography 
would continue to be at the US Navy facility at Cubi Point making it 
impractical to use the 13-2 photos for comparative purposes with other 
reconnaissance photography available in Saigon. (220) The collapse of B-26 
serviceability led to the removal of the RB-26s from Vietnam at the end 
of March, reducing 2d Air Division night photographic capabilities. In 
addition to this unforeseen development, the VNAF reconnaissance program 
met unexpected difficulties. As has been seen, 47 armed some of the 
RT-28s with rocket rails for use as a counter-coup force. Based at Tan 
Son Nhut, the RC-47s and RT-28s were usable, in any event, only to cover 
targets only in the III and IV CTZs and in the southern part of II CTZ. 
When the RT-28s were ready for deployment to the ASOCs, VNAF protested 
that the relocation of the families of the crews and the lack of support 
for the aircraft at CTZ stations made the move uneconomical. Although 
a PPC was opened at Da Nang and was used for a short time by a locally 
deployed RB-26, it fell into disuse when the RB-26s were withdrawn and 
VNAF failed to deploy to Da Nang. (300) As a result of expedited Air Force 
Logistics Cammand technical assistance, the Patricia Lynn RB-57 infrared 
photographic systems were operational in April, but the ability of the 
infrared equipment to locate Cammunist night activity by heat-source 
imagery was not being utilized by MACV intelligence because procedures 
had not been worked out to exploit the infrared photography. (301) 
The US national decision in May to institute air reconnaissance 
flights over Laos for politico-military reasons, together with Secretary 
McNamarals direction that VNAF RT-28 pilots would be retrained to man a 
fourth VNAF A-1H squadron, suddenly and substantially changed to whole 
Southeast Asia reconnaissance program. The existing six Able Mable 
RF-101s were augmented with six additional RF-101s to handle Yankee Team 
flights. The photography resulting from the RF-101 Yankee Team missions 
was processed and duplicated through the joint efforts of the 13th RTS 
and the SIC Lucky Dragon photo processing team at Tan Son Nhut and

annotated prints were immediately flown to Clark for delivery to the 
Armed Forces Courier Service, which had them in Washington in an average 
elapsed time of 34 hours. Other copies of Yankee Team photography were 
delivered to Udorn for the US Air Attache in Vientiane within 24 hours. 
In order to facilitate the rapid delivery of the film, two B-57 aircraft 
were assigned to the 2d Air Division in July to serve as photo couriers. (302) 
During May all of the RT-28s were removed from the VNAF 716th Squadron, 
and three of these RT-28s were flown to Udorn where Thai pilots used 
them to provide pre- and post-strike photo reconnaissance for T-28 strikes 
in Laos. Since the US Air Attache in Vientiane wanted delivery of this 
local RT-28 photography within 12 hours, a PACAF manned PPC was established 
at Udorn to provide initial product exploitation.(303) When the RT-28s 
were transferred out of the 716th Squadron, the three Vietnamese RC-47s 
were assigned to the VNAF 43d Transport Group, where after same imitial 
diversions to transport missions, they were restored to photo duty in 
the III and IV CTZ areas of operation. (3014)

During the first half of 1964, the AOC Reconnaissance Section continued 
to note a very high proportion of requests received for more expensive 
vertical area cover when it believed that a strip or pinpoint photo would 
have sufficed, the percentages photo completions by type in the period 
being: vertical area cover, 47.7 percent; vertical and oblique strips, 
28.8 percent; and vertical and oblique pinpoints, 23.5 percent. The 
AOC-R was also vexed by the high priorities assigned to photo requests 
by almost all requesting agencies, obviously to get faster action on 
their targets. The short delivery times specified resulted in failures 
to cover a part of the requested targets each month, and the AOC-R 
frequently noted that requestors extended their required delivery time 
on targets not completed when desired.(305) Although the 13th RTS rapidly 
developed into an extremely effective reconnaissance technical squadron, 
it experienced a very heavy workload as a result of the addition of 
Lucky Dragon and Yankee Team to Able Mable processing and exploitation 
requirements. In view of Defense Intelligence Agency interest in Laos, 
highest priority was given to processing and exploitation of Yankee 
Team photography and lower priorities to Able Mable. (306)

Although Yankee Team photo flights over Laos were promptly begun 
by RF-101s flying from Tan Son Nhut, the air reconnaissance program 
introduced some new operating problems. The JCS directive for continuing 
Laos reconnaissance issued on 25 May authorized occasional night 
photography and infrared reconnaissance in addition to daylight flights. 
At this time, the 2d Air Division possessed the two Patricia Lynn RB-57s 
that were equipped for night photography and infrared, but these two 
RB-57s were not equipped with self-contained navigation systems ---
particularly terrain clearance radar -- and General Moore could not 
agree to send them on night flights over Laos in view of the uncertain 
weather likely to be encountered and Mountainous terrain in which they 
would be called to operate. Recognizing the problem, USAF scheduled 
the delivery of two additional RB-57s to the 2d Air Division which 
would be equipped with doppler navigation and also in-flight read-out 
infrared sensors but these two new Patricia Lynn RB-57s could not be 
modified and delivered until December 1964, at which time the old 
Patricia Lynn planes would be withdrawn one at a time and also modified 
with the new equipment. In view of these circumstances, PACAF requested 
that USAF provide a package of four RE-66Bs for night photo and two 
RB-66Cs for electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations over Laos. At 
this time USAF did not believe it advisable to remove the RB-66s from 
assignment in Europe, and the 2d Air Division accordingly did not fly 
any night reconnaissance over Laos in: the initial months of Yankee 
Team. (307) 
As noted in the statistical chart of USAF Yankee Team sorties, the 
RF-101 reconnaissance effort over Laos drew heavily on 2d Air Division 
resources from its beginning and the effort was further complicated in 
August 1964 when monsoon clouds obscured photo targets and the RF-101s 
were generally limited to medium altitudes that prevented them from 
flying below cloud cover. Under the circumstances, the 2d Air Division 
employed unescorted RF-101s for advance weather reconnaissance rather 
than commit photo RF-101s with fighter escorts on missions that would 
find targets weathered out and would have to abort. Although PACAF conceded 
that the reconnaissance crews could best perform the weather scout mission 
for the photo reconnaissance effort, it was nevertheless concerned about 
the diversion of RF-101 photo capabilities and requested suggestions 
for alternate solutions. On 20 August, Colonel H. L. Price, 2d Air 
Division Director of Operations had already requested General Moore to 
consider that Yankee Team RF-101 flights from Tan Son Nhut and Da Nang 
were expensive and had became stereotyped. Price recommended that a 
detachment of four Yankee Team RF-101s should be deployed to Don Muang, 
provided Thailand would provide diplomatic clearance for such operations. 
In early September, Admiral Sharp and General Westmoreland agreed that 
Yankee Team photo coverage of the far northern reaches of Laos ought to 
be undertaken, and in context with this objective, as well as to conserve 
resources, General Harris proposed that an RF-101 detachment should be 
established at Ulorn, from which it could conduct unrefUeled reconnaissance 
flights of longer duration over all needed areas of Laos.(308) At this 
time, Ambassador Unger was opposed to extension of US reconnaissance 
flights beyond 20 degrees north latitude as an unnecessary provocation

and if intelligence was required in this area he proposed to employ Water 
Pump RT-28s. In order to operate RF-101s on a sustained basis from Udorn, 
moreover, it would be necessary to extend the length of the runway and 
provide an additional water supply for the PPC, which was depending on 
water brought by trucks to its storage tank. The program to develop 
Udorn to receive a reconnaissance task force was undertaken, but the 
RF-101 task force -- nicknamed 'Green Python" -- 4ould not begin olDra-
tions at Udorn until 1 April 1965.(309) 
In the autumn of 1964 the combination of Lucky Dragon and Yankee Team 
medium altitude photography met national strategic intelligence needs, and 
the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency commended the RF-101 
missions flown on 9 and 11 September for providing outstanding photography. 
As will be noted, the Yankee Team restrictions made it difficult to fly 
immediate pre-strike photography required for strike operations, and the 
imposition of a 10,000-foot altitude on Yankee Team medium altitude 
missions would result in significantly less effective reconnaissance for 
military purposes since it would rule out routine oblique photography that 
was needed to uncover targets that did not appear in vertical coverage, (310) 
In Vientiane, however, Lt Colonel Tyrrell did not support PACAF's proposed 
reolama to the operating restriction since with improving weather he thought 
that medium level photography should meet requirements and was conflaent 
that Ambassador Sullivan would act very quickly on proposed special low-
level missions.(311) One source for determining requirements for areas 
of enemy activity that needed especial requests for low-level coverage 
appeared to be available in high-altitude U-2 photo cover, but during 
December, studies in Saigon and Hawaii identified the fact that it would 
be very difficult with the limited available field resources to exploit 
the very large take of U-2 photography as a basis for getting indications 
of military activity for subsequent Yankee Team confirmation. The second 
phase analysis for Trojan Horse, moreover, was being done at Cubi Point, 
which made it difficult to exploit the U-2 take in Saigon. On the basis 
of Yankee Team experience through December 1964, however, MACV analyses 
suggested that reconnaissance missions could be accomplished safely with 
relative immunity to ground fire if conducted at very low altitude (below 
1,000 feet) and high speed, making single passes on each target. (312) 
Although General Harris continued to press for low altitude reconnaissance 
flights, and Admiral Sharp fully concurred that they were more effective 
and efficient for obtaining detailed coverage required to support tactical

Although it was obvious earlier, the fact that RF-101 day photo 
reconnaissance failed to capture many of the intelligence manifestations 
of fleeting guerrilla activities gained acceptance in MACV in the last 
half of 1964, initially through a consideration of infrared sensors and 
how they could be employed to pinpoint the enemy's locations. As has 
been seen, the two USAF Patricia Lynn RB-57s were ready for tactical 
employment but had no mission in mid-1964, when MACV requested two US 
Army infrared-equipped OV-1C Mohawk aircraft to augment visual and photo-
graphic capabilities for night surveillance. When General Moore asked 
Generals Stilwell and Du Puy why the Mohawks were required when the RB-57s 
were not being exploited by MACV, Stilwell and Du Puy appeared surprised 
to hear that 2d Air Division already had an infrared capability.(315) MACV 
nevertheless successfully justified a requirement for four US Army Mohawks, 
to be equipped with infrared sensors which could be "read-out" in flight 
and also with side-looking aircraft radar (SLAR) sensor systems. The two 
Patricia Lynn RB-57s were equipped with older infrared sets, whose photography 
had to be developed and interpreted on the ground after the plane returned 
from a flight, and USAF undertook to provide two additional Patricia Lynn 
RB-57s with in-flight infrared read-out by December, at which the older 
RB-57s would be singled out of operation, retrofitted with newer equipment, 
and returned to service. When the US Army infrared Mohawks were authorized 
to MACV, General LeMay insisted that they should be under the operational 
control of Commander, 2d Air Division, for employment in a joint counter-
insurgency reconnaissance task force. At this time, General Moore believed 
that the best he could expect would be to get an authority to coordinate 
all infrared missions for MACV as was done for Yankee Team. (316) As events 
progressed, MACV preferred a control arrangement quite different from either 
of these concepts. 
In mid-1964, USAF ALO/FACs emphasized that they had no difficulty 
observing enemy activities as they flew over Communist-held areas in 
liaison aircraft either in daylight or even more easily at night, when the 
Vietcong customarily lighted fires and cooked their food. As will be seen, 
the daylight air reconnaissance would become the mission of a Forward kir 
Controller/Strike Control and Reconnaissance (FAC/SCAR) program, but the 
collection of hostile heat-radiating intelligence manifestations was to 
be the mission of the infrared sensor aircraft. Experimental night flights 
of the RB-57s produced valuable information in the form of "hot-spots" on 
infrared photographs, which, when correlated with other ground intelligence, 
confirmed the locations of Vietcong camps in Zones C and D. In order to 
handle the earlier SCAT program, the III CTZ maintained a target section 
in the III CTOC, and in October 1964 the infrared section of the 13th 
Reconnaissance Technical Squadron began to telephone the III CTOC immedi-
ately after processing the results of a night's infrared mission. These 
results were usually the coordinate locations of cooking fires, and the 
III CTOC, based on ground intelligence, determined whether they were 
friendly or unfriendly. The exploitation of all the intelligence needed 
to exploit infrared required concentrated and timely efforts to collect, 
collate, and explbit all available intelligence for artillery or tactical 
air strikes. In order to handle the broadening concept, an expanded target 
center was established under the III Corps G-2 for the III Corps area.

air operations, Admiral Sharp had no hope for carte blanche ,low-level 
authority until Washington was convinced that such missions were 
advantageous. Meanwhile, authorization for low-level reconnaissance 
required for planning tactical air strikes would have to be requested 
and justified on a case-by-case basis.. (313) 
At the same time that Yankee Ten almostdoubled the RF-101 workload 
in Southeast Asia, requirements for Able Mable RF-101 photography increased 
within South Vietnam. The augmentation of the RF-101 force at Tan Son 
Nhut by six additional PACAF RF-101s obviated any reduction 
in photo reconnaissance capabilities. Incident to the Tonkin Gulf crisis 
in August, PACAF photo reconnaissance:capabilities were further increased 
by the CASF deployment of 6 RF-101s from the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance 
Wing to Kadena Air Base, since these aircraft and crews were employed at 
Tan Son Nhut on a limited basis. The VNAF C-47s also continued in opera-
tion over the III and IV CTZs, and two Vietnamese aircrews were permanently 
assigned to accomplish reconnaissance. The use of the VNAF Air Request 
System to forward requests for photography directly to ASOCs contributed to 
marked increases in requests for photography which rose to 430 in November 
and 549 in December. Photo reconnaissance sorties flown in South Vietnam 
were as follows:

Although ALO/FACs used their influence to some extent to persuade requestors 
to accept more economical pinpoint and strip photography, the predominant 
requests continued to be for expensive area cover photography, and this re-
quirement increased the burden of photo reconnaissance, especially in 
November 1964 when the photo crews commonly found a part of the area they 
were expected to cover blanketed with rain clouds. In November, 500 of 
the targets flown were incomplete but, with improving weather, only 291 
were not complete in December. The requestors of Able Mable in-country 
photography by percentages were: AWN 27, MACV 25, USAF 22, JCS 17, 
VNAF 7, and Other 2. MACV continued to lead all requestors in Priority I 
requests, 39 of 64 MACV requests being first priority in December. The 
average length of time for the completion of Quick Reaction photography 
in November was 5 hours 10 minutes this including 40 minute reaction 
and flight planning, two hours mission flight time, and 2 hours 30 minutes 
processing, printing 12 sets of prints, and immediate photo interpretation 
reporting (IPIR). Saigon area requestors received photography one hour 
after it was packaged. (31b) 4 1 9

collection of hostile heat-radiating intelligence manifestations was to 
be the mission of the infrared sensor aircraft. Experimental night flights 
of the RB-57s produced valuable information in the form of "hot-spots" on 
infrared photographs, which, when correlated with other ground intelligence, 
confirmed the locations of Vietcong camps in Zones C and D. In order to 
handle the earlier SCAT program, the III CTZ maintained a target section 
in the III CTOC, and in October 1964 the infrared section of the 13th 
Reconnaissance Technical Squadron began to telephone the III CTOC immedi-
ately after processing the results of a night's infrared mission. These 
results were usually the coordinate locations of cooking fires, and the 
III CTOC, based on ground intelligence, determined whether they were 
friendly or unfriendly. The exploitation of all the intelligence needed 
to exploit infrared required concentrated and timely efforts to collect, 
collate, and explbit all available intelligence for artillery or tactical 
air strikes. In order to handle the broadening concept, an expanded target 
center was established under the III Corps G-2 for the III Corps area.

USAF and US Army officers were the crime movers in the development, and 
VNAF was reluctant for that reason to accept many of the targets nominated 
by Americans. (317) While the RB-571 were in test during July, only 29 
infrared targets were requested and only 21 completed, but, with an addi-
tional RB-57 in use in December, there were 261 requests for infrared and 
228 completions. Most IR targets were in the III CTZ, since only this corps 
had a working target section that could handle the intelligence. In order 
to exploit both visual and IR sightifigs a 2d Air Division intelligence SCAT 
study group recommended that active corps target centers should be estab-
lished at the CTOC-ASOC level in each of the CTZs.(318) 
In recommending the corps target :centers, the 2d Air Division envisioned 
that they would provide information and requirements that would flaw quickly 
to the Air Operations Center, which Would possess operational control or 
coordination authority over air oneratinc. assets. On 20 December 1964, 
however, MAN organized a Centrl 2aalysis and Research Center (TRAC) 
at Tan Son Nhut as an integer of MAW J-2 and as a companion group to the 
J-3 Air Group in the Tactical Air aibnort Flement (TASE) of the MACV Combat 
Operations Center (COC). Work was also begun in organizing Corps TRACs, 
collocated with CTZ headquarters but .a part of MACV J-2. The basic source 
of information available initially bb the MACV TRAC was IR and SLAR reports 
obtained nightly by the RB-57s and Mohawks, the results of which were for-
warded to the CTZs immediately. Subsequently, thorough interpretation was 
made and target folders were prepared when necessary, the most lucrative 
targets being spotted on mosaic photography. By assigning Priority I 
missions, the MACV TRAC absorbed all of the infrared capability of the 
RB-57s and Mohawks during January. 19b5, except for a single RB-57 Barrel 
Roll night bomb damage assessment flight made in Laos by oneof the new 
Patricia Lynn aircraft, which had 1,3Lf ctmtained navigation radar. In 
February,. the MACV TRAC generated s many Priority I requests for RF-101 
area cover that at one time thE. 1.2t RTS :as five days behind in process-
ing any request for photography that: was not Priority I. Chiefly through 
correlation of infrared sensor indiations with other intelligence, the 
TRAC identified 250 possible enery kl.isgets in its first two months of 
operations, including Vietcong battali)n camps in Phuoc Thy province which, 
as will be seen, would be struck by US:.F 3-57 jet bombers. (319) 
Although USAF supported the TRAC program as a move to increase the 
capability to develop in-country intelligence in South Vietnam, the estab-
lishment of the central MACV TRAC effectively resulted in the removal of 
control of infrared reconnaissance iorties and much of the RF-101 effort 
from the Joint Operations Center.(320) The TRAC enjoyed some intelligence 
sources which by law could not be dleclosed to Vietnamese agencies, with 
the result that the Vietnamese delayed and in some instances refused to 
permit strikes against targets generated by US irtelligence and recon-
naissance.(321) Cooperation between. corps TRACs and ARVN Corps G-2s was 
reported somewhat less close than desirable; moreover, the centralized 
aspects of the TRAC system workd at: cross purposes with the 2d Air 
Division's desires to develop a cloe relationenip between the FAC/SLAR-
Province Chief for intellic:ence Lnd cluk air tar.,:eting.(322) Where

PACAF and USAF rationalized that the majority of the personnel to be 
assigned to the TRAC would be USAF targeting, interpretation, and re-
connaissance officers, this in view of the fact that the product would 
be used primarily by USAF and VNAF for air strikes, the initial MACV JTD 
request for officers for TRAC was for 10 US Army, 9 USAF, and 3 USMC 
spaces. (323) As the TRAC system developed, moreover, General Westmoreland 
preferred to regard all air operations in South Vietnam -- even interdic-
tion, which in conventional war was an Air Force responsibility -- as 
being in support of ground operations and thus necessarily to be directly 
responsive to ground commanders' requirements. Thus, through the MIN 
TRAC assignment of priorities, the MACV J-2 had primary staff responsi-
bility for insuring maximum effective utilization of air reconnaissance 
and surveillance resources within South Vietnam. This arrangement left 
the 2d Air Division commander, operating through tha Air Operations 
Center, only nominal operational control over air reconnaissance forces, 
and these forces (like aircraft employed in close air support and inter-
diction within South Vietnam) became primarily responsive to ground re-
quirements.(324) 
Under command arrangements perfected during 19c3, toe Southeast Acie 
Airlift System (SEAAS) at the outset of 1.964 was oberated by the 315th 
Troop Carrier Group, with headquarters and transport movement contrei 
center (TMC) at Tan Son Nhut, toe TMC located in the Air Operations 
Center and exercising control of cormion-use airlift resources in South 
Vietnam and Thailand. The 315th Group was assigned to the 315th Air 
Division at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, but was under operational conk,rol 
of COMUSMACV exercised by Commander, 2d Air Division. According to MACV 
directive, US and RVNAF forces determined their monthly projected require-
ments for airlift and transmitted them to the Joint Airlift Allocation 
Board in MACV J-4, which in conjunction with the RUAF levied the re-
quirements on the SEAAS in the form of allocations, these being provided 
in monthly increments. As a matter of fact, heweVee, the Joint Airlift 
Allocation Board by 1964 had become one officer in the MACV J-4 Movements 
Branch who was saddled with the large task of screening and processine, 
requests for airlift and establishing priorities. Under projections in 
1963 the monthly preplanned requirements for air transport normally :mounted 
to about one-third of SEAAS airlift capacity. The remainder of SEAA3 capa-
city was available for on-call operations, the top priority being given to 
emergency requests and preplanned tactical operations. To satisfy airlift 
requirements, the 315th Group commander, as SEAAS Director of Air Transpor-
tation, could call upon the 48 authorized USAF C-123s of his three squadrons, 
three C-47s of the 1st Air Commando Squadron, two US Army CV-2B Caribou 
transports, and two Royallrew Zealand Air Force Bristol transports which 
operated in Thailand. Because of the special support requirements of US 
Army Special Force teams in remote outposts, three C-123s and two of the 
Air Commando C-47s were kept on station at Nha Trang and committed to the 
support of US Army Special Forces, Vietnam. The 315th Group also maintained 
a "Fire Brigade" alert capability of three C-123s at Tan Son Nhut and one 
0-123 at Da Nang, prepared on 15-minute notice to respond to immediate 
requirements for an ARVN paratroop employment or equivalent emergencies.

Two C-123s were also normally allocated to Deputy COMUSMACTHAI for service 
in Thailand. As has been seen, VNAF C-47 air transport capabilities were 
computed and allocated under the SSAAS framework, but the Vietnamese air-
craft were fragged in a separate order, issued by VNAF air transport officers 
in the AOC. Only two of the 16 Caribous assigned to the US Angy's 61st 
Aviation Company were allocated to the SEAAS for cammon use; four were 
assigned to the 14.5th Aviation Battalion in III CTZ, three to the I CTZ 
Aviation Detachment, three to the 52d Aviation Battalion in the II CTZ, 
three to the Delta Aviation Battalion in IV CTZ, and one to the JUSMAG 
Thailand at Bangkok. (32) 
During 1963 the Southeast Asia airlift had differed from earlier Air 
Force airlift efforts in the large proportion of tactical activity per-
formed, including paratroop employments and airlanded and airdropped 
supply of remote installations. As a matter of policy, General 1,eMay 
wanted the USAF C-123 assault transports used in tactical employments 
rather than as logistics carriers, and, on 20 February 1964, Admiral Felt 
directed General Harkins to give maximum attention to plans for increased 
use of South Vietnam's rail transport and reductions of airlift. The CINCPAC 
admonition reflected comments by senior commanders that ARVN would not 
travel on the ground and keep roads and rails open because USAF moved 
everything for them by air. (326) Although Admiral Felt conceived that 
additional amounts of air escort for trains would yield a decrease in 
Vietcong incidents, increased use of rail communications, and decreased 
requirements for airlift, this concept did not materialize. In late 1963, 
the Vietcong pressed increasingly bitter attacks against South Vietnam's 
main north-south railway, about 60 percent of all rail interdiction efforts 
occurring in the coastal reaches of Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Binh Thuan 
provinces. (327) The reductions in surface transport security generated 
increased requirements for air-transported supply. In the months of 
January-June 1964, Air Commando C-47s, while chiefly committed to air-
dropped resupply missions, flew 1,338 airlanded resupply sorties, with 
2,010 passengers and 1,246 tons of cargo. The two US Army Caribou air-
craft were made available by tail number to the SEAAS each day, with the 
result that if one of the plans was not operational it could not be flown. 
The Caribous were nevertheless generally employed on short hauls and in ope-
rations under the SEAAS in January-June flew 7,939 airlanded sorties, with 
47,731 passengers and 3,322.8 tons of cargo.(328) The C-123 force was 
the principal airlift capability o' :t SEAAS, as shown in the following

In addition to airlanded sorties, the Air Commando C-47s delivered 405 tons 
of airborne supplies and the C-123s airdropped 1,270.6 tons of supplies in 
the first half of 1964. The C-123s transported 1,252 paratroopers and 115.3 
tons of supply in airborne assault missions and they flew 239 airborne flare 
alert night missions, dropping flares on 119 of these missions flown in the 
period January-June 1964.(329) 
As established in Vietnam, the "Fire Brigade" airborne alert concept 
encampassed the maintenance of five VNAF C-47s and three USAF C-123s at 
Tan Son Nhut on the alert to air drop two companies of ARVN Airborne Brigade 
paratroopers on orders from the RVNAF aas. This concept was superseded by 
events during the winter of 1963-1964. On the one hand, the organization 
of a helicopter transportable Eagle Flight force within the Airborne Brigade 
promised quick deployment of ARVN paratroopers without casualties normally 
sustained in paratroop drops. On the other hand, increasing Vietcong strength 
demanded that an airlift capability of a full ARVN airborne battalion was 
requisite, and this size C-47 and C-123 alert force was prohibited by avail-
able air transport resources. In the Airborne Brigade Eagle Flight operations 
the alert C-47s and 0-123s were prepared to reinforce or resupply helicopter-
transported paratroopers, and in January 1964 the C-123s made supply drops in 
support of the large and relatively unsuccessful foray into War Zone D but 
did not drop paratroopers. Given adequate preplanning notice, the SEAS 
could marshal transport aircraft at Tan Son Nhut to drop battalion-strength 
paratroop forces, but it remained next to impossible to secure any definite 
notice fram the oas and marshalling of the transports cut into logistical 
airlift schedules. In three instances in February and March, the JGS did 
call for alert preparations to employ a paratroop battalion, but in each 
case the JOS did not commit the battalion and 17 assorted transport aircraft 
were kept tied up at Tan Son Nhut during the operations. In preparation for 
an ARVN 1st Division Lam Son 115 operation into the Ashau/Aloui valley at 
the Laotian border in the I CTZ early in April, two 311th Troop Carrier

Squadron C-123s made daily airlifts of troops and supplies into the Aloui 
and Ashau airstrips, where UC H-314 helicopters and US Army Caribou air-
craft picked them up and took them farther into the valleys where they be-
gan a sweep that failed to contact the Vietcong 502d Battalion which was 
reported to own the area. In another employment on the afternoon of 12 
April, the JGS committed the 7th Airborne Battalion in the relief effort 
of the Kien Long district headquarters in Chuong Thien province, and the 
C-123s successfully deployed it in the first sizable paradrop since November 
1963.(330) 
Although C-123 air assault operations were reducing, the three USAF 
C-123s and the three Air Cammando C-47s kept at Nha Trang were the prime 
air cargo carriers for the US Army Special Forces in Vietnam. In view of 
the remote locations of CG camps practically all supplies had to be air-
lifted to them from the Logistical Operations Center at Nha Trang. The 
Special Forces cargo requirements during 1964 amounted to about 1,500 tons 
a month, desirably delivered to the scattered fortified camps in increments 
small enough and regularly enough to prevent a substantial accumulation of 
stockpiles that might tempt a Vietcong assault. Cargo loads varied from 
neatly packed bundles to bulky and unwieldy rolls of concertina wire, sand 
bags, and steel stakes -- frequently a mixture of all. Landing strips at the 
forward locations were mostly rudimentary and dropzones were frequently 
hard to find, especially in marginal weather. Enemy ground fire hazarded 
low altitude transport operations, and during 1964 more C -123s were hit by 
(*Mei ground fire than any other type of fixed wing aircraft. The USAF ALO at 
Nha Trang, Lt Colonel Victor N. Curtis, described the C-47 and 0-123 air-
crews as "same of the most professional and dedicated people" he had ever 
known, and he also noted that the Army Special Forces both appreciated the 
.air supply and did all possible tJ faciliate the airlift effort. "If 
an item or service, is desired by the' USAF people," Curtis stated, "the 
Special Forces will provide it if at all nossible." During 1964 the 
C-47s and C-123s had not been equipped with ARC-44 radio sets that could 
contact the A1/PRC-10 battery-operated radios at the Special Forces camps; 
with help from the Special Forces AN/PRC-1)s were rigged aboard the transports 
but these communications were marginal, and the aircraft commanders usually 
relied upon smoke signals to direct landings or dropping: green smoke to 
land or drop, red to abort, and pilot's discretion in case no smoke showed. 
Since a Special Forces camp seldom wanted a full-load C-123 cargo drop 
possible with "Bent Bow" rapid delivery techniques, tests were made early 
in 1964 to determine whether a 0-123 could use a Parachute Low Altitude 
Delivery (PLAD) system. The system had excellent potential for accuracy, 
but paradrop bundles were limited to 1,500 pounds in weight and six minutes 
were required to re-rig between releases. The C-1238 could not afford to 
remain in the air at low altitude over enemy hazarded drop zones long 
enough to expend their, cargoes with the PLAD system, and it was not accepted 
for operational use. Instead, the Cd-123 crews manhandled their air drop 
cargo in a manner reminiscent of World War II. (331) 
In operations in South Vietnam during 1963, t;:le SEAAS had proven able 
to generate more airlift than was recuired, but situation changed

during the first half of 1964. After 1 January 1964, the C-123 squadrons 
consistently were required to over-fly their programmed 60-hours of flying 
time per aircraft per month. Rough field landings and takeoffs stressed 
aircraft; on 4 May skin wrinkles were discovered on the top sides of two 
C-123s, and on further inspection all 37 of the C-123s at Tan Son Nhut, 
which had been in Vietnam for almost three years, showed visible damage. 
The C-123B aircraft at Da Nang had been in the theater only a year and 
visual inspection revealed only minor damages, but as many as 11 of the 
Tan Son Nhut C-123s required extensive inspection and necessary repair. 
Although the three C-123s at Nha Trang were well utilized, these dedi-
cated plans were unavailable for common use, and in May three more C-123s 
had to be diverted to Thailand in addition to the two normally serving 
there. The prospective introduction of six Royal Australian Air Force 
CV-2B Caribou aircraft for service under the SEAAS beginning in August 
would provide about 600 tons of additional airlift a month, but two US 
Army Caribous were lost in crashes on 5 and 7 May. In June the SEAAS 
received only 42 CV-2 sorties, which lifted 206 passengers and 52.3 tons 
of cargo, and in July MACV would release the two US _Army Caribous from 
the SEALS. In earlier planning, the SEAA3 had counted upon overflying 
the C-123s to provide a surge capability in the event that the enemy inter-
dicted the movement of POL by road and a substantial increase in airlift 
was required, but most of this surge capacity had been lost by the :-,verflying 
of the aircraft in the first months of 1964. In addition to all these airlift 
problems, General Westmoreland was preparing to request Washington approval 
for 4,200 new field advisors who would require an experienced average of 
1,200 tons of airlift support each month. (332) 
The assignment of Colonel David T. Fleming on 30 May 1964 as 315th 
Troop Carrier Group and Director of SEAAS occurred at the time that SEAAS 
was saturated with requirements and the system itself was a hodgepodge 
of elements imperfectly tacked together. The one-man Joint Airlift 
Allocation Board in MAT/ J-4 could not adequately screen requestE for 
validity. Some cargo that should have been transported by surface was 
being airlifted, and cargo for airlift was frequently late or did not 
arrive at the air terminals, with consequent delays in airlift operations. 
In order to fly missions in these cases, the air carriers had first to track 
down the cargo. Another serious system deficiency was the lack of effective 
communications for transport flight following. The Airlift Control Center 
(ALCC) at Tan Son Nhut shared the TACS net, but this net reached only the 
airfields where Transport Movement Control (TMC) detachments and aerial 
ports were located. The Airlift Control Center and the TMCs also needed 
effective communications with aircraft in flight, but efforts that had been 
made since early 1962 to improvise a high frequency radio net had never met 
the need for flight following. Under these circumstances, transport aircraft 
frequently left enroute bases empty or partially loaded because the crew 
duty time limits or the flight schedule did not allow excessive ground time 
to await a load that was not ready because the base aerial ports and the TMCs 
were unable to communicate. (333) The required system improvements in the 
SEAAS, which would have increased the efficiency of the system, would not 
materialize for several years. In order to handle the airlift crisis of 
mid-1964, Colonel Fleming requested the assignment of an additional fourth

squadron of C-123s, and, as has been seen, General Westmoreland put 
through the requirement for the 0-123 squadron and also a second US 
Army Caribou company on 16-17 July 1964., and Secretary McNamara directed 
that the requirements would be met on 7 August. (33L) Since airlift 
capabilities were already saturated, PACAF committed eleven 315th Air 
Division C-130 transport aircraft to augment the airlift in South 
Vietnam during July, the initial thought being that these larger air trans-
ports would be staged into Vietnam from Clark Air Base to carry loads until 
the additional 0-123 squadron could be provided.(335) The C-130 flights 
were fragged by the Tan Son Nhut ALCC, and they began to work off the back-
log of air cargo at the major air terminals. In early August, however, 
the Gulf of Tonkin crisis precipitated a hurried deployment of USAF air 
units into South Vietnam and Thailand. The 315th Air Division handled 
these intra-theater movements, with Detachment 3, 315th Air Division, at 
Clark Air Base functioning as the Movement Control Center. The division 
airlift was augmented by three CASF 0-130 squAdrons of the Tactical Air 
Command, two of which remained at Clark and Naha Air Bases to meet continu-
ing airlift requirements. These developments not only increased airlift 
requirements in Southeast Asia but also resulted in the introduction of 
the intra-theater 315th Air Division airlift system into the area in 
addition to the SEAAS.(336) 
Although Colonel Fleming recommended the organization of all air 
transport resources into a single assault airlift task force under the 
direct control of the Commander, 2d Air Division, (337) several years 
would pass before the two airlift systems (and the Army Caribou resources) 
would be consolidated, and the immediate task in the last half of 1964 
concerned the augmentation of the SEAAS. The flight of six RAAF Caribou 
aircraft arrived at Tan Son Nhut beginning on 10 August and very shortly 
provided four airframes daily to the SEAAS. The excellent short-range 
carrying capabilities of the Australian CV-2Bs were effectively woven into 
the MAAS in an atmosphere of complete accord, providing a demonstration 
that the Caribou could be effectively scheduled and utilized in a centralized 
system. Despite the loss of one of the RAAF planes at a remote strip 
landing in December, the Australian crews did not reduce their effort, 
which generated 387 airlift hours and 564 sorties plus 30 night flare-
drop sorties during the month. (338) Preparatory to the activation of the 
19th Air Commander SquRdron, Troop Carrier, at Tan Son Nhut on 8 October, 
plans were made to reposition the 310th Troop Carrier Squadron to Nha Trang, 
where its C-123s were to have a primary mission in support of the expanding 
US Army Special Forces throughout Vietnam. These plans were delayed by 
several causes. Beginning in October, replacement crews from Hurlburt Air 
Force Base flew the C-123s for the 19th Squadron to South Vietnam but the 
CCTS output at Hurlburt could not support an immediate manning of the 315th 
Group with flight crews. New facilities were also needed at Nha Trang to 
accommodate the 310th ,iguadron and work by civil contract went very slowly. 
As a result, during the autumn of 1964 the detachment of C-123s and C-47s 
continued to support the Special Forces and were met with increased hazards.

on 24 October, a 0-123 could not make radio contact and wandered over the 
Cambodian border, where it was shot down with the loss of all eight crew-
men. The loss probably could have been averted if the aircraft had been 
equipped with an ARC-44 set that would have permitted air-ground communica-
tions. In December construction at Nha Trang permitted movement of half 
of the 310th Squadron and seven of its C-123s to this base. The C-47s 
were withdrawn, and the seven C-123s, an Australian CV-2, and three US 
Army CV-2s supported the Special Forces. The Army Caribous operated out-
side the SEAAS, but their crews were reported to be delighted with the 
VNAF fighter escort that was provided for them and also for the USAF 
transports. (339) 
In July and August, the 315th Air Division C-130s transiting South 
Vietnam materially assisted in the SEAAS airlift, but the C-123s con-
tinued to carry 87 percent of the total airlift effort. (340) Except 
for support for the Special Forces and night flare drops, the 315th 
Troop Carrier Group was held principally to a flat all-out logistics 
airlift mission, which increased in volume with the beginning cf the

During floods in central South Vietnam in November, the 315th Group lifted 
over 1,500 tons of supplies and rescue equipment and over 2,300 civil flood 
refugees, and C-1214s and C-130s of the 315th Air Division added additional 
humanitarian airlift. Prior to the floods, about 70 percent of all RVNAF 
and US logistics movements were by road, the balance by sea (20 percent), 
by rail (5 percent), and by air (5 percent). During and immediately after 
the floods only 20 percent was moved by road and the remainder by sea and 
air. In this period, some US advisory detachments ran out of food for lack 
of air delivery. Altogether the SEAS transported 16,727 tons in December, 
but there was a backlog of cargo at the year's end.(341) 
As a result of tests made by the Ranch Hand C-123 aerial spray herbicidal 
flight, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had concluded in April 1963 that spray 
operations provided military advantages as a means to defoliate vegetation 
providing concealment to guerrillas and to destroy crops grown by the 
insurgents. As has been seen, authority to order US defoliation missions 
was granted to the US Ambassador/COMUSMACV. Several VNAF helicoptors were 
equipped with spray equipment and could be employed in crop destruction, 
but US crews and aircraft were not cleared for spray missions against 
Vietcong food sources. In the dry season of 1963 (January-May) no Ranch 
Hand defoliation flights were flown, since defoliant chemicals had proved 
to be most effective in the wet season, when vegetation was growing. 
Beginning in June 1963, the spray C-123s were engaged in a number of flights 
to clear vegetation away from the Saigon-Dalat powerline, the Saigon-Phan 
Thiet rail line, and a key canal on the Ca Mau peninsula. This defoliation

activity improved visibility and reduced vegetation cover which sheltered 
hostile sabotage and ambush activities. In 1962 aerial spraying defoliated 20.1 
square kilometers and destroyed 750 acres of hostile food; in 1963, 87.3 square 
kilometers were defoliated and 197.5 acres of food crops were destroyed by 
chemical spray. (3L42) 
After an analysis of defoliation and crop destruction activities, 
Ambassador Lodge and General Harkins recommended on 9 October 1963 
that the country team should be authorized to approve chemical crop 
destruction on the basis of military need, and in January 1964, US Army 
senior division advisors were authorized to make a wider use of aerial 
spray defoliation for clearing foliage from around depots, airfields, 
and outposts and to approve hand-spray operations against enemy crops. 
In view of the requirement that warnings to the civil population should 
be made prior to spray operations, the Ranch Hand C-123 spray flights, 
operating from an altitude of 150 feet, had been harzarded by enemy 
ground fire during 1962 and 1963, the average number of hits on each 
spray aircraft in each mission running to about four small arms bullets 
The danger became much more severe in 1964 when spray flights were sent 
against are dominated by the Vietcong. On 30 April, one of the Ranch 
Hand planes ran into 50-caliber fire, which wounded the co-pilot and 
put 40 holes in the plane. The spray missions were routinely accompanied 
by fighters, but the fighters were not permitted to fire until the Ranch 
Hand plane had been fired upon, thus limiting the effectiveness of the 
fire support. In May and June 1964, the Ranch Hand planes staged to. 
Da Nang and hurriedly sprayed elephant grass and marsh scrub which 
sheltered enemy activities along the roads in the Ashau/Aloui valley. 
These flights into the enemy-dominated area were accomplished quickly, 
before the Vietcong apparently could react in strength, and only four 
hits were sustained during 26 sorties out of Da Nang. On five spray 
missions in III CTZ during May 1964, however, the Ranch Hand planes 
sustained 15 ground fire hits, and on two occasions MACV suspended 
operations against targets where persistent resistance was encountered.(343) 
Although attached to the 315th Troup Carrier Group, Ranch Hand 
functioned in a temporary duty assignment supported by the Tactical 
Air Command until July 1964, when the three spray C-123s and the 
volunteer crew who flew them became Detachment 1, 315th Troup Carrier 
Group. Another change in the Ranch Hand activity occurred on 29 July 
when Washington granted authority to the US Ambassador/COMUSMACV to 
employ the C-123s in crop destruction, provided the planes displayed 
VNAF insignia and had Vietnamese crew members aboard. This decision 
reflected COMUSMACV recommendations that the Vietnamese spray-equipped 
helicopters could not safely work many of the enemy-held target areas. 
In order to reduce C-123 exposure to ground fire, the three Ranch Hand 
aircraft received modified spray systems in August that enabled them 
to dispense herbicides at the rate of three gallons per acre (double

the previous rate of 1.5 gallons per acre) thus enabling them to complete 
a mission in a single pass. The first USAF crop destruction missions 
were flown against approximately 5,000 hectares of rice, corn, manioc, 
bananas, and pineapples growing in scattered patches in a 20 x 24 kilometer 
area of Phuoc Long province. Nicknamed "Big Patches," the project was begun 
on 3 October and concluded ten days later when 19 spray sorties had been 
flown. Fighter escort was provided for all flights, but the C-123s received 
40 ground fire hits, with a marked increase in Vietcong opposition noted on 
the last two days of the operation. In late November, the C-123s sprayed 
approximately 5,000 acres of Vietcong rice growing in War Zone D. An 
intelligence source quoted the Vietcong Phuoc Thanh Provincial Committee as 
reporting that the rice destroyed would have fed the enemy troops in the 
area for two years, but in the course of these spray flights ground fire shot 
out an engine on one of the C-123s, which barely managed to recover at Bien Hoa. 
A fourth 0-123 was added to Ranch Rand during December, and as the year's 
activity ended the detachment had flown 72 survey flights and 363 spray sorties, 
had defoliated 257.7 square kilometers of vegetation, and had destroyed 
15,215 acres of Vietcong crops.(344) 
8. Communist Field Attack Ends the  US Advisory Era  
During the late summer of 1964, American actions were seeking to bulwark 
the morale of the civil government .which was restored in Saigon beginning on 
26 October, to increase counterinsurgency capabilities inside Laos, and to 
deter Hanoi from all-out aggression. In these same months, however, the 
North Vietnamese moved in for the kill. Interrogations and captured documents 
would show that the North Vietnamese Army's 95th Regiment (325th Division) left 
North Vietnam in October, and it would arrive in South Vietnam in December. 
This regiment was closely followed by the other two 325th Division regiments, 
the 32d which would be in South Vietnam by March 1965 and the 101st which would 
be in Kontum province by early July 1965. The relatively slow trip through 
Laos may have been attributable to the limitations of the panhandle roads; 
more likely, however, Hanoi believed that Vietcong field offensives would 
be enough to collapse the feeble Saigon government headed by the venerable 
Phan Khac Suu as Chief of state and Saigon's former mayor, Tran Van Huong, 
as prime minister. During the autumn months, the US intelligence community 
noted the increase in Infiltration but did not agree upon its significance. 
In the same season, South Vietnam's ineffective coastal force patrols did not 
disclose the very large seaborne movements of Communist weapons, mostly of 
Soviet design and manufactured in China, across South Vietnam's beaches. The 
weapons included AK-147 automatic assault rifles, 7.62-mm machine guns, 82-mm 
mortars,and 57- and 75-mm recoilless rifles. The automatic weapons outclassed 
ARUN firepower and were merciless against older weapons possessed by regional 
and popular forces. The mortars provided the Vietcong a stand-off attack 
weapon against defended objectives. Captured COSVN directives called for large-
scale attacks to overrun forts and hamlets, to cut lines of communications, 
and to ambush search and clear forces. In order to reduce the effectiveness of 
air support strikes, the Vietcong were enjoined to "cling" to government forces 
once combat was joined.(345) In the last half of 1961.1 night outpost and hamlet 
attacks doubled in intensity and were especially severe in the III and IV CTZs.

Beginning in October the Vietcong scored marked successes in the II CTZ 
which had been believed to be nearly pacified a few months earlier. The 
last train from Saigon arrived at Qui Nhon after a 26-day trip late in 
October, and after this resupply in the II CTZ would depend upon air and 
sea deliveries. (3L6) 
In the aftermath of the USAF developments to Da Nang and Bien Hoa, 
General Moore considered it only a matter of time until the Vietcong 
would attempt a psychologically damaging surprise raid or a mortar 
bombardment against one of the major air bases. Internal security and 
periphery defense at the bases was a Vietnamese responsibility, but 
the 2d. Air Division used its law enforcement force (one officer and 
280 airmen) as added guards, especially at times of increased alert. 
Passive defense was the order of the day, but effective dispersal of 
aircraft was virtually impossible at the overloaded airfields. On 
26 August, PACAF unsuccessfully requested CINCPAC to allow one of the 
B-57 squadrons to move from Bien Hoa to Takhli in order to relieve the 
vulnerability to sabotage or attack. On 7 November, General Moore asked 
General Harris personally to intercede with Admiral Sharp and get some authority 
to reduce the number of B-57s at Bien Hoa without voiding the authority to 
have them there in an emergency. Harris secured acceptance of a plan whereby 
half of each of the two squadrons would be sent back to Clark Air Base for 
continuation training, and effective on 22 October the alert commiLment of 
the B-57s at Bien Hoa was reduced to 18 aircraft. Bien Hoa still remained 
overcrowded and poorly defended, and, on the night of 1 November, a Vietcong 
mortar squad got inside the ARVN perimeter and launched a 20-minute barrage 
against American aircraft and barracks areas, killing four Americans and 
wounding 72, destroying four B-57s and damaging 15 others. Three VNAF A-1Hs 
and four USAF H-43 helicopters also received lesser damages. The ARVN 
perimeter guards attempted pursuit but had no success.(3/47) 
During the late summer and early autumn the Joint Chiefs of Staff were 
agreed that action should be taken against North Vietnam, but they did not 
agree upon the severity of the action or when it should be taken. In 
response to Secretary McNamarats questions of 31 August, the Joint Chiefs 
accepted the USAF assurance that the 9/4 targets could be attacked without 
unacceptably depleting fuel and ordnance that might be required against a 
Chinese Communist intervention, and the CINCPAC staffs had prepared a plan 
to hit all 9I4 targets in 20 days. The Bien Hoa attack catalyzed the Joint 
Chiefs in favor of a very strong reprisal. On 1 November they verbally 
recommended to Secretary McNamara that immediate US air strikes should be 
launched against the "hard" infiltration targets in the Lao Panhandle, that 
US Army and Marine defense forces should be airlifted to Da Nang, to 
Saigon-Tan Son Nhut, and to the Bien Hoa area and the forces should be 
assembled within 60-72 hours to commence an air campaign against North 
Vietnam, this to include an initial B-52 night strike against Phuc Yen 
airfield +o be flown from Guam, first-light PACOM strikes against other 
airfields and the Hanoi-Haiphnng oil storage areas, and then progressive 
SAC and PACOM strikes against the other 94 targets. Ambassador Taylor 
recommended a more restrained response consisting of some retaliations

against selected North Vietnamese targets by US and VNAF aircraft, 
coupled with a policy statement that similar responses would be 
forthcoming under like circumstances in the future. On 1 November, 
President Johnson appointed a NSC working group, chaired by William 
Bundy, and directed it to outline political and military options for 
direct action against North Vietnam. On 18 November the Joint Chiefs 
recommended a hard-hitting, fast, "full squeeze" air campaign against 
North Vietnam to be completed in 20 days. But since the NSC working 
group was favoring lesser actions, the Joint Chiefs also prepared a 
fall-back position with another program for controlled, systematically 
increasing air pressure which could be accomplished in a two-month air 
campaign. (314.8) 
Other than for an order from President Johnson that the destroyed 
and seriously damaged B-57s would be promptly replaced at Bien Hoa, 
the United States did not respond to the Bien Hoa attack. On the night 
of 6/7 November, .however, Air Vice Marshal Ky led 32 VNAF A-1Hs against 
a Vietcong camp in Zone D as an announced retaliation for the Bien Hoa 
attack. South Vietnamese intelligence reports stated that this air 
attack produced 500 enemy casualties, but the Communist troops forayed 
out of Zone D on 16 November and engaged government forces in a very 
damaging six-hour, give-and-take battle near Ben Cat. In response on 
18 November, General Khanh personally directed a massive operation in 
which 115 US Army and VNAF helicopters lifted 12 battalions of ARVN 
troops to the fringes of Zone D near Ben Suc. This operation claimed 
163 enemy killed (83 by supporting air) and 68 captured.(3)4.9) In these 
same weeks that major ARVN efforts had no real effect on the enemy who 
surrounded Saigon, a combination of sel;ere floods produced by typhoons 
Iris and Joan which swept in in the twelve days beginning on 11 November, 
together with resurgent Communist activity, virtually collapsed govern-
ment authority in the ten central provinces of South Vietnam. As the 
floods receded, the Vietcong almost completely controlled the country-
side in populous Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh provinces, and government 
presence was limited to district towns and provincial capital cities. 
The ARVN could open a road momentarily by committing four to six battalions, 
but as soon as the force withdrew the Vietcong promptly closed the 
reopened roads. The Vietcong not only kept ARVN units off balance, 
rushing back and forth to put down local attacks, but the enemy's 
actions were also costing the ARVN units heavily in losses of men, 
equipment, and morale. Such Vietcong as were captured were highly 
motivated and quite confident of victory. The Vietcong had no difficulty 
recruiting replacements for any losses they sustained, and the National 
Liberation Front was organizing local shadow governments which would be 
available to take power when the Saigon regime collapsed.(350) 
The military situation in Laos was also declining. In late October 
and early November, night flying US Navy RF-8A Yankee Team crews visually

observed a heavy flow of vehicles from North Vietnam along Route 7 
toward the Plain of Jars, and it was evident by early November 
that the Lao T-28s were not powerful enough to do more than haress 
the Communist infiltration targets in the Lao panhandle. Under his letter 
of authority from President Johnson, Ambassador Taylor had announced 
plans on 11 September to organize the US Ambassadors in Southeast Asia 
as the Southeast Asia Coordinating Committee (SEACOORD) with a Military 
Subcommittee (SEAL), the organizational structure resembling the SEATO 
Council and SEATO Military Advisors. Admiral Sharp had protested SEAMIL 
as an infringement on his authority as CINCPAC, but he sent General Harris 
and the PACOM J-5 to attend the SEACOORD/SEAMIL meeting in Bangkok on 
6 November which was assembled to consider an agenda of military questions 
related to Laos, including one novel proposal to develop Route 9 across 
northern South Vietnam and through the Lao panhandle--from Dong Ha to 
Savannakhet--into a modern two or four lane highway and to garrison it 
with infantry divisions, thus halting North Vietnamese infiltration. 
Upon discussion it appeared that a two-lane Dong Ha-Savannakhet highway 
could be built in three years but five infantry divisions would be required 
as security forces, and if the highway were built and not heavily garrisoned 
it would probably assist the Communists more than it would help the defense 
of South Vietnam. As a procedural matter, SEACOORD decided that SEAMIL was 
not necessary as a formal organization though CINCPAC representatives would 
be invited and attend future meetings. In its substantive recommendations, 
SEACOORD desired approval of air strikes against the heavily defended Mu Gia 
pass, and it also pointed out that stronger action was needed outside South 
Vietnam to produce a desirable psychological and military impact on the 
Communists. (3l) 
Under direction from Washington a Yankee Team RF-101 with F-100 escorts 
was authorized to make a low-level flight on 18 November over the Lao roads 
leading from Mu Gia pass. The RF-101 received antiaircraft fire near the town 
of Ban Sa Ang and in the course of returning fire an F-100 was shot down, and 
its pilot was fatally injured. Another RF-101 was promptly scheduled for a 
medium level coverage of the same area on 21 November, and while flying at 
a 3,000-foot altitude the RF-101 was hit by enemy barrage fire and went down, 
the pilot surviving and being rescued by Air America. Under Yankee Team rules 
"medium altitude" was an altitude safe from enemy automatic weapons, and the 
JCS now issued more positive instructions defining medium level as being at 
least 10,000 feet above the terrain. As a reprisal to the enemy action, 
Admiral Sharp recommended a one-time special armed reconnaissance mission 
into the area, and General LeMay urged that US reprisal strikes should be 
launched against the infiltration objectives in Laos that were too strongly 
defended to be attacked by Lao T-28s. The Joint Chiefs did not accept LeMay's 
basic proposition, but on 24 November they requested Secretary McNamara to 
authorize flak suppression missions along the roads in Laos leading southward 
from MU Gia pass.(352)

During a press interview in Saigon on 21 November, Ambassador Taylor 
described the principal difficulties in Vietnam as the lack of an effective 
national government and the inability to restrain continuing reinforcement 
of the Vietcong. Taylor regarded the restoration of a viable society within 
South Vietnam as being primary and observed that air strikes against Lao 
infiltration routes and North Vietnamese infiltration training areas would 
contribute to the solution of the main problem.(353) Taylor's assessment 
differed from the Air Force position--increasingly accepted by the Joint 
Chiefs--that stopping Hanoi's support of the insurgency was prerequisite 
to a stable government in Saigon.(?) As completed on 21 November, the 
NSC working group's paper on Vietnam outlined three possible courses of 
actions: Option A, US reprisal attacks, intensification of 34A operations, 
resumption of DeSoto patrols, and step-up of Lao T-28 attacks; Option B, 
the "fast/full squeeze" bombing of North Vietnam primarily favored by the 
Joint Chiefs and characterized by Villiam Bundy as "almost reckless" and 
an invitation to Chinese Communi3t intervention; and Option C, a "slow 
squeeze" of air attacks against Infiltration targets in North Vietnam--
all intended to produce an impression cf a steady and deliberate approach 
and permitting the United States a continuing option to proceed or not. 
Option C was favored by William Bundy and by Depnty Secretary of Defense 
John T. McNaughton, who was a member of the working group and who had 
coined the "squeeze" termino1ogy.(355) 
Admiral Taylor arrived in Washington to join the strategy conferences 
on 26 November and presented hi :7; estimate of the situation on the following 
day. Taylor recommended US actions looking toward establishment of an 
adequate government in 3aigon, riprovement in the counterinsurgency campaign, 
and measures to persuade or compel Hanoi to stop its aid to the Vietcong. 
He envisioned a ladder of escalation beginning with intensified covert 
operations, anti-infiltration a.tack:, in Laos, and reprisal bombings--all 
to stiffen South Vietnamese morale; progressing upward to air attacks against 
infiltration objectives in North Vietnam; and ultimately extending to 
destruction of all important fixd targets in North Vietnam. Taylor was 
in favor of undertaking the first step on the escalation ladder. The 
final draft of the NSC working group paper completed on 29 November 
recommended a 30-day first phase of military activity similar to Taylor's 
first step. After the 30 days, thafirst phase actions could be continued, 
or additional measures could be implemented generally in accordance with 
a "Middle C Option," an alternative drafted by McNaughton to be between 
the original long-drawn-out Option C and the two-months' air campaign that 
the Joint Chiefs had prepared when they perceived that Option B would not 
be accepted. President Johnson was briefed on the NSC working group findings 
on 1 December, and he accepted Taylor's premise that a stable South Vietnamese 
government was the main essential to ending the Insurgency. Verbally, 
on 2 December, Johnson accepted the first-phase military actions and indicated 
that subsequent actions would follow an air bombardment scenario generally 
similar to the Middle C Option but 77-ogressing geographically rather than by 
functional target systems. These air attacks against North Vietnam would 
begin against infiltration clojectives immediately beyond the DMZ, progress 
northward to the 19th parallel, and then ultimately encompass strikes

against the Hanoi infields, POL storage, mining of Vietnam's ports, 
and naval blockade. The precise nature of the President's decision 
was not exactly established since a draft NSAM 319, subsequently modified 
by the National Security Council, was not formally published. (3S6) 
Upon returning to Saigon Ambassador Taylor met with Premier Than 
Van Huong on 7 December and emphasized that Washington wanted serious 
attempts made to achieve political stability. At a dinner given by 
General Westmoreland for high-ranking RVNAF officers on the following 
evening, Taylor explained the strong feeling of the US Government that 
the political situation in South Vietnam must be stabilized and future 
coups avoided if further assistance were to be extended for the purpose 
of more effectively prosecuting the war.(357) In Taylor's view it was 
important that US forces participate in air operations in Laos in order 
to demonstrate to South Vietnam that the United States would be willing 
to share in the risks of air actions against North Vietnam. The draft 
NSAM 319 stated that US armed reconnaissance strikes against infiltration 
routes both in the Lao panhandle and in central Laos would signal deeper 
US involvement in the conflict and determination to support the govern-
ments of South Vietnam and Laos. A joint State-Defense message on 
8 December instructed William H. Sullivan, who had just arrived in 
Vientiane as US Ambassador, to request Souvanna Phouma's approval for US 
air strikes against hostile communications routes, and, following Souvanna's 
approval on 10 December, Secretary McNamara established the level of the 
activity --nicknamed Barrel roll--at two missions of four strike aircraft 
apiece each week. A committee of NSC Principals approved weekly designations 
of two LOC segments for armed reconnaissance, each with a fixed target 
for attack with ordnance remaining unexpended at the end of the route sweep. 
Both PACAF and US Navy aircraft were to be committed, and inasmuch as Yankee 
Team coordinating procedures had been used for seven months and were under-
stood, Admiral Sharp ruled that the Yankee Team procedures would be used for 
Barrel Roll, with COMUSMACV serving as the local coordinating authority for 
the Lao air strikes. Souvanna Phouma wanted no publicity for Barrel Roll 
and emphasized that there must be no attacks against non-hostile Lao 
people. The Barrel Roll rules accordingly provided that targets of 
opportunity would be "unmistakably military activity of a transient or 
mobile nature" and provided that fixed installations would be struck 
only in connection with attacks on clearly identified military convoys 
and military personnel or when prebriefed as secondary targets. The 
Barrel Roll missions could not be launched from Thai bases and could not 
be armed with napalm. The Barrel Roll operations orders ran to 15 or 
more pages and allowed combat commanders very little judgment on tactics, 
ordnance, routing, or other such details. (358) 
During September a PACAF assistance team had highlighted the facts 
that the USAF squadrons which were deployed to Southeast Asia were 
generally unfamiliar with the CBUs and AGM-12B weapons they would be 
expected to employ and that few of the tactical jet aircrews knew how

to deliver weapons on a target without setting up a standard peacetime 
gunnery school pattern. (39) In crder to gain familiarity with the new 
weapons without furnishing information aboutthem prematurely to the 
enemy, the Yankee Team escorts had been allowed to load CBU-2As and 
AGM-12B Bullpup air-ground missiles on every third or fourth mission, 
but the pilots were instructed to ase such armament only as a last 
resort.(360) Recognizing the high-aevel national interest in Barrel 
Roll, General Moore assigned the initial mission to the PACAF 80th 
Tactical Fighter Squardron which had F-105 Thunderchief aircraft at 
Korat, and, in addition, Moore personally briefed the leader and 
pilots on the mission, which was to be an armed reconnaissance sweep 
along Route 8 and an expenditure of remaining ordnance against the 
Nape road bridge, just south of the Nape pass. The mission force 
included three RF-101s for pathfind 7?-ri damase assessment, eight

with 750-pound bombs, 2.75-Inch roosts, and 20-mm ammunition. The 
force was a day late getting oositiOned Da Nang, and its results 
were poor when the mission was flown on 14 December. As a result of the 
heavy ordnance load and miscalculation of time/distance of the road 
reconnaissance, the 80th Squardron F-105s arrived at the Nape bridge 
short of fuel and managed only a hurried attack that missed the bridge. 
The US Navy flew Barrel Roll 2 on 17 December, sending four conventional 
A-1H strike aircraft escorted by eight F-.413 fighters on an armed recce 
of Routes 121 and 12 south of MU Gia pass, with the Ban Boung Boa road 
bridge as the fixed alternate. This force did not damage the bridge 
but destroyed eight buildings 07, its f'astern end. Once again General

Barrel Roll missions, General LeMay sent ,lord to General Moore that he 
expected higher professionalism, ern tholgh the restrictions affecting 
the missions were very complex. Aldbassador Sullivan was also critical 
of the destruction of buildings at Ban Boung Boa by the Navy pilots of 
during Barrel Roll 2; although the buildings were part of a supply area 
targeted for T-28 attack, Sullivan pointed out that they were hit by 
mistake, could have been friendly civilian dwellings, and demanded that 
fixed installations should be struck only in connection with attacks on 
clearly identified military personnel or When prebriefed as secondary 
targets. In preparation for Barrel Roll 14, the PACAF 14)4th Squardron 
deployed six F-105s from Okinawa to Da Nang and sent four of them on a 
Christmas Day armed reconnaissance of Route 23 and a strike against the 
military barracks'at Tchepone. This mission went well, though the dive 
bombing attack at Tchepone was considered generally inaccurate. On 
30 December, four US Navy A-ills were the strike nircraft on a reconnaissance

In each of the weekly submissions of Barrel Roll recommendations to 
the Secretary of Defense for consideration by the NSC Principals during 
December, the Joint Chiefs of Staff accepted and included General LeMay's 
urging that CINCPAC should be authorized to select the reconnaissance 
routes and alternate targets for all missions in coordination with Ambassador 
Sullivan, that a minimum of two day and two night armed reconnaissance 
missions (each with a minimum of four strike sorties) should be scheduled 
each week, that the missions ought to be launched from Thai bases, and 
that Barrel Roll operations should be approved on a two-week or longer 
basis rather than on weekly schedules.(362) For the week of 4.-10 January 
1965 a USAF night armed reconnaissance was authorized along Route 7, and 
General Moore made preparations to lay on the mission employing a C-130 
flare dropping aircraft and F-100 Night Owl strike aircraft, the F-100s 
being selected because the B-57 crews who were being trained for night 
operations at Clark Air Base were not yet qualified. General Maddux, 
however, objected that such a mission was premature, and Barrel Roll 7 
was postponed until the C-130/F-100 combination could make several 
practice missions.(363) As a result of the postponement, the 2d Air Division 
did not fly a Barrel Roll mission on the week of 4.-10 January. For the 
week 12-17 January, the NSC Principals authorized a larger day effort for 
USAF and a night mission for the US Navy. The USAF mission authorized 
up to 15 strike aircraft and 8 aircraft for flak suppression against the 
Ban Ken highway bridge on Route 7, and the US Navy mission was to be a 
night armed reconnaissance along Route 23, with the Tchepono southeast 
military area designated as the secondary.target. The US Embassies in 
Saigon and Vientiane promptly protested that secondary targets should not 
be designated for night attack because of the danger of mistaken identifica-
tion; Admiral Sharp was unwilling to accept this as a general rule but 
he agreed to cancel the Tchepone military area because it was too close 
to civilian houses. (36)..) 
The American intelligence community in Vientiane had long considered 
the Ban Ken bridge to be the most significant potential choke-point on 
Route 7, and the Communists obviously agreed with the assessment since 
photography showed that the bridge was defended by 34. antiaircraft weapons 
(37/57-mm), with up to 70 additional firing positions Which had been built 
but were not occupied. Because of the flak, Yankee Team and earlier Barrel 
Roll missions had been directed to avoid the Ban Ken area, and 2d Air Division 
mission planning for Barrel Roll 9 gave proper deference to the target defenses. 
The 2d Air Division scheduled an RF-101 as pathfinder and another RF-101 for 
BDA, eight F-100s loaded with CBU-2As for flak suppression, and 16 F-105s of 
the 44th and 67th Tactical Fighter Squardrons as strike aircraft, the plan 
being that the two flights of F-100s would fly low-level and line abreast across 
the flak positions and knock them out with cluster bombs and immediately after 
this the F-105s would attack the bridge. The first eight F-105s were each 
loaded with eight 750-pound bombs, but since weaponeering predicted only a 
two-thirds probability that the bridge could be destroyed with iron bombs 
the second eight F-105s were each loaded with six bombs and two AGM-12B 
Bullpup air-ground missiles, the concept being that the guided missiles would 
increase the probability of target destruction. An Air America C-123 was

assigned to serve as the airborne rescue control aircraft for rescue 
helicopters. The concentration of mission aircraft at Da Nang probably 
advertised the impending strike to the 'Communists, and the mission was 
weathered out on 12 January, giving the North Vietnamese an additional 
time to make preparations. Under Yankee Team constraints, Washington 
had to be given 36-hours notice of a reconnaissance mission, making it 
next to impossible to get immediate pre-strike photography for the 
delayed Ban Ken mission, and in the interval between the most recent 
Yankee Team photos and the strike time the North Vietnamese shuffled a 
part of their weapons to other prepared positions outside the areas to 
be covered by the F-100s. As a result when the strike began on 13 January, 
the F-100s hit the prebriefed flak positions very well but other weapons 
continued to fire. The first wave of F-105s and the F-100s continued to 
make multiple passes on the flak eMplacements. One F-100 was shot down 
on a fifth pass, and in view of their mixed ordnance each of the second-
wave F-105s had to make three passes to expend their weapons. The F-1058 
also had to go down into the range of the flak gums to control their 
AGM-12As to targets, and one of the F-105s was shot down. Both downed 
pilots were picked up by Air America helicopters ,but the strike cost 
two aircraft and damages to four others. In his critique, General Moore 
stated that the strike aircraft should have withdrawn promptly when the 
bridge was destroyed, thus escaping the losses.(365) Although Vientiane 
had predicted that the Ban Ken bridge would be almost impossible to by-
pass, the Communists had no such difficulty; within three days they 
pressed the top of a dam immediately up-river from the bridge into use 
as a by-pass and traffic along Route 7 continued(366) The loss of the 
two aircraft was revealed in a press report and proved embarrassing in 
Washington where Senator Wayne Morse Charged that Lao air strikes were 
in violation of the 1962 Geneva Agreement.(367) 
In a continuation of day Barrel Roll armed reconnaissance missions 
the Seventh Fleet ran successful road sweeps on 2 and 10 January without 
finding enemy vehicles, but Barrel Roll 10 on the 15/16 January committed 
six A-1Hs, for a night armed reconnaissance along Route 23. In the course 
of this mission, the flight leader of the first section became separated 
from the flare plane and, in looking for him, wandered west of Route 23 
and over friendly territory. The flight leader sighted moving trucks 
and attacked them and adjacent buildings in what turned out to be the 
friendly village of Ban Tang Val. Ambassador Sullivan promptly visited 
General Ma to express regret and promise restitution to the six persons 
wounded in the mistaken attack. Ma received the regrets politely but 
insisted that the mistake seriously weakened the good will of the villagers, 
who had first believed that the strike had been made by the Communists in 
retaliation for their cooperation with the Lao government. As a result 
of the incident, Ma made good his deMands that Barrel Roll missions south of 
Route 9 should be confined to the area east of Route 23, thus making the 
southern end of Route 23 the exclusive preserve of the RLAF. Ma also 
insisted that "targets of opportunity" should be limited to vehicle and 
troop movements on or very near the roads, since activities off the roads were 
not apt to be hostile.(368) The incident also confirmed Ambassador Sullivan's

judgment that secondary targets should not be assigned for night armed 
reconnaissance missions. As a result the previously assigned secondary 
target was cancelled when the 2d Air Division accomplished the delayed 
Barrel Roll 7 night mission over Route 7 on 23 January. This mission 
demonstrated the feasibility of the use of a C-130 to drop flares to 
illuminate the route for four F-100s, but the mission did not sight 
any hostile vehicles and did not expend any ordnance.(369) 
By 21 January, Admiral Sharp conceived that the miniscule.Barrel Roll 
effort, conducted on a minimum risk basis under tight direction from 
Washington, had demonstrated that an air interdiction program could be 
run in Laos, if anyone wanted such a program. Sharp insisted that a 
militarily effective interdiction had to be responsive to the tactical 
situation and be continuous and comprehensive.(370) General Harris 
agreed that Barrel Roll had left much to be desired militarily, and, in 
addition, he saw no evidence that it was having anything more than a 
relatively minor psychological impact on Ranoi.(371) In a political 
analysis, Ambassador Sullivan felt that the early Barrel Roll operations 
did not convey a meaningful, steady signal to Hanoi because they jumped 
around without an understandable pattern.(372) The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
suggested that the Barrel Roll missions could be militarily more effective 
if planning and coordination originated in Vientiane, thus permitting use 
of fastbreaking local target intelligence. This view was reinforced by the 
loss of nine T-28s parked at Vientians in an accidental explosion on 
21.1 January, since it was possible that US aircraft would be called upon to 
perform some of the missions which were being flown by the Lao T-28s.(373) 
This emergency did not immediately materialize, however, since CINCPAC 
arranged an immediate transfer of ten replacement T-28s so that there was 
no substantial break in Lao T-28 capabilities. Even though the initial 
Barrel Roll effort was militarily ineffective, US air missions--in context 
with other US support--may have provided political strength to Souvanna 
Phouma at a critical juncture on 31 January-3 February, when the Lao 
government withstood an armed coup led by General Phoumi Nosavan, who was 
defeated and exiled to Rangoon, thus removing a troubling influence. from the 
scene. As this crisis was resolved, a joint US State-Defense directive on 
3 February informed all parties concerned that Washington would continue to 
exercise final control over Barrel Roll missions but would receive suggested 
objectives from Vientiane through CCMUSMACV. Rapid air responses against 
targets developed by immediate intelligence in Laos would continue to be 
handled by Lao T-28s.(374) 
In the same weeks of December 19614 that the limited US air action in 
Laos failed to influence Hanoi's political decision or military capabilities 
for escalation of the Southeast Asian war, the effectiveness of the Saigon 
govelliwent continued to dwindle, and, in the words of General Vo Nguyen Giap, 
the Vietcong triumphantly turned from guerrilla warfare to mobile warfare.

in South Vietnam stabilized were apparently not taken seriously by 
General Khanh and the "Young Turk" generals allied with him, these 
including Ky; the commander of the Vietnamese navy, Chung Tan Cang; 
Nguyen Chanh Thi, the I CTZ commander, and Brig General Nguyen Van 
Thieu. Allegedly to advise him as CINCRVNAF, Khanh established the 
Armed Forces Council on 18 December, and on 20 December, led by Ky 
and Thi, the Armed Forces Council staged a partial coup against the 
provisional civil government of Vietnam. The High National Council, 
which had been serving as a provisional civil assembly, was dissolved, 
and some of its members were arrested. All legislative powers were 
vested in the figure-head Chief of State Suu, and Premier Huong was 
instructed to convene a national constitutional convention within 
three months. In a meeting with Nk, Cang, Thi, and Thieu on 20 December, 
Ambassador Taylor strongly protested the coup, and after this the 
relations between Khanh and Taylor were very strained. Rumors were 
spread that Taylor had demanded that Khanh resign and leave the country, 
that Khanh would be replaced with General Duong Van Minh, and that the 
US advisors were going to take command of the RVNAF forces. At this 
point there was a likely prospect that the feeble Saigon government 
might yield to elements who would negotiate a cease-fire, form a coalition 
with the NLF, and invite the US military advisors to leave. (375) 
In the course of events up until December 196h the widespread 
illusion that the conflict in Vietnam was a ground war in which 
aviation could be expected to make only secondary supporting 
contributions had worked against any maximization of the intrinsic 
capabilities of tactical airpower.(376) Viewed in retrospect, it 
was evident that a proper development and employment of tactical 
airpower could have been the most important means of preventing the 
guerrilla war in Vietnam from developing into a war of movement. (377) 
As it was, however, the relatively small VNAF and USAF capabilities 
were a major factor in preventing the ARVN from being defeated piecemeal 
in ground battles that mounted in intensity throughout South Vietnam 
during December. In battles early in the month the Vietcong tactics 
included the usual initial attack on a government position, ambush of 
relief forces, plus a new determination to stay and fight set-piece 
engagements. The latter undertaking made the enemy troops vulnerable to 
air attacks when they could be managed properly with limited forces. 
On 7 December some two battalions of Vietcong attacked the An Lao district 
headquarters in Binh Dinh province and subsequently ambushed government 
relief forces. In three-day battle friendly losses included 28 killed, 50 
wounded, and 22 missing. VNAF 516th Squadron A-1Hs were called into 
action on 9 December and left 33 enemy dead, a substantial portion of the 
100 enemy casualties estimated as taken in the fighting. On this same day 
near Tam Ky in Quang Tin province, a Vietcong battalion attacked and overran 
a battalion command post and 105-mm howitzer platoon. The enemy troops 
attempted to regain the hill outpost position, where they were engaged by a 
government reaction force. During the day, the VNAF 516th Squardron made

18 A-1H strikes with napalm, rockets, bombs, and cannon in an excellent 
display of tactical air support under the direction of an 0-1A pilot and 
observer who were in the air for a total of ten hours. The last flight 
of four A-1Hs landed at Da Nang after sunset When the ceiling was less 
than 500 feet and visibility was less than a mile. The position was retaken 
and 162 Vietcong were confirmed killed (including 85 by air) while friendly 
losses were 26 killed and 44 wounded.(378) On the night of 10 December, two 
Vietcong battalions attacked outposts at Long My in Chung Thien province and 
on the following two days ambushed relief forces. The first ambush was broken 
up when an Army L-19 and Air Force 0-1F located it and put four covering 
A-1Es on the enemy's camouflaged foxholes, but other ambushes were successful. 
In the roiling fights, US Army helicopters from Soc Trang held off the enemy 
until VNAF A-1H flights could arrive and deliver ordnance in the face of intense 
ground fire that shot down an A-1H and damaged three fighters and five helicop-
ters. Except for the close cooperation between the A-1Hs and the armed 
helicopters an ARVN battalion and regional force company could well have been 
overwhelmed, but instead the closely cooperating A-is and armed helicopters 
were credited with killing some 400 of the 1,500 Vietcong engaged on 11 and 
12 December. (379) The day-time Vietcong attacks were accompanied by a rising 
tempo of night attacks against hamlets and outposts, which soared to a new 
intensity following 20 December, when the Vietcong celebrated the anniversary 
of the creation of the National Liberation Front. During the month 96 outposts 
and hamlets were supported by flare and strike aircraft, and 94. of the attacks 
were broken off. Although still under test, the AC-47 gunships joined the air 
'alerts against night attack and performed excellently in hamlet defense. On the 
night of 24. December, for example, an AC-47 used its miniguns to blast 
guerrillas off the wall of a fort which the Vietcong were attempting to 
storm. (380) 
On Christmas Eve, Vietcong terrorists detonated a 300-pound explosive 
charge in the Brink Hotel bachelor officers quarters for US advisors in down-
town Saigon, killing two Americans and wounding over 100. This provocation was 
deliberately aimed at the United States, but an even more serious crisis was 
shaping up in Phuoc Tuy province, about 40 miles southeast of Saigon. In 
preparation for mobile warefare, the Vietcong had formed the 9th Division in War 
Zones C and D during the autumn and had shifted the division's regiments to Xuyen 
Moc in eastern Phuoc Tuy where they rendezvoused with seaborne deliveries of new 
automatic weapons and prepared for field service. During the night of 27/28 
December, two 9th Division regiments attacked and overran the new life hamlet 
of Binh Gia. On the morning of 28 December, a reinforced ARVN Ranger battalion, 
supported by three armed helicopters, attempted to relieve the hamlet but made 
no progress. During the night of 28/29 December three of the Ranger companies 
were attacked by the Vietcong at the town of Ngai Clap, and the AOC received the 
first request for air support at 1950 hours. The AOC committed a VNAF C-47 flare 
ship and one of the AC-47 gunships, the latter providing minigun fire support 
for an hour and twenty-one minutes, after which the Rangers reported the 
attack had been broken off. (381) On the morning of 29 December the Ranger 
companies moved out of Ngai Giao toward Binh Gia while 24 US Army 
CH-lBs, supported by 15 armed UH-lBs airlifted two companies of the 33d 
Battalion to a landing area near Binh Gia, where three of the helicopters

were Shot down by intense snail arms and machine gun fire. One of the 
Ranger companies fought its way to safety but the other was over-run. 
There was no pre-planning coordination of tactical air support for the 
heliborne operation, and fighters were not requested until 1430 hours, 
after the three helicopters had been shot down. These eight A-1E sorties 
provided cover for the downed UH-IBs and expended their ordnance around 
the crash site. During the day, four VNAF H-34s lifted ammunition into the 
area and evacuated wounded. A C-47 flareship kept the area illuminated 
on the night of 29/30 December. On 30 December the 2d and lith Marine 
Battalions were lifted into the area by 26 UH-Bs, once again covered by 
15 armed UH-IBs. Eight of the helicopters were hit by intense fire and one 
exploded, killing the crew. On the afternoon of 30 December, four A-lEs 
and five A-1Hs responded to requests and struck two locations in the rubber 
forests surrounding Binh Gia which reportedly sheltered two Vietcong 
battalions. During the day, eight VNAF H-34s airlifted 34 killed and 49 
wounded men. On the night of 30/31 December, one C-47 and four A-lEs and 
one of the AC-47s provided illumination and fire support. (382) 
On 31 December the 4th Marine Battalion fought its way into the rubber 
forest Where the UH-1B had been shot down the day before, and the battalion 
was shortly surrounded by an enemy force which for the first time was 
identified from captured documents as the 58th Main Force Vietcong Regiment. 
The Marine commander relayed requests for air support through the USAF FAC 
overhead. The friendly positions were marked with smoke and surrounding 
targets were hit with napalm and general purpose bombs by four A-lEs. In 
mid-afternoon the Marine commander requested the airborne FAC to get eight 
more AlEs to attack enemy troops that were digging in around him. The 
eight A-lEs were scrambled and dispatched to the battle area, where the 
overall ARVN commander ordered them returned to Bien Hoa, statiDg that the 
strikes were not necessary and that if air support were to be provided it 
must be requested through ARVN channels. In the late afternoon, armed 
helicopters attempted to strike the Vietcong, but US Marine Corps advisors 
with the embattled battalion reported that the thick branches of the rubber 
trees absorbed the rockets and machine gun fire of the helicopters. The 
Vietcong attacked at dusk, using massed automatic weapons, and overwhelmed 
the 4th Marine Battalion. During the night of 31 December/1 January, 3 
C-47s, 2 C-123s, 1 AC-47, and 4 A-ilBs provided flare/fire support, but only 
232 of the 532 men of the 4th Marine Battalion managed to struggle back to 
Binh Gia. (383) 
On 1 January 1965, following the identification of the 58th Vietcong 
Regiment and. the virtual destruction of the 33d Ranger and 4th Marine 
Battalions, General Khanh took personal charge of a very large operation 
set aftot in Phuoc Tuy province. The 1st and 3d Airborne Battalions were

area by helicopters, and on 2 January the 7th Airborne Battalion was 
lifted directly from Bien Hoa by helicopters. These continuing operations. 
were strongly supported by tactical fighters, which flew cover and escort, 
landing zone preparations, and strikes against reported enemy positions. 
On the afternoon of 5 January, eight A-].Es, each loaded with one Lazy Dog 
( or Elda) XM-1.14 oannister as well as normal high explosive ordnance, first 
employed the Lazy Dog missiles in combat drops against Vietcong troops who 
were firing at US Army heliborne observers. The ARVN troops did not attempt 
to enter the areas where the Lazy Dogs were dropped, but the US Army air 
observers reported that after the drops they observed no personnel moving 
and received no more ground fire. An intelligence report received on 
8 January stated that 15 oxcart loads of dead and wounded Vietcong were 
seen being carried away from the strike areas.(384) At General Khanhis 
insistence the ARVN battalions continued to sweep through the safer areas 
of Phuoc Thy province, with tanks and armored vehicles, and from 10 January 
through 15 February a stib-ASOC of the III ASCC was manned at Vung Tau to 
manage continuing air support for the massive sweeps, which accomplished 
next to nothing since the Vietcong evaded ground contact. (385) 
Immediately after the bombing of the Brink Hotel, Ambassador Taylor, 
Admiral Sharp, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended a US reprisal, 
but President Johnson ruled against it on 29 December. The battle at 
Binh Gia provided a "highly visible" defeat of serious proportions, and, 
on 31 December, Ambassador Taylor, Deputy Ambassador Johnson, and General 
Westmoreland sent a joint message to Washington expressing their assessment 
that the United States should go ahead with air actions against North Vietnam, 
despite weaknesses in the Saigon government. In the next several weeks, US 
policy was under survey and was being affected by somewhat varying estimates 
of the situation in Vietnam. (386) 
Analysis of the Binh Gia defeat immediately following the event revealed 
the defects in coordination of planning for tactical air support of heliborne 
operations and failure properly to utilize available fixed-wing air support. 
The 2d Air Division rationalized that the inability of the armed helicopter 
to provide effective firepower was adequately demonstrated, and the immediate 
MACV J-3 report of the Binh Gia battle stated that "the armed UH-1B did not 
possess heavy enough ordnance to destroy the VC's in prepared positions or 
deter their assault, since they were concealed under a complete canopy of 
trees.?(387) The defeat at Binh Gia also served to focus attention on 
available air strike resources. In the first days of 1965, available strike 
aircraft in South Vietnam numbered 4.8 USAF A-1Es and 92 A-1Hs, the combined 
force being capable of about 60 combat and 30 training sorties a day. As 
has been seen, USAF A-1E combat capabilities were reduced by the necessity 
to carry a Vietnamese national, and VNAF combat capabilities were less than 
maximum because of several factors, one of the more important being Air Vice 
Marshal Kyte concenawith politics and neglect of operational matters. The 
elite "Palace Guard" alert force of at least five VNAF A-1Hs kept constantly

ready at Tan Son Nhut, reduced VNAF strike potential. Although individual 
VNAF strike areas had performed valiently in December crises, commanders of 
VNAF air units in the I and CTZs displayed growing independence. Thus the 
VNAF 62d Wing had been established at Pleiku to support the II CTZ, but the 
Vietnamese airmen had never liked this remote station in the central high-
lands. In the first week of January the 62d Wing took advantage of the fact 
that work on a new runway would begin during February and elected to move 
immediately to Nha Trang. The detachment of 516th Squadron A-1Hs accompanied 
the move, and with their relocation to Nha Trang the A-is were too far distant 
to provide effective support in the critically important highland provinces, 
including Pleiku and Kontum.(388) 
In the immediate aftermath to Binh Gia, Ambassador Taylor was in favor 
of employing the USAF B-57s that were at Bien Hoa for added air support and 
indefinitely postponing organization of the fifth and sixth VNAF fighter 
squadrons, thus allowing VNAF to concentrate on operations in a very 
critical period. (389) In a more far-reaching proposal on 12 January, PACAF 
published a broadly conceived study of VNAF/USAF tactical strike aircraft 
requirements, posing the need for 13 tactical strike squadrons in Vietnam 
(including seven USAF jet squadrons), for additional USAF ALOs and TACPs in 
order to extend direct air support nets to province (sector) chief levels, 
and for a total of 175 USAF and VNAF 0-1s, with more to be required if 
continuous visual air reconnaissance were authorized.(390) General Westmoreland 
considered that the helicopter gunships "performed magnificently" in the battle 
of Binh Gia but that additional firepower was urgently needed to cope with 
the heavily armed enemy regiments. Westmoreland was also intensely interested 
in getting saturation bombing attecks against enemy strongholds. Early in 
January, the MACV J-3 division--working without advice from the 2d Air 
Division--drew up an air requirements study which visualized the employment 
of US Navy carrier-based aircraft And USAF Strategic Air Command B-52s in 
support of operations within South Vietnam. This study justified the 
employment of aircraft from out-of.country because of the 
scarcity of airfields in South Vietnam, the inability of ARVN forces 
to provide security against Vietcong attack at the existing airfields, 
and the logistical difficulties of moving air ordnance and aviation 
fuel to the airfields in South Vietnam. (391) 
In recognition of the vulnerability of the South Vietnamese airfields 
to Vietcong attack, the USAF had proposed on 9 December that US ground 
combat forces should be introduced into South Vietnam for airfield protection 
if Admiral Sharp determined it were necessary. The other US service 
representatives disagreed, the Navy and Marines because it was contrary to 
policy and the Army because up to four divisions would be required to provide 
static defense of 18 operating locations.(392) As soon as General Moore 
learned of the MACV J-3 air requirements study, he prntested that it was a 
violation of General Westmoreland's often voiced statement of policy that 
the 2d Air Division would provide the MACV staff with assistance and advice 
on air matters, this in view of the fact the MACV staff was not adequately 
manned with Air Force expertise. At a briefing for General Westmoreland on 
2/4 January, the 2d Air Division presented a requirements concept following 
the lines outlined by PACAF.(393)

While the air requirements were under study, the MACV military 
evaluation of effectiveness took heart .from the observation that the 
Vietcong appeared after Binh Gia to have been unready to continue 
to wage conventional war. With political stability and durability, 
the RVNAF appeared capable of initiative and of significant advances 
in accomplishing the military tasks of counterinsurgency. (39L) A 
MACV immediate press release issued in January on the increased use of 
air power in Vietnam estimated that 2,500 Vietcong were killed by air 
in November and December 1964.(395) This press release raised the 
question as to whether more strike planes were required. During 
January, VNAF/USAF A-is flew 2,339 combat operational sorties, and 
every request for close air support was filled. On the other hand, 
approximately 50 percent of the total requests for all categories of 
air activity were not filled, but here it was estimated that if the 
total sortie capability of VNAF/USAF (4,550 strike sorties) had not 
been reduced by operational restrictions all tactical air requirements 
could have been met.(396) 
In a test of saturation bombing during the three days starting on 
19 January, VNAF and USAF A-is dropped 800 tons of high explosives on 
pre-planned targets in the Boi Loi woods of Zone D, and following the 
bombing Ranch Hand aerial spray-equipped C-123s began a massive defoliation 
program against the 4.8-square miles of dense forest at Bol Loi that was 
considered the cover for a major Vietcong base. This consumed a large 
proportion of VNAF-USAF strike capabilities. In Operation Tien Giang 3/65 
conducted on 26 January near Ap Bac, two ARVN battalions surrounded an 
nemy battalion, an, in combined helicopter gunship and A-1 strikes, 
tactical air accounted for half of the estimated 00 enemy killed in the one-day 
action.(397) Late in January, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff found some 
optimism as they examined the use of US aircraft, and on 27 January they 
obtained approval only for a restrictive arrangement whereby US jet aircraft 
could be employed in a strike role within South Vietnam provided Ambassador 
Taylor concurred prior to each action and also provided such strikes were 
beyond the capability of VNAF A-is. Under this formula, Ambassador Taylor 
was willing to approve jet air strikes only when US lives were at stake or 
in order to spoil attacks launched by masses of Vietcong, as had been the 
case at Binh Gia. Under these arrangements, US jets could be employed 
provided an ASOC certified that conventional aircraft were not available 
and with successive approvals by a CTZ commander, the Vietnamese JGS, 
COMUSMACV, and the US Ambassador.(398) 
During January, President Johnson did not appear to wish to undertake 
air actions against North Vietnam, even though the continued decline in 
effectiveness of the Saigon government strongly indicated in Washington 
that something had to be done to raise South Vietnamese morale.(399) 
On 9 January, General Khanh promised military support for the Huong 
government, but militant Buddhist opposition to Prime Minister Huong 
sealed his fate, and, on 27 January, Khanh and the Armed Forces Council

took over the Government of Vietnam and shortly afterward installed an 
old nationalist, Dr. Phan Huy Quat, as premier. (1400) On 23 January, 
William Bundy spoke of a negotiation in terms of the 1954. Geneva Accords 
as being "the answer" for an independent and secure South Vietnam, and 
on 4. February a Presidential fact-finding mission headed by McGeorge 
Bundy, Special Assistant for National Security Affairs, arrived in 
Saigon with instructions to take a fresh look at the situation from 
which President Johnson expected recommendations either to move ahead 
in more vigorous ways or else begin a process of American disengagement. 
The Soviets also appeared to make a gesture looking toward negotiations. 
In a redirection of Soviet policy following Khrushchevis overthrow in 
October 196/4, Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin had been attempting to 
restore Russian ties with Hanoi. On 6 February, Kosygin arrived in 
Hanoi, where--according to the Red Chinese--he hoped to persuade Hanoi 
to halt military aid to the Vietcong as a precondition to peace talks 
with the United States.(L401) 
At the critical juncture when it appeared possible that new Geneva-
type international negotiations might be in the offing, the Vietcong--
acting, according to intelligence available to Secretary McNamara, on 
directions from Hanoi--orchestrated a series of attacks specifically 
designed to inflict casualties on Americans. At 0200 hours on Sunday 
morning, 7 February, Vietcong mortar squads and demolition teams 
simultaneously attacked the II CTZ headquarters compound and Camp Holloway 
at Pleiku, killing eight Americans and wounding 126 others. On the 
afternoon of 7 February US Navy aircraft and on 8 February VNAF-USAF 
aircraft flew Flaming Dart I reprisals against barracks and staging areas 
in the southern reaches of North Vietnam. On 10 February, the Vietcong 
blew up an American barracks at Qui Nhon, killing 23 Americans and 
wounding 21 others. Executed on 11 February, Flaming Dart II sent US 
Navy, VNAF, and USAF aircraft against other troop barracks in the North 
Vietnamese panhandle. Coincident with Flaming Dart I, PACAF air 
transports lifted USMC light antiaircraft missile units from Okinawa to 
Da Nang and commenced withdrawal of US dependents from South Vietnam. (i02) 
In addition to the intensive attacks against Americans on 7-10 
February, ARVN control quickly deteriorated in all of the CTZs. A 
major Communist offensive forged across Route 19 between Pleiku and 
Qui Nhon enveloping ARVN defense troops, and on 8 February the enemy 
decimated two battalions of the ARVN 40th Regiment and a troop of 
M-115 armored personnel carries in Vinh Binh province. On 8 February, 
four A-lEs dropped Lazy Dogs against enemy concentrations surrounding 
an ARVN battalion on Route 19, and US Army advisors estimated that 100 
enemy troops were killed by the small free-falling winged bullets. In

this same area on the night of 8/9 February, an AC-47 gunship fired 
20,500 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition. An ARVN sergeant, who escaped 
from the Vietcong after the minigun strike, had seen 80 to 90 bodies 
and estimated as many as 250 of the enemy were killed by the AC-47 
attack. In a move to shore up II CTZ defenses, General Moore ordered 
a detachment of eight A-lEs to Qui Nhon on 13 February. Colonel Bethea 
considered operating conditions at Qui Nhon to be "unsafe in every 
respect," but, operating at close range to the scene of action, the 
A-1E pilots each flew at least three strike sorties a day, and the 
small detachment may have been the major factor in the blunting of 
the enemy offensive.(403) 
Although the major Communist offensive was taking place on the 
Pleiku-Qui Nhon axis across central South Vietnam, Saigon was endangered 
by the Vietcong 9th Division, which had at least two well-armed regiments 
under forest cover in Phuoc Thy province. The full dimensions of this 
threat were apparent on 16 February, when a US Army helicopter pilot 
discovered and VNAF A-1Hs sank a steel-hulled vessel at Vung Ro bay, 
leading to discovery of 100 tons of weapons and ammunition in a nearby 
cove at Cap Varella. This incident solved the mystery of haw the Vietcong 
were getting modern weapons, and would lead to the US Seventh Fleet's 
"Market Time" naval patrols off South Vietnam. Meanwhile, on 17 February 
General Westmoreland secured emergency authority to begin USAF B-57 
light bomber attacks against Vietcong 9th Division base camps in Phuoc Yen 
which were pinpointed under forest cover by infrared air reconnaissance. 
This authority to use USAF jets was quite important two days later when 
Saigon's defenses were gravely reduced by a dissident ARVN revolt against 
General Khanh and Prime Minister Quat. The coup battalions seized Saigon 
and captured a part of Tan Son Nhut in an effort to ground Ky's anti-coup 
force. Once again, icy used VNAF A-1Hs as a force for stability, and VNAF 
C-47s brought loyal troops under General Thi from the I CTZ to clear 
Saigon of the rebels on 20 February. Previously Ky and Thi had kept 
Khanh in power, but now the Armed Forces Council removed Khanh as CINCRVNAF 
and sent him out of the country. At the same moment that the coup crisis 
was at its height on the afternoon of 19 February, 24B-57s of the 8th and 
13th Bomb Squadrons flew the first USAF in-country mission and bombed 
Vietcong base camps in Phuoc Tuy. The B-57s continued to attack in Phuoc 
Thy on 21-24 February, while Ky held most of the VNAF A-1Hs out of combat 
operations in an extensive countercoup alert.(40)3) 
On 13 February, President Johnson authorized the beginning of sustained 
Rolling Thunder air attacks against North Vietnam. The beginning of these 
operations was delayed by the attempted coup in Saigon, but, by 21 February, 
General Westmoreland judged that the United States was "fully committed to 
winning the war in Vietnam" and indicated that he was ready to make more and 
more use of USAF jet aircraft within South Vietnam, to restore US markings

on the USAF A-lEs, and eliminate the requirement for Vietnamese observers 
in the A-lEs. The requirement for US. jet air support materialized on 
2).; February, when an elite Communist battalion, apparently newly arrived in 
the central highlands, surrounded an ARVN Ranger company and a CI DG company 
on Route 19 in the An Khe valley near the Mang Yang pass through the central 
mountains, approximately the same site where the Vietminh had destroyed a 
French mobile group in 19514. Westmoreland used his emergency authority and 
authorized an all-American relief effort in which US Army UH-lBs would extract 
the surrounded men with cover and support by F-100s, B-57s, and A-lEs. The 
covering attacks by 613th Tactical Fighter Squadron F-100s, 405th Tactical 
Wing B-57s, and 602d Air Commando Squadron A-lEs cost the enemy 150 men 
killed and permitted the UH-lBs to make three lifts into the objective 
area and to extract the 220 officers and men who--in the assessment of 
Colonel Theo C. Ataxis, US Army II CTZ advisor--otherwise would have been 
lost, all without a single friendly casualty.(L05) 
The employment of the USAF B-57s and F-100s marked the beginning of 
the end of the long "US combat advisory" phase of the Indochina war. 
Effective on 1 March, the new CINCRVNAF, Major General Tran Van Minh, 
issued the long awaited RVNAF High Command directive officially 
establishing the VNAF air request net as the primary means to obtain 
immediate air support for all regular and paramilitary requirements, 
and VNAF agreed to drop the mandatory restriction that only a VNAF FAC 
could mark targets for air strikes.(406) At General Moorets request, 
General Westmoreland recommended removal of restrictions on the operations 
of USAF air commando A-lEs. After approval by higher authority, the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff on 9 March issued instructions that PACOM aircraft could 
be used for operations in South Vietnam, provided that strikes into South 
Vietnam were not launched from Thai airfields and that US aircraft should 
not be used for strikes that could be executed by VNAF on a timely basis. 
Air commando aircraft were now to be permanently marked with US insignia 
and combat operations no longer required Vietnamese personnel aboard the 
US aircraft.(407) On 12 March, PACAF completed a new tactical air require-
ments study which include a requirement for three additional USAF squadrons 
of 0-1s to be employed for expanded forward air control and saturation 
surveillance purposes as well as a need for additional jet fighter squadrons 
to be based in South Vietnam. In a military survey of the Vietnam situation 
for the Joint Chiefs early in March, the US Army Chief of Staff, General 
Harold K. Johnson, recommended that requirements for additional jet fighters be 
given further study but recommended the three additional USAF 0-1 squadrons 
for maximum air surveillance. This recommendation was approved by President 
Johnson on 15 March.(408) These decisions to terminate the combat advisory 
phase of American support and to permit US air operations within South 
Vietnam were not lightly taken, since they involved an Americanization of 
South Vietnam's war. In the spring of 1965, however, there appeared to be
