 1067 WH.                 FREE CHOICE FOR PUERTO RICO
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   The Communists have long used the subject of alleged
 U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico as a theme for their propaganda output,
 particularly in Latin America but also in underdeveloped countries of
 Africa and Asia.     They have claimed that the island is economically ex-
 ploited by the United States, that it is used as a vast military base
 for aggression against "fraternal nations," that its young men are used
 as cannon fodder of American aggression and that the United States is
 deliberately wiping out the Puerto Rican cultural heritage in order to
 substitute monopoly capitalism in its stead.
 These themes were prominently played at the January 1966 Tri-
 Continent Conference in Havana where delegates endorsed the "struggle"
 of the Puerto Rican Pro-Independence Movement (MPI) and advocated that
 it be given "moral, economic, and every other kind of aid."  A-represen-
 tative of the MPI was appointed to the executive secretariat of the Afro-
 Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization (AALAPSO), which
 was created at the Havana Conference.
 A joint U.S.-Puerto Rican Status Committee, appointed in 196+ to
 study relations between the continent and the island, issued a report in
 August 1966 recommending a plebiscite on the island to determine whether
 Puerto Rico should be (1) a commonwealth,(2) a state, or (3) an independent
 nation.   The proposed plebiscite was ' immediatelyl.abelled a farce by the
 AALAPSO and its executive secretariat proclaimed 23 September a day of tri-
 continental solidarity with the Puerto Rican "struggle."  Castro's Prensa
 Latina on 7 September disseminated both the AALAPSO solidarity appeal and
 a statement signed by Juan Mari Bras, Secretary General of the MPI, warning
 that the imposition of a "spurious and fraudulent plebiscite" might provoke
 a civil war.   On 8 September Prensa Latina carried an interview with Mari
 Bras who indicated that the status committee's report should spur the U.N.
 Special Committee on Colonialism to speed up discussion of the Puerto Rican
 case.   Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa last October had formally requested
 that the U.N. Committee inscribe the Puerto Rican case on its agenda --
 despite the fact that a U.N. resolution of 27 November 1953 had recognized
 that Puerto Rico was a "fully self-governing and autonomous entity" and thus
 not subject to the committee's jurisdiction.
 The AALAPSO call for a day of solidarity with Puerto Rico was glee-
 fully accepted by the Communist nations.  Pravda, Moscow, printed an
 article on the 23rd, NCNA, Peking, reported "Chinese Mass Organizations

 Support Puerto Rican Independence," and the Chicom government (though
 preoccupied with its domestic troubles) sent a telegram to the MPI an=
 noucing its solidarity.   As could be expected, Havana also printed arti-
 cles, made speeches, and sent telegrams.
 In December 1965, Moscow Radio had already said it would make its
 microphones available to Puerto Rican "fighters for independence," claim-
 ing that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission had prohibited
 Puerto Rican radio and TV stations from carrying MPI programs.   Conse-
 quently, said Radio Moscow, it was "setting up a new section for Puerto
 Rican patriots to have their say," and it requested program material
 which would be read by Moscow announcers.   A Moscow broadcast to Latin
 America at the end of August 1966 presented recorded statements by
 Puerto Rican opponents of the plebiscite.   During the same program con-
 tributions were requested to this "feature," although there are no indi-
 cations that it has become a regular aspect of Radio Moscow's Latin
 American programming.
 While Moscow would undoubtedly like to stir up whatever trouble it
 can in Puerto Rico by its propaganda activities, it surely knows that
 the MPI represents an extremely small element (2-3%) of the island's
 population.   The real targets of this propaganda output are the other
 countries of Latin America plus Africa and Asia.   Capitalizing on general
 ignorance of the facts of Puerto Rico's real status, Moscow attempts to
 use this theme to substantiate its claims of "American capitalist, im-
 perialist, colonialist aggression."
 In truth, however, Puerto Rico's story is a heartening one for
 democracy and for private enterprise and brings credit to the United
 States.   Its status of "Commonwealth," more accurately rendered by the
 Spanish "Estado Libre Asociado" (Free Associated State) came into being
 in July 1952.   It was largely the creation of Luis Munoz Marin, the
 first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico.   Under this relation-
 ship Puerto Ricans are responsible for the essential aspects of their
 internal government, which is carried out by a governor and a bicameral
 legislature.   The island enjoys all the economic and financial benefits
 of a state, and other provisions of social legislation, but Puerto Ricans
 do not pay the Federal income tax.
 The economic development of Puerto Rico over the past few decades
 is little short of astounding.   Since 19+0 the Gross National Product
 has soared from a $28.7 million to $2.5 billion and is currently growing
 at the rate of 10 percent per annum, a rate matched only by Israel and
 Japan.  Per capita annual income has increased over seven times, from
 $118 to about $900 (the highest Latin American); manufacturing invest-
 ment has increased from $26.7 million to $435 million; there are now
 over 25,000 automobiles on the island for a population of 2,500,000;
 illiteracy has dropped from 35 percent to 13 percent; there are over
 23,000 students in the island's universities, compared with 5,000 in
 194o.

 Withal,   the island's economy is still only demi-developed, as pre-
 sent Governor Roberto Sanchez Villela put it.   A giant's step has been
 taken, another remains.   Overpopulation is a major problem; the popula-
 tion density is one of the highest on earth and is still expanding rapidly.
 Even though per capita income is the highest in Latin America, it is
 still well below that of Mississippi, the lowest among the 50 states.
 At 13 percent, illiteracy is still high.
 But the most important fact is that these problems are being solved,
 and rapidly.
 The Commonwealth status of Puerto Rico was established as the
 result of a form of compact approved by both the Congress of the U.S.
 and the people of Puerto Rico who, by a large majority, voted on 3 March
 1952 in favoref'A Constitution establishing self-government for the island.
 However, Commonwealth status is free to evolve to meet the changing
 needs of the Puerto Rican people.   This was implicit in the establishment
 of the U.S.-Puerto Rico Status Committee, and in its recommendation that
 a plebiscite be held to enable the people of Puerto Rico to choose between
 continuation of their present status, statehood, or complete independence.
 Ironically, it is the Communists who are now protesting against holding P.
 plebiscite.   Apparently they fear that a plebiscite would show their
 lack of real support.
 An unclassified attachment to this guidance sets forth in somewhat
 more detail the recent history of Puerto Rico, its economy and its         25X1C10 b
 government.

 used by both sides and played an extensive role in "Vltava."  Although
 the Hungarian press mentions radiation problems, it downplays the role
 of nuclear weapons.
 Another notable trend is the pronounced increase in publicity given
 to the Warsaw Pact maneuvers.   Through 1962 there was virtually no press
 coverage of such maneuvers.  The 1963 maneuvers near Dresden were reported
 after their termination; the reports appeared to be a sheepish confession
 that the event, which was well-known to the West, had already taken place.
 The 196+ maneuvers near Burgas were given limited publicity partly, it is
 believed, because of Soviet sensiti#rity to the poor show that was staged.
 In 1965, "October Storm" was broadly publicized before and after the
 maneuvers.   One reason for this,.increase was to ease the fears of the
 populace, who had reacted negatively to the earlier maneuvers in East
 Germany.   Interestingly, the East German press gave a full outline of the
 maneuvers, whereas the central Soviet press suppressed the information on
 the use of nuclear weapons.  This year, "Vltava's" record flood of Bloc
 media output seems to have aimed not only to quiet the fears and impress
 the populace of Eastern Europe, but also to convey to the rest of the world
 the message that the Warsaw Pact forces are armed with the most modern
 means of destruction and are trained to carry out any military assignment.
 SovBloc propaganda also called attention to the ability of Bloc forces to
 come from some distance to the aid of a Warsaw Pact country under attack,
 and to collaborate under complex war conditions.
 Hungarian units added political flavor to "Vltava" by the very fact
 of participating, which the Soviets managed by staging the maneuvers in
 an unlikely location in western Czechoslovakia and by supposing that a
 substantial attack would be launched from Austria.  Westerners have re-
 marked on the "coincidence" between Hungary's first participation in Warsaw
 Pact maneuvers outside of Hungary in over 10 years, and the imminent 10th
 anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution in which the army proved unreliable
 and mutinied.  And in the sphere of intra-Bloc politics, the substitution
 of Hungary for Poland may have been intended in part to dowr}grade  the
 widespread impression that the USSR's Eastern European Bloc is divided
 into a Northern Tier (Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia) and a Southern
 Tier (Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria).
 The selection and phasing of the exercises for "Vltava," as for past
 Warsaw Pact maneuvers, were obviously done by the Soviets in conformity
 with their own strategic planning.* In one way, by having the Czechs absorb
 the brunt of the initial assault and then having reinforcements from the
 *Besides this obvious conclusion based on a study of "Vltava," we may cite
 Czech CP chief Novotny's complaint about the high cost of staging the maneu-
 vers and, implicitly, the complaint that the Czechs didn't get their money's
 worth.

 USSR and neighboring Satellites transported to Czechoslovakia to push
 back the "enemy," the Soviets evidently sought to demonstrate that the
 stationing of their own armed forces in all the Satellites was not neces-
 sarily required for their defense.   The Soviets would thus benefit by
 establishing that their forces could not only be freed from assignment
 to specific areas, but that they could be speedily deployed for effective
 use in many other areas of the world.
 In another way, "Vltava" probably will prove helpful to Soviet mili-
 tary theorists who for the past year or so have been reappraising military
 strategy and doctrine.  Some Soviet military writers have raised serious
 questions concerning Khrushchev's implicit assumption that while general
 war was unlikely, any direct clash between the great powers would inevi-
 tably result in an all-out nuclear war.  Prominent Soviet theorists tend
 to accept the thesis that tactical nuclear weapons might be employed
 without inevitably causing general war. Because of the probable vague-
 ness of the emerging strategy and doctrine (e.g., what types of nuclear
 weapons are contemplated? would they be applied in Europe?)  the results
 of "Vltava" will probably be put to immediate use by the Soviet military
 theorists.

 1069 NE,AF.             NASSER JAILS YEMENI CABINET
 25X1ClOb
 SITUATION:  Nasser,though he has had his ups and downs, has at least
 one unique accomplishment to his credit in the field of geopolitics.   He
 has added a new dimension to the techniques of intervention by his blatant
 breach of trust in arresting the former Yemeni cabinet.
 Nasser acted through Yemeni President Sallal, as he has done ever
 since the Yemeni revolution broke out nearly four years ago.   In late
 September 1966, Sallal returned to Yemen from nearly a year's leave of
 absence in Cairo.   His return provoked an immediate showdown:  the Cabi-
 net, headed by Premier al-Amri, flew to Cairo to demand that Nasser drop
 Sallal, whose pro-Egyptian sentiments are anathema to those republicans
 who want to assert their independence and seek new peace negotiations with
 Yemeni royalists.
 While Sallal in Yemen announced the "resignation" of al-Amri and his
 cabinet, and the formation of a new strongly pro-UAR cabinet headed by him-
 self, the Egyptians in Cairo arrested all the former cabinet who had gone
 there to protest the return to Yemen of his protege and handyman.
 Sallal has now taken over as Prime Minister as well as President, and
 on 23 September announced a new foreign policy for the Yemen Arab Republic,
 its principal doctrine being "The Government policy now follows the same
 revolutionary line of policy that the UAR pursues."
 The UAR's move completely erases any illusions that the Sallal gov-
 ernment rests on a popular basis; pressure to change the regime in Yemen
 has mounted, and violence including an attempt on Sallal's life on 29
 September, has erupted.  Widespread arrests of anti.-Egyptian elements in
 Yemen, including military commanders, merchants, government officials,
 and powerful tribal leaders, have added to the tension and instability.
 These actions also raise serious questions as to the extent of Soviet
 machinations throughout the Middle East, and the degree to which Nasser
 is being used as an advance-man, preparing the ground for the eventual
 Sovietization and communization of the area.

 At the beginning, the Soviet and Chinese Communist efforts in South
 Arabia were distinct and separate from each other and from that of the
 UAR.   The UAR was the first of these three powers to establish a closer
 relationship with Yemen than minimal diplomatic representation.   Exploit-
 ing the ambitions and weaknesses of the then Crown Prince of Yemen,
 Muhammad Badr, Nasser was able to win him over to his own concept of
 Arab Unity and Socialism.   In 1956, under the advice and guidance of the
 UAR, Badr established diplomatic relations with the countries of the Sino-
 Soviet Bloc; he also asked for and received economic aid from those coun-
 tries, thus spreading an official welcome mat for communist presence in
 the Yemen.  The UAR, finding Badr difficult to control, decided to develop
 a new instrument for its covert action in Yemen -- a policy that resulted
 in the September 1962 coup and the establishment of a pro-UAR "Republican"
 government under Sallal.
 The Soviets were well aware of the subversive role played by the UAR
 in the Arabian Peninsula, and helped to assure the UAR's success in Yemen
 by supporting the costly military, paramilitary and subversion activities
 of the Egyptians.
 The willingness of the Soviets to underwrite the efforts of the UAR
 in Yemen and the Federation of South Arabia underscores a gradual and
 subtle change in the ideological orientation of the UAR, and illustrates
 the new relationship that has developed between the Soviet Bloc and the
 UAR.  Nasser's Arab Socialist Union attained recognition at the 23rd Con-
 gress of the CPSU in March 1966 when it was awarded the status of a fra-
 ternal party.   This change also led Arab communist party leaders to in-
 struct their followers that there was no difference between Arab Socialism
 and "Scientific Socialism" (i.e., Communism), thus implying that Nasser's
 retention of nationalism and religion in Arab Socialism was temporary
 window-dressing.   Calls for unity and cooperation among "progressive" mass
 organizations, such as the Arab Socialist Union, communist parties and ex-
 treme socialists, soon spread throughout the Arab world.
 The Chicoms have for the most part remained aloof from the Soviet-UAR
 presence in Yemen.   And to a degree, the Soviets themselves have maintained
 a hands-off policy in the political situation in Yemen, leaving this field
 to their Egyptian surrogates.   However, there is probably no facet of eco-
 nomic, military, or political life in the South Arabian Peninsula that is
 not affected by the activity of these countries, concentrated in the YAR.
 The country with the largest force there is the UAR with approximately
 550,000 troops.   In addition, the Egyptians have a large number of "advisers"
 at all levels of government in the YAR who exert almost absolute control
 over the decisions and policies made by the government.   The secondary
 schools are almost completely staffed by Egyptian teachers, in a position
 to influence and indoctrinate the comparatively few students who will be
 the future leaders of Yemen.   The Soviet Union has approximately 800 offi-
 cial personnel, including some 70 military, technical and economic advisors
 and 38 persons assigned to the diplomatic mission; the remainder are teachers,
 doctors and nurses.  The third largest group is that of the Chinese Communists

 (over 400) who tend more to remain apart.  Like the Soviets, they do
 not outwardly appear to be directly involved in the local political
 situation.   They have not attracted many Yemenis to their ideology,
 yet they are working steadily to improve their image among the people
 and the government.  As their aid projects come to completion, the im-
 pact of their presence will be significant.   The official missions, and
 economic and technical advisors of the Eastern European Bloc countries
 add to this powerful Nasserite and Communist presence.
 In the YAR, the Egyptians control all propaganda media.   Radio
 and press releases repeat the official line from Cairo (via MENA, the
 official news agency of the UAR) which in turn often mirrors that of
 the Soviet Bloc.   In addition to MENA, the official Soviet and Chicom
 news agencies,TASS and NCNA, are represented in the YAR.
 Technically, the last Egyptian troops were to have left Yemen by
 the end of September 1966 under a peace agreement signed in August 1965
 by President Nasser and King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, but this died on
 the vine months ago.   Instead of evacuation, Egypt's First Vice-President
 proclaimed at the end of September 1966 that Cairo's objective was to insti-
 tute progress in Yemen and said:   "We are ready to stay there 20 years to
 achieve this."
 But in spite of their overwhelming physical presence, influence in
 the government and control over propaganda media, the Egyptians have not
 been able to create a favorable impression on the Yemeni.   Some Egyptians
 are reportedly beginning to worry over this, and complain that when it is
 all over they will be forgotten while the Soviets and Chicoms will be re-
 membered by the monuments they will have left behind.  Egypt's recent  25X1C10 b
 Coup-by-Abduction will hardly help.

 The alleged "colonialism" of the United States in Puerto Rico has
 long been a pet Communist propaganda theme.  The Communists have
 claimed that the island is economically exploited by the United States,
 that its young men are used as cannon fodder of American aggresssion,
 and that the United States is deliberately wiping out the Puerto Rican
 cultural heritage in order to substitute monopoly capitalism in its
 stead.
 In October 1965 the Cuban government urged the United Nations to
 submit the island's "case" to the UN Special Committee on Colonialism.
 The U.S. delegate promptly pointed out that a United Nations resolu-
 tion of 27 November 1953 recognized Puerto Rico as "a fully self-
 governing and autonomous entity": and thus "not subject" to the com-
 mittee's jurisdiction.  Furthermore, he pointed out, the Puerto Rican
 people themselves freely  approved the institution of the Commonwealth
 by a large majority in a vote in 1952, and have upheld this stance in
 subsequent elections in which candidates for independence have never
 won more than a miniscule part of the vote.
 The view that Puerto Rico is self-governing and autonomous has
 even received some support from Communists.  An article in the Yugoslav
 newspaper, Politika, on 12 September 1965 said that "very few Puerto
 Ricans" considered that there is anything in the links between Puerto
 Rico and the United States which "could smell of a colonial relation-
 ship."  Although the island is not completely independent, it is a
 "self-governing Commonwealth" of the United States.  It has its gover-
 nor who resembles a Prime Minister, while in internal affairs the Puerto
 Ricans are practically independent.  Calling attention to the remark-
 able economic development in recent years, Politika characterized the
 island "a compliment to the homeland, a pleasant, cheerful country
 where human wishes can be satisfied."
 The Communist propaganda charges were renewed at the Tri-Continent
 Conference in Havana in January 1966, where the delegates endorsed the
 "struggle" of the Puerto Rican Pro-Independence Movement (MPI) and
 advocated that it be given "moral, economic, and every other kind of
 aid."   A representative of the MPI was elected to the executive secre-
 tariat of the Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organiza-
 tion (AALAPSO), which was created at the Havana Conference.  It was
 even claimed  at the Tri-Continent Conference that the Puerto Rican
 people overwhelmingly reject the war in Vietnam, which was promptly
 refuted by a vote in the Commonwealth Legislature approving by a near
 unanimous vote (only one against) President Johnson's policy in Viet-
 nam.
 The facts of the case of Puerto Rico are in stark contrast to the
 blatant allegations of the Communist propaganda machine.  Indeed, the
 realities of the island's economic and political life bear so little

 relationship to the Communist contentions that one wonders why they
 should attempt to make such wild claims about it.
 Perhaps the most important fact about Puerto Rico's status is that
 it was cho=3en bjr the Puerto Rican people themselves.  Furthr>r, tii
 status question can be reopened by the people when they so cysire.
 In August of this year a specially appointed U.S.-Puerto Rico Com-
 mission on the Status of Puerto Rico issued a report recommending that
 a plebiscite be held on the island to determine whether its people wish
 to become one of the United States, to become independent, or to
 retain their present status as a Commonwealth.
 The Commission (familiarly known as STACOM) was created at the
 request of former Puerto Rican Governor Luis Munoz Marin, who was
 instrumental in developing the Commonwealth status which was granted
 to Puerto Rico on 25 July 1952, after ratification by the Congress of
 the U.S. and the people of Puerto Rico.  In this system the island is
 self-governing within the framework of a permanent association with
 the United States based on a common market, common citizenship, fiscal
 autonomy, common defense, common currency, and a common loyalty to the
 democratic way of life.  The Commonwealth status has fostered an eco-
 nomic growth which most nations could envy.  However, in July 1962
 Governor Munoz Marin wrote to President John F. Kennedy:  "It seems
 clear that the people of Puerto Rico should be consulted again regard-
 ing the relationship of its government with the United States."  This
 appeal resulted in the creation of STACOM to study the political, eco-
 nomic antisocial aspects of the island's link with the mainland.   The
 commission consisted of six members from the U.S., including Senators
 Javits and Jackson and Ambassador Pat Harris, and six from Puerto Rico,
 including Munoz Marin, Teodoro Moscoso, the former director of the
 Alliance for Progress, Gilberto Concepcion de Gracia, president of the
 Puerto Rico Independence Party (who resigned from STACOM in May 1966),
 and Senator Miguel Garcia Mendez, chairman of the Statehood Republican
 party.  The Commission's Chairman is James H. Rowe.
 The Commission's report, issued after extensive hearings and
 investigations, concluded that:  "The policy governing the relationship
 between the United States and Puerto Rico is and should continue to be
 based on the principles of mutual consent and self-determination."  It
 noted that "an immediate or abrupt change in political status would
 involve serious economic risks and dislocations", but added that "these
 could be offset by special economic and financial arrangements."  The
 commission did not indicate a preference for any of the three choices
 to be offered in the plebiscite, declaring simply that:  "All three
 forms of political status -- the commonwealth, statehood and indepen-
 dence -- are valid and confer upon the people of Puerto Rico equal
 dignity with equality of status and of national citizenship."  The
 choice, then, is to be made by the Puerto Rican people.  If they should
 choose a different status than the present one, the new arrangement
 would be worked out in mutual agreement with the United States Congress.

 The proposed plebiscite was immediately labelled a farce by the
 AALAPSO and its executive secretariat proclaimed 23 September 1966 a
 day of "tricontinental solidarity" with the Puerto Rican "struggle."
 Castro's Prensa Latina on 7 September disseminated both the AALAPSO
 solidarity appeal and a statement signed by Juan Mari Bras, Secretary
 General of the MPI, warning that the imposition of a "spurious and
 fraudulent plebisicte" might provoke a civil war.  The AALAPSO call
 for a day of solidarity with Puerto Rico was gleefully accepted by
 the Communist nations.  Pravda, Moscow, printed an article on the
 subject; NCNA, Peking, reported "Chinese Mass Organizations Support
 Puerto Rican Independence," and the Chinese Communist government (though
 preoccupied with its domestic troubles) sent a telegram to the MPI
 announcing its solidarity.  As could be expected, Havana also printed
 articles, made speeches, and sent numerous telegrams.
 A Moscow broadcast to Latin America at the end of August, pre-
 senting recorded statements by Puerto Rican opponents of the plebiscite,
 asserted that the status commission had recommended a "phony plebiscite,"
 and charged the United States with resorting to "dirty maneuvers... to
 legalize imperialist domination of the country."  Puerto Rican speakers
 on the program denounced the plebiscite, one branding it as "Hiterite."
 In December 1965, Moscow Radio had already said it would make its
 microphones available to Puerto Rican "fighters for independence,"
 claiming that the U.S. Government had prohibited Puerto Rican radio
 and TV stations from carrying MPI programs.  Consequently, said Radio
 Moscow, it was "setting up a new section for Puerto Rican patriots to
 have their say," and it requested that listeners submit program material
 which would be read by Moscow announcers.  The Moscow broadcast at
 the end of August, already mentioned, again requested contributions
 to this "feature" program.
 While Moscow undoubtedly would like to stir  up whatever trouble
 it can in Puerto Rico by its propaganda activities, it surely knows
 that the MPI represents an extremely small element of the island's
 population.  The real targets of this propaganda output are the other
 countries of Latin America, plus Africa and Asia. Capitalizing on
 general ignorance of the facts of Puerto Rico's real situation, Moscow
 attempts to use this theme to substantiate its claims of "American,
 capitalist, imperialist, colonialist aggression."
 In truth, however, Puerto Rico's story is a heartening one for
 democracy and for private enterprise and brings credit to the United
 States.  Its status of "Commonwealth," more accurately rendered by the
 Spanish "Estado Libre Asociado" (Free Associated State) is a unique
 creation under the Constitution of the United States.  Under this rela-
 tionship the Puerto Ricans are responsible for the essential aspects
 of their internal government, which is carried out by a governor and a
 bicameral legislature.  Basically, the island enjoys all the economic
 and financial benefits of a state, but Puerto Ricans do not pay the
 Federal income tax.

 The economic development of Puerto Rico is little short of astound-
 ing.  Since 1940 the Gross National Product has soared from $28.7 mil-
 lion to $2.5 billion and is currently growing at the rate of 10 percent
 per annum, a rate matched only by Israel and Japan.  Per capita annual
 income has increased over seven times, from $118 to about $900 (the
 highest in Latin America)  manufacturing investment has increased from
 $26.7 million to $435 million; there are now over 25,000 automobiles
 on the island for a population of 2,500,000; illiteracy has dropped
 from 35 percent to 13 percent; there are over 23,000 students in the
 island's universities, compared with 5,000 in 1940.  Over 1,000,000
 Puerto Ricans have migrated to the mainland in past years; thus provid-
 ing relief to a burgeoning population problem.  In recent years, how-
 ever, the economic development of Puerto Rico has raised living stand-
 ards there to the point that the migration began to reverse itself in
 1964 and now the current is slightly in the other direction.
 Even with this remarkable success story, which has attracted
 attentive visitors from most of the underdeveloped countries of the
 world, Puerto Rico's economy is still only ",demi-developed," as present
 Governor Roberto Sanchez Villela put it.  A giant's step has been
 taken, another remains.  Overpopulation is a major problem; the popu-
 lation density is one of the highest on earth and is still expanding
 rapidly.  Even though per capita income is the highest in Latin America,
 it is still well below that of Mississippi, the lowest among the 50
 states.
 But the most important fact is that these problems are being
 solved, and rapidly, by the Puerto Rican people themselves.

 EAST GERMAN PRESS ACCOUI 1'S OF WARSAW PACT MANEUVER
 The closing phases  ')f the "Vltava"   Warsaw Pact maneuver in
 Czechoslovakia, which was.concluded with a parade in Ceske
 Budejovice on     25  Septemli?r 1966, received extensive coverage in
 the 22,  23,  24, and 25 September 1966 issues of the Berlin part;  or--

 man forces at the conciu,,:ion of the  :x:erc sc.   Ob:,rst RAUBTCH was
 also  on  the   scene.
 The maneuver pitted the "pink" forces against the "green."
 Both sides employed nuclear weapons.   Fighter aircraft, airborne
 troops, mine-dropping helicopters, and armored, antiaircraft, and
 engineer units participated in various phases.
 Speaking at an international press conference on 23 September,
 Czechoslovak Generalmajor Jan VOSTERA  from the joint maneuver com-
 mand" is quoted in the 24 September 1966 issue of the paper as say-
 ing that the maneuver involved "complex problems of operational com-
 bat actions by      ground forces, Air Force units, and border
 troops."  He added that the exercise was designed to test "the stat-
 rnvaluable

 branches." Additional excerpts describing the action are cited be-
 low.
 (22 September issue) :   "The following situation prevailed on
 the second day, at the beginning of the combat action:   'Pink 'had
 dropped operational airborne forces in the rear area of 'green'.
 They  formed a bridgehead, teamed up with advance  armored forces,
 and secured the landing of additional troop units at a captured air-
 field.   An operation  to gain possession of a crossing at the Vltava
 River was decided in favor of the 'pink 'forces; but .they did not
 succeed in establishing contact between the airborne division and
 the forces of the first echelon  (Staffel).   Only the advance  ele-
 ment achieved this goal.

 The actions on the second day began  with the employment of
 tactical aircraft against the positions of the advance  elements of
 the 'pink 'motorized infantry regiment, following extensive troop
 movements during the preceding night.   Territorial defense units en-
 gaged the landed enemy airborne troops in combat in the densely for-
 ested terrain of the Choustnik Mountain.                Suddenly squadron after
 squadron of fighter bombers from the 'pink 'forces flew low over
 the valley while fighter aircraft, flying in several levels above
 them, guarded the air space."
 The writer then describes troop landings by helicopter which
 are covered by fighter squadrons.  An advance  detachment is landed
 to guard the landing area for successive "pink" forces which will
 reinforce the airborne division.   Mi-6 helicopters,"flying around
 the mountain... before they approach the landing area inthe Talley at
 a height of 20-30 meters," land troorr, mortars, recoilless guns,
 twin antiaircraft guns,   and armored personnel carriers and cross-
 country jeeps equipped with antitank guided rockets.
 "The precise landing is enthusiastically greeted by,the
 maneuver guests.  The excellent cooperation between the motorized
 infantry battalion of the division from Plzen and the Soviet heli-
 copter crews enabled the motorized infantrymen  to be combat ready
 in a very short time and to take advantage of the success achieved
 by the 'pink 'forces the previous day.  The battalion penetrated to-
 ward the south and, together with other units landed during the ear-
 ly morning hours, ensured that the airborne division could join'the
 motorized infantry division of the first echelon of the 'pink'
 forces."
 The next action described takes place on a large hill in the
 vicinity    of Mnich.  The forces fight for possession of a wooded
 mountain range to the east.   "'Pink 'is unable to move up new re-
 serves.   'Green, 'however, can employ two new divisions.  'Pink'
 fighter formations now guard the air space. Suddenly we are con-
 fronted by a 550-meter long black smoke screen.   'Green 'has  demol-
 ished an antitank ditch in order to stop an offensive by the oppo-
 nent and to bring up their own reserves...."
 Fighter bombers subsequently attack the positions of the
 "green" forces.   Two supersonic bombers eject "nuclear bombs."   "A
 red fireball.. glows in the positions of the 'green 'following their
 explosion on the ground....   With this use of nuclear weapons,
 'pink  is preparing its offensive."
 The writer then renders a description of armored units and par-
 atroopers, which spread. out in the valley, attacking the "opponent"
 under cover of artillery fire and aircraft overhead.     "The other side
 tries to attack the ground troops from the air.  Immediately,after-

 wards a bitter struggle for air supremacy begins...."  Both Soviet
 and Czechoslovak pilots participate in this action.
 "Meanwhile, the reserves of the 'green 'forces have approached
 the front...."  The "enemy" quickly takes up a defensive position
 and reinforces his antitank defenses.   "Helicopters, descending up
 to 1 meter,-are laying a nearly 600-meter long mine f.eld as a bar-
 rier.   From the hills, which they control, and which the 'pink'
 forces tried in vain to capture, a Soviet and a Hungarian motor-
 ized infantry division, which had been moved up, are attacking.
 'Pink 'attacks both groups with nuclear weapons.   But the 'green'
 troops  cannot be stopped.   Their commander decides to deliver 2 nu-
 clear blows at the enemy positions.
