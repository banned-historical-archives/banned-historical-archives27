1. I attach a revised concept paper which I believe 
goes some way toward incorporating the advice of the SRP 
as well as my own views on the construct of the paper. 
Paragraph 2 of the revised version makes clear the intended 
direction of the NIE and clarifies central issues to be 
addressed in the paper.

2. The SRP is hesitant to discuss the revised concept 
paper with me until after you have had a chance to react to 
it. I share your concern that a good paper is more important 
than the completion date, and we have decided to cancel the 
meeting with interagency representatives scheduled for 
Friday.

3. You also asked my views on whether the paper needed to 
be done as an NIE rather than an IIM. I believe the subject 
is of interest to policymakers at a sufficiently high level 
that it deserves NFIB review which is afforded an NIE.

Herewith is the speech delivered by 
Chai Zemin before the annual meeting of the 
National Committee on US-Chinese Relations 
In New York on 17 September. As I mentioned 
to you, I found noteworthy the references to 
hegemonism, which must reflect policy guidance 
Chai recently received in Beijing. Also of 
interest is the reference to the situation 
requiring us to view and approach Sino-US

Mr. Chairman Yost, _ 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
It gives me and my colleagues great pleasure to attend 
today's luncheon upon invitation ,nd to meet many of our 
American friends on the occasion of the annual meeting of 
the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. 
Your current annual meeting is being held at a time 
when Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new phase after the 
establisint of diplomatic relations between our two 
countries.- As I see it, this new development will add to 
the significance of this annual meeting. - 
 Over-the-yearsi-the-National-Committee-on-UvS--:-Chima  
Relations has done a lot of work to promote Sino-U.S. cultural 
exchanges and friendly contacts, thus contributing to the 
normalization of Sino-U.S. relations. I will give you only 
one example to illustrate this point: It was the National 
Committee on U.S.-China Relations that played host to the 
Chinese Table Tennis Team, which visited the United States 
in 1971 as a pioneer of the Chinese people for opening 
Sino-U.S. relations. That important decision known as 
the "Ping-Pong Diplomacy" was made by the late Chairman 
Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai. The immediate positive 
Si 
response and warm Aupport to that decision given by the 
National Committee on U.S.-China RelatiOns and American 
friends of all walks of life made it possible for.the 
little ping-pong ball finally to open the door to friendly 
contacts between the Chinese and American peoples. As the 
Chinese -saying goes,"everything's hard at the beginning."

That good beginning paved the way for broader exchanges between 
our two peoples at a later stage. 
Shortly after that visit, the epoch-making Shanghai 
Communique was issued thanks to the outstanding farsightedness 
of the leaders of both countries, a document which charted the 
orientation for developing the relations between our two 
countries. In keeping with the spirit of the Shanghai 
Communique and in cooperation with relevant Chinese organizations, 
the National Committee organized extensive people-to-people 
exchange programmes for sportsmen, journalists, women representativ 
research fellows of international study, educationists, local 
administrative leaders, performing arts groups and travel 
agency workers, etc. These programmes have enhanced the 
mutual understanding between our two peoples and promoted their 
friandship. No doubt, these meaningful exchange of visits 
quickened the pace of normalization of relations, thus bringing 
about the establishment of diplomatic relationsbetween our 
two countries on January 1 this year. I wish to take this 
opportunity to extend our sincere congratulations and profound 
thanks to you for the excellent work the National Committee 
has done in promoting the friendly relations between China and 
the United States. 
The Chinese people are a peace-loving people determined 
to work for the defence of world peace and international 
security together with all other peace-loving countries and 
peoples. What is more, we earnestly want a peaceful international 
environment in order to focus our efforts on realizing the 
four modernizations, so as to lift China out of economic backwardne 
On the other hand, we cannot but note that the world today is

by no means tranquil. Forces seeking military superiority and 
world hegemony are constantly stepping up their offensives and 
creating turmoils everywhere through direct or indirect means, 
Under these circumstances, it has become a most important task 
wor14 
of our times to oppose hegemonism and defend wpisyld peace. 
There exist traditional friendly contacts between the 
Chinese and American peoples. The situation today requires us 
to view and approach Sino-U.S. relations with a politico-strategic 
perspective. In so doing, we will find a common basis for 
strengthening the cooperation between our two countries, both 
in the general aspect and in our bilateral relations. This basis 
wili-be a relliaM and durable one, and ndt a transient expediencyc-
Whoever loses sight of this point or have doubt about it will 
fall behind the historical trend. 
Of course, in view of our different social systems 
and a number of outstanding issues awaiting solution in the , 
relations between our two countries, there may emerge some 
differences between our two countries. This is nothing strange. 
The important thing is not allow, these differences _to, affect 
our cooperation; instead, we should develop our relations on 
the basis of mutual adherence to the internationally recognized 
principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and 
sovereignty, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, 
equality and mutual benefit. 
Since normalization, Sino-U.S. relations have made fairly 
rapid progress in the political, economic, trade, cultural, 
scientific and technological fields. Our two countries have 
since then signed many bilateral agreements, and contacts

people and the American people as well. The development of

i/he Asia-Pacific region and i94he world at large. 
I have just returned from China.- At home, I saw for myself 
a political situation of unity and stability, the promotion and 
strengthening of socialist democracy and legal systems as 
well as vigorous developments on all fronts of our national 
economy under the impact of the policies formulated at the 
second sessicTL the Fifth National People's Congress, 
Starting from this year, we will use about three years to readjust, 
restructure, consolidate and improve our national economy 
and lead our national economy onto a course of sustained 
and proportionate fast development, so as to accelerate 
China's four modernizations. During the next three years 
and in a fairly long period to come, while relying mainly 
on our own efforts, we will study and introduce advanced 
foreign technology and equipment suitable for our needs 
independepent basis. We will actively develop trade and 
mutually beneficial economic cooperation with various countries 
and adopt reasona and customary methods now used abroad 
in accepting foreign inveTents and guarAnteeing their 
legitimate profits. We have already formulated some laws 
and regulations to this effect and will formulate additional 
ones inthe future.

square kilometres and a population of 900 million. With the 
steady development of China's national construction, it is beyond 
all doubt that there will be broad prospects for economic 
cooperation and scientific and cultural exchange between our 
two countries. I would like to quote the two lines from a 
poem dating back to the Tang Dynasty which Vice President 
Mondale used in his speech at Beijing University: We widen 
our view 300 miles by ascending one flight of stairs. Only 
when we stand on a higher plane, can we see far ahead. Let us 
be far-sighted and keep in mind the magnificent prospects for 
the friendly cooperation between our two-great countries over 
  a relatively long historical period. 
Shortly after the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between China and the United States, Vice-Premier Deng paid a 
visit to your country. The Vice-Premier and President Carter 
reaffirmed the principles embodied in the joint communique 
on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and 
the United States and pushed the relations between the two countrie 
to a new high. Recently, Vice President Mondale paid a successful 
,a4a/ 
visit to China ,laid a new groundwork for the further 
development of our relations. I personally had the privilege 
of being a member of Vice-Premier Deng's party during 
his visit to your country and of taking part i osting 
the visit of Vice President Mondale to China. As a witness 
to the latest development of Sino-U.S. relations, I am full 
of fine expectations of the broad vistas for developing mutually 
beneficial cooperation and friendly contacts between our two 
coluntries and peoples. Much remains to/done by us. In the

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505 
17 October 1979 
MEMORANDUM FOR: Richard Lehman 
25X1 FROM 
SUBJECT 
25X1 
: Draft Study of the NIO System 
1. Since I won't be at your meeting on Thursday, I have availed 
myself of your invitation to put my thoughts about your draft staff 
study on paper. I am talking here about tactics, not direction or 
destination (except in the area of integrated research programs). 
2. It is my view that the changes in the NIO relationship with 
NFAC are too explicitly spelled out to support your bureaucratically 
necessary disclaimer that no radical changes are in train. I think 
you are right that NIO withdrawal from NFAC affairs will be slower 
and in the short run less complete than the D/NFAC perhaps now envisions. 
If so, the categorical prohibitions in your draft study will cause 
jurisdictional fights to become greater rather than lesser. Everyone 
recognizes where things are going: Why not let nature take its course? 
3. NIOs were given responsibility for interoffice production 
precisely because such papers were not being written under Office 
Director auspices. It may be that you don't think interoffice papers 
are worth doing. But if they are (and I happen to think they are), 
then they will only appear if responsibility for them is lodged with 
someone who has the substantive expertise to see them through. 
4. Let me reiterate again my views on a useful NIO relationship 
to NFAC-wide research programs in the China and USSR areas, where very 
large numbers of analysts in virtually all NFAC production offices 
are engaged in working on a single country. There is a real role to 
be played by the D/NFAC's senior substantive expert in developing and 
coordinating an integrated research program in these areas. I append 
my effort several years ago as one example of an integrated approach 
to this issue. As I told you, it got good reviews at the time. 
5. Individual production offices are already being encouraged 
to set up their own lines of communications to the NSC, State and 
so forth. No specific dispensation is necessary. The injunction

5/03/24 CIA-RDP831300100R000200200001-2 
that the offices keep the NIOs informed of what they are doing is, 
moreover, unenforceable. NIOs are not being informed of activities 
in this area as things stand now. Your new regulations make it 
impossible even to pretend that the NIOs are in fact the DCI's 
substantive advisor and surrogate in his field or area of expertise. 
6. This is even more true if the NIOs are merely to "advise" 
on the preparation of briefing books, Presidential briefings, etc. 
How are the NIOs to accompany the DCI to SCCs, PRCs, and so forth 
(much less occasionally substitute for him) if they are not actively 
engaged in preparing for such meetings? This is not to say that 
NIOs need do the initial drafting; merely that they should shape 
the product before it goes to the DCI. You may, of course, wish 
deliberately to give the impression that you are creating a giant 
Senior Review Board, but if you don't then here as elsewhere greater 
ambiguity is in order. 
7. I appreciate your idea of brining together a "critical mass," 
but if you are going to be able to do this you will have to make the 
new NIO setup attractive enough to bring in the kind of people who will 
make the system work. It is one thing to cut off a leg and a couple 
of fingers, it is another to engage in a public emasculation. A 
"critical mass" implies a chain reaction. What you don't want is 
another embarassing accident leaving in its wake the problem of having 
to dispose of all those gallons of radioactive water. We have had 
enough Three Mile Islands around here since 1973.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Richard. Lehman 
National Intelligence Officer for Warning 
FROM : I 
2 5X1ational Intelligence Officer for 
China-EAP 
SUBJECT Reform of the NIO System 
1. My major concern with respect to your study on reform of 
the NIO system is the relationship between the NIOs and NFAC, 
specifically on the score of the need for the NIO not only to be 
kept au courant regarding NFAC policy papers but assured the right 
to coordinate such papers. Otherwise, NIO's role as the DCI's 
advisor and surrogate on policy would be vitiated. Judging by 
your comments at the NIO meeting of 23 October, however, this point 
may already have been resolved. 
2. As a practical matter, I also question the advisibility 
of arbitarily limiting NIOs to one assistant. I believe I understand 
the purpose for this limitation: reducing the NIO "presence" among 
NFAC analysts and hence reducing the amount of irritation on the 
Office Director's part concerning utilization of his analytical 
strength. Also, I assume that you anticipate the need for NIO-NFAC 
interaction will be reduced as the NIC's own analytic and drafting 
capability increases. Nevertheless, this separate NIC capability 
does not now exist and is not likely to do so for quite some time; 
thus, realistically speaking, continued NIO-NFAC interaction cannot 
be avoided. Accordingly, in a large and varied area such as my own 
I would feel that the presence of two assistants is essential if 
the heavy, NIE workload is to be accomplished, not to mention maintenance 
of coordination on other projects. To argue ad hominem, there is enough 
going on in China and elsewhere in the East Asia-Pacific area to keep 
25X1 both thoroughly busy.

Monthly Warning Meeting, October 1979 
The following items are suggested for consideration: 
1. Mbrth Asia  
Korea. Analysts thought that last week's student 
demonstrations and the opposition's en masse resignation from 
the National Assembly the week before created the most difficult 
political problem set the Park government has faced in over 
five years. They noted, however, that the government's tough, 
decisive response to opposition challenges - the move to expel 
Kim Yong-sam from his post as opposition party leader as 
illustration - has worked well for Park in the past. They also 
shared the view that in several recent instances the government 
has used greater restraint in responding to provocations by 
the opposition than it did in the past. There was a consensus 
25X1 that the greatest danger to Park lies in the emergence of an 
attractive leader that the opposition could rally behind. Most 
To bring the 
26X1 situation back to normal, the government must neutralize Kim 
and persuade the opposition party members to rejoin the National 
25X1 Assembly. Of the two, the latter task appears the most 
25X1 manageable.

2. Southeast Asia. Analysts expressed concern that 
ASEAN's delicate consensus on security might be breaking down 
over Indochina. With the future of Pol Pot and his forces 
increasingly a question mark, the ASEAN states seem to be 
reaching separate conclusions on what to do next. At present, 
Singapore is leery of what it perceives as a drift by both 
Malaysia and Indonesia toward a political solution with the 
Vietnamese. Lee Kwan Yew would prefer a coalition in Kampuchea 
headed by Sihanouk.

25X1 FROM

Assistant National Intelligence 
Officer for China 
SUBJECT : Monthly Warning Assessment: China 
1. The Internal Situation  
Analysts focused primarily on the possibility that a new 
and relatively wide-ranging purge of officials accused of leftist 
tendencies may be impending. There was some divergence of views as 
to whether or not Deng Xiaoping (apparently the prime mover in this 
effort) had the political strength to carry through, but most 
analysts thought the odds on such a purge had definitely shortened. 
The issue the meeting addressed was whether a purge of this nature 
would lead to greater or lesser political instability in China in 
(a) the short run and (b) the longer run. A strong concensus 
developed that such a purge was useful perhaps even necessary if 
current policies were to be sustained over the longer run, but that 
the purge itself was likely to be a source of instability, fueling 
new resentments. A further consensus also emerged that the odds 
were good that tensions created by such a purge could and probably 
would be contained. One analyst made a strong case for unity among 
the leadership as the key factor in containing tensions; other 
suggested the main problem lay at middle levels of the party. It 
was generally concluded that a new purge would present some risk 
but not an acute one, to US policy interests. 
2: Sino-Soviet Affairs  
After taking the temperature on this issue, most analysts 
concluded that the thermometer remained about where it had been over 
the past several months. Most signs remained negative, and the odds

Approviror Release 2005/03/24: CIA-RDP83#100R000200200001-2 
against significant improvement of relations between the two parties 
were not good. Analysts noted that the preliminary sparring in 
Moscow before formal talks got underway suggested that each side 
was maneuvering for marginal, tactical advantage (with Vietnam in 
both parties' mind), and that suspicions were high on each side. 
It was also noted, however, that there had been signs of genuine 
Chinese interest in some movement off dead center last spring. The 
importance of Chinese domestic politics as a key variable in assessing 
the chances of movement in the Sino-Soviet relationship was generally 
acknowledged, and there was agreement that the indications that 
Deng Xiaoping had strengthened his position in recent weeks made even 
limited improvement in relations a good deal less likely. 
3. The Indochina Situation 
Analysts looked carefully once again at the indicators but 
reiterated the conclusion that a major renewal of last winter's 
fighting did not seem likely. There was agreement that the 
Vietnamese were decidely concerned over the possibility of a Chinese 
attack; strong evidence on the Chinese side, however, continued to 
be lacking. There was general agreement that (a) it would not take 
the Chinese as long to prepare for a second attack, but (b) we would 
nevertheless see the tell-tale signs if preparations were underway. 
These signs have not been visable. In the more nebulous area of 
Chinese rhetoric and private warning, there was a consensus that the 
decibel level had gone up -- briefly -- about two months ago, but 
had definitely dropped back again. A number of analysts thought the 
imminent destruction of the Pol Pot forces would trigger a Chinese 
attack; others noted that the Chinese could define at will what 
constituted the survivability of Pol Pot and that in any case an 
attack along the Sino-Vietnamese or Sino-Lao border would not in itself 
prevent the elimination of the Pol Pot forces if that were imminent. 
Most analysts agreed that any Chinese attack (short of a direct threat 
to Hanoi) would not accrue to Beijing the political gains that were 
achieved through that winter's attack, and could easily erode the 
gains already made. Several analysts noted that Beijing had been 
reenforcing its border defense units (as distinct from main force 
units) in response to the Vietnamese military buildup on the other 
side of the border, and pointed out that recent information suggested 
that these border units were better equipped and trained than had 
previously been supposed. There was general agreement that this 
information did not appreciably change the assessmention the likelihood 
of a Chinese attack, however.

SUBJECT 
Monthly Warning 
Meeting, October 1979 
The following items are suggested for consideration: 
1. -north Asia  
Korea. Analysts thought that last week's student 
demonstrations and the opposition's en masse resignation from 
the National Assembly the week before created the most difficult 
political problem set the Park government has faced in over 
five years. They noted, however, that the government's tough, 
decisive response to opposition challenges - the move to expel 
Kim Yong-sam from his post as opposition party leader as 
illustration - has worked well for Park in the past. They also 
shared the view that in several recent instances the government 
has used greater restraint in responding to provocations by 
the opposition than it did in the past. There was a consensus 
that the greatest danger to Park lies in the emergence of an 
attractive leader that the opposition could rally behind. Most

situation back to normal, the government must neutralize Kim 
and persuade the opposition party members to rejoin the National 
Assembly. Of  the two, the latter task appears the most

2. Southeast Asia. Analysts expressed concern that 
ASEAN's delicate consensus on security might be breaking down 
over Indochina. With the future of Pol Pot and his forces 
increasingly a question mark, the ASEAN states seem to be 
reaching separate conclusions on what to do next. At present, 
Singapore is leery of what it perceives as a drift by both 
Malaysia and Indonesia toward a political solution with the 
Vietnamese. Lee Kwan Yew would prefer a coalition in Kampuchea 
headed by Sihanouk.\

General concept: Assesses key political, economic, and 
military developments in the near term, 
with special emphasis on issues affecting 
US interests in South Korea. Addresses 
the prospects in South Korea for continued 
rapid economic growth, developments on 
human rights, continued political stability,

C. Proposed New Projects  
1. IIM: ASEAN's Durability as an Effective Regional Organization  
Estimated completion date: Third Quarter 1980  
General concept: Since its inception in 1967 ASEAN has 
grown in importance to its five member 
states, particularly since 1975, and has 
brought them into a closer economic and 
political relationship (and even an 
increased degree of informal military 
cooperation). However, strains in this 
relationship are becoming apparent as 
each nation reacts in its own individual 
way to the circumstances and implications 
of Vietnam's attack on Kampuchea. This 
study will assess the prospects for ASEAN 
as a durable regional organization within 
which the five member states will continue 
to coordinate on major aspects of foreign 
policy.

General concept: Countries in the Pacific Basin broadly 
defined share no history of regional 
consciousness. But over the past decade 
the market economies of North America and 
East Asia have linked together to show some 
of the characteristics of a regional 
economy. The paper sets out to: 1) examine 
the intensity, scope, direction and benefits 
of economic interaction among these 
countries; 2) analyze how political and 
military relationships - real and potential - 
both within the community and with major 
powers outside enhance or inhibit the 
economic linkages; and 3) assess the 
implications of these relationships and 
trends for the US and its posture in the 
region.

CHINA: GREAT EXPECTATIONS  
moo 9920 o co -2 
1. China's new realistic, moderate political and economic 
policies, which concentrate on rapid economic modernization 
seem well-established. 
Mao Zedong's highly disruptive utopian programs of the 
past 30 years, notably the "Great Leap Forward" and the 
Cultural Revolution, have been repudiated at the highest 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) levels. (See speech by 
Yeh Jianying, 2d ranking CCP leader, commemorating the 
30th anniversary of the PRC.) 
-- Steps already underway to implement internal measures 
providing for legal protection of individual rights, 
increased democracy, greatly expanded material incentives, 
and much more scope for initiative and independent judgment 
in management of affairs. Externally, China is turning to 
outside world, mainly the West and Japan, to provide critical 
technology and equipment for modernization. 
-- Center of gravity of the top CCP leadership appears united 
on China's present course of breaking with the past (even 
if this means at minimum implicit criticism of Mao) and 
concentrating efforts on successfully carrying out the "four 
modernications." Deng Xiaoping undoubtedly initiated this 
course, but CCP Chairman Hua Guofeng (a Mao hold-over) is 
going along.

Approved For Release 2005/03124: CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
2. As a result, Chinese people in general beginning to look 
ahead with sense of great expectation. 
Within upper CCP echelons there is high degree of confidence 
that China's new policies will pay off -- provided Western 
countries and Japan do their part in exporting to China 
the technology which it needs to modernize. 
Among the people, a sense of relief is apparent over 
scrapping of Maoism, combined with optimism about the future. 
This noticeable in increased individualism in dress, absence 
of tension in inter-personal relations, and willingness to 
challenge established authority, e.g., "democracy wall." 
The people obviously are hopeful about their prospects. 
3. Problems of course remain: 
-- Some senior CCP leaders are-probably unhappy over extent 
to which Mao Zedong's legacy is being cast aside, since 
Mao and CCP's revolutionary success have hitherto been 
considered inseparable -- to question one is to question the 
other. 
Intermediate-level cadres (leaders) are still not going along 
with the new approach, either out of fear of exposing them-
selves to possible reprisals if policy should somehow reverse, 
or because they fear they cannot measure up and will lose 
their positions.

China's still-depressed economy cannot provide good jobs 
for everyone, and there is considerable urban unemployment, 
especially among youth, with consequent discontent. 
Continued pulling and hauling between CCP leaders interested 
in public order and discipline, and individuals anxious for 
more democracy and human rights, can be expected. 
However, these problems can probably be handled, and China 
is a far happier, livelier country now than it has been 
for years.

Excerpt of Ye JianvinR. speech crttictztng the "Great Leap Forward" 
But amidst these immense victories we had become imprudent. In 1957 while it was neces-
sary to counter the attack of a handful of bourgeois rightists, the mistake was made of 
broadening the scope or the struggle. In 1953 we departed from the principles of carrying 
out thoroughgoing investigation and study and of testing all innovations before popu-
larizing them in the violation of objective laws in cur economic work. We nada the mis?
takes of giving arbitrary directions, being boastful and stirring up a "communist wind". 
In 1959, in inner-party struggle we ineptly carried out the struggle against so -called 
right opportunism. These "leftist" errors plus the three years of natural calamities 
and the scrapping of contracts and withdrawal of specialists by the Government of the 
Soviet Union brought. about the serious economic reverses of the late fifties and early 
sixties. The Central Committee of the party and Conrade?Mao Zedong quickly perceived 
these errors in our rural and. economic work and began to lead us in rectifying then. 
To this end, he put forward a series of guiding ideas such as the need to oppose, ? 
egalitarianism, stress commodity production, respect the law of value, strike an overa-
all balance, draw up the national economic plan with agriculture first, Light industry - 
second and heavy industry third, exert genuine and not sham efforts and go in for 
investigation and study in a big way. He also took charge of drawing up the "Oo Articles" 
for the work of the peoplefs communes. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
took decisive action to establish the correct guideline of "readjustment, consolidation, 
filling out and raising standards" for the national economy and laid down a succession 
of correct policies, rules and measures regarding work in other spheres. Early in 1962 
an enlarged central work conference attended by 7,000 people was convened, at which 
criticism and self-criticism was 'unfolded and both positive and negative experience was 
summed up.. Comrade Mao Zedong criticized himself in his speech at the conference and 
emphasized the necessity of perfecting the system of democratic centralism in the party 
and deepening our understanding of the laws of socialist construction. 
Excerpt of Te Hanying speech crtt.tqtzing_the Cultural Revolutiza_ 
In the tett years of the Cultural Revolution which began in 1966, cur country went 
through a fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The Cultural 
Revolution was launched with the aim of preventing and combating revisionism. "Par a 
proletarian party in power, it is. of course necessary to be constantly on guard a;ainst 
going down the revisionist road. characterized by oppression of the peonle at home and 
pursuit of hegemony abroad. But the point is that, at the time when the Cultural 
Revolution was launched, the estimate made of the situation within the party and the 
country ran counter to reality, no accurate definition Was given of revisionism, and an 
erroneous policy and method of struggle were adopted, deviating from the principle of 
-democratic centralism, Driven by counter-revolutionary motives, Lin Bisa, the gang 
of four and other conspirators and careerists exploited these errors, pushed things 
to the extreme and formulated and pursued an ultra-left line. They engaged in 
"overthrowing everything and launching an all-out civil war", usurping the party 
leadership and staging a coup to seize Dower. They attempted to uniermihe the 
foundation of our socialist system, subvert the dictatorship of the preletarit, 
destroy the leadership of the party, adulterate Narxism-Leninzsr.-!n: Tho?rt 
and plunge our country once again into the division and chaos abhorred 'ey the peotoe, 
into blood-baths and terror. The havoc which the counter-revolutionary rang wrought 
for ten long years spelt calamity for our people and constituted the .7_-,st severe 
reversal to our socialist cause since the founding of the People's Republic. Their 
conspiratorial activities were entirely different in nature from the e're=.s committed 
by our party. They were the most vicious enemies of the entire eesple, and it was 
impossible to settle their case through inner-party struggle.

Chinese Military Situation  
I. Modernization of China's armed forces will be realized only 
over the long term. 
-- China does not have the technical or economic resources 
to buy, utilize, or produce large numbers of advanced 
weapons. 
-- There will be incremental improvements as the Chinese 
improve their training and tactics and deploy small 
numbers of improved weapons to their forces. 
-- The Chinese continue to view the Soviets as their primary 
threat and any new weapons will be deployed first along 
the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Vietnamese borders. 
- China has placed its highest priority on obtaining 
antitank and air defense weapons? 
China's experience in Vietnam has helped focus the 
attention of military leaders on areas that will receive 
priority in the military modernization program.

China continues to maintain substantial forces

opposite Vietnam, the leadership 
now seems less inclined to initiate a "second lesson." 
-- Vietnam's 
forces opposite its border with China are much

be 
much heavier.

-- The Chinese profess to believe that the Pol Pot forces can 
continue their resistance against Vietnamese forces in 
Kampuchea, and Beijing is not presently linking a "second 
lesson" against Vietnam with the outcome of the resistance 
in Kampuchea. 
China retains the option of military action, however, and 
the possibility of a limited attack against one or two 
specific targets in Vietnam, an attack through Laos, or a 
full-scale invasion remains. This would be particularly 
true if Beijing concluded that all organized anti-Vietnamese 
resistance would otherwise collapse.

China's Foreign Trade in the-Pres.ent Era 
I believe that it is not only appropriate but imperative for 
this conference to begin with a survey of the economic and political 
climate in China for foreign trade. The questions we would hope to 
answer would be, first, are political and economic conditions in 
China such as to favor an expansion of China's foreign trade, and if 
so, are they likely to endure? Otherwise, this whole conference 
becomes simply an academic exercise. 
In response, let me say at the outset that a change of major 
proportions unquestionably is taking place in China and is bringing 
about a sweeping -- and, to those of us who have been watching 
developments in China for the past several decades -- a startlingly 
different approach to the whole cause of national development. 
According to Premier Hua Guofeng, in his report on the work of the 
government delivered at the 2nd Session of the 5th National Peoples 
Congress last June, 
...the State Council has since the beginning of 1979, 
shifted the work of the whole nation to socialist 
modernization. This is a historic turning point." 
In practical terms, what Hua Guofeng's words mean is that China's

to the goal of accomplishing the so-called "four modernizations," 
that is, the modernization of agriculture, industry, national 
defense, and science and technology. 
This is not to deny that modernization has been an objective 
of the PRC since its establishment on 1 October 1949, but for the 
greater part of the PRC's existence this objective has been 
accompanied -- and for many years actually eclipsed by -- efforts 
to achieve socio-political goals as the overriding priority. You may 
recall the slogans of "carrying the revolution through to the end" and 
"putting politics in command," which tended to occupy pride of place 
in Chinese philosophy and to outweigh or greatly color the economic 
aspects of national development. 
An extreme example of what, in my opinion, has been the basic 
contradiction in China between the economic goal of modernization and 
the political cause of "revolution," is the so-called "Great Leap 
Forward" of 1958-61. On the one hand, China was exhorted to catch up 
with the most developed countries of Western Europe (notably Britain) 
in "fifteen years of a little less" using such expediencies as 
backyard steel furnaces, deep plowing, and close planting; and on the 
other hand, to push boldly toward the "victory of socialism." In this 
latter respect, for a brief peiod in the early days of the Great Leap 
Forward emphasis was placed on the principle "from each according to 
his ability, to each according to his need," which in Marxist terms is

supposed to be applied only when the day of pure communism has 
arrived. This period also saw the massive establishment of 
People' Communes with dormitory-style living and communal mess halls, 
and the "five-fixed" principle of fixed payments for almost all 
human needs. The upshot of the contradiction between economic 
development and politics was a great internal upheaval in China, 
which when combined with bad weather and the withdrawal of all Soviet 
aid, resulted in near-famine conditions and a serious setback to 
China's development plans. Another similar upheaval, of course, 
took place during the Cultural Revolution, which is closer to us 
in time and hence more familiar. I doubt that any further elaboration 
is needed. 
There was yet another concept which figured somewhat later in 
China's internal policies: "zu li geng sheng," or national self-
reliance, which when carried to extremes (as, in fact, appeared to 
have occasionally happened) meant that China should forbid or severely 
limit the importation of foreign goods and technology for fear that 
such imports would weaken the political fiber of the nation. 
During the period that I was in Beijing a running battle was 
conducted in the cultural media between proponents of conflicting 
points of view on the "national self-reliance" issue, with those 
objecting to imports arguing that China could, and should, go it 
alone, and their opponents countering with the view that China 
should not be put in the position of trailing behind the developed 
countries of the West. The stronghold of "national self-reliance"

Approved For Release 2005/03/24 : CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
during these years appeared to be in Shanghai, as evidenced by 
articles in the Shanghai journal "Study and Criticism," and episodes 
such as the Shanghai-made motion picture "Bright Fiery Furnance" 
which criticized the importation of alloy steel for use by the 
PLA Navy on the grounds that equally-strong steel could be made in 
China. Those in Beijing responsible for orderly economic planning, 
who appeared to remain in the ascendency, countered by quoting the 
words of Mao Zedong: "yi gu wei xin yong; yi wai wei Zhong yong," 
or "use the old to serve the new; use the foreign to serve China." 
(I should add that "national self-reliance" is still with us, but in 
a greatly modified form which I will discuss later.) 
Now, however, the period of contradictory political and 
economic objectives appears to have passed. As indicated by the 
words of Hua Guofeng which I have already quoted, China's overriding 
goal is to carry out the four modernizations successfully, and all 
other goals are to be subordinated to it. As for the slogan of 
"putting politics in command," I noted with interest that one of the 
works recently published in Beijing attributed to the recently-
rehabilitated Zhang Wentian (now deceased), dealt with this slogan 
by saying that it was all right to put politics in command so long as 
politics was derived from economics! No one should doubt for one 
moment that politics remains a profound element in China's long-term 
development program (hence the "socialist" in"socialist modernization") 
but not in such a way as to get in the way of economics.

The new situation has brought with it additional important 
changes, affecting, in fact, the basic nature of the political 
course which China will pursue. Very significantly, class struggle 
on the nationwide, turbulent scale of the past years is to cease, 
although individual "class enemies" may still be attacked. Instead 
of stress on class struggle, the mephasis is now on unity among all 
classes and all elements of the population so that socialist 
modernization can be carried out. In consequence, older cadres 
attacked during the Cultural Revolution and "Gang of Four" eras 
have been rehabilitated and many people formerly categorized as 
class enemies have had their status changed. 
An additional major point is the attention now being directed 
toward democracy in China on the grounds that "without democracy, 
there can be no modernization." To be sure, China's democracy 
today is not to be compared with what is familiar to us in the 
outside world since it must be carried out within the "Four Upholds," 
or upholding socialism, leadership of the Party, democratic 
centralism, and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. But for the 
average Chinese, the new emphasis on democracy must represent a 
significant change from the days of even the recent past, and 
allows them much more latitude for political expression than ever before. 
Finally, the new situation is China has brought with it a 
restoration and strengthening of the rule of law. The Supreme Court, 
procuratorship, and system of Peoples Courts at all levels has been 
Approved For Release 2005/b3/24 : CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2

returned, and the Chinese people are now being told that no one is 
above the law, even those at the highest levels of Party and 
Government. Again, a dramatic change from the very recent past, 
in which laws to protect individual rights did not exist and people 
were brought to trial before administrative rather than judicial 
bodies. 
The second session of the 5th National Peoples Congress last 
June/July provided the occasion for dramatizing on a National 
scale the new developments in China and providing a legal basis 
for establishing and implementing the principles which I have 
discussed. But as in the case of all NPC sessions, the basic 
decisions had already been made. I consider that the watershed was 
the 3rd Plenum of the 11th CCP Congress which took place last 
December. In this session, besides settling on the establishment 
of socialist modernization as the primary goal and emphasizing 
demoncracy and the rule of law, there were additional crucial 
issues addressed which deserve our attention: 
-- The slogans of "emancipation of,thinking" and "seeking 
truth. fromfacts" were establi-shed as new ideological 
guidelines. These slogans, which are attributed to 
Deng Xiaoping and were also used by Hua Guofeng in his 
NPC work report, represent a determination to approach 
new situations in a realistic and flexible way. They 
tell the Chinese people not to be bound by past ideological 
positions even if these positions were set by Mao Zedong.

Approved For Release 2005/03/24 : CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
It is now acknowledged that even Mao could make mistakes, 
and also noted that Mao advocated adjusting policy to 
suit objective circumstances. 
-- Material incentives both for the rural peasants and for 
the urban workers were both acknowledged as necessary 
and greatly expanded. The communique of the plenary 
session pointed out that "it is imperative to improve the 
livelihood of the people in town and country step by step 
on the basis of the growth of production. The bureaucratic 
attitude of paying no attention at all to urgent problems 
in the people's livelihood must be resulutely opposed." 
Thus, in the rural areas, higher prices will be paid for 
produce, and private plots, sideline occupations, and 
rural free markets legitimized; in the cities a high 
percentage of the workers have received pay raises. 
-- A call was made for separation of the Party mechanism from 
the realms of economic management 'and the Government 
apparatus. Now, managers and government officials are to 
be much more free than heretofore to make decisions without 
the constraints of Party vetoes. The result is supposed to 
be greatly enhanced initiative and efficiency. Once more, 
the purpose is to support the goals of socialist 
modernization. An illustration of the new freedom is the 
authority granted to officials in Guangdong and Fujian provinces 
to engage in foreign trade relations without recourse to

Of course, I cannot speak for what is going on in the minds of 
the leaders in Beijing today. Nevertheless, I would like to venture 
this thought: 
Those of us who are familiar with the East Asian scene are 
very much aware of the qualities of imagination, initiative and energy 
which are to be found among the Chinese people in places such as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, and yes, Taiwan -- to name but a few. There is 
a real spark among these people, which can be seen by anyone who 
cares to wander around the major arteries and back streets almost at 
any time of the day and night, where economic and commercial activity 
is incessant. This same spark, though, has not been visible in 
China in recent years, even though it might still be burning below 
the surface. 
My personal recollections of China during the period of 1973 to 
1975 are of a relatively apathetic population, where farmers and workers 
with rare exceptions seemed to be doing just enough to get along --
with resultant adverse effects on production. In the big cities of 
Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and the like, the streets were virtually 
clear of people by eight or nine at night, unlike the bustling scenes 
in those cities outside China which I have mentioned. I am convinced 
that the leaders in Beijing today are aware of this contrast, and 
are trying to reignite the spark, or bring it out of hiding, by 
providing the Chinese people with the requisite degree of political, 
material, psychological and incentive needed to stimulate a great 
upsurge in economic activity and productivity.

Now, what do the changing circumstances in China, especially 
the emphasis on the "four modernizations," mean in terms of foreign 
trade? In this regard, let me again refer to the words of Hua Guofeng 
in his NPC work report, which are worth quoting in full: 
"(We should) continue to do a good job in importing technology, 
make active use of funds from abroad and strive to expand 
exports. Economic exchanges between countries and the import 
of technology are indispensable major means by which countries 
develop their economy and technology. It is all the more 
necessary for developing countries to import advanced technology 
in a planned way in order to catch up with those economically 
developed. In order to accelerate the four modernizations, 
while resolutely maintaining independence and self-reliance 
as our main premise, we must work hard to learn all that is 
worthwhile from foreign countries, selectively import advanced 
technology of which we are urgently in need, and not wall 
our country off from international exchanges. Both in the 
three-year period of economic readjustment and in subsequent 
years, we shall be taking energetic steps to develop foreign trade, 
expand economic co-operation and technical exchange with foreign 
countries and employ various appropriate means, current in 
international practice, to absorb funds from abroad."

Approved For Release 2005/03/24 : CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
There are several elements in Hua's statement which I would like 
to underscore: 
-- By imports, apart from needed foodgrains and primary 
products such as rubber and hardwood in which China is 
in short supply, Hua means essentially high-technology 
items. Everything which China can make itself China 
intends to make, and it will seek outside sources only 
for those high-technology goods which it can not 
currently produce itself. Obviously, the intention is 
to become self-reliant even in these areas as soon as 
possible. This is the new version of "national self-
reliance" which I mentioned above. 
In order to pay for imports, China must export. China 
will attempt to develop its own export industries, 
particularly in the field of light industry. In my 
judgment, it will probably establish the strongest 
import relationships with those countries which can best 
absorb China's exports. 
-- China will import only to the extent that it is able to 
pay for these imports, whether through direct payments, 
deferred payments, or draw-down on lines of credit. 
-- China will now, for the first time, accept some form of 
economic aid, so long as it does not consider that the 
aid terms might compromise its national independence.

Approved For Release 2005/03/24: CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
Quite clearly, the prospects are very good indeed for a growth 
on the order of several magnitudes in China's foreign trade relations. 
All I would add here is that the guidelines are very evident, and 
that those wishing to trade with China should bear them in mind. 
Perhaps those in this room might wish to consider the advantage to 
them of engaging in "compensation trade," which means furnishing the 
capital, equipment, and management to factories in China producing 
goods for exports and taking part of the product as compensation, 
or engaging in direct investment in China with some percentage of 
the equity held by the Chinese Government. As I understand it, 
the Chinese are strongly proposing arrangements along these lines, 
and laws are now being drawn up to provide for such activities. 
To show how impressively China's foreign trade has grown under 
the new conditions, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Qiang stated in a 
news interview in Beijing on 17 September that during the period 
January through August 1979, in terms of US dollars Chinese exports 
were up 39.8% and imports 66.3% over the corresponding period in 
1978. In real terms, making allowances for inflation, the increases 
would be 20% for China's exports and 35% for imports. The January-
August trade performance indicates that China will easily fulfill, and 
probably surpass its 1979 foreign trade targets. A conservative 
projection indicates that total trade turnover could reach US $29 billion 
with a trade deficit of US $1.5 billion. A more optimistic projection 
based on the January-August performance taken against the 1978 figures 
indicates that total trade could reach the level of US $34 billion with 
11

Approved For Release 2005/03/24 : CIA-RDP83600100R000200200001-2 
a deficit of US $4 billion. Given good planning and, I suppose, 
a little bit of luck, the expanding trend in Chinese trade should 
continue. China's ability to pay should also remain unimpaired, 
with the deficits funded through loans and credits. 
This leaves only the question of whether the current situation 
is likely to endure. There are undoubtedly many problems, and we have 
already seen some readjustments in China's economic projections 
between the latter part of 1978 and the first half of 1979 due to 
economic and political difficulties. China is now undergoing a 
three-year period of economic readjustment and consolidation, as 
indicated by Hua Guofeng, in which priorities have been reorganized, 
e.g., development of light industry has been put ahead of heavy 
industry. We have numerous reports of unhappiness on the part of 
elements within the population respecting their status and future 
prospects. Demonstrations and wall posters have become commonplace, 
pointing to various kinds of discontent. There are signs of pulling 
and hauling in the upper echelon of the Chinese Communist Party 
leadership, notably over the role in history to be accorded Mao 
Zedong. 
(Aspects of foreign policy may have been questioned as well, 
judging by the rather defensive tone to the statement in the NPC 
communique accepting Hua Guofeng's work report that "the session fully 
endorses the Governments line and policy in foreign affairs and its 
position and principles in handling China's relations with Vietnam, 
the United States, and the Soviet Union.") Some remnants of the 
"Gang of Four" are seemingly still in positions of authority.

Nevertheless, I personally remain quite optimistic about China's 
prospects. We might say that China's new ship of state, as created 
by the Third Plenum of the 11th CCP Congress and the second session 
of the Fifth NPC, is undergoing a shakedown cruise with many unforeseen 
problems inevitably arising. But I submit that a reversion to the old 
system would be difficult indeed -- after all, this system was in 
effect for many years and did not bring anywhere near the desired 
results. Everyone in China from the top leadership on down knows 
this. In fact, China today admittedly finds itself in many major 
respects essentially where it was in 1957, the year before the Great 
Leap Forward. While modifications in the new policy may ensue, and 
China may blow hot or cold in various aspects of its foreign economic 
and political relationships, there are relatively few options for it 
to follow outside its present course and still retain its determination 
to modernize while preserving its national identity and independence. 
The one major problem which I would like to outline as a parting 
thought concerns the responsiveness of the rank-and-file Party 
membership to responsibilities assigned to it. The Party cadres must 
now demonstrate much greater capacities for leadership, initiative, 
and managerial and technological skill than ever before, but the 
evidence suggests many are reluctant to assume these responsibilities. 
Some are afraid that the political pendulum will again swing the other 
way, leaving them exposed if they do what they are now told to do. 
There are many others who entered the Party primarily on the basis of 
13

their political stand (over half the Party membership dates from 
1966 or later) and feel that their jobs are now threatened; they 
are therefore dragging their feet when it comes to implementing 
reforms. A saying which I have heard is making the rounds in China 
goes: "The two ends hot, the middle cold." This means that the top 
leadership at the one extreme and the people at the other are 
enthusiastic about the new situation, but that the cadres in the 
middle are not. The particular problem of cadre responsiveness must 
be solved if China is to move ahead as vigorously as its leaders 
clearly wish.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Assistant NIO/China and EAP 
SUBJECT : Dam Sites on the Hongshui He 
1. The two dam sites -- the Dateng Gorge Project and the 
Tiansheng Bridge/Dam Site -- mentioned on October 19 by Jia Ke, 
Director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Electric 
Power, as suitable for visit by separate teams of a high-level 
U.S. hydropower delegation have probably not been previously 
discussed openly by the Chinese. We cannot pinpoint the location 
of the dam sites, though there is sufficient information to 
indicate the general location of them. 
2. The new Dateng Gorge Project is probably planned for 
the Dateng Xia on the Qian Jiang in east-central Kwangsi. Qian 
Jiang is one of the alternate regional names applied to the main 
channel of the Hongshui. The Dateng Xia stretches along about 
40 kilometers of the Qian Jiang just upstream from Guiping. The 
river makes about eight bends through this gorge and some of 
these could be suitable for the construction of a dam. The Dateng 
Xia is reasonably accessible to a visiting group. Guiping is 
served by a good road and an airfield. The upstream end of the 
gorge can be reached via a road from the main railroad or from 
Liuzhou, a principal transportation center about 100 kilometers 
to the north. 
3. The second dam site, the Tiansheng Bridge/Dam Site in 
Guizhou, cannot be located precisely. It is probably located 
where the Hongshui serves as the border between Guizhou and 
Guangxi upstream from Tianle (25?00'N 107?101E). The river 
here flows for almost 100 kilometers in a deep gorge along a 
relatively straight course and probably has numerous potential 
dam sites. Other dam sites exist upstream from the fork of the 
Nanpan Jiang and Beipan Jiang branches of the Horshui

4. Two hydro projects have previously been mentioned by the 
Chinese on the Hongshui in the border region of the provinces. 
The Longtai Project in Guangxi is a 200-meter-high dam about 
16 kilometers upstream from Tianle with a power potential of 
3,000 MW. The Chinese claim that this project could provide 
power for the development and processing of nearby bauxite 
deposits. The Longtai Project has always been identified by the 
Chinese as being in Guangxi, although it is very close to the 
Guizhou border. Less is known about the second dam, the Qiancheng, 
except that it is projected for the upstream Hongshui. Work on the 
55-meter-high 464-meter-long dam is expected to start in late 1979. 
It is conceivable that the Tiansheng Bridge/Dam reference applies 
to the Qiancheng site. Access to the Tiansheng site, which has to 
be in southern Guizhou, will be more difficult than to the Dateng 
Gorge Project. Travel to the dam site will probably be via a 
sparse network of roads into a relatively remote section of Guizhou.

Hydroelectric Power on The Hongshui River  
The Chinese are apparently planning to tap substantial 
amounts of the hydroelectric potential of the Hongshui River. 
According to the Chinese the Hongshui River has 8600 megawatts 
(MW) of hydro potential in Guangxi Chuang Autonomous Region 
alone. At least three large hydroelectric projects are 
currently planned for the Hongshui, two in Guangxi and one 
in bordering Guizhou. 
The two hydroelectric facilities planned for Guanvci 
Chuang Autonomous Region include Dahua located between Du'an 
and Mashan counties, and Longtan near Guangxi's northern 
border with Guizhou Province. Dahua, the first large-scale 
effort to tap the Hongshui's hydro potential, is reportedly 
a multipurpose project intended to facilitate water transport 
as well as provide 400 MW of power. The Chinese report that 
Dahua should begin initial power generation in 1980. The much 
larger Longtan project of 3,000 MW is still on the drawing 
boards and is one of the 8 major development projects for which 
China has sought $5.5 billion in financing from Japan. The 
800 MW Qianching hydroelectric facility is planned for the upper 
reaches of the Hongshui River in Guizhou Province. Work is 
scheduled to start on the project later this year. Table 1 
summarizes these three planned projects.

We are unable to fully verify the two hydroelectric sites 
included in the US hydroelectric delegation's itinerary. The 
Dateng Gorge project listed in the itinerary appears to be a 
wholly different location from the sites of the two hydro-
electric projects already confirmed by the Chinese along the 
Hongshui River in Guangxi. According to our gazetteer, The 
Dateng Gorge appears to be on the Qian Jiang River at least 
60 kilometers downstream from the confluence of the Hongshui 
and Liu Jiang Rivers. Given its probable location the Dateng 
gorge project is clearly distinct from the other two Hongshui 
River projects in Guangxi. The Tiansheng Bridge Dam site 
listed in the US itinerary may correspond to the 800 MW Qianching 
STAT hydroelectric facility.
