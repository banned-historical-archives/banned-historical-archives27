				     	[Text)    	Foreword
				    	"Dissatiafaction  on  the  part  of  both  partiea  makea  for  good  negotiatione."
				    	So  goea  an  often  quoted  comment  among  diplomata  concerning  diplametic  nego-
				    	tiations.    	The  alluaion  describes  the  theme  that  independent  nationa  in-
				    	volved  in  a  negotiation  mu~ually  recognize  that  impoesibility  of  bending
				    	the  other  party  to  its  own  will.
				    	Over  the  past  6  years,   	the  concluaion  of  a  Japan-China  peace  and  friend-
				    	ship  treaty  has  been  a  ma~or  item  on  the  agenda  of  Japan's  foreign  rela-
				    	tians  and  hae  proved  to  be  a  real  problem  child.    	NoFr  that  it  has  been
	   	-			  	eigned,   	Foreign  Minister  Sunao  Soaoda  and  the  executive  office  etgff  of
				    	the  Foreign  Miniatry  are  praising  themeelves  that  the  conduct  of  "the
				    	event  was  worthy  of  almoat  perfect  marke."    	If  that  is  so,   	then  according
				    	to  the  wiadom  of  foreign  relationa  officera  quoted  above,  one  has  to  suit-
	   	~			  	pect  that  the  Japan-China  treaty  negotiation  could  not  have  been  one  fa~~or-
				    	able  to  Japan.
				    	In  reopening  the  negotiations,  Prime  Minister  Fuke:da  made  the  concluaion
				    	of  the  treaty  "provisional  to  conditiona  satiafactorq  to  both  parties."
				    	In  reviewing  the  long  drawn  out  negotiations  between  Japan  and  China,
				    	Japan's  diplomacy  cannot  be  said  to  have  really  earned  the  jubilant  cries		   	_
				    	of  "Oh,  well  done!    	Well  done!"    	Aa  a  matter  of  fact,  we  can't  aee  any			  			 	regime.    	Hie  attempt  to  salvage  something  out  of  that  debacle  by  fishing
	   	-			   	for  a  normalization  of  relations  between  Japan  and  China  had  fallen  on
						deaf  eara.    	As  salt  ground  into  his  wounds,  he  was  beaten  in  his  bid  to
					 	seize  political  power  as  Sato's  $uccessor  by  the  forces  of  Tanaka,  Ohira		    	-
					 	and  Miki  who  had  become  united  over  the  Japan-China  issue.    	When  one
					 	realizes  how  China  had  ~inxed  him,   	one  can  see  why  there  were  points  of
						differences  between  him  and  Sonoda  who  was  solely  motivated  by  concluding
	   	=			   	a  Japan-China  treaty.

					Officials  in  the  Foreign  Miniatry  felt  secure  wiCh  Fukuda  because  his
					track  recurd  showed  him  to  be  one  who  did  not  force  iaeues.    	But  ae  the
					prlmc,  minieCer  put  more  dietence  betwarn  himeelf  and  Sonoda  and  di.eplayed
					an  inclination  Co  take  thinge  into  his  own  hands,   	they  t,ecame  uneaey  over
					the  posaibili~ty  that  he  would  d~op  hia  support  of  their  proposals  and
	   	-		  	procedural  plana.    	It  may  be  a  little  unfair  to  blame  the  lack  oP  unity
					of  purpoae  on  the  aelf-aerving  nature  of  the  Foreign  Ministry  officials
					but  they,   	caught  beCween  the  cautious  Fukuda  and  the  eager  Sonoda,  had
					to  conducC  their  business  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  and  be  completely  dependent			     	'
					on  the  whims  of  the  time.    	This  etructure  which  lacked  a  basic  principle
					from  which  to  act  but  which  reacted  to  whatever  event  occurred  wae  the
					structure  in  effect  until  shortly  before  the  treaty  was  concluded.
					"If  I  pull,  he  will  follow  behind  but  he  will  not  take  th~   	initiative  and
	    	"		  	lead  the  way...."    	Sonods  vei~_,;  this  criticism  frequently  to  his  foreign			   	-
	    	'		  	service  officials  always  hinting  that  Sato  in  the  field  was  the  aub~ect
	    	�		  	of  hia  ~ ibe.
					The  first  of  the  discusaions  between  Sato  and  Han  Nianlong  were  held  on
	    	-		  	24  February.    	The  crux  of  thia  session  was  Co  determine  whether  Japan
					could  be  kept  from  being  drawn  into  an  anti-USSR  proviaion  of  "a  unified
					front  againat  the  USSR,"  even  by  conceding  to  "mnti-hegemony"  clauaes.					~
					No  progreas  was  made  and  Sonoda  displayed  some  dissatisfaction  with  ~ato's		     	I
	    	~		  	"indecisive  petletration."
					On  4  March  while  the  National  People's  Representative  Convention  was  in					=
					progress,   	the  second  Sato-Han  discussions  took  place.    	No  meaningful				     	-
					progress  was  made  at  this  session  either.    	Sato  who  felt  that  the  prime
					minister's  residence  and  the  foreign  office  were  somewhat  out  of  step
					with  each  other,   	turned  the  baton  over  to  headquarters,   	saying  "Ammunition			  	-
					at  hand  hae  been  exhausted;   	it  ia  now  up  ~o  Tokyo."										_
	    	.		  	This  snapped  Sonoda's  tolerance.    	He  showed  his  irritation  not  only  at
					Fukuda  but  at  his  rival  Chief  Cabinet  Secretary  Shintaro  Abe  and  his  cohort
	   	_		  	Yoshiro  Mori  and  others  connected  with  the  official  reaidence  for  their
					viewing  the  Japan-China  event  too  relaxedly.    	Referring  to  the  progress  nf
					the  Peking  discussions,   	Sonoda  chided:    	"So  brother  Sato's  a  big  shot?"

		,			   	It  is  reported  that  Sonoda  has  brought  life  and  action  to  the  service  and
				   	has  even  given  a  lift  to  the  slumping  art  of  diplom$cy.
				   	The  image  of  the  foreign  minister  since  the  time  of  Iichiro  8atoyama  Who
				   	was  nicknamed  "the  Accountant"  has  not  bcen  a  proud  one,  having  been  those

				   	the  Foreign  Minietry  or  bureaucratic  politicians.    	Thnse  aho  didn't  have

				   	krowing  where  Sonoda  was  going  or  how  he  intended  to  get  there  seemed  to

				   	Did  the  Foxeign  Ministry  really  Want  to  conclude  a  Japan-China  peace  and

				    	porting  on  the  Japan-China  treaty  to  Fukuda  at  the  official  residence~
				    	Arita  was  aeked~   	"Incidentally~  ahat's  Takashima's  ~udgment  on  this?"
				    	Sonoda  was  well  aWare  of  fihe  high  pointa  given  Takashima  in  the  party
				    	and  in  early  epring,   	even  before  the  foreign  minieter's  China  visit  had
				    	been  acheduled,  publicly  announced  that~   	"~1hen  I  go  to  Peking  I'm  taking
				    	Takashima  with  me."
				    	In  the  conduct  of  diplomatic  relationa  With  China,  Takashima  strongly
				    	advocated  that  a  bold  protest  be  made  againet  China's  habit  of  ignoring
				    	normal  diplomatic  channels  and  resorting  to  actions  and  words  aimed  at
				    	Japaa's  internal  affa~ra.    	He  inaiated  that  euch  a  step  be  takea  to  force
				    	some  rethinking  on  the  part  of  China  but  the  vice  minister  designete  was
				    	at  that  time  in  between  floors  With  respect  to  responsibility  over  polit-
				    	ical  matterg  so  we  don't  kao~r  whether  thp  advice  bore  any  fruit  or  not.
				    	VieWing  the  negotiations  in  isolation,  we  suapect  that  Takashima's  aima
				    	aere  only  half  fulfilled.    	He  is  a  man  who  wae  graduated  from  Tokyo  Uni-
				    	versity  end  was  detained  by  the  USSR  for  2  yeara  after  the  War  ended.
				    	Aaia  Bureau  Chief  Yosuke  Nakae~  unlike  Arita  and  Takashima  aho  Were  of
				    	the  faction  Which  entered  the  ministry  during  the  war,   	did  not  come  into
				    	it  until  after  the  War.    	He  is  a  Kyoto  Univeraity  graduate  and  Within  the
				    	ministry  wae  active  in  the  theater.    	Even  noa,  he  is  an  intellectual  Who

				 	(Social  Democratic  League]  announced  on  the  lSth  that  the  incident  wae

	    	~		   	ehip  treaCy  negotiationa.    	On  the  issue  of  reopening  negotiations,  he  took
				 	the  oppoxtunity  to  etate:    	"We  are  not  making  any  new  conditions  gnd  the
				 	anti-hegemony  provieion  ie  not  pointed  at  sny  apecific  entity."    	Since				 	-
	    	_		   	reopening  the  negotiaCione  with  Satn  and  Han  as  the  central  figures  was
				 	imminent,   	the  starement  wae  undoubtedly  made  to  give  aseurance  ChaC  the

					USSR,  ae  a~n  inducement  to  Japan  which  had  been  expreaeing  conaiderable
				 	concern  over  that  iseue.
	   	_		   	While  China  wae  uaing  euch  meane  to  accelerate  the  proceedingsr  Japaneae
				 	opinion  was  etill  divided.    	Sonoda~  of  course,  was  ruahing  xround  trying
				 	to  get  the  negotiaCiona  geing  while  Arita,  Takashima,  Nakae  and  othera  in
	   	_		   	the  Foreign  Miniatry  inaieted  on  a  calmer  approach.    	'~Since  there  can't
				 	be  an  easy  eettlement  of  the  territory  isaue~"  they  argued,  "it  would  be
				 	wiser  not  to  get  ahead  of  ouraelves  by  charging  into  the  reopening  of
				 	negotiationa  thinga."    	Therefore~  when  on  21  April  Deputy  Chief  of  the
				 	Aaia  Bureau  Wan  Xiaoyun  told  Minieter   	(at  the  time)  Donowaki  in  Peking				 	-
				 	that,   	"The  incident  was  unintended  and  will  be  treated  when  discussing
				 	the  broad  question  of  Japan-China  relationa,"  the  opportunity  was  seized
				 	to  attempt  to  make  a"diplomatic  eettlement"  of  the  incident.
				 	But  Fukuda  and  Abe  reeisted  ringing  do~n  the  curtain  too  ~.;ecipitously.
				 	In  an  atmoaphere  where  the  domeatic  reaction  Was  bound  to  be:    	"That  would
				 	be  a  real  hegemony  principle  actionl"  Fukuda  could  not  be  blamed  for  being
				 	reluctant  to  aettle  the  matter  on  the  diplomatic  fiction  that  the  incident
				 	was  an  "accidental  occurrence,"  without  going  through  normal  diplomatic
	    	'		   	procedurea.    	~inally,  a  temporary  aettlement  was  reached  on  10  May,  after
				 	the  Japan-U.S.   	aummit~  betweea  Sgto  and  Han  who  agreed  to  reaffirm  the

					Fukuda  to  make  the  decieion?    	Fukuda  had  been  saying  that  the  Japan-U.S.			     	-

				 	could  be  that  having  under~aken  the  Japan-U.S.   	3tem  eucceasfully,  he  was
				 	enconraged  to  take  on  this  pro~ect.    	Coincidentally,   	the  opening  of  Narita
				 	airport  fell  on  the  same  day  ae  the  inaugural  ceremonies  for  Taiwan's  new				~
				 	president  Chiang  Ching-kuo.    	In  Mar~r.,   	Chiang  had  been  elecCed  preaidenC;			 	i

				 	the  ceremonial  events  in  Taiwan  have  been  carried  out."    	That  may  t!ave  had
				 	something  to  do  with  the  timing,   	too.													I
				 	In  retrospect,   	the  whole  pro~edure  could  be  termed  as  being  typ:cally					(

				 	iatry  ha~l  not  been  aware  of  hia  real  intent.
	     	_		  	There  were  some  foreign  aervice  officers  like  Yoauke  Nakae  who  weren't
				 	taken  by  surpriae:    	"From  the  time  he  asaumed  the  post  of  prime  miniater,"
			    	�,he  said,   	"Mr  Fukuda  had  hie  mind  made  up  to  conclude  the  treaty.    	The  only
			'		 	f~old-up  had  been  to  prepare  the  domestic  political  atmoephere  so  that  the
				 	event  could  take  place  in  an  orderly  manner.    	There  wasn't  much  point  in
				 	~iaking  turmoil  by  ru8hing  into  it."    	That  may  be  ao  but  a  prime  minister
				 	who  is  the  final  suthority  in  decisiona  involving  foreign  countriea,  can-
				 	not  be  excuaed  for  failiag  to  divulge  his  predetermined  intent  to  at  least

	   	_			  	Then  there  wae  the  matter  of  erroneously  eatimating  Han  Nianlong,   	Sonoda's

						been  viewing  him  ae  merely  a  protocol  officer;   	the  Chineae  counterpart,				_
						thought   	tha  Foreign  Ministry,  had  to  be  one  who  could  discuss  matters  at
						a  high  polltical  level  or  no  important  iseues  could  be  aettled.    	Kasumi-
						gaeeki's  eatimate  of  Han  Nianlong  was  that  he  was  an  inflexible  and  tough
						foreign  aervice  officer."
						Vice  Miniater  Han's  illness  forced  a  change  in  the  scheduling  giving  some
						of  Japan's  more  capable  foreign  service  officera  to  ad~uet  their  estimate
						of  him.    	A  review  of  hia  role  in  isaues  pertaining  to  Japan  made  it  clear
	    	_			   	that  he  was  indeed  a  very  competent  foreign  aervice  officer.    	With  thie
						revised  estimate,   	it  was  decided  that   	the  administrative  level  diecussiona		 	_
						be  expedited  by  curtailing  them  to  one  or  two  meetinga  and  to  schedule
						the  foreign  minieter's  viait  to  China  for  about  the  26th  or  27th.    	A  Japan		 	_
						Airlines  plane  was  quietly  chartered  to  carry  out  this  program.
						But  when  confronted  with  reality,   	the  scenario  had  to  be  completely  re-
						written.    	Around  1974  when  the  initial  steps  in  the  Japan-China  peace  and
						friendship  treaty  were  taken  by  Vice  Minister  Tngo  and  Chineae  Ambassador
						Chin,  Han's  name  was  tied  in  with  the  other  two  and  the  proceedings  were
						derisively  dubbed  the  "Ton  (Togo)-Chin  (Ambasasdor  Chin)-Kan  (Han)  Nego-
						tiations."    	[Pun  refers  to  a  state  confusion]    	Han  now  made  no  secret  of
						the  fact  that  he  himself  wanted  to  complete  the  treaty.    	As  an  opening
	   	,			   	gambit,  he  bluntly  tabled  China's  basic  position  on  "anti-hegemony"  and
						"third  party."
						Japan's  position  had  been,  "Firet,   	the  problem  iseuea  have  to  be  put  in
						order,"  and  with  regard  to  the  hegemony  problem,   	"if  we  carelesaly  get
						drawn  into  this  iasue  too  deeply,  we  will  find  ourselves  on  a  submerged
						reef  even  before  the  foreign  minister  arrives."
						Since  Han  had  to  commute  to  the  neetings  from  his  hoepital  bed!   	they  were
						uaually  convened  at  3:00  or  3:30  pm  (China  time)  and  each  meeting  with  a
					 	long  rest  period  included,  laeted  only  at  moet  2  hours  or  so.    	The  atmo-

					 	entiCies.    	In  thie  aepecC  at  leasC~   	it  differe  from  the  ugual  mi.litary
					 	entity."
					 	We  do  not  intend  here  to  rehaeh  the  rather  pointlesa  argumente  as  to
						wheCher  the  aelf  defenee  force  is  a  military  entity  or  not.    	According			 	-
					 	Co  the  government's  definition,   	the  self  defenae  force  ie  an  extraordinary
					 	military  entity.    	But  in  the  general  sense,   	it  could  be  viewed  as  a  mili-
	   	-			   	tary  force.    	If  it  is  an  extraordinary  m1liCary  entity  it  is  noC  becauae
					 	iC  doesn't  have  court  marCial  righta;  we  would  agree  to  ita  being  an  un-
					 	usual  military  force  if  it  were  to  be  defined  ae  being  a  salaryman  army.
					 	The  ~oyride  flighC  taken  by  the  maritime  eelf  defenae  force  plane  during
					 	the  nighC  of  7  September  illuatraCea  the  "salarymen  force"  aspect.    	On  an		  	-
					 	impulse,   	the  27  year  ~ld  lst  lieutenant  who  was  at  the  controls  decided
					 	to  take  a  look  at  Tokyo.    	No  doubt  t'ne  beauty  of  Tokyo's  night  lights  and,
	   	_			   	being  a  baseball  fan,   	aeeing  the  ba'ilparka  from  the  air  thrilled  him  and
					 	the  two  other  crew  membera.    	We  can  well  understand  his  feelings--some-
	    	~			    	thing  like  the  salaryman  who  takea  a  break  to  go  to  the  moviea  or  to  a
					 	sporta  arena.    	But  we  can't  have  the  self  defense  force  emulating  a  eimple
					 	salaried  clerk.    	Why?    	Because  in  this  specific  incident,  the  flight  was
					 	being  made  without  running  lighta  with  the  inherent  danger  of  craehing
					 	and  because  it  was  done  in  clear  violation  of  training  orders.    	In  the
					 	old  days,   	the  aircraft  commander  would  undoubtedly  have  been  aub~ected  to
					 	a  trial  by  a  military  court.    	In  this  incident,  however,  he  was  arreated
					 	for  violating  the  lawa  of  air  navigation;  within  the  unit  to  which  he  was
					 	attached,  he  wae  suspended  from  his  duties  for  35  days  and  the  commander
	   	-			    	and  othera  in  responsible  positions  were  either  reprimanded  or  received
					 	werninga.    	The  penalties  meted  out  were  fairly  aevere  for  theae  days.
				 	.	 	There  was  an  earlier  incident:    	A  pilct  while  on  a  training  flight  sud-
					 	denly  felt  an  urge  to  make  a  flying  visit  to  his  home  tawn  and  ended  up
					 	crashing.    	Although  such  incidents  which  occasionally  occur  do  not  really
					 	earn  the  aelf  defense  force  the  label  of  "salarymen  force"  in  themselvea,
					 	they  do  contribute  to  it.    	The  self  defense  force  diffeze  from  the  mili-		   	_
					 	tary  of  old  in  both  nature  and  acope;   	it  makes  no  incursions  into  politics
					 	and  is  a  force  which  exists  for  the  sole  purpose  of  being  prepared  for  a
					 	hoatile  invasion.
					 	In  about  1964,   	the  then  chiAf  of  the  defense  agency  ordered  that  all  self
					 	defense  force  peraonne;l  be  in  uriiform  when  commuting  to  or  from  his  duty
					 	etation.    	All  those  in  the  etaff  office  who  were  diviaion  chiefs  or  above
					 	Were  provided  limousine  traneportation  to  co~ute  and  they  were  in  uniform.

			     	"To  maintain  the  pride  oa:  being  a  aelf  defenae  officer  even  while  commut-

					gradually  reaumed  wearing  ciwies  until  today  almost  all  have  gon~2  back
					to  wearing  regular  sCreet  clothes.
			     	When  queried,   	a  self  defenae  man  replied:    	"In  the  rain,   	if  we  are  in
					uniform,  we  can  only  wear  a  raincoat  and  may  not  t~se  an  umbrella.    	People
					around  us  don't  like  it  when  we  get  on  a  crowded  public  transportation
					vehicle  all  wet."    	We  get  the  impreasion  that  the  arrogance  diaplayed  by
					the  old  military  men  on  etreet  cars  ia  missing  snd  we  must  admit  that  we
	   	.		   	favor  the  restraints  ahown  by  the  current  defense  people.    	In  West  Germany,
					the  slogan  for  military  peraonnel  ie  "civiliana   	in  uniform"  with  Che  impli-
					cation  that  they  are  civili~ne  before  they  don  their  uniforms  and  Chat  they
					have  the  basic  rights  of  freedom  to  meet,   	to  form  groups,   	and  of  speech
					that  all  citizens  have  even  while  serving  in  the  military.    	We  would  like
					to  have  thia  principle  of  their  being  a  citizen  first  applled  Co  the  mem-
					bers  of  our  self  defense  force  too.
					The  pay  acale  for  Self  Defense  Force   	[SDF]  officers  is  a  level  ab~~~a  the
					pay  for  general  government  employees  for  the  reason  that  danger  is  in-				 	_
					herent  to  the  occupation.    	General  grade  officere  are  paid  354,000  to
					188,000  yen  a  month;   	field  grade  from  258,000  to  361,000;  and  the  classi-
					cal  "flowera"  or  company  grade  from  135,000  to  271,000.    	The  bureau  chiefs
					in  the  bureaucracy  receives  from  276,000  to  420,000  per  month  so  though
					his  treatment  and  privileges  equate  to  those  of   	the  general  grade  officer,			 	-
					his  actual  pay  equates  to  the  general  officer  candidate  grade.    	From  this
					it  can  be  seen  that  the  uniform  ia  given  some  favorable  considerations.
					The  director  general  of  the  Defense  Agency  hae   	traditionally  ordered  that,
					"The  SDF  will  be  etrong  in  spirit"  but  Director  General  Kanemaru  went  a
					step  further  and  directed,   	"Be  an  SDF  that  instills  fear."    	It  is  not  clear
					what  an  SDF  which  ia  feared  describes  but  it  is  a  fact  that  the  SDF--
					generally  labeled  "the  salaryman  force"--has  not  even  r~aached  the  point
					of  being  combat  ready.    	Some  years  ago,  a  seagoing  tanker  named  thP  Yuyo
					Maru  went  aground  and  it  was  decided  that  it  woul.d  be  towed  out  to  sea  and
					sunk  by  torpedoes.    	Then  it  was  found  that  no  direct  line  torpedoes  were
					available  at  Yokosuka  and  the  target  practice  had  to  be  postponed  until			   	I
					the  appropriate  weapone  were  delivered  to  the  scene  all  the  way  from  Kure!				_
					A  similar  situation  ex~.sts  with  the  Air  SDF's  sir-to-air  missiles.    	There
	   	-		   	may  be  some  merit  to  the  explanation  that,   	"Those  situations  exist  only
					becauae  it  is  peacetime;   	should  an  incident  occur,  we  will  asswne  an  imme-
					diate  reaction  posture."    	But  the  point  of  the  isaue  is  not  in  facilities
	   	-		    	and  hardware  but  in  the  training  and  spirit  of  readiness  in  normal  times.

				 	not  completely  underetood  even  in  ite  home  grounde~   	the  U.~.    	In  1949  a
				 	big  reorganization  of  Che  national  defenae  eetabliehment  wag  u,~:,,~~~~taken.
				 	At  that  Cime  Ferdinand  Eberetaadt  who  participated  in  a  manager:al  capa-
				 	city  in  the  national  defense  committee  of  the  Hoover  Commisaion~   	said  in
				 	a  speech  at  the  Naval  Academy  aC  a  later  date~   	"Civilian  control  is  a  eort
				 	of  a  mythical  expreaeion....    	Nobody  knows  What  it  means."    	It  is  ironic
				 	that  he  who  had  made  the  greateet  effort  in  eetabliahing  civilian  control
				 	throughout  all  of  the  military  etructure  and  was  the  one  pereon  more  than
				 	any  other  who  ehould  have  known  the  definition  of  civilian  control,  was

				 	its  meaning  eluded  those  who  were  involved  at  the  time  the  SDF  was  founded.
				 	We  cannot  say  that  even  today  ita  meaning  is  fully  underatood  in  Japan.
				 	Although  the  expreseion~   	civilian  control,   	ia  toesed  around  freely  as  if
				 	everybody  knew  what  it  meant,  it  is  yet  to  be  firmly  defined.    	In  a  paper

				 	at  West  Point  in  the  U.S.,   	iC  was  etated  that,  "all  people  boW  their  head~

			     	in  office  is  too  ehort  for  him  to  fully  grasp  the  concept.    	We  believe
			     	that  this  point  is  Well  taken.
			     	Counting  from  Keikichi  Maeuhara  (who  vas  then  given  the  title  of  Chief
			     	of  the  Police  Reserve  Force)   	in  1950  when  the  preaent  SDF  wa8  founded,
			     	the  curr~nt  incumbent,   	Shin  Kanemaru~   	ie  the  34th  director  general.    	In
			     	other  words,   	there  have  been  34  chiefa  in  28  yeare~  making  the  average
			     	time  in  office  of  ~bout  9  and  a  half  months.    	This  is  an  astounding  figure.
																									   	r
			     	When  a  new  man  takea  office,   	the  vice  miniaters  and  various  bureau  chiefe
			     	brief  him  on  their  respective  duties.    	Of  course,   	this  is  normal  procedure
			     	in  not  only  the  Defense  Agency  but  in  all  governmental  ministries  and
			     	agenciea.    	But  these  briefinge  preempt  the  entire  day  for  about  a  moath.
			     	Even  then~   	there  ie  no  Way  that  all  he  ehould  know  about  the  agency  can
			     	be  crammed  into  the  newcomere  head  in  that  period  of  time,   	particularly
			     	if  he  hae  had  no  experience  or  knowledge  of  matters  pertaining  to  the
			     	Defenee  Agency.    	With  this  in  mind~   	the  briefers  try  to  give  him  a  broad
			     	brush  picture  at  firat  and  get  into  more  details  at  a  later  date.    	The
			     	briefing  elemente  are  apt  to  consume  conaiderable  time  since  they  are
			     	anxious  to  give  as  much  information  about  their  functiona  as  poasible.
			     	Specialized  language  or  ~argon  is  inherent  in  mattera  pertaSning  to  the

				 	the  managerial  personnel.    	The  executive  clasa  people  are  shot,m  reepect
				 	becauae  they  are  asaigned  considerable  responeibilitiee  and  authorities.
				 	Upon  graduating  from  college,   	they  had  to  pass  upper  grade  examinatione

				 	ing  this  period  of  interaehip~   	they  vere  aesigned  bookkeeping  and  reference
				 	material  collection  taska--literally~  a  period  of  on-the-~ob  training--but
				 	once  they  had  completed  thie  term  of  aervitude,   	they  ~aere  aseigaed  to  a
				 	working  poet.    	For  example~   	in  the  Defenae  Section  of  the  Defenae  Bureau,
				 	one  may  be  paired  ~ith  a  senior  member  to  eupervise  one  of  the  ground,
				 	maritime  or  air  subsections.    	His  dutiea  will  include  checking  and  col-
				 	lating  plane  and  appropriationa  drafted  by  the  reaponaible  staff  office.
				 	The  peraon  Who  prepared  the  drafts  is  uaually  a  peraon  of  more  experience
				 	who  is  probably  a  firat  or  second  field  grade  officer.    	Thia  officer  will

	   	_			    	In  the  pggt,  becgu~e  of  deficient  cap~bili,ey,   	th~  Ai.r  SD~  could  not  aupport
					 	ngval  wgrfare  from  Che  air  but  currently~   	the  fighter  plgnes  which  are
					 	being  deeigned  to  ~ttack  ground  tgrgets~   	are  being  used  for  training  to
					 	eupport  veasele  aC  eea.    	But  now  the  old  argument  Chat  "an  air  arm  for
					 	the  navy  ig  essenti~l"  ie  again  finding  voice.
					 	When  con~idergtion  was  firat  given  to  developing  air-Co-ground  miesilee,
					 	it  i~  raported  Chat  the  air  people  suggested  to  the  eea  arm  that,   	"Since
					 	a  new  weapon  ig  being  designed  why  ahouldn't  we  think  about  developing				_
					 	one  which  could  be  used  against  targete  at  sea?"    	The  report  adds  that
					 	the  euggeetion  got  a  cool  reception.
					 	Z'her~  is  no  aeaurance  that  interservice  wa11e  like  Choae  won't  grow  higher
					 	in  the  future.    	The  plan  we  propoee  is  to  unify  the  Ground,  Maritime  and
					 	Air  SDFe  into  a  eingle  entity.
					 	A  dozen  or  ao  yeare  ago,   	Canada  u,nified  the  three  services  into  one  force;
	   	=			    	it  was  forcib?.y  accomplished  by  the  young  42  year  old  minister  of  defense
					 	who  fired  tha  top  military  officer  who  oppoaed  it.    	Same  colored  uniforme--
					 	khaki  even  in  winter--were  ordered  worn  by  all  services.    	The  unified  force
					 	wae  divided  by  function;   	for  example,   	the  Task  Force  Comroander  controlled
					 	the  ground  taek  force,   	defense  againat  air  attacka  were  placed  under  the
					 	air  defense  command  and  eo  on.    	~'here  were  several  bugs  in  the  new  organi-
	   	-			    	zational  etructure  in  the  beginning  but  it  ia  reported  that  Canada  now
					 	has  a  stable,   	unified  milltary  force.
					 	When  the  ground-to-air  Nike  misaile  procurement  program  was  introduced,
					 	the  Defenee  Agency  waa  confronted  with  a  atiff  ~nriedictional  squabble
					 	between  the  ground  and  air  SDFs.    	The  Grourd  SDF  ineieted  that  the  missile
					 	ahould  be  put  under  ita  ~urisdiction  on  the  grounds  tha~  the  army  exer-
					 	ciaed  that  right  in  the  U.S.    	The  Air  SDF  countered  with  the  argument  that
					 	ground  based  though  they  were,   	the  sir  arm  could  operate  them  more  effi-
					 	ciently  and  effectively  as  part  of  its  reaponaibility  for  air  defense.
					 	The  director  general  of  the  Agency  who  had  the  unenviable  task  of  making
					 	a  decieion,   	gave  eome  tl~ought  to  dividing  the  Nikes  between  the  ground
					 	and  air  arme  but  apparently  the  argument  put  up  by  the  Air  SDF  prevailed
					 	since  the  misailes  were  finally  asaigned  to  it.
					 	The  Air  Traneport  Group  which  had  control  over  the  C-1  transporta  and  was
					 	responsible  for  the  movement  of  inen  and  materiel  was  placed  under  the
					 	~uriadiction  of  the  Air  SDF.    	Since  it  was  under  the  sole  control  of  the
					 	sir  arm,   	thinge  did  not  move  smoothly  when  the  Ground  SDF  needed  trans-
					 	por[ation.    	To  overcome  this  defect,   	some  Grouad  SDF  officers  were  as-
					 	signed  to  the  Air  Tranaport  Group  ta  overaee  its  Yequirements.    	This  odd
					 	peraonnel  errangement  did  not  work  out  aatiafactorily  and  t~ose  ground
					 	officere  who  had  been  loaned  to  the  air  group  were  returned  to  their  old
					 	nesting  grotmda.

									     	FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY										   	_
			     	Whither  Goes  tha  Defenae  Agency?
			     	To  fell  these  growing  walls  and  uni.fy  Che  three  SDFa  is  not  as  yet  out
			     	of  the  realm  of  poseibility.    	We  believe  tfiat  such  a  unificaCion  wuuld				 	~
			     	also  contribute  to  the  more  effective  utilization  of  the  defenae  budget.
			     	Up  to  now,   	de�ense  planning  and  budget  es~timaCing  was  done  separately
			     	by  the  varioua  staff  offices  and  thPn  submitted  to  the  InCernal  Bureau.					_
			     	The  Internal  Bureau  coordinated  Chem  and  whittled  them  down  to  fit  a  given
					framework.    	This  system  would  work  satiafactorily  if  the  given  framework
	 	~		   	was  sufficiently  large  buC  it  aeldom  is.    	With  a  amall  frame  to  work  with,
	  	-		   	even  some  of  the  ma~or  mainetay  proposals  had  to  be,  on  occasion,   	shaved
					down  to  a  point  where  its  capability  to  support  became  questionable.    	Under
					suct?.  circumstances  items~of  lower  priority  to  a  given  service  component
	  	-		   	were  deleted  completely.    	Let  us  assume  that  a  Maritime  SDF's  request  for
					appropriations  for  ~anding  crafts   	(LST's)  were  given  a  comparatively  low
					priority  by  the  Maritime  SDF  and  thErefore  was  dropped  completely  from
			     	budgetary  coneideration.    	To  the  Ground  SDF,  however,   	these  landing  craft
					could  be  an  essential  factor;  most  of  the  tanke  are  deployed  in  Hokkaido
					and  ahould  an  incident  arise  in  the  western  part  of  the  counCry,   	trana-
					portation  by  sea  would  become  the  main  factor  in  mobility.
					Admittedly,   	if  those  low  priority  items  which  had  be~n  deleted  by  the
					various  ataff  officea  could  be  restored  during  tihe  coordination  phase  at
					the  Internal  Bureau  level,   	the  problem  would  be  solved.    	But  the  fact  of
					the  matter  is  that  the  Internal  Bureau  has  neither  the  capability  nor
	   	-		   	the  manpower  to  prepare  a  well  coordinated  budget  or  defense  plan.    	In	 	~
					the  case  of  the  U.S.,   	the  civilian  body  in  the  Defense  Department  has
					both  the  capability  and  the  personnel  to  accomplish  those  coordinations	     	�
					on  its  own.    	Given  those  factors,  we  could  start  thinking  idealistically
					in  terms  of  civilian  control;  but  in  the  case  of  Japan,   	all  we  can  do  at
					the  t~},rrent  stage  is  to  think  of  how  the  system  could  be  improved  with
					what  we  have.
					We  hope  that  the  above  gives  a  broad  bruah  description  of  the  current  sta-
					tua  of  the  Defenae  Agency  and  the  SDFa  and  the  problems  inherent  to  them.
					Th~.s  is  a  time  when  the  concept  of  reai:tion  defense  is  being  rekindled
					and  when  much  thought  is  being  given  to  the  defense  function  and  estab-
					lishruent.    	The  next  2  or  3  years  could  be  crucial  to  the  future  fate  of
					Japan.    	Needless  to  say,   	that  which  will  seal  the  fate  is  public  opinion
					but  we  cannot  help  but  harbor  a  aense  of  uneasiness  if  we  allow  the  cur-			  	~
					rently  impotent  Defense  Agency  to  continue  on  its  aimless  meandering
					course.
