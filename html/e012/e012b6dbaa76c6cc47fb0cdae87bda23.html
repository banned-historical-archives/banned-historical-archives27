 INDOCHINA
 Hanoi's continuing polemical propaganda in the wake of Peking's
 moves to improve relations with the United States includes a
 22 August NHAN DAN Commentator article entitled "Nixon--The Man
 and His Doctrine," which reaches a new level of fury and. venom
 against China when in the course of assailing U.S. splitting
 tactics it says:  "A very perfidious move of the President's is
 to spray the toxic gas of chauvinism into opportunist heads in a
 bid to play off socialist countries against one another and sow
 schism among the communist and workers' parties."  Hanoi's concern
 over Peking's attitude toward the United States is also reflected,
 less directly, in propaganda marking the 26th anniversary of the
 August Revolution.  Editorials in both the party organ NHAN DAN and
 the party paper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN give marked stress to the
 "independence" and "correctness" of the Vietnam Workers Party's
 policies and state firmly that the United States is the "number one
 enemy.,"
 At she same tL..e, Hanoi has moved quickly to applaud a Peking
 position with which it is in sympathy:  A DRV Foreign Ministry
 spokesman's statement on the 23d says that the Vietnamese fully
 support the Chinese Foreign Ministry statement of the 20th which
 rejected the U.S. move for representation of both the PRC and ROC
 in the United Nations.
 Peking has continued to ignore Hanoi's polemicizing, and publicity
 for the DRV National Assembly delegation's stopover in Peking en
 route to Europe stresses close relations.  NCNA lauds the
 "revolutionary friendship" between the two peoples and reports that
 toasts were exchanged at a banquet at which the two sides said their
 peoples "would always unite, fight, and win victory together."
 VNA's cryptic reports of the stopover say nothing of this, although
 VNA cues say that Chou En-lai "received and had a cordial talk"
 with 4elegation head Hoang Van Hoan.
 Routine Soviet propaganda continues to charge that the President,
 by his planned trip to Peking, hopes to take advantage of Peking's
 "splittist" attitude and settle the issue "behind the back of the
 Vietnamese people."  And Moscow continues its reports of polemical
 Hanoi material with radio broadcasts--including broadcasts in
 Mandarin and Vietnamese--of the August HOC TAP editorial.
 HANOI SAYS U.S. USES PRC "OPPORTUNISM" TO DIVIDE COMMUNISTS
 The 22 August NHAN DAN Commentator article, as reviewed by VNA
 that day, goes beyond other propaganda in making it clear that

 Hanoi feels the Chinese are allowing their nationalism to lead
 them to policies which undermine the unity of socialist countries.
 While Hanoi propaganda in recent weeks has repeatedly stressed the
 main thesis of the article--that the Nixon Doctrine seeks to
 divide revolutionary forces--Commentator offers the most venlmous
 characterization of China to date when he refers to the President's
 ploy of "spraying the toxic gas of chauvinism into opportunist
 heads" in order to sow disunity among communists.
 There is no indication of the length of the article as published
 in NHAi1 DAN; this is the only polemical article that has not been
 broadcast by Hanoi's domestic radio except for the 3 August NHAN
 DAN article by "Chien Thang" which VNA belatedly excerpted on
 the llth.*  However, evidence that VNA truncated Commentator's
 attack ou the President comes in Hanoi's broadcast in Mandarin on
 the 25th** of what it called "the first half" of the article,
 containing passages not included in VNA's account.  At the same
 time, the broadcast on the 25th did not contain the most caustic
 references to China that appear in the VNA account; it remains
 to be seen whether these references will appear in  a  broadcast
 of the second half of the article.
 The version in Mandarin, in the course of tracing the President's
 career for the past 25 years, observes that in his "global strategy"
 he has made many trips around the wo_'d.  Beginning by saying that
 shortly after he was elected to Congress in 19.7 he went to
 Europe, the broadcast version proceeds to trace his travels, saying
 amon, other things that shortly after his assumption of the
 Presidency "he set out for Europe before he could propose any
 effective measures for dealing with the domestic situation.  He
 then crossed the Pacific and came to Asia."  It also mentions
 his travels to Africa and Latin America, but although it says
 that since 1947 he has "treated ..Europe as the most formidable
 rival to the United States," it does not mention his visit to the
 Soviet Union or his subsequ:nt trips to Romania and Yugoslavia after
 he became President.
 *  See the TRENDS of 18 August 1971, pages 1-4.
 ** FBIS did not begin monitoring the Hanoi Mandarin programs until
 the 19th; hence there is no way of knowing whether they may have
 carried some version of the Chieng Thang article.

 DRV ANNIVERSARY:  STRESS ON "CORRECT" INDEPENDENT POLICIES
 The 19 August NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorials marking
 the 26th anniversary of the August Revolution both dwell on the
 development of Vietnam's "correct" and "independent" policies
 and strategies--a subject which was also a central concern of
 the earlier HGC TAP editorial pegged to the August Revolution
 anniversary and DRV National Day.*  Hanoi's continuing
 assertions about the correctness of its stand are undoubtedly
 prompted in part by concern over Sino-U.S. relations.  But
 it is possible that this preoccupation also reflects a debate
 in Hanoi over future policies.  Questions of strategy were
 discussed in the 19 August QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial last
 year, but this issue was not broached in last year's NHAN DAN
 anniversary editorial or in recent HOC TAP anniversary editorials.
 Both the NHAN DAN and the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorials, in the
 course of lauding Vietnamese strategies, express high praise
 for the party's leadership.  Asserting that correct leadership
 is a "basic condition" for success, NHAN DAN goes on to claim
 that the Vietnamese party has "correctly solved the problems
 of strategy and tactics and problems related to the methods
 and form of revolutionary struggle."  The QUAN DOI NHAN DAN
 editorial similarly stresses the role of the party's
 leadership; it holds that a revolution cannot succeed
 without creative leadership and that the party's creativeness
 in the August Revolution was a manifestation of its
 independence, acute political vision, and great organizational
 capabilities.  The editorial observes that the present
 resistance struggle is also "an irrefutable proof of the
 invincible strength of our party's correct line-- toward
 independence and sovereignty."  It lauds the southern
 people's "proper" revolutionary lines, "versatile" methods,
 and "excellent military art," and it also notes that "the
 strategic methods and ideology that have guided the
 fighting in the revolutionary war in the South have
 undergone changes through new discoveries."
 NKAN DAN refers only in general terms to victories in
 defeating Vietnamization; QUAN DOI NHAN DAN goes beyond
 this, seeming to refer to Lam Son 719 and the fighting in

 Cambodia when it makes passing mention of "strong blows by
 the main force troops" at the beginning of the year.  But
 like the HOC TAP anniversary editorial, it fails to describe
 these actions as "strategic victories."  On the other hand,
 both NHAN DAN and QUAN DOI NHAN DAN echo the atypical theme--
 played earlier in the 5 August QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial on
 the anniversary of the Tonkin Gulf incident--that the worst
 part of the struggle is over.  Thus, NHAN DAN claims that the
 Vietnamese revolution is facing basic advantages and that
 "the biggest difficulties and trials have been overcome."
 And QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, noting progress over the past 26
 years, observes that "the darkest hours are things of the
 past."
 FRONT ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE SOFT-PEDALS PARTY TIES WITH DRV
 The Front marked the August Revolution anniversary with a
 message from NFLSV Central Committee Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho
 and PRG President Huynh Tan Phat, an NFLSV "circular" calling
 for determination in the continued struggle, and editorial
 comment.  Like Hanoi, the Fr-at stressed the independence
 theme, saying that the spirit of the August Revolution which
 achieved the independence and freedom of the northern half
 of the country is still alive today in the South, which is
 determined to reach the same goals.  An editorial published
 in a special issue of the Front organ GIAI PHONG, broadcast
 by Liberation Radio on the 19th, says that each victory of
 the anti-U.S. struggle "has originated from the most important
 cause--our proper and creative revolutionary lines of
 independence and self-government."
 GIAI PHONG also charges that President Nixon "still resorts
 to many deceitful, evasive moves" to avoid responding to the
 PRG's 1 July initiative.  And a radio editorial broadcast on
 the 20th seems to allude to the President's China policy even
 more directly when it claims he "has resorted to many
 perfi;ious diplomatic maneuvers in the hope of deceiving
 public opinion about the so-called 'pressure' upon our people
 in order to avoid responding to the 1 July" PRG peace
 initiative.  It adds that he "stupidly refuses to admit the
 powerful strength and endless capabilities of a small but
 independent people."  An LPA editorial of the 19th comments
 in a similar vein.

 Although the 18 August message of greetings is signed by Nguyen
 Huu Tho in his capacity as NFLSV Central Committer Chairman as
 well as by PRG President Huynh Tan Phat, VWP First Secretary
 Le Duan is not among the addressees.  The message is addressed
 only to DRV President Ton Duc Thang, National Assembly Standing
 Committee Chairman Truong Chinh, and Premier Van Dong, where
 last year's joint NFLSV-PRG message--not sent until September--
 had been addressed to all four leaders.*  Le Duan's name may
 have been dropped this year in order to avoid identifying the
 NFLSV with the communist party and to play up its character
 as a "front."  The message asks that best wishes be conveyed
 to the people and army in the North, where last year's
 message had also extended greetings to the Central Committee
 of the Vietnam Workers Party, the National Assembly and DRV
 Government, and the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland
 Front.
 These departures from the norm follow another recent departure
 from past practice:  The VWP slogans issued on 5 August for

 DRV, PRG ENDORSE PEKING POSITION ON UN REPRESENTATION
 Hanoi media on 23 August and Liberation Radio on the 24th,
 respectively, carried statements by the DRV and PRG foreign
 ministry spokesmen endorsing the 20 August PRC Foreign
 Ministry statement outlining Peking's stand on the UN
 representation issue.   (NCNA reported the DRV statement
 promptly on the 2lth.) Both statements duly note the rejection
 of "two Chinas" and observe that Taiwan is an "inseparable"
 part of China.
 Prior to the release of the DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 statement, Hanoi's last known reference to the Taiwan-UN
 issue came in t1   19 June joint DRV-Romanian communique
 concluding Ceausescu's visit.  The communique said:   "The
 two sides resolutely support the Chinese people's struggle
 for the liberation of Taiwan, an inalienable territory
 of the PRC, for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the
 liquidation of U.S. military bases in Taiwan; they demand
 restoration to the PRC of its rights in the United Nations
 and in other international organizations."
 During Chou En-lai's visit to Hanoi in March this year,
 Premier Pham Van Dong in two separate speeches also
 reiterated Vietnamese support of the Chinese "in their
 resolve to liberate Taiwan" and declared that "it is
 imperative that the PRC should have her rightful seat in
 the United Nations."
 Hanoi media are not known to have explicitly discussed a
 two-Chinas policy since last fall, when there were articles
 in NHAN DAN.

 DRV DELEGATION STOPS IN PEKING, MOSCOW EN ROUTE TO EUROPE
 The DRV National Assembly delegation led by Politburo member
 Hoang Van Hoan, which Hanoi on 18 August announced would visit
 the USSR, Poland, Romania and Czechoslovakia, arrived in Warsaw
 on 23 August after stopovers in Peking and Moscow.  On the
 24th VNA--but apparently not Moscow--briefly reported that the
 delegation had made a stopover on 22-23 August in the Soviet
 capital, where it was met at the airport and hosted at a
 banquet by Central Committee member and chairman of the Soviet
 of the Union Shitikov.  VNA said that after visiting East
 Europe, the delegation would return to the USSR for an "official
 friendship visit."  During its 27-30 June Moscow stopover last
 year, the DRV National Assembly delegation had been hosted by
 Chairman of the USSR Parliamentary Group Spiridonov and had
 gone sightseeing in the capital.
 The delegation's arrival in Peking on the 18th was promptly
 reported by NCNA, which noted that it was welcomed by Politburo
 member Chiu Hui-Tao; Kuo Mo-Jo, Central Committee member and
 vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
 Committee; and Keng Piao, head of the Central Committee's
 International Liaison Department.  NCNA noted that the delegation
 was "on its way to Europe" and reported that officials of the
 Polish, Romanian, Czechoslovak, and Soviet embassies were present,
 without specifying that these are the countries it will visit.
 On the 19th NCNA reported a meeting between the delegation and
 Chou Fn-lai at which there was "a very cordial and friendly
 conversation."  Another NCNA item that day reported that
 Chiu Hui-Tso and Kuo Mo-Jo held a banquet that evening which
 "was permeated with an atmosphere of revolutionary friendship
 between the people of China and Vietnam, 'who are both comrades
 and brothers.'"  In their toasts, according to NCNA, Chiu
 and Hoan said that the Ch9.nese and Vietnamese people "would
 always unite, fight, and win victiry together."  On 22 August
 Peking reported the group's departure that day "for a visit to
 Europe," again noting that officials of the same four embassies
 were present at the airport and again failing to spell out the
 itinerary.  The delegation was seen off by Chiu and Kuo Mo-Jo.
 VNA has reported less detail than. NCNA did about the Hoan
 delegation's stopover in Peking and has not echoed NCNA's
 warmest descriptions of the atmosphere of the visit.  The DRV
 news agency noted briefly on 22 August that Chou had "received

 and had a cordial ta1':" with Hoan and that the delegation was
 honored at a banquet.  But it gave no details of  he banquet
 and thus did not echo references by NCNA to "revolutionary
 friendship" and comradeship between the two peoples.  Coming
 in the midst of Hanoi's polemic with Peking over Sino-U.S.
 relations, the relative coolness of Hanoi's reports on Hoan's
 reception in the Chinese capital does not seem accidental.
 It should be noted, however, that the DRV accounts of l'oan's
 stopover in Peking were also less effusive than the Chinese
 accounts last year--perhaps reflecting Hanoi's desire to
 maintain its balance between Peking and Moscow.
 MOSCOW PUBLICIZES SUPPLEMENTARY AID TO DRV. ATTACKS PEKING
 Further publicity for the recently signed USSR-DRV agreement
 "to strengthen the DRV defense potentialities," tersely
 reported by TASS on 18 August, sheds no further light on the
 officials involved or the precise date it was signed.*  On the
 20th VNA specified that the agreement was for "Soviet nonrefund
 supplementary military aid to Vietnam for 1971."  Like TASS, it
 said Vice Premier Novikov "attended" the signing ceremony.
 Moscow radio and PRAVDA on 21 August, in reporting briefly that
 Novikov had received a vice chairman of the DRV State Planning
 Commission and a DRV deputy minister of foreign trade on the
 20th for a discussion of the development of trade and economic
 cooperation, noted only that the aid agreement had been signed
 "earlier."
 Followup Moscow comment gives no further information on the nature
 of the aid agreement but does review Soviet economic and military
 aid to the DRV over past ye&rs.  Commentators stress DRV leaders'
 expressions of gratitude, and some once again take the opportunity
 to attack Peking's stand.  A 20 August Radio Peace and Progress
 commentary in Mandarin contrasted the USSR's military aid to the DRV
 with Chinese verbal support.  It renewed charges that the PRC not
 only failed to aid the Vietnamese but also obstructed the passage
 of Soviet aid through Chinese territory, recalling that the
 Chinese had even attacked and insulted Soviet experts who were
 on their way to aid the Vietnamese.  On the same day as the

 broadcast, a PRAVDA article by Tikhvinskiy reviewing a
 history of Sino-Soviet relations included a reference to
 Chinese obstruction of Soviet aid to Vietnam in a passage on
 Red Guard antics in the 1966-69 period of the Cultural
 Revolution.  The Red Guards were said to have harassed
 crews of Soviet ships and aircraft transporting cargoes to
 Vietnam.*
 Another Radio Peace and Progress Mandarin-languE a commentary
 on Soviet aid on the 22d reiterated that Peking is trying to
 discredit the USSR's "internationalist stand" and "sabotage"
 the friendly relations between the Indochinese and Soviet
 peoples.  It said Peking's policies have "caused great losses"
 to the national liberation movements in Indochina and serve
 the interests of the imperialists and their puppets.
 BROADCASTS      Continuing its nick-up of polemical Hanoi
 OF HOC TAP      material, Moscow on 19 and 20 August broadcast
 summaries of the editorial in the August issue
 of the DRV party journal HOC TAP to domestic and foreign
 audiences.  Accounts of the editorial in Vietnamese and Mandarin
 included its charges that the United States is the number one
 enemy and that the Nixon Administration is attempting to sow
 disunity among socialist countries.  Nctably, it did not include
 the editorial's strongest statements of Vietnamese independence--
 omitting, for example, its contention that the Vietnam problem is
 one between the Vietnamese and the United States and its assertion
 that "only those who are fighting the Americans can raise the
 decisive voice regarding the future of their own country."
 The accounts also include HOC TAP's references to socialist aid
 and the importance of international unity to the Vietnam struggle.
 Moscow did not repeat the editorial's assertion that "many"
 parties have held that their attitude toward the Vietnamese
 resistance is a "touchstone of proletarian internationalism."
 This formula has been used in the past by Moscow in its attacks
 on Peking:  For example, the 28 November 1965 PRAVDA editorial
 on communist unity maintained that "support rendered to the
 Vietnamese people's just struggle is the touchstone of how this
 or that communist party fulfills its international duty."

 PARIS DELEGATES ASSAIL U.S, POLICY; MEDIA NOTE ECON'-MIC MOVES
 Vietnamese communist propaganda continues to provide only abbreviated
 coverage of the Paris talks, along with routine, low-key publicity
 for world support for the 1 July PRG peace proposal.  At the 19 August
 Paris session, the DRV and PRG delegates again asserted that the
 seven-point proposal provides a way out for the United States.  And
 both again levied the familiar charge that the Nixon Administration
 continues to seek a military victory in Vietnam in order to
 "'negotiate from strength."  They stressed that as long ac the
 Administration "clings" to Vietnamization, all its "professions of
 'active negotiations' are only empty words."  Both delegates
 denounced U.S. action throughout Indochina, including that
 against the DRV; DRV delegate Xuan Thuy--back at the talks after
 his absence last week--cited the 16 August DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman's statement condemning "war crimes" agai:.at
 the North.
 PRG delegate Dinh Ba Thi, standing in for Mme. Binh, also
 pressed the persistent charges against the conduct of the elections
 in South Vietnam.  VNA's account of the session said that he
 "unmasked" U.S. claims of neutrality in the elections and charged
 that "everyone knows" that the United States allows President
 Thieu "to use all measures to eliminate his opponents, terrorize
 voters, and repress leaders of anti-fraudulent election
 organizations."
 The VNA account of the session failed to note PRG delegate Mme.
 Binh's absence this week, although it had mentioned Xuan Thuy's
 absence the previous week.  In neither case is it clear whether
 or not the absence stemmed from the fact that there is no chief
 U.S. negotiator in Paris (the communist delegations still have
 not acknowledged the appointment of Ambassador Porter, who is to
 assume his duties as head of the delegation on 30 August).
 Asked about Mme. Binh's absence, the PRG press spokesman at the
 post-session press briefing explained that she "needs a rest."
 But two days after the session she addressed a U.S. anti-war
 national convention in Michigan by telephone, according to VNA
 on the 25th, which reported that she "exposed" the Administration's
 Vietnamization policy, "developed in detail" the seven-point peace
 initiative, and "called on the participants to take actions" to
 urge the Administration to respond seriously to the proposals.
 For the third straight week VNA dismissed the allies' statements
 in one sentence, claiming that the U.S. and GVN delegates
 "again exerted themselves to plead for their policy of prolonging

 and intensifying the war."  Thus the account made no mention of
 U.S. Ambassador Habib's charge that the communist forces, not
 the United States, are the cause of the recent step-up of military
 action near the DMZ, and VNA also failed to record his reiteration
 of the call for a cease-fire.
 NIXON MEASURES      Both the communist delegates made passing
 ON U.S. ECONOMY     references to the "economic difficulties"
 of the United States.  Xuan Thuy, in a remark
 VNA did not report, charged that the war is the "major cause of
 the serious U.S. economic and monetary crisis and of the growing
 difficulties the American people have to face in their daily life."
 Thi said that U.S. defeats in Indochina in addition to the
 "inc.-easing difficulties encountered by the U.S. economy and
 finance . . . represent concrete proof of U.S. failure."
 Hanoi media responded to the President's 15 August announcement
 of economic measures with a flurry of propaganda which highlights
 their discrimination against the working man.  In citing the
 international implications, Hanoi points out the cavalier U.S.
 attitude toward its allies and trading partners.  There has been
 little effort to date to connect the economic measures with
 U.S. Vietnam war policy.  However, an article in NHAN DAN on
 21 August by Nguyen Huu Chinh* does say that the President in
 his speech "tacitly admitted" that the war "is still weighing
 heavily" on the economy, but tried "to make his listeners think
 that the many present economic and financial difficulties stemmed
 from the fact that the United States is ending the war."  The
 article, which is broadcast on the 22d by Hanoi radio in Vietnamese
 to South Vietnam, scores this as one of the President's "commonl~-
 used deceitful tricks."  Chinh, who has written articles on the
 1968 presidential election and the President's role in the 1970
 congressional election, charges that the President's measures
 were made with an eye toward the 1972 elections.

 MEDIA SAY MINH, KY WITHDRAWALS EXPOSE SAIGON ELECTION "FARCE"
 Vietnamese communist media, sustaining their close attention to
 the South Vietnamese elections,'E duly reported and commented on
 the major political events of '.,iie week:  Duong Vun Minh's
 20 August announcement of his withdrawal from the presidential
 race, the 21 August reversal by the Supreme Court in approving
 Vice President Ky's candidacy, and Ky's 23 August announcement
 that he will not participate in the presidential election
 campaign.
 The most authoritative communist reaction was a 23 August state-
 ment by the spokesman for the PRG delegation in Paris, reported
 by LPA on the 24th and by VNA on the 25th.  The statement maintained
 that "happenings in recent days have fully unmasked the stage-setting
 and crude maneuvers of the Nixon Administration" and have exposed
 as "brazen and odious lies" the President's "allegations" about
 respect for the right of self-determination of the South Vietnamese
 people, nonintervention in their internal affairs, and a neutral
 position in the elections.  Like other comment, the statement
 said  he elections are aimed at "maintaining the bellicose Thieu
 clique as a tool to realize" Vietnamization.
 Minh's announcement on 20 August that he was withdrawing from the
 presidential race prompted a Hanoi radio commentary that day
 claiming that his a,c;,.Lon more clearly exposed the "deceitful and
 perfidious" nature of the elections.  A 21 August NHAN DAN
 commentary went further to assert that his withdrawal represented
 a "slap on Nixon's face."  It charged that the United States had
 given "covert blessing and sympathy" to Thieu's "brazen and
 fraudulent tricks" which had caused Minh to withdraw.  The
 article's attack on President Nixon included a seeming reference
 to Sino-U.S. developments when it charged that the President's
 "insidious intent" to use the Saigon government's power
 apparatus for Vietnamization "was revealed even more clearly by
 the fact that Nixon deliberately carried out crafty diplomatic
 maneuvers to avoid responding" to the PRG's seven-point proposal.
 *  Hanoi's domestic service in the past two weeks devoted about
 15 percent of its news and comment to the South Vietnam elections;

 25 AUGUST 1971
 The South Vietnamese Supreme Court's 21 August decision to
 accept Ky's candidacy in the presidential election was dismissed
 by a Hanoi broadcast on the same day as "a new trick by Bunker
 and Thieu in their attempt to save the puppet presidential
 election .  . . from becoming an extremely ridiculous and
 shameless farce with Thieu as the only candidate."  The radio
 said Thieu only wished to use Ky as a "stepping stone" to
 his own reelection.  The possibility that Ky might not run
 was noted, for example, in a 22 August Hanoi broadcast to the
 South which commented:  "Surely Ky will realize more than
 anyone else that Nixon and Bunker only want him to play a
 subordinate role in the coming elections."  A Hanoi broadcast
 on the 23d characterized Ky's withdrawal announcement that day
 as "another setback for the Americans and Thieu in their
 attempt to make arrangements so that the election farce may
 have two presidential candidates" in order to "daub a layer of
 fake democracy" on it.
 Comment on Ky's action so far has not mentioned his proposal
 that both he and President Thieu resign and that the election
 be held in three months, with the president of the South
 Vietnamese Senate acting as head of government in the interim.
 LOWER HOUSE     Liberation Radio commentaries on 20 and 22 August
 ELErTIONS       echoed earlier communist comment on South Vietnam's
 29 August elections to the lower house when they
 charged that the voting will be rigged but called on the people
 to try to use the election to oust Thieu's supporters in the
 assembly.*  The commentary on the 20th also repeated the communist
 view that a minority among the deputies favors the people's
 interests while the majority is controlled by President Thieu.
 The 22 August Liberation Radio commentary went into unusual
 detail on methods of identifying good candidates and exposing
 Thieu's supporters among contestants for lower house seats.
 It told listeners to investigate the candidates' backgrounds
 and observe their attitudes toward the Thieu administration, and
 it spelled out the criteria:   "Thieu's opponents are those who
 have refused to join the Thieu clique and who, in one way or
 another, have supported and struggled for peace, independence,
 and national concord," have joined or supported the urban people's

 struggle, and "have been subjected to repression and terrorism."
 The broadcast predicted that "our compatriots," once they have
 been "forced" to vote, will "resolutely try to gain complete
 mastership over their ballots."  It concluded that "if Thieu's
 servants are again elected to the Saigon lower house, it will
 be entirely because of the Nixon-Bunker--Thieu clique's election
 frauds and absolutely not because of the consent of various
 strata of the people in urban areas and in areas under temporary
 Enemy control."
 DRV. PRG SPOKESMEN SCORE U.S. STRIKES IN DMZ, AT NORTH
 0
 The only hint in Vietnamese communist propaganda of increased U.S.
 bombing activity in and near the demilitarized zone comes in the
 release of a 19 August PRG Foreign Ministry spokesman's
 statement.  While the Front statement largely echoes the
 16 August DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's protest,* it goes on
 to charge that the United States is bombing the southern part of
 the DMZ as w_ .1 as the northern portion.  PRG protests at the
 spokesman's level against U.S. activity in the DMZ and the DRV
 are unusual, although PRG Foreign Ministry statements have been
 issued in the past in response to major military action against
 the North.  The PRG protest makes no mention of the 16 August
 protest from the DRV, but repeats its assertion that the U.S.
 Command in Saigon "has tried with utterly arrogant arguments to
 plead for  such serious acts of war."
 For its part, the DRV Foreign Ministry on 23 August issued another
 in its series of routine spokesman's protests which "sternly
 condemns" the United States for attacking Quang Binh Province and
 Vinh Linh areas.  The spokesman said that on 16 and 17 August,
 U.S. aircraft struck a number of places in Quang Binh Province and
 that on 18-20 August U.S. aircraft, incluiing B-52s, bombed Huong
 Lap village.  In addition, he charged that from 16 to 21 August
 U.S. artillery guns installed south of the DMZ and aboard ships
 shelled the villages of Vinh Quang, Vinh Giang, Vinh Son, and
 Huong Lap, described as 'oeing north of the 17th parallel and
 inside the DMZ.  The statement says that these strikes "inflicted
 extensive human and material losses on the local people" and it
 "vehemently denounced and sternly condemned" them, demanding that
 the United States immediately and permanently end all encroachments
 upon DRV sovereignty and security.

 ROMANIA-USSR-PRC
 Romania's tactical approach coupling a display of national unity
 with defiance 1  tbe face of Soviet bloc pressures was sharply
 in evidence in publicity for the "unanimous" endorsement of
 Ceausescu's independent foreign policy course at a joint meeting
 of top party '1nd government bodies on 19 August, followed the next
 day by a mil/.tantly patriotic speech in which the Romanian leader
 rejected the. concept of any "center" in the communist movement and
 defended his country's right to develop relations--including
 military--outside the framework of the Soviet bloc.
 Ceausescu's defiant speech came against the background of
 continuing expressions of suspicion and distrust of Chinese
 maneuvering in the Balkans as well as pointed warnings to
 the Romanians from Moscow's hardcore allies.  The agitation
 from theee quarters coincided with the visit of a high-level
 Chinese military delegation to Tirana and Bucharest, where it
 arrived on 22 August for an "official visit."
 Soviet-Romanian tensions were reflected in a terse Bucharest
 radio report on the 18th of Ceausescu's meeting %:'ith Soviet
 Ambassador Drozenko that day "at the latter's request."  The
 report telegraphed the apparently unsatisfactory results in
 noting that the talks took place in "a comradely atmosphere."
 It was on the f)llowing day that the unheralded party-govern-
 ment meeting took place to endorse Ceausescu's policies,
 including his June visit to the PRC.  PRAVDA, briefly report-
 ing the joint session on the 21st, noted only that the sesr&on
 had approved the new CEMA program.
 While Moscow has relied on its proxy spokesmen in East Europe
 to bring open propaganda pressure to bear on the Romanians,
 its own greetings to Romania on the 23 August anniversary of
 its liberation from the Nazis was markedly cooler in tone than
 on past anniversaries.  An insistent stress on Romania's debt
 to the USSR had not been present in last year's message.
 CEAUSESCU FLAUNTS DONESTIC.SUPPORT FOR MAVERICK POLICIES
 United, popular support for Ceausescu's policies was underscored
 in Bucharest's publicity for the 19 August meeting of the
 Romanian Communist Party Central Committee, the State Council,
 the Council of Ministers, and other party and government bodies--
 down to the level of chief editors of the central press.

 25 AUGUST 1971
 The national unity theme was expressed in resolutions paused
 "unanimously" by the meeting supporting the Romanian delega-
 tion's activity at the July CEMA Council meeting and Ceausescu's
 Asian tour.  The first resolution described the delegation's
 stand at the CEMA meeting as "fully in keeping with the political
 line established by the 10th party congress" for the development
 of economic relations both in CEMA and with "all the socialist
 states," a point underscored in Romania's earlier propaganda
 expressing satiafaction's,t the compromise-'program adopted at
 the meeting.  The second resolution hailed Ceausescu's trip to Asia
 as a contribution not only to bilateral interests but to the
 interests of the peoples of "all the socialist countries."
 Ceausescu used a military occasion, the ceremony conferring
 officers' ranks on military school graduates, and an anniver-
 sary carrying a patriotic national thrust, the 150th anniver-
 sary of the 1821 uprising against the Ottoman empire, to deliver
 his blatantly nationalistic speech on the 20th.  Stressing. the
 need for military preparedness, he invoked Romania's revolution-
 ary traditions in calling upon youth and "the broad people's
 masses"--in a speech broadcast live by Radio Bucharest--to be
 ready to "defend their revolutionary conquests" in Vio event of
 "imperialist aggression."
 The Romanian leader followed a pro forma, obligatory pledge to
 strengthen cooperation within the Warsaw Pact with a --statement
 of Romania's resolve to develop "cooperation and friendship with
 the armies of all socialist countries," underscoring the specific
 assertion of intent to broaden military contac~,s outside the Pact:
 "The development of cooperation with all socialist states as set
 forth by the 10th congress," he added, "involves all economic
 and social bodies, and the army as well."  This policy was flaunted
 in practice by Romania's cordial reception of the Chinese military
 delegation lea by Li Te-sheng, an alternate Politburo member and
 chief of the PLA's political department, on its 15 August stopover
 en route to Tirana and upon its return a week later for an "official
 visit of friendship" to Rcmarla at the defense minister's invita-
 tion.
 Setting forth Romania's view of "proletarian internationalism,"
 Ceausescu described tendencies toward "isolation or national
 narrowmindedness as alien to our party, to the Marxist-Leninist
 policy of developing ties with all socialist countries, .  . .
 which is the profoundly internationalist spirit inspiring our
 party."  Dwelling on the need for the autonomy of parties, he

 stated that the dissolution of the Comintern had shown that
 "the communist movement cannot be led any more from any center,
 that it is necessary for each party to act independently, and
 that the communist movement does not need any center in any
 part of the world."*
 Bucharest's special relationship with Yugoslavia was clearly
 the main point of Ceausescu's avowal that Romania is striving
 to develop good relations with its neighbors, "the Soviet
 Union, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Hungary"--placing nonalined
 Yugoslavia on a par with the USSR and two of its loyal allies.
 In the same vein, Ceausescu added--this time with Bucharest-
 Peking cordiality the main point--that the Romanians do not
 for one moment forget that "the socialist system comprises
 lk countries in Europe, Asia, and America, and thus it is our
 international duty to the cause of socialism and our own
 people to develop cooperation and friendship with all the
 socialist countries."  In another passage he replayed a ver-
 sion of a pervasive Peking propaganda theme in noting the
 historical lesson that "the amr-`. and medium-sized countries"
 have always been victimized by imperialist power politics:
 "That is why we believe that these countries must act firmly,
 together with all the anti-imperialist forces, for the defense
 of their national sovereignty, the right to develop freely
 and independently."  Ceausescu has pointed in the past to the
 important role of the smaller countries, in pressing for the
 abolition of blocs and criticizing policies of imperialist
 "diktat."  But his references to the "small and medium-size
 countries"--whose ranks Peking has sought to rally in opposi-
 tion to the two "superpowers"--has a particularly provocative
 ring at this juncture and in this context.
 SOVIET LEADERS, COI4IENTATORS REMIND ROMANIA OF DEBT TO USSR
 The message from Brezhnev, Podgornyy, and Kosygin to Ceausescu
 and Maurer on the 27th ani,.iversary of Romania's liberation
 from the Nazis, published in PRAVDA on 23 August, is notable
 for a reminder--not present in last year's message--that the
 defeat of the Nazis "by the Soviet army" and the armed uprising
 "carried out under these conditions" in Romania "created the
 *  Monitors noted that Ceausescu emphasized this passage by
 reading it in a particularly forceful manner.

 necessary preconditions for the transition to fundamental
 revolutionary reforms."       The same theme dominated Moscow radio
 comment to Romania on the anniversary.  Where last year's
 message referred to the Romanian oacp.Le's "selfless labor"
 under the tutelage of their communist party "and in close
 cooperation with the fraternal socialist countries," the
 current one emphasizes that the Romanians had achieved
 successes "by relying on all-round cooperation with the
 socialist community countries and making use of their
 experiences."  This theme, too, has been prominent in
 Moscow's comment in Romanian.
 Last year's message, in a relatively euphoric period follow-
 ing the conclusion of the Soviet-Romanian friendship treaty,
 vowed that the Soviet party and government would continue to
 exert all efforts to consolidate "the relations of fraternal
 friendship" with socialist Romania and to promote the develop-
 ment of "comradely cooperation" within the Warsaw Pact and CEMA,
 with a view to "even closer cohesion" of the socialist community.
 This year the Soviets merely promise "to pursue the line of
 5Lrengthening friendship" (it is no longer "fraternal") and does
 not characterize Romanian-Soviet cooperation.  And it delivers
 what is in effect a lecture to the Romanians, to the effect
 that the deepening of cooperation in the Pact and CEMA--tthich
 "were reflected" in the treaty signed last year--"constitute
 a stable foundation for the development of Soviet-Romanian
 relations."
 Where last year's message wished the Romanians new successes
 in building socialism "and in the struggle for peace and
 friendship between the peoples," this one wishes them success
 only in building socialism.
 In line with Moscow's avoidance ofvditeet1pol,emical-6attacks on
 the Romanians, its comment on the liberation anniversary
 presents an ostensible picture of harmonious relations.  But
 by playing up the Soviet role in the liberation and by issuing
 more pointed reminders than usual of the Romanians' close
 treaty ties to the Soviet bloc, Moscow has in effect reasserted
 its right to monitor the status of socialism in Romania.  PRAVDA
 reported on the 21st that CPSU Central Committee Secretary
 Katushev, in charge of relations with ruling communist parties,
 attended a Romanian-Soviet friendship meeting marking the anni-
 versary.  The Soviet speaker at the meeting, deputy chairman of
 the friendship society, delivered what amounted to a lecture on
 the major Soviet role in Romania's liberation and on the inipor-

 tance now of "fraternal cooperation" and "united efforts in the
 struggle for common aims" in the successful building of Social-
 ism and in "defense of the working people's gains."
 An article in RED STAR on 23 August recalled the price the
 Soviets had paid in blood for Romania's liberation ana the
 role the presence of Soviet troops on Romanian soil had
 played in helping the Romanian party attain and consolidate
 its leadership.  Underscoring the point that Romania's future
 lies in close cooperation with the Soviet bloc, the article
 stressed that Bucharest's economic successes have been
 achieved through the labor of the Romanian people and the
 "cooperation with the socialist countries" in CEMA and the
 Warsaw Pact.  A Radio Moscow broadcast to Romania on the
 19th emphasized the contribution made by the presence of
 Soviet troops on Romanian soil "to the development of the
 revolution and the prevention of civil war" during the period
 following the Nazi defeat.
 An East Berlin radio commentary on the Romanian anniversary
 on the 23d spelled out the message to the Romanians more
 sharply.  Noting that speakers at the Bucharest anniversary
 celebrations had referred to Romania's expanding relations
 with the PRC as well as cooperation with Moscow, the commenta-
 tor went on to state that "Romania's future and its safe pro-
 spects ultimately are based on cooperation" with the Soviet
 Union, "from which it obtained its full sovereignty through
 the sacrificial and liberating deed of the Soviets."
 PEKING PLAYS UP TIES WITH BUCHAREST. WARNS OF PRESSURES
 Peking has used the occasion of Romania's liberation anniversary
 to express support for the Rcmanians and to call attention to
 Soviet pressures against the maverick Balkan communist coun-
 tries.  An anniversary message signed by Mao, Lin Piao, and Chou
 En-lai praises the Romanians for their "firm opposition to power
 politics and thrpnts of aggression and for bravely defending
 their national independence and state sovereignty."  In the
 struggle to build their respective countries and oppose imperial-
 ism, the message adds, "the Chinese and Romanian people will,
 as always, sympathize with, help, and support each other."
 Last year's message, also signed by Mao, Lin, and Chou, pledged
 that the Chinese people "will, as always, resolutely support the
 just struggle of the Romanian people."

 NCNA repc::ted that Chou and other high-level Chinese officials
 participated in an anniversrjry celebration hosted by the
 Romanian ambassador on the 23d.  In remarks at the gathering,
 Acting Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fei praised Romania for
 "persisting on its road of independence and displaying the
 revolutionary spirit of self-reliance."  He added, in an
 allusion to the Soviets, that "of late, those who pursue a
 policy of hegemony are again creating tension in the Balkans;
 they have repeatedly carried out military maneuvers, making
 a show of force and bringing pressure to bear on other coun-
 tries, in a wild attempt to achieve their ulterior aims."
 Taking note of the Chinese military delegation now in
 Bucharest, Chi called it another expression of Sino-Romanian
 friendship and added:  "Our Romanian comrades may rest assured
 that in their case of building and defending their motherland,
 the Chinese people . . . will forever remain their reliable
 friends and firmly support their just struggle."
 BACKGROUND      Chinese pledges of support for Romania date
 back to the invasion of Czechoslovakia.  At a
 Romanian embassy reception in Peking on 23 August 1968, Chou
 En-lai wounded ur a bitter condemnation of the Warsaw Five's
 action with the remark that Romania "is now facing the danger
 of foreign intervention and aggression."  Noting that the
 Romanian Government was mobilizing its people to defend the
 country's indepdence, he- Added:

 you."  Chou and other Chinese officials have since made similar
 pledges.  At a Peking rally honoring the Ceausescu delegation
 during its r;icent Asian tour, Chou promised that "the Chinese
 people will fo: ever remain your reliable friends in your
 struggle against imperialist interference and aggression and
 in defense of national independence and state sovereignty
 and in your cause of building socialism.  We firmly support
 your just struggle."
 MOSCOW'S ALLIES DISCOURSE ON CHINESE MANEUVERS IN BALKANS
 Moscow's proxy spokesmen in Eastern Europe have issued further
 pointed warnings against alleged Bucharest efforts to abet.
 Chinese maneuvers in the Balkans.  One such commentary, from
 NEUES DEUTSCHLAND, was picked up in the Soviet weekly ZA RUBEZHOH,
 signed to the press on 18 August and issued on the 20th.
 Entitled "Peking Maneuvers," the commentary stated that "the
 splittist policy of the Chinese leaders must be decisively

 rejected" and added that "the struggle against all forms of
 opportunism and against anti-Sovietism and nationalism remains
 an iuipor t'ont condition for the further advance of socialism."
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA     For the second time in a week, the Slovak
 youth paper SMEN.;. on 17 August directly
 accused Romania of adopting  Q. pro-Peking stance in its foreign
 policy, charging that the Rcmeni.ul party-government delegation's
 Asian trip in June "suited the foreign policy plans of the
 Chinese leadership."  SMENA explained that if Romania were fully
 won over to Peking's policy, the PRC would be able "to intensify
 its attacks against the unity of the countries of the Warsaw
 Pact and CEMA," of which Romania "is still a member"; such a
 gain in Europe would provide the PRC "with a new starting point
 in Europe of far greater significance than the one held by the
 presently isolated Albania."
 SMENA charged that Romania has already shifted its policy to
 the "Chinese platform on several questions," citing as evidence
 the communique is?ued at the conclusion of the Romanian delega-
 tion's visit to Peking and "the course of the visit itself."
 Equating such a shift to "a deviation from the principle of
 proletarian internationalism as it was interpreted and under-
 lined" at the 1969 international communist conference in Moscow,
 SMENA remarked that "it is scarcely possible to avoid the
 question of the realism of such a course."
 Endorsing the conclusions reached at the 2 August Crimea
 meeting, the CPCZ Central Committee Presidium on the 20th
 we:it a step beyond the Crimea communique in warning specifically
 against the sin  of "nationalism"--a warning unequivocally aimed
 at Romania.  According to a Frague radio report, the Presidium
 affirmed that "present world developments bear witness to the
 absolute correctness of the evaluations and conclusions" of the
 1969 international communist conference and "confirm that, in
 the interest of the unified procedure of the forces of world
 communism and the entire anti-imperialist front, it is necessary
 to wage a determined struggle against the manifestations of
 right- and leftwing opportu:..ism, against nationalism and anti-
 Sovietism."  The Crimea communique had called only for a struggle
 against right and left opportunism.

 GDR, HUNGARY      Echoing the warning first leveled in the
 13 August Budapest government daily MAGYAR
 HIRLAP about formation of a Peking-inspired "anti-Soviet
 axis" in the Balkans, East Berlin's second largest daily
 BERLINER ZEITUNG, charged on the 20th that "the recent
 activities of the PRC serve the goal of forging in the
 Balkans a bloc against the socialist countries and its
 center, the Soviet Union."  BERLINER ZEITUNG took a swipe
 at Ceausescu in remarking on the "unpleasant spectacle of
 people who year after year have been tF.lking glibly of inde-
 pendence and sovereignty but who are obviously incapable
 of recognizing how they have become dependent upon Pexing's
 politics."
 Arguing that it was only after the liberation of the Balkans
 by the Soviets in world war II that the Balkan peoples received
 their full sovereignty, BERLINER ZEITUNG also lectured unnamed
 Balkan leaders who would be prepared to assume before their
 peoples "the responsibility for pushing them into a contradic-
 tion with their liberators, helpers, and friends, into an
 anti-Soviet position . . . ,"  In a similar vein, an East
 Berlin radio c,,respondent 's account of the Bucharest liberation
 anniversary celebrations on the 23d pointed to two factors
 Romania must take into account if it is to continue celebrating
 its advancement under socialism:  1) it is possible to remain
 free of imperialist aggression only by attaching oneself closely
 to the USSR, and 2) "all development takes place under complex
 conditions of a severe international class struggle," which make;
 unity of the socialist community both "logical and necessary."
 Picking up the theme of international class struggle, the
 Hungarian trade union organ NEPSZAVA on the 21st rejected the
 "bourgeois and nonbourgeois" idea of an "independent bloc"
 of small countries in a broadside against theses expounded
 variously by Peking, Bucharest, and Belgrade.   "Those who
 preach "the solidarity of small countries' without any consid-
 eration of the class view and class interest," it said, "are
 only trying to cover up their real intentiod'to lessen the
 class struggle and do not "realistically" understand the inter-
 nat-ional role of small countries.  Noting that attempts to
 develop a separate platform for small countries reflect 11
 great-power policy or an ambition for extreme national isola-
 tion, NEPSZAVA went on to assert that "those who insist on
 an 'autonomous and independent role' for small countries" are
 in fact speaking up against these countries, not for them.

 SINO-SOVIET  RELATIONS
 PRAVDA ARTICLE ATTACKS PEKING'S "COLLUSION '11TH IMPERIALISM"
 Having previously offered an authoritative assessment of the
 implications for Soviet-U.S. relations of President Nixon's
 projected visit to the PRC, Moscow has sought to put recent
 developments affecting the triangular relationship in a
 long-term perspective of Sino-Soviet relations.  A 20 August
 PRAVDA article by S. Tikhvinskiy, an original member of the
 Soviet negotiating team at the Peking border talks, explains
 how a reduction in China's ties with the Soviet Union has
 historically led to "collusion with imperialism" and betrayal
 of Chinese national interests.  Using a favorite device for
 Soviet comment discrediting Peking in the wake of its
 invitation to the President, Tikhvinskiy's article is
 ostensibly a review of a book by 0. B. Borisov and
 B. T. Koloskov on the past 25 years of Sino-Soviet
 relations.
 While not addressed directly to recent Sino-U.S. developments,
 the article seems to complement the 10 August PRAVDA article
 by G. Arbatov which viewed President Nixon's plan to visit
 Peking in the context of Soviet-U.S. relations.  Arbatov,
 like Tikhvinskiy an academician with access to the party
 daily for significant comment on major issues, is a specialist
 on the United States.  Tikhvinskiy, a sinologist, has long
 been concerned with Chinese affairs.  On 15 February 1970,
 at a time when Moscow was expressing concern over the
 development of the border talks, Tikhvinskiy authored a
 PRAVDA article which discussed Sino-Soviet relations in
 terms of the triangular relationship, taking special note
 of suggestions to Peking to turn to the United States
 as a counterweight to the Soviets.
 The current Tikhvinskiy article is notable for its several
 references to the sensitive subject of Sino-Soviet border
 troubles--a subject which had been treated delicately in
 conciliatory Soviet comment on the occasion of the CCP's
 50th anniversary on 1 July, before the announcement on
 Peking's invitation to President Nixon.  In addition to
 citing various periods of border troubles, including the
 incidents in 1969, the article contains a passage on the
 PRC's expenditure of "enormous" funds on "total

 milituri%ation," one aspect of which hus been "the erection
 of fortifications along the whole length of the border" with
 the USSR.  Citing Chou En-lai's recent interview with James
 Heston of the New York TIMES as showing that Peking has taken
 up "U.S. propaganda" on a Soviet threat to China, the article
 claims that this anti-Soviet stew serves the Chinese loaders'
 purpose of "Justifying their flirtution with the imperialist
 powers."  At another point, marking 1960 as the beginning of
 Peking's "great-power, chauvinist" approach, the article
 says the Chinese began border provocations and advanced
 territorial claims against the USSR that summer in order
 to prepare a turnabout in foreign affairs toward "close
 cooperation with the imperialist powers."
 The appearance of a new article by Tikhvinskiy, in view of
 his past association with tl`e border talks and his February
 1970 artic-e on the triangular dimensions of the China
 problem, suggests a toughening of Moscow's approach to
 Sino-Soviet relations following the announcement on
 President Nixon's v4sit to the PRC.  A major PRAVDA article
 marking the CCP's 50th anniversary on 1 July, carried over
 the authoritative signature of I. Aleksandrov,* took a
 notably conciliatory line in putting on record for the
 first time a Soviet willingness to negotiate a comprehensive
 new border treaty with the Chinese and in blunting the
 edges of Moscow's thrusts against Peking.  Regarding border
 tensions, for example, the Aleksandrov article limited itself
 to an implicit historical parallel in recalling that Chiang
 Kai-shek had developed an anti-Soviet campaign accompanied
 by armed provocations along the border.  The 20 August
 Tikhvinskiy article, in contrast, is explicit in bringing
 up the border troubles of two years ago as "continuing the
 inglorious traditions of the Chinese militarists" in the
 period before the establishment of the PRC.
 At the same time, the Tikhvinskiy article reaffirms Moscow's
 line, as enunciated at the 24th CPSU Congress, calling for
 normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.  The article seems
 designed to serve Moscow's current campaign of discrediting
 Peking in the international community; as such, it appears
 aimed at isolating Peking rather than signaling a major shift
 in Moscow's line on bilateral relations.
 *  The Aleksandrov article is discussed in the TRENDS of
 8 July 1971, pages 16-21.

 Thus, it places complete responsibility for the present state
 of those relations on "Mao Tse-tung and his circle," citing
 in this connection "numerous letters" from Chinese expressing
 their friendship for the Soviet Union despite the anti-Soviet
 atmosphere in China.  It also attempts to capitalize on the
 strained relations between Hanoi and Peking in the wake of
 the announcement on President Nixon's visit.  In a passage
 on the 1966-69 period of the cultural revolution, the article
 resurrects the charge of Red Guard hostility directed against
 crews of Soviet ships and aircraft "transporting vitally
 important cargoes to fighting Vietnam."

 CH I N A UN  SEAT
 PEKING RULES OUT TWO-CHINAS FORMULA FOR UN REPRESENTATION
 Peking has officially put on record its firm rejection of any
 dual representation formula for seating the PRC in the United
 Nations without expelling the ROC.  Reacting to U.S. Ambassador
 Bush's formal request on 17 August for inclusion of an item on
 China's representation on the agenda for the coming General
 Assembly session, a 20 August PRC Foreign Ministry statement
 declares categorically that the PRC "will absolutely have
 nothing to do with the United Nations" unless  Chiang Kai-shek's
 representatives are expelled.   In thus reaffirming its
 long-standing opposition to dual representation, Peking has
 served notice on the international community that it is not
 agreeable to a compromise on this issue and that its recent
 diplomatic flexibility does not indicate any relaxation of its
 claim to Taiwan.
 The foreign ministry statement and a companion NCNA report on
 the 20th are confined to the narrow issue of UN representation,
 limiting comment on the Nixon Administration's policies to its
 "scheme of creating 'two Chinas' in the United Nations."  The
 only comment appearing in PRC media on broader issues affecting
 Sino-U.S. relations is contained in supporting statements from
 its allies.
 Peking on the 20th disseminated the full texts of a 15 July
 letter to U Thant from Albania, Algeria, and 16 other UN
 members, an explanatory memorandum from these same naticis,
 and their draft resolution "for the restoration of the lawful
 rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations."
 On 17 Ju..j, Peking had begun its publicity for documents
 relating to the China representation question by first carrying
 the draft resolution of Albania and Algeria.  The PRC statement
 and the related documents have been given wide international
 dissemination by Peking; the texts of U.S. documents--Secretary
 Rogers' 2 August statement and Ambassador Bush's 17 August
 letter and memorandum to U Thant--have been carried only in
 NCNA's domestic service, on 4 and 20 August respectively.
 The PRC statement reaffirms the fundamentals of Peking's
 position on the China representation question, insisting that
 "restoration of the legitimate rights" of the PRC in the United

 Nations and expulsion of the ROC are "-two inseparable aspects
 of the same question."  Declaring that the PRC's position is
 "unshakable," the statement indicates that Peking is prepared
 to take the long view by expressing confidence that the
 demands advanced in the Albanian-Algerian resolution "will
 eventually be victorious."
 Without commenting on the question of the Chinese seat in the
 Security Council, the statement takes note briefly of the
 passage in the 15 July draft resolution calling the PRC
 "one of the five permanent members" of that body.  Until
 recently, explicit reverences to a Security Council seat for
 the PRC have been rare in authoritative Peking propaganda,
 although reportage on last year's General Assembly debate on
 the representation issue had noted that both the French and
 Algerian delegates mentioned permanent membership of the
 Chinese in the Security Council.
 In apparent anticipation of the introduction of a passage on
 the Security Council in the 15 July draft resolution,* the
 9 June communique between the PRC and Romania.--one of the
 cosponsors of the resolution--noted that the Romanian side
 reaffirmed its support for the restoration of the legitimate
 rights of the PRC in the United Nations, the Security Council,
 and other international organizations.  Subsequent references
 to a Security Council seat appeared on 2 July, in the
 communique of the China-Japan Friendship Association and a
 visiting delegation of the opposition Komeito Party of Japan,
 and in the 1 August communique following the visit of a high-
 level Algerian delegation to the PRC.
 FOREIGN SUPPORT      Peking has followed up its statement with
 supporting comment from such allies as
 Albania, the DPRK, the DRV;*and Sihanouk's government.  An
 editorial in the Albanian party paper ZERI I POPULLIT on
 24 August, disseminated by NCNA internationally, is notable
 for its discussion of the UN representation question in the
 broader context of Peking's rivalry with the United States and
 the Soviet Union.  Going far beyond what Peking has been willing

 characterizing the PRC as one of the permanent members of the
 Security Council.

 to say in its own naive, the editorial claims that the Nixon
 Administration's policy on the representation question is
 rooted in "the counterrevolutionary global strategy of U.S.
 imperialism," which has "incessantly hatched all kinds of
 plots" and committed "a series of provocations" against China.
 The editorial aleo claims that seating of the PRC in the
 United Nations would be an important step toward "the
 liberation of this organization from the domination of the
 two imperialist superpowers."

 Algerian draft resolution is noteworthy for its characterization
 of the PRC as "a great nuclear and space power" which cannot
 be excluded from decisions on important internatiorle.l problems.
 Peking has long sought to dissociate itself from the ranks of
 the "superpowers."  In this vein, the 30 July PRC Government
 statement--released on 7 August--rejecting the Soviet proposal
 for a five-power nuclear conference had asserted that Chinese
 nuclear weapons are still in the "experimental" stage and
 declared that the PRC will never be "a 'nuclear superpower'
 practicing the policies of nuclear monopoly, nuclear threats,
 and nuclear blackmail."
 USSR REPORTS DEVELOPMENTS. REAFFIRMS SUPPORT FOR PRC SEAT
 Having reaffirmed its support for the seating of the PRC in
 the United Nations in a 13 July letter to U Thant,* Moscow has
 given low-keyed propaganda attention to the representation issue
 over the past month.  TASS dispatches have briefly reported
 Secretary Rogers' 2 August statement and Ambassador Bush's
 17 August letter to U Thant.  TASS also promptly reported NCNA's
 4 August criticism of the Rogers statement and the PRC Foreign
 Ministry statement of 20 August.  While these dispatches have
 underscored Peking's public rejection of a two-Chinas policy,
 the one reporting NCNA's criticism of the Rogers statement noted
 a New York TIMES observation that "behind the cover of tough
 polemics and propaganda" on the membership issue, "the Chinese
 leaders are formulating a flexible policy for their meeting with
 President Nixon."

 A Moscow broadcast in Mandarin on 19 August cited the Bush letter
 to U Thant as evidence that Washington is still pursuing a
 two-Chine- policy.  Since Washington and Peking are drawing
 closer to each other, the commentary added, the Nixon Administration
 "has agreed to vote for the seating of the PRC in the United Nations
 in an attempt to use this concession to the Chinese leaders in
 exchange for a Chinese concession which will benefit "-he United
 States."  The commentary concluded that the USSR, for its part,
 has consistently opposed a two-Chinas policy and stands for the
 restoration to the PRC of its "legitimate rights" in the world
 body and expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek delegation.

 MIDDLE  EAST
 SOVIET MEDIA MARK TIME ON MIDEAST-ISSUE'. ARAB'DEVELOPMENTS
 Soviet media have paid little attention to recent Middle East
 developments affecting inter-Arab and Arab-Soviet relations
 and the Arab-Israeli conflict.  Moscow's limited comment on
 the Arab scene comes against the background c..: the. strained
 Soviet-Sudanese relations in the wake of the Sudanese coup and
 countercoup that-led to the executions of local communists, as'
 well as the inter-Arab tensions generated by Jordan's moves
 to control the fedayeen and the related Syrian rupture of
 diplomatic ties with Jordan.  On the Arab-Israeli front,
 Moscow played Assistant Secretary Sisco's late July-early
 August talks in Israel in low key, routinely predicting negative
 results.  Moscow may well be awaiting the fall session of the UN
 General Assembly before mounting any appreciable new propaganda
 efforts with respect to the Middle East problem.
 MIDEAST       Sisco's visit drew predictably disparaging Moscow
 CONFLICT      comment which again decried U.S. efforts to act as
 peacemaker and insisted that U.S. arms deliveries
 to Israel demonstrate Washington's "hypocrisy" in claiming to
 play a disinterested role and its unwillingness to pressure the
 Israelis.  But while denouncing U.S. attempts to act as
 "mediator," Moscow gives no clue as to any initiatives it might
 be contemplating at the UNGA session.  Only once in the past
 several months has Moscow even broached the problems encountered
 in the continuing Big Four talks in New York, which Primakov in
 an early May Arabic-language interview had called the "main
 effort" being made in connection with the Mideast problem.  This
 isolated complaint about the U.S. stance in the talks came in a
 Kolesnichenko PRAVDA dispatch on 31 July which charged that U.S.
 Ambassador Bush, "contrary to common sense," was insisting on
 "discussions of 'peace guarantees'" in the Middle East which,
 without Israeli withdrawal, would amount to continuation of the
 occupation.  Normally, TASS briefly reports the fact that a
 four-power session was held; the most recent such item, on
 27 July, noted that the next meeting was scheduled for 19 August.
 The last Soviet propaganda complaint spelling out Washington's
 "negative stand" in the talks was an.IZVESTIYA dispatch in
 mid-March.

 Broadly, the Soviet position continues to be that the USSR is
 ready to participate with the other permanent members of the
 Security Council in creating "international guarantees" for a
 Middle East political settlement.  This idea, advanced at the
 elite level by Brezhnev in his 30 March CPSU Congress report,*
 was reiterated in Gromyko's 13 July letter to U Thant which
 recapitulated a broad range of Soviet policy positions.  Moscow
 did not mention the Egyptian interpretation of Soviet readiness
 to participate in an "international force," rather than
 "international guarantees."  The Cairo AL-AHRAM on 22 July,
 reporting that Soviet Ambassador Vinosradov had' informed.UAR
 Foreign Minister Riyad about the Gromyko letter, said that it
 "expressed the Soviet Union's readiness to participate . .  . in
 an international force" to safeguard international security.
 Earlier, AL-AHRAM editor Haykal in a 25 June article had
 claimed that Riyad had been informed by Gromyko in December
 1970 of the USSR's readiness to participate in an "international
 force to guarantee" a Middle East settlement based on Security
 Council Resolution 242.  Soviet proposals on a Mideast settle-
 ment have suggested the stationing of "UN troops" at various
 points, but have not dealt with their composition.
 RELATIONS WITH     Moscow's protest campaign against the
 SUDAN, SYRIA       persecution of communists in Sudan wound
 down on 10 August, and Soviet media have
 since been silent on the status of USSR-Sudan relations and
 events in Khartoum.  There has been no suggestion that Moscow
 either sought or accepted any Arab mediation.  Soviet media
 thus ignored the fact that a Syrian delegation, after an
 unheralded 10-11 August visit to Moscow, went directly to
 Khartoum for talks on the 11th and 12th.  For its part, Sudan
 has rejected mediation:  Sudanese Chairman an-Numayri declared,
 according to a MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY report on the 12th,
 that the Syrians' discussions in Khartoum could not be regarded
 as mediation between the Sudan and the USSR, and Sudanese
 Defense Minister 'Abbas said on the 24th that the Soviet Union
 must take the initiative to correct its mistake, for Sudan
 "would never be a party" to mediation.
 Soviet media gave virtually no publicity to the two-day
 visit of the Syrian delegation, composed of Vice President
 al-Ayyubi and Foreign Minister Khaddam, reporting neither its

 arrival nor its departure.                                     According to a MENA dispatch on the
 12th attributed to "reliable sources in Khartoum," the Syrian
 visit to Moscow took place after consult4tions between the
 Soviet ambassador and his government following the ambassador's
 several meetings with senior Syrian officials "at the beginning
 of the week."  TASS on the 11th both announced and summed up the
 visit in a report--also carried by Damascus radio, which
 described it as a "press statement"--noting that the Syrians
 had talks "in an atmosphere of friendship and frankness" with
 Mazurov, Ponomarev, and Kuznetsov on bilateral relations and
 "the Middle East situation."  A 12 August Arabic-language
 commentary on the visit blandly described such contacts as a
 "good tradition" in Syrian-Soviet x2.ations and went on to
 underscore the mutual benefits  accruing from the two countries'
 economic cooperation.  An Arabic-language report two days
 later did obliquely link the Syrians with Soviet-Sudanese
 relations in observing that Syrian President al-Asad in a
 speech in southern Syria had "firmly rejected" the idea that
 there had been "any Soviet intervention in recent events in
 Sudan."
 ARAB FEDERATION,      Moscow has given meager publicity to the
 JORDANIAN ISSUES      18-20 August meeting in Damascus of UAR
 and Syrian Presidents as-Sadat and al-Asad
 and Libyan Chairman al-Qadhdhafi.  TASS merely noted that they
 would discuss questions connected with the Federation of Arab
 Republics (FAR) established last April as well as "other
 problems."*  TASS also reported the signing on the 20th of the
 FAR draft constitution and a joint declaration, and later
 briefly summed up the constitution, pointing out among other
 things that the federation is open to other Arab states if
 they agree with its principles and strive for Arab unity and
 the establishment of an Arab socialist society.  But there
 has been no Soviet account of the substance of the declaration,
 which repeated the "no's" of the 17 April Benghazi declaration
 on establishment of the FAR:  no conciliation and no negotiations
 with the "Zionist enemy," no relinquishment of an inch of
 occupied Arab territory, and no bargaining over the Palestinian
 issue.**
 *   According to Cairo's AL-JUMHURIYAH on the 12th, the Syrian-
 Soviet talks in Moscow would be on the agenda, and AL-AHRAM on the
 15th said Jordanian relations with the fedayeen and with Syria
 would be a topic of discussion.

 Seemingly having in mind Jordanian relations with the fedayeen
 and with Syria, a Moscow commentary in Arabic on the 20th, pegged
 to the Damascus conference, made the customary charges of
 imperialist attempts to disrupt Arab unity by exp^_erbatint
 any misunderstanding which may arise" between Arab countries
 and by endeavoring, in Jordan and Lebanon, to "separate the
 fedayeen from the masses."  Similarly, a Yermakov international
 review in PRAVDA on the 22d included Jordanian operations
 against the fedayeen as a factor in the "more acute" situation,
 along with the standard "imperialist intrigues" and Israeli
 policy.  TASS had briefly noted clashes on the Jordanian-Syrian
 border and Syria's 12 August rupture of diplomatic relations
 with Jordan--explained by Damascus, TASS added, as due to the
 Jordanian authorities' disregard of Arab efforts aimed at
 mobilization of all forces against Israel.
 Moscow failed to mention the arrival of a Soviet military
 delegation in Syria on the heels of the break in Syrian-
 Jordanian relations.  According to Damascus radio on the 17th,
 the Soviet delegation and a visiting UAR military delegation
 joined President al-Asad in observing "the largest army exercises

 Syria.

 them off in a brief report on the 22d that the Egyptian
 president had returned to Cairo from Saudi Arabia and Sudan
 where he had "conducted talks with the leaders of those
 countries."

 BOLIVIA
 While Soviet media have typically devoted negligible attention
 to the 19-22 August coup in Bolivia that ousted leftist President
 Gen. Juan Jose Torres, Havana has been vocal from the outset
 in expressing support for the Bolivian "people" against the
 "counterrevolutionary" plotters.  In an interview in Santiago,
 Chile on the 21st, Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa saw the
 events in La Paz as "an American bat4-le, not exclusively
 Bolivia's."  Havana propaganda has pictured the coup in these
 terms, charging that the Bolivian "reactionaries" had backing
 from the United States, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina and
 quoting Chilean and Pexuvian spokesmen on the need to defend
 their gains against "reaction" and "counterrevolution."
 By the 24th, authoritative Cuban comment was drawing doctrinal
 morals from the Bolivian experience, picturing it in the
 context of a continent-wide struggle in which the balance
 is being weighted increasingly on the side of revolution.
 In militant passages carrying echoes of Cuban propaganda
 in the early 1960's, an !ditorial in the party organ GRANMA
 pronounced it the "duty" of all Latin American revolutionaries
 to "help the Bolivian people regain their revolutionary
 posture" and assured the Bolivians of Cuba's "material" as
 well as moral support.
 HAVANA VIEWS BOLIVIAN "SETBACK" AS PREDICTABLE BUT REVERSIBLE
 The notion that any Latin American regime moving in a
 revolutionary direction faces the constant threat of a coup
 from the right has long been a staple of Cuban propaganda,
 as part and parcel of the dictum that armed struggle is the
 only sure route to revolutionary power.  Against this
 background, Havana now calls the Bolivian coup "expected"
 and "inevitable" but views it as a temporary "setback" and
 holds it up as an object lesson for revolutionaries throughout
 the hemisphere.  In line with Castro's portrayal of a growing
 revolutionary trend in Latin America, a Havana radio talk on
 23 August saw the three days of "bloody battle" in La Paz as
 proof that it is becoming "increasingly difficult for the
 fascist military to stage a bloodless coup."  And GRANMA's
 24 ,:gust editorial spelled out the doctrinal lesson:  The
 Bolivian people's experience has demonstrated "the possibilities

 25 AUGUST 1971
 of armed action, not only in the rural areas but also in the
 cities, when all methods of struggle are combined intelligently
 and firmly."
 GRANMA depicted the revolutionary trend as inexorable and
 bound to reassert itself with greater force.  It praised
 the Bolivian people for having "written a heroic page in
 the book of Latin American history"--a new round in a
 continuous revolutionary struggle of which Che Guevara's
 abortive guerrilla venture had been the first major
 battle, foredoomed as Guevara's guerrillas were by over-
 whelming military odds against it.
 GRANMA's explanation that the forces of the people were
 defeated by their "overwhelming disadvantage in weaponry"
 was developed after the fact, as a rationale for the failure
 of a resistance movement Havana media had portrayed in
 optimistic terms during the period of the coup.  On 20 August,
 for example, Havana spoke of a "battle for liberation" being
 waged heroically by "the people," the peasants, students,
 miners, workers of the Labor Central (COB), noncommissioned
 military officers, and the La Paz Colorados regiment
 commanded by Maj. Ruben Sanchez, described as "strongly
 revoi'itionaxy" with "strong connections to the popular
 sectors."  Havana broadcasts publicized messages of
 solidarity with the Bolivian "people" from Cuban mass
 organizations as well as from Chilean political and labor
 groups, and Foreign Minister Roa recalled in his interview
 in Chile on the 21st that the Cuban Government had more
 than once expressed "its strongest solidarity and support
 for the revolutionary movement" in Bolivia.
 Castro had been moving cautiously toward endorsement of the
 Torres government in the months preceding the coup,
 discerning on 26 July "a profound radicalization of the
 Bclivian people" and "proper conditions for a revolution"
 but making support for Torres conditional on his revolutionary
 actions.*  While the coup was in progress PRENSA LATINA quoted

 the Chilean CP organ PURO                        CIIILE as remarking that a victory
 of the "fascists," if It materialized, "would be the
 consequence of vacillations," although in reporting a
 Bolivian COB communique it left out the more direct charge
 that the plotters were able to use part of the state':
 resources because of "General Torres government's indecision
 and swaying from right to left."
 The perpetrators of the coup were identified as the "fascists"
 of the Bolivian Socialist Falange and the National Revolu-
 tionary Movement along with their "servants" within the
 armed forces.  Havana's initial reaction to the new regime,
 headed by Col. Hugo Banzer Suarez, was to depict a curfew
 and martial law decree as the first step in a "violent
 repression" which the junta might "unleash at any moment."
 On the 24th, the GRANMA editorial said a reign of "terror
 and revenge" had begun, with "armed rightist commandos
 attacking the headquarters of the leftist parties and the
 offices of labor unions and progressive newspapers."  GRANMA
 said there had never before in Bolivia's history been a
 regime "more illegitimate, more antipeople, more antinational,"
 but saw grounds in its internal disunity and absence of
 popular backing for the judgment that it cannot last.
 REASSERTION OF CUBAN ROLE IN HEMISPHERE-WIDE CONFRONTATION
 Charges that the coupists enjoyed "backing from abroad" were
 present in Cuban propaganda from the outset.  A broadcast on
 the 19th cited a La Paz EL DIARIO report that the U.S.
 embassy had alerted its staff to a possible coup "that
 would occur at any moment," and PRENSA LATINA recalled
 the reported alert on the 23d to conclude that there was
 "no doubt about U.S. involvement."  On the 21st PRENSA LATINA
 alleged that 8,000 men trained in Argentina, Paraguay, and
 Brazil were fighting the pro-regime forces in Bolivia.
 Havana radio predicted the next day that there would be
 "an intervention by the Brazilian and Paraguayan regimes
 supported by the United States"; and subsequent comment
 focused on Brazilian military aspirations to get rid of
 the "too leftist" Torres and to separate the oil-rich
 department of Santa Cruz from Bolivia "as a first step
 toward its absorption by Brazil."

 GRANMA's 211 August editorial drew the threads of this comment
 together in ascribing the success of the "bloodbath" against
 the Bolivian people to a "triple counterrevolutionary alliance"
 consisting of internal reaction and the Brazilian and Paraguayan
 "gorilla" regimes, masterminded by the United States.   "Plotted
 by the imperialists and executed by the CIA," GRANMA said, the
 coup was part of an overall strategy designed to isolate Cuba,
 Chile, and Peru and to "discourage peoples which, as in Uruguay,
 are seriously threatening to sweep the representatives of
 oligarchy and imperialism from power."
 Thus underscoring Castro's portrayal of a burgeoning revolutionary
 situation in which Cuba is no longer isolated, the editorial
 played the theme of Cuban-Bolivian affinity rooted in Guevara's
 guerrilla adventure and noted that some Bolivian labor leaders
 who had been in Cuba for the 26 July observance were now
 victims of the fighting.  It held up a pledge of "Cuba's
 solidarity, her firm moral and material support, resolute
 and determined," for the Bolivian "struggle for liberation"
 as exemplary for all revolutionaries confronting "fascism and
 imperialism" in Latin America.

 DPRK HOPES RED CROSS CONTACTS WILL PAVE WAY FOR UNIFICATION
 Expressions of good will and professions of optimism about the
 prospects for Korean unification mark North Korean coverage
 of the 20 August Panmunjom meeting of relresentatives of the
 North and South Korean Red Cross organizv.tions to exchange
 documents containing their respective proposals on contacts
 among families separated by the division of the country.  The
 meeting stemmed from an exchange earlier in the month in which
 the North Korean society, on the 14th, had responded to a
 12 August proposal by its South Korean counterpart that .a
 "movement" to locate separated family members be initiated..
 The North Koreans proposed that discussions also be held on
 questions of free travel, mutual visits, and free correspondence
 among separated family members, relatives,.and friends.'  The
 seven-point demand on U.S. withdrawal from South Korea, which
 included the demand that the United States stop preventing
 civilian travel across the military demarcation line, was first
 put forward by the DPRK representative at the 29 July meeting
 of the Military Armistice Ccmmission (MAC); it was repeated at
 the 25 August MAC meeting, according to a Pyongyang domestic
 service report that day.
 KCNA's prompt account of the 20 August meeting was followed
 up with reportage accompanied by comment in NODONG SINMUN the
 next day.  KCNA reported that the messengers at Panmunjom "met
 each other with gladness, firmly shaking hands with warm
 feelings and compatriotic love," and expressed the hope that
 the meeting will "mark an important occasion" in demolishing
 barriers between North and South and "pave the way" for
 negotiations and ultimate unification of the country.  NODONG
 SINMUN's report, while also noting that the meeting took place
 in "a warm atmosphere of compatriotic love," included some
 criticism of the South Korean side.  It claimed that the South
 Korean journalists covering the Panmunjom meeting was forbidden
 to appear until the very last moment because the "South Korean
 rulers" feared their contact with North Korean correspondents.
 *  See the 18 August TRENDS, pages 27-32, for a discussion of
 this exchange.  Earlier North Korean proposals regarding North-
 South contacts are discussed in the 11 August TRENDS, pages

 It also took the occasion to criticize the "South Korean puppet
 clique" for having previously rejected all the DPRK's "fair and
 reasonable" proposals on North-South contacts.  But the paper
 went on to praise this initial contact as a "good and glad
 thing," the first fruition of North Korea's "sincere efforts"
 to bring about North-South contacts.
 KCNA on 20 August carried a statement by the North Korean Red
 Cross chairman praising the exchange and expressing the hope
 that this first contact will help open the way toward peaceful
 unification.  On the 23d Pyongyang reported a statement by a
 spokesman of the DPRK Red Cross announcing that it will send
 messengers to Panmunjom on the 26th to receive the South Korean
 reply to North Korea's 14 August proposal.
 KOREANS IN JAPAN      Pyongyang continues to publicize activities
 of the DPRK-sponsored General Association
 of Korean Residents in Japan in connection with the North-South
 contacts.  On 22 August KCNA carried a statement by the chairman
 of the association supporting the Panmunjom meeting; KCNA
 reported on the 20th that members of the ROK-sponsored Korean
 Residents Union in Japan had also praised the meeting.  On the
 19th, KCNA reported a letter from the chairman of the DPRK-
 sponsored organization to the head of the ROK-sponsored group
 proposing meetings of Koreans in Japan to support the North-South
 talks.  It proposed meetings in Tokyo, Osaka, and other cities
 under the joint auspices of the two organizations, formati'on'-
 of a preparatory committee to plan these meetings, and the
 initiation of "day-to-day contact" regarding these matters.
 The DPRK-sponsored organization had previously involved itself
 in the recent attention to the subject of North-South c,,.,tacts.
 On 18 August KCNA had reported a statement by the association's
 chairman offering to send representatives to a third-country
 conference of overseas Koreans for reunification.  The DPRK
 Committee for the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland had
 agreed to such a conference in an 11 August letter to Ko Pyong-chol,
 president of the United Front for Korean Democracy in New York.
 On the 14th KCNA had reported that the DPRK-sponsored organization
 in Japan had proposed to its counterpart that they iointly
 celebrate the Korean liberation anniversary and promote a struggle
 for Korean unification.

 SZECHWAN     Chang Kuo-hua, a seasoned PLA commander and long-
 time leader in Tibet before his cultural revolution
 transfer to Szechwan, was named first secretary.  Chang, who is
 also chairman of the revolutionary committee and political
 commissar of the Chengtu Military Region (MR), ended a 10-month
 eclipse from public view on 10 August when he reappeared in
 Chengtu, identified as a member of the provincial CCP core
 group.
 Chang's political survival has clearly been at the expense of
 the leftist forces within the province.  In mid-March 1968
 Chang was criticized by Chiang Ching for ailcwing conservative
 attacks on Liu Chieh-ting and Chang Hsi-ting, vice-chairmen
 of the provincial revolutionary committee, who were aligned
 with radical Red Guard forces within Szechwan.  Significantly,
 neither Liu nor Chang was named to the new committee; neither
 has appeared publicly since May 1970.
 Most of Chang's deputies on the new committee have served
 under him in Szechwan throughout the cultural revolution.
 Liang Hsing-chu, a vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee
 and commander of the Chengtu MR, was named second secretary.
 Li Ta-chang, who served as governor of Szechwan immediately
 prior to the cultural revolution, has been a vice-chairman
 of the revolutionary committee since its inception.  Hsieh
 Chia-hsiang is a deputy political commissar of the Chengtu
 MR and a standing committee member of the revolutionary
 committee.  Tuan Chun-yi, a newcomer to the Szechwan power
 structure, has presumably been rehabilitated fallowing his

 cultural revolution fall from his post as chief of the Fir.t
 Ministry of Machine Building.  His career has been primarily
 that of a technical manager, and he may supply skills needed
 in the Szechwan leadership.  Hsieh Cheng-jung and Ho Yun-feng
 hold military responsibilities within the province.  Hsu Chih
 is a long-time vice-chairman of the revolutionary committee,
 perhaps also formerly a leading government cadre in Peking.
 Reflecting the political troubles which have long plagued
 Szechwan, NCNA praised "the people of the province" for
 uniting with the PLA and warding off "the interference from
 the 'left' and the 'right'" through "sharp class battles."
 Szechwan's provincial radio, which had been limited to
 relaying Radio Peking since 19 November 1969, resumed local
 news originations on 3 August.
 The new party committee, consisting of 106 full and 44
 alternate members, is more numerous by far than that for
 any other province;  Shantung's   the next largest, consists
 of 115 members and alternates.  A total of 1,477 delegates
 attended the congress (only Shantung's was larger) in
 Chengtu from 12 to 16 August.
 TIBET      The formation of the new Tibetan committee has
 provided final confirmation of the political demise
 of Revolutionary Committee Chairman Tseng Yung-ya, who has
 not appeared publicly since National Day 1970 and was
 apparently demoted because of his support of the radical
 "Lhasa Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters" group during the
 cultural revolution.  Jen Jung, who supported the
 conservative "Great Alliance Headquarters" during the
 cultural revolution, was named first secretary.  Jen, who
 has been first political commissar in Tibet since October
 1968, had been named acting chairman of the revolutionary
 committee in a 12 June NCNA report on a local activist
 congress.
 Six secretaries were named.  Chen Ming-yi, a vice-chairman,
 was recently named PLA commander in Tibet.  Kao Sheng-hsuan
 and Feng Ko-ta are newcombers to the province.  Kao was
 identified last April as PLA deputy commander in Tibet; no
 identification is available for Feng.  In an apparent
 effort to highlight the position of minorities in the PRC,
 NCNA specifies that three of the secretaries are native
 Tibetans:  Yang Tung-sheng, Pa Sang and Tien Pao.  All have

 been vice-chairmen of the revolutionary committee since its
 formation.  Tien Pao is also a political commissar and
 probably the only one of the native Tibetans with any real
 power.
 The 56 full and i6 alternate members on the committee were
 selected at a party congress held in Lhasa from 7 to 12 August.
 Jen':3 remarks to the congress, in line with keynote addresses
 given in other border provinces, stressed the need to strengthen
 frontier defenses against "imperialism, social-imperialism and
 Indian expansionism."  Jen also took the opportunity to lash
 out at "the counterrevolutionary crimes of the Dalai-Panchen
 traitorous clique."
 RED FLAG SIGNALS AN END TO DEARTH OF READING MATERIALS
 Breaking anew with cultural revolution practice, an article
 in RED FLAG No. 9 has called on writers and publishing
 houses to produce "popular reading material" on a variety
 of subjects.  Implicitly acknowledging that recent years
 have seen a surfeit of "popular political literature"--
 writings by and about Mao--the article indicates that the
 time has come to produce reading materials "on literature
 and art, science and technology, history, geography,
 international events, and so forth."
 The easing of cultural revolution strictures in regard to
 literature had been indicated earlier when several
 provincial radio broadcasts observed that old books
 could be utilized, albeit critically, in schools.  Also,
 Peking observers recently reported that a novel was being
 sold in the city's bookstores for the first time since
 the start of the cultural revolution.
 The RED FLAG article pulls few punches in noting the problems
 that will be encountered in reviving Chinese literature.
 It even indicates that one reason for the current revival
 is that if revolutionary books are not produced, particularly
 of the popular types "urgently demanded," then "bad books will
 poison the masses and youth."  Opposition to creating new
 materials is said to come from those who believe that creation
 of popular literature should be low in priority as well as
 from class enemies seeking to poison the minds of youth.
 Also,"some comrades" obviously still fear that-harm will come

 from turning out new and original works:  "They have held that
 publishing reading material on knowledge is wrong, and they
 have not dared to compile books in this respect."  Such
 muddled ideas are of course not at all in crnformity with
 Mao's teachings, RED FLAG asserts.
 It is suggested that the new works be produced by three-'.n-one
 creative groups of cadres, worker-peasant-soldier writers,
 and professional personnel.  This sharing of responsibility
 may be designed to ease the fears of intellectuals wary of
 authoring original works.  In the same vein, the article
 admits that "at the outset some works may be imprudent or
 even contain certain mistakes, but if their theme: are correct
 we should render active assistance in making then better."
 The article also observes, however, that there is no need to
 worry even "if poisonous weeds appear" because the masses
 "will change them into fertilizer"--possibly too vivid a
 metaphor for the more timorous authors.
