 Rumanian officials have told US representatives that
 Rumania would prefer not to belong to any military bloc.
 One sign of diminishing cooperation with the Soviet

 SOVIET PARTY REORGANIZATION NEARING COMPLETION
 In the process of reuniting party agricultural and in-

 experiment, the new Soviet leaders have gotten rid of
 another of his top farm officials.  Neither the original
 experiment nor the current reorganization has had much

 The problems of protecting the Sino-Soviet border area

 In speeches at the annual National People's Congress

 years of 1959-61 and that considerable popular opposi-

 The UN General Assembly's
 current: recess has provided one
 more reprieve from a showdown over
 the UN's money problems and the
 voting rights of its financially
 delinquent members.   There is,
 however, no sign of any break in
 the deadlock, and the risk of per-
 manent damage to the UN is stead-
 ily increasing.                     Sukarno's threat
 to take Indonesia out of the or-
 ganization has also contributed
 to the deepening malaise.
 The crux of the money prob-
 lem remains the USSR's unwilling-
 ness to state how much of its ar-
 rears it will pay,. and when. The So-
 viets maintain they have already
 made a major concession by agree-
 ing in principle to some form of
 voluntary donation beyond their
 regular assessments.  In return,
 they demand that all claims
 against them for the Congo and
 Middle East operations be can-
 celed and that the assembly re-
 sume normal voting procedures.
 The US insists, on the other hand,
 that this position is in effect
 a Soviet bid to have Article 19
 of the UN Charter suspended. A
 donation of about $17 million is
 required if the USSR is to avoid
 the loss of vote which that ar-
 ticle specifies for financial
 delinquents like the Soviets.
 In refusing to go along with
 Secretary General Thant's face-
 saving plan to set up a "voluntary
 rescue" fund to which the Soviets
 and UN members generally would
 contribute, the USSR may have been
 playing for time in the knowledge
 that France and several other
 countries would fall more than two
 years behind in their dues on 1 Jan-
 uary.   Although a French UN dele-
 gate has said Paris is interested
 in settling the debt issue, France
 has not indicated what it would
 consider a suitable solution.
 The USSR stands to continue
 benefiting from the impatience of
 the Afro-Asians to resume normal
 procedures in the General Assembly.
 An Ethiopian official in New York
 claims that a vast majority of Af-
 ro-Asians are "disgusted" with the
 long postponement.   He added that
 the US is consequently losing Af-
 rican support since even its
 friends fail to understand why "the
 US appears determined to push the
 USSR against a wall."  A number of
 Asians, however, appear to be sym-
 pathetic to the US position.
 Sukarno's decision to leave
 the UN, imprecise as it is, has
 been greeted with widespread dis-
 approval and dismay by many UN mem-
 bers, including some of the more
 radical Africans.   Most of them
 find it difficult to see how with-
 drawal would benefit Indonesia, and
 there are no indications that any
 one will follow Sukarno's lead.  It
 is possible, however, that if In-
 donesia actually pulls out and
 suffers no adverse consequences,
 a precedent will have been set
 for capricious withdrawals in
 the future

 WARSAW PACT MEETING TO CONVENE ON 19 JANUARY
 The Warsaw Pact meeting to
 be held in the Polish capital
 on 19 January is probably a ses-
 sion of the Political Consulta-
 tive Committee, consisting of
 bloc party and government lead-
 ers, which has not met since
 July '1963.   In the past, this
 forum has been used to issue
 foreign policy announcements
 concerning alleged threats to
 the national security interests
 of the member nations.
 The meeting follows a sharp
 step-up in Soviet attacks
 against continuing Western con-
 sultations on the NATO multi-
 lateral nuclear force, high-
 lighted by Soviet Premier Kosy-
 gin's 9 December call for War-
 saw Pact consultations.   It
 seems probable that the sessions
 will result in vague retaliatory
 threats probably linked with
 some new proposals dealing with
 European security.   For example,
 there might be some elaboration
 of Polish Foreign Minister
 Rapacki's 14 December proposal
 that representatives of the War-
 saw and NATO blocs arrange a
 conference of all European states,
 including the Soviet Union and
 adding the US, to discuss Euro-
 pean security.
 The gathering of the War-
 saw Pact signatories will also
 provide the first opportunity
 since early November for bloc
 leaders to review broad policy
 questions such as the Sino-So-
 viet problem.   The role of the
 East European forces within the
 pact structure is likely to come
 under discussion, particularly
 in view of tentative signs that
 Rumania desires to reduce its
 commitment (see next article).
 Moscow may appeal for intensive
 planning and consultation against
 the possibility of nuclear war-
 fare in Europe in the hope that
 this will act as a catalyst for
 greater coordination among the
 Warsaw Pact forces.
 RUMAN]:A MAY BE REDUCING COMMITMENT TO WARSAW PACT
 Rumania's independent posi-
 tion in the Communist world is
 now apparently being reflected
 for the first time in military
 matters, as it already has been
 in economic and political af-
 fairs.   Rumanian officials have
 even been hinting that-Bucharest
 is no longer willing to cooper-
 ate fully with the USSR in bloc
 military activities.
 The pivotal development
 apparently was the Rumanian de-
 cree of 19 December reducing the
 military obligation of most cate-
 gories of conscripts from 24 to
 16 months.   Although the Ruma-
 nian action is consistent with
 Moscow's own facade of military
 economy,  party first secretary
 Gheorghiu-Dej's comments on it
 gave US Ambassador Crawford the

 clear impression that opposition
 to the cut came from foreign
 sources--an implication that the
 move was not approved by the
 Warsaw Pact command.   One ef-
 fect of the cut may be a reduc-
 tion in the Rumanian forces
 available to the Warsaw Pact.
 Dej's comment follows sev-
 eral suggestions of friction in
 Rumanian-Soviet military rela-
 tions.   Rumanian foreign liai-
 son officials told US Embassy
 officials that some Rumanian of-
 ficers boycotted the 7 November
 Soviet Embassy reception in re-
 taliation for the rude behavior
 of Soviet Marshal Grechko,  Com-
 mander in Chief of the Warsaw
 Pact, during his October visit
 to Rumania.

 that,  if Rumania could have its
 way,  it would not subscribe to
 any pact.    Since then, public
 Rumanian commentary has  increas-
 ingly denounced the need for
 military blocs.
 These developments may be
 the harbingers of a slow and
 cautious reduction by Rumania
 of its participation in Warsaw
 Pact activities.   The first
 open indication of Rumanian
 independence vis-a-vis the pact
 may occur at the Warsaw Pact
 meeting scheduled for 19 Janu-
 ary  (see preceding article).
 Premier Maurer says he plans to
 go, but has not said whether
 party first secretary Gheorghiu-
 Dej will accompany him as would
 normally be the case for such
 a meeting.
 The new Soviet leaders
 have taken advantage of their
 current reorganization of the
 party to rid themselves of
 another of Khrushchev's top
 agricultural officials.  Leonid
 Yefremov, who had been Khru-
 shchev's agricultural deputy
 for the Russian Republic  (RSFSR)
 and a candidate member of the
 ruling party presidium, was de-
 moted to first secretary of the
 Stavropol agricultura.lparty com-
 mittee on 1 December.   He stayed
 on as provincial party boss when
 the Stavropol industrial and
 agricultural party organizations
 were reunited later in the month.
 The demotion occurred just two
 weeks after Vasily Polyakov,  the
 central party secretary in
 charge of agriculture, had been
 fired.
 The choice of Stavropol as
 the first stop in Yefremov's
 political decline is especially
 ironic since the Stavropol prov-
 ince had figured in the eclipse
 of another agricultural official
 appointed by Khrushchev--Nikolay

 Belyayev, demoted in 1960 from
 party first secretary of Kazakh-
 stan and expelled from the party
 presidium.   Belyayev stayed in
 Stavropol only six months,  then
 disappeared from public view.
 Fast-rising Aleksandr
 Shelepin, who became a member
 of the presidium in mid-Novem-
 ber, supervised Yefremov's
 transfer.   Yefremov's predeces-
 sor in Stavropol was recalled
 to staff work in Moscow and ap-
 parently suffered no demotion.
 Veteran party secretary
 Suslov supervised the only other
 change of note when he helped
 install Mikhail Solomentsev,
 former second secretary in
 Kazakhstan, as Rostov provin-
 cial party boss.   Solomentsev's
 shift, unlike Yefremov's, ap-
 pears to be a lateral transfer.
 His predecessor was recalled to
 Moscow for reassignment.
 The demotion of Yefremov
 also vacates the second of the
 three top posts in the impor-
 tant Bureau for the RSFSR.  Khru-
 shchev had been chairman and
 Yefremnov his first deputy for
 agriculture.   Andrey Kirilenko,
 the third top official, was
 first deputy for industry.   No
 replacement has been identified
 for either Khrushchev's or
 Yefremov's   post.   Brezhnev
 would undoubtedly like to as-
 sume direct control of the
 bureau and may already have
 done so--changes in the bureau
 are not normally publicly
 announced--but the current em-
 phasis on collective leadership
 might throw the chairman's job
 to someone else.   Kirilenko,
 his close friend, would be a
 logical choice.
 The merger of industrial
 and agricultural party units
 ordered by the central commit-
 tee in November is virtually
 complete.   The record of elec-
 tions to the newly unified party
 bodies shows quite clearly that
 Khrushchev's bifurcation experi-
 ment had little effect on the
 political standing of the 75
 provincial party bosses whose
 bailiwicks were divided two years
 ago.   Over two thirds have re-
 mained as party chieftains in
 the reunified regions.   Most of
 the newcomers had been promoted
 to fill posts made vacant by
 the death, promotion, or lateral
 transfer of the earlier chief.
 In the 1962 reorganization
 the number of incumbent party
 first secretaries assigned to
 the rural half of the divided
 regions was nearly three times
 the number assigned to the in-
 dustrial half.   The same ratio
 has prevailed in the reversal.
 Clearly the nature of the eco-
 nomic problems of the area
 rather than political considera-
 tions determined the emphasis
 on industry or agriculture,
 both in the original bifurcation
 and in the reunification.

 Guards have been given greater
 air strength, particularly heli-
 copters,                          and now have their own

 would be in line with the Au-
 gust 1960 "Decree on State Bor-
 der Protection" which specifies
 that border troops must "repel
 armed incursions into Soviet
 territory by military formations
 and groups."
 The Sino-Soviet border is
 believed to be Moscow's chief
 concern.   In Eastern Europe the
 Soviets appear to be using fewer
 of their own border guards and
 relying more on cooperation with
 those of the satellites.
 In October 1964 KGB Border
 Guard personnel with Tank, Air
 Force, and Motorized Rifle in-
 signia were observed leaving the
 Alma Ata Higher Border Guard
 Command School, the only one
 which trains line officers. This
 school added a fourth year to
 its curriculum in the fall of
 1961, and showed signs of fur-
 ther expansion in October 1964.
 A photographic essay on the
 school in a May 1963 Soviet mili-
 tary magazine showed a combined
 tank and infantry attack being
 conducted.
 Border Guard tank units
 are believed to be attached to
 certain detachments along the
 lengthy southern border with
 China and Outer Mongolia where
 the terrain, the degree of
 tension, and the absence of
 nearby army units justify their
 deployment.

 COMMUNIST CHINA TAKES STOCK
 Speeches at the annual Chi-
 nese Communist National People's
 Congress, and the resolution is-
 sued following the final session
 of the rubber-stamp parliament
 on 4 January, suggest that the
 leaders in Peiping believe they
 are on the right track in solv-
 ing their basic problems.
 Regime spokesmen boasted
 about China's growing influence
 and power abroad.   In a major
 report on the state of the na-
 tion,  however,  Premier Chou En-
 lai conceded that the economy
 has not fully recovered from
 the disaster years of 1959-61
 and that considerable popular
 opposition to domestic policies
 still exists.
 Foreign Policy Aspects
 Chinese confidence was most
 clearly displayed in Chou's re-
 marks on foreign policy.   He
 claimed great victories in "se-
 rious trials of strength" during
 the past five years.   Chou as-
 serted that despite repeated at-
 tacks by "imperialists, reaction-
 aries,  and modern revisionists"
 Peiping's prestige has grown.
 He noted that Communist China
 now has diplomatic ties with 50
 countries and maintains trade or
 cultural relations with 120.
 Chou declared that China's
 chief enemy--the US--is being
 "knocked about everywhere" and
 faces more disastrous defeats
 if it enlarges the war in Indo-
 china.  He repeated earlier warn-
 ings that China would not "stand
 idly by" if this should take
 place.
 Although he made a pro
 forma reference to China's de-
 sire for better relations with
 the USSR, Chou's oblique attacks
 on Moscow indicate unflagging
 determination to press on with
 the Sino-Soviet conflict.  His
 remarks concerning the "great
 significance" of Mao Tse-tung's
 pronouncements on international
 questions are a new and sweeping
 claim to Chinese leadership of
 world revolutionary forces.
 Peiping's growing chauvin-
 ism was underscored by Chou's
 declaration that China would
 never depend on others for help.
 He asserted proudly that Commu-
 nist China will pay all its re-
 maining debt to the Soviet Union
 ahead of schedule,   out of the
 favorable balance in 1964 trade
 with the USSR.   Politburo mem-
 ber Marshal Ho Lung took the
 same chauvinistic line in a
 speech on 3 January described
 by New China News Agency as "im-
 portant."
 Ho bragged that Peiping
 not only has developed powerful
 armed forces but has exploded
 its first atom bomb--entirely
 designed and manufactured in
 China.   The creation of a new
 7th Ministry of Machine Building
 headed by an air force general
 suggests an expansion of the
 defense industry.   This organi-
 zation may be associated with
 aircraft or missile production.
 Chou En-lai's statement on
 the economy reflected satisfac-
 tion at improvements since the

 disaster years of 1959-61, but in-
 cluded no plans for speeding the
 country's slow,  steady recovery.
 He admitted that many shortcomings,
 mistakes, and diffficulties still
 exist.   Chou explained that read-
 justment of the economy--a euphe-
 mism for economic recovery--was
 unfinished, and would have to con-
 tinue in 1965.   Preparations are
 to be made this year for launching
 a third five-year plan in 1966,
 three years behind schedule.
 Current planning remains on
 an annual basis, with 1965 goals
 surprisingly modest.   The five-per-
 cent increase in total value of agri-
 cultural output scheduled for 1965
 is quite cautious for Chinese plan-
 ners, as is the 11-percent increase
 for industrial output, which is a
 drop from the claimed increase of
 15 percent for the previous year.
 Chou's claim that 1964 output of
 grain, cotton, and other major
 agricultural products all surpassed
 1957 levels is not supported by
 CIA analyses,  which estimate that
 grain and cotton output in 1964
 were below that of 1957.   Chou's
 claims  of a "better" harvest in
 1964 are neither spelled out sta-
 tistically nor reflected in the
 generally restrained planning for
 1965.
 The Internal Scene
 The Chinese leaders appear
 even more concerned over domestic
 political attitudes than over eco-
 nomic problems.   Chou claimed that
 "sinister winds of capitalism" are
 still blowing into China, where
 hostile elements are being "cease-
 lessly generated" in party and gov-
 ernment organs.     According to Chou,
 these people join forces with former
 landlords and capitalists--still
 a powerful and dangerous group--
 and oppose party programs.
 It is clear that the regime
 intends to meet what it regards
 as a threat by adopting an even
 harsher line.   The inclusion of
 four important party men--all re-
 gional bureau chiefs--in the gov-
 ernment emphasizes the party's
 determination to tighten direct
 supervision over the government
 apparatus.   Two of them, Ko Ching-
 shih and Tao Chu,  were appointed
 vice premiers.   Li Ching-chuan
 and Li Hsueh-feng were named to
 the NPC Standing Committee.
 that increasingly repressive meas-
 ures are already being used to
 root out and to punish all those
 who resist regime policies in
 any way.   The NPC resolution de-
 clared that the foremost domestic
 task for 1965 is to deepen the
 "socialist education movement."
 The intensified political indoc-
 trination which is a part of this
 campaign is being supported by
 a "cultural revolution" designed
 to harness every branch of art
 in the service of "politics."
 people.
 Chou's statement that all
 ethnic minorities will be forced
 to carry the socialist revolution
 "through to the end" may fore-
 shadow tougher treatment for tra-
 ditionally hostile groups such
 as the Tibetans.   He attacked the
 Panchen Lama--Chinese puppet
 leader in Lhasa who was removed
 from his post by the NPC--for
 having encouraged anti-regime ac-
 tivities.   Chou promised that the
 Chinese would take "bolder steps"
 to "remold" or to eliminate such

 HANOI-MOSCOW RELATIONS MAY BE CHANGING
 North Vietnam has made a
 limited move toward a resumption
 of its fence-straddling position
 in the Sino-Soviet dispute by with-
 drawing an anti-Soviet article
 from its party theoretical jour-
 nal.             After distributing early
 copies of the November issue of
 Hoc Tap, the publishers suddenly
 called them back to delete an ar-
 ticle by Hong Chuong, a frequent
 contributor with a decided pro-
 Chinese bias.   The title was inked
 out in the table of contents, and
 a nonpolemic speech by moderate
 politburo member Le Thanh Nghi
 was added as a loose insert.
 This sudden decision suggests
 that  a Soviet offer to increase
 political and perhaps some mili-
 tary aid may have been made to
 Premier Pham Van Dong, who re-
 turned to Hanoi from Moscow shortly
 before the Hoc Tap change was made.
 Since then Increased political
 support has in fact been given
 Hanoi.   Soviet leaders, backed by
 increased propaganda in the So-
 viet press and radio have reiter-
 ated Moscow's pledge of "neces-
 sary assistance" to counter any
 US "aggression" against North Viet-
 nam.             Moscow has also announced
 that a permanent office of the Na-
 tional Front for the Liberation
 of South Vietnam will be opened
 in the USSR in early 1965.
 A comparison of the original
 Hoc Tap article and its replace-
 ment --oTfers a rare example of the
 differing attitudes of the moder-
 ate and militant elements within
 the North Vietnamese party. Hong
 Chuong's article contained a
 strong attack on the errors of the
 Khrushchev leadership.   It lashed
 out at those who call for "peaceful
 coexistence with imperialism,"
 praised Stalin by name several
 times, and attacked the Soviet
 party's view of the party and state
 as instruments of all the people
 rather than class weapons.
 The article drew a clear dis-
 tinction between the errant Commu-
 nists who were responsible for these
 mistakes and those "true Communists"
 in the Soviet party who had adhered
 faithfully to the party of Lenin.
 While admitting cautiously that "to
 a certain extent" the removal of
 Khrushchev suggested that the "true
 Communists" might have regained some
 influence in Moscow, the article was
 essentially so anti-Soviet as to have
 been offensive to the new Soviet
 leaders as well as to Khrushchev.
 The replacement article, a
 speech by Le Thanh Nghi commemorating
 the October revolution, is charac-
 teristic of the traditionally non-
 polemic policy pursued before mid-
 1963.                                                                    A platitudinous account of
 Soviet and North Vietnamese coopera-
 tion and successes, the whole speech
 was designed to stress the things
 that Moscow and Hanoi have in com-
 mon rather than what has divided
 them.
 As yet,  there has been no open
 Chinese reaction to the prospect of
 improved Hanoi-Moscow relations.
 Peiping is probably adopting a wait-
 and-see attitude on the assumption
 that Soviet aid will fall far short
 of Vietnamese expectations and that   25X1
 this gesture toward the new Soviet
 leadership will not be followed up.

 Developments in Indonesia,
 in both domestic and foreign
 policy, continue to favor Com-
 munist interests.
 A major cabinet reshuffle
 which will either dismiss or
 downgrade the strongest mod-
 erates now in the government
 is reliably reported to be im-
 minent.   Those believed likely
 to be affected are Chaerul Sa-
 leh (third deputy prime minis-
 ter and minister of develop-
 ment), Adam Malik (trade), Gen-
 eral Nasution (defense), and
 Admiral Martadinata (navy).
 President Sukarno apparently
 has been persuaded that they
 are responsible for current
 economic difficulties and fail-
 ures in his military actions
 against Malaysia.
 The prospective move ap-
 pears to be the outgrowth of
 an extensive Communist attack
 on those connected with the re-
 cently banned anti-Communist
 "Sukarnoist" movement.   Saleh
 and Malik were its principal
 leaders, and Nasution and Mar-
 tadinata publicly supported it.
 Malik is reported already under
 arrest, and a relative of Nasu-
 tion is said to have been ar-
 rested several days ago.   The
 Murba or Proletarian Party,
 with which both Saleh and Malik
 are associated, was "temporar-
 ily" banned on 6 January, os-
 tensibly to prevent any split
 in the "unity of national pro-
 gressive and revolutionary
 forces."   Action against the
 non-Communist press,  which
 strongly supported "Sukarnoism,"
 also seems likely.   First Deputy
 Prime Minister Subandrio has
 threatened to shut down "anarch-
 istic!'newspapers and to permit
 only those of political parties
 and mass organizations to pub-
 lish.
 These developments enhance
 the position of Subandrio who,
 in effect, has largely allied
 himself with the Indonesian Com-
 munist Party (PKI).   This,  to-
 gether with the further weaken-
 ing of the anti-Communists, will
 work considerably to the party's
 advantage, even if it does not
 achieve greater cabinet repre-
 sentation.   Two PKI members and
 two pro-Communists besides Su-
 bandrio already hold significant
 places in the government.
 The PKI has applauded Su-
 karno's decision to withdraw
 Indonesia from the United Na-
 tions.   Withdrawal would further
 remove Sukarno from moderate in-
 fluences and his inclination to
 cooperate with Communist China
 and the more radical African
 governments will be strengthened.
 The PKI has con-
 sistently advocated a policy of
 force against Malaysia.   Under
 the umbrella of escalated military
 operations--should they occur--
 the Communists could be expected
 to press for an increased polit-
 ical role at both national and
 local levels, and probably would
 achieve it.

 The Huong government ap-
 pears to be moving toward a
 compromise with South Vietnam's
 armed forces leaders.   Premier
 Huong has indicated that he  is
 willing to forgo  establishment
 of another advisory council  to
 replace the disbanded High
 National Council and that he
 will try to expedite elections
 for a permanent national as-
 sembly.
 This formula, while per-
 mitting both parties to pro-
 ceed on the basis of the
 military's fait accompli in
 abolishing the council,  may do
 little more than paper over this
 challenge to the civilian
 government's power.   A newly
 created military "liaison"
 committee,  headed by air force
 chief General Ky, seems likely
 to be a vehicle for continued
 military involvement in politics.
 Ky says this committee's pur-
 pose is to resolve differences
 between the government and its
 Buddhist, student,  and political
 opponents.
 Buddhists and students re-
 newed antigovernment activity
 during the week,  although seri-
 ous                          disturbances so far have
 been avoided.   Buddhist leader
 Tri Quang now is indicating that
 his campaign to force Huong's
 removal as premier may be broad-
 ened to include Chief of State
 Suu as well,  and that he may
 order more drastic tactics if
 the government does not revoke
 a decree legalizing a rival
 Buddhist organization.
 Last week's six-day battle
 at Binh Gia, southeast of Saigon
 in Phuoc Tuy Province, established
 another benchmark in the in-
 creased willingness of the Viet
 Cong to engage in sustained
 clashes with government forces.
 Linh Gia--which involved Viet
 Cong units of estimated regimental
 strength against government
 marine,  ranger,  and airborne
 battalions--was the most extend-
 ed Communist action to date,  and
 possibly the most costly to the
 government.   However,  it does not
 represent a sudden Viet Cong
 departure from guerrilla tactics,
 but rather another step in a
 gradually developing capability
 for broader and more complex
 military actions.
 The total number of incidents
 initiated by the Communists last
 week remained slightly above the
 1964 weekly average of 550,
 with intense pressure exerted on
 the countryside,  particularly
 against objectives in the southern
 delta.   On the government side,
 the effective prosecution of the
 war effort continued to suffer
 from the preoccupation with pol-
 itics on the part of some senior
 officers at the higher levels of
 command.   Major government-initi-
 ated ground operations,  including
 those in contact with the enemy,
 again decreased.

 LAOTIAN RIGHTISTS RESUME SQUABBLING
 .,Rightist leaders in
 Vientiane are again squabbling
 over control of the Laotian
 capital.   Police and military
 factions, led respectively by
 Generals Siho and Kouprasith,
 have been in a state of alert
 for two weeks, each fearing
 moves by the other to take over
 full control.   The latest crisis
 was prompted when Siho seized
 an editor who was critical of
 police corruption.   It appears
 to have simmered down, but the
 underlying antagonisms remain
 resolved and could result in
 a serious flare-up with little
 notice.
 The continuing struggle
 for power has been complicated
 by the recent efforts of Deputy
 Premier Phoumi Nosavan to ex-
 ploit it for his own purposes.
 On 31 December, he called upon
 military leaders outside Vien-
 tiane to support his efforts to
 regain control of the rightist
 military command.   This appeal
 fell on deaf ears, however, with
 most of the military chiefs ap-
 parently anxious to avoid being
 embroiled in the infighting at
 Vientiane.  Although rebuffed
 in this instance, Phoumi still
 remains a force to be reckoned
 with by virtue of his positions
 as deputy premier and finance
 minister.
 Premier Souvanna, meanwhile,
 has created a commission to con-
 sider the questions of national
 elections, which under the con-
 stitution should be held this
 spring.   On 4 January the com-
 mission unanimously recommended
 that elections be postponed,
 but deferred discussion of
 necessary constitutional modi-
 fications and the length of the
 postponement.   Although King
 Savang reportedly favors elec-
 tions this spring, he is unlike-
 ly to oppose these recommenda-
 tions.
 The military situation re-
 mains relatively quiet, although
 there has been a major move of
 Communist troops into southern
 Laos since mid-December. Govern-
 ment roadwatch teams have re-
 ported the movement of up to
 1,000 North Vietnamese troops
 west along Route 12 toward the
 Mahaxay-Nhommarath region east
 of Thakhek.   Other reports over
 the past few weeks suggest the
 deployment of as many as 5,000
 Communist troops south along
 Route 23 toward the Muong Phine
 - Tchepone area.
 While some of the troops
 may be destined for southeastern
 Laos--and some perhaps for South
 Vietnam--it seems likely that
 the bulk will be moved west
 along Route 9 to the Ban Nong
 Boua Lao region, where rightist
 forces have recently been step-
 ping up their pressure.

 The Indian Government, in
 a series of sweeping arrests
 across the country last week,
 has confined more than 700 mem-
 bers of the radical "Left" Com-
 munist. Party under what could be
 indefinite jail terms.
 The Home Ministry has ac-
 cused them of treasonous actions
 and intent,  beginning even prior
 to China's 1962 attack on India,
 when they were but an extremist
 faction within the Indian Commu-
 nist Party,                      and continuing
 through 1964 when that party
 split into two groups of nearly
 equal size.   The "Left" Communist
 Party (CPI/L)  looks to Peiping
 for ideological guidance and in-
 spiration;  the "Right" Party
 (CPI/R)  is oriented toward Moscow.
 The arrests will effectively
 hobble the CPI/L in its competi-
 tion with the CPI/R for the ul-
 timate allegiance of India's
 155,000 Communists as well as in
 its ability to function as an
 overt political party.   The re-
 pression may,  in fact, prompt
 ultraradicals within the CPI/L
 to carry out extralegal activi-
 ties of sufficient scope to cause
 New Delhi to ban the group for-
 mally, as it has already threat-
 ened to do.
 The timing of the arrests
 appears to be essentially polit-
 ical.   Adequate justification
 for such a roundup has existed
 for two years under emergency
 powers assumed by New Delhi dur-
 ing the Chinese attack,  and
 lesser crackdowns took place
 in 1962 and last fall. India's
 strongly anti-Communist, British-
 molded police and intelligence
 officials presumably have favored
 stern action for some time, but
 the ruling Congress Party's dire
 prospect in the forthcoming
 Kerala State elections is prob-
 ably what persuaded its leaders
 to support such a drastic move
 now.
 Of the many parties in the
 field for the Kerala elections
 at the beginning of March, only
 the CPI/L had a chance of put-
 ting together a winning coalition.
 With more than 125 of the arrests
 having occurred in Kerala alone,
 the CPI/L seems to have been
 stripped not only of its lead-
 ers but also of many of its
 best known potential candidates.
 The likely effect,  therefore,
 will be the one preferred by
 Congress Party leaders if they
 cannot win themselves--i.e.,  a
 standoff at the polls, with no
 party or parties able to form
 a government and a subsequent
 continuation of direct rule over
 the state from New Delhi.

 regime's number-two man, Major
 General Umran, and reportedly
 now is pushing for various com-
 mand shifts to consolidate its
 position.
 The military leaders who
 have ruled Syria since the 1963
 coup now have almost completely
 sidelined their civilian asso-
 ciates under the Baathist (so-
 cialist)  banner.   The remaining
 civilian cabinet members are
 primarily technicians.   The
 Baathist prime minister, Major
 General Hafiz, who has main-
 tained his position by a series
 of successful compromises,  has
 not yet been threatened.
 The increased influence of
 the regime's. extremist faction
 is clearly demonstrated by cur-
 rent steps to complete the na-
 tionalization of industry.   Sim-
 ilar moves last spring provoked
 violent demonstrations and forced
 the government to draw back.
 The current program could meet
 similar resistance.   Given the
 present uncertain loyalties of
 key army units,  the new power
 clique might soon face serious
 problems in maintaining its own
 position.

 Moscow utilized Deputy
 Premier Shelepin's 19-29 Decem-
 ber visit to Egypt to exploit
 areas of US-Egyptian disagree-
 ment such as the Congo.   Shele-
 pin also reiterated Moscow's
 commitment to maintain close
 relations with Egypt and con-
 trasted Soviet assistance with
 Western aid,  which he said is
 used "to interfere in the af-
 fairs of other states."
 Moscow and Cairo continue
 to pursue their own policies
 in the Afro-Asian world,  but
 both have found it expedient in
 recent months to give the im-
 pression of a close identity
 of views on a number of inter-
 national issues.   The release
 of many Egyptian Communists
 from prison in 1964 and the
 favorable press treatment in
 each country of the other's
 policies reflect this improved
 atmosphere of relations.
 Probably to demonstrate
 the continuity of the USSR's
 policy of friendship with Cairo,
 the new Soviet leaders gave
 especially favorable treatment
 to the Egyptian delegation to
 the 7 :November celebrations in
 Moscow.   Also,  in recent months
 Arab Communists,  presumably on
 orders from Moscow,  have sought
 to cooperate with Nasirite and
 other nationalist   groups in a
 number of Middle Eastern coun-
 tries.
 In his public statements
 in Egypt,  Shelepin emphasized
 Soviet-Egyptian solidarity in
 support of "revolutionary lib-
 eration movements," particularly
 in the Congo.   He avoided any
 reference to the potentially
 divisive issue of how Arab unity
 is to be achieved,  and instead
 praised Egypt for choosing the
 "socialist" path of development.
 For his part, Egyptian
 President Nasir has been trying
 to give the impression that
 the USSR is prepared to give
 Egypt "all the aid it needs."
 Shelepin kept his assurances
 of support vague,  however,  and
 it is unlikely that he offered
 any new economic aid programs
 or indicated a willingness to
 replace any US aid which might
 be withdrawn.
 Under its new leadership,
 the USSR has already ratified
 the $280-million agreement con-
 cluded by Khrushchev last May
 in support of Egypt's new five-
 year plan which begins in March.
 It also signed an agreement on
 11 November with Defense Minis-
 ter Amir.   This will lead to
 delivery of a wide range of new
 military equipment compatible
 with Egypt's position as leader
 of the United Arab Command.
 After these recent demonstra-
 tions of economic and military
 support,  further offers of aid
 programs seem unlikely.

 The troubled Nigerian federa-
 tion has apparently survived a
 major crisis brought on by a direct
 clash between traditionally an-
 tagonistic ethnic and regional
 forces in connection with the 30
 December parliamentary election.
 However, the settlement of specif-
 ic   problems arising out of the
 election will probably involve pro-
 longed haggling, and a new crisis
 could flare over any of many issues.
 The crisis arose two weeks
 ago when the United Progressive
 Grand Alliance, one of the two
 national coalitions into which
 Nigerian political parties had po-
 larized for the election, appar-
 ently concluded that it could not
 win, and demanded postponement of
 the balloting.  The UPGA, which
 mainly represents relatively ad-
 vanced tribes of the Christian and
 pagan south, had hoped to wrest
 control of the federal government
 from incumbent conservative north-
 ern Muslim elements.  The UPGA
 leaders based their effort to
 block the voting on charges that
 irregularities in the Northern
 Region made "free and fair" elec-
 tions there impossible.
 The crisis came to a head on
 28 December when figurehead Presi-
 dent Azikiwe, a. southerner who is
 Nigeria's foremost nationa.list
 hero, openly sided with his erst-
 while UPGA associates and tried
 to force northerner Prime Minister
 Ba.lewa to give way to a "provision-
 al government."  Failing in this
 effort, Azikiwe ga.ve tacit sup-
 port to the'UPGA's election boy-
 cott.
 After the northerners' Nige-
 rian National Alliance (NNA) won
 the election--as it probably
 would have even without the boy-
 cott--Azikiwe refused at first
 to carry out his constitutional
 role in the formation of a new
 government.   After several days
 of frantic maneuvering, however,
 he and Balewa. announced a "compro-
 mise" which seems to be a, ca.pitu-
 la.tion to the northerners.   It
 calls for early elections in the
 UPGA-dominated constituencies
 where none took place and for a.
 "reexamination" of constituencies
 where only a. "small" number voted.
 Azikiwe agreed specifically that
 the validity of the elections
 could be questioned only by "due
 process of law" and that redress
 for alleged irregularities must
 be sought in the courts.
 On 7 January Balewa announced
 an apparently temporary government.
 All but four -members are from the NNA,
 but he promised a reshuffle after
 "outstanding" elections are held in
 the Eastern and Midwestern Regions
 and Lagos.   Much depends on the ex-
 tent to which key UPGA elements are
 included in the permanent government
 and on Balewa's success in softening
 the attitudes of both northern and
 southern extremists.   The top NNA
 leader, Northern Region Premier Bello,
 seems bent on taking full advantage
 of the NNA's strong position.

 CONGO GOVERNMENT RETAINS MILITARY INITIATIVE
 The Leopoldville govern-
 ment retains the military initi-
 ative                     despite  substantial for-
 eign shipments of arms to rebels
 in the northeastern Congo.
 Government forces continue
 to move quite freely and to cap-
 ture sizable quantities of these
 weapons.  The rebels, although
 better armed and using more
 sophisticated tactics than pre-
 viously,                            have not yet been able
 to mount a concerted counter-
 offensive and are often inca-
 pable of effectively employing
 their weapons.   The insurgents'
 ineptness suggests that they
 are not accompanied by foreign
 combat "volunteers."   Reports
 of foreign cadavers being picked
 up  have all, so far proven
 false.   The rebels'  apparently
 faltering resistance and their
 increasing weapons losses may
 cause their radical African
 suppliers either to stop the
 deliveries or to send in sol-
 diers to protect their invest-
 ment.
 The supply route through
 the Sudan may soon be threat-
 ened by southern Sudanese dis-
 sidents.   Some of their leaders
 based in Uganda claim that,
 given arms they could effective-
 ly block the shipments to the
 Congolese rebels.   Leopoldville
 has reportedly agreed to help
 but does not yet control any
 overland route by which any
 substantial. quantity of arms
 could be transferred to the
 Sudanese.   Although any opera-
 tions by the Sudanese rebels
 would be limited largely to
 harassing actions, this might
 be enough to dissuade Khartoum
 from further commitments of
 military equipment and personnel
 to the Congolese rebel cause.
 Meanwhile, efforts are now
 being made to drastically in-
 crease the number of mercenar-
 ies.   Resignations, casualties,
 and illness have reduced the
 400 mercenaries brought to the
 Congo to only 220, with scarcely
 half of these now effective.
 However, Belgians are being
 recruited in Europe with a view
 to replacing in due course all
 the South Africans and Rhode-
 sians.   Some of them are to be
 committed in small groups in
 widely scattered locations to
 stiffen Congolese Army units.
 For short-term needs,  however,
 new recruiting is being resumed
 in South Africa.
 On the political scene,
 Premier Tshombd has postponed
 the parliamentary elections
 planned for February until the
 last two weeks of March.   This
 ostensibly will permit elections
 to be held in areas not yet
 pacified,  and will in fact
 allow the government to con-
 solidate its political position.

 THE ITALIAN POLITICAL SITUATION
 Italy's short-run political
 outlook remains uncertain, as each
 of the parties in the center-left
 government coalition re-examines
 its policies in the wake of the
 bitter presidential election. The
 major hurdle facing Premier Moro's
 government is the question of work-
 ing out a firm agreement among
 these parties to enact certain of
 the long-needed reforms provided
 for in the government program. The
 Socialists (PSI) are demanding
 prompt action, while the present
 Christian Democratic (CD) leader-
 ship seems to be insisting on fur-
 ther delays.
 The Socialists made it clear
 at the 29 December cabinet meeting
 that unless the government gets
 going on meeting its program com-
 mitments on specific reforms by
 the end of January, the PSI will
 withdraw from the coalition.   They
 consider action now on three re-
 forms to be essential:   an urban
 reform :Law, institution of a na-
 tional economic plan, and reorgan-
 ization of the old-age pension sys-
 tem.   The urban law has not yet
 been approved even by the cabinet
 and, as of mid-November, the most
 optimistic prediction was that it
 might get parliamentary approval
 by early summer.   Coalition agree-
 ment is still pending on the eco-
 nomic plan, which was supposed to
 be presented to parliament last
 month.
 The current CD majority lead-
 ership appears disposed to stall

 as long as possible on certain re-

 coalition partners that the threat
 of renewed inflation makes it "un-
 timely" to institute reforms or to
 initiate legislation that would
 cost large sums.
 The PSI and the CD are also
 at odds over who should replace
 President Saragat as foreign min-
 ister.   The Christian Democrats
 are said to have initially pushed
 Treasury Minister Colombo, a mem-
 ber of the CD, for the job, while
 offering the treasury post to So-
 cialist Minister of the Budget
 Pieraccini.
 Meanwhile, the CD National
 Council, meeting later this month
 must come to grips with the prob-
 lem of restoring some semblance
 of party unity, an exceedingly
 difficult task now complicated by
 25X1
 the disruptive effects of the pres-
 idential election.   Any meaningful
 harmonization of factional differ-
 ences in the CD over key issues--
 particularly the coalition's pro-
 gram and factional representation
 on the Party Directorate--seems     25X1
 remote at this time.   A thin pa-
 pering over is probably the most
 that can be expecte.

 CASTRO INSISTS ON AUTONOMY IN COMMUNIST WORLD
 The salient point in Fidel
 Castro's long, rambling speech
 on 2 January was an emphatic dec-
 laration that Cuba will never
 submit to foreign dictation. Ad-
 dressing a mass rally in Havana
 commemorating the sixth anniver-
 sary of his coming to power, Cas-
 tro was more direct on this is-
 sue than ever before in a public
 speech.
 Castro left no doubt that
 he had the Soviets in mind when
 he declared that any foreign Com-
 munist party trying to tell
 Cubans what to do "would be met
 with a decisive and complete re-
 jection."   Arguing that Marxism-
 Leninism cannot be indiscrimi-
 nately applied everywhere, he as-
 serted tnat each country's na-
 tional traditions and idiosyncra-
 cies must be taken into account.
 These "subjective factors," he
 said, "are abundant" in Cuba.
 "We have no need," he declared,
 "to borrow anybody's brain...any-
 body's courage... anybody's in-
 telligence."
 Castro strongly chastised
 Cubans who, in his view, had come
 to feel too dependent on foreign
 aid.   He said that Cubans must
 be prepared to go it alone "even
 if absolutely no help could come
 ...from abroad."  Although "it
 is possible that this test may
 never come," he said, only with
 this attitude can Cubans consider
 themselves truly secure and gen-
 uinely revolutionary.

 In his references to the

 torily reasserted his interest
 in living in peace with the US

 have to come to terms with Cuba
 when it has to deal also with

 PROSPECTS IN PANAMA ON ANNIVERSARY OF ANTI-US RIOTS
 The Panamanian Government
 is determined to avert violence
 this week, the anniversary of
 last year's bloody anti-US riots.
 Although internal squabbling
 among Communists is in the gov-
 ernment's favor, isolated acts
 of terrorism cannot be prevented.
 Other unsettling developments
 are the efforts of Cuban-backed
 revolutionaries to involve for-
 mer president Arnulfo Arias in
 their antigovernment activities,
 and the threat of labor troubles.
 Arias received well over
 one third of the vote in last
 May's presidential elections--
 most of it among the urban lower
 classes--a.nd his party has the
 largest single block of deputies
 in the National Assembly.   Al-
 though Arias himself has a. long
 anti-Communist record, the "hard-
 line" Communists see his mass
 following as a tempting, suscep-
 tible group to incite to vio-
 lence.   They also regard his
 henchmen as invaluable allies
 for subversive activities.
 Arias has kept a.loof from
 politics since May, but re-en-
 tered the arena on 4 January with
 a, speech bitterly criticizing
 the Robles government for the
 death of one of his followers
 involved in a, bombing incident.
 It is unlikely, however, that
 Arias will make common cause with
 the Communists unless he becomes
 convinced that such collabora-
 tion would enable him to oust
 President Robles.
 A politically and economi-
 cally disruptive strike could
 occur this month in the chief
 banana-producing area, Chiriqui
 Province.
 The Communists have the sup-
 port of National Assemblymen
 Carlos Ivan Zuniga. and Virgilio
 Schuverer, pro-Communists who dom-
 inate the union.   These men de-
 rive much of their political
 power from control of union funds
 collected through a. checkoff sys-
 tem.   The company wants to dis-
 continue this system, as well
 as to hold the line on wages.

 The Bolivian Army on 3 Jan-

 The junta's description may

 there is reason to believe that

 plotting, but was trying also
 to discredit the national po-

 traditional military distrust
 and dislike of the police leave
 little doubt that the army is

 SLOW :PROGRAM FOR RETURN TO CONSTITUTIONALITY IN ECUADOR
 Ecuadorean junta president
 Admiral Castro Jijon on New
 Year's Day announced plans to
 return the country to consti-
 tutional government, but his
 program fell short of the ex-
 pectations that have been built
 up during the past several
 months.   Under the junta's plan,
 the changeover will probably
 be delayed for at least a year
 and a half.
 The eight-point program
 included a decree combining
 identity and voter registra-
 tion documents into one card.
 Reportedly, the cards will also
 serve as employment descriptions
 and tax registrations.   The
 junta claims that this action,
 along with a new electoral law
 and voting procedures it-
 pro-poses, will end electoral fraud.
 The compilation and distribu-
 tion of the cards will probably
 require a year's time.
 .A new constitutional com-
 mission will soon be appointed,
 probably to reform the existing
 1946 basic law.   This move ap-
 parently reflects a decision to
 abandon a draft constitution
 the junta recently published.
 The junta also announced
 that new decrees controlling
 local government will be issued,
 and that those will be followed
 by municipal and provincial
 elections.   Presidential and
 congressional elections will
 occur later.
 The junta's announcement
 revealed no timetable for any
 of these events.
 Although reaction to the
 junta's plans has so far been
 scant, political leaders will
 probably be outraged by such a
 slow and indefinite plan for re-
 turning to constitutional rule.
 The junta, however, apparently
 feels confident that it enjoys
 full support from the armed forces
 and most of the population, and
 can therefore cope with any ad-
 verse reactions.
 In other domestic develop-
 ments, the junta closed the old
 year by releasing the last of the
 political prisoners it has been
 holding, including Communist
 Party secretary general Pedro
 Saad.   On the international front,
 the Foreign Ministry is moving      25X1

 British Guiana has been trying
 to project the image of a mod-
 erate, conciliatory leader. He
 has not yet succeeded,  however,
 in dispelling the suspicion with
 which the large East Indian com-
 munity views his predominantly
 Negro government.   Opposition
 leader Jagan, ex-premier and
 still spokesman for the colony's
 East Indians,  is doing his ut-
 most to exacerbate that suspi-
 cion.
 Burnham has made a special
 effort to form a multiracial
 cabinet.    In a further attempt
 to broaden his base, Burnham
 gave in to demands of his coali-
 tion partner, the United Force,
 for three cabinet posts, rather
 than sticking to his initial
 offer of two.
 In his relations with Ja-
 gan's People's Progressive Party
 Burnham is going out of his way
 to be correct and considerate,
 thereby hoping to place the onus
 for any noncooperation on Jagan.
 Burnham has announced he will
 arrange for Jagan to receive a
 sult Jagan on "certain national
 issues."   In addition, he is
 claiming personal credit for the
 release, just before Christmas,
 of nine political detainees,
 five of whom belong to the PPP.
 Jagan so far has not re-
 sponded in kind to these attempts
 at conciliation.   The PPP still
 claims the election was a fraud,
 and is trying to keep racial ani-
 mosities alive by warning that
 Burnham's gestures to non-Negroes
 are hypocritical and that Indians
 must expect to be treated "like
 Jews in Germany."  Jagan has an-
 nounced a program of "nonviolent
 noncooperation" apparently aimed
 primarily at weakening the colo-
 ny's economy.
 The US consul in Georgetown
 is impressed with Burnham's
 statesmanlike performance to date,
 but doubts that the new premier
 has made much impression on In-
 dians in the countryside.              25X1
