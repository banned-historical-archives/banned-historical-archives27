 China's Industrial Management
 Reforms: Rough Road Ahead                                25X1
 Chinese officials increasingly have recognized that modernizing industrial
 management is a precondition for overcoming the inefficiency, uneven
 product quality, and poor use of equipment and technology that character-
 ize Chinese industries. Beijing made management reform an integral part
 of its economic reform program in 1984, and in 1986 called for enterprise
 management to be evaluated on the basis of three criteria: improved
 product quality, reduced material consumption, and increased productivity.
 In November 1986, Premier Zhao Ziyang stated that invigorating major
 enterprises through managerial reforms would be the focus of China's
 economic restructuring in 1987.
 To create a new industrial management system, Beijing is promoting
 greater enterprise autonomy and more responsibility for factory managers.
 Measures such as reducing or eliminating mandatory state production
 plans, phasing out state provision of raw materials and investment funds,
 and allowing enterprises to retain more of their earnings are intended to
 shift the government's role to indirect guidance of industries as a whole.
 Within the factory, reforms such as the "factory manager responsibility
 system" call for directors to have full authority over production, personnel,
 and administration; managers will be rewarded on the basis of the
 enterprise's profits and losses. Beijing also is testing other more radical
 management reforms, such as allowing individuals to lease factories after
 posting personal property as a guarantee, or permitting managers to issue
 stock to raise capital. We believe, however, that the factory manager
 responsibility system will be the mainstay of China's management reforms
 for some time.
 Many of the showcase factories instituting management reforms have
 achieved impressive results in areas such as technology use, quality control,
 and stimulation of creativity. This suggests that the changes could improve
 the management, innovation, and productivity of Chinese industry if the
 leadership commits itself to a long-term reform program in this and related
 sectors of the economy.
 However, resistance to reform is strong and is coming from several
 directions. At the local level, party secretaries and administrative organiza-
 tions have little motivation to accept management changes. The new
 policies often go directly against the interest of party and government
 officials by reducing their authority and, with it, their prestige and perks.
 Workers also resist changes affecting employment levels and wages.

 In addition, the renewed debate over political and economic reforms in the
 wake of Hu Yaobang's resignation has led to the reemergence of conserva-
 tive economic themes-including calls for more state control-and criti-
 cism of enterprise management reforms. The ongoing debate reflects
 disagreements over the respective roles of party and government-an issue
 at the heart of management reforms. Failure to resolve the conflict among
 party, administrative, and factory management officials over their roles in
 production will prevent Beijing from instituting a permanent, new manage-
 ment system. Conservative criticism has already forced suspension of
 related economic measures-such as price and labor reforms-that are
 essential to factory modernization. Moreover, the debate probably will
 cause party officials to be even more recalcitrant about following reforms,
 and managers more hesitant about implementing them. These factors plus
 the sheer enormity of the task of modernizing one-half million enterprises
 suggest that, over the near term, management reforms will continue to
 bring improvements to industrial performance only at the margin.
 The reforms, in any case, give managers only new responsibility and
 authority, but not the knowledge to handle the new opportunities. Current
 training programs-under both international and domestic auspices-
 reach only a small portion of the enterprises in need of management
 modernization, although Beijing is working to expand the effort. Since
 1978, when Deng Xiaoping first asked the United States to establish the
 management training center in Dalian, four other training centers have
 been established with international assistance. A number of countries and
 foreign firms are also providing training through seminars, cooperative
 programs, joint ventures, and on-the-job experience in foreign factories.
 The United States has generated considerable good will by being at the
 forefront in offering training to Chinese managers. Many of the graduates
 of the US-sponsored program at Dalian have been appointed to senior
 government posts, and Chinese leaders have expressed their appreciation
 for the quality of US management programs.

 China's Industrial Management
 Reforms: Rough Road Ahead
 Chinese and foreign observers alike have for years
 acknowledged that poor management in Chinese fac-
 tories has been a major cause of China's low produc-
 tivity, ineffective use of technology, and poor product
 quality. As part of its larger economic reform pro-
 gram-aimed at improving performance by gradually
 adopting a system combining central controls, free
 market forces, and microeconomic incentives-China
 began experimenting with management reform as
 early as 1979. The issue has remained a central one
 for economic planners. For example, in early 1986, Lu
 Dong, Minister of the State Economic Commission,
 called management reform extremely important to
 the overall economic situation and stressed the "ur-
 gent need to improve enterprise management." ' And
 in November, Premier Zhao Ziyang stated that invig-
 orating major enterprises through managerial reforms
 would be the focus of China's economic restructuring
 in 1987.
 Creating a New Management System
 Throughout most of China's industries, factory direc-
 tors serve as government functionaries fulfilling or-
 ders from above. The state supplies raw materials to
 factories and tells managers what to produce, to
 whom to sell, and what price to charge. The factory
 party secretary approves production plans and ap-
 points personnel; he even approves, in consultation
 with higher authorities, the appointment of the fac-
 tory manager, who then manages "under the leader-
 ship of the party committee."

 Beijing has for some time publicly recognized the
 problems inherent in this system. Fulfilling the plan
 often becomes the goal, with little need to consider
 whether the product meets the needs of consumers or
 whether the enterprise is profitable. Factory directors
 have little authority or incentive to improve the
 factory's performance by increasing output, upgrad-
 ing quality, or adopting technological advances. De-
 termining even the costs of production is difficult,
 given the state-controlled prices of supplies and fin-
 ished goods. At the national level, the subsidies to and
 the poor performance of state enterprises constitute a

 major drain on government resources. In the past,
 China has sought to improve enterprise performance
 by stressing capital investment, and, more recently,
 investment in technical upgrading to increase enter-
 prise output. These attempts to solve problems by
 "throwing bricks at them" have increased state invest-
 ments, but poor state enterprise performance, rapidly
 rising state deficits, and mounting state enterprise
 losses have underscored need for management reform
 (see figure). China's State Statistical Bureau reported
 that the number of deficit state enterprises rose from
 10.5 percent in 1984 to 17.6 percent in 1986.
 Redefining Industrial Priorities
 Beijing has tried to refocus industrial priorities on
 correcting management problems. Major economic
 reform documents issued in 1984 established guide-
 lines for creating a new socialist economic structure in
 which enterprises can respond in a competitive way to
 market signals. The State Council last year further
 specified that enterprise management is to be evaluat-
 ed on the basis of three criteria: improved product
 quality, reduced material consumption, and increased
 productivity. It also established targets in each of
 these categories that enterprises must try to reach
 during the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).2 Since
 July, Vice Premier Li Peng and others have urged use
 of a fourth criterion-how well a factory uses and
 manages its equipment.
 The State Council documents called for industrial
 upgrading to begin in machine building, electronics,
 iron and steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, textiles,
 and some light industries. Enterprises are to adopt
 new management systems, introduce advanced man-
 agement techniques, and use advanced technology to
 reduce waste and improve quality. Beijing says other
 sectors, such as transport, post and telecommunica-
 tions, service, and building industries, also will work
 out ways to strengthen enterprise management
 The Reforms: Changing the Way
 Factories Are Managed
 To achieve these goals, Beijing is trying to reduce
 direct involvement of government and party officials
 in factory affairs and give managers responsibility for
 enterprise performance. Although the reform pro-
 gram continues to evolve, the basic program appears
 currently to have two main tenets:
 ? Enterprise Autonomy. To give enterprises greater
 autonomy in responding to market signals, Beijing is
 shifting the government's role in industry from
 direct involvement in production decisions to a more
 indirect role of planning, coordinating, and supervis-
 ing industry as a whole, according to published
 reform documents. The reforms call for the state to
 reduce mandatory production plans, provide a
 smaller portion of raw materials for production, and
 eliminate interference by government officials in
 factory affairs. A key area of change is the financial
 relationship between the state and enterprises. Beij-
 ing is reducing state-supplied investment funds;
 allowing enterprises to retain a larger share of their
 revenues and to decide how to use those earnings;
 and granting enterprises the right to sell overquota
 production at prices above state-set levels.
 ? The Factory Manager Responsibility System. This
 system-the heart of management reform within
 the factory-is designed to:
 - Establish the authority of the factory director as
 key decisionmaker within the factory.
 - Provide financial incentives for managers to
 improve factory performance.
 - Establish adequate checks and balances against
 abuse of managers' newfound powers.
 The factory manager responsibility system is also
 Beijing's primary mechanism for redistributing power
 from party secretary to plant director. The system
 theoretically gives plant directors full authority to
 manage production, appoint and dismiss personnel,
 adjust and establish administrative systems within the
 factory, and reward or penalize workers and staff.
 Managers are rewarded on the basis of the enterpri-
 se's profits and losses.
 Implementation of the management reforms began in
 1979 with experiments in selected locations, which
 were gradually expanded until a backlash against the

 reforms occurred in mid-1985 and early 1986. Public
 reports that managers were abusing their decision-
 making powers proliferated; many were unwarranted
 attacks by party conservatives against innovative
 methods, although some instances of corruption were
 also uncovered. Such reports caused reformers to
 reconsider both the checks on a manager and the
 protections afforded managers against malicious criti-
 cism. Also, numerous problems during the period-
 excessive industrial growth, inflation, and skyrocket-
 ing investment-caused reformers to slow the reform
 program until they could improve macroeconomic
 control techniques, such as the use of taxes and
 interest rates, and deal with criticism by conserva-
 tives. Beijing renewed its push for modernizing man-
 agement in mid-1986, when it publicly called for
 expanding the number and types of enterprises subject
 to management reforms during the Seventh Five-Year
 Plan (see inset on page 4).
 In practice the degree of autonomy accorded enter-
 prises varies by industry, size of firm, and whether it
 is state or collectively owned. In general, the greatest
 autonomy is found in small, collective industries
 producing items not directly related to the national
 interest-a list of items that is apparently growing,
 according to Chinese and foreign observers. Nation-
 wide, only about 60 major industrial products, such as
 steel, petroleum, and chemicals, remain under manda-
 tory state production quotas. Industries that are major
 foreign exchange earners tend to have less autonomy
 than light industry.
 erating in over 40 percent of state-owned industrial
 enterprises, according to a Chinese State Statistical
 Bureau survey of 21 provinces.
 implementation is spotty, however, as evi-
 denced by a 1986 survey of 10 provinces, which found
 that only 20 percent of those enterprises practicing
 the manager responsibility system had fully imple-
 mented it. Nevertheless, numerous examples of im-
 proved enterprise performance under the system en-
 couraged the leadership to extend the manager
 responsibility system to all state-owned enterprises by
 1990.
 Experimental Measures
 Official Chinese statements and US Embassy report-
 ing show that other measures have been proposed,
 offering alternatives for increasing the managers'
 personal stake in the success of the enterprises, forc-
 ing them to consider the balance between the en-
 terprises' immediate and long-term interests, and
 creating a stronger process for auditing and evaluat-
 ing the managers' performance. For example, the
 Chinese official who says he devised the factory
 manager responsibility system has come to believe it
 does not give managers adequate tools to carry out
 reform and to counter party and local government
 interference, according to US Embassy reporting.
 This official is now overseeing experiments with a
 financial responsibility system that bases incentives
 for managers on owning stock in the enterprise (see
 inset on page 6).
 Even more radical changes have been proposed, such
 as reducing state ownership of enterprises and chang-
 ing the party role within the factory to a voluntary,
 unpaid position engaged in essentially extracurricular
 activities. Some Chinese have argued, for example,
 that the state must not only distance itself from
 management but must actually transfer ownership of
 its enterprises to managers and workers to motivate
 them to increase productivity. Many of these reforms
 are strongly opposed by party officials, however, and
 we believe the factory manager responsibility sys-

 Chongqing: A Microcosm of Management Reforms
 The course of management reforms in Chongqing
 captures the problems, trends, and progress seen in
 varying degrees elsewhere in China. One of the largest
 industrial cities in the southwest, Chongqing was
 among the first sites in China to experiment with
 management changes.
 Early experimentation began in 1979, when Premier
 Zhao Ziyang was in charge of the province. The
 experiment included over 100 enterprises by 1982;
 further acceleration occurred in 1984.
 A backlash appeared in 1985, as exemplified by the
 case of the director of the Chongqing Rubber Belt
 Factory. After taking office in 1982, the director
 established detailed production plans and regula-
 tions. By 1985, the factory had risen from last to first
 place among the nation's rubber belt factories. But
 criticism by conservatives of the director's methods
 began to appear in the press, focusing on excessive use
 of funds to host a sales meeting at which potential
 buyers were entertained by singers. After an investi-
 gation, city authorities declared the charges unfound-
 ed and their faith in the director unwavering. Simi-
 larly, five managers of other factories were cleared of
 charges after city and party officials held public
 hearings.
 In a renewed emphasis on reform in 1986, Chongqing
 took steps to eliminate some of the friction over
 implementation of the reforms. In May, the city
 government issued a regulation stipulating that fac-
 tory directors cannot, without reason, be removed
 from their posts at the will of their superior depart-
 ments. City officials announced in July that, to
 further resolve the 'power struggle between adminis-
 trative units and enterprises, " 52 administrative com-
 panies changed their nature from administrative
 management to economic service organizations that
 provide marketing and other services.
 At present in Chongqing, over 460 industrial enter-
 prises operate under the manager responsibility sys-
 tem. According to Chinese press accounts, managers
 in these factories can appoint and dismiss assistants
 and decide production and discipline issues. Manag-
 ers in 20 percent of these enterprises operate under a
 set term of service.
 More innovative reforms are also being tested. In the
 summer of 1986, Chongqing began advertising for a
 director to head the first factory to operate under a
 leasing arrangement, called the asset management
 responsibility system, that ties a director's salary to
 how closely he meets goals for production and capital
 gains. In September 1986, city officials announced
 that 20 state enterprises would implement the system.
 Chongqing also has loosened controls over technology
 supplies and major industrial materials, allowing
 managers to directly acquire needed inputs. Other
 reforms under way include encouraging enterprises to
 attract capital by issuing stocks and leasing some
 small state-owned factories. Chongging's.first stock-
 holder-owned factory was established in September
 1985, with 3.24 million yuan (US $880,000) invested
 by one state-owned company, three collectively owned
 enterprises, and individuals.
 The role of the state has been reduced. Only those
 products essential to the national economy, such as
 iron and steel, remain subject to targets; only 12
 percent of Chongqing 's total industrial output value
 is produced under mandatory planning.
 In the future, in keeping with the State Council's July
 1986 decision on management reform, the Chongqing
 party committee and government announced in Sep-
 tember 1986 that the factory manager responsibility
 system was to be immediately implemented in all
 enterprises.

 press credit "gutsy" individuals who took charge, but
 many Chinese factory directors find the new demands
 incomprehensible. Foreign observers note that most
 managers, although conscientious and hard working,
 see themselves primarily as conduits for information
 from higher authorities to workers.
 Initial Steps for Improving Managerial Skills
 China initially emphasized the need to put better
 educated, more qualified persons in top factory posi-
 tions. As part of a national campaign to rejuvenate
 industry by replacing older officials, Beijing instituted
 mandatory requirements in 1982 to abolish the life-
 long term of office and began stressing the importance
 of higher education and technical background in
 selecting replacements. As a result, a 1985 survey of
 29,000 key enterprises disclosed that 89 percent of
 people in leadership positions had higher education,
 and that the average age of managers had dropped
 significantly.
 examination scores were linked to future promotions.
 According to Chinese press reports, more than
 100,000 managers had taken the exams by the end of
 1986, including almost 70 percent of managers from
 key enterprises. Leaders of smaller enterprises are
 also being tested. Despite these measures, one recent
 Chinese survey reported that 85 percent of industrial
 leaders believe the majority of factory managers are
 not qualified to carry out present reforms.
 Management Training Programs
 The State Council has specifically noted the impor-
 tance of advanced management techniques for quality
 control, internal factory financial accounting, estab-
 lishment of technical standards, and streamlining
 factory organization (see inset on page 8). Manage-
 ment training programs have proliferated under both
 international and domestic sponsorship.
 International Programs
 Under a Sino-US science and technology protocol, the
 United States began management training classes for
 senior executives and industry directors at Dalian in
 1980. The Dalian program, considered a complete
 success by both sides, has spawned such offshoots as a
 joint M.B.A. program between the Dalian institute
 and a US university. Many of the Dalian graduates-
 such as Wang Zhaoguo, now a Chinese Communist
 Party Central Committee member-have been ap-
 pointed to senior party and government posts, and
 Chinese leaders have expressed their appreciation to
 the United States for being at the forefront in training
 Chinese managers in advanced management tech-
 niques.
 China also has established joint management training
 centers with the EC (in Beijing), Canada (Chengdu),
 West Germany (Shanghai), and Japan (Tianjin). Beij-
 ing is discussing the establishment of another man-
 agement training center with French and Australian
 participation,                            and also
 has held discussions with Bulgaria and East Germany.

 Beginning in October 1983, China required that all
 managers of large and medium-sized enterprises take
 an examination on a number of economic, manageri-
 al, and party topics. To encourage participation,

 Experiments in Factory Management
 Beijing is also experi-
 menting-but on a much more limited basis than the
 factory manager responsibility system-with addi-
 tional incentives, guidelines, and controls.
 Management contract system. Contract systems for-
 malize and extend many of the elements of the
 factory manager responsibility system. These sys-
 tems-also called term responsibility systems or
 tenure responsibility systems-require managers to
 sign three- to five-year contracts specifying targets for
 categories such as profits, quality and variety of
 goods, and managerial and technical innovation. If
 the contract is fulfilled, a manager's salary increases;
 failure to accomplish the goals may result in demo-
 tion, or, in cases of serious breaches of safety or
 production disruptions, dismissal. Managers appoint-
 ed under the traditional industrial system submit
 yearly production plans, but no rewards or penalties
 are attached to achieving the goals. Some Chinese
 press reports imply contracts are a basic ingredient of
 management reforms, while others suggest contracts
 are used much less widely than the factory manager
 responsibility system. In Beijing, for example, 20
 state-run factories began management by contract in
 April 1986, while the experience of 233 Shenyang
 enterprises with this system was so promising that the
 city government in 1986 decided to introduce the
 system to all enterprises.
 Enterprise leasing. As a means of increasing the
 manager's stake in an enterprise's success, small
 firms-usually heavily debt ridden-have been
 leased to individuals selected through a competitive
 process. The new enterprise director is required to
 have two financial guarantors and to commit a
 certain amount of personal property as collateral.
 The manager is given full power over the factory's
 personnel and operations, and agrees to pay a fixed
 level of profits to the state at the end of a predeter-
 mined period. Any extra profit may be kept by the
 manager, but shortcomings must be made up from
 the personal wealth of the manager and the guaran-
 tors. In 1986, according to the State Statistical
 Bureau, 2,900 small state-owned enterprises were
 experimenting with leasing.
 In the first enterprise to try leasing, according to
 Chinese publications, profits rose from 13,000 yuan
 in 1981 to 460,000 in 1985. The same person served
 as factory manager throughout the period, but, ac-
 cording to Chinese press reports, was able to make
 improvements in later years because leasing greatly
 increased his authority. The manager even fired 10
 workers, and the party secretary with whom he
 frequently disagreed was transferred.
 The asset management responsibility system. This
 system applies selected aspects of enterprise leasing
 to large, state-run enterprises. A committee-usually
 consisting of government officials, factory officials,
 and outside experts chosen by the factory-advertises
 for a factory manager. Applicants for the post submit
 proposed plans for managing the factory, and a
 prediction of capital gains. The successful candidate
 is required to post collateral; one account reported a
 director put up his family property and one-third of
 his annual income; another manager provided a
 personal bond of 1,500 yuan (US $400), compared to
 a basic salary of 150 yuan a month. Through a series
 of contracts, the manager is given control of planning,
 management, and the employment, dismissal, and
 pay of workers. Standards for fixed-asset additions,
 capital turnover, and profits are agreed upon at the
 outset and are tied to a schedule of bonuses or fines.

 Secret
 An important addition to the manager's duties is the
 responsibility for obtaining capital funding, further
 severing the financial relationship between enterprise
 and state. The factory must obtain bank loans to
 meet its needs, and debt service payments are to be
 deducted from posttax profits. The state collects not
 only a corporate income tax but also a fee payable for
 the use of assets provided to the director.
 enterprises operating under this
 system will be taxed at a lower rate to encourage
 enterprises to make better use of their capital and to
 expand production. Trials of asset management be-
 gan in the summer of 1986 in four enterprises, with at
 least 20 more planning to adopt the system, according
 to a Chinese press report.
 Financial responsibility system. The financial respon-
 sibility system goes beyond the asset management
 system by basing incentives for responsible manage-
 ment on ownership,
 The enterprise issues stock to
 workers, managers, and the general public, although
 the state maintains a controlling interest. An enter-
 prise advisory board chooses a manager, helps in
 basic planning, reviews the enterprise's performance,
 and rewards or dismisses managers. Stockholders are
 represented on the advisory board, a device intended
 to neutralize political influences. Decisions not based
 on economic reasoning risk financial loss for both the
 enterprise and the individual. The Chinese official
 who01evised both the factory manager respon-
 sibility system and the financial responsibility system
 believes the latter is vastly superior, and that owner-
 ship is the key to improving factory performance. In
 September 1986 the State Council agreed to selected
 experiments with financial responsibility in a handful
 of cities.
 Foreigners are helping improve Chinese manage-
 ment skills through government-sponsored train-
 ing centers, joint ventures, and on-the-job train-
 Sweden and Great Britain are cooperating on a
 project to train Chinese in S&T management and
 planning.

 China has further encouraged the transfer of manage-

 and through numerous seminars, some under govern-
 ment-to-government cooperative agreements, others
 sponsored by universities, businesses, international
 organizations, institutes, and societies. For example,
 Harvard University and the Chinese management
 association are cosponsoring a series on Beijing televi-
 sion to introduce Chinese viewers to US management
 techniques. Visiting experts discuss Western manage-   25X1
 ment experience through lectures, teaching assign-
 ments, and hands-on experience in Chinese factories.
 China also is sending management trainees to Japan
 and the United States to receive private and corporate
 training in factories.                                 25X1

 Secret
 Matching Management Techniques
 to Factory Problems
 China needs to use modern management methods in
 upgrading factory operations, particularly in such
 areas as:
 ? Equipment justification. Because of the difficulty of
 obtaining equipment in the past, Chinese managers
 try to buy whatever equipment they can, rather than
 what they need; this is one reason Chinese enter-
 prises generally ask for the most advanced
 technology.
 ? Inventory control. Enterprises hoard materials be-
 cause of the uncertain supply; there is no concept of
 the cost of excess inventory.
 ? Quality control. China is increasingly familiar with
 quality control but lacks knowledge and personnel
 to institute statistical sampling and factory quality-
 control procedures.
 ? Accounting. Internal accounting procedures are
 needed, but firms are not used to gathering infor-
 mation, and data integrity is a problem.
 ? Financial decisionmaking. Use of economic grounds
 to evaluate proposed projects could improve
 choices, although application could be extremely
 difficult in China, where the cost of inputs such as
 material and capital is unknown.
 ? Shop floor control. Basic knowledge about how
 materials flow through the factory and how to
 efficiently organize steps in the production process
 is lacking in most Chinese enterprises.
 ? Marketing. Chinese firms lack basic information on
 suppliers, customers, and other producers. Methods
 for conducting market research are needed.
 Domestic Training Programs
 A new domestic training program will train nearly
 50,000 people by 1990; a trial program started in
 September 1986. According to Chinese press releases,
 only graduates of the program, run by institutes of
 higher education, will be entrusted with important
 posts and be eligible for promotion.
 Other domestic training efforts include:
 ? Colleges of economic management, created by refo-
 cusing former party cadre schools; Chinese press
 reports claimed that by early 1987 a network of 93
 such institutes existed.
 ? Management training programs run by the Chinese
 Association for Science and Technology, the Chi-
 nese Economic Management Association, and vari-
 ous ministries.
 ? Local educational efforts, such as an educational
 program in Shanghai-initially for younger work-
 ers-that attracted 24,000 technical and manage-
 ment personnel in 1985.
 ? Management study programs and research centers
 at colleges and universities, as well as postcollege
 adult education programs in management.
 ? Programs offered by the newly founded Women's
 Enterprise Association to promote an exchange of
 management knowledge and experiences among
 female managers.
 ? Publication of management materials, including a
 Chinese enterprise management encyclopedia by the
 State Economic Commission and the party propa-
 ganda department
 The impact of these reforms has been blunted by
 several factors. First, Beijing is struggling with sever-
 al fundamental issues, and this is slowing implemen-
 tation of the reforms. In the past, for example, the
 party made sure that industry served socialist goals,
 but now industry's attention is focused on making a
 profit and improving efficiency. The enterprise has

 Secret
 looked after workers' welfare by providing housing
 and other social services, but some reform leaders
 want to break off social welfare functions from fac-
 tories. Similarly, the government is uncertain which
 responsibilities it should retain to sufficiently control
 the economy-for example, whether state ownership
 of enterprises must be loosened to stimulate produc-
 tivity and, if so, how to justify such action in terms of
 socialist thought.
 Second, management reforms now provide direct in-
 centives for managers but little motivation for party
 secretaries and administrative organizations. On the
 contrary, policies often go directly against the inter-
 ests of party and government officials, reducing their
 authority-the source of their prestige and perks-
 and holding out the possibility that their very jobs will
 be declared unnecessary. In comparison, the few
 benefits to these groups-more taxes from profitable
 firms and improvements in the quality, price, and
 supply of goods-are neither direct nor persuasive.
 Debate Among the Leadership
 Beijing has yet to demonstrate the resolve to sort out
 the key problem regarding the respective roles of the
 factory manager, the party official, the worker, and
 the state. A July 1986 State Council decision and
 regulations issued in October largely confused the
 situation, both by endorsing decisionmaking powers
 for managers-as embodied in the factory manager
 responsibility system-and by calling for directors to
 accept the supervision of workers, staff members, and
 other concerned parties.
 The difficulties involved in resolving this issue have
 been magnified by recent events in China. The politi-
 cal turmoil surrounding the student protests and the
 resignation of Hu Yaobang as party general secretary
 in January 1987 has intensified the debate over
 economic themes and has put reformers on the defen-
 sive.' The discussion reflects disagreements over what
 role the party, government, and enterprise should play
 in China's changing economic system. This issue is at
 the heart of Beijing's management reforms, which are
 predicated on redefining the functions of party and
 government in daily enterprise affairs. Moreover,
 conservatives may be uncomfortable that manage-
 ment reforms have prompted the creation or expan-
 sion of services usually associated with market econo-
 mies, such as advertising and legal services (see inset).
 As conservative officials have pushed themes such as
 more centralized control, management reforms in
 particular have been criticized. Conservative senior
 officials have stressed the importance of factory party
 leaders, sometimes building them up more than fac-
 tory managers. At the same time, however, a number
 of key leaders and organizations have echoed Zhao's
 call for management reform in 1987, including Vice
 Premier Li Peng, one of the most conservative senior
 government leaders, suggesting that management re-
 forms will continue as a policy initiative.
 Within the Factory
 The Director Versus the Party Secretary. According
 to State Council guidance and public statements by
 Chinese officials, the party's responsibilities are now
 largely limited to overall enterprise policy (as defined
 by state directives and the state plan), general worker
 welfare, and political education programs. But, in
 general, party secretaries are not easily accepting this
 diminution of their authority. Chinese press accounts
 and US Embassy reporting indicate that, in factories
 experimenting with management reforms, managers
 generally can assert their decisionmaking authority
 over production but are encountering resistance from
 party secretaries regarding control over functions
 such as the appointment of midlevel cadres, changing
 employment levels, and the distribution of bonuses
 and housing.
 The Director and the Workers. Although the formal
 role of workers in factory affairs is generally limited
 to annual meetings of factory workers' congresses,
 managers have often found that they cannot threaten

 Secret
 Changes in the Supporting Cast
 As management reforms change the responsibilities
 and functions of managers and their factories, the
 supporting cast of characters is changing as well.
 Besides the enhanced role of the banking community,
 other new roles include:
 producing under mandatory plans, but now allo-
 cates only 23 materials. Firms often do not know
 where to buy materials and equipment. According
 to Chinese press reports, a number of groups have
 stepped in to fill the gap. Over 858 capital goods
 service companies help enterprises buy, sell, and
 transport goods not included in the state plan. At
 least one city has opened a capital goods market so
 that enterprises can trade their excess materials.
 Similarly, an association of machinery producers
 established a central office in Beijing to facilitate
 equipment sales.
 ? Legal services. A Chinese newspaper reports that
 nearly 40,000 Chinese enterprises have set up legal
 consultative offices. Such offices offer legal services
 to factory directors, take part in decisionmaking
 and management of a factory, and play a major
 role in technical and trade negotiations. Some
 factories report these offices have had an immedi-
 ate impact; a Shanghai iron and steel works report-
 ed its legal office settled 79 default cases since
 1983. The need for legal services will continue to
 grow as external relations become more complex.
 ? Marketing. Market information is a key need for
 Chinese managers, and creative means for supply-
 ing it are appearing. According to a sample survey
 in 10 Chinese provinces and cities, 30 to 50 percent
 of enterprises have established data collection and
 analysis centers.
 ? Advertising. China has 70,000 advertising agencies
 doing a business volume of 700 million yuan a year,
 according to the Chinese press. Ads run in newspa-
 pers and magazines, and on radio and television.
 Some railways and urban communications depart-
 ments have set up their own advertising agencies.
 Shanghai recently reported the first known instance
 of a Chinese suit for false advertising and faulty
 product design.
 ? Suppliers. The state's Material Supply Bureau
 formerly controlled the supply of over 250 kinds of
 materials-steel, cement, timber-to factories
 ? The Press. Managers frustrated by interference or
 criticism have turned for help to the press, which is
 now allowed to investigate and publicize wrongdo-
 ings in at least some locations. One Wuhan newspa-
 per editor said his paper acts in part as a de facto
 investigatory agency for the provincial party com-
 mittee, empowered to investigate, report, and ex-
 pose problems. The Wuhan municipal government
 also decided to use the offices of city papers to
 collect information on marketing conditions, prices,
 and economic opportunities throughout China for
 dissemination to Wuhan enterprises.
 Beijing is playing an active part in setting up needed
 support systems by adopting technical standards,
 issuing regulations, establishing a nationwide
 quality-inspection network of over 100 test sites, and
 conducting quarterly inspections.

 worker employment, or even pay workers different
 salaries, without encountering worker resistance.
 Such resistance can seriously impair a manager's
 attempts to improve productivity through promotions,
 bonuses, the hiring and firing of workers, and adjust-
 ing the size of the work force. Workers sometimes
 resent additional income earned by managers, and, in
 at least one case, resisted reforms intended to improve
 productivity because they saw the measures as an
 attempt by the factory director to increase his income
 at their expense. Several managers have told foreign
 observers they were reluctant to accept monetary
 incentives for fear of criticism by workers. To
 strengthen their positions, party secretaries sometimes
 curry favor with the workers, making managers reluc-
 tant to discipline workers for fear of uniting worker
 and party against them.
 Dealing With Higher Authorities
 Closely related to party obstructionism is bureaucrat-
 ic meddling by local government officials reluctant to
 give up their role in enterprises, according to Chinese
 observers. The network of personal and political rela-
 tionships between factory party leaders and the bu-
 reaucracy is extensive, with former factory personnel
 often staffing government and regulatory offices.F_
 Local Financial Assessments. Despite State Council
 rules that local governments should not impose finan-
 cial burdens on factories, many extract additional
 "cash contributions"-for funding local public pro-
 jects, for example-or extort personal favors. One
 factory initially refused to donate an apartment for a
 local registration office, according to the Chinese
 press, but agreed after city officials refused to issue
 marriage licenses to the factory's workers.
 Administrative Meddling. Another form of obstruc-
 tionism comes from administrative "corporations."
 Local officials, unwilling to give up their role in
 production, set up the corporations-ostensibly to
 loosen their control over enterprises, but in effect
 creating another layer of control. One People's Daily
 article said most of the state's large and medium-sized
 enterprises are under the control of these administra-
 tive and semiadministrative companies; although the
 central government has relinquished some of its con-
 trols over industry, such companies have prevented
 the devolution of power from reaching the enterprises
 and continue to interfere in production decisions and
 operations. These corporations severely limit factory
 managers' decisionmaking authority over the hiring
 and firing of workers, supplies, production, and mar-
 keting. Moreover, according to the Chinese press, the
 organizations usually have no assets, but, by calling
 themselves corporations, they can intercept financial
 and material resources intended for factories.
 Beijing has called for an end to such interference, and
 several jurisdictions have announced steps to limit
 these corporations. Industrial bureaus in Chongqing
 have been told to begin providing services instead of
 controlling enterprise activities. In August 1986,
 Shanghai announced it would disband 77 administra-
 tive companies within a year to give factory directors      25X1
 more decisionmaking power in production. It is un-
 clear how much autonomy such factories will have,
 though, since Shanghai's plans also call for some
 plants to form into associations for specialized produc-
 Thousands of factories-many widely publicized in
 the Chinese press-have increased product quality
 and profits through management changes, and these
 successes will encourage other enterprises to try new
 management techniques (see inset).
 The management reform program faces a number of
 significant obstacles, however, that suggest reforms
 over the short term will bring improvements to indus-
 trial productivity and efficiency only at the margin.        25X1
 We believe management reforms will continue as a
 policy initiative, but the ongoing debate over econom-
 ic reforms will delay plans to better define the
 relationships between key players. For example, Beij-
 ing had said it would pass a state enterprise law to
 provide a framework for implementation of bankrupt-
 cy provisions and to define legal and working relation-
 ships between ministries, enterprises, and party offi-
 cials, but in mid-March, the National People's

 A number of trends have emerged that we believe
 indicate Beijing's management modernization pro-
 gram can, over time, address some longstanding
 weaknesses in Chinese enterprises:
 ? Professionalizing management. Focusing attention
 on management as a separate function requiring
 special skills contributes to the establishment of a
 corps of people who think of themselves as manag-
 ers-an important step in overcoming traditional
 ways of thinking about factory performance. Local
 officials also are recognizing the need for trained
 managers and are advertising for persons with
 advanced skills to head factories. Some foreign
 observers also suggest economic logic is slowly
 supplanting administrative reasoning as a basis for
 decisionmaking.
 ? New influences on production decisions. Managers
 responsible for their firms' profits are increasingly
 concerned with productivity and quality control.
 Beijing's expanding network of quality-inspection
 sites further encourages factory directors to take
 quality control seriously; Beijing uses the quality-
 control ratings to determine the distribution of
 some resources, whether enterprises can use "quali-
 ty" award labels on their products to attract con-
 sumers, and managers' remuneration.
 firms rejecting substandard or overpriced
 components and finished goods reflect the addi-
 tional pressure on factories to raise quality and
 improve efficiency. State-sponsored experiments
 with secondhand equipment markets are encourag-
 ing factories to sell unused equipment and to
 consider alternatives to expensive technology im-
 ports.                    factories are beginning
 to use feedback from consumers to guide
 production.
 ? Stimulating innovation and technology absorption.
 The Chinese press has noted several new product
 designs by enterprises undergoing reform.
 better management is slowly improving tec -
 nology absorption.
 managers are becoming
 more interested in doing feasibility studies to assess
 the need for new technology, while preliminary
 training and preparation have greatly improved the
 use of equipment in some cases. One small survey of
 Chinese factories noted that technology import
 offices were being established within enterprises to
 evaluate proposed acquisitions, establish links to
 suppliers of related equipment, and assist in tech-
 nology utilization.

 Congress (NPC) Standing Committee decided not to
 recommend its passage. The Chinese press reported
 that, although most delegates agreed that factory
 managers must have the final say over production
 decisions, they disagreed on the appropriate role and
 authority of party secretaries. Similarly, efforts to use
 a new Ministry of Supervision-agreed upon at the
 November 1986 NPC session-to oversee government
 policy implementation also will proceed more slowly.
 According to US Embassy reporting, this ministry
 was intended to shield factory managers from govern-
 ment interference.
 Meanwhile, the debate will probably cause party
 officials to be even more recalcitrant about following
 reforms, and managers to be more hesitant about
 implementing them. Since January, factory party
 leaders have been delegated to run in-factory propa-
 ganda campaigns to oppose "bourgeois liberalism"-
 China's catchword for excessive Western influences;
 at least some factory directors undoubtedly will seize
 the opportunity to go beyond educational activities to
 more direct involvement in the work of managers.
 most
 factories in Beijing and Shanghai are again holding
 political party meetings that both workers and man-
 agers must attend. Party functionaries also are report-
 edly being added to the staffs in those cities.
 Many of the macroeconomic reforms that are essen-
 tial to factory modernization and management reform
 will probably be slowed or postponed. For example,
 the reformers have already suspended their plans to
 move forward in controversial areas such as price
 reform, which will limit the ability of factory manag-
 ers to improve enterprise performance (see appendix).

 25X1
 In addition to political obstacles, the sheer enormity
 of the task dictates that improving management in
 China's nearly one-half million industrial enterprises
 will take a great deal of time. Training is reaching
 only a fraction of China's managers. The US pro-
 gram, for example, has taught both short and longer
 term courses to only about a thousand Chinese policy-
 makers and industrial managers in five years; the
 Sino-Japanese management center is intended for 150
 students a year. Domestic programs are more numer-
 ous but start small as well. Provincial economic
 management institutes, according to a 1987 press
 report, were designed to train 100,000 managers
 annually-a figure we believe to be greatly inflated.
 Experienced teachers of management also are in short
 supply. In addition, China must train personnel such
 as auditors and statisticians to help implement mod-
 ern management within the factory.
 regardless of training, most                                                                                         25X1
 Chinese managers are slow to grasp the need to be
 results oriented, and are reluctant to make indepen-
 dent decisions and assume responsibility for their

 Macroeconomic Reforms and
 Their Impact on Management
 A number of macroeconomic reforms are essential to
 the success of management modernization.
 Bankruptcy Legislation. The Standing Committee of
 the National People's Congress advanced the effort to
 make enterprises responsible for their performance
 and reduce state subsidies in November 1986 by
 passing China's first bankruptcy law. According to
 US Embassy reporting, the bill's adoption was de-
 layed until its opponents were assured that it con-
 tained: guarantees that workers would receive unem-
 ployment benefits and, eventually, new jobs;
 administrative penalties for managers and bureau-
 crats whose management decisions result in enterprise
 indebtedness; and provisions for complementary laws
 and reforms that place real authority for enterprise
 management decisions in the hands of the managers.
 Formal implementation of the bankruptcy law-origi-
 nally scheduled to occur in June 1987, three months
 after passage of the related state enterprise law-
 apparently has been delayed by the March 1987
 decision of the National People's Congress Standing
 Committee to postpone a decision on the enterprise
 law, although experiments in applying the bankruptcy
 law are under way. The new law is limited in applica-
 tion and retains a significant role for the state-assets
 of closed enterprises will remain state property, and
 the government will play a major role in relocating
 workers-but it will probably help Beijing to compel
 factories to improve operations and accept further
 reforms.
 Price Reform. State control of prices for raw materi-
 als and finished goods continues to hamstring manag-
 ers. For example, companies that relied solely on the
 state for the provision of materials-especially scarce
 ones-now must often pay higher prices because
 subsidies inherent in the state-supply system are
 ending; but the firms have little or no power to pass
 higher production costs on to the consumer. Limits on
 the ability to adjust product prices also reduce the
 incentive for managers to improve the product be-
 cause a better product earns no additional income.
 Beijing has lifted price controls for some consumer
 goods, overplan production, and out-of-plan produc-
 tion. It had planned to continue price reform for
 selected goods in 1987 but now has postponed such
 measures.
 Human Resources. Lack of job mobility and the
 limited supply of skilled workers prevent enterprises
 from acquiring needed managerial and technical
 skills. Even if a factory director recognizes an oppor-
 tunity to change operations, products, or quality,
 finding the personnel qualified to implement the
 changes remains a stumblingblock. For example, a
 Chinese factory wishing to upgrade its product by
 adding electronics would often be unable to hire the
 engineers needed. Beijing has issued regulations in
 recent years giving skilled personnel the freedom to go
 where their talents are needed, and some moves have
 occurred.                             barriers    25X1
 to personnel mobility, such as factory ownership of
 housing, remain strong.
 Labor Reform. A manager trying to improve labor
 productivity and efficiency is hampered by restric-
 tions on the hiring and firing of workers, and on
 adjusting the size and composition of the work force.
 Beijing took an important first step toward reforming
 labor practices in October 1986, when it adopted a
 labor reform package eliminating guaranteed lifetime
 employment for new workers in state factories and
 giving managers additional authority to fire employ-     25X1
 ees. The reforms also create national retirement and
 unemployment systems. According to press reports,
 Beijing will allow enterprises to hire an increased
 share of workers under fixed-term contracts-making
 it easier for factory managers to adjust the size of the
 work force according to production needs. Enterprises
 also are experimenting with additional measures link-
 ing salaries and incentives to worker productivity.
 Implementation of labor reforms, however, will be
 slow.

 Financial Reform. A decrease in state allocations of
 working and investment capital is forcing enterprise
 leaders to search elsewhere for funds. As a result of
 changes in China's banking system, bank loans have
 become an increasingly important source of financ-
 ing.' Beijing also is allowing experiments with issu-
 ance of shares and bonds. In Guangdong, approxi-
 mately 850 enterprises had raised more than 500
 million yuan through securities by the end of 1985. In
 addition, 25 banks in the Shanghai Economic Zone
 set up a short-term capital market and a long-term
 securities market. Controls on foreign exchange re-
 main a problem for many managers, however. Factory
 directors in Sichuan told visiting US officials that
 access to foreign exchange to import technologically
 advanced equipment is their most urgent need.
 Bureaucratic Reforms. Although the state has given
 up some of its direct involvement in industry, manag-
 ers remain constrained by the continued need to seek
 approval from higher authorities for a variety of
 decisions, from technology purchases-especially im-
 ports-to construction projects:
 ? A June 1986 survey of almost 1,600 senior execu-
 tives in Beijing and Tianjin showed that only 103
 had the authority to install a personal computer or a
 microcomputer; only 50 could approve the purchase
 of other office products, such as copiers.
 ? In 1981 a Hunan factory applied for permits to
 begin construction of a beverage bottling plant and
 to import automated equipment. During the next
 five years, the proposal was revised three times,
 reviewed by 60 separate government offices, which
 affixed more than 200 signatures to 200 documents,
 but the proposal was not disapproved or approved.
 An important goal of the "political structural re-
 forms" originally slated to occur during the next
 several years is streamlining China's bloated and
 overlapping bureaucracy, but the reforms also have
 been postponed as a result of the ongoing debate over
 political and economic issues
