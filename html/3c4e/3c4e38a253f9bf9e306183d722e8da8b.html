 The MAC Meeting Revisited
 The political fortunes of certain regional
 military commanders seem to have taken a turn for
 the better recently, but there still may be much
 foreboding within their ranks.  At first blush
 the reappearances of Li Te-sheng, Hsu Shih-yu and
 Han Hsien-chu in the wake of the enlarged meeting
 of the Military Affairs Commission  (MAC)  this
 summer suggests that Mao fared poorly in this
 latest round with the commanders.   There are
 many indications that the Chairman has fought long
 to have at least some of these men removed from
 their posts.  At the same time there are signs
 that the commanders may have taken quite a few
 knocks themselves at the MAC meeting.
 The most important decision the commission
 made was to streamline the army through a net
 reduction in troop strength and an upgrading of
 its capacity for technological warfare.  This
 decision per se does not necessarily cut against
 the interests of regional military leaders.   In
 principle, some may have even favored such a shift.
 The decision, however, may have been taken in
 response to a broadside attack against the military
 by Mao and Teng Hsiao-ping.
 Although the Chairman may not have attended
 the meeting personally, he reportedly sent a mes-
 SI-sage which acrimoniously chastised the PLA for
 being oversized, inefficient, corrupt and
 militarily unprepared.   Indeed, senior cadres in
 China have been told that Mao ordered the rehabil-
 itation of Lo Jui-ching and wants to give military
 training clear priority over political studies.   .
 Teng Hsiao-ping and Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying
 weighed in with similar criticism of the military.

 Teng charged that the army was "obese, arrogant,
 3 insubordinate, lazy, wasteful" and generally un-
 prepared for battle.
 y
 Since they were probably not criticizing members
 of their own general staff, these attacks can easily
 be read as an indictment of the regional military
 commanders who are responsible. for implementing
 policy and keeping the army combat ready.  The
 commanders may also sense a potential threat in
 the MAC order to retire a number of older officers.
 Peking would presumably pass judgment on high-rank-
 ing military region officers and could use the
 order to erode the power base of selected commanders.
 In light of the earbeating administered by Mao and
 Teng, the favorable decision made in the cases of
 Li, Hsu and Han may have looked more like a reprieve
 than a victory.
 Even though Mao and Teng are singing the
 same anti-military tune, their objectives may be
 quite different.  The Chairman, continuing his
 long-standing struggle with certain commanders,
 may well have his sights fixed on a purge.  Only
 a couple of weeks before the opening of the meet-
 ings, a People's Daily article seemed to argue that
 Mao should exercise real rather than titular control
 over the PLA.  Using historical allusion, the
 article claimed that political. and military power
 must be concentrated in the hands of the "supreme
 representative of the central political organs"
 who is a specific individual.  Mao may have seized
 on Teng and Yeh's discontent with the PLA in an
 effort to carry on his offensive against the com-
 manders.  Teng, however, may look at reform of the
 army in an entirely different light.  While keenly
 aware of the military's shortcomings and convinced
 that a major overhaul is necessary, he probably does
 not see a purge--however limited--of regional military
 leaders as part of this process.   In fact, he styles
 himself as conciliator.   In his January speech before

 the Party plenum, Teng remarked that changes in the
 leadership create uneasiness among the populace, and
 at the MAC meeting, he sought to dampen factionalism
 within the PLA.   He put his stamp of approval on a
 pardon for those soldiers cited as "516 elements"
 and on a requirement for lenient treatment of
 3 those who have caused political disorder within
 the army.   In all probability the commanders see
 Teng's broadsides as much less threatening than
 Mao's.
 There is limited evidence that Teng wants to
 put some distance between his position and the
 Chairman's.   If our account of Central Directive
 18 is complete, the vice premier did not choose to
 invoke Mao's authority in announcing the overhaul
 9' of the PLA.   The Chairman in fact sent two messages
 to the MAC meeting, but neither were acknowledged
 in Directive 18.
 The outcome of the Military Affairs Commission
 meeting appears to have been short of decisive
 and may have left a number of military region
 commanders with a deep sense of foreboding about
 Mao's next move.  This political context lends
 some credibility to the view that Mao and elements
 of the military are deeply involved in the current
 criticism of the Chinese novel "Water Margin." Such
 involvement was evident in an August 30 Kuangming
 Daily article which appeared to utilize a historical
 analogy to defend Lin Piao and, by implication,
 attack Mao.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/NO DISSEM

 Appearances and Disappearances
 The festivities surrounding Sihanouk's return
 to Cambodia brought out most members of the Chinese
 leadership, plus a heavy representation from the
 distaff side.  The appearances, however, served to
 highlight several notable absentees.
 Most prominent among the missing were party
 vice chairmen Wang Hung-wen, who may still be in
 Chekiang Province overseeing the return to normality,
 and Yeh Chien-ying, who has not appeared since
 Army Day.  There seems to be no political reason
 for Yeh's non-appearance, but there have been
 occasional rumors that he is not in the best of
 health.

 She apparently made the most of the occas
 wearing makeup for the first time in recent memory,
 downing considerable quantities of Maotai, and in
 general letting everyone know she was there.   She
 was the only major leader attending the Chinese
 banquet, however, who did not attend Sihanouk's
 reciprocal dinner two days later.
 Madame Mao, of course, has not had a good year
 politically since her failure to win a government
 position at last January's National People's
 Congress.  The Chinese people,, apparently sensitive
 o that failure, have circulated numerous rumors
 since then about Mao's displeasure with her.  The
 latest, and perhaps most devastating rumors have it
 that the Politburo voted earlier this year to
 reactivate its decision of the, 1940s to keep her
 out of politics, and that Mao wrote her a letter in
 which he suggested that they go their separate ways
 from now on since they had been going in opposite.
 (presumably political) directions anyway.

 Chiang Ching's one-day reappearance, plus
 public appearances by the wives of Chu Te, Chou
 En-lai, Li Hsien-nien and even Hsu Hsiang-chien
 seemed to underscore the surprising absence of
 it  Cho Lin, wife of Sihanouk's official host, Teng
 I Hsiao-ping.  Cho Lin does not appear on every
 occasion at which her busy husband is top man,
 but the presence of so many other wives made her
 (absence all the more conspicuous.  There is no
 ready explanation for her non-appearance, but it
 is at least possible that it has some connection
 with the current attacks on "Water Margin."  If
 the novel's leading figure, who is attacked for
 accepting a royal amnesty and seeking official
 positions for his wife and son, is intended by
 some to represent the rehabilitated Teng Hsiao-ping,
 Madame Teng may prefer for the time being to
 maintain a low profile.   She currently holds an
 unspecified position in the government.   (SECRET

 Vietnam:  A Quiet Anniversary
 Peking's subdued treatment of Hanoi's National
 Day early this month reflects continuing friction
 between the two countries, whale clearly pointing
 up Chinese concern that Hanoi is falling under Mos-
 cow's domination.
 The celebrations in Hanoi, marking the 30th
 panniversary of the communist government's founding,
 called for high-level Chinese attention, but Peking
 appears to have played down the importance of the
 event as well as the current status of China's re-
 lations with North Vietnam.
 Neither the message from Chinese leaders nor
 the People's Daily editorial marking the occasion
 included the enthusiastic expressions of Sino-
 Vietnamese solidarity that were features of Chinese
 statements during the war.  Thus, there was no men-
 tion of Peking's "proletarian internationalist duty"
 to support Hanoi; no depiction of the Sino-Vietna-
 mese relationship as being "as close as lips and
 teeth"; no references to "sharing weal and woe";
 no mention of the application of Marxist-Leninist
 principles in Vietnam.
 by at least three politbureau members and Chou En-
 lai delivered speeches on both occasions.  This year,
 there was no rally and politbureau member Wu Te was
 the speaker at the embassy reception.
 he Chinese held rallies marking the 20th and 25th
 nniversaries of the DRV.  Moreover, receptions at
 he North Vietnamese embassy those years were attended
 Although China sent a fairly high-level dele-
 gation led by politbureau member Chen Hsi-lien to
 Hanoi, the Chinese in Peking displayed a clear lack
 of enthusiasm for the anniversary.   in 1965 and 1970,

 Chen Hsi-lien,  in a speech delivered at a Viet-
 namese iron and steel complex, did pull out most of
 he stops in describing Peking's ties with Hanoi,
 eferring to China's "internationalist obligation"
 to support the Vietnamese and to the Vietnamese as
 "close comrades-in-arms and brothers."  Still, Chen's
 remarks in Hanoi are almost certainly not as authori-
 tative as the People's Daily editorial and the message
 that was signed by both Mao Tse-tung and Chou.
 More important, however, Chen took the oppor-
 tunity to lecture the Vietnamese on the dangers of
 Soviet machinations in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.
 Without mentioning the Soviets by name, Chen warned
 D the Vietnamese that "the superpowers" were attempt-
 ing to dominate other countries, especially in the
 Third World.   Chen asserted that China, itself a
 Third World country, would never attempt to estab-
 lish hegemony over other countries, obviously con-
 trasting China's allegedly benevolent view of South-
 east Asia with what Peking considers to be Moscow's
 dark designs on the area.   He said China stood by
 other developing countries in opposition to "super-
 power aggression, intervention, control, subversion
 and plundering."
 The Chinese have in several recent private con-
 versations expressed a conviction that Hanoi has
 ilted toward Moscow.   They obviously hope, however,
 to increase their own leverage with the Vietnamese
 and to continue to draw Hanoi's attention to the
 darker side of Soviet intentions.  That clearly was
 O Chen's objective in asserting that Peking does not
 interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,
 as well as his comment that China had supported
 Hanoi "to the best of our ability," thus reminding
 the Vietnamese that they still owe China for past
 favors.
 How much confidence Peking actually has in its
 bility to improve ties with Hanoi, to say nothing

 of effectively countering Soviet influence in Viet-
 nam, is another question.                        have
 reported recently that Chinese o  icia s  e ieve
 their relations with North Vietnam are "worsening."

 assertions that Kwan si Province was Vietnamese

 Differences of opinion over territorial claims
 in the South China Sea have been clear for some
 time--especially since Peking assumed full control
 Vientam-Kwangsi border to their original locations
 If issues such as these continue to surface, the
 possibility of any significant improvement in rela-
 tions between the two countries will remain remote.
 In internal briefings, the Chinese have often por-
 trayed problems with Hanoi as resulting from Soviet
 "meddling," probably in order to disguise the
 seriousness of Peking's difficulties with Hanoi.
 Over the long run, however, the Chinese view of
 Hanoi as a challenger to Peking's own influence in
 Southeast Asia--especially one that has Soviet
 backing--could mean that relations between the two
 countries will deteriorate even further.   (SECRET

 Sayonara, Sihanouk
 After five tumultuous years, Prince Sihanouk
 ended his..exile in Peking last week and returned to
 Phnom Penh.   The Chinese gave every indication that
 they were pleased with the arrangements.
 Peking's endorsement of Sihanouk's return was
 evident in the turnout at farewell banquets in Peking
 and at his airport sendoff.  More top-level Chinese
 /~ officials attended these affairs than any event
 01 01 honoring a foreign visitor since Kim I1-song was in
 Peking last April.  Moreover, the Chinese heaped
 praise on Sihanouk for his past role in Cambodia's
 "liberation" and expressed the hope that he "will
 make still greater contributions" after returning to
 the Cambodian capital.   Sihanouk also had final
 meetings with both Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai.
 While the Chinese are clearly happy to have
 Sihanouk out of their hair and back in Cambodia with
 at least a nominal title--as "head-of-state"--Peking
 almost certainly recognizes that the Prince is not
 likely to have a significant voice in Cambodian af-
 fairs.  Peking, therefore, has been careful not to
 jeopardize its equities with the ruling Cambodian
 communists by arguing for a more important role for
 Sihanouk.   Since the end of the fighting in Cambodia
 and Vietnam, the Chinese have concentrated their
 attention on Cambodia and their ties with the new
 communist regime appear to be closer than those with
 ny other Indochinese country.  The Chinese ambassador
 to Cambodia arrived in Phnom Penh last Wednesday,
 the first foreign envoy to take up his post since
 the communists took over last April.
 Expressions of support for Sihanouk seem aimed
 rimarily at avoiding the impression that Peking has

 CA
 dumped him, as well as being a gentle reminder to
 the Prince that he has an obligation to the new
 regime in Phnom Penh.         Chinese leaders were almost
 certainly concerned that Sihanouk, whose difficulties
 with the communists have been well known since the
 mid-1960s, might break with the new leaders and
 relocate in another country, where he could criticize
 them through his many contacts in the foreign press..
 This development, which Sihanouk himself has hinted
 at in the past, would force Peking to side with their
 new ally in Phnom Penh against the Prince and might
 seriously embarrass Peking.
 Peking's treatment of Sihanouk's departure in
 itself does not, of course, commit the Prince to a
 long-term alliance with the communists.  His current
 stay in Phnom Penh will apparently be a brief one,
 after which he plans to travel for several weeks,
 probably as a "senior spokesman" for the new regime.
 Reportedly included in his itinerary are trips to
 Peking for the October 1 National Day celebrations
 and for his birthday in late October.  The Chinese
 will probably use these occasions to reiterate their
 hope that the Prince will continue to cooperate with
 the communists.   (CONFIDENTIAL NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 Bourgeois Rights:   Right or Wrong?
 Local authorities still seem to be in a
 quandary over how to implement the so-called
 restriction of bourgeois rights--the various
 ncentive measures including private plots, side-
 ine production, and free markets.  The restriction
 of free markets, where farmers can sell produce
 they have grown privately, seems to be especially
 controversial.
 The reaction in Canton to the alleged closure
 F  of free markets as of July 1 was not at all
 7 favorable.   It is still not certain whether the
 markets were closed entirely, as they have report-
 ntedly been in other areas, or whether the number
 of days they were allowed to operate was severely
 r^ restricted.   In any case, Canton residents
 eportedly lobbied for looser restrictions on the
 arkets, and they have apparently been successful.
 A Kwangtung provincial document reportedly
 authorized the reopening of the free markets in
 15attribute anton on August 1.  The official explanation was
 hat the closure of the markets had prevented the
 easants from exchanging their products for other
 eeded goods.  Most Canton residents apparently
 the reopening of the markets to popular
 ressure.
 The turnabout on the Canton free markets
 I           raphically illustrates not only the ability of
 ordinary people to influence events when sufficient
 pressure is applied but also the uncertainty among
 local officials over how to handle such issues.
 It is not at all clear that Kwangtung officials
 had authorization from Peking to close the markets,
 in the first place.   In fact, recent propaganda,
 especially an article written by the Ministry

 the "wind of communization," as did vice premier
 Chang Chun-chiao last April.
 The return of the "wind of communization"
 theme suggests that some elements in the leader-
 ship, mindful that popular discontent over economic
 policy will. likely lead to further production
 disruptions, do not want to make rash changes in
 current policy and are not pleased with those who
 have done so.  As with so many other issues, how-
 ever, the leadership in Peking is probably not of
 one mind over how to proceed with "restricting"
 bourgeois rights.   It seems likely that some
 h
 people are arguing for tighter  restric  io ns ,  w+h-L c
 may have accounted for the free market closures,
 the reduction in the size of private plots and
 in some cases confiscation of the plots.   (SECRET

 Location of Industrial Plants
 China has apparently changed its policy for
 siting industrial plants.           For the past few years,
 major new industrial installations have been built
 on flat, accessible terrain rather than in remote
 mountainous areas.  This policy apparently recognizes
 that the construction of facilities in more acces-
 sible areas will cut the time and cost of construc-
 tion, improve access to transportation facilities,
 and, in many cases, eliminate the need to build new
 housing and support facilities.
 re-
 cently admitted that the old policy was a costly
 L,, error that slowed industrial development.  They in-
 dicated, for example, that the location of the Peking
 petroleum complex--China's largest--in the mountains
 southwest of the capital caused construction delays
 and greatly reduced the efficLency of the plant.
 During the 1960s many industrial plants were
 dispersed in rugged mountainous terrain away from
 population centers, in accordance with a directive
 from the Military Affairs Committee in Peking.   Em-
 phasis was placed on defense against air attack and
 on preventing observation from rail and road net-
 works.
 The period when this policy was at its height
 corresponds with the period Lain Piao was defense
 2 minister (1959-1971) and defense spending was high
 (1965-1971).  Military procurement dropped off
 sharply after the coup attempt by Lin in 1971.
 China may now consider its growing nuclear   .
 arsenal a sufficient deterrent, so that an industrial

 Minority Problems in the Provinces
 Until recently it appeared that the leader-
 ship's special efforts in the minority areas had
 largely contained the problems evident in the
 1950s and early 1960s.  Part of this relative
 success was due to the concessions made by the
 center--exemption from the two child limit of
 the national birth control policy, preservation
 of minority languages, establishment of minority
 publications, industries to produce special mi-
 nority goods, and a privileged status in terms
 of university entrance.
 Another aspect of Peking's minority policy,
 however, has been the leadership's effort to move
 Han Chinese--especially demobilized servicemen
 and youth--into minority regions.  This approach
 has the positive effect of diluting large con-
 centrations of minorities but the negative effect
 of alienating much of the native population, which
 fears it will be swamped by an influx of Hans.
 In fact, recent reports indicate that serious
 problems have developed among the Huis in Yunnan
 5            and Kweichou.  Attempts by provincial leaders, the
 ti  majority of whom are Han Chinese, to curtail Huis
 religious practices are responsible for these
 7problems.   The latest incidents in Yunnan were
 triggered when the leadership tried to force the
 Huis, who are Muslims, to work on Fridays.  The
 Huis retaliated by trying to raid a PLA armory.
 Equally serious, dissident Huis in Kweichou
 recently presented a visiting United Nations team
 with a petition requesting an examination of the
 right of self-determination.

 Other incidents, moreover, go well beyond
 earlier protests, which were characterized by
 poster campaigns and street demonstrations.
 These new activities--cutting a railroad line,
 production sabotage, and armed clashes--tend to
 erode Peking's authority over these minorities.
 The incidents in Yunnan have already triggered a
 strong response--the ringleaders of the raid on
 / the armory have been arrested and intensive
 ideological study is being carried out among the
 Huis.   The last attempts at "armed rebellion" by
 q Huis in Ningsia in 1974 were quelled by PLA troops.
 Given the strong response by Peking in the
 Chekiang case, it is likely that any new outbreak
 of dissidence will bring a strong response from
 Peking.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM)

 Gleanings from the Special Session
 Peking is keeping its own counsel on US and
 ~j     European proposals to the recently concluded UN
 Special Session.   In his keynote address to the
 special session on September 2--the day after the
 US presentation--Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
 Li Chiang hewed to Peking's canned line of blaming
 the superpowers for Third World economic ills,
 warning of continued superpower--primarily Soviet--
 efforts at world economic domination, and expressing
 Chinese support for general Third World aspirations.
 There were, however, some suggestions in the
 speech that the Chinese hope that the session will
 result in an easing of tensions between developing
 and developed countries.  Li, for example, spoke
 approvingly of a "positive attitude" on the part of
 the "Second World," an apparent reference to the
 Lome agreement to stabilize earnings of some products
 exported by 46 developing countries associated with
 the EC.   The Chinese lauded the Lome agreement when
 it was signed last spring, and for some time have
 been apprehensive that Western Europe--which Peking
 claims is the frontline in the struggle against
 "Soviet hegemonism"--would be weakened the most by
 continued world economic disorders.
 At the same time, Li's speech appeared to signal
 that China will continue to avoid an active role in
 any mechanism or agreements designed to satisfy
 Third World demands.   In this regard, Li appeared
 to rule out Chinese contributions to any world food
 stocks by stressing China's example of "self-
 reliance."  Peking has declined invitations to join
 such international bodies as the World Food Council
 and the Food and Agricultural Organization largely
 because membership entails the divulgence of economic
 statistics the Chinese consider vital state secrets.

 Similarly, Li's failure to make even an oblique
 reference to the US proposal for a multinational
 fund to aid developing countries most severely
 affected by world market fluctuations--a concept
 3             the Chinese support in the abstract--undoubtedly
 reflects Peking's wariness of being drawn-into such
 potentially expensive endeavors.
 3
 Despite any reservations Peking may have over
 any particular stand taken by developing countries in
 the special session, Peking can be expected to con-
 tinue lending strong vocal support to their cause.
 China continues to see a unified Third World as a
 means of diffusing superpower--primarily Soviet--in-
 fluence on the world scene and thereby create openings
 that China can exploit to increase its own prestige
 and influence as a world power.   (CONFIDENTIAL)
