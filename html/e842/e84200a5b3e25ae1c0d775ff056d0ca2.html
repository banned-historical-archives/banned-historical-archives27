SQXETIFIC AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGE PROPOSALS 
General t ackground and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
The Chinese have already demonstrated their willingness to admit 
American scientists and medical doctors to the FRC. Several distinguished 
men in these fields have already been warmly received by Chou En-lai 
himself and have been permitted to travel to a variety of scientific and 
manufacturing institutions. It is likely that more such American visitors 
will be permitted, and the PRC may be willing to agree to initiate 
exchanges at least in those fields where they have unique contributions 
and experience, e. g.: 
Medicine (acupuncture, skin grafts, reattaching severed limbs, 
abortion, treatment of special diseases, medical administration 
and "barefoot doctors") 
Z. Agriculture (new seeds, new strains, better use of fertilizer, 
denser planting). 
3. Applied science (reflecting a two-way flow between university

and factory).

chemical synthesis, ecology and environment (recovery and recycling of 
industrial and societal wastes), marine resource utilization, earth 
resources sensing satellites, meteorology and computer-aided orthography  
handling. 
If Chou En-lai shows a willingness to open scientific and technical 
exchanges, you may wish to propose a formal government-to-government 
agreement using Sections II, III, V, VI and IX of the Model Agreement 
(at Tab B). If he prefers an alternate vehicle, you could propose a 
Joint Announcement on Exchanges drawing on the text of the Draft Joint 
Announcement '(at Tab C). 
(Special care should be taken to avoid offering the Chinese aid or 
charity, given their deep sensitiitrities in dealing with a power which is 
vastly superior in its over-all scientific and technical capacities.) 
In either instance exchanges could be negotiated between governmental 
or quasi-official institutions, e. g., the Chinese Academy of Sciences and 
our National Academy of $citIndeteilor on our side by individual institutions 
or a non-official clearing house such as the Committee on Scholarly 
Communication with the PRC which is under the jointssponsor ship of the 
National Academy of Sciences, the American Council of Learned Societies 
and the Social Science Research Council. In any event, the PRC will 
01111 probably not negotiate or participate with any institution which has direct 
- links with Taiwan. 
A reference to the utility of scientific and technical exchanges is 
included in the text of our Draft Joint Cram-mininiip._

PROPOSAL ON EARTH RESOURCES SENSING SATELLITES  
That the United States of America and the People's Republic of 
China enter into a cooperative experimental program in the application 
of satellite-derived earth-sensing data for geological and hydrological 
prospecting and. for agricultural survey purposes. 
We are Prepared To: 
-- Make available to appropriate institutions of the People's 
Republic of China plans and proposed experimental programs 
for an American earth resources sensing satellite.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
Earth resources sensing data could be very valuable to the Chinese 
in the areas of natural resources, water supply, and agriculture. At 
one time, they were cooperating closely with the Russians in land-based 
geological prospecting technologies and would still have a great interest 
in improved techniques for locating their natural resources. 
The experimental earth resources sensing satellite ERTS-A will 
be flown in March 1972 or shortly thereafter. It would be possible for 
the Chinese to construct a data collection system for direct readout of 
data from this satellite. Much experience will have to be gained in using 
ERTS data for practical purposes and the Chinese could contribute so-called 
"ground truth" information in a truly cooperative effort to refine the 
techniques involved. 
Note of Caution: The Chinese have been in the past very sensitive 
to overflights of U.S. satellites over their territory, even when we have 
informed them through Warsaw of a given payload's purely scientific 
purpose. Referring to ERTS-A will also tell them that a U.S. earth 
sensing satellite will be able to survey their territory whether they like 
it or not. Hence, this proposal, while very attractive as an operational 
program, could be politically hazardous to suggest.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
Fragmentary reports have reached the West that the Chinese 
have developed remarkable techniques for  treatment of severe burn  
victims  as well as for  reattaching severed limbs. Each of these 
developments would reflect great credit upon the surgical teams that 
developed the procedures. There are conversely very probably, areas 
of surgical practice in the United States in which the Chinese would have 
special interest. 
The United States could assemble some specialist teams to visit 
China and study the surgical procedures in question in detail. 
In return the Chinese could suggest specialty surgical or clinical 
areas to us in which they would like to send teams to the United States.

matters as a first step toward direct cooperation in achieving solutions 
for specific environmental problems. 
We are Prepared To:

Backgroluld and Evidence of Chinese Interest 
Chou En-lai has personally mentioned Chinese concern for 
protection of the environment and the natural ecology of the planet. 
The Chinese have set a remarkable example for other nations in the 
recovery and recycling of a wide variety of materials from industrial 
and societal wastes. Chinese efforts in this field could have important 
implications for over-all resource conservation in all countries. 
Interdisciplinary teams of environmental specialists from each 
side would be exchanged for the purpose of identifying specific areas 
of common interest. Specific research teams would then be developed 
by each side. Air pollution, water pollution, waste recovery and recycling, 
and sanitary engineering would be areas of high priority. 
The Chinese could learn from cooperating with the United States 
what kinds of environmental problems they may face in the future with 
increased industrialization and urben congestion. They could also draw 
on existing United States technology for solutions to specific problems. 
The United States might learn of entirely new approaches to 
problems of waste handling, recycling, resource conservation and 
pollution control, which could be of great value and importance when 
applied in the United States.

PROPOSAL ON COMPUTER-AIDED ORTHOGRAPHY-HANDLING 
That the United States of America and the People's Republic of 
China jointly undertake the development of an efficient computer-aided 
system for handling Chinese orthography. 
Because of differences in the structure of the languages of our 
respective countries, American researchers have been interested in 
developing computer-aided techniques for easing problems of translation 
and dictionary work in order to facilitate communication. For example, 
Dr. Susumu Kuno of Harvard University has developed a computerized 
system for handling about 11,000 Chinese characters. The characters 
are drawn by an automatic plotting machine from simple straight-line 
segments. However, the readability of the text from his system has 
not been adequately tested, nor have improved character sets been 
investigated. 
We are Paepared To: 
? Exchange delegations of specialists in problems of linguistic 
research and computer technology to share information and 
develop cooperative research programs in this area. 
-- Provide samples of the character printouts from some of the 
present experimental American systems.

PROPOSAL ON EXCHANGES OF SPECIFIC DELEGATIONS  
IN SCIENTIFIC AND SCHOLARLY AREAS  
Following is a list of possible exchanges of delegations designed to 
develop contacts between our two countries in a variety of important areas. 
In each case we are prepared to facilitate the exchange of delegations as 
soon as it is convenient for organizations of the People's? Republic of China 
concerned to do so. 
1. The convening of a meeting of representatives of the National 
Academy of Sciences with representatives of the Chinese Academy of Sciences 
has been proposed in a letter from American Academy President Handler 
to the Chinese Academy. Such a meeting might facilitate a number of pro-
posed scholarly and scientific exchanges. We endorse the holding of this 
meeting should it be convenient for the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
2. The American Museum of Natural History wishes to collaborate with 
Chinese anthropologists in attempting to relocate the bones of Peking Man. 
3. The Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago and the Smith-
sonian Institution would like to join with Chinese scholars in archeological 
and anthropological studies in China. 
4. A number of United States universities would like to invite Dr. Kuo 
Mo-Jo President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to lecture on his 
work on the tortoise shell inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty.

2 
Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest 
The U.S. now has access to some Chinese weather data transmitted 
by radio in the internationally recognized SMO code. China's heavy 
dependence on agriculture indicates their need for the best possible 
weather information and their provision of this data via the WMO system 
even during difficult political times in China confirms this interest. 
The Chinese might construct simply APT ground equipment for 
obtaining direct readout of cloud cover data from U.S. weather satellites 
of the TIROS operational system as well as some channels from the 
NIMBUS series of experimental satellites. Collaboration with the US. 
would aim at refined interpretation and use of this data. Strong Chinese 
theoretical competence could yield valuable contributions in this area. 
Note: It is possible that the Chinese have already built their own 
APT receivers without telling us, from information available in the 
literature. 
The U.S. has developed tentative plans to move its Operation 
Storm Furypprogram (a study of the effects of seeding hurricanes) to 
the Pacific Ocean, where the greater incidence of seedable typhoons, 
as compared to Atlantic hurricanes, offers a chance of increased 
opportunities to conduct experiements. An early plan called for proposals 
by the U. S. to the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan to cooperate with us in 
this experimental effort. 
There is a finite danger that seeding a storm may increase its

intensity rather than decrease it. Furthermore, a large number of 
Pacific origin typhoons eventually strike the Chinese mainland, 
suggesting that any such program could not be carried out without 
prior consultation, or perhaps even some cooperation, with the Chinese. 
Not only is this subject complicated by involvement with Taiwan, 
but within the last days, Japan has allegedly protested against any 
experimentation of this kind by the U.S. in the Pacific area. In 
conclusion, the fate of the U.S. proposal to move Storm Fury to the 
Pacific looks very uncertain; but in any case, if it should be moved, 
some consultation and maylicie even an offer of cooperation with China 
would have to be considered.

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
A vital problem for the Chinese is the efficient handling of their 
complicated system of orthography. They have reportedly made some 
progress in developing a Chinese typewriter, as well as a telegraphic 
means of transmitting their language characters, although details are 
unknown in the West. It can be assured, however, that further improve-
ments in systems for handling Chinese orthography would be of great 
value to them. 
American scientists have been applying sophisticated computerized 
techniques to the problems of handling symbol sysAms with large 
numbers of individual characters, such as complicated mathematical 
equations and Chinese orthography. Challenging research problems 
are encountered at the man-machine interface and in producing a final 
result that is graphically meaningful. 
The Chinese should have ideas and practical knowledge which would 
be most valuable to the American scientists and technologists in their 
research and development of these computerized systems. If these 
systems were useful to the Chinese, this would be an excellent introduction 
for them to American computer equipment and techniques. 
We would enable the Chinese to avoid the efforts and costs of 
research work in developing prototype systems for the computerized 
handling of Chinese orthography. This would be accomplished by inviting 
Chinese scientists to work at American universities and institutions, which 
have already developed prototype systems. The Chinese would benefit

from actual experience in using and evaluating these systems and would 
then be better able to produce their own versions. The Americans 
would benefit from the comments and criticisms of actual potential 
users of the products of their research and development. 
Note: Computers and automatic plotters of a certain capacity 
are presently embargoed for sale to China. However, the objective 
of this proposal is to help the Chinese in eliminating costly exploratory 
research and evaluation; the Chinese could then produce their own 
special purpose systems.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
It is apparent that with their long coastline the Chinese have a 
deep interest in the development of their marine resources. Their 
fish catch, for example, exceeds that of the U.S. , and they are actively 
pursuing the search for oil on their continental shelf. They are 
reportedly embarking on a significant shipbuilding program, and they 
operate several research institutes working in the marine sciences. 
Scripps Oceanographic Institution in the U. S. has been sending 
its publications to the Amoy Oceanographic Institute for some time, 
although there has been no reciprocal gesture by the Chinese. This 
means, however, there is at least some knowledge base in China of 
U.S. work in this area. 
U.S. marine science work is high quality and broad in coverage. 
An excellent itinerary could be prepared for a visiting Chinese delegation 
to this country. On the basis of exchanges of delegations, it might be

? Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
In the early 1960s the Chinese shared with the West Germans the 
distinction of synthesizing insulin for the first time. Little is presently 
known in the West of the activities of the group in Shanghai which 
accomplished this feat. It is apparent, however, that the Chinese had 
made a stron.g effort in biochemistry at that time and that their protein 
synthesis work was at a high level of competence. This group had 
close contacts with Westerners before the Cultural Revolution and it 
is possible that they would welcome a re-establishment of contacts 
with Americans at this time. 
The first step in establishing contact could be an exchange of 
delegations. The United States could assemble a highly distinguished 
team consisting of such investigators as; Robert Merrifield of 
Rockefeller University (polypeptide synthesis); and William S. Johnson 
and Paul Berg, both of Stanford, to visit Chinese laboratories, to meet 
their scientists and to assess the potential of collaborative programs. 
As to these initial exploratory visits, invitations for exchange of 
individual researchers could be issued promptly. 
The Chinese would stand to benefit greatly from a United States 
invitation to visit the best United States institutions and groups working 
in chemical synthesis of natural compounds. The Chinese could 
familiarize themselves with the latest and most advanced tools of the 
synthetic chemist, which abound in this country, but are likely in very

ment of existing practices in both countries and the achievement of 
higher crop yields. 
We are Prepared To:

to explore possibilities for cooperative research. 
? Supply literature and technical information on United States 
agricultural techniques in crop areas of interest to researchers 
in agronomy from the People's Republic of China. Such crops 
might include soybeans and other oil seeds, sorghums, wheat

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest 2 
Chinese progress in solving their food problem has been 
considerable. Several-fold increases of yields for some crops have 
been achieved in the last 20 years. Recent visitors to China have 
reported the awareness and pride of the peasants in these accomplish-
ments. However, recorded average yields are still below those 
obtained for the same crops in the U.S. Even Chou En-lai has spoken 
to visitors of China's interest in U. S. agricultural technologies. 
Agriculture will continue to be a top Chinese priority for many years. 
The Chinese have accomplishments to show in the hygienic use 
of organic fertilizers. This subject could have important implications 
for the United States. Hence, it is a field in which the Chinese could 
make a specific technical contribution to U.S. knowledge. The U. S. 
would welcome an invitation to send a group of fertilizer specialists 
to China. A cooperative program could develop in the preparation and 
application of these fertilizers to specific crops. Trade relations 
may subsequently develop in this area. 
The U.S. is interested in arranging visits for Chinese specialists 
to leading U.S. universities, laboratories, field stations, and farms, 
where important advances in agricultural technologies are represented. 
Specific itineraries could be arranged for observing U.S. production, 
storage and marketing techniques for crops such as soybeans, wheat, 
corn, rice or others, as the Chinese may select. The purpose of the 
visits would be to exchange information and identify interests which could 
be developed into cooperative programs.

We are Prepared To: 
- Exchange delegations of researchers in the area of plant 
breeding.

strains of soybeans and other oilseed crops, sorghums, wheat 
and rice. Some 10-15 different samples could be provided.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
The secret of the Green Revolution has been the application of plant 
breeding techniques to the development of new strains of wheat and rice 
with desirable yield, hardiness, and disease resistance characteristics, 
making possible great increases in crop yields. It is reported that the 
Chinese have been active and successful in these areas. However, 
access to American germ plasm pools would increase greatly the source 
materials from which they might draw for crossing experiments and 
further study. 
China is also believed to be the primary or secondary center of 
origin of a number of important plant species, including soybeans, 
sorghums, waxey corn, leafy vegetables, peaches, apples, pears, certain 
citrus fruits, ornamentals known for their resistance to cold, and 
Camptopeca--a plant which yields an extract now being investigated by 
NIH as a possible anti-cancer drug. 
Strong interest in specific Chinese plantiEnow exists among U.S. 
plant breeders and geneticists. Small germ plasm exploration and 
collection teams would welcome a chance to visit China in each of the 
plant areas mentioned above. Cooperative programs and long-lasting 
contacts would develop from the experiments with the germ plasm obtained 
illin China. Dr. Fred Hough of Rutgers University would be ready to begin 
experiments with unique apple strains indigenous to northeast China.

universities and research laboratories working in this field. We hope 
that from these contacts and conversations will develop additional visits, 
exchanges of seeds (germ plasm) and the kind of communication which 
will lead to joint plant breeding programs.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest 2 
The Chinese use extensively this traditional form of medicine in 
connection with modern surgery. It is a technique based on the insertion 
of thin needles into the body. Recent Western visitors have looked at 
acupuncture closely enough to conclude it is neither a hoax nor hypnosis 
and that it represents a physiological phenomenon, whose scientific 
basis is not understood. The Chinese seem proud of their successes 
in this field and have shown them to many Western visitors. Further-
more, it is reported that many research institutes throughout China 
are currently investigating the scientific basis of acupuncture. 
A cooperative program together with U.S. medical researchers 
would give the Chinese access to a wide range of sophisticated 
electronic and biomedical instrumentation, which their more limited 
resources would likely not provide. The Chinese would bring invaluable 
clinical experience with the procedure to the cooperative venture. This 
combination of capabilities brought to bear on the problem would give 
a high probability of early success. Furthermore, resulting joint 
publications of U. S. and Chinese investigators could be an important 
symbol of a new U.S. -China relationship. 
A first step toward establishing the program would be to seek an 
invitation for a multi-disciplinary team of U. S. specialists in pain 
physiology, anesthesia, and experimental pathology, along with 
biochemists, internists, and psychiatrists to spend at least one month 
in China examining the acupuncture procedure in detail. Contact would

also be made with the research institutes in China working to understand 
the scientific basis. A return visit to the U.S. by a Chinese group 
could provide the occasion for consideration of a joint research plan, 
perhaps at a U.S. -Chinese Bilateral Seminar on Acupuncture. 
The Chinese will be exposed to the most modern, highly instrumented 
approaches to research, which should be of great interest to them. 
The U.S. may discover important new physiological principles 
in this ancient form of Chinese medicine.

the active principles and their modes of action. 
We are Prepared To:

of Harvard), pharmacologists (3. Burns of Hoffman-LaRoche), 
and experimental pathologists (Louis Thomas of Yale), and

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
In talking. with Western visitors, the Chinese have shown great 
pride in the successes of their traditional Chinese medicine, which 
utilizes many exotic preparations from indigenous herbs. However, 
the scientific underpinnings of these traditional techniques are yet 
to be elucidated. Active principles and their chemical structures 
may be completely unknown. Chinese interest in both the scientific 
and the practical aspects of medicine would suggest this to be an 
attractive area for cooperative work. 
The Ara stepwou1dhave to be a visit to China by a multi-
disciplinary U. S. team to examine in detail the kinds of materials 
in use, their plant origins and their mode of application. Subsequently, 
a Chinese delegation could visit a series of U. S. laboratories specializing 
in analysis, testing, and synthesis of pharmaceutical materials. Such a 
visit would provide an opportunity for the Chinese to update their 
knowledge of modern laboratory equipment. If they chose to move ahead 
with a cooperative program, access to such instruments for use in the 
U. S. could be assured. If the program were successful, joint U. S. - 
Chinese teams could work on extraction, preparation, separation, 
analysis, structure determination and testing. There might even be 
opportunities for joint commercial exploitation of active materials, if 
any were identified as therapeutically useful.

Backgrounct and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
Population control is a high priority program in China. The birth 
rate has been lowered significantly in the past 20 years, and the Chinese 
tell Western visitors that they expect it to drop further in the future. 
Many methods of contraception are in use. Because research on fertility 
control is also a high priority program in the U.S. , as well as a 
pivotal program for development aid activities throughout the world, it 
is likely that the Chinese would welcome contacts with the U. S. workers 
in this field. 
The Chinese May have unique clinical experience applicable in the 
U.S. The Chinese will likely be very interested in contact with U. S. 
institutions doing basic research work on fertility control. 
Note of Caution: Any implication that the U.S. is seeking to 
reduce the population of China through the subterfuge of research 
programs should be avoided in presenting this proposal.

2 
Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest 
The parasitic disease, schistosomiasis, affects millions of 
people throughout the world by producing chronic debility and eventual 
death. At one time, one of the great centers of pandemic infection was 
the Yangtse River Valley in China. It is reported that through a 
conventional, labor-intensive snail eradication program, China has 
greatly improved this situation. Reports have also been received of 
the existence of a Chinese treatment for sufferers from the disease. 
In the West, no safe and effective drug is known for treating infected 
individuals. Estimates of victims of the disease in China extend up 
to 100 million people. Mao himself has written a poem describing 
the cirulence of the disease. Although schistosomiasis is not a 
problem in the United States, research on the disease has been under-
way for some years, both because of the extent of the infection in 
tropical areas abroad and because of its unique immunological and 
biochemical characteristics. 
Little currently is known in the West about the present extent 
and nature of the infection in China. Any program would have to begin 
with an exchange of specialist teams. The U.S. approach would be 
novel in that we would include representatives of the fields of molecular 
biology and gerietics, which have not traditionally been involved in 
research on parasitic diseases. We would propose Nobel Prize winner, 
Joshua Lederberg, as U.S. delegation leader. We believe that the area

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
3 
of parasitic disease may be ripe for unique contributions from the newer 
biomedical disciplines. This would provide for the Chinese, with their 
strong biomedical tradition and an unknown level of competence in 
molecular biology, a chance to make contact with one of the fastest-
moving and exciting scientific fields in America. 
There have also been recent eeports from Johns Hopkins University 
and the Squibb Pharmaceutical Company that a newly-developed anti-
schistosome drug shows some promise and could perhaps be made 
available for clinical testing. 
Note of Caution: Any implication should be avoided that the U. S. 
is seeking to use Chinese subjects as "guinea pigs" for chemical testing. 
A Chinese team visiting the U.S. could be the beginning of an 
exchange of individual researchers between the U.S. and Chinese 
laboratories. The Chinese could also provide information on the 
effectiveness of their brute-force snail eradication program. 
At a later time these contacts could be expanded into other areas 
of parasitic disease. 
Note of Caution: One complicating factor in the area of 
schistosomiasis is that a very fruitful cooperative research program 
has been underway with Japan for some 6 years, as part of a broader 
medical cooperation activity directed toward diseases of third countries 
in Asia. Attention might be given to the possibility of making the U.S. - 
Japan program into a trilateral effort to include China or, alternatively,

starting a separate program with the Chinese independent of the on-

politically undesirable to appear to be downgrading the U. S. -Japanese 
cooperation in any way or to be dumping the Japanese in favor of the 
Chinese.

Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
This country shares with China the problems of delivering medical 
care to remote areas, of organizing emergency care facilities, of 
encouraging patients to seek medical aid early in the course of an 
illness, and of conserving scarce resources of medically-trained 
manpower by effectively training and utilizing para-medical personnel. 
Fragmentary reports suggest that the Chinese have made great achieve-
ments in this area, including unique and effective organization of their 
hospital system, although detailed knowledge is lacking. It appears 
from reports of Western visitors that the Chinese are pleased and 
proud to show their achievements in these areas. 
A multi-disciplinary team of U.S. specialists should spend a 
month or more in China. The University of Michigan's Dr. Lin Tsung Yi 
( a native-born Taiwanese ) could play an important role in such a mission 
(assuming no political complications with his origin). He is already 
organizing a symposium to be held in Michigan in May 1972, on the 
subject of Public Health in China. Another who could play a leading 
role is Dr. Kerr White of Johns Hopkins University, a world renowned 
specialist in health care delivery. 
The U.S. would host an appropriate Chinese delegation, providing 
them an opportunity during their visit to concentrate on subjects in the 
health or medical areas of highest priority and interest to China. It is 
possible that additional projects of cooperation could grow from these

exchanges, in such areas as automated diagnostic techniques and 
training and use of paramedical personnel. 
The Chinese would very likely get favorable publicity in the 
West about the effectiveness of their innovations in these areas. 
The U.S. might acquire very useful information for potential 
application to U.S. problems.

ANNEX ON SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGES 
General Comments: 
In preparing the previous action proposals, the Office of the 
President's Science Adviser has assumed, in accord with your staff's 
instructions, that programs would be carried out largely in a non-
governmental framework. In several areas such as agriculture, 
medicine, and ecology, the proposals could be broadened to include 
activities of appropriate United States Government agencies as well. 
Impinging on all of these suggestions is the paucity of current 
available information about science and technology in the People's 
Republic of China. For the most part these proposals are based on 
crude estimates of the nature and level of activity in China. The 
kind of relationship most frequently suggested is an initial exchange 
of delegations in order to acquire detailed information on both sides. 
It is assumed that these exchanges would be the basis for more 
specific proposals for direct cooperation and regularized exchanges 
of information or materials and individual research workers in 
connection with specific cooperative projects. 
Each of these proposals represents an area where both the 
United States and the People's Republic of China would stand to 
benefit from an exchange. Most are in the fields where the Chinese 
appear to have unique accomplishments, of which they appear proud 
No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
? 
No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
2 
and which they appear willing and pleased to show to foreign visitors. 
The specific suggestions are based in part on expressions of interest 
coming to us spontaneously from individuals and United States institutions. 
The proposals were developed by our staff without discussions with the 
possible participating institutions, because of the White House desire 
to minimize speculation relating to the President's visit. However, I 
am confident that the institutions and the individuals indicated in the 
proposals (or their equivalents) will be available to participate in 
accepted exchanges. 
General Mechanism for Management of These Programs: 
The most straightforward mechanism for management of a broad 
and continuing program of exchanges would require the designation of 
central, coordinating institutions in the United States and in the 
People's Republic of China. These bodies should have broad professional 
competence, and they should possess staff with contacts throughout the 
academic, professional, scientific, and technical communities. 
The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is well qualified to play 
this role on the United States side. In addition to the Academy's 13 years 
of experience in managing analogous exchanges with the USSR, the NAS 
Committee on Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of 
China has been for the past 5 years the focal point of interest in the 
United States.scholarly community in matters related to possible 
exchanges with the People's Republic of China.

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
One possible problem arises from past and continuing association 
of the NAS with Taiwan. The NAS position is that it has fostered 
cooperation with the Academica Sinica on Taiwan and will continue to do 
so, since its role is to further contacts among scholars throughout the 
world, independent of political considerations. 
It has been apparent in reviewing the invitations which the Chinese 
have already extended to American scientists that they also lack 
information on our institutions and our scientific personnel. The 
existence of a central institution in the United States to arrange 
delegation visits in various disciplines and to find the most appropriate 
and talented people to participate would be a substantial service to the 
Chinese. If for some reason, the Chinese feel the NAS is unacceptable 
as a central manager on the United States side, it would be possible to 
develop the proposed programs through individual private institutions. 
However, we would still expect the NAS and its Committee on PRC 
Communication to remain in close contact with all activities and to 
provide advice and counsel to these independent institutions. 
If it is desired to begin with a few ad-hoc exchanges in specific 
areas, I will be willing to assume responsibility for operations using 
the staff of the Office of Science and Technology. 
An obvious candidate for central management on the Chinese 
side is the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Recommendation: 
Wo.recornmend that in conversations with the People's Republic 
of China about exchanges, either before or during the President's 
visit, that the non-governmental nature of the NAS be stressed and 
that its competence and positive attitude toward exchanges with the 
People's Republic of China be emphasized. 
Funding of Exchanges: 
The source of most funding for formalized scientific exchanges 
of Americans with other nations is the United States Government. 
Regardless of what may be initially done with the People's Republic 
of China through private channels, the United States Government will 
eventually have to enter the picture if United States-Chinese exchanges 
are to achieve any significant magnitude. I have made provisional 
arrangements for an initial commitment of $200,000 from the National 
Science Foundation (NSF), which could be made available for such 
exchanges during the remainder of FY 1972. At a maximum of $2000 
per person, this would send some 100 Americans to China (in perhaps 
1.5-20 different delegations) before the end of FY 1972. If the demand 
should be greater, we believe that additional monies could be diverted 
from other programs at NSF. 
For FY 1973, John Richardson in State's Bureau of Educational 
and Cultural Affairs (CU) is planning provisionally to request $1 million 
for exchanges with the People's Republic of China. NSF's allocation

' 
No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
could also be increased in FY 1973. In the health area it also seems 
certain the HEW's Fogarty Center would be willing and able to support 
?some level of exchange if they were asked. It is also likely that the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture would be willing to cover some costs 
of exchanges with the Chinese in their areas of interest. 
One mechanism of funding could involve a grant by NSF or 
State/CU to the NAS, which would then manage the exchanges in 
consultation with the Government. We would plan to monitor these 
exchanges closely. 
A strong case should be made in favor of Federal funding on 
the U. S. side of these exchanges. If, however, there is no acceptable 
alternative to private sources, we believe that the Ford Foundation 
might be willing to finance such opportunities to the extent of several 
hundred thousand dollars a year. We have not explored this formally 
with Mac Bundy or others at Ford, but would be willing to do so if 
you judged it desirable. 
A second possible source of private funding is the Rockefeller 
Foundation with its long and remarkable history of deep involvement 
with China, particularly in areas of medicine and health. With post-war 
Rockefeller activities stressing development, parasitic diseases and 
the Green Revolution, all of which are of interest to China, it would 
be desirable at some stage to ascertain Rockefeller's attitude toward

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
future activi iea with China, as well as their acceptability to the Chinese 
at this time. We have taken no initiative in this direction and would not 
do so unless you request us to. 
Conditions of Exchanges and of Financing: 
We have suggested a balanced program in which there would be 
exchanges of delegations in both directions. If the Chinese are less 
able to come to the United States, we would not object to an imbalance 
in the exchanges in favor of more Americans going to China, especially 
in the early stages of the program. This could be explained by noting 
that the Chinese have continued to receive and read our journals in 
recent years, while the cessation of publication of their journals since 
the Cultural Revolution has created a dearth of information in the 
United States about their science and technology. Even when publications 
were available, the language barrier has been a significant hindrance to 
information flow. 
With regard to payment of expenses, the sending country should 
pay the international travel costs of its delegations going abroad. The 
sending country might also cover the local per diem and local travel 
costs of its delegations in the receiving country. However, we would 
favor "no currency drain" exchanges, where the receiving nation pays 
the costs of hosting the visitors. If NSF, State/CU, or private U. S. 
funding is used, there will be no difficulty in financing exchanges on 
this basis. For certain Government agencies, however, appropriated

7 
funds cannot be used to pay costs of foreign visitors in any way. 
Summary: 
Important questions to be answered include: 
I. Whether U. S. Government funding of exchanges is acceptable. 
2. Whether the National Academy of Sciences would be an 
acceptable institution for centralized management of exchanges on the 
US, side. 
3. Whether U.S. Government scientists employed by U. S. Govern-
ment technical agencies would be acceptable as members of visiting 
delegations, provided they traveled as representatives of the NAS for 
the purpose-of the specific exchange in question. 
4. Whether the Chinese will designate a central institution to 
manage the exchanges on their side and, if so, what it will be. 
5. Whether the receiving country would have a veto over delegation 
members proposed by the other side.

CULTURAL EXCHANGES (INCLUDING YOUTH AND SPORTS GROUPS) 
Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest  
Over the past decade Peking has maintained that Sino - U.S. 
cultural exchanges were a "peripheral" matter to be disposed of only 
after the "major issues" -- resolution of the Taiwan problem, and the 
establishment of U.S. PRC diplomatic relations -- were resolved. In 
view of developments of the past six months, however, Peking may now 
be willing to discuss cultural exchange, including youth and sports, 
which the PRC would hope to exploit politically on a variety of 
external fronts. 
Moderate PRC leaders may have problems justifying a Sino - U. S. 
cultural exchange agreement to the Cultural Revolution radicals, but this 
possibility should not deter us from tabling proposals in this area. 
A formal official exchange agreement incorporating cultural 
affairs could be modeled on the January 27, 1957 agreement between the 
U. S. and the USSR. A draft agreement is included as the first proposal. 
We have tailored the wording of the agreement to take account of signifi-
cant differences between the USSR and the PRC. Sections II, IV, VII and 
IX of the draft agreement deal with cultural matters, including youth 
and sports.

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
Apart from political considerations,Peking may however prefer 
to stall on formal official cultural exchanges because: 
It can already select from a wide variety of talented private 
American individuals and groups who are either applying for entry to 
the PRC or seeking entry of PRC counterparts to the U. S. 
2. It may suspect that a formal cultural exchange agreement 
would be exploited by the USG to "penetrate" PRC institutions and 
groups. 
3. It *21ay fear that such an agreement would be exploited by its 
"revisionist" adversaries -- especially the USSR -- to undermine the 
PRC's militant? revolutionary image abroad. 
If the PRC proves unwilling to negotiate a government-to-government 
agreement on cultural or other exchanges, we could suggest as an alterna-
tive the release of a joint announcement at the conclusion of the President's 
visit stating that the two sides had agreed to encourage exchanges, the 
specific details of which would be negotiated by appropriate organizations 
in the two countries: e.g. , for cultural, youth, and sports matters on 
the U. S. side, the National Committee on U. S. - China Relations, and/or 
youth and athletic federations; on the PRC side, the Chinese People's 
Association Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Cultural Group under 
the State Council, as well as youth and sports federations.

A mild endorsement of cultural as well as scientific, technical 
is 
and educational exchanges/included in the text of our draft Joint 
Communique. 
Following is a group of suggested proposals in the fields of 
sports, music , art, zoological exchanges, and radio-TV-motion 
pictures. The first is a general agreement between the governments 
of the People's Republic of China and the United States of America for 
Cultural, Technical, and Educational Exchanges in the years 1972-
1973. If non-governmental arrangements are preferred, a series of 
specific proposals to be administered by non-governmental agencies 
follows the proposed government-to-government agreement. 
In selecting and suggesting implementation in these various fields, 
the following guidelines have been applied: 
-- Include those U.S. forms with which the Chinese audience 
have some familiarity or which are likely to elicit an empathetic response 
from Chinese audiences. 
- Exclude U. S. political commentaries to which the PRC is likely 
to take strong exception, and try to persuade PRC authorities to exclude 
contemporary Chinese cultural presentations which are blatantly propa-
gandistic and therefore likely to invite only derision from American 
audiences.

-- Exclude U. S. presentations which in their political or 
social criticism of the U. S. scene easily lend themselves to PRC 
propaganda exploitation against the U. S. 
-- In the absence of a formal, official exchange agreement, the 
relative roles assumed by the Department of State s Bureau of Cultural 
Affairs on the one hand and the professional associations and the 
National Committee on U.S. - China Relations on the other would have 
to be decided in light of PRC sensitivity to U.S. Government participa-
tion in the exchanges. We would not, however, want to allow the PRC 
to exclude U.S. Government from a role in implementing the exchanges, 
the better to manipulate professional associations and the National 
Committee.

DRAFT GOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED  
STATES OF AMERICA AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA  
FOR EXCHANGES IN CULTURAL, SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL, AND  
EDUCATIONAL AREAS DURING THE YEARS 1972-1973 
In order to promote closer understanding between our two 
peoples, we propose that our governments negotiate an agreement 
for exchanges of a cultural, scientific, technical, and educational 
nature for the years 1972-1973. 
A draft governmental agreement, to be finally negotiated be-
tween the President of the United States and the Premier of the 
People's Republic of China, or their appointed agents, is attached 
to this proposal. 
Such an agreement would be administered on the United States 
side by the Department of State and the United States Information 
Agency, unless other agencies are specified in the agreement.

ACADEMIC AND SCHOLARLY EXCHANGES 
General Background and Evidence of Chinese Interest: 
The academic area is one of considerable sensitivity to the Chinese 
leadership. Where we have our problems with the "new left, " they are 
bugged about the "bourgeois right." The Cultural Revolution began by 
dismantling the university system which had been built up during the 
firstiwo decades of Party rule; and the Chinese are just in the process 
of rebuilding along "Maoist" lines their entire educational system. 
Mao himself has long had. a personal alergy to the traditionally elitist 
and anti-physical labor orientation of China's intellectuals; and in 1957 
many Western-trained Chinese intellectuals criticized the CCP, thus 
undercutting Mao's policy of letting a "hundred flowers floom and a 
hundred schools of thought contend." Hence it is not certain how much 
receptivity the Chinese leadership will display to exchanges of an 
academic nature which will strengthen the foreign ties and "bourgeois" 
orientation of their intellectuals. 
To the degree that they are interested in strengtheningotheir base 
of scientific and technical manpower for purposes of economic develop-
ment, however, or wish to broaden their understanding of, and access to, 
our country, they may be receptive to exchanges in the academic area. 
Moreover, as the Chinese see the "revolutionary intellectuals" of a 
society adi the social cla.as most receptive to their ideological appeal, 
they may attempt to cultivate supporters in our country through academic 
exchanges.

Following is a series of proposals for exchanges of an academic 
or scholarly nature which are designed to draw out the Chinese in 
areas where we anticipate they would be interested in acquiring 
information or contacts in American society. These proposals are 
intended to encourage them to develop ties with "responsible" organiza-
tions or institutions, and in relatively non-sensitive subject areas.

PROPOSAL FOR EXCHANGES OF SCHOLARLY AND  
SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND PUBLICATIONS  
In order to facilitate the exchange of scientific and scholarly informa-
tion between the People's Republic of China and the United States, we 
propose that discussions be initiated between appropriate scholarly and 
scientific bodies of our respective countries to agree upon lists of 
journals or other publications in those areas where both sides desire 
exchanges. 
? On the American side, we suggest that the Committee on 
Scholarly Communication with the People's Republic of China, 
a non-governmental organization jointly sponsored by the 
National Academy of Sciences, the Social Science Research 
Council, and the American Council of Learned Societies, is 
the most appropriate representative body to conduct such 
discussions. 
-- We propose that as early as is convenient, a responsible 
organization or organizations of the People's Republic of China 
constitute a delegation to visit the United States to begin dis-
cussions on exchanges of such journals and other publications 
with the Committee on Scholarly Communication with the 
People's Republic of China.

PROPOSAL ON EXCHANGES OF ACADEMIC DELEGATIONS  
In order to develop contacts between the United States and the 
People's Republic of China in areas of scholarly and scientific research, 
and to facilitate the exchange of information between our two countries, 
we propose that discussions be initiated between appropriate academic 
bodies on both sides in order to arrange for the exchange of academic 
delegations in a variety of fields. Ecology, agricultural research, the 
5 
marine sciences, linguistics, historiography, economic, and education 
are among the academic areas in which we hope that contacts might 
develop.

PROPOSAL TO HAVE ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS FROM

IN THE UNITED STATES IN THEIR AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION  
In order to develop contacts between the United States and the

we propose that interested organizations of the People's Republic of China

JOURNALISM 
Background and, Evidence of Chinese Interests  
The problem of reciprocity is particularly relevant to proposals for 
exchange of journalists. To date the Chinese have shown considerable 
sophistication in selecting a small number of American journalists for 
controlled, limited-time access to their country. By this approach they 
have skillfully maximized impact on public opinion in the United States in 
a manner favorable to their immediate interests of admission to the U. N. 
and an easing of tensions with the Administration in preparation for the 
President's 
To date the Chinese have shown no interest in sending their journalists 
to the U. S. Their eventual admission to the U.N. , and expanding role in 
world affairs, however, may now incline them to want their news media 
stationed in this country on a permanent basis. 
Further, evidence indicates that their interest in journalistic access to 
this country will be shaped to a substantial degree by their intelligence-
gathering and propaganda requirements. The Chinese domestic press has 
shown very little interest in reporting on the American scene. Peking 
seems to use press material on the U. S. largely in its propaganda to "third 
world" audiences. 
Given these general considerations, following are two proposals on 
exchanges of representatives of our news media, one of a temporary and 
one of a permanent nature. The proposals are structured on the basis

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
of full reciprocity. It is suggested that we initially propose the 
permanent exchange of media representatives, with the temporary 
exchange a fall back position.

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
PROPOSAL ON EXCHANGES OF PUBLIC MEDIA BUREAUS 
That the United States of America and the Peoplets Republic of 
China facilitate the establishment of permanent representatives of their 
respective news media in the two countries by no later than the end of 
June of 1972. 
We propose that the New China News Agency and other news 
media of the People's Republic of China send representatives to the 
United States to establish permanent offices on a pattern reciprocal 
with the establishment of facilities for American news media in the 
People's Republic of China. 
Because of differences in the organization of public news 
media in our respective countries, and in order to facili-
tate the growth of relations between our two countries on 
the basis of full equality, we propose that equal numbers 
of newsmen be permitted to reside in our respective 
countries. As an initial figure, we propose that ten (10) 
journalists or other media representatives from each side 
be permitted to reside in the other country. 
Because of the varied types of news media in the United 
States, we propose that the total of American newsmen per-
mitted to reside in the People's Republic of China include

representatives of the two major American "wire 
services" (United Press International, and the Associated 
Press) and some combination of representatives of the 
major radio and television networks (American Broad-
casting Company, Columbia Broadcasting Station, Na-
tional Broadcasting Company), the major national daily 
papers (New York Times, Washington Post, etc.) and 
news magazines (Time, Newsweek, etc.). We are 
prepared to welcome a similarly diverse group of media 
representatives from the People's Republic of China. 
We propose that media representatives of our two countries 
be permitted roughly equivalent sites of residence; that is, 
establishment of American media facilities in Peking 
would be equivalent to Chinese facilities in Washington, 
with a similar arrangement between Shanghai and New 
York, Canton and San Francisco. Additional siting 
arrangements would be considered through further dis-
cussions between representatives of the two governments. 
-- We propose that equivalent travel opportunities be permitted 
for media representatives of our two countries. For our 
part, we are prepared to facilitate unrestricted travel by 
media representatives of the People's Republic of China 
throughout the United States.

General Comments  
In designing this proposal for the permanent exchange of media 
representatives, the problems encountered by American journalists 
in the Soviet Union have heightened our concern about the Chinese 
trying indirectly to control the quality of news reporting from their 
country by playing competing papers on wire services off against each 
other. Their most powerful lever is to grant visas only to those 
journalists who write material "friendly" to their position, thus in-
hibiting newsmen in China from writing critical material, or encourag-
ing a journal seeking access to tailor its material to official PRC visa 
requirements. 
We assume that the Chinese authorities will never surrender their 
authority to pick and choose among journalists in granting visas. Thus, 
while the above mentioned problem is not dealt with directly in this pro-
posal, a diversity of American media representatives in the PRC, and 
our own ability to control visas for Chinese newsmen in the United 
States, gives us some degree of protection. Ultimately, however, open 
journalism in both countries requires a degree of trust and mutual confi-
dence not now present in the relations between our two countries.

PROPOSL ON TEMPORARY EXCHANGES OF NEWSMEN: 
That the People's Republic of China and the United States of America 
encourage the exchange of representatives of their respective news media 
for visits of approximately one month. 
We are prepared to: 
grant visas to media representatives from the People's Republic 
of China through the American Embassy in Ottawa, Canada on 
a pattern roughly equivalent to that now established by your 
government in its admission of American journalists for tours 
of approximately one month to various parts of China. We are 
prepared to see such visits by journalists from the People' s 
Republic of Clam begin at any time. 
We hope that such temporary exchanges of newsmen will soon lead 
to the establishment of permanent facilities in our respective countries 
for representation of our various news media on a fully equivalent basis.

LIFE, JULY 10, 19 71 
by EDGAR SNOW 
any are the answers and speculations 
offered to explain why President Nix-
on sought and accepted an invitation 
Li to Peking, but why were the Chinese 
responsive? Is it forgotten in Peking that Nixon 
built his early career on witch-hunting and 
climbed to.the Senate and vice-presidency on the 
backs of "appeasers in the State Department" 
who sold China to Russia? Why should Mao Tse-
tung, with a fierce domestic purge safely behind 
? him, seeing America's Vietnam venture a sham-
bles and believing its political and economic po-
sition to be in serious trouble abroad and at home, 
? accept a belated olive branch? And if Nixon is 
not going to China just to eat shark fins, what 
may his hosts serve as side dishes?and what may 
they expect in return? 
The question about Nixon has been partly an-
swered for us by Chairman Mao in my earlier re-
port He told me that Nixon, who represented 
the monopoly capitalists, should be welcomed 
situ. ply because at present the problems between 
China and the U.S. would have to be solved with 
? him. In the dialectical pattern of his thought Mao 
has often said that good can come out of bad 
and that bad people can be made good?by ex-
perience and right teaching. Yes, he said to me, 
he preferred men like Nixon to social democrats 
and revisionists, those who professed to be one 
thing but in power behaved quite otherwise. 
Nixon might be deceitful, he went on, but per-
haps a little bit less so than some others. Nixon re-
sorted to tough tactics but he also used some soft 
tactics. Yes, Nixon could just get on a plane and 
come. It would not matter whether the talks 
would be sucCessful. If he were willing to come, 
the chairman yould be willing to talk to him and 
it would be al right. It would be all right, wheth-
er or not the uarreled, or whether Nixon came 
? as a tourist 6r as President. He believed they 
would not qiiarrel. But of course he would offer 
criticism of Nixon. The hosts would also make 
self-criticism and talk about their own mistakes 
and shortcomings-for instance, their production 
level was lower than that of the United States. 
What has happened since January 1965 to 
change Mao's mind? At that time I asked the 
chairman if there was any message I might deliver 
to President Johnson, and his answer was Pu-s/ii 
(No!) and nothing more. Even so, Mao said then 
that one possible solution to the Vietnam con-
flict still was a new Geneva conference to end the 
fighting and guat-7.17&-qn ochipendenee. 
That message reached the State Department, but 
the "option" was almost immediately closed 
out by Johnson's bombing or North Vietnam. 
In an unprecedented gesture toward an Ameri-
can, Mao had author Snow at his side last 
year as he reviewed the October Day parade. 
In that 1965 interview Mao had made it clear 
enough that he did not expect the Americans to 
desist until they had learned, the hard way, that 
they could not impose their political will on rev-
olutionary Vietnam by military violence. 
The Chinese believe that the lesson of Vietnam, 
and no mere change of Presidents, is what made 
it possible for Mao in 1970 to speak differently 
about Nixon. "Experience" had made Nixon rel-
atively "good." Other major changes had also al-
tered their view: antiwar resistance inside the 
United States; the formation of an alliance link-
ing Hanoi, the VC and resistance forces in Cam-
bodia and Laos, unilaterally backed by Peking. 
And there had been changes inside China itself, 
including the sobering growth of nuclear missiles 
and delivery capacity. 
Theoretically, the Chinese believe, Nixon had 
various options along the way and did make use 
of them as tactical threats for a time?as in Cam-
bodia and Laos. But the end was near. Once the 
decision was taken to get out or Vietnam, clearly 
a U.S. understanding with China became imper-
ative. The President had not only to safeguard 
his rear against possible destruction by a China-
backed North Vietnam offensive, buCalso to cope 
with domestic and world political repercussions 
of withdrawal. 
That was the general view in 1970 from the 
Heavenly Peace Gate, but preparations continued

In the summer of 1969, the Nixon administra-
tion had publicly urged an easing of tensions with 
- China; later that year it had stopped the Taiwan 
Straits patrols and the Chinese took note, of 
course. The administration also proposed to re-
sume the suspended Warsaw talks at any mutu-
ally agreeable time or place. In January 1970 pre-
liminary Sino-American talks opened in Warsaw. 
They were immediately suspended after the Cam-
bodian invasion. But Nixon went' ahead, carried 
out a stage-by-stage elimination of trade embar-
goes against China, and lifted travel bans between 
the two countries. Early this spring a presiden-
tial commission advocated a U.N. seat for main-
land China, for the first time officially calling it 
? the People's Republic. Peking leaders remained 
suspicious?especially of a double-cross play be-
tween Moscow and Washington. - 
By late autumn of 1970 several urgent and au-
thentically documented inquiries reaching China 
had indicated that the President wished to know 
whether he or his representative would he received 
in Peking. An indirect answer was contained in 
an interview given to me by Chou En-lid in No-
vember when he said that Sino-Amercean con-
versations could be opened but only if the Amer-
icans demonstrated a "serious" desire to nego-
tiate. To the initiated, "serious" meant, first of 
all, a realistic attempt to work out a program to 
deal with?the Taiwan problem. As Mao and Chou-. 
see it, that was and is the key to all other Asian set-
tlements. Evidently sufficient assurances were 
forthcoming. When Chou En-lai led my wife and 
me to stand beside Chairman Mao's side last Oc-
tober, and to be photographed at the anniver-
sary parade, no American had ever been so no-
ticed. Nothing China's leaders do publicly is 
without purpose. Discerning people realized that 
something new was happening. Then came the 
Ping Pong gesture. Chairman Mao had talked to 
? me,in December, and after the Ping Pong gesture 
I was able to report that he would welcome Mr. 
Nixon or his personal representative to Peking. 
A new horizon was-already in sight. 
? My LIFE article was translated and widely cir-
culated in China among political and army lead-
ers. They could not, therefore, have been much 
astonished by the recent Peking-Washington joint 
announcement. Though China's press may carry 
only a few lines, the whole subject today is un-
-doubtedly being cautiously, discussed and ex-
plained down to the commune level. Only one 
thing may have surprised the Chinese: Mr. Kis-
singer's success in keeping his visit secret. Expe-
rience with American diplomats during World 
War II had convinced Chinese leader's that Amer-
icans could not keep secrets. , 
- ' 
2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 aware not only 
01 tne international unputa. uiAV1I.ritxon's plans, 
but also of the domestic effects and side benefits 
to his present and future political career. Discuss-
ing Nixon's possible visit to China, the chairman 
casually remarked that the presidential election 
would be in 1972, would it not? Therefore, he 
added, Mr. Nixon might send an envoy first, but 
was not himself likely to come to Peking before 
early 1972. 
By 1970 China had passed through the ordeal 
of a great purge, much time had been lost in do-
mestic construction, and many fences had to be 
mended or newly built to end China's interna-
tional. isolation. The period of internal tension 
was largely over. Now, if there was a chance to re-
cover Taiwan?Mao's last national goal of uni-
fication?and for China to be accepted as an equal 
in recognition oilier great size, achievements and 
potential, why not look at it? Nothing in Mao's 
thought or teaching ever called for a war against 
the U.S. or for a war of foreign conquest, and 
nothing in Mao's ideology places any faith in nu-
clear bombs. The burden of building bombs and 
counterattack silos is very heavy indeed and like-
ly to become more so; China has more than once 
called for their total abolition. 
Very high among the reasons why Sino-Arner-
lean rapprochement interests China is to improve 
her strategic position in dealing with Russia, With 
America off the Asian continent, the danger of a 
Soviet-American gang-tip dispelled and a seat of 
her own in the U.N., Peking's maneuvering pow-
er would obviously be enhanced. 
Did Mr. Kissinger understand, then, that Chi-
na was ready to talk from a position of strength, 
not weakness? China's leaders respect Kissinger. 
. They know him through their own intelligence 
system and through his writing. Discussing him 
with an old friend and close comrade-in-politics 
of Premier Chou one evening in Peking, I was 
struck by his frank delight at the prospect across-
big verbal swords with such a worthy adversary. 
"Kissinger?" he said. "There is a man who knows 
the language of both worlds?his own and ours. 
He is the first American we have seen in his po-
sition. With him it should be possible to talk." 
The immediate issues examined at the meeting 
between Chou and Kissinger?and the agenda 
ahead?are very concrete and could scarcely have 
been anything very new to either side. As the Chi-
nese see it, solutions would involve these turning-
point decisions for Nixon: (1) seating the Peo-
ple's Republic in the United Nations and the re-
turn of Taiwan to mainland sovereignty, (2) total 
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and arrangements 
for an international conference to guarantee In-
dochina's independence, and for a negotiated 
Hanoi-Saigon settlement which would preserve

No Objection to Declassification in Full 201 
some shell of the American-made regime, at least 
for a decent interval, and (3) the establishment 
of formal Sino-American diplomatic relations. 
On all these matters, some rough negotiable script 
bad to be brought back to Nixon to enable him 
to accept Premier Chou's invitation. 
China's formula for Taiwan has always been 
negotiable whenever American leaders so wished. 
As repeatedly defined, it requires two steps: first,

China will never publicly renounce what it con-
' siders its ultimate sovereign right to recover Tai-
wan by force if necessary. However, there is now 
a likelihood that a non-military solution will be 
worked out by the Nationalists and the Commu-
nist Chinese themselves. The opening of serious 
Sino-American talks may have already provoked 
renewed covert conversations between Taiwan 
and Peking in a search for the possible terms of as-
similation. That is no doubt one of Nixon's hopes. 
Mao Tse-tun has pointed out to me that eace-
ful.iJUionof Taiwan is is 
me of several cases in the Chinese civil war when 
,other provinces acceded without fighting. 
Nixon has now declared his readiness to see 
China seated in the U.N. But he also wishes to re-
tain a seat there for the Taiwan regime. China 
will not enter the U.N. on that condition. Wheth-
er the U.N. members themselves seat Peking and 
simply drop Taiwan, or whether Taiwan with-
draws its delegation in protest, the Chinese be-
lieve that Taiwan cannot long function in the 
U.N. once a-majority of its members cease to rec-
ognize it.

On his visit to Peking the President would be en-
tering a nation with which his country has no dip-

of state holds no executive office. Meet the party 
chairman Nixon certainly would, but in all prob-
ability Chou would do most of the negotiating. 
What sort of man will the President see in Chou 
En-lai? Chou is clearly one of the world's ablest 
negotiators. Handsome and exuding charisma, he . 
is, now in his 73rd year, tireless. in August 1967, 
Chou negotiated his way out of his most perilous 
moment in the Cultural Revolution. Though idol-
ized by youth, he was, for more than two days 
and nights, surrounded in his offices in the Great 
Hall by half a million ultra-leftist Red Guards. 
Their leaders?some later arrested as counter-rev-
olutionaries?were seeking to seize the files of the 
Central Committee?and Chou himself. Mao and 
Lin Piao were both absent. By talking to small 
groups, day and night, Chou gradually persuad-
ed the masses?so Chou called them in talking 
to me?to disperse. It was only following that in-
cident that Lin Piao brought thousands of troops 
into the capital, and the disarming and breakup 
of the Red Guards began in earnest?with heavy 
casualties.

Kissinger is said to havekeig?.20 of his 49 hours 
in Peking talking to the premier. That is nothing 
extraordinary. One of several interview-conver-
sations I had with him lasted from the dinner table 
one evening until six the next morning. I was ex-
hausted, he seemingly as fresh as ever. "I must 
let you get some sleep," I mumbled. 
He threw back his head and laughed. -I've al-
ready had my sleep," he said. "Now I'm going 
to work." His night's rest had been a catnap be-
fore dinner. 
Chou told me that he had taken one vacation

men drink very little, and each is highly disci-
plined in his own style. In negotiating with Pres-
ident Nixon, Chou will probably do the nitty-grit-
ty work, in close collaboration with Mao behind 
the scenes. But the final decisions will be Mao's. 
Whatever the Chinese may think of Nixon's 
motives, he has earned their appreciation by the 
courtesy of coming to see them, thereby accord-
ing prestige to Mao Tse-tung and amour-propre to 
the whole people. Vassal kings of the past brought 
tributes to Peking, but never before the head of 
the world's most powerful nation. The gesture in 
itself may go far to assuage the rancor and resent-
ment accumulated during the past two decades 
There is some risk that the gestuie could be mis-
interpreted to the Americans' disadvantage, but 
more likely it will be accepted with full grace and 
improve chances of mutual accommodation. 
The millennium seems distant and the mime 
diate prospect is for the toughest kind of adjust-
ment and struggle. China must satisfy Korea and 
Vietnam, and the U.S. cannot jettison Japan. The 
danger is that Americans may imagine that the 
Chinese are giving up Communism?and Maci's 
world view?to become nice agrarian democrats*

is to court disenchantment. 
...power, he has been a zestful worker in pur-
suit of national and revolutionary power 
politics. Chou's affable manner masks viscera of?  
tough and supple alloys; he is a master of policy 
? implementation with an infinite capacity for de-
? tail. His personal contacts are innumerable. He 
combines an administrative efficiency hard to rec-
oncile with his ubiquity. His self-effacing dedi-
cation makes him Mao's indispensable alter ego. 
Symbiosis is perhaps the best word to describe 
their relationship. Very different in working style 
and personality, Mao and Chou complement each 
other aci'tandem based on 37 years of trust and 
interdependence. Chou was never a mandarin but 
his grandfather was, and he confesses to a feudal 
background, although he spent 20 years in peas-
ant surroundings as a guerrilla. Mao is a peasant-
born intellectual genius to whose.intuitive and? 
experienced knowledge of the people Chou ha-
? bitually defers. 
Mao is an activist, a prime mover, an origi-
nator and master of strategy achieved by alter-
'nating surprise, tension and easement. He dis-
trusts long periods of stability and is never sat-
isfied with the pace of change, but he is practical 
and capable of great patience in achieving a goal 
by stages. - 
Chou welcomes the detailed execution of a plan 
?which bores Mao?and the more complex the 
problem the better. Chou quickly cuts to the heart 
of matters, drops the impractical, dissimulates 
when necessary, and never gambles?without 
four aces. Chou works best when the revolution-
ary pendulum has swung to a point of stability. 
He is a builder, not a poet. 
In talks I have had with China's two great men

During a five-hour discourse with me in Peking 
on Dec. 18 last year, Chairman Mao Tse-tung ex-
pressed some of his views on sino-American, 
Sino-Russlan and other problems of foreign re-
lations as well as on the Great Proletarian Cul-
tural Revolution and its aftermath. 
The chairman criticized the ritualism of the 
Mao "personality cult," explained why it had been 
a necessary nuisance during the Cultural Rev-
olution and forecast its gradual modification. He , 
said that the government of the People's Re-
public would shortly admit to China some vis-
itors representative of a broad spectrum of Amer-
ican political and press opinion from the right, 
the middle and the left. He spoke in favor of 
opening conversations with American officials at 
the highest level, including Mr. Nixon. He ex-
pressed admiration for American achievements 
in production, science, technolugy and universal 
education and said that he held great hopes for 
the American people as a potential force for 
good in the world. 
hairman Mao emphasized that he did 
114 not wish to be interviewed. What we 
, had was a conversation. Only recently 
I was able to confirm, howevr..? that he 
would not object to publication of certain of his 
comments without the use of direct ouotati)n. 
During most of our talk, notes were taken by 
Nancy Tang, American-born daughter of Tang 
by EDGAR SNOW 
0 EDGAR SNOW, 1071. ALL MGM'S RKSERvED 
Mr. Snow, author of Red Star over China and a number 
Of other books, has known Mao since 1936. He recently 
returned from a six-month stay In Communist China. 
Ming-chao, (Mr. Tang was editor of the Over-
seas Chinese Deily in New York City until 
1949. Since then he has served in China as a 
leader of cultural and political relations with for-
eign countries.) One other person was present 
?a Chinese woman secretary. It was inter-
esting that neither of the young women wore a 
Mao badge: this was the only occasion on 
which I met an official when the badge was not 
on display. 
I recorded our dialogue from memory imme-
diately afterward and also was given a copy of 
Miss T'ang's notes. 
Chairman Mao's residence in Peking lies in 
the southwestern corner of the former For-
bidden City, surrounded by vermilion walls and 
not far from the Tien-an Men, or Heavenly 
Peace Gate, where he reviews the October an-
niversary parade. Behind these high walls, 
topped by glistening yellow tiles, the old im-
perial regime also housed its officials. Today 
members of the Politburo live and work here in 
close proximity to the chairman and Premier 
Chou En-lai. One enters through the West 
Gate, flanked by two armed guards. Circling 
around an empty wooded drive, one quickly 
comes to a one-story dwelling of modest size, 
built in traditional style. 
At the entrance one is greeted by two un-
armed officers, who wear no insignia of rank.

? 
does she know? They disappear when the chair-
man meets me at the door of his study. I apol-
ogize for keeping him waiting. I had been asleep 
when summoned without advance notice. 
It was early morning. We had breakfast to-
gether and talked until about one o'clock. He 
was slightly indisposed with a cold and he won-
? dered out loud what doctors were good for: 
they could not even prevent a simple disease 
like colds, which cost so much lost time. I men-
tioned Dr. Linus Pauling?he had heard of him 
?and his advocacy of large doses of ascorbic 
acid as a cold penacea. I offered to send him 
some. He said he would try it. If it helped I 
would get the credit. If it poisoned him I would 
not be blamed. 
Mao's large study was completely lined with 
? shelves filled by hundreds of Chinese books, 
with a sprinkling of foreign volumes. From many 
of them dangled slips of paper used as anno-
tated bookmarks. The large desk was piled high 
with journals and scripts. It was a working writ-
er's shop. Through the wide windows one could 
catch a glimpse of garden where the chairman 
Is said to, grow his own vegetables and exper-
iment with crops. It is not a "private plot"; it be-
longs to the state. Perhaps he needs the output, 
since he is said to have taken a recent cut of 
20% in his subsistence "wages." 
We discussed my account of our last talk, in 
January 1965, in which I had reported his ac-
knowledgement that there was indeed a "cult of 
personality" in China?and moreover there was 
reason for one, Some people had criticized me 
for writing about that. 
So, he said, what if I had written about a 
? "cult of personality" in China? There was such 
a thing. Why not write about it? It was a fact 
. those officials who had opposed my return 
to China in 1967 and 1-966 had belonged to an ul-
traleftist group which had seized the foreign min-
istry for a time, but they were all cleared out 
long ago. At the time of our 1965 colloquy, Mao 
continued, a great deal of power?over propa-
ganda work within the provincial and local party 
committees, and especially within the Peking Mu-
nicipal Party Committee?had been out of his 
control. That was why he had then stated that 
there was need for more personality cult, in 
order to stimulate the masses to dismantle the 
anti-Mao party bureaucracy. 
Of course the personality cult had been over-
done. Today, things were different. It was hard, 
the chairman said, for people to overcome the 
habits of 3,000 years of emperor-worshiping tra-
dition. The so-called "Four Greats"-:-those ep-
ithets applied to Mao himself: "Great Teacher, 
Great Leader, Great Supreme Commander, 
Great Helmsman"?what a nuisance. They would 
all be eliminated sooner or later. Only the word 
"teacher" would be retained?that is, simply 
schoolteacher. Mao had always been a school-
'teacher and still was one. He was a primary 
schoolteacher in Changsha even before he was 
a Communist. All the rest of the titles would be 
declined. 
"I often wonder," I said, "whether those 
who shout Mao the loudest and wave the most 
banners are not?as some say?waving the Red 
Flag in order to defeat the Red Flag." 
Mao nodded. He said such people fell into 
three categories. The first were sincere people. 
The second were those who drifted with the tide 
?they conformed because everyone else shout-
ed "Long live." The third category were hyp-
ocrites. I was right not to be taken in by such 
stuff. 
iremember," I said, "that just before you en-
tered Peking in 1949 the Central Corn-
mittee adopted a resolution?reportedly at 
your suggestion?which forbade naming 
streets, cities or places for anybody." 
Yes, he said, they had avoided that; but other 
forms of worship had emerged. There were so 
many slogans. Pictures and plaster statues. The 
Red Guard had insisted that if you didn't have 
those things around, you were being anti-Mao. 
. In the past few years there had been need for 
some personality cult. Now there was no such 
need and there should be a cooling down, 
But after all, he went on, did not the Amer-
icans have their own personality cult? How could 
the governor of each state, how could each Pres-
ident and each Cabinet member, get along with-
out some people to worship them? There was 
always the desire to be worshiped and the de-
sire to worship. Could you, he asked me, be 
happy if no one read your books and articles? 
There was bound to be some worship of the in-
dividual and that applied to me too.

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
Chairman Mao has obviously pondered very 
much over this phenomenon?the human need 
for and to worship, about gods and God. On ear-
lier visits he had discussed it at length. Now, at 
76, he was in general good health but once again 
he said that he would -soon be going to see 
God." It was inevitable; everyone eventually had 
to see God. 
"Voltaire wrote that if there were no God it 
would be necessary for man to invent one," I 
said. "If he had expressed himself as an outright 
atheist it might have cost him his head, in those 
times." 
Mao agreed that many people had lost their 
heads for saying much less. 
"We have made some progress since then," 
I said. "And man has been able to change God's 
views on a number of things. One of them is 
birth control; about that, there is a great change 
here in China compared with five or 10 years 
-ago." 
No, he said. I had been taken in! In the coun-
tryside a woman still wanted to have boy chil-
dren. If the first and second were girls, she 
would make another try. If the third one came 
and was still a girl, the mother would try again. 
Pretty soon there would be nine of them, the 
mother was already 45 or so, and she would final-
ly decide to leave it at that. The attitude must be 
changed butit was taking time. Perhaps the same 
thing was true in the United States? 
"China is ahead in that respect," I said. "A 
women's liberation movement in the United 
States is making some impact, however. Amer. 
icart women were the first to achieve the vote 
and they are now learning how to use it." 
At this point we were interrupted by the ar-
rival 'of some glasses of mao Cal, a fiery rice li-
quor made in Kweichow Province. We drank a 
toast. To my mortification the chairman noticed 
that I had omitted to toast the ladies present. 
How could I have done so? I had not yet ac- ? 
cepted women as equals. 
It was not possible, said the chairman, to 
achieve complete equality between men and 
women at present. But between Chinese and 
Americans there need be no prejudices. There 
could be mutual respect and equality. He said he 
placed high hopes on the peoples of the two 
countries. 
If the Soviet Union wouldn't do [point the 
way], then he would place his hopes on the Amer-
ican people. The United States alone had a pop-
ulation of more than 200 million. Industrial pro-
duction was already higher than in any other 
country and education was universal. He would 
be happy to see a party emerge there to lead a 
revolution, although he was not expecting that in 
the near future. 
In the meantime, he said, the foreign ministry 
was studying the matter of admitting Americans 
from the left, middle and right to visit China. 
Should rightists like Nixon, who represented the 
monopoly capitalists, be permitted to come? He 
should be welcomed because, Mao explained, at 
present the problems between China and the 
U.S.A. would have to be solved with Nixon. Mao 
would be happy to talk with him, either as a tour-
ist or as President. 
I, unfortunately, could not represent the Unit-
ed States, he said; I was not a monopoly cap-
italist. Could I settle the Taiwan question? Why 
continue such a stalemate? Chiang Kai-shek had 
not died yet. But what had Taiwan to do with 
Nixon? That question was created by Truman 
and Acheson. 
t may be relevant to mention?and this is 
not a part of my talk with Chairman Mao 
?that foreign diplomats in Peking were 
aware last year that messages were being 
delivered from Washington to the Chinese gov-
ernment by certain go-betweens. The purport of 
such communicatiens was to assure Chinese 
leaders of Mr. Nixon's "new outlook" on Asia. 
Nixon was firmly determined, it was said, to with-
draw from Vietnam as speedily as possible, to 
seek a negotiated international guarantee of the 
independence of Southeast Asia, to end the im-
passe in Sino-American relations by clearing up 
the Taiwan question and to bring the People's Re-
public into the United Nations and into diplo-
matic relations with the United States. 
Two important Frenchmen were in China In 
1970. The first was Andr?ettencourt, the min-
ister of planning, the second was Maurice Couve 
de Murville, premier under De Gaulle's regime. 
M. Couve de Murville completed arrangements 
for a visit to China by General de Gaulle which 
was to have occurred this year. It was to Gen-

vim 
eral de Gaulle, I was authoritatively informed, 
that Mr. Nixon had first confided his intention to 
seek a genuine d?nte with China. Some peo-
ple had anticipated that De Gaulle, during his 
visit, would play a key role in promoting serious 
Sino-American conversations. Death ruled oth-
erwise. Chairman Mao's tribute to the general, 
sent to Mme. de Gaulle, was the only eulogy 
which he is known to have offered for any non-
Communist statesman since Roosevelt died. 
Meanwhile, other diplomats had been active. 
The head of one European mission in Peking, 
who had already made one trip to see President 
? Nixon. returned to Washington last December, 
,He bypassed the State Department to confer at 
? the White House, and was back in China in Jan-
uary. From another and unimpeachable diplomat-
ic source I learned, not long before my depar-
? ture. from Peking in February, that the White 
House had once more conveyed a message ask-
? ing how a personal representative of the Pres-
? ident would be received in the Chinese capital 
for conversations with the highest Chinese lead-
ers. About the same time, I was enigmatically 
told by a s'anior Chinese diplomat who had for-
merly maintained quite the opposite, "Nixon is 
getting oat of Vietnam." 
I. must once mare stress that none of the 
? above background information was provided to 
? me by Mao Tse-tung, 
As we talked, the chairman recalled to me 
once again that it was the Japanese militarists 
who had taught revolution to the Chinese peo-
ple. Thanks to their invasion, they had provoked 
the Chinese people to fight and had helped bring 
? Chinese socialism to power. 
I mentioned how Prince Sihanouk had told me 
a few days before that "Nixon is the best agent 
for., Mao Tse-tung. The more he bombs Cam- ? 
bodia, the more Communists he makes. He is 
their best ammunition carrier," said the prince. 
Yes, Mao agreed. He liked that kind of help. 
reminded him? that when I had spoken to 
him two months before, during the October Day 
parade at Tien-an Men Square, he had told me 
that he was "not satisfied with the present sit-
uation." I asked him to explain what he meant. 
He replied that there were two things of which 
he highly disapproved during the Cultural Rev-
olution. One was lying. Someone, while saying 
that the struggle should be carried out by rea-
soning, not by coercion or force, actually gave 
the other fellow a kick under the table and then 
drew back his leg. When the person kicked asked, 
"Why did you kick me?" the first person said, "I 
didn't kick you. Don't you see my foot is still 
here?" That, Mao said, is lying. Later the con-
flict during the Cultural Revolution developed 
. into war between factions?first with spears, then 
rifles, then mortars. When foreigners reported 
that China was in great chaos, they were not tell-
ing lies. It had been true. Fighting was going on. 
(I was told by Premier Chou on another oc-
casion that the army suffered thousands of ca-
sualties before it took up arms to suppress fac-
tional struggles.) 
The other thing the chairman was Most un-
happy about was the maltreatment of "captives" 
?party members and others removed from power 
and subjected to reeducation, The old practice 
of the Liberation Army?freeing captives and giv-
ing them fares to go home, which resulted in 
many enemy soldiers being moved to volunteer 
and join their ranks?had often been ignored. 
Maltreatment of captives now had slowed the re-
building and transformation of the party. 
If one did not speak the truth, Mao con-
cluded, how could he gain the confidence of oth-
ers? Who would trust one? The same applied 
between friends. 
"Are the Russians afraid of China?" I asked. 
Some people said so, he replied, but why 
should they be? China's atom bomb was only 
this size (Mao raised his little finger), while Rus-
sia's bomb was that size (he raised his thumb). 
Together the Russian and American bombs were 
(putting two thumbs together) that size. What 
could a little finger do against two thumbs? 
"But from the long-range view. Do the Rus-
sians fear China?" 
It was said that they were a bit afraid, he an-
swered. Even when there are a few mice in a per-
son's room the person could become frightened, 
fearful that the mice might eat up his sweets. 
For instance, the Russians were upset because 
China was building air raid shelters. But if the 
Chinese got into their shelters, how could they 
. attack others? 
As for ideology, who had fired the first shot? 
The Russians had called the Chinese dogmatists 
and then the Chinese had called them revision-
ists. China had published their criticisms, but the 
Russians had not dared publish China's. Then 
they had sent some Cubans and later Roma-
nians to ask the Chinese to cease open po-
lemics. That would not do, Mao said. The po-
lemics would have to be carried on for 10,000 
? years if necessary. Then Kosygin himself had

No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-465-2-1-2 
come. After their talk Mao had told him that he 
? would take off 1,000 years but no more. 
The Russians looked down on the Chinese 
and also looked clown on the people of many 
countries, he said. They thought that they only 
had to speak the word and all people would lis-
ten and obey. They did not believe that there 
were people who would not do so and that one 
of them was his humble self. Although Sino-Rus-
sian ideological differences were now irrecon-
cilable?as demonstrated by their contradictory 
policies in Cambodia?they could eventually set-
tle their problems as between states. 
Referring once again to the United States, 
? Chairman Mao said that China should learn from 
the way America developed, by decentralizing 
and spreading responsibility and wealth among 
the 50 states. A central government could not 
do everything. China must depend upon region-
al and local initiatives. It would not do (spread-
ing his hands) to leave everything up to him. 
As he courteously escorted me to the door, 
he said he was not a Complicated Man, but really 
Very simple. He was, he said, only a lone monk 
? walking the world with a leaky umbrella. 
As a result of this and other informal conver-
sations, I believe that in future Sine-American 
talks. Chairman Mao will surely adhere to the 
basic principles which have guided China in all 
her foreign policies, her ideological and world 
view as well as her regional policies. On the 
other hand, I also believe that, following an eas-
ing of international tensions, China will seek to 
cooperate with all friendly states, and all friend-
ly people within hostile states, who welcome her 
full participation in world affairs.

US - PRC EXCHANGES  
In your opening statement you address the desirability of 
discussing some subsidiary questions such as US - PRC exchanges. 
? You note we fully recognize that the PRC considers these as "side" 
? issues, but point out that we do not intend to use them as diversions and 
fully expect to deal with fundamental issues. You 
explain, though, 
that progress on lesser questions would help to make movement possible 
on crucial questions -- it would show detractors on both sides that the 
goal of normal relations is an attainable one, lead to a better climate 
for -flaking progresrloi th.-; largc.-7 1:::zues, and indicate that no conditions 
were being attached to progress in relations. This last would be very 
desirable for us. 
The Chinese for their part are likely to be quite reserved on the 
subject of exchanges, unless they are sufficiently reassured about the 
U.S. stand on major issues such as Taiwan. But even so, pending the 
establishment of diplomatic relations they will probably hold off on any 
government-tb:government agreement, preferring to adhere to a "people-
to-people" formula. They may not yet be ready to engage in exchanges 
'with the U.S. in which large numbers of Chinese would travel to the U.S.

steps to facilitate exchange 
There is another possible problem in working out exchanges. The 
Chinese have a few "non-governmental organizations set up to handle 
exchanges, for example the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese 
People's Institute for CulturalRelations with Foreign Countries, which have 
over the years acted as clearing houses for exchange matters. We have 
only one non- (or quasi-) governmental organization, the National Academy 
of Sciences equipped to deal with this matter. There are other bodies, 
such as the National Committee on United States Relations with China, 
which would like to get into the clearing-house business on exchanges, 
which might be a good idea except for the possibility that many other 
groups might take umbrage if we seem to be working through a chosen 
instrument. 
These problems are manageable. The Chinese are likely to be at 
least somewhat responsive ? your conversation with Marshall Yeh 
Chien-ying suggests that the prospect of exchanges both titillates and worries 
them -- and if-you can provide them with some specific suggestions they 
may be prepared to follow through by the time of the President's visit.

I have some suggested wording for such an agreement. 
However, if the PRC prefers to handle the matter on a non-

that would be acceptable. In such a case we might carry a reference 
to this effect in the joint communique. I also have some suggested 
wording with me, which we could either look at now, oi defer until

U.S. POSITION ON OCEANS REGIME 
Existing US Oceans Policy  
In his statement of May 23, 1970 the President proposed the following Law 
of the Sea arrangements: 
Territorial Sea - a maximum of 12 miles; 
-- Straits - a new right of free transit through international straits to 
compensate for the fact that the 12 mile territorial sea would bring 
many key straits (including Gibraltar) under national jurisdiction; 
- Seabeds/Mineral Resources - dividing the ocean floor into three zones: 
1. national jurisdiction out to the 200 meter depth line; 
2. beyond this point to the edge of the continental margin (which is not 
precisely defined) the coastal state would, under agreed rules, act 
as Trustee for the international community; 
3. beyond the continental margin, full control by an international 
regime; 
-- Fisheries - some accommodation of the coastal state interests by 
giving them carefully defined preferential rights to fisheries resources 
beyond the 12 mile limit. 
- Pollution - international agreement on controls on pollution caused by 
seabeds exploitation. 
-- Scientific Research  - maximum freedom for scientific research. 
Negotiating Situation  
The proposal on territorial seas and international straits is of prime 
iMportance to US security. It was primarily to secure those interests that 
we got into the whole Law of the Sea operation. We do, however, have room 
for maneuver on seabeds, fisheries, pollution and research issues. 
The underlying negotiating problem is that very few countries care much about 
"freedom of navigation", but very many want to maximize their claim to 
fisheries and seabeds resources. Thus, our security interests are threatened

by a trend toward extensive unilateral territorial sea claims. It is not 
practical to resist these claims simply by military defense of our customary 
rights. We hope, instead, to hold the territorial sea line through the 
achievement of an international agreement on the oceans, hopefully to be 
nailed down at a Law of the Sea Conference in 1973. 
Our initial strategy was to create a majority interest in narrow territorial 
seas by promising extensive revenues for LDC development from the inter-
national trusteeship zone beyond the 12 mile limit and the international 
regime for the deep ocean floor. These revenues were intended as the 
quid pro quo for agreement on narrow territorial seas and a new right of 
free transit through international straits. 
Earlier this year, it became clear that this strategy was not working. Neither 
landlocked nor coastal states were rallying to the banner. In the meantime, 
Latin American States (Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Chile) were actively 
espousing a 200 mile territorial sea and were seeking -- with considerable 
success -- to cast the issue in terms of Developed versus Developing Countries. 
From afar, Communist China lent moral support to our antagonists, announcing 
sympathy for their efforts, i,vithout itself adopting an explicit territorial sea 
position. (The PRC has made extensive claims to seabeds under the East and 
South China Seas, which conflict with similar claims of Taiwan, Japan, the 
Philippines and South Vietnam. The areas involved are on the Continental 
Shelf as defined by international convention.) 
Our thinking has now shifted. It is clear that the crucial group for a successful 
conference are the coastal states as a class rather than a combination of land-
locked states and LDCs. The coastal states share a clear interest in as much 
control as they can get over the mineral and fish resources off their coasts. 
If this interest could be satisfied without a wide territorial sea, then most 
coastal states might be willing to accommodate us on our security interests 
(12 mile territorial sea and free straits passage). On the other hand, too 
great a satisfaction of the coastal states interest -- for example, an exclusive 
resources zone ? is self-defeating, for it could endanger our major objective 
of military mobility and free navigation. So our current strategy is to indicate 
willingness to accommodate coastal state desires for greater control over 
resources, but limited through internationally agreed standards, including 
machinery for compulsory settlement of disputes. 
At last summer's preparatory committee meeting, we found sentiment 
beginning to move our way on separating the issues of sovereignty from 
control over resources. Brazil, whose position on a ZOO mile sea remained

adamant, shows signs of beginning to feel lonely. As of now, things look 
good for a 12 mile territorial sea, uncertain on an acceptable mix of coastal 
state/international controls over the offshore resources, and depressing on 
free transit through straits. (Spain is engaged in a diplomatic offensive 
against it, and other straits countries (e.g. Italy) have difficulties with it.) 
It is by no means yet clear that there will be a Law of the Sea Conference in 
1973 -- much less a?successful one. We do, however, have the advantage of 
good working relations with the Soviets, who share our basic objectives. As 
a distant water fishing state, however, the Soviets are worried that our 
attitude on fisheries may be too favorable to coastal states. (The UK and 
Japan shstre that worry.) 
There is considerable sentiment for making the LOS Conference universal, 
thus including the PRC. Some of the hard-line Latin states have hopes of 
using that issue to abort the whole Law of the Sea exercise, if necessary. 
LOS matters will be discussed at the UN this fall and in another preparatory 
conference next spring.

PRC Views on Law of the Sea and Related Issues  
We have very little up-to-date information on Communist China's 
law of the sea position. 
On several occasions in the past year, the PRC has voiced sympathy 
for efforts of Latin American states to obtain a 200 mile territorial sea, 
but these statements seem intended to contribute to the "anti-imperialist" 
cause rather than to stake out a legal position. The PRC still claims a 
12-mile territorial sea for itself. 
The People's Republic also has extensive seabeds claims in the Yellow 
and the East and South China seas. They have not articulated the legal 
rationale, but are probably basing it on rights to the continental shelf. 
The 1958 Continental Shelf Convention gives coastal states sovereign 
rights over adjacent seabeds resources out to the 200 meter depth line 
and to the technologically exploitable shelf area beyond. Although the 
PRC is not a signatory to this (or any) Geneva Convention, they could base 
their position on these principles which are generally accepted as customary 
international law. 
Their claims conflict with those of other states (the ROC, Japan, 
Korea, South Vietnam, The Philippines) which also border on the continental 
shelf under the adjacent seas -- which are very shallow. The problem of 
where the national claims are delimited is complicated by the existence of 
islands whose ownership is disputed. 
The Senkakus involve us at this point, although we are about to relin-
quish our rights under the Okinawa Reversion Treaty. We take no position 
on permanent ownership, which is disputed by the two Chinas and Japan. 
There are also the Spratly islands in the South China Sea disputed by 
the two Chinas, South Vietnam, and The Philippines. 
Until now, the PRC has not been pushing its seabeds claims very 
aggressively. But if they enter the UN, they will certainly wish to parti-
cipate in the LOS negotiations, an ideal forum for more forcefully pressing 
their views.

What We Want and  
What We Can Get  
10/14/71 
1. Pressure on the Soviet Union. We want our China policy to show 
Moscow that it cannot speak for all communist countries, that it is to 
their advantage to make agreements with us, that they must take account 
of possible US-PRC cooperation -- all this without overdoing the Soviet 
paranoia. The beneficial impact on the USSR is perhaps the single biggest 
plus that we get from the China initiative. 
We have already achieved this. There is nothing the Chinese need 
do. Our interests here are congruent and we need only to continue on the 
path we have set out upon. Pressure on the Russians is something we 
1111 
obviously never explicitly point to. The facts speak for themselves. 
Moscow, since July 15, has already become more cooperative on many 
issues. Their motive -- and the objective consequence -- could be easing 
their Western flank to focus on their Eastern flank -- but that is China's 
problem, not ours. 
2. Taiwan. We will want to tie down Peking to a peaceful resolution of 
this problem. We want also to maintain relations with an old and faithful 
ally, both because of principle and for our reputation as a reliable and 
honorable partner. 
We thus have to work out some understanding with Peking which will 
allow enough time for the future of Taiwan to be determined peacefully -- with

TOP SECPET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY - 
this process hopefully far enough advanced so that the diplomatic relations 
problem is manageable when we reach the crucial period on this issue. 
This obviously is, as it always has been, the crunch issue. Peking has 
indicated it can accept a reasonable time frame. If it cannot, no further 
relationships will be possible. 
3. Impact on Hanoi. We would like constructive Chinese influence on 
Hanoi to make a reasonable negotiated settlement. Short of that we want 
their continued benevolent abstention on our efforts in Paris and willingness 
to see, and help guarantee, a negotiated solution to the war. We must 
strongly emphasize that time for this is running out and that our unilateral 
course Will then entail risks for everyone and distort our bilateral relations. 
The clear direction of our withdrawal policy, the fact that we don't 
threaten China with our Indochina actions, the link to our forces on Taiwan, 
and Chinese opposition to North Vietnamese domination of the area -- these 
all incline Peking to be halpful. 
On the other hand, the Chinese believe they 
let Hanoi down in 1954 and do not want to be in the position of pressuring 
their proletarian friends. 
Just by virtue of our initiatives with Peking (and Moscow) we have 
achieved the objective of making Hanoi nervous about her rear area. The 
initial shock effect of the July announcement may have temporarily slowed 
the negotiating process but over the longer term our China policy should help 
40 reach a settlement and induce Hanoi to abide by it. Peking publicly has

concentrated on ou 
withdrawals (without setting a time limit) and largely 
ignored Communist political demands. The PRC may have worked a little 
on the North Vietnamese given the latter's bitter reaction to the President's 
visits. 
A joint call for a negotiated settlement and for the future of Indochina 
to be left to the people there without outside interference would be useful. 
4. Asia in General. We will want to inhibit Peking's support of revolu-
tionary movements and any direct pressures on its neighbors. This in 
turn will give our Asian friends some tangible benefits from our China 
initiative and allow a safe reduction in U.S. forces. 
In 'recent years, the Chinese support for revolutionaries has been 
largely vocal. The tremendous domestic problems for the PRC plus the 
reduction of our presence should encourage the PRC to mute its efforts. 
We should subtly, but unmistakably,press Peking on this issue. Concretely, 
we might be able to get into the Presidential communique some language 
about noninterference, neither side seeking hegemony, and no one assuming 
an exclusive sphere of influence. 
Korea . We would like to ease the threat to South Korea. The Chinese 
may have a congruent interest in seeing tensions reduced, so as to get our 
forces out and keep the Japanese out. They have already pushed their 
North Korean ally to support the President's trip and start talking to the South 
111/ Koreans. Thus our objective is to get the Chinese to restrain their ally,

pointing out our mutual interest in a peaceful peninsula. 
6. South Asia.  
We want to keep hostilities from breaking out, but 
/ since India is the problem and Peking has no influence with her, there 
is little we can get from the Chinese. Nevertheless, the PRC doesn't 
want a wai either. A joint call against hostilities in the subcontinent 
might be helpful. The PRC might also be helpful in nudging Pakistan 
toward political realism in East Pakistan. 
7. Arms Control. We want to start educating the Chinese on these 
questions and begin drawing her into the arms control dialogue. They 
show little interest, and in particular don't want to be lassoed. We should 
not push Peking but make it clear that we will treat it on an equal basis 
with Moscow. We might obtain hot line and/or accidental war agreements. 
? Release of U.S. Prisoners. We want to get them out, preferably 
before the President's visit; if not then as a result of it. 
This should be achievable, especially for the two men related to 
Vietnam. Of the other two, Downey may be the most difficult case since 
he has a life sentence. In response to HAK's July pitch they said that se 
tences could be shortened for good behavior and said they would study the 
matter. Releasing our men would be an inexpensive, yet publicly very 
profitable, gesture for Peking. We should keep our requests low key for 
the time being this seems the best way to get results and means we 
would pay nothing for the men.

1110 problem like Taiwan 
? Trade. We will want to start increasing our exports to the mainland 
so as to compete with Japan and Europe. Except for wheat, there is little 
? prospect in the near future of substantial business. The Chinese don't 
seem much interested, but we should be able to get as a result of the 
? President's trip, some agreement to expand mutual commerce, including 
perhaps the sending of trade delegations for that purpose. 
? 10. Cultural, Scientific Exchanges, etc. We want movement in these 
areas to demonstrate concrete progress and results from the President's 
trip. It would in fact help to break clown the communication harriers and 
Chinese ignorance. In certain fields we could learn from the Chinese. The 
PRC believes thesre are side issues, suspect diversion away from knotty 
and reason we want these steps for domestic political 
gain. However,. we should make clear to them that the President cannot 
travel all the way to Peking and say merely that he had a discussion of 
long range issues. We should press hard for exchanges as a way to improve 
the climate for the resolution of more fundamental issues. 
11. Information on China. We want to know what's going on in the 
mainland and what the future holds. We should learn a great deal from 
these trips (e.g. during HAK's interim visit we might get insights into the 
internal struggle) the journalists and others who are now being let in, 
ongoing contacts with the PRC, and possible exchange programs. It is 
always useful to know one's adversary. And increased communication with

What the Chinese Want and

Presti. The Chinese want to take their rightful place in international 
affairs and deal as equals with other major powers (even while professing 
they are not 
"great" power, have no desire to follow the mistakes of 
the USSR and USA in stretching their hands out, and are concerned about 
all countries, big and small, especially the third world). 
This we have already given them in the July 15 announcement. It is 
generally in our interest. 
2. Counter-weight to the Soviet Union. The Chinese want to relieve 
themselves of the threat of a two-front war, introduce new calculations 
in Moscow about attacking or leaning on the PRC, and perhaps make the 
USSR more pliable in its dealings with Peking. Specifically from us they 
want assurances against US-USSR collusion. 
This too we have given Peking in our initiatives and clear policy of 
not letting Moscow be our only socialist interlocator. We cannot, of 
course, lava,: Peking over Moscow - indeed in the near term we have 
much more concrete business with the Russians - but the PRC does not 
expect this. We can assure the Chinese that we won't deliberately collude

our agreements with the USSR, such as ratifying the status quo in 
Europe and mutual force redactions there, can have the objective 
consequences of collusion by freeing the Soviet hands for pressures 
on their eastern flank. There is nothing we can or should do about 
this but acknowledge to the PRC that we recognize this reality and will 
be sensitive to it. 
. Restraint on Japa.n. The Chinese are ambivalent on this issue. 
Because of their bitter experiences in the war, they clearly do fear a 
resurgence of Japanese militarism despite the small Tokyo defense 
budgets and nuclear allergy. They see conflicting statements by U.S. 
officials, some of which suggest our encouragement of Japanese rear a-
o as to take over some defense burdens we are shedding under 
the Nixon Doctrine. On the other hand they must understand our point 
that the U.S. treaty with, and umbrella for, Japan dampens down 
Japanese military activity, and that a precipitous U.S. withdrawal from 
Asia would only feed Japanese militarism. Additionally, the Chinese 
want to erode US-Japanese ties and play us all against each other; they 
have already begun by meddling in Japanese domestic politics. 
Most importantly, we should not trade an old, and much more power-
ally for a somewhat less aggressive adversary. As for preventing 
ful, 
Japanese remilitarization, this can only be done by maintaining our influence 
in Asia, and this we will have to continue to make clea

Pakistan against her two big enemies, the USSR and India. However, 
they almost certainly don't want a subcontinent war, in which case they 
would have to deliver on their promises of support to Islamabad. 
We cannot join the lineup on either side. We have larger fundamental 
interests in much bigger India than in Pakistan, and we thus must keep 
influence in both places. Our overriding interest, aside from 
humanitarian relief, is to prevent hostilities which would put us in an

We can Cndicate the general direction of our policy, but we must 
make clear that formal diplomatic relations with the PRC will take time 
and be a gradual process. We cannot speculate on how we will sort 
relations with the PRC.

ARRIVAL STATEMENT 
It is with profound pleasure that I return to the People's Republic 
of China on behalf of President Nixon. I am here for discussions with 
Prime Minister Chou En-lai and other Chinese officials to make 
concrete arrangements for a truly historic occasion - the meeting 
between Chairman Mao Tse-Tung and the President of the United States. 
Our two countries are turning a new page in our histories. Now 
after two decades of separate paths and separate achievements we come 
together again on a fresh foundation of equality and mutual respect. 
The task that faces the leaders of our nations is to begin to bridge the 
gulf that has separated us for a generation and restore the historic bonds 
of two great peoples. 
President Nixon is dedicated to this objective, knowing full well that 
our differences are deep and that neither of us will barter away our 
principles. 
Thus I arrive here with the determination of the American government 
and the friendship of the American people. In this spirit, I warmly look 
forward to my talks with Chinese officials.

Toast (Beginning of Trip)  
Mr. Prime Minister, and our other distinguished hosts: 
I have returned to your capital with personal pleasure and 
anticipation: the pleasure of again seeing our gracious hosts and 
this capital city, the anticipation of stimulating discussion and 
important work. 
And I return with the sense of history, a feel for the tides 
that have brought us together. Surely our encounter is one that 
none of us would have imagined would ever take place. 
[Tell the Marshall's story on the way to the airport July 11.1 
During these past decades you enduredthe tribulations of the 
Long March. You surmounted what seemed like hopeless obstacles to 
establish your system. You have steered your country through 
twenty-two turbulent years. And you have maintained your positions 
in conflict against major powers. 
During this same period my country has carried global responsibilities 
flowing from the Second World War. We shed the historic isolationism fed 
by our ocean-bound geography. Faced with the vacuums of the post-war 
world, we ventured forth with characteristic exuberance into international 
affairs, shouldering broad tasks of security and development. We have 
placed men on the moon. And we have grappled with our own domestic 
problems, both those spawned by industrial progress and those that are 
the legacy of our mixed heritage.

For almost a generation, China and America have pursued their 
separate paths, so diverse and hardly touching. Yet here we are 
today, brought together by global trends. Clearly we will find the guarantee 
of each other's actions not in words, but in events; not in honeyed declara-
tions but in the objective situation we jointly confront. 
Mr. Prime Minister, I said in July that reality brought us together 
and reality will shape our future. 
Let us drink to that future. And let us work these coming days 
with a view to filling that future with peace and friendship between our 
two peoples.

Toast (End of Trip) 
Mr. Prime Minister, and our other distinguished hosts: 
Together we have done some extremely important work during 
these past few days. We have laid a sound basis for the historic 
meeting between the leaders of the People's Republic of China and 
President Nixon. In the process we have built upon the promising 
beginnings of July and further charted our countries courses. 
For us it has been a rich personal experience as well as a 
momentous assignment. We have once again been impressed by your 
dedication, stimulated by your skill, warmed by your hospitality --
and overwhelmed by your cuisine! 
My colleagues and I want to thank you for the grace and warmth 
which we have been received. I ask you now to join us in the celebration 
of the historic crossroads that lies months ahead and in the hope 
that that event will contribute to peace in the Pacific and peace in the 
world.

Possible Meeting_with Kao Tse-tung  
Mao Tse-tung has evidently been very much a factor in the PRC's 
decision to itririte the President to visit Peking, as witness the Edgar 
Snow interview with Mao in the April 30 issue of Life (Tab A). Mao told 
Snow that because at present the problems between China and the USA 
would have to be solved with Nixon, " Mao would be happy to talk with him 
either as a tourist or as President. 
Given the personal role of Mao it is conceivable that the Chinese may 
have you meet him to underscore this personal element and to have him 
reiterate to you, the President's representative, that he welcomes the 
Preside t's visit. Your meeting Mao would also emphasize, to both the 
Chinese ?people and world public opinion, that Mao is still very much 
involved in MC affairs, a point which was made only inferentially by 
Mao's session with Haile Selassie. 
If a meeting should take place, we would assume that Mao would not 
deal with matters of substance, at least in any detail. He might refer to 
the existence of U.S. -PRC problems, as he did in the Snow interview, but 
prefer to concentrate more on atmospherics. These would be important 
from bo standpoint, and in fact the chances of your seeing Mao would 
probably be increased if your discussions with Chou had gone well, 1. e. 
the Chinese were convinced that we were not going to take a tough line on 
matters of concern to them.

In these terms, a meeting between you and Mao would be more 
likely later rather than earlier. However, if the Chinse wanted to put 
a real stamp of approval on the President's visit by the Ultimate Authority, 
they could conceivably schedule the meeting early on. Domestic politics 
would have a bearing on the timing, and we have little information on this 
score which can serve as the basis for a judgment. 
In any event, you would wish to avoid substantive issues but take a 
positive attitude toward your own mission and toward the President's 
visit. You would welcome this opportunity to meet with Mao (who after all 
is a living legend) and express the President's and your own -- good will 
toward Mao and his associates. 
Your talking points might run as follows: 
-- I am extremely grateful to have this opportunity to meet Chairman 
Mao and convey to him personally the personal greetings of President 
Nixon. The President looks forward with warm anticipation to meeting 
with the Chairman and seeing this great country. 
-- The President has asked me to raffirmhis profourd commitment 
to the improvements of relations between our two countries for the sake of 
our two peoples and for the peoples of the world. The course we have chosen 
has been produced by conviction and reality, not by personalities or the 
prospects of political gain.

-- The President was quite touched by the welcome which the Chairman 
extended to him through the Chairman's interview with Edgar Snow. In 
this interview the Chairman spoke of problems between our two countries. 
The Chairman may be assured that the President will be prepared to deal 
with these problems frankly and in as forthcoming a manner as possible. 
- I hope that this philosophy has (already) (will) become apparent 
in my own discussions with PM Chou. 
-- Looking at the future relationship which might develop between the 
U. S. and the PRC, and setting aside questions of ideological conviction, 
I am convinced as a historian that our two countries have a legacy of 
fewer issues between us than is the case with almost any other relationship 
China has maintained with foreign countries over the centuries. 
-- I believe, in fact, that there is a tradition of friendship between 
the Chinese avid American peoples, and I earnestly hope that this friendship 
can be reestablished and developed further. I hope that the President's 
visit, for which I have come to help make concrete arrangements, will 
be a major contribution to this end.
