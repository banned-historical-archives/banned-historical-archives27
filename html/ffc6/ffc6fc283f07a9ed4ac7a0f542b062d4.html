 U.S. SENATE,
 SUBCOMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND TERRORISM,
 Washington, D.C., November 30,1983.
 Hon. STROM THURMOND,
 Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN : As you know, the Subcommittee on Security
 and Terrorism completed its inquiry into FBI operations undertaken
 pursuant to the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Security
 Investigations (Levi guidelines). The transcripts of these hearings
 were published in late 1982, and a subsequent followup hearing on At-
 torney General Smith's revisions to the guidelines was held on March
 25, 1983. The transcript of this hearing was published on September 6,
 1983.
 To augment the first series of hearings, I believe it will prove to be
 useful to have a report on the history of the FBI's involvement in
 issues of domestic security and subversion as well as an analysis of
 practices in effect prior to the "Smith" revisions. This analysis also
 covers the subcommittee hearings held on June 24, 25, August 11 and
 12,1982.
 It is with pleasure that I transmit to you this report. I am deeply
 indebted to Dr. Samuel T. Francis, of Senator John East's staff, for
 his assistance in its preparation.
 Sincerely,
 JEREMIAH DENTON,
 Chairman, Subcommittee on
 Security and Terrorism.

 This report has been prepared to accompany five hearings held on
 the domestic security guidelines by the Subcommittee on Security and
 Terrorism during the 97th and 98th Congresses. Testimony received
 examined not only the language of the 1976 guidelines, but, more im-
 portantly, how that language was interpreted by FBI officials and how
 the policy derived from those interpretations affected the Bureau's
 ability to collect intelligence on domestic groups, some of which had
 potential for violent activity. In his. testimony on June 24, 1982, Di-
 rector Webster acknowledged that some modifications of the domestic
 security guidelines might be in order and stated that, to that end, a
 review of the guidelines by the FBI and the Department of Justice
 was underway. After the subcommittee hearings were completed and
 the results studied by the Department of Justice, revised guidelines
 were prepared and submitted to the subcommittee in advance of their
 promulgation. The revised guidelines became effective on Monday,
 March 21,1983.
 In an effort t, summarize relevant portions of the hearings of the
 subcommittee on the guidelines, and to make this summary available
 in permanent form, the Judiciary Committee has chosen to publish a
 committee print on the "Impact of the Attorney General's Guidelines
 for Domestic Security Investigations". I am convinced that this print
 will serve as an important document which not only outlines the con-
 cerns about the domestic security guidelines, but also makes recommen-
 dations for revisions to the guidelines, which address those concerns.

 IMPACT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S GUIDELINES FOR
 DOMESTIC SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS (THE LEVI
 GUIDELINES)
 INTRODUCTION
 In an FBI Oversight Hearing before the Subcommittee on Security
 and Terrorism on February 4, 1982, Senator John P. East suggested
 that the chairman schedule hearings on the Attorney General's Guide-
 lines for Domestic Security Investigations by the FBI-the so-called
 Levi guidelines. Judge William Webster, Director of the FBI, had
 stated in response to questioning by Senator East that the FBI and
 the Department of Justice (DOJ) were currently reviewing and eval-
 uating the guidelines for the purpose of revising them. The chairman,
 as well as Senator Biden, agreed that there is a continuing need to
 evaluate the guidelines, and the subcommittee, pursuant to its over-
 sight responsibility for the FBI and its authority to investigate mat-
 ters pertinent to the internal security of the United States, scheduled
 hearings on the subject of the Levi guidelines. The hearings were held
 on June 24 and 25 and August 11 and 12,1982.
 The chairman, in his introductory remarks on June 24, 1982, ex-
 plained the concerns of the subcommittee and the purpose of the
 hearings :
 Of primary interest to the subcommittee will be the effect
 that these guidelines have had on the ability of the FBI and
 other agencies to gather information or intelligence and to
 discharge their domestic security and other responsibilities.'
 While praising the record of the FBI in the investigation of crime,
 foreign counterintelligence, and counterterrorist activities, the chair-
 man noted a gap in the investigative activities of the FBI :
 What seems to be missing, however, is attention to organiza-
 tions and individuals that cannot be shown to be controlled
 by a foreign power, and which have not yet committed a ter-
 rorist or subversive act, but which nevertheless in reality may
 represent a substantial threat to the safety of Americans and,
 ultimately, to the security of this country. * * * Recogniz-
 ing the limitations that have been imposed on the FBI, they
 would understandably attempt to hide themselves among
 other groups in areas well protected by the first amendment
 and thereby escape the scrutiny of the Bureau.2

 Senator East, in his opening statement, expressed a similar concern
 about the guidelines :
 It occurs to me that under these guidelines, with the criminal
 predicate concept, you must show criminal activity precedent
 to or imminent criminal activity precedent to criminal inves-
 tigation. It tends to throw up then a very real barrier to have
 to get over in terms of investigating a threat which by defini-
 tion and nature does not often lend itself to that kind of ap-
 proach. * * * Intelligence data is very important in this case
 to allow us to anticipate and to prevent genuine and real
 threats to this country in whatever form they might take.3
 Accordingly, the primary interest of the subcommittee, in this series
 of hearings, was to inquire into the effect of the Levi guidelines on
 FBI domestic security investigations and the gathering of domestic
 intelligence; the need for and value of domestic intelligence in ad-
 dressing the problems of counterterrorism, foreign counterintelli-
 gence, domestic subversion, and other internal security threats; and
 the remedies available to redress whatever shortcomings may exist in
 the current guidelines. The subcommittee was not primarily interested
 in the legal and constitutional problems of the authority for domestic
 security investigations nor in the largely administrative and budge-
 tary problem of the availability of resources with which the FBI con-
 ducts domestic security activities. Although the subcommittee recog-
 nized that both problems are important for the issue of domestic secu-
 rity, it chose to select the problem of the effect of the guidelines on
 internal security as its principal interest in the series of hearings.
 HISTORY OF AND AUTHORITY FOR FBI DOMESTIC SECURITY
 INVESTIGATIONS
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and its predecessor, the
 Bureau of Investigation, have been engaged in domestic security intel-
 ligence gathering and domestic security investigations since World
 War I. In 1924, Attorney General Harlan Fisk Stone curtailed most
 Bureau domestic security activities and intelligence gathering by man-
 dating that the Bureau of Investigation was "concerned only with such
 conduct as is forbidden by the laws of the United States." ? Although
 adherence to this "criminal standard" was not absolute in the follow-
 ing years, it did remove the FBI from most domestic security activities
 that did not involve the investigation of a violation of Federal law.
 In the 1930's, however, President Franklin D. Roosevelt expressed
 concern about the increasing indications of Communist, Fascist, and
 other subversive activities within the United States. At his direction
 the FBI again became involved in the investigation of and gathering
 of intelligence on such activities, and its role expanded as World War
 II approached, during the war, and during the development of the

 "Cold War" following 1945. From the end of World War II until
 the mid-1970's, the FtiI was broadly engaged in domestic security
 investigations, and, although the details of this activity were gener-
 ally not publicly known, there was broad public, congressional, and
 executive branch approval of the domestic security work of the FBI.
 In the early and mid-1970's, in the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict,
 in the "era of detente" with the Soviet Union, and following the rev-
 elation of abuses in the Watergate matter, domestic security investi-
 gations became far more controversial. Congressional committees and
 journalistic investigations discussed what were alleged to be abuses
 and excesses in the domestic security work of the FBI. It was in this
 climate of controversy that the FBI began to curtail its involvement
 in domestic intelligence and that Attorney General Edward H. Levi
 issued the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic Security In-
 vestigations on March 10, 1976. The guidelines went into effect on
 April 6, 1976.
 (B) AUTHORITY
 The FBI has cited a number of authorities for its involvement in
 domestic security investigations. A series of five Presidential direc-
 tives (June 26 and September 6, 1939, and June 8, 1943, issued by
 President Roosevelt; July 24, 1950, issued by President Truman; and
 December 15, 1953, issued by President Eisenhower) and memoranda
 from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover concerning private conversations
 and directives he had received from President Roosevelt in 1934 and
 1936 have been cited by the FBI as authorizing investigation of mat-
 ters pertaining to espionage, counterespionage, sabotage, violation of
 neutrality regulations, and subversive activities. The FBI has also
 cited Executive Order 10450 (April 27, 1953) and other Executive
 orders that deal with and authorize the Federal employees security
 program. Section 8(d) of E.O. 10450, which remains in force, re-
 quires that the FBI conduct a full field investigation of any individual
 who "may have been subjected to coercion, influence, or pressure to
 act contrary to the interests of the national security" or whose loyalty
 or security as an employee of the Federal Government is in question.
 The FBI has also cited statutory authority for its investigation of
 domestic security matters. The Federal statute 28 U.S.C. 533 states :
 The Attorney General may appoint officials-
 (1) to detect and prosecute crimes against the United
 States;
 (2) to assist in the protection of the person of the Presi-
 dent; and
 (3) to conduct such other investigations regarding official
 matters under the control of the Department of Justice and
 the Department of State as may be directed by the Attorney
 General.
 This section is drawn from the Department of Justice Appropriations
 Act of 1965, although similar language has been contained in each
 Appro riation Act since 1921, and the General Accounting Office
 (GAO), in a study. of FBI domestic security investigations published
 in 1976, found comparable language as early as 1871 in the Sundry

 Appropriations Act of that year.5 In testimony on December 11, 1975,
 before the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Opera-
 tions with Respect to Intelligence Activities, Attorney General Levi
 stated :
 The argument is sometimes made that the Bureau's proper
 role, at least in purely domestic matters, should be limited to
 investigations of committed crimes. The basic statute for the
 Bureau [28 U.S.C. 533] is broader. * * * it refers to investi-
 gations regarding official matters under the control of the
 Department of Justice and the Department of State as may
 be directed by the Attorney General.6
 A memorandum of March 31. 1977, from Mary C. Lawton, chairman
 of the FBI Guidelines Committee within DOJ, that was submitted
 for the record in a hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and
 Constitutional Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary of the House
 of Representatives on November 9, 1977, states in part :
 We recognize that express statutory authority for domestic
 security investigations is needed. In the interim, however, it
 is our view that the Supreme Court has found implicit consti-
 tutional authority to prevent crime and to collect intelligence
 for this purpose and that 28 U.S.C. 533 is sufficiently broad
 to permit the Attorney General to authorize such investiga-
 tions.'
 The same memorandum also argues that courts have found re-
 peatedly that the provisions of the U.S. Constitution-article II, sec-
 tion 1, requiring that the President take care that the laws be faith-
 fully executed ; article II, section 3, containing the Presidential oath
 to "preserve, protect, and defend" the Constitution ; and article IV,
 section 4, directing the Federal Government to protect the States
 against domestic violence-authorize preventive measures for law en-
 forcement purposes and that several court cases have suggested that
 intelligence collection is a reasonable means for the prevention of crim-
 inal conduct.
 The FBI response of August 30, 1982, to the question, submitted by

 In testimony before a Subcommittee of the Committee on Appro-
 priations of the House of Representatives on March 16, 1978, Direc-
 tor Webster provided the following account of the decrease in the
 number of FBI domestic security investigations in the 1970's: 9

 In the written response to questions from the subcommittee cited above,
 the FBI stated that as of August 20, 1982, it had u total of 38 current
 domestic security investigations, including 22 organizations and 16 in-
 dividuals. Of the 22 organizational investigations, 8 were being con-
 ducted at the level of "full investigation" under the Levi guidelines.
 Two conclusions may be drawn from these statistics: (a) During
 the last 9 years the domestic security investigations of the FBI declined
 by 99.8 percent, leading Director Webster to state publicly on May 3,
 1.978, that the FBI was "practically out of the domestic security field";
 and (b) although there was a decline of 77.3 percent in the number of
 domestic security investigations between 1973 and the imposition of
 the Levi guidelines on April 6,1976, there was a more dramatic decrease
 of 87 percent in the 9 months following their imposition and a far more
 precipitous decrease of 99 percent between their imposition and the
 current year. This decline in the number of domestic security investiga-
 tions prior to the Levi guidelines indicates that the FBI was reducing
 its domestic security work for some time before the guidelines were
 imposed, 'but the drastic decline following the imposition of the guide-
 lines strongly suggests that the guidelines themselves were the prin-
 cipal reason for the further decrease.
 Director Webster, however, expressed his belief that factors other
 than or in addition to the guidelines were responsible for this decrease.
 On June 24, 1982, the Director stated that these other factors included
 the facts that "some of the laws and regulations dealing with internal
 security matters have changed substantially" in the last 10 years and
 that "changes in the internal policies of the Bureau also affected the
 program."
 Investigations on "rank and file" members were discontinued,
 some were shifted to the Foreign Counterintelligence Guide-
 lines, and others were closed with the new emphasis on quality
 over quantity.lo
 The Director also pointed to "changes in the political climate" of the
 Nation and emphasized that some investigations for criminal activities
 may overlap with some domestic security matters, so that criminal in-
 vestigations may include domestic security matters, although they are
 not labeled as such.

 The changes in "laws and regulations" that Director Webster spe-
 cified were the abolition of the Attorney General's List of Subversive
 Organizations, the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act of 1950,
 and the discontinuation of "certain domestic intelligence investiga-
 tions conducted in support of the Government employees security
 program."
 The "List of Organizations Designated by the Attorney General
 Pursuant to Executive Order 10450" was authorized by E.O. 10450 and
 continued to be published until, on June 4, 1974, President Nixon is-
 sued Executive Order 11785, which abolished the Attorney General's
 List. The Emergency Detention Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 811-826) was
 repealed by Act of Congress on September 25, 1971 (85 Stat. 345,
 ? 2(a) ). It will be noted that, even after the abolition of the Attorney
 General's List and the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act, the
 FBI continued to conduct thousands of domestic security investiga-
 tions. A memorandum of October 22, 1971, from Attorney General
 John N. Mitchell to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, stated in part:
 With respect to your initial inquiry, I wish to advise you that
 the FBI's authority to investigate violations of the espionage,
 sabotage, Smith Act, Atomic Energy Act and related statutes,
 as well as subversive activities and related matters in accord-
 ance with its statutory responsibilities and the Presidential
 directives [see above], cited in your memorandum, remains
 unaffected by the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act."
 And in a memorandum of November 19, 1974, to FBI Director Clar-
 ence M. Kelley, in reference to the effect of E.O. 11785 on FBI investi-
 gative activities, Mr. Glen E. Pommerening, Assistant Attorney Gen-
 eral for Administration, stated in part :
 It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior
 communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characteriza-
 tions and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting
 the investigations of such organizations if their programs call
 for acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of the
 commission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these
 programs.12
 The import of these memoranda and of the statistical data showing
 the continuation of FBI domestic security investigations on a large
 scale after the abolition of the Attorney General's List and the repeal
 of the Emergency Detention Act appears to be that the legal authority
 for FBI domestic security investigations was not seriously affected or
 limited by these legal changes and that these changes did not compel
 the numerical decreases in domestic security investigations in the early
 1970's. Such changes may have contributed to the elimination of a
 legally mandated need for certain kinds of domestic security investiga-
 tions and they may have instigated a change of attitudes on the part
 of some FBI officials toward the need or value of some kinds of inves-
 tigations, but these changes in themselves did not limit or remove the
 legal authority for domestic security investigations. Director Webster

 himself, in the statement before the House subcommittee on March 16,
 1978, cited above, said specifically that
 Domestic security investigations in the FBI underwent a
 radical change, both in number and in scope, as a result of the
 adoption on April 6, 1976, of the Attorney General's Guide-
 lines for Domestic security Investigations, which were im-
 plemented on that date.13
 and he did not attribute the decrease in numbers to changes in the
 statutory authority for such investigations.
 Director Webster, in his statement of 1978 as well as in his testimony
 on June 24, 1982, also referred to changes in FBI internal policy that
 served to reduce the number of domestic security investigations. It is
 true that changes in FBI internal policy had this effect. Prior to the
 imposition of the Levi guidelines, aomestic intelligence gathering was
 conducted by the Intelligence Division (Division 5) of the FBI, which
 also conducted Foreign Counter Intelligence (FCI) investigations.
 These domestic intelligence investigations were not necessarily predi-
 cated on prior or imminent criminal conduct on the part of the sub-
 jects of the investigations, but were conducted for the purpose of
 gathering intelligence on subversive activities, whether in violation of
 the law or not. Following the adoption of the guidelines, the criminal
 predicate contained within them required indication of prior or im-
 minent criminal conduct on the part of the subjects as a precondition
 for the opening of a domestic security investigation. The adoption of
 this criminal predicate led to the removal of domestic security inves-
 tigations from Division 5 and their transference to Division 6, the Gen-
 eral Investigative Division of the FBI, which conducts investigations
 of criminal matters in general. Investigations of some matters previ-
 ously included under domestic security investigations, which did not
 necessarily involve the violation of law but did concern national se-
 curity (for example, the Communist Party U.S.A.), were retained in
 Division 5 as part of the FCI program. The conclusion must be, there-
 fore, that although the adoption of the Levi guidelines did lead to the
 transference of some domestic security matters to criminal investiga-
 tive authorities, the criminal predicate of the guidelines themselves
 was primarily responsible for the elimination of large numbers of
 domestic security investigations, and indeed that the Levi guidelines
 themselves were the principal cause of the drastic decline in the num-
 ber of FBI domestic security investigations after March 1976.
 IMPACT OF THE LEVI GUIDELINES ON DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE
 The Levi guidelines impose a "criminal standard" or "criminal pre-
 dicate" for the initiation and continuation of domestic security investi-
 gations. Section I-"Bases of Investigation"-of the guidelines states :
 Domestic security investigations are conducted, when author-
 ized under Section II(C), II(F), or II(I), to ascertain infor-
 mation on the activities of individuals, or the activities of
 groups, which involve or will involve the use of force or vio-

 8
 lence and which involve or will involve the violation of fed-
 eral law, for the purpose of :
 (1) overthrowing the government of the United States or
 the government of a State;
 (2) substantially interfering, in the United States, with
 the activities of a foreign government or its authorized
 representatives;
 (3) substantially impairing for the purpose of influencing
 U. . government policies or decisions :
 (a) the functioning of the government of the United
 States;
 (b) the functioning of the government of a State; or
 c) interstate commerce;
 4) depriving persons of their civil rights under the Con-
 stitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. 114
 The guidelines establish three levels of investigation-preliminary,
 limited, and full-each of which is initiated under distinct procedures
 and under each of which different investigative' techniques may be
 used.
 A preliminary investigation is authorized "on the basis of allega-
 tions or other information" that an individual or group is engaged or
 will be engaged in the use of force or violence, which involves or will
 involve the violation of Federal law, for the specific purposes cited in
 the guidelines. A preliminary investigation is restricted to the gather-
 ing of information or allegations that led to the investigation. During
 a preliminary investigation, therefore, the FBI is confined to examin-
 ing its own files and indices; public sources of information; other Fed-
 eral, State, and local records; and existing sources and previously es-
 tablished informants. During a preliminary investigation the FBI
 may conduct physical surveillance and interviews restricted to the
 identification of the subject of the investigation. Although a prelimi-
 nary investigation may be initiated by the Special Agent in Charge
 (SAC) of a field office of the FBI and does not require FBI Head-
 quarters (FBIHQ) approval, all preliminary investigations must be
 closed within 90 days of their initiation unless an extension of 90 days
 is obtained from FBIHQ; such an extension must be justified.
 A limited investigation must be authorized in writing by an SAC
 or by FBIHQ if the preliminary level is unable to verify or refute
 the bases of the investigation. The only differences between the tech-
 niques permissible in a preliminary and limited investigation is that,
 in the latter, the FBI may conduct physical surveillance and inter-
 views for purposes other than identifying the subject, but only with
 the authorization of the SAC and under restrictions. In neither a
 limited nor a preliminary investigation may the FBI recruit or em-
 place informants within groups, make use of "mail covers" (that is,
 examination of the outside of mail to learn the addressee, addressor,
 or the date and place of posting), or make use of any electronic sur-
 veillance. A limited investigation is continued, terminated, or ex-
 tended under the same conditions as a preliminary investigation.

 Approved For Release 2008/10/22 : CIA-RDP90BOl370R000500780020-0
 The third level of investigation-the full investigation-may make
 use of the techniques prohibited in the preliminary and limited levels,
 but only under restrictions and with the approval of FBIHQ or the
 Attorney General. Full investigations must be authorized by FBIHQ
 and
 They may only be authorized on the basis of specific and
 articulable facts giving reason to believe that an individual
 or a group is or may be engaged in activities which involve
 the use of force or violence and which involve or will involve
 the violation of federal law * * * 15
 for the purposes specified in section I of the guidelines. Full in-
 vestigations are reviewed annually by DOJ, which determines
 whether a full investigation may continue, and no full investigation
 may continue beyond a year without authorization by DOJ.. FBIHQ
 or the Attorney General (or his designee) may terminate any domes-
 tic security investigation at any level at any time.
 Although the adoption of a criminal standard for domestic security
 investigations has served to curtail the number of such investigations,
 the restrictions on the techniques of investigation and the procedures
 for authorization and termination have also tended to inhibit the
 gathering of information pertinent to internal security and law en-
 forcement. In a preliminary.,investigation, the FBI may not obtain
 any information that is not already in its possession or in the posses-
 sion of other governmental or public sources or which cannot be ob-
 tained from existing sources and informants, and its investigation is
 normally limited to 90 days. In a limited investigation, the same re-
 strictions apply, except that the FBI may conduct physical surveil-
 lance and interviews other than for the identification of the subject.
 Since any domestic security investigation is predicated on the basis
 of alleged current or imminent criminal conduct, and since it may
 be presumed that a party involved in or planning criminal activities
 would make efforts to conceal such involvement from authorities and
 from public sources of information, there may be some question about
 the usefulness of the preliminary and limited levels of investigation
 for the discovery, prevention, and apprehension of criminal conduct.
 Although a criminal standard has an inhibitive effect on the prelimi-
 nary and limited levels of domestic security investigations, a far more
 restrictive criminal predicate is required for the initiation of a full
 investigation. While the preliminary and limited levels of investiga-
 tion are initiated "on the basis of allegations or other information" in-
 dicating current or imminent criminal activities, a full investigation
 may be initiated only "on the basis of specific and articulable facts
 giving reason to believe" that criminal conduct is current or im-
 minent. A mere allegation of such conduct is not sufficient, regardless
 of the reliability of the source of the allegation. In addition to the
 "specific and articulable facts," FBIHQ must also consider other fac-
 tors in authorizing a full investigation. These other factors are-
 (1) the magnitude of the threatened harm,
 (2) the likelihood it will occur,

 Approved For Release 2008/10/22 : CIA-RDP90BOl370R000500780020-0
 10
 (3) the immediacy of the threat, and
 (4) the danger to privacy and free expression posed by a full
 investigation.
 The more stringent criminal standard required for a full investiga-
 tion, and the inclusion as well of other factors as grounds for author-
 izing a full investigation, suggest that it is very difficult to move from
 the preliminary or limited levels of investigation (in which only cer-
 tain kinds of information can be obtained or sought and only by cer-
 tain very limited techniques) to the full investigation. This suggestion
 is borne out by statistics of current domestic security investigations;
 of 38 domestic security investigations current in August 1982, only 8
 were being conducted at the level of full investigation.
 The formulation of the criminal standard in the Levi guidelines re-
 quires, at all levels of investigation, an indication of the violation of
 Federal law in addition to the use of force or violence. In other words,
 the use of force or violence and a violation of State law by a subject
 would not ordinarily be sufficient to initiate a domestic security inves-
 tigation by the FBI under the Levi guidelines. Although the FBI is
 primarily an investigative, law enforcement, and counterintelligence
 agency for the Federal Government, it has historically provided in-
 valuable assistance to local and State law enforcement agencies that
 do not possess the resources or skills to undertake by themselves ade-
 quate investigations of a domestic security nature. The restriction of
 the criminal standard of the guidelines to Federal law therefore tends
 to limit the value of the FBI to local and State agencies that have
 legitimate interests in domestic security matters within their
 jurisdictions.
 NEED FOR DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE BY FEDERAL AGENCIES
 In addition to a need for domestic intelligence at the State and local
 levels, there is also a continuing need for such intelligence by Federal
 agencies that must know the potential for a terrorist attack on their
 facilities or persons or institutions under their protection. Such agen-
 cies include the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police as well as
 others. The U.S. Department of State, for example, welcomes to the
 United States many foreign dignitaries who are often the target of
 dissident demonstrations or are the potential targets of terrorist at-
 tacks. The State Department, therefore, has a continuing need to know
 the potential for such attacks by domestic groups, and it must turn
 principally to the FBI for assessments of this danger. The U.S. De-
 partment of Energy also requires information on groups likely to
 target nuclear or other energy facilities for violent attacks or demon-
 strations. The Department of Defense also needs to know what civilian
 groups or individuals are likely to target DOD installations and per-
 sonnel for disruption or attack.
 The subcommittee undertook to inquire into the need of such Federal
 agencies for domestic intelligence and the degree to which these needs
 were being fulfilled by the FBI under the Levi guidelines. Conse-
 quently, representatives of the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Park
 Police, and some local and State agencies were invited to appear before
 the subcommittee. Also appearing before the subcommittee for the

 same purpose were former officers and agents of such organizations
 who gave their opinion and expert testimony on the intelligence re-
 quirements of their former agencies and the degree to which these re-
 quirements can be fulfilled under the Levi guidelines.
 In a publication issued by the General Counsel of the U.S. Depart-
 ment of the Treasury in August 1981 (Management Review on the
 Performance of the V.S. Department of the Treasury in Connection
 with the March 30,1981, Assassination Attempt on President Ronald
 Reagan), it was stated :
 From the protection-oriented perspective of the [Secret]
 Service, therefore, the decline in FBI domestic intelligence
 activities has caused a critical overall decline in the useful in-
 formation the Service receives from the FBI. In November
 1979 Secret Service Director Stuart Knight testified before
 the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Service was, at that
 time, receiving only about 40 percent of what it had previously
 received from the FBI, and that this reduced intelligence
 product had deteriorated in quality. Explaining what he
 meant by quality, he referred to the loss of information con-
 cerning motives and plans.
 Knight repeated these statements in the aftermath of the
 March 30 assassination attemt, in testimony before other
 committees of the House and p Senate, specifically attributing
 this loss of useful intelligence to the Attorney General's Do-
 mestic Security Guidelines.'?
 And one of the recommendations that the Management Review issued
 was that
 Consideration should be given to permitting the FBI to pur-
 sue domestic security investigations where no criminal pred-
 icate is available; this may be done through appropriate mod-
 ifications of the Attorney General's Domestic Security
 Guidelines for the FBI.17
 A similar view was presented to the subcommittee on August 11,
 1982, by Mr. John M. Walker, Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Treasury
 for Enforcement and Operations. Mr. Walker pointed out that the
 Secret Service is responsible for the protection of the persons of the
 President and Vice President of the United States, of foreign heads
 of government and state while visiting the United States, of the major
 candidates for President and Vice President during Presidential cam-
 paigns, and of certain other persons as designated (for example, the
 immediate families of the President and Vice President or of other
 protectees, former Presidents or Vice Presidents, and other foreign
 or official representatives as designated). The Secret Service, however,
 is primarily a consumer of domestic security information that bears
 on the threats presented to these protectees. It does not normally col-
 lect such intelligence itself, and it lacks the institutional capability
 of collecting and analyzing such intelligence adequately.

 Mr. Walker emphasized that the Secret Service is concerned with
 the threats to its protectees presented by
 the terrorist, a group-affiliated individual whose motivation
 and identity are acquired through that group. The Secret
 Service needs to know about this kind of person and about
 the intentions and activities of a number of terrorist groups."'
 Although acknowledging that the FBI has "broad statutory juris-
 diction" over the investigation of domestic terrorist groups, Mr.
 Walker pointed out that
 The Secret Service is primarily a consumer of this type of
 information as opposed to a collector. In order to effectively
 carry out its mission, the Secret Service has traditionally re-
 lied heavily on the FBI as the major source for the investiga-
 tion of domestic terrorist groups and the gathering of intelli-
 gence on their activities. The Service needs information de-
 scribing the location, structure, plans and activities of poten-
 tially violent groups as well as reports furnishing background
 data and current activities of individual group members. The
 purpose of this information is to put the Service in a posi-
 tion of preventing attacks, not just reacting to them.19
 Mr. Walker further indicated that recent reductions in the domestic
 security investigative activities of the FBI had had a harmful effect
 on the ability of the Secret Service to carry out its mission.
 The problem is that the FBI has been hindered in collecting
 certain vital information about groups by the Attorney Gen-
 eral's domestic security guidelines. * * * Prior to the Levi
 Guidelines, the Secret Service received from the FBI a vast
 amount of intelligence information on individuals and poten-
 tially violent groups who might be considered to be threats
 to domestic security. There was a considerable amount of
 valuable information contained in these referrals.20
 Mr. Walker also emphasized that the present lack of adequate intel-
 ligence forthcoming from the FBI was not in any way due to a lack of
 cooperation between the FBI and the Secret Service :
 The level of cooperation between the U.S. Secret Service and
 the FBI has never been better. The Secret Service is satisfied
 that it gets all of the intelligence information which the FBI
 has with respect to individuals and groups who constitute a
 potential threat to the President and other protected
 persons.21
 Although Mr. Walker expressed his satisfaction that "the reduction
 of the quantity of reports furnished is not per se the major problem,"
 he emphasized that
 The problem is that there are important areas of investiga-
 tion that are not being pursued since the guidelines have been
 in effect. As a result of the 1976 guidelines, the most notable

 lack of information in reports received from the FBI occur-
 red in those areas describing the location, structure, plans
 and activities of numerous radical and emigre groups 22
 The Director of the U.S. Secret Service, Mr. John R. Simpson, sub-
 mitted similar testimony :
 Quite simply, it is my view that the guidelines, as presently
 structured, impose an unrealistic and unnecessary barrier to
 the collection of essential information.
 As the guidelines are written and interpreted, a preliminary
 investigation by the FBI, the lowest category of domestic
 intelligence investigations, will not be undertaken in the ab-
 sence of an allegation or other information indicating that
 an individual or group will use force or violence in violating
 a Federal law. Such a policy, in my view, falls a little short
 of telling a police officer to patrol with his eyes closed unless
 and until he is hit with a brick. Unfortunately, as the history
 of assassinations points out, such an after-the-fact response
 is likely to be too little and too late. * * * What we would
 hope to see recognized by the guidelines, however, is the fact
 that the Government cannot make intelligent and informed
 decisions concerning potential sources of political terrorism
 in a vacuum. It is only with a broad-based knowledge of what
 is happening in society at large that good decisions concern-
 ing the focus of law enforcement resources can be made .23
 Mr. Walker, in his testimony, had emphasized a similar point, that
 it is as necessary for the Secret Service to know where its applica-
 tion of resources is not needed as it is to know where it is. In order
 for the Secret Service to make such judgments, it requires adequate
 intelligence on domestic groups and individuals and their potential
 threat.
 In addition to the testimony of high-level administrators in the
 Treasury Department and the Secret Service, the subcommittee also
 received the testimony of a former special agent of the U.S. Secret
 Service. Mr. Dario O. Marquez served for 8 years with the Secret Serv-
 ice in New York and Los Angeles as a criminal investigator, coordi-
 nated security arrangements for many heads of state and government
 visiting the United States, and traveled with Secretary of State Henry
 A. Kissinger and Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Marquez
 is currently President of MVM Corporation, a private firm specializ-
 ing in industrial security consulting. Both his experience while an
 agent of the Secret Service and his current professional concerns were
 highly relevant to the interests of the subcommittee.
 Mr. Marquez was highly critical of the criminal standard of the
 Levi guidelines and gave firsthand testimony about its inadequacies.
 On November 19, 1977, elements of the terrorist group known as the
 Weather Underground Organization (WUO) were arrested in Los
 Angeles, Calif., and Houston, Tex., and charged in connection with a
 conspiracy to bomb the offices of California State senator John Briggs.

 as the head of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee, a support
 group for the WUO. At the time of the arrests, Mr. Marquez was an
 investigator for the Secret Service in the Los Angeles area and was

 tionary Committee of the Weather Underground and the

 nately for all concerned, the FBI had infiltrated two agents
 into the revolutionary committee approximately 4 years prior
 to the issuance of the Levi guidelines. Because of the informa-
 tion provided by those undercover agents, the planned bomb-
 ing was prevented. Under the now current regulations, the
 FBI would be extremely limited in what it could do prior
 to the groups committing or threatening to commit a criminal
 act. This standard is totally unsatisfactory with regard to the
 protective mission of the Secret Service. This is all the more
 unfortunate when you consider that domestic terrorist groups
 have a history of telegraphing their intentions by publishing
 their views, goals, and occasionally their planned actions.211
 Mr. Marquez concluded his testimony by emphasizing that
 The current problem is that the Levi guidelines hinder the
 adequate protection of this country's leaders. The weakness in
 the guidelines is the threshold standard for opening a prelim-
 inary inquiry, limited investigation or full investigation.
 Advocacy of violence ought to be sufficient to initiate a pre-
 liminary inquiry, particularly when protectees of the Secret
 Service are the potential victims. * * *
 Protection to be effective must be preventive and not reac-
 tive. Good intelligence has always been the first perimeter of
 defense in the protection business. The Levi guidelines are a
 reactive approach to gathering intelligence. Thus, the agency
 which has been charged with providing the information nec-
 essary to adequately protect our leaders has been effectively
 removed from the intelligence business. * * *
 Under the current guidelines, the FBI and the U.S. Secret
 Service cannot perform the most rudimentary surveillance.
 Yet the first question legitimately asked after each attempted
 assassination is why didn't the FBI and Secret Service un-
 cover the danger before the attempt was made.25
 Also submitting testimony on August 11, 1982, was Mr. Lynn H.
 Herring, Chief of the U.S. Park Police of the U.S. Department of
 the Interior. Chief Herring described the duties of the Park Police :
 Our primary responsibility is to provide a full range of
 police services in certain areas administered by the National
 Park Service. Moreover, we-have responded to other areas of
 the National Park System for major law enforcement prob-
 lems. These problems frequently involve some form of rally,

 demonstration, or action of a specific group. In Washington,
 D.C., * * * parks and monuments are an integral part of
 the seat of Government. We provide police services for
 groups engaged in protests, demonstrations and other public
 gatherings on a daily basis. * * *
 We are without any hard intelligence information concerning
 groups, their leaders and key members who are issued protest
 and demonstration permits.26
 Asked to discuss the impact of the Levi guidelines on the ability
 of the Park Police to estimate the potential for disruption by a demon-
 stration or group, Chief Herring replied :
 Well, prior to April 1976-the Levi guidelines-we would
 obtain more information, hard intelligence might be a way I
 would express it, on the various groups that we anticipated
 in the demonstration. Therefore, as stressed earlier by my
 colleagues from the Secret Service, that would give us an
 opportunity to plan for the necessary manpower allocation
 to provide for public safety and protection.
 Without this information, it is very difficult to know what
 to anticipate, so you can only plan according to the informa-
 tion that you have at hand .27
 Chief Herring also described two incidents in which the lack of
 intelligence and information on planned de-nonstrations proved dan-
 gerous to the public safety.
 When the Shah of Iran was at the White House with Presi-
 dent Carter [November 1977], at that time, we did not have
 any information concerning the probability of violence by the
 anti-Shah group. Of course, the subsequent disorder did, as
 you are well aware, receive widespread news media attention.
 In order for us to bring the group under control, we had to
 utilize tear gas which naturally attracted national attention.
 One of the things that I might mention is that due to the lack
 of this information, and I might add without prior experience
 with this particular group, we could not know the anti-Shah
 group was armed with 2 by 4's, wooden sticks, and closet
 dowels, that were used as clubs; and, in some cases, they ac-
 tually had 1/2-inch-thick plastic shields that were camouflaged
 as placards and signs. Until the actual violence and civil dis-
 order took place, we were not aware that these signs were
 actually protective shields. * * * At one point, without any
 provocation whatsoever, the anti-Shah group attacked both
 the police, anyone who was in their way, in fact, and the pro-
 Shah group with a very severe nssau]t, causing and inflicting
 many injuries on the pro-Shah demonstrators as well as many
 of our officers.28
 A second incident in which the Park Police experienced a need for
 intelligence on the capabilities and intentions of an extremist group
 prior to a demonstration occurred in January 1979.

 More recently, in January 1979, when the Chinese Vice Pre-
 mier, Teng Hsiao-Ping, visited the United States, there was
 supposed to be a welcoming committee for the Vice Premier.
 As it ended up, there were people within that group that-
 from the information that we later received-were at least
 associated with the Revolutionary Communist Party, called
 the RCP. We did not have, I might add, information prior to
 this event. We were caught completely by surprise. Most of
 these participants were carrying water-soaked handkerchiefs
 and missiles. They carried clubs with railroad flares affixed
 to the ends and bags of marbles that they used against our
 horse-mounted officers to hinder the effectiveness of the
 horses. The demonstrators threw rocks, bottles, fish hooks,
 fish hook weights, and metal fragments.
 They had nails made which were soldered together like stars,
 so that regardless of the direction that they were thrown, you
 would be pierced with a pointed nail. We also discovered two
 Molotov cocktail pipe bombs which did not ignite during the
 assault-the attack. In this particular incident, we also had
 many officers who were injured .211
 Chief Herring also indicated that the Levi guidelines had exerted
 a harmful effect on the ability of the Park Police to make photographs
 of demonstrations and individuals taking part in them.
 Well, prior to the Levi guidelines, we received, on occasions,
 many photographs of individuals and groups that had caused
 violence and civil disobedience in other towns or areas
 throughout the United States, even in other countries, in some
 cases.
 By having these photographs, of course, as stated earlier, it
 would indicate the probability of violence. * * * we have
 found in the past, that many times we have a demonstration
 involving a very peaceful organization that has no record at
 all of any violence or civil disorder. But some of the people
 will infiltrate, by whatever means, covertly or overtly, and
 they will use this peaceful organization as a shield, in order to
 promote civil disorder or violence.20
 In a statement submitted to the subcommittee after the hearing on
 August 11, 1982, Chief Herring reiterated his criticism of the Levi
 guidelines :
 Prior to April, 1976, the Federal Bureau of Investigation
 provided us [the U.S. Park Police] with information about
 groups, their members and leaders. Since April 1976, that in-
 formation has been greatly reduced. For the most part, we
 only receive information about groups which present an im-
 mediate threat to our officers. For example, the FBI may tell
 us that they have heard that a group is coming to Washing-
 ton for a demonstration and that they have information that
 some members of the group have weapons. Yet, because of the

 Levi Guidelines, this information cannot be confirmed. nor can
 it be regarded as "hard" intelligence as a result of the Levi
 restrictions.
 As a result, we do not have an effective intelligence capabil-
 ity.31
 In a letter of December 3, 1982, signed by Mr. J. Craig Potter for
 Mr. G. Ray Arnett, Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks
 of the U.S. Department of the Interior, Mr. Potter stated, in response
 to questions submitted by the chairman of the subcommittee :
 The intelligence that we [the U.S. Park Police] currently
 receive from other Agencies and sources, i.e., newspapers,
 magazines, and house organs, is less than adequate because
 this information is not fully validated. Prior to the Levi
 Guidelines, we were reasonably confident that the Force was
 receiving intelligence that had been processed and pro-
 nounced as reliable.82
 The letter also indicated the directions in which the guidelines should
 be revised :
 We feel that several aspects of the Guidelines could be exam-
 ined for clarification and possible improvement. For example,
 the requirements necessary Co begin an intelligence investiga-
 tion, the application of the criminal standard, and the time
 limit placed on "full" investigations appear to be areas for
 consideration.-
 In addition to receiving the testimony of representatives of those
 Federal law enforcement and security agencies that are affected by the
 Levi guidelines, the subcommittee also sought the expert testimony of
 local law enforcement personnel involved in law enforcement, security,
 or demolitions work.
 On August 12, 1982, the subcommittee received the testimony of De-
 tective Arleigh McCree, officer-in-charge, Firearms and Explosives
 Unit, Los Angeles Police Department. Detective McCree, in addition
 to providing the subcommittee with extensive materials and expert
 testimony on the extent and nature of extremist and violent groups
 in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere, also criticized the Levi guide-
 lines as well as other laws and regulations that, in his opinion, have
 exerted a harmful effect on law enforcement intelligence collection :
 I have observed a gradual decaying process in our ability to
 separate the hoodlums and the terrorists from the law abid-
 ing community. This has been brought about by the dis-
 mantling of the intelligence community, both on a national
 and local level.
 I am fearful that this well intended, but absurd attitude on
 the part of Federal and local policy makers will ultimately
 take a terrible toll in lives. * * *

 Like all law enforcement agencies, we in Los Angeles are
 being hamstrung by local right to privacy type rules; in
 fact, the Levi Guidelines were used as a model to adopt our
 intelligence gathering rules.34
 Inspector Fred W. Raines, Director of the Investigative Services
 Division of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department,
 submitted similar testimony. Inspector Raines stated that-
 Every day, our police department is faced with situations
 such as demonstrations of one sort or another, assassination
 threats or attempts, bomb threats or bombings, assaults, and
 other miscellaneous crimes. The city has visiting dignitaries
 virtually every single day. * * * The value of intelligence in
 assuring the protection of life and property in this city is of
 utmost importance, particularly in terms of allowing the de-
 partment to know where to direct manpower and equipment
 resources. The less information we receive, the less efficient
 we are in carrying out our responsibilities. This is particu-
 larly true in the area of domestic security.86
 Inspector Raines also expressed dissatisfaction with the current state
 of domestic security intelligence provided by the FBI to the Metro-
 politan Police :
 We do not keep figures on how much information we obtain
 from the FBI, but I can tell you that we receive less than I
 would like. From conversations that our staff members have
 had at meetings and conventions attended by members of
 other law enforcement agencies, this decreasing inclination to
 share is not directed solely toward our department. Like other
 law enforcement agencies, we rely on the Bureau for informa-
 tion and feedback.36
 General Order 304-11 of the Metropolitan Police Department, issued
 on August 1, 1976, established what is essentially a criminal standard
 for the Investigative Service Division, and, on September 13, 1979,
 the Department issued "Guidelines for Domestic Security Investi-
 gations" that are essentially identical to the Levi guidelines themselves.
 The effect of the Levi guidelines on local and State law enforcement
 intelligence agencies is thus twofold :
 (1) because of the dependence of these agencies on the more
 extensive and sophisticated resources of the FBI, the inability of
 the FBI to collect, retain, and analyze domestic intelligence re-
 duces the quality as well as the quantity of intelligence available
 to State and local agencies ; and
 (2) one result of the adoption of the Levi guidelines by DOJ
 in 1976 has been the adoption of similar or identical guidelines by
 at least some important metropolitan police departments (for ex-
 ample, those of the District of Columbia, with special responsi-
 bilities affecting the security of the seat of the national govern-
 ment and the security of distinguished foreign visitors, and

 of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the United States and an
 area in which a number of extremist organizations and individ-
 uals have been active).
 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE "BRINKS ROBBERY" FOR DOMESTIC SECURITY
 The subcommittee took notice of an incident involving the internal
 security of the United States and the effectiveness of FBI domestic
 security functions growing out of the so-called Brinks robbery in
 Clarkstown, Rockland County, N.Y., on October 20, 1981. During the
 course of this robbery three individuals were murdered and $1,-
 589,000 was stolen from a Brinks armored car. The trial of the de-
 fendants and investigations by Federal, State, and local authorities
 were still in course at the time of the hearings and the writing of this
 report.
 Two individuals arrested in connection with the robbery soon after
 its occurrence were members of an organization known as the May
 19th Communist Organization, which was described by Detective Mc-
 Cree to the subcommittee : "This so-called May 19th Communist Orga-
 nization was nothing more than a splitoff from the Weatherman to
 start with. It was the east coast split." ST Following the FBI Oversight
 hearing before the Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism on Feb-
 ruary 4, 1982, the FBI submitted information about the May 19th
 Communist Organization in a letter from Director Webster' to the
 chairman dated June 8,1982:
 May 19th [Communist Organization] is the East Coast
 branch and an off-shoot of the PFOC [Prairie Fire Organiz-
 ing Committee], which was the surface support group of the
 "old" WUO [Weather Underground Organization]."
 The May 19th Communist Organization was founded in the mid to
 late 1970's. It published a manifesto entitled "Principles of Unity of
 the May 19th Communist Organization," which, from internal evi-
 dence, can be dated as having been written or produced between Jan-
 uary and July 1979. In this manifesto there appear several passages
 that are supportive of political violence, terrorism, and so-called na-
 tional liberation movements (that is, terrorist and guerrilla insur-
 gencies) in the underdeveloped countries and elsewhere. One typical
 passage reads :
 Armed struggle is the fundamental tool of oppressed people
 to win their liberation. We fully support, both politically and
 materially, the waging of national liberation war against im-
 perialism. Around the world and in the United States, van-
 guard forces will emerge and have done so through the
 building of armed clandestine movements and the waging of
 people's war. A central aspect of our support is the active
 defense of all political prisoners and prisoners of war cap-
 tured by the imperialist state 39

 On October 20, 1981, Judith Alice Clark, a former member of the
 WUO, was arrested while fleeing the scene of the Brinks robbery in
 Clarkstown. Miss Clark, currently on trial for her alleged role in that
 robbery, was a member of the May 19th Communist Organization.
 On October 27, 1981, Eve S. Rosahn was arrested and charged with
 criminal facilitation because a vehicle registered in her name was iden-
 tified as having been used in the escape attempt from the scene of
 the Brinks robbery. These charges were later dropped, although Miss
 Rosahn at the time of her release from detention expressed 'strong-
 est greetings of solidarity to the captured combatants" of the Brinks
 robbery who were still in detention and awaiting trial. Miss Rosahn
 was also a member of the May 19th Communist Organization. On
 November 9, 1982, Sylvia Baraldini was arrested in New York and
 charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery in company with
 suspects in the Brinks robbery. Miss Baraldini was identified as the
 "national treasurer" of the May 19th Communist Organization.40
 In his letter of June 8, 1982, Director Webster stated :
 Police intelligence sources advised the FBI that members
 of the PFOC and the May 19th Organization were inter-
 changeable as late as December 1978 and, therefore, the New
 York FBI Office recommended that the May 19th not be
 opened as a separate Domestic Security investigation at that
 time as the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee was already
 being investigated. * * * The Prairie Fire Organizing Com-
 mittee investigation was closed by the office of origin, San
 Francisco, and the Department of Justice was so advised by
 memorandum dated June 5, 1979. This case, like the one
 WUO, was closed because of a lack of information indicating
 group was involved in criminal activity therefore its con-
 tinuation could not be justified.41
 As Director Webster admitted during questioning by Senator East in
 the FBI Oversight hearing on February 4, 1982, the May 19th Com-
 munist Organization was not the subject of a domestic security inves-
 tigation at the time of the Brinks robbery of October 20, 1981, or at
 any time previously, although a limited level domestic security inves-
 tigation of the organization was opened on October 29, 1981 (that is,
 9 days after the Brinks robbery).
 The significance of these facts is that an openly extremist organiza-
 tion, with ties to and overlapping membership with known terrorist
 groups, could not be investigated under the Levi guidelines because
 of the criminal standard of the guidelines. The FBI was aware of
 the existence and nature of the May 19th Communist Organization
 but did not seek an investigation of it because of its near identity with
 the PFOC. The investigation of the PFOC was closed because of the

 tember 14, 1983, Clark and two *other defendants were convicted of three charges of second-
 degree murder and four charges of first-degree armed robbery arising from the Brinks case.
 On October 6, 1983, Clark and the two other convicts received sentences of 75 years to life

 criminal standard in June 1979, at which time the May 19th Com-
 munist Organization had already become an independent organization
 and had published or was about to publish its manifesto advocating
 the support and perpetration of political violence. If the May 19th
 Communist Organization was judged to be nearly identical in com-
 position to the 1'FOC, and if a domestic security investigation of the
 PFOC could not continue because of the absence of indicated involve-
 ment in criminal activities, then the May 19th Communist Organiza-
 tion could not have been investigated for the same reason. The crimi-
 nal standard of the Levi guidelines therefore was responsible for the
 absence of an investigation of the May 19th Communist Organization
 (some members of which were later allegedly involved in armed rob-
 bery or murder or in the support of these crimes) prior to the actual
 occurrence of the Brinks robbery.
 Given the fact, as reported by former Special Agent Marquez, that
 FBI informants in the WUO in 1977 (emplaced prior to the Levi
 guidelines) were responsible for the prevention of the bombing of
 Senator Briggs's office, it can be concluded that similar investiga-
 tion of the May 19th Communist Organization prior to the Brinks
 robbery could have prevented that crime and the deaths of three
 innocent persons during its course and aftermath. Awareness of the
 ideological advocacy of and support for political violence in the pro-
 paganda of the group, indications of its contacts with former or cur-
 rent convicts with violent backgrounds, knowledge of its membership
 or leadership (all of which could be learned largely through overt and
 public sources) or awareness of possible weapons training and accu-
 mulation, obtaining of safehouses, and planning of violent activities
 (which may be learned through clandestine surveillance) could have
 alerted investigators to the true nature of the May 19th Communist
 Organization and to the imminence of criminal and violent activities.
 In the absence of such investigative techniques, it is virtually im-
 possible for law enforcement authorities to learn of such activities
 or to prevent them.
 It may also be noted that even under the limited investigation that
 was initiated, new informants could not be emplaced or recruited, the
 surveillance of mail could not be used, and the electronic surveillance
 of telephone communications was prohibited. As of June 8, 1982 (8
 months after the Brinks robbery), only a limited investigation had
 been authorized by the FBI. As of August 20, 1982, however, the
 FBI had initiated a full investigation of the May 19th Communist
 Organizaton.
 CRITICISMS BY DIRECTOR WEBSTER
 Director Webster also discussed the provisions of the Levi guide-
 lines in his testimony on June 24. Although he expressed some criti-
 cisms of specific provisions of the guidelines, he appeared to disagree
 with the critical assessments of other Federal and local law enforce-
 ment oficers :
 It is difficult to measure the effect of these guidelines on our
 operations, but we believe they have served us reasonably
 well. They provided a statement of policy for the Bureau at
 Approved For Release 2008/10/22 : CIA-RDP90BOl370R000500780020-0
 Approved For Release 2008/10/22 : CIA-RDP90BOl370R000500780020-0
 a time when our authority in these matters was the subject of
 critical debate in Congress and elsewhere. And there have
 been no successful suits against an FBI agent for activities
 arising out of domestic security investigations that occurred
 after the guidelines were adopted.42
 Director Webster did express a desire that the Levi guidelines be re-
 vised, at least in some particulars. The specific revisions that he recom-
 mended included the removal of the prohibition of the establishment
 of informants in limited and preliminary investigations and the exten-
 sion of the time limits for domestic security investigations. With regard
 to the criminal standard, Director Webster was less critical :
 I believe that our domestic security investigations today are
 best understood if they are viewed as another form of crim-
 inal intelligence. They entail not only determining who com-
 mitted specific criminal acts, but also how those individuals
 relate to others similarly motivated, how they are financed
 and supported logistically, and who their leadership is. In
 this respect, the terrorist groups functioning today are no dif-
 ferent from other criminal enterprises, except that their mo-
 tivation may be political rather than financial. They should
 be pursued as organized criminal enterprises and the FBI
 should undertake to gather both criminal intelligence and evi-
 dence for prosecution. This would allow us to cross organiza-
 tional lines in our investigation without regard to what par-
 ticular group or element of the group might call itself.43
 The statement of Director Webster appears to reflect a desire on
 his part to retain the character of domestic security investigations as
 essentially criminal investigations-as established by the criminal
 standard of the Levi guidelines-rather than as intelligence investiga-
 tions. As several of the witnesses from the other law enforcement agen-
 cies, both Federal and State, pointed out, however, it is difficult for do-
 mestic security investigations, as criminal investigations, to anticipate
 criminal or imminent criminal conduct, since such conduct must be
 known or reasonably suspected prior. to the initiation of the investi-
 gations. Furthermore, Director Webster appeared to be evaluating
 domestic security investigations principally in terms of their value for
 the prosecution of criminal elements, not in terms of their value for
 the prediction or anticipation of criminal conduct or of their intel-
 ligence value.
 CRimcis is BY FORMER AGENTS
 Former agents of the FBI who testified before the subcommittee
 expressed considerably more critical attitudes toward the Levi guide-
 lines and the criminal standard contained in them than did Director
 .Webster. On June 25, the subcommittee received the testimony of
 three well-known and widely respected former agents who had been
 professionally involved throughout their careers with domestic intel-
 ligence and security matters. These were W. Mark Felt, former Acting
 Associate Director of the FBI; Edward S. Miller, former Assistant
 Director of the FBI for Intelligence; and Joseph A. Sizoo, a former

 Deputy Assistant Director to four different Assistant Directors of the
 FBI Intelligence Division and a career Special Agent of the FBI for
 37 years. Mr. Felt and Mr. Miller attracted nationwide attention in
 1978 and subsequent years due to their indictment and later convic-
 tion on November 6, 1980, for conspiring to violate the constitutional
 rights of eight American citizens, described as "relatives and acquain-
 tances" of fugitive members of the terrorist Weather Underground
 Organization by unlawfully authorizing warrantless surreptitious en-
 tries into the residences of the eight persons in 1972 and 1973. The pur-
 pose of the surreptitious entries was to obtain information that might
 lead to the location and apprehension of the terrorists, who had
 claimed responsibility for a series of bombings that resulted in the
 death of a policeman. On December 15, 1980, Mr. Felt and Mr. Miller
 were sentenced to pay fines of $5,000 and $3,500, respectively. The con-
 troversial verdict and sentence were reversed by President Reagan on
 April 15, 1981, when he issued a full executive pardon for both Mr.
 Felt and Mr. Miller.43a
 Mr. Felt, in his opening statement, referred to "the cumbersome
 restrictions of the Attorney General's guidelines, which attempt to
 regulate security investigations with standards which apply to the
 criminal area." He continued :
 This is like comparing watermelons and cucumbers. It is be-
 cause of these restrictions that the FBI cannot now investi-
 gate violence-prone groups such as the National Socialist
 Party of America, with which John W. Hinckley, Jr., was
 associated for a time-the Progressive Labor Party, an
 avowed Communist group which directs its younger members
 to enlist in the U.S. Army to learn military tactics for use
 when the time comes for the overthrow of our Government
 by force and violence-the Ku Klux Klan, a violence-oriented
 group on the far right-the Weather Underground Organiza-
 tion, also an avowed Communist group which was responsible
 for scores of bombings and many deaths, including the recent
 murders of three fine men and the serious wounding of two
 others during the attempted Brink's robbery in Nyack, N.Y.,
 October 20,1981-to mention but a few of such groups.44
 Like Director Webster (and several other witnesses), Mr. Felt em-
 phasized that he favored "guidelines for FBI investigative jurisdic-
 tion in the domestic security area" and that while in the FBI he had
 assisted in the preparation of a draft charter, to be enacted into law
 by Congress, under which adequate guidelines for domestic security
 investigations could be formulated. The charter and proposed Execu-
 tive order were not enacted or issued, however, and Mr. Felt stated
 that the Levi guidelines issued in 1976
 had little resemblance to the original proposals submitted by
 the FBI and were drawn up by persons who obviously had
 no knowledge of the problems involved. As a result, the guide-
 lines are far too restrictive 46

 In discussing the criminal standard specifically, Mr. Felt explained :
 In a criminal investigation, your basic purpose or your target
 is prosecution. You have to be sure that during the investiga-
 tion, any evidence which is collected, anything which might
 possibly be used to lead toward evidence is obtained through
 standards which are-which will stand up in a criminal
 court; whereas, in the intelligence field, both domestic and
 foreign, your target is not necessarily-in fact, it is probably
 not criminal prosecution, so the same standards do not
 apply.46
 Mr. Miller concurred with that statement and added :
 Intelligence investigations are not necessarily directed for
 the purpose of prosecution. If, indeed, prosecutive material is
 developed during an intelligence investigation, then you pros-
 ecute or you consider prosecution.47
 Mr. Sizoo, who, at the time of his testimony, was president of the
 Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, was also critical of the
 criminal standard. After an extensive review of recent cases involving
 domestic terrorism and their investigation by the FBI and other au-
 thorities, Mr. Sizoo concluded :
 Thus, I am led to the conviction that the present guidelines
 are too restrictive and some adjustments should be made. The
 application of a criminal standard to all domestic security
 situations, and that is almost what it amounts to, does not
 provide sufficient latitude. I do not think the FBI should be
 asked to operate without guidelines, however, as it was re-
 quired to do some years ago. Reasonable legislative guidelines
 or a charter should be established by the Congress, guidelines
 which should not be subject to change by every new adminis-
 tration, guidelines which will provide desirable guidance to
 the investigative agency, and protect the welfare of the Na-
 tion and the rights of all its citizens.48
 INVESTIGATION OF ADVOCACY
 One aspect of the Levi guidelines and their impact on domestic secu-
 rity investigations that was of particular interest to the subcommittee
 involved the degree to which the advocacy of violence or of criminal
 or revolutionary activity may be investigated under the criminal stand-
 ard of the guidelines. It is generally well known, and was emphasized
 by several witnesses before the subcommittee, that terrorist and ter-
 rorist support groups frequently publicize their advocacy, support,
 and practice of political violence in an effort to legitimize their activi-
 ties and distinguish them from common crime. An example of such
 rhetorical advocacy is afforded by the manifesto of the May 19th
 Communist Organization quoted above, and Detective McCree and
 the Investigative Services Division of the Metropolitan Police De-

 partment provided the subcommittee with many other examples, some
 of which are printed as exhibits.
 Virtually all of the witnesses who had experience in counterterrorist
 and domestic security intelligence work emphasized that the availabil-
 ity of such materials to investigators is of considerable value. By col-
 lecting, evaluating, analyzing, and collating such documents, investi-
 gators can learn or can estimate the nature of the group, its intercon-
 nections with other groups, its ideological orientations, its member-
 ship or adherents, its objectives, tactics, and internal structure, and its
 possible connections to foreign powers. Intelligence of this kind can be
 of immense value in anticipating the targets of terrorist attacks, the
 occurrence of their attacks, and their capability for certain kinds of
 violence, as well as in establishing lines of investigation by which the
 perpetrators of violence can be identified and apprehended.
 Critics of the Levi guidelines have frequently argued that the crim-
 inal standard of the guidelines does not permit the FBI to investigate
 groups or individuals on the basis of their advocacy of violence or crim-
 inal or revolutionary activity alone. Since the criminal standard does
 not permit the initiation of a preliminary investigation except "on
 the basis of allegations or other information that an individual or a
 group may be engaged in activities which involve or will involve the
 use of force or violence and which involve or will involve the violation
 of federal law," and since advocacy of criminal, violent, or revolu-
 tionary activity is not generally illegal, it would appear that advocacy
 alone is excluded as a basis for initiating a domestic security investiga-
 tion by the Levi guidelines.
 This conclusion was reinforced by a statement by Mr. Paul Nugent
 of the Terrorism Section of the FBI, testifying on June 21, 1979, before
 the Subcommittee on Oversight of the Permanent Select Committee
 on Intelligence of the House of Representatives. Congressman C. W.
 Bill Young of Florida, a member of the subcommittee, asked Mr. Nu-
 gent if the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), a Maoist Communist
 group that advocates the violent overthrow of the U.S. Government
 and the infiltration and subversion of the U.S. Armed Forces, was
 under investigation by the FBI. Mr. Nugent replied :
 Absolutely not. * * * due to the nature of the investigations
 which are conducted under the Domestic Security criteria
 today, if you have seen the guidelines, it is very specific in
 that advocacy or rhetoric is not the criteria on which we can
 base a domestic security investigation. There has to be that
 one step further, involvement in force and violence and viola-
 tion of Federal law, or at least a conspiracy to violate some
 Federal law with force and violence on which we can base
 basically a criminal type approach to an investigation, not a
 searching for programs which groups may advocate in the
 press or in speechmaking and so forth."
 On the basis of Mr. Nugent's (and the FBI's) interpretation, it
 would not be possible to open an investigation on the ground that the
 49 Pre-Employment Security Procedures of the Intelligence Agencies, hearings before the
 Subcommittee on Oversight of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House of
 Representatives, 96th Cong., 1st less., May 16, 17, 24, and June 21, 1979, pp. 207-?

 subject had advocated the use of force or violence or other violent or
 illegal activities, and the collection and analysis of the publications of
 extremist groups-newspapers, manifestoes, periodicals, pamphlets,
 and leaflets, et cetera-would not be permitted. Thus, the FBI, under
 this interpretation of the guidelines, would not be allowed to read,
 analyze, or retain the publication of the PLP, Progressive Labor, in
 which the infiltration and subversion of the Armed Forces is advocated,
 nor would the FBI be able to collect, read, or retain the "Principles of
 Unity of the May 19th Communist Organization" or other publicly
 available documents such as are printed as exhibits in the hearings.
 Director Webster in his statement before the subcommittee on
 June 24 questioned whether the guidelines do in fact forbid the Bu-
 reau to read and retain publicly available documents. He stated that
 "There is no prohibition against the practice in the guidelines."
 The problem stems largely from the Privacy Act which pro-
 hibits agencies from maintaining records on how one exer-
 cises first amendment rights unless it is in connection with
 an authorized law enforcement activity. Thus, we cannot
 collect that information unless the group is under active
 investigation.50
 Mary Lawton, Counsel for Intelligence Policy in the Department of
 Justice and one of the authors of the Levi guidelines, concurred with
 Director Webster in this assessment of the Privacy Act :
 However, the one thing that none of the guidelines can do is
 change the statutory limitations. The Privacy Act not only
 prohibits collection of information about how an individual
 exercises his first amendment rights outside of law enforce-
 ment investigations; it prohibits an agency from collecting
 any information not authorized by statute or executive order
 as part of its mission, when that information concerns indi-
 viduals. Those constraints do not change when we change the
 guidelines.51
 Director Webster also testified that Mr. Nugent's interpretation of the
 restrictions of the guidelines was no longer current within the FBI,
 and he suggested that, while a rhetoric that occasionally or loosely ad-
 vocated violence was not sufficient to initiate an investigation, advo-
 cacy of violence is substantially different :
 An advocacy of kinds of conduct that carry to fruition, do in
 fact violate the guidelines-form the basis today for a look at
 the operation. It does not mean that we are going to turn to
 wiretaps, mail covers, penetrations and so on, but it does
 require a good look.52
 In a written response of August 30, 1982, to questions submitted by
 the chairman on June 14, 1982, the FBI in response to the question,
 "Can the FBI read, clip or research publicly available documents of a
 group or individual prior to the initiation of a preliminary investiga-
 tion ?" stated :

 27
 The FBI may read, clip and research publicly available docu-
 ments concerning a group or individual prior to a prelimi-
 nary inquiry. However, the Privacy Act prohibits the Bureau
 from indexing such information in a manner that permits re-
 trieval by name of the individual unless it is in connection
 with an authorized law enforcement activity.53
 In response to a question concerning the amount of analytical re-
 sources devoted to such a research by the FBI, the Bureau stated :
 We do not devote research and analytical resources to clipping
 and reading activities. During our ongoing domestic security
 investigations, those FBI personnel responsible for these in-
 vestigations clip and read pertinent information which comes
 to their attention 54
 Yet, in response to the question, "How many domestic security in-
 vestigations under the guidelines have been opened in the last 5 years
 on the basis of advocacy alone?" the Bureau stated :
 The review showed ten cases which were opened based on the
 advocacy of violence alone. These cases were incorrectly
 opened usually in the early stages of the implementation of
 the Guidelines or by field offices not familiar with domestic se-
 curity. They were ordered closed by FBI Headquarters.55
 In other words, even though advocacy of violence may be grounds
 in principle for opening a domestic security investigation, in prac-
 tice there are no such investigations. Those investigations that were
 initiated on grounds of advocacy alone were closed by FBIHQ, and
 the Bureau does not devote any of its organizational resources to the
 reading and clipping of publicly available documents of groups that
 advocate violence or criminal conduct.
 ExcEPTioxs To THE PRIVACY ACT
 Despite the interpretation of the Privacy Act by Director Webster
 and Miss Lawton, there remain grounds for believing that this statute
 does not in fact forbid the investigation of advocacy of violence or
 of criminal activities. The Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), enacted by
 Congress on December 31, 1974, states in section (e)7:
 Each [federal] agency that maintains a system of records
 shall * * * maintain no record describing how any individ-
 ual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment un-
 less expressly authorized by statute or by the individual
 about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to
 and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement
 activity. * * *
 Senator East suggested that the language of the Privacy Act per-
 tains specifically to individuals and not to organizations (for example,
 the Progressive Labor Party and the May 19th Communist Organiza-
 53 Ibid., p. 69.

 28
 tion), so that the statute presents no bar to reading and collecting the
 organizational literature of extremist groups.
 Furthermore, although the Privacy Act forbids the maintaining of
 records on the exercise of first amendment rights by individuals except
 as part of an authorized law enforcement activity, it does not establish
 any standard for the threshold at which such an activity may be
 initiated. The term "law enforcement activity" is not defined in the
 Privacy Act, and it may be presumed that, if an authorized domestic
 security investigation is an authorized law enforcement activity under
 the terms of the Act, then the lowering of the threshold at which a
 domestic security investigation may be initiated would not be restricted
 by the Privacy Act.
 The Privacy Act allows for the collection of information resulting
 from an individual's exercise of first amendment rights when "ex-
 pressly authorized by statute." Executive orders have the force of
 statute law, and Miss Lawton in her testimony before the subcommit-
 tee expressly mentioned Executive orders as well as statutes as con-
 stituting exceptions to the restrictions of the Privacy Act. Executive
 Order 12333, "United States Intelligence Activities," issued by Presi-
 dent Reagan on December 4, 1981, provides a recent and specific au-
 thorization for the collection of information on individuals. Part 2.3 of
 E.O. 12333 reads:
 Agencies within the Intelligence Community are authorized
 to collect, retain or disseminate information concerning
 United States persons only in accordance with procedures
 established by the head of the agency concerned and approved
 by the Attorney General, consistent with the authorities pro-
 vided by Part 1 of this Order. Those procedures shall permit
 collection, retention and dissemination of the following types
 of information :
 (a) Information that is publicly available or collected with
 the consent of the person concerned. * * *
 The term "Intelligence Community" and "Agencies within the In-
 telligence Community" as defined within E.O. 12333 include "The in-
 telligence elements of the * * * Federal Bureau of Investigation
 (FBI). * * * (Part 3.4.f.6.) It may be noted also that Executive Or-
 der 10450 (as well as other Executive orders) governing the Federal
 Employees Security Program authorize the FBI to collect information
 concerning the loyalty and security of individuals. Such information
 would include records of the advocacy of violence or of criminal or
 revolutionary conduct.
 In addition to these legal exceptions to the Privacy Act, it is relevant
 to note that both the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police adhere
 to different interpretations of the act. Director Simpson of the Secret
 Service testified on August 11:
 We also recognize, of course, that the restrictions imposed by
 the Privacy Act play a role in determining the nature of
 domestic intelligence collection efforts. While this is true, it
 is also true that the present guidelines, as written and inter-
 preted, impose restrictions beyond those contemplated by the
 Privacy Act. It is our view that so long as there is a demon-

 29
 strable need for the collection of such information, no such
 artificial barriers should exist. The Privacy Act does not re-
 quire the existence of a criminal case to justify the creation
 of a record by a law enforcement agency. Neither, in our view,
 should the guidelines. Further, of course, the Privacy Act
 applies to individuals, not groups. Good cause does not exist
 to expand these limitations.5?
 Chief Herring of the Park Police stated in response to questioning by
 the chief counsel of the subcommittee, Mr. Joel S. Lisker, that the Park
 Police do in fact, as a routine matter, collect publicly available docu-
 ments of groups and demonstrators that are not under investigation
 for criminal activities :
 Mr. LISKER. * * * DQ you read the literature that is dis-
 tributed by these groups?
 Mr. HERRING. Yes, we do. In fact, one of our practices has
 been for years, and one of the things that our intelligence of-
 ficer does, is to collect any handbills and literature that is
 passed out at any of these demonstrations. We want to know
 our adversary and who might have the propensity for any
 type of violence. So, therefore, we do read all the literature,
 the handbills, the philosophy, anything that they might put
 out as to their mode of operations, such as their SOP as far
 as how to conduct a demonstration and the entire organiza-
 tional structure.
 Mr. LIsKER. Would it surprise you to know that the FBI
 does not read this information, does not collect it and, fur-
 ther, I think, has said that there is not, in their view at least,
 not much value in looking at this kind of information?
 Mr. HERRING. I would be surprised, yes. I would not be
 able to comment on that specific issue.57
 The conclusion must be, therefore, that there are grounds for ques-
 tioning the interpretation of the Privacy Act expressed by Director
 Webster and Miss Lawton. Other Federal agencies, no less bound by
 the Privacy Act than the FBI and the DOJ, do not adhere to their
 interpretation and do in fact collect the literature of groups not under
 investigation as part of a law enforcement activity. Indeed, the lan-
 guage of the Privacy Act allows for that activity by Federal law en-
 forcement and intelligence agencies, and Executive orders, with the
 force of statute law, allow for the collection by such agencies of in-
 formation concerning the advocacy of violence and of criminal
 conduct.
 CONCLUSION
 Virtually all the witnesses emphasized that domestic security guide-
 lines are necessary and desirable. Guidelines serve to establish regular
 procedures by which the FBI (and State and local agencies) can al-
 locate the proper amounts and kinds of resources to domestic security
 investigations. They provide standards by which the value of in-
 vestigating potential subjects can be estimated. Furthermore, guide-

 lines provide a form of authorization from DOJ under which the FBI
 is permitted to pursue certain kinds of investigation and to make use
 of certain kinds of investigative techniques. Without guidelines, FBI
 field offices and agents would be reluctant to make use of the full
 range of their authority and resources to conduct domestic security
 investigations. After the exposures, investigations, prosecutions, liti-
 gation, reforms, and security leaks of the post-Vietnam and post-
 Watergate periods, and particularly after the indictment, trial, and
 conviction of Edward S. Miller and W. Mark Felt, many FBI agents
 might reasonably exhibit reluctance to pursue domestic security in-
 vestigations, even when there is a clear need for them. Director Web-
 ster expressed this feeling well in the FBI Oversight hearing held
 by the subcommittee on February 4, 1982:
 My problem today is not unleashing the FBI, my problem is
 convincing those in the FBI that they can work up to the
 level of our authority. Too many people have been sued, too
 many people have been harassed and their families and life
 savings tied up in litigation and the threat of prosecution. So
 that we and others like us run the risk that we will not do our
 full duty in order to protect our individual selves.
 So, we need clear-cut parameters of what we can do. Now, if
 those parameters cut off too soon or make it difficult to do our
 job, then we ought to change those guidelines. But we do need
 the guidelines. 58
 Virtually all the witnesses also emphasized the need for serious and
 extensive reforms of the Levi guidelines as currently written. Director
 Webster, as well as other witnesses from the Federal and local law
 enforcement communities, emphasized the need to extend the time
 limits allowed for investigations and to remove or reduce the restric-
 tions on the recruitment and emplacement of informants in the lower
 levels of investigation. Yet by far the most frequently voiced criticism
 of the Levi guidelines was that the criminal standard is an inappro-
 priate intrusion of a law enforcement concept in what is properly
 and primarily an intelligence activity.
 DOMESTIC SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS : LAW ENFORCEMENT VERSUS
 INTELLIGENCE
 The conception of domestic security investigations as primarily in-
 telligence activities rather than law enforcement activities is by no
 means new. It is safe to say that this conception has pertained through-
 out most of the history of domestic security investigations in the
 United States and that it remains the predominant conception in most
 democratic countries today. Indeed, the assimilation of domestic se-
 curity investigations to law enforcement functions alone is itself a
 novelty.
 It is important to understand the implications of the concept of
 domestic security investigations as intelligence, since this concept leads
 to an evaluation of their purpose and results that differs from their
 evaluation as law enforcement activities alone. In the report of the

 General Accounting Office on "FBI Domestic Intelligence Opera-
 tions-Their Purpose and Scope : Issues To Be Resolved" of Febru-
 ary 24, 1976, for example, the domestic intelligence program of the
 FBI was evaluated in part in terms of the number of prosecutions,
 convictions, and referrals for prosecution that resulted. By this stand-
 ard, it was found that only a small percentage of domestic security
 investigations had resulted in prosecutorial action, and the Report
 concluded that
 Other than effectively identifying and gathering information
 on groups and individuals affiliated with groups that espouse
 and carry out subversive and extremist activities, the FBI's
 domestic intelligence operations do not appear to have had
 much impact.59
 The assumption of the study was that the primary purpose of domes-
 tic intelligence was to "prosecute and convict subjects for violating
 appropriate statutes." 60
 Yet, given the principal sources of authorization for domestic secu-
 rity investigations cited by the GAO and by the FBI itself (28 U.S.C.
 533, Executive Order 10450, Presidential directives, and other statutes
 and Executive orders), there is insufficient basis for ascribing to do-
 mestic security investigations the sole or principal purpose of law
 enforcement. Rather, these sources of authority and the history of
 domestic security investigations in the United States make clear that
 law enforcement has been at most only one purpose of domestic in-
 telligence and that the intelligence function was, until comparatively
 recently, its principal purpose.
 Moreover, the concept of domestic security investigations as in-
 telligence activities was emphasized by the late J. Edgar Hoover, who,
 as Director of the FBI, was primarily responsible for the evolution
 of FBI domestic intelligence. Shortly before his death in May 1972,
 Director Hoover, in a memorandum of February 25, 1972, to Acting
 Attorney General Richard Kleindienst, specifically articulated the
 intelligence role of domestic security investigations. As the Final Re-
 port of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Opera-
 tions with Respect to Intelligence Activities (the Church committee)
 noted in regard to Director Hoover's memorandum :
 The Bureau investigated "any individual" who "is affiliated
 with or adheres to the principles of" an organization "which
 has as an objective" the violent overthrow of the government
 or "other criminal activity detrimental to the National de-
 fense." The Bureau also made clear that the purpose of these
 investigations was not just to "obtain evidence for prosecu-
 tion," but also
 "* * * to obtain intelligence data in order to have day-to-
 day appraisal of strength, dangerousness, and activities of
 the organization; and to keep the Department of Justice and
 other affected Government agencies advised."
 These investigations were partly based on criminal statutes,

 32
 although the Bureau admitted that "subversive activity * * *
 often does not clearly involve a specific section of a specific
 statute." 81
 Domestic intelligence, as all the witnesses testified and as courts
 have acknowledged, is a valuable and necessary part of law enforce-
 ment. Intelligence can significantly assist in the anticipation and pre-
 vention of violence or the violation of the law (the proactive func-
 tion) as well as in the investigation of past violations of the law and
 the apprehension of the violators (the retroactive function). Yet, in
 addition to the proactive and retroactive functions, domestic intelli-
 gence also provides a means by which concerted efforts to weaken or
 undermine a government or a society may be detected and evaluated.
 It is precisely efforts of this nature, which constitute the phenomenon
 of subversion, of which Director Hoover was thinking in his memo-
 randum to Attorney General Kleindienst.
 THE NATURE OF SUBVERSION
 The phenomenon of subversion has traditionally been associated
 with the attempts of hostile foreign powers or their agents to wage
 covert warfare on targeted countries or organizations. Prior to the is-
 suance of the Levi guidelines, domestic intelligence as conducted by the
 FBI included the investigation of purely indigenous subversion (for
 example, by "hate groups" and extremists of a variety of kinds) as
 well as of subversive groups and individuals having connections with
 foreign powers (for example, the German American Bund of the
 1930's and the Communist Party U.S.A.). Following the adoption of
 the Levi guidelines, foreign connected subversion has been investi-
 gated under the Foreign Counter-Intelligence (FCI) program of the
 FBI Intelligence Division. In recent years, foreign connected or spon-
 sored subversion has generally been called "covert action" or (in the
 case of the Soviet Union) "active measures."
 Implicit in the concept of subversion as Director Hoover discussed
 it and as it has traditionally been understood is the idea that certain
 kinds of activities, although legal and non-violent in themselves, may
 present a threat to the basic order and institutions of a free society.
 As Philip Selznick noted :
 Subversion refers not only to a revolutionary program, but
 also to the manipulation of social institutions for alien ends,
 this manipulation being conducted covertly in the name of
 the institution's own values. It is this type of subversion
 which is meant when fear is expressed of the effect of com-
 munism in the schools, in the labor movement, and in liberal
 organizations. Such activities, and ultimate overthrow of the
 government, are of course related, but concern for the integ-
 rity of the institutions themselves leads us to seek modes of
 self-defense long before any clear and present danger to
 established authority is demonstrable. 62

 33
 A key element of subversion therefore is the intention to make use
 of legitimate processes and institutions for illegitimate ends, to "work
 within the system to destroy the system"-for example, to exploit the
 first amendment to promote the destruction of freedom of expression,
 to use the electoral process to make free elections impossible or mean-
 ingless, or to use educational institutions to propagandize for revolu-
 tionary or totalitarian ideologies. In a free society, there can be very
 little legal prohibition of this kind of activity, but there must be public
 awareness of the nature of subversion and of the parties that entertain
 subversive goals and use subversive tactics. Domestic security investi-
 gations can play a vital role in maintaining this public awareness by
 informing public authorities and the public in general of the presence,
 strength, goals, and tactics of subversion in this sense-as Director
 Hoover put it, a "day-to-day appraisal of strength, dangerousness, and
 activities."
 Under the criminal standard of the Levi guidelines, it has been vir-
 tually impossible to investigate subversion that is restricted to legal
 and non-violent activities, even though the existence and importance
 of indigenous subversion should be obvious. The arts and techniques
 of psychological warfare, propaganda, disinformation, political agita-
 tion, and infiltration have been the subject of intense study and devel-
 opment by governments and private groups. The value of these tech-
 niques as cost-effective, minimal-risk means of covertly manipulating
 or weakening a targeted government or organization has been dis-
 cussed and acknowledged by almost all modern governments and by
 many reputable scholars, and these techniques have been used by non-
 governmental groups (for example, extremist political parties and
 cults) as well. One recent example in the United States is the declared
 intention of the Progressive Labor Party to infiltrate and subvert the
 U.S. Armed Forces, and myriad similar examples may be found in the
 extremist literature of both the far right and the far left. It was pri-
 marily concern over the possibility of such infiltration and subversion
 by both domestic and foreign-connected elements that led to the adop-
 tion of the Federal Employees Security Program in the 1940's and
 1950's.
 To authorize investigation of subversive activities by Federal agen-
 cies is not to prohibit or prosecute them but merely to affirm that duly
 constituted authorities have the right and the duty to know of and
 understand subversion in order to inform the public (for example,
 through the oversight and investigative responsibilities of Congress)
 and to design countermeasures to restrict and reduce the subversive in-
 fluence. Investigation of domestic subversion therefore does not have
 primarily a prosecutorial or law enforcement purpose, although, as
 an intelligence activity, it may lead to the exposure of foreign con-
 nections, an intention or capability for violence on a large-scale, crim-
 inal activities affecting national security, or connections to other cur-
 rent violent or criminal activities.
 Under a criminal standard, domestic security investigations of do-
 mestic subversion cannot be authorized, since the subjects of the inves-
 tigation are not presently or about to be involved in violent and crimi-
 nal activities. The application of the criminal standard to domestic
 security investigations therefore prevents the effective collection of
 intelligence on domestic subversion.

 Even when the acknowledged purpose of domestic security investi-
 gations is restricted to law enforcement, the intrusion of the criminal
 standard leads to a paradoxical situation and the diminution of the
 results of the investigations. A domestic security investigation cannot
 be initiated prior to obtaining information that indicates actual or im-
 minent criminal activities, but the investigating agency cannot become
 aware of such information unless it is brought to its attention by those
 parties privy to the plans and activities of the group or individual that
 is planning the crime. Investigation cannot begin until there is an
 indication of violence or the violation of the law, but violence or viola-
 tion of the law cannot be known until an investigation has begun or
 a crime has been committed. Since terrorist and criminal groups typi-
 cally conceal their plans and not infrequently severely sanction those
 members and adherents who reveal their plans, it is extremely dif-
 ficult, under a criminal standard, to provide effective proactive and
 preventive intelligence. This paradoxical situation suggests the im-
 portance of the ability to read and analyze the publicly available docu-
 ments and literature of extremist or terrorist support groups. to em-
 place or recruit informants, and to utilize other techniques of investi-
 gation that may develop information indicating illegal activities on
 the part of extremist elements.
 Domestic security investigations and domestic intelligence have pur-
 poses other than those of law enforcement, although their law enforce-
 ment function remains important. Domestic intelligence can provide
 proactive indications of imminent criminal or violent activities, and
 its retroactive function can lead to the apprehension of violators and
 the development of evidence for prosecution. In addition to these
 law enforcement functions, however, domestic intelligence conducted
 by Federal and local agencies can lead to an understanding of the
 nature of subversion, of the extent, purposes, interconnections, and tac-
 tics of subversive groups and activities; and by informing public au-
 thorities, it can contribute effectively to the protection of the founda-
 tions of a free society. To evaluate domestic security investigations
 purely in terms of their prosecutorial results leads to a false interpre-
 tation of their value and purpose, and the application of the criminal
 standard to domestic intelligence diminishes the value and the results
 of domestic security investigations considered either as intelligence or
 as law enforcement activities.
 Based on the findings of its hearings, the subcommittee suggests
 the following recommendations for guidelines to govern domestic
 security investigations by the FBI:
 (1) The Attorney General should retain guidelines for do-
 mestic security investigations.
 ) The current Levi guidelines should be extensively revised.
 8) The principal revisions to the Levi guidelines should in-
 clude :
 (a) The deletion of the criminal standard as the threshold
 for initiating domestic security investigations;
 (b) A specific authorization for the investigation of sys-
 tematic advocacy of violence, illegal activities, or other ac-

 tivities calculated to weaken or undermine the Government of
 the United States or of any State;
 (c) The extension of the time limits for investigations,
 especially those for preliminary and limited investigations;
 (d) Relaxation of current restrictions on the recruitment
 and emplacement of new informants; and
 (e) Lowering of the threshold for the initiation of limited
 investigations and relaxation of current restrictions on tech-
 niques permissible in investigations (for example, physical
 surveillance and interviews for purposes other than identi-
 fication of the subject of investigation should be permitted at
 the preliminary level of investigation).
 (4) The new guidelines should be tested and evaluated against
 the experience of Federal, State, and local law enforcement and
 intelligence agencies and of those agencies and institutions most
 vulnerable to and concerned with domestic security threats.
 (5) After a period of testing, the guidelines should be eval-
 uated by the FBI, other Federal, State, and local law enforce-
 ment and intelligence agencies, other agencies and institutions
 involved in or exposed to domestic security matters or threats, and
 the Congress of the United States.
 (6) After testing and evaluation in the manner described
 above, the Department of Justice should present legislative
 recommendations to Congress to justify the enactment into
 law of adequate and effective guidelines for domestic security
 investigations.
