SOAP oleos 1=_deza.teit_etefwgmetenve_taLeseretejageem. As part of its "B" 
pregrum to rehabilitate the Japanese economy, SGAP has issued a directive 
to the Japanese Government which will have the effect of empanding foreign 
private investments in Japan. Post-leer commercial entrants, who can show 
that investments will "contribute to Japanese economic rehabilitation", 
are placed on an equal footing both with "non-Japanese who have been cone, 
tinuously resident In Japan since 2 September 1945" and, except for pro-
13:77ty transactions, with Japanese nationals and firms. 
Removal of existing discriminatory legislation against foreign busi-
ness enterprises should lead to cautious investment in japan, restrained 
by factors such as: (2) shortages within Japan of materials, facilities, 
services; (2) Japanese fears ofl"foreign domination ()) instabilitT of 
Japan's "natural" markete in the Par East, (4) uncertainty as to the level 
of Japanese industry to be permitted by the Allied Powers and, (5) possi-
bility of renewed restrictions after execution of a peace treaty. Inter-
ested foreign firms include an English company 'which had a pre-war 67 
percent share in the Toy* Babcock (boilers), the US Reynolds Metal Com-
pany (aluminum), Caltex (petroleum) and several electric companies.

Appointment of Dean 
Acheson as the Secretary of State has been received with enthusiasm in 
Japanese press and government circles thus far, Comment compared Mr. 
Acheson's civilian background to General Marshall's military career, and 
noted that Acheson has gone on record as favorites restaeation of Japanese 
economy in contrast to the Marshall Plants primary interest in. Europe, 
Japanese interpretations of the changets significance ranged from expect-. 
ation of minor reorientations in the Marshall attitude to a policy of 
strengthening of Japan's position in the Far East. Regarding the latter 
outlook it should be recalled that the Japanese aware of hidden meanings 
in their men public pronouncements,frequently view Occidental personnel

nent is preparing proposals for revision of existing basic labor legisla-
tion relating to private industry. It is intended to introduce these in 
the new Diet which EISBIDA'a Democratic-Liberal Party hopes to control., 
The YOSHIDA Government intimates that the planned revisions are essential 
if the Japanese Government is to implement the new US economic directive 
(See RAE Weekly 02). Government initiative reflects the attitude of 
YOSHIDA's conservative backers who have criticized many of SCAPfts labor 
relations prineiples as being experimental and unrealistic. In the past 
the Democratic-Liberal Party has unsuccessfully urged modification of 
these lave in the face of insurmountable Socialist opposition in the Diet.

The Government's proposals come while the public still remembers how 
en() of dispute tactics in late TAB by coal and metal miners', electric 
power workers' and seamene unions threatened interruption of critical 
onerations and fhlfilment of production goels. At that time, SOAP re-
5ected the suggestion that the strike bane embodied in the revised National 
Public Service Law which covers Government workers be extended to private 
industry. SOAP, however, indicated that the Government, if compelled, 
my restrain labor activities in industries affeoting the public interest. 
Following issue of the US economic directive, SOAP officials advised trade 
unioas to ucooperate in fulfillment of the program, with the result that 
most disputes have been settled. 
Tn view of SCAP's statement that laborle furelaraental rights will be 
preserved, as well as the success of rersuasive tactics to date, it is 
not likely that Japanese conservative attempts to 'put labor in its placer' 
will be effective. SOAP has pointed out that management bears a respope 
sibility equal to labor's, in assisting economic recovery through increas-
ing efficiency of operation. Moreover, the economic stabilization program 
Implies that conservative forces must accept greater rather than less 
controls, SOAP has pointed out, however, that the new program calls far 
temporary surrender of some privileges and immunities and that Japanese 
labor will be expected to bear its fair share of eacrifices. Whether 
Japanese trade unions will do so willingly, in emulation of British labor, 
remains to be seen. The YOSHIDA Government's conservative tactics pro-
bably will tend to push labor towards the extremist comp*

Reports indicate a growing 
Japanese indifference toward the democratic electoral process which they 
face on 23 January, for the third time since the Occupation. Winter 
weather in northern Japan, 'which has limited campaign audiences, is blamed 
for part of the apathy. Of greater importance is the stringent restric-
tion an campaign finds, imposed by the new election laws, which has 
severely limited campaign publicity. Under the present regulations, 
newspapers are prohibited from supporting candidates, thus further reduc-
ing public interest. Another factor is that the Japanese public tends to 
vote for a well-known candidate rather than a political party, and many 
of the best-known names were discredited in recent political scandals, 
causing their supporters to lose interest. 
Fewer candidates registered for this election, which may indicate 
continuation of a trend first shown by the mealier poll turnout in the 
1947 general elections, compared to 1946. Japanese yawn, who voted for 
the first time during the Occupation, appear unenthusiastic over their 
new role in the democratic era, judging by the fact that there are 45%

The weather, lack of newspaper baoking end the scandals which have

tors, proportionately more effeotive.

of indications point to an attempt to increase the North Korean military 
forces both in strength and nwabers. It is learned that recruiting quotas 
for men and women in the 18-25 age group are to be set up and filled by 
local People's Army county headquarters. Centers for the training of 
now recruits are being established. Confirmation of the existence of an 
armored regiment has been received. 
It is significant that security measures are reported in regard to the 
accelerated recruiting program. Inductees are being carefUlly screened 
and only those in complete sympathy with the government of the North 
Kaman poppet state are admitted to the ranks of the People's Army. It 
is highly possible that earlier recruits showed some evidence of dissatis-
faction and the screening system is designed to keep dissidents out of the 
expanding Army. 
The People's Army is currently estimated at 50,000 men. Agy substan-
tial expansion will fUrther drain the labor pool already seriously depleted 
by labor conscription, imprisonments, the flight of refugees and the 
existing military force.

threats to the security of the Republic have otimulated Army recruiting 
and have tensed an acceleration of training with now arms and equipment. 
The former Constabalara, now officially the Korean Annie is aiming at a 
strength of 65,000 men. (See BIM Weekly #30) The addition of over 
15,000 recruits since 24 November 1948, drawn principally from rightist 
youth groups, has brought the Army's present numbers to approximately 
62,500 men. 
The Army is being supplied with infantry and infantry support weapons

CHINA 
Nationalists  lose North China, fall of Nanking and Shanghai  
inminent. The Chinese Communist forces of Gen. LIN Piao quietly 
took possession of the important North China city of Tientsin following 
the capitulation of its defenders on 15 January. In consequence, 
twelve additional Chinese Communist columne have been released which 
may well be utilized to augment Peiping's present beseigers8, thereby 
ensuring the rapid success of an all-out attack against the city. 
However. the Communists, not wishing to pay the price of such a blitz 
operation or to jeopardise their popular front appeal a probably will 
not attack the historic city, but tighten their stranglehold instead 
and force ?Id Tso-yi to make a "deal," flee, or surrender. Therefore, 
Peiping/a capitulation can be expected within the next two to three 
weeks. 
After Peiping falls, the Communists will have at least eighteen 
additional columns for further employment elsewhere. The next likely 
course of Communist action north of the Yangtze appears to be an 
operation against ill-defended Tsingtaoa The capture of Tsingtao would 
virtually ensure the early fall of Taiyuan in Shansi, since Taiyuan's 
major supply route is via air from Teingtao. Atter Taiyuan fall%the 
small forces of HU Teungenan at Sian could be dealt with successfully 
by Communists moving smith from YEN Hei-shan's former domain. 
In Central China the Nationalist's battle has been lost. The 
Government is withdrawing its second-rate, hopeleasly outnumbered 
forces to a defense line along the Tangtzeiliver generally extending 
from Hankow to Shanghai. Meanwhile, the Communist forces of Gens. 
CHEN Yl and LIU Po-oheng are regrouping and preparing to cross the Yangtze. 
This operation will probably be in the form of a three-pronged envelop-
ment with one force moving southeast along the Tientsin-Pukou Railroad 
toward Pukou and Nanking. Another force would move dawn the Grand 
Canal and arose the river between Nanking and Shanghai, thence turning 
west toward Nanking. The third force would move south from the Pangfou 
sector and cross the river in the vicinity of Wiihu, thence turning 
east toward Nanking. 
In the Hankow sector, PAT Chung-hsi mill continue to be success-
fully contained by Communist forces to the north of his position. When 
Nanking falls Shanghai and Hankow cannot be far behind as PAT will 
be forced to make adeal or withdraw southward when attacked by a 
major force. It new appears likely that the Communists will occupy 
Nanking, Shanghai and all territory north of the Yangtze and east of the 
Yellow river, with the possible exception of Taiyuan and Sian, by March. 
Nationalist losses through combat casualty, capture, or defection 
during the past six months have been slightly over one million men, 
their remaining combat strength is now estimated at approximately 
400,000. On the other hands the Communist armies totalling over 1,500,000

moniof increasing efficiency and drunk with victory, are capable of 
driving virtually unopposedi through south China to Canton by spring 
thereby forcing CRIANG's remnant Government to withdraw to Taiwan. 
National Governmet.it preparations to  move from Nanklu in the near 
future have become increasingly apparent? Canton is the probable 
ultimate destination for most units. The Communists delay in pressing 
on towards the capital' has given the Nationalists the opportunity to 
effect a more or less orderly withdrawal of the Government, in contradiction 
to earlier estimates that the flight would be completely disorganized 
and confused. Plans for the removal of the archives of various ministries 
have been made and personnel, excepting key men, are reportedly being 
given the opportunity to resign or to be evacuated from Nanking. 
Preparations are also being made for adequate housing cer the Diplomatic 
Corps in Canton. This more or less orderly withdrawal of the National 
Government will make it more difficult for any accredited foreign 
missions to refuse to accompany the Government to a provisional capital. 
At the same time; the removal of the archives and the dispersion of 
trained personnel will keep the Communists from taking over an intact 
administrative organization in Nanking and substantially increase their 
administrative difficulties. 
The lack of an, organized peace front becomes apparent as more and "C" 
more elements in Nationalist China try to bargain with the Communists 
for their personal security. Peace overtures on a group and individual basis 
rather than on a governmental level, have increased since the Communists 
refused CHIANG Kai-shek's bid for peace at his own price. FU Tsoeyi 
in North China has been engaged in peace talks with thy Communists on 
a regional basis i LI Tsung-jen, who had formerly sent emissaries to 
the Communists in Hong Kong; is now reported tc have sent two representatives 
to meet with the Communists at Shihchiachuang PAI Chung-hei, who 
continues to urge the Generalissimo to seek peace, is reported to be 
prepared to negotiate a truce with the Communists in cooperation with 
other regional leaders in the Southwest. At the same time, local groups 
such as the Shanghai City Council are also-attempting to take the irltiative 
for peace. All those efforts, however, are apparently being checked by 
a small group around. CHIANG, including HU Shih. This clique continues 
to urge CHIANG to hold out through the coming year, counting on the 
outbreak of a Soviet-American war to renew US assistance to the National 
Government, 
Implementation of the National Government'e plan to use Taiwan  
as an anti-Communist base is stimulating native Taiwanese resentment 
against Chinese rule. Recent reports indicate a continued influx of 
Nationalist military and civilian personnel as well as the transfer

Southeast China, Taiwan included. In their frustration over oonditions 
of Nationalist military rule, native groups may soon painifest their 
eesertment of continued US aid to the National Government, for example, 
the recent visit of US naval vessels to Taiwan to unload US empunition 
for the Nationalist Army.

have left Hong Kong and Nationalist China recently, bound for Manchuria) 
tse for Borth China where a meeting reportedly is to be held at 
Shihohiachuang. These leaders, many of them intellectuals possessed 
of slight political strength or aptitude, apparently feel the time has 
come to visit Connuniet areas and find out what their future role in 
a non-Kuomintang, Communist-dominated provisional government viii be. 
While LI avowedly expects to be "president" and others hope to receive 
posts at the national or local level, some of the visitors are chiefly 
concerned with constitutional issues. From the Communist viewpoints 
their chief importance may be in furnishing some basis on paper for 
cleaning establishment of a "coalition" provisional government. 
Communists  demand unconditional surrender of Nationalists, MAO 
Tse-tung'e official reply to CRIANG Kai-she108 New Tear peace proposal 
was a list of demands which, if accepted, would amount to the unconditional 
surrender of the Nationalist regime. MAO's eight demands were: (1) 
punishment of "mar criminals" (at least 43 government leaders); (2) 
abrogation of the Constitution (adopted in 1946 without Communist 
participation); (3) abolition of the Kuomintangts "traditional insti-
tutions" (example: the tradition of dating events from 1911, the birth 
of the Republic); (4) reorganization of the Nationalist Armies (pre-
sumably their elimination, or inclusion in Communist forces); (5) con-
fiscation of "bureaucratic capital" (a -Communist phrase which means 
all large holdings); (6) agrarian reform; (7) abrogation of "traitorous" 
treaties; and (8) convocation of a political consultative conference, 
excluding all "reactionary" (anti-Communist) elements, and trans-
fer of all power from the Kuomintang to a "democratic coalition" 
(Communist-controlled) government. There is no possibility that the 
Rational Government, as presently constituted, will comply with the 
demands b MAO's reply, however, is not mere rhetoric. Whether this or 
any successor Nationalist regime complies or not, and whether the 
Communist demands are to be realized through peace or ear, it is clear 
that the Communists intend to carry out this proeramo

Communist administration closed down the Consulate's radio* A Com-
munist spokesman in Hong Kong recently stated that the question of 
communication with the U6 Consulate in Mukden "is part of the larger 
question of the US attitude" toward the forthcoming Communistecontrolled 
government of China, and will "depend upon the course of US policy." 
The US Consulate-General in Tientsin, as of the second day of 
Communist occupation, retained the use of its radio and consular 
personnel had complete freedom of movement, but the political officer 
of the Communist forces told the Consul-General that "as the US 
does not recognize the Communist government, there could be no formal 
official relationships." Milne the Communist ofricer did state that 
"informal friendly discussion" and presentation of grievances "would 
be welcome at any time," it is quite possible that the Consulato-
General in Tientsin will lose both the use of its radio and its freedom 
of movenert and become as isolated as Mukden0 
Arraneements for resumption  2L!Ankielng-A2liet trade, embodied 
in a new Sino-Soviet trade pact, will soon be put into effect, according 
to a report from the US Consul in Tihwac The fact that the USSR 
has cooperated in trade arrangements on a governmental level with 
Sinkiang represents a major development in Soviet policy toward Sinkiang. 
Since withdrawal from the province in 1943, the USSR has refused to 
conclude any commercial agreement on whatever terms with the Tihwa 
Government. Resumption of trade at this time indicates Soviet approval 
of the newly appointed Sinkiang Governor BURKBAN and will greatly 
strengthen the pro-Soviet provincial coalition government which is 
expected to result from BURKHAN'a appointment* 
In exchange for the renewal of Sinkiang-Soviet trade which is 
vital to the success of any Sinkiang provincial regime, the Soviets 
are reported to have secured Chinese acceptance of the Ashen zone 
of northeast Sinkiang. Outright Soviet annexation of Aehan zone 
mould represent recognition of what has been a virtual fait accompli 
for the past three years. Since early 1946, Ashen has been completely 
Soviet-dominated and a mining expedition, guarded oy Soviet troops, 
has been actively mining wolfram in that area. 
1Teng Kong begins direct trade with Chinese Communists. According 
to a late report, a Norwegian freighter recently departed from Bong 
Kong bound for the South Manchurian port of Antung. Other reports 
from Hong Kong indicate that a modest commerce with Manchuria, via 
North Korea, has existed for several months. Chinese merchants in 
Hong Kong have visited Manchuria, according to these reports, in order 
to make barter arrangements, since Manchurian and North Korean currency 
is unacceptable in payment. Official figures on imports from Korea 
from September through November total NK$ 20 million, as compared 
with HK$ 14 million for the first 8 months of 1948, thus suggesting 
that indirect trade with Communist Manchuria has been going on for some 
time.

Cabinet meeting was held to formulate instructions for French High C cassis-

the French Government's proposals for the conclusion of a Franc o-Vietnasseve

French Government, Bao Dal reiterated that this more would depend upon 
French satisfaction of Vietnamese aspirations. In this connection, General 
Xuan president of the Provisional Central Government in Vietnam, recently 
stated that although the Vietnamese population "ardently" desires the ecc-
emperor's return, ouch action is subordinate to the fulfillment of demands 
for real independence. These demands continue to include Vietnamese con-

of a new currency which will not be tied to the French franc. The French

to staff an interim government, together with an increase in the nuMber
