EMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Support 
SUBJECT: Historical Farm Traces on Campus 
I had a call from the National Capitol Park Service's 
Jim Putnam, telephone 557-8992. They have discovered a 1776 
farm site adjacent to our campus. They propose to do something 
about it in a reconstruction or historical park sense. They 
think there may be some adiacent archeological remnants to 
this farm on our property. They ask if someone who might have 
access to old plats, early survey maps, etc., etc. prior to 
the development of the area get in touch with then. 
I told the man that unless he turned out to be the OR 
trying to dig a hole in our campus, I am sure we would be 
glad to get in touch with him and do for him whatever we could. 
I would appreciate it if somebody could get in touch with 
Ir. Putnam. I gather that some of our prople already are 
exchanging data with the National Capitol Park people on our 
property here. Mr. Putnam said he would be glad to keep us 
posted on any press releases they do on the matter.

14 CITY POLICEMEN 
GOT GIL TRAINING 
Learned How to Analyze 
and Handlo Information 
By DAVID BURNHAM 
. Fourteen New York Police-
men--including First Deputy 
Police Commissioner William 
, H. T. Smith and the com-
mander of the department's 
\i Intelligence Division?received 
training from the Central Intel-
ligence Agency in September. 
( A spokesman for the C.I.A., 
V Angus Thuermer, confirmed 
that the 14 New Yorkers had 
been Oven training but denied 
that the agency had regular in-
struction programs for local 
police officials. 
Mr. Thuermer acknowledged, 
however, that "there have been 
a number of occasions when 
similar courtesies have been 
?extended to , police officers 
from different cities around 
the country." 
Its response to an inquiry, 
Mr, Thuermer said he was not 
Able to determine how many 
police officials or how many 
departments had come to the 
Washington area to receive 
agency training. 
' "I doubt very much that they 
keep that kind of information," 
he added. 
? Mr. Thuermer scoffed when 
asked whether the agency's 
training of policemen?some of 
whom are responsible for col-
lecting information about po-
litical activists?violated the 
Congressional legislation that 
created the C.I.A. to correlate 
and evaluate intelligence relat-
ing to national security, "pro-
vided that the agency shall 
have no police, subpoena, law-
? enforcement powers or internal 
, security functions." 
Twelve of the New York 
policemen?one captain, three 
lieutenants, five sergeants and 
? three detectives?received four 
days of training from the C.I.A. 
1/in a facility in Arlington, Va., 
y'. beginning last Sept. 11, accord-
ing to the Police Department. 
Commissioner Smith and 
Deputy Chief Hugo J. Masini, 
commander of the Intelligence 
? Division, attended one day's 
. training, on Sept. 13. ? 
Commissioner Smith said dur-
ing an interview that in con-
neCtion with the reorganization 
.of the department's intelligence 
work, "we decided we needed 
some training in the analysis 
and handling of large amounts 
of4nfoymation."--- -? - ? ? -? -. I 
STATI NTL 
Mr. Smith said the depart-
ment had decided that the 
C.I.A. would be the best place 
for such training. "They pretty 
much set this up for us," he 
explained. "The training was 
done gratis, only costing us 
about $2,500 in transportation 
and lodging." 
Both the International Asso-
ciation ?of Chiefs of Police, a 
professional organization that 
does police efficiency studies 
and runs training seminars an 
a variety of law-enforcement 
subjects, and the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation said 
they were not equipped to pro-
vide instruction on the storage, 
retrieval and analysis of intelli-
gence ?information. 
One branch of the Police 
Department's Intelligence Divi-
sion, the security investigation 
section, is the subject of a 
pending suit in Federal court 
here. The suit, filed by a group 
of political activists, charges 
that the. surveillance and infil-
tration activities of the secur-
ity section violate "the rights 
of privacy, free speech and as-
sociation granted and guaran-
teed" the plaintiffs "by the 
United States Constitution." 
The present reorganization of 
the security section?and the 
part of the Intelligence Division 
that collects information on 
organized crime?is being fi-
nanced by a $166,630 grant 
from the Law Enforcement As-
sistance Administration, a 
branch of the Justice Depart-
ment. As of Oct. 13, a police 
roster indicated that there were 
365 policemen assigned to the 
Intelligence Division.

Bratwurst at.C.I. A, Cafeteria 
Sample of New.Capital,Fare, 
STATI NTL 
Special to The Neer York nines - 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20?If 
you could get security clear-
ance, you could treat yourself 
to a German-style lunch of 
bratwurst with sauerkraut, or 
knackwurst with red kohl, at 
a little out-of-the-way spot 
called Die Wunder Deli Bar. 
Security clearance to get 
into a delicatessen? Absolutely, 
when it's in the cafeteria of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, 
tucked away in the woods of 
Langley, Va., just northwest of 
Washington. 
But ? say you're more the 
Meat-and-potatoes type. If you 
had business to do at the 
State Department, you might 
drop into the cafeteria: there 
to pick out a likely looking rib 
eye steak, have it charbroiled 
to order by an agile grillman 
who wears a black 10-gallon 
hat, and sit down to a hearty 
meal, with french fries and 
sliced tomatoes. 
All this is possible these days 
because of a move by the Gov-
ernment to make more inviting 
the 145,000 lunches that it 
serves every day to Federal 
workers in the Washington area 
?a task that compares to feed-
ing the entire population of 
Paterson, N. J. 
A Mixed Reaction 
The remodeled State Depart-
ment cafeteria, with its orange-
paneled pillars and side walls 
the color of underripe bananas, 
is the most recently completed. 
Along with the grill, which also 
serves up barbecued spareribs 
and chicken platters, there is a 
seafood line that includes scal-
lops and fish and a shrimp bas-
ket with french fries and cole-
slaw. 
The reaction of customers 
has been mixed, 
"Well, it's brighter, and 
they've put an some new equip-
ment," an executive secretary - 
in the foreign aid area said 
over lunch one day. "But I was 
satisfied the way it was be-
fore." 
On the other hand, a young 
foreign aid specialist who had 
just emerged from the grill area 
was happy about the whole 
thing. 
"I've been spending more 
money on lunch because I'm 
more attracted to the food," he 
said. "I used to spend about 
SO cents; now I average about 
S1.30, $1.60 a day." 
The improvement program 
was begun about three years 
ago, when the Government's 
housekeeping agency, the Gen-
eral Services Administration, 
discovered that the 35 cafe-
terias that ..are serviced under 
one contract in Government 
buildings here were losing cus-
tomers and money. 
A Side Benefit 
The nonprofit corporation 
that has run the cafeterias for 
going on 50 years was told to 
bring in some new management 
talent and fresh ideas to im-
prove the food and surround-
ings. 
"We're trying to get away 
from the institutional- stereo-
types ? the long lines, green-
gray walls, the dull appearance 
of foods?and create as much 
atmosphere as we can, like the 
cook in the cowboy hat," ex-
plained Frank Capps, the G.S.A. 
official in charge of Govern-
ment buildings. 
The trick was to provide all 
this and still keep ? the meals 
reasonably priced by the stand-
ards of Government workers 
who, according to cafeteria 
managers, seem to think ? of 
lunch as a side benefit of their 
employment.

The tract was owned by the Federal

And his defection to the

again sounds as if it may

Agency, had come back like 
'persistent ghosts to haunt 
him. The problem last week 
for the 42-year-old ex-CIA 
executive - turned - author, 
though, was the locale the 
CIA "spooks" had chosen: 
the' courts. 
A U.S. District Court in 
Alexandria, Va. ? a suburb 
- of Washington ? had grant-
ed the government unprece-
dented "prior restraint" aft-
er the CIA had filed suit 
against Marchetti to in Lizzie 
him on the subject of intelli-
gence activities in the U.S. 
Marchetti, who had turned 
to. writing as a way of mak-
ing a living since he quit (in 
good graces) his CIA job in 
I909, had published one spy 
novel and had had publish-
ing offers for other work in 
a tnonfiction category. 
CIA Alarmed 
Given to statements sitch 
as, "This excessive secrecy, 
the sanctity of the cult of in-
telligence, is just so much 
crap," and "In my opinion, 
the CIA is not qualified to 
decide what violates. nation-
al security," Marchetti had 
roused the apprehension of 
.his former colleagues 
? 
nonfiction work. Apparently 
alarmed, the CIA 'had then 
filed suit in Superior Court, 
without informing Marchetti 
of its intent to do so.' 
The result had been the 
temporary restraining or-
der, and the little-noticed 
emergence of a test case 
that showed signs of major 
significance in the contest 
between freedom o f the 
press and 'government cen-
sorship. 
The court had 'accepted 
government allegations of 35 
breaches of sectjrity (pub 
lishing of classified materi-
al) in Marchetti's writings 
I n magazines and ? other 
forms of publication. Mar-
chetti had admitted only two 
of the alleged disclosures: 
the code name. of a down-
state Virginia CIA training 
"farm," and the title of the 
Air Force satellite recon-
naissance organization. 
However, on the strength 
of -arguments- that the gov-
ernment could obtain ' no 
adequate monetary compen-

release of classified materi-

constituted a violation of

WASHINGTON ? A little-notic.cd? 
government suit against an ox-CIA.man is under way and could have 
far, greater impact on government 
secrecy restrictions than the Penta-
/
gon Papers trial in Los Angeles. 
A U.S.-district court in Alexandria, 
Va., has enjoined -Victor L. Marchet-
ti, 412, now a writer, from violating 
the pledge of secrecy in his CIA con-
tract. It granted the government. un-
precedented "prior restraint" via- ci-
vil process on his writings On intel-
ligence subjects. * 
If the government's view is upheld 
through appeal courts, authorities 
will have a. potent new weapon for 
curbing security leaks. 
The White House has followed the 
case closely and is considering in-
serting- the same CIA secrecy provi-
sion into all government employ-
ment contracts ii the snit is upheld 
. in the ccufts, 
This would proba.bly inhibit press 
contacts with officials who would 
become more vulnerable to govern-. 
ment legal action. Much less proof is 
needed to show a breach of contract 
in civil court than the 'heavy bur-
den" required of the government in 
criminal CRSOS,like Daniel Ellsberg's, 
where intent to harm the national 
interest, as well as actual harm to 
those interests, must be proved. 
? On the other hand, if the courts 
uphold all of Marchetti's arguments,. 
as presented by the American Civil 
Liberties -Union, the CIA contract's 
secrecy agreement could be declared 
unenforceable and much more intel-
ligence information would become 
:public from former CIA employes. 
This, aside from making a living, 
is Marchetti's declared aim. Tic 
wants to open the agency up to 
? greater congressional and public 
scrutiny and to force the refoi'm of 
what he calls its "clandestine-orient-
? ed" attitudes and practices. 
"This excessive secrecy, the sanc-
tity of the cult of intelligence, is just 
- so much crap," Marchetti said in an 
interview in his comfortable subur-
ban home. He alleges there is enor-
mous waste and inadequate congres-
sional control over the CIA's S700 
Million annual budget and the oper-
ations of its 17,000 emplbyes. ? 
The CIA refuses to discuss the

WASHINGTON CLOSE-UP 
konage, to CIA DrEm 
- 
The American Medical Asso-
ciation, which predictably of-
fers few surprises at its an-
nual meeting, achieved the un-
expected this year. 
As one entered the conven-
tion's exhibition hall in San 
Francisco's Civic Cent a r, 
-one's nostrils were assailed by 
an odor more appropriate to 
that city's Haight-Ashbury dis-
trict ? an aroma strongly 
suggestive of the burning 
leaves and blossoms of the fe-
male Cannabis sativa plant. 
The scent fired the curiosity 
of all in the hall who had ever 
sampled marijuana and drew 
from the wife of one physician 
attending the meeting the re-
mark that she had smelled 
that odor many times in the 
back of the school bus she 
? drives. 
That was only-the beginning 
of the surprise. Following 
one's nose, one soon came 
upon a booth housing an exhib-
it on drug abuse which fea-
tured a display about many 
drugs including pot, and a de-
vice that generated a synthetic 
smoke that was close to, if not 
identical with the real thing. 
There was still more surpise 
to come in this display, which 
? it turned out?had won 
the gold medal in the AMA's 
coveted Billings Prize compe-
tition as one of the outstanding 
scientific exhibits of the meet-
ing. The exhibitor was no 
mere doctor or pharmaceuti-
cal firm, or even your aver-
? age, run-of-the-mill science-
oriented government bureau. 
It was that most unlikely of 
contenders for an AMA 
award: The . Central 
Intelli-
genee Agency. 
Dr. Donald Borcherding of 
the CIA was on hand to ex-
plain the exhibit's origins. 
Like most agencies, he said, 
the CIA has . an occupational 
health division whose job it is 
to promote the well-being of 
Its personnel. When CIA offi-
cials at the agency's Langley, 
By Mit 1-1 RANDAL 
- Va., headquarters bee a me 
worried about pot, LSD, speed, 
heroin and the like, Borcherd-
ing and his colleagues assem-
bled the display. 
According to the CIA medic, 
it was an immediate hit, not 
only at the Langley "Spook 
Farm" but also among groups 
in the community, such as 
Knights of Columbus lodges 
and parent-teacher associa-
tions. The CIA is thinking 
about putting together "how-
to-do-it" instructions so that 
other groups can build their 
own replicas. 
Gr an t e d, the crusade 
against drug abuse needs al 
the help it can get. But the 
trouble with the CIA exhibit is 
that it does not tell things 
strictly as they are. For exam-
ple, i( implies that the use of 
marijuana sets the stage for 
later use of heroin. This issue 
is by no means settled and, as 
a matter of fact, there is a 
good deal of evidence to sug-
gest that alcohol, rather than 
marijuana, is the first drug to 
be abused by most peaple who 
subsequently become . heroin 
addicts. 
In any case, many experts 
believe that if there is any 
connection whatever between 
pot and heroin, it is their ille-
gal status and that if the for-
mer were "decriminalized," 
its link with the latter would 
tend to disappear. 
More important to this dis-
cussion than an argument 
about the casual relationship 
of the two drugs is the point 
that the CIA does not come 
into the campaign with com-
pletely clean hands. Reporters 
have been hearing for more 
than a year that the agency 
has been supporting the heroin 
traffic in the Golden Triangle 
region of Laos, Thailand and 
Burma, and that this opium 
byproduct has been one of the 
more important cargoes car-
ried by Air America, an air-
line operating in Southeast 
nght ironic 
Asia whose charter business i 
almost exclusively with the 
CIA. The Golden Triangle re-
gion, incidentally, is said to 
grow 70 percent of the world's 
illicit opium from which mor-
phine base, morphine and 
eventually heroin are derived. 
For more details on the 
CIA's complicity in the heroin 
mess, one might consult an 
article entitled "Flowers of 
Evil" by historian Alfred W. 
McCoy, in the July issue of 
Harper's magazine. Part of a 
forthcoming book called "The 
Politics of Heroin in Southeast 
Asia," the article spells out in 
detail how Vag Pao, long the 
leader of a CIA secret army in 
Laos, has become even more 
deeply involved in the drug 
traffic and what role this traf-
fic has played in the importa-
tion of heorin into the United 
States and its use by our 
troops in South Vietnam. 
Writes McCoy of the situa-
tion: "As a result of direct and 
indirect American involve-
ment, opium production has 
steadily increased, high-grade 
heroin production is flourish-
ing and the Golden Triangle's 
POPPY fields have become 
linked ? to markets in Europe 
and the U.S." 
The CIA went away from the 
San Francisco meeting with a 
gold medal and, no doubt, a 
good many doctors who saw

tied over the next several months. No-
body has mentioned how much we have 
wasted on research and development. 
The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gen-
tleman from California has expired. ? 
(By unanimous consent, Mr. LEGGETT 
was allowed to proceed for an additional 
minutes.) 
Mr. LEGGETT. Mr. Chairman, no-
body has mentioned how much we have 
wasted on the full 12 site deployment 
program, which is clearly banned by the 
SALT agreement.. 
I am sure there is nobody in this room 
who doubts that the SALT Treaty is go-
ing to be approved, and also the law 
which has to be enacted by this House 
and by the other body respecting the 
limitation on offensive weapons. 
So far as the Safeguard system is con-
cerned, our whole effort in building the 
progra.m around Malmstrom and Grand 
Forks was to guarantee that we would 
have a retaliatory force that would be 
Invulnerable to a first strike by the So-
viet Union. So therein lies the reason 
why we were stampeding ahead to build 
at this billion dollar rate. 
We have to recogni,ze that as a result 
of the SALT agreements and our ability 
to monitoi? 'front very high altitude there 
will be no ability on behalf of the Soviet 
Union to effectively make a first strike. 
Therefore, we have no reason to protect 
the Minuteman missile sites. 
I believe we should go ahead and per-
haps complete them, but why, I say, at 
this Scandalously high rate of accelera-
tion, in view of the fact that we have 
probably wasted in excess of $2 billion 
making this a _bargaining chip? We can 
go ahead to proceed at the $403 million 
rate rather than the $700 million-plus 
rate and still complete Grand Forks, and 
study whether or not we need a Minute-
man site at what we call the National 
Command Center, which now is Wash-
ington. 
I always thought that, our National 
Command 'Center was in a rock hole at 
Colorado Springs, but now it is Wash-
/Ili gton 
I know we have hard sited the Penta-
gon and hard sited the CIA. I say that if 
the National Conunand Center in the 
White House, why, the President is only 
there about one-third of the time, and we 
ought to be spending at least two-thirds 
of this money at Key Biscayne or at San 
Clemente. 
do not mean 'to he facetious, but we 
are really stampeding ahead trying to 
meet the Soviet Union because they have 
the Golosh system around Moscow. I be-
lieve the record shows that as the result 
of the deployment of the mechanical and 
rather obsolete Golosh system around 
Moscow, according to Some of our experts, 
including Secretary Laird, Moscow is less 
secure today than it was before the de-
ployment of the Galosh system. 
Now, if we want to make Washington 
less secure, all we have to do is go ahead 
and stampede forward and put the 100 
ABM sites around the city. That means, 
instead of just targeting two or three 
ICBM's for the Capital, we will be tar-
geting about 102 or 103. 
My God! I hope that ABM system 
works, Otherwise we are really in worse 
shape, because if we have only a 75-per-
cent effectiveness rate out of it, we have 
multiplied the missiles that will be 
knocking out the Capital by several thou-
sand percent. So I think we can really 
slow down in this program. 
The: President has said as he signed 
the SALT agreements that we want to 
stop the arms race. Secretary Laird has 
said, let us stop the arms race, but we 
have to accelerate these other programs 
and be ready in 5 or 10 years when the 
5-year agreement on offensive missiles 
expires. 
I do not think we ought to accelerate 
under the SALT umbrella. That is the 
fundamental question that has to be de-
cided by this Congress. I will ask for a 
record vote on this amendment. I think 
we have to either take the President at 
his word that he wants to deescalate the 
arms race, or else we are going to be 
spending all our money for these quality 
accelerations under the terms of the 
agreement. I think we can well afford to 
cut out at least $350 million from this 
item without degrading our defense one 
Iota, but merely looking forward to not 
having quite so expensive bargaining 
chips as we have had in the past. 
Mr. ARENDS-. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to have 
the attention of the gentleman who just 
preceded me, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia. 
I thought you were doing pretty well 
until you mentioned Bob McNamara,. 
Then you lost me. 
Mr. Chairman, as a result of reduc-
tions, made by SALT, the bill reduces the 
Safeguard ABM authorization $532 mil-
lion below the original request. 
The amendment of the gentleman from 
California, would delete an additional 
$350 million from the Safeguard pro-
gram.. 
The gentleman's amendment would re-
sult in eventually raising the cost of the 
system. The components of the Safe-
guard's complex system are procured 
over a period of years but the amend-
ment would cut so deeply that it would 
interrupt the pipeline and force a reduc-
tion in the production process. 
The site at Grand Forks, N. Da.k., is 90 
percent completed. Dr. Kissinger has told 
us very clearly that this was one of the 
big incentives in getting the Russians to 
agree to sign an arms limitation agree-
ment. To fail to complete the deployment 
new would be sheer folly. It would either 
mean that eventual completion of the 
system would be more expensive or it 
would mean failure to complete the sys-
tem which would take away the incen-
tive for the Russians to continue further 
arms negotiations. 
Some of the materials on order for 
Malmstrom, Whiteman, and Warren, the 
discontinued sites, can be used at the 
Washington, D.C., site. But the gentle-
man' amendment would cut so deep that 
it would prevent continued orderly pro-
curement of materials and probably 
eventually raise the cost of that site. 
I earnestly urge that the amendment 
be defeated. 
The CHAIRMAN. The question le en

from California (Mr. LEGGETT)

?? By LONDON EXPRESS 
Rumours are rampant in Washington that a Britieh. 
film unit has been allowed to wander inside the super-
secret headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
It is the first .time in all its bizarre history that 
the agency has thrown open it's doors to cameras, and 
I gather the whole affair caused some angst at high 
. levels in the U.S. intelligence ,community. 
Michael Winner, the normally witty and talkative 
director who has been in Washington to shoot his new 
' ? film, "Scorpio," a spy thriller starring Burt Lancaster, 
Paul Scofield and Alain Delon, is shrinkingly reticent 
on the subject. Ile refuses comment of any kind. 
? Other sources say the film publicity will not mention 
the 'extent of the CIA's hospitality, and the full story 
of this extraordinary episode may not be known for 
years. 
. The .. CIA until now it has managed to preserve 
a monastic privacy by tight security and a press office 
_which seems to have taken Trappist vows. 
Not long ago the CIA wanted to talk Congress into 
buying them extra land in Langley, Va., so as to make 
the headquarters even harder for outsiders to approach. 
; ? . 
Some agents climbed to the top of a nearby hill and 
took pictures of the director's seventh-floor office using'a telephoto lens. 
Then they enlarged the original photograph many 
tithes. In the final print the grainy and blurred head 
of the CIA .director could just be discerned, working 
at his desk. ? They showed it. to Congress which quickly 
agreed to buy the land. 
Now this fabulous Vatican of Western intelligence 
, ? has been breached by a young English film director. 
"Scorpio" is a taut. suspense drama in which Burt 
? Lancaster plays an American agent suspected of selling 
out to the Russians and Alain Delon is a freelance 
assassin blackmailed by the CIA into trying to murder 
him. The script reeks of alienation as do many of 
Winner's films, but it makes no severe moral judgments 
about the sometimes ruthless methods of American es-
ptonage. 
"We only show the CIA killing nasty agents," Win-
ner said. leaning back in his director's chair and puffing 
at a $3 cigar. 'Young people in America think the CIA 
shbuld not exist, but that is naive." 
The abundantly talented Winner, who manages to 
look simultaneously debauched and cherubic, says he 
found. the CIA officials "terribly charming and cheerful 
and gentlemanly at all times." 
? 
"Scorpio" has created the biggest movie sensation 
In Washington since Otto Pretninger ordered senators 
around during the shooting of "Advise and Consent" 
nearly 10 years ago. 
One congressman, James Wright of Texas, dressed 
up as a priest and collected $25 for a days work as 
an extra when Winner filmed a sequence at Washington 
airport. Huge mobs of onlookers assembled in Georae-
' town to watch Burt Lancaster shoot John Colicos with 
a gun wrapped in a brown- paper bag, 
At a' roller-Skating rink, all sounds drowned by the 
'throb of a mighty Wurlitzer pipe organ, Winner ex-
plained that he keeps away from studios wherever 
possible and takes his cameras athong real people in 
authentic surroundings. 
"Its like modern guerrilla warfare," *he said. "I 
go out into the streets and shoot. If I get into trouble 
in one place, I can move somewhere else. And it saves 
spending large sums of money on extras. If I neen 
another. 10 people I just pull them out of the crowd.. 
Yesterday I pulled out four, found they came from 
Hampstead and had.to put them back again,"

By MICHAEL SATCHELL 
Star Staff Writer 
Three Marine Corps corpo-
rals have been charged with 
trespassing after breaking 
into the Central Intelligence 
Agency compound in Langley-
and getting to within 500 feet 
of the power plant. 
Some authorities say they 
think the Marines entered the 
highly guarded spy headquar-
ters on a dare. But Richard 
Helms, CIA director, said he 
did not rule out the possibility 
Of a sabotage attempt. 
The incident occurred be-
tween 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 
May 6. Security guards spot-
ted a car ? parked on George-
town Pike near the CIA head-
quarters and requested assist-
ance from Fairfax County po-
lice. 
After a search of approxi-
mately 45 minutes, according 
to a police sergeant who par-
ticipated, the Mkrines were 
found and arrested. 
.? 
? ? FAIRFAX POLICE identi-
' ifed the three arrested as Lar-
? ry. Peter Kreps, 21, Charles 
. Stephen Huff, 24, and Terry 
Wayne :Weatherly, 22. 
In a letter to Dr. William S. 
' ? 
? 
? 
erze 
Hoofiagle, chairman of the 
Fairfax Board of Supervisors, 
CIA boss Helms wrote in part.: 
"I have been informed of an 
incident which occurred early 
in the morning on 6 May 1972 
a n d involved unauthorized 
physical penetration of this 
agency's headquarter com-
pound. Although the case is 
still under investigation, a re-
view of the facts available to 
us now does not rule out the 
possibility of sabotage." ? 
The letter goes on to thank 
Members of the Fairfax police 
department for their assist-
ance. 
An officer who participated 
in the search said the Marines 
were carrying a flashlight and 
a pair of pliers. They had 
scaled a four-foot outer fence 
and then had 'climbed the 
main perimeter fence, which 
is eight feet high and tipped 
with barbed wire. They were 
climbing a third inner fence 
guarding the power plant 
when they were captured, the 
cfficer said. ? 
ASKED HOW three men 
would have penetrated far 
into the compound and re-
mained undiscovered for near-
ly an hour without being spot-
ted by security guards, a CIA 
jspokesman said yesterday the 
intrusion was not regarded as 
a major breach of security. 
"The whole tring was mi-
nor," said the spokesman. 
"Nothing happened." 
The Marines were taken by 
Fairfax police to the McLean 
substation and charged with 
trespassing on federal proper-
ty, a state offense. They were 
released on $1,000 bond each, 
police said. The men were 
questioned at length by federal 
authorities but no federal 
charges have been filed. 
A Marine Corps public infor-
mation officer said the men 
were members of A Company 
attached to battalion head-
quarters at Henderson Hall in 
Arlington. 
"They have been returnedlo 
a normal work routine and 
they are under no restraint," 
the officer said. "It is a civil 
matter at this point and no 
Marine Corps action is antici-
pated until after the civil ac-
tion is completed." 
Weatherly ' was reached by 
telephone yesterday but re-
fused to discuss the incident.

IZ Yreedoan Inalienable? 
If not, it will be alienated, and ultimately destroyed. 
That is the paramount issue of the Victor Marchetti censor-
:ship case. [See Marchetti's "The CIA: The president's 
Loyal Tool"; The Nation, April 3.] 
Marchetti, now 42, graduated from Pennsylvania State 
University in 1955 with a degree in Russian studies and 
history. Ile was recruited for the CIA by a professor, who, 
.interestingly enough, was 'secretly on the agency's payroll 
as a talent scout. In time, Marchetti was promoted to 
the CIA executive staff .and served finally as executive 
assistant to Adm. Rufus L. Taylor, deputy director from 
1966 to 1969. Marchetti was with the agency for fourteen 
years, resigning in the same year as did Admiral Taylor. 
Obviously, Marchetti knows a lot about the CIA?that is 
part of the trouble. 
Ile was well thought of by his colleagues. Richard 
Helms, CIA director, presented him with an autographed 
picture inscribed, "To Vic?With appreciation for his 
support." But the longer Marchetti served the CIA the 
less he 'appreciated it and .its work. Among his reasons 
for Ic.aVing he cites "the clandestine attitude, the amorality 
of ..it all, the cold-war mentality?these kinds of things 
made me feel that the agency was really out of step with 
the times." .And: "It's one of my strong beliefs that the 
CIA has to be more tightly pverviewed by 'Congress. As 
it is now, the agency operates almost exclusively under 
the authority of the President." Thus the CIA is one of 
the factors in the subordination of the legislative branch 
to the executive. For that matter, once it is let 'loose on a 
project, the agency is subordinate: to the exeCutive itself 
only in, a very loose sense. As everyone now knows, it is 
carrying 'on a war in Laos at a cost of roughly $500 mil-
lion a year, using tribesmen as mercenaries and running 
its own airlines, etc. In the Kansas City area it maintains 
an arsenal, with a "huge inventory" of weapons, for its,/ 
foreign operations; it has bases for training. and 9ther 
purposes elsewhere in the United States. - 
The Marchetti case assumes constitutional importance 
because Mr. Marchetti, when he joined the CIA, signed 
the usual agreement not to write or talk about the agency's 
activities even after he left it. Marchetti came to the at-
tention .of The Nation when he wrote. a spy novel, The 
Rope Dancer, which had apparent reference to the CIA. 
Since this was in.fictional form it does not appear to have 
agitated the CIA management; nor did The Nation article 
which, together with some interviews Marchetti gave to 
newspapers, was read 15y Admiral Taylor, who had some 
reservations about accuracy but concluded that there was 
nothing damaging in .any of the material. But when Mar-
chetti contracted with Alfred A. Knopf to write a non-
fiction book about the CIA, the government got into 
action. Although Marchetti is willing to have the CIA re-
view the book for classified material, the government went 
before U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan., Jr. in Alex-
andria, Va., and obtained a temporary restraining order 
prohibiting Marchetti from writing the book for Knopf?
a book of which he has not yet set down a single line. 
The American Civil Liberties Union is trying to get the 
restraining ApprovedeEotoRaleaseu2001(13/04 : C IA-RDP80-01601 R000100100001 -2 
The question raised by the action on behalf of the goy; 
ernment is whether a U.S. citizen can agree to waive. iiis 
freedom of 'conscience, of thought, of moral sentiment in 
the manner prescribed by the CIA. The case dramatizes 
the fact that the CIA is essentially an alien institution--
alien to American custom, alien to the Constitution, and 
incompatible with both the forms and the spirit 'Of democ-
racy. In our view, Marchetti not only has the right but 
the moral obligation to write his book, just as it was his 
moral obligation to write the article .commissioned by 
The Nation. 
A ruling to that effect by the federal courts would not 
impose an unreasonable limitation on the proper and law-
ful activities of the CIA, or any other agency. It can set 
up rules, office policies, and normal administrative means 
of enforcement, but it cannot compel a former employee 
to waive his freedom to?say or write what he sees fit, once 
his employment is terminated. If an agency of the govern-
ment deems something that has been published to be in 
violation of law, it may proceed against the author and 
publisher, but pre-censorshi is repugnant to American 
institutions. STATINTL

to immobilize even the largest corporation. - 
Callers are being asked either to say "StOp,

TO INSURE telephone saturation at the 
Bedford plant, the "Dial for Peace" organi-. 
zers have plucked its number from more than 
a dozen Raytheon telephone listings, and have 
circulated it in printed form throughout the 
greater Boston area. 
VWednesday's offensive will be directed at 
the Boston office of the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 
No explanation has been offered for list-

Force on Summer street, Boston. ? 
The telephone campaign will end Friday', 
following all 'day harassment of Polaroid's 
main switchboard in Cambridge. 
Because of possible legal ramifications, 
no one group is claiming credit for the or-
ganization of "Dial for Peace." 
THE MAJOR revolutionary and pacifist 
groups in Boston and Cambridge readily ad-
mit their "familiarity" with the week-long 
campaign, but are unwilling to say 'much 
beyond believing the idea to be a good one." 
At the Greater Boston Peace Action Co-
alition's (GBPAC) Cambridge headquarters 
last Friday ,spokesmen disclaimed origina-
tion of the idea to utilize telephone harass-
ment as a feature of the continuing spring 
offensive, but thought the. idea "effective." 
GBPAC, a spearhead of this year's spring 
offensive alona with the revolutionary 
People's Coalition For Peace And Justice 
(PCPJ), believes the latter group to be the 
sponsor of the printed instructions outlining 
the ? telephone campaign. 
Those instructions were widely distribu-
uted throughout Boston and Cambridge on 
Friday. 
Printed on van-colored letter size hand-
bills, the ,instructions included by name and 
number, all five daily targets. 
Anonymous, the handbills specified that, 
"1,000 people" place 10 calls each, the 
"10,000" total adding up to a kind of "do-it-
yourself" campaign certain "to stop busi-: 
ness for a day." 
THE HANDBILL'S final line read: "If 
they won't stop the war, we'll stop them." 
At PCPJ's Brookline street, Cambridge 
headquarters, however, denials 'were issued 
Friday that they had put the telephone in-
structions in circulation. 
Like GBPAC, PCPJ spokesmen thought 
the telephone campaign to be worthwhile, 
but believed it probably originated at the 
Cambridge offices of the Quaker American 
Friends Service Committee (AFSC). 
The friends didn't seem to mind that 
PCPJ Was dropping a hot and possibly illegal 
potato in their laps, but a woman answer-
ing to the name of "Rachel" neither denied 
nor confirmed that the printed instructions 
had been run off at their Inman street head-
quarters offices.

ne Thing About CIA-It's Free : 
WASHINGTON, April 13?In an effort 
to Cheer taxpayers just before the in-
come tax filing deadline, I have made 
an exhaustive study of the 1,103 page 
efederal budget book searching for bar-. - 
gains. 
On page 860 there is a real winner. It 
is the Central Intelligence Agency. Ac-
cording to the auditors, the CIA is not 
costing the taxpayers one red cent this 
year. In 1971, yes, it cost $2 million for 
a new building. But today, nothing. 
This is amazing, especially when one 
considers all of the accounts of how the 
CIA is running airlines in South Ameri-
ca, financing armies in Cambodia, and 
diggihg all of those tunnels under the 
Berlin Wall. 
According to some accounts, the CIA 
is at least as large as the State Depart-
ment, and over there in Foggy Bottom 
the administrative cost is roughly $250 
million, depending upon how Sen. Wil-
liam Fulbright [D., Ark.] feels at any 
given moment. , 
Of course, the CIA is located in the 
low rent district of Virginia in the hills 
and valleys near the Potomac River. 
Bit even so, nothing is not very much 
to pay for even that kind of land and 
all of the people walking around on it. 
And, there are a lot of people working 
in those buildings, according to my as-
sociate, Hit Henderson, who slipped in 
there the other day with the cleaning 
women on a No. 56 bus. Henderson re-
ported that he saw several hundred 
cars in the free parking lots accorded 
' to the spies and assistant spies. 
In addition, several hundred other 
persons were coming to work on the 
second shift as the ' day-time crowd 
rushed home with their attache cases. ? 
Henderson slipped in under the guise 
of a nursery worker [trees, not babies] 
and .also reported back that the CIA's 
formal gardens were nicely landscaped, 
the furniture in the headquarters build-
ing was new and modern, and there 
were deep-piled rugs on some of the 
executive wing floors. 
He mentioned that the sign-in sheet 
for visitors must have Cost at least 
$100, namely because it was on a swivel 
and made several copies. On the way 
out, Henderson noted that his stashed 
car, waiting in the visitors parking lot, 
was blocked by other visitors. 
Oh, yes, the murals on the walls were 
modern art, altho Henderson himself 
prefers the classics. He could not esti-
mate a cost, if there was one. 
/ In a further effort to'find out hoWs the 
CIA operated on a no-cost basis, I per-
sonally got in touch [the method must 
remain secret] with Col. C. Gordon 
Furbish [ret.], one of the most knowl! 
edgeable persons in the metropolitan 
area of Washington. [Furbish is the 
creator of the saying, "Remember, no 
matter where you go, there you are."] 
"I am not at liberty to discuss the 
financial operations of the CIA," Fur-
bish said for the record. "However, I 
can tell you on a not-for-attribution ba-
sis that they snitch money out of the 
rest of the federal budget with special 
code designations." 
The colonel confided that the code 
word for the CIA in the rest of the 
budget was listed under "things." Sure 
enough, he was right. It's even on the 
White House budget, put down as 
"transportation for things?$1,000.". In 
the Department of Agriculture, "trans-
portation of Olngs" was recorded at 
$63,000. In tie Rural Electrification Ad-
ministration, "things" cost $38,000. 
Even the sub budgets listed "things." 
And there you are, another Anderson 
expose: The CIA's money comes from 
"things." And if readers think they are 
being bearded, the whole "thing," for 
CIA and everybody else, the entire fed-
eral budget, adds up to roughly $256 
billion this year. So, tonight, if you get 
indigestion while filling out income tax 
returns, take a couple of pills. You can 
tell your wife "I can't believe that I 
!paid for the whole thing:"

Mr. Marchetti was on the director's stag of the CIA when 
he resigned from the agency two years ago. Since then, his 
novel The Rope-Dancer has been published by Grosset & 
'Dunlap; he is now working on a book-length critical analysis 
of the CIA. 
The Central Intelligence Agency's role in U.S. foreign af-
fairs ? is, like the organization itself, clouded by secrecy 
and confused by misconceptions, many of them deliberately 
promoted by the CIA with the cooperation of the news 
media. Thus to understand the covert mission of this 
agency and to estimate its value to the political leadership, 
one must brush myths aside and penetrate to the sources 
and circumstances from which the agency draws its au-
thority and support. The CIA is no accidental, romantic 
aberration; it is exactly what those who govern the country 
intend it to bd?the clandestine mechanism whereby the 
executive branch influences the internal affairs of other 
nations. 
In conducting. such operations, particularly' those that 
are inherently risky, the CIA acts at the direction and with 
the approval of the President or his Special Assistant for 
National Security Affairs. Before initiating action in the 
field, the agency almost invariably establishes that its oper-
ational plans accord with the aims of the 'administration 
and, when possible, the sympathies of Congressional lead-
ers. (Sometimes the endorsement or assistance of influen-
tial individuals and institutions outside government is also 
sought.) CIA directors have been remarkably well aware 
of the dangers they court, both personally and for the 
agency, by not gaining specific official sanction for their 
covert operations. They are, accordingly, often more care-
ful than are administrators in other areas of the bureau-
cracy to inform the White House of their activities and to 
: seek Presidential blessing. To take the blame publicly 
for an occasional operational blunder is a small price to 
pay in return for the protection of the Chief Executive and 
the men who control the Congress. 
? The U-2 incident of 1960 was viewed by many as an 
outrageous blunder by the CIA, wrecking the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev summit conference in Paris and setting U.S.-
? Soviet relations back several years. Within the inner circles 
of the administration, however, the shoot-down was 
shrugged off as just one of those things that happen in the 
chancy business of intelligence. After attempts to deny 
responsibility for the action had failed, the President openly 
defended and even praised the work of the CIA, although 
for obvious political reasons he avoided noting that he had 
authorized the disastrous flight. The U-2 program against 
the USSR was canceled, but work on its follow-on system, 
the A-11 (now the SR-71,) was speeded up. Only the 
launching of the reconnaissance satellites put an end to 
espionage against the Soviet Union by manned aircraft. 
The A-11 development program was completed, neverthe-
less, on the premise that it, as well as the U-2, might be 
useful elsewhere.

The reorganization of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity late last year in no way altered the CIA's mission as 
the clandestine action arm of American foreign policy. 
Most of the few changes are intended to improve the finan-
cial management of the community, especially in the mili-
tary intelligence services where growth and the technical 
costs of collecting information are almost out of control. 
Other alterations are designed to improve the meshing of 
the cammunity's product with national security planning 
and to provide the White House with greater control 
over operations policy. However, none of that implies a 
reduction of the CIA's role in covert foreign policy action. 
In fact, the extensive rzview conducted by the White House 
staff in preparation for the reorganization drew heavily on 
advice provided by the CIA and that given by former 
agency officials through such go-betweens as the influential 
Council on Foreign Relations. Earlier in the Nixon Admin-
istration, the Council had responded to a similar request 
by recommending that in the future the CIA should con-
centrate its covert pressure tactics on Latin American, 
African and Asian targets, using more foreign nationals as 
agents and relying more on private U.S. corporations and 
other institutions as covers. Nothing was said about reduc-

WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 ? 
American forces on Taiwan, re-
ported to number 8,000 to 
9,000, are there to help defend 
the Chinese Nationalist refuge 
and they also support Ameri-
can troops in Vietnam. 
About half the men are sta-
tioned at the Ching Chuan 
Kang air ba ee. in the center of 
the island near the provincial 
capital of Taichung, where 
there are sizable repair facili-
ties.Transports often stop there 
on the way to Vietnam from 
Okinawa. 
American defense responsi-
bilities under a 1954 treaty are 
exercised by the Taiwan De-
fense Command, headed by 
Vice Adm. Walter Baumberger. 
The command has only a few 
hundred men but could be en-
larged if hostilities broke out. 
Air Force Headquarters 
The 13th Air Force has al 
forward headquarters on Tai- I 
wan that is a detachment fromi 
iits Main headquarters at Clark 
-1Air Force Base in the Pihilip-
pines. It too has a small num-
ber of men and only a few 
Phantom jet fighters. 
There have been reports that 
the United States has deployed 
nuclear weapons on Taiwan 
but they have been denied by 
authoritative sources here and 
in Asia.

visory group on Taiwan num-
bers abut 300 men. They help

History of Defense 
When the Chinese Commu-
nists came to power on the 
mainland in 1949, President 
Truman said that the United 
States would . not become in-
volved in any conflict over the 
island, to which Generalissimo 
Chiang Kai-shek and his fol-
lowers had fled. 
But when the Chinese Com-
munists entered the Korean war 
toward the end of 1950, Mr. 
Truman affirmed American sup-
port for the nationalists and be-
gan military assistance to Tai-
wan. President Eisenhower in-
creased military aid. 
The 1954 mutual defense 
treaty defined Nationalist Chi-
nese territory as Taiwan and

American forces to the defense 
of Taiwan. An effort in the 
Senate last year to repeal the 
resolution failed.

gradually reduced its forces in 
the Formosa Strait, ceased pa-

THE ROAD 
( TO PEKING - 
() 
She 
_hi 
affic 
-' Por example, Rand Corp.' Sinologist William- W. Whitson" ? 
STATI NTL, has come up with a theory fitting the known facts. It suggests 
that the power struggle was the culmination of a debate within 
? the Chinese hierarchy over ailocation of resources to China's 
nuclear weapons program?and that Chou's victory over Lin 
will make China less of a threat to U.S. allies in Asia in the 
? ,Immediate future than it has been considered in the past. 
Whitson, a military specialist, is one of those China ex-
perts who does research for the government and also maintains 
ties with the academic community. His new book, "The 
Chinese High Command, 1927-1971?a History of Communist 
Military Politics," will be published this spring. 
According to Whitson, Lin Piao vigorously opposed last 
year's decision by Chou?with Mao's concurrence?to reduce 
tensions with the United States. . 
?The reason was that TA n and his supporters in the Air 
Force and Navy needed the supposed American threat to 
justify development of bigger and bigger nuclear weapons and 
long-range missiles to deliver them. 
The cost of China's nuclear and missile programs are 2% 
.of the still underdeveloped country's total national product?
,so high that Whitson argues that "some people across the river 
(a euphemism in Washington for CIA headquarters in Langley, / 
.Va.) say that we ought to encourage them to keep at it, because 
it will make them go bankrupt." 
Challenge fo Lin 
Whitson's contention is that Chou En-lai, in contrast to Lin, 
irecognized that the real threat to China was from Russia?
: which had massed one million troops on China's northern border 
and threatened a "surgical strike" against Chinese nuclear in-
stallations?instead of from the United States, which the premier 
'could see was in fact withdrawing from Southeast Asia.

NEWS Diplomatic Correspondent 
Fifth of a series 
? fi ? ? ? - - ? . .. ? 
ktjl NE of the eight black-bound loose-leaf volumes that 
President Nixon studied in preparation for his journey 
to Peking contained a top secret analysis by the Central 
i Intelligence Agency of the strange and still only parti-
ally explained events in China last fall?and the effect 
.that the internal power struggle they revealed may 
have on his summit talks, with the surviving Communist 
leaders. 
What went on in China in mid-September is still shrouded 
In mystery. Communist cadres in the provinces have been told 
that Defense Minister Lin Piao?until then the regime's no. 2 
mall?was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate party Chair-
man Mao Tse-tung and that when toe plot failed, Lin and his 
cohorts were killed in a plane crash in Mongolia while trying 
to flee to the Soviet Union. 
A British-built Trident jetliner, one of four purchased by 
China; from Pakistan and used exclusively by high-ranking 
Chinese officers, did indeed crash M Mongolia, 100 miles be-
yond the Chinese border, on the night of Sept. 12. But American 
analysts doubt that Lin was among the seven men and two 
women whose bodies were recovered from the airplane, burned 
beyond recognition. . 
But it is clear that the power struggle has ended?at least 
for the time being?and that a moderate faction led by Premier 
Chou En-lai triumphed over a radical faction led by Lin Piao. 
'Lin -and hundreds of his followers have beenn purged, but are 
though to be still alive. 
Whatever the reasons for the purge, the timing for it seems 
to have been sparked by Chou's invitation to Nixon to visit the 
People's Republic of China.

elusions are probably similar to those of analysts from other 
To Cope with the Soviet threat, China needed tactical nuclear 
-weapons as well as more modern conventional armament?not 
necessarily long-range ICBMs. Therefore, it is Whitson's belief 
that Chou wanted to slow down the costly advanced weapors 
program and thus welcomed Nixon's overtures to_end the 23- . 
year-old confrontation between the United States and China. 
- But the invitation to Nixon presented a challenge to Lin and 
the generals associated with past strategic planning. Whitson 
ruts it this way: . 
..-.:?,170 many of the senior officers of the second .kloyher-
. , 7.4 . ? 
ation, probably including Lin Piao, Wu Fa-hsien, Li Tso-p'eng 
and Huang Yung-sherg, the historical image of the United 
States as the principal adversary most heavily armed with nu-
clear weapons targeted against China must have been the cor-
nerstone of their premises for strategic planning and weapons 
development. 
"President Nixon's visit to China could not have been a wel-
come shift in the image that had presumably guided their 
strategic thinking for 20 years." 
Smaller bangs 
Since the mid-1960s, China has exploded 13 nuclear devices, 
including three hydrogen bombs with yields of three megatons 
each, in 1968, 1969 and 1970. But the last two tests, in November, 
1971 and January of -this year, were of smaller devices with 
yields of 20 kilotons or less?the size of the Hiroshima A-bomb. 
According to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the 
latest two tests could either have been of triggers for larger 
thermonuclear weapons or of prototypes of comparatively small, 
tactical nuclear warheads. If they were the latter, it would tend 
to confirm Whitson's theory that-Chou, after defeating Lin, has 
shifted priorities to concentrate on medium and intennediate 
range missiles instead of a costly intercontinental missile - 
arsenal. 
"Such an emphasis would provide an immediate deterrent 
against the Soviet Union," Whitson says. "It would also promise 
the greatest intercontinental utility once an appropriate sub- ? 
marine or two had been built." 
? If Whitson is right, this will be disconcerting to U.S. mil-
itary planners, who have advocated construction of an anti-
ballistic missile defense system for protection of the United 
States against Chinese ICBM's expected to be operational as 
-early as 1975, as much as against the nuclear-tipped Soviet 
intercontinental rockets already in their underground silos.

E. H. Cookridge continues his exclusive series on the CIA 
HE adventurous operations 
often bordering on the bizarre 
which the Central Intelligence 
Agency pursued in many parts 
of the world are usually 
ascribed to one man: Allen Dulles. 
They culminated in the abortive in-
vasion of Cuba in 1961. When Dulles 
departed from the directorship of CIA 
after the Bay of Pigs debacle, he 
certainly left an indelible stamp of his 
influence as the architect of the mighty 
CIA edifice and its worldwide rami-
fications. 
The policy of his successors has, 
however, been no less forceful. CIA 
activities under its present director, 
Richard McG arrah Helms, may 
appear less aggressive because they are 
? being conducted with greater caution 
and less publicity, and because they 
have been adroitly adjusted to the 
changing climate in international poli-
tics. In the past CIA gained notoriety 
by promoting revolutions in Latin 
American banana republics, and sup-
porting anti-communist regimes in 
South-East Asia. Its operations in 
Africa were more skilfully camou-
flaged. For many years they had been 
on a limited scale because the CIA had 
relied on the British secret service to 
provide intelligence from an area 
where the British had unsurpassed ex-
perience and long-established sources 
of information. But with the emergence 
of the many African independent 
countries, the wave of "anti-colonial-
ist" emotions, and the growing in-
filtration of Africa by Soviet and 
Chinese "advisers", British influence 
declined. Washington forcefully 
stepped, through CIA, into the breach; 
with the avowed aim of containing 
communist expansion. 
. . . 
Financial investments in new in-
dustrial and mining enterprises, and 
lavish economic aid to the emerging 
governments of the "underdeveloped" 
countries, paved the road for the influx 
of hundreds of CIA agents. Some com-
bined their intelligence: assignments 
with genuine jobs as technical, agri-
cultural and scientific advisers.

? THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING 
By Chester L. Cooper 
"The most fundamental method of work ... is to determine our working policies ac-
cording to the actual conditions. When we study the causes of the mistakes we have made, 
we find that they all arose because we departed from the actual situation ? .. and were 
subjective in determining our working policies."--"The Thoughts of Mao Tse-tung." 
IN bucolic McLean, Virginia, screened by trees and sur-
rounded by a high fence, squats a vast expanse of concrete 
and glass known familiarly as the "Pickle Factory," and 
more formally as "Headquarters, Central Intelligence Agency." 
Chiselled into the marble which is the only relieving feature of 
the building's sterile main entrance are the words, "The Truth 
Shall Make You Free." The quotation from St. John was 
personally chosen for the new building by Allen W. Dulles over 
the objection of several subordinates who felt that the Agency, 
then still reeling from the Bay of Pigs debacle, should adopt a 
.somewhat less lofty motto. (In those dark days of late 1961, some 
suggested that a more appropriate choice would be "Look Before 
You Leap.") But Dulles had a deeper sense of history than 
most. Although he was a casualty of the Bay of Pigs and never 
sat in the Director's office with its view over the Potomac, he / 
left a permanent mark not only on the Agency which he had 
fashioned but on its building which he had planned. , 
Allen Dulles was famous among many and notorious among 
some for his consummate skill as an intelligence operative 
("spook" in current parlance), but one of his greatest contribu-
tions in nurturing the frail arrangements he helped to create to 
provide intelligence support to 'Washington's top-level foreign-
policy-makers. 
Harry Truman, whose Administration gave birth to both the 
National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency, 
recalls that, "Each time the National Security Council is about 
.to consider a certain policy?let us say a policy having to do 
with Southeast Asia?it immediately calls upon the CIA to 
present an estimate of the effects such a policy is likely to 
have. . . .1 President Truman painted a somewhat more cozy 
relationship between the NSC and the CIA than probably 
existed during, and certainly since, his Administration. None 
the less it is fair to say that the intelligence community, and espe-
cially the CIA, played an important advisory role in high-level 
policy deliberations during the I9505 and early 196os. 
To provide the most informed intelligence judgments on the 
effects a contemplated policy might have on American na-
tional security interests, a group especially tailored for the task 
was organized in 1950 within the CIA. While this step would 
probably have been taken sooner or later, the communist victory

In late November the Central Intel-
ligence Agency conducted a series of 
"senior seminars:: so that some of its 
Important bureaucrats could consider 
its public image. I was invited to 
attend one session and to give my 
views on the proper role of the 
Agency. I suggested that its legitimate 
activities were limited to studying 
newspapers and published statistics, 
?listening to the radio, thinking about 
the world, interpreting data of recon-
naissance satellites, and occasionally 
* publishing the names of foreign spies. I 
had been led by conversations with a 
number of CIA officials to believe that 
they were thinking along the same 
lines. One CIA man after' another 
eagerly joined the discussion to assure 
me that the days of the flamboyant 
covert operations :were over. The 
upper-class amateurs of the OSS who 
stayed to mastermind operations in 
\iGuatemala, Iran, the Congo, and else-
where?Allen Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, 
Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes, Robert 
Amory, Desmond Fitzgerald?had died 
or departed. . 
In their place, I was assured, was a 
small army of professionals devoted to 
preparing intelligence "estimates" for 
the President and collecting informa-
tion the clean, modern way, mostly 
with sensors, computers, and sophis-
ticated reconnaissance devices. Even 
Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot, would now 
be as much a museum piece as Mata 
-Hari. (There are about 18,000 em-
ployees in the CIA and 200,000 in the 
entire "intelligence community" itself. 
The cost of maintaining them is some-
where between $5 billion and S6 
billion annually. The employment 
figures do not include foreign agents or 
mercenaries, such as the CIA's 100,000-
man hired army in Laos.) 
A week after my visit to the "senior 
?inse inar" Newsweek ran a long story 
n "the new espionage" with a picture 
of CIA Director Richard Helms on the 
cover. The reporters clearly had spoken 
to some of the same people I had. As 
Newsweek said,:64f Th

spy business; the bureaucratic age of 
Richard C. Helms and his gray spe-

an uneasy feeling that Newsweek's 
article was a cover story in more than 
one sense.

difficult 
has always been to fele

false advertising about themselves. Part of

The world of Richard Helms and his beet 
"specialists" does indeed differ .from ized 
that of Allen Dulles. Intelligence organ- Hell 
izations, in spite of their predilection 
for what English judges used to call 
"frolics of their own," are servants of 
policy. When policy changes, they 
must eventually change too, although 
because of the atmosphere of secrecy 
and deception in Which they operate, 
such changes are exceptionally hard to 
control. To understand the "new

the Nixon Doctrine which, in.essence, rri 
is a global strategy for maintaining US lh 
power and influence without overtly reo:

VIENTIANE, Dec. 21?
Communist forces have re-
captured the Plain of Jars 
in northern Laos two 
months earlier than in the 
-last dry season, raising 
doubts here that govern-
pent forces will be able to 
retain a toehold to retake 
the strategic area next year. 
Some CIA sources suggest 
that with the added time 
.gained from the early capture 
of the plain yesterday, the 
North Vietnamese and Pathet 
Lao forces may move south-
west toward Long Cheng, 
headquarters of the CIA and 
Moo tribesmen, less than 30 
miles from the plain's south-
ern edge. 
? [Wire services reported to-
day that Long Cheng was at-
tacked early today by 20 Com-
munist commandos who dam-
aged three aircraft and killed 
three Laotians.] 
All U.S. government sources 
here indicated that Gen. yang 
Pao, commander of progovern-
ment irregular forces on the 
plain, had intended to main-
tain control of the plain 
through the 1071-72 dry season 
to relieve pressure on Long 
Cheng. 
CIA-supported Meo and Thai' 
irregular forces abandoned 
the government's remaining 
fire support bases on the west-
ern edge of the plain yester-
day retreating under intense 
enemy artillery fire off the 
plain itself. 
The 30-square-mile Plain of 
Jars is about 100 miles north 
of Vientiane. This is the 
fourth time it has changed 
hands in the last 21,i years, 
with government forces gain.

and relinquishing it in the dry 
season to the Communists. 
Two firebases covering the 
plain, Sting Ray to the west 
and Cobra to the south, are re-
ported to be under heavy artil-
lery attack with little chance 
they can be held, sources say. 
Laotian Defense Minster 
Sisouk Charnpassak put Com-
munist losses during the first 
two days of fighting at 1,500 
dead out of a reported 13,000 
attacking. He said the govern-
ment had from 6,000 to 7,000 
troops on the plain during the 
attack. Government losses 
were described as heavy. 
Though Communist infan-
trymen "paid the price of tak-
ing the plain," they apparently 
consider the prize worth the 
'price, U.S. sources said. 
The prize itself may only be 
the psychological effect on 
government and progovern-
ment troops of suffering a 
major setback early and 
quickly, or this year it may be 
control of all the mountain re-
gion, sources here believe, in-
eluding Long Cheng itself, 
leaving the governrnent no-
toehold to mount an offen-
sive during the next wet sea-
son. 
Air cover for retreating 
troops and remaining posi-
tions in the west is minimal 
because of weather. Sources 
say bombing is impossible on 
the eastern half of the plain as 
Communist trucks ferry men 
and equipment southward 
under an umbrella of intense 
antiaircraft fire described as 
the heaviest ever in northern 
Laos. 
Yesterday Defense Minister 
Sisouk reported the loss of 
two Laotian bombers to 
enemy ground fire, including 
the loss of their pilots. Sisouk 
also noted the presence of 
North Vietnamese Mig fight-
ers slightly north and north-
east of the plain, a presence 
U.S. sources here confirm and 
say appears part of the Com-
munist strategy of keeping 
U.S. air support minimal. 
About 20 U.S.-supplied how-
itzers are believed to have 
been lost to enemy action on 
the plain with only the howitz-
ers at Cobra and Sting Ray 
now remaining in action. Thai 
gunners are reported to have 
spiked their weapons with

them inoperable when aban-

firebase over the weekend,

many of the military men. The 
FSOs tended to be older and less

thought processes were more subtle 
and less striking than those of the 
GIs. Some FSOs were essentially 
untouched by the whole experience, 
reacting no differently than if they 
had been in Paris or Rome. But for 
most, and especially the young, Viet-

violent breaking away from the tra-

posure to the realities of war.

The Mall From Ann Arbol.... 
There is a laugh-provoking scene in the movie "Taking 
Off" in which a club of white middle-class parents Of run-
away children take a lesson in pot smoking to help them 
"relate" to their children.' . . 
? The question arises, though the lesson is in a good 'cause, about 
the 'penalty for such a mass smoke-in if there was an arrest. Their 
young teacher raises his eyebrows and replies, " A man in Michigan 
was sentenced to prison for 10 years for having two joints." 
No joke, the man is John Sinclair and getting him released has 
become a major cause for his wife, friends and others who believe 
his .sentence in 1969 represents a prime example of unjust laws. 
His wife, Leni, has been commuting between New York and 'her 
home in Ann Arbor, -Mich., working with some prominent but still 
unrevealed names to organize a.benefit concert for her husband in 
December. An appeal to reverse his conviction is currently Ptaf.ore 
the Michigan Supreme Court. 
While Sinclair may not have the pop prominence of Berry Gordy, 
he Carries his own special clout in the field of Detroit music. Through 
his - organization and management, the hard-driving rock quintet. 
called MC-5 came to national prominence. In a new Look, "Music 
and Politics," Sinclair speaks of the MC-5 and lggy and the Stooges, 
another group whose music has the subtlety of an auto shassis 
stamping machine, as examples'. of "high energy level music," the 
important function of which is to "reflect and shape the purest and 
highest stages of people's consciousness, i.e., revolutionary conscious-

TillnIC called Trans-Love Energies in an 1.8-room house in ;-.1111 
near the Liniversity of Michigan campus, with its doors open to any-
one and his preachment of "revolution" through music. 
.Pre-Sinclair_people say he has clone nothing except smoke grass 
and irritate the establishment through his life style.-
The. situation brings to mind other notable examples of pot 
users who were caught. Stripper, Candy Barr got 15 years in Texas 
in 1.958 for possession of one joint and a quantity of loose grass 
stashed in her bra. She was released after three years.--Gene Krupa 
reri.cd three months in 1643 for sending his teenage valet to pick 
'DP:ft pack of reefers from his hotel room. Krupa still is 1-)P4ing 
his 'dues by lecturing high school students on the dangers of drugs. 
In perspective, such -furor over smoking pot seems extravagant, 
but Robert Apablaza just beat a 50-year sentence for holding a 
matchbox full of marijuana by escaping from the .Louisiana jail 
where he was held and fleeing to New York. The governor of New 
York persuaded the governor of Louisiana to drop extradition pro-
., 
ceedings. 
The strain of Leni's efforts to :get her husband released shows 
in her face and .voice but she doesn't show: vindictiveness; 'even 
when telling how her husband was arrested by the tame under-
cover agent who had an-ested him in 1960. "De used the name 
Louie," she said, "and he had a 'girl friend' who was an undercover 
a`gent too named Pat. Our doors were pretty much open. He had long 
hair after having hall short hair and we ,didn't recognize him. We 
had a communal dinner every Sunday afternoon and Louie and Pat

really nice." -

ts'el agency and to assure u?

C-stnA:l. A :kuck, 
President Nixon has issued an e.xecutive order which antics again. This week he is the "cover boy" on News-
invests Richard Helms, director of the CIA, with author- week, ,with the predictable feature telling of gallant CIA 
ity .to oversee all the intelligence agencies (the National capers, of a kind that could have been made known only 
SecuritY Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, etc.). by the agency that is so super-secret it feels compelled to 
and to Cut "bureaucratic fat" and professional overlapping conceal its activities from the Congress: 
wherever possible. There may be merit in this new or, 
but there is incontdtable merit in Sen. Stuart Symington's 
reaction to it. The Senator notes that the CIA was 
.brought into existence in 1947 by an act of Congress. Its 
nowers.and duties are defined by legislation adopted by 
the Congress. The director and deputy direcZot are sub-
ject to confirmation by the Senate. Last year the Congress 
appropriated between $5 billion and $6 billion -for the 
intelligence establishment; no one knows the exact 
amount, since, part of the CIA's budget is artfully con-
cealed. Yet the Senate was not consulted about the pro-
posed. reorganization. Senator Symington serves on the 
,CIA subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee. To his knowledge, the subcommittee was not, 
.cOnsulted about, nor did it approve, the reorganization 
ordered by the President. As a matter of fact the sub-
coMmittee has nOt met once during.the current year. This 
is an amazing state of affairs. Surely the Congress has a 
right tO be consulted about the reorganization of an agency 
which owes its existence to an Act . of Congress and is 
sustained by annual appropriations voted by the Congress. 
The fact is that the-CIA enjoys an autonomy almost as 
complete as that enjoyed by the FBI. Whatever the orig-
inal intention of the Congress, the. CIA functions today as 
. an adjunct of the White House. The intelligence it gathers 
is available to the President; it is not available to the Con-
gress. Under the proposed reorganization, it will be even 
more directly respOnsible to the President, and by its over-
sight control over the other. agencies will be- supplying him 
with a unified appraisal. An agency that gathers informa-
tion for the President may be tempted to provide him with 
the estimates it thinks he wants (as the Pentagon Papers 
,have shown, intelligence reports that do not coincide with 
White House opinion are apt to be ignOred), and as Joseph 
Kraft pointed out in a recent column, there is much to 
be said for diverging, even conflicting, _reports in the 
highly subjective area of intelligence evaluation. 
The CIA is closed off from scrutiny by the press, public 
and the Congress; like the FBI, it functions in splendid 
bureaucratic isolation. Mr. Helms is .such a gray eminence 
that a private elevator takes him to and from his office in 
the .CIA structure in Langley, Va. Like Mr. Hoover, he.. 
is usually not "available," except at budget time. Re-
cently, however, he has been trying to give the agency a 
new, or at least a brighter image, since he is well aware 
of a growing restiveness in the ,Congress and of the need 
to slash budgets. ,A Nation. editorial of May 3 called at-
tention to the way in which Mr. Helms was "breaking 
covet" to- talk about the brilliant achievements 'of the. 
Congress should not take any more of this guff from 
the agency or its director. It has authority to insist that 
its authority be respected and it has a clear responsibility 
to act in that spirit. In an editorial last August 2, we re-
marked on a measure, introduced by Sen. John Sherman 
Cooper, which would recuire the CIA to make its intel-
ligence reports available to the chairman of the germane 
committees of the .Congress (Armed Services and For-
eign Relations) and also require the agency to 'prepare 
reports at the request of the Congress. There is precedent 
for suCh legislation in the instructions given the AEC. 
After all, the CIA often gives to foreign governments 
information-and reports 'which it will not make available 
to the Senate or. the House. This is selective secrecy 
carried to a grotesque extreme. 
Hearings will be held on Senator Cooper's bill- (S. 2224) 
during the first week of February. It is a wise and sensible 
proposal. We hope it is adopted. We hope. too that the 
CIA subcommittee will come alive and begin to exercise, 
a real degree of oversight over thc agency. Better still, 
the Senate should adopt the resolution offered by Sena-
tor Symington (S. 192, November 13) to create a. select 
committee which would oversee the -CIA. But there is 
really only one way to deal with the problem of the CIA 
and that is to make it direaly responsible to the Congress. 
If it is engaged in activities of such a character that they 
cannot be reported to the Congress, then it should be 
told to abandon those activities. There is no place for a 
secret agency of the CIA type within the framework of a 
constitutional democracy, which is how Justice Stanley 
Reed once characterized our form of government. As 
long as the CIA can plead, secrecy,' Congress will be un.-
able to exercise effective oversight. The time has come, 
to make both the FBI and the CIA subject to close and 
continuing Congressional supervision and control.

OPERATION GINO 
NEWSCASTER; Speaking of curtains, syndicated columnist Jack Anderson 
reports how the CIA's security curtain was breached by a group of little boys. 
JACK ANDERSON; The legendary security_of the Central Intelligence 
Agency has been penetrated by a secret spy mission called Operation Gino. 
Here is the hush-hush story. The CIA enclave is enclosed by cyclone 
fencing and protected by electronic detection devices. Guards swarm all over 
the place. The only way tp get inside is through the main gate which is care-
fully watched by the security men. But four schoolboys, led by li-year old 
Stewart Andrews of McLean, Virginia found a series of manholes in an old 
federal road testing facility near the CIA. They got the covers off and ex-
plored the underground tunnels. Their subterranean travels took them past the 
great security wall and up into secret CIA territory. 
They went back day after day, telling their parents mysteriously, 
they were engaged in Operation Gino. 
But the manhole covers were overgrown with greenery and the boys 
soon broke out in a familiar rash. The rash led to more probing questions from 
their parents. Thus was Operation Gino foiled by a case of poison ivy. 
The 'CIA deals in operations so secret that its waste paper is 
classified. Yet it receives more publicity than government agencies that ad-
vertise. So, understandably, the CIA isn't saying anything about the school-
boys who infiltrated their headquarters. 
But maybe the CIA security wasn't so bad after all. Perhaps the 
poison ivy was a CIA plant. 
This is Jack Anderson in Washington.

" Behind the scenes Presidant Nixon's confidence 
in Central Intelligence Agency Director Richard 
M. Helms has .taken a new leap forward. Mr. Nix-
On believes (correctly) that our nation's in-
telligence setup is a sick elephant. He has quietly 
assigned Mr. Helms to correct its 
? 
. . 
A -sick sleplmat is a formidable danger. And 
secrecy keeps our public from knowing even the 
.size - of this elephant, to say nothing of how sick 
:it is? . . 
. , . . 
? 
. - a ? . 
- 
Inceedibly, we spend close to $6 billion a year. 
for intelligence. Just the CIA alone is larger in 
scope than the State Department and spends more 
vthan twice as much money. Legendary Gen. 
William J. ("Wild. Bill") Donovan's Office of 
Strategic Services conducted obi* entire World 
War II espionage throughout four years and 
throughout the world for, a total $135 million. The 
budget of the CIA (secret) is at least .$1.5 billion 
a year. 
NEXT TO THE PENTAGON. with its 25 miles 
of corridors, the world's largest office building, 
the CIA's headquarters in suburban Langley, Va., ? 
" is the largest building in the Washington area. The 
CIA has jurisdiction only abrLd, not in the United ? 
/ States. But the CIA maintains secret offices in 
/  
most major U.S. cities, totally unknown to the 
public. . 
? 
About 10,000. .people work at Langley and 
another 5,000 are scattered across the world, bur-
rowing everywhere for intelligence. These include 
many, many unsung heroes who secretly risk their 
lives for our country in the dark and unknown 
, battles of espionage and treachery. I could name 
many. And as a p'art of its veil of secrecy the CIA 
has its .own clandestine communications system 
with Washington and the world.. ? 
?? The -Pentagon spends $3 billion a year on in-
telligence, twice as much as the CIA. Like the 
CIA, its Army, Navy, and Air Force intelligence 
; arms . operate worldwide, of course, ? and --
"largely unknown ? they also have an immense 
adjunct called the National Security Agency which 
I rivals the. CIA in size and cost. 
' ? Then there -exists the 'important Intelligence' 
Section of the State Department, likewise world-
wide. Its chid reports directly to Under Secretary 
of State John N. Irwin 2nd it is tuiderstandably 
very close to its vest. 
ADDITIONAL Intelligence agencies ? all; 
growing, all sprawling, all costly " spread out hi--
to the world from the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission, National 
Aeronautics es Space .Administration (NASA) , and 
even the Department of Commerce. 
In fact, there are so many additional hush-hush 
agencies that recently in West and East Berlin 
alone there Were at least 40 known U.S. in-
telligEnce agencies and their branches ? most of 
them competing with one another. - 
Mr. Helms himself defines intelligence as "all 
the things which should be known in- advance or 
initiating a course of action." The acquisition of 
intelligence is one thing; the interpretation of it is 
another; and the use of it is a third. The 19171 
statute creating the CIA limits it to the first two. It 
also makes the CIA directly responsible to the 
President. But it is simply not true that the OA 
is the .over-all responsible agency, as is so widelY 
believed. ? " ? 
Again and again, no one and everyone is 
responsible, 
. . 
" THE FUNCTION of intelligence is to protect us 
from surprises. It's not working that way. The sick 
elephant is -threatening our national security by' 
surPrise, Surprise, surprise. 
? 
- Alarmed President Nixon has given Mr. Helms . 
new ? and sweeping intelligence reorganization 
authority on an over-all"basis. He has given him 
the first authority ever given anyone to ra.aiew,'", 
and thus effect, all our foreign intelligence' 
agencies' budgets. The President believes Mr. 
Helms, this undercover world's most experienced 
pro, can cut at least SI. billion out of the morass: 
:'The President confided that he is totally fed tiP': 
With the intelligence community's duplications.; ? 
contradictions, self-protective vagueness and 
dangerous rivalries. He has made it clear that he - 
'wants its output brount closer to the. needs of thd. 
President's so-called 40 Committee (actually six,. 
men), which serves the National Security Council, 
and the President hiinself. ? . . , 
In .amputating much of the sick elephant, Mr; 
Helms' directive is to cut down on the surprises. 
And the President could not have picked a more . 
knowing, no-nonsense man to do it.

7?An "FBI Conference" 
opened here today with the 55 
participants painting a grim 
picture of a, police state disre-
garding constitutional liber-
ties and repressing political 
dissent by use of informers, 
wiretaps, electronic surveil-
lance and agents provocateurs, 
The FBI, charging . it was 
cast as the "defendant" and 
,found guilty before the fact, 
has declined to participate. 
-. Legal scholars,' political sci-
entists, journalists and former 
justice Department personnel, 
-FBI agents and informants 
spoke of increasingly uncon-
trolled power of the FBI, espe-
cially in its attempts to moni-
tor. groups which seek social; 
. economic 'and political change. 
: While most of the partici-
Opals did not question the 
FBI's ability to combat certain 
types of crime, many ex-
pressed their dissatisfaction 
with the bureau's efforts to 
fight organized crime, protect 
civil rights workers, infiltrate 
protest groups and promote 
the .FBI's image as a vigilant 
and incorruptable investiga-
tive agency, 
- William Turner, a former 
IFBI agent asked to resign in 
3951, charged that be knew of 
several instances in which FBI 
'agents had forged checks, sto-
len property, been involved in 
drunken driving accidents and 
otherwise acted outside the 
law. Turner said that none of 
these agents was charged be-
cause it it sureau policy to 
persuade local law enforce-
ment officials to drop charges. 
Turner said that the MU 
'?,..,,as been so unsuccessful. in its 
ttempts to- uncover foreign. 
,-, 
f;spionage agents working in 
the United States that the CIA. 
Illias been forced to set up its 
own bureaus around the cowl-
try. 
... Vrof, Thomas J. .Emerson of 
-Yale be W school, charged that 
the FBI regularly violates the 
First and Fourth amendments 
Tr e 
(4:-."..:t1)..1..iti.6 
y4.17 .1,7.-,./0-?b; re 
of the constitution. Emerson' ended, or only that concerned 
said that wiretaps, bugging 
and the use of informers tend 
to lirnit freedom of speech and 
violate the Fourth Amend-
ment's protection from illegal 
searches and seizures. 
Emerson said that the FM's 
"political warfare against dis-
sident groups raises the 
spectre of a police state." The 
Yale law professor said the 
only remedy for current FBI 
practice is the creation of a 
public board of overseers and 
an ombudsman, to protect the 
public from arbitrary FBI 
practices, such as the inclu-
sion of persons' names in 
practices, suchn s the inclu-
sion of persons' names nip. 
FBI dossiers. 
Prof. Frank Donner, also of 
Yale law school, said political. 
with political, dissent, There 
was a strong- feeling, ox-
pressed by John Boar, for-
mer assistant attorney general 
for civil rights awing the 
Kennedy admiii)istrrltion, that 
the use of informants was 
necessary in protecting civil, 
rights workers and combatting. 
organized crime. ? 
The use of wiretaps and elec..' 
tronic surveillance was the sub-
ject of an other paper, pre.: 
pared by Victor N;-ivalky, au-
thor of . "Kennedy justice," 
and Nathan Lewin, f' -Washing- ' 
ton attorney. 
Navashy charged that there 
has been "a hiStory of deceit, 
ambivalence and confusion 
v,,ithin the government con-
cerning bugs and taps." he 
said the. use of "suicide 
taps," illegal- wiretaps by FBI 
informers used by the FBI are agents to obtain informattion 
"intended as a restraint on 
free expression, as a curb on 
movements far change," 
"It can hardly be denied 
that the self censorship which 
it (surveillance by informers) 
stimulates is far more damag-
ing than many c.xppressed sta-
tutory or administrative re-
straints." 
Former FBI agent robert 
Wall supported. Donner's 
charges. Wall said be resigned 
from the Washington bureau 
hi 1970 because he became, dis-
gusted by the FBI's surveil-
lance activities.. "Anyone who 
would say something against 
the Vietnam war had to be 
watched and watched closely:. 
The chilling effect was very 
real," he said. 
Donner concluded that 
"thoughful Arnerleans must 
begin to ask themselves 
whether 'national security' 
really requires that .we cor-
rupt and bribe our youths, 
blacks, professors, students 
and others_ to betray friends 
and associates; whether there 
is no other way to defend 
ourselves. . . than to institu-
tionalize the surveillance of 
non-violent protest activity." 
The participants in the con-
ference questioned whether 
all surveillance should be 
without authorization from ei-
ther the courts. or FBI Direc-
tor j. Edgar Hoover, was wide 
spread.. 
The FBI Conference, Spon-
sored by. Princeton's Woodrow 
Wilson School and the Corn- . 
mittee for Public Justice, Will 
end Saturday.

- A Six-member jury in U.S. 
District Court here yesterday 
awarded the Airlie Foundation 
and its executive director, Dr. 
Murdock Head, $510,800 in 
libel damages against The 
Evening Star. 
? The jury, 'which deliberated 
early yesterday afternoon, 
? awarded .$100,000 in damages 
to Dr. Head and 8419,000 to 
the foundation, which oper-
ates a large conference center 
called Airlie House in Warren-
ton, Va. 
The case involved The Star's 
;news coverage in September, 
11967, of a news conference in 
which it was alleged that the 
foundation was secretly sup-
ported by the Central Intelli'-
gence Agency or other govern-
Ment agencies. 
A few days later, The Star 
,ran a ."Statement on Airlie" 
that said, in part, "The editors 
of The Star ,having examined 
the records of the Airlie Foun-
dation, are persuaded that this 
institution is privately fi-? 
nanccd." . 
The judgement was one of 
the, largest libel verdicts ren-
dered by a jury in recent 
Years, according to Washing-
ton lawyers. .

The Airlie Foundation and its 
director, Dr. Murdock Head, 
yesterday won $519,800 in libel 
;damages against .The Wash-
ington Star. 
The verdict by a six-member 
U.S. -District Court jury hero 
called for an award of com-
pensatory damages of $160,000 
for Head and $419,800 for the 
foundation which runs a con-
ference center in Warrenton, 
Va. No punitive damages were 
awarded. 
U.S. District Court judge Oliv-
er Gasch, wno presided over the 
six-day trial which ended Tues-
day, gave The Star 10 days to 
file motions asking him to over-
turn the jury verdict, a standard 
procedure in civil cases. 
Conference Center 
Mi-lie House, which is operat-
ed by the Airlie Foundation, is a 
1,200-acre conference center lo-
cated just east of Warrenton in 
Fauquier County, Va. It has 
been the scone of hundreds of 
conferences sponsored by public 
and private groups. 
As developed in testimony at 
the trial, the case grew out of a 
Sept. 14, 1967, story in The Star 
reporting a charge by William 
Higgs that Airlie House was se-
cretly supported by the Central 
Intelligence Agency, the State 
Department and the Pentagon. 
It Was ;testified that Higgs, a 
lawyer disbarred in Mississippi 
who has been a civil rights ac-
tivist ?and a supporter of radical 
causes, made the charge at a 
press conference at which he is-
sued a 1.6-page statement which 
he said supported the charge of 
covert ties between Mille House 
and the governmental agencies.

was without foundation. And on

MONTE CART,O, Monaco ? The 
Spindrift Of the cold war is the human 
,spray blown .hither and thither by 
ideological gusts. This is typified by 
-dissidents who flee Communist lands 
in seal-eh of freedom, by draft dodgers 
seeking to escape the U.S. armed 
forges abroad, by American black rev-
olutionists in foreign havens and by 
defectors from rival diplomatic or

?ferent reasons abandon their native 
;lands. 
? One of the most puzzling of these 
instances is that of Jozel Szall, Hun-
gary's senior career ambassador and 
most recently special adviser to his 
Foreign Minister. Szall fled Budapest 
last ,year, spent a considerable time 
ander interrogation by Italian secu-

had long been envoy, and early this 
year was flown to the United States 
by the Central Intelligence Agency

visited Washington theaters and mu-

to facilitate the Szalls' permanent ad-

this group of tiny islands has, in the last 100 years, been 
occiipied by a succession of colonial powers Spain, Ger-
many .and later Japan; after World War 11 another ex-
panding empire, the United States, stepped into the void 
left by the defeated Japanese. All but oblivious. to the 
existence of Micronesia, many Americans will recognize 
the 'names of specific islands within the group. World

Pacific Defense System, 
Micronesia became an American "protectorate" in 
1947, under a unique arrangement of the United Nations 
Trusteeship Council which invested the United States with 
full responsibility for the islands' economic, social and 
political development, full -authority over their internal 
affairs, and permission to build military installations, con-
duct nuclear explosions, and generally use them as a 
buffer ?against powers in the Far East which long ago 
ceased to be hostile. Technically, the arrangement was ? 
provisional, it 'being assumed that eventually the Micro-
nesians would be "ready for self-government." Their 
murky political statys. as a U.S. -"trust"' was upde.ilined. 
when Washington, anxious to avoid a colonial blemish,' 
handed the job of administering the territory over to the 
Department of the Interior?which, for its part, followed 
a policy of "benign neglect" reminiscent of the behavior 
of its Bureau of Indian Affairs. Before 1964, the trustee-
ship proceeded on. a shoestring budget that never exceeded 
.$77 million, half of which went to pay the salaries of 
Interior Department personnel. The Defense Department's 
Micronesia budget for nuclear tests alone exceeded the 
combined State Department and Interior DepartMent 
budgets by more than $1 million; not surprisingly, the 
DOD wound up making most of the important administra-
tive decisions?includinq the forced evacuation of resi-

laminated most of their food supply. "Social and economic 
development" iemained almost moribund as the territorial 
administration, fearful ,of "outside. influences" that might 
undermine U.Si.control, enforced a near-total quarantine 
on foreign trade. At least one Micronesian died and many 
others were .disabled by live bombs which the United 
States never bothered to remove after World War II. 
By 1964 this blatant mismanagement succeedied ? in 
provoking a Trusteeship Council investigation, the up-
shot of which was a resolve by the investigators to come 
back again in three years to determine what changes, if 
'an)', had been made. The prospect that the United States 
might be stripped of its trusteeship if conditions On the 
islands did not significantly improve could not be taken 
lightly, particularly because of secondary effects stemming 
from recent escalation of the war in Vietnam. The 
Japanese leftists had responded to that development by 
stepping up their attacks ? on the Japanese-American 
Mutual Security Pact, which in 1960 had been extended 
for ten years. Fearing that the pact might not survive 
beyond 1970, United States policy makers were even 
more apprehensive lest sizable U.S. investments inside 
Japan be threatened. by rising political instability there. 
To appease the Japanese, Washington began giving serious 
consideration to the idea of abandoning its base on 
Okinawa, itself the scene of growing anti-American dem-
onstrations. What was needed was a site of comparable 
strategic value to which .the Okinawa operation could be 
transferred. Thailand and South Korea' were too close 
to enemy territory; the political situation in the Philippines 
was already too volatile Micronesia was another story. 
Not only was it out of reach of Chinese and Soviet. medi-
um-range missiles; but if the United States could maintain 
the kind of control over the islands' internal affairs that it 
had Once enjoyed, the political results of operating a mili-
tary outpost there ? could be held to a. minimum. 
-The impending U.N. investigation posed an immediate 
and irritating stumbling block to these designs. President 
Johnson and. his advisers were well aware of the need 
to engage in some housecleaning in Micronesia before 
the investigators arrived; at the same time, they knew that 
if the Micronesian people could be prevailed upon to . 
enter into a voluntary association with the United States, 
all U.N. authority in the matter would end. In 1966, 
without waiting for the customary invitation from the host 
nation,' Mr. Johnson dispatched a contingent of Peace 
Corps volunteers to .the islands, hoping simultaneously 
to mollify the U.N. and to persuade the natives that a 
permanent "free association" with the United States really 
was in their best interests. Most of the volunteers promptly 
busied themselves with land management, teaching 
(usually English or American history) and "community 
development." ? r. ? .

Spies: [-cot 
. OUTSIDE London's Marlborough 
Street magistrates' court one morn-
ing last week, a throng of newsmen wait-
eel impatiently. The object of their in-
terest, an ostensibly minor Soviet trade 
official named Oleg Lyalin, 34, failed 
to show up to answer the charges against 
him--"driving . while unfit through.. 
drink." He was resting instead in ,a Com-
fortable country house near London:. 
where, for the past several weeks, he.. 
had been giving British intelligence a 
complete rundown on local? Soviet es-
pionage operations. His,, -.revelations 
prompted the British government two" 
weeks ago. to carry out the most 'dras-
tic action ever undertaken in the West 
against Soviet spies: the expulsion of 
105 diplomats and other officials?near-
ly 20% of the 550 Russian officials 
based in Britain. 
The case generated waves from Mos-
cow to Manhattan. As soon as Soviet 
Party Leader Leonid Brezhnev returned 
to the Soviet, capital from his three-
day visit. to Yugoslavia, he took the ex-
traordinary step of convening an emer-
gency meeting of the 15-man Politburo 
right on the premises of Vniikovo Air-
port. The, high-level conference, vLich

Is the CIA .taring to spy on Americans at home?turning talents and mo.

a wide ranging criticism. A direct response starts on page 81. 
STATINTL 
? The following was Nvritten by Edward K. DeLong of 
United Preis .International, hosed on an interview with 
a Centro! Intelligence Agency official who has re-
signed. The dispatch was distributed by UPI for pub-
lication oh October 3. ' ? 
Victor Marchetti embarked 16 years ago on a career that 
was all any aspiring young spy could ask. But two years ago, 
after reaching the highest levels of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, he became. disenchanted with what he perceived to . 
be amorality, overwhelming military influence, waste and 
duplicity in the spy business. IIe quit. ? 
-- Fearing today that the CIA may already have begun "go-
ing against the enemy within" the United States as they 
may conceive it?that is, dissident student groups and civil-
rights organizations?Marchetti has launched a campaign for 
thore.- presidential and congressional control over the entire 
U. S. intelligence community. ? 
-"I think we need to do this because we're getting into 
an awfully dangerous era when we have all this talent 
(for clandestine operations) in the CIA?and more being de-
veloped in the military, which is getting into clandestine 
"ops" (operations)?and there just aren't that many places 
any more to display that talent," Marchetti says. 
"The cold war is fading. So is the war in Southeast Asia, 
. except for Laos. At the sanie time, we're getting a lot of 
domestic problems. And there are people in the CIA who?
,'if they .aren't right now actually already running domestic 
operations against student groups, black movements and the 
like?are certainly considering it. 
"This is going to *get to be ? very.. tempting," Marchetti 
said in a recent. interview at his comfortable riorne in Oak-
' - ton, [Val, a 'Washington suburb where many CIA men live. - 
"There'll be a great temptation for these people- to sug-
gest operations. and for a President to approve them or to 
kind of look the other way. You have the danger of intelli-
gence turning against the nation itself, going against the 'the 
enemy within.' 
Marertetti speaks of the CIA from an insi'cler's point of 
-View. At Pennsylvania State University he deliberately pre-
pared himself fkrenan intelliLT4co Caj:cerg _gladUakoli t ab

Through a professor secretly on the CIA payroll as a_ talent 
?seout, Marchetti netted the prize all would-be spies dream 
of-1-an immediate job offer from the CIA. The offer came 
during a secret meeting in a hotel room, set up by a stranger 
who telephoned and identified himself only as "a friend of 
your brother." ? 
Marchetti spent one year as a CIA agent in the field and 
10 more as an analyst of intelligence relating 'to the Soviet 
Union, rising through the ranks until he was helping pre-
pare the national intelligence estimates for the White House. 
During this period, Mar-
chetti says, "I was a hawk. 
I believed in what we 
were doing." 
Then he was promoted 
to the executive stab.' of 
the CIA, moving to an of:

programs and budgeting, 
as special assistant to. the 
CIA's executive director, 
and as executive assistant 
to the Agency's deputy 
director, V. Adm. Rufus 
L. Taylor. 
"This put me in a very 
rare position within the Agency and within the intelligence 
community in general, in that I was in a place where it was 
being all pulled together," Marchetti said. 
"I could see how intelligence analysis was done and how it ? 
fitted into the scheme of clandestine operations. It also gave 
me an opportunity to. get a good view of the intelligence 
community, too: the National Security Agency, the DIA.

- If you wonder 'what has happened to cur chi-
seas' privacy, listen to a summary I have just 
conipleted. Incredible? One would have thought 
so. Impossible? One. would have hoped so. Un-
fortunately, it is. the squalid truth. Here are the 
ugly facts: ? 
More than 2,600 computers are now \ varking 
away ? clank, clank, clank -- in, Wa.F.?,11:ngion.. 
They have a -full-time potential of supplyiug a 
stack of records 2,000 miles high 'every year. 
About 2:50,000 -- yes, 220,000 government em-
ployes are chiefly involved with filing the paper 
into cabinets. These cabinets cover 25 million 
cubic. feet of . floor space. That's more than 11 
times the entire rentable floor space In the vast 
102-story Empir?f State Building; -- only for the 
filing cabinets. The exectitive branch alone has 
two million. ? 
. Yet the government is now installing addi-
tional data-processing eon-Tutus at the astound-
ing rate of 000 .a year --- \:.51.11 an emphasis on 
piling up information about our citizens. 
"PRIVACY," SAID late, great Prof. Clinton. 
Rossiter, "is an ? unbreakable wall . of dignity 
against the entire world.". But start with your la-
conic tax declaration ? probably the most pri-
vate, intimately revealing thing demanded of citi-
zens. Nearly SO million of us taxpaying peasants 
filed these with the Internal Revenue Service this 
year. The declarations started out to he inviolate. 
Today, largely unknown to the SO million, that 
essential privacy is a mere charade. 
Ifwenty4lirce federal agencies now have direct 
access to our citizens' income tax returns for an 
official total of 100 reasons. 
Do not hold the IRS responsible for this. It 
has -fought. intrusions tooth and nail. But outside 
agencies have contrived their intrusions to the 
IRS's utter dismay. . - ? - 
? NYITH THE 109 lIEASONS available to the 23. 
agencies, what an outrageous opening for scat-
tered bureaucratic insiders. And what an oppor-
tunity for crooks, pressure boys, spite artists in 
?%01.11: neighborhood, political oppeuents of men in 
public life; business rivals and. other.s who can 
quietly get your declaration by cozy relationships, 
bribery and other means ? . 
The last Census, which N still In the -data.; 
processing computers, was not a count of* our 
? population, as the Constitution demands. It was, 
instead, a systematic penetration of -our privacy,

undoubtedly useful but expanded nevertheless in 
accord with the over-all invasion ? this worm in 
the American apple. 
The Civil Service Commission,, on Inquiry, re-
plies that, yes, it now does compile "lead in-
formation relating to possible que,stions" that 
might come up about countless pecple. So does 
the Post Office Department. So does the Depart- . 
ment of the Interior. Ridiculously, even the ole. 
pi:anti:lc Interstate Commerce Commission,. to 
our country's shame, gets into this intrusion on 
such a scale that maybe the ICC should give .up 
its true ? finiCtion entirely and just go into the 
business of building libraries for 
THE .P.ENI?AGON ADMITS it has dossiers'on 
20. million Americans outside the armed forces. 
Its data bank also keeps files on 7,060 organiza-
tions, II you can conceli,o of that many.. In fact, 
the Pentagon admits that it processes an average 
1,200 requests a day for undisclosed information. 
The Justice Department lists 13,200 names.. of 
persons known to have. urged violence. And there 
are, of course, the vital files of its investigath?e 
.agency, the FBI. 
The Secret Service has compiled on its own 
a colossal file of what it tells me are "person's 
of interest." These include those whose only bid 
for Secret Service attention is their criticism of 
government policies. 
TILE Central Intelligence Agency's personal In-
formation files are top secret ? and tremendous. 
The CIA has jurisdiction only abroad, not in the 
United States. Neverthele.ss, the CIA maintains 
secret offices in a score Of U. S. Cities totally 
unknown to our public. ? 
Big Brother's intrusion into our American fife 
is not new, nor is its incredible undercover, un're-
vealed .expansion schemed and planned in the 
sense of a sinister design. Actually, it's a drift, 
like a spreading cancer is a ,drift. And, behiqc1 
the scenes today's electronic technological ad-
vances arc spreading the drift on a scale that 
should frighten our public out of its boots. 
'These advances allow Big Brother to acquire; 
store and use tremendous files of information 
Big Brother collects on us with a correlation, and 
? speed.which completely changes the potential for 
the invasion of privacy. And how Bag can this 
hidden pilcstitution of our intended government 
continue without wrecking every democratic coa-
cept in one democratic system?

Guam doctrine?the new ourse In Asia 
proclaimed by President Nixon. two 
years ago at the U.S. air -force base in 
'Guam. As put by Nixon himself, the 
Point of this doctrine Is that the United

and the responsibility for it to be as, 
liumed in ever greater degree by the 
Asian countries themselves. In the 
Opinion of.. many Asian public leaders 
avd publications the veiled meaning of 
this is that Washington wants to "pit 
Asians against Asians," that IS, to have 
:its war in Asia fought by others in the 
elfish Interests of the U.S. ?ruling 
-element. The tempestuous'eVents of the

'...sfoes- irremediable damalge to the decency of our civic 
IVO-low can it be stopped? One legal weapon against it, 
*hich,".can have important effect, is the refusal of the 
ArOurts to use or to receive' evidence in this un-
tavory-..v.,ay. Over the retention and strengthening of that 
--9;reapon legal battle now rages. 
_tome baagroUnd. first. The Fourth Amendment of 
the U.S.. Constitution IV's' it down that: 
. . 
Irhe right, of the people to be secure in their persons, 
tomes, papers,. and effects, against unreasonable searches 
-ari4 seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants 
? AO issue:, fait upon. probable cause, supported .by Oath 
aflirmation, and particularly describing the place to 
be?searched, and the persons or things to be seized. 
?-?? t 
_On this .basis it is along-standing principle of our courts 
that the government may not build its case against a 
.1fefendant in a criminal action upon evidence obtained 
.:by unconstitutional methods. Even where that evidence, 
Were:.it to be accepted, might clearly establish guilt, it 
Inust not be 'accepted, or even heard', because permitting 
any USC or, it is direct encouragement to law enforcers' 
to gather such evidence in future cases. In applying this 
Important exclusionary principle: to search by wire tap, 
'the U.S. Supreme Court also held in. 1969 (Alderman 
v, lAited States) that, the govanment .must disclose to 
a defendant any record of conversations he participated 
in, or which occurred on his pr-emises, which the govern-
merit 'acquired by means of any illegal electronic surveil-
lance. (The practical importance of this ruling appears. 
In the current Plamondon case, cited below.) 
?  
-ETA when electronic surveillance legal and when 
Th Omnibus Criro.e Control and Safe'Streeis Act 
-43f 194. far less restrictive in this regard than it ought 
to be, does lay down strict conditions within which elec-
(ronic. surveillance may be carried out. Probable cause to 
believe that criminal activity is in progress must be sworn 
to before surveillance is undertaken, and a duly constituted 
court or magiStrate must .authori-ae specific. surveillance 
and issue ? a warrant therefor. Unauthorized electronic 
surveillance .by government officials is a serious crime. 
But the ? Act also provides, unhappily, for exceptions to 
itS own restrictions. By its own -words the Act does not 
limit the constitutional power of the President to take 
such measures as, he deems necessary to protect the 
Nation against actual or potential attack or other' hostile 
acts of a foreign power, or to obtain foreign intelligence 
information deemed essential to the security of the, 
STATI NTL 
United States, or to protect national security informa-
tion against foreign intelligence activities. Nor shall . 
anything contained in this chapter be deemed to limit the 
constitutional power of the President to take such meas-
ures as he *deems necessary to Protect the United States 
against the overthrow Of the Government by force or 
other unlawful me'ans, or against any 'other clear and 
present danger to the strUCture or existence of the 
. Government... .. ? ? 
. Through this hole in' thcfl(dike the Attorney General 
of the United States and his subordinates have surged, 
and the' federal courts now face the difficult, problem of 
restraining the zeal of law enforcers eager to tap the wires 
of anyone who might, by their lights, be. deemed a threat. 
to "national security." The threat, more deeply under-
stood, is from the government--and the privacy of citizens 
is Its victim. 
? 
The tub lies here. Who decides what is necessary 
for ."national. security"? The. President, acting through 
the Attorney General, is authorized to conduct electronic 
surveillance without judicial Warrant to pfotect the nation 
against the hostile acts cif foreign powers. That is itself 
worrisome: But is the exception to be enlarged? Is wire 
tapping to be permitted, and itS results received by the 
courts, in matter of alleged internal seculity? . ? 
'The issue is not only. theoretical. A case now before 
the U.S. District Court, Eastern 'District of. 
presents thice' practical piohlem starkly. The defendants are 
charged' with conspiring to injure -government 'property,-
arid one of theme Lawrence "Pun".Plamondon, is charged 
with the actual bombing of a CIA office building in Ann. 
Arbor. The trial is about to begin. Electronic surveillance 
of Mr. Plamondon's- conversalion, has, been conducted. 
by the government, undertaken '''Ornittedly without the' 
judicial authorization that the law requires. The sealed 
logs of these wire taps have been delivered to the court, 
and with them an affidavit froM the Attorney General. 
This affidavit 'does not assert that'-at' the time these wire 
-taps were installed, law-enforcement ,tgepts had' probable 
cause to believe- that criminal activity was actually being 
.plotted. If such probable cause could haVe 'been shown 
?that, for example, the illegal overthrow of the govern-' 
ment by violence. was being planned?a .proper warrant 
Could surely have been .obtained:) The affidavit argiles, 
badly, that the Attorney General, as agent of the Presi-
dent,.May by himself -authorize electrOnic surveillance of; 
"attempts of domestic organizations to attack and subvert 
the existing structure of the. government." Therefore, he. 
concludes, 'wire tapping in this case, although without 
judicial warrant or control, is. yet legal. ? ? 
' It is to the enduring credit of the U.S. District Court,. 
in the petson of Judge Damon J. Keith, that this argument 
go'vernment has been flatly rejected. Keith's force-
? ful and distinguished opinion, handed down 'on January 
25, affirms the constitutional right of citizens to be protect-

leading only one life these days, lant it's a busy 
One. , 
.Remember 'Mr. Philbrick? His multifaceted 
existence in the 1940s?"Citizen,? Communist, 
Counterspy"?was the basis of an autobiogra-
phical book, Led Three Lives." in the early 
1050s, these reminiscences were ifiade into a 
wildly popular- television series, wherein Mr. 
Philbrick (as portrayed by actor Richard Carl-
son) spent the better part of a half-hour each 
week routing the Red tinchsruound in the U.S. 
As you may recall, Herb Philbrick (or, as 
? many viewers came, to know him, "Comrade 
%Hort%) actually did lead three lives. From 1940 
to 1949, he was. (1) a New England advertising 
e.61.itive Who (2) secretly v.'.orked his way into 
'important positions. in the Communist Party in 
order to .(3) -pass on party directives and other 
information to the FBI. This triple life ended 
abruptly in 1940 when .-Nfr. Philbrick's testi-
mony in federal court helped convict 11 top ex-
. 
ecutives of the. U.S. Communist Party. 
Such "accidents" have been ?so frequent; 
Today Herb Philbrick ? is fighting commu- Mr. Philbrick says, that he and his wife have 
? ntsm from headquarters in his modest, red* ,thought of writing a book on the subject. "You. 
brick house here. At 55 years old, he. is only :know," lie .confides, "the .Communists 'have

155 pounds he parried in 1940. His message has 'He says the list of such poisons includes radio-, 
remained constant, too: The -"international active substances, as well as tOxic material' 
criminal Communist conspiracy". is more ?(1'l.n- that can't be traced. ? . 
gerOns than ever before..., 
Most of Herb Philbrick's audiences are un-a-
.: .Sonie things have changed. Mr. Philbrick ?Ware of what he goes through to reach them. 
has thrown of his cover with a vengeance and 
today speaks widely on anti-Communist sub- what he says invariably pleases them. His 
speechless which deal with such topics as 'Are 
You Sure Communism Hasn't Brainwashed 
You?" and ''Spies and Our National Defense," 
Sehwarz's Christian Anti-Communism Crusade, ;always meet with much applause. But the 
accompanies him on a cross-country lecture .fact that he has the sympathy; of his listeners 
circuit that last year took them to 49 states for 
. a total cif more. than 250 speeches--often at $30? 
to $730 an appearance. 
. 'Too Many Aniateurs" ? 
. "Lots of people accuse me of being a profes-
sional anti-Communist," Mr. Philbrick says. "I 
just smile broadly and say, 'I hope I'm not an 
amateur.' We need more professional anti-
Communists. There are too many amateurs." 
To hear the Philbricks telt it, professional-
ism in their chosen field means living a life 
filled with fatigue and fraught with peril. "Oa brick himself, some are "sponsored" pieces 
? ?a lecture tour we average five hours .sleep a written by?and usually.touting?variaus cons-
night, and very often we don't get that," says mercial concerns, .trade groups and other orga-

tour we don't get any sleep at all." ? . ? ? check frem. the sponsor. This Is basically 
U.S.P.A.'s FOIO source of revenue; since the 1,-
200 subscribing newspapers don't pay any fee 
They just are interested in what he says., and 
pets. He has been divorced And remarried. His 
second -wife, Shirley, -a 28-year-old former 
model who once worked fen' Dr... Fred 
isn't cause for real rejoicing At the Philbricks. 
"Usually," he says, "the ones that need to be 
convinced about comMunism don't come." ? 
There are, however, other ways to .reach the 
uncencerned. For more than a- year, Mr. Phil-
brick has owned and operated U.S. Press Asso-
ciation, which sends politically rignt-of?center 
editorials to 1,200 newspapers, most of them 
small weeklies. - 
The six editorials sent out each week are 
predominantly anti-Comminlist or conservative 
in tone. While most are written by Mr. Phil-
at alL 
Approved For Release 2001/03/04 : CIA-RDP80-01601R00010010-0001-2 
Mr. Philbrick's own editorials have ranged 
is recent months from an attack on Sen. J. MI.-. 
liam Fulbright to an analysis of what he 
termed the "smear campaign" that killed the 
Supreme Court nomination of Judge Clement 
haynsworth. A not-atypical series of spon-
sored editorials concerned what were called in-
flationary union demands being made against 
General Electric Co. The sponsor was General 
Electric, and the corporate giant paid U.S.P.A. 
.$400 an editorial. 
? 
A Lot oLAliases 
Lift:sal-the ,U.S.P.A., however, is i.nore than 
a heady round of editorial w?riting. Each week, 
the Post Offee delivers'some. 1,800 newspapers 
to the Phithilchs, who, vi1lr a few partstime 
helpers, scour each and every page for reprints 
of the assoielation's Material. Paying sponsors 
are then rriftiled any relevant editorials to show 
them what they got for their money. 
Further burdening the Bethesda postal sys-
tem, the .11.'ailbricks also' receive regular mail-
ings of propaganda from Communist countries, 
as well as copies of the Daily World, the organ 
of the U:S.: Communist Party. All mail from 
.the enemy Comes addressed to assorted aliases 
assumed by Mr. Philbriek. A recent letter from 
Radio Havana, for example, arrived at-the 
Philbrick readeRe addressed to one "H. A. 
Arthur." Communist mail received by the Phil. 
bricks has one destination. "We turn it over to 
the FBI," Philbrick says, 
The Philbricks' relationship with the Pm is 
close. Mr. Philbrick says some Communist 
Party members still provide him with informa-
tion, which he then passes on to the bureau. 
And every December, he adds, a Christmas 
card arrives extending greetings of the season 
from J. Edgar Hoover. 
The bureau also serves as a handy watch-
dogs. '!Once there :vas a threat and an FBI 
agent showed up mysteriously .and stayed with 
us the whole time," Shirley Philbrick says. The 
federal government's watchfulness is made 
easier by the fact that the?Philbricks' house is 
just a few minutes drive from CIA hcadquar- Ls. 
ters and is Idcatedl'on a street filled with homes. 
belonging to C1h FBI and other goveenment 
employes. ? ? 
A Busy Life 
Time spent by the Philbrielts in Bethesda 
can hardly be called restful.- Besides running 
the U.S.P.A., Mr. Philbrick teaches seminars 
for the Christian Anti-ConsmunisM Crusade, 
makes radio .and televHion appearances, and 
is active in several anti-Communist and con-
servative organizations. He's atho involved in 
rewriting "I Led Three Lives" as a textbook 
on communism.. 
Mr. Philbrick's writing- has periodically ap-
peared over the .past 20 years in a variety of 
anti-Communist publications. A typical -Phil-
brick article appeared in a book titled "Your 
Church?Their Target" and took on folksingers 
in general and Pete Seeger in particular for.al-
leged Communist connections. 
--
herb Philbrick says his Anti-Communism 
dates from 1940, when he discove?red that an Os-
tensibly independent group called the Massa-
chusetts Youth Council was controlled by the 
Communist Party. He quickly informed the 
FBI, which advised him to participate in the 
council's activities and in turri to -keep the bu-
reau informed. ? _

- "-
Appeals for the Si:WI Circuit to 
order Judge Keith to vacate his . 
disclosure order. The request was 
in the form of what is known as a 
petition for a writ of mandamus. 
In commanding the disclosure, 
the petition says, Judge Keith 
11m-
ited the Justice Department to 
only two courses of action, "either ? 
of which," it said, "would result in 
grave and irreparable harm to le-
gitirnate governmental interests." 
.The first course of. action, the 
petition says, would be the clisclo-
sure of sealed information that . 
"would prejudice the national secu-
rity." 
The second course would be to 
'refuse to comply with the order, 
"in order to protect the natibnal ' 
security," which would result in a ? 
disrnissal of the indictment against 
Plamondon. 
The logs of the surveillances, 
according to the petition, were giv-
en to the District Court judge in 
Detroit in the form of a sealed 
exhibit for Judge Keith's inspec-
tion only. Records show that when 
Plamondon's attorneys claimed the 
surveillance was illega 1, Judge 
Keith granted their motion to dis-
close the information. 
. Notified by the Justice Depart-

made to the Sixth Circuit, which

firearms possession: 
'I

, Judge Warren J. Ferguson of

Mat authority, which would put a growinr7, use of hidden lis-
tening devices beyond any court review, has growing
.ruled invalid 
twice and upheld twice by lower federal courts. 
Mitchell is the first attorney 
general to claim that, in eases 
involving "violent disorders" in. 
this country, he need not possess 
a court order before authorizing 
wiretapping or eavesdropping. 
His decision to take that ques-
tion to the 6th U.S. Court of 
Appeals in Cincinnati follows a 
ruling against bins on Tuesday 
by U.S. District Jildge Damon 
Keith in Detroit. 
Keith's' decision, followed al-
most exactly the reasoning that 
a federal jildcoe Arnaelcs 
the issue of homefront eavea-
dropping to the Supreme Court 
for an ultimate ruling. 
One of the lower court deci-
sions which upheld Mitchell's 
authority is already before the 
7th U.S. Court of Appeals in Chi-
cago, but that is in the famous 
Chicago Seven conspiracy case 
--? an appeal that probably will 
not be decided for many months. 
The Chicago case was the first 
one in which Mitchell had 
claimed that the "inherent pow-

either would have had to dis_ Mitchell and his aides worked 
close today the secret logs of out that constitutional theory 
overheard 'conversations or a 
man charged with a bombing 
?conspiracy or drop the charges'. 
? . After Judge Keith was notified 
that an appeal would be. filed, he 
postponed the scheduled op-ping 
of the bombing trial until -Feb. 9. 
In addition, he said he would 
"assist. the government, in ob-
taining . . . reivew" of his deci-
sion by the Appeals Court be-
cause it involved "an impoelant 
issue of first impression." He 
did not explain what he would do 
to help,

test case will be the first to take

figure who was convicted is 1.9a39

While his case was baleg ap-
pealed,' the government resealed 
it had eavesdropped on hi; tele-
phone conversations five times, 
This disclosure led to Jorlo: Fer-
guson's ruling that the ''bug-
ging," was illegal because it had 
been carried on ? - walnut a 
court-approved warrant.. , 
Second Reversal 
The Detroit case -vhich 
brought the second decision 
against the attorney general's 
authority involves Lavatenee 
(Pun) Plamondon, one of three 
mmbers of the militant White 
Panther Party facing trial on 
charges of a 1963 conspirrey to

On Feb. 21, after the conspira-
cy trial was over, Hoffman 
agreed with Mitchell's argument 
and ruled that avesdron logs on 
some of those accused in the 
conspiracy case need not be 
turned over to them. 
On Sept. 1, U.S. District Judge 
Arthur j. Stanley of Kansas City 
similarly ruled in Mitchell's faa

should be understood to include 
those -involving "domestic orga-

Fall .Legaliz at ion 
If the courts ultimately hold 
that .Mitchell, may decide on his 
own to approve surveillance on 
"d omestic 'subversives," it 
would not only mean that he 
would have much more flexibili-
ty in using that method of inves-
tigation. 
It also would mean that any 
eavesdropping would be consid-
ered completely legal. That 
would insulate the records or 
tapes of (Tic eavesdropping from 
any possiblee disclosure to indi-
viduals whose cortvers ions had 
been piclaed up. 
Under a Supreme Court deci-
sion on March 10, 1969, in the. 
so-called "Alderman ease," any 
records of illegal eavesdropping 
must be turned over to defense,

PS 22 and its sattelite strips, 
? PS 3 and PS 4, are on the east 
edge of the Bolovens plateau 
.in southern Laos, 5 miles from 
,the network of Communist 
reinforcement and supply 
routes to Cambodia and South 
Vietnam known as the Ho Chi 
Minh Trail. ? 
Pinpoint 1352 Targets 
.For years, PS 22 has been 
the home of men of the First 
Special Guerrilla Unit the 10th 
Guerrilla Battalion: and their 
A in cric an commanders, a 
handful of military men work-
ing for the Central Intelligence 
Agency. 2 ? 
These units mostly com-
posed of Lao Inlimen- with- a 
few Thais, total about On 
men. They have been responsi-
ble for harassment raids and 
pinpointing targets for U.S. 
Air Force. 1352 strikes on the 
south half of the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail designated by the CIA as 
guerrilla zone number one. 
Now the guerrillas and their - 
U.S. commanders have had to 
be replaced by Lao regular 
troops. 
The guerrillas are "demor-
alized and disorganized," said 
a Lao military official. 
Sent to Mountains 
The guerrillas have been 
sent to ie ? 
Mountain 
.the Bolovens town of Pal: Song 
for reorganization, including 
strengthening by Thai special 
forces and some Cambodians 
newly -sent to Laos and .re-
training by Thai advisers.. ; 
Few guerrilla teams are still ' 
active instead of prowling the ? 
Ho Chl Minh Trail complex ; 
and seeking North Vietnamese ; 
concentrations heading for 
Cambodia, they are scouring 
the Bolevens for large North 
Vietnamese units v,diose tar-
gets are this air strip and Pak 
Song. 
Hanoi's troops already have 
knocked out the American-run 
? - 
- The collapse of the guerril-
las hero at Site 22 is undoubt-
edly hay nigdire conseven-
ces for Americans, Cambo-
dians and Lao alike. 
American intelligence has 
been deprived of its eyes on 
this part of the trail. 
The _North Vietnamese can 
now move supplies and rein-
forcements into Cambodia al-
most at will. 
The Lao government, ac-
cording to the Lao military, 
has been forced to commit its 
last reserves to a fixed de-
fense'of the Bolovens.. 
The fall of PS 22, which is 
presently extremely likely, 
would see this reserve .force 
cut off a long way from help 
and possibly lead to the fall of 
the Dolorous town of Pak Song 
resulting in the North Viet-
.n am c s e completely taking 
? over the, Bolovens for a new 
sanctuary against Cambodian 
and South Vietnam. 
Such a move would severely 
hnider any South Vietnamese 
drive into south Laos to smash 
the trail area. 
This results from the failure 
of the Central Intelligence 
Agency operation, a failure for 
which the Americans them-
selves must take the blame. 
American commanders on 
the Bolovens failed to follow 
one of the first principles of 
guerrilla warfare ? to hide 
your base and to be ready to 
move elsewhere quickly if dis-
covered. 
Instead they based on large 
net' strips that were easy for 
the North V,ie4mese to find 
? and attack. 
Instead of making air drops 
to supply guerrillas in the jun-
gle, bases such as PS 22 wpre 
Used to stockpile- munitions 
rtindsupplies. 
Now the North Vietnamese 
have, overrun most of the iras-
CS and the guerrilla operatron 
.has been smashed. .

from persons registered to 
vote in the 1968 presidential 
election, should be broadened 
to include younger persons 
down to the age of 18. ? 
Poet Allen Ginsberg of New 
York argued that the opinions 
.of people under the age of 29 
differed significantly from 
'those of older Americans be-
cause young people have "the

defense motion currently be-

District Judge Damon J. 
Keith. 
Keith accepted Ginsberg 
and Vaughn as expert wit-
nesses about young people 
though strenuous objections 
were filed by Assistant U.S. 
Attorney John H. Hausner, 
head of the prosecution team. 
? HAUSNER called the 
Opinions of the 44-ye a r-o I d 
Ginsberg "the fantasties of a 
middle-aged man who can't 
admit that his youth is gone." 
Hausner said Ginsberg,'s 
testimony did not prove a gen-
eration gap exists, but only 
indicated there is "a Ginsberg 
gap, the gap between those 
who agree with him and those 
who don't."

DEFENSE ATTORNEY 
Leonard Weinglass said that 
in the court's district there 
are about. 450,003 persons be-

630 are on the 1968 jury list 
and all but 74 were excluded 
as prospective jurors because 
they were students, service-

Calling the present list un-

Weinglass said, "This court 
has the power . . . to expand

Although lawyers attempt to

over admit to is the cnly one I 
ever committed, the assassina-

Of course Elsie believesi in her

abandoned her plan to retire

will be enough money to pay for 
John's lawyers: "Site,. seven

But after I began to see the way 
the police harassed and perse-
cuted him I began to read and 
think a little more about what 
he was saying and it made 
sense." 
Sinclair's family and friends 
believe he is apolitical prisoaer, 
but his rebellion has not been 
strictly political. As his wife 
Leni explains: 
"After John finished cam 
and moved to Detroit in la91 lie 
decided against simply joining 
the local Committee to End the 
War in Vietnam. It was too easy 
to be just one more middle-class 
radical commuting in from the 
suburbs to protest the war. Pro-
test seemed like a sideline, he 
wanted to set up an alternate 
life-style." 
Sinclair's. idea was to find a 
for his friends to support 
themselves 'through their own 
creativity. Be founded the De-
troit Artists' Workshop, ar-
ranged club jobs for musicians, 
sold poetry feral staged success-
ful photographic exhibitions. 
Every Sunday afternoon there 
were poetry readings, concerts 
and shows at the Artists' Work-
shop storefront near Detroit's 
John Lodge Freeway. Sinclair 
also rented sbe- old homes near 
the Workshop foi? $50 a month 
each and turned them into com-
munal accommodations for 50 
workshop members. 
The police, however, saw the 
Artists' Workshop as the base of 
Detroit's spreading drug culture. 
Undercover agents soon began 
infiltrating the group, searching 
for marijuana. One agent gave 
himself away by showing up 
asking: "Is this the place where 
I can get some dope and hippie 
broods?" 
But en Jan, 21, 1937, the police 
stiored. Agents arrested 56 per-
SCMS, includiug Sinclair. The ba-
sis for the sweeping raid was 
Sinclair's gift of two marijuana 
cigarettes to narcotics agent Va-
han Kapegian nearly a month 
earlier. Kapegian had posed as a 
Ii ippie candlemaker named 
?Louita He was not without soul, 
Shortly before the Jan. 24 bust, 
Kapegian contributed a bag full

about it after being released on 
bail. Ile kept busy expanding the 
Workshop commune into a psy-
chedelic conglomerate 'called 
Trans-hove Energies. 
Soon five rock musicians from 
suburban Livonia joined up and 
gave Trans-Love a national rep-
utation. The musicians called 
themselves the MC-5 and an al-
lied Trans-Love light company 
brought psychedelic perform-
PneOS to appreciative young au-
diences. ? 
By late :J.9$7 Sinclair's hair bit-
lowed past his shoulders and he 
was articulsting the Trans-Love 
philosophy: rock and roll, dope 
and love-making in the streets. 
Sinclair rejoiced over the ability 
of the MC-5 arid similar groups 
to capture the minds of the 
young and destroy the old order: 
"You don't need to get rid of all 
the bookies, you Just rob them of 
their replacements, let . them 
breed, atrophy and die out, with 
the heirs cheering triumphantly 
all around." 
But as the MC-5 soard to the 
top of the charts with "Kick Out 
the Jams," Trans-Bove begari 
having problems with the com-
munity. Menorahs were tossed 
at the commund and building 
inspectors found code violatons. 
In June 1932, after the -band 
was charged with several noisc 
violations, the commune decided 
to migrate 40 miles west to An 
Arbor. Two big - communal 
homes were rented in the middle 
of the UnivCasity of Michigan'a 
fraternity row. The White. 
Panther party was formed to 
provide a practical political 
organization for young white 
rebels. 
Modeled along the lines of the 
Black Panther- paaty, this orga-
niaation now elairria about 3,900 
members in various chapter 
across the country. The printery 
goal of the party is liberation of 
the youth culture. Specific aims 
include aboittion of money, dis-
solution of all political bounda-
ries, legalization or marijuana, 
release of all political prisoners, 
free 'education and an end to the 
draft. 
, Panther literature began going 
out to high school ancients, par-
ticularly in the Midwest, and an-
gry parent's asked postal offi-
cials to ban it.

"It's strictly the filthiest stuff 
I've ever seen. Ten, 11 and 
12-year-olds are receiving it. I'm 
bewildered with some of it and it 
frightens -me." Two Panthers 
were charged with distributing 
obscene materials to minors 
and several cbseenity ? cases 
were brought against recoil 
store clerks who sold the MC-5'a. 
' "Kick Out the ? jams.." 
One national magazine wrote 
that the record album was ''run-
old with rotten revolutinary 
rhetoric, and the 111.1731C 
there's no music, juai sound: 
ugly crashes airci bLogs zaal, 
whizzes and wings and dings ... 
manic, vulgar sound." ? 
Sinclair ignored the criticism 
and worked hard to redece ten-
sions between Ann 1?a-ber youth 
and police. He encoaraged 
youths "to attend city comicil 
meetings and make therns,?lves 
heard instead of sitting around 
bitching about: cotalitirtaa,? ? 
The Panthers negotiated with 
the city fathers to obtain per-
mits for Sunday afternoon con-
certs in local parks. They VIEUIL.-
cd youths to stay away from 
dangerous drugs litre harola, 
morphine and barbitreatos. ? 
By the summer of 1.080 Sin-
clair was 'so busy working on 
these problems that he had near-
ly forgotten about the 1.937 
marijuana offense. But when he 
was notified of a July trial date. 
he didn't panic; he organized au' 
elaborate deferee challenging 
t Ii e constitutionality of 
marijuanitprohibition. 
In court medical ex-parts told a 
three-judge .panel that 
marijuana was not addictive arid 
that it was safer than cigarettes. 
But the panel threw out the chal-
lenge and on July 25, 1989, he 
was convicted.. He was son;

.'; the trial of three White Panth-
.? ers charged in the bombing of 
Ann Arbor's CIA office.

a whether the U.S. attorney gen-
eral must obtain a Federal 
i Court warrant to tap the tele-
phone of a person suspected of . 
iplottiag against the govern-

., The defendants are Law-
rence R. (Pun) Plamondon, 
25,, charged with the actual 
! bombing, which occurred 
Sept. 29, 1968, and John Sin-
t-
-: daft, 28, a.nd John W. Forrest, 
?2I, both accused of conspir-
i' acy. 
? 
? U.S. Atty. Gen. John N. 
t Mitchell has admitted in an 
affadavit that federal agents 
had tapped Plamondon's tele-
phone without a warrant from 
a federal judge. 
FEDERAL LAW permits 
'? wiretaps without court war-
'rants in cases involving sus-
pected foreign subversives, but 
bars them in domestic 
im-
inal Cases'. The law is unclear 
ondomestic subversion eases,. . 
observers say. 
Defense attorney William 
KunstIcr told Keith he 
knows of only one previous 
case in which a federal judge 
had ruled on precisely the 
same issue. Ile cited a deci-
sion earlier this v.-eek by a 
California judge who said that 
warrants are required. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney John 
11. Hamner, however, said a 
. federal judge in Kan.:as- had 
ruled last September that such 
wiHtaps were legal in cases 
designated b3.7 the at torn ey 
general as involving threats 
by domestic insur gen t 
against national security. 
THE CONFLICT grots out 
of a pretrial motion in which 
Kunstler has asked Keith to 
.bar the wiretap evidence 
against his clients. Keith gave 
no in (Ilea ti on on when he a 
would annottace a decision. 
The defense is. also 'asking 
that IS-year-olds be authorized 
to sit on the Panthers' jury. 
It cited the recent U.S. Su-
preme Court ruling granting 
IS-year-olds the right to vote 
'in future federal elections. 
Presently, jury rolls arc taken 
from voter ',registration lists 
which still do not reflect the 
38-year-old vote decision. 
Several defense witnesses 
have testified that. the federal 
'court system, in its jury selec-
tion procedures, is weighted 
against persons under 29. 
Dr. Gerald Kline, an assist-
ant journalism Pi ?lessor at 
the University of Michigan, 
teatified yesterday that youths ; 
are suspicious of the tradi-
tional Political process.. 
BECAUSE OF 'I IIIS, Kline 
said, many refuse to'regiSter. 
to vote and hence would not bc 
summoned to jury duty. 
The defense concluded yes-
'terday's session with the testi- ; 
mony of ; State Rep. Jackie 
Vaughn 11T, Detroit Democrat. 
Vaughn said "many young 
people regard the traditional 
politic al system as "hope-. ;

Federal. Judge Damon Keith 
has been asked to choose be-
tween two conflicting court 
rulings in deciding whether to 
permit ? wiretap ' evidence at 
the trial of three White Panth-
ers charged in the bombing of'l 
Ann Arbor's CIA office. 
At issue is the question of 
? whether the U.S. attorney gen-
eral mist obtain a Federal 
- 
Court lvarrant to tap the tele- - 
phorie of a person suspected of 
plotting against the govern-
ment. ? ? 
The defendants are Law-

bars them in domestic crim-
inal cases. The law is Unclear 
on domestic subversion eases, 
observers say. 
_ Defense attorney William 
M. Kunstler ..told Keith he 
Rnows of only one previous 
case in which a federal judge 
had ruled on precisely the 
same issue. Ile cited a deci-
sion earlier this week by a 
California judge who said that 
warrants are required. , 
? Assistant U.5. Attorney john 
31. Ilausner, however, said a 
federal judge in Kansas had 
ruled last September that such 
wiretaps were legal in cases 
designated by the at tor n4ey 
general as involving threats 
by domestic insur gen t s 
against national security.

.Presently. jury rolls are taken

'which do not reflect the

Several defense witnesses 
have testified that the federal 
court system, in its jury selec-
tion procedures, is weighted 
against persons under 29. 
? Dr. Gerald Kline, an assist- - 
ant journalism . professor at. 
the University or Michigan, 
testified yesterday that youths 
are suspicious of the tradi-

BECAUSE OF THIS, Kline 
said, many refuse to register 
to vote and hence would not be 
? summoned to jury duty. 
The defense concluded yes-
terday's session with the testi-
mony of State Rep. Jackie 
Vaughn III, Detroit Democrat. 
Vaughn said "many young 
people regard the traditional 
pm 1 itic al system as "hope-
lessly lost." 
Campaigning for the state 
18-year-old ,vote amendment 
last year revealed a large 
amount of prejudice against 
youths, Vaughn said.

A greatly intensified effort to protect pub-
lic se' \rants from politically motivated harm 
has been undertaken by the Secret Service, 
/the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and 
the Central Intelligence Agency. 
The chief members of the government 
here, as well as the personnel of foreign em-
bassies in Washington and American em-
bassies abroad, are being given a rapidly 
expanded .guard. 
Meanwhile, programs to train 'specialized 
police and intelligence agents for this pur-
pose are proceeding under forced draft. 
Very little is being said in public about 
? this effort, lest ideas for blackmailing gov-
ernm.ents and their ofilCials be planted in 
militant .or unstable minds. The results of 
, the inteleisitled 'protection. are visible as 'well 
as known to Washington news correspon-
dents, however. . . 
The issue is pointed up by the Berrigan 
affair which iic.)w is being ,given widd pub-
licity because 'it is unavoidable-, in view of a 
public grand jury indictment, and because it 
? shows what Is .represented by the indictment 
-as successful police work by the 
? 
KidDap plot clilar3-0(1 
? 'Charged with conspiracy, the accused. 
have to be considered innocent unless -their 
forthcoming. court trial results in a guilty 
'e'dict for any of seven indictments, which 
presume the possibility of conspiracy to blow 
up the heating pipes for some federal build-
- ings here, and thereafter to kidnap Presi-
dential Assistant for National Security Af-
fairs Henry A, Kissinger., 
It is assumed by the FBI that an anti-? 
war group -calling itself the East Coast Con-
spiracy to Save Lives including . a 'number 
? of Roman Catholic priests like the Rev. 
Philip F. Berrigan, a former priest, and 
nun who were. included in the indictment, is 
not paCifIst as claimed, but willing to corn-
Omit crimes to try to stop the fighting in 
Vietnam.,. 
This is denied by those of the defendants 
? who have spoken 'publicly, and by other 
members of the so-called East Coast Con-
spiracy. 
Without -drawing any -conclusions from 
? this 'case, which is yet to be tried, it shows 
the greatly enlarged bffort of the FBI to 
deal with the clangers of a period in which 
both norMal and abnormal persons have' 
been increasingly involved with violence be-
cause of the violence of the Vltetnansi war. 
0/,. 
. ? . 
been declared against governments and their 
hitherto vulnerable top men. It is conducted 
by persons and groups who are willing to 
use illegal violence to protest what the gov-
comment considdrs to be a legal form of 
violence in the Vietnam war. 
Without attempting a judgment on the 
political and social questions involved, or 
the legal questions, the result has been a 
wave of efforts to blackmail governments 
.on the part of frustrated citizens. 
Americans are highly conscious of. the . 
three assassinations of- two Kennedys and 
Dr. Martin Luther King, and -of the hijack-
ing of airplanes in the recent Jordanian 
crisis. They have heard of the kidnappings 
of American, British, Canadian, and Latin-
American diplomats and public figures. 
They have been told that security agents 
now are flying on American international 
plane routes. . ? . - 
catt5es' 
What they have 
not seen is the guards ac-
companying many more officials than Mr. 
Kissinger, Or standing outside embassies 
here. 
In his most recent issue of Uniform 
Crime Reports, FBI Director J. Edgar 
2 
, 
Hoover makes a discreet reference to the 
"social causes"- along with other causes 
of the sharp increas.e in crime in the past 
year. He refers to controversial legislation 
passed by, Congress and state legislatures, 
which he calls "positive action" to meet, 
among other things, "civil disorder crises." 
He does not mention the shaui.'increase 
in agents of his and other. protection 
agencies, which appear only ein legislative 
appropriations. 
STATI NTL 
The ,,citiestions which arise of protecting 
innocent persons from a wave of new 
security measures and from public pres-
sures to solve crimes of this sort are yet 
unanswered and only began to be discussed 
by the expiring .Congress in any detail. 
But the known and unavcr.ved incidents 
of the new kinds of guerrilla war are press-
ing on the police and they are responding 
under counterpressure. 
A new era embracing new levels and 
techniques of law enforcement, along with 
its attendant problems of personal liberty 
and defense of the- innocent, seems to be 
opened. Whether it 'will abate with the 
-winding down of the Vietnam war, assum-
ing that takes place as hoped,- remains to 
be seen. ?
