 MEMORANDUM FOR:              The Honorable McGeorge Bundy
 Special Assistant to the President
 for National Security Affairs
 SUBJECT:                     Report of Counter-Guerrilla Warfare
 Task Force
 1.   For some months a task force of senior officers, under my
 chairmanship, has been discussing how best to ensure an adequate focus
 within the U. S. Government on the problems of dealing with Communist
 indirect aggression and subversive violence.  The officers on this group
 have included officials of the State and Defense Departments, the White
 House, and CIA.  They have, however, participated as individuals and
 have not committed their respective organizations.
 2.   The result of our effort, unanimously approved by the task
 force members, is herewith submitted for your consideration.  I am
 also sending copies to General Maxwell Taylor for his comments in his
 capacity as chairman of the NSC Special Group, the charter of which
 would be enlarged by the report's recommendations.  Copies of the re-
 port are also being sent to the State and Defense Departments through
 their task force participants.
 3.   1 suggest that after soliciting the views of the agencies con-
 cerned you might well wish to take the initiative in submitting the re-
 port to the NSC for Presidential review of the action recommendations.

 CONCLUSIONS
 1    Serious Communist intent and capability to press forward with the
 technique of subversive intervention, often extending to guerrilla warfare in
 various underdeveloped countries or regions, confront the US with a critical
 problem which will persist throughout the Sixties.
 2.   However, despite the clear consensus within the US Government
 as to the magnitude and urgency of this problem, we are not yet organized
 to help threatened countries to deal adequately with it.  We have at our dis-
 posal a variety of potential resources and programs for facilitating the pre-
 vention of Communist subversive violence and for repressing active guer-
 rillas, but these have not yet been harnessed by a unifying concept of
 operations, high level focus on the problem, and greater impetus to the
 development of programs commensurate to the need.
 3.   Such policies and programs cut across a wide spectrum of exist-
 ing agency responsibilities.  In particular, they will require concerted and
 carefully focussed civil and military actions by the State and Defense De-
 partments, AID, USIA, and CIA.
 4.   But there is no single high-level locus of authority and responsi-
 bility within the Executive Branch to undertake this vitally needed concert-
 ing of inter-agency resources.  There is no present coordinating mechanism,
 short of the NSC, which is empowered to provide the needed centralized direc-
 tion of effort, and there is none which is devoting a significant share of its

 energies to the peculiar requirements of the guerrilla warfare challenge and to
 its inter-agency program implications.  Except for such country Task Forces
 as have been constituted in specific instances, there are no mechanisms for
 focussing Government-wide resources on identifying and finding solutions to
 the unique problems of particular countries.  Moreover, present Task Forces
 for critical areas have lacked a source of guidance and support on the special
 problems of preventing and dealing with Communist subversive violence, and
 they have not always focussed .sufficiently on these aspects.
 5.   Therefore, the most immediate need is for adequate institutional
 arrangements to ensure continuing focus on and attention to the problem at a
 high governmental level.  Because of its responsibilities in directly related
 fields and because the agencies chiefly concerned are already represented
 on it, expansion of the mandate of the NSC Special Group seems the most
 effective way to carry out this function.
 6.   New arrangements are also needed to facilitate the stepping-up
 or reorientation of existing departmental and agency programs to achieve
 maximum effectiveness in those countries where the need is most critical,
 and to enable us to anticipate future needs.  However, action responsibility
 for programs to prevent or counter subversive violence should continue to
 rest with the appropriate departments and agencies.  Most of these programs
 also involve broader objectives.  The preventive aspects of our diplomatic,
 economic aid, overt informational, and certain covert programs on behalf of

 social, economic, and political progress in threatened countries are inevitably
 closely related to the totality of US foreign policy toward such countries.
 RECOMMENDATIONS
 Accordingly it is proposed that:
 1.   The NSC Special Group, chaired by the Military Representative of the
 President, should be given the additional responsibility of providing focus and
 direction to interdepartmental programs for coping with threats of Communist
 subversive intervention, actual and potential, in nations and areas abroad which
 the President considers critical.  Where appropriate, the Directors of the Agency
 for International Development and the US Information Agency would be invited to
 participate in Special Group deliberations in this field.
 2.   As a first step, the Special Group should recommend a directive de-
 limiting and defining the new scope of its responsibility, to include the designa-
 tion of the specific areas where subversive violence or guerrilla warfare is
 either already a major factor (e. g. , South Vietnam; Laos, Colombia) or a
 potentially serious threat (e. g. , Thailand, Iran, Bolivia).  The designation
 criteria should be rigorously narrow so as to focus attention and resources on
 only the few most critical situations.
 3.   For countries or regions determined by the NSC Special Group to
 be critically threatened by Communist subversive violence and approved by
 the President for assignment to its jurisdiction, the Secretary of State in co-
 ordination with the department heads should constitute inter-agency country

 rApproved For Release 2001/00/(14 p  --Dp89B00552R000100040002-3
 or regional Task Forces in Washington (if not already in being), charged with
 the development and review of integrated action programs to deal with Commu-
 nist violence or its threat in their geographic areas.  The Task Forces would
 normally be chaired by senior State Department geographic officers at the
 Assistant Secretary level.  If the endangered country is in an active US Military
 Theater of Operations or if the NSC Special Group determines that the military
 aspects of the country situation predominate, the Defense Department should
 assume the chairmanship.    Members would be formally assigned and regard
 as primary their duties on the Task Force.  Task Forces would report to and
 be under the guidance of the NSC Special Group on matters bearing directly on
 Communist-inspired violence.
 4.   In countries designated as critically threatened, the Country Teams
 should be charged with developing and forwarding integrated program recom-
 mendations and with ensuring effective local coordination in the execution of
 approved programs to counter the threat.  The Country Teams would submit
 their recommendations and reports through normal channels to the chairmen
 of the competent Task Forces, who would keep the NSC Special Group informed
 of plans and progress.
 5.   The Special Group should also be responsible for focussing increased
 attention on those aspects of broader US Government programs which generate
 resources for the prevention or neutralization of Communist subversive inter-
 vention, e. g
 Military Assistance Program (MAP), Overseas Internal Security

 Program (OISP), certain specialized military forces and covert action programs.
 It should interest itself in the following types of problems, drawing on the in-
 formational resources and special skills of the various departments and agencies
 as appropriate:
 a.   The organization, equipment, funds, doctrine,- and techniques
 required to improve the capabilities of designated threatened countries for in-
 ternal security and counter-guerrilla measures.  This may involve strengthen-
 ing or initiating OISP activities, reorienting MAP activities to give increased
 ?
 emphasis to the counter-guerrilla training and equipping mission, or the pro-
 vision of new authority, funds, facilities, personnel and equipment for CIA
 counter-guerrilla paramilitary operations.
 b.   Ways in which MAP and MAAG activities in threatened countries,
 possibly supplemented by AID and CIA capabilities, can help realize the con-
 structive economic and political potentialities of civic action by the armed
 forces of the countries.
 c.   The adequacy of current appropriations., fiscal procedures, and
 enabling legislation to satisfy indicated program needs, with possible requests
 for new Congressional authority to permit inter-agency transfers of funds and
 achieve greater flexibility. for counter-violence aid programs.
 6.   While action responsibility for programs related to preventing or
 countering subversive violence would remain in existing departments and
 agencies, it is appropriate that the Special Group be authorized to comment

 Approved For Release 2001/0?/~4

 Dx .submit recommendations on the particular implications of such programs
 .for the.critical problems of deterring Communist subversions and violence,
 especially for the shorter-term purposes of winning local popular support
 away from the Communists.  The Special Group would provide focus on
 counter-subversion implications of departmental critical area planning both
 through its collective guidance to the critical area Task Forces and through
 the instructions of individual Special Group members to their own area repre-
 sentatives through their respective departmental and agency channels.   The
 Special Group would also review integrated critical area program proposals,
 prepared by the Task Forces in coordination with the senior US field repre-
 sentative, and would approve them for execution if they fall within existing
 policy.  In the event of inter-agency disagreements, or actions requiring
 fresh policy determinations, the Special Group members would refer them
 to their respective principals.
 7.   Once a critical area  inter-agency program had been approved, the
 Special Group would monitor its execution both through the appropriate Task
 Forces and through the departmental /agency channels of Special Group
 members.     The main contribution of the Task Forces in the monitoring and
 review process would be in providing collective judgments, by country or
 region, on the adequacy of program objectives and achievements in relation to
 the problems of preventing or countering subversive violence.
 8.   In view of the sensitivity of. covert action programs and the special

 procedures  in effect for'. authorizing and reviewing them, covert aspects of
 counter-guerrilla warfare country and regional program planning and execution
 would be handled through special channels.
 9.   In considering action programs to counter Communist subversive
 intervention in designated critical areas, the Special Group and Task Forces
 should give attention to the possibilities for "offensive counter-measures",
 as discussed on pp. 33-43 of this report.

 I.    Purpose of the Report
 Leaving aside the recurrent problem of Berlin, the primary problem of
 American foreign policy for well over a decade has centered on the revolu-
 tionary process going forward in the underdeveloped areas.  Directly and
 indirectly these areas have generated the major crises and anxieties of the
 non-Communist world.
 This report analyses situations in the underdeveloped areas where sub-
 versive and guerrilla-type violence, inspired and exploited by the Communists,
 now exists or threatens in the immediate future.  On the basis of this analysis
 elements of a US strategy are proposed for coping with threats of subversive
 violence, including "wars of national liberation. "*
 II.   Elements of the Problem,
 A.   The Modernizing Process
 The revolutionary process in the underdeveloped areas has consisted
 in slow or more rapid transformation of the traditional societies toward
 modernization.  The forces and attitudes set in being by this process have
 created systematic patterns of tension within the non-Communist world be-
 tween its Northern and Southern halves; e. g. , between Indo-China and France,
 Indonesia and the Netherlands, Egypt and Britain, Algeria and France, Congo
 *Note:   Krushchev used the term "wars of national liberation" in his
 6 January 1961 address to CPSU theoreticians. In that address he pro-
 mised full Communist support to such wars, which he described as
 "struggles by all colonies and dependent countries against international
 imperialism" and as "uprisings against rotten reactionary regimes. "

 and Belg(um, Angola and Portugal, Cuba and United States.            These difficulties
 have.. been heightened by the sober and systematic effort of the Communists to
 exploit this revolutionary process for their own purposes.
 The underdeveloped and former colonial nations have been undergoing
 radical and fundamental change in their political, economic; and social struc-
 tures.  In many states the central governments have been weak and inexperienced.
 They lack the attitudes and administrative machinery to meet the problems of
 effective national unity, class discord, religious strife, tribal emnity,  and
 economic growth.  They have been distracted by real or imagined indignities
 from the past and deep compulsions to express themselves forcefully on the
 world scene,' despite the inherent weakness of their domestic bases.   Under
 these circumstances, it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible--
 except in a few marginal cases--to maintain at the same time the working con-
 cepts of free government, law and order, reasonably steady progress towards
 modernization, and a constructive stance on the world scene.
 It is difficult to generalize about the characteristics of the moderniz-
 ing process for several reasons.  Historical and geographic circumstances
 make every case unique and, additionally, no two states are at the same point
 in the modernization process.  Each has points of strength and vulnerability
 which arise according to the degree to which it has moved forward in political,
 social and economic modernization.  The process of modernization is in-
 herently interacting.  A weak government, a situation of deeply unresolved

 class conflict, and a stagnant economy interact to produce degeneration.  On
 the other hand, the whole process can be moved forward by constructive im-
 pulses from any direction.  An additional variable is that the susceptibility to
 Communist pressure of states varies not merely with their vulnerability but
 with respect to their proximity to Communist borders and is.influenced by
 current Communist strategy.
 The only constant that applies in all cases where a state is being sub-
 jected to subversive violence is that the Communists, in order to achieve their
 victory, use an inherently destructive approach to weaken and eliminate or
 take over existing military and official institutions.  We, in contrast, in aiding
 the threatened nation must seek to buttress and improve these same institutions.
 Since it is easier to throw rocks than to fend them off, the Communists' task
 is relatively the more simple, and the non-Communist world has the tougher
 job in building and fighting to protect what is being built.  Where a nation is
 new and ill-prepared to meet the responsibilities of sovereignty, most essential
 national institutions are inadequate or virtually non-exiset, as in the Congo.
 Such states are very near the condition of chaos where a relatively small
 number of Communist leaders can readily gain control.
 B.   Communist Doctrine.- and Tactics
 There is little mystery about the basic strategy and philosophy of
 successful Communist leaders in the underdeveloped areas.  They have been
 prolific writers and speakers, with a Hitler-like compulsion to state their

 Approved For Release 2001 /0SS0L: ClR RDP189B00552R000100040002-3
 objectives-and explain their methods with candor.  Mao Tse-Tung and Che
 Guevara are now widely read in both the Communist and free worlds.  On the
 other hand, in the heat of their battles for power the Communists are remark-
 ably opportunistic and their "blueprints of aggression"have proved of little
 value in forecasting specific tactics in a particular situation.  Their long-
 term aims of achieving and consolidating Communist power have however re-
 mained consistent.
 The Communists, working from a closed and virtually amoral society,
 have a relative advantage over the nations of the Free World in mounting of-
 fensives of subversive violence.  The Communist structure is designed to per-
 mit a minority to control a majority assumed to be dissident; and normal
 Communist domestic control measures reduce their relative vulnerability to
 externally stimulated acts of subversion.  Put another way, the fundamental
 social, political and human objectives of non-Communist societies render
 them more vulnerable than Communist societies to induced subversive acti-
 vities.                        This is an initial disadvantage we must accept and with whose conse-
 quences we must cope.
 The world has yet to see an independent state permanently elect to
 go Communist.  There have been "palace revolutions" which the Communists
 have subsequently sought to exploit.  There are also a number of so-called
 neutral states now leaning toward the Communist bloc, but, as of today, it
 appears that the Communists' most promising opportunity to expand into the

 Approved For Release 2001/0S9/VCC - -D, 89B00552R000100040002-3
 Free World lies in subversive violence and guerrilla opposition to governments
 which are not adequately meeting the political, social, economic, and security
 requirements of their peoples.
 So long as serious tensions exist within a threatened community, the
 Communists can hope to develop them into serious vulnerabilities, which if
 adroitly exploited, may arrest the state's forward movement and push it back
 toward confusion.  Serious political, social and economic tension can frequently
 be created and maintained from outside of the target state.  Economic pressure
 and intensive propaganda are two obvious means to this end.  In regions where
 cities are few and far between and the economy is still essentially agricultural,
 where the central government has not gripped and led the peasantry, a passive,
 detached rural population, capable of being terrorized or enflamed, is the more
 important and rewarding target for Communist political activity.  We have seen
 this situation in South Viet-Nam.  Discontented urban populations may be the
 most fertile ground for Communist activity if the country is in the uneasy throes
 of early industrialization.  Egypt is an example here.
 A nation's educated and professional manpower constitute another
 element of varying strength and vulnerability.  The Congo today has urgent
 and desperate need for citizens with legal training who can set up at. least
 a rudimentary judicial structure.  A few such men oriented toward the Free
 World would directly influence the society and future politics of the country.
 On the other hand, the Communist Party in Greece in the late Thirties and

 Approved For Release 2001Th TO !: tIAIR'bP89B00552R000100040002-3
 throughout the Forties drew a considerable proportion of its leadership from
 unemployed and resentful lawyers, for that profession had been a fashionable
 and socially desirable one for ambitious young men, and the country's govern-
 ment and economy simply could not absorb them.
 One of the Communists' most effective political warfare achievements
 in the years since World War II has been to persuade many millions in the
 underdeveloped countries and a disappointing number of national leaders that
 our policy of preserving existing international patterns and assisting existing
 governments reflects a desire on our part to freeze and preserve inadequate
 standards and modes of life in many of the non-Communist states of the world.
 The assumption that we oppose change and would prefer to see traditional
 inequities preserved imposes a serious handicap on our foreign relations.
 In underdeveloped areas where the Communists are able to exploit
 various local tensions and engage in active guerrilla operations, such opera-
 tions can in themselves further Communist aims in a number of ways:
 1.   A guerrilla opposing even a moderately unpopular regime has a
 strong psychological appeal to a part of the populace because he is ex-
 pressing in action emotions which they already feel and with which they
 sympathize.  For a government with democratic pretensions or inadequate
 police or military power, suppression of guerrillas who enjoy marginal
 support is a subtle and demanding political problem.  Guerrillas logically
 strike at the economy and the' basic social institutions of a country in order

 S E C R E T
 to weaken the government, but they are usually less in evidence than the
 numerically superior government forces who swarm across the country-
 side trying to catch them.  Hence, the populace tends to blame the govern-
 ment not only for any reprisal measures, but for their burned homes,
 looted farm yards and lost occupations, without thinking-back to first
 causes.  The government's unpopularity tends to increase if its perform-
 ance, does  not guarantee security.
 2.       For the Communists, a well-disciplined guerrilla force is
 .
 also the core of an effective administrative instrument and differs main-
 ly in poorer uniforms and living conditions from the elite police and
 party officials who will manage matters if they achieve their victory.
 The ability of a close-knit guerrilla unit to carry out assassinations as
 desired and impose a suitable sense of terror and submission on any
 popular opposition to them, fits neatly into the Communist theory that
 a small group should direct and discipline the great mass of the people.
 Guerrilla war, as the Communists wage it, enables them to combine in
 one well-controlled figure a potential popular hero and an efficient
 secret policeman.
 3.   The Communists have discovered, as many have before them,
 that in suitable terrain the partisan fighter occupies the full and ex-
 pensive attention of five to fifteen conventional soldiers and that, with-
 out actually controlling provinces or regions, he can deny their economic

 Approved For Release 200?/(J/& RC I-IFTDP89B00552R000100040002-3
 and political support to the government.
 The Communists have refined subversive violence as an instru-
 ment of political warfare to apply it destructively to underdeveloped
 countries in almost all stages of early growth.  The inflaming of tribal
 rivalries and religious hatreds, the disruption of amateurish but well-
 intentioned efforts at local administration, and the murder of potential
 anti-Communist leaders can prevent the working of even the most pri-
 mitive government systems.  If a government builds security forces
 to protect its administrative efforts and to establish at least a semblance
 of law and order, these in turn become Communist targets to be destroyed
 or at least evicted from the more.critical areas.  If existing social in-
 stitutions become identified with the government and show signs of vitality
 and strength, the Communists' efforts are devoted to undermining, taking
 over or demolishing these bodies.  For all those tasks varying sized
 groups of armed irregulars drawn from disaffected elements of the popu-
 lation can be highly effective.  They can work from a base of general dis-
 satisfaction with things as they are to create the popular sense of con-
 fusion, fear, and, finally, resignation which the Communists require. By
 terrorizing the peasants and defying the central government, the Commu-
 nists can posture as the wave of the future.
 5.   The Communists are aware that subversive groups and guerrilla
 units not actively supported by the population cannot long survive unless

 adequately supported from outside sources. Where such support is pro-
 vided, a contest between a guerrilla force and a shaky government becomes
 in effect a contest between the powers which are backing each of them.
 III.     Statement of U. S. Aims
 American policy for the underdeveloped areas must somehow reconcile
 the sometimes conflicting objectives of achieving reasonably steady progress
 toward modernization, maintaining law and order, fostering the working con-
 cept of free government, and encouraging the underdeveloped country to adopt
 a constructive foreign policy stance on the world scene in relation to the East-
 West struggle.
 If these objectives are to be achieved, the pressures of subversive violence
 must be stopped or at least reduced to manageable proportions.  The govern-
 ments, as they face these burdens, must simultaneously be enabled and per-
 suaded to undertake needed social and economic programs and reforms which
 will make possible a higher degree of loyalty to nationhood,  social accommo-
 dation, and economic progress.  There is no firmer lesson in modern American
 experience- -from the. turn of the century experience in the Philippines, through
 wartime Nationalist China, down to Diem--than this:  reform cannot safely wait
 until the guerrillas are suppressed.
 The principal US task is to locate, encourage and nurture those elements
 of national leadership- -political, military and social--which show ability to
 guide and administer the unsettled community and thus to create a measure of

 Approved For Release 2001010  :]IN-FbP89B00552R000100040002-3
 stability and' forward momentuam.  In cases where the threatened nation has a
 somewhat more mature and better developed institutional base, the task of se-
 lecting and encouraging the elements of potential power is substantially simpler.
 On the other hand, these nodes of power are equally obvious to the Communists
 and will, in consequence, be subjected to a more concentrated attack.  The
 further along the hard road to political maturity a nation has travelled the more
 flexible the program of assistance can be, for there are more and stronger foun-
 dations on which to build.
 At the same time the planning and administration of assistance become
 more complex, and the possibilities of imbalance within the growing structure
 increase, bringing new dangers of serious instability; e. g. , in Iran.  Therefore,
 an initial problem to be solved in coping with Communist inspired subversive
 violence is to determine where the points of power and vulnerability lie at the
 time in the nation under attack.  Once this is done we can determine how to
 strengthen those elements which most effectively support our objectives and
 how best to ease the tensions which have created the dangerous vulnerabilities.
 We require a doctrine which begins with a recognition of the revolutionary
 situation we confront as clear-eyed as that of the Communists.  And we require,
 as well, an equally lucid definition of the US objective.
 The American commitment of policy and of faith is roughly this:  We are
 dedicated to the proposition that the revolutionary process of modernization shall
 be permitted to go forward in independence, with increasing degrees of human

 Approved For Release 200l/Q,94g4C(RAAZgP89B00552R000100040002-3
 freedom.    We seek two results:  first, that truly independent nations shall
 emerge on the world scene; and, second, that each nation-will be permitted
 to fashion, out of its own culture and its own ambitions, the kind of modern
 society it wants.  The same religious and philosophical beliefs which decree
 that we respect the uniqueness of each individual, make it natural that we
 respect the uniqueness of each national society.
 Moreover, we are confident--or we are prepared to gamble--that, if the
 independence of this process can be maintained over the coming years and de-
 cades, these societies will choose their':own version of what we would recog-
 nize as a progressively representative and open society.  We are also pre-
 pared to gamble that the resulting societies will recognize the advantages of
 economic and other forms of international cooperation with like-minded nations
 elsewhere.
 In the past there has been considerable and costly ambiguity about the
 American objective.  We have often assisted and subsidized governments in
 states peripheral to the Communist bloc on the simple, but static grounds that
 our own national security required that they resist Communist military pres-
 sure.  This cast of mind--on both sides of the bargain--slowed the moderni-
 zation process and left our partners vulnerable to other forms of Communist
 pres sure.
 Moreover, we have vacillated over the years between a reluctance to inter-
 vene too directly in the internal management of these states and an increasing
 Approved For Release 2001/09/04: CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3
 Approved For Release 2001/09/4: 8IRRPP9B00552R000100040002-3
 sense of. alarm at the inadequate political, military, and administrative steps
 that their governments have made to handle effectively their mounting problems.
 We have no clear doctrine as to how our means of access and influence should
 be applied.
 In some instances our own representatives in the area have not perceived
 clearly enough or early enough the opportunities and dangers in the developing
 situation and, in consequence, our aid and advice has been ill-timed or ill-
 chosen.
 In addition, our government's freedom of action has been occasionally im-
 peded by the more adamant sections of American political opinion which hold
 that any avowed pro-American is better able to meet the particular problems of
 his own country than a more independent leader with perhaps dubious socialist
 tendencies.
 Thus, we have seen conditions worsen in states where the leaders claim
 us as brothers but reject our advice, and, if more progressive, popular or
 forceful regimes replace them, it is all too easy for our enemies to make the
 change appear as a diplomatic defeat for the U. S.
 Against this background we now are attempting to shore-up the strength
 of governments which face internal or foreign supported insurrections, and,
 at the same time, we are using varying forms of influence to persuade them
 to undertake or speed up overdue measures of internal reform.
 This persuasion is a complex and frequently subtle business, for it must
 S E C R E T
 Approved For Release 2001/09/04: CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3
 Approved For Release 2001/W/94Cc    Df?89B00552R000100040002-3
 rest on a current diagnosis of the strengths and weak points of the state which
 may be wholly at variance with the views of the government leaders.  A natural
 reluctance to acknowledge their own failures, a distorted view of their own
 capabilities based on a long continued self-deception, and a gross misunder-
 standing of their assailants' strategy and tactics lead these -leaders to disre-
 gard advice of foreigners who, they feel, do not truly understand their country;
 or, at best, it may lead them to postpone or to dilute changes that must be
 radical and prompt to be effective.
 Moreover, there are often real conflicts between the short-run interests
 of a friendly regime and the imperatives of effective modernization. Reforms
 per se mean a denial of previous privilege.  Since the privileged usually possess
 the power to promote or temporarily to prevent change, their carrying through
 of reforms must result either from enlightened self-interest or desperation.
 Where leaders can be persuaded to make timely and adequate moves toward
 gaining popular support, there is real hope for political viability.  Too often
 governments delay until a real crisis is upon them, and their alternatives are
 narrowed.
 Various forms of rebellion against such governments are now widespread,
 and the effectiveness of insurrection and guerrilla warfare against a shaky and
 unpopular regime has been repeatedly proven.  Where a government has lost
 its basis of popular support, control of such an insurrection requires police-
 state measures.  If the rebels receive substantial outside support and

 encouragement, the government's task is further compounded.
 The problem today is to establish and preserve the basis for progressive
 political modernization, under regimes which effectively maintain their national
 independence, in the regions threatened by Communist aggression below the
 threshold of limited war.  We must find ways to make the non-Communist
 governments not only militarily effective against their ddmestic enemy but
 politically attractive to a working majority of their people, and we must do this
 in the face of a far too widely held belief that we stand against the forces seek-
 ing change and progress.
 If we are to move effectively against the threat of Communist subversive
 violence against the weaker nations, we must see that our varied capabilities--
 civil and military--aredirected toward practical and realizable goals, in parti-
 cular cases; and the civil and military arms must be orchestrated with a full
 sensitivity to the interacting character of the problem.  In the face of this prob-
 lem there is rarely a pure military or a pure civil action.  Although each case
 will be unique, it may be useful to fix on a rationale for such actions which will
 make vigorous US counter-measures both feasible and acceptable to world
 opinion.
 While it is desirable to gain the support- of world opinion wherever possi-
 ble, the final determinant should, however, be the effectiveness of the proposed
 actions in furthering essential US interests.
 Wherever possible, we should increase the effectiveness of our own

 resources by employing them in concert with those of members of international
 organizations, such as the United Nations.  We must, however, be prepared to
 act bilaterally, or possibly unilaterally, in the event that we cannot readily
 achieve a multilateral or bilateral consensus.  Again, getting the job done in
 time to be successful should be our main concern.
 IV.   Recommended US Strategy
 A.  General Observations
 As discussed above, US programs to counter or preferably prevent
 ?
 Communist subversive violence in underdeveloped areas must at the same time
 bring about necessary internal reforms and repress the Communist apparatus
 and its subversive activities.  Where Communist subversion in a country is
 being given direct material and human support from an adjacent controlled
 area, it will also be necessary to consider defensive counter-measures to
 make such third country support difficult or unprofitable for the Communists.
 These three program areas are interrelated, as are the feasible
 measures that can be taken to further them.  The.blend of program activities
 will depend on the assessed requirements of specific country situations.
 Such requirements should take account of: (a) the magnitude or immi-
 nence of the current Communist subversive threat; (b). the ability and willing-
 ness of the Communists to furnish direct material, human, financial and other
 support from adjacent or nearby third countries; (c) the competence of the
 local government and its willingness. to undertake self-help and reform
 15
 S E C R E T

 Approved For Release 2001/094: Cl -RPF 89B00552R000100040002-3
 measures as prerequisites to multilateral or US develor_n.cubl.: aid; (d) the size
 and efficiency of the country's military and internal security forces; (e) the
 country'.s attainments in its modernizing process, including the literacy and
 technical skills of its population, the competence of its civil service and
 governmental social and economic institutions, and the degree to which its
 economic resources have been developed; and (f) the homogeneity of the popu-
 lation and their loyalty to the existing regime.
 In view of the urgency of the remedial program tasks wherever Commu-
 nist subversive violence is present or imminently threatens, all available pro-
 gram resources must be imaginatively and skillfully employed to achieve a
 maximum constructive impact.  In the economic and institutional area, it may
 be possible to supplement official and unilateral overt US economic development
 and technical assistance aid by development loans and technical assistance
 missions from international organizations.  In the military and internal security
 fields, however, it is probable that the main burden will fall on the US.  Where
 the underdeveloped country is allied with or friendly to the US, military and
 security assistance may be furnished overtly under bilateral aid agreements.
 Where Communist insurgents are being actively supported from an adjacent
 third country base, due attention trust be given to the, dangers of escalation in
 determining the kind and level of overt US military assistance.
 Attainment of timely and effective results is, however, the main pro-
 gram determinant in both the civil and military fields.  Covert action measures
 16
 Approved For Release 2001/09/04: CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3
 Approved For Release 2001/03/04 rW-R89B00552R000100040002-3
 should therefore be employed to supplement and reinforce feasible overt pro-
 grams wherever the overt efforts appear unlikely to succeed by themselves.
 As discussed below, covert measures may either be carried out bilaterally
 with the host government or be unilateral US efforts.  Bilateral covert
 measures with the local government may be indicated to enhance the effective-
 ness of overt programs and to carry out activities whose impact would be im-
 paired, or which might invite escalation,  were the US role generally known.
 Unilateral US covert action may be required to bring pressure to bear on the
 local government, its instrumentalities, or on private organizations and in-
 stitutions to help overcome reluctance to adopt needed constructive change.
 B.  Inducing Needed Internal Reforms
 In view of the reluctance of many of the governments and oligarchies of
 threatened countries in underdeveloped areas to initiate reforms and help satisfy
 the rising expectations of the population, we will have to devise more effective
 means of combining overt civil and military with covert instruments to influence
 governmental and other leaders to take the steps necessary for their country's
 preservation and its progressive modernization.  Our active participation in the

 This is particularly important and unfortunate in situations such as

 and political frustration of groups growing in strength encourages subversive

 willingness and ability to enforce and assist in some tough structural changes

 national interest.
 In our desire to assure smooth short-run relations with transitional
 oligarchies, we often tend to forget that they have no rational alternative to
 going along with our recommendations, particularly if we insist on specific re-
 forms as prerequisites to our continuing to provide them with aid.  We must re-
 cognize, however, the deepseated emotional, cultural,. and proprietary resist-

 viewed.  Hence, we must exert greater influence than in the past through more
 concerted orchestrated use of the diplomatic, military, and covert instruments
 available to us.  Only thus can we speed up our friends' progress toward ending
 social injustices and establishing political and economic patterns which can sur-

 In bringing the needed greater influence to bear on the governments and
 institutions of friendly underdeveloped areas, we have at our disposal a varied
 array of overt as well as covert resources.  The challenge-is to use them
 imaginatively and effectively.
 Before considering individual program capabilities, it is desirable
 to note that vitalization of a country's political life and processes is quite
 as important as introduction of the economic and social reforms essential
 to meaningful modernization.  Reform and enforcement of tax collection on
 the basis of ability to pay,  changes in land tenure and labor relationships,
 more effective fiscal and monetary management, and introduction of the con-

 attitudes and loyalties if the people still regard the central government as a
 remote and unapproachable alien institution not responsive to their ideas and
 grievances.  This sense of distance and frustration will be increased if the
 electoral system is obviously rigged and if there are insufficient channels of
 open communication between the government and the governed.
 In many transitional societies, social and educational conditions are
 insufficiently advanced to recommend broadly-based political democracy, but
 .it is important that the mass of the population regard the central government
 as a benevolent friend responsive to their needs and aspirations.  There

 should also be ro9m for diversity of opinion, a healthy non=Communist political
 opposition if possible, or at least channels for protest and means for redressing
 grievances.
 The post-war experience in the Philippines illustrates some political
 and organizational devices that can play a highly constructive role in winning
 the grass-roots popular support so necessary for frustrating a subversive guer-
 rilla movement.  Following the 1949 presidential election, which was widely re-
 garded as dishonest, the Communist=infl uenced Huk guerrillas argued that the
 only way the government could really be changed was by popular force.  By
 1951, the Huks had a guerrilla strength of 15, 000 and a mass base of about a
 million supporters and sympathizers, mostly tenant farmers on Luzon.
 Under Magsaysay's leadership, the Philippine Army undertook to win
 back popular support from the guerrillas by holding a new and demonstrably
 free and honest election and by inaugurating new administrative and organiza-
 tional procedures to demonstrate the new Government's concern for the popular
 welfare.  The elections were held with secret balloting and freedom of ex-
 pression and movement for candidates of all parties.  The results were ac-
 cepted as valid because a number of administration opponents were elected,'
 and the people came to feel that the new government was their own, to be
 supported against the armed rebellion seeking to overthrow it.  By 1953, the
 Huk guerrillas were reduced from 15, 000 to 300.  Only 34, 000 Filipino troops
 were employed in military operations against the Huks (as contrasted with the

 200, 000 South Vietnamese troops engaged against 20-40, 000 Viet Cong guer-
 rillas, and the 150, 000 Greek troops that were employed against 25, 000 Greek
 guerrillas).
 Magsaysay reinforced his military and national electoral efforts with
 an administrative innovation whereby any citizen who felt he had a legitimate
 grievance against the central government, its local provincial officials, or
 the military was encouraged to wire the details, at "a very nominal cost, to the
 Philippine War Department.  All such complaints were investigated without
 delay and acted on as the facts indicated.
 Magsaysay also initiated a program of community development in the
 outlying areas to stimulate local initiative, assisted by the central govern-
 ment, to find cooperative solutions to community social and economic prob-
 lems.  This supplemented and reinforced central government land redistri-
 bution programs and other social and economic reforms.  Magsaysay also
 insisted that the Army seek to identify itself with the interests of the peasants
 and use its resources to further social and economic development wherever
 possible.  These measures were communicated to the people by an effective
 and imaginative information program.

 ble in other underdeveloped areas now facing the reality or threat of subversive
 Communist violence.
 1.     Overt Programs
 The Magsaysay program in the Philippines actually involved both  25X1C
 guidance and assistance.  The program was, however, made possible be-
 cause of the personal attitudes and characteristics of Magsaysay, who
 combined the qualities of a natural popular leader with strong anti-
 Communist and pro-US convictions and openmindedness toward political
 innovation and social and economic reforms.  In other underdeveloped or
 transitional countries under the threat of Communist subversive violence
 where the chief of state or prime minister has similar attitudes and
 characteristics, it should be possible for us to employ our overt foreign
 affairs program resources to good effect in fostering and supporting a
 Magsaysay-type program:
 a.  Diplomacy.  Even in its narrow sense as the formal govern-
 ment-to-government relations between sovereign states through their
 diplomatic establishments, diplomacy can set the tone of inter-
 governmental collaboration and facilitate the various forms of co-
 operative association that may be undertaken.  It is of great im-
 portance in countries with transitional problems that our principal

 diplomatic representatives be able to establish and maintain sym-
 pathic personal rapport with the chief of state and principal leaders
 of the country.  This rapport should be grounded on a deep under-
 standing of the country's problems and traditions, but it should not
 be attained at the expense of realistic objectivity toward the current
 historical processes impinging on the society as a whole.  If there is
 sufficient mutual personal respect, our diplomatic representatives
 should be able to speak bluntly and persuasively about reform needs
 and to sell constructive proposals on the Magsaysay pattern.
 b.   Official AID Civil Economic Development and Technical
 Assistance Programs.   Well-conceived civil economic and technical
 assistance country programs, staffed by qualified and effective
 American personnel, should be able not only to advance agreed bi-
 lateral project aims, but also to influence the receptivity of the
 middle and lower governmental functionaries to institutional and
 policy changes.  As AID officers will be functioning in part among
 the' population at large, the image they present and the ideas they
 express can help induce a popular climate of support for construc-
 tive innovation.                           This is the more likely to the extent that they can
 help stimulate and channelize local popular initiatives into self-help
 community projects and induce a sense of local responsibility.
 c.   Military Advisory-and Assistance Programs. In addition

 to their more conventional role in strengthening a friendly foreign
 country's armed forces for defensive military and counter-guerrilla
 operations and as deterrent force, our Military Advisory and Assist-
 ance Groups (MAAGs) abroad have the opportunity to indoctrinate and
 guide the local military forces to assume a constructive civic role in
 the modernization of their country.  Perhaps because of our different
 Western history and educational tradition, we tend to forget that a
 properly trained and utilized military arm can be extremely helpful
 in advancing the national unity, educational level, and economic de-
 velopment of underdeveloped states where such attainments have not
 existed.
 In the course of their training soldiers can become literate
 and can achieve an understanding of national unity, self-discipline,
 and obligation to serve the public welfare which the general populations
 often lack.  They can learn many technical trades and crafts which will
 materially increase their value as citizens of the developing nation
 when their military terms expire.  In short, the armed forces can
 often serve as stop-gap but effective primary and secondary school
 systems while increasing their military effectiveness.
 The military services' own need for improved communi-
 cations, transportation lines, and general construction is but a part
 of their country's more general need for the same facilities..   In

 addition. to satisfying purely military needs, the local armed services
 can be effectively employed, if there is forethought and planning, to
 construct needed civil roads, telephone lines, and airfields which
 would serve the general population in time of peace and increase the
 defensive military capability in the event of civil disturbances or
 external aggression.  Much as done in the US by our own Army
 Engineers, the local armed services can also help improve the lot
 of the farmers and the general population through flood-control,
 crop-spraying, irrigation, and reclamation projects.
 A conscious program of troop indoctrination and military-
 civil relations projects can also reinforce the material civil contri-
 butions of the armed forces by increasing the sense of identification
 between the outlying civil population and the country's national
 governmental impetus toward economic and social advancement and
 national solidarity as personified by the armed forces.  As the mem-
 bers of the armed forces will probably be drawn from all parts of the
 country, a military-civil relations program, including social and
 hospitality activities, can help break down inter-tribal and inter-
 regional prejudices and increase popular loyalty to the nation and its
 government.
 A broad approach by the military toward meeting civil re-
 quirements will directly assist in easing the tensions and strains of

 early national growth and bring the army of the central government
 and the people into a new and more constructive relationship.  The
 constructive potential of the local military is thus one of the greatest
 unexploited assets of the non-Communist world.  This is in striking
 contrast with the pattern that has too often prevailed where senior
 military officers in underdeveloped states have grossly misused
 their power and their relatively advanced educational backgrounds
 to warp and retard civil government.
 Achievement of a constructive military-civil relationship
 will not only substantially further modernization and lessen the
 popular civil vulnerability to subversive Communist appeals, but
 also greatly strengthen the capabilities of the military forces in
 actively combatting Communist -inspired subversive violence and
 guerrilla warfare; deprived of logistical, recruiting, and intelligence
 support from the countryside, the guerrillas will be forced on the
 defensive.
 An imaginative and broad-gauge MAAG program along these
 lines can assuredly pay big dividends if the local government is at all
 responsive to such ideas.

 governmental and social institutions that are prerequisites to moderniza-
 tion.  In some cases, as in the Congo, the local leadership is responsive
 to the need for change but lacks the background and competence to take
 needed steps on its own initiative.  In other cases, a frustrating and
 exasperating problem in countries severely threatened by Communist
 political and military subversion and plagued by outmoded political,
 economic, and social systems is the reluctance--bordering on blind
 obstinacy- -of the governmental leaders to admit the need for reform or
 to take effective initiatives to this end.
 In both cases, the traditional and internationally accepted tools
 of government-to-government diplomacy and bilateral or multilateral
 economic, public administration, and military aid programs--dependent
 as they are on acceptance by the local government, or in the Congo by
 international opinion--are unlikely by themselves to provide the guidance
 or to achieve the reforms essential to winning broadly-based popular
 support for the national regime and thus undercutting the basis for Commu-
 nist strength and influence.  In such situations, the broad range of covert
 action measures available to us offers our best and only chance of increas-
 ing our leverage and achieving needed changes in time to frustrate Commu-
 nist ambitions, short of an open and costly military confrontation.
 In the first instance, the problem is to demonstrate to the popu-
 lation at large that there is a constructive impetus for progress alternative

 to the Communist prescription for solving their problems and meeting their
 aspirations.  To these ends, supplementing official US governmental efforts,
 there is the need to strengthen the influence and effectiveness of those ele-
 ments of the government, the political parties, social institutions, and
 public information media that favor non-Communist development and re-
 forms.  It is often the case that the personalities, groups, and infor-
 mation media that favor such ideas and have a potentially wide popular
 appeal lack both the resources and the know-how to ;compete effectively
 with either the subsidized instrumentalities of the regime or the well-
 financed and centrally-directed agitators and fronts of the Communists.
 It would clearly be contrary to US diplomatic tradition and ac-
 cepted international practices for a US Mission openly or attributably
 to subsidize and advise elements of the incumbent government not fully
 in sympathy with local policies, or likewise to assist parties and influential
 persons in active opposition outside the government.  The open identifica-
 tion of such persons and groups with the US would also materially lessen
 their appeal and persuasiveness.  Experience has amply shown, however,
 that through suitable covert operational methodology it is possible with
 minimal risk significantly to increase the effectiveness of such leaders,
 political parties, institutional groups, and information media, either to
 strengthen governmental institutions or to induce changes in govern-
 mental policies.  This may involve the use as funding and guidance

 Through such covert measures, it is possible to vitalize organized
 and broadly-based political pressures on and within the reluctant local
 government.  It is also possible, by strengthening the non-Communist
 voices and their organizational tactics in such institutional groups,  to
 wrest Communist control from the local labor movement, peasants' as-
 sociations, and youth and student organizations.  Equally important, such
 measures can demonstrate to the people that there is active concern about
 their and their country's problems and that it is not only the Communists
 who favor progress and are prepared to do something about it.  This es-
 sentially psychological effect may be almost as important in destroying
 the mass base for Communist subversive violence as tangible social and
 economic advances, though these must not be too, long delayed.
 Covert or non-attributable programs may also be used to good
 effect in direct bilateral cooperation with the local chief of state and a
 few other top officials.  This presupposes areas of inter-governmental

 eager to accept US aid in strengthening their armed forces and their capabi-

 particularly AID's Overseas Internal Security program (OISP), will normally
 be essentially overt, although the operational security implications of counter-
 intelligence and counter-espionage investigations and operations will limit
 public knowledge of the US role in this area.  This also applies to certain
 aspects of counter-guerrilla training and techniques.  It may also prove neces-
 sary to draw on the skills of American personnel whose status (with CIA or
 other agencies) recommends close control of their identification.  But the
 sum of such US aid is essentially overt in that the general fact of official
 American participation will not be denied, although some details may be

 The most thorny policy problem for US military advisers in many
 underdeveloped countries is to convince the chief of state that his armed
 forces should be organized, trained, and equipped to deal with the peculiar
 requirements of guerrilla warfare and subversion, rather than as a vehicle
 for national prestige.  In the nature of modern conventional. warfare and the
 strength and quality of conventional forces at the disposal of the Communist
 Blpc states, it is not to be expected that the relatively limited forces of an
 underdeveloped country could achieve an independent capability for resisting
 open external Communist aggression.  In countries like Iran, however, the
 chiefs of state often view their armed forces as reflections of their own
 authority and prestige, and they divert funds from sorely needed internal
 development and reform projects for a military establishment which neither
 provides true security against external threats nor is suited for meeting
 concerted internal subversion or guerrilla actions.
 Experience in current and earlier campaigns against Communist
 guerrilla forces in Laos, South Vietnam, Indo-China, China, Greece, Malaya,
 etc., has shown that a relatively small guerrilla force can immobilize and in
 some cases defeat a vastly larger conventional force if the guerrillas have
 popular civil support in their areas and can maintain the tactical initiative.
 Even where the rural population is basically anti-Communist and loyal to
 the central government, Communist terror tactics can coerce their involun-
 tary support.

 ? Communist guerrilla insurgents can be defeated within acceptable
 cost only by tailoring the counter-guerrilla forces to employ guerrilla-type
 tactics and to keep the Communist guerrillas under unrelenting pressure.  A
 static area defense system whereby government forces attempt to seal off
 the guerrilla's supply routes and simultaneously defend all strategic instal-
 lations and communications lines that the guerrillas may attack leads to a
 dispersion of forces and leaves the tactical initiative to the guerrillas. The
 answer is not a larger defense force, whether local or augmented by US or
 Allied troops, but a different system of organization and tactics.
 Part of the answer lies in creating specially-trained and highly
 mobile counter-guerrilla units of the police and the uniformed conventional
 military forces.  Such units should be prepared for deployment by parachute
 or helicopter; should be skilled in jungle and mountain warfare, ranger.. .
 tactics, and night patrolling; and should make full use of aerial reconnais-
 sance and air tactical and logistical support.
 This is unlikely'to be sufficient of itself, however, as long as the
 Communist guerrillas can fade into the countryside and can be sheltered,
 fed, and provided intelligence by their sympathizers among the civil popu-
 lation.                        The problems of winning the basic loyalties of, the civil population
 from the Communists have been adequately explored above, but there re-

 The selling of this kind of counter-guerrilla doctrine to the threatened

 we are faced with the patently unjust situation that the physical destruction
 and human misery stemming from actions to counter the Communist threat
 will be limited to the soil of the victim.  The situation also places us in the
 militarily and tactically disadvantageous position of being unable to destroy
 or neutralize the enemy's base and source of strength.
 We have generally felt deterred, however, in situations short of
 declared and formal hostilities between sovereign states, from carrying the
 military conflict onto the territory of the third-:country. This, of course,
 plays into the Communist pretense that violent upheavals in a threatened
 country are of strictly indigenous origin.  Our reluctance to take offensive
 countermeasures, except for occasional limited and non-attributable covert
 operations, has stemmed in part from concern lest an escalation and widen-
 ing of the conflict result, and in part from strictures imposed by US ad-
 herance to the doctrine of non-intervention.
 The United States (and virtually all other nations) has always
 historically supported the doctrine of non-intervention in the internal af-
 fairs of other nations.  It has occasionally been suggested that our vigorous,
 and often self-righteous, public support of this doctrine inhibits us in efforts
 to counter Communist subversion and Communist use, of violence, especially
 in the underdeveloped nations, and that we should therefore consider some
 modification of the doctrine.
 The counter argument seems, however, not only to have more.

 support within the US Government but also to have greater validity.  It is to
 the effect that the doctrine of non-intervention, even though universally
 flouted by the Communists, nevertheless is more valuable to us than to them.
 The reasoning is that although the open societies of the West are less success-
 ful than the Communist societies in practicing covert intervention while publicly
 adhering to a doctrine of non-intervention, nevertheless the public doctrine
 does exercise considerable restraint on the Communists.  Since it is alleged
 that the Communists, if unrestrained, would have a vastly greater capability
 of violent intervention than the West, the conclusion is that the West can well
 afford to accept a greater restraint on the use of its lesser capability in order
 to maintain a greater degree of restraint on the Communists' very much
 greater capability.
 This appears to be the reasoning behind what might be described
 as the cold-blooded case for continuing publicly to uphold the doctrine of
 non-intervention.  A more powerful pragmatic case is simply that this
 doctrine has acquired such wide respectability and appeal that the US could
 not propose publicly to modify or weaken it without paying an unacceptably
 ,heavy price.  Accordingly, it is probably not worthwhile to debate whether if
 we threw off some of the restraints we could not develop a capability fully
 equal to that of the Communists.  Realistically, our public commitment to
 the doctrine of non-intervention has to be accepted as a fact of life.
 Taking this as a starting point, however, an ingenious application

 Approved For Release 2001/0 /94 j - Dp89B00552R000100040002-3
 and extension of the doctrine is proposed.  It can be expressed in the following
 propositions:
 1.   Since all nations accept the doctrine of non-intervention, the
 US is going to treat the activities of any nation which incites and sup-
 ports violence within another nation as a form of aggression morally
 equivalent to the military crossing of a border.
 2.   When a situation arises in which this subversive form of
 aggression is threatened or is being practiced, the US will generally
 ?
 favor the use of international control machinery to halt it, provided
 such machinery can be made to operate with full effectiveness.
 3.   If, however, in the face of clear evidence that violence is
 being supported across an international border, the establishment
 of international machinery to curb this type of aggression is opposed,
 or the machinery is ineffective, the US reserves the right to employ
 force (or to support the employment of force) up to at least the same
 scope and level in defense of the threatened nation.
 4.   Any such unilateral use of force by the US, or with US
 support, will be strategically a defensive action.  That is to say,
 its purpose will be to induce a cessation of the subversive aggression
 to which it is a response.
 5.   Nevertheless, in taking such action the US will not deny it-
 self (or its friends) the advantage of the tactical offensive, nor will

 it limit itself to weapons of the enemy's choosing.  Specifically, it
 will feel free . to incite and support violence within the aggressor's
 territory and to use weapons in which it has an advantage, but will
 endeavor to avoid major escalation of the scale of violence or sophis-
 tication of weapons.
 In the above form, this doctrine is proposed both as a policy to
 guide the US response to situations of violence and as a rationale which
 would underlie the public posture of the US.  A's.a rationale this amounts
 to an assertion that the US (a) takes the doctrine of non-intervention so
 seriously that it is going to treat violent intervention as the equivalent of
 overt aggression, and (b) recognizes the right of any country which is the
 victim of subversive violence to practice subversive violence in its own de-
 fense.  It may well be asked whether this is not a justification for a declara-
 tion of war by the victim of subversion against the aggressor.  It could of
 course, be just that.  But the essence of the doctrine is that, because sub-
 versive violence involves the use of force for purposes of aggression but
 on a scale considerably less than that typical of a declared war, it is neces-
 sary to recognize the right of the victim to use force on a similarly limited
 scale in its own defense.  It could well be argued that unless either this
 remedy of the unilateral limited use of force or the preferred remedy
 of effective international policing is available,  then the doctrine of
 non-intervention operates one-sidedly to benefit the nation that undertakes
 violent subversion.  In a situation like that existing between Communist

 Northern Vietnam and South -Vietnam, it would be difficult to justify to what
 is called "world opinion" a declaration of war by South Vietnam as a response
 to the guerrilla activity of the Viet Cong within its own borders.  A declared
 war would indeed involve a major escalation of the scale of violence as well
 as serious danger of a widening of the conflict.  Under these circumstances,
 a persuasive case could be made to the effect that the doctrine of noninter-
 vention should not deny South Vietnam a remedy against this form of
 aggression.
 As an operational policy, this doctrine has important implications
 for US action in situations of the type to which it is intended to apply:
 1.   First, it puts a premium on acquiring persuasive proof that
 subversive violence is being employed in a particular situation.  The
 test set up in this doctrine is that support is being provided and con-
 trol exercised across a border.  The aggressor country in such a
 situation has always claimed that the violent resistance is a purely
 indigenous revolution.  Persuasive proof will presumably have to
 take the form of intercepting communications or of prisoners who
 can be produced in sufficient numbers or df captured boats, trucks,
 or aircraft.  If the support being rendered across. the border is in a
 mild enough form (for instance limited to money payments), it will
 usually not be worthwhile to try to invoke this doctrine.
 2.   The most interesting concept in the doctrine is that of the
 S E C R E T

 Approved For Release 2001/09/?0 cC {4-$Dp89B00552R000100040002-3
 tactical offensive and of independence in the choice of weapons.  As to
 the former, the advantages of carrying the war to the enemy's country
 are obvious.  It is particularly unjust that the population which supplies
 most of the victims in guerrilla warfare should be that of the victim of
 aggression while the aggressor's people-and lands are untroubled.  As
 to the latter, it is indeed high time that we applied ingenuity to the
 choosing or the development of weapons which involve no..mdjoresca-
 lation in the degree of sophistication but in which for one reason or
 another our friends have a relative  advantage in a given situation.
 For instance, small boat operations may be much easier in certain
 situations than the infiltration of guerrillas into enemy territory by
 land.  We may be able to develop weapons (other than conventional
 bombs) that could be used from aircraft with effects having some
 similarity to those of sabotage carried out by teams on the ground.
 Finally, although the doctrine as here -stated makes no specific re-
 ference to covert activities, it has an important application to them.  It
 would lose much of its value as operational policy unless, in its aspect as
 a rationale, it became widely known.  Accordingly, it must be assumed
 that, even if not in some official manner announced by the US Government,
 public expression would be given to the rationale in various ways. This
 would have two implications.  On the one hand, it would permit the US to
 support more or less openly certain activities which, without such rationale,

 Approved For Release 2001/0'?/CF4 CCFA-kD'89B00552R000100040002-3
 can be supported only covertly.  In this way, the vague disclosure of the
 doctrine would permit the realm of covert paramilitary action to be narrowed.
 On the other hand, the political risks of certain covert actions would be signi-
 ficantly reduced, since a rationale for such actions would have been made
 known publicly.
 Taking these two implications into account, it seems likely that it
 would still be desirable for tactically offensive actions, those involving the
 support of violence within the territory of the enemy, to be done in such a
 manner as to be at least officially disclaimable.  The whole reason for limit-
 ing the scale and technical sophistication of a paramilitary action taken in re-
 sponse to violent subversion is to avoid escalation.  This advantage is lost if
 an offensive operation against the aggressor is conducted in such a manner
 as to compel him to regard it as a formal act of war.  Unless, therefore,
 the enormous advantages of being free to employ the tactical offensive are
 to be foregone, every precaution should be taken to make such acts symmet-
 rical' in form, as well as in scale and technical sophistication, to the strate-
 gic offensive originally mounted by the aggressor.  This would usually re-
 quire that the acts be disclaimable but, with the proposed new rationale, it
 is far less important that they be truly covert.
 Application of this doctrine to the problems of negating externally-
 supported Communist inspired subversive violence in non-Communist
 underdeveloped countries should be actively considered.  Apart from the

 Approved For Release 2001/05/0% C R-ROW89B00552R000100040002-3
 issues of the doctrine of non-intervention and the risks of escalation, however,
 there are several other factors that should be evaluated. before undertaking
 specific operations against a Communist-controlled third-country base. These
 factors mainly concern the objectives to be achieved and the likelihood of at-
 taining them without involving ourselves in implicit commitments that are
 greater than we wish to assume.
 Offensive countermeasures are primarily intended as diversionary
 and harassment operations.  They will serve as distractions and nuisances
 to facilitate achieving a defensive victory elsewhere.  The enemy will have
 to deploy his forces both to contain these outbursts and to assure that any
 resultant unrest does not become the preliminary to a serious liberation
 movement.  If an area where these activities are taking place explodes in
 the Communist face, as did Budapest, we will have some quick decisions to
 make on the pros and cons of exploiting the break, and we should be pre-
 pared to do so if it appears advisable.  But the concept presumes that the
 operations will have achieved their purpose of diverting enemy forces from
 the offensive long before the boiling point of true popular insurrection is
 reached.
 Here perhaps lies the main point of contention of the concept.  It
 can be argued that if the enemy leaders believe there is real likelihood of
 their losing territory or being overthrown, the dangers of escalation through
 their over-reacting to the threat will increase sharply, and the policy of
 Approved For Release 2001/09/04: CIA-RDP89B00552R000100040002-3
 Approved For Release 2001/0?/0# :CCIA-kDFT89B00552R000100040002-3
 offensive countermeasures will become almost unpredictably dangerous.  The
 other side of this argument is that only a serious danger of losing control of
 a region will force the Communists to shift significant effort from other activi-
 ties and that a succession of raids and minor depredations will not gain mean-
 ingful ends.
 If indeed offensive countermeasures are successful only as diversions,
 and if the people of the region where they are undertaken cannot hope for the
 sustained large scale outside assistance needed to push'through a successful
 insurrection, those people are more likely to be sullen than rebellious.   A
 community which rises and fails in revolt loses its leaders and suffers
 grievously.  Once burned they are thereafter twice wary.  No matter how
 unpopular a Communist regime may be we cannot expect much help from the
 people in fighting it if we do not propose to see that the regime is overthrown.
 As T. E. Lawrence wrote of motivations in another revolt, "Freedom is a
 pleasure only to be tasted by a man alive".
 Under some circumstances in Communist areas, it may not be
 practical to count on the measure of local support essential to indigenous
 guerrillas even though they receive material aid from the outside,  Hence,
 many offensive countermeasures will depend in lame: part on the work of
 specially trained men or groups introduced into the aggressor country to
 operate on a largely self-sufficient basis.  While these groups may some-
 times work with dissident local elements when such exist, they will have

 Approved For Release 2001/0
 ,C: ClaF  F%9B00552R000100040002-3
 few sources of information once they are in the field.  This will place heavy
 and exacting loads on indigenous intelligence nets already organized and work-
 ing in the area, and great care must be taken to assure that these nets are not
 compromised by direct association with the operating groups.         The size of the
 groups committed to operations of this type can vary from the single agent up
 to whatever point the current risks of sharp escalation will bear.
 Whatever the built-in limitations on cross-border operations, how-
 ever, they may well be advantageous for us.  They will offer the tactical values
 of destroying or disrupting supply lines and logistical installations vital to the
 Communist guerrillas and of causing some lessening or diversion of the
 Communist effort.  They may also demonstrate to the people of the threatened
 country that its government, and such friendly non-Communist foreign powers
 as are supporting it, are resolved to carry the conflict to a successful con-
 clusion and to reduce as far as possible the human and material losses of the
 friendly population. The psychological and political implications of this effect
 should reinforce the impact. of our other overt and covert development and
 counter-subversion measures.
 The successful orchestration of the total strategy discussed in this-
 report may be expected to win the needed grass-roots. popular support, to
 facilitate the negative aspects of countering Communist subversion and guer-
 rilla operations, and to achieve a viable basis for sound long-term economic
 growth and social and political development.

 V.   Conclusions
 1.   Serious Communist intent and capability to press forward with the
 technique of subversive intervention, often extending to guerrilla warfare in
 various underdeveloped countries or regions, confront the US with a critical
 problem which will persist through the Sixties.
 2.   However, despite the clear consensus within the US Government
 as to the magnitude and urgency of this problem, we are not yet organzied
 to help threatened countries to deal adequately with it.  We have at our dis-
 posal a variety of potential resources and programs for facilitating the pre-
 vention of Communist subversive violence and for repressing active guer-
 rillas, but these have not yet been harnessed by a unifying concept of
 operations, high level focus on the problem, and greater impetus to the
 development of programs commensurate to the need.
 3.   Such policies and programs cut across a wide spectrum of exist-
 ing agency responsibilities.  In particular, they will require concerted and
 carefully focussed civil and military actions by the State and Defense De-
 partments, AID, USIA, and CIA.
 4.   But there is no single high-level locus of authority and responsi-
 bility within the Executive Branch to undertake this vitally needed concert-
 ing of inter-agency resources.  There is no present coordinating mechanism,
 short of the NSC, which is empowered to provide the needed centralized direc-
 tion 'of. effort, and there is none which is devoting a significant share of its

 energies to the peculiar requirements of the guerrilla warfare challenge and to
 its . inter-agency program implications.  Except for such country Task Forces
 as have been constituted in specific instances, there are no mechanisms for
 focussing Government-wide resources on identifying and finding solutions to
 the unique problems of particular countries.  Moreover, present Task Forces
 for critical areas have lacked a source of guidance and support on the special
 problems of preventing and dealing with Communist subversive violence, and
 they have not always focussed sufficiently on these aspects.
 5.   Therefore, the most immediate need is for adequate institutional
 arrangements to ensure continuing focus on and attention to the problem at a
 high governmental level.  Because of its responsibilities in directly related
 fields and because the agencies chiefly concerned are already represented
 on it, expansion of the mandate of the NSC Special Group seems the most
 effective way to carry out this function.
 6.   New arrangements are also needed to facilitate the stepping-up
 or reorientation of existing departmental and agency programs to achieve
 maximum effectiveness in those countries where the need is most critical,
 and to enable us to anticipate future needs.  However, action responsibility'
 for programs to prevent or counter subversive violence should continue to
 rest with the appropriate departments and agencies.  Most of these programs
 also involve broader objectives.  The preventive aspects of our diplomatic,
 economic aid,overt informational, and certain covert programs on behalf of

 social, economic, and political progress in threatened countries are inevitably
 closely related to the totality of US foreign policy toward such countries.
 VI.   Recommendations
 Accordingly it is proposed that:
 1.    The NSC Special Group, chaired by the Military Representative of the
 President, should be given the additional responsibility of providing focus and
 direction to interdepartmental programs for coping with threats of Communist
 subversive intervention, actual and potential, in nations and areas abroad which
 the President considers critical.  Where appropriate, the Directors of the Agency
 for International Development and the US Information Agency would be invited to
 participate in Special Group deliberations in this field.
 2.   As a first step, the Special Group should recommend a directive de-
 limiting and defining the new scope of its responsibility, to include the designa-
 tion of the specific areas where subversive violence or guerrilla warfare is
 either already a major factor (e. g. , South Vietnam, Laos, Colombia) or a
 potentially serious threat (e.g., Thailand, Iran, Bolivia).  The designation
 criteria should be rigorously narrow so as to focus attention and resources on
 only the few most critical situations.
 3.   For countries or regions determined by the NSC Special Group to
 be critically threatened by Communist subversive violence and approved by
 the President for assignment to its jurisdiction, the Secretary of State in co-
 ordination with the department heads should constitute inter-agency country

 or regional Task Forces in Washington (if not already in being), charged with
 the development and review of integrated action programs to deal with Commu-
 nist violence or its threat in their geographic areas.  The Task Forces would
 normally be chaired by senior State Department geographic officers at the
 Assistant Secretary level.  If the endangered country is in an active US Military
 Theater of Operations or if the NSC Special Group determines that the military
 aspects of the country situation predominate, the Defense Department should
 assume the chairmanship.    Members would be formally assigned and regard
 as primary their duties on the Task Force..-. Task Forces would report to and
 be under the guidance of the NSC Special Group on matters bearing directly on
 Communist-inspired violence.
 4.   In countries designated as critically threatened, the Country Teams
 should be charged with developing and forwarding integrated program recom-
 mendations and with ensuring effective local coordination in the execution of
 approved programs to counter the threat.  The Country Teams would submit
 their recommendations and reports through normal channels to the chairmen
 of the competent Task Forces, who would keep the NSC Special Group informed
 of plans and progress.
 5.   The Special Group should also be responsible. for focussing increased
 attention on those aspects of broader US Government programs which generate
 resources for the prevention or neutralization of Communist subversive inter-
 vention, e.g., Military Assistance Program (MAP), Overseas Internal Security

 Program (OISP), certain s.pecialized military forces and covert action programs..
 It should interest itself in the following types of problems, drawing on the in-
 formational resources and special skills of the various departments and agencies
 as appropriate:
 a.   The organization, equipment, funds, doctrine,- and techniques
 required to improve the capabilities of designated threatened countries for in-
 ternal security and counter-guerrilla measures.  This may involve strengthen-
 ing or initiating OISP activities, reorienting MAP activities to give increased
 emphasis to the counter-guerrilla training and equipping mission, or the pro-
 vision of new authority, funds, facilities, personnel and equipment for CIA
 counter-guerrilla paramilitary operations.
 b.   Ways in which MAP and MAAG activities in threatened countries,
 possible supplemented by AID and CIA capabilities, can help realize the con-
 structive economic and political potentialities of civic action by the armed
 forces of the countries.
 c.   The adequacy of current appropriations, fiscal procedures, and
 enabling legislation to satisfy indicated program needs, with possible requests
 for new Congressional authority to permit inter-agency transfers of funds and
 achieve greater flexibility for counter-violence aid programs.
 6.    While action responsibility for programs related to preventing or
 countering subversive violence would remain in existing departments and
 agencies, it is appropriate that the Special Group be authorized to comment

 Approved For Release 2001109%k-: ?lA-F%PT89B00552R000100040002-3
 or submit recommendations on the particular implications of such programs
 for the critical problems of deterring Communist subversions, and violence,
 .,T
 especially for the shorter-term purposes of winning local popular support
 away from the Communists.  The Special Group would provide focus on
 counter-subversion implications of departmental critical area planning both
 through its collective guidance to the critical area Task Forces and through
 the instructions of individual Special Group members to their own area repre-
 sentatives through their respective departmental and agency channels.  The
 Special Group would also review integrated critical area program proposals,
 prepared by the Task Forces in coordination with the senior US field repre-
 sentative, and would approve them for execution if they fall within existing
 policy.  In the event of inter-agency disagreements, or actions requiring
 fresh policy determinations, the Special Group members would refer them
 to their respective principals.
 7.  Once a critical area inter-agency program had been approved, the
 Special Group would monitor its execution both through the appropriate Task
 Forces and through the departmental /agency channels of Special Group
 members.  The main contribution of the Task Forces in the monitoring and
 review process would be in providing collective judgments, by country or
 region, on the adequacy of program objectives and achievements in relation
 to the problems of preventing or countering subversive violence.
 8.   In view of the sensitivity of. covert action programs and the special

 procedures  in effect for.:- authorizing and reviewing them, covert aspects of
 counter-guerrilla warfare country and regional program planning and execution
 would be handled through special channels.
 9.   In considering action programs to counter Communist subversive
 intervention in designated critical areas, the Special Group'and Task Forces
 should give attention to the possibilities for "offensive counter-measures",
 as discussed on pp. 33-43 of this report.
