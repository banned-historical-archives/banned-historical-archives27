 PORTUGAL: ANTI-COMMUNIST GAINS
 Anti-Communist officers have improved
 their position in the Portuguese military govern-
 ment in the wake of the political decline of
 pro-Communist, General Goncalves. The extent
 of the gains made by the anti-Communist An-
 tunes faction will be clearer, however, when a
 new government is formed to replace Goncalves'
 Communist-leaning cabinet.
 The Antunes group, refusing to accept Costa
 Comes' efforts to keep Goncalves in a leadership
 position as armed forces chief of staff, resorted to
 pressure tactics to ensure his ouster. The show-
 down came at the September 5 meeting of the
 Armed Forces General Assembly. At the urging of
 the Antunes faction, the army and air force
 boycotted the assembly, sending only the chiefs
 of the two services to demand Goncalves' dis-
 missal. A communique was issued after a "rump
 session" of the assembly, announcing that Gon-
 calves had decided to "decline" the armed forces
 chief of staff post.
 Goncalves' decision to back down was not a
 clearcut victory for the anti-Communists. The
 revised membership of the Revolutionary Council
 appears to reflect concessions to all factions, with
 major representatives of both the Goncalves and
 Antunes factions left out. There was speculation
 that President Costa Comes had again attempted
 to arrange a compromise that would prevent any
 faction from attaining complete superiority. One
 source told US embassy officials that Costa Comes
 was interested in maintaining a role for the Com-
 munists in order to reinforce his own position as a
 mediator between warring factions.
 The anti-Communist group associated with
 Antunes appears to have a plurality of votes on
 the council. In the first meeting of the revamped
 council on September 8 the council decided to
 appoint Antunes-supporter Lourenco to head a
 committee to reorganize both the Revolutionary
 Council and the left-leaning General Assembly to
 make them representative of the Movement.
 They also voted to reinstate anti-Communist
 leaders Antunes and Alves on the council, but

 balanced their addition somewhat by also adding
 former council member Costa Martins-a Gon-
 calves sympathizer.
 The council demonstrated a determination to
 cement its renewed authority by strictly limiting
 press coverage of military events, a decision that
 brought cries of censorship by the Communist
 Party and the Communist-influenced press. The
 council further prohibited contact with the press
 by any military figure other than council members
 in an effort to prevent public statements by Gon-
 calves or other pro-Communist officers.
 The composition of the new cabinet now be-
 ing formed by Prime Minister-designate Azevedo
 will indicate whether the anti-Communists have
 indeed turned the tide. In the meantime, Gon-
 calves and his cabinet continue in a caretaker
 capacity.
 The new cabinet is expected to contain
 representatives of the three major political par-
 ties-the  Socialists,  center-left  Popular
 Democrats, and the Communists--but they are to
 sit in the cabinet as individuals and not as
 representatives of their respective parties.
 Azevedo hopes this compromise will be accepted
 by the feuding Communists and Popular
 Democrats who are refusing to attend negotiating
 sessions together. The Communists have renewed
 their attacks, labeling the Popular Democrats as
 "reactionary" and hope to regain support in the
 military. Having suffered a. serious setback with
 the loss of Goncalves, the Communists appear
 determined not to be cut out of the action
 altogether.
 Both  the Socialists  and the  Popular
 Democrats set strict conditions for joining the
 new government to assure that they will not once
 again be in an underdog role. The parties worked
 with the anti-Communists in the military against
 Goncalves, but the cooperation may break down
 if the parties present excessive demands. Both
 groups hope to use this opportunity to move Por-
 tugal back toward a civilian government by
 preparing for national assembly elections next
 spring. At this time, however, it does not appear
 that the military-and President Costa Gomes in
 particular-plans an early return to the
 ITALY: POLITICAL DRIFT
 2
 As a new political season gets under way the
 governing parties seem inclined to postpone dif-
 ficult decisions rather than run the risk of a con-
 frontation that could precipitate early national
 elections. The tendency will aid Communist ef-
 forts to consolidate the sharp gains they scored in
 regional and local elections three months ago.
 Prime Minister Moro is the other beneficiary
 of political drift.  His cabinet of Christian
 Democrats and Republicans-which relies mainly
 on  Socialist votes for  its  parliamentary  ma-
 jority-is recognized by everyone as an interim
 government, but Moro is not likely to be
 challenged until politicians have a clearer idea of
 how to replace him. To bring Moro down with no
 alternative in sight would increase the possibility
 of early elections. Even the Communists are op-
 posed to early elections because they want to
 make the most of their local successes before fac-
 ing a showdown on the question of Communist
 participation in the national government.
 The key to what comes after Moro still lies
 with the Christian Democrats, but they are im-
 mobilized by the internal feud that erupted in the
 aftermath of the election debacle. Since the elec-
 tions, the Christian Democrats have been able to
 put together only transient internal majorities,
 first to oust Fanfani and later to elect Benigno
 Zaccagnini to preside as interim leader while the
 party  prepares for  its yet-to-be scheduled
 national congress.
 The Christian Democrats, however, have not
 been able to agree on how to deal with the Com-
 munists' vastly expanded influence. Last month,

 the party. Most notable so far is the defection of
 Foreign Minister Rumor from the largest centrist
 faction, which in recent years has controlled
 about a third of the party. Rumor seems to be
 moving closer to Moro and Zaccagnini, who are
 somewhat to the left of center. Strains are also
 evident between Treasury Minister Colombo and
 Budget Minister Andreotti who head the other
 centrist faction.
 The problem that will make it most difficult
 for the Christian Democrats to avoid calling early
 national elections is the firmness of the Socialist
 Party's refusal to join any new national govern-
 ment that leaves the Communists totally in op-
 position. The Socialists want an arrangement that
 would permit formalized consultations with the
 Communists on the national government's
 program-a formula that has been adopted by
 some of the new regional governments, which ex-
 clude the Communists from actual participation.
 Zaccagnini did get the Christian Democratic
 directorate to endorse a formalized dialogue with
 the Communists on the local level to discuss
 legislative programs, but that was not so much a
 policy change as' a recognition of reality. The
 Communists now share power with the Socialists
 in most major cities, 5 of the 20 regions, and near-
 ly a third of the 94 provinces.
 One symptom of the Christian Democrats'
 search for a coherent internal majority is a loosen-
 ing of the traditional alliances among certain key
 faction leaders, particularly those in the center of

 CYPRUS: TALKS STALEMATED
 The intercommunal talks came close to a total
 collapse this week when Greek and Turkish
 Cypriot negotiators Clerides and Denktash were
 unable to agree on an agenda or a date for
 another round of talks after three days of
 meetings with UN Secretary General Waldheim in
 New York.
 The impasse developed when Denktash in-
 dicated he was not prepared to follow through on
 romise in Vienna last month to address the
 hi
 s p
 important territorial question in return for Greek
 Cypriot acceptance of some principal Turkish
 Cypriot demands.
 Denktash told Waldheim that problems with
 the Turkish Cypriots and the unwillingness of
 Ankara to commit itself prior to the senate elec-
 tions on October 12 made it impossible for him to
 offer territorial proposals at this time. He in-
 dicated his willingness to address the question
 sometime after the Turkish elections.
 With an eye to the approaching US con-
 gressional debate on the arms embargo against
 Turkey, however, Denktash tried hard to per-
 suade Clerides to discuss other issues to give the
 appearance of movement in the talks. The an-
 nouncement by the Turkish General Staff last
 week that some 750 of the estimated 32,000
 Turkish troops on Cyprus were being withdrawn
 was also made with the aim of influencing
 Congress to lift the embargo.
 Concerned about his own political future,
 Clerides remained steadfast in his refusal to par-
 ticipate in formal negotiations in the absence of
 concrete proposals by Denktash on the territorial
 question. Clerides apparently was under strong
 pressure this time from Athens as well as from
 President Makarios to avoid giving the talks a
 positive gloss in the absence of real progress and
 thereby aid the Turkish case in Congress.
 Waldheim was "just barely" able to prevent a
 complete breakdown of the talks. At one point,
 Denktash reportedly threatened to resettle the
 Greek section of Famagusta, which for the most
 part has been left vacant, and to declare the

 Turkish Cypriot zone an independent state if the
 Greek Cypriot side broke off the talks. At
 Clerides' insistence, no date was set for another
 round of talks. A terse communique noted only
 that Waldheim would remain in contact with the
 two parties in regard to "future action."
 With the intercommunal talks stalled, the EC
 Nine may take the initiative to bring the two sides
 closer together. The EC earlier offered to mediate
 the dispute and subsequently made a demarche
 to the interested parties urging flexibility. The
 Nine decided, however, to await the results of the
 New York talks before taking additional steps. The
 Turkish side has generally been cool to an EC role
 in the negotiations.
 Meanwhile, the Greek Cypriots are making
 preparations to take their case to the UN General
 Assembly in the hope of putting additional
 pressure on the Turks to be forthcoming. The
 Greek Cypriots have been encouraged by the
 strong support they received at the recent
 Nonaligned Conference in Lima.
 SOVIETS CONCERNED ABOUT DETENTE
 Moscow's apprehensions about the strength
 of the US commitment to detente go back to the
 resignation of President Nixon, but they have
 grown, or at least been more openly expressed, in
 recent months. The controversies over the
 Helsinki summit and Soviet grain purchases have
 drawn particular attention. Last week two promi-
 nent members of the USSR's Institute of the USA
 and Canada rose to the defense of detente against
 Western critics, and perhaps against domestic
 skeptics as well.
 Izvestia on September 4 published a lengthy
 article by Georgy Arbatov, director of the institute
 and Moscow's leading academic authority on the
 US. Evidently responding to Western denigration
 of the European security agreement, Arbatov
 defended the USSR against charges of non-
 compliance, especially with the human contacts
 provisions, by launching a sharp counterattack
 aimed at discrediting the right of the West to pass
 such judgments. Arbatov's tough line may have
 been intended to set the tone for future rebuffs to
 Western efforts to "interfere" in Soviet internal
 affairs. He may also have wanted to assure the
 Soviet  people  that  Moscow's  interest  in
 promoting detente will not lead to an easing of its
 tight control over domestic affairs.
 In a message clearly aimed at the West, Ar-
 batov denied that the Soviets are seeking to use
 detente to "nudge forward" class and national
 liberation struggles. He denied that the dif-
 ficulties facing the US in Greece, Turkey, and Por-
 tugal are a consequence of Soviet actions, but he
 expressly rejected any interpretation of detente
 entailing a Soviet obligation to preserve the
 "social status quo." In essence, Arbatov argued
 that the USSR has every right under detente to
 support its friends.
 Arbatov also felt it necessary to reassure his
 audience that support for detente remains-strong
 in the US. He implicitly cautioned his Soviet
 readers not to overestimate the strength of
 detente's opponents and not to turn away from a
 policy that has brought the USSR "striking"
 achievements.
 I he message that US-Soviet relations are still
 generally headed in the right direction was also
 conveyed  in  an article appearing  in the
 September issue of the Soviet journal Inter-
 national Affairs. Written by Genrikh Trofimenko,
 a senior staff member of Arbatov's institute, the
 article contended that bilateral relations have at-
 tained a "certain stability" that can sustain ten-
 sion-producing shocks. For example, the 1973
 Middle East crisis and 1974 US trade legislation, he
 said, had created tensions that have now been ful-
 ly dissipated.
 Trofimenko argued that the complex of
 bilateral agreements concluded since 1972 has
 created a stabilizing basis for relations which, if
 not unshakable, has at least permitted the two
 sides to weather problems without a dams in
 "ripple" effect.                             25X1

 EGYPT: BATTENING DOWN
 President Sadat has taken a barrage of
 criticism from other Arabs and the Soviets since
 the signing last week of the second Egyp-
 tian-Israeli disengagement agreement. Buttressed
 by apparent support at home, however, Sadat is
 returning blow for blow in the verbal battle.
 Although the Egyptians anticipated criticism,
 they seem surprised and disturbed by its ferocity
 and, in some!cases, its source. They are particular-
 ly upset that Syria's Baath Party issued a public
 denunciation of the agreement, and they are not
 inclined to listen to excuses about the domestic
 political considerations that led Syrian President
 Asad to associate himself with the statement.
 Jordan's private criticism and its public dis-
 sociation from an erroneously quoted statement
 of support for the accord also rankle. As for the
 Palestinians, the Egyptians probably expected lit-
 tle else from that quarter, but the outcry from less
 radical  leaders causes additional discomfort.
 Similarly, Cairo is probably not surprised at the
 Soviet reaction, but it is nonetheless angered; it is
 also concerned about the Soviets' potential for
 mischief-making.
 President Sadat lashed out at his critics during
 a speech last week originally intended to explain
 the terms of the agreement. Ignoring ex-
 planations, Sadat counterattacked. With anger
 and emotion, he accused the Soviets of
 deliberately distorting Egypt's position in an effort
 to divide the Arabs, and he castigated Syria and
 the Palestinians for falling for the Soviet ploy.
 Such direct criticism of Arab allies is rare; never
 before did Sadat attack Syria and President Asad
 by name, and he has seldom so openly directed
 his wrath at Yasir Arafat and the less radical
 Palestinian leaders.
 Sadat challenged the other Arabs to prove
 that they could, by their own tactics, match
 Egypt's accomplishments. He rehearsed the
 history of the Arab struggle with Israel and
 asserted that a quarter century of sloganeering
 and paper resolutions had produced nothing for
 the Arabs. He said the Arab people deserve better
 than "soporific promises," and he claimed full
 credit for starting them on a course that has
 brought not only gains for Egypt, but a territorial
 return for Syria and greater international recogni-
 tion for the Palestinians.
 In the course of his defense, Sadat minimized
 the territorial gains made by Egypt in the latest
 agreement in order to demonstrate Cairo's con-
 tinued loyalty to the Arab cause. He said he had
 not obtained all he had hoped for and, in the
 most telling justification of his position, asserted
 that if he had meant to abandon the other Arabs
 as they have charged, he could have regained the
 entire Sinai through considerably less arduous
 negotiations.
 The criticism from outside appears to have
 closed Egyptian ranks around Sadat. His attack on
 fellow Arabs and the Soviets won repeated
 applause from his audience of Egyptian political
 and legislative leaders, and they later passed a
 resolution that with uncharacteristic enthusiasm
 endorsed Sadat and his policies.
 Some opposition from Egyptian leftists is in-
 evitable, and radical Arabs or the Soviets could
 use the agreement to stir up subversive elements
 within Egypt, but for the present most Egyptians
 seem relieved that a period of relatively assured
 stability is on the horizon. Businessmen are
 reportedly already expressing satisfaction that the
 agreement will provide an atmosphere conducive
 to commercial planning uninterrupted by war.
 The government is capitalizing on this senti-
 ment to reinforce its support at home. It is now
 stressing the respite the agreement will provide
 Egypt in which to cope with domestic economic
 difficulties. The average Egyptian is more vitally
 concerned with economic improvements in Egypt
 than with regaining Palestine for the Palestinians
 or Golan for the Syrians.

 SUDAN: COUP QUASHED
 Last week, Jaafar Numayri, Sudan's pragmatic
 socialist leader, survived another attempt to top-
 ple his six-year-old regime. This time the move
 came from military supporters of extremist
 Muslim organizations. Numayri seems bound to
 come out of the espisode with his prestige
 heightened and hold on power reinforced.
 In contrast to the near-successful effort
 ;against Numayri by the Sudanese Communist Par-
 ty in mid-1971, the latest coup attempt never
 posed a serious challenge to the President's rule
 and fizzled out within two hours. Apparently less
 than  100  military  dissidents were  involved.
 In a radio address on September 8, Numayri
 claimed that his security service had been aware
 of the plot, which he said had been mastermind-
 ed by the National Front-a coalition of the out-
 lawed, ultra-conservative Muslim Brotherhood
 and the Ansar sect, a political-religious organiza-
 tion. Both groups have a history of opposition to
 Numayri. On the same day, Numayri ordered
 Khartoum University, a stronghold of the Muslim
 Brotherhood, closed indefinitely following the
 reported discovery there of a large cache of arms
 and ammunition.
 Numayri has also announced that the
 Sudanese Parliament will meet in special session
 to discuss the drafting of constitutional
 amendments to "safeguard" the 1969 revolution.
 Numayri is likely to be increasingly intolerant of
 opposition.
 The public reaction to the coup attempt
 suggests that support for Numayri's leadership has
 increased. In the past, the President's staying
 power often seemed attributable less to his own
 strength and popularity than to the absence of
 alternatives to him. On this occasion, there were
 apparently  spontaneous  pro-Numayri
 demonstrations in the streets, even before it was
 evident that the tide was going against the
 plotters.
 In his speech on September 8, Numayri all
 but accused Libyan President Qadhafi of financ-
 ing the bid to oust him. Numayri demanded the
 extradition of Sudanese Muslim extremists who
 have been living in Tripoli. In recent months,
 although aware that Qadhafi was supporting the
 exiles, Numayri had attempted to maintain cordial
 relations with Libya in the hope that Tripoli would
 give Sudan financial help for its hard-pressed
 economy.
 the offing.
 Numayri may be less concerned now over the
 decline of relations with Tripoli because he
 believes he has had some success in forging closer
 ties with Cairo and Riyadh. Numayri has recently
 met with both President Sadat and King Khalid.
 The government-controlled press in Khartoum
 has speculated that a formal economic
 relationship among the three countries may be in

 ANGOLA: NATIONAL FRONT SET BACK
 The National Front for the Liberation of
 Angola suffered a major new military and political
 defeat during the past week. As a result, the rival
 Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola is
 gaining increased credibility as the only one of
 Angola's three nationalist groups capable of
 assuming power upon independence.
 On September 8, military pressure by the
 Popular Movement forced the National Front to
 withdraw from its stronghold at Caxito, some 40
 miles northeast of Luanda. Prior to the action, the
 Front was claiming that it had advanced from Cax-
 ito to within ten miles of Luanda. The Popular
 Movement's attack on the stronghold appears to
 be part of a major offensive against the Front,
 perhaps planned with the intent of driving it out
 of Angola entirely. At present, Front forces are
 regrouping at Ambriz, one of the organization's
 major bases in northern Angola.
 Since it was forced out of Luanda last July, the
 Front had relied on its presence in Caxito to dis-
 credit the Popular Movement's claims that it is the
 only liberation group capable of taking over from
 Portugal at independence on  November 11.
 Unless the Front can stage a dramatic comeback
 in the near future, it will be isolated in northern
 Angola and its chances for a meaningful role in
 the post-independence government will be
 greatly reduced.
 Meanwhile, in central Angola the National
 Union for the Total Independence of Angola, the
 territory's third nationalist group, is also having
 military problems. Its attempt to recapture Luso is
 stalled, and it has been unable to build up a force
 large enough to attack the major rail and port
 cities of Benguela and Lobito, which it recently
 lost to the Popular Movement.

 The Popular Movement is losing no oppor-
 tunity to publicize its increasingly dominant posi-
 tion in the territory. With the exception of the
 Portuguese, who no longer exercise any real con-
 trol in Angola, the Popular Movement is the only
 group with access to the national media. It is using
 the press and radio increasingly to project an im-
 age of effectiveness and responsibility and ap-
 parently plans a propaganda blitz to advance its
 bid for national popular support.
 The new Portuguese high commissioner, Ad-
 miral Cardoso, arrived in Luanda last Friday but so
 far has remained in the background. He has ap-
 parently discovered that the only functionaries
 available to keep a transitional government struc-
 ture operating are either officials or sympathizers
 of the Popular Movement. He is hardly likely
 within the next two months to be able to establish
 an administration that will include significant
 representation from the other two nationalist
 groups.

 LEBANON: ARMY CALLED IN
 Prime Minister Rashid Karami announced on
 September 10 that he had called on the 17,000-
 man Lebanese army to help stop fighting between
 Christians and Muslims in the Tripoli area of
 northern Lebanon. The violence, which began
 last week with a dispute following an automobile
 accident, came to involve several hundred
 militiamen on each side and resulted in heavy
 casualties and extensive property damage.
 According to Karami's announcement, the
 army will create and man a buffer zone between
 Tripoli district, which is 78-percent Sunni Muslim,
 and adjoining Zagharta district, which is 90-per-
 cent Maronite Christian. The army will seek to
 avoid being drawn into the fighting by staying out
 of the metropolitan areas of Tripoli and Zagharta,
 where security will remain the responsibility of
 the Lebanese internal security forces. The army
 will, Karami explained, "separate the combatants
 if fighting breaks out again." In fact, the
 fighting-although sharply reduced-has not yet
 stopped, and army units are sure to suffer some
 casualties while moving into position.
 The heavy fighting this week did not spread
 to Beirut-where the internal security forces
 fought with radical Lebanese and fedayeen dur-
 ing April, May, and June of this year-or to the
 southern port cities of Tyre and Sidon. Security in
 the southern ports was nevertheless threatened
 by general strikes imposed by Palestinians
 protesting the second Egyptian-Israeli interim
 agreement. Although the strike was only partially
 effective in Beirut, the capital was already jittery
 from demonstrations by Palestinians and leftists
 protesting actions of the security services in the
 eastern Lebanese town of Zahlah, where intermit-
 tent fighting between Christians and Muslims has
 been going on since late last month.
 This is the first time the army has been used
 to help curb civil unrest in Lebanon since the
 spring of 1973. At that time, the army's fight with
 the fedayeen brought Syria to the verge of mov-
 ing troops into Lebanon and led to a prolonged
 government crisis in Lebanon. Deployment of the
 army this time was made possible by the fact that
 the major Palestinian groups were not involved in
 the fighting. Their willingness to stay on the
 sidelines paved the way for a compromise
 between Karami, a Muslim who opposed using
 the predominantly Christian-officered army, and
 President Franjiyah and Interior Minister Shamun,
 Christians who demanded that the army be
 brought in.
 Under the compromise, army commander
 Iskandar Ghanim, a Christian supporter of Fran-
 jiyah, was replaced by Hanna Said, formerly com-
 mander of a military region in eastern Lebanon.
 Said, like Ghanim, is a Maronite Christian, but he
 has generally supported centrist Christian and
 Muslim politicians who over the years have been
 at odds with the more conservative Franjiyah and
 Interior Minister Shamun. His is therefore
 something of a compromise appointment.
 Karami announced that the cabinet had
 decided to use the army only after having made
 "contacts with the disputing parties. The Muslim
 and Christian factions that have been fighting in
 the Tripoli area were probably receptive to such a
 proposal. Both have suffered heavy casualties,
 and-because they have not been resupplied by
 the major fedayeen groups or the large Christian
 militias-are short of ammunition.
 According to the US embassy in Beirut,
 Karami also sought the acquiescence of Palestine
 Liberation Organization chairman Yasir Arafat.
 Some Palestinian and leftist Lebanese leaders
 have already gone through the motions of con-
 demning Karami, but none are likely to take up
 arms against the army. Some have even
 volunteered statements indirectly supporting his
 action. Zuhayr Muhsin, head of the Syrian-con-
 trolled Saiga group and the PLO military depart-
 ment, said on September 11 that the Palestinians
 regard use of the army in northern Lebanon as a
 "domestic decision" for Lebanon and will not op-
 pose it.

 President Rodriguez returns to the National Palace following coup attempt
 ECUADOR: ADJUSTING TO REALITIES
 President Rodriguez has made a series of per-
 sonnel changes in the military government, as
 well as in the armed forces high command, in the
 wake of last week's attempted coup. The number
 of army officers in the 11-member cabinet has
 been increased from five to seven and air force
 representation has gone from one to two. The
 support of the air force and all but two small army
 units was instrumental in Rodriguez' quick victory
 over the rebels. Only two civilians remain in the
 cabinet, and the navy, which remained neutral,
 has lost its one position.
 The ministerial changes are not altogether a
 matter of rewarding the faithful. The new minister
 of government, General Ruben Dario Ayala, was a
 key troop commander at the time of the coup
 attempt. He made his loyalty to Rodriguez con-
 tingent on the President's becoming less of a
 left-leaning authoritarian,  particularly on
 economic issues. Ayala was relieved of his troop
 command and  after a "decent"  interval,
 Rodriguez will probably move him further from
 the sources of power, perhaps posting him
 abroad as an attache.
 The political conservatism of the new cabinet
 members and service chiefs strongly suggests that
 Rodriguez will back away from his most con-
 troversial  economic  policies.
 Instead of relying on  these  unpopular
 measures to stem the steady outflow of foreign
 exchange, the government will seek to increase
 revenues by raising the volume of its petroleum
 exports. It has already begun to curry favor with
 international oil companies by eliminating all im-
 port duties on materials and equipment used for
 oil exploration and exploitation. In addition,
 Quito reportedly will try to revive the foreign oil
 companies' flagging interest in exploration in
 Ecuador by offering attractive service contracts.
 President Rodriguez is weathering the after-
 math-of the ouster attempt almost as smoothly as
 he weathered the attempt itself. This period is
 clearly a turning point in his tenure, however, and
 his cabinet and other advisers are certain to play a
 greater  role  in  the  policy - making

 CUBA: COUNTERWEIGHT TO DETENTE
 Cuban President Dorticos' address on Mon-
 day to the closing session of the Puerto Rican
 solidarity conference indicates that Havana plans
 to continue to press the Puerto Rican in-
 dependence issue even at the risk of slowing the
 process of accommodation with the US. It is clear
 from the way that Havana handled the con-
 ference, however, that the Cubans do not want
 the Puerto Rican issue to stop the detente process
 altogether.
 Dorticos, speaking at a rural secondary
 school named for a Puerto Rican leftist, rejected
 the concept of Puerto Rico's status being a US in-
 ternal matter. He promised "on behalf of the
 Cuban people, their communist party, and the
 Cuban Revolutionary Government" to provide
 "unlimited support" for the Puerto Rican cause.
 "Unlimited support," however, is not likely to in-
 clude-at least for the time being-paramilitary
 assistance.
 Dorticos also pledged to continue activity in
 the United Nations in behalf of Puerto Rico's in-
 dependence and indicated that the international
 propaganda campaign Cuba is conducting will
 grow rather than wane. Dorticos' comments are
 the strongest yet by a high government official
 and indicate that the Castro regime's determina-
 tion to press the issue cannot easily be overcome.
 The speech can be taken as a direct response to
 Washington's strong diplomatic representations
 to various   governments prior to   the UN
 Decolonization Committee's vote on the Puerto
 Rico resolution.
 The Cuban leadership apparently believes its
 pursuit of detente with the US requires a parallel
 effort to re-emphasize its commitment to
 revolutionary,  anti-imperialist  principles.  The
 Puerto Rican issue fills this need and also serves as
 a substitute for those fading issues-such as Viet-
 nam and the US embargo-long used by Havana
 to maintain an aura of confrontation in Cuban-US
 relations. There are signs of opposition within the
 Cuban revolutionary ranks to any modification of
 Havana's anti-US stance, and this domestic
 pressure must be dealt with while Castro pursues
 the longer range goal of an accommodation with
 the US. Castro therefore is likely to persist in his
 Puerto Rican independence campaign even
 though he has been warned that it could slow the
 process of reconciliation.
 There is circumstantial evidence that Castro
 made some effort to limit the impact of the Puerto
 Rican campaign on the detente process: he had a
 quasi-governmental organization rather than the
 Foreign Ministry prepare for and conduct the
 solidarity conference. In what appears to have
 been a deliberate effort to ensure that the con-
 ference was not spotlighted in the US, he limited
 US media coverage and even canceled the
 scheduled visit by a US television network cor-
 respondent. In addition, he chose to have Dor-
 ticos make the speech, although he himself was
 present and could easily have delivered it. Castro
 can thus portray himself as not wedded personally
 to the Puerto Rican issue and may even argue that
 his government is involved only peripherally. He
 probably believes that Dorticos, who appears
 destined to cede the presidency to Castro follow-
 ing the first party congress this December, is ex-
 pendable and therefore a good candidate to
 deliver the strong address that he believed cir-
 cumstances called for on Monday.
 The solidarity conference itself failed to live
 up to its advance billing, judging from its final
 declaration. Aside from the expected progaganda
 blast, the conferees apparently achieved little of25X1
 substance other than to state their intention to
 hold another conference within three
 years.

 SEGKt
 PERU: THE SECOND STAGE BEGINS
 President Morales Bermudez' steps to loosen
 the restraints on civil liberties that were imposed
 under former President Velasco have created an
 air of expectancy in Lima. Traditional political par-
 ties are cautiously hopeful that they will be allow-
 ed to engage in open and perhaps unfettered ac-
 tivity. Another beneficiary of the new openness is
 the Peruvian navy, which felt humiliated and
 powerless under Velasco. Its leaders are now
 sanguine about an expansion of its role in govern-
 ment affairs as a result of the new President's in-
 creased willingness to consult naval officers on
 matters affecting that service.
 Despite the auspicious start of what Morales
 Bermudez has called the "second stage" of the
 Peruvian revolution, there remains some uncer-
 tainty regarding the future course of the regime.
 Various groups tend to view Morales Bermudez in
 the light most favorable to their interests, ap-
 parently reflecting the general lack of insight into
 the President's real political views, a degree of
 wishful thinking, and perhaps a propensity to
 read too much into the reform measures an-
 nounced already.
 Morales Bermudez probably intends to allow
 more press freedom and political discourse as
 part of his effort to increase the popularity and ef-
 ficiency of the military government. These moves
 in large part are expected to be implemented
 without discriminating against one group or
 another. At the same time, however, the regime
 will be careful to ensure that the process does not
 develop too rapidly or without careful monitor-
 ing. Morales Bermudez is likely to pay closest
 attention to the activities of communists and
 other more radical groups. He also reportedly
 remains wary of several previously pro-Velasco
 generals who, because of their seniority and sup-
 port, remain in high government and military
 posts. These indications suggest that, despite
 Morales Bermudez' nearly complete military sup-
 port, undercurrents of distrust and political rivalry
 are likely to continue to influence government
 policies. For the time being, at least, we believe
 that such facoors are of only minimal significance.
 Relations with the US show signs of im-
 proving, particularly since Morales Bermudez
 appears firmly committed to reaching an
 amicable settlement on the problem created by
 the Marcona  expropriation.  Any  agreement,
 however, is likely to be couched in terms that will
 avoid the appearance of Lima's suddenly "caving
 in" to pressure from Washington.
 Other economic policies may be announced
 later this month after the new team headed by
 civilian Economy Minister Barua has assessed the
 country's situation. One measure apparently un-
 der                                                          c onsideration   is   a  currency
 devaluation.
 ARGENTINA: COUNTERTERRORISM
 Responding to an unprecedented upsurge in
 left-wing violence and  kidnapings, President
 Maria Estela Peron has formally outlawed the
 Montonero guerrillas as the first step in what may
 become a major offensive against all Argentine
 terrorists.
 The Montoneros supported the return of
 Juan Peron from exile in 1973, but declared "war"
 against his widow in September 1974. Her govern-
 ment had avoided taking official action against
 them for fear of further antagonizing liberal
 Peronists who, while not necessarily agreeing
 with the Montoneros, were being alienated by
 the administration's conservative policies.
 Because of their position and strength the Mon-
 toneros have played an effective political role
 through agitation within the Peronist labor move-
 ment and have even fielded candidates under the
 banner of the "Authentic Party" in a recent
 provincial election.

 The government's decision gives security forces
 greater freedom of action in counterinsurgency
 operations. Until now, sympathetic newspapers
 and broadcasting stations could force the release
 of Montonero guerrillas held without charge,
 simply by publicizing their names. Such actions in
 behalf of outlawed groups are forbidden under
 current censorship restrictions.
 Other measures are likely to be announced
 soon. The new army commander, General Jorge
 Videla, has told newsmen that the army's an-
 ti-guerrilla  operations  in  Tucuman
 Province-where the principal opponent has
 been the People's Revolutionary Army-could be
 extended throughout the country "if the cir-
 cumstances warranted it." He added that a federal
 organization might be formed to coordinate the
 actions of all the security forces.
 The  Montoneros and the People's
 PANAMA: TALKS STIR OPTIMISM
 US Ambassador Bunker's arrival in Panama
 City on September 7 for another round of trea-
 ty talks has stirred considerable optimism
 among Panamanian officials. Recent visits by
 US Deputy Secretary of Defense Clements, JCS
 chairman General Brown, and Assistant
 Secretary of State Rogers, and the widely
 publicized reports of State Department and
 Pentagon agreement on a negotiating position
 have also buoyed Panamanian hopes. Torrijos
 has stated his belief that the US now favors a
 "satisfactory arrangement" on the canal-an
 arrangement he characterizes as "the one that
 Panama is seeking." If the current round of
 negotiations should result in little progress, dis-
 appointment would be high.
 Panamanian government officials and the
 press continue to emphasize, however, the
 Panamanian position that a new treaty's dura-
 tion cannot extend beyond the end of the cen-
 tury, that no more than 3 military bases (there
 are presently 14) should be allowed, and that
 far greater tracts of land and water must be
 handed back than the US has offered. Such
 Revolutionary Army hope to goad the armed
 forces leaders into ousting Peron's civilian
 government, which they regard as insufficiently
 radical. The expected popular revulsion against
 military administration, they believe, would vir-
 tually assure a left-wing political victory once
 elections were held. In pursuit of this long range
 goal, the guerrillas have been focusing their
 terrorist attacks on all branches of the armed
 forces.
 Argentine society cannot long endure the
 twin assaults of economic deterioration and
 mounting violence, which feed on each other and
 in time could bring about the political polariza-
 tion the extremists seek. Recent statements by
 military leaders strongly indicate that they have
 decided to support the government in the in-
 itiative against the terrorists rather than allow the
 public statements will make it difficult for the
 Panamanians to compromise on these issues
 and avoid domestic charges of a sellout.
 The release last week by a small, ul-
 tranationalist student group of what it claims
 are secret government documents revealing in-
 itial US-Panamanian conceptual agreements on
 defense, administration, and jurisdiction in the
 Canal Zone may further complicate the
 negotiations. The student group claims that the
 accords reflect US rather than Panamanian
 aspirations and has demanded that the govern-
 ment denounce them. A nationalistic, an-
 ti-government radio station has aired similar
 charges. According to the station, however,
 chief Panamanian negotiator Tack has stated
 that the documents are not official and do not
 reflect the topics under discussion. No other
 media outlet has commented on the
 documents. Whether true or false, however,
 the charges are increasing pressure on the
 government to toughen its neogitating
 stance.

 CHINA: NEW SIGNS OF STRAIN
 After year-long calls for unity and stability,
 China's leaders have shown in recent weeks that
 their own internecine battles are far from over. In
 late August, criticism of the ancient novel "Water
 Margin," known to be a favorite of Mao, sudden-
 ly emerged on the scene and raised some highly
 contentious issues.
 Among these is the need to "oppose the
 emperor," a common theme of several articles
 which began on August 23. The emperor figure
 has been used in Chinese propaganda for the last
 two years as a surrogate for Mao, and the call to
 oppose the emperor has very likely been read in
 China as criticism of the Chairman. Reinforcing
 this notion is a remarkable passage in a People's
 Daily article that forcefully states it is necessary to
 "oppose the emperor" in order to save the
 revolution. In addition, an article in China's sec-
 ond leading newspaper made an unmistakable
 defense of Marshal Lin Piao, who fell after
 allegedly attempting a coup against Mao. Using
 historical analogy, the article praised a marshal for
 attempting to seize the imperial throne by force
 and called this person a hero for defying the
 emperor. Lin Piao is the only one of China's ten
 marshals ever accused of trying to unseat Mao.
 4, nearly two weeks after the literary criticism
 began, seemed to turn the debate around. For the
 first time, Mao himself was credited with
 launching the criticism, and the major theme was
 not opposition to the emperor but national
 "capitulation," specifically capitulation to the
 An editorial in People's Daily on September
 The national capitulation theme seems aimed
 at some elements in the military who were ac-
 cused in last year's anti-Confucius propaganda of
 advocating a less hostile attitude toward Moscow.
 Mao himself has seemed genuinely concerned
 that a change in China's policy toward the Soviet
 Union will occur after his death unless those ad-
 vocating any change are purged. To this end, he
 has apparently pushed strongly for a purge within
 the military despite the destabilizing effects of
 such a move. Nevertheless, his apparently persist-
 ent efforts to remove important military men
 from office have thus far not been successful.
 It seems likely that Mao is using the "Water
 Margin" debate, whether or not he initiated it, as
 another move against his elusive military targets.

 SECRET                          Now
 If so, the articles calling for opposition to the
 emperor may have been efforts by the military to
 stave off another onslaught from the Chairman.
 The literary debate seems to have toned
 down since the publication of the People's Daily
 editorial. The editorial called for unity, relegated
 the criticism to a "discussion" movement, and
 generally appeared to be an effort to damp down
 the potentially explosive repercussions of the
 literary criticism.
 The national media have had little to say since
 the editorial was published, and the response in
 the provinces has been slow and relatively
 low-key. Clearly, some in the leadership do not
 want to see the "Water Margin" criticism develop
 into a full scale national campaign, with its im-
 plications for continued factional strife and
 general unrest.
 LAOS: ENTER THE SOVIETS
 The Soviet presence in Laos has been steadily
 increasing since the departure of most Americans
 in late May. The Soviets have been careful not to
 reveal the size of their mission, but it is estimated
 at 300 to 500 people, a substantial increase from
 the 75 to 100 before the US exodus.
 Soviet personnel have been helping to im-
 prove and operate airfields and flying and main-
 taining transport aircraft for the Pathet Lao. Late
 last month, a seven-man Soviet economic
 assistance team and several construction experts
 arrived to begin work on projects covered in an
 assistance pact signed in December. There will be
 a further substantial increase in Soviet personnel
 when the Soviets start full-scale work on these
 projects.
 The Lao communist decision to increase the
 Soviet presence may reflect a desire to strike a
 new balance in relations with Moscow and Pe-
 king. Until a few months ago, the Soviets had few
 direct dealings with the Lao communists. Moscow
 worked exclusively through Hanoi; all Soviet
 military aid was sent through the North Viet-
 namese; and no Soviet personnel were stationed
 in the communist-controlled parts of Laos.
 The Chinese, in contrast, have dealt directly
 with the Lao communists for years, although Pe-
 king  did  not  seek  to  challenge  Hanoi's
 pre-eminence. Peking provided some direct arms
 assistance, launched a major road-building
 program, which is still under way, and sent more
 than 20,000 troops to northwest Laos.
 The Lao remain under the tutelage of the
 North Vietnamese, and any shift toward the
 Soviets would almost certainly reflect a decision
 taken in Hanoi. The Vietnamese may have en-
 couraged the Lao to move closer to Moscow for
 fear the Chinese would seek to fill the void left by
 the departure of the Americans and by the end of
 US assistance. The Chinese, because of
 geographical proximity and to a lesser extent
 because of long-standing contacts with Lao
 leaders, would be more of a threat than the
 Soviets in any competition with the North Viet-
 namese for influence in Laos.
 The Chinese presumably are unhappy that
 they have been confined to the relatively remote
 northwest while the Soviets are active throughout
 the rest of the country. Given the Pathet Lao's
 dependence on North Vietnamese guidance,
 however, there appears little Peking can do to
 prevent  a  more  substantial  Soviet
 presence.                                      25X1

 CAMBODIA
 Cambodian "head of state" Prince Sihanouk,
 accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Khieu
 Samphan, returned to Cambodia on September 9.
 He received a warm reception in Phnom Penh;
 Deputy Prime Minister Son Sen delivered the
 welcoming  address.  Among those  greeting
 Sihanouk  were  Information  and Propaganda
 Minister Hu Nim (in his first reported public
 appearance since the communist take-over),
 "other ministers and deputy ministers," represen-
 tatives of the Buddhist clergy, army, National
 United  Front cadre, worker groups, mass
 organizations, and a "vast" crowd.
 Prime Minister Penn Nouth, the ailing Sihanouk
 loyalist and noncommunist, also returned to
 Phnom Penh. With the presence of both the chief
 of state and prime minister in Cambodia, little
 remains of the Royal Government of National
 Union in Peking. The members of Sihanouk's en-
 tourage who stayed in China are reportedly
 attempting to obtain exit visas for France and
 other countries, but the Chinese have not yet
 given them permission to leave and are taking the
 position that this is a matter for the Cambodian
 government to decide.
 Sihanouk's stay in Phnom Penh will apparently
 be short, however, since he is to return to China
 to attend the National Day celebrations on Oc-
 tober 1. The Prince reportedly will address the
 United Nations General Assembly in early Oc-
 tober, go on to Pyongyang for the anniversary of
 the Korean Workers Party on October 10, and
 return to Peking to celebrate his birthday on Oc-
 tober 31.
 The Khmer communists have been trying to
 entice Sihanouk to return to Cambodia for some
 time. The invitation given the Prince in mid-July
 when he was in Pyongyang was reportedly not the
 first he had received since the communist
 take-over last April. Although Sihanouk has
 dutifully performed his ceremonial duties since
 Sihanouk bids farewell to Teng Hsiao-ping
 at Peking airport
 the take-over, the Cambodian leadership clearly
 wants to end the residence abroad of their "head
 of state," and gain more control over his actions.
 The Khmer communists are beginning to
 welcome some Asian communist diplomats in
 Phnom Penh. The Chinese news agency an-
 nounced Tuesday that Chinese ambassador to
 Cambodia Sun Hao had departed for Phnom
 Penh to take up his duties. The Chinese envoy is
 the first foreign ambassador to be allowed back in
 Phnom Penh since the communist take-over, and
 his presence may signal the arrival of other am-
 bassadors from Cambodia's communist neighbors
 in the relatively near future.

 BURMA: FOCUS ON FOREIGN POLICY
 Rangoon  is increasing diplomatic activity
 partly in reaction to communist victories in In-
 dochina, but also to attract more aid. Burma was
 one of the first countries to announce recognition
 of the new regime in Phnom Penh, and it is open-
 ing a new ambassadorial-level post in Hanoi.
 Foreign Minister HIa Phone visited Laos last
 month and joined in a statement welcoming the
 "admirably changed situation in Indochina."
 Burma's somewhat higher diplomatic profile
 is also reflected in the decision to abandon its
 long-standing policy of abstaining on major con-
 troversial issues at the UN.
 Burma's most pressing foreign concern has
 been over Chinese support for the Burmese com-
 munist insurgency. The Ne Win government has
 appeared more relaxed and confident about this
 issue in the past year, but Foreign Minister HIa
 Phone apparently raised the matter when he
 visited Peking last month-the first high-level
 Burmese visit to China since Ne Win was in Peking
 in 1971. The Burmese may feel the time is ripe, in
 view of Chinese reassurances on the same issue to
 other Southeast Asian countries, to try to get
 some commitment from Peking to reduce sup-
 port for the insurgents. The Chinese are not like-
 ly, however, to abandon the Burmese communists
 entirely.
 China undoubtedly has warned Burma about
 Soviet intentions in Southeast Asia and hopes to
 get the Burmese to sign the same kind of an-
 ti-hegemony statement that Thailand, Malaysia,
 and the Philippines have signed recently. The
 Burmese, however, would be reluctant to make a
 public declaration, so clearly aimed at Moscow.
 Rangoon in fact is being careful to balance its
 relations with the major powers and has recently
 made some gestures to improve relations with the
 Soviets, including a visit to Moscow by Deputy
 Prime Minister U Lwin last June. Rangoon ex-
 pressed some interest in the possibility of Soviet
 military aid earlier this year, but apparently was
 not satisfied with Moscow's response since the
 Burmese have not followed up on the matter.
 Despite their more receptive approach to
 communist states, the Burmese are also showing
 interest in better relations with the US and the
 West. Their need for foreign aid has led to in-
 creased  participation  in those international
 bodies that deal with economic matters. As part of
 a shake-up of diplomatic posts abroad, Rangoon
 has replaced its incompetent ambassador in
 Washington with a capable, professional foreign
 service officer. In addition, the Burmese are
 cooperating with the US on narcotics matters, and
 are seeking additional aid for their anti-drug cam-
 paign after obtaining some helicopters.
 Despite the adjustments now under way in
 Burmese policy, Rangoon's basic "go-it-alone"
 foreign approach will remain unchanged. There
 has been no sign of any warming in Burma's
 traditionally cool relations with Thailand, and un-
 like the other noncommunist countries of the
 area, Burma does not appear interested in closer
 regional ties as a means of protection against the
 new communist regimes in Indochina. The
 members of the Association of Southeast Asian
 Nations have frequently tried to persuade Burma
 to join, but Ran oon shows little si n of being in-
 terested.
