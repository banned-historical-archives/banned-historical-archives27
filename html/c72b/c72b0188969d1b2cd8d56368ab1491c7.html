 INTELLIGENCE I.rE.0CRANDUM W. 208
 SUBJECT:   Communist Methods in Asia
 1.  Genral Considerations.
 26 August 1949
 Soviet theory envisages a "coalition" between the "proletarian
 revolution" (Communist governments and movements) in Europe and the
 "colonial revolution" in Asia, in order to build a "united world front
 of revolution against the vrorld front of imperialism." This front is to
 be supported "directly or determinedly" by Communist movements everywhere.
 The USSR, its satellites, and other "advanced" Communist Parties
 assist the local Communist organizations through diplomatic missions,
 trade delegations, propaganda and "cultural" activity, international
 organizations (labor, women's, youth), and by providing financial assistance,
 organizational specialists, advisers, and in some cases weapons.
 Communist methods in Asia derive largely from the Leninist-
 Stalinist doctrine governing revolutions in colonial and semi-colonial areas.
 This doctrine differs in several. respects from that advanced for more
 developed industrial countries.
 s. Fncouraemtent off' National Movements.
 The foremost Communist appeal in Asia is to the desire for
 national independence and the elimination of Western "colonial" influence.
 Local Communist Parties exploit national. movements and attempt to lead
 them or to attach themselves to the groups `vhich are leading them.
 Communists attempt to form a "National Front" with all significant forces
 of society, including the bourgeoisie and landowners, against the foreign
 colonial and "imperialist" powers.  If local nationalist leaders cannot be
 induced to support this cause, they are attacked as puppets.  Communists
 against
 seek to reduce Western influence
 home egoverrtn~entsnof
 (including the US, whit
 colonial powers) and against the local activities of Western representatives,
 by discrediting Western institutions, destroying Western property, and
 physically attacki   Westerners and those who work for them.  Nationalism and
 "anti-imperiali to" are the principal issues in Indochina and Indonesia, ,and

 are major issues in every other country of the Far East,  The national
 movement in most of these countries is regarded by the USSR as susceptible
 to Soviet exploitation and as working to the ultimate advantage of the
 Soviet Union., The important exceptions, in Soviet eyes, appear to be
 India and Indonesia, in which the national movement is effectively anti-
 Corramnist.
 b. Appeal to Peasantry rather than to Proletariat.
 Because most of Asia is not industrialized, the Communists
 usually concentrate on obtaining the support of the peasantry, until such
 time as there is a proletariat capable of becoming the "spearhead" of the
 revolution.   A Communist movement which rises to power on the base of an
 organized and armed peasantry after achieving power --e.g., in China will
 begin deliberately to subordinate the interest of the peasantry to that of
 the proletariat.  In the course of this rise, slogans for agrarian reform
 and opposition to landlordism are advanced to win peasant support.  Al-
 though collectivization of the land is regarded as the ultimately "correct"
 solution of the land problem and the problem of controlling the peasantry,
 it is not to be introduced on a large scale until the Communist regime is
 firmly entrenched and no longer is dependent on peasant support.  The
 peasantry already provides the principal support of the Communists in China
 and Burma.  Peasant support is important to the Communist movements of India,
 Indochina, and the Philippines, and the peasantry is a source of
 significant (though not major) support in Korea, Japan,and Indonesia.
 c. Use of Organized Armed Force against the Government, whether
 Colonial or Native.
 According to Communist doctrine, colonial peoples can gain
 independence only by successful armed overthrow of the foreign ruler.  Asian
 nations which have attained independence from their colonial powers-
 Burma, the Philippines, and India-are still regarded as "colonial," being
 merely under a new form of "imperialist" control rather than genuinely
 independent.
 Guerrilla and para-military forces are important elements in
 Communist attempts to seize power.  Guerrilla leaders are often convinced
 Communists, and intensive efforts are made by the Communist to indoctrinate
 the rank-and-file with Communist theory.   In order to neutralize the armed
 forces of the government, Communists are constantly infiltrating and
 agitating among the most important armed units.
 Communist-led armed forces have been active in all states of
 the Far East (except India, Thailand, and Japan) since World War IL
 Guerrilla forces concentrate on harrassing actions---cutting communications

 and raiding supplies-and generally engage only isolated government
 detachments in battle.  Where the Communists have gained sufficient military
 strength (as in China), large-scale orthodox campaigns are undertaken.
 Guerrilla activity in Southeast Asia my be designed, in part,    cripple
 the economies of those states and thus aid the'Communist effort to destroy
 the Marshall Plan.
 The employment of armed force, leading to territorial control,
 has been principally responsible for Communist successes in recent years in
 China, North Korea, Indochina, Burma, and Malaya.  Armed forces represent a
 major asset of the Communists (in comparison with other Communist resources),
 in Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
 Exists
 d. Exploitation ofLa     row s where a Sizable Proletariat
 Although labor groups in most of Asia are relatively small and
 unorganized, in those areas containing a sizable proletariat the Communists
 employ standard methods, such as general strikes, agitation and propaganda,
 and continual wage demands.     Communist movements derive their principal
 support from urban labor in Japan, India, and Thailand.  Labor provides
 important support to the Communists in China, the Phil ppines, and Korea.
 o, Methods    Control.
 Uniformity of application of Communist doctrine is assured by
 the intensive study and training in Soviet and Communist methods which is
 undertaken by most of the Communist leadership, and by the constant exchange
 of "information" through Soviet and local Communist periodicals, and the
 Cominform Journal,  Specific Soviet instructions for minor policy decisions
 are unnecessary.  Considerable latitude is allowed Communist leaders in the
 application of Communist principles, subject, of course, to review by the
 USSR.

 The CCP has exploited a nationalist and anti-imperialist
 movement in China, for 30 years, and is still doing so.  In each case, its
 principal external "enemy," whether the UK, Japan, or the US, has been the
 power regarded by eoscow as most dangerous to Soviet designs in Asia.
 Founded in 1921, the CCP was quickly accepted into the Comintern.  In 1924,
 the CC?, by direction of the Comintern, entered its first 'united front.'
 In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek, realizing the Soviet-CCP aim of absolute
 domination of China, expelled the Communists from the Kuomintang?  After 10
 years of Communist--Kuomintang military conflict, during which period the
 Communists were always on the defensive, the Communists and the Kuomintang,
 in opposition to Japanese aggression, once again formed a "united front."
 The CCP agreed at this time to abandon its policy of armed insurrection,
 and to give up sole control of its armies; after 1944, however, the
 principal Communist military effort appears to have been directed more
 against the Kuomintang than the Japanese.  In the years of the second
 "united front,"-maintained precariously from 1937 to 1945--the Chinese
 Communists greatly expanded their influence and the territory under their
 control; throughout this period, CCP political tactics were directed toward
 maaintaining, in the Party, the drive toward Communist dictatorship, while
 at the same time attracting the support of patriots, moderates, and
 liberals.  Currently, the CCP's attitude toward the minor parties which
 have attached themselves to.it,$ and which are to participate in the
 "coalition" government, is one of utter cynicism.  These parties, useful
 in conciliating various elements of Chinese society, are to be employed
 briefly as tools of the CCP, and will not be permitted to exercise any
 independent power.
 The "rightist" leadership of the CCP, which had been following
 the orders of the  Comintern, was discredited in 1927 when the CCP was
 expelled from the Kuomirrtangv  The "leftist" leadership which succeeded it,
 from 1928 to 1930, and which also followed Comintern directives, was dis-
 credited by the disastrous failure of its "proletarian revolution."  During
 both of these periods, Mao Tse-tung (now chairman of the CCP) was attempting
 to build the Chinese Communist movement upon an organized and a reed
 peasantry; this policy was endorsed by Stalin, and later, when it seemed
 destined to succeed, by the Comintern.  The CCP's agrarian reform program ---
 reduction of rent, interest-rates and taxes, and the redistribution of land in many areas won for the CCP considerable popular support, indispensable to
 the CCP's early survival, and, later, in waging guerrilla warfare against the
 Japanese and civil war against the Nationalist.  Until recently, however,
 the CCP was not forced to feed the cities at the same time that it
 instituted rural reforms; and there was little popular realization that the
 redistributed land would eventually be collectivized.  This year, the CCP,
 in orthodox fashion, decided to shift the center of gravity of Party work
 from the rural areas to the cities, depriving the peasantry of its place of
 primacy in the revolution.  Recent peasant revolts, however -?- probably in

 response to excessive requisitions of food and men -- presumably have
 impelled the COP to proceed cautiously in its efforts to advance the
 proletariat at the expense of the peasantry.
 After their expulsion from the Kuomintang in 1927, the Chinese
 Communists acquired control of a small area in Southeast China and organized
 an army to protect it.  The Coisnunists expanded and strengthened their
 army, survived repeated Nationalist attacks, and, finally, transferred the
 base of their power to the northwest,  The C'CP saw clearly that the army
 was essential to the control of territory.  For the past 20 years, in fact
 no significant area in China has become Communist other than through
 military occupation.
 During the Sino-Japanese war, the Chinese Communists waged
 successful guerrilla warfare, expanded their territorial control, and moved
 toward Manchuria immediately after V-J Day. Soviet occupation forces
 obstructed the movement of Nationalist troops into Manchuria, and made
 large stocks of Japanese materiel available to Communist forces..  Through-
 out the period of negotiations between the CCP and the Kuomintang, after
 the US had arranged a temporary truce in early 1946, the Communists stead-
 fastly refused to allow their armies, under any political agreement, to be
 broken up and amalgamated into the Nationalist forces.  In the summer of
 1947, the COP began again to realize by predominantly military means its
 goal of domination of all of China.  For the past two years, the strength
 and tactical successes of Chinese Communist military forces have been by
 far the most important of the Party's positive assets, although an equally
 important factor has been the debility, corruption and ineptitude of the
 Nationalist regime.  Communist forces, over-whelmin~gly superior to the
 scattered anti-Communist opposing them, are capable of extending their control
 through almost all of China by the end of 1950.
 The COP's tactics in the "united front" periods were very
 successful, and even now are fairly successful, in conciliating opposition
 to the Communist program among various elements of Chinese society.  In
 Chairman I Q's "New Democracy" (1940), he envisaged a smooth and prolonged
 transition period between the "bourgeois democratic" and "socialist"
 revolutions, solicited the cooperation of the bourgeoisie, stated that the
 Soviet form of government was not practicable for colonial and semi-
 colonial countries, and, in general, m nimized the severity of the social
 and economic measures contemplated by the Communists.  Recently, with military
 victory assured, Chairman IA.O has stated the Communist position much more
 frankly.  MAO now states flatly that the new government of China is to be a
 dictatorship of "the people" (those supporting the CCP) over the
 "reactionaries" (those opposed to the COP), and that only the COP will be
 entrusted with determining the popular will (which, of course, will be
 identical with the desires of the COP leadership),  MAO still proposes to
 cooperate, temporarily, with the middle classes, but he warns his followers
 -5-

 to beware of them, and has emphasized that the middle classes will be
 subordinated to the proletariat.  The welfare of the latter class is to
 be the CCPts primary concern,  In addition, MAO explicity promises the
 collectivization of agriculture; although foreseeing a "grave problem" in
 forcing the peasantry to accept collectivization, N%insists that it must
 and will be done.  MAO's latest statements emphasize that the CCP will
 adopt, wherever practicable, the techniques of the USSR.
 (2)  CCP Aims in Asia.
 The CCP hopes to unite one billion Orientals in a Communist
 Asia, led by the CCP and oriented toward the USSR.  The USSR has perhaps
 delegated to the CCP -- with its overseas branches or cells in every country
 of the Far East -- at least some measure of responsibility for building,
 in MAO's words, "a bulwark of world Communism in Asia."  The principal
 Soviet problem in this effort is perhaps one of retaining control over the
 Asiatic Communist movement..  The CCP's major problem is probably that of
 overcoming the widespread hostility in Asia toward both the alien doctrine
 of Communism and the prospect of Chinese domination.  In addition to the
 great encouragement which Chinese Communist successes presumably have given
 to other Communist movements in Asia, there are likely to be material
 repercussions, especially in those countries neighboring China which have
 large Chinese minorities, well-organized CCP branches on both.  The CCP
 has denounced Western occupation authorities and has made overtures to the
 countries concerned (Japan, South Korea), has denounced "reactionary"
 colonial governments (Indochina, Malaya), threatened retaliation against
 "fascist" native regimes (Thailand, Philippines), attempted to extend its
 influence into native independence movements (Indonesia), promised -
 protection to overseas Chinese commiunities, and greatly expanded its
 influence in such communities.  As the CCP consolidates its control in
 China, there is no doubt that it mill engage in more aggressive operations
 throughout Asia?
 . Korea. ;   -_ -.
 The Communist Party in Korea achieved limited success in
 the years before V-J Day mainly through successful attempts to identify it-
 self with and lead the nationalist, anti-Japanese movement.  The end of the
 war in the Pacific liberated Korea from Japanese control and brought
 military occupation by the US and the USSR.  Since that time, the USSR has
 directly supervised all Communist tactics in Korea with the aim of enforcing
 conversion of the entire countL7 into a "people's democracy" and a Soviet
 satellite.

 (1)  Northern Korea.
 (a)  Development of the Part'.
 Achievement of Communist objectives was simplified
 in the northern zone, where the presence of the Soviet Army made possible
 the immediate establishment of Communist control.  With Soviet assistance
 and direction, a group of native and emigre Korean Communists assumed
 direction of local affairs and gradually established the institutions of a
 "peoples democracy."  Continued Soviet control of all phases of activity is
 ensured, however, by the presence of Soviet political advisers, technicians,
 and military advisers, and through devices such as joint-stock companies
 and barter trade agreements.
 Although police methods give the Communists firm
 control of northern Korea, they are not prepared to adopt immediately the
 political and economic forms of an advanced Soviet state.  The government
 is the standard Communist transitional expedient of a "popular front,"
 designed to lure all progressive, non-reactionary, nationalist parties,
 classes, and social groups into participation in the Communist program.  Al-
 through the Communists do not attempt to conceal and in fact proclaim at
 every opportunity, the dependence on the USSR, they also continue to pose as
 leaders of Korean nationalist, anti-imperialist forces,
 The Communist movement did not achieve sizable
 support from the Korean peasantry before the Liveration.  The land policy used
 in northern Korea since the liberation reflects the semi-colonial state of -
 the economy and the ideological backwardness of the peasants and workers,
 Land was expropriated and redistributed, but title remains vested in local
 Communist government organs (Peoples Committees), and the farmer is
 permitted to occupy land only so long as he is cooperative and meets the
 production and tax quotas of the government.  This technique provides a

 Development of internal security forces and a Peoples
 Army was a matter of first priority in northern Korea, and Soviet troops
 were not withdrawn until the security forces were considered sufficiently
 loyal and strong to maintain Communist control against either internal reaction
 or invasion from southern Korea,,  The Soviet-trained-and-equipped People's
 Arm4Y now has an estimated strength of 56,00 and is expanding.  Internal
 security forces, armed with Soviet and Japanese weapons, number
 approximately 57,000,  The North Korean armed forces could repel an invasion
 from South Korea, but would probably require assistance from Communist China

 for successful offensive action against the defenses of the southern soneq
 Labor and Other Groups.
 Active support for the Communist regime comes from only a small
 minority of the northern Korean people and is centered in labor, youth, and the
 intellectual class.  A large amount of effort is being expended, however,
 to increase the base of support by "educating" the masses while eradicating
 "fuedal" and "colonial" forms of society that inhibit the ideological
 success of Communism.  Attempts are being made to breakdown the traditional
 Confucian family relationships; landlord-peasant relations have been obli-
 terated, Christians have been forced to compromise their faith or suffer
 police action, and the people are continually lectured on the general su-
 periority of Soviet culture, spread through the channels of the North
 Korean Soviet Friendship Associations, and the sending of delegates to
 Soviet-sponsored international conferences, designed to further Soviet
 prestige.
 (2) Southern Korea.
 (a)  The Party and its Methods.
 In southern Korea, the Svoiet aim of enforcing conversion
 of all Korea into a satellite "peoples democracy" has been delayed by the
 presence of US troops, by UN intervention, by the establishment of a
 violently anti-Communist, independent government (the Repthlic of Korea),
 and by continued US military and economic assistance to that regime.
 Communist strategy and tactics have been designed; (1) to end US and UN
 assistance, (2) to induce the collapse of the Republic, and to extend
 Communist control by "unification" of the "fatherland" under the aegis
 of the northern regime.  Soviet directed Cotuminlst, action against the
 principal targets- - US aid, UN support, and the. stabLLity of, the Republic--
 is carried on both within the Republic's borders and from northern Korea,
 while the USSR carries the action against the targets on the international
 stage.
 Nationalism.
 In the first months after V-J Day, Communist strategy called
 for united front tactics in southern Korea to lead all liberal elements
 in a struggle for complete "liberation" and self-government.  The
 complete subservience of the Korean Communist movement  to Soviet direction
 was revealed in January 1946, and the movement lost much of the prestige
 and support it had gained while leading the anti-Japanese resistance.  Al-
 though the Communists continued their attempts to influence and control all
 social and political groups other than "reactionary" elements through
 united front tactics and extensive organizational activity, they were
 gradually isolated and eventually forced completely underground by the

 severe anti-Communist program adopted by the government of the Republic
 after its inauguration in 1948.
 At present, the Communists are increasingly emphasizing united
 front tactics in southern Korea, with appeals to nationalism and attacks
 on US "imperialism," UN interference, and the government of the Republic,
 which is labelled a "tool" of US "colonial policy."  Through the device of
 a "Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland," the Communists
 hope to exploit the universal Korean desire for national unity and to under-
 mine support of the Republic.  If this method, combined with intimidation,
 sabotage, guerrilla activity, infiltration of the government and army, and
 terrorist propaganda, fails to effect the collapse of the Republic, then
 the People*s Arm:? of the North may be used for a full scale invasion to
 "unite" Korea and restore to  power the "rightful" organs of the people, the
 long defunct People's Committees.
 The Communists attempted to gain peasant support in southern Korea
 by the usual slogans calling for expropriation and redistribution of the
 land, and by subtle propaganda calculated to stir peasant resentment against
 the government and the US aid program.  Although the majority of peasants
 have not accepted Communist leadership, a few have been induced to join
 guerrilla bands, and Communist propaganda has often been successful in
 confusing or misleading the farmer on matters of vital local concern.
 Successful land reforms in southern Korea and knowledge of the unhappy results
 of Communist "land reforms" in northern Korea have lessened the effectiveness
 of Communist appeals to the peasants in the southern zone.
 After the collapse of the Communist united front movement in
 early 1946, the Communists turned increasingly to violence, which resulted in
 their being forced underground.  Underground activity, supported by funds,
 trained agents and propaganda from the USSR, and by infiltrated guerrillas from
 northern Korea, now includes a broad variety of standard Communist
 techniques designed to alienate the people from the Republic, to undermine the
 government's stability, to increase fear of Communist strength in Asia, to
 effect the collapse of resistance to Corrmiunist domination, or to weaken
 resistance sufficiently to facilitate invasion by the People's Army..
 Communist propaganda claims the re-establishment of People's Committees in
 areas "liberated" by the guerrilla forces, but actually the guerrillas have not
 attempted to hold territory, as their capabilities do not exceed hit-and-run
 raids on isolated villages.
 Propaganda dissemination to aid the accomplishment of ultimate
 political control is closely integrated with all Communist. activity.  Bauch of
 the propaganda work is carried on by agents on the local levels in the form of
 "education" and indoctrination of peasants, workers, and students, in order to
 secure their support for immediate Party objectives.  In their effort to vein

 control, the Communists appeal for support to all classes except the landlords,
 "pro-Japanese traitors," and "reactionary tools of American Imperialism."
 Although the greatest effort is directed toward youth groups, workers and
 peasants, Communist slogans and propaganda are slanted to appeal to the
 particular grievances and aspirations of all classes.
 (b)  Relations with Chinese Corm mists.
 Communist successes in China have contributed greatly to the
 confidence of the northern Korean regime and have increased the fear in
 southern Korea that eventual Communist domination is inevitable.  The CCP
 maintains close liaison with northerniorean leaders, has agents in the
 outhern.one, and can provide ,,ilitary and economic assistance to the
 northern regime  f is so chooses. It is anticipated that, in the event of a
 northern Korean regime decision, to invade southern Korea, military assistance
 would be provided by the CCP.  Although several Korean Communist leaders have
 close ties with the CCP through years of work in Yenan and with the 8th Route
 Army, the influence and control of the USSR remains paramount.

 Cm,,unist motet has appeared in Laos or Cambodia..  By 1930, three
 different parties in Vietzt, each of which described itself as Ccm-
 munist, were merged to form the Indochinese Communist Party, an affiliate
 of the Third International. Repression undertaken by the French Admin-
 istration during the-early 19301s crippled the activities of the young
 Party.  Nevertheless, in World 'tar II, the C  aunist became increasingly-
 active, following the Japanese occupation of Indochina, and foamed the
 aggressive anti-Vichy and anti.- a se nucleus within the vale
 resistance organization known as the Viet Minh4
 The basic Cast appeal in Indochina, as elsewhere
 in southeast Asia, has been to nationaliam, and, in the interest of a'
 united front,, the Party declared its own dissolution in November 3.945*
 Individual Communists were invited to join the Association for M,axxist
 Studies, a foram for discussion of Marx m,  A coalition of nationalist
 parties and associations, including the Communists, then formed the
 Democratic Republic of Viet Ibm.  The President is Ho Chi Minh, a
 Moscow-trained Est leaders        The most powerful political force
 in the Republic is the Viet Minh Front, which embraces most of the parties
 in the resistance and enjoys a position in the Ho Chi Minh regime
 approaching one-party rule.  Lost, but not all,, of the important members
 of this Front are former members of the Indochinese Communist Party.
 Vietnamese Communist control of the policy of the resistance goverment
 is probably considerable, though not necessarily absolute.  The Demo-
 cratic Republic of Vietnam appears, at the present time, to be` something
 between a genuine, well-balanced coalition and a monolithic structure
 in which Commmist domination is coemplete and unchallenged.  The policy
 of the government is not., strictly speaking,  ` , nisi policy; it is
 the policy of a government in which Ca    tLists play a dominant role.
 Very little is kwan of Communist policy which is
 carried out independently of the Ho Government.  The Association for
 Marxist Studies, which carries on a characteristic Coy monist party line
 propaganda, is nominally a private oration, although it is said to
 have the blessing of the resistance government.  Reports that the Viet
 Minh Front promotes Communist objectives throueft its extensive organiza-
 tion, including secret schools for the training of political agents, are
 difficult to confirm  It may be assumed that the Vietnamese Communists
 continue to constitute a tightly-knit faction which is attempting to
 promote its own collective ends by covert propaganda.  The prominent
 positions enjoyed in the present government and in the directing cocr
 mi ttee (Tong rio) of the Viet L nh wont by former members of the Indo-
 chinese Communist Party put them in a highly advantageous position where
 these ends are concerned.  All political parties in    tnaml, however,
 have    ira l-y svbordinated their respective policies to support of the
 Ho regime and the attains nt of national independence and unity.

 to the total population, the Communist movement is of little significance;
 it is,howx, achieving results disproportionate to its numerical strength
 and is wielding a growing influence as China progressively falls under
 Communist domination,
 Only during the last vrar has there been any identi-
 fication by the Communists with a nationalist and anti   erialist

 isolationist and nationalist sentiments.  The Chinese, particularly,

 in neighboring areas,  The TCP in 3,947, by publicly denying that its
 objectives parallel those of the Chinese movement, tacitly admitted that
 association with the Chinese in Thailand is politically damaging,  In

 Although sporadic Communistic activities' were
 carried on by a small group of Burmese during the mac -1930'x, a choesive

 munist-inclined Bucmase united in common opposition to the Japanese
 Primarily responsible for the amalgamation of various elements of the
 resistance into the Anti-Fascist Peoples' I`reedom league (AFPFL),
 members of the Burmese Cormunist Party (BCP, organized in 1944) held
 key positions in this organization until an opposition group Td thin
 the AFI'FZ split the Party and forced the withdrawal of both factions.
 The Corununist Party of Buzma (CPB)s popularly called Red flags' was
 organized in March 1946 as an oatgrowth of the BCP and almost immediately
 commenced a campaign of violence.  The BOP, temporarily avoidng violence,
 unsuccessfully sought a rapprochement with the AML-supported covern-
 znerrto  In January 1948 the BCP radically altered its policies, and,
 after a series of strikes and a campaign of vilification against the
 Burmese Goverment, began a full- iedged Comnruni.ct insurrection.
 Both the B    Communist Party and the Commnist
 Party (Burma) are attempting, by a variety of methods, to under. ne and
 discredit the Burmese Governnnt's authority.  The most effective poli-
 tical technique has been the exploitation of the intense Burmese nation-
 alismo            Their claims of being the only true nationalists in Burma, and
 their accusations that the existing government is perpetuating Burma's
 political and economic bondage though subservience to Anglo-American
 "capitalist-inrperi,al4 stsg 9 have gained fairly ride acceptance.  The
 ( omaruu fists also attack the germ nt as Fascist, corrupt and a supporter
 of landlordism.  Simultaneouslty, the        sts are making a determined
 effort to combine as zany dissident and disgruntled groups as possible

 today--..P- .gong, central zed, woll-d sciplined organization with
 repaidly increasing membership and considern:ole influence in labor unions
 and peasant organizations-- began its development in 1920,  From an
 estimated two or three thousand ors in July 191-.2 -the CPI had gam
 to 9,000 by April of 19113, to 25,000 by March of 1911,, and, at the
 present time., probably to some 80,000 enrolled meters.  If to the latter
 are added those peasantts, who, though not technically members of the
 party nevertheless subscribe heartily to Communist doctrines and have

 more.
