 IRAQ-IRAN: More Airstrikes Against Shipping
 Iraqi aircraft hit an Iranian convoy en route to Bandar-e Khomeyni
 yesterday.
 Baghdad claims to have hit four ships yesterday. At least one
 Greek merchant ship was heavily damaged, according to the shipping
 company. This was the third Iraqi attack in the Persian Gulf in less
 than a week.
 A South Korean ship on contract to ARAMCO exploded and sank
 on Tuesday in the same general area of the Gulf where a Greek tanker
 was hit by an Iraqi missile on the same day. US diplomats in Saudi,
 Arabia say that one crewman was killed and three are missing.

 The Syrians are trying to stop the interfactional fighting around
 Beirut, but they are unlikely to push for major changes that would
 upset the current balance of religious representation in the Lebanese
 Government.
 Comment: Damascus is turning its attention to stabilizing the
 situation in and around Beirut, now that the Lebanese-Israeli accord
 has been abrogated and the US Multinational Force contingent has
 been withdrawn. The Syrians believe their best approach is to try to
 maintain a balance of forces among the factions.
 The Syrians hope that a firm cease-fire negotiated at their behest
 will restore their credibility following their failure to impose a
 settlement at Lausanne. They want to demonstrate that they can
 succeed where the US failed.
 Damascus favors some concessions to the Druze and the Muslims
 on sharing political power, but it still wants to preserve the current
 makeup of the Lebanese Government and retain a Christian
 president. The Syrians fear that the Christian community would react
 to the loss of the presidency by establishing a separate ministate with
 close ties to Israel. They also are concerned that a major shift in
 power to the Muslims might provoke Israeli military intervention.

 USSR-LEBANON: Increasing Political Contacts
 The Soviets are increasing their contacts with Lebanese leaders,
 but they are likely to continue deferring to Syria's special role in
 Karen Brutents, Deputy Chief of the International Department of
 the Communist Party's Central Committee, is to arrive in Beirut next
 In the last two months Brutents and his chief, Boris Ponomarev,
 have consulted in Moscow with Druze leader Junblatt and Lebanese
 Communist Party chief Hawi. Hawi also met with Politburo member
 Aliyev two weeks ago in Damascus, and the Soviet Ambassador in
 Beirut recently has had meetings with Lebanese Shia leaders.
 Soviet media coverage of the Lebanese national reconciliation
 conference in Lausanne has been cautiously optimistic. The Soviets
 have welcomed the abrogation of the Israeli-Lebanese accord and
 efforts toward constitutional reform. A leading Soviet expert on the
 Middle East, according to the US Embassy in Moscow, told Lebanese
 officials earlier this week that the USSR accepted Syria's decision not
 to push for Gemayel's ouster or for internal reforms, in return for his
 renunciation of the accord.
 The USSR, however, has balanced this positive treatment with
 greater emphasis on Syria's so-called special interests in Lebanon. A
 Soviet television commentator contrasted US claims of vital interests
 in Lebanon with Syria's historical and geographical interests there.
 Comment: Brutents's trip was originally planned for last month,
 but it evidently was postponed when Andropov died. He is likely to
 explore prospects for closer bilateral ties and to gauge prospects for
 Although the Soviets seem to be developing their own
 channels for dealing with Beirut, the commentator's remarks indicate
 they are likely to continue deferring to Damascus on Lebanese issues.

 NICARAGUA: Reactions to Port Mining
 A high-level Sandinista military delegation left yesterday for the             25X1
 USSR and North Korea.
 Defense Minister Humberto Ortega will head a military delegation
 to Moscow and P'yongyang that includes the commanders of the
 Navy and the tank corps. The Sandinistas recently said that they were
 seeking minesweeping equipment and that Vietnam had offered
 unspecified military aid.
 The UN Security Council will meet today to hear Sandinista
 complaints about the mining. Nicaragua also has announced that it
 has sent emissaries to the Contadora group to ask that it take
 emergency action to contain increasing acts of aggression. Junta
 Coordinator Daniel Ortega made a hurried trip to Mexico last week to
 appeal to President de la Madrid.
 Meanwhile, Honduras has protested Nicaraguan threats that
 regional revolutionaries will retaliate by mining Central American
 harbors. The Hondurans say that these statements undercut the
 Contadora peace talks and demonstrate Sandinista control over
 regional leftists.
 Comment: The USSR might agree to provide minesweeping
 equipment and possibly technical experts, but it would be unlikely for
 now to send minesweepers from its Navy. It also probably is willing to
 provide more equipment for the Army and to continue to use Bulgaria
 to deliver major weapons. North Korea gave Nicaragua two patrol
 boats last fall, and it may provide similar equipment.
 The Contadora mediators presumably have been reluctant to call
 an emergency meeting because they fear it would complicate
 progress in the negotiations and compromise their neutrality.
 Nonetheless, they may publicize Nicaragua's deteriorating security
 situation at a meeting scheduled for next week. To counteract
 Nicaragua's complaint, the other Central Americans probably will say
 that Managua's threats of retaliation and recourse to the Security
 Council undermine regional negotiations.

 USSR-CHINA: Talks in Moscow Concluded
 The fourth round of Sino-Soviet consultations, which began on
 12 March, ended in Moscow last week, with both sides taking a tough
 line on the major issues but indicating willingness to continue the            25X1
 Both sides say the talks were "frank and calm" and will resume in
 Beijing this October. The Chinese negotiator paid the usual courtesy
 call on Foreign Minister Gromyko before returning home.
 Deputy Foreign Minister Qian stated privately on 17 March that
 China has no interest in a basic document regulating bilateral
 relations as long as Moscow gives no hint of a willingness to
 compromise on key issues. He also said Beijing is not interested in
 "confidence-building measures" similar to those being aired at the
 Conference on Disarmament in Europe.
 Chinese officials following the talks have indicated that no
 progress was made on the chief points in dispute. Soviet officials,
 unlike the Chinese, have not responded to US requests for
 information on'the subject.
 Deng Xiaoping and Premier Zhao Ziyang told visiting Japanese
 Prime Minister Nakasone last weekend that China still views the
 USSR as the "main threat to its security." The Soviet media were
 prompt to criticize the "anti-Soviet motif" of the Sino-Japanese talks.
 They also have repeated new criticisms by Mongolia and Vietnam of
 China's attempts to raise issues involving those countries at the Sino-
 Comment: Neither side anticipated much movement at this round
 of talks, which came just a month after Andropov's death. The
 Chinese leaders' remarks on the Soviet threat were designed to show
 common cause with Japan without jeopardizing the dialogue with             25X1
 The Soviets are reluctant to inject new problems into their
 relations with China. Nonetheless, they remain determined to respond
 to Chinese public statements they regard as particularly offensive-
 such as those made during Nakasone's visit. Meanwhile, they are as
 willing as the Chinese to continue expanding contacts in economic,         25X1
 cultural, and other fields.

 The announcement yesterday by Jardine Matheson, Hong Kong's
 leading trading company, that it plans to move its legal domicile to
 Bermuda has stunned the colony and sent its stock market plunging.
 A simultaneous decision by Hutchison Whampoa, another major
 trading company, to pay a large bonus dividend to shareholders
 rather than to reinvest profits in the company, is being viewed in
 financial circles as showing a lack of confidence in Hong Kong's
 future. The announcements drove the Hong Kong stock market down
 7 percent in the first hour of trading, which is the biggest drop in one
 day since last September.
 Government authorities have labeled Jardine's move a
 commercial decision. Communist-controlled newspapers in the
 colony, however, have suggested that it was made in consultation
 with the UK in an attempt to influence continuing negotiations over
 Hong Kong's future.
 Comment: Although the British have tried to play on investors'
 concerns about the economy in past negotiations with the Chinese,
 Jardine's decision probably was taken unilaterally and primarily to put
 itself into position to move funds out of Hong Kong quickly if
 necessary. Jardine will maintain its headquarters office in Hong Kong.
 Nevertheless, Jardine's announcement has split the united front
 of businessmen who previously had been trying to maintain a show of
 confidence in the colony's future. Although Jardine's action could
 start a snowball effect among other firms, most probably will not
 decide until after Beijing announces its intentions regarding the
 colony in September.

 CHINA-VIETNAM: Alleged Air Incident
 Beijing has announced that on Tuesday Chinese Air Force
 gunners fired on and damaged a Vietnamese MIG-21 that flew over
 Pingxiang.
 Comment: This is the first announcement of an air incident by
 either side since border tension increased in early February. Beijing
 probably is using the alleged incident, which Vietnam has denied, as a
 warning to Hanoi not to increase the level of attacks against
 Kampuchean resistance bases along the Thai border. China has
 enough forces on the Vietnamese border to conduct artillery barrages
 and limited assaults across the frontier. There are no indications,
 however, that the Chinese have deoloved forces on a scale needed for
 an invasion.

 Top Secret
 The recent killing of several hundred Somali tribesmen in Kenya's
 North-Eastern Province could become a political problem for
 President Moi.                               two ethnic Somali
 subclans clashed last month and Kenyan troops were sent in to
 restore order. The troops killed a number of tribesmen, the
 government subsequently withheld food and water from prisoners,
 and word of a "massacre" has begun to leak. Mogadishu so far has
 not made an issue of the incident, but Moi has been minimizing the
 seriousness of the event and has been stalling relief operations in
 order to keep foreign observers out of the area.
 Comment: The region long has been troubled by tribal tensions.
 Nonetheless, continued mishandling of the situation by the
 government and further attempts by Moi to conceal developments
 could damage him in the eyes of some international donors and
 jeopardize badly needed Western aid.
 ZIMBABWE: Restrictions on Payments Overseas
 Zimbabwe's Finance Minister on Tuesday announced major new
 restrictions on foreign payments. Rent and dividend income payable
 abroad on investments made in Zimbabwe before September 1979
 have been suspended for at least one year. In addition, foreign
 securities held by commercial banks in Zimbabwe-but controlled by
 the government under preindependence regulations-will be
 nationalized, with the current owners paid in Zimbabwean dollars.
 These measures-and other lesser restrictions-are projected to
 boost foreign exchange availability by about $215 million over the
 next year.
 Comment: The restrictions are prompted by a deteriorating
 balance-of-payments position. Large scheduled repayments on short-
 term debt this year will increase the pressure, as will a rising bill for
 imported corn because of continuing drought. Although Zimbabwe
 apparently will continue to permit remittances of up to 50 percent of
 dividends on investments made after the cutoff date, the new
 measures cast further doubt on alread dim prospects for new foreign
 investment.

 Western Europe
 - West German security officials believe that the tactics used
 in committing a bank robbery in Wuerzburg indicate that the
 Red Army Faction was responsible. The group has been
 inactive since 1982 as a result of the government's
 successful counterterrorist operations. It has traditionally
 used funds obtained from bank robberies to finance its
 terrorist attacks.
 Latin America
 - Five bomb attacks that apparently were coordinated were
 carried out on Monday in Honduras against several
 government installations and the Salvadoran Consulate. A
 radical leftist terrorist group reportedly has claimed
 responsibility for the bombings, which may have been
 intended to protest the election in El Salvador or the mining
 of Nicaraguan waters by anti-Sandinista forces.

 Special Analysis
 USSR-US: Emerging Arms Control Strategy
 The Soviets continue to maintain an intransigent position on the
 resumption of START and INF. At the same time, they profess interest
 in progress on other security issues, apparently with the aims of
 avoiding the charge of intransigence on arms control while probing for
 US flexibility. The Soviets, however, appear skeptical about the
 chances for progress. They would demand a high price for any move
 that would strengthen President Reagan's prospects for reelection by
 improving bilateral relations.
 General Secretary Chernenko, in a speech on 2 March, said that a
 "breakthrough" in bilateral relations is possible if the US moves on
 secondary security issues. Some Soviets have suggested that such a
 step could improve the atmosphere for resuming START and INF
 talks. The USSR, however, would be unlikely to agree to do so for at
 least the next several months unless the US indicated it would
 accommodate some Soviet concerns on the major issues.
 Two Soviet diplomats in Washington have indicated privately that
 Moscow would resume INF talks this year if the US agreed to a
 moratorium on further INF deployments, or to the inclusion of British
 and French systems somewhere in the arms control talks. On the
 other hand, a TASS analyst on Sunday attributed talk of a freeze on
 INF deployments to "unseemly maneuvers" by the West.
 In meetings in Moscow earlier this month with senior US arms
 control specialists and former government officials-under the
 auspices of the Dartmouth Conference-and with leaders of the West
 German Social Democratic Party, Soviet officials rejected the idea of
 merging START and INF. Some implied and others asserted that
 neither negotiation could resume unless NATO's new intermediate-
 range missiles were withdrawn from Western Europe.
 In addition, some Soviets at the Dartmouth Conference dismissed
 the "walk-in-the-woods" formula, which would have banned the
 Pershing II and called for equal launcher levels of US ground-
 launched cruise missiles and SS-20s in Europe. By rejecting both this
 formula and a merger of the talks, the Soviets may have wanted to
 dampen speculation that such avenues could lead to a revival of the
 talks. As recently as January, some Soviets had raised such a
 possibility.

 Other Security Issues
 The chief of the USSR's delegation at the UN Conference on
 Disarmament in Geneva recently told some East Europeans that
 Moscow wants "meaningful progress" on chemical weapons and that
 its agreement last month to consider continuous international
 inspection of destruction sites reflected this. The Soviets reportedl
 are drafting their own chemical weapons treaty.
 The Soviets also have maintained a businesslike manner in the
 recently reconvened Standing Consultative Commission as well as in
 working-level discussions with the US on nuclear nonproliferation and
 crisis communications. In his speech, Chernenko implied that
 progress was possible in these areas.
 At the Committee on Disarmament in Europe in Stockholm, the
 Soviets have taken every opportunity to criticize INF deployments but
 have not categorically rejected Western proposals for confidence-
 and security-building measures. In this forum, they have made nonuse
 of force their key proposal.
 In addition, the Soviets have resumed MBFR talks in Vienna. A
 deputy director of the Institute for the USA and Canada has said,
 however, that the USSR would not have done so if those talks had
 Moscow's Motivations
 Moscow's current unyielding position enables it to delay a major
 adjustment in its arms control policy while continuing to assess
 political developments in the US and Washington's interest in
 improving bilateral ties.
 The Soviets have indicated on a number of occasions that they do
 not want to take steps that would improve President Reagan's
 prospects for reelection. Soviet media cite the status of bilateral
 relations as an issue that could strengthen the Democratic Party's
 candidate. Moscow may calculate that election pressures will increase
 the administration's desire for an agreement and that it thus would be          25X1
 willing to make concessions to get one.

 These considerations suggest the Soviets would be reluctant to
 take steps to improve bilateral relations before the elections without
 exacting a substantial price. They may calculate that their continued
 intransigence on resuming the talks will best serve these objectives
 and increase domestic political and international pressure on the US
 to modify its position on arms control.
 Moreover, the Soviets also may want to await the outcome of the
 vote in the Netherlands on deployment, hoping that a negative
 decision would provoke a government crisis and disrupt NATO unity
 on INF. Recent statements to a Dutch newspaper by an arms control
 specialist on the Soviet General Staff indicate that Soviet insistence
 on removing INF missiles as a precondition for resumption of the
 Geneva talks is intended in part to influence this debate.
 Moscow's heightened activity in other arms control areas-on
 which progress would not require reversals of fundamental US or
 Soviet positions-appears designed to test US intentions. Soviet
 public statements indicate that Moscow is informed about debate
 within the US Government on these issues. At the same time,
 continued Soviet participation in multilateral forums, notably MBFR,
 and Soviet initiatives on other security issues help them to counter
 Western skepticism resulting from their walkout from, and refusal to
 return to, the Geneva talks.
