HIGHLIGHTS 
It has become increasingly clear during the past 
week that the strenuous efforts of the USSR to forestall 
the Atlantic Pact are defeating themselves. Not only have 
these Soviet efforts failed to deter Norway and Denmark, 
but they have tended to strengthen support for the Atlantic 
Pact in France and Italy (see page 5). The recent speeches 
by Communist Leaders Thorez and Togliatti, declaring 
that Western Europeans would welcome invading Soviet 
forces, have been followed by a call for increased Commu-
nist militancy, suggesting that greater emphasis will be 
placed upon Communist sabotage and subversion in the 
future. 
The dogged refusal of the Dutch to restore the 
leaders of the Indonesian Republic to governmental author-
ity has continued during the past week to keep the Indo-
nesian dispute in a deadlock (see page 9). Republican 
leaders point out that this refusal conflicts with the UN 
Security Council's 28 January resolution and prevents them 
from legally participating in the proposed 12 March round 
table conference at The Hague. As a consequence of this 
new impasse, the dispute will probably be brought before 
the Security Council once again. Meanwhile, Belgium and 
Luxembourg are displaying a growing anxiety about the 
steady drain upon Dutch finances entailed by the Indonesian 
problem and about the wisdom of proceeding with measures 
which would make the Benelux economic union fully effective 
(see page 2).

WESTERN EUROPE 
Benelux Union Development of the Benelux economic union 
may be retarded seriously by the prolonged 
Dutch impasse in Indonesia. Belgium has always been reluc-
tant to share the burden of the less favorable economic and 
financial conditions in the Netherlands. The lack of progress 
toward a solution in Indonesia and the consequent heavy drain 
on Dutch finances have augmented Belgian anxiety about em-
barking on a full economic union with the Netherlands by 1 Janu-
ary 1950, the present target date. Further measures for 
establishing a full economic union will be discussed at a 
10 March meeting of the Benelux ministers. If no solution 
to the Indonesian dispute is in sight by that time, the Belgian 
and Luxembourg ministers will hesitate to make any definite 
commitments, and it is thus increasingly doubtful that Benelux 
will have progressed much beyond a limited customs union 
by 1950. Political considerations, however, may force the 
establishment in name only of an economic union, with imple-
mentation delayed until economic conditions in the Netherlands 
improve. 
GERMANY 
Status of Berlin As one of the perinheral results of the 
Berlin blockade, the question of the re-
lationship of western Berlin to western Germany is becom-
ing more pressing in its effects upon both German morale 
and over-all occupation policy. The economic and financial 
burden on western Germans and Berliners of maintaining 
the blockade is creating political pressure for making west-
ern Berlin the 12th Laender in the new west German state. 
Presently, more than half the bizonal administrative budget

GERMANY 
for 1949 is earmarked for the relief of Berlin. Thus, resent-
ment is increasing on the part of the west Germans over the 
heavy financial obligations which they feel have been imposed 
by the occupying powers; this resentment is being expressed 
by demands to include west Berlin in west Germany, a solu-
tion bitterly opposed by the French. The citizens of Berlin, 
although determined to continue resisting the Soviet blockade 
to the limit of their economic and financial resources, are 
seeking a more formal assurance of security than that offered 
by the airlift. They, too, would like to have western Berlin 
Incorporated into western Germany. West Berliners are 
acutely aware of their crucial role in the east-west struggle 
and feel they should enjoy maximum security in return for 
the risk they have assumed in cooperating fully with the 
western powers in their decision to run the Berlin blockade 
Indefinitely. Meanwhile, the west Berliners are magnifying 
their financial difficulties in the hope of hastening the intro-
duction of the western mark as the sole currency in western 
Berlin; such a step, they feel, would greatly increase the 
possibility of later incorporation of Berlin into the new west 
German government. 
TRIESTE 
Italian Nationalism Growing Italian nationalism will make 
rapprochement between the Italians 
and Slovenes in Trieste more difficult and threatens to 
complicate administration of the area. Italian officials in 
Trieste are opposing the inclusion of the Slovene minority 
(some 20%) in the local administration. Italians regard 
the forthcoming Trieste elections as an unofficial plebiscite 
on the future disposition of the city. To prevent competi-
tion among pro-Italian parties, Italian officials in Rome

favor a single electoral ticket composed of as many of these 
parties as possible, including even neo-Fascist groups. Such 
a policy, if agreed to by the Italian parties in Trieste, would 
alienate both non-Communist Slovenes in the area and Italians 
with moderate leftist leanings. Such an emphasis on nation-
alist issues would also heighten Italo-Slovene racial antagon-
ism, which is already being exploited by pro-Yugoslav Com-
munists. Moreover, accentuation of the nationalist issue will 
make administration of the area more difficult whether by 
US-UK military forces, by a UN governors or by the Italians. 
FRANCE 
Inflation Ends The inflationary trend in France appears to 
be drawing to a close. if prices continue 
to decline and the Third Force Government can follow through 
with economic measures already initiated, France has an 
excellent chance of attaining by spring a degree of economic 
and financial stability that will permit ECA aid to be used 
more for long-range constructive projects than for immediate 
prevention of economic colipase.

EASTERN EUROPE 
SOVIET UNION 
Propaganda Offensive Strenuous Soviet efforts to forestall 
the proposed Atlantic Pact are, by 
their very intensity, generally producing results opposite to 
those desired by the Kremlin. The recent speeches by Com-
munist Leaders Thorez and Togliatti can be expected, if 
anything, to intensify existing support in France and Italy 
for the Pact. By publicly asserting that Communists in these 
countries would welcome invading Soviet forces, these leaders 
hoped to increase the fear of war and of Soviet occupation d 
Western Europe and also to demonstrate the unreliability of 
both France and Italy as prospective Pact members. This 
type of attack, however, tends to reinforce other factors that 
have been weakening Communist influence as a political force 
In France and Italy. Moreover, Communist leaders, by call-
ing for a return to Communist militancy comparable to that 
CL the late 1920's, are preparing the way for greater emphasis 
on sabotage and subversion. 
Meanwhile, increased Soviet propaganda pressure on 
Scandinavia iz also having little effect. The USSR may soon 
revive the Spitsbergen issue by asking Norway for assurances 
that no military bases will be built in the Spitsbergen archi-
pelago. The Kremlin will probably claim that any defense 
preparations in the area would be a violation d the Spitsbergen 
Treaty of 1920. The Kremlin, anticipating Norwegian rejection 
CL the Soviet-proposed non-aggression pact, is already accus-
ing Norway cl "aggression" and may use this as an excuse 
for demands on Finland, possibly by proposing joint Soviet-
Finnish defense discussions. These prospective maneuvers

probably would not change Norway's desire to join the Pact, 
and Finland's present Social Democratic Government would 
probably reject any such Soviet proposals. The Finnish Govern-
ment may be strengthened by the inclusion of representatives 
of other non-Communist parties and thus be prepared to offer 
stronger opposition to future Soviet demands. 
Merchant Shipping The USSR is attempting more and more 
frequently to force the masters of foreign 
vessels to open safes and sealed envelopes during calls at 
Soviet-controlled ports. Such incidents have involved merchant 
ships of the US, the UK, and other western powers. The USSR 
probably hopes to obtain intelligence which would disclose the 
disposition of western merchant shipping if hostilities broke 
out.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA 
PALESTINE 
Armistice Results The military changes wrought by the 
Israeli-Egyptian armistice have not, 
In practice reduced the effective military control over the, 
Negeb which Israel gained in its latest military offensive. 
The armistice providdd for: (1) the release of the Egyptian 
brigade at Faluja (already returned to Egypt); (2) the demili-
tarization of a neutral zone around El Auja; and (3) the with-
drawal of all but "defensive forces" by Israel from the 
western Negeb and by Egypt from both the Gaza coastal 
strip and from Egyptian territory east of the El Auil-El Auja 
line. Although this partial demilitarization of the Israeli-
Egyptian border areas will give each state a greater feeling 
of security against sudden aggression by the other, the reten-
tion of Israeli "defensive forces" in the Jewish settlements 
will assure Israel of continued control of the western Negeb. 
Moreover, agreement on these military changes, despite 
Egyptian claims to the contrary, will probably set the pattern 
for the territorial division of Palestine in the final political 
settlement. 
The armistice made no changes in the disposition of 
Arab and Jewish forces in the eastern Negeb. Beersheba 
was omitted from the armistice provisions on the grounds 
that its control would be determined by a separate arrange-
ment between Israel and Transjordan. Any changes in north-
ern and central Palestine will depend upon the conclusion of 
Israel's current negotiations with Transjordan at Rhodes and 
with Lebanon at the border town of Ras Naqura, as well as on 
any arrangements which may be made with Syria (and possibly 
Iraq). The major issue of the Ras Naqura negotiations is the 
withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon. At Rhodes,

the Transjordan delegates are believed ready to sign a 
straightforward agreement formalizing the present military 
situation in central Palestine, although there is some doubt 
how such an agreement can be reached without the concur-

which, like Syria, has shown no enthusiasm for any kind of 
negotiation with Israel.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Disunity Acting President Li Tsung-jen is making some 
progress in undermining the influence of General-
issimo Chiang Kai-shek in the operation of the National Gov-
eminent. Chinese Communist Leaders Mao Tse-tung and 
Chou En-lai have granted an interview to Li's peace mission, 
which reports that the Communist leaders have agreed in 
principle to the reopening of certain lines of communication 
between Communist and Nationalist China. A Communist 
broadcast has indicated that formal peace negotiations proba-
bly will begin shortly. Li's indefatigable efforts to make 
peace have won him growing popular support in Nationalist 
China, and he has shown political astuteness in persuading 
recalcitrant Cabinet President Sun Fo to come to Nanking 
from Canton for the opening of the Legislative Yuan. Des-
pite these gains, however, Li may be forced into some sort 
of compromise with Chiang as long as the latter controls 
the bulk of the National Government's monetary reserves 
and banking facilities.

Jogjakarta, with: (I) the Netherlands Government firmly 
maintaining that such restoration would mark the return 
to chaos and the end of law and order recently gained through 
Dutch "police action"; and (2) Republican leaders contending 
that unless they return to Jogjakarta they cannot speak with 
sufficient authority to stop guerrilla fighting. Since the Dutch 
position is in conflict with the 28 January Sc resolution instruct-
ing the Dutch to deal with a restored Republican government, 
the Netherlands Government will appear at a distinct dis-
advantage before the SC. Pressure from the Asiatic states 
will compel the SC to reaffirm its January resolution, an 
action which has already received strong US and UK support. 
In fact, all parties except the Dutch insist that the Republican 
government be restored as a negotiating authority. Under 
these circumstances, the SC will probably instruct the UN 
Commission for Indonesia to seek a solution resolving this 
impasse and will agree to an extension of its timetable for 
establishing an Indonesian government. Indications that the 
Dutch would be receptive to the restoration of Republican 
governmental authority, in northern Sumatra suggest the 
possibility of a compromise along these lines.

embarrassing ally, he cannot afford to lose Kach's army 
support while the navy is still exerting strong pressure 
against his regime. The possibility of renewed hostilities 
between army and navy factions makes a political solution 
to the present situation particularly desirable. Therefore, 
Phibul may be prepared to make further concessions to the 
pro-Pridi opposition.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
Caribbean Tension Despite the success of the Council of 
the Organization of American States 
(COAS) in achieving a temporary settlement of the Costa 
Rican-Nicaraguan dispute, the Pact of Friendship signed by 
the two countries will do little to alleviate tension in Central 
America. By urging that any similar difficulties be resolved 
In the future by consultation between the two Governments, 
COAS has merely postponed solution of the basic disagree-
ments between Somoza's Nicaraguan dictatorship and the 
"democratic" regime of President Figueres in Costa Rica. 
Although COAS fully exposed Somoza's complicity in 
the December 1948 revolt against Costa Rica, Nicaragua has 
nevertheless profited from the settlement. Somoza can point 
to the agreement as proof of his willingness to negotiate; 
furthermore, as a result of the negotiations, he has achieved 
his principal objective in supporting the Costa Rican resolu-
tionaries, namely to forestall or at least delay a revolt against 
himself by the Costa Rican-based Caribbean Legion. 
Costa Rica, on the other hand, remains in the same 
Insecure position with regard to Nicaragua as it did before 
COAS intervened. The settlement provides no adequate 
guarantees against future action by Nicaragua. Moreover, 
Costa Rica has in effect been ordered to expel the anti-Somoza 
Caribbean Legion. President Figueres is therefore faced with 
these alternatives: (1) if he disbands the Legion, he loses his 
only protection against Somoza and the Calderon Guardia rebels; 
and (2) if he allows the Legion to remain, he will be subject to 
continued Nicaraguan pressure for its removal.

Peru-Colombia Mounting tension between Peru and Colombia 
may lead to some violence, but it is unlikely 
that full-scale warfare will result. For weeks, the Colombian 
Government has unsuccessfully sought safe conduct for Haya 
de la Torre, the fugitive APRA leader now in sanctuary at the 
Colombian Embassy in Lima. Colombia is accusing the Peru-
vian Government of deliberately seeking an international 
incident in order to distract attention from Peru's desperate 
domestic economic troubles. The Foreign Minister of Colom-
bia is reportedly giving serious consideration to severing 
diplomatic relations with Peru and referring the matter to 
the Organization of American States. In the military field, 
Colombia has concluded an informal agreement with Ecuador 
against possible aggression and is quietly reinforcing garri-
SOnS along the Peruvian border. There are no indications 
that Peru has taken any countermeasures.
