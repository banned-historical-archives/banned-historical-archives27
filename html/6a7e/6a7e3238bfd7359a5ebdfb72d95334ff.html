 Introduction
 By May 1958 the Chinese Communist regime was well along
 in the process of mobilizing all the resources of Chinese
 society for the task of attaining a tremendous increase in
 all fields of production and construction.  While a rapid
 advance was encouraged in many spheres of activity in China,
 the primary objective of the Ta Yueh Chin--the "great leap
 forward"--was an acceleration of economic development.
 The second session of the Eighth Congress of the Chi-
 nese Communist party, held in May 1958, was dominated by
 Liu Shao-chi's report on the work of the central committee.
 This report reviewed all aspects of party policy, but the
 emphasis was on developments in economic work.
 Liu Shao-chi's report was, in essence, a review and
 critique of the course of Chinese economic planning lAol-
 icies since mid-1955.   It described developments in this
 period as "U-shaped"--an "upsurge" of socialist transfor-
 mation leading to an "upsurge" of production in 1956, fol-
 lowed by an "ebb" of "conservatism" in 1957, succeeded by
 an even greater "upsurge" beginning in autumn 1957.   Liu
 assailed "some comrades" for opposition to the first "up-
 surge," denied that the "ebb tide" had been necessary, and
 asserted that there had been opposition to the second "up-
 surge" and to its transformation into the "great leap for-
 ward."  Liu's frame of reference is employed in this paper.
 The paper examines chronologically the public state-
 ments of party leaders over the time span reviewed in Liu's
 May 1958 report.   Particular attention has been paid to
 those nine members of the CCP politburo who have appeared
 to play the most important roles in the formulation of
 economic policies:   Mao Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-
 lai, Chen Yun, Teng Hsiao-ping, Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien,
 Tan Chen-lin, and Po I-po.

 1. THE FIRST UPSURGE
 Mao Incites "Upsurge" in Transformation, July - December 1955
 The Chinese Communists have long advocated the trans-
 formation of the nation's scattered, individual peasant eco-
 nomy into a socialist economy, and the similar transformation
 of the nation's private industry and commerce, but there have
 been important disagreements within the leadership on tue
 question of the tempo or pace of this transformation.
 The first stage of agricultural socialization was "land
 reform," in which land was taken, usually with violence,  from
 the rich and successful and given to the poor.   Liu Shao-chi's
 stated target for the completion of lend reform (i.e., redis-
 tribution) by the end of 1952 was reached ahead of schedule.
 Even before it was finished, the next stage--the establishment
 of "mutual-aid teams" and simple cooperatives--had already be-
 come, according to Po I-po, like a "rising tide."  In Decem-
 ber 1951 the party central committee drew up draft regulations
 on mutual aid and cooperation.
 In December 1953, with about one half of China's peasant
 families in mutual-aid teams, the central committee adopted a
 decision calling for a gradual, four-step progression from
 land reform, through mutual aid and cooperation, to the full
 collective.  Most Chinese Communist leaders who spoke on the
 subject approved this step-by-step gradualism; there was quoted
 some 1943 advice from Mao Tse-tung on "gradual collectiviza-
 tion."
 At the September 1954 session of the National People's
 Congress, Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai and Teng Tzu-hui specific-
 ally approved the gradual approach.  The strongest affirma-
 tion of the "soft" line came, curiously, from Liu Shao-chi.
 In September 1954, Liu went out of his way to attack "enemies"
 who had declared that the regime was "too compromising," es-
 pecially those persons who had complained that the agricultural
 program was going "too slowly."  Liu, in language that might
 later have given him some pain, described the ideas of the mil-
 itants in rural policy as "sheer nonsense."
 In March 1955 the State Council complained that coopera-
 tives were being organized too :rapidly and assertel that
 the pace should be "somewhat decreased."  The First Five-Year

 Plan (1953-1957), read to the National People's Congress
 in July 1955, called for a "step-by-step transformation."
 Planning chief Li Fu-chun argued that this could not be
 completed within the course of the plan, but that this
 "highly arduous and heavy task" would take three such plans.
 The gradual line was firmly established in mid-1955  both in
 formal documents and in practice.                      '
 In July 1955, only a few days after Li Fu-chun had spo-
 ken, Mao Tse-tung personally reversed the soft line on agri-
 cultural socialization.  He did so is a 1peech to a confer-
 ence of regional party secretaries.  Mao's speech was not
 released until October 1955, at which time the assurance of
 an excellent harvest gave him the confidence to make his
 position public.
 In his July report--as later presented--Mao jeered at
 "some comrades" as being like "women with bound feet...who
 cry 'You people are walking too fast, much too fast."'
 (The "some comrades" were, on the record, the entire cen-
 tral committee and everyone who had publicly spoken on the
 tempo of socialization.)  Mao observed that -some comrades
 have been frightened out of their. wits" by the number of
 collectives, and that such caution was a "rightist" error.
 He criticized those who would be disposed to criticize the
 "impetuous development" of cooperatives.  Mao conceded that
 the USSR had at one time made a mistake of "impetuousness
 and adventurism," but he argued:  "We must not tolerate tim-
 idity...under the cover of this'Soviet experience."  He in-
 sisted that an aggressive program of socialization would
 not lead to serious trouble with the peasantry.
 Following Mao's unpublished remarks, there was a pause
 of two months for party "discussion."  The central committee
 met in October and "unanimously" adopted a resolution which
 did not set specific goals for agricultural socialization
 but encouraged the cadres to rush forward.   The resolution
 rewrote history to place the central committee in the posi-
 tion of having long ago approved the acceleration of agri-
 cultural socialization, and it observed solemnly that the
 politburo's criticism of "rightist opportunism., is perfectly
 correct."  Chen Po-ta, a longtime spokesman for Mao, gave an
 "explanation" of the resolution which made it clear that the
 new campaign did not proceed from the central committee or
 even from the politburo but from Mao himself.

 Mao's intervention and the central committee declara-
 tion which grew out of it led to a spectacular upsurge of
 the transformation movement. The great majority of the
 nation's peasant households were swept into cooperatives.
 The results--60 percent of peasant households in coopera-
 tives by the end of 1955--far exceeded Mao's stated expec-
 tations.
 In December 1955 Mao raised his estimate, observing
 that semisocialist cooperation could be basically completed
 the following year.  Commenting shortly thereafter on the
 new 12-year plan for agricultural development, Mao said the
 country was in the "high tide of the great socialist revo-
 lution."  He declared that "this socialist revolution in
 the main could be completed within about three years"--that
 is, by 1959.  By February he was to decide that the semi-
 socialist transformation would,  for the most part, be com-
 pleted the coming autumn; the higher forms, in the main,  in
 1958.
 The socialization of private industry and commerce ran
 parallel with the socialization of agriculture.  As in agri-
 culture, the planned pace of transformation was gradual,
 but in practice it worked out far more rapidly.
 Peiping's stated intention was to move from private
 ownership gradually through intermediary stages until com-
 plete socialism was achieved.   The violent campaign against
 capitalist "vices" in 1951 and 1952, paralleling the land
 reform program in agriculture, severely impaired the ability
 and willingness of the private businessman to resist state
 encroachment.  Retributive taxation was frequently employed.
 As state-led trade grew in strength it was able to control
 both sources of supply and markets; private businessmen
 could do business only on the state's terms.  Commercial
 concerns degenerated into mere agencies of state commercial
 departments, and all essential agricultural products were
 subjected to "unified" (i.e., state-controlled) purchase and
 sale.  The next step was direct state interference in the
 internal affairs of private firms, achieved by investing
 money in them.  The resultant joint state-private enterprises,
 ssmisocialist in nature, have been aptly described by Peiping
 us "governed, used, and managed" by the state.
 Premier Chou En-lai told the National People's Congress
 in September 1954 that from 1949 through 1952, China had

 SECRET
 "emphatically" pushed the establishment of the socialist
 and various types of cooperative economy, making "initial
 adjustments between state and private industry and com-
 merce."  Chou said that from 1953 on, the country embarked
 on a program of gradual socialist transformation of capital-
 ist industry and commerce.  By 1954, Chou reported, state-
 operated commerce was in a position to handle all or the ma-
 jor part of the principal commodities needed for the national
 welfare and had "in its charge" all foreign goods.
 In July 1955, just prior to Mao's initiation of the
 "high tide" in socialization, Li Fu-shun quoted the consti-
 tution to the effect that the "policy of the state toward
 capitalist industry and commerce is to use, restrict, and
 transform them."  Li noted that China had a "large and com-
 plicated" private industry and commerce and that the gov-
 ernment therefore had to adopt "proper steps and flexible
 forms" in its transformation.   The advance would be "sys-
 tematic and steady," Li said; he predicted that by 1957
 "about half of the originally existing private business en-
 terprises would be incorporated into various forms of the
 state-capitalist economy, gradually replacing capitalist
 ownership with ownership by the whole people."
 The suddenness of the "upsurge" in socialist transfor-
 mation of private industry and commerce in late 1955 and
 early 1956 was even more marked than in the case of agricul-
 ture.   In December 1955, Mao  commented on  the  success
 scored in socialization of agriculture.  He said this success
 "notifies us that efforts should be made to advance the time
 of completion of the socialist transformation of China's cap-
 italist industry and commerce."  C'ien Yun later described the
 process which followed Mao's remarks.  He said that the original
 government plan was for the transformation to be carried out
 "by stages and by different trades."  The January "upsurge" led
 the government to change this plan and approve the transforma-
 tion by "whole trades" and "all at once."
 Mao's action in stimulating the socialist "upsurge" in
 the months after October 1955 had a profound effect on the
 subsequent Chinese economic programs.  As Mao observed in
 commenting on the "upsurge" in December 1955, it "notifies
 us that measures regarding the scale and tempo of China's in-
 dustrialization and the scale and tempo of science, culture,
 education, and public health should no longer be taken in the
 manner originally planned.   These should be appropriately

 expanded and accelerated."  Premier Chou En-lai agreed, re-
 marking that the scope and speed of socialist transformation
 had created conditions for a "great upsurge in the national
 economy."  This judgment, as might be expected, found general
 agreement among the other leaders.
 By the time the National People's Congress met in June
 1956, the socialist 'transformation movement in agriculture was
 to show spectacular progress. Whereas in June 1955 some 85
 percent of the peasants had been farming individually, by
 June 1956 some 91.7 percent of the peasant households were
 in all types of cooperatives, 62.6 percent in collectives. In
 industry and commerce, there was a substantial shift of indus-
 trial output from the private sector of the economy to the
 joint state-private sector.
 Mao Incites "Upsurge" in Production, Early 1956
 In December 1955, five months after his personal inter-
 vention, Mao Tse-tung was able to declare that the question
 of the socialist transformation of agriculture was already
 "settled," as was the question of transforming industry and
 commerce.  The problem was now one of "rightist conservatism"
 in production and construction.   In the same fashion as the
 cadres had underestimated peasant "enthusiasm" for socializa-
 tion, there was--and remained--an "underestimation of the sit-
 uation" with regard to agricultural production, industrial
 production of all kinds, capital construction, and other
 spheres of activity.   "The problem today," said Mao, is that
 "rightist conservatism is still doing mischief in many fields,"
 preventing the regime from attaining goals that it could
 otherwise reach.   In other words, "many people consider im-
 possible things which could be done if they exerted themselves."
 Liu said in May 1958 that Mao had "subsequently" summed
 up his position of December 1955 in the slogan of building
 socialism by achieving "greater, faster, better, and more eco-
 nomical results" simultaneously.  This slogan was publicly
 employed first by others, but there is no doubt that it accu-
 rately represents Mao's thinking at the time.
 The People's Daily New Year's Day editorial of 1956
 clearly re  ec a    aM s thinking.   It argued that agricul-
 tural socialization was stimulating industrial development,

 and that the First Five-Year Plan (1953-57) might be ful-
 filled as much as a year ahead of schedule.   Industrial
 production was to be based on the principles of quality,
 quantity, speed, soundness, and economy; conservatism was
 to be combated.
 In mid-January 1956, other CCP leaders, led by Chou En-
 lai, began to associate themselves with Mao's opposition to
 "rightist conservatism."  Chou specified that the central
 committee had decided to make "opposition to rightist con-
 servatism" the theme of the party's forthcoming Eighth Con-
 gress.   In the same period there were predictions of great
 increases in industrial and agricultural production and the
 scale of capital construction.
 In late January, Mao called a meeting of the Supreme
 State Conference to "discuss" the central committee's new
 draft plan for agricultural development in the next 12 years.
 The plan did not give specific goals, but, according to the
 party spokesman on the draft, the program--if realized--
 would mean an increase in agricultural production of 150 per-
 cent.   This objective appeared to be unrealistic, even if
 the regime were to increase considerably its investment in
 agriculture.  The program was explained to the conference not
 by Teng Tzu-hui, director of the party's rural work depart-
 ment, but by Liao Lu-yen, deputy director of that department
 and concurrently minister of agriculture.  This was the sec-
 ond time in four months that Teng Tzu-hui had been passed
 over in the field in which he had been the party's principal
 spokesman.
 Further confirmation of Mao's high confidence in his
 assessment came on 2 February in a speech by Chen Po-ta on
 agricultural socialization.  Chen, who had been the spokes-
 man for Mao's line the previous October, said that grain out-
 put could be doubled in 12 years and that China could feed
 .twice its present population.  Chen denounced "some peoplF"
 who believe in the "preposterous theory" of Malthus.   F;; de-
 clared roundly that "there is no sign of overpopulation in
 China," and that the "food question" would be solved through
 socialization of the economy--the orthodox Marxist position.
 Early in February the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions called for an increase in industrial productivity, and
 soon thereafter it announced a nationwide "emulation" campaign.

 Beginning in February with a conference on capital construc-
 tion and continuing for some months, the regime convened
 national conferences of workers in all important sectors of
 the economy in order to "discuss" means of overfulfilling the
 First Five-Year Plan and of increasing production.   In March
 the Communist party central committee issued a notice to all
 party units to strengthen their leadership of the advanced
 production movement and to oppose rightist conservatism.
 It was at this point in the first great "upsurge" that
 Mao, according to Liu Shao-chi in May 1958, made his still-
 unpublished speech on the "Ten Relationships" to an enlarged
 meeting of the Communist party politburo.  According to Liu,
 Mao in this April 1956 speech "called the party's attention
 to the correct handling of the relationships (1) between
 heavy and light industries and between industry and agricul-
 ture;  (2) between coastal industries and inland industries;
 (3) between economic construction and national defense;  (4)
 between the state, the collective, and the individual;  (5)
 between the central and local authorities;  (6) between Ban
 people and the national minorities;  (7) between party and
 nonparty people;  (8) between revolution and counterrevolu-
 tion;  (9) between right and wrong inside and outside the party;
 and (10) international relations."
 In this report, according to Liu, Mao "outlined a series
 of important policies on amplification of the general line
 of building socialism."  Under the first and fifth relation-
 ship, Mao set forth the "principle of developing industry
 and agriculture simultaneously while giving priority to heavy
 industry, and the principle of combining centralization of
 power with decentralization.""  The principles for the second
 and third relationships called for "making fuller use of the
 industrial bases in the coastal areas and amassing ample funds
 for economic construction."  Liu was less specific on the con-
 tents of Mao's remarks on the fourth relationship, although he
 noted that Mao had discussed the "correct-handling" of the re-
 lationship  "betweeh the rates of consumption and accumula-
 tion" in addition to those between the state, collective and
 individual.   The remaining five "relationships" concerned the
 correct handling of "contradictions among the people--a ques-
 tion which was later elaborated"  (in April 1957).
 In his retrospective view, Liu ascribed the "leap forward"
 of 1956 to these "guiding lines and policies" laid down by Mao
 in April.   It seems likely, however, that the "leap" was

 initiated by Mao's earlier speeches and articles, and that
 the April 1956 speech was concerned primarily with outlining
 problems which remained to be solved.
 Possibly the first reflection of Mao's April speech oc-
 curred in Li Fu-chun's address of 30 April 1956 to a con-
 gress of "outstanding workers of all trades."  In addition
 to the usual statements of high satisfaction with progress
 made in 1956, Li noted a need to pay attention to light in-
 dustry as well as heavy industry, and to exis~:.ing as well as
 new industrial bases (Mao's relationships, numbers 1 and 2).
 In much the same fashion as the "guarantee of increased
 incomes" to the peasants served as the "carrot" of agricul-
 tural collectivization, so a,,- proposal in April 1956  or
 wage increases served as the incentive to the workers for
 increased productivity.  At a national conference of outstand-
 ing workers and professional people on 3 May, Po I-po emplia-
 sized the importance of raising wages, improving worker wel-
 fare, and combining "patriotic labor enthusiasm" of the work-
 ers with their "practical material interests."  Po criticized
 "certain leaders of enterprises who concentrate on accumu-
 lation" at the expense of the workers.   Po said:   "If one
 is truly concerned about the collective interests of the na-
 tion, about accumulation of more capital for socialist con-
 struction and about initiating more socialist undertakings,
 then he must be more concerned about the personal interests
 of the broad masses of workers" (Relatin:;ship number 4).   Li
 Hsien-nien addressed the same audience on 5 May, and implied
 that the improprieties "of leading organs" on the wage ques-
 tion had been remedied by the joint directive of the central
 committee and State Council raising wages  (number 4 again).
 On 7 May, Teng Tzu-bui after giving Mao his due for stim-
 ulating agricultural socialization, reiterated the hereto-
 fore muted 2oncern for the masses in agriculture by stress-
 ing that co-op ir.embers must be guaranteed steady annual in-
 creases in income alter socialization.
 Increasing Emphasis on Problems, Summer 1956
 The National People's Congress meeting in June 1956
 heard further follow-ups to Mao's April statements.  The gen-
 eral atmosphere of the congress remained one of confidence,
 support of the drive against "rightist conservatism," and

 pride in the progress of the 1956 plan.   All of those who
 spoke at the congress reflected this spirit.   However, sub-
 stantially increased emphasis was placed on emerging prob-
 lems and on the necessity of providing more "carrots" to
 the populace to "consolidate" the gains made during the
 "productive upsurge."
 Minister of Agriculture Liao Lu-yen, the chief exponent
 of the "hard-line" 12-year program for agriculture, spoke to
 the congress on 15 June.   Liao said the central point for
 "consolidation and development" of the cooperatives was
 "correct handling of the relationship" between the individual
 and collective--overcoming the tendency to lay one-sided
 stress on collective and national interests while overlook-
 ing the interests of the individual (Mao's relationship num-
 ber 4).   In one of the kind of question-and-answer sessions
 Stalin was prone to conduct with himself on public plat-
 forms, Liao asked:   "Why is there collective and not state
 ownership of the land in the higher stage collectives?  Be-
 cause collective land ownership by cooperatives is easily
 acceptable to the masses of peasants...while introduction of
 state ownership of the land might give rise to misunderstand-
 ing on the part of the peasants."  Liao added:   "The chief
 concern of the co-op members is to increase their own in-
 come after joining co-ops, and it is on this account that they
 give their support to socialism." Liao's highly practical
 view of the situation appeared somewhat less optimistic
 about the "enthusiasm" of the peasants than did the views of
 six months earlier.
 On 19 June, the head of the central committee's Rural
 Work Department, Teng Tzu-hui, who had not been very enthusi-
 astic about the acceleration of agricultural socialization
 in 1955, took an even more conservative view of the situation.
 He mentioned the benefits of transformation favorably, but
 the emphasis in his speech was on the errors and shortcomings
 of agricultural work.  As the result of the speed-up of
 "socialization," too much time was being spent on food-crop
 cultivation, thus cutting down on time spent on industrial
 crops and sideline production.   Furthermore, valuations on
 land and property collectivized were too low and members of
 co-ops had been "forced" to invest in them; and draft ani-
 mals were dying because co-ops could not or did not give them
 the care provided by their former owners.   For Teng, "con-
 solidation" and "insurance" of increased income to the members

 of cooperatives was the important question.  Teng recom-
 mended that if a co-op after harvest found that it could
 not distribute increased income to its members, that co-op
 should cut back the amount of funds set aside for public
 funds (accumulation) and distribute that as income.
 Li Hsien-nien on 15 June reported on the final 1955
 and draft 1956 budgets.   Li, in a possible reflection of Mao's
 first "relationship," noted that there had been a "remark-
 able" increase in heavy industry expenditures and assured
 his hearers that increases for light industry, agriculture,
 and forestry would also be implemented.   Li expressed con-
 cern that the burden of the peasant had become too heavy be-
 cause of too low a procurement price for agricultural prod-
 ucts.   Like Liao and Teng, Li stressed the importance of
 "correct" distribution of income in the cooperatives while
 "insuring that not too much" of the cooperative income be
 plowed back into productive assets and expenditures.  He
 criticized "some departments" for trying to reach the 12-year
 goals for agriculture in "two or three years" and attacked
 the predominance of quantity and speed of production in in-
 dustry at the expense of quality.
 The concern with "burdens" on the populace and the rela-
 tionship between heavy and light industries conveyed by Li
 Hsien-nien was increased by Li Fu-chun's address three days
 later.   Li Fu-chun also expressed satisfaction with the "up-
 surge" in production taking place, noting that the First
 Five-Year Plan for agriculture could probably be fulfilled
 a year early, provided no natural calamities occurred.  Like
 the other speakers, Li also noted some "deviations" that had
 accompanied the "upsurge"--particularly that of "emphasizing
 production at the expense of worker and employee welfare."
 He then proceeded to state his "own views" on three ques-
 tions of national economy.
 Li's three topics coincided with three of the relation-
 ships Mao is purported to have dealt with in his April speech.
 Li dealt first with the interrelationship of heavy industry,
 light industry, and agriculture (Mao's relationship number 1)
 and said that the state had decided to increase investme;:
 in light industry while "simultaneously increasing" heavy
 construction.  The ratio of heavy to light industry would
 then be changed from approximately 8:1 to 7:1.  This was

 primarily the result of the increase of raw materials for
 light industry available from the excellent harvest of 1955.
 Li's second question concerned the relationship be-
 tween coastal and inland areas (Mao's relationship number 2).
 Li said that henceforth more attention would be given to
 utilizing to the full the existing industrial facilities,
 which for the most part were located on the coast.  The third
 of Li's "own views" was on the question of accumulation
 versus consumption (according to Liu, this was part of Mao's
 fourth relationship).  Li cited figures which justified the
 proposed wage increase then under consideration and stated
 that this measure was correct, since increases in labor pro-
 ductivity during the past year had been higher than in-
 creases in wages.
 Po I-po, head of the new National Economic Commission
 (created in the government reorganization of May 1956), on
 21 June gave the most specific statement of the problems
 which beset the regime.  As had all the others, Po lauded
 the achievements of the "upsurge" and thea proceeded to deal
 with certain shortcomings:   "...in the course of socialist
 upsurge, the application of rationalization proposals, the
 creation of new records, the adoption of advanced experi-
 ences, and the elevation of technical and economic produc-
 tion levels on the part of many enterprises have resulted
 in the unbalancing of production."
 Po cited statistics from the State Statistical Bureau
 showing that one fifth of the construction projects sched-
 uled to start in April were held up by shortages of supplies
 and equipment.  He noted that the situation had become "even
 more acute" in May.  This, said Po, had led to the State
 Council's action in cutting down the original 1956 plan for
 capital construction investment from 14.7 to 14 billion.yuan.
 Po then gave a scale of conditions under which work on capital
 construction could be modified, halted, or alternative con-
 struction substituted with minimal loss to the state.  He
 also endorsed the idea of additional emphasis on development
 of coastal industry "if such projects may result in good re-
 turns with comparatively small investments."  Looking for-
 ward to the 1957 plan, Po called for better planning formu-
 lation according to the "law of the planned and proportionate
 development of our national economy."  Reflecting a position
 taken by People's Daily  a day  'earlier,  Po observed. "In

 combating  right  conservative  tendencies,.,. .we
 have made the mistake of being impetuous and hasty in
 our work."
 Chen Yun's chief contribution to the National People's
 Congress (NPC) sessions were contained in two speeches of
 18 and 21 June;~both were devoted to the problems of pri-
 vate industry and commerce "too rapidly" transformed. By
 June it was apparent that production of consumer goods had
 been inhibited by the over-all changes, that the quality
 of goods offered on the? market had dropped, that time-
 tested distribution patterns had been upset, and that sales
 and state revenue had declined.   Chen's presentation was
 almost entirely a justification of a decision taken by the
 State Council in February to suspend the progress of trans-
 formation for six months.  Chen was careful to point out
 that after the six-month suspension expired, the former
 breakneck speed of transformation would not be renewed:
 "There are still many problems which we must solve, one by
 one and unhurriedly."
 Among these problems, Chen cited that of "artificial
 severance of the former relationships of supply and market-
 ing between industry and commerce." He attacked the "blind
 tendency" toward overamalgamation of the smaller private
 enterprises, and he condemned the "truculent, negative" at-
 titude of "some people" who did not wish to accept the
 "legacy" of managerial and technical skills among the pri-
 vate industrialists and businessmen.
 Chen addressed the NPC again on 21 June to "answer the
 criticisms" brought forward by the deputies.  He redescribed
 in much the same terms as in his first speech the problem,
 which had arisen as the result of transformation, and he pro-
 posed an eight-point remedial system which amounted to a
 "free market within the framework of the planned economy."
 Although Chen invariably referred to the "successful" trans-
 formation of industry and commerce, he was concerned pri-
 marily with the problems of "too rapid" transformation.
 Chou En-lai summed up the work done at the sessions of
 the National People's Congress in a speech on 30 June.  His
 view of the progress of 1956 was much less concerned with
 the problems arising from the "upsurge,, than were the views
 of those leaders whose primary responsibilities were in

 economic work.  Nevertheless, one problem was that "the
 division of powers between the central and local authorities
 as provided for in the Constitution now required more con-
 crote definition."  This was necessary, said Chou, because
 productive relations had undergone fundamental changes and
 "productive forces" now would grow still faster as the re-
 sult of the "victory of socialist transformation."
 Chou pointed out that if all power remained in the
 hands of the central authorities, local authorities would be
 "held back;" it would greatly improve efficiency and "un-
 leash creative energies if the local authorities were given
 defined powers of handling things."  Chou stated that a
 division ,of power between central and local authorities
 would be "embodied in the various state systems" in the fu-
 ture.   Particular division of power would be defined "in
 matters of planning, finance, enterprises, departments, cap-
 ital construction, political and legal affairs.,,  Chou re-
 vealed that a preliminary draft system for such division of
 powers between central and local authorities had already
 been drawn up and referred to all provinces and cities for
 discussion, and he estimated that an "over-all plan" could
 be made in 1956 and put into provisional practice in 1957.
 Chou's statement on decentralization, number five of
 Mao's "Ten Relationships," was curious in that it implied
 that the regime had already initiated the process of making
 a basic change in the administrative structure of China,
 and, unlike Li Fu-chun's "own views" on three of the other
 relationships mentioned by Mao, was not qualified as an in-
 dividual opinion.
 As of late June 1956 the Peiping regime was still defin-
 ing its internal enemy as "rightist conservatism" and remained
 committed to an extremely ambitious rate of basic construc-
 tion and industrial production.  Between June and the open-
 ing of the Eighth Party Congress in September 1956, it became
 obvious that the regime's plans had undergone two separate
 and severe blows.
 The initial effects of the first blow had been reflected
 in Po I-po's statement to the NPC that the State Council had
 already cut back the capital construction plan from 14.7 to
 14 billion yuan and that projects started in April and May
 had been held up by shortages of equipment and construction

 supplies.  However, while Po--and to a lesser extent Li
 Hsien-nien, Chen Yun, and Li Fu-chun--had pointed to pos-
 sible strains in the economy as the result of the "upsurge,"
 no leading figure had suggested that their ambitious plan-
 ning might have exceeded the regime's capacity to produce.
 The second, and more severe, blow came from weather
 conditions.  Heavy rains in late June and July caused water-
 logging and flooding in North and South China.   In early
 August, Typhoon Wanda swung into China over Chekiang and up
 into Hopei, leaving very severe damage in a densely populated
 and rich agricultural area.  The northeast was also suffer-
 ing seriously from flooding, while parts of southern China
 were suffering from drought.  It was apparent that the re-
 gime could no longer expect to reach its goals in agricul-
 tural production, and the already existent problems created
 in the wake of the "upsurge" in production became more in-
 tense.
 Chinese Communist party leaders had little to say in
 this period, which was one of preparation for the party's
 Eighth Congress in September.   In early August, however,
 when natural disasters were already forcing a reassessment
 of the regime's plans, People's Daily admitted that some of
 the problems cited in speeches to the NPC in June had be-
 come serious.
 An editorial on 9 August stated that there was an acute
 scarcity of steel products, timber, and cement, and that
 even raw steel was in short supply.  The editorial noted that
 these difficulties could not be attributed to any failure to
 increase production, as production of these materials had in
 fact increased.  The reason for the shortages was simply that
 the regime had planned (and undertaken) to build more than
 even the increased supply of materials could permit.   The
 editorial drew the conclusion--the first time that this for-
 mulation was observed since Mao's attack on conservatism in
 1955--that in addition to avoiding the error of "rightist
 conservatism" one must also avoid "leftist adventurism."
 People's Daily went on to state that allocations of ma-
 terials for 1956had been almost completed, and that, while
 supplies were far below the demand of some departments, only
 minor adjustments could be made.  The editorial finally ad-
 mitted that some plans in basic construction were too large,
 could not be completed, and must be cut.  Po I-po had noted

 in June that the State Council had already made a cut of
 about 5 percent; the editorial indicated that the total cut
 would now be about 10 percent.
 It should be noted at this point that the "upsurge" of
 '956 was a real one, despite the emphasis on problems in the
 latter stages of the "upsurge."  The regime obtained increases
 of 32 percent in industrial production, 62 percent in capital
 construction, and, despite nsaural calamities, 4.9 percent in
 agricultural output.

 II. THE EBB TIDE
 Eighth Congress Modifies Position,  September 1956
 During the Chinese Communist party's Eighth Congress,
 held in September 1956, the party leaders officially aban-
 doned the emphasis of early 1956 on the need to combat
 "rightist conservatism."  Reflecting instead the position
 taken by People's Daily in August when troubles were mount-
 ing, the party IF  ep `e"mbar affirmed its determination to
 steer a course between "rightist conservatism and leftist
 adventurism."  While the program set forth by the congress
 remained a very ambitious one, the party's position was more
 nearly moderate than at any time since July 1955, immediately
 prior to Mao's intervention to speed the tempo of socializa-
 tion of agriculture.
 Mao played a small role at the Eighth Congress, making
 only a brief opening speech.  The speech did not touch on
 economic questions, and Mao may have wished to avoid as-
 sociating himself personally with a line which was in effect
 a retreat from one of his own.  However, Mao almost certain-
 ly had approved, prior to the congress, the general position
 which was to be taken in the various reports and in the reso-
 lution of the Congress.
 Liu Shao-chi--whose four-hour political report dominated
 the proceedings of the congress--reaffirmed the party's "gen-
 eral line" of gradual accomplishment of socialist industrial-
 ization and transformation.   Noting the central committee's
 1953 estimate that these tasks would be "fundamentally" ful-
 filled in a period of three five-year plans, Liu said that
 industrialization might take a little longer than that, but.
 that transformation would be achieved much sooner, owing in
 large part to the 1955 decision by the "central committee and
 Chairman Mao."  Asserting that the regime would surpass the
 goals of the First Five-Year Plan for industrial and agricul-
 tural production, Liu avoided mentioning that his (and all
 other) references were to the original goals stated in 1955
 and not to the subsequent upward revisions.
 Liu went on to state the goals of the Second Five-Year
 Plan in general terms and to associate himself with certain
 specific goals presented later in the congress for the proposed

 Second Five-Year Plan.  He called for greater attention to
 light industry, although--in contrast to other speakers--
 he said it would be "wrong" to alter the current rate of
 development of heavy industry to that end. He said that grain
 and cotton would remain most important in agriculture, but
 that the regime must ensure increases in yields of other
 industrial crops and the output of animal husbandry and sub-
 sidiary occupations.   In commerce, as Chen Yun had empha-
 sized in June, there must be an improvement in the present
 system of market control, and a limited flee mar,cet.
 Liu also reviewed the history of the development of
 state power since 1949 and noted that in order to "consoli-
 date the unity" of the country, the party had opposed "de-
 partmentalism" and concentrated authority in the hands of
 the central government.  Endorsing Chou En-lai's June state-
 ment on the proposal for division of power between central
 and local authorities, Liu noted that the central authori-
 ties now had too much power, thus "slighting the affairs of
 local areas."  Insisting that it was "absolutely necessary"
 for the central authority to devolve some of its administra-
 tive powers and functions to local authorities;, Liu specifi-
 cally cited "agriculture, small and medium industries, local
 transport, local commerce, primary and secondary education,
 local health services, local finance" as areas where the
 central authority should put forward only general principles
 and policies, while the "actual work" should be referred to
 the local authorities to make arrangements for carrying it out.
 Liu described the Second Five Year Plan, which his report
 outlined, as standing between "conservatism" and "adventurism."
 Chou En-lai gave the congress a more detailed presenta-
 tion of the comparatively realistic Second Five-Year Plan.
 By 1962, according to the plan, industrial production would
 increase 100 percent over the original goal for 1957 (or
 about 75 percent over the expected 1957 achievement), while
 agricultural output would rise 35 percent.  Moreover, capital
 goods by 1962 would account for 50 percent of the total value
 of industrial production as compared with 38 or 40 percent in
 1957.  The plan set forth a number of specific targets for
 1962 production, such as 10,500,000 tons to  12,000,000 tons
 of steel,   190,000,000 tons  to  210,000,000 tons of coal,
 and 250,000,000 tons  of grain.   Other  proposals related
 to transport, commerce,   technical  and  scientific  de-
 velopment,   relations  between central and local governments,

 wages and income, and so on.  The plan concluded with a
 warning, directed to those involved in planning, against
 both "adventurism" and "conservatism."
 Chou's remarks on the plan were chiefly of interest
 for their light on mistakes and difficulties which had led
 to a modification of the grandiose schemes suggested in early
 1956.  Firstly, Chou said, it was necessary to set a "reason-
 able rate" for economic growth, with "comparatively realistic"
 long-range targets which could be adjusted annually.  He not-
 ed that the scale of capital construction in 1955 had been
 too small, but in 1956 it had been set too high.  This develop-
 ment, together with the "overzealousness" of some branches
 of the economy, had strained national finances and led to
 serious shortages of construction materials.   Secondly, Chou
 said, it was necessary to improve coordination of key proj-
 ects with "over-all arrangements".  Mistakes in this sector
 of planning had led to a waste of manpower and resources in
 past years, and the same tendency of "doing everything at
 once, taking no account of actual conditions, and recklessly
 running ahead" had appeared again in*early 1956 after publi-
 cation of the draft program for agricultural development.
 Thirdly, Chou said, it was necessary to maintain stockpiles
 of essential materials in order to meet possible crop fail-
 ures and contingencies in industrial production.  The regime
 had foolishly exported certain surpluses in 1955, and thus
 in 1956 it was caught short.   It was necessary, Chou said,
 to improve financial planning, with the aim of ensuring eco-
 nomic development by setting targets (for accumulation) high
 enough to carry out the plan but not so high as to "put a
 great strain on our efforts".  Chou added that many of the
 "shortcomings and mistakes" in economic work derived from
 "subjectivism and bureaucracy" at higher levels.
 Chou cautioned against overemphasis on industrial develop-
 ment in the interior and "slighting" of development of the
 coastal areas.  He also indicated that a fairly basic disa-
 greement existed as to whether the construction of "large
 enterprises is comparatively more reasonable than that of
 medium and small enterprises and therefore should be carried
 out on a broader scale."  This, Chou said, had not yet been
 resolved by the government--apparently because the industrial
 ministries differed as to how beneficial the effects of such
 a policy would be to their respective operations.  As had Liu,

 Chou endorsed the need for a "limited free market" and, echo-
 ing Chen Yun's June statement, warned against overamalgaava-
 tion of small factories and handicraft cooperatives into
 larger units lest small factory production be "crippled."
 Chou reiterated that the "victory" of socialist transforma-
 tion made possible a further division of central and local
 authority. thus "facilitating the full development of local
 positiveness.'!
 Chou .also used his discussion of the Second Five-Year
 Plan as the framework for outlining the "main purpose of the
 socialist industrialization" of China.   Chou's description
 was substantially more concrete than the rather short-range
 and specific tasks contained in the First Five-Year Plan.
 The "main purpose," he said,  "is to build up, in the main,
 a comprehensive industrial system within a period of ap-
 proximately three five-year plans."  Chou stated that such
 a system would be able to satisfy the principal producer--
 and consumer--goods needs of the nation in the future.   He
 attacked two "wrong" views on the virtues of establishing a
 "comprehensive industrial system."  One was the "parasitic
 view" that complete reliance could be placed on "interna-
 tional assistance" a view which was wrong because "a populous
 country like ours, which has great resources and great de-
 mands...must quickly alter" its tjackwardness.
 The other "wrong" view according to Chou--the "isola-
 tionist view" of socialist construction--was fallacious be-
 cause, "needless to say, the. establishment of a comprehen-
 sive industrial system in our country requires assistance
 from the Soviet Union and the people's democracies for a long
 time to come."  Chou's comments suggested that the worse of
 the two evils was felt to lie with the advocates of the "para-
 sitic" view and that the party had decided to establish an
 economy  as self-sufficient as possible.
 Lesser reports on economic policies were given by Chen
 Yun, Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien, Po I-po, Teng Tzu-hui and Chia
 To-fu.
 Chen Yun's report, consistent with his speeches earlier
 in 1956, dealt with'the problems of transformation of industry
 and commerce.   Chen's primary concern, endorsed in Liu Shao-
 chi's report and formalized in the Sedond Five-Year Plan pro-
 posals, was with the decision to permit a limited "free market."
 The effect of the decision was to introduce competition between
 various forms of state and cooperative organizations  n a part
 of the economy and to encourage individual private enterprise

 in some rural handicrafts.   Capital goods, most staple con-
 sumer goods, and the principal agricultural products re,-,.ained
 outside the new relaxation.
 This system, in Chen's view, would remedy both the drop
 in quality of production (brought about by the "upsurge" of
 early 1956)  and the drop in sideline production (brought
 about by agricultural socialization).  Chen's presentation
 was replete with suggestions which softened the impact of
 socialization": factories were to be encouraged to buy,sell,
 and order products, a "very large" sector of the individual
 handicraft producers "must" engage in individual production,
 past merging of numerous small factories into single large
 units was not conducive  to production, and in those cases
 where "cooperativized" peasants occupied large tracts of
 land they should be a21owpd to work them for sideline pro-
 duction.
 Chen insisted that there was no longer a need for regu-
 lations on "restricting speculation"  and that consumer goods
 factories should be sensitive to "supply and demand."  It is
 not known whether Chen was already under criticism or merely
 anticipating criticism for these comparatively heretical if
 practical suggestions.  He did point out, perhaps defensively,
 that the state remained "the point of reference" for these
 suggestions, and that in regard to the "free market," while
 "planned production is the mainstay of the state, free pro-
 duction is auxiliary to the state and definitely not a capi-
 talist market."
 Li Fu-chun's report dealt with national planning and led
 off with the sad story of the perils of central planning in
 China and a reminder to his audience that plans were essenti-
 ally "estimates."  Li strongly endorsed the decision of May
 1956 to institute a second planning organ, the National Eco-
 nomic Commission, to handle annual plans.  This, said Li,,
 would strengthen the work of achieving "synthesized economic
 balances" and aid in the regime's attempts to "grasp the laws
 of systematic proportionate development."
 Li noted that among the faults of the planners were in-
 sufficient study, inaccuracy, lack of adaptability, and poor
 judgment.   He described the coordination work of his own State
 Planning Commission as "grossly inadequate" and cited two
 instances where the planners had been at fault.   Firstly, when

 agricultural production fell behind consumption and sta',;e
 construction demands (in the summer of 1956), "we were En-
 able to put forward an effective solution," and secondly,
 the planners had "paid inadequate attention to full rational
 utilization of coastal industries."  Li concluded by philo-
 sophically pointing out that "in economic life, balance is
 relative., .our duty is to take positive progressive measures
 to continually detect and eliminate weak links, rectify new
 imbalances, and insure a step-by-step advance of the economy
 as a whole."
 Li Hsien-nien devoted most of his report to commodity
 price policies and criticized shortcomings in the commercial
 and "price" departments, noting that the lack of "price com-
 petition" had made state commercial price policy "somewhat
 unrealistic."  He advocated raising procurement prices for
 agricultural and subsidiary production, estimating that such
 raises would result in a revenue reduction for the state cof
 from 1.1 to 2 billion yuan and would enlarge the rural market
 for consumer goods.   Li also'. concurred with Li Fu-chun's
 "own view" of June 1956 that light industrial investment should
 be Increased and heavy industrial investment "revised somewhat."
 Li concluded that the state had the choice of stimulating
 production and reducing the prices of industrial goods or of
 raising wages and procurement prices, and that the latter method
 was better "since it is able to stimulate the production en-
 thusiasm of the workers directly."
 The burden of Po I-po's report concerned the ratio between
 accumulation and consumption in national income.  Po noted that
 the accumulation rate had risen to almost 23 percent in 1956,
 that it should henceforth be "more or less" 20 percent, and
 that the regime should be "especially cautious" about increas-
 ing it.   In addition, Po gave two other percentage ratios that
 he thought were appropriate.  The level of the annual budget,
 he said, should be pegged at 30 percent of national income,
 since everytime "in the past" it had been higher for purposes
 of more construction, there had been underfulfillment and "dam-
 ages to industrialization and coordination of economic life."
 In a possible reference to his own removal as minister of fi-
 nance in 1:53, Po noted that in the past when "any of us with
 the best intentions" had wanted to raise the percentage, the
 "central committee would promptly correct him."

 Capital construction investment, Po went on, should be
 "about 40 percent" of the annual budget.   He was perhaps giving
 the guidelines  for the future operations of his National Eco-
 nomic Commission in noting that when the "speed-up of capital
 construction cannot keep up with the rate of accumulation," the
 error is "rightist conservatism," and that when "the speed of
 capital construction exceeds the rate of accumulation," the
 error is of "leftist adventurism."  Po seemed to regard the
 latter error as the lesser of two evils, paraphrasing Mao's
 1942 dictum that the "conservative idea of solving financial
 difficulties by cutting construction and expenditures instead
 of developing production and looking for new financial resources
 cannot solve any problem."  Po concluded by considering it "pos-
 sible" to raise these three percentages.
 'reng Tzu-hui spoke to the Eighth Congress on the situation
 in agriculture and manifested a consistent concern with "consoli-
 dating" and "maintaining" the gains made in agriculture.   More
 so than in his June speech, Teng stressed that the pursuit of
 "adventurist" policies in agriculture would jeopardize the
 "worker-peasant alliance," which in turn would threaten all "so-
 cialist" progress.
 Noting that agricultural cooperativization had been "bas-
 ically realized," Teng heavily underlined the point that the
 completion of the Chinese revolution did not mean that the peas-
 antry--the "main force of the revolution"--now would take a sub-
 ordinate or secondary position in the "present task of'socialist
 construction."  Teng drew a parallel between the Communist par-
 ty's step-by-step policies toward mobilization of the peasantry
 for land reform after 1949 and its "gradual" policy in the drive
 for agricultural locialization  from 1952 to 1956. Emphasizing
 the central importance of the agricultural sector for all other
 sectors of the Chinese economy in citing "the historical experi-
 ences" gained by the Communist party in land reform and agricul-
 tural socialization,   Teng then attacked an "erroneous attitude"
 adopted by "some comrades" who thought "that since the peasants
 have become collective peasants under socialism, the question of
 the worker-peasant alliance has lost its importance and urgency
 and the peasants' welfare is no longer their concern...The adop-
 tion of such an attitude is extremely dangerous."

 Teng, who had failed to support the speed-up in agricul-
 tural socialization in 1955, admitted being guilty of following
 a "rightist conservative tendency" in that he and other "rural
 worker comrades" had underestimated "the enthusiasm" of poor
 and lower middle peasants and had not "dared" to rely upon them
 in the march toward socialization.  However, Teng put up an
 oblique defense of his attitude in noting the key uses of the
 middle peasants.
 Teng argued that if "we had only depended on the poor
 peasants and had not united with the middle peasants and if
 we had not strictly protected the interests of the middle peas-
 ants" during land reform and "if we had not the patience to
 wait for the middle peasants to gain their consciousness" dur-
 ing socialization, "our party and the poor peasants would have
 placed themselves in an isolated position and the consolidation
 of the worker-peasant alliance would not have been formed."  Be
 stated that during "the new historical period" the "step-by-step
 modernization of agriculture along with industrial development
 is the new economic basis for the worker-peasant alliance," and
 in a logical extension of his argument he insisted that party
 concern for the interests of the peasantry in the new period
 would determine the success of "socialist construction."
 Teng then pointed out that the underdeveloped state of in-
 dustry ruled out the use of large quantities of farm machinery
 and chemical fertilizer at the present time and, as had Liu
 Shao-chi and Chou En-lai in their speeches, stated that present
 agricultural policy was to increase the "frequency of cultiva-
 tion on the existing farmland and raise the output per unit of
 acreage."  Teng endorsed the need, noted by Li Hsien-nien, for
 readjustments in procurement prices in order to stimulate pro-
 duction.
 Teng foresaw that state investment in agriculture would
 remain limited and said that "a certain amount" of accumulation
 of funds must be obtained by the peasantry themselves.  However,
 he said, "if the fund accumulated is too great, is too hastily
 accumulated, and makes the peasants' living standard fall be-
 hind production, fail to increase year by year or even drop,
 there will be dissatisfaction among the peasantry... and the
 successful advance of the state's socialist construction will
 be hindered."  "Correct handling" of this was, for Teng, part
 of maintaining a "correct proportion between state accumulation
 of funds and personal consumption."  Therefore the current

 policy of the cooperatives in distributing income--"holding less
 and giving more"--was correct.
 Teng concluded by exhorting the party to realize that
 although the peasants "have Joined the cooperatives, it is
 impoitisible to change completely their original viewpoints
 and traditional habits in a short period of time."  Teng was
 of the opinion that ideological education was necessary not
 only for the peasants, but also for the cadres and party mem-
 bers.
 Ten g's entire speech reflected the increased concern
 being voiced by the party at that time for protecting the
 benefits of the peasantry and against cadre "commandism" and
 "leftist adventurist" tendencies.  While Teng did admit his
 error of "conservatism" on rapid socialization, it is apparent,
 on the basis of his defense and the almost complete absence of
 warning against "rightist conservatism" in his speech, that he
 remained convinced of the virtues of his comparatively cautious
 approach to agricultural policy.
 One of the less publicized speeches given in the process
 of the Eighth Congress was made by the director of the Fourth
 Staff Office (light industry) of the State Council, Chia To-
 fu.                        Chia noted with approval that a higher proportion of in-
 vestment would go into light industry during the Second Five-
 Year Plan.  This was in line with the positions of Li Fu-chun
 and Li Hsien-nien, but it ran counter to Liu Shao-chi's opion-
 ion expressed earlier to the same audience.  More importantly,
 Chia provided some connecting links between the proposed de-
 centralization policy and the policy of full utilization of
 coastal industry suggested in June 1956.
 Chia began by noting that almost all light industry was
 located on the coast and that "it was wrong to think that over-
 concentration of industry in coastal areas could be remedied
 by such steps as 'restricting production' or 'moving factories
 inland,"' which had apparently occurred in the past.   Full ex-
 ploitation of coastal industries, he said, would provide the
 funds for inland construction.   Further, as far as the build-
 ing of new light industry was concerned, "apart from a few big
 factories, considerable attention should be paid to building
 medium and small factories."  Chia also recommended that "where-
 ever possible, local authorities should be encouraged to accept
 responsibility for building light industrial plants...In addition,
 SECRET

 existing (light industrial) enterprises that are more suited
 to local than to central management should gradually be trans-
 ferred to the local authorities."
 While restricted to the context of light industry, Chia's
 comments are precursors of the policies that are basic to the
 present "leap forward" movement.  The implication of Chia's
 remarks was not only that there was unexploited production
 capacity in existing coastal industry but there was also a
 productive potential on local levels which could be utilized
 if small- and medium-size factories were built and if the
 primary responsibility for managing some central government
 enterprises were transferred to local authority.  Chia's pro-
 jection of unused production potentials on the local levels of
 the Chinese economy gave a good indication of the depth of re-
 appraisal of economic policy that had been going on since April.
 Self-satisfaction and confidence in the Communist party's
 achievements, generally marked the Eighth Congress.   It is not
 necessary to deny the real achievements of the regime in order
 to conclude, nevertheless, that the "consolidation" or "breath-
 ing spell," the beginning of which was probably marked by
 Mao's "Ten Relationships" speech in April, continued through
 the Eighth Congress.
 Although production targets (in ranges) for 1962 in the
 proposed Second Five-year Plan were announced at the Congress,
 absolute figures on such key subjects as capital construction
 investment and projections of revenue and expenditures were
 not given.   It follows from this that these either had not yet
 been decided upon or were so tentative as not to warrant an-
 nouncement.  The plan outlined at the congress labored under
 a disadvantage which did not affect the First Five-Year Plan,
 in that it had not been under -way for two and one-half years
 prior to public announcement.   In addition, the over-all op-
 timism of sessions of the congress tended to  obscure the fact
 that the regime itself referred to the Second Five-Year Plan
 not as "the plan" but ao the "plan proposals."
 Thus it was possible for Liu Shao-chi to state that any
 change in the  rate  of  development  of  heavy  industry
 would be "wrong", while Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien and Chia To-
 fu could   imply  the  opposite.   Similarly,Po I-po could express
 doubt that the solution of financial difficulties lay in cutting
 back on expenditures, while the Minister of Finance Li Hsien-
 nien viewed a revenue reduction of 1 to 2 billion yuan with
 little alarm.

 Chou En-lai stated that a fairly basic disagreement exist-
 ed between the various ministries as to the virtues of large-
 scale plant construction and small-scale plant construction, a
 disagreement which the government had not resolved.  Chia To-fu,
 in his government position as supervisor of light industrial
 organs, argued that, so far as light industrial production was
 concerned, small plant construction had some merit.  This sug-
 gested that the other parties to the policy dispute mentioned
 by Chou were the administrators of heavy industrial enterprises.
 Teng Tzu-hui's rather strong statement of the virtues of
 a cautious approach to agricultural policy seemed to indicate
 that a fairly wide disagreement on agricultural policies exist-
 ed within the leadership.   By marshalling the facts of the de-
 pendence of future industrial progress on agricultural produc-
 tion and by raising the spectre of damages to the "worker-peas-
 ant alliance" and resultant decreases in that production if "ad-
 venturist" policies were followed, Teng was in effect denying
 the future usefulness of such policies as the speed-up of agri-
 cultural socialization in 1955.   In spite of his position as the
 senior agricultural r;pecialist in the party, it appe..rs doubtful
 he would (or could) have taken that line if the period of reap-
 praisal inaugurated by Mao in April were not continuing.
 The Eighth Congress brought into the party politburo three
 of the four ranking economic specialists below Chen Yun, a po-
 litburo member for many years.   Li Fu-chun and Li Hsien-nien,
 probably the two' most important of the 'four as long-rani,3 planner
 and finance chief, were named full members.   Po I-po, the annual
 planner, was named an alternate (nonvoting) member.  Teng Tzu-
 hui was not named to either the politburo or the new secretariat.
 If, as seems probable, the reason for his lack of promotion lay
 in his leadership of the "rightist conservative" group opposed
 to Mao in late 1955, his speech at the Eighth Congress was not
 calculated to improve his position.
 "Readjustment" and "Retrenchment," late 1956
 Six weeks after the close of the Eighth Congress, the Com-
 munist party central committee Held a plenary session from 10 to
 15 November.  The complete proceedings of the meeting were never
 released, but the communique  of the session noted that three
 main questions had been taken up.   Liu Shao-chi reported on the
 "present situation," apparently restricting his remarks to the
 international scene; Chou En-lai gave a report on the forthcoming

 1957 plan and the "ceiling figures" in the budget; and Chen
 Yun reported on the question of grain and secondary food (pork
 and edible oils).
 The communiqud of the meeting, rather than sustaining the
 buoyant spirit of the Eighth Co;igress, indicated that the prob-
 lems mentioned as sidelights at the congress were now the re-
 gime's principal concern.   In line with Chou En-lei's call for
 a "suitable retrenchment" in 1957, it noted that because "cer-
 tain items in this year's plan have been carried out improper-
 ly and certain expenses have been rather excessive, it is nec-
 essary in drawing up next year's plan (1957), to carry out ap-
 propriate retrenchment in certain respects while continuing to
 advance at the same time."  It pointed out that socialist trans-
 formation had been "virtually completed," and that there had
 been "enormous achievements" in capital construction as well
 as increases in heavy and light industrial and agricultural pro-
 duction.   The communiqud admitted that the use of a "small
 portion" of capital construction had been "improper."
 The communique further emphasized that "improvement of the
 people's life must be gradual" and that it now was necessary
 "to explain frankly, repeatedly, and clearly to the people that
 some demands are excessive and that some things cannot be done
 for the time being,"  The communiqud then announced the launch-
 ing of a movement for "increasing production and practicing
 economy" throughout the country and warned that production "must
 be increased under conditions where the supply of raw materials
 can be insured and where there are needs in society."  It was
 also necessary, the communiqud added, "to guarantee the quality
 of the work and to pay attention to safety."
 Mao Tse-tung had given a summarizing report on the last
 day of the session and "expressed full endorsement of the pol-
 icies and measures adopted at the plenary session."  It is
 probable that most of the "readjustments" made in the 1956 plan
 and budget, as well as the policies pursued under the 1957 budg-
 et and plan, were decided upon at this plenary session.   it
 seems clear that the "readjustment" of 1956 and the "retrench-
 ment" of 1957 in economic planning, decided upon by the plenum
 and endorsed by Mao, contradict Liu Shao-chi's later (May 1958)
 contention that "the central committee of the party and Comrade
 Mao have always taken a clear-cut stand, insisting that the way
 of working faster and better be adopted...."

 The party leaders apparently felt that a number of the
 problems which had arisen in 1956 could be solved by adjust-
 ments in the planning organs.               The State Council announced on
 16 November the appointment of nine new deputy directors and
 ten members to Po I-po's annual planning organ, the National
 Economic Commission.  Among those appointed were Chia To-fu,
 the partisan of light industry, a deputy minister (under Chia)
 of light industry, two deputy directors of the Third Staff
 Office concerned with heavy industry, and four former members
 of the log-range plannin      an  the State Planning Commis
 sion.
 Senior Deputy Premier Chen Yun, all of whose public state-
 ments since early 1956 had concerned problems in commercial
 work and in the operations of small- and medium-size industrial
 enterprises, was appointed minister of commerce on 16 November.
 Former Minister of Commerce Tseng Shan apparently lost little
 or no prestige within the party, however, for he was later
 identified as head of the transport work department of the
 central committee.  Chen Yun's appointment suggested that he
 was taking direct responsibility for the implementation of his
 remedy for shortcomings in commercial work, the "free market."
 The regime's press indicated in November and December that
 the "free market," rather than solving problems in commercial
 work, was creating additional ones.   Among other things, local
 procurement organs were raising the prices paid for agricultural
 products on their own initiative in order to fulfill their pro-
 curement plans, and some of the agricultural producer coopera-
 tives were engaging in commerical speculation, causing price
 rises in the "black market" 80 to 100 percent above state market
 price quotations.   Several press items also commented on the
 fact that the "free market" was not under full control of the
 cadres and that grain, cotton, and oilseeds (products reserved
 for exclusive state purchase) were being traded on the open
 market.
 A large portion of this "competition" in supply and market-
 ing of agricultural products was the result of diminished sup-
 plies caused by the shortfalls of the 1956 crop.  Perhaps a more
 important political result of the poor crop of 1956 was that the
 regime was forced to admit publicly that the promise of increased
 income to the peasants as the result of agricultural socialization

 could not be made good.  Thus a directive of 25 November, Is-
 sued by the central committee and State Council, stated that
 the "important task at present" was to help the cadres and
 cooperative members "sum up the reasons for failure to increase
 the incomes of 90 percent of their members."  This was an ad-
 mission that Mao, as well as those leaders who were convinced
 of the merits of Mao's speed-up of agricultural socialization
 in 1955, had in this respect been falsely confident.
 The problem of transformation of the small- and medium-
 size industrial enterprises and the handicraft industry--a
 problem which first arose in early 1956--continued to plague
 the regime.  An editorial on 7 December in Ta Kung Pao com-
 plained that "nearly 9,000 handicraft co-op mem eFierrsTiave ap-
 plied for withdrawal from cooperatives and some 7,000 members
 have already withdrawn their mewbership."  The editorial ad-
 vised that "gentle persuasion" be utilized to get them to re-
 turn and laid the blame for the withdrawals on cadre "command-
 ism."  On 19 December People's Daily criticized the attitude
 of "some leading personnel an  comrades" that the development
 of individual handicraft activities "spread capitalist Influ-
 ence."  "The existence of individual handicraft producers,"
 said the paper, "is beneficial to the state because the supply
 of products increases."  On 29 December Ta Kung Pao went a
 step further and called for "mass support' ?'or "newly estab-
 lished capitalist factories," attributing the phenomenon to
 the "inability of production to keep pace with demand," which
 in turn was the result of "indiscriminate merger of factories
 in the course of socialist transformation."
 It was apparent that this temporary "softness" on the part
 of the regime toward these two "capitalistic" anachronisms, the
 individual handicraftsmen and the small, quite primitive and
 "unregistered" (i.e.,private) factories, was dictated by the
 inability of the economy to provide enough consumer goods to
 meet the demand.  One of the reasons for the lack of production
 had been repeatedly pointed out by Chen Yun through 1956: that
 transformation of the smaller factories and former individual
 handicraftsmen had dislocated their production.   The second
 reason, a shortage of agricultural raw material inputs result-
 ing from the poor harvest of 1956, had intensified the situa-
 tion.

 The policies which encouraged the growth of these two
 "capitalist" remnants could reasonably be ascribed to Chen Yun.
 On 15 December, addressing the All-China Federation of Com-
 merce and Industry, Chen noted with satisfaction that the
 operations of the "free market" were, as he had earlier pre-
 dicted, increasing the supplies of consumer goods.  He also
 commented that the "secret workshops," or unregistered fac-
 tories, which had sprung up were "few" in number and served
 a "good" purpose.   He noted, however, that the question of
 whether or not they would continue was "under study" by the
 government.  Less than a year later, Teng Hsiao-ping was to
 be highly critical of these two phenomena.
 As 1957 opened, the regime on the one hand was pushing
 a drive for austerity and economy, and on the other it was
 allowing the publication of a number of articles by economists
 and pseudonymous writers which advocated a very moderate ap-
 proach to the problem of economic development.
 These articles, which appeared in such authoritative or-
 gans as Hsueh Hsi (Study), Tung-chi Kung-tso (Statistical Work)
 and Peoples  'aMy, gave lip service To-Th?mportance of heavy
 industry but argued for increased priorities to light industrial
 development, creation of stockpiles for future needs, higher and
 better incentives for the rural labor force,   and larger scope
 for the operations of the "free market."  They also emphasized
 the importance of the agricultural sector in total Chine3e eco-
 nomic development.  The writers also indicated that dependence
 upon foreign sources of machinery and equipment was undesirable
 and endorsed Po I-po's statement of September that "accumula-
 tion" should be set at a rate of 20 to 25 percent of national
 income.
 A major theme of the articles was that of "balanced, pro-
 portionate development" of the economy.  In indirect references
 the authors attacked the "blind following" of Soviet experiences
 in economic development.  The articles also criticized unknown
 elements in the regime who "hold the theory of the primacy of
 heavy industry as precious" pointing out that such ideas pre-
 sented the danger of "gaining heavy industry and losing the
 people."

 The themes and points presented in these articles could
 be traced back to the speeches made at the Eighth Congress,
 with the exception of the criticism of the proponents of the
 priority development of heavy industry.  Other than that, the
 articles could not be considered heretical or unorthodox.
 The curious aspect was the fact that articles on such topic is
 as the primacy of heavy industry, which exhibited an exclusive
 concern with the problems of industrialization and were here -
 tofore predominant, did not appear.  The regime was apparent-
 ly encouraging a shift from an over-riding concern with heavy
 industrial development to a concern for balanced economic de-
 velopment, which was realistically based on the centrality of
 the Chinese agricultural problem.
 No major figures in the regime were directly associated
 with these articles.   It is probable that articles of this
 type served the purposes of the regime in justifying, to lower
 level,cadres and party workers, the necessity for the re-
 trenchment and "balancing" of the development of the economy
 that took place in the first nine  months of 1957.

 Party Leaders Justify Retrenchment, Winter 1957
 According to Liu Shao-chi's May 1958 review, the "indi-
 vidual defects in our work during the leap forward in 1956"
 wero solved "after a few months' effort" by the campaign for
 increasing production and practicing economy.   "However,"
 said Liu, "some comrades at the time magnified these defects
 and underestimated the great achievements attained; hence they
 regarded the leap forward of 1956 as a reckless advance."
 Liu's 1958 view of the "defects" of 1956 was more narrow than
 that of economic leaders, as it was restricted to "strains"
 in market supply due to taking on "excessive numbers" of new
 workers and "excessive increases" in certain categories of
 wages.  The error of regarding 1956 as a "reckless advance"
 was corrected by the party in September 1957, Liu added.
 As of January 1957, the only responsible leader who had
 publicly referred to 1956 as a year of "reckless advance" was
 Chou En-lai, who criticized the tendency of "recklessly run-
 ning ahead" in his Eighth Congress speech,  A number of other
 responsible leaders repeatedly pointed out in the first six
 months of 1957, however, that the experience gained in 1956
 should not be forgotten.  As the articles of early 1957 seemed
 to be attempting to persuade lower level cadres and party work-
 ers of the necessity for a retrenchment in the economy, the
 travels and increased public appearances of several of the eco-
 nomic leaders during this period also served to underline the
 necessity for retrenchment.
 Twice in February 1957, Po I-pop addressing conferences
 of model peasants, dealt with the problems of 1956 and the cur-
 rent task of "consolidating" the agricultural cooperatives. Po
 repeated that capital investment in 1956 was a "little too high,"
 that "the rise in living standards did not correspond to the
 growth of consumer goods," and that, while a large number of
 construction projects had been finished  in 1956, the lack of
 auxiliary construction for the projects meant that they had not
 been able to go into production.  Moreover, the party and state
 "should correctly deal in the future with the  relation  be-
 tween national construction and the improvement of the people's
 livelihood."
 Po's main point concerned the "consolidation" of the co-
 operatives in management and operations.                                 He emphasized that
 improvements in the conditions of life for cooperative members

 SECRET
 depended on their own efforts, and that cooperatives could not
 continue to "rely on incurring debts" for consolidation.   Po
 estimated that it would take three to five years for such con-
 solidation and that this v,.,uld be directly dependent on the
 cooperatives' ability to accumulate material and financial re-
 sources themselves.   "Consolidation" appeared to mean making
 the cooperatives independent of state aid primarily in the form
 of agricultural loans.
 Fo admitted in both speeches that peasant dissatisfaction,
 which Teng Tzu-hui had indicated in September and which was im-'
 plied in the regime's November admission of failure to increase
 peasant incomes, now existed over the differences between worker
 incomes and the lower incomes of the peasants.   Po provided a
 rationalization of the differences.  This was repeated several
 times later in the year, which appeared to indicate that peasant
 dissatisfaction was fairly extensive.  Other leaders, including
 Mao, were to show an increased sensitivity to the agricultural
 situation as 1957 progressed.
 On 27 February 1957, Mao Tse-tung gave his speech on "Cor-
 rect Handling of Contradictions Among the People."  The text
 was not published until 18 June, and then only after the author
 had made "certain additions."  The bulk of Mao's speech was an
 exposition of the doctrinal ground rules for the game of "bloom
 and contend."  As he put it, he did not "propose to talk at
 length on economic questions today."
 Nevertheless, Mao felt that the "basic contradictions in
 socialist society are still those between the relations of pro-
 duction and the productive forces, and between the superstructure
 and the economic base."  The comparatively moderate program fol-
 lowed by the regime over the previous three months could be fully
 just4fied by Mao's statement that the "socialist system has just
 been set up.   It is not yet fully consolidated...socialist re-
 lations of production have been established; they are suited to
 the development of the productive forces, but they are still
 far from perfect."  Mao expressed satisfaction with the role
 that the "superstructure--our state iastitutions of people's demo-
 cratic dictatorship..." had played in socialist transformation.
 "But," he added, "survivals of bourgeois ideology, bureaucratic
 ways of doing things in our state organs, and flaws in certain
 links of our state institutions stand in contradiction to the
 economic base of socialism."

 Contradictions such as these must continue to be resolved
 in the light of specific conditions, said Mao, citing the need
 for constant "readjustments" in state planning.  Mao indirectly
 criticized the planning organs, saying: "Every year our country
 draws up an economic plan in an effort to establish a proper
 ratio between accumulation and consumption and achieve a balance
 between production and the needs of society...When arrangements
 do not correspond to objective reality, contradictions arise
 and the balance is upset; this is what we call making a mistake."
 "Time," Mao continued, "is needed for our socialist system
 to grow and consolidate itself, for the masses to get accustomed
 to the new system, and for government workers to study and ac-
 quire experience."  Mao's general comments gave sanction to crn?-
 tinuing the "consolidation," or breathing spell, which apparently
 had begun the previous April.
 Mao touched on three more specific points in language which
 suggested tiiat the search for answers to questions of future
 economic policy was still going on.  With regard to agriculture:
 "We must still find the correct way to handle the three-way re-
 lationship between the tax revenue of the state, the accumula-
 tion of funds in cooperatives, and the personal income of peas-
 ants...Accumulation is essential for both state and cooperative,
 but in neither case should this be overdone."  Mao was aware of
 the chief manifestation of peasant dissatisfaction that Po I-po
 had noted earlier; he rather sharply pointed out, "It is not
 right to make a superficial comparison between the average an-
 nual income of a peasant and that of a worker and draw conclu-
 sions that one is too high and the other too low."
 Mao also indicated he felt that some elements within the
 regime were not considering all possible alternatives in their
 search for future progress.  "Some," said Mao, "act as if they
 think that the fewer the people and the smaller the world the
 better.   Those who have this 'exclusive club' mentality resist
 the idea of bringing all factors into play, or rallying everyone
 who can be rallied, and of doing everything possible to turn
 negative factors into positive ones."  "Bringing all factors
 into play" was later to become the predominant theme of the
 "leap forward" movement.  Mao seemed to be criticizing the
 party and government apparatus for resistance to several pos-
 sibly unusual suggestions for future courses of action.

 One of these suggestions was apparently the proposed in-
 crease in construction of small and medium plants, for Mao
 went out of his context of generalities to endorse it.   He
 noted the lack of experience of the regime iu construction
 and, while citing the great successes of the past, emphasized
 the "waste" engendered at the same time.   He said,  "lie must
 gradually build a number of large-e-cale modern enterprises
 as the mainstay of our industries...but the majority of our
 enterprises should not be built in this way; we should set
 up a far greater number of small and medium enterprises and
 make full use of the industries inherited from the old so-
 ciety so as to effect the greatest economy and do more things
 with less ioney."
 In his May 1958 review of economic planning, Liu Shao-
 chi played down Mao's "contradictions" speech, implying that
 it was irrelevant to his exposition.  Nevertheless,' Mao's
 speech, viewed in the context of retrenchment and the empirical
 approach then being adopted with regard to economic policies,
 seemed to give strong support to the policy of continuing
 the moderate course.
 On 9 March 1957 Chen Yun gave an omnibus report on the
 state of the economy.   Chen noted that the current movement
 to "increase production and practice economy" was dictated
 by the fact that there had emerged shortages of meat, food,
 and general consumer goods, as well as short supplies of
 pig iron, steel, and lumber.  Chen attributed the consumer-
 goods shortage to the wage increases of 1956 and stated that
 the excess of expenditures over revenues in 1956 was the re-
 sult of the increase of agricultural loans in that year.
 The reason for the "present austerity," Chen said, was
 primarily the calamities in agriculture in 1956, which were
 effecting state income in 1957.   He explained that capital
 construction investment in 1957 would be less than in 1956
 and implied that the completion of a number of construction
 projects then under way would have to be postponed.  Chen fur-
 ther noted that all civil construction work in 1957 except work-
 er dormitories and schools would have to be dropped.   Food
 supplies were apparently tight, for Chen said that pork and
 edible oil exports in 1957 would be cut by two thirds and that
 the government was prepared to increase supplies of relief
 grain to calamity-stricken areas.   He noted that "a large
 population and a high rate of consumption are the difficulties
 in our economic life."

 Chen's speech contained the first public indications of
 the measures the central committee had had in mind when it an-
 nounced the previous November that retrenchment was necessary.
 While Chen's speech was not a formal presentation of the 1957
 plan, it was an unusual public announcement for him in that i`
 dealt with many facets of the economy and was not marked by  25X1
 his past concern for specific se  ents of the economy.]
 Teng Tzu-hui, also speaking in March, emphasized the
 need for "democratic management" in the cooperatives.  Partic-
 ipation in the operation and management of the cooperatives
 by their members had to be stimulated lest "cadres take charge
 of the management by themselves, depart from the masses,  and
 even fall into corruption."  Teng repeated his point of Sept-
 ember--that of the necessity to "unite with" the middle pea-
 sants.   The burden of Tong's statement was that necessary
 increases in agricultural production could come only from
 following policies of "democratic management," i.e., com-
 paratively moderate  policies.
 Moderate Planning, Spring 1957
 The first outlines of the official 1957 plan were pre-
 sented by Chia To-fu to a national conference in late March.
 Retrenchment and a moderate approach to economic policy marked
 Chia's summary of the situation for 1957.   Chia included an
 assertion which could almost be described as a "welfare" ap-
 proach to central planning.  Chia said that,                                  in regard to the
 supply of capital goods the minim"~m amount for the production
 of consumer goods must be set aside "first."  These state-
 ments implied that the priorities governing annual planning
 had been shifted from capital goods and industrial production
 to consumer goods and agricultural production.
 Chia's outline of the details of the proposed 1957 plan 25X1
 bore out the sense of a change in priorities in planning.   He
 pointed to the need fox a "lower level" of investment in 1957
 in order to "lock the First (Five-Year) Plan with the Second."

 He noted that the large long-range projects in capital con-
 struction would be discontinued, and all "postponable" projects
 suspended, and he stated that policy in 1957 dictated that part
 of capi ?,al construction investment be appropriated for enter-
 prises which are "small in scale, require small investment, and
 can be in production in a short time."
 Chia drew attention to three factors in planning which
 needed more emphasis.   First, more "coordination" on the part
 of the central government was needed in planning in order to
 "eliminate imbalances which developed over the past four years."
 Second, there should be better coordination of central and local
 government economic development.   "Judging from the conditions
 of fulfilling the First Five-Year Plan,"  'Chia said, "investment
 in local enterprises had exceeded the target considerably," and,
 although a general slash in investment was planned for 1937, in-
 vestment in local enterprises should be cut as "little as pos-
 sible."                    The third factor mentioned by Chia was the necessity
 for "unified balancing and planning."
 Chia did not, however, emphasize the point made by Mao in
 February: that "balances" in all things were relative and trans-
 itory,  The current problems of the regime obviously required
 res. ration of "balance," however temporarly,   and the emphasis
 of the planners in public statements continued to revolve around
 the question of balancing until late 1957.
 By April the framework of the 1957 annual plan was apparent.
 Po I-po presented it, and Chou En-lai made "supplementary re-
 marks" on it (both unpublished) to the standing committee of the
 National Peoples' Congress.  Between April and June the economic
 leaders--chiefly Po I-pu and Li Fu-chun--traveled and spoke quite
 extensively, explaining the reasons for the moderate goals of the
 1957 plan to various audiences.
 Po I-po, appearing at forums in Sian and Chengtu in early
 May, spoke on the subject of "rectification" in construction.
 Thrift and economy, the current slogans of the regime, and reme-
 dies for the "many mistakes and much waste" generated in con-
 struction during the First Five-Year Plan, could be achieved by
 full participation of construction cadres in the rectification
 campaign.  By way of illustrating past mistakes, Po noted that
 in the past "we alienated ourselves from reality and the masses,
 and we unilaterally pursued excessively large-scale, modern, and
 high-standard construction."

 On 17 May 1957 Po and Li Fu-chun were in Chungking giving
 their views on current problems in construction, par~icularly
 with regard to planning.  Both Po and Li subscribed to the
 proposition that "the current headlong modernization program is
 worth reconsidering...first we must consider whether or not this
 equipment can be produced in this country and then consider
 modernization.  What we are doing now is just the opposite."
 The two planners reiterated the need for construction of medium-
 and small-scale plants and integration of larger plants with
 smaller ones.   In addition to these points of emphasis, the
 planners elaborated a number of measures calculated to lower
 the costs of construction.
 On 23 May 1957 Li Fu-chun addressed the New Democratic Youth
 League, emphasizing that the First Five-Year Plan would "defi-
 nitely" ::~ overfulfilled.   Li stated that the keynote of the
 Second Five-Year Plan would be one of "making every penny count."
 Li noted that "many present problems" in economic development
 arose from "poor planning...the avidity to do everything on a
 big scale..."  Li said that this would be rectified in the
 Second Five-Year Plan by placing the emphasis on the construc-
 tion of small- and medium-scale enterprises.   Li also warned
 that "mechanization should not be developed to the detriment
 of handicrafts and small production" because of "tradition"
 and potential unemployment.
 Li Fu-chun repeated much of his earlier discussion to a
 national conference of designers on 31 May. This particular
 address, however, contained substantially more emphasis on the
 problem of the relationship between central and local authori-
 ties.   It was apparent: that the question t?ad been settled as
 to what portion of the functions of the central government
 "should," in theory, devolve to local levels. Li implied that
 some inhibitions to actual devolution of authority remained;
 he very strongly insisted that "from now on,...a large portion
 of light industry and some heavy industry" should be handed
 over to local management.  This was necessary, said Li, because,
 fudging from developments in recent years, overmanagement and
 excessive control have been exercised in planning, industry,
 business, and finances."
 On 6 June 1957 Peiping issued a statement summarizing
 speeches by Po I-po and Li Fu-chun to the National conference
 on design.   This statement contained some general "principles
 of guidance" for the Second Five-Year Plan.   It wa.  apparent

 from the reading of the principles that the "lessons" of 1956
 had been given heavy weight in their formulation.  The two
 planners endorsed (a) increased "proportional" investment in
 agriculture and light industry while "maintaining the priority"
 of heavy industrial investment;  (b) maintenance of a "proper
 ratio" between accumulation and consumption;  (c) greater power
 to local levels while preserving over-all central control;
 (d) cuts in construction costs;  (h) continuing construction of
 "some" large plants but more emphasis upon small and medium
 plant construction; (f) priority to development of the ex-
 tractive industries within heavy industrial investment; and
 (g) fulfillment of 70 to 80 percent of national equipment re-
 quirements from domestic sources.  The joint statement most
 strongly emphasized the first point, on the grounds that more
 must be invested in agriculture to meet the "growing demands
 of 600 million people."
 Several developments suggested that there had been a de-
 cided shift in the planners' approach to economic problems.
 These included Chia To-fu's March statement on the 1957 plan,
 which noted the priority of guaranteeing the requisite equip-
 ment for consumer goods production; Mao's reported statement of
 April; Li Fu-chun's and Po I-po's emphasis upon agriculture to
 meet the "demands of 600 million people;" and a statement as-
 cribed to Chen Yun in June that "in drawing up the (Second
 Five-Year) Plan, we must first make arrangements for the peo-
 ples' livelihood, second those for production and last those
 for c&pital construction."  The predominant and somewhat narrow
 conception of the party leadership--the conception which pre-
 vailed up to 1957--that the rapid development of heavy industry
 was the key to economic progress,  appears to have broadened into
 a conclusion that sound economic development is determined by a
 large number of interdependent factors.  The problem of how
 these various factors should be handled was formulated in the
 recurrent calls for "balanced, proportionate development" and
 became the main topic of public discussions of economic policies.
 The regime's chief spokesman for agriculture during this
 period was the moderate Teng Tzu-hui.   Between April and June
 1957 Teng was primarily concerned with giving impetus to the
 campaign for construction of small-scale irrigation and water-
 conservancy projects.  On 20 April 1957, speaking to a meeting
 of the secretaries of the party's Peiping committee, Teng re-
 vealed that the regime was experimenting with a new form of in-
 centive system for increasing agricultural production.  The

 SECRET
 system, which Teng called a "two-target" system, appeared to
 be composed of two production goals: the first, a "guaranteed"
 or minimum goal, set 15 to 20 percent lower than actual annual
 output; and the second, a planned production goal, set higher
 than actual annual production. As Teng explained it, 70 or 80
 percent of the overt ulfillment of the "guaranteed" target would
 be awarded to the production brigades as a bonus.   "Seeing that
 it is easy to overfulfill the production target and get a bonus,"
 said Teng, "....the production enthusiasm of the cooperative
 members will naturally increase."
 The fact that the "ease" of overfulfillment came from
 setting the guaranteed target below actual annual output, as
 well as the fact that the greater proportion of overfulfillment
 was distributed to the members and not plowed back into produc-
 tion (accumulation), must have made, as Teng put it, "some com-
 rades view this with anxiety."  Teng's advocacy of this ex-
 perimental measure was consistent with the moderation expressed
 in his earlier views on agricultural policy.   But more important-
 ly, this "two-target" system for agriculture outlined by Teng
 appears to have been the precursor of the revised system of
 planning targets for industrial production--the system which be-
 came part of the "leap forward" movement of 1958.
 In the process of speaking about the necessity for con-
 struction of small- and medium-scale irrigation and water-con-
 servancy works, as well as of advocating incentive measures and
 methods of democratic management for the cooperatives, Teng made
 it clear that his moderate position was based in part on the
 judgment  that "capitalism" had been expunged from the country-
 side.  The question as to whether the peasant would take the
 road to capitalism or to socialism "had been solved," said Teng,
 as the result of the agricultural cooperativization movement.
 This sanguine view was to be specifically denied by the spokes-
 men of the "great upsurge" barely five months later.
 People's Daily ran a feature article on 5 May 1957 entitled,
 "A Preliminary-study  of the Income and Living Standard of the
 Peasants of China" by Tan Chen-lin, an early associate of Mao
 who had been brought into the party secretariat under Teng Hsiao-
 ping in 1955.  Although Tan was careful to point out that his
 study was "preliminary" and based on "incomplete materials,"
 his article was a detailed defense of the correctness of party
 policy in agriculture, with the conclusion that: "Viewed against
 all the facts, it is clear that the workers' life is no better than
 that of the peasants."

 In this article, Tan's first appearance in the field of
 agricultural policy, Tan seemed to be, unlike Tong Tzu-hui, a
 "high-pressure" man with little sensitivity to rural problems.
 The article was tailored to agree with Mao's dictum, included
 in his "contradictions" speech, that "it is not right to make
 a superficial comparison" on the questions of the worker-pea-
 sant income differential and to "draw conclusions that one is
 too high and the other too low."  Beyond providing "facts" for
 those who wished to argue the question, Tan's article indicated
 (where Mao and Po I-po had not) that the argument was also an
 interparty discussion.  As Tan introduced the problem, "since
 the autumn harvest of 1956 a number of comrades have taken
 the view that the peasants still have a good deal of trouble
 making a living...some of our comrades even subscribe to the
 opinion that 'upon entering the cities, the Communist party
 forgot the villages."'  Tan's conclusion was that while the
 party's policies were not "faultless," the "facts" seemed
 to "Justify party policies."
 Continued Moderation, Summer 1957
 During this period of a "moderate" attitude in Chinese
 Communist discussions of the economy, the "rightist" attacks
 on the party and its policies happened to reach their height.
 The annual meeting of the National People's Congress was post-
 poned from 3 June to 20 June and again to 26 June--apparently
 owing to the impact of criticisms of regime policy made at the
 preparatory meetings of the congress by the deputies themselves.
 Chou En-lai opened the congress on 26 June with a bitter blast
 against the regime's rightist critics.
 Chou was on the defensive and therefore was disposed to
 refute charges which he himself, among others, had earlier con-
 ceded.                     He denied that in the course of economic policy the
 regime had "advanced too hastily in 1956," although he had
 admitted this in September.   He also denied that Peiping had
 "retreated too hastily in 1957," or that the regime was res-
 ponsible for a "too great" discrepancy between the life of
 the peasants and workers.   Other than the irritation with
 which he rebutted these criticisms, Chou's defense contained
 little of interest.
 On the question of the rightist criticism of over-centrali-
 zation of the powers of government, however, Chou did acknowledge
 that in order to rid-the nation of this shortcoming  we began an
 examination of the government structure." "The government;,t':,he
 said,  "has decided to mak'rs"y}`;tMe readjustments, expanding the

 powers of local authorities so that their creative initiative
 may be freely developed under the coordinating leadership of
 the central authorities."
 On 29 June, Li Hsien-nien gave a report to the NPC on
 the 1956 budget and the planned 1957 budget.   With regard
 to 1956, Li said that the "achievements were fundamental,
 shortcomings and mistakes secondary."  The "undesirable" ef-
 fects in 1957 of 1956 overspending on progress could be reme-
 died by boosting production, economizing on expenditures, and
 increasing reserves of materials.   Li noted that "it is in-
 evitable that the rate of growth in each year is uneven...there
 will do fluctuations."  There was nothing "impossible" in in-
 creasing the pace "as we did in 1956"; the shortcomings result-
 ed from "lack of experience" on the part of those in financial
 and economic work.
 The general objective of the financial plan for 1957, Li
 said, was to "consolidate 1956."  He predicted that 1957 reve-
 nue would be about 2 percent higher and 1957 expenditures 4
 percent lower than in 1956, and he foresaw that a large am,,unt
 of funds could be saved by cuts in expenditures on administra-
 tion and national defense.  Capital construction in 1957 would
 be about 20 percent less than that of 1956, with most of the
 cuts to be made in the nonproductive category.   Li noted that
 the proportion of cuts in budgetary expenditures would be great-
 er in the case of the central government than in local govern-
 ment expenditure, because "from now on, more enterprises and
 undertakings will be transferred step by step" to local manage-
 ment.
 Li Hsien-nien also expressed satisfaction with the com-
 modity price situation, noting that most of the price fluctua-
 tion in east years had been in the "free market."  This, said
 Li, was "inevitable; in a way it has its positive aspects."
 Li did not imply that all now was well with the state control
 of the "free market"; he left the subject after expressing the
 view that price fluctuation in that market still required
 strengthened state leadership.
 Li apparently was very much in favor of the proposed "rede-
 finition" of responsibility between local and central government
 authorities in financial work, which had been under discussion
 "for more than a year."  He said, "Appropriate changes must be
 made in'the existing method, whereby expenditures and revenues

 Po explained what the mistakes in planning work had been
 in 1956.  First, an excess of 1.5 to 2 billion yuan in capital
 construction by the state had meant that more construction had
 been undertaken than the supply of construction materials and
 equipment had warranted.  Po pointed out that "we were not
 aware of the error then," and the planners' assumption that the
 1956 plan would be 95 percent fulfilled--"as in any of the pre-
 vious years"--was proved wrong when actual fulfillment proved
 to be "99,9 percent."  The specific error, said Po, was that
 "we set the plan too high."
 The second error, in Po's estimation, was in the credit
 and loan policies of 1956.  The 1956 bank loan and credit plan
 contained increases in loans to 1.41 billion yuan; the actual
 figures turned out to be 2.97 billion yuan.  Po was quite ex-
 plicit as to the cause:   "In order to ensure financially the
 great victory of the socialist revolution, it was absolutely
 necessary to increase such loans."  The specific error here,
 said Po, was that "we failed to reduce even small portions of
 the loans in the course of implementing the plan."  The third
 and fourth errors in the 1956 plan were that the planned fig-
 ures for both additions to the labor force (planned: 840,000;
 actual: 2,300,000) and enrollment of students were-too low.
 It was errors such as these that caused a depletion of state
 financial and material reserves.

 of the local authorities are virtually under the control of
 the central financial authorities.  Given these changes, local
 financial authorities  can then,   within  definite  lim-
 its, arrange expenditures and revenue with a free hand."  Li
 hoped that the details of this problem, as well as similar
 measures designed for the financial management of enterprises
 and corresponding changes in the tax system, could be settled
 in "1957 or 1958."
 Po I-po reported to the NPC on the annual plan for 1957.
 He set the background for the plan in the following light:
 "In 1956 our country was stricken by the severest natural ca-
 lamities since the liberation, and an adverse effect is to be
 expected in 1957 in all fields of the national economy...the
 shortcomings and mistakes that took place in our work in 1956
 have resulted in a number of contradictions in certain aspects
 of economic and social work--contradictions which need an im-
 mediate solution."

 Po's statement of "mistakes and shortcomings" in planning
 in 1956 was not a direct statement of the basic problem.  The
 basic problem of the planners was that the rigt.d over-all plan
 for economic development could not withstand the impact of un-
 foreseen changes from two sources.   The first source--the weath-
 er--was somewhat removed from the control of central planning,
 and it apparently took a bad crop year such as 1956 to illu-
 strate to the planners the vulnerability of plan objectives to
 agricultural calamities.
 The second source--political policies pursued by the re-
 gime--was the area in which "the lack of experience," as the
 planners put it, particularly caused difficulties.  Po's first
 "mistake"--that of setting capital construction targets too
 high--was more a case of projecting fulfillment than of setting
 targets.  The "99.9-percent" instead of "95-percent" fulfillment
 could be laid directly to the political pressures generated for
 fulfillment in the "upsurge" of 1956.
 In similar fashion, Po's second "mistake"--that of not re-
 covering part of the unexpected increase in loans made in ;i956--
 side-steps the issue.  The "mistake" lay not with the recovery
 of these funds, but rather in that the planning mechanism and
 the planners themselves were not prepared for a primary effect
 of the policy of "rapid socialization of industry and agricul-
 ture."                    The increase in the number of economic units in agri-
 culture, industry and, commerce under state control as the re-
 sult of socialization created an equivalent increase in the
 number of units eligible for loan support from the state.  Po's
 statement that "it was absolutely necessary to increase such
 loans" in order to "ensure financially the v4.ctory of the so-
 cialist revolution" was correct; this loan eitgibility had been
 one of the regime's chief inducements to "noc:balization" in the
 "upsurge of socialist transformation" in late 1955 and early
 1956.
 The remainder of Po?I-po's speech, outlining the 1957 eco-
 nomic plan, repeated most of the points made in the early months
 of 1957 by Po himself and by Chia To-fu.  Besides the 20-percent
 reductions in capital construction investment, most of the meas-
 ures in the plan were aimed at bringing the development of the
 agricultural sector into line with the rest of the economy.   Al-
 though investment in both industry and agriculture was to be cut,
 Po noted, "We have managed in allocating funds to cut down less
 in the field of agriculture and more in industry."

 Po announced that, in addition to direct support to agri-
 culture, increased emphasis would be given to the chemical fer-
 tilizer industry in order to increase the supply of fertilizers
 available for agriculture.
 Po predicted that the value r   industrial production would
 increase only 4.5 percent in 1957 and went to some lengths to
 point out why the rate of increase was so much below the 32 per-
 cent gained in 1956.   Most of the justification again revolved
 around the impact of the agricultural calamities of 1956 on 1957
 revenue sources.  The length and detailed nature of the justifi-
 cation suggested that some elements within the regime were not
 in sympathy.
 Other highlights of the 1957 plan were the planned conver-
 sion of some of the defense industry's machine-building facili-
 ties to civilian production and an undefined rearrangement of
 centrally and locally controlled machine-building capacity in
 order to "benefit the development of all potentialities of the
 machine-building industry."  Much as he had earlier in the year,
 Po strongly endorsed the change in emphasis from construction
 of large-scale modern plants to small- and medium-size plants
 and increased utilization of existing smaller plants and handi-
 craft industries.  This change in construction policy would
 mean taking "full advantage of the abundant labor supply in our
 country."
 The one anomaly in Po I-pots presentation of the 1957 plan
 was that he did not mention, much less endorse,   the proposed
 "redefinition" of authority between the central and local author--
 ities which both Li Hsien-nien and Chou En-lai highlighted in
 their presentations to the NPC.  Pots silence on the subject
 of decentralization was not consonant with his position as a
 planner.   It might be construed as reflecting his other post
 as head of the State Council's Third Staff Office, the apex
 of government control of heavy industry and construction. Chia
 To-fu in September 1956 had indicated that light industry was
 the chief area to be affected by the proposal.   In late May 1957,
 however, Li Fu-chum indicated that the decentralization would in-
 clude "some heavy industry" as well as light industry.  Po may
 have been concerned over the possible effects of decentraliza-
 tion on the heavy industrial sectors.
 The representatives of the heavy industrial ministries had
 maintained a public silence on questions such as the construction

 of large versus small plants and the advantages and disadvan-
 tages of decentralization.   In August 1957, however, Chen Yu,
 the minister of coal industry, apparently became the first
 casualty of the policy conflict on these two questions. Chen,
 a central committee member, was transferred at that time to
 an unimportant post as a provincial governor.  In April 1958
 the Peiping press noted with approval that "in the past the
 Ministry of Coal was in favor of central government operation,
 large projects, and reliance-; upon the state. It now is in favor
 of local operations, emphasis on small projects, and reliance
 on the people." In addition, the ministry had not been enthusi-
 astic about state pressures for increases in coal production in
 1957.
 The presentation of the 1957 plan and budget to the NPC
 was secondary to the struggle against the "rightists." Despite
 tinued to emphasize this problem for some time after the close
 of the NPC. In the meantime, the normal timetable for drawing
 up annual plans was compressed; three weeks after the close of
 the NPC, a conference was held in Peiping to draw up the con-
 trol figures for the 1958 plan.
 Po I-po and Chia To-fu were the key figures at this con-
 ference, which was held from 25 July to 22 August 1957.   Their
 statements on the outlines of the 1958 plan indicated that the
 planners envisaged only slight increases in the 1 Db targets
 over the 1957 level.  The "guiding line" for the 1958 plan was
 the "policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneous-
 ly, increasing investment in agriculture and industries that con-
 cern the development of agriculture, and developing agriculture
 and the chemical fertilizer industry, for a gradual change in
 the backward situation of agriculture."  The striking element
 in both Po's and Chia's formulation of the "guiding line" was
 not only the equal weight given to "simultaneous" development
 ence to the "priority" of heavy industry. Up to this time, state-
 ments of the "guiding line" for economic development had repeat-
 ed the formulation, contained in the First Five-Year Plan, of
 "giving priority to the development of heavy industry." It was ap-

 present problem," Po said, "is how to use the accumulated capi-
 tal to reinforce the weak links of...agriculture and those in-
 dustries producing raw materials and fuels."
 Chia To-fu's remarks on the 1958 plan contained a more ex-
 plicit statement of the current policy in industrial construction.
 Capital construction investment in 1958 was to be "slightly more"
 than that of 1957, and "the policy of coordinating large, med-
 ium, and small enterprises--coordinating enterprises managed by
 the central ministries with local enterprises and coordinating
 new enterprises with old enterprises--will be continued."  This
 problem of "coordination" of industrial construction between the
 central ministries and local authorities appeared to be a refer-
 ence to the decentralization measures mentioned earlier in the
 year.   Here, as at the NPC, Po I-po again evidenced little in-
 terest in these  measures at a time when a fellow-planner, Chia
 To-fu, appeared to be stating that a rudimentary form of the
 policy was already in effect.
 On 7 September 1957 a People's Daily  editorial followed up
 the outlines of the 1958 plan as laid out by Chia To-fu and Po
 I-po and repeated that the 1958 plan had been drawn up on the
 basis of Mao's "contradictions" speech.  The omission of "pri-
 ority to heavy industry" noted in the planning conference speeches,
 was, however, corrected by the editorial.   The People's Daily
 formulation stated, "The principles for drawing up   a 1958 plan
 are as follows:   carry out the policy of developing industry and
 agriculture simultaneously, starting from the premise of develop-
 ing heavy industry as the core of national construction."
 The editorial also estimated that, from the preliminary 1958
 targets, "it appears that grain and cotton supplies in 1959 will
 still be unable to catch up with the rising living standards and -
 developing industry, and that supply of most other crops it.aeded
 by industry will remain tight."  In spite of this rather pessi-
 mistic view of the future,  People's Daily concluded:   "Let each
 person do the job of several an   a  each dollar run further than
 usual.  .4. plan made in this spirit will definitely lead to a new
 upsurge in China's national economy during 1958 and create a
 good beginning for the Second Five-Year Plan."
 Taken in the context of the entire editorial and within the
 framework of prevailing moderate approaches to economic develop-
 ment, it could not be said that this People's Daily reference to
 a "new upsurge" in 1958 was the clarion of the present "leap

 forward" movement.  Rather, it appears that in September 1957
 the regime foresaw that the period of retrenchment would be
 successfully concluded in 1957 and that it looked forward to
 a level of economic development in 1958 somewhat higher than
 that of 1957.
 It has been suggested that despite the "upsurge" of 1956 ,
 some of the party's leaders--perhaps principally Chen Yun--
 became concerned early in 1956 over the course of economic de-
 velopment, in the light of the new problems raised by the rapid
 suArcess of "socialist transformation."  This concern was sanc-
 tioned by Mao in his April 1956 speech.  Concern was sharply
 intensified by the failure of plans for greatly increased pro-
 duction in agriculture in the summer of 1956.   A period of con-
 solidation or a "breathing spell"--in order to consider alter-
 natives--became doubly important.
 The concern over new problems was secondary to a spirit of
 optimism during the Eighth Party Congress in September 1956,
 but it emerged clearly at the November 1956 plenum of the cen-
 tral committee, at which the "readjustments" of the 1956 plan
 and budget were announced.  The "readjustments" of the 1956
 plan, the announced necessity for retrenchment in 1957, and
 the mounting of a campaign to "explain" to the peasantry why
 "socialist transformation" had not provided its promised fruits,
 all helped temporarily to remedy the regime's problb-ins.
 At the same time as circumstances dictated a more conser-
 vative approach to economic questions, it became apparent that
 the regime was adopting several new measures designed to stimu-
 late economic growth.  First among these was the proposed de-
 centralization of authority.  The initial outlines of this meas-
 ure were vague but appeared to involve devolution of primary
 managerial authority over most light industry and some heavy
 industry from the central government ministries down to local
 authorities.  An increase in the latitude of local managerial
 authority also served to facilitate implementation of a second
 measure, that of increasing the construction of small, anc me-
 dium plants.                           These two measures were directed at utilising a
 potential presumably overlooked during the First Five-Year Plan
 period.
 One of Chen Yun-?s chief complaints about the "too rapid"
 socialization of industry and commerce in late 1955 appeared
 to be based on the fact that the smaller size, diverse private

 enterprises were not well suited to central government operation.
 The increase in latitude provided local authorities under decen-
 tralization may also have been aimed at solving this problem.
 The theory behind these measures appears to have envisaged
 that all previously under-utilized industrial facilities would
 work at maximum capacity under authorities familiar with local
 conditions, and also that additional small- and medium-size
 plants would be built which would further develop production on
 local levels of government.  Thus while large-scale, modern,
 heavily capitalized industrial facilities would continue to be
 built, the smaller and cheaper facilities would allow for a much
 greater utilization of that most abundant Chinese resource, man-
 power.   In sum, it could be said that the Chinese Communists were
 moving away from the capital-intensive policies of the previous
 five years and moving closer to a labor-intensive program of de-
 velopment.
 The regime had also developed a new appreciation of the Im-
 portance of agriculture in the Chinese economic situation over
 these years.  The measures proposed for strengthening this sector
 through 1957 were not particularly radical.  Additional stimulus
 was given to the construction of irrigation and water conservancy
 works in order to lessen  the impact of natural calamities upon
 agriculture.  Similarly, the construction and production of chem-
 ical fertilizer plants assumed a new priority in industrial
 planning in order to enlarge the supplies of chemical fertilizer.
 A number of increases were made in prices paid by the state for
 agricultural products--a move taken to broaden incentives for
 production.  The attempts to eliminate "commandism" on the part
 of agricultural cadres and the calls for "democratic management"
 of the cooperatives suggested that a moderate approach to the
 problem of peasant dissatisfaction prevailed.
 The abundance of articles explaining the need for more mod-
 erate policies in early 1957, as well as the campaign of expla-
 nation and persuasion undertaken by the economic leadership in
 mid-1957 suggested that the regime hoped to withdraw from the
 high-pressure atmosphere of late 1955 and early 1956 without at
 the same time shaking the confidence and depressing the morale
 of the party faithful.  This effort seems, however, to have been
 unsuccessful.
 The stimulation of the "free market" and the lack of puni-
 tive action against the newly established "capitalist factories."

 practical as these measures were, must have created grave
 doubts about the party's monopoly of economic wisdom. Since
 1949, moreover, annual increases in almost all categories of
 production and investment had become routine.  This customary
 expectation of uninterrupted economic progress year after
 year was disappointed by the planned drop in the pace AlLn 1957.
 Similarly, eight years of progressive centralization of
 government control, and constant descriptions of the Chinese
 industrial millinium in terms of huge industrial combines
 like Anshan and Paotou, had creatad certain conceptions as
 to the proper road to progress.  These conceptions were vio-
 lated in the proposed decentralization and the increase in
 emphasis upon small and medium plant construction.
 It is uncertain whether the economic leaders whose public
 statements announced and elaborated these policies are speci-
 fically those "comrades" whom Liu Shao-chi accused of regard-
 ing 1956 as a "reckless advance."  Their statements did, how-
 ever, establish the climate of opinion which permitted the
 "flurry of opposition to this so-c, sled 'reckless advance"
 which Liu attacked in May 1958.  The result, as stated by Liu,
 was that "this dampened the initiative of the masses and ham-
 pered progress on the production front in 1957,  and particularly
 on the agricultural front."
 Liu stated that the party, at the third plenary session
 of the central committee in September 1957, "soon corrbcted
 this error."  The correction took the form of an exhortation
 for an "upsurge" in the last quarter of 1957 and constituted
 the first stage of what later became the "leap forward" of
 1958.

 III.   THE SECOND UPSURGE
 Party Leaders Prepare for "Upsurge," September 1957
 By early September 1957, the regime was fairly confident
 that the agricultural harvest would be better than the calamitous
 one of 1956.  On 3 September, Li Hsien-nien gave a cautiously
 optimistic progress report on the national economy and budget
 for 1957.   The plan and budget were "in the main satisfactory,"
 chiefly because of the correct guidance--the "readjustment" of
 1956 and the "retrenchment" in 1957--given by the central com-
 mittee at its second plenary session in November 1956.  As evi-
 dence of satisfactory progress, Li noted that the targets for
 financial revenue were expected to be fulfilled and might be
 overfulfilled, and that there might be a small surplus at the
 end of the year.
 Li then considered preliminary planning for the future.
 He noted that the basic targets in the First Five-Year Plan
 had already been fulfilled and "overfulfilled."  He commented
 that "some drawbacks and mistakes had occurred in our work dur-
 ing the past five years but many of these ...could hardly be
 avoided in the course of our advance."  The "striking problem
 that stands out in our economic life at present," he said,  "is
 the fact that agricultural production falls behind the people's
 needs."    The basic method of developing agriculture in this
 period was to be through increasing yields per hectare by in-
 creasing fertilizer supplies, encouraging water conservancy
 and drainage projects, and carrying out technical reforms
 "suitable to practical conditions."  These and other policies
 outlined by Li--cuts in military and administrative expendi-
 tures and a decrease in cultural and educational construction--
 were repetitions of the earlier pronouncements.
 Li foresaw "many favorable conditions" for 1958; he noted
 that "crops were better than average in 1957,11 thus "ensuring"
 increases in financial revenue for 1958, and he also cited
 the "positive" influence of the production and economy cam-
 paign and the rectification campaign.  The remainder of Li's
 discussion was devoted to details of financial work for 1958
 and was chiefly of interest in implying that a decentraliza-
 tion in financial work would take place in the near future.

 A reassessment of the potential of rectification" seems
 primarily to have encouraged the aggressive policies set forth
 at the third plenary session of the eighth central committee
 held between 20 September and 9 October 1957.  The highlights
 of this meeting were Teng Hsiao-ping's report on the "rectifi-
 cation" movement, an unpublished report by Chen Yun on problems
 in increasing agricultural production and the draft regulations
 for the "improvement of the state administrative system," and
 Chou En-la.i's report on changes in the wage system.  Of the three
 primary reports, the only complete text was Teng Hsiao-pings.
 While other members of the central committee undoubtedly spoke,
 only excerpts from a report by Teng Tzu-hui on agricultural pol-
 icies were additionally published.
 The only information on Mao Tse-tung's personal role at the
 plenum comes from an article by Po I-po in Study in March 1958.
 According to Po. Mao emphasized to the plenum     September 1957
 his slogan of "more, faster, better and more economical," and
 criticized the "rightist conservative tendency" in party work.
 Again according to Po. Mao also reflected the monitory line
 found most often in the pronouncements of the economic special-
 ists,  Mao is said to have warned that his anticonservative
 policy "must be grounded in fact and must be in accordance with
 reality."
 Another remark attributed to Mao at the September 1957
 plenum provides further evidence that Mao had decided in favor
 of those urging a "second upsurge" and was warning his audience
 that debate had ended.  Mao said, according to Po, that "the
 problems currently remaining unsolved are those which could have
 bee.a solved if there had been a united struggle."
 Further evidence of Mao's position as of September 1957 is
 provided by the published speeches of other party leaders at
 that time.  The best evidence seems to be in the speeches of
 those leaders salected by Mao to give the major reports to the
 party plenum.
 Teng Hsiao-ping in his report to the plenum reviewed the
 progress of the "rectification" campaign since May 1957. He an-
 nounced that the campaign would be broadened into a nationwide
 movement rather than slack off after Achieving its first ob-
 jective of rectifying the thoughts of the intellectuals, who
 had been the chief source of "rightist" criticism of the regime

 in early 1957.  Thus the movement was now to "gradually spread
 to the workers, peasants and industrial circles."  Teng tied
 the entire future of the regime to the success of the movement:
 This is a socialist revolution on the political
 and ideological fronts.  The socialist revolution on
 the economic front alone in 1956 (in the ownership of
 the means of production) was not enough and is not
 consolidated.   The great national debate now going on
 has solved or is solving such important questions as
 whether the revolution and the work of construction
 have been correct, whether the road of socialism should
 be taken, whether the leadership of the Communist party
 is wanted or not, whether the proletarian dictatorship
 is wanted or not, whether democratic centralism is want-
 ed or not, and whether the foreign policy of our country
 has been correct, etc.   If we fail to win complete vic-
 tory in this debate, we will not be able to continue our
 advance.   If we win this debate, the socialist transfor-
 mation and socialist construction in our country will be
 greatly advanced.
 While the majority of his discourse was devoted to the out-
 lining of measures to be taken to achieve victory in the "de-
 bate", Teng also singled out several areas where specific
 economic policies and judgments made by other members of the
 leadership on the ideological situation in the past, had stim-
 ulated the growth of deviant thinking.
 Although he mentioned no names, Teng attacked three spe-
 cific economic policies for which Chen Yun had been chief spokes-
 man.                            On the question of the rise of "unregistered" or "capital-
 ist" factories which had occurred in late December 1956 and with
 which Chen Yun had publicly expressed satisfaction, Teng stated:
 "Clandestine factories must be banned, and they must be made to
 come into the open so they may be placed under control, supervi-
 sion, and transformation..." Teng was also quite dissatisfied
 with the early halt--in which Chen Yun had been instrumental in
 early 1956--to socialist transformation of the small- and med-
 ium-size industrial and commercial enterprises.  That the cur-
 rent "rectification movement" would remedy this was indicated
 by Tong's statement that "generally, all industrialists and mer-
 chants must be made to receive education, and there must be no
 repetition of what happened in certain past movements when a
 portion of the people were forgotten."

 A third economic policy with which Chen Yun was intimately
 associated and which drew criticism from Teng was that,of the""
 "free market."  One of the basic policies of the state, as Teng
 made c]ear elsewhere in his speech, was the continuance of'sti to
 procurement and distribution of grain.  Tong laid the blame'for
 violations of the policy directly at the door of the "free mar-
 ket."  Citing some of the violations, he said that "many people
 have employed all ways and means of trying to sell less surplus
 grain or other major farm produce to the state.  Some people
 have even engaged in speculative activities--particularly since
 the opening of the free market, when capitalism spontaneously
 made new headway among certain peasants."
 A theme of Tong Hsiao-pi-.g's report which was to become a
 theme of "rectification," was that strong efforts had to be made
 to eliminate the great propensity for following the "capitalist"
 road, particularly, in the countryside.  Teng Tzu-hui's judgment
 in May 1957 had been that the question of whether the peasant
 would take'the road to socialism "had been solved."  Earlier,
 at the Eighth Party Congress, Teng Tzu-hui bad also defended
 the policy of moderate treatment of the middle peasants during
 the socialist transformation of agriculture.  Teng Hsiao-ping
 flatly contradicted both views.
 Recently there has existed within the party a
 serious rightist-deviationist ideology--the view that
 the struggle in the countryside between the two roads
 has come to an end, that there is no longer any need
 to stress the class line, and that efforts can be ex-
 clusively devoted to production and relaxing socialist
 education among the peasants...among functionaries in
 the countryside, there are also a minority who, due to
 changes in their domestic economy, have developed the
 capitalist ideology.  These people in effect take the
 stand of the well-to-do middle peasants on such basic
 questions as cooperation and state purchase and sale,
 and express doubt and dissatisfaction over the policy
 of the party and the State...It would be incorrect to
 forget class analysis and the class line in the coun-
 tryside.   It is imperative to ensure the supremacy of
 the poor and the poor-middle peasants while putting
 the cooperatives on a sounder basis.
 The three stimulants to the rise of "capitalism"--private
 factories, the "free market," and the lack of ideological

 education of the small-scale industrialists--were good examples
 of the activity for which Teng Hsiao-ping demanded "rectifica-
 tion."  He did not qualify his criticism with reservations--such
 as "these policies were correct at the time," or that the poli-
 cies were "well-intentioned but incorrect."
 As noted earlier, there were signs of discontent with the
 criticism of these policies at the time they were announced.
 Teng's attack in September 1957 may mark the ascendency of those
 whose dissatisfaction dated back to the time of the announcement
 of the policies but whose criticism had remained publicly stifled.
 Terg could have mentioned these policies without implying either
 error or almost conscious stimulation of the growth of "capita-
 lism"  to the chief exponent of the policies, Chen Yun.  This
 suggests a fairly wide divergence between Chen Yun, who saw the
 policies as practical, expedient answers to existing problems,
 and Teng Hsiao-ping, who saw the policies as potentially sub-
 versive exceptions to Communist doctrine.
 The divergence of opinion between Teng Hsiao-ping and Teng
 Tzu-hui was different and perhaps more basic than that between
 Chen Yun.  The continuance of a "struggle" between the two roads
 of socialism and capitalism apparently, in Teng Tzu-hut's esti-
 mation placed agricultural production in jeopardy; hence his
 comment that the question had been solved.  He seemed to place
 higher priority upon maintenance of production than on the de-
 velopment of higher forms of "socialist" society.   Teng Hsiao -
 ping, on the other hand, apparently viewed the situation in
 terms of impurities in the "socialist" system.  Teng Hsiao-
 ping's point was that continued "struggle" along the right road
 of "socialism" would not jeopardize production but indeed would
 raise the system to new heights of "socialist" perfection, from
 which it logically followed that agricultural production would
 soar.
 In any case, opinions such as Teng Tzu-hui's would tend to
 generate feelings of content with the status quo and complicate
 the regime's attempts to broaden the scope and quicken the pace
 of "socialist" progress.  To the doctrinaire Communist (like,
 apparently, Teng Hsiao-ping), deeply committed to the necessity
 for continued progress to newer and higher forms of "socialism,"
 Teng Tzu-hui's position verged on the heretical and had to be
 attacked.

 There could be little doubt from Teng Hsiao-ping's "recti??
 fication" report that the pace of economic development iu gen-
 eral, and agricultural development in particular, was to speed
 up.    Teng noted that the draft national program for agriculture,
 which had been neglected in the emphasis upon "retrenchment"
 since late 1956, was to receive new emphasis.   The pro ram had
 been amended by the central committee, and "following the gen-
 eral dabate in the countryside on the socialist and capitalist
 roads, another general debate on agricultural production center-
 ing on this program should be organized so as to bring about an
 upsurge this winter in agricultural production and construction
 ..." Teng then foresaw that the program would again be revised,
 discussed at a "congress of the party toward the end of the year,"
 and then formally promulgated.  Teng equated realization 0!  the
 program with "stamina to struggle consistently against the trend
 of conservatism."  The model year *which was to be "affirmed" was
 that of 1956, said Teng, and while agricultural production had
 been carried out on "firmer ground" in 1957, the phenomenon of
 "lack of stamina must be corrected."
 Teng Hsiao-ping noted that in the past most of the emphasis
 in propaganda and organizational work had been placed on indus-
 trial development, and that this had been "necessary and pro-
 duced positive effects."   But the time had come to stress the
 "important significance of the development of agriculture, and
 change the undesirable atmosphere which has emerged during the
 past two years."  Teng cited the particular requirements in al-
 most exactly the same terms as the planners had used in describ-
 ing the 1957 and 1958 annual plans:   "Increase our investments
 in the capital construction of agriculture (including water con-
 servancy) and make every effort to expand the chemical fertili-
 zer industry and other industries which can promote the deve lop-
 ment of agriculture."
 In addition to underlining the necessity for strengthening
 the agricultural sector, Teng Hsiao-ping endorsed the three de-
 centralization measures brought forth by the politburo at this
 meeting involving changes in the industrial, financial, and com-
 mercial systems.   "The spirit underlying these documents," said
 Teng, "is to shift part of the power to lower levels so as to
 release local initiative, strengthen the leadership of the var-
 ious enterprises and public institutions, and overcome subjecti-
 vism and bureaucracy."  That there were dangers inherent in this
 change was noted by Teng in his reassurance that "at the same
 time it will not impair unified leadership and major construction
 projects."

 These two possible hazards probably represented the two
 major criticisms which could have been leveled during the 18
 months of discussion which had preceded the announcement of
 the decentralization measures. The first assurance--that uni-
 fied leadership would not be impaired--was an echo of the Kao-
 Jao case of 1954, in which party leaders whose power was based
 in part on regional party machines had threatened the national
 leadership.  The second assurance--that major construction proj-
 ects would not be impaired--was,apparently aimed at calming the
 fears of those elements in the regime mho feared diversion of
 state interest in and support of large-scale construction proj-
 ects to less ambitious construction policies as the result of
 decentralization.   Since major construction projects are the
 hallmark of the heavy industrial sector and the leaders of the
 heavy industrial ministries (including their logical spokesman,
 Po I-po) had refrained from all public comment on the decentra-
 lization proposals, heavy industrial circles seemed to be the
 chief beneficiaries of Teng Hsiao-pi ng's reassurance.
 Teng also noted that the new regulations were not perfect,
 and that "they would be supplemented and improved in the course
 of being carried out."  "New contradictions" might emerge when
 "some authority" was shifted to local levels; therefore, said
 Teng, "greater attention to strengthening planning and coordi-
 nation is required."   In addition, this shift of authority to
 local levels was to be bolster(,:,d by a transfer of party and
 government functionaries  down to lower echelons as the result
 of what Teng called a "vigorous" retrenchment.
 The "adjustment" of powers between central and local au-
 thorities, a minor topic in Teng Hsiao-ping's "rectification"
 report, apparently was the main part of Chen Yun's remarks be-
 fore the second plenum of the party.  The points which Chen
 deemed important in the decentralization remain unknown, as
 does his presumed presentation of the revised draft of the 12-
 Year Plan for agricultural development.   In spite of Teng Hsiao-
 ping's rather sharp criticism at this plenum of three earlier
 policies with which Chen oun had been associated, it was evident
 that Chen continued to maintain his position and influence as
 the regime's senxir economic leader.  The decentralization plan
 was to constitute a basic change in the economic administration
 of the regime, and the revised draft program for agriculture was
 to be the bar s for the new emphasis given to agriculture in the
 regime's ect  imic policies.  The fact that Chen gave the report
 on decentralization (rather than Chou En-lai, who had initially

 noted the proposals in 1956) and the likelihood that Chen also
 made the principal report on agriculture (rather than Liao Lu-yen
 or Teng Tzu-hui, the customary spokesmen for agriculture)  un-
 derlined his continuing strong position.
 Excerpts from Teng Tzu-hui's speech at the plenum were pub-
 lished almost one month later.   If Teng had either presented
 the revised agricultural program to the plenum or had commented
 on the relationship of the program to the situation in agricul-
 ture, these excerpts did not indicate it.  For the most part,
 Teng reported on the proceedings of an early September national
 conference on agriculture and, unlike Teng Hsiao-ping, did not
 manifest either dissatisfaction with the progress then being made
 in agriculture or concern with "ideological backwardness" In the
 countryside.
 Teng Tzu-huff's report categorized conditions in agriculture
 as satisfactory, and it contained little that was critical of
 trends in agriculture over the previous 18 months.  The main
 point of interest in his speech was the proposal that the regu-
 lations of cooperatives, which limited the reserve funds of co-
 operatives to a maximum of 5 percent of income, be revised in
 order to enlarge the cooperatives' sources of funds for capital
 construction.   In view of his past insistence that the income of
 cooperative members should show continued increases, Teng Tzu-
 hui's proposal appeared to indicate he felt that the situation
 in agriculture had stabilized and that peasant dissatisfaction
 with this move would be minimal.
 Teng also repeated his earlier proposal for a "two-target"
 system in agriculture--under which a percentage of output would
 be given to the production teams if output exceeded the target
 and workpoints subtracted if output fell below t1e target. Teng's
 citation of the usefulness of incentives was carried over into
 his comments on hog-raising policies.  Teng, noting that a de-
 cline of 17,800,000 hogs in China between the end of 1956 and
 March 1957 had been satisfac;tcrily remedied, laid the resumption
 of growth in hog production to (a) increases in procurement
 prices paid to the peasants for hogs,  (b) solution of the prob-
 lem of supply of hog fodder, and (c) "the Center policy.  'pri-
 vate ownership, private raising, public aid as the main measure
 and collective raising as the subsidiary measure."'  Teng noted
 "restrictions in some localities" on implementation of these
 policies because, among other reasons, "it is argued that hog-
 raising will aid the growth of capitalist thinking on the part

 of co-op members, and the number of hogs is therefore limited
 to one or two head per household."  Teng categorized this at-
 titude as "incorrect."
 Teng Tzu-hut's position at this third plenum was unique.
 Despite the "hard" line laid out by Teng Hsiao-ping, with its
 condemnation of complacency with current conditions and attacks
 upon individual policies which fostered the growth of the "capi-
 talist" spirit, Teng Tzu-hui was able to continue his advocacy
 of moderate policy.   However, his lack of association with the
 presentation of the revised Draft Program for Agr4cultur  indi-
 cated that he was no longer the party's chief spokesman on agri-
 cultural policies.
 The September 1957 plenum of the central committee was des-
 cribed by Liu Shao-chi in May 1958 as having "reaffirmed the need
 to adhere to the principle of achieving 'greater, faster, better,
 and more economical results' in building socialism," and credited
 this meeting with having "corrected" the main error of 1957--
 that of regarding "the leap forward of 1956 as a 'reckless ad-
 vance.' "  With six months of hindsight, Liu may have been over-
 stating the decisiveness of the plenum; nevertheless, it was ap-
 parent from the plenum proceedings that the period of consolida-
 tion which had begun in April 1956 was over.  The general atmos-
 phere of the meeting, and in particular Teng Hsiao-ping's "recti-
 fication" speech, seems to mark the point where the regime tenta-
 tively embarked on a "new course" involving p~.,sibly far-reaching
 innovations in the state administrative syste., and agricultural
 policy.
 In spite of some apparent differences between Teng Hsiao-
 ping and Chen Yun on past policies and more basic disagreement
 on the e=:er-all situation between Teng Hsiao-ping and Teng Tzu-
 hu:., the leaders appeared to be in general agreement that rapid
 progress was in order.
 Exhortations for the Upsurge, Autumn 1957
 The third plenum of the central committee closed on October
 9, 1957; the two main topics--"rectification" and the revised
 draft programs for agriculture--were given additional prominence
 as subjects of a meeting of the Supreme State Conference on 13
 October.  However, Mao's remarks to this body, which is only
 called into session by Mao himself, were not published.   For the
 rest of the month, propaganda and notices ofimeetings on the

 progress of "rectification" dominated the press.  The organs
 of the central government--ministries, bureaus, commissions,
 and the state trading corporations--gave numerous accounts
 of how the "rectification of the style of work"-and the "mo-
 bilization of the masses"                       was proceeding on to more advanced
 levels.
 Two important bodies in which "rectification" was in full
 swing were the organ for annual planning, the National Economic
 Commission, and the long-range planning organ, the State Plan-
 ning Commission.   In the last week of October, both had large-
 scale meetings at which their respective chairmen, Po I-po and
 Li Fu-chun, summed up the campaign.   In both organs, the key
 slogans which were to occupy the attention of the members were:
 "Expanding both industry and agriculture with priority to heavy
 industry," and "Industriously and thriftily constructing the na-
 tion, operating enterprises, managing cooperatives, and managing
 households."  Both Po and Li emphasized the need to eliminate
 bureaucracy and reduce excess personnel.
 For the most part these meetings in the two planning organs
 consisted of restatements of the cliches and slogans which ac-
 companied "rectification" in the other organs of the central gov-
 ernment.  Given the purported objective of "blooming and contend-
 ing" among themselves and "going to the masses" for criticizm of
 their work, it would be expected that some, if not all, of the
 criticisms of planning work that had been made by the chief plan-
 ners themselves in 1956 and 1957 would provide excellent mater-
 ials for the campaign.  However, there was little reflection of
 the admitted "past mistakes" in the published record of "recti-
 fication" in the planning organs.
 There was, however, a somewhat different flavor in the ap-
 proaches to implementing agricultural policy after the September
 plenum.  On 16 October the role of chief spokesman for the re-
 gime on agricultural policy was filled by a comparative newcomer,
 Tan Chen-lin--one of Teng Hsiao-ping's deputies on the party
 secretariat.  Tan "explained" the revised draft program for
 agricultural development to the rubber-stamp Standing Committee
 of the National People's Congress.   Up to this time Tan had
 spoken on agriculture only once, in May 1957, when his article
 on the differential between worker and peasant livelihood had
 been given national prominence.

 Tan's exegesis was not published with the revised draft
 Program for Agriculture. The most meaningful revision contained
 in the draft was the addition of goals for chemical fertilizer
 production.   The program called for, an annual production goal
 of 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 tons of fertilizer by 1962, roughly
 double the 1962 production target of 3,000,000 to 3,200,000
 tons which was contained in the Second Five-Year Plan proposals
 of 1956.
 Some of the more grandiose goals of the original program
 were omitted, as were those sections on the organizational de-
 velopment of agricultural produco.r cooperatives which had been
 made obsolete by "rapid transformation."  While the inclusion
 of increased chemical fertilizer goals was quite indicative of
 the regime's increased concern for agricultural development, the
 whole procedure of "revising" and re-publicizing the program
 appears to have beun more a device for focusing national attention
 on the agricultural problem than a specific plain for actually
 solving the problem.
 Tan Chen-lin appeared again,. as an agricultural policy
 spokesman on 26 October 1957, addressing a provincial water-
 conservancy meeting.'  The conference was to discuss the ex-
 periences of Honan in building small-scale water conservancy
 and irrigation works to offset the problems of drought and
 flooding which periodically occur in that province.  The "suiwn-
 ing up" of these experiences was to provide for a "bumper wheat
 crop" in 1958 and was to be "based" on the newly revised draft
 program for agriculture.
 The very aggressive approach to the agricultural situation
 which marked Tan's presentation had not been evident since the
 height of the "socialist transformation" period in late 1955.
 Tan held up 1956 as a model year of effort in agriculture.   In
 response to "mass demands," said Tan, "our party mapped out the
 40-article draft outline," and consequently '"a miracle occurred
 in our industrial and agricultural construction in 1956.  Though
 we did have some defects, the achievements were great and prin-
 cipal.'  The "strength" behind this progress in 1956 was'the
 "giant material force born of the masses' mastery of the party's
 policies and measures."  This, however, had clearly not per-
 sisted.  "Between July last year (1956) and May this year (1957)
 the guiding principles of 'better, more, faster, and more. eco-
 nomical' and the 40-point plan have not been mentioned."  -kan
 complained.   "Why?  Because some people cried,  ' you are going
 too fast.'  Some advanced elements were intimidated by this.   In-
 sufficient confidence is a kind of rightist thinking,"  Tan
 noted that this trend has been reversed and "progressive strength"
 recovered through the "socialist debate" in the cou:,;rysidu,
 the rectification campaign in organization, and the "anti.rightist"
 struggle.

 Tan strongly endorsed the party's emphasis on agriculture
 and the dependency of industry on agriculture.   He emphasized,
 however, that industry remained the "mainstay" and pointed out:
 "We are not developing agriculture for agriculture's sake, we
 are developing agriculture in order to develop industry."  Tan
 stated that the greater part of this increase in agricultural
 development was to come from the construction of medium- and
 small-scale water conservancy and irrigation works primarily
 through the efforts of the peasants themselves and not through
 state financial support.
 Tan's report heralded anothe;: of the regime's annual cam-
 paigns to mobilize the rural population fully for water-con-
 servancy and irrigation work during the season which, prior to
 1949, had been called the peasant's slack period.  The report
 was replete with examples of what "advanced" agricultural units
 had achieved through mobilization of their labor forces--in-
 cluding those of one district i, Kansu which, normally beset by
 drought, had spent the winter piling -snow and ice into ponds to
 assure themselves of adequate water during the growing season.
 Tan foresaw great things for these programs, and underlined
 his conclusion by pointing out that a happy alternative such as
 agricultural mechanization was not likely to present itself;  the
 best that could be Moped for was improvement of existing agricul-
 tural tools through utilizing the "innovations, creations, and
 advanced experiences of the masses."
 While Teng Tzu-hui appeared to have been eclipsed by Tan
 Chen-lin as the regime's chief agricultural spokesman, Teng was
 by no means inactive.  He was noted attending various meetings
 around the country and speaking on agricultural problems on
 several occasions after the close of the September plenum of
 the central committee.
 On 10 November 1957, it ,'hantung Province, Teng repeated
 Tan Chen-lin's statement that, while it had been "correct to
 lay emphasis upon industrialization in the past few years," not
 enough publicity had been given to the importance of agriculture.
 Teng stated, "We *:hould try our best to carry out the policy of
 the third plenary session of the central committee of vigorously
 developing agriculture while giving priority to the development
 of heavy industry."  Other parts of Teng's speech also were
 repetitions of Tsn Chen-'lin'e statements, including emphasis on
 mobilization of agricultural manpower.   "Only in this way," said
 Teng, "can the peasants' demands for livelihood and production

 throughout the year."  The funds for developing agricultural
 production,  irrigation projects,  fertilizers, etc.,  "should be
 obtained from the public funds of the agricultural producer co-
 operatives"; the state would provide funds for larger projects
 and items like farm machinery.
 Teng Tzu-hui made several other appearances during the last
 months of 1957, but in most cases his concern appeared to be with
 peripheral problems in agriculture such as the development of
 production in mountainous areas.   Of more interest was the fact
 that none of his pronouncements had the aggressive tone of Tan
 Chen-lin's comments.   While Teng endorsed all aspects of the Sep-
 tember plcnum's policy, and consistently advocated the maaimu,a
 utilization of funds accumulated in the cooperatives, he still
 maintained  the comparatively moderate approach to agricultural
 problems that had characterized the past 18 months.   It was also
 apparent that Teng did not subscribe to Tan Chen-lin's criticisms
 of the handling of agricultural affairs during that period.
 At the same time increased stimulus was being given to agri-
 cultural development, other statements indicated that the pace of
 development was picking up and that the forms of development were
 changing.  After almost a year of comparative silence, Liu Shao-
 chi, speaking at a rally in honor of the 40th anniversary of the
 USSR on 6 November 1957, made it quite clear that speed was the
 order of the day.
 After a long tribute to the various contributions made by
 th4 Soviet Union to the cause of socialism and a listing of the
 past sins of the bourgeois rightists in China, Liu proceeded to
 emphasize the tasks of the future.   He predicted that the First
 Five-Year Plan would be "fulfilled and overfulfilled.'"  While "we
 have already laid a preliminary basis for our industrialization,"
 said Liu,  "the material base of China's socialist system is still
 far from adequate."  Liu was of the opinion that*this could be
 completed in the course of the second and third five-year plans,
 "or a little longer," by carrying out the policy of "developing
 industry and agriculture simultaneously with continued priority
 emphasis on heavy industry."
 Liu stated that there were two ways of accomplishing the
 task:   "One way is tc do things quicker and better; the other is
 to do things slower and aim at lower standards." Liu endorsed
 the former way, asserting that this had been the line of the cen-
 tral committee since the winter of 1955-56.  Liu then proceeded

 to comment on instances where the central committee's (and his)
 advice had not been taken. Liu cited "some people" who,  "under
 the pretext of seeki.ng better quality and greater economy," were
 opposed to doing more at a greater speed and proposed to do less
 and go slower.  He admitted that his position was perhaps not
 quite as simple as it looked, but said,  "We are bound to com-
 mit mistakes if we doubt and reject totally, without making analy-
 sis, the slogan of achieving quantity, speed,  quality, and econ-
 omy."  Liu paralleled Tan Chen-lii's October criticism of the
 past period with his own critique:   "The facts in the last two
 years have proved that the vague doubt and rejection harbored by
 some people hinder the advance of our cause, damage the socialist
 initiative of the masses, and result not in the achievement of
 quantity and speed, nor in quality and economy, but in greater
 waste of manpower, money, and eesources.'"
 Liu Shao-chi concluded by thanking the USSR for making its
 experience and aid available to China.   "In our construction,"
 he said, "we must persist in learning from the Soviet Union, from
 its advanced experiences and advanced scientific knowledge and
 technology...  To value truly this priceless asset requires that
 we adopt a correct attitude in learning from it in connection with
 the actual conditions in China."
 Li Fu-chun, writing in People's Daily of 5 November 1957, also
 gave profuse thanks for the help of the Soviet Union in construc-
 tion.                      Li likened China to the USSR in the early stages of its
 development and characterized the Soviet experience as "useful"
 to China.   Like Liu, Li Fu-shun endorsed the policy of "simul-
 taneous development of industry and agriculture, with priority
 to heavy industry."  Li Fu-chun's formulation of policies in con-
 struction was somewhat different than  Liu's:   "Henceforth con-
 struction, while carrying out the guiding principle of depending
 upon our own strength for further progress, we must also strength-
 en mutual cooperation and close coordination with the Soviet
 camp."
 This was an interesting difference in emphasis between the
 statements of Liu Shao-chi and Li Fu-chun.  'Me "guiding princi-
 ple of depending on our own strength for further progress"
 enunciated by Li was basically an echo of the carefully phrased
 conclusion that the "main purpose of socialist industrializa-
 tion...is to build up...a comprehensive industrial system"--a
 conclusion contained in Chou En-lei's report on the Second Five-
 Year Plan proposals made at the Eighth Party Congress in 1956.

 While neither Li nor Liu denied the necessity for Soviet
 assistance in construction, only Li Fu-chun chose to empha-
 size that dependency upon the USSR was not envisaged.
 As of November 1957, the lead in the second "upsurge"
 was publicly being taken by three party leaders--in order of
 appearance, Teng F,Tsiao-ping, Tan Chen-lin, and Liu Shao-chi--
 who had  been discussed in earlier POLO papers as "party-ma-
 chine" or "organizationa r''figures with similar backgrounds
 and apparently similar dispositions.  They apparently were
 acting in accordance with the wishes of Mao Tse-tung, the
 driving force behind the "upsurge" of 1955-56.  The three
 were being supported, in general, by the party's economic spe-
 cialists--Chen Yun, Li Fu-chun, Li Rsien-nien, Po I-po, and
 Teng Tzu-hui--some of whom had been discussed in earlier POLO
 papers in terms of an "administrative" group around Chou En-
 lai, others . of  whom were. regarded as "unaligned."  The
 economic specialists, however, took a less positive and em-
 phatic line than did the "party-machine" leaders and showed
 a greater sensitivity to actual and potential problems.  'In
 other words, in their public roles there was a distinction
 between the Exhorters and Threateners on one hand and the
 Technicians on the other, between those less directly respan-
 sible and those more directly responsible, which suggested
 at least the possibility of genuine and serious differences
 in their views as to policies and procedures.
 Regulations on Decentralization, November 1957
 The State Council's promulgation on 15 November 1957 of
 three sets of regulations for "improvements in the financial,
 commercial, and industrial management systems served almost
 as documentation of how the regime was, in Li Fu-chun's words,
 going to carry out "the guiding principle of depending on our
 own strength for further progress."
 Of the three sets of regulations, those on the "improve-
 ment" of the industrial management pystem were principal, with
 the changes in the commercial and financial systems apparently
 auxiliary.  The official explanation of the industrial manage-
 ment regulations indicated that the new regulations were to
 rectifiy "two main shortcomings."  First, some enterprises were

 being controlled inappropriately by the industrial minis-
 tries of the central government, with the result that "the
 powers of the regional administrative authorities with re-
 oard to the allocation of materials, financial control,and
 personnel management have been too limited."  Second, the
 administrative power of the individual managers of enter-
 prises had been too limited, while the industrial ministries
 :Aad "exerted too much control" over the affairs of individ-
 ual enterprises.
 The regulations did not envisage a wholesale shift of
 contro: much as Chia To-fu had indicated at the Eighth Par-
 ty Cong,'ess, the enterprises which were shifted to the con-
 trol of local authorities were in the fields of light indus-
 try, food industry, and textile industry.   Industrial ac-
 tivities expected from the change, and which were to continue
 to be controlled' by the industrial ministries of the central
 government, werc "large" heavy industrial installations and
 major transportation facilities.  All others "suitable for
 transfer" were to be transferred "gradually."  In addition,
 perhaps a source of unhappiness in the heavy industrial min-
 istries was that "all enterprises" under the control of the
 ministries were henceforth to fall under the "dual leader-
 ship" of both central and regional authorities.
 These shifts of control of enterprises down to local-
 level management, plus the planned increase in local-level
 participation in apparently all facets of industrial manage-
 ment, were not empty gestures.  The second section of the
 regulations dealt with increasing the control of local au-
 thorities over the allocation of industrial materials; this
 appeared to give a local authority, such as a province, the
 power to balance the needs of both provincially operated in-
 dustry and of ministry-controlled enterprises in its area of
 jurisdiction against supplies available within the province.
 The regulation made it clear that this over-all power was one
 of "balancing" only, for the existing system of centrally con-
 trolled application for and allocation of materials remained
 unchanged.  The most concrete expression of widened authority
 to local organs was the proviso that material allocations for
 purely local-government-operated enterprises and joint state-
 private enterprises under local control could be handled by the
 local authorities.  An incentive factor was added  at  this

 point:   if locally operated enterprises could overfulfill the
 state plan for production of materials for centralized distri-
 bution, "a proportion" of the overfulfillment was to be set
 aside for that local authority's "disposal and use."
 The third section of the regulations widened the extent to
 which local authorities could share in the profits earned by in-
 dustrial enterprises.  Thus, local governments were allowed to
 split the profits of former central government enterprises which
 had been shifted to their control, retaining 20 percent them-
 selves and passing 80 percent to the central government.   As be-
 fore, local governments remained entitled to all profits earned by
 enterprises which had been locally controlled.   Local governments
 were, however, barred from sharing profits of enterprises con-
 trolled by such ministries as Second Machine Building, Post and
 Telecommunications, Railway, as well as all "large" heavy indus-
 trial installations and water-borne transportation networks.
 The fourth section of the regulations sanctioned an increase
 in the voice of local government authorities in control over,
 first, the personnel of enterprises transferred to local control,
 and, second (and more cautiously), the personnel of central gov-
 ernment ministerial enterprises within the local governments'
 area of jurisdiction.  This measure on personnel appeared to be
 the primary sphere where the system of "dual control" in central
 government enterprises envisaged in the regulations would be
 operative.
 The second major section of the regulations deal-  with the
 changes in enterprise management and administration.    Chief among
 them was the reduction of the number of enterprise  targets de-
 creed and fixed by the national planning organs from twelve to
 four.   In effect, however, the national planning organs retained
 effective control by the nature of the four targets they reserved
 to themselves--volume of production of principal products, total
 number of workers, total wages, and total profits.  The power to
 set three of the remaining eight targets--trial production of new
 products, quotas for technical development, and percent of cost
 reduction--were given to the central government ministries.   The
 remaining five--total value of production, amount of cost reduc-
 tion, worker attendance, average wage, and labor productivity--
 were placed in the hands of local authorities.  The net effect of
 this reallocation of target-fixing responsibility appears to have
 been that of throwing the responsibility for reducing the costs
 of production on the-shoulders of local authorities and enterprise

 managers, while retention of control of the four main targets
 by the national planning organs meant that over-all targets of
 output of principal products would be observed.
 Other portions of this section of the regulations broadened
 the sphere of activity for local organs, yet maintained the over-
 all control of the central government.  The state maintained its
 control of the four main targets in capital construction--total
 investment, number of above-norm projects, employment of man-
 power in construction, and volume of work in construction and
 installation; however, the local authorities were given wider
 latitude in utilizing local construction funds after meeting the
 above four targets.   Similarly, the central government restricted
 itself to formulation of annual plans, leaving quarterly and
 monthly plans to the ministries and local authorities.
 The regulations also contained a new system of sharing the
 profits of enterprises: first, between the central government
 and the ministries; second, between the ministries and their
 subordinate enterprises; and third, between the industrial de-
 partments of the various, local authorities and their subordinate
 enterprises--all predicated on the assumption that the profit
 targets of the various enterprises were first achieved.  The
 regulations made fairly clear that, for the most part, expendi-
 tures for technical and organizational imprpvements and for trial
 production of new products and labor safety, in the case of cen-
 tral ministry-run enterprises and locally run state-owned enter-
 prises, would be assumed respectively by the ministries and local
 authorities, instead of being allocated as formerly from the cen-
 tral government budget.
 The regulations also indicated, however, that the socialized
 sector of industry, the joint state-private enterprises, ;:,till
 constituted an organizational problem to the regime.   "In view of
 the fact that in the past there were no established rules govern-
 ing the allocation of the above-mentioned expenditures" for this
 type of industry, and "in view of the fact that a majority of
 the joint state-private enterprises are medium-size and small
 ones," the regulation stipulated,  further study was needed be-
 fore a system of profit-sharing could be instituted.  The last
 section of the regulations gave widened powers to the management
 of enterprises to hire and fire workers as well as to readjust
 their tables of organization and personnel, "provided that the
 total number of workers and employees is not increased as a re-
 sult."

 The "improvements" in the regulations of the commercial
 system paralleled those of the industrial system.   They stipu-
 lated first, a merging of most of the two main commercial ac-
 tivities--commercial-processing enterprises and the procurement
 and distribution organs--into one "administrative-enterprise
 management joint organization."  A system of "dual leadership"
 between the central and local authorities, much like that con-
 tained in the industrial regulations was advocated for the un-
 merged purchasing and distribution stations and processing
 enterprises, with the commercial departments of the central gov-
 ernment maintaining "primary" and local authorities "secondary"
 control.
 All enterprises engaged in the processing business, with
 the exception of "large" enterprises, were to be transferred
 to local authorities; nevertheless, production assignments,
 specification and quality of products, changes in productive
 equipment and capacity, and the rates charged for processing
 were set and controlled by the commercial organs of the central
 government.  The central government retained control of four key
 targets in commercial work:   purchasing plan, sales plan, total
 number of workers, and amount of profits--giving, however, a
 flexibility of 5 percent either way to local authorities in im-
 plementing purchasing and sales plans.  Again, parallel with the
 industrial regulations, a system of sharing profits of various
 commercial enterprises between central and local government
 authorities on an 80-20 percent basis was stipulated.
 The key area where little or no latitude was given to local
 authority was that of price control.  The setting of purchasing
 and selling prices of agricultural and sideline products, which
 fell under the categories of planned purchasing, centralized
 purchasing, or unified purchasing, remained in the hands of the
 central authorities.   Fixing of purchasing prices for industrial
 goods, whether under the centralized allocation system or the
 centralized distribution system, also remained a power of the
 central government.   Similarly, the market prices of major and
 secondary commodities were to be set either by the central gov-
 ernment itself or by local authorities "in accordance with the
 price policies of the different commercial departments."
 Local authorities were also promised that they would be al-
 lowed to share in the foreign exchange derived from the export
 of industrial and agricultural products "above the stipulated
 quotas."  Here, as in the case of the profit-sharing system, the
 local authorities were apparently given inducements or incentives
 to exceed targets.

 The most striking impression of these re g ulationi on the
 industrial and commercial system is their increase of incentives
 to local authorities for increases in production or improved
 control of local production.  The incentive factor lay in the
 widening of the sphere of local operations--the new participa-
 tion in profits generated by enterprises, and the increase in
 the responsibility of local government organs in such lesser
 fields as personnel and material allocations and the subcate-
 gories of the planning process.
 In many respects the best illustration of new incentives--
 which might best be called bureaucratic incentives--is contained
 in the "improvements" in the financial system.
 The text of the announcement of the new financial regula-
 tion described the significance of the change as lying in:
 "The clarification of the boundaries of the income ex-
 penditure of local finance, in the appropriate increase
 in local powers in financial control, and in the increase
 of local authority to use finance and resources flexibly,
 under the condition that the fulfillment of major state
 construction projects is giaranteed, for the further de-
 velopment of local enthusiasm in accumulation funds, in-
 creasing income, and conserving expenditure, to stimulate
 the development of state construction as a whole."
 The "appropriate increase" in financial powers lay, first,
 in the introduction of a new category of local income--that de-
 rived from sharing with the central governemnt the profits of
 both the enterprises transferred from the central government to
 local authorities and those which remained under central govern-
 ment control.   The regulation;  stipulated a trial period, in
 which each local organ was to establish a balance between its
 expenditures and income; a portion of any surplus resulting was
 to be passed on to the central government.   In the case of def i-
 cits, the first measure was an expansion of the local organs'
 share of profits of enterprises split, "as a rule," with the
 central government on a 20-80 percent basis.   If the locality
 was still unable to achieve a balance, the central government
 would then allocate a portion of the funds derived in that lo-
 cal area from commodity and income taxes, state bond proceeds,
 etc., to the local government.   If this did not result in a
 balance between  income and expenditure, the central government
 would then provide aid through direct allocation.

 The second "appropriate" increase in local powers of fi-
 nancial control, also with an incentive effect,  lay in the pro-
 vision that, after the period of "clarification" of budgets had
 passed and the various localities had established their balances
 between income and expenditure, any future surpluses achieved by
 the localities through execution of these budgets were to be re-
 tained by the local authorities.
 These changes mark the point at which, after 17 months of
 discussion and apparent experimentation, something of a syste-
 matic approach to major modifications of past economic policies
 began to take form.   The "errors" of the planners in 1956--of
 slighting existing established industrial facilities and not
 giving proper weight to the importance of constructing medium-
 and small-scale projects--apparently could not be fully recti-
 fied until the regime was organizationally prepared and capable
 of controlling their development.   This is essentially the mean-
 ing of the regime's explanation of the two disadvantages which
 were to be rectified by these regulations.   First, the central
 government ministries' responsibility for an control over ex-
 termely diverse and often small and inconsequential enterprises
 was to be passed over to local authorities, who were presumed
 to be in a better position to handle the problems of these en-
 terprises.  The second disadvantage,  that of "too much control"
 over individual managers of enterprises by the central government
 ministries, was apparently to be remedied by closer coordination
 and cooperation between individual enterprise managers and the
 local authorities.   These changes appear to have been aimed pri-
 marily at rationalizing operations in existing small- and medium-
 scale enbe:prises,  If in the future, however, any policy of constructing
 small- and medium-scale industrial enterprises on a large-scale
 were fully implemented, these regulations indicated a method
 by which the local authorities could bear large portions of the
 costs of construction.
 It was also apparent that the central government planning
 organs were to be relieved of a number of time- and manpower-
 consuming responsibilities through the reduction in the number
 of plan targets for which they were responsible.   Nevertheless,
 the target-setting powers retained by the central planning
 organs, and in similar fashion the retention  of price-control
 powers by the commercial departments of the central government,
 guaranteed over-all central government control over all phases
 of economic activity.   People's Daily on 18 November noted that:

 "Plans must not be rigidly determined; other-
 wise it would be very difficult for them to comply
 with reality, and their implementation would also
 be very difficult.   Accordingly, even in plans in
 which centralization is essential, there can be only
 general outlines of major items, with the more de-
 tailed parts left to local authorities to work out
 according to their own conditions.   Such being the
 case with plans, the other things, to be sure, offer
 no exception.... In the interests of efficient cen-
 tralization, power must be delegated to a certain
 extent to local authorities ...such delegation of
 power to local levels may look like a weakening of
 centralization but, ii,, effect, serves to strengthen
 it."
 This last sentence of the quotation above had ramifica-
 tions which were not emphasized by the editorial: within the
 framework of over-all central control, the local authorities
 were given some increase in their power over and responsibil-
 ity for economic affairs.   It was also apparent that incentives
 --in the form of more diverse spheres of activity, somewhat
 greater participation in the decision-making process, and
 probably, eventually larger increments of funds at their disposal--
 were provided, which, as the Communists themselves put it,  "stim-
 ulated local enthusiasm" for carrying out economic tasks.     If
 the provision of incentives to local authorities developed their
 "enthusiasm" for increased efficiency in administering both their
 existing economic enterprises and their newly acquired enter-
 prises,  it would follow that these same incentives would stim-
 ulate these local authorities to enlarge their spheres of ac-
 tivity by every means at their command.  Such an enlargement
 would presumably lead the local authorities to make sure that
 no productive or potentially productive economic activity in
 their respective areas escaped their control.   In other words,
 such unsocialist phenomena as the "unregistered" or "clandestine"
 factories and participants in the "free market" might more eas-
 ily be brought under state control than in the past, through the
 agency of the local government authorities.   People's Daily's
 comment that these measures strengthened centralization was
 perhaps appropriate.
 These "improved" regulations were admittedly trial ones
 and were largely limited to light industrial activity.  They

 were, however, well thought out and constituted a first step
 in a new direction for the regime.   People's Daily, in a ref-
 erence to Mao's April 1956 speech, cre   a    im with "point-
 ing out this question" at that time and noted that uiscussion
 of these changes had been under way for "more than one year"
 from that time.  The improvements were, of course, "fully
 correct."  As might also be expected, People's Daily cited
 these improvements as providing "considerable ass s ante to
 local authorities to greet the production upsurge and to or-
 ganize the production upsurge."  The construal of these reg-
 ulations as a means of "organizing" this upsurge was to be-
 come most important four months later, when the "upsurge"
 became the "great leap forward."

 The Eve of the "Leap Forward," December 1957
 Liu Shao-chi, opening a Trade Union congress on 2 Decem-
 ber 1957, sounded a note of ebullient optimism about China's
 economic future.   Speaking "on behalf of the central commit-
 tee," Liu called for the regime to "Forge ahead at full steam."
 He asserted that the USSR would be "able to catch up with or
 surpass the United States" within 15 years and stated that "we,
 on our part, should strive to surpass Britain with respect to
 iron and steel and other major industrial products" within the
 same period.   Liu's new slogan,"Catch up with Britain in 15
 years," was almost immediately picked up and blended with the
 other exhortations that were accompanying the "upsurge."
 Lip: Fu-chun, addressing the same congress five days later,
 gave a more balanced view of the new atmosphere in economic af-
 fairs.   Li gave the congress a review of the First Five-Year
 Plan results, noting that achievements were primary; mistakes
 "secondary."  He cited estimates that industrial output over
 the five-year period would exceed the target by 17 percent and
 that capital construction investment would exceed it by 13 per-
 cent.   Li mentioned that heavy industrial development had been
 most pronounced over the period, but that the regime had "also
 tried" to develop agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy.
 What had been done for the masses, he said, was the "very best
 that could be done under the conditions."  All in all, the re-
 gime had succeeded in achieving "well-balanced development,"
 despite "extremely weak foundations," by "making full use and
 reconstruction of existing enterprises."
 Li resurrected the old criticisms of the "mistakes and
 shortcomings" of the planners, including mishandling cf the
 "inter-relationships" between the different branches of the
 economy and between "different localities," and "dislocations
 in target-setting."  Li's main concern, however, was with the
 future.   Li foresaw the "establishment of a basically complete
 and integrated industrial system" by 1969, because the "estab-
 lishment of a socialist system paves the way for the full de-
 velopment of productive forces."  This "full development" was
 to result in a "new upsurge" in 1958.
 Li Fu-chun described the party as having "consistently
 taken a positive promotional attitude of opposing passive
 and conservative attitudes."  He cited as one example the
 central committee's "winter 1955" policy of doing "more,

 The party's wisdom was being applied to the problems o

 At the end of his speech, Li Fu-chum cautioned against
 what was apparently an overly enthusiastic implementation o                      some of the new elements of economic policy:
 "...In carrying out this work we should not only take
 into consideration the need for improving livelihood,
 but also meet the needs of the state in construction..

 in the localities, but also meet the needs of the cons
 for the solution of problems in production, constructi
 labor, and people's livelihood, we should always assum
 an over-all viewpoint..." (Underlining supplied.)
 This quotation is interesting for two reasons.  First, Li's
 "but" clauses seemed to indicate that the new, if somewhat
 limited, vistas opened by the regime--the stimulation of in
 creased activity on the part of local authorities, and the
 gime's recognition of the virtues of small-scale industrial
 struction--were beginning to animate  excessively a large s

 of society.  As will be indicated later, an excess of enthusi-
 asm was also afflicting a number of the top leaders of the re-
 gime.
 The second interesting feature of Li's statement was the
 order of priority used in the last sentence of the quotation --
 "production, construction, labor, and people's livelihood."   This
 was a complete reversal of the priority which Li, as well as Chen
 Yun, Li Hsien-nien, Po I-po, and Chia To-fu, had emphasized dur-
 ing the first six months of 1957--people's livelihood; produc-
 tion, and capital construction.
 Li Fu-chun commented again on the "more, faster, better,
 and more economical" line in an article, presumably written
 in early December 1957, which appeared the following month in
 Planned Economy.   Again Li showed his sense of the need for bal-
 anced development.   He criticized that "conservative thinking"
 which wished to keep production at a low level or which failed
 to "discover latent capacity."  He went on, however, to criti-
 cize also the "incorrect understanding" which would urge con-
 struction "at a greater and faster pace in every department,
 every region, and every sector."  Similarly, Li derided those
 who "do not take into account objective conditions," who "do
 not understand that we must proceed in accordance with the law
 of planned, proportionate development..."  Li descrited these
 latter two groups as manifesting, respectively, "rash advance"
 and "superficially activism but in fact conservatism."
 Despite the cautionary remarks by such leaders as Li Fu-
 chun, the atmosphere of "retrenchment" and "readjustment"--
 which had characterized the period from the party plenum of No-
 v?Ymber 1956 to the plenum of September-October 1957-had been
 completely dispersed by December 1957.   The leaders of the re-
 gime, Li Fu-chun among them, had decided and confidently embarked
 on new courses of action.   The reconsignment of "people's live;li-
 hood" to the bottom of the list of national priorities indicated,
 as it had in the "upsurge" of 1955-56, an increase in the pace
 of development.
 A second national planning conference met in the first two
 weeks of December 1957 to consider the 1958 plan.   The summary
 of this conference stated that the 1958 plan targets were now
 "much higher than the level set forth in the control figures
 for the national economy in 1958 calculated by the July national

 planning conference."  The guiding principle of the 1958 plan
 was reaffirmed to be that of "developing industry and agricul-
 ture simultaneously, with priority given to the development of
 heavy industry."
 December saw a flurry of speeches by party leaders to vari-
 ous audiences on the prospects for 1958.   Speeches by Chia To-fu,
 Liao Lu-yen, Tan Chen-lin, Po I-po, and Chu Te were representa-
 tive.  Chia was more moderate in tone than the others.
 Chia To-fu, speaking on 17 December 1957, provided some
 information as to where the policy of building small-size in-
 dustrial facilities was having substantial impact.   Chia noted
 that "cooperativization" had enabled the state to "integrate
 handicraft production with the state's industrial production
 plans."  He warned, however, against "hasty merging" of small
 handicraft cooperatives into larger ones or their convers'on
 i;ato "state workshops" unless they were producing goods suita
 ble for mass production.  The others were to remain "scattered
 and flexible," serving the people.  Chia implied that this merg-
 ing, as well as "mechanization" of handicraft producer coopera-
 tives and their transformation into state-operated enterprises,
 was being undertaken to develop small-scale industrial facili-
 ties.   In any event, Chia did not consider their development
 feasible, as the wage and welfare systems of state-operated in-
 dustrial enterprises were "too heavy" for them.
 Chia gave a short summary of "accumulation versus consump-
 tion" policies izi the handicraft cooperatives.  After socialist
 transformation in 1956, the policy had been that of "giving top
 priority to increases in wages, second to medical expenses,  and
 third to accumulation"--a policy which had "been correct at that
 time."  However, "a number of cooperatives failed to understand
 the true meaning of this measure,   After having developed pro-
 duction and increased profits, a spontaneous capitalist tendency
 peculiar to petty producers developed among them."  This, of
 course, had to be rectified.  Chia's comments had the same im-
 plication as had Li Fu-chun's earlier speech:  that the old
 priorities which placed either wage increases or livelihood
 first had been changed to ones which gave priority to accumula-
 tion for increased production.
 Minister of Agriculture Liao Lu-yen who had been notably
 silent for 18 months, commented on "rectification" in agricul-
 ture on 26 December, following the aggressive line in agricultural

 policy that Tan Chen-lin had laid out in October 1957.   Liao
 repeated the pattern of "socialist upsurge in 1955" bringing
 on the "productive upsurge" of 1956, and he condemned the
 "small typhoons" of late 1956 and early 1957 that had smashed
 the policy of ,more, faster, better, and more economical" and
 the implementation of the 12-Year Program for agriculture.   Liao
 emphasized that the changes brought about by "socialist educa-
 tion" in the countryside and the renewed emphasis on the 12-Year
 Program in the last half of 1957 had caused "no great losses" in
 the rural areas; in fact, a "new upsurge" was developing.
 Liao called the production of food crops the determining
 factor in controlling the pare of development of industrial
 crops.   This, said Liao, "is at variance with the thinking of
 some peasants, especially well-to-do peasants, who are interest-
 ed only in growing those crops which bring the most income and
 are unwilling to obey the plans of the state.   They demand that
 the state supply them with food when they do not have enough
 to eat.  This is a sign of spontaneous growth of capitalism
 among the peasants,--a tendency which must be eliminated."   Xt
 was apparent from Liao's comments on agriculture and Chia To-
 fu's on handicraft cooperatives that the 'rectification" and
 "socialist education" treatments were still not too effective
 as fungicides for these recurring breakouts of "spontaneous
 capitalism."
 Liao also noted that the l956 policy on dirtribut:,on in
 the agricultural producer cooperatives--that of setting aside
 "the minimum amount of public reserve funds and distributing
 the maximum amount of cooperative income among the members"--
 should be reversed, as Teng Tzu-hui had suggested in September
 1957, lest "the work of building up the communal capital of
 the cooperative be jeopardized...which in turn will jeopardize
 the carrying out of capital construction."  Liao equated the
 "typhoons" of 1956-57 with the opposition of well-to-do peas-
 ants, who represented "conservatism.-'  Like Chia To-fu with
 respect to  handicraft cooperatives, Liao disapproved of this
 situation in agriculture.   "It is incorrect to show yielding
 or show lethargy before wind and waves," said Liao.   It was
 particularly wrong to be conservative "after Mao and the cen-
 tral committee have repeatedly given us the necessary encourage-
 ment. "
 Liao Lu-yen endorsed Teng Hsiao-ping's statement that 1956
 was the year to be "affirmed."  While agricultural work in 1957

 had been "commendable," he said, the spirit of 1956 was what
 was needed.   Liao cautiously endorsed the concept of "advanced
 experiments," but suggested that such now ideas be fully proven
 before large-scale dissemination, lest "tremendous loss ensue."
 Liao was evidently referring to the new, and sometimes rather
 radical, technical policies which the regime was being offered
 by the "masses."
 The primary task for which Liao and other agricultural
 leaders were "mobilizing the masses" was that of constructing
 water-conservancy and irrigation projects.   Campaigns of this
 type had occurred every winter since at ,.east 1953, but the
 scale and thoroughness of the campaign in late 1957 exceeded
 those of earlier years.   Throughout December, all of the agri-
 cultural leaders--Liao Lu-yen, Teng Tzu-hui, and Tan Chen-lin--
 encouraged the movement.
 Tan appeared at various provincial and national forums on
 water conservancy and apparently continued to concentrate on
 the benefits of utilizing labor on a large scale for such proj-
 ects.   On 21 December  he singled out several "special character-
 istics"     water-conservancy work.
 The first special characteristic was that socialist trans-
 formation had "enabled us to solve problems concerning the la-
 bor force needed for the construction and repair of irrigation
 projects, as well as the land, materials and capital for these
 projects."  Tan indicated that the drive in 1958 was both broad-
 er and more carefully planned; "i.n the past," water-conservancy
 projects "were carried out by a single cooperative or by a
 hsiang...now it has even developed to the scope of a province,
 with a unified plan and the united action of an entire province."
 Tan noted this widespread movement was only possible as the re-
 sult of the "cooperativization" of agriculture.  Tan also cited
 "the experience" gained in the last two years of rural work and
 the ideological impetus provided by "socialist education,  (which)
 raised the consciousness of the broad masses of peasants."
 Several months later, this mass movement for water con-
 servancy and irrigation was to be described as one of the pri-
 mary reasons for the exceptional 1958 harvest.  Further, this
 movement--in particular its development within the "scope of
 a province" rather than in the lower level3 of rural adminis-
 tration--was cited by the regime as one of the factors leading
 to the formation of "communes."

 On 19 December, Po I-po reported on the progress of
 "rectification" in the economic departments of the central
 government.  No text was available at the time, and it was
 not until March 1958 that Study published a version with
 some "deletions".
 The largest portion of Po I-po's report was concerned with
 the statistical grounds for central committee's goal of over-
 taking Great Britain in iron and steel production in 15 years.
 The attainment of the goal was very much dependent on the at-
 titude of economic departments toward production; the "recti-
 fication" of these attitudes was the subject of the rest of
 Po's report.  This part of the report w!ts informative, because
 Po outlined the types of attitudes, prevailing in the economic
 departments in the past, which were being "rectified."  More-
 over, Po made a number of propoea.ls which were later imple-
 mented and were basic to the "great leap forward."
 Po began by considering the "road to industrialization"
 as laid out by Mao in his "Ten Relationships" speech of April
 1956 and his "contradictions" speech of February 1957.  Po
 summed up the "road" in the current formulation of "simultane-
 ous development of industry and agriculture with priority to
 heavy industry."  He went to some lengths to point out that
 "simultaneous development of agriculture and industry must
 not be considered as opposite and contradictory" to the policy
 of priority to heavy industry.  Nor should it be considered
 that with "prior development of heavy industry there is no
 longer the need of simultaneous development," he said, for
 the two policies were "mutually related."  Po's criticism
 made it appear that the heavy industrial ministries were the
 chief areas where this attitude had to be "rectified."
 Po I-po's earlier silence on the so-called "decentraliza-
 tion" measures ended with this report, and it was apparent that
 he now was  Among  those who favored the "passing down" of author-
 ity that had taken place in November 1957.  Thus one of the
 "chief ways" to implement the "simultaneous development" policy
 was, in Po's words, to "handle properly the relations between
 the central government and the localities, between the coastal
 areas and the hinterlands...Except for making over-all arrange-
 ments and looking into only important economic enterprises,
 the central government should give more economic enterprises
 to the local authorities to rune"  This statement, coming after
 Po's earlier silence and the fait that the November decrees
 had been  restricted almost  entirely to light  industrial

 facilities, suggested that Po might have changed with the wind
 and now was in the position of advocating a further "passing
 down" of authority which heavy industrial circles might not
 find agreeable.
 Po also discussed "the rational use of construction funds."
 A "special suujsct for rectification" was the attitude of economic
 personnel toward the "policy of building the nation with industry
 and thrift."  Po stated,  "Facts have shown that the above-mentioned
 policy is still far from being well-implemented, and great poten-
 tials have been left untapped in capital construction.   Too large
 a scale, too high a target, and an excessive desire for moderni-
 zation have combined to prevent us from tapping these potentials."
 All this was to be "burned out" by "rectification."
 Po then listed 11 points which he estimated would save 20
 percent of capital construction funds if implemented.  All but
 one were familiar rephrasing of prevalent cost-cutting measures.
 Po included such items as "full utilization of existing enter-
 prises" and the medium- and small-plant construction policy, and
 he further endorsed a measure for "boosting" the organizational
 and planning work for capital construction:
 "Some comrades suggest that most of building work be left
 to the local authorities, and that the relevant central
 government departments take charge of only specialized
 large building enterprises and be charged with the respon-
 sibility of balancing and distribution.   I regard this as
 worth considering."
 This suggestion, again, implied an even further "passing
 down" of authority than that implied  in the November decrees,
 and constituted a potentially large contraction of the activi-
 ties of at least two heavy industrial ministries--the Ministry
 of Construction and Engineering and the Ministry of City Con-
 struction.   In this case of construction,   as in the  case
 of the possible "decentralization" of other heavy industry
 above, Po's comments were harbingers of developments of spring-
 summer 1958.
 Po I-po's report included a review of the years 1956-1957
 and attacked the "conservatism" manifested after the "upsurge"
 of 1956.  Po offered a lengthy and almost plaintive description
 of the problem of "conservatism":

 Countless facts prove that if our industrial production
 plans were made a little more advanced, they would better
 be able to bring into play the activism and creativeness
 of the broad working masses, while plans made conservative-
 ly would produce reverse effects.   To this point those in
 charge of our industrial and economic departments should pay
 particular attention.  We all know that the plans mapped out
 by many of our enterprises often exceed those of state plan-
 ning organs and the organs in charge, while those drawn up
 by the workshops and workers often far exceed those set by the
 enterprises.  Naturally such spirit of each surpassing the
 target of the other is very good, normal, compatible with the
 law of economy, and should henceforth be followed.  But as far
 as the responsible departments of industry and economy are con-
 cerned, why cannot they fully estimate the activism and c...:
 creativeness of the masses, why cannot they organize such ac-
 tivism and creativeness in the state plans, and why cannot
 they fully tap what potentials there are in the enterprises
 and have more advanced plans formulated on which to acceler-
 ate the speed of development of our national economy?...Why
 is it often impossible for state planning organs and certain
 responsible departments to set a comparatively higher target?
 There may be various reasons, but the lack of a correct grasp
 of the problem of "balance" and the fear of a possible im-
 balance is one of the major causes.
 This "fear of imbalance" should not exist, said Po, because
 Chairman Mao (in his "contradictions" speech of February 1957)
 had pointed out that such "imbalances" in economic growth, when
 properly handled, resulted in a new "balance" at a more advanced
 level. Po noted that it was "correct" to expect that "out eco-
 nomic and planning personnel" would be people who, when an im-
 balance occurred, wc,uld "push the backward" factors up to the
 level of the "advar~r::ed, " rather than the revrse.
 Po I-po's phrasing of the problem and his outline of the
 "correct" philosophical approach to planning suggested that "con-
 servatism" of this type remained fairly widespread.  A partial
 remedy of the problem was to be attempted in the announcement
 of a "two-target" system of planning in May 1958.   In this sys-
 tem the central government set targets ("number 1") which were
 "reasonable" and "certain to be met"--and which, in all probabili-
 ty, exhibited that "balance" so dear to the hearts of the planners.
 These targets were then sent down to lower levels; these levels
 then would send a second set of targets--categorized as "always

 meeting and usually exceeding" the originals--back up to the
 central government level as the "number 2" targets.   There is
 little information on the extent and operations of this sys-
 tem, and virtually none as to what use the central planners
 found in these "second targets."  The apparent compromise im-
 plicit in the "two-target" system of May 1958, however, sug-
 gests that the type of attitude criticized by Po I-po in De-
 cember still existed five months later.
 In his December report on rectification, Po I-po spoke to
 the "economic and planning" personnel of the regime almost as
 an outsider, one  dissociated from their "errors and short-
 comings."  At the end of his presentation, however, he made a
 comment which seemed more appropriate to his position as a prom-
 inent economic planner:   "We do not intend to negate what we
 have achieved in the past; we want to affirm the success we have
 scored.   Nor do we in-any way regret what we have already done."
 This collective lack of "regret" can be read as a reminder
 to those who had attacked, and were to continue to attack, the
 "retrenchment" of 1957 as "conservatism," that the policies pur-
 sued in that period were for the most part necessary. The gen-
 eral inplication here, as in all other "self-criticisms" voiced
 by the planners themselves, is that while some aspects of "re-
 trenchment" admittedly had been carried too far, the absolute
 need for a "breathing spell" or period of consolidation after
 the "upsurge" of 1956 had been endorsed by Mao himself and re-
 mained a valid proposition.
 During December, Mao Tse-tung (then traveling about China)
 was being associated with the exhorters principally through his
 old comrade Chu Te, who was staging a "leap forward" of his own
 in speech production.   Chu took the most aggressive line of any
 party leader.   He called for maximum effort, for "positiveness"
 instead of stability, for "tense struggle" instead of easy living.
 .He "sternly repudiated" those who questioned this position. Chu
 publicly introduced the term "great leap forward;" in declaring
 that conditions were present for a "great leap forward" in agri-
 culture.
 As of 1,,,',-e December 1957, most of Mao's lieutenants---in-
 cluding most of the economic specialists.--apparently remained in
 agreement that the problems of 1956-57 had been generally resolved
 and that the 1957-58 "upsurge" would have a more firm economic
 foundation than had the upsurge of 1955-56.  There also remained,
 however, a difference in tone between the remarks of an exhorter

 such as Liu Shao-chi or Tan Chen-lin and a technician such as Li
 Fu-chun or Po I-po.  There even remained differences between two
 technicians, e.g. Li and Po. There is a contrast between Li's
 "but" clauses and other cautionary remarks--which seem good mani-
 festations of the "conservative" sense of "balance"--and Po's
 advocacy of more radical changes in economic organization and
 economic "attitudes."   #3 late as April 1958 the press would
 still be harping on the problem of rectifying "negativism" and
 "inactivism," as well as the undue emphasis on "mechanical bal-
 ancing," in Li Fu-chun's National Planning Commission.

 The "Upsurge" Becomes the "Leap," January-February 1958
 People's Dail , official organ of the Chinese Communist
 party central committee, opened the New Year with a bang.   Its
 lead editorial, following Liu Shao-chi's call a month earlier
 for the regime to "forge ahead full steam," was entitled "Full
 Steam Ahead;"  It contended that the rectification campaign
 would release an "immense tide of growth" in industry and agri-
 culture and all kinds of construction, it echoed  Liu's call to
 overtake Great Britain in important sectors in 15 years, and it
 asserted that the party must lead the "unprecedented production
 upsurge" in the countryside.
 Still following Liu's lead, the editorial exhorted the
 faithful to strive in all fields for "revolutionary enthusiasm
 and initiative, and for the elimination of the passive, skep-
 tical, and conservative outlook."  Asserting that the party's
 cause demanded "above all else, revolutionary optimism," the
 editorial concluded grandly:  "Let us ride the Communist wind
 which prevails over rightist, bureaucratic and conservative
 ideas!"
 Probably the most important feature of what People' s Daily
 described as an "unprecedented production upsurge" in the coun-
 tryside was the water-conservancy and irrigation campaign. The
 regime later estimated that 100,000,000 peasants were taking
 part in this campaign in the winter of 1957-58.  This campaign
 seems to have been the area in which and January 1958 the time
 at which the "upsurge" began to be discussed in party councils
 as a nationwide "leap forward."
 The party held a conference during January 1958 at Nanning
 in Kwangsi Province.  The first explicit statement as to the na-
 ture of that conference came only in May 1958, in Liu Shao-chi's
 review.  Liu described it as the first of two conferences di-
 rected to the problem of "combining centralization with decen-
 tralization," work which until then "was being carried out very
 slowly and not at all thorouighly.'-
 Liu's account of the Nanning conference was augmented by
 Ouyang Chin, a provincial party secretary, in a July 1958 ar-
 ticle in Study.  Ouyang noted that the "spirt of the Nanning
 conference" had served "further to emancipate us from ideo-
 logical thralldc   and brought about a new high in the over-all
 leap forward." Since that time, Ouyang said, the party's work

 had assumed a "new look: many things not thought of before have
 appeared; many things that would have taken months or years to
 accomplish have been accomplished in a short time...."
 Ouyang's account specified that Mao Tse-tung at Nanning set
 out "14 points for the formulation of plans for socialist con-
 struction."  Curiously, Liu's May 1958 review does not mention
 Mao's role at Nanning.  The evidence seems to permit only the
 modest conclusion that Mao at Nanning encouraged the "leap" and
 that the conference took an op-~imistic line and discussed a
 number of ideas for making decentralization contribute to the
 achievement of "greater, faster, better, and more economical re-
 sults."
 In the same period, Ko Ching-ship, first secretary of the
 party's Shanghai bureau (with responsibility in economic matters
 for much of East China), was inciting the workers of the area to
 go "higher and higher" in production.  He also spoke to a Shang-
 hai party congress, urging a struggle against "all conservative
 and backward ideas."  Ko, who had earlier reflected the line of
 Mao, Liu Shao-chi, and Teng Hsiao-ping on "rectification," was
 again taking the line that he knew the dominant figures in the
 party to favor.
 The National People's Congress met in February 1958 to hear
 primarily of economic matters and secondarily of foreign affairs.
 The three major speeches were made by Li Hsien-nien, Po I-po,
 and Chou En-lai, in order of appearance.
 Li Hsien-nien reported on the implementation of the 1957
 budget and on the draft budget for 1958.  Considering that 3.957
 had begun as a year of retrenchment, the final results of the
 implementatic? of the budget were, as Li put it, "remarkable
 and encouraging," with both revenue and expenditure excc;eding
 the plan figures and with a surplus of revenue over expenditure.
 Overfulfillment of the plan for revenue and reductions in ex-
 penditures, "thanks to the campaign for increased production
 and practicing economy," had allowed the state to put an addi-
 tional 1.3 billion yuan into appropriations for capital con-
 struction.
 Li repeated the current line that "political work serves
 the economic basis; it is the guarantee of economic work, and
 it is at the same time the commander and soul of economic work
 and all other work."  Li again noted  the "shortcomings'' of

 personnel in financial and economic work.   "When in the winter
 of 1956 we met with temporary local difficulties in the financial
 and economic situation, we made incorrect estimates on certain
 individual questions..but, the central committee of the party
 and Chirman Mao immediately pointed out to us,the correct direc-
 tion..;  they assured us that as long as we persisted in mobil-
 izing the masses in the campaign to increase production and prac-
 tice economy, the difficulties at the time would take a marked
 turn for the better."  Li finished up his consideration of the
 1957 budget with a summary of the truly substantial progress
 made over the previous five years.
 Li then gave an optimistic outline of the tasks of financial
 work in 1958.   He referred to 1958 as a year which would "witness
 the amazing revolutionary power of the great nationwide rec-
 tification:, in all fields."  '.'At present," he said,  "inspired
 by the slogans 'The success of five years is decided by what is
 done in the first three, and that of three years by the first,'
 and 'Fight tenaciously for three years,' the broad masses of
 workers and peasants and the working people as a whole are meet-
 ing the 1958 national plan with unprecedented labor enthusiasm..;
 the whole nation, full of energy and vitality, has been drawn
 into the high tide of emulation where the backward catches up
 with the advanced and the advanced makes further progress...
 Under these circumstances, a new forward leap in the national
 economy is entirely possible in 1958."
 This was the point at which talk about an "upsurge" in 1958
 in economic developments changed consistently to talk about'a "for-
 ward leap," although Chu Te had used the  term  in  December  and
 Po   I-'po  was  later said to have used  the same term, in his
 own December speech.    It was apparent that Li Hsien-nien's usage
 was restricted to the context of the plan budget for 1958.   Li
 described his budget as one which opposed "any tendency toward
 conservatism..and marks a faster rate of increases in revenue
 and expenditure."  This faster rate of increase--and, by implca-
 tion, the "forward leap" envisaged by Li Hsien-nien--was ap-
 proximately 7 percent, as compared with increases of approximately
 3 percent in 1956 and 1957.
 The remainder of Li's report centered on the agricultural
 problem and the virtues of the system of "passing down" authority
 in financial work to local levels.   In agriculture, It said that
 "wee should turn the slack season into a busy one" and observed
 as an illustration of the thesis, that from October 1957 to mid-
 January 1958 "about 100,000,000 peasants in the countryside were
 daily engaged in water-conservancy projects."  While Li noted

 that the state would make a 40 percent increase in state financial
 aid to agriculture over the 1957 figures, he placed more emphasis
 upon the idea that, "provided they are properly used, the peasant
 labor power as an investment, the reserve funds accumulated by
 the cooperatives, an. the active support of the state, these three
 together are fully adequate to settle the problem of funds needed
 for a rapid development of agricultural production."
 Li was enthusiastic about the prospect raised by the regime's
 decision to "improve" financial work by giving more latitude to
 local authorities.  The "overcentralization", of earlier years had
 been "correct and necessary," but succeeding changes in the eco-
 nomic situation of China now made it "necessary anc possible to
 change the past system of financial management...to extend suit-
 ably the powers and responsibilities of the local authorities in
 financial management, and, under the premise of ensuring progress
 of the country's key projects, to add to the financial resources
 at the disposal of the local authorities."
 These measures were essentially the November 1957 decrees--
 with the modification, suggested by Li, that the local budgets
 should be fixed for five years after "clarification" instead of
 three.   A similar extension period for the enterprise's profit-
 sharing plan was also suggested.   It is apparent from Li's remarks
 that the "passing down" of authority was intended not as a transient
 phenomenon but as a major modification of the economic system, which
 was designed, as Li put it,  "to help better bring into play the ac-
 tivity and initiative of local authorities."
 While Li Hsien-nien's view of 1958 was cautiously optimistic
 and postulated a "great upsurge" as entirely possible," Po I-pots
 comments on the 1958 economic plan indicated that it  was already
 well under way.  Po summarized 1957 as a year of "great victories"
 on many fronts.   It had been a "good year," with overfulf illment
 of capital construction by 6 percent, 7-percent increases in total
 value of industrial output and a 3.5-percent increase in agricul-
 tural production.  However, economic achievements were not empha-
 sized in Pots list of "great victories."
 The "high tide for full   ring of views," which had begun
 in the "last quarter" of 1957, had brought "socialist education"
 to all Citnrse workers.   "Since then," said Pv,  "the sense of
 responsibi:.`  of the working class as the leading class of the
 state has bsote.. greatly enhanced."  The "sense of responsibility"
 had caused widespread reviews of the "working styles" of cadres,

 as well as the elimination of much "absenteeism" and other sources
 of waste.   "This,"" said Po, "has changed the face of many enter-
 prises and capital construction projects and has brought about a
 new upsurge in production and construction on the industrial
 front."
 In agriculture, the revised draft program for agriculture
 and the water-conservancy and irrigation campaign had "givon rise
 to a new upsurge in agricultural production-which is even
 greater in scope than that of the winter 1955-1956."  Further,
 said Po, "Upsurges, and in particular the leap forward of 1956,"
 were necessary to overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan.
 Po characterized the development of China's economy as one
 which had had some "twists and turns."  These had been overcome
 because of the leadership of the central committee and Comrade
 Mao.   Po did not linger over the ""inappropriate appraisals" made
 in son.e aspects of financial and economic work which Li Hsien-nien
 had cited in his report.
 Po began his consideration of the 1958 plan with the exhorta-
 tion to "strive for a new forward leap" in 1958.   In answer to the
 theoretical question as to whether it was "possible," Po cited as
 "favorable factors" all the campaigns and s:Logans that Li Hsien-
 nien had mentioned, plus the "policy of developing industry and
 agriculture simultaneously, with priority to heavy industry."   Pc
 rhapsodized about these factors and concluded that the "current
 upsurge in production and construction in agriculture is certain,
 in particular, to bring about a new upsurge in industrial produc-
 tion."
 Among the more concrete factors favoring the "upsurge" was
 the "improvement in the system of administration" which, Po noted,
 accomplished two things:  first, in the localities, "more decisive
 efforts" could be made in utilizing local labor and resources and
 in "discovering various local potential forces;" second, the
 "central authorities will be able to concentrate their efforts
 to a st!11 greater extent" on key projects and over-all develop-
 ment.   Po I-po stated that from these factors and from develop-
 ments in the "first two months of 1958...we can see that the
 trend for a new forward leap in the national economy this ;ear
 has already become evident.
 The goals for 1958 outlined by Po were reasonable and were
 more i.n the nature of a large step than a "leap forward."  Capital

 construction investment was planned to increase 17 percent over
 the 1957 figure, agricultural production 6 percent, and the value
 of industrial output 14.6 percent. Po di,'d note, however, that "it
 should be foreseen that the potentialities of local industries are
 very big and that, therefore this industrial target may be greatly
 surpassed."  Po's figures were probably those set by the planning,
 conference of December 1957.
 Po devoted only a small portion of his report to "decentral-
 ization," but his treatment of "small- and medium-scale industrial
 construction" apparently assumed that the further "decentraliza-
 tion" he had advocated in December 1957 was to be implemented. Po
 cited the importance of "local, small, and medium" industrial con-
 struction in each of his sections on the 1958 plan for metallurgical,
 electric power, chemical, and building-materials industries. Much
 as he had assigned the construction of "small- and medium-scale
 industry" to local authorities, Po assigned the construction of
 "small-scale" water conservancy and irrigation projects to "indi-
 vidual agricultural producer cooperatives," "medium-scale" projects
 to "several cooperatives jointly,"  and "large-scale" projects ex-
 clusively to central government construction.
 Po foresaw "a great possibility that the (1958) plan for in-
 creasing production will be overfulfilled and that financial in-
 come will be increased more than originally planned."  Therefore,
 he said, "we have drawn up a waiting list of capital construction
 items" so that "when the state has finances and  -tterials to
 spare," the "waiting" projects could be undertaken.
 Po expanded and elaborated on his point of December that the
 leadership must "stand in front of the movement, relying fully upon
 the masses," and must "gather the opinions of the masses, amend
 and supplement plans on  the basis of the opinions of the masses,
 and make the plans more progressive and more effective in mobil-
 izing the masses."  Even more strongly than in December, Po I-po
 attacked the adherents of "balances" in economic development and
 repeated his earlier statement that "our personnel in economic
 work should become promoters of progress for socialist construc-
 tion and must not become either promoters of regression or promot-
 ers of the status quo."  He illustrated the intimate relationship
 between "progressive" economic planners and the "masses" by noting
 that "the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production since
 last autumn has further proved that, in Implementing any kind of
 economic plan, the targets originally considered as advanced be-
 come backw -d after the plan is put before the masses for discus-
 sion..."

 This was precisely the process by which the incredible
 targets which marked the "great leap forward" were later gen-
 erated.  Even Po I-po, maintaining a substantially more ad-
 vanced position on the possibilities of a "leap forward" than
 other economic specialists, did not, and probably could not,
 predict the heights which the "great leap forward" of 1958 was
 to attain.
 Chou En-lai followed Li Hsien-nien and Po I-po in reporting
 to the NPC in February.  He adapted himself easily to the pre-
 v;:lling wind.   Rectification had led to "great forward leaps" in
 construction. The noble spirit of socialism had conquered the
 "noxious spirit of capitalism" that for a time in 1957 had "run
 riot."  China "rides the rising tide; it is driving full steam
 ahead...."  However, Chou's report was almost entirely on foreign
 affairs.
 Throughout February,  People's Dail , which can generally be
 assumed to reflect Mao Tse-tung's pos t on, encouraged a "leap
 forward." One editorial discussed the need to defeat conserva-
 tive thinking in agricultural production.   It observed that "a
 plan which can be achieved without much effo',t certainly cannot
 be called well-founded," and it called for achievj.ng ten-year
 goals in five to eight years.  Another hailed a provincial party
 congress for criticizing the "conservative idea of striving al-
 ternately for progress and consolidation"--an idea which repre-'
 sented "a lack of revolutionary spirit and  enthusiaew..i.,!',  The
 "backward" idea under attack also represented the party's own
 course in 1955-56 (progress) and in 1956-57 (consolidation)...

 The "Leap" Leaps, March-April 1958
 On the last day of February 1958, People's Daily set the
 tone for the succeeding two months before the -convocation of
 the second session of the Communist party's Eighth Congress,
 to be held the first week of May. The editorial urged , the "up-
 set of old targets" and the transformation of "balances into
 imbalances."  Addressing the economic planners and the entire
 people, the paper urged them to "free ourselves from the ideol- 25X1
 ogical bondage of that vulgar theory of balances and courage-
 ously take a leap forward."
 At about this time, the Communist party held its second
 party conference in three months.  Like the Nanning conference
 in January, the March meeting was held in a provincial capital--
 this time in Chengtu, in Szechuan Province, the most'populous in
 China.   The first secretary of the party machine in Szechuan, Li
 Ching-chuan, was in effect the host for this conference.
 The Chengtu conference was later described as having been
 convened by the "central committee and Chairman Mao" and as
 having brought together "responsible comrades of provincial and
 municipal party organs and of the concerned departments of the
 central government."  Like the one at Nanning,  `he Chengtu con-
 ference was evidently concerned with making the decentralization
 policy contribute to the "leap forward."

 It was at the Chengtu conference, according to later ac-
 counts in party journals, that the party adopted the "new policy
 of simultaneous  development of central and local industry," and
 its corollary, the "double-track planning control system."  The
 latter nominally enhanced the coordination between central and
 local planning.
 The Chengtu conference evidently discussed the prospects
 for the "leap."   Tan Chen-lin, writing in Red Flag several months
 later, observed that it was estimated at C engfu-=presumably by
 the most optimistic--that the regime could achieve an increase
 in grain production of 20 percent,  but "some expressed their
 doubt, feeling that the best we could do was 15 percent."
 Mao Tse-tung's personal role at Chengtu was touched on,
 probably in a misleading way, by Tan.  According to Tan, "Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung at the conference in Chengtu told the people
 there that they should work hard, but they should also take a
 rest."  Tan went on to allege that party cadres could not pre-
 vail on the peasants to rest, "because they want to compete with
 one another..."  There seems little doubt that Mao's emphasis,
 and the emphasis of the Chengtu conference, was on competition
 rather than rest.
 The party cadres, possibly with the help of some unpubli-
 cized directives, soon got the message of the Chengtu conference.
 The speed of their response was indicated by a mid-March asser-
 tion, carried by Radio Peiping, that industrial output might
 rise  by 33 percent in 1958--more than double the rate ap-
 proved by the National People's Congress a month earlier.
 Throughout March, "upsurge" and "struggle" meetings roared
 through the country.  There were waves of progressively higher
 "struggle" goals in industry and in health, education, and cul-
 ture.                         Construction schedules were greatly advanced, and a num-
 ber of industries pledged themselves to overtake Britain in five
 to ten years instead of 15.   The "overwhelming majority" of coun-
 ties decided to fulfill five years ahead of schedule the main
 targets of the 12-year agricultural development program.  An of-
 ficial of the Ministry of Agriculture said that China's agricul-
 tural output could rise by more than 20 percent a year.
 It was occasionally conceded that not everyone shared these
 sanguine predictions.  Almost the only official recognition that
 the cadres were being overzealous, however, was contained in a

 People's Daily editorial of 7 April..   The editorial referred to
 the   me  h  d of work which relies on increasing the intensity of
 labor and prolonging work hours.  While occasional adoption of
 this method for the sake of shock fulfillment of certain emer-
 gency tasks may be excusable, this is not the method which we
 should promote for adoption."  The point of this passage--that
 the "leap forward" was intended to be not a "shook" campaign
 but a long-term effort--was lost in the welter of reports of
 the adoption of new and often incredible targets.
 The State Council met on 11 April.   Its agenda noted that
 the Communist party central committee and the State Council had
 Jointly made a "decision on the transfer of industries and enter-
 prises."  This was a formal announcement of the decision further
 to "decentralize" which had been taken at Chengtu in March.  The
 actual transfer was to be "gradual" and was to include all state-
 owned enterprises "except a few special and experimental ones."
 By June 1958, the regime could announce that 80 percent of the
 enterprises "previously controlled by the various industrial min-
 istries" had been "handed over" to the local authorities, includ-
 ing virtually all enterprises formerly under the textile and
 light industrial ministries, and,  "except for a small number of
 very large, special, or experimental enterprises, all enterprises
 under the ministries of heavy industry...."
 The State Statistical Bureau on 14 April released the f fig-
 ures for the first quarter of 1958.   It called them "unprece-
 dented." and proof "of the complete truth of the slogan  'pol-
 itics is the guide."'  The bureau's figures for the first quar-
 ter of 1958 had an illusory glitter, as they were compared with
 the first quarter of a very slow year--1957--rather than with
 the first "upsurge" year of 1956.   In addition, little emphasis
 was placed on the fact that the scope of the 1958 plan was sub-
 stantially larger than that of 1957.  Nevertheless, various
 estimates--that total industrial output in the first quarter
 had fulfilled more than 25 percent of the annual plan as against
 the average 23 percent fulfillment of previous years, that cen-
 tral government industrial output was 26.6 percent above that
 of the first quarter of 1957, that local government industrial
 output was up 19.1 percent, and that the increase in value of
 fixed assets was 35 percent more than that of the first quarter
 of 1957--provided statistical fuel for stoking the fire of the
 "leap forward."

 People's Daily, reviewing the events of the past few months,
 on 27 April summed up the situation in the following words:  "The
 problem now confronting us is to follow up the achievements
 made during the past several months and to continue our efforts
 to fulfill the plan for a great forward leap this year."  This
 problem of evaluating  the "leap" was to be the chief concern
 of the second session of the Communist party's Eighth Congress,
 which opened in Peiping on 5 May.
 The party's economic specialists were silent during the
 leaping of the "leap" in March and April 1958.   This in itself
 is not impressive evidence that they were out of sympathy with
 the way in which the "leap" was being managed, as there were no
 major pronouncements on economic matters in this period by party
 leaders of any type.  However, some of the leaders--including
 Mao, Liu, and Chou--were reported as encouraging the "leap" in
 various ways at various points in their travels.  Some others,
 including Lu Ting-i and Chen Po-ta, both spokesmen for Mao,
 wrote articles encouraging the "leap" in political matters.  It
 is of some interest, at least, that the economic specialists in
 this period did not find occasion to associate themselves pub-
 licly with the leap's headlong course.
 In the period before the party congress, party leaders were
 deciding upon a number of personnel changes: these were an-
 nounced during and immediately after the congress.  Some of
 these changes represented demotions, and some of these demotions
 were for opposing, or for failing to support strongly enough,
 the "leap forward."  Party leaders in 11 provinces were demoted,
 including three alternate members of the Communist party cen-
 tral committee.  one of these three was expressly accused of
 dragging his feet in the "leap."
 The more important personnel changes--not announced) until
 May--affected the party's politburo and secretariat.  Three men
 were selected to join the politburo, each as a full member.
 They were:  So Ching-shih, first secretary of the party's
 Shanghai bureau, who had been active in both the "rectification"
 campaign and the "leap forward"; Li Ching-chuan, the party's
 first secretary in Szechuan, who had been the host to tho Cheng-
 tu conference; and Tan Chen-lin, who -'had  emerged  as  the
 party's principal spokesman on agriculture and rural work.
 Bo. Li, and Tan seemed to be close to Mao Tse-tung and the
 "party machine" leaders, Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping. Ko
 and Li were among Mao's few traveling c4rapanions in March and

 April; Tan, out of the news in this period and presumably pre-
 paring his report for the coming congress, had begun his career
 as a protege of Mao's. Similarly, Ko and Li had the most impor-
 tant regional posts in the party machine directed by Liu and Teng.
 Li had been one of Teng's lieutenants in the southwest, and Tan
 had been one of Teng's deputies in the secretariat for three
 years.  The selection of these three men for the politburo
 seemed to illustrate the continuing domination of the party by
 Mao and his "party-machine" lieutenants, and the importance of
 the regional and provincial administrations in their plans for
 the "leap."
 Two of the party's economic specialists--Li Fu-chun and Li
 Hsien-nien--were selected to join the party secretariat under
 Teng Hsiao-ping.  They apparently'were selected to improve the
 secretariat's capabilities for supervising and coordinating the
 party's complex work in their fields of long-range planning  (Li
 Fu-chun) and finance, commerce, and trade (Li Hcien-nien). The
 secretariat already had Tan Chen-lin to coordinate the party's
 work in agriculture, and Li Hsueh-fang to coordinate party work
 in industry and communications.
 The three appointments to the politburo seemed to reflect
 the influence of those who had been foremost among the exhorters
 in the development of the "leap," but this is not to say that
 they were selected in order to strengthen the position of the
 exhorters in a struggle with the administrators and economic
 specialists.  If the latter had been the primary motive, the
 "party machine" leaders would not have simultaneously approved
 the addition of two of the most important economic specialists
 to the secretariat which would implement the politburo's policies.
 The simplistic explanation would seem further discredited
 by the failure of the party leaders to advance Po I-po.  Although
 Po had become one of the exhorters, he remained an alternate mem-
 ber of the politburo and was not added to the secretariat.
 In any case, whatever "struggle" there may have been between
 the exhorters and the technicians seems to have been resolved in
 the exhorters' favor at the Chengtu conference in March. As
 disciplined Communists and long-time comrades, Li Fu-chun and
 Li Hsien-nien could reasonably be expected to do their best to
 implement the party's "general line," even if known to disap-
 prove of certain features of it.  On the other hand, assuming
 that the two Li's had been among those at Chengtu who expressed
 reservations about the "leap," they could be expected to retain
 those feelings until persuaded by events.

 The "Leap" Dominates the Party Congress, Ma  1958
 The party's preoccupation with the "leap forward" seems
 to have been primarily responsible for the postponement of
 the second session of the party's eighth congress, which
 should have been convened during 1957, until May 1958.   The
 session immediately followed the fourth plenum of the eighth
 central committee, which adopted the reports to be made to
 the congress.
 Mao Tse-tung,  Liu Shao-chi,  Chou En-lai, Chen Yun,
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Li Asien-nien,     Po I-po, and Tan Chen-lin
 were among those cited by Peiping as speaking to "plenary
 meetings" of the congress.   The three major reports were
 delivered by Liu Shao-chi, on the work of the party central
 committee; by Teng Hsiao-ping, on intrabloc relations; and
 by Tan Chen-lin, on the development of agriculture.  The
 reports of Liu and Tan--both concerned primarily with economic
 policies--were the only '.texts released by Peiping.
 Liu Shao-chi began his long report with a review of
 the world scene in terms of Mao-s proposition, stated in
 Moscow the previous November, that "the east wind has pre-
 vailed over the west wing."   He hailed the results of "rec-
 tification" in China and observed that the campaign had
 "brought about a new upsurge in production and construction"
 throughout the country.   This "great revolutionary drive,"
 said Liu, was in accordance with Mao's call for overtaking
 Britain in 15 years and for "pressing ahead consistently to
 achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results."
 (In fact, neither of these calls had been attributed to Mao
 when they first appeared.)
 Liu then reviewed briefly the "leap forward," which he
 dated from earl; 1958.   He offered statistics on the regime's
 accomplishments, dating from the formation of immense labor
 corvdes in irrigation work the previous autumn, to illustrate
 the truth of Marx's alleged prophesy (taken out of context)
 that 20 years could be concentrated in one day.   Liu then
 reconstructed the development of the party's "general line"
 --a line identical with Mao's alleged insistence on "pressing
 ahead consistently to achieve greater, faster, better, and
 more economical results."

 Liu asserted that Mao had always favored the current
 general line.   He pointed to Mao's decision in 1955 to
 speed the socialization of agriculture.   He then noted,
 truthfully, that there had been some opposition to Mao's
 policy at that time.   The opposition took the view that
 "'keeping to the right is better than keeping to the left,'
 or  'it is better to go slower than faster," and so on.
 Liu went on to assert that in the winter of 1955-56,
 "when it was apparent that a decisive victory over the
 ownership of the means of production was to be achieved very
 shortly... and when a mass upsurge in production and con-
 struction was beginning to take place, the norms set in
 the First Five-Year Plan should have been revised upward."
 Liu's statement of the case clearly implied that the party's
 planning at that time had been dominated by conservative
 forces--which had in fact been attacked by Mao in December
 1955.   Planning had in fact become more ambitious shortly
 after Mao had made clear his position.
 Then in April 1956, according to Liu, Mao had "out-
 lined a series of important policies" in his speech on the
 "ten relationships."  The "general idea" of Mao.'s report,
 Liu said, was "to mobilize all positive factors and avail-
 able forces for building China into a modern, prosperous,
 and mighty socialist state in the shortest possible time."
 As Mao's April 1956 speech had never been published,
 it could not reasonably be cited in support of the proposi-
 tion that Mao had unswervingly supported a "leap forward"
 program.   As noted earlier, the truth seems to be that Mao,
 while temperamentally disposed to favor a bold course, was
 more cautious in April 1956 than he had been in the last
 half of 1955-..at least in the sense of permitting a period
 .of re-examination which was welcomed by the economic spec-
 ialists.
 Liu's report asserted that in 1956 "every phase of
 China's economy and culture made a mighty leap forward."
 While there had been "individual defects in our work" in
 1956, "these defects paled before the tremendous achieve-
 ments" of that year.   "Some comrades," however, had "under-
 estimated the great achievements...and hence regarded the
 leap forward of 1956 as a 'reckless advance'..."  Further,
 said Liu,  "some people" had even questioned the principle--

 which became the "general line" of 1958--of "achieving great-
 er, faster, better, and more economical results," and were
 also doubtful of the program for agricultural development.
 This opposition to Mao's alleged position had "dampened
 the initiative of the masses and hampered progress on the
 production front in 1957--particularly on the agricultural
 front."
 Liu added that the party hpd "soon corrected this error"
 --the error of equating a "leap" with a "reckless advance."
 The "soon" in Liu's account was September 1957, the date of
 the third plenum of the Chinese Communist party central com-
 mittee.   In other words, economic planning had been dominated
 by the moderates from autumn 1956 through summer 1957.   The
 record Indicates that this was true.   What Liu did not say
 was that Mao himself had apparently, for good reasons, favored
 the moderates in this period.
 Liu contended correctly that the September 1957 plenum
 had affirmed the "general line" of 1958--that is, that it
 was dominated by those, including Mao, who foresaw an: "up-
 surge."  The record suggests that most of the economic spec-
 ialists also agreed at that time that the problems of 1956
 had in general been solved and that rapid progress was pos-
 sible.
 Liu noted with satisfaction that progress since autumn
 1957 had concerted "many of those comrades who expressed
 misgivings" about the general line.   However, said Liu,  "some
 of them have not yet learned anything.   They say:   'We will
 settle accounts with you after the autumn harvest."'  In
 other words, some part of the moderate forces remained mod-
 erates and were predicting that the year-end figures would
 vindicate them.
 Liu described the course of economic development since
 1955 as "U-shaped"--an "upsurge" in 1956, an "ebt." in 1957,
 and "an even bigger upsurge" in 1958.   The party had "learned
 a lesson" from the U-shaped development:   that it should
 not permit the sag in the diddle but should hold to the
 "Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution."  The
 central committee and Mao had "always" held to this principle.
 Liu did not see fit to recall that the central committee it-
 self had proclaimed the shift fro-a "anticonservatism" to a

 position midway between "conservatism" and "adventurism" in
 September 1956, and that on at least three occasions in the
 following seven months Mao had endorsed the moderate position.
 Liu then stated the "basic points of our general line."
 Whereas he had gone to great lengths to prove the a .priori
 wisdom of Mao and the central committee, Liu's introductory
 sentence revealed the true empirical development of the line.
 The line had been formulated, he said, "in the light of prac-
 tical experience...and of the development of Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung's thinking in the past few years..." The "basic points"
 were:
 To mobilize all positive factors and correctly
 handle contradictions among the people;
 To consolidate and develop socialist ownershi)--
 that is, owneruhip by the whole people and collective
 ownership--and to consolidate the proletarian dictator-
 ship and proletarian international solidarity;
 To carry out a technological and a cultural revolu-
 tion step by step, while completing the socialist revolu-
 tion on the economic, political, and ideological fronts;
 To develop industry and agriculture simultaneously
 while giving priority to heavy industry; and
 With -centralized leadership, over-all, planning,
 proper division of labor and coord nation, to develop
 national and local industries, and large-, small-, and
 medium-size enterprises simultaneously.
 Liu's formulation provided the regime with a program for
 the entire economy which was a vehicle, as had been the 12-
 year program for agriculture, for political work throughout
 China.  The promulgation of the line also helped to fill the
 gap left by the continued absence of a second five-year plan.
 Liu then turned again to the opposition.  Asserting
 that the "spe&J of construction has been the most important
 question confronting us," he noted that "some people" do
 not   recognize the Importance of increasing the pace, do
 not approve of the general line; and have "raised various
 objections."  Some feared the toll of such a pace on the
 populace, some  foresaw  much  ;waste- resulting from such
 speed, and others were concerned about the development of
 "imbalances."  Further, "some comrades" feared the diver-
 sion of funds from industry to agriculture, and "some peo-
 ple" doubted that agriculture could advance very rapidly

 under any conditions.   Liu polemically refuted "some scholars"
 who contended that agricultural growth could not keep pace
 with that of the population.
 Liu defined the present tasks of the party as continuing
 to resolve "contradictions among the people," strengthening
 the work of party organizations at all levels, and working
 hard to implement the general line for "socialist construc-
 tion."   He specified that the "most important task" in im-
 proving the work of the state was to work out decentrali na-
 tion.
 Liu termed 1958 the first of three years of "hard struggle."
 He asked for a maximum effort in 1958, partly because "every-
 body is watching"--presumably including the moderates whom
 he had earlier denounced.   In a rare  note of caution, Liu
 told the cadres to combine "revolutionary enthusiacm with
 businesslike sense," not to indulge in "empty talk," but  to
 set forth targets that "can be reached with hard work."   Liu
 noted that obviously unattainable targets would "dampen the
 enthusiasm of the masses and delight the conservatives."
 Liu saw the "guarantee of ouccess" as the pu&rty's "cor-
 rect leadership" of the leap.   In other words, party com-
 mittes "at all levels" must set objectives for,  and supervise
 the work of, government organs.   Liu observed ominously that
 "both inside and outside the party, there is a mistakE-i ten-
 dency...to think that the party cannot lead construction work,
 or work in the fields of science and technology, culture,  and
 education."  Liu added, characteristically,  "Ideological and
 political work is always the soul and guide of every kind of
 work."
 Liu concluded his report with a call for "a host of
 people rho think,  speak, and act with courage and daring,"
 who will "conquer ever new positions for the truth."  A par-
 ty                              theorist   later  wrote  that  this call  had  originated
 with  Mao  Tse-tung,., in  his  unpublished  remarks to  the
 congress.
 Tan Chen-lin's report on the second revised draft of
 the 12-year program for agriculture was cut out of the same
 cloth as Liu Shao-chi's report.   tan repeated Liu-'s condemna-
 tion of those who had "cast doubts" on the achievements of
 1956, Liu's defiance of those "comrades" who waited to "settle

 accounts" in the fall, and Liu's description of the "U-shaped
 curve" of development--a "bad thing."  While Tan was as ag-
 gressively optimistic as ever, he dealt more fully with the
 necessity for avoiding "flashy results" and for working in
 "a practical way," and he gave greater allowance to the poten-
 tial dangers of weather to agriculture.
 The burden of Tan's report was concerned with the pos-
 sibility of carrying out the twelve-year program "aheaa of
 schedule."   The "new upsurge in agriculture" made further
 amendments to the program "necessary."  The yield target
 of "40 catties" per mow for cotton, which had been added
 in the first revision of 1957, now was dropped, and the
 yield of "60 catties " from the original program of January
 1956 was restored.   As the program had formerly read, the
 various yield and production targets appeared to be intended
 as ceiling figures which should not be exceeded.   The new
 draft graciously  corrected  that  impression:    As -- Tan put it,  "We hold that...the various provinces, municipalities,
 and autonomous regions are completely free to set up targets
 that will fulfill and overfulfill the program ahead of time."
 Tan also endorsed the addition "of close planting,"
 because it,  "like other advanced measures for increasing pro-
 duction, has often encountered resistance from conservative
 and backward ideas,"   Similarly,  the program now "stressed
 the building of small-scale irrigation works" by the agricul-
 tural producers' coop-ratives.   Tan's comment on the re-
 drafting of the old article on "mechanization and electrifica-
 tion" was in effect a summary of the new version of the 12-
 year program:
 The new version reflects the great mass movement...
 now going on in the country; it takes into account the
 possibility that semi-mechanization and mechanization
 of agriculture may be realized through the expansion
 of small-scale local industries and by reliance on the
 funds accumulated by the agricultural cooperatives;
 it stresses the practical significance of the drive
 to improve farm implements, and it makes the point
 that the budding technical revolution in agriculture
 is a steppingstone to semi-mechanization and mechani-
 zation.
 The third major report to the congress, that of Teng
 Hsiao-ping, was not released.   Peiping's brief summary of the
 SECRET

 SECRET
 report indicated that it was concerned primarily with the
 "fallacies of modern revisionism" as embodied in the Yugoslav
 party program.   To the extent that Teng may have discussed
 domestic developments in China, it can fairly be assumed that
 he took the same line as Liu and Tan.   In autumn 1957, Teng
 had been prominent among the exhorters to a new "upsurge."
 The congress was immediately followed by the fifth
 plenum of the central committee, which announced the decision
 to add three party leaders to the politburo and two--each
 already a member of the politburo--to the secretariat.   As
 noted earlier,  the three new politburo members appeared to
 be persons close to Mao and to "party machine" leaders Liu
 Shao-chi and Tong Hsiao-ping, while the two new secretaries
 were economic specialists who seemed closer to Chou En-lai.
 The proceedings of the May 1958 party congress left a
 powerful impression of the strength of the "exhorters."  The
 three major speakers--certainly selected by Mao--were the
 three principal leaders of the exhorters.  The content of
 their speeches--the two publishes, at any rate--was the line
 which the exhorters had been publicly pressing since the
 previous autumn.   The only speeches published or summarized
 were the reports of these three exhorters. Of the three
 new politburo members,  at ~ least- two were:eexhortei7s ? (Ko
 and Tari);.and  all three were close to other exhorters.
 Whereas the proceedings of the party congress of
 September 1956 had been open, those of the May 1958 con-
 gress were virtually closed.  This feature made it difficult
 to evaluate the views of individual leaders on the contro-
 versial policies associated with the "leap forward," but
 at the same time it supported the view that there remained
 a substantial body of opposition to the exhorters.   In other
 words, it seems likely that Liu Shao-chi and Tan Chen-lin
 in their reports to the congress were not simply flailing
 a straw man but were directing their attack against other
 party leaders.   Further, this latter group was apparently
 being warned that Mao Tse-tung, who had supported the moder-
 ates in the autumn 1956 - summer 1957 period, had favored
 the exhorters since September 1957 and continued to do so.
 The drive for a "great leap forward" in economic de-
 velopment increased in tempo after the May congress.  Tar-
 gets were raised one after another, and hundreds of thousands
 of small and primitive industrial facilities mushroomed
 throughout China.   There was further decentralization, with
 much capital construction activity devolving on local author-
 ities and adjustments made in the collecting of agricultural

 IV.  THE POSITIONS OF PARTY LEADERS
 Mao and the "First Upsurge," 1955-56
 Mao Tse-tung was clearly the driving force behind the
 "first upsurge" of 1955-56.   It was Mao who personally re-
 versed, in July 1955, the party's gradualist approach to
 the socialization of agriculture.   It was a spokesman for
 Mao, the theorist Chen Po-ta, who publicly "explained" the
 new policy when the central committee endorsed it in October.
 It was Mao again, in December 1955, who urged that the trans-
 formation of capitalist industry and commerce likewise be
 speeded.   In the same month, it was Mao who asserted that
 the tempo of industrialization, as well as the development
 of science, education, and public health, should be acceler-
 ated.'  It was again Mao, also in December 1955, who defined
 the basic economic problem as that of combating "rightist
 conservatism" in production and construction.  In January
 1956  it was Mao who convened a Supreme State Conference to
 discuss the party's very ambitious program for agriculture.
 It was Mao's spokesman Chen Po-ta who in February 1956 as-
 serted that grain output could be doubled in 12 years and that
 China could feed twice its present population.
 Throughout that period other party leaders simply fol-
 lowed Mao's lead.   In order to do so, some of them--including
 Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, and Li Fu-chun--had to reverse
 themselves.   Some of them, notably Teng Tzu-hui, did not
 choose to reverse themselves or were unsuccessful in:doing
 so, and consequently declined in power.   In sam,   there was
 just one clear position--Mao's position; host other leaders
 prudently made it their own.
 The "socialist transformation" of the countryside and
 its rapid extension to urban industrial areas, together with
 Mao's insistence on combating "conservatism" in production and
 construction, gave the party a complex of problems.  The most
 important of these seemed to be how best to make the party's
 increased control of Chinese society speed the rate of eco-
 nomic growth,
 In his speech in April 1956 on the "ten relationships,"
 Mao apparently outlined in general terms the problems--or as-
 pects of the principal problem--whi^h remained to be solved.
 There is little or no evidence that Mao himself., supplied - ,the
 answers.

 In the spring of 1956 Mao apparently gave the senior gov-
 ernment administrators and economic specialists--Chou En-lai,
 Chen Yun, Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien, Po I-po, Teng Tzu-hui and
 Chia To-fu--the primary responsibility for devising measures
 to increase the regime's rate of economic growth.  Those "par-
 ty-machine" leaders who later appeared in the role of exhorters
 were not pro:,inent in economic affairs in the spring and sum-
 mer of 1956.
 All of the administrators and economists, and in particular
 Po and Teng, seemed to have a strong sense of difficulties.
 Most of them favored greater individual incentives to increase
 the rate of econoilic growth.
 By June 1956 it was apparent that the party was consider-
 ing several important new measures.  Chief among these was
 decentralization of the government--a plan with which Chou En-
 lai was identified.   Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien,  and Chia To-
 fu publicly agreed that organs of government below the na-
 tional level could profitably be given greater power.
 The regime was also considering how to deal with previous-
 ly neglected enterprises located for the most part in coastal
 areas.   Li Fu-chun and Po I-po publicly acknowledged the pos-
 sibility that these enterprises could provide substantial in-
 crements of production and a minimum of time and investment.
 Another measure, being considered by Chia To-fu and prob-
 ably other planners, was the building of "small- and-medium-
 size" plants.  The thought was that these plants might be in-
 expensively financed and simply equipped from domestic re-
 sources,  and that they could rely heavily on manpower.
 The self-criticism of Li Fu-chun and Po I-po in the sum-
 mer of 1956--relating to "subjective neglect of coastal in-
 dustry" and construction on "too big and too modern" a scale--
 suggested that Mao Tse-tung had already spoken (in the April
 speech) in favor of at least two of the new measures.  The
 self-criticism was also an indirect criticism of the Soviet
 advisors who had helped to draw up the First Five-Year Plan.
 The proposed new measures constituted a Chinese variation on
 Soviet theories of economic development.

 The Moderates and the "Ebb Tide,"  1956-57
 Prior to the party's eighth congress in September 1956,
 it was apparent that the "upsurge" had generally been a suc-
 cess, but that attendant problems and natural calamities would
 force a downward revision of planned goals.   During the Sep-
 tember congress the party leadership officially abandoned the
 emphasis of early 1956 on the need to combat "rightist con-
 servatism."  The party was henceforth to steer a course be-
 tween conservatism on the one hand and "leftist adventurism"
 on the other.
 Both Liu Shao-chi, who made the principal report to the
 congress, and Chou En-lai, who presented the comparatively
 realistic Second Five-Year Plan, associated themselves with
 this more nearly moderate position.  Chou gave more attention
 than Liu to "shortcomings and mistakes" in economic planning
 in 1955-56.
 Liu, Chou, and other leaders who made lesser reports to
 the congress provided evidence that the period of reassess-
 ment of the party's course--the period initiated by Mao in
 April--had not ended, and that debate was still lively.  Among
 the questions apparently at issue were the respective rates of
 development of heavy and light industry, the merits of large-
 plant versus small-plant construction, the feasibility of build-
 ing an antonomous industrial system, the degree to which pri-
 vate enterprise would be tolerated, the ratio between accumula-
 tion and consumption, and methods of increasing agricultural
 output.
 The eighth congress brought into the party politburo three
 of the four ranking economic specialists below Chen Yun, a po-
 litburo member for many years.  Two of these, Li Fu-chun and
 Li Hsien-nien, were named full (voting) members.  The third,
 Po I-po, was named an alternate (nonvoting) member.  Teng Tzu-
 hui, a spokesman for the opposition to Mao's acceleration of
 agricultural socialization in 1955-56, was passed over.
 The Chinese Communist party central committee met in
 plenary session only a few weeks after the party congress
 closed.  The communique of this plenum indicated that the eco-
 nomic problems mentioned at the congress: had become the party's
 principal concern.  The party endorsed Chou En-lai's call for
 a "suitable retrenchment" in 1957, and Mao Tse-tung himself was
 said to !,.ave expressed "full endorsement" of this course.

 The party made a number of changes in the government's
 planning organs in late 1956. At the same time, Chen Yun
 apparently assumed responsibility for the implementation of
 a policy with which he had been identified, that of the
 limited "free market."
 As 1957 opened, the regime was pushing its campaign for
 austerity and economy and was also permitting the publication
 of articles advocating a very moderate approach to economic
 development.  A major theme of these articles was the need
 for "balanced, proportionate development" of the economy.
 The regime was apparently encouraging a shift away from an
 obsessive concern with heavy industrial development.
 In the early months of 1957, several party leaders under-
 lined the need for a retrenchment.  Mao Tse-tung, in his
 "contradictions" speech in February, gave sanction to contin-
 uing the period of re-examination of economic policies, and
 he criticized those who failed to consider all possible
 proposals.   He may also have declared himself in favor of an
 increased emphasis on agricultural development..
 In the same period, three prominent economic specialists
 publicly reviewed the problems of the regime.  Po I-po spoke
 twice in February on the task of "consolidating" the agri-
 cultural cooperatives and admitted the existence of con-
 siderable dissatisfaction among the peasants.                                 Chen Yun in
 March outlined a number of specific measures for retrench-
 ment.  Teng Tzu-hui spoke in March in favor of moderate
 policies in the countryside.
 Chia To-fu's outline of the 1957 economic plan, presented
 in late March, was also moderate in its approach.  Possibly
 reflecting Mao's February speech, Chen implied that planning
 would give greater emphasis to consumer goods and agri-
 cultural production.
 Between April and June of 1957, the regime's economic
 specialists traveled and spoke extensively, explaining the
 reasons for the moderate goals of the 1957 economic plan.
 Li Fu-chun and Po   I-po were particularly active.  Both ad-
 mitted serious errors in past planning and among other things,
 increased proportional investment in agriculture and light
 industry, and greater authority for local levels, and greater
 emphasis on "small and medium" plant construction.

 The regime's chief spokesman in agricultural matters
 in the same period  was the moderate Teng Tzu-hui.  Teng
 emphasized the value of incentives.
 Tan Chen-lin of the party secretariat first appeared as
 a spokesman on rur&tl matters in May 1957, with an article
 designed to refute the contention that the life of the pea-
 sants was inferior to that of the urban workers.  The ar-
 ticle provided further indication that the regime was
 greatly concerned with increasing agricultural production,
 and it also seemed to illuminate Tan as a "high-pressure"
 man, unlike Teng Tzu-hui.
 The National People's Congress was postponed until late
 June 1957, owing to "rightist" attacks on the party and its
 policies.  Chou En-lai opened the congress with a defensive
 speech in which he denied that the regime had "advanced too
 hastily" in 1956, although he had admitted this the previous
 September; he also denied that the regime had "retreated too
 hastily" in 1957.  Chou said greater power would be given
 local authorities.
 Li Hsien-nien told the congress that the aim of the
 financial plan for 1957 was to "consolidate 1956."  Like
 Chou, he endorsed decentralization.  Po I-po told the con-
 gress about mistakes in planning in 1956, and predicted only
 a small increase in industrial production in 1957.
 In July and August 1957, Po I-po and Chia To-fu were the
 key figures at the Peiping conference which drew up control
 figures for the 1958 economic plan.  Their statements indi-
 cated that the planners envisaged for the 1958 targets only
 slight increases over 1957.  Strikingly, both omitted any
 reference to the priority of heavy industry, and both em-
 phasized the importance of developing agriculture.
 In that period, the regime apparently calculated that
 the period of retrenchment could be concluded in 1957 and
 that the level of economic development in 1958 would be a
 little higher than in 1957.  The clarion had not yet sounded
 for a "leap forward."

 attendant on the "first upsurge" of 1955-56.  There had been
 a restoration of "balance" to the economy and, with this
 achieved, the dominant figures of the party leadership de-
 cided to undertake a "second upsurge."
 The principal factor in the party's decision seemed to
 be a reassessment of the potential of the "rectification"
 movement, which was to be extended throughout the nation.
 The party leaders apparently believed that the party cadres
 and the populace, most importantly the peasantry, could both
 achieve and demonstrate their state of rectitude by some
 furious new effort.
 At the central committee plenum of September-October 1957
 Mao Tse-tung apparently took the lead in urging a "second up-
 surge," although his remarks were not published at the time.
 Mao seems also to have to have warned against further de-
 bate as to whether to proceed with another upsurge.
 Teng Hsiao-ping in his report to the plenum foresaw that
 economic progress would be "greatly advanced" by the extension
 of the rectification campaign.   Inter alia,, Teng criticized
 three minor economic policies for which Chen Yun had been the
 chief spokesman, and he contradicted two views on agricul-
 turai policy espoused by the moderate Teng Tzu-hui.  Teng
 Hsiaci-ping emphasized the need for "rectification" in the
 countryside.  He expressly predicted, as a result of con-
 sistent struggle against "conservatism," an  "u-.3urge this
 winter in agricultural production and consteuction."
 Chen Yun, who remained in favor despite his association
 with certain rejected measures, reported to the plenum on
 plans for decentralization and on problems in increasing agri-
 cultural production.   In a minor report to the plenum, the
 obstinate Teng Tzu-hui continued to advocate moderate policies
 in rural work.
 The proceedings of the September-October 1957 plenum
 made it apparent that the period of consolidation, begun in
 April 1956, was over. The regime was preparing trr adopt some
 of the measures for speeding economic growth whici: had been
 under consideration since that time, and most of the party's
 leaders seemed to agree that a period of rapid progress was
 ahead.

 Beginning in October 1957, the aggressive Tan Chen-lin
 became the regime's principal spokesman on agricultural policy.
 Tan publicly "explained" the revised draft program for agri-
 cultural development.                        Later in the month, he publicly criti-
 cized the agricultural policies of the period July 1956 -
 May 1957 and warned that "insufficient confidence is a kind
 of rightist thinking." Tan observed that the greater part
 of the increase in agricultural development was to come from
 the efforts of the peasants themselves, and he foresaw great
 things for the large-scale mobilization of the peasantry
 for water-conservancy and irrigation projects.
 In November, after almost a year of silence, Liu Shao-
 chi joined Teng Hsiao-ping and Tan Chen-lin in the role of
 exhorter.  Liu criticized the "vague doubt and rejection
 harbored by some people" which had impeded the regime's
 economic growth.
 The party's economic specialists who made public pro-
 nouncements in the same period generally supported the positbn
 of the exhorters.  They took a less positive and emphatic
 line, however, and continued to show greater sensitivity
 to actual and potential problems.
 The State Council in mid-November 1957,  promulgated re-
 gulations providing for decentralization.  The measures gave
 greater power in some respects to regional And local author-
 ities and increased their incentives to control and expand
 production.  The changes were aimed at'correcting the 1956
 "errors" of slighting existing industrial facilities and
 neglecting small- and medium-scale projects.  The regulations
 were publicized as a means of organizing the new "production
 upsurge."
 Liu Shao-chi appeared again as an exhorter in December
 1957, calling on the nation to "forge ahead at full steam."
 Li Fu-chun in the same month predicted a "new upsurge"
 in 1958, but he gave a more balanced view of economic affairs.
 In two pronouncements, he warned against overly enthusiastic
 implementation of some of the new policies and criticized those
 enthusiasts who manifested the disorders of "rash advance" or
 "superficially activism but in fact conservatism."

 Another national planning conference met in December.
 The 1958 plan targets, although unspecified, were said to
 have been set "much higher" than those fixed by the July-
 August planning conference.
 Of four other key figures in formulating economic poli-
 cies who made speeches during December, only Chia To-fU was
 moderate in tone.   Liao Lu.-yen echoed the aggressive line
 stated by Tan Chen-lin in October, and Tan himself, to new
 speeches, strongly endorsed the use of mass labs,:--some-
 times of province-wide scope--in water-conservancy work.
 Po I-po assailed the continuing "conservatism" of unspeci-
 fied central planners and derided those who were conven-
 tionally concerned with "balance."
 The most aggressive position taken by any party leader
 in December was that of Chu Te, who was plainly speaking ,for
 Mao.  Chu called for maximum effort, for "positiveness," and
 for "tense struggle," and he !'sternly repudiated" the doubters.
 In one speech he publicly introduced the term "great leap
 forward," declaring that such a leap was possible in agri-
 culture.
 People's Daily opened the New Year 1958 with an echo of
 Liu Shao-ch  s December call to advance,at "full steam."  It
 cited the "unprecedented production upsurge" in the country-
 side, the most important feature of which was apparently the
 water-conservancy campaign.  This campaign reportedly in-
 volved some 100 million peasants.
 At a party conference held at Nanning later in January,
 Mao Tse-tung apparently encouraged a "great leap forward,"
 The conference reportedly discussed means of making the
 decentralization scheme contribute to this leap.   In the same
 period Ko Ching-shih, first secretary of the party's Shanghai
 bureau, seemed to be emerging as a kind of counterpart in the
 industrial sector to Tan Chen-lin in the agricultural field.
 The National People's Congress in February 1958 heard
 reports from Li Hsien-nien, Po I-po, and Chou En-lai.  Li
 predicted "amazing" developments in 1958 and asserted the
 feasibility of a "new forward leap."  He endorsed the use of
 mass labor and the policy of decentralization.

 Po I-po indicated that the "leap" was already under way;
 he observed further that the industrial tr.rgets set in Decem-
 ber might be "greatly surpassed."  Po called for the submis-
 sion of targets to the "masses,'! who would raise them; this
 was the way in which the incredible targets of the "great
 leap forward" were later generated.
 In his report, Chou En-lai adapted himself easily to the
 spirit of the "leap."  His concern, however, was n,-,t primarily
 with economic affairs.
 People's Daily throughout February encouraged a "leap
 forward."  One editorial attacked the "conservative idea
 of striving alternately for progress and consolidations"--the
 concept which represented the party's own course in 1955-56
 (rapid advance) and 1956-57 (consolidation).   In May 1958
 the pkper's li::c was restated by Liu Shao-chi in his advocacy
 of "uninterrupted revolution."
 In March 1958 -:he party held another conference.  As at
 Nanning two months earlier,  this conference, held at Chengtu,
 discussed decentralization and the prospects for a "leap."
 The conference was evidently responsible for the wholesale
 "passing down of authority" which took place during the re-
 mainder of 1958, as well as for the decision to undertake the
 greatest possible "leap," including a 20-percent increase in
 grain output.
 ~It was at this point that moderate forces among the re-
 gime's administrators and economic specialists seemed to lose
 whatever moderating influence they may have been exerting.
 The sense of controlled and orderly action, the rationality
 supposedly implicit in a planned economy, disappeared from
 accounts of the regime's daily activities.
 Following the Chengtu conference, "upsurge" and "struggle"
 meetings roared through the country.  There was a rush of new
 and often incredible targets.   In mid-April the regime re-
 leased production figures for the first quarter of 1958 which
 provided statistical fuel for the fire of the "leap forward."
 The party's economic specialists were silent during the
 leaping of the "leap" in March and April.  Because other party
 leaders--including Mao, Liu, and Chou--publicly encouraged the
 "leap" during their travels in that period, it was of some
 interest that the economic specialists did not find similar
 occasions to do so.

 The "leap" dominated the party congress c+ May 1958.   Liu
 Shao-chi told the congress that Mao Tse-tung :.11 along had fa-
 vored the current "general line" of "pressing consistently to
 achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results."
 He failed to point out that Mao had favored a moderate course
 in the autumn 1956 - summer 1957 period.
 Liu contended correctly that in September.1957 the party,
 led by Mao, had foreseen another "upsurge."  He observed that
 some unidentified comrades had not agreed and that they re-
 mained unconvinced.
 Liu said the party should not again permit an "ebb tide"
 such as that of the autumn 1956 - summer 1957 period.  Such a
 development, he argued, would be inconsistent with the party's
 doctrine of "uninterrupted revolution."
 Liu derided "some people" who did not recognize the im
 portance of increasing the pace, feared the toll of the pace,
 foresaw much..waste, were concerned about "imbalances," opposed
 a greater investment in agriculture, doubted that agriculture
 could advance rapidly, or believed that agricultural growth
 could not keep pace with the growth of the population.   Liu
 called for the party machine to provide leadership for the
 "leap" at all levels, and he reaffirmed the centrality of
 "ideological and political work."
 Tan Chen-lin's report to the congress on the 12-year pro-
 gram for agriculture was very similar to Liu's.  He denounced
 those who had been skeptical of the results of the "first
 upsurge" and were skeptical of the prospects of the "second
 upsurge."  Tan emphasized the possibility of carrying out the
 12-year agricultural program ahead of schedule.
 The proceedings of the congress supported the view that
 there remained a substantial body of opposition to the exhor-
 ters.  Liu and Tan seemed to be warning this opposition that
 Mao since September had favored the exhorters and continued
 to do so.  The level of the opposition, however, was unclear.
 Of the three new politburo members announced after the
 congress--So Ching-shah, Li Ching-chuan, and Tan Chen-lin--
 at least two had been active in exhorting the "leap," and all
 three seemed to be close to Mao and the "party machine" exhorters.

 members of the politburo, had not been among the exhorters
 and had not seemed to be close to them.
 Conclusions
 Contrary to the party's efforts to present its "general
 line" as of May 1958 as the realization of a coherent set of
 policies projected by Mao Tse-tung years before the fact,  the
 evidence indicates that the Chinese Communists in the 1955-58
 period proceeded empirically in formulating their economic
 policies.
 The party leaders were united in wishing to move ahead
 with socialization of the economy and with production and con
 struction as rapidly as feasible.   They differed, however, as
 to what rate of advance was in fact feasible--the problem
 which Liu Shao-chi in May 1958 described as having been the
 "most important question" facing the party all along.  They
 also differed in their attitude toward specific programs and
 measures.
 Although Mao Tse-tung was not the kind of prophet party
 spokesmen assert he was, he does seem genuinely to have been
 "The Leader"; that is, while encouraging other party leaders
 to express their views. Mao himself signaled the major changes
 in the tempo of economic development.  Similarly, while en-
 couraging other party leaders to devise specific programs and
 measures appropriate to the chosen tempo, Mao remained the ul-
 timate arbiter of programs and measures.
 Naturally disposed to favor an aggressive course, Mao
 was happiest when urging the "first upsurge" of 1955-56 and
 the "second upsurge" of 1957-58.  He was also acting in char-
 acter, however, in signalling those upsurges only when he
 felt secure in so doing, ai.d in approving the "ebb tide" be-
 tween the two upsurges.  Mao has long instructed the party to
 "scorn difficulties strategically, but pay keen attention to
 them tactically"--a line he has often used to justify caution.
 The "first upsurge" was enough of a success that Mao
 probably lost little prestige in 1956 when problems and natural
 calamities forced an "ebb."  He may have lost a bit during
 1957, however, in the eyes of some of the aggressive "part
 machine" figures.  Mao was certainly vulnerable to a charge
 of poor judgment after the humiliating failure of his "lib-
 oral political line in 1957, and he may similarly have been

 regarded by some party leaders as being too soft in his eco-
 nomic thinking as well--that is, as having overextended the
 "ebb tide" period.   In any case, Mao committed his prestige
 heavily--beginning in September 1957--to the success of the
 "second upsurge" and--beginning in March 1958--to the success
 of the "great leap forward."
 Whatever the truth may have been about fluctuations in
 Mao's prestige, throughout the course of the changes in the
 party line in the years 1955-58 other party leaders assisted
 Mao in his effort to appear to have been right all along. In
 other words, Mao continued publicly to embody the principle
 that the party can never be significantly in error.   Mao's
 continuance in this public role is in itself impressive--some
 would say conclusive--evidence that Mao continued to dominate
 the party in the 1955-58 period.
 Those party leaders who have been discussed in previous
 POLO papers as "part y-machine" or "organizational" figures did
 not play important public roles in the "first upsurge" of
 1955-56, as Mao chose that his would be the only leading role.
 By the nature of their party posts, however, all of them must
 have had important responsibilities in speeding the socializa-
 tion of agriculture and the transformation of industry and
 commerce, as well as in accelerating production and construc-
 tion.  This was good practice for the roles they were to play
 in the "second upsurge."
 Although Liu Shao-chi had been caught publicly in a
 "soft" position on agricultural socialization when Mao per-
 sonally reversed the party line in mid-1955, the over-all
 record of both Liu and Tang Hsiao-ping suggests that they found
 congenial the hard line of the "first upsurge."  Similarly,
 while Liu at the party congress of September 1956 associated
 himself publicly with the moderate economic policies adopted
 at that time, it is plausible that Liu and some of the other
 "party-machine" figures regretted the party's decision more
 than did many other leaders.
 One need not accept at face value Liu Shao-chi's impli-
 cation in his lay 1958 report that he and like-minded com-
 rades had consistently advocated an aggressive course and
 had attempted to prevent the "ebb tide" of 1956-57.   It may
 be significant, however, that after September 1956--the be-
 ginning of the "ebb tide"--Liu and Teng Hsiao-ping were

 silent on questions of economic policy.   It may also be sig-
 nificant that another "party-machine" figure, Tan Chen-lin, ap-
 peared as a swirl on the horizon in May 1957--months before
 the "ebb tide" ended-- with a speech on agriculture much
 harder in tone than those of other party leaders in that
 period.
 Previous POLO papers have argued that Liu and Teng were
 not in sympathy with certain features of Mao's experiment with
 "liberalization" during the first half of 1957, and that this
 feeling was indicated in part by their silence.   It seems pos-
 sible that their silence on economic matters during tho "ebb
 tide," together with Tan Chen-lin's appearance as a hard-line
 advocate, indicates that a small group of "party-machine"
 figures had not been fully in accord with Mao's decisions on
 economic questions, just as they had not fully agreed with
 his political course.
 In the summer of 1957, the "party-machine" leaders may
 have taken the lead in urging or encouraging Mao Tse-tung to
 merge the "antirightist etruggla" and the party's rectifica-
 tion campaign into a nationwide rectification campaign.   They
 no doubt saw in developments of 1957 a vindication of their
 emphasis--normally Mao's own emphasis--on the importance of
 indo?i;crtnation, on the capabilities ct organizational techniques,
 and on tt:9 necessity of maintaining momentum.  They may have
 seen, more clearly than other party leaders, the rectification
 campaign as a mechanism for mobilizing the populace--particu-
 larly the underemployed rural labor force--for a furious new
 campaign to reverse the "ebb tide."
 In any case, the "party-machine" leaders came into their
 own in September 1957 with the announcement of nationwide rec-
 tification and with the unannounced decision to proceed with
 another "upsurge" in economic development.  As the principal
 supervisors of the rectification campaign, they were well sit-
 uated to supervise the process by which the energies made
 available through rectification were to be drected into a
 "second upsurge."  Moreover, in this process the party machine
 was to assume such more authority and responsibility for eco-
 nomic development at all levels.                                25X1

 ing those who were opposed to a headlong course.                             The "party-
 machine" figures played their roles with the gusto of those
 who fully endorsed the course they were urging.   In short, there
 seems to have been a happy coincidence of their party posi-
 tions, their roles in the party's two major campaigns of 1957-
 58, and the courses of action which they personally favored.
 Each of the six full members of the current politburo re-
 garded as "party-machine" figures, with the apparent exception
 of Peng Chen, gained in power and prestige in the course of
 the "second upsurge" and its transformation into the "great
 leap forward."  This was strikingly demonstrated at the party
 congress of May 1958:  the three major reports were given by
 Liu Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-ping, and Tan Chen-lin; and Tan, Ko
 Ching-ship, and Li Ching-chuan were "elected" as the three new
 members of the politburo.   With respect to Liu Shao-chi, the
 principal figure of this group, his increased prestige was
 shown further by his presenting himself (being permitted or
 feeling free to present himself) as having been right all along,
 like the great Mao himself.
 Chou En-lai's personal position at any given time in the
 years 1955-58 is hard to determine,   In his public role, Chou
 slid smoothly into whatever position was the official party
 line of the time; thus he spoke seriatim for conservative,
 aggressive, moderate, and very aggressive economic programs
 without indicating a personal preference.  Similarly, Chou
 was identified or associated throughout the 1955-58 period
 with various measures--in particular, decentralization--which
 are not susceptible to classification as "hard" or "soft" in
 the way varying positions on the feasible rate of economic
 development can be classified.
 Chou's post as premier, certainly the most important in
 the government, has in itself encouraged speculation that he
 is to be found more often on the moderate than on the aggres-
 sive side, when economic issues can be drawn in those terms.
 As several observers have noted, Mao and certain of the
 "party-machine" figures are the party's theorists, and it is

 easier to translate theory into policy than to translate pol-
 icy into practical results.  Similarly, it is easier to set
 objectives for government organs and to approve or disapprove
 their work--the task of the party organs--than it is to pro-
 duce work which will meet the standards of "greater, faster,
 better, and more economical results" simultaneously.   In this
 connection, with the party machine's assumption in 1958 of
 greater direct responsibility for economic results, party-
 machine figures might be expected thereafter to show increased
 sensitivity to problems and to interject notes of caution in
 their exhortations; there were some indications of this in the
 tpeeches     the
 certainly o        e.
 .
 It is plausible to presume that Chou occupied a position
 somewhere to the right of the "party-machine" figures in the
 party's private deliberations on economic matters in the 1955-
 58 period.  This conjecture might be supported by Chou's rela-
 tively small public role in the "second upsurge"; it might
 also be supported by his small role at the May 1958 congress
 and by the consideration that no one regarded as close to Chou
 was added to the party politburo at that time.   It is impos-
 sible, however, to judge from the record whether the distance
 separating Chou from the "party-machine" figures was signif-
 icant--in other words, whether it was wide enough to put Chou
 in anther defined group.
 Chou's government apparatus lost some power, relative to
 the party machine, in organizing and managing the "second
 upsurge."  Chou also seemed to lose some power, relative to
 the "party-machine" leaders, in the party politburo; the three
 new politburo members appeared likely to be responsive to the
 "party-machine" leaders rather than to Chou in any policy dis-
 putes or factional struggles that might develop.  However,
 Chou did not seem to lose any prestige in the 1955-58 period.
 He began and ended it as the third-ranking party leader and
 was reported in the party press in terms only a little less
 glowing than those used for Liu.
 Like the "party-machine" figures, the party's senior
 economic specialists.--Chen Yun, Li Fu-chun, Li Hsien-nien,
 Po I-po, Teng Tzu-hui, and Chia To-fu--did not have impor-
 tant public roles in the "first upsurge" of 1955-56.   In most
 cases the positions they took in party deliberations are un-

 have looked with disfavor on that policy and on other aspects

 The economists welcomed the opportunLty in the spring of

 gether with Chou En-lai, seemed to be the sources of the prom-
 ising new proposals relating to decentralization, the exploi-
 tation of coastal industries, and the construction of "small
 and medium" plants.  At the same time, all economic specialists
 were disposed to a comparatively cautious line in economic plan-
 ning while the new proposals were being examined.
 By September 1956 the moderate economists, possibly to-
 gether with Chou En-lai, had come to dominate the party's think-
 ing--that is, they had the strongest influence with Mao--on the
 question of the tempo of economic advance.  This was reflected
 in the moderate course approved by the party congress of Sep-
 tember 1956, as well as in appointments to the politburo,
 where long-time politburo member Chen Yun was joined by the
 next three ranking economists.
 During the remainder of 1956 and the first several months
 of 1957--the greater part of the course of the "ebb tide"--
 the economic specialists continued in a position of dominance.
 Whereas "party-machine" leaders were silent (Liu Shao-chi
 and Teng Hsiao-ping) or showing overt signs of restlessness
 (Tan Chen-lin), the econov-ists were very articulate in ex-
 plaining the need for "retrenchment," for greater incentives,
 and for moderate planning.
 The economists were in an ambiguous position by the
 summer of 1957.   Some of the practical measures which they
 had devised--measures aimed at stimulating future economic
 growth--had gained general favor.  On the other hand some of
 the "soft" policies which they had sponsored during the "ebb
 tide" had been disappointing, so they were to some degree
 vulnerable to criticism.
 During the summer of 1957 the economists were losing
 their position of leadership in economic affairs.  Mao Tse-
 tung, either on his own or at the urging of "party-machine',
 figures, was deciding to undertake a nationwide "rectification"

 campaign which appropriately was to be led by "party-machine"
 figures who would in turn be properly placed to supervise the
 campaign's direction into another "upsurge" in economic devel-
 opment and to supervise the party machine in its greatly ex-
 panded role.
 Thus, in the autumn of 1957, although the economists agreed
 with other party leaders that a period of rapid economic prog-
 ress was ahead, the leadership of the "second upsurge" was
 given to "party-machine" figures.   During that period the
 economists were acting honestly in giving general support to
 the sanguine line of the "party-machine" figures, but they
 were also acting honestly in expressing reservations.
 One of the economists, Po I-po, by December 1957  had
 publicly abandoned his reservations.  Po's action, in the
 light of his previous record, seems to have been opportunistic.
 The party's senior economists, together with Chou En -lai,
 were increasingly drawn in the early months of 1958 into the
 "upsurge" and its transformation into a "great leap forward."
 To some degree this process probably reflected a genuine in-
 crease in their confidence, but to some degree a loss of con-
 trol over developments.  The silence of the economists during
 the leaping of the "leap" in the spring of 1958 may well have
 reflected disapproval of some features of the "leap's" man-
 agement--in particular the exhortations to unrealistic goals
 in agriculture.
 The displacement of the economists as economic leaders
 was illustrated at the party congress of May 1958.  None of
 them gave a major report, and those who were not already mem-
 bers of the politburo were not named to it.   Moreover, the
 economists were being indirectly criticized in the contention
 of Liu Shao-chi and Tan Chen-lin that the party must not again
 permit an "ebb tide."  Most of the economists, however,  re-
 mained in favor both with Mao and with the "party-machine"
 leaders.
 As of May 1958, in sum, Mao Tse-tung and the "party-
 machine" leaders had set a course in economic development
 so aggressive that the term "planned economy" was hardly
 meaningful.  This course was to continue at least through
 1960, and the party's interpretation of "uninterrupted rev-
 olution" could serve to extend it as much further as the
 human material at hand would permit.   It was primarily the

 "party-machine" leaders who were charged with organizing,  in-
 doctrinating, and driving the party cadres and the Chinese
 people and with estimating how much could be got out of them.
 As of May 1958, Mao and tt   "party-machine" leaders had
 committed their prestige jointly, and very heavily, to the
 achievement of spectacular results in the "great leap for-
 ward."  The prestige of most of the party's senior adminis-
 trators and economists was less heavily committed.
 As of May 1958, the prospects of the "great leap forward"
 were uncertain, but they gave promise of affecting the party
 hierarchy in any case.   If the "leap" were a great success or
 could plausibly be presented as that, Mao's position would be
 strengthened and the "party-machine" leaders--particularly
 Liu Shao-chi--wou'l improve their prospects for eventually
 succeeding him at the helm of the party.   If the "leap" were
 a serious disappointment, a development which would be con-
 cealed from the public, the blame could be fixed on some of
 Mao's lieutenants:   certain "party-machine" figures who had
 given Mao bad counsel or had failed in performance, ^r some
 of the administrators and economists who had opposed the ex-
 tremes of the "leap" and thus could be accused of sabotage.
 A forthcoming POLO paper will discuss the course of the "great
 leap forward" after May 1958.
