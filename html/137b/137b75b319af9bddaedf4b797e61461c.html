 ISRAEL: Uncertainties About Begin
 IMenachem Begin,  leader of Israel's Likud party, prob-
 a                 y hopes that his offer of the Foreign Ministry portfolio to
 former defense minister Moshe Dayan will soften the party's
 hardline image abroad and help counter concern in Washington
 and among Jewish interest groups in the US that a Likud-Zed
 government will be extremist.
 Unlike Begin,  Dayan opposes formally annexing the
 West Bank.     Dayan believes Israel must permanently maintain a
 strong military presence there.  Earlier this month, he told US
 embassy officers that he believes the present arrangements
 could continue with some modifications.  As part of a final
 peace settlement,  he favors a kind of "dual sovereignty" with
 Jordan that would give Israel responsibility for Jewish resi-
 dents and Jordan civil administrative rights over the Arab
 communities.
 Dayan has privately indicated that he would retain
 e Gaza Strip and adjacent parts of the Sinai,  but would be
 willing to give up the rest of the Sinai and the Golan Heights
 in return for final peace agreements with Egypt and Syria.
 I             Begin probably intends to draw on Dayan's experience
 in ear ier negotiations with the Arabs and his broad knowledge
 of the US--a background that no Likud figure can match.
 Begin also may be counting on Dayan to draw support
 I or   i u    from among Labor Party conservatives,  and thus
 strengthen a Likud-led government's position with the Knesset,
 at least on negotiation issues.  By including Dayan, moreover,
 Begin probably hopes to gain greater bargaining leverage in his
 coalition negotiations with the Democratic Movement for Change.
 Begin could argue that the Democratic Movement's participation
 is not essential and that it must drop some of its demands if
 it wishes to join a Likud-led coalition.
 L        J Labor leaders have already asked Dayan to resign from
 his seat in the Knesset,  and Dayan has indicated he will do so
 if Begin succeeds in forming a government.  Dayan's resignation
 would not affect Labor's parliamentary strength;  Labor would
 be entitled to fill the vacated seat.

 icy issues Begin, whose consistency of views has been a hall-
 mark of his political career, might temporize as he attempts to
 form a coalition.  It is also unclear how much of a moderating
 influence some of his lieutenants and possible coalition part-
 ners will be able to exert.
 I              Since the election, Begin has repeatedly emphasized
 his party s determination to retain permanent control over the
 occupied West Bank, which he refers to as "liberated territory."
 Similarly, Begin has adamantly rejected any negotiations with
 the Palestine Liberation Organization and has even indicated
 that he does not recognize the Palestinians as a separate Arab
 community.
 Speaking in the first flush of Likud's triumph,
 Begin may have been seeking mainly to reassure his right-wing
 constituency rather than to define firm guidelines to govern
 Israeli's participation in future peace talks.  Since then, he
 has made an effort to paper over differences with the Democratic
 Movement for Change and to entice it to join a Likud government
 by offering not to change the present status of the West Bank
 so long as peace negotiations with the Arabs are in progress.

 wing as an autocrat for over 30 years, assiduously rooting out
 all serious challengers to his authority and grooming no one
 to succeed him.
 I       J Ezer Weizman, Begin's principal lieutenant, would
 appear  have an edge over the leader of Likud's Liberal wing,
 Simcha Ehrlich, who reportedly does not covet the party top

 SYRIA: Possible Cabinet Changes
 Syrian President Asad may be planning changes soon
 in his cabinet and in the Baath party hierarchy in response to
 domestic dissatisfaction with widespread corruption and eco-
 nomic difficulties.  The moves would be designed primarily to
 undercut Asad's opponents and strengthen his own position.  They
 would have  little effect on Asad's basic policies or the causes
 of popular discontent.

 month's scheduled election of the People's Council. Recent edi-
 torials in the Baath party newspaper lend credence to the ru-
 mors of an impending shakeup. The editorialist, presumably with
 official approval,  implicitly attacked Khulayfawi by calling
 for stringent measures to deal with domestic problems--espe-
 cially the spread of corruption--which he alleged have been ig-
 nored because of the government's preoccupation with external
 affairs.
 The Prime Minister was appointed by Asad last August
 w1tfi a mandate to clean up corruption and improve government
 efficiency.  He has encountered strong opposition from powerful
 people in the regime, most notably Asad's notoriously corrupt
 brother Rifaat. Frustrated and dispirited, Khulayfawi report-
 edly tendered his resignation last December because of his in-
 ability to do much about the problems. Asad's decision to in-
 tervene militarily in Lebanon has exacerbated Syria's economic
 problems;  its balance-of-payments deficit and inflation and
 commodity shortages have become more serious.
 Former prime minister Ayyubi,  speaker of the People's
 ounce    alabi, and air force and security chief Jamil, a close
 associate of Asad,  have been mentioned as possible successors
 to Khulayfawi.  Given the intractable nature of Syria's economic
 troubles and the likelihood that Rifaat Asad will remain "un-
 touchable," a new prime minister is unlikely to fare Gany better.
 I             A reshuffling of key government and party posts, how-
 ever, wou d allow Asad to place the onus of failure on others
 and to deflect his opponents'  criticism. Asad can also replace
 some officials of questionable loyalty and reward his support-
 ers.
 USSR-CHINA: Chinese Propaganda Protest
 //The publication yesterday of the USSR's first
 orma  protest to the post-Mao  leadership in China suggests
 that Moscow is underscoring that it sees no prospect for any
 early improvement in Sino-Soviet relations.  The protest is in
 response to China's continuing propaganda attacks on the USSR.
 The first direct Soviet attack on China's new Zeadersfsince
 the death of Mao Tse-tung last September was contained in a
 Pravda article 13 days ago.//

 Approved F
 I         uIn the protest note, which was given to China pri-
 vately a week ago, the Soviets call China's propaganda "mali-
 cious slander, abuse, and a provocation" and twice warn that
 its continuation will have "dangerous consequences." Although
 the Soviets do not spell out these consequences, they stress
 that the USSR has no aggressive intentions toward China and
 strive instead to portray China's leaders as implacably opposed
 to peace. The Soviets accuse the Chinese of desiring a new
 world war and of mapping a course of action aimed at pitting
 country against country.
 I                  //Moscow has formally protested Chinese behavior
 on a variety of issues over the years, but has not usually
 publicized the protests.  Its decision to go public in this in-
 stance probably was prompted by a desire to rebut Chinese propa-
 ganda attacks beamed to the USSR, to inform the Soviet people
 that there are no prospects for change in Sino-Soviet relations,
 and to impress upon the West how seriously Moscow views China's
 behavior. The Soviets are aware that the US is reviewing its
 China policy and probably feels impelled to spell out its posi-
 tion. The Soviets are especially concerned about,  and hope to
 dissuade,  the US from deciding to provide or encourage others
 to provide military aid to China.//
 USSR: Grain Prospects Good
 I                  //.The USSR appears likely to have a record winter
 grain crop        is year.  We expect this harvest--which normally
 accounts for about 30 percent of total Soviet grain production-
 to be well above the previous record of 63.5 million metric
 tons; it possibly could reach 70 million tons. As a result of
 the favorable outlook for this year's grain crop and the record
 harvest in 1976,  the Soviets have made no new grain purchases
 since  last December.//
 //The record prospects are in large part due to
 this year's expanded crop area--up roughly one fourth over last:
 year. Composed mostly of wheat and rye, winter grains were sown
 last fall on 38.5 million hectares--the largest area since 1968,
 and 1 million hectares greater than last year. Winter losses--
 normally 15 to 20 percent of the sown area--are not expected to

 exceed 10 percent this year. Unusually wet growing conditions
 throughout much of the European USSR, however, have led to weed
 infestation and plant diseases that may limit yields somewhat.//
 //It is still too early to predict the spring grain
 Output.     pring grain sowing was delayed in some regions. In ad-
 dition, inadequate subsoil moisture in both the Southern Urals
 and parts of Kazakhstan means yields in these areas will be de-
 pendent on rainfall from now through July.//
 After it has good harvest years, the USSR usually
 waits until the summer to enter the international market. A So-
 viet grain delegation,  in Washington last Friday for biannual
 consultations under the long-term grain agreement, would say
 only that Moscow would meet the minimum requirement under the
 second year of the agreement of buying 6 million tons of grain.
 The Soviet officials said it was too early in the crop season
 to forecast accurately their grain needs for the coming year.
 They gave no indication that they would order more than the
 6.1 million tons of US wheat and corn already bought for de-
 livery under the first year of the agreement that extends from
 October 1976 to September 1977.
 I           tOne trade source, who met with the Soviets before
 eir official visit, claimed that the Soviets were currently
 in the market for up to 2.5 million tons of soybeans and even-
 tually would purchase 4 million tons each of US corn and wheat.
 The Soviets bought about 2 million tons of soybeans
 last year, but a purchase of this size now would be surprising.
 US supplies are tight, causing high prices, and Soviet oil seed
 processing capacity would have dif          handling such a quan-
 tity.

 ECUADOR: Bucaram Candidacy
 /The possibility that Ecuadorean populist leader
 Assa   Bucaram may run for president is causing qualms among
 both military and civilian leaders. Bucaram is extremely popu--
 tar, and even a coalition attempt by several of Ecuador's po-
 Zitical parties probably could not win enough votes to stop
 him.
 Is     Bucaram, long a dedicated opponent of military dic-
 taor                ip in Ecuador, was twice exiled for "subversive activi-
 ties" in the early 1970s by then president Velasco. When it ap-
 peared that Bucaram might win the presidential election sched-
 uled for 1972, the military intervened and canceled it.
 Bucaram's party has no particular ideology and cam-
 paigns on the need for better living conditions for Ecuador's
 urban poor. His political base is in the more progressive
 coastal provinces, where he once served as an elected official.
 Municipal employees and many other workers remember his honest
 administration, tax and other reforms, and housing and develop-
 ment projects. He also has great appeal among the urban poor,
 who think he is on their side.

 INDIA: Water Plants
 India has one operating heavy water plant at Nangal
 and apparently is slowly overcoming the problems that have de-
 layed completion of four others.  India also is  likely soon to
 announce the start of construction of a new 300-ton-per-year
 plant.  These six plants, when operating,  will produce more
 heavy water than India needs for its reactors. India may decide
 to export the surplus.
 I     I Heavy water is used to control the nuclear reaction.
 in reactors fueled with natural uranium. When the six heavy
 water projects are completed sometime after 1980,  India will
 have a combined heavy water production capacity of around 615
 tons per year.  This is far in excess of its planned needs,
 making exports of heavy water by India a real possibility.
 I    I The 100-ton-per-year heavy water plant in Rajasthan
 that has been delayed because of difficulties in obtaining com-
 pressors will probably be operating in June 1978.  India report-
 edly has a firm promise from a West German company to deliver
 the needed compressors this August.
 The nuclear supplier nations disagree about whether
 e E company should be allowed to export these compressors with-
 out applying safeguards to the compressors,  to the intended
 plant, and to any material it produces.  To avoid this problem
 in the future, a large-Indian government-owned firm is prepar-
 ing to manufacture compressors for the remaining heavy water
 plants.

 The decision to resume talks follows a week of con-
 sultations among opposition leaders in response to a Saudi ini-
 tiative. Other Arabs,                        including members of the Palestine Libera-
 tion Organization, have also participated in the effort to re-
 solve Bhutto's differences with his opponents.  The opposition
 may have agreed to discussions in hopes that pressure from the
 Arabs would make Bhutto more conciliatory, but it is doubtful
 that the Arabs intend to force Bhutto to make concessions.
 I    I All sides have apparently agreed to a new National
 ssem  y election, but differences over timing make the agree-
 ment meaningless. The opposition wants an immediate election--
 one of their earlier proposals called for one in 30 days.  Bhutto
 wants as much time as possible to rebuild his position. This
 week a member of his cabinet said no election could be held
 before March.
 I            IThe opposition has demanded that Bhutto resign before
 the e ection because most opposition leaders doubt an honest
 election is possible with Bhutto in power. Bhutto, however,
 has no intention of stepping down and will use any tactic he
 can--including negotiations--to buy time.
