 MAJOR PRAVDA ARTICLE STRESSES COORDINATION, PTTACKS PEKING
 Moscow has followed up the Crimea meeting of communist leaders
 with an authoritative expression of its concern over communist
 unity and the challenge posed by Chinese hostility.  Using the
 vehicle of a lengthy PRAVDA article on 7 August bearing the
 signature of "I. Aleksandrov," an apparent pseudonym that has
 been associated with major policy pronouncements on the China
 problem,* Moscow has conveyed a strong interest in broader
 policy coordination by communist regimes in pressing the detente
 line worldwide.  The Alekaendrov article provides a wide-ranging
 amplification of themes advanced in a 3 August CPSU Politburo
 communique on the Crimea conference that had asserted Moscow's
 positions on communist unity aid international detente in stronger
 terms than did the bland joint communique issued at the conference.**
 The Aleksandrov article's invocations of the 1969 international
 party conference  and its two predecessors nay presage a campaign
 to convene another such conference.  The Politburo communique
 contained a possible hint of interest in a new conference by
 citing a need for "a collective analysis" of current issues.
 CHINA     The overriding, a~most obsessive theme in the Aleksandrov
 article is the need for unity in "the socialist community"
 in all fields, including foreign policy coordination, economic
 integration, and stove all in confronting the Chinese challenge
 with closed ranks.  The article plays up the successes
 in implementing the Soviet detente policy, highlighting in
 particular the Soviet-U.S. agreement on preventing nuclear war, and
 it cites the Crimea meetinV, as confirming a determination to expand
 the area of detente worldwide.  But a sharply discordant note
 appears when the article takes up the China question, a subject
 that generates a heated denunciation of the Peking leadership for
 having made a "full" break with Marx iem-Lenin ism and a "complete"
 departure from the common line of the socialist countries.
 *   The last previous I. hleksandrov article, on 5 September 1972,
 mounted a broad attack on Peking's domestic and foreign policies;
 it also made a passing reference to the 1972 Crimea conference, held
 more than a month earlier, but there was no authoritative commentary
 on that conclave as such.
 **  The joint communique is discussed in the TRENDS of 1 August 1973,
 pages 9-10.

 8 AUGUST 1973
 The article acknowledges that relations with Peking are "tense,"
 due of course to the "fault of the Chinese leadership," and it
 observes that this situation is "a downright anachronism" in an
 era of detente.  But though it affirms Moscow's readiness for
 "constructive" negotiations with the Chinese, the article in
 effect quashes any hone for progress by making this contingent
 on Peking's cessation of its "hostile activity."  There would
 scarcely be any need for negotiations if Peking were to accede
 to this demand.
 The article repeats Moscow's claim that it has often offered
 "constructive proposals",---left unspecified this time--but that
 the Chinese have rejected them or left them unanswered.  It
 also cites the CPSU plenum this April are having reconfirmed Moscow's
 desire for normal relations based on the principles of peaceful
 coexistence.  The plenum resolution had not, however, cited peaceful
 coexistence as the basis for Sino-Soviet relations, and in fact
 the Soviets had long regarded this as an inappropriate basis for
 relations between communist states.  In his major address on
 20 March 1072, during the period between the two big summits
 that year, Brezhnev had expressed--with an air of resignation--a
 readiness to accede to Peking's demand that Sino-Soviet relations
 be based on peaceful coexistence.  The Chinese are evidently
 regarded as so far beyond the pale that Moscow's position on
 this matter now smacks more of excommunication than of an
 ideological concession.
 The Aleksandrov article, which is markedly more hostile to the
 Chinese than Brezhnev had been in March 1972, comes soon after
 the return from Peking of Deputy Foreign Minister. Ilichev, the
 chief Soviet negotiator at the border talks.*  Soviet Ambassador
 Tolstikov has also been absent from Peking.  In contrast,
 Brezhnev's more conciliatory speech in March last year coincided
 with Ilichev's return to Peking after a prolonged absence.
 NEUTRALITY     The Aleksandrov article is at pains to portray
 the China problem as one that confronts the
 communist countries as a whole.  In fact, the article takes explicit
 exception to the view that the conflict concerns national
 differences between the Soviet Union and the PRC.  It insists
 rather that "the Maoist leadership" is waging a struggle against
 the very principles of Marxism-Leninism and the program
 "collectively" elaborated at the international party conferences
 of 1957, 1960, and 1969.

 Moscow's insistence on this point is implicitly directed at
 Sino-Soviet dispute and argue that dif:erencen between communist
 countries should be settled by bilateral talks.  Romania's
 adherence to its line undouh*.edly accounted for the blandness
 of the Crimean conference joint communique and the absence of
 criticism of China.  Moscow's pique over the Romanian position
 was clearly reflected in Soviet reports of Brezhnpv's individual
 meetings with various communist leaders following the Crimea
 meeting.  Orly the report of the Brezhnev-Ceausescu meeting,
 published in PRAVDA on the 2d, failed to mention an "identity
 of views on all questions discussed."  Moreover, except for
 the meeting with Ceausescu, all the reports of Brezhnev's meetings
 with individual leaders referred to discussion of "further"
 development of bilateral relations and to a "cordial and friendly"
 atmosphere.  The atmosphere of the Brezhnev-Ceausescu meeting was
 merely described as "friendly."
 POLITBURO C')'MJNIQUE     The Aleksandrov article's insistent
 demands for broader policy coordination
 and its criticism of China were foreshadowed in the CPSU Politburo
 communique on the Crimea meeting published in PRAVDA on the 4th.
 The Politburo communique spelled out Moscow's positions on inter-
 national detente and communist unity in stronger terms than did the
 joint communique issued at the close of the Crimea conference.
 Where the latter had warned vaguely against unidentified. "forces"
 opposed to detente, the Politburo communique spoke, in the
 language of the April CPSU plenum, of "intrigues of reactionary
 force;;."  It likewise went beyond the text of the joint cG.;u,unique
 in urging communist regimes to coordinate their policies
 "permanently" and in stressing the need for a "cLllective analysis"
 of current theoretical and political problems.  By the same token,
 without attacking China by name the Politburo communique criticized
 "'left' and right-wing opportunist trends" in world communism.
 BUCHAREST REAFFIRMS INDEPENDENCE AFTER CRIMEA CONCLAVE
 Romanian reaction to the Crimea conference reflected Bucharest's
 determination to persist in its independent course while downplaying
 its differences with Moscow.  Bucharest radio on the 3d, for
 example, reported that a. Romanian Communist Party (RCP) Executive
 Committee meeting that day, after hearing Ceausescu's report, had
 called the Crimea meeting "'a useful exchange of opinions on some
 problems" involving socialist countries and "some current-international

 problems" as well.  Unlike the Crimea joint communique, which had
 lavished praise on Brezhnev, the Bucharest session reserved its
 enthusiasm for Ceausescu's personal role in the Crimea which
 was said to have strengthened the unity of the socialist countries
 and "increased the prestige of socialism in the world."  After
 praising the meeting between Ceausescu and Brezhnev, the Executive
 Committee reportedly "decided that firm action should be taken
 to implement the agreements" reached between the two leaders.
 TASS reported these details of the RCP session the next day.
 A commentary carried by AGERPRES on the 4th was more outspoken in
 reasserting Romania's independent stance.  While applauding the
 results of the Crimea meeting and the Ceausescu-Brezhnev talks,
 the commentary appeared to respond to the contentious emphasis on
 policy "coordination" in the CPSU Politburo communique by declaring:
 As is well known, Romania, in full accordance with
 the guidelines of her foreign policy established
 by the 10th congress [1969] and-the national
 conference [1972], shows permanent concern for the
 development of relations of cooperation and
 friendship with all socialist countries.
 The commentary went on to point out that Bucharest cooperates with
 the CEMA member countries on the basis of "fully equal rights" and
 national sovereignty--principles which, it noted, are incorporated
 in the CEM1 statute.

 EUROPE
 MOSCOW REBUTS CHARGES U,S,-SOVIET NUCLEAR ACCORD HARMS EUROPE
 Paralleling the major effort it has launched since the June summit
 to justify the ideological legitimacy of its detente policies, Moscow
 has  mounted a similar  campaign in recent weeks to justify its
 policies to the West European audience.  No less than six major
 commentaries auchore:d by some of Moscow's ncet authoritative
 spokesmen have been devoted at least in part to this campaign over
 the past two weeks.*  The commentaries have focused on rebutting
 alleged West European concerns that the U.S.-Soviet agreement on
 prevention of nuclear war threatens the security of West Europe.
 The argumen':a have tangec: from s general defense of the nuclear
 agreement to specific rcLuttals of Western arguments.  They have
 tended to present the issue as involving ts'o conflicting views
 of European security--or.ebased on a perpetuation of the old
 confrontation politics, the ether based on trust and mutual
 accomodation.  A notable feature of the campaign is that it has
 put Moscow in the position (, " neeming to defend U.S. policy as
 well as its own.  At the same time--aad perhaps to counterbalance
 thi" impression--the commc:.car:?es have stressed the independence
 of the West European countries, suggesting Moscow's willingness
 tc tr_at them as equals.
 At the most general level, Moscow has simply denied the Western
 charges that Lhe nuclear agreement implies superpower condominium
 of Europe.  In so doing, it has sought to pin the responsibility
 for such charges on those who base their policy on "perpetuating
 abnormal" relations between Washington and Moscow.  This assertion
 was most recently made by IZVESTIYA political. commentator Matveyev
 on 7 August.  Anoth3r commentator, USA Institute military strategist:
 Trofimenko,writing in the 24 July RED STAR, bluntly labeled the
 "assertions of certain organs of the Western, and not only the
 Western, press" that the nuclear agreement signified the establishment
 of a U.S.-Soviet "nuclear condominium" as "absur.: and provocative."

 He went on  t.o assert that, this interpretation of the agreement
 was made by those who preferred U.S.-Soviet relations to be in
 a state of tension and who "cherished the idea that some small
 conflict or other, provoked 'at the right time,' might be a
 'trigger' to bring the strategic forces of the United States
 and the USSR into conflict."  A similar argument was made by
 TASS director general Zamyatin in SOVIET RUSSIA on 21 July.
 An article by IZVESTIYA political observer Bovin* on 25 July
 broadened this argument into an attaL.k on the fundamental premises
 of NATO policy.  Without mentioning the agreement specifically,
 Bovin pointed out that the allies of the United States "are
 worried" over the possibility that Washington may lessee its
 commitments to West Europe, thus underm ning the U.S. "nuclear
 umbrella" which protects the alliance from an alleged "Soviet
 threat."  Bovin went on to note that some "medium and small"
 states are "mesmerizing themselves with apparitions" of a
 U.S.-Soviet hegemony which reduces other countries to the "level
 of obedient players executing the will of the 'nuclear giants.
 Asserting that relations between NATO allies are an "interrat
 matter" the nature of which is "not determined in Moscow," he
 went on to lecture his audience about the responsibility of NATO
 members to resolve their own alliance problems.  Asserting that
 Moscow's concern was with the "aggressive" sum of NATO, not with
 its individual parts, Bovin declared that the USSR supporta good
 bilateral relations between the NATO members as long as they
 do not "harm" the interests of other states, adding that this
 position "does not depend on the state" of Moscow-Washington
 relations.  He concluded by rejecting charges that the USSR
 plans to "absorb" Weet Europe, labeling such charges as "totally
 without foundation,"
 That one of the targets of this Moscow propaganda effort is Paris
 was reflected iii the Brezhnev Kiev speech on 26 July--the day before
 the Soviet leader met with French Foreign Minister Jobert in the
 Crimea--and in the followup comment on that speech.  Brezhnev
 decried as "totally without foundation, unnecessary, and even
 harmful"  those who were tryii:g to "counterpose a great or even
 supergreat state to a medium-sized or small one.."  A commentator
 *  Since his first appearance in June 1972 as a political observer
 for IZVESTIYA, Bovin has written but a dozen articles; his
 commentaries have usually been of a serious nature, discussing
 the most topical and sensitive international issues.

 BREZHNEV HINTS AT DOMESTIC DIVIDENDS AS A RESULT OF DETENTE
 Brezhnev in his 26 July speech in Kiev went as far as any Soviet
 leader has to date in implying that Moscow hopes to extract
 immediate peace dividends from detente in the form of increased
 attention to domestic priorities.  Noting that the international
 atmosphere had become "noticeably warmer," Brezhnev declared that
 "it is eaaier to concentrate on the solution of peaceful,
 co:structive tasks and on affairs really worthy of man."  While
 Brezhnev may have had both domestic and international tasks in
 mind, it is notable that both PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA picked up
 his Kiev remarks as the keynote of their 31 July reports on
 the opening of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet session devoted to the
 improvement of consumer services.  PRAVDA quoted Brezhnev
 verbatim, while IZVESTIYA quoted another portion of his remarks
 which struck the same theme.  RED STAR, perhaps sensitive to the
 budgetary implications, did not mention Brezhnev's remarks in
 a report of the session that was otherwise similar to PRAVDA's.
 A "NEW LOOK"     Moscow has been unusually forthcoming since the
 Washington summit in discussing the possible
 peace dividends to be expected from the normalization of relations
 with the United States.  Brezhnev himself in his 11 July Lenin
 peace prize acceptance speech spoke of the need "to look anew"
 at certain questions of policy and to "define new goals" in view
 of the f-.vorable international situation.  Presumably with an
 eye toward the budgetary implications of these suggestions,
 Brezhnev at one point in the speech appeared to be rejecting
 the notion that Soviet military might constitutes the best
 guarantee of the stability of detente,   Acknowledging that the
 USSR must guard against being "'-.aught unawares" by attempts to
 reverse the trend toward detente, he asserted that "the best
 defense of peace is further active pursuit of our peaceful
 policy."  USA Institute director Arbatov similarly warned in the
 22 July PRAVDA that "power itself does not guarantee pL.,ce
 and much less detente."
 Kosygin, in Austria on 4 July, also acknowledged that the June
 summit was a search for "major and reliable solutions" to the
 problem of international security that would "liberate vast material
 resources for useful and creative aims."  Other spokesmen have
 asserted that SALT in particular should lead to a shift in budget
 priorities.  M. O. Kolosov, in a 29 July PRAVDA article on the

 strategic implications of the summit, said that the agreement
 on SALT reached by the two leaders gave "considerable momentum"
 to the negotiators' search for an agreement that would permit
 the Soviet Union and the United States to "redirect more funds
 to creative needs and to the improvement of people's lives."
 Soviet impatience over realizing the practical results of the
 detente policy was intimated by Arbatov in a Budapest TV interview
 on 5 August.  Responding to remarks by the interviewer about
 Hungarian concern over the tangible economic benefits of improved
 East-West relations, Arbatov noted that "this impatience is
 characteristic not only of Hungarians.  Other people ask the
 same thing."    He went on to cite the savings already realized
 from SALT through its agreement limiting ABM deployment.*
 DIMINISHED THREAT     As if to lend support to its own hopes for
 a peace dividend, Moscow has in recent
 weeks projected conf?dente regarding the intentions of Western
 leaders and the military threat posed by its Western adversaries.
 TASS on 5 August singled out French parliamentary leader Edgar
 Faure's remark that he had returned from his recent Moscow trip
 convinced that "at present neither the capitalist system nor
 the communist system seeks victory through force."
 The image of the United States has also benefited from this new
 mood.  Arbatov, in a radio interview broadcast to North America
 on 18 July, observed that U,S,, policy today "is shaped not by
 the opponents of detente bu:= by those who have the interests
 of peace and goodneighborly relations at heart."  IZVESTIYA
 political commentator Aleksandr Bovin observed on 25 July that
 "a review of the strategic foundations of U.S. foreign policy
 was one of the prerequisites of the normalization of Soviet-
 American relations."  Other commentators have recently professed
 to see signs that in the wake of Brezhnev's visit many U.S.
 political figures are reassessing the need for current levels
 of military spending. At the same time, Moscow has been soft-
 pedaling indications of disagreement with  the United States
 on a wide range of nuclear and arms control issues, from
 force reductions in Europe to the negotiations of the disarmameit
 committee in Geneva.
 *  Arbatov addressed another question in the interview that has
 been broached only indirectly in Soviet media.  In response to
 a question about how much detente with the United States depends
 on "certain personalities," he granted that President Nixon has
 played an important role but argued that 't-his change of attitude by
 a once "rigid anticommunist" was prompted by objective,

 BACKGROUND     Brezhnev in two 1971 speeches touched on the
 relationship between SALT, defense spending, and
 the rate of economic growth,  In an RSFSR Supreme Soviet election
 speech :Ln June 1971 he acknowledged that "without large defense
 expenditures we and our c.^_onomy would move ahead far more
 quickly."  Three months earlier, at the 24th CPSU Congress, he
 had asserted that a succesbful outcome of SALT would free
 "cons.derable means" for "constructive goals."

 PEOPLES DAILY DEMANDS BETTER TREATMENT OF RUSTICATED YOUTH
 The regime has indicated in exceptionally sharp terms that it
 is keenly disappointed with the implementation of the rustication
 program and that it is intent on insuring more effective leadership
 down to the grassroots level.  While disclosing frankly the ills
 besetting youth sent to the countryside, Peking has also made
 clear that the intensified rustication program--which some may
 have thought a temporary measure to dampen youthful acti'-ism
 promoted by the cultural revolution--is a permanent program designed
 to aid in coping with one of the regime's most pressing problem
 areas, agricultural production.
 These conc^_rns have been given authoritative expression in a 7
 August PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial entitled "Improve Work Regarding
 Educated Young People Going to the Countryside."  In view of the
 sensitive issues raised and the candor of the language, it is
 noteworthy that NCNA's international service disseminated the
 tetic of the editorial as well as a shorter version.  Buttressing
 this summer's call for party bodies to improve their work regarding
 youth assigned to the countryside, the editorial decries "unhealthy
 to dencies" and enjoins cadres with a "poor understanding" of the
 program to "straighten themselves out quickly."  The editorial
 puts teeth into its injunction by threatening "class enemies
 and criminals who oppress and persecute educated young people"
 with "heavy blows and punishment according to law."
 The economic interests served by rustication are reflected in
 the editorial's stress on the import ace of agriculture and on
 the need for "a great number" of educated youth to contribute
 their skills to the rural economy.  Having posited this need, the
 editorial proceeds to outline directives for improving the youth's
 living conditions in order to strike "a proper balance between
 work and leisure."  A similar concern over the well-being of
 rusticated youth vas reflected in a 27 July PEOPLE'S DAILY
 editor's note holding up the experience of one production team
 as Lxemplary for having enabled the youth to be self-supporting.
 Invoking Mao's concern over the living conditions of rusticated
 youth, the editor's note called on cadres to take effective
 measures to increase the income of youth.

 A PEOPLE'S DAILY article on 3 July suggested that the campaign
 to achieve effective leadership over rusticated youth is well
 underway, stating that Changchun municipality had met the problem
 of rural cadre unable to cope with the educated youths by sending
 500 cadres noted for their "high standards" along with the students
 as supervisors.  According to the article, these cadres "were
 later incorporated into the leading bodies of the counties and
 communes concerned to keep in close contact with the educated
 young people to look after their thinking, studying, living, and
 laboring conditions."
 Though the editorial urges that conditions be created for, the
 rusticated youth to "learn culture, science and technology,"
 there is no reference to another aspect of youth policy now under
 discussion, the issue of college enrollment.  It might be assumed
 that improvement of their living conditions, including provisions
 for more leisure and time for study, would enhance the likelihood
 that youth sent to the countryside could pass the college entrance
 examination.  The issue being raised in regard to college enrollment
 policy, however, is the degree to which the system should be
 weighted toward substantive academic criteria,, and the editorial
 simply avoids the subject.  That issue has been posed most
 sharply by Politburo member Chen Hsi-lien's provincial base,
 Liaoning, which opened the discussion by venting the frustrations
 of a rusticated youth unable to cope with the college entrance
 examination because of too much time devoted to work at the expense
 of substantive academic study.
 Whatever its possible implications for educational polity, the
 PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial develops a line on youth consistent with
 the moderate policies adopted in recent years and thus consistent
 with the liberalizing trends associated with Chou En-lai.  In
 addition to the tough admonition against "persecution" of educated
 youth, the editorial is strikingly solicitous toward their
 "opinions and demands" and even insists that their "special
 characteristics" must be taken into consideration.
 PEKING DROPS MAO HONORIFIC IN FURTHER REDUCTION OF CULT
 In a notable move toward further scaling down the Mao cult
 since the cultural revolution, Peking's account of Mao's meeting
 on 2 August with two Chinese-American doctors referred to Mao
 as "the leader of the Chinese people" instead of the standard
 "great leader of the Chinese people."  Identical reports on the
 meeting were carried by NCNA's English service, the NCNA domestic

 service, Peking's domestic radio, and Peking's domestic radiophoto
 service.  Mao was celled "great leader" as recently as 31 July
 when Yeh Chien-ying used that formula in a toast 9elivared at the
 reception in Peking inark'^d the PL". anniversary.
 Moves to dismantle the trappings of the Mao cult have been
 associated with the campaign  to discredit formar heir-apparent
 Lin Piao since Lin's downfall in September 1971.  One of the
 charges in this campaign has been that he fostered a theory of
 "geniuses" guiding historical development and that he promoted the
 Mau cult for his own purposes in order to exclude the role of the
 "massea"--meaning the party in particular.  A major joint editorial
 published on 1 December 1971 seemed to have subordinated Ma: to
 the party in referring to the CCP with "Comrade Mao Tse-tung
 as its leader," but that f..rmulation did not become standard.

 PEKING OFFERS RESTRAINED SUPPORT FOR ALLIES' PRONOUNCEMENTS
 Peking responded with careful restraint to the 30 July PRG and
 31 July DRV foreign ministry statements on implementation of the
 13 June joint communique, duly criticizing alleged violations
 by the Saigon a'ministration while softpedaling charges against
 the Unit.e1 States.  Following past practice, Peking did not
 reepund to its allies' statements at an equivalent: level, in
 this case seconding the foreign ministry statements with a 3
 August PEOPLE'S DAILY Commentator article, the lowest level of
 authoritative Chinese comment.  A PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial on 3
 April had secn;4ed government'-level statements on implementation
 of the peace agreement issued by the DRV (30 Mach) and the PRG
 (1 April).
 Like the 3 April editorial, the Commentator article avoided
 direct reference to specific deadlines  or ful:illment of pr,)visions
 of thr'. peace accord, reviewing implementation in general terms
 now that "over 40 days have elapsed" since the signing of the
 joint communique.  While noting that some provisions had been
 fulfilled, it asserted that because of 1',-,bstruction and saHotage"
 by Saigon and the United States, peace in Vietnam was still
 unstable and important provisi"4s remained to be implemented.
 It added merely that this "canloc but arouse concern" of people
 throughrut the world.  Last A`ril's editorial, in a similar
 passage charging Saigon-U.S. obetructiun, had commented in a sharper
 tone that such violations would meet with "st'cong condemnation"
 from the world's people.
 After routinely citing the Vietnamese communists' "unremitting
 efforts" to abide by the peace agreement, the Commentator article
 focused on alleged Saigon violations of the cease-fire, delay in
 returning civilian prisoners, and impediments to the formation
 of a national council.  In contrast, the United States came in
 for only brief criticism on the grounds that it has not strictly
 carried out unspecified commi_Lwents and "allows" Saigon to
 violate the agreement.  Commentator thus watered down the charges
 in the 3 April editorial, which accused the United Stat""r of having
 "supported" the Saigon v-_olatians and went on to dcnoune  specific
 U.S. actions ranging from the delay in the removal of mines to
 the bombing of Cambodia.  'ihough the recent Vietnamese statements
 once again charged U.S. infractions in Laos and Cambodia as well
 as in Viet-s'n, the Commentator article strictly limited its
 observations to Vietnam.

 Characteristically, Peking sidestepped criticism of U.S. intentions
 while accusing Saigon of not wanting a s..nble peace and of haiing
 no intention of supporting genuine self-determination,  Only
 Saigon was accused of "acting perfid'ously" and not keeping its
 word.  The Vietnamese statements, in contrast, hat! cited the
 "Nixon Doctrine" in takirg critical note of Washington's alleged
 intention to maintain U.S. "neocolonialism" in the area.  Though
 NCNA duly carried the texts of the official Vietnamese statements,
 its replays of lower-level comment, including e 1 August NHAN
 DAN editorial on the agreement, deleted all references to U.S.
 intentions and to the Administration by name.  NCNA also omitted
 the editorial's reference to continued U.S. aid for Vientiane and
 Phnom Penh as well as U.S. use of air bases in Thailand.
 Cautiously stating Peking's position on the Vietnam question,
 the Commentator article said the Chinese "resolutely support"
 the Vietna-nese people's "j-:st struggle and righteous demands,"
 and it called on both the United States and Saigon to implement
 the Paris agreement and the joint communique.  Commentator directed
 specific demands only to Saigon, howev?,r.
 DRV SCORES NIXON LETTER, U.S. PO'TCIES ON MINE REMOVAL, AID
 Hanoi comment reflects DRV d:!.ssatisfaction with U.S. implementation
 of its obligations under tae peace agreement and the 13 June joint
 communique, but the United States is still treated with
 circumspection.  A NHAN DAN editoria:, assailed President Nixon's
 3 August letter to Congress on the 1.5 August deadline for a
 halt to U.S. bombing in Indochina.  But it responded only
 indirectly to his warning that a DRV offensive would prompt
 appropriate U.S. action.   The editorial, on the 5th, did not
 quote the letter on this point; instead, it vaguely accused the
 Administration of "casting blame on the DRV and making threats
 against us."  It went on to assert that the Vietnamese are resolved
 to :ajecL and condemr the U.S. allegations and to "smash and punish
 ;ill acts of agc'ession and intervention by the U.S. imperialists
 against our fatherland."
 Continuing Hai,oi charges that the United States is failing to
 live up to its obligations under the peace 1greements were voic.ar'
 authcritatively in b 6 August statement by the DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman, responding to statements by U.S. off!;;ials on
 the clearing of mines fr-m DRV waters and the U.S.-Di:t`/ economic
 consultations.

 MINE CLEARING     Echoing earlier news reports, the spokesman
 rejected the 3 August statement by Rear Admiral.
 McCauley that the DRV had hindered minesweeping efforts.  It also
 reiterated the charge, first leveled in the 31 July DRV Foreign
 Ministry statement, that the United States has failed to meet
 its obligations because it has not "removed" deactivated mines
 nor provided necessary means for sweeping mines on inland waterways.
 The U.S. obligation to provide "adequate and sufficient" means
 for sweeping DRV rivers was reaffirmed in the 13 June joint
 communique and Hanoi does not now indicate the nature of the
 stumbling --lock in implementing this provision..  A DRV Foreign
 Ministry spokesman in a press conference on 1 March had complained
 that the United States hi.~d offered equipment to sweep the rivers
 but had withhcid necessary means to transport the equipmen;..
 In raising the demand for the mines to be removed, Hanoi appears
 to be pressing a more controversial issue which has rarely been
 spelled out.  The statement by the foreign ministry spokesman at
 hia I March press conference was unusually specific in assailing
 the United States for failing to supply the means to "remove"
 ::'_nes and to survey remaining mines.  The Paris agreement stated
 thac the United States would "remove, permanently deactivate or
 destroy" mines in DRV territorial waters; and its protocol on
 the m4-c= specified that "on t-.? request" of the DRV, mines shall
 be "removed or destroyed" and that when their removal or destruction
 is impossible they shall be "permanently deactivated and their
 e,uplacement clearly marked."  The 13 June communique was much
 less specific, merely committing the Ur.tted States to mine
 "clearance."  Since the signing of the 13 June communique, the
 question of mine removal was raised in a 2 July Hanoi broadcast
 which defined the communique's reference to mine-clearing operations
 to include "mine removal."
 U.S. AID     The 6 August spokesman's statement also scored remarks
 by a State Department spokesman on the 3d that the
 United States would provide no reconstruction assistance to the
 DRV until Hanoi fully observed the cease-fire in Indochina and
 Congress appropci.at.c'd the money.  while attacking the United
 States for seeking to prucrastin;tte and set preconditions for
 ita assistanc.,  he DRV spokesman was not as forthright as a
 5 August NHAN DA,1 commentary which asserted that the United
 States "may not pose preconditions" for assistance or link
 it to "the situation elsewhere."

 Vietnamen  credentials in communist relations and theory, the

 WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL.  Reflecting the climate of East-West de,.ente,
 the 10th World Youth Festival, held in East Berlin from 28 July
 to 5 August and attended by some 25,000 g?iests from 140 countries,
 encountered no serious disruption and ended with an "appeal" which
 refrained from naming the United States in its attacks on "imperialism."
 By contrast, the 9th festival held in Sofia in the summer of 1968
 had been wracked by controversy over the developing Czechoslovak
 crisis.  At the start o 2 this year's festival, GDR media predictably
 alleged that West. German youth groups planned to disrupt the affair
 and subsequently complained about "distorted" reports on the festival
 in the West. German press.  The absence of a PRC youth delegation was
 decried in a Moscow broadcast in Mandarin on 25 July and similar
 complaints appeared in the GDR and Hungarian press.  On the death
 of Walter Ulbricht on 1 August, the GDR regime promptly announced
 the deceased leader's last wish for the "successful completion" c,::
 the festival and delayed the funeral ceremony until the 7th--well
 after the close of the festival.
 SOVIET FAMILY SUBSIDIES:  In the July issue of OUR CONTEMPORARY
 the foremost Soviet demographer Viktor Perevedentsev has proposed
 readjusting wage scales to encourage larger families.   Arguing that
 the present low birthrate requires "sharp activization of demographic
 policy," he urged subsides for each child to counteract the present
 trend.  Noting that the "main objection" to such subsidies would
 be the cost to the state, he explained that the money could be
 raised from the wage fund by diverting funds for future wage
 increases to subsidies f,r larger families.  Perevedentsev claimed
 that his propoe?l would eliminate the need for the current tax on
 unmarried persons and childless families and would be preferable
 to restoring the ban cn abortion.  Perevedentsev's proposals are
 consistent with other recent measures, such as the enactment of
 subsidies for children in low-income families, to meet the
