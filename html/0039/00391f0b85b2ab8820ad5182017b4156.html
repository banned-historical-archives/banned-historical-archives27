 China: The Political Year in Review
 Summary
 The past year has been a turbulent one in Chinese politics,
 punctuated by the student demonstrations last December, the dramatic fall
 from power of party General Secretary Hu Yaobang in January and the
 subsequent surfacing of sharp differences over reform policies.  Hu's
 downfall left Deng Xiaoping's succession plans and power-sharing
 arrangements in disarray.  Both reformers and their more conservative
 critics among party elders have worked hard since then to gain the upper
 hand, seeking to put their stamp on the outcome of the 13th Party
 Congress now scheduled to open 25 October. This sparring, however, has
 been largely inconclusive. As a result, we expect the congress to end in a
 standoff. Although Deng is likely to gain some key personnel changes,
 including the installation of Zhao as party General Secretary, and an
 ideological document endorsing market-oriented reforms, we believe the
 conservatives will hold their own. Indeed, the reformers appear to have
 conceded that they will not be able to introduce any new systemic

 changes, such as price reform in 1988. Whether the reformers eventually
 regain the initiative will depend heavil  on how well Zhao does in his new
 role as party leader.
 Thus far, the infighting has not spilled over into the conduct of
 China's foreign policy, which enjoys a broader consensus.  Beijing
 therefore will probably continue to seek better relations with both Moscow
 and Washington to enhance China's security and bolster its modernization
 drive. In response to Gorbachev's efforts to court Beijing, the Chinese
 increased political as well as economic contacts last year with the Soviets
 and even agreed to resume Sino-Soviet border talks, which had been
 suspended since 1978.  But on balance, China continues to maintain
 friendlier relations with the United States than with the Soviet Union,
 exemplified by strengthening military ties that included last fall's US naval
 port call to China--the first since the present government took control.
 China's reformers were riding high early last year after scoring impressive
 victories over their conservative opponents, but a combination of political
 miscalculations and economic problems subsequently sapped the political strength of
 the reformers and slowed the pace of reform. The early hopes of some of the most
 progressive reformers that major political reforms would be undertaken have evaporated
 in the face of strong resistance from party elders and in the wake of the fall from power
 of party General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
 Friction between conservatives and reformers mounted throughout 1986 over a
 broad range of issues--political reform, ideology, economic policy, succession
 arrangements, even patronage jobs. We believe the reformers overreached last year
 when they had the upper hand, miscalculating the strength of the conservatives and
 badly underestimating the alarm and opposition that aggressive reform policies would
 arouse. The crucial miscalculation apparently occurred in late summer, when Hu
 Yaobang pressed Deng and other party elders to step down and make room for their
 successors--including, of course, Hu. These tensions were reflected in a document on
 ideology issued by a party plenum in September. Not only was the document issued
 without the usual claims of unanimous agreement, its contents were an uneasy marriage

 Issues of both policy and power continue to separate the two camps:
 ? Party control is at the heart of many policy quarrels. Conservatives fear that
 some reform proposals threaten the party's dominance and even its ability to
 guarantee political and social stability.
 ? Ideology remains a contentious area, with conservatives arguing that some
 reformist suggestions--for example leasing or selling small industrial enterprises
 to individuals--not only would weaken party control but are an unacceptable
 departure from socialist doctrine.
 ? Disagreements over succession arrangements have heated up as Deng has lost
 confidence in the younger leaders.  Party elders, reluctant to give up their
 positions, have argued that it would be unwise for Deng--and themselves--to
 completely retire and turn power over to a new generation.
 ? Personnel appointments have been a source of friction; conservatives resented
 Hu's success in monopolizing patronage and freezing out their supporters.  Since
 January, conservatives have succeeded in petting some of their candidates
 Conservative criticism of reform policies received a boost when reformers
 encountered problems in the economic area--inflation, a growing budget deficit, foreign
 exchange shortages--that forced a slowdown in implementation of economic reforms.
 Conservatives had warned against some of these problems, which lent weight to their
 arguments that reform had moved too fast and it was time to retrench.  Moreover, the
 student demonstrations in December, which were encouraged by the liberal rhetoric of
 the spring, aroused fears of instability and lent credence to conservative arguments that
 excessive liberalization was undermining party control.
 The marked conservative shift has been moderated somewhat since last May.
 We believe the turning point came when some conservative leaders overplayed their
 hand and attempted to push the "anti - bourgeois liberalization" campaign into the
 economic sphere. Deng moved against this threat to his reforms, and the balance
 began to shift. Ideological pronouncements once again praise reform and promise
 continued experimentation, but they are still careful to stress the socialist nature of
 reforms--providing an opening for conservative pressure.
 Recent evidence indicates that Deng and his allies have had to settle for a
 patchwork of compromises that includes a Politburo younger in average age but evenly
 balanced between reformers and conservatives. While reformers have made some gains
 in staffing party organs, conservative influence on economic policy making has
 increased.  Political structural reform--a reformist code term for further reduction of
 party influence over government and economic decision making--seems stalled at the
 general discussion" stage. In the months after the congress, we look for continued
 tensions and jockeying for power as leaders, including recently "retired" party elders
 seek to consolidate their positions and press their advantages.

 view, as age will erode the ranks of prestigious party elders.
 Perhaps the single most important issue will be how Zhao Ziyang proves himself
 in his new position as party head. Zhao has many advantages--he is respected by both
 sides, has a generally successful record as premier, and has a personal political style
 much better suited to Chinese politics than was the abrasive Hu Yaobang's.  He also has
 Deng Xiaoping's support, crucial to his success but a two-edged sword--he will have to
 find a way to establish himself as heir without alienating Deng. On the down side, Zhao
 is constrained by the continued influence of powerful conservative elders; he also has a
 decisionmaking machinery not entirely of his own choosing and not entirely in sympathy
 with his ideas.  Ironically, this is especially true in economic policy bodies that Zhao
 once dominated. Finally, Zhao as party chief must deal with sensitive and messy issues
 such as the party's role under reform, or the ideological legitimacy of progressive
 economic proposals, that, as premier, he generally tried to avoid.  If Zhao successfully
 manages the next few months, however, the long-term advantage is with him, in our

 avionics packages for $500 million and $2 million worth of artillery-locating radars.
 Despite Gorbachev's increased efforts to court Beijing, Chinese leaders probably
 will continue for both economic and security reasons to seek stronger ties to the United
 States.  Indeed, Beijing still regards the United States as an important strategic shield
 against Soviet military pressure as well as a key market for Chinese exports and source
 of investment capital and technology.  No single element better illustrates the qualitative
 difference between Sino-Soviet and Sino-US relations at present than the stregthening
 military ties between Beijing and Washington. Over the past few years, senior Chinese
 and US military officials have exchanged numerous visits. Last year was marked by
 several particularly important events, including the exchange of visits by China's Chief of
 General Staff and Secretary of Defense Weinberger. China also contracted for 55 fighter
 line while seeking better relations with both Moscow and Washington.
 As long as Deng Xiaoping remains in charge, we do not expect any sudden,
 dramatic changes in China's foreign policy. Deng and Zhao have gone to some pains
 since Hu Yaobang's ouster to reassure Western governments and investors on that
 score. In general we believe China will continue to tout its "independent foreign policy"

 could also seize on the sharp drop in new foreign investment last year--US investment
 The resurgence of conservative influence, however, may have some influence on
 Sino-US economic relations.  Beijing, for example, could adopt a more selective
 approach to joint venture schemes with Western firms as well as a more restrictive
 policy toward allowing Chinese students to study in the West. The Chinese may also
 turn more to the Soviets and East Europeans for equipment and services, in part to save
 scarce foreign exchange, and may become more prickly in general on trade issues. The
 conservatives could conceivably press for some retaliatory action, for example, if the US
 Congress enacts strong protectionist measures that cut Chinese textile exports to the
 United States--an increasingly important earner of foreign exchange. The conservatives

 In any case, we expect Sino-Soviet trade and scientific and technical exchanges
 to increase. Trade in 1986 shot up to an estimated $2.4 billion, and the Soviets have
 agreed to renovate 17 Chinese factories and construct seven new facilities--most in
 northeastern China--that probably will lead to several hundred Soviet technicians going
 to China.  Overall, however, the Soviet Union remains a distant sixth among China's
 trading partners, well behind Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, and Wes       can
 states, which account for over 80 percent of China's trade.
 Although the Sino-Soviet political dialogue has similarly expanded to include
 border talks (suspended in 1978), the Chinese continue to take a cautious approach to
 .Soviet overtures--in part to avoid alarming the United States and its Western allies as
 well as Japan. As a result, they continue to emphasize the need for Moscow to adopt
 more accommodating policies on the "three obstacles"--Moscow's support for Hanoi's
 occupation of Cambodia, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Soviet military
 buildup along China's northern border--which Beijing continues to define as threats to
 its security. The Chinese remain adamant that Moscow withdraw its support for
 Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. At the same time, they continue to support the
 Cambodian insurgents as well as the Afghan rebels as a means of keeping the Soviets
 and their allies on notice. The Chinese also continue to press Washington to initiate a
 dialogue with North Korea to limit Moscow's ability to exploit tensions on the peninsula.
 Finally, China's relations with Japan have been strained over the past several
 months. The Chinese have charged that Japan is following a "two Chinas" or "one
 China, one Taiwan" policy, rekindling militarism, and persisting in unfair trade and
 technology restrictions.  Beijing may cool its rhetoric, but has already begun diversifying

 China's Economy:  Policy and Performance in 1987
 Summary
 Much of China's economic reform program has been stalled this
 year by political infighting and economic problems. Hu Yaobang's ouster
 as party General Secretary last January weakened the reform coalition, and
 conservative party officials took advantage of reformers' disarray to press
 for a less ambitious policy agenda that emphasizes greater reliance on
 central planning. Although China's economy has grown rapidly in 1987,
 rising prices and financial deficits have undercut reformers' ability to
 justify new market-oriented policies.  Despite recent public assertions by
 Deng Xiaoping and Acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyarig that Beijing will
 quicken the pace of economic reform later this fall, we believe that
 Chinese leaders have agreed to a cautious, lowest-common-denominator
 policy to improve enterprise performance. Therefore, price and several
 other key reforms are likely to remain stalled.

 Intense Policy Debate
 Contention over economic policy in China has been intense since Hu Yaobang
 was forced to resign in January. The Chinese media this year have aired sharply
 divergent views on economic policy which, we believe, reflect deep divisions among
 China's senior leaders over the extent and pace of market-oriented reforms.  For several
 months following Hu's ouster, for instance, the press highlighted statements by
 conservatives asserting the importance of the party in economic decision making in
 factories and advocating "plain living and arduous struggle" by workers to build a
 modern China. These officials also reportedly attacked as "capitalist" such reforms as
 reducing central planning, selling stock in state enterprises, leasing factories to
 individuals, and allowing rural income disparities to widen as peasants take advantage of
 increased autonomy over planting decisions.  Beginning in May, reformers
 counterattacked, arguing that China's low level of economic development justifies an
 Accounts in the Hong Kong media indicate that China's uneven economic
 performance so far this year has fueled the debate between reformers and
 conservatives.  Industrial output has increased at a 15-percent annual rate--reflecting
 strong growth in key sectors such as electric)-power generation and steel, and
 double-digit growth for consumer durables including refrigerators, bicycles, and color
 televisions. Growth has been spurred by a surge in investment spending by state
 enterprises. Competition for raw materials for industry and demand for consumer
 goods, however, have outstripped supplies, pushing prices up at an 8-percent annual
 rate in June--high by China's standards. Moreover, the Chinese press has noted that
 product quality remains poor and inventories of unsalable goods continue to rise. F_
 To complicate matters, increased investment and wage payments are contributing
 to the declining profitability of state enterprises--Chinese statistics show enterprise
 losses rising at about a 25-percent annual rate, and more than one-fifth of state-owned
 industrial enterprises have recorded deficits this year. Increased state subsidies, to
 deficit enterprises will push the government budget deeper into the red.
 Economic performance in the countryside has bolstered reformers' arguments to
 some degree, because the output of nonstaples and rural industries has increased
 rapidly this year. However, Beijing's deliberate efforts to diversify agriculture--allowing
 peasants to sell vegetables and meats at higher prices and to leave farming to start
 rural businesses--have dampened peasants' interest in growing grain. This year
 production of grain--a politically critical staple--will fall far short of its 3.5-percent
 growth target, according to the Chinese press.
 News on the foreign trade front is equally mixed. Beijing has continued last
 year's effort to trim the foreign trade deficit, slashing it by almost 70 percent in the first
 9 months of 1987. Although central government holdings of foreign exchange increased

 The Conservative Critique
 Conservatives have cited China's inflation, excessive investment, budget deficits,
 and foreign exchange shortfalls to criticize reformers for economic mismanagement,
 arguing that relaxed central controls are responsible for the economic dislocations.
 They are probably particularly alarmed by State Statistical Bureau figures showing that
 China's inflation rate has increased each month since April.  Conservatives may argue
 that social stability is jeopardized because living standards for about one-fifth of urban
 workers have fallen this year;  wage gains for some workers have not kept pace with

 particularly by allowing state factories to retain a larger share of their
 revenues and permitting them to sell overquota production of industrial goods at
 "negotiated," above-plan prices.   However, it has not implemented effective measures to
 make enterprise managers accountable if funds are used inefficiently.
 Judging from past responses to economic problems, we believe conservatives
 want to strengthen administrative controls over economic decision making and increase
 reliance on central plans. Conservatives would also like to lessen enterprise discretion
 over investment, and tighten controls over prices, wages, land use in the countryside,
 Reformers' Response
 Since market-oriented reforms were launched in 1979, proponents have
 overridden the practical and ideological objections of conservatives by arguing that
 monetary and fiscal policies can guide the economy when central controls are relaxed,
 and by insisting that reforms be judged by their ability to produce results rather than by
 their conformity to dogma. Consequently, reform leaders have been vulnerable to
 conservative criticism when the economy has performed poorly. It is thus no
 coincidence that in recent weeks reformers have orchestrated an intense media barrage
 to deflect attention from the conservatives' critiques, recounting improvements in the
 standard of living, economic growth, product variety, and other reform successes over
 While conservatives argue that the economy's problems derive from the fast pace
 of reform, reformers believe that dislocations result--in part--from piecemeal
 implementation. For example, reformers argue that Beijing should substitute the threat
 of bankruptcy for the certainty of state subsidies to motivate enterprise managers to
 control investment spending and wage increases. To reformers, more policy
 flexibility--not greater central control--is the appropriate long-run solution to economic

 Political infighting this year, however, has prevented reformers from effectively
 using monetary and fiscal policies to ease inflationary pressure.  Beijing has been
 unable, for example, to stop spending by local governments on low-priority construction
 projects, such as hotels and municipal halls:
 ?  Branches of China's central bank are ignoring head-office directives to limit credit
 and continue to fund whatever projects local officials want.
 ?  Previous reforms gave local governments a greater share of tax revenues, making
 them less dependent on funds from central coffers.
 The Clampdown on Prices
 According to Hong Kong journals and diplomatic reports, since the early 1980s
 China's top leaders have feared the sort of public uprising that occurred in
 Poland when food price hikes contributed to the growth of the Solidarity trade
 union movement. With the release of the economic performance statistics for
 the first half of the year and the ensuing debates about policy, senior leaders
 decided to implement an across-the-board freeze on prices and to tighten
 restrictions on investment spending. Chinese press reports indicated that the
 price freeze was in response to widespread consumer complaints about rising
 prices, particularly of food:
 ? In late August, Beijing ordered prices of consumer goods, including
 foodstuffs, frozen for the remainder of the year. To accomplish this, it
 authorized local governments to set price ceilings on farm produce sold at
 village markets and on overquota production of industrial goods--thus
 retreating on recent policies that allowed sales at negotiated prices.
 ? Beijing announced that only capital construction projects already approved
 by the central government may be started in the second half of this year.
 And if locally funded investment spending exceeds the targets set earlier
 this year, the excess will be deducted from next year's target and
 responsible officials will be disciplined.
 ? Enterprise managers were ordered to keep wage increases from exceeding
 the growth of industrial productivity--now trailing wage gains by one-half.
 Leaders who are counting on local officials to carry out broader reform objectives have
 rejected proposals to restrict provincial control over bank loans and taxes, according to
 US Embassy contacts. Beijing, therefore, has been forced to reimpose price controls on

 some products and tighten restrictions on how state enterprises can use their retained
 earnings.                                                                             25X1
 Despite the recent backtracking on price reforms, Deng Xiaoping, Acting General
 Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and other reform leaders remain firmly committed to using
 market mechanisms to drive China's modernization. We believe that reformers would
 like to implement a series of related market-oriented policies that are especially
 contentious within the leadership:
 ?  Reformers would like to expand markets for labor, capital, and raw materials so
 that state enterprises could compete on an equal basis and be less dependent on
 upper level economic bureaucracies for supplies. They also would like a
 bankruptcy mechanism to establish market accountability for state enterprises.
 ?  Reformers argue that the state should lease or sell small state enterprises,
 particularly those sustaining losses, to individuals. This not only would ease the
 government's subsidy burden but would make the factories more responsive to
 market forces.  Moreover, they view the expansion of private enterprises as a
 means of absorbing surplus labor.
 ?  Reform leaders call for further commercialization of agriculture. Recent articles
 in the Chinese press argue that, to boost grain production, Beijing should hike
 procurement prices and continue to reduce the amount of grain peasants must
 sell under contract to state supply units.
 Looking Ahead
 Senior Chinese officials have told the US Embassy that China has reached a
 critical juncture in its reform program. They believe that, because living living standards
 have risen rapidly since 1979, workers still strongly support reform.  But these officials
 fear that support will erode unless Beijing can check inflation and corruption. Some
 Chinese bureaucrats, for example, are exploiting loopholes in reform policies by using
 their connections to purchase goods at low in-plan prices and resell them at much
 higher market prices.  Public cynicism toward reform reportedly has begun to grow
 because many of the people involved are the children of senior officials.
 Deng and Zhao have publicly asserted that the 13th Party Congress will signal a
 new phase in China's economic reform effort. They claim that the Congress will
 approve new ideological guidelines sanctioning market-oriented policies and that Beijing
 will hasten implementation of reforms later this year.  However, we believe that, because
 of the sharp split among senior officials over economic policy, the Congress is unlikely
 to provide a detailed account of how Beijing plans to proceed with reform.  Moreover,
 the Congress probably will couch its policy pronouncements in rhetoric that reaffirms
 China's long-term commitment to socialism, thereby watering down its endorsement of

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/30: CIA-RDP04T00907R000300690001-5
 Thus, despite Deng and Zhao's upbeat rhetoric, a cautious agenda for 1988 is
 likely. In a speech at a national planning conference last month, a senior conservative
 spokesman on economic policy argued that Beijing must implement an austerity
 program for several years and focus reform on improving enterprise operations--such
 as expanding the use of enterprise contracts.  Senior Chinese economists have admitted
 to US Embassy officers that getting state factories to sign performance contracts with
 supervisory bureaus will be the focus of reform next year.  Some of these economists
 view the contract system as a lowest-common-denominator policy that runs the risk of
 backtracking on previous reforms because it rewards the bargaining skills of factory
 In our view, Beijing's response to economic problems this year may have set the
 reform program back in another way.  By treating the symptoms of China's economic
 problems--excessive investment spending and price hikes--rather than attacking the
 disease--lack of accountability to market forces--Beijing probably has delayed reaching
 the point when it will have adequate monetary and fiscal tools to moderate the strong
 Status of Key Chinese Industrial Reforms
 Enterprise Management Reform. Beijing is implementing "enterprise
 responsibility systems" in which factories are granted operational autonomy but
 are held responsible for their own profits and losses.  Beijing admits that these
 have been established in only about one-half of state enterprises, and that
 bureaucratic interference in operations is still extensive.  Nevertheless, factories
 now retain a larger share of revenues, have greater discretion over how they
 are used, and can market overquota production at "negotiated," above-plan
 prices.
 ? Debate continues over the role of party secretaries in factories and
 how to prohibit excessive investment spending and wage hikes.
 Price Reform.  Because many prices are little changed from the 1950s, they do
 not reflect supply and demand or the costs of production. Chinese leaders
 realize that forcing enterprises to react to price signals will not improve
 resource allocation if prices do not transmit accurate information about relative
 scarcities. Therefore, in the past three years, Beijing has decontrolled prices of
 nonstaples, such as vegetables and meat; some durable goods, including
 bicycles and refrigerators; and minor consumer goods.

 ?       Leaders are concerned that price reforms, which have contributed to bouts
 of inflation, may stir public discontent. They differ over whether to
 administratively adjust prices or to relax state controls to effect price
 reform.
 Labor Reform. Beijing plans to boost labor productivity by rewarding initiative
 with higher wages and by allowing workers increased say in job placement.
 Last fall, Beijing established guidelines for hiring new workers on fixed-term
 contracts that, if followed, would end lifetime job guarantees for employees in
 state enterprises.  Most managers are still unable to fire unproductive workers,
 however, and they maintain labor harmony by offering across-the-board
 bonuses.
 ?      Large state enterprises are entirely responsible for housing, education,
 health needs of their workers.  Because local authorities object to bearing
 these costs if workers are laid off, Beijing continues to guarantee full
 employment.
 Bankruptcy Reforms. Reform leaders want to increase productivity and
 financial accountability for state enterprises.  Last December, Beijing approved
 trial bankruptcy regulations but implementation has been blocked by political
 infighting.
 ? Orthodox officials believe these reforms are inconsistent with socialism.
 Others argue that managers should not be held accountable for losses as
 long as the price system is irrational and factory decision making is
 subject to bureaucratic interference.
 Ownership Reforms. Last year, Beijing conducted limited experiments with
 leasing small factories to individuals and allowed a few enterprises to issue
 shares to their workers.
 ? Conservatives strongly oppose allowing state enterprises to issue shares
 to workers and believe that private enterprise should be strictly limited.

 China: Foreign Trade in 1987
 Summary
 China will post its fourth consecutive trade deficit in 1987, but
 higher exports and reduced imports will probably shrink the deficit to $4
 billion, one-third the 1986 level; US statistics indicate that China will
 probably have a $3.5 billion surplus with the United States. Major trade
 reforms under discussion in 1986 were put on hold earlier this year, but
 we expect debates over how to ease the burden of state subsidies to the
 trade sector to intensify in 1988. Beijing is considering a variety of
 proposals, including a currency devaluation, new tax incentives structured
 to encourage exports of manufactured goods, and other domestic price
 and enterprise reforms that will increase the financial accountability of
 export-producing enterprises.

 Trade Performance in 1987
 After a rocky start this year, with China's foreign exchange reserves dipping
 below the politically sensitive $10 billion level in January, China's trade sector has
 shown an impressive recovery.  Policies geared toward promoting exports and curbing
 imports have proved effective, the current account deficit has improved, and foreign
 Exports. In the first nine months of the year, Chinese exports grew 24 percent
 to $26.5 billion, according to Chinese Customs statistics.' Significant gains have come
 from the textile sector, where garment shipments increased 33 percent in the first eight
 months.  Sales have tapered off somewhat in the second half of the year, with the filling
 of textile import quotas in many Western countries.  Even so, Beijing has demonstrated
 extraordinary flexibility in switching from garments in filled categories to new products,
 as well as in shifting the final stages of garment construction to offshore facilities in
 such countries as Jamaica and the Northern Marianas Islands. As a result, textile
 exports will probably continue to grow at a modest pace through the end of the year.
 Regarding other categories of goods, rising oil prices have helped boost Chinese
 export earnings from last year's depressed level. Gains have been made in exports of
 nonferrous metals and coal as well. Exports of grains and raw cotton, however, have
 declined by 25 and 30 percent respectively because production has not kept pace with
 the increasing domestic demand for these commodities.
 Imports. Chinese statistics indicate that in the first nine months of the year
 imports declined nearly 4 percent to $29.2 billion. China's purchases stagnated in 1986
 as a result of tightened procedures for allocating foreign exchange and closer
 monitoring of purchases to avoid duplication. This year's decline results primarily from
 a ban on most new import contracts imposed in February. Imports of timber, synthetic
 fiber, iron ore, rolled steel, and aluminum fell by more than one-fifth in the first eight
 months of 1987 compared with the same period in 1986. Sharp increases in imports of
 grains and chemical fertilizers--up 54 and 177 percent respectively--have muted the
 impact of the contract ban, however. Beijing is concerned about its lagging agricultural
 output, and in 1987 will very likely become a net grain importer for the first time since
 Another factor that has muted the impact of the import ban is the time lag
 between contracts and deliveries. Chinese Customs statistics record shipments rather
 than contracts, and shipments of items contracted for before February have continued.
 But, by the same token, import shipments will probably remain sluggish for several
 months after the ban is lifted, which we believe could occur later this year or in early

 Trade Balance. We estimate that last quarter, for the first time in three years,
 China had a small surplus in its merchandise trade balance. A monthly merchandise
 trade surplus was posted in June, July, and August, and September's imports and
 exports, net of services, were roughly equal. Although Beijing will probably record its
 fourth consecutive trade deficit this year, the drop in imports and a surge in exports will
 probably shrink the deficit to roughly a third of the $12 billion posted in 1986.                25X1
 Foreign Exchange Reserves. Improvements in China's current account were
 largely responsible for a $2.7 billion surge in China's foreign exchange reserve holdings
 from January through June, the last month for which data are available, to $12.6 billion.
 China's state-held reserves also increased modestly, from $2.1 billion to $3.4 billion
 during the six-month period.                                                                     25X1
 Total trade will probably exceed $70 billion by yearend, but may fall short of last
 year's level of $73.8 billion.  If so, it will be the first time since 1982 that China's total
 In the first eight months of 1987, as in 1986, China's top five trading partners
 were Hong Kong, Japan, the United States, West Germany, and the Soviet Union. Japan
 dropped from first to second place, however, probably for a number of reasons: Beijing
 has mounted a concerted effort to curb purchases of consumer goods and motor
 vehicles, for which Japan is the major supplier; and China has deliberately sought to
 diversify trading partners as well as "punish" Japan for its large trade surplus with China
 by directing purchases to non-Japanese suppliers. China continues to hold its largest
 bilateral trade deficit with Japan, but we expect Beijing will be able to narrow the gap
 Although Sino-Soviet trade has grown rapidly since the signing of a bilateral
 economic accord in July 1985, trade between the two countries may decline slightly in
 1987, in part because China is unhappy with the quality of Soviet technology and
 equipment being offered for a number of joint renovation and construction projects
 Chinese and US bilateral trade statistics vary widely, primarily because of
 differences in the way the countries tally shipments through Hong Kong and other third
 countries.? The United States counts transshipments by their country of origin and their
 2 Although discrepancies frequently exist in trade partner data, the United States is the
 only major trading partner for which Chinese statistics have shown consistently
 higher figures for imports and lower values for exports.  Besides differences in the
 recording of transshipments, the countries use different methods to determine the
 value of traded goods, varying in the inclusion of insurance and some transportation
 expenses. Differences in currency-conversion ratios and in the accounting methods
 used for leased equipment and service payments, as well as time lags in recording
 trade flows, have contributed to the discrepancies.

 final destination.  China, in contrast, records US-bound exports shipped through Hong
 Kong as exports to the colony, and enters US-origin imports shipped through Hong
 Kong as purchases from the island.  Discrepancies in trade statistics are growing,
 because a larger share of bilateral trade is being shipped through Hong Kong in 1987
 than in 1986:
 ? In 1986, according to Chinese Customs statistics, China had a $2.1 billion deficit
 with the United States.  Projections for 1987 indicate a $1 billion Chinese deficit
 with the United States is likely.  Moreover, Chinese statistics suggest that total
 bilateral trade will drop from $7.3 billion in 1986 to $6.4 billion this year, primarily
 because of a drop in Chinese purchases of US goods.
 ? In contrast, US statistics indicate that the more than $2 billion imbalance was
 actually a Chinese surplus, and projections based on US statistics suggest a $3.5
 billion Chinese surplus for the year.  US figures also project that bilateral trade
 will increase from $8.4 billion in 1986 to roughly $9.7 billion in 1987, and that
 stepped-up Chinese exports to the United States account for most of this
 US imports from China are heavily concentrated in relatively few categories of
 goods.   US statistics indicate that clothing and textile yarn and fabrics made up nearly
 half of US purchases in the first half of 1987. US exports are less concentrated, but the
 top three categories--aerospace equipment, fertilizers, and grains--nonetheless
 accounted for about 30 percent of US sales during the first seven months of the year.
 China's imports of US grains increased sixteen-fold durin  the period, while purchases
 of fertilizers more than quadrupled.
 China's Evolving Foreign Trade Regime
 Beijing's management of foreign economic relations has prompted considerable
 debate in recent years. Arguments between conservative and reform-minded Chinese
 officials over trade administration have centered on the appropriateness of central
 versus local control, and the use of administrative controls--licenses and
 quotas--versus economic levers such as tariffs and prices. As a result, changes in
 China's trade structure have tended to occur fairly frequently, and the current system is
 a hybrid that combines elements of central and decentralized administration.  Direct
 controls and indirect levers also operate simultaneously. For example, in recent years
 Beijing has expanded the use of licenses and quotas to regulate exports of products that
 are subject to Western restrictions and to curb Chinese imports of nonessential
 consumer goods and equipment that can be produced indigenously. At the same time,
 it has experimented with adjustments to Customs duties, prices, and foreign exchange
 and tax remittances by exporters and export-producing enterprises.
 Concerns about the level of China's foreign exchange reserves prompted Beijing
 to stiffen central controls over foreign exchange allocation, contract signing, and foreign
 borrowing in early 1987. Reforms of the country's foreign trade system that had been

 Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2012/05/30: CIA-RDP04T00907R000300690001-5
 under discussion in 1986--which would have increased the autonomy of Chinese trade
 corporations while making them accountable for foreign exchange profits and
 losses--were put on hold.  In place of the broader trade reforms, Chinese leaders began
 to discuss implementation of the "contract management responsibility system," under
 which trade corporations would sign annual agreements with the Ministry of Foreign
 Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) specifying the foreign exchange the corporation
 would be expected t      , as well as the portion to be turned over to the Ministry. C
 Many Chinese trade officials, however, view the contract system as at best an
 interim measure that forces MOFERT to shoulder the burden of gaps between
 international prices and irrational state-set domestic prices, and we believe that
 favorable trade figures for yearend 1987 will rekindle discussions of how best to reform
 the trade sector. We expect that debates next year over foreign trade management will
 focus on how to ease the burden of state subsidies to the trade sector, which have
 contributed to the increase in China's budget deficit.  Indeed, the shift has already
 become apparent in discussions US diplomats have held with Chinese trade and finance
 officials, as well as in articles appearing in the Chinese press.
 According to diplomatic reporting, officials from China's Ministry of Finance and
 the People's Bank of China advocate currency devaluation to narrow the gap between
 domestic and export prices. Their views have been countered by other economists who
 contend that a devaluation would merely shift subsidies from exports to imports, since
 state subsidies would be needed to soften the impact of higher import prices for
 essential items. Instead of a devaluation, MOFERT advocates the replacement of
 subsidies--which tend to encourage exports of primary products--with a system of tax
 incentives structured to encourage exports of higher value-added goods.  Under the
 proposed tax system, the state would still bear the costs of the irrational domestic price
 structure, but it would be encouraging exports of items whose domestic prices more
 closely approximate international levels.  Beyond tax reforms, MOFERT officials have also
 been strong proponents of domestic enterprise and price reforms, arguing that without
 them efforts to make foreign trade corporations responsible for their profits and losses

 China's External Debt
 Summary
 From 1983 to 1986 China nearly tripled its foreign debt to $25
 billion, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates. Beijing,
 however, does not have a consolidated record of its borrowings. Indeed,
 the government only recently expanded the responsibilities of the State
 Administration for Exchange Control to include estimating the debt and
 monitoring and regulating all foreign borrowing.
 Our own research suggests that the debt may be slightly higher
 than the IMF figures.  Much of it is in costly short-term loans or
 denominated in yen--a currency that has appreciated against the Yuan 175
 percent in the last three years. Beijing has sought advice from Western
 financial experts on how to improve its borrowing strategy and plans to
 lower borrowing costs by relying more on concessionary loans. But
 because of competition for concessionary loans among developing
 countries, we believe that Beijing will have to rely increasingly on

 commercial loans--including those from the United States. Although
 China's borrowing may dip slightly this year from the $5.6 billion of 1986,
 we believe it will return to at least that level in 1988 judging from Beijing's
 We believe that China's debt is well within serviceable limits.
 China's low, 15- to 20-percent debt service ratio is favorable when
 compared with those of other developing nations. To maintain this
 favorable credit rating as the debt grows, however, Beijing will have to
 follow through effectively with its plans to more closely monitor its
 In the past three years, China has experienced an unprecedented rise in its
 overseas debt, which reached nearly $25 billion at yearend 1986, according to IMF
 estimates (see table 1). The rise largely resulted from trade liberalization instituted late
 in 1984 that allowed some enterprises and local governments to buy foreign, goods and
 to borrow overseas directly. Local authorities turned directly to foreign banks to finance
 the burgeoning trade deficit that resulted, and outstanding bank debt more than doubled
 25X1
 By late 1985, Beijing had serious concerns    ut the rapid rise in debt. Much of
 the increase,                                 had been in costly short-term debt 25X1
 that required frequent rollover.  Further, we believe that over half was denominated in
 yen, which was appreciating against the yuan, making the loans much more expensive to
 repay. Accordingly, the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90), approved in early 1986,
 called for less foreign borrowing and more centralized control over foreign exchange
 and foreign loans. Earlier this year, IMF officials warned Chinese officials that China's
 "external debts are no longer light, its debt structure is irrational, and its debt
 management is not well coordinated."                                                   25X1

 Profiling China's Debt
 China's official reports of its foreign debt have consistently been lower than
 Western estimates. At yearend 1986 the official Chinese estimate was $20.7 billion,
 while estimates from Western banks and international financial organizations ranged
 from $24.9-28.1 billion. We believe the debt lies closer to the upper range of the
 Western estimates. Available data also indicate that the People's Bank of China's
 statistics have understated short-term trade credits, the liabilities of overseas branches
 of the Bank of China, and loans to Sino-foreign joint ventures., Chinese statistics also
 do not fully reflect recent exchange rate adjustments and thus significantly undervalue
 China's sizable yen-denominated debt. With the compartmentalism of the Chinese
 bureaucracy, in any case, Beijing does not have a consolidated record of all the
 The People's Bank of China acts as the nation's central bank, with responsibility for
 functions such as controlling the money supply and monitoring foreign exchange.

 engage in foreign exchange transactions and international account settling for foreign

 Composition of the Debt.  Because Beijing strives to keep the cost of borrowing
 as low as possible, we believe China's borrowings at concessional rates may be as
 much as one-quarter of the total. China has received Overseas Development Assistance
 (ODA) loans or trade credits from 17 nations. ODA disbursements are slow, however,
 and less flexible than commercial loans, because they are usually tied to specific
 infrastructure projects and, sometimes, to specific suppliers.  Even on commercial loans,
 Chinese borrowers press foreign banks for interest rate concessions or for help in
 arranging offsetting countertrade deals to reduce their hard currency repayment
 obligations.  Most foreign lenders have been slow to accept these conditions.               25X1
 Bonds have been a growing source of funds for China.  Since 1982, Chinese
 borrowers have raised almost $2 billion in Tokyo and other Asian bond markets, but
 have made little headway in tapping bond markets outside Asia (see table 2).  Until
 recently, China was blocked from using the London and US capital markets because of
 its refusal to honor foreign debts incurred before the overthrow of the Nationalists in
 1949. However, in June Britain signed an agreement with China settling its historical
 claims, and last March a US court decision cleared the way for China to borrow in the
 United States. In late September, the Bank of China (BOC) issued bonds worth $200
 million in London. This may have been a way of testing the waters before a
 commitment in the US market. Although bonds are not required to be rated in the
 London market, Beijing may be hoping that sales there will indicate probable future
 ratings in the United States. China's access to the US and London financial markets,
 which are the world's largest, will help it diversify its bonds away from yen--a currency
 that has appreciated against the yuan 175 percent in the last three years.
 In addition to over half of its debt being denominated in yen, China's borrowings
 have been largely short term. The IMF estimated at yearend 1985 that as much as 56
 percent of China's debt was short term in contrast to 25 to 30 percent for most
 developing nations. The short-term debt was taken on during China's trade
 decentralization, as individual entities financed imports with 90-day paper, reportedly
 expecting the central government to pay when the loans came due. Although Beijing
 consistently had reserves worth three to six months of imports, it did not pay off the
 enterprises' debts, which then had to be constantly rolled over.
 Chinese financial institutions are also experimenting with new forms of raising
 ? Chinese banks in Hong Kong have issued certificates of deposit (CDs) in Hong
 Kong dollars and US dollars.
 ? Enterprises have issued commercial paper in Hong Kong dollars and yen.
 ? Chinese banks have been underwriting Australian dollar CDs in Hong Kong.

 Disposition of Borrowed Funds. The Chinese generally allocate borrowed funds
 according to their source.  Chinese officials have said that yen loans are generally tied
 to the energy and communications sectors; soft World Bank loans are spent for health,
 education, and agriculture; hard World Bank loans underwrite long-term infrastructure
 projects such as roads and dams; and bilateral loans from Europe are usually mixed
 credits and thus have to be spent in the creditor country.
 Independent reporting on borrowing during 1986 supports this breakdown.
 Almost 60 percent was spent on energy-related projects, though yen loans were not the
 only source of funds for energy projects last year--half were supplied by France for the
 Daya Bay nuclear power plant.  Most syndicated loans were spent on energy, although a
 portion went to finance such "nonproductive" projects as hotels, apartment complexes,
 We cannot identify the end-use for almost a third of 1986 borrrrowing. All of
 China's bond issues and the funds borrowed by the China International Trust and
 Investment Corporation (CITIC) and the Bank of China fall in this category. We believe a
 significant portion was used to refinance short-term obligations and lengthen the
 Improving Debt Management. To quantify China's indebtedness and help
 manage the debt, last year Beijing tasked the State Administration for Exchange Control
 (SAEC) with providing information on China's indebtedness. To create consolidated debt
 figures for China, the SAEC requested assistance from the IMF in designing a debt
 reporting system and linking that system to approvals of external borrowing. Beijing
 also asked for information on problems in other countries resulting from deficiencies in
 debt monitoring and control procedures. Regulations were recently published in China
 requiring borrowers to register all foreign debt and to open a special account for it in
 an approved bank by late September. However, some corporations may have missed the
 September deadline. The SAEC is also investigating institutions using foreign exchange,
 documenting the disposition of foreign exchange, and reporting violations of SAEC
 Meanwhile, organizations such as the World Bank and the New York Stock
 Exchange have given seminars in China to help Beijing improve its borrowing strategy.
 They emphasized practices not currently followed by Chinese borrowers such as
 diversifying markets, maturities, currencies, and instruments, and considering factors
 Chinese officials responded by agreeing to consider refinancing their largely
 short-term, yen-denominated debt through some longer term, dollar-denominated
 borrowings, and during 1986 the proportion of China's debt that is short term is
 estimated by the IMF to have fallen to one-fifth. During the first half of 1987 the
 primary interest of the fund-raising department of the Bank of China has been the
 diversification of funding sources, according to Embassy reporting. The BOC has
 recently begun to focus on the US capital markets and the Euromarkets through London.
 In June, China announced its entry into the US market with a $200 million syndicated
 loan, which was signed in mid-October 1987. Also in mid-October, Beiiing offered $200

 Short Term Prospects for Borrowing
 Beijing's efforts to reestablish control over foreign debt do not signify a shift
 away from foreign capital, in our estimation. A large portion of last year's budget deficit
 of $2 billion--quadruple 1985's--was financed by foreign borrowing. This year's budget,
 presented by Finance Minister Wang Bingqian to the National People's Congress in
 March, forecasts an even larger deficit and proposes a doubling of foreign borrowing to
 help finance it. Although a temporary ban on imports and an improved balance of
 payments for 1987 may alleviate some pressure, the predicted budget deficit will
 probably offset much of these gains, causing China's rate of borrowing in 1987 to be
 If Beijing has its way, China will increase the level and proportion of
 concessionary borrowing.  In the March budget speech, Wang suggested that China
 might seek as much as $3-4 billion in concessionary loans this year. According to
 diplomatic reporting, Beijing has asked Japan to speed up its Overseas Economic
 Cooperation Fund disbursements remaining in the 1984 to 1990 commitment, to grant
 more in its next loan package, and to move up the starting date of that package. Beijing
 has also requested increased World Bank assistance, and we expect it to do the same
 with the Asian Development Bank. But because China has exploited most of the
 available sources of concessional financing and faces fierce competition from other
 developing countries, significant increases in concessional lending will not be
 forthcoming. This suggests that commercial loans will     unt for most of the growth
 in China's foreign borrowing.                                                           25X1
 China's debt service obligations are not a hindrance to future borrowing.
 Beijing officially claims that its debt service ratio stands between 8 and 10
 percent, with the ratio calculated as the annual payment of principal and
 interest as a percentage of total export earnings. Foreign economists have
 estimated that it is in the range of 15 to 20 percent. Recently spokesmen for
 CITIC and the SAEC privately concurred when presented with that range.  More
 important to international bankers than China's debt service ratio is its
 willingness to transfer resources to meet debt payments. For example, last year
 '
 Indonesia
 s debt service ratio ranged up to 40 percent without problems, while
 international bankers considered India's 25 percent very high.
 Accordingly, we believe that China will make a concerted effort to use US
 financial markets and that the United States may become an increasingly important
 source for commercial borrowing in the next few years.
 CITIC is looking into the different financing options in the United States market. Though
 China technically entered the US capital market this year by signing a syndicated loan,
 China has not yet participated in the US bond market, primarily because of the lack of a

 US rating for BOC and CITIC bonds.  It is a matter of some political importance to
 Beijing that the bonds receive a favorable rating. Another obstacle is the detailed
 information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission; we expect Chinese
 bankers to balk at supplying financial information not commonly disclosed in China.
 If Beijing's borrowing policies do not change dramatically, we expect that China's
 modernization plans will lead to a rate of borrowing at least equal to--and probably
 exceeding--the $5.6 billion level reached in 1986. A State Planning Commission (SPC)
 official stated that despite the improved current account, there has been no reduction in
 planned foreign borrowing, and in fact, for the next few years the pace of foreign
 borrowing will be faster. The SPC establishes annual and five-year foreign exchange
 borrowing targets, viewing borrowing not as a means of balancing external payments,
 but as a means of financing construction projects and of making up the shortage of
 domestic investment funds.  Beijing will try to concentrate its concessional borrowings
 on large infrastructure projects in transportation, communications, and energy, and to
 use commercial loans for construction in export industries that generate foreign
