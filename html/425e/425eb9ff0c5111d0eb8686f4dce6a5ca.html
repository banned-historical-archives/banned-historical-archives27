 '[Lieutenant Colonel G.A. Goncharuk article under the rubric "Our Soviet Way of Life":
 "There Is No Such Thing as Other People's Misfortunes" -- first paragraph is editorial
 introduction]
 [Excerpts]  Whenever he has to fill in a form, Lieutenant Colonel Grigoriy Alekseyevich
 Goncharuk enters "1941" in the "year of birth" section.  He was born in October, while
 .our native soil was being trampled by the fascist occupiers.  His father was far away
 .from the family, having donned the soldier's. greatcoat in July.  Years have passed and
 .Grigoriy Goncharuk, the frontline soldier's son, has linked his fate forever with the
 Soviet Army.  He served as chief of the political section of a motor vehicle unit as
 part of the limited contingent of Soviet Forces in Afghanistan.   He has been awarded the
 order "For Services to the Motherland in the USSR Armed Forces," third class.
 "There is no such thing as other people's sorrow" -- this is what my comrade Colonel
 Yevgeniy Yefremovich Litovchenko, with whom I became friends while serving together in
 .Afghanistan, liked to repeat.  And he would invariably add:  "This is an inborn trait
 in our character."
 These words were not just a bombastic sentence for Col Litovchenko.  His father was one
 of 10 brothers.  They all served at the fronts of the Great Patriotic War.  Those who
 survived returned to their home.  They made their way back from Germany and
 Czechoslovakia, having marched across "half of Europe" and "half of the world," visiting
 .Manchuria's volcanoes along the way.
 Time passed, and the surname Litovchenko appeared again in the personnel lists of units
 and ships of the Soviet Armed Forces.  The frontline soldiers were replaced by their
 .sons.  There were occasions when they refined their military skills in the course of
 joint exercises and maneuvers with servicemen from the fraternal armies of Warsaw Pact
 countries.  Just as it happened with the Soviet soldiers who liberated Europe's peoples
 from fascism, the sense of international duty flowed into specific deeds.  It was in no
 'way accidental that Officer A. Litovchenko assisted Vietnamese servicemen in mastering
 new equipment at the request of the Vietnamese people, who had been subjected to
 rapacious attacks by the American aggressors.  Nor was it an accident that 10 years
 later his cousin, Ye. Litovchenko, led motor vehicle convoys with grain and medicines to
 Afghan villages through ambushes by dushman gangs.  This means that Col Litovchenko was
 :speaking forthrightly; internationalism is a hereditary feature in their family.  For
 its members, as for all Soviet people, internationalism has become a conscious feeling
 calling for action.
 u
 .The innermost sources of this noble feeling are rooted in the very nature of the
 socialist system and its highly humane essence.  The ideas of proletarian international-
 ism have been born aloft on our Leninist party's banner from the day of its birth.
 These are the ideas in which generations of Soviet people and Soviet servicemen,
 patriots and internationalists, have been educated.  Their boundless loyalty to
 international duty was manifested with renewed strength during the Great Patriotic War.
 For over a year, Soviet forces fought fierce battles beyond the motherland's borders.
 Over 1 million of our valiant servicemen gave their lives for the liberation of enslaved
 peoples.  This should never be forgotten!
 The postwar period can also provide much convincing evidence of the Soviet people's
 inviolable loyalty to international duty.  Part of it is the selfless assistance to
 fraternal socialist countries in building a new life and repulsing hostile actions by
 imperialism and domestic counterrevolution.  Another part of it. is the utmost support
 for the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle, for the peoples in many liberated countries,
 and much more.

 FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER CONCLUDES VISIT TO PRC
 LD061039 Moscow TASS in English 1033 GMT 6 Sep 85
 [Text]  Beijing, September 6 TASS -- French External Relations Minister Roland Dumas has
 ended his visit to China, during which he met Deng Xiaoping, chairman of the Central
 Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China, and Zhao Ziyang, premier of the
 State Council, and also had talks with Wu Xuequian, minister of foreign affairs of
 China.  During the talks the sides exchanged opinions on the problems of East-West and

 close views of basic international problems."
 Roland Dumas said at a press conference in Beijing that the Chinese side supported
 France's Eureka project.  The external relations minister also said that China expected
 to benefit by that project, in particular, to get more extensive technology supplies
 and technical know-how from Western Europe.  According to him, the Chinese side did
 not raise at the talks the question of French nuclear weapon tests in the Pacific or the
 mining of the Rainbow Warrior ship in New Zealand.
 It was stated that the French side was prepared to give China assistance in its modern-
 ization program, especially in such fields as atomic power engineering, space research,
 transport and communications.

 SOUTH ASIA
 Loyalty to internationalism is manifested in specific deeds. This is particularly
 obvious for us who have served as part of the limited contingent of Soviet Forces in
 Afghanistan.  Let us say, for example, that our drivers have transported equipment for
 the Kheyr Khaneh electric power station and electric lights are now burning in the
 Afghans' homes -- this is nothing but performance of international duty.
 With their selfless assistance, the soldiers and officers in the motor vehicle unit
 where I served from the very first days of my stay in the DRA gained the local popula-
 tion's respect and gratitude.  The hundreds of thousands of national economic cargoes
 which they have transported from the border with the Soviet Union along the difficult
 desert roads and mountain highways to Kabul and other DRA cities and provinces constitute
 a weighty contribution to Afghanistan's economic development, the enhancement of its
 people's prosperity, and its struggle against the counterrevolution.
 The Soviet soldiers will dream for a long time to come of those roads where, in addition
 to steep climbs up hills and descents into valleys, they also came across the vicious
 treachery of hidden enemies.  Our servicemen counter the enemies' schemes and the
 danger for which they are always on the alert with staunchness, courage, and reciprocal
 assistance.
 ...The KAMAZ driven by Junior Sergeant V. Ryashentsev was swept off the road by the
 stream of the mountain torrent which came out of nowhere.  The unconscious driver,
 dragged out of the cab by a stream of stones and dirt, was being swept toward the abyss.
 Private V. Piksin immediately threw himself into the torrent.  At the very edge of the
 precipice he caught the junior sergeant and, fighting the elements, brought him out.
 There are occasions when the motor vehicle transport servicemen have to use their
 weapons to ensure the delivery of civilian cargoes to isolated villages.  On one such
 occasion, for example, the vehicle carrying Lieutenant A. Orlov and driven by Sergeant
 A. Khomovskiy, which was bringing up our convoy's rear, came under dushman fire.  The
 sergeant was wounded, but did not let go of the steering wheel.  Even though he was
 losing blood, he continued driving the vehicle while Lt Orlov provided covering fire for
 the convoy.  For this feat the officer and the sergeant were decorated with orders of
 the Red Star.
 I can proudly say that at times of mortal danger none of our servicemen. are fainthearted.
 Each one of them understands very well that at those moments he stands in full view of
 the motherland and the Soviet people, to whom we have sworn an oath of loyalty before
 the combat banners crowned with immortal glory.  Loyalty until the last heartbeat....
 :Frontline soldiers recall that, even in the fiercest battles, they experienced no
 greater sorrow than when one of their fellow servicemen died.  The dushmans' bullets are
 in no way different from those that were cast in the Krupp plants.  One of them mortally
 wounded Private Mkrtych Sirunyan while he was covering the exit of a motor vehicle convoy
 carrying civilian cargo which had come under fire. The bandit's bullet struck both the
 soldier's heart and the heart of his mother, Laura Sosevna, who lives in Armenia.
 On rereading the letter from Mkrtych's mother, which came to the unit after she had
 received notification of the sorrow which had befallen her, one cannot but bow his head
 before the courage of this woman, a Soviet person in the full sense of the words.
 "I can be proud that I brought up such a son," Laura Sosevna's letter says.  "I will be
 proud of him in the same way as Oleg Koshevoy's and Unan Avetisyan's mothers were proud
 of them.

 SOUTH ASIA
 In the 18 years of his life Mkrtych., whom I will always miss, passed his main test with
 honor, without losing his spirit.  My son's blood was shed on Afghan soil, which I can
 no longer consider foreign...."
 Private M. Sirunyan was posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Star for his feat.
 This award to the soldier is also an award to his mother, a Soviet woman-patriot.
 We commanders and political workers received many letters from the parents of soldiers
 and sergeants serving in our unit. Most of them contained no lofty words,  but more
 often that not expressed a concern for their sons which can be understood by everyone.
 But between the unpretentious, "homely" lines one invariably perceives that our service-
 men's parents profoundly understand the importance and necessity to perform international
 duty.  Boundless loyalty to this lofty duty has for a long time been an inalienable and
 .vivid feature of our Soviet way of life.
 Bourgeois propaganda is trying by all means to misrepresent and defame the Soviet
 serviceman's mission in the DRA.  But, people can tell their friends from the enemies by
 deeds and not by words.  Only a friendly person can act like, for example, Senior
 Lieutenant N. Moroz.  Traveling in a motor vehicle convoy, he saw dushmans plundering
 Afghan vehicles.  The Soviet officer at once hastened to help the victims.
 Another example. An Afghan boy came across a homemade mine and it almost exploded in
 his hands.  Once again a Soviet officer, Mirzoakhmed Alimov, came to help.  He drove the
 boy to a hospital.
 People say that good news travels on wings.  And it is the good news about Soviet people
 which opens the hearts of the Afghans, for whom the purpose of an act is easier to
 understand than cleverly concocted mendacious sentences.
 As a rule, quite a few problems and issues needing joint discussion and solution arise
 among people living in close proximity.  So it is in our relations with the local Afghan
 population.  These sincere and friendly relations are one of the key load-bearing
 components in the structure of Soviet-Afghan friendship.
 Once we organized what we used to call an Afghan-Soviet "jirgah" which was attended by
 .Soviet officers in addition to representatives of state authority and village elders.
 .A businesslike conversation took place, following which there was an improvement in our
 medical assistance to the local population and our participation in ensuring an
 uninterrupted water supply for the village.
 The Soviet soldier in the DRA is primarily a reliable friend, helping the Afghan people
 build a new life.  Not everybody likes our friendship.  Not everybody likes the fact
 .that independent Afghanistan has chosen the path of democratic transformations in its
 development.  This is why there are still explosions on the highways along which our
 motor transport servicemen  convey civilian cargoes to distant settlements.  But the
 Soviet soldiers, loyal to international duty, counter intrigues by the Afghan people's
 enemies with the staunchness and courage inherited from their fathers and grandfathers.
 .Recently I was seen off on my way back home.  It was not only my fellow servicemen who
 saw me off, the village elders also came to say a good word to the "Shuravi" before he
 embarked on the long journey.
