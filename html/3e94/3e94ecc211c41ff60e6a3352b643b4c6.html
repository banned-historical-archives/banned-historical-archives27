 A number of Politburo members, including Party Chair-
 man Hua Kuo-feng, who were uneasy about Teng's rehabilita-

 has not hesitated to punish his opponents.   Hua, Party

 Iisu Hsiang-chien Attacks "Warlordism"
 The Hua regime is evidently still having some serious
 political problems with the military.
 In a long and authoritative article on 19 September,
 Politburo member and Military Commission Vice Chairman
 Hsu Hsiang-chien scolds unnamed military leaders for try-
 ing to parlay their control of forces into unwarranted
 and independent political influence.   This,  in Chinese
 Communist terms,  is "Warlordism."   Hsu implies that fric-
 tion between party and military authorities is interfer-
 ing with. the efficient execution of policy decisions.
 Hsu focuses on two kinds of problems that evidently
 are troubling the army-party relationship.    First, he
 attacks certain political misbehavior which has been
 pervasive for at least the past decade:   "one-man rule,"
 factionalism, and creation of "strongholds." He also
 criticizes leaders who manipulate the party committees
 within their military units by organizing "small groups"
 who "discuss things behind the scenes."   Second, Hsu
 focuses on lapses of political discipline that were ap-
 parently used by the military to good effect against the
 "Gang of Four."  These include "haggling" or negotiating
 over orders, selective compliance with orders or willful
 distortion of insturctions, and plain refusal to obey--
 either through "duplicity"  ("saying yes and meaning no")
 or "sophistry"  (disobedience rationalized on the pretext
 of "resisting erroneous leadership").
 The remedy Hsu prescribes is to revive strict party
 discipline and enforce honesty and candor within the
 party structure in the armed forces.   He also repeats
 Teng Hsiao-ping's call at last month's 11th Party Con-
 gress for strict honesty in party life.   Hsu notes that
 an investigation of the "gang's" activities in the armed
 forces is still going on and that "the individuals and
 incidents" connected with the "gang" will be dealt with.
 He warns that those who persist in the indiscipline of

 the past decade will be admonished, and if they continue
 to be disobedient, "must be disciplined and must not be
 tolerated."
 Clearly, the Politburo would like to eliminate this
 vestige of the Cultural Revolution.   The techniques that
 military leaders used to thwart the Leftists' efforts to
 expand their influence in the armed forces now are avail-
 able for other purposes.   Although Hsu does not even hint
 at who is using these tactics or for what purpose, there
 may be some factional maneuvering around the question of
 who should succeed Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying or
 whether any successor should be chosen at this time.   It
 is also easy to imagine how military factionalism could
 complicate and delay the military modernization program.
 It is doubtful that Hua and his aging military "as-
 sistants" on the Politburo will be able to force some
 military men to become less political.   Events of the
 past decade, especially the circumstances that brought
 Hua to power, have thrust Chinese generals into politics
 to a degree unprecedented since the founding of the PRC.
 The Chinese Army is the single most powerful interest
 group, and the plea to follow party direction by the
 aging and respected Hsu Hsiang-chien raises the inevitable
 question of who in the next generation will have suffi-
 cient stature in the eyes of the military to hold its
 political activity in check.

 The Rocky Road Ahead for Chinese Education
 Since the arrest of the "Gang of Four" in October
 1976, there have been numerous indications pointing to-
 ward major educational reforms.   It is generally as-
 sumed that these reforms, pragmatic steps to depoliti-
 cize education and upgrade its academic content, will
 undo the damage done by the leftist educational poli-
 cies pursued since the Cultural Revolution.   In the
 long run, this assumption may be correct.   But in the
 short run, over the next five or 10 years, it may be
 far too optimistic.   It can be argued that the problems
 facing Chinese education are so numerous and so great
 that they will defy easy and fast solutions.
 Among the most nagging of these problems are the
 small number and poor ability of students.  According
 to the Ministry of Education, there are currently
 584,000 students in Chinese universities.  Although
 this figure is probably higher than in any year since
 the Cultural Revolution, it is far lower than the
 820,000 university students before the Cultural Revolu-
 tion and falls far short of meeting China's needs for
 trained personnel, especially in the sciences.  The
 shortage, moreover,  is even more severe than these
 figures suggest.   Between 1966 and 1970, all universi-
 ties were closed, no students entered or graduated, and
 the education of those in the midst of their college
 careers was stopped.   China thus lost at least four
 years of university graduates.
 Those students who have attended universities since
 1970 have often had little aptitude for higher educa-
 tion.   Since university entrance exams were abolished,
 students have been chosen on the basis of their politi-
 cal reliability and work records rather than their
 academic qualifications.   In addition, because the
 quality of education in primary and secondary schools
 deteriorated after 1966, even capable students often
 have been poorly trained and poorly prepared for col-
 lege.   Since all students, regardless of ability, are

 -equ:ired to spend at least two years working in the
 countryside after graduating from middle school, most
 require remedial work and refresher courses once they
 return to school.
 A second set of problems involves the inadequate
 number and quality of teachers.   During the Cultural
 Revolution, many teachers were persecuted as members
 of the intellectual class.   Others were purged and
 sent to work in the countryside.   Still others left
 their posts to escape the pressures placed on them.
 After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1969, many
 teachers were still required to spend a large part of
 their time away from the classroom, either working in
 factories or on communes or attending political reedu-
 cation classes.   The result has been a shortage of
 qualified teachers, particularly at the primary and
 secondary levels.   Moreover,  since standards at teachers'
 colleges also deteriorated after 1966, many younger
 teachers are poorly trained and often ignorant of basic
 knowledge in their fields.   In some areas,  junior mid-
 dle school graduates have been assigned as teachers in
 middle schools because teachers with higher qualifications
 were unavailable.   The problem has become so severe
 that Chungshan University in Kwangtung Province was re-
 cently obliged to set up a teacher training office to
 teach young teachers basic theory in their fields.
 A third problem is the weak and highly politicized
 curriculum.   For the most part, it is too short and
 pays too little attention to academics to produce first-
 rate graduates.  After the universities reopened in
 1970, courses of study were cut from 4 to 3 years in the
 humanities and social sciences, from 5 to 4 years in the
 sciences, and from 7 to 3 years in medicine.   Graduate
 programs were completely abolished.   In undergraduate
 courses, political courses were favored over academic
 ones.   Many important aspects of education--in particu-
 lar, training in basic theory in the sciences--were
 neglected in favor of subjects which had "practical"
 value.  In addition,  students were required to spend
 large portions of their academic careers working in
 communes or factories.   Exams were abolished, and stu-
 dents were passed routinely from one level to the next
 regardless of their performance or ability.   All this
 produced a graduate ill-suited to the country's needs:

 one who often lacked ability, was unable to reason, and
 was ignorant of basic theory and often even basic knowl-
 edge in his field.
 There are also severe problems with discipline and
 morale.   Since the Cultural Revolution began,  students
 have been encouraged to stand up to and even rebel
 against their teachers.   Teachers and intellectuals in
 general have been intimidated, not only by the conduct
 of their students but by government persecution.    Some
 like the late Minister of Education, Chou Jung-hsin,
 have even been driven to illness and death by the tre-
 mendous pressures placed on them.   As a result, many
 intellectuals and educators have become timid and apa-
 thetic, unwilling to take risks for fear that they
 might be attacked or criticized.   With such attitudes,
 they are unlikely to move forcefully to carry out pro-
 posed educational reforms.
 The demoralization extends to students as well.
 Middle school students wanting to attend college are
 faced with the prospect of spending at least two years,
 and sometimes a lifetime, working in the countryside.
 Because selection for university education has been
 based heavily on political and work records rather
 than academic qualifications,  few have any incentive to
 work hard in school.   The problem is compounded by the
 shortage of prestigious jobs for middle school and uni-
 versity graduates.   Although China needs more highly
 trained scientists, it also needs a large number of
 low-level technicians to work in rural areas.   Such
 jobs--the majority of the positions available--are far
 less attractive to young people than jobs in the cities.
 Although problems with poor students, teachers,
 and educational facilities are nationwide,  they are
 especially acute outside the major cities.   The best
 universities in China--Peking University, Tsinghua
 University, and Futan University--are located in Peking
 and Shanghai.   So are the best research institutions,
 to which students are often attached for training and
 research experience.   In order to upgrade education,
 it will be necessary to develop first-rate research and
 educational facilities in other parts of the country as
 well.

 In order to solve all of these problems--to improve
 the quality of students,  teachers,  and educational fa-
 cilities--the Chinese Government will have to tackle at
 least two more problems.                          One is economic:   the shortage
 of funds.   China's modernization program demands huge
 outlays of money for a number of purposes--modernizing
 the military, modernizing and mechanizing agriculture,
 raising industrial production and modernizing industry,
 and upgrading science and technology..  Because there
 will be so much competition for China's scarce resources,
 education may well receive less support than it needs
 to adequately carry out all of the reforms essential to
 its improvement.  The second problem is political.   It
 is likely that there is still some leftist influence in
 universities and in educational circles, both long bas-
 tions of the "Gang of Four."   Until people with leftist
 views are removed or purged, they are likely to resist
 any moves to depoliticize the educational system and to
 stress study rather than work and politics.
 The problems afflicting Chinese education have had
 a disastrous effect on an area closely connected with
 education:   science and technology.   Because of the
 poor quality of Chinese education, too few scientists
 have been trained to meet the needs of scientific re-
 search,.   During the Cultural Revolution, many older
 scientists were persecuted, harassed, or purged.   Others
 left their jobs to escape the pressures placed on them.
 Since graduate programs were abolished, few young people
 were trained to take their places, and those who were
 often lacked solid grounding in scientific theory.
 Chang Wen-yu, Director of the Institute of High Energy
 Physics of the Chinese Academy of Science, recently
 stated that over half of his staff were poorly trained,
 were unable to understand the principles of quantum
 mechanics, and hence were unable to do research.   Out-
 side of the main research centers, tie situation is
 even more abysmal.   The Chengtu Geology College in
 Szechuan Province,  for instance, recently reported that
 of 234 research projects it completed since 1973, only
 six have reached international standards, and only 10
 have reached progressive national standards.
 The greatest dilemma facing Chinese education, how-
 ever,                                is not any single problem, but the combination of
 a large number of problems.   The Chinese Government has

 to tackle many jobs at once--increasing the number of
 students, recruiting good teachers, improving educa-
 tional facilities, writing good textbooks, raising
 morale, rooting out leftist influence, and finding
 enough money.  All of these, moreover, are intercon-
 nected.   The solution of one demands the solution of
 another.   The task of solving the problems facing Chi-
 nese education will therefore demand both time and ef-
 fort.   It is highly unlikely that it can be accomplished
 by the end of the century, when Peking wants to have
 developed China into a "powerful socialist state."  And
 until substantial educational reform and improvement is
 carried out, the modernization of agriculture, industry,

 Problems in Agricultural Mechanization
 A recent broadcast from Kwangsi Province in South
 China and an editorial published recently in the People's
 Daily illustrate the important practical problems China
 is having mechanizing its agricultural production.   In-
 creased[ mechanization of agriculture has been a long-
 standing goal of Chinese economic policy, but has been
 especially stressed since 1975 when then Vice Premier
 Hua Kuo-feng announced China's intention to basically
 complete the process by 1980.   China's mechanized farm
 implement industry, however, has been more successful
 in producing the machinery than the Chinese peasant has
 been in assimilating it.
 Kwangsi, according to the provincial broadcast, had
 increased by 12 times the number of tractors in the prov-
 ince since 1970, but had only trebled the number-of
 trained tractor operators during the same period.  One
 county, for example, had added 300-400 new machines
 per year since 1974 but only 200 operators per year
 during the same period.   As a consequence, the county
 is now 1,000 operators short, and machines remain idle.
 In addition to being in short supply, many supposedly
 trained workers are not adequately prepared to either
 operate or maintain the machinery.   The broadcast cites
 the following examples:
 -- A production brigade youth sent to the county
 seat to learn to operate and bring back a new
 hand-guided tractor was to return to a triumphant
 and noisy hero's welcome.   The youth failed to
 arrive at the appointed hour because he and his
 tractor had fallen into a ditch on the way back
 to his village.
 -- A production team had painstakingly carried a
 tractor into a mountainous region of the province
 only to have the machine fail after a few days'

 use.   Unable to diagnose the problem, the team
 disassembled the tractor and carried it down the
 mountain to the county seat for inspection.   The
 problem:   the machine had run out of fuel.
 Having pressed tractor production since 1975, Peking
 is now paying more attention to getting the best use out
 of the machines.    Peking plans a conference on agriculture
 mechanization in late October and has established a high-
 level State Council office to oversee the program.   Over-
 coming the training problems, however, will be the prov-
 inces' responsibility, according to the People's Daily
 which calls for training programs to be established in
 all provinces and at all levels of authority from the
 production brigade up.
 The editorial and Kwangsi broadcast both suggest
 another and perhaps more fundamental weakness in the
 mechanization program:   tractors are often not being used
 for farming.   Both professional tractor drivers and peas-
 ants have apparently found that using tractors to haul
 goods on roadways is more profitable than using them to
 pull plows in the fields where traditional labor intensive
 methods still prevail.
 The editorial,  in particular,  reflects concern that
 the growing class of professional "agricultural workers"
 is becoming divorced from the peasants it is trained to
 serve.   The editorial criticizes the practice of "small
 production," presumably rental of machines and services
 to the highest bidder, and directs that machine operators
 remain skilled at farming and be paid according to the
 same standards as the peasants.   To correct the "capital-
 ist tendency," the editorial urges stepped-up political
 training.
 Neither political nor technical training,  however,
 is likely to promote substantially wider use of the equip-
 ment in agricultural production until the machines rep-
 resent a clear advantage in economic terms over the
 traditional methods or become less profitable when used
 for other purposes.

 FOR THE RECORD
 Nepal:   The appointment of new Nepalese Prime Min-
 ister Bista on 12 September undoubtedly cheered Peking.
 The Chinese have assiduously courted Bista's favor and
 will now expect him to strengthen relations between the
 two countries.
 China had been suspicious of former Prime Minister
 Giri's links to India, fearing that he might cause the
 Himalayan kingdom to lean too far toward New Delhi and
 away from Peking.   The Chinese fear was heightened by
 the memory of India's annexation of Sikkim, which re-
 moved an important buffer from the border with India.
 With Bista's appointment, the Chinese will want to
 collect on their investment last year in his political
 future.   Bista visited Peking in may 1976 for what he
 expected to be a private visit with relatives serving
 in the embassy there.   The Chinese surprised him by
 according him high-level treatment, including a meeting
 with Hua Kuo-feng and a banquet given by the Chinese
 Foreign Minister.   In return for this well-publicized
 support, Peking may well be looking for a payoff in
 Nepal's foreign policy.

 Authoritative CPSU Journal Spells Out Moscow's Case
 Against Peking
 The full text of the extensive anti-Chinese polemic
 in the August issue of the CPSU Central Committee's
 theoretical journal Kommunist is now available.   It is
 a forceful, sharply-focused indictment of Peking's sins
 as Moscow sees them,  and clearly reflects Soviet exasper-
 ation at the unwillingness of the post-Mao leadership
 to moderate Mao's strident anti-Soviet policies.   Many
 of the charges made in the Kommunist article have been
 made elsewhere in Soviet propaganda and in private state-
 ments,by Soviet officials.   Nevertheless, as the most
 extensive and authoritative official Soviet pronounce-
 ment on China since Mao's death, it contributes greatly
 to an understanding of Soviet charges, fears, and resent-
 ment of Chinese policies.   The article, which went to
 press during the Chinese Communist Party's 11th Party
 Congress, assumed, correctly, that the decisions taken
 at the CCP plenum in July were an authoritative state-
 ment of Chinese policy programs under the new leadership
 and would be reflected in the results of the party con-
 gress.  Kommunist was clearly at pains to vilify these
 policies in the strongest possible language.
 The New Leaders Are As Bad--Or Worse--Than Mao
 The Kommunist article clearly articulates Moscow's
 distress over the fact that Mao Tse-tung's successors
 have failed to change the direction of Mao's hostile
 policies toward the USSR.   It hammers away at the theme
 that the essentials of Maoism are being faithfully fol-
 lowed by the new Chinese leaders both internally and
 externally.   In fact, in their negative policies toward
 the USSR and world socialism, they are being intensified.
 Moscow's negative assessment of the July plenum's results
 and of the new Chinese leaders is pointed and harsh.  The
 following, and all the excerpts cited later, are direct
 quotes:

 -- So far no positive changes have become
 apparent in the policy of the Chinese
 leadership compared with the course
 pursued by Peking during Mao's life.
 It is rather the opposite that has
 happened--a line of further intensifica-
 tion of anti-Soviet attacks, militariza-
 tion of the country, and closeness with
 the most reactionary imperialist forces
 has been charted.
 -- Implementing the Maoist foreign political
 course as a whole without corrections,
 the Peking leaders go beyond it, re-
 jecting the former revolutionary camou-
 flage, displaying an even greater desire
 to come closer to the imperialists.
 -- The leaders of the CCP, as is clear, do
 not intend to reject the Maoist ways,
 critically assess faulty concepts, and
 put the country back on the track of
 socialist building.  The events of
 September-October 1976 did not go beyond
 a type of leadership coup which was
 limited to the removal of one of the
 rival groups without, however, bringing
 about radical political changes.
 -- Maoist concepts are the essential founda-
 tions of the domestic political program
 of the new Chinese leadership headed by
 Hua Kuo-feng.
 Most striking is the blanket condemnation of the
 entire leadership group and the admission that Moscow
 sees no succor from any member of the reconstituted
 Chinese leadership.   Specifically, the article claims
 that "a struggle is taking place within the Chinese leader-
 ship less about a 'line,' as its participants claim,
 than among individuals who support the same Maoist plat-
 form and are different only in terms of shades and
 emphasis."  In short, Kommunist writes off any signifi-
 cance to the elevation or demotion of any leaders, in-
 cluding Teng Hsiao-ping or the "Gang of Four."

 Peking Is Beyond The Role Of Marxism-Leninism
 One purpose of the article is to depict Chinese
 policies as being completely beyond the pale of Marxism-
 Leninism or having any "progressive" content whatever.
 Specifically, the journal alleges that:
 -- Under the new Peking leadership Maoism
 remains a variety of anti-Communism.
 -- The Peking leadership is in the ranks of
 the enemies of peace and socialism.
 -- The policy of the Peking leadership is
 openly directed against the majority
 of socialist countries.
 -- It openly approaches the position of
 the most extreme reaction and is not
 only alien to the principles and ideals
 of socialism but, essentially, has be-
 come an important reserve of imperialism.
 The Maoist stipulations on the most impor-
 tant social and economic problems are of
 an anti-Marxist and subjective nature.
 Peking As A Military Threat And Source of War
 The article pays close attention throughout to
 China's military potential and sounds an alarmist note
 about Peking's alleged preparations for war.   It clearly
 reflects Moscow's growing concern that the West and Japan
 will contribute to China's military buildup and therefore
 vilifies Peking's military investment policies as being
 a source of severe deprivation to the Chinese people
 and a threat to world peace.  These charges, in addition
 to their obvious propaganda intent and their attempt to
 discourage Western military-related assistance to Peking,
 also convey a note of genuine concern about the long
 range threat to the USSR of a populous, hostile China
 with a growing nuclear capability.   The following points
 are made:
 The Chinese leaders are actively pursuing
 the course set by Mao Tse-tung of prep-
 arations for war,  ignoring the fact

 that this is harming the development
 of the country's national economy,
 exhausting its already limited resources,
 and creating a serious threat both to
 the amine .late neighbors of the PRC as
 well as to the cause of peace through-
 out the world  (emphasis added).
 -- The course of preparations for war was
 entered in the PRC Constitution adopted
 in January 1975, and in the documents
 of the Ninth and Tenth CCP Congresses.
 -- China's military potential is growing at
 an accelerated pace.   Basic attention
 is being paid to improving nuclear
 missile weapons.   In the first months
 following Mao's death China had three
 nuclear blasts.   Last year a total of
 four nuclear tests were conducted.
 -- In 1976 direct military outlays accounted
 for over 40 percent of state budget
 expenditure, about 50 percent of them
 being in nuclear missile weapons.
 -- Lately the Chinese leadership has been
 adamantly asking the West for military
 aid in terms of procurement of modern
 armaments and combat materiel as well
 as assistance in the development of
 military industry sectors.
 In this connection the trips which Japanese
 military leaders and specialists have
 made to the PRC, at Peking's invitation,
 deserve serious attention.   As the
 Japanese themselves state they had to
 listen to the "complaints" of the
 Chinese military concerning the limited
 combat possibilities of their army.

 courting and encouragement of any country or organization
 which maintains an essentially adversary relationship
 with Moscow.   Particularly, Peking's tilt toward the US,
 its contacts with West Germany? and its encouragement of
 NATO draw the strongest fire in the Kommunist article.
 All are cited as evidence of Peking's casting its lot
 with imperialism (that is, anyone anti-Soviet).   The
 statement draws particular attention to China's attacks
 against the basis of the present Soviet leadership's
 foreign policy--detente and productive relations with
 the US.     Particularly, it claims that:
 -- Peking's foreign policy is entering a
 new stage which is even more hostile
 and dangerous to the forces of peace,
 democracy, and socialism.
 A trend toward further rapprochement
 and expanding the area of "common"
 or "parallel" international interests
 of Peking and Washington remains.
 The position of the Chinese leadership
 is reduced to inducing the United
 States to fight the Soviet Union "edge
 to edge" on the basis of "common
 interests" and doing everything
 possible to provoke a worsening of
 relations between the United States and
 the USSR.
 -?- In the scale of priorities of Peking's
 foreign policy, relations with the
 West have taken the foreground.
 --- Li Hsien-nien noted that he had "much
 in common" with [British Conservative
 leader Thatcher]  on a number of impor-
 tant international problems and the
 joint desire to counter the policy of
 detente,  "of which there could be no
 question."

 -- Using the advance of the enemies of
 peace in the West and giving them all-
 round support, the Maoists are trying
 to turn back the process of detente.
 -- Peking is adamantly resisting any measure
 in the field of disarmament.   It has
 still not assumed any obligations
 banning or limiting the development
 and use of weapons of mass destruction.
 -- Acting under the false banner of "struggle
 against superpower hegemony," Peking is
 trying to counter the general course
 followed by the socialist states toward
 detente and disarmament.
 And Worst Of All--Tampering In Eastern Europe
 The polemic includes an uncommon expression of con-
 cern about alleged Chinese efforts to tamper with Moscow's
 sensitive relationship with Eastern Europe.  The degree
 of sensitivity on this issue seems surprising, but it
 is stated in forceful terms:
 -- The Chinese leadership is continuing its
 devisive policy of "differentiated
 approach" to the socialist states,
 acting in this case in an even more
 subtle manner than in the past.
 -- Peking sees as its task the breaking
 of the unity of the fraternal countries
 and undermining their coordinated
 course.   It is trying to convince
 individual socialist countries of an
 alleged "real possibility to develop
 all-round cooperation" to continue
 a hostile course toward the socialist
 community as a whole and the USSR in
 particular.
 -- The escalation of Peking's subversive
 efforts against the members of the
 socialist community represents a real

 threat both to their unity and to
 the national interests of each of the
 fraternal states  (emphasis added).
 Finally, the Kommunist article provides a clear
 warning to its allies:
 -- Maoist ideology and politics are directed
 against the very essence of socialism
 and against the foundations of the
 international communist movement.   Any
 conciliation with them could turn into
 a form of opportunism.   With this in
 mind we cannot fail to see the topicality
 of the struggle against Maoist attempts
 to assist in the manifestation and
 proliferation of all types of nationalist
 distortions  (emphasis added).
 Conclusion
 A lengthy portion of the 7,000-word statement attacks
 in detail Peking's domestic political and economic pol-
 icies, particularly singling out the Taching and Tachai
 production models. A few optimistic lines are scattered
 throughout the piece to the effect that the policies of
 the new Maoists will fail and China will some day take
 the path of scientific socialism.   The final, five-line
 paragraph also provides a proforma statement of the
 Soviet desire for normalized relations between the two
 countries.   The true spirit of the article, however, is
 best reflected in the concluding paragraph of the penul-
 timate section which states that:
 "'The words and actions of the Chinese leadership
 that replaced Mao Tse-tung confirmed the correctness
 and topical nature of the principled assessments of
 the theory and practice of Maoism made at fraternal
 party congresses.   Peking's feverish attempts to wreck
 detente, prevent disarmament, implant mistrust and hos-
 tility among countries, and its aspirations to provoke
 a world war and warm its hands on the flames of this
 conflagration represent a great danger to all peace-loving
 nations.  Peking's provocative policy is profoundly con-
 tradictory to the interests of all nations and must be
 rebuffed."

 A striking aspect of the article is the pessimistic
 conclusion, which closes off the possibility that some
 members of the present Chinese Politburo might desire
 an amelioration of Peking's hostility toward the USSR.
 In contrast to Soviet media articles in the early 1970s,
 there is no reference to "healthy forces"  (that is, pro-
 Soviet leaders) in the Chinese Party or Army who might
 be willing at some future date to try to improve Sino-
 Soviet relations.   On the contrary, the article becomes
 polemical in denying that conditions in China could be
 conducive to the development of such forces, inasmuch
 as Mao's death, "neither did, nor could, automatically
 bring about the surmounting of Maoism."
