 As the French Government hastened its prepara-
 tions to deal with Communist sabotage of US arms ship-
 ments, the Communists, in. a tactical maneuver designed
 to conceal the political objectives of their anti-MDAP
 campaign, appeared to be concentrating on exploiting the
 legitimate economic grievances of workers in defense
 industries (see page 2). In this effort, the French Com-
 munists will take full advantage of the return to collective
 bargaining by promoting industry-wide and local strikes
 which )nay have serious political and economic consequences
 (see page 4).
 The break in US-Bulgarian relations, which reflects
 the importance attached by the USSR to sealing off the Sat-
 ellite peoples from contact with the US, is one more mani-
 festationk of the greatly increased pressure being exerted
 against US missions throughout the Satellites and particularly
 in Hungary and Rumania (see page 9). Meanwhile, Yugoslavia
 recognized the Ho Chi Minh regime in Indochina in an
 attempt to foster the spread of national Communists, parti-
 cularly in the Far East, and to refute Cominform allegations
 that Yugoslavia had sold out to the West (see page 10).

 Anti-MDAP Campaign      Communist recognition of the
 probable failure of open and direct
 attempts to interfere with the shipment of arms to Europe
 under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP) has
 led to a marked change in Communist strategy. In an ap-
 parent attempt to conceal the political objectives of its anti-
 MDAP campaign, the Communist high command now seems
 to be working toward its goal by concentrating on building
 up popular war fears and exploiting the legitimate economic
 grievances of workers engaged in defense, transport, and
 port activities. 'Communist labor is also shifting from
 attempted direct interference with MDAP deliveries to
 efforts to impair production in armament plants, The Com-
 munists evidently hope that these indirect tactics will be
 equally effective in delaying Western European defense
 preparations but less offensive to Western European peoples
 than direct strikes against the national defense. Meanwhile,
 in France, where the major Communist effort is centered,
 the French Government will take sufficiently strong measures
 against the Communist campaign to prevent serious inter-
 ference with the unloading and distribution of MDAP equip-
 ment,
 Economic Policy   The serious economic problems facing
 . West Germany, combined with mounting
 criticism of the Government's failure to take positive mea-
 sures to alleviate them, may force the Adenauer regime to
 reimpose regulations over the domestic economy and foreign
 to

 trade. With unemployment at the two-million mark and
 industrial expansion leveling off (except in the steel in-
 dustry), Adenauer is being criticized for his "laissez
 faire and defeatist attitude" toward steps which would
 alleviate unemployment, stimulate exports,. and encour-
 age deficit spending for investment and public works
 projects. This criticism has emanated not only from
 the opposition parties in the Bundestag but from the
 social reform wing in Adenauer's own Christian Demo-
 cratic Union. Although Adenauer is likely to resist any
 permanent alliance with the Social Democratic Party,
 he will probably make more concessions to the left wing
 in his party. Such concessions will probably take the form
 of greater controls over the economy and more aggressive
 efforts to alleviate the country's economic ills. Adenauer
 will continue, however, to oppose any move toward out-
 right socialization or nationalization of industry.
 Steel Embargo    The West German embargo on steel
 deliveries to the Soviet zone will
 inconvenience West German iron and steel producers,
 but long-term maintenance of the embargo will have far
 more serious effects on the economy of East Germany.
 West Germany could probably have found ready markets
 in areas outside the Soviet sphere for approximately 80
 percent of the steel products shipped in 1949 to the Soviet
 zone, and the steadily rising domestic and foreign demand
 for. West German steel should eliminate any temporary
 dislocations caused by the embargo. On the other hand,
 the steel embargo has already so aggravated the metal
 shortage in the Soviet zone that authorities have issued
 an order confiscating all"present and future iron., steel,
 and non-ferrous scrap metal. Moreover, unemployment

 GERMANY
 has grown to such an extent. that plans are being com-
 pleted for shifting manpower within.the zone. The Soviet
 zone iron and steel industry is also suffering from a
 shortage of metallurgical coke, scrap, and iron ore, and
 unless -these-cx itical strortages are alleviated in the near
 future, the Soviet iron and steel industry cannot hope to
 meet the scheduled 1950 production requirements.

 Labor Strife   The return to collective bargaining in.
 France threatens to have serious political
 and economic consequences. With,the level. of wages
 virtually unchanged since 1948 despite a 17 percent in-
 crease in the cost of living, the stage is set for the. Com-
 munist-dominatedGeneral Confederation of Labor (CGT)
 to exploit the new situation in a campaign which will be
 unintentionally abetted by both the Government and man-
 agement and which will probably lead to industry-wide
 and local strikes, The Government will probably attempt
 to set the new minimum wage as low as possible; while
 management will probably play into the CGT's hands
 by encouraging local. rather than regional or national
 contract negotiations and by spurning the assistance of
 the Force Ouvriere (FO) in combatting the CGT's tactics,
 Meanwhile, if the CGT is successful in gaining wage in-
 creases from local str?ikes,ihe FO may also be forced to
 adopt more aggressive strike tactics, In any event, a 15
 to 20 percent rise in general wage levels is anticipated
 during the coming months. Moreover, an increase in strikes
 would retard progress toward increased industrial production

 and act as a strong impetus to existing inflationary pres-
 sures. Such a trend would in turn hamper French export
 efforts and therefore tend to discourage further French
 agreement to proposals for Western European trade
 liberalization,
 Reform Program   The Italian Government will have
 difficulty financing the 'reform and
 investment program currently being planned. The total
 program as now envisaged would require an investment
 :equal to almost 20 percent of the estimated national
 income, The Government will be unable to raise this
 sum without resorting to inflationary financing and is
 unlikely to take such a course at this time. It is thus
 probable that primary emphasis will, be placed on. those
 aspects of the program which have the greatest socio-
 political urgency, namely: (1) agrarian reform; (2) public
 works to alleviate conditions in southern Italy and Sicily;
 and (3) expansion of. the low-cost housing program. With
 available funds concentrated on these projects, the Govern-
 ment will probably be forced to slight the investment pro-
 gram that is needed in the industrial and associated fields to
 reduce industrial, unemployment, to increase the availability
 of capital and consumer goods, and to absorb the increased
 consumer spending power injected into the economy by the
 socio-political reforms,

 Wages and Prices   Despite efforts by the Trades Union
 Congress to delay demands for wage
 increases, the UK Government may soon be faced with re-
 newed wage controversies; Although the cost-of-living
 index, based on retail prices, must reach 118 (qt is now
 113) before widespread demands can be expected, sharp
 increases in wholesale prices since devaluation in. September
 should soon be reflected in higher retail prices, especially
 since the Government is not inclined to increase subsidies.
 Food is up 20 percent and prices for wool, cotton, and hides
 have risen sharply and will affect the retail price of clothing
 and-footwear. The price of industrial materials and manu-
 factures may also increase as `existing stocks become ex:-
 hausted and purchases reflect higher world prices.
 Defense Policy   Growing realization of Ireland's vul-
 nerability in the event of war is leading
 the Irish Government to reassess the possibilities of
 strengthening Ireland's defenses, Defense Minister O'Higgins
 recently consulted two tetired British general officers and
 apparently concurred in their view that Ireland's :inadequate
 military defense imperils British and Western European
 security. Although the Irish are still unwilling to enter into
 a direct alliance with the UK. while the Partition question
 remains unsolved, they are probably now willing toe (1) enter
 with the US, or the US and Canada, into a formal alliance
 paralleling the North Atlantic Pact; (2) seek allocation of
 military equipment from the US and additional equipment
 and training from the, UK; (3) expand the Irish Army by

 (4)-refrain from raising the partition-issue during the
 negotiations. Strong disapproval by opposition leader
 De Valera would probably discourage the'Costello .   ..
 Government from entering such negotiations; De Valera,
 however, influenced by strong Catholic support for Irish
 participation in Europe's defense; is apparently no longer,
 as adamantly neutrality -minded as he was during World
 War II.

 Trade Controls   By channeling East-West trade through
 Soviet-controlled middlemen in Western
 Europe, the USSR is facilitating the acquisition of strategic
 goods in contravention of Western export controls, obtaining
 supplementary funds for Communist parties in Western
 Europe, and establishing a net for economic espionage. To
 an increasing extent, all East-West trade must be handled
 through agents designated by the USSR. The great majority
 of these agents are either Eastern European nationals
 operating primarily for their respective countries or local
 Communists directed through the regular international Com-
 munist apparatus. This type of international commercial
 operation not only provides it large measure of control over
 East-West trade channels but permits the realization of
 large profits. Thus, the Italian Communists have been able
 to support a program well. beyond that which would have
 been possible from domestic resources or direct assistance
 from the USSR.-.Similarly, in Switzerland, profits realized by
 such Cominunistrcontrolled firms as Intra Handels, which
 has a preferred position in trade with the Balkans, have been
 used, in part to finance such operations as the French strikes
 and Italian Communist electoral campaigns.

 FINLAND
 Finland's economic and political independence would not be
 jeopardized. Finland relied on the USSR in 1949 for more
 than half its petroleum imports and'for substantial quantities
 of wheat. (The greater part of Finland's non-ferrous ores
 and metal requirements were supplied by Western Europe;)
 Finland could; probably switch fairly easily to non-Soviet
 suppliers for its petroleum requirements, and the country's
 grain problem has been eased somewhat by the prospect that
 1950's grain crops will be 16 percent above 1949's production.
 Some of the foreign exchange required for shifting Finland's
 imports to non-Soviet sources would be met by increasing
 the export of wood products to Western Europe and the US0
 .A major shift to non-Soviet sources because of Soviet re-
 fusal to negotiate a trade treaty, however, may force Finland
 to ask for some financial assistance from the West to com-
 pensate for the unfavorable balance of payments which will
 last until 1952, when Soviet reparations payments are
 concluded,
 US Relations   The formal break in US-Bulgarian relations,
 when viewed in the light of an increase in
 pressure against US missions in the other Satellites, marks
 the furthest advance in the USSR's campaign to seal off the
 Satellite peoples from the West. An immediate effect of the
 break has been the initiation of a ruthless extermination in
 Bulgaria of those accused. of collaborating in espionage
 activity with the US legation. By permitting an open rupture
 in US-Bulgarian relations, the USSR has apparently indicated
 its belief that maintaining US-Satellite relations is less

 important than overcoming the serious obstacles to
 complete consolidation of Soviet control represented
 by the presence of US missions. Moreover; in the case
 of Bulgaria, as may also be the case in Hungary and
 Rumania, the USSR may have been anxious to expel US
 personnel, in order to prepare with greater secrecy for
 further anti-Tito operations. Although anti-US moves
 have already increasedlin Poland and Czechoslovakia
 as well, the USSR may move more slowly toward forcing
 a break in relations between the US and these Satellites,
 which not only are members of the UN but still have more
 exploitable trade and diplomatic channels with the West
 than do the other Satellites.
 Ho Recognition   Yugoslav recognition of the Ho Chi
 Minh regime in Indochina was a
 carefully considered move designed both to foster the
 spread of national Communism, especially in the Far.
 East, and to refute current Cominform allegations that
 Yugoslavia has sold out to the West. The Yugoslav Govern-
 ment, convinced that Mao Tse-tung will eventually break
 free of Moscow, has long been anxious to establish con-
 tact with the Chinese Communists, and Tito apparently
 believes that contact with Ho' will enable Yugoslavia to
 establish closer ties with Mao. Through such ties, Yugo-
 slavia probably hopes eventually to win adherents to the
 Yugoslav brand of independent Communism and end Yugo-
 slavia's isolation as the only "national" Communist state,

 TREATY WITH USSR
 The recently announced treaty between
 China and the USSR was almost certainly
 accompanied by secret protocols designed to provide for a
 stronger Soviet position in the Chinese military organization,
 in strategic segments of the Chinese economy, and in China's
 .bonier regions. It is not likely that protracted negotiations
 would have been necessary to reach agreement on the pub-
 lished text of the treaty.
 Military Agreements  Unpublished military agreements
 probably provide for. (1) Soviet
 assistance to the Chinese Communist ground and naval. forces
 and their embryonic air force; (2) Soviet access to Chinese
 naval and air bases; (3) the "joint" development of such
 bases using Soviet equipment and technicians; (4) the ex-
 change of military and technical personnel; and (5) the dis-
 patch of a Soviet military mission to China. The USSR will
 probably give special attention to the development of the
 Chinese Communist air arm, which it will be in a position
 to dominate from the outset; to Chinese Communist service
 schools; and to the selection of reliable Chinese Stalinists

 . Economic Terms  In the economic field, the USSR has
 probably obtained secret rights to main-
 tain its preferred position in Manchuria, establish Soviet
 trading firms, assign Soviet advisers and technicians to
 strategic segments of the Chinese economy, extend Soviet air
 privileges in the border regions and to China-proper, and

 engage in preclusive buying of strategic minerals; One
 economic pact may deal specifically with Sinkiang; an
 arrangement for the joint development of that province,.
 together with provision for Soviet advisers with the pro-
 vincial government, would make it unnecessary for the
 USSR to seek territorial concessions in Sinkiang at this
 time.
 Possible Friction  Meanwhile, friction will probably
 develop between China and the USSR
 over implementation of the published $ 300 million credit
 agreement. As in the case of similar Soviet credits to the
 European Satellites, the USSR may use the agreement as
 a lever to extract concessions from the Chinese. The
 USSR will not only tend to overrate the value of Soviet
 goods but may insist on deducting from the credit any
 costs of technical advisory assistance, on receiving credit
 for the return of equipment originally obtained in the dis-
 mantling of Manchurian industrial installations, and on
 charging exorbitant transportation costs.
 JAPAN
 Strike Threat  The strike of government workers
 threatened for early March still finds
 the Yoshida regime firm in its refusal to grant wage in-
 creases. In answer to mass demonstrations in prepara-
 tion for the "illegal" strike, the Government has warned
 that strong action will be taken and maintains that its
 efforts to reduce the cost of living will eventually result
 in real wage increases, The Socialists, however, in an
 attempt to hold trade union support, state that wage in-
 creases could be made from funds now proposed for debt

 retirement in the Government's "over-ambitious" 1950
 budget, and blame the present labor crisis on the Yoshida
 regime. Although the Socialists have petitioned SCAP to
 intervene on behalf. of. the government workers, no action
 by the occupation authorities has thus far- been indicated.
 Meanwhile, the present crisis tends to undermine the
 current moderate leadership of the Japanese trade union
 movement, and labor may become increasingly susceptible
 to Communist influence.

 US-UK DIVERGENCE ON CHINA ISSUE
 Recent developments in connection with shipping
 and civil aviation in. the Far East have clearly demonstrated
 that despite general agreement in over-all policy on con-
 tainment of Communism in. Asia., the UK will continue to
 differ with the US,on specific issues -and that the UKIis in
 general reluctant to cooperate fully with. the US on issues
 where there is a serious risk of antagonizing the Chinese
 Communist Government.
 .This reluctance by the UK has been reflected in
 .the attitude of most of, the British Empire ,,courts in which
 repossession. action was instituted in respect to the Chinese m
 flag ships on which the US has held defaulted mortgages.
 Although the US is still pressing the issue, the UK is clearly
 not prepared to take any positive steps to prevent such ship=
 ping from, falling under Communist control. With respect
 to approximately 60 transport aircraft at.Hong Kong, which
 had been purchased by Chennault interests from the Chinese
 Nationalists while the UK. still recognized the Nationalist
 .Government, a Hong Kong court has now rendered a decision
 which would appear to permit the aircraft shortly to be
 -flown to the mainland of. China for integration., into the Com-
 munist civil. and military air fleets. Although the UK may
 detain the aircraft at Hong Kong on technical grounds pending
 further appeal, continued British reluctance to antagonize the
 Chinese Communists offers little assurance of full British
 .cooperation with the US on. similar issues in the future.
 Meanwhile, the British must soon decide officially
 whether. to apply to Communist China, the existing joint
 US-UK' policy for restriction of Satellite international
 aviation activities. The UK will probably decline for the

 present the US request that it support the representations
 already made by the US in Bangkok and Jakarta to refuse
 any requests for landing rights for Chinese Communist
 aircraft.
 Although the UK is as anxious as the US to prevent
 Communist expansion into Southeast Asia, the desire to
 protect its valuable holdings in China and its position in
 Hong Kong will cause the British to move with caution'
 in matters concerning Chinese Communist civil aviation.
 Any pressure by the UK on Bangkok and Jakarta, further-
 more, would conflict with the British objective of culti
 vating trdde relations with the Chinese. Pending the
 establishment of satasfa~tory diplomatic relations with
 China, therefore, expediency will govern British decisions
 with respect to Chinese Communist aviation activities.
 When full diplomatic status has been accorded the UK's
 representative at Peiping and when the future course of
 British-Chinese relations seems clearer, the UK may
 then find it possible to take a more positive attitude. In
 any -case, the UK will seek to conceal as far as possible
 any alignment with the US in actions prejudicial to Com-
 munist Chinese interests in air transport operations.
 Over-all British policy toward Communist China
 will probably be largely shaped for some time by desires
 to protect the British commercial position in China and
 to retain Hong Kong. The British will hope that their actions
 will coincide substantially with those taken by the US, but
 preoccupation with what the UK conceives to be its major
 interests will lead to further situations in which the actions
 of the two nations differ. For example, British representatives
 in China who have assumed the protection of US citizens and
 property may not in all cases be able to defend US interests
 vigorously.
