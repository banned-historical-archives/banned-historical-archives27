 ETHIOPIA:   Red Terror Campaign
 The "Red Terror" campaign directed by the Ethiopian
 Government has intensified in Addis Ababa as proregime defense
 squads continue to kiZZ government opponents.
 Fifteen to 20 people are now being executed daily by
 defense squads in the capital, and their corpses, marked with
 red signs, are left in the streets each night. The intensified
 campaign is instilling the desired fear among the city's resi-
 dents and has succeeded in reducing terrorist acts against
 regime supporters by the Marxist-oriented Ethiopian Peoples'
 Revolutionary Party and other groups. Antigovernment gunmen,
 however, are still assassinating an average of one or two re-
 gime officials daily in Addis Ababa.
 Defense squads drawn from urban dwellers' associations
 and from proregime mass movements are taking the lead in arrest-
 ing and executing suspected opponents of the government, includ-
 ing members of the clandestine EPRP. The ruling military coun-
 cil has armed these defense squads and instructed them to crush
 counter-revolutionaries.
 EPRP members under torture have implicated many others.
 US Embassy sources who have reported accurately in the past
 state that the defense squads have executed 750 people in Addis
 Ababa and 250 outside the capital in recent months; the number
 of those arrested approaches 7,000.
 I         I        Search teams of 8 to 10 masked, heavily armed persons

 USSR:   Repression of Dissidents
 Repression of Soviet dissidents in the Caucasus has
 increase  during the past two months.  Three members of the tiny
 Georgian branch of the dissident CSCE Monitoring Group were de-
 tained during the Last week, and members of two Armenian groups
 have also been arrested recently.
 I     I One member of the Georgian group, Grigorriy Goldshteyn,
 was  a ained and held for several days before being released
 last week. Goldshteyn was told that a case was being prepared
 against him for "malicious evasion of socially useful labor,"
 also known as "parasitism." Unemployment is a criminal offense
 in the USSR and is often a convenient pretext for arresting
 those who have lost their jobs because of dissident activities.
 Goldshteyn, a physicist, had refused to accept the menial work
 he has been offered since he became a "refusenik" in 1971.
 As Goldshteyn was released,  two other members of the
 Georgian Monitoring Group--one of whom is Viktor Rtskhiladze,
 an art historian and former Georgian Cultural Ministry official--
 were detained. Rtskhiladze had been detained temporarily last
 April along with other leaders of the Georgian Monitoring Group.
 Dissidents in Moscow believe that he may be charged with "anti-
 Soviet activity."

 Caucasus, where nationalist passion against Russification runs
 high. A number of acts of sabotage in recent years have occurred
 in Georgia and Armenia. Although there has been no evidence that
 intellectual dissidents were involved in these events, the cen-
 tral authorities have probably never ruled out the possibility
 that some of the turbulence in these republics is politically
 motivated. This concern may now be aggravated by a fear that the
 CSCE group--which has links to an all-union organization of           25X1
 human rights activists--has joined forces with the more extreme
 Armenian nationalists, who could potential)   to   a reservoir of

 SWEDEN: Nuclear Energy Debate
 Sweden's three-party government coalition apparently
 is   ea   ocked over whether to continue developing the country's
 nuclear power industry or to divert funds to research and de-
 velopment of nonnuclear power sources.  The issue will be de-
 bated this week; opposition Leader OZof Palme may ask for a
 confidence vote. Even without such a call, Prime Minister FaZZdin
 may force the issue by submitting a proposal for fund~'ng non-
 nuclear power development or for a referendum on the Issue.  If
 he finds little support for his position,  FaZZdin could resign.
 Falldin  who insists he will step down rather than
 renege on his campaign promise to phase out Sweden's nuclear
 power program, has until now been willing to compromise to
 keep his government in power. When the coalition was formed
 in 1976,  the parties agreed that six already completed nuclear
 plants would continue to operate until 1985, four incomplete
 plants would be finished, but not operated, and research and
 development would be continued for three still on the drawing
 board.
 Since that compromise was made, Falldin has departed
 even further from his original hard stance and has seemed will-
 ing to allow more plants to be put into operation and to stretch
 the phaseout beyond 1985.

 is unclear whether he has public support for his position. Polls
 show a majority of Swedes dislike nuclear power, but believe it

 A Royal commission report that asserts the nuclear program is
 no greater hazard than available alternatives could sway public
 opinion.
 The question now is how far Falldin is willing to
 push the issue and how much his coalition partners want to re-
 main in power. They may decide to compromise again by agreeing   25X1
 to allow increased nuclear power production in return for fund-
 ing for research and development of nonnuclear energy sources.
 A failure to compromise could open the door to the opposition
 Social Democrats, who were in power for 44 years before losing
 the 1976 election.

 WEST GERMANY:  1978 Growth Target
 -1  West Germany is shooting for a 3 to 3.5-percent real
 economi.c growth in 1978,  according to  the government's annual
 economic report approved by the cabinet this week.  Achievement
 of this goal depends largely on Bonn's success in moderating
 wage increases; current union demands are well above  the gov-
 ernment's 5-percent target.  In 1977,                          real GNP grew by only 2.4
 percent, far short of the 5 percent official target. The gov-
 ernment stressed the uncertainties surrounding this year's pro-
 jections.
 Bonn is not sure it can achieve even its modest tar-
 get, an  carefully identifies 3.5 percent growth as an upper
 limit. According to the government,  achievement would require
 moderate wage settlements--increases limited to about 5 per-
 cent--to improve industry's profit margins and encourage in-
 vestment.                             It would also require no further substantial appre-
 ciation of the Deutschemark or significant economic slowdowns
 in major trading partners. The government admits that its
 growth target would not reduce unemployment below the present
 seasonally adjusted level of slightly more than 1 million.
 I      ;::] Private consumption and government spending are to
 provUe        of the stimulus for growth. Consumer incomes will

 benefit from recent tax cuts and substantial increases in
 family allowances.  Private investment should be encouraged by
 higher depreciation allowances.
 The net result of government tax cuts and expenditure
 increases is a projected public sector deficit of about $24 bil-
 lion, equal to nearly 4 percent of GNP. According to Finance
 Minister Apel, Bonn plans no further stimulative measures.
 Bonn expects little stimulus from the external sec-
 tor. Exports of goods and services are projected to rise 5 to
 7 percent in current prices.  Responding to quickening domestic
 demand, imports are expected to rise 7 to 8 percent.
 The cautious tone characterizing the official eco-
 nomic report appears justified. Even as the report was pub-
 lished, one of its key underlying assumptions--wage modera-
 tion--was being challenged.  Last Wednesday,  20,000 dockworkers
 began their first strike in 82 years, halting work in Germany's
 major seaports.  The dockworkers rejected a compromise 5.7 per-
 cent wage increase, holding out for a raise of at least 6 per-
 cent.
 I      I Wage negotiations also have broken down with the
 210,UUU employees. of the German steel industry, hard hit by
 the worldwide slump in demand for steel. The metal workers'
 union is demanding a 7-percent wage increase and recently re-
 jected a management proposal to extend the old contract through
 30 April and to provide a 3.5-percent pay hike and some addi-
 tional benefits effective 1 May.
 I             In all, new wage contracts covering some 10 million
 wo  e        the metal working,  chemical,  textile,  and printing
 industries and in public service remain to be negotiated during
 the next few months. Current demands are significantly higher
 than the average 5-percent hike that Bonn considers compatible
 with its growth targets.  The president of the German Trade
 Union Federation, however, privately maintains that final wage
 settlements will be close to 5.5 percent.
 I     I The labor-management negotiating climate remains em-
 i   ere . The union leadership deeply resents industry's deci-
 sion last year to test the constitutionality of the Codetermina-
 tion Law, which gives labor near parity representation on the

 supervisory boards of major companies.  In the wake of this in-
 dustry tactic, the union leadership decided to boycott the
 "Concerted Action" meetings, which in the past had provided a
 forum for government, business,  and labor leaders to discuss
 future economic trends and their implications for wage and
 price policies.
 Restoration of an effective exchange of views among
 government, business,  and labor in some other forum,  as is             25X1
 currently under consideration, wquld enhance the prospects for
 achieving Bonn's growth targets.                                         25X1

 BELIZE-GUATEMALA-UK: Negotiations
 25X1
 //Belizean Premier Price's reaffirmation that his
 country will not cede territory to Guatemala in order to gain
 independence has dimmed the chances of an early settlement.
 The British and the Guatemclans are nevertheless planning to
 resume formal negotiations early next month.//
 //Price has become so closely identified with in-
 dependence and territorial integrity that any retreat would be
 exceedingly difficult. While he badly wants to be the person
 who leads Belize to independence, he probably is politically
 weaker than at any time in the past decade, and the odds of
 his being in office after the next election--no later than Oc-
 tober 1979--are not good.//
 //A national referendum supporting independence
 with territorial cession would enable Price to change his pub-
 lic position by deferring to the will of the people. The oppo-
 sition parties have long insisted on a referendum before any
 move toward independence is made, but Price has never agreed.
 In a meeting with British Foreign Secretary Owen last Tuesday,
 however, Price raised the possibility of a referendum by assert-
 ing--without mentioning a date--that the issue would be put
 directly to the people.//
 //This remaining hope is slim because a majority
 a     e vote   would probably reject independence involving ter-
 ritorial cession unless this was packaged with security guar-
 antees and major economic sweetners. An alternative method of
 consultation--perhaps a poll of elected officials--would offer
 better chances of a favorable vote.//
 //The prospects for early resolution are further
 dimmed  ecause Guatemalan President Laugerud--who could not
 gain approval for any agreement that did not cede territory--
 will become a "lame duck" after the 5 March presidential elec-
 tion. If the issue passes to Laugerud's successor, a settle-
 ment could be put back by at least a year.  In the interim, how-25X1
 ever, the Guatemalans will be satisfied with the status quo and
 are unlikely to resort to force unless the British move uni-
 laterally to grant Belize independence.

 North Korean President Kim IL-song's measured campaign
 to esta   zsh his son, Kim Chong-il, as his successor took another
 step forward last week when for the first time a North Korean
 radio broadcast publicly stressed the importance of choosing a
 "correct successor" to Kim.  Without mentioning Kim Chong-it by
 name,  the broadcast argued in unmistakable terms that the son
 is best qualified to assume that role.  There is no evidence
 that the elder Kim's health is failing or that the succession
 issue is coming to a head, and the broadcast appears to be only
 another step toward establishing the son's credentials as the
 designated successor.
 North Korean media previously commented on the need
 to prepare the younger generation to take over the "revolution,"
 but they have never before directly addressed the question of
 choosing a successor to Kim Il-song.  In contrast,  last week's
 broadcast left no doubt about the issue by noting that the
 matter of carrying on Kim I1-song's work is directly related
 to the task of "correctly selecting the leader's successor."
 In keeping with past practice, the broadcast did not
 mention the son by name. Instead, it praised the leading role
 of the "party center"--a term used by the media since 1974 to
 refer to Kim Chong-il. The broadcast also did not directly state
 that the party center should succeed Kim Il-song, but it strongly
 implied as much, stating that the goals of Kim Il-song and the
 party center are "indistinguishable" and that the party center
 can carry out the programs and policies of the elder Kim.
 The broadcast was transmitted by a station based in
 North Korea that operates as the voice of the so-called "Rev-
 olutionary Party for Reunification," a Marxist-Leninist party
 that allegedly exists as an independent entity in South Korea.
 As such, the North Korean broadcast is not official, but Pyong-
 yang has used the station to air sensitive issues with which the
 regime does not wish to be directly or publicly associated.
 Kim Chong-il is well known in North Korea.  'Since at
 least 1973, the 36- or 37-year-old Kim has held a number of im-
 portant positions in the Korean Worker's Party. He has initiated
 a number of domestic political and economic campaigns and has
 traveled widely throughout the country; his picture has been
 displayed alongside that of his father.

 Last February,  the pro-Pyongyang organization of Ko-
 rean residents in Japan circulated a document asserting that
 Kim Chong-il had been approved as successor by the Political
 Committee of the Korean Worker's Party.  Early each year,  rumors
 are heard that there will be an official announcement from Pyong-
 yang in February on the son's birthday or in April on Kim Il-
 song's birthday.
 Kim Il-song is probably moving slowly on the succession
 question in order to build up,his son's political acceptance
 and legitimacy and to avoid making himself a lame duck. The
 North Koreans are also sensitive to foreign perceptions of an
 emerging Kim "dynasty," especially on the part of China and the
 USSR, which would consider it an unwelcome deviation from
 Communist norms.
 North Korean media have intermittently suggested that
 there is some domestic opposition to Kim Chong-il. Last week's
 broadcast, for example, hinted that some persons are seeking to
 undermine the son's efforts to propagandize his father's "rev-
 olutionary traditions."
 Kim Il-song might want to speed up the timetable for
 announcing the succession scheme if he sensed that his own health
 was deteriorating. At 65, however, Kim continues to maintain
 an active schedule of public activities; he has met twice with
 foreigners this month, and he also presided over a national con-
 ference of agricultural specialists.                                       125X1
 BOLIVIA: Banzer's Poor Prospects
 //The prospects that President Banter will
 be able to turn over power to an elected government this summer
 are fading.  A growing number of government, military, and busi-
 ness leaders oppose the election because they think it threatens
 politi.eal stability. The man Banter has chosen to succeed him
 is losing support, and Banner may ultimately decide to dump
 him. //
 Banzer has been in office six years--almost a record
 in Bolivia--and has brought the country a rare period of sta-
 bility. Many Bolivians, particularly business and professional
 people,  fear that the return to open political competition will
 be accompanied by political and economic chaos. The flow of

 capital out of the country has grown steadily since Banzer an-
 nounced his plans for the election last November. Opponents of
 the election are also pointing to the government's awkward at-
 tempts to end a recent 21-day hunger strike as proof of growing
 instability.
 Banzer's chosen successor, Air Force General Juan
 I             I
 Pereda, has lost the support of some key civilian politicians
 because of his indecisive behavior during the hunger strike,
 and his support within the military is only lukewarm.. Pereda
 has not worked to cultivate close personal relationships with
 important military figures and, as an Air Force officer, he
 does not carry much weight with the Army.
 Along with renewed political uncertainty, the seeming
 i          i
 failure of Pereda's candidacy to take hold has reportedly
 prompted Banzer to reconsider his options. Unless Pereda soon
 begins to pick up strength, Banzer may ask him to withdraw and
 become the official presidential candidate himself--something
 he may have had in mind all along. Alternatively, Banzer may
 simply cancel t   election and maintain his position as mili-
 tary strongman.
 East - West Germany
 West Germany's top political troubleshooter on foreign
 and inter-German policy met with leading East German officials
 in East Berlin this weekend.  State Minister Hans-Juergen Wischnew-
 ski said that his talks with Politburo member Hermann Axen, For-
 eign Minister Oskar Fischer, and other officials had been "busi-
 nesslike, frank, and useful" as well as very necessary because
 of events during the past month. The latter is an apparent ref-
 erence to the recent publication of an East German opposition          =
 manifesto in the West German news magazine Der Spiegel. Wischnew-
 ski said further talks to improve relations would continue in
 normal channels, adding that "there is no current plan" for a
 summit meeting bpt-ween Chancellor Schmidt and East German party
 chief Honecker.                               25X1

 "arbiter" with a national constituency who is above party and
 personal feuds, Giscard asked the voters to make "the right
 choice" of "common sense" at the polls in March--a greater man-

 that the constitution does not give him the power to prevent im-
 plementation of the Left's program if it wins a majority.  Giscard
 said'that the Left would wreck the economy, would not be able to
 agree on a program,  and would further polarize French society.

 Saifudin,  an alternate member of the Chinese Communist
 Party  o itburo, has been removed as party boss of Sinkiang Prov-

 join the attacks on Teng Hsiao-ping in 1976,  and this probably
 contributed to his purge.  Saifudin has been replaced by Wang
 Feng,  a former First Party Secretary of Kansu Province who was
 purged during the Cultural Revolution in 1968. Wang Feng was
 rehabilitated last year after the return of Teng Hsiao-ping,
 when he was identified as Second Secretary of the Sinkiang Prov-

 Persian Gulf
 Bahrain, Qatar,  and the United Arab Emirates revalued
 eir cur encies slightly against the US dollar on Saturday.
 Bahrain and Qatar increased the value of their currencies by 2
 percent, while the UAE revalued by only 0.5 percent. The reval-
 uations, initiated by the UAE, were economically insignificant
 but apparently had good local political justification. The Fi-
 nance Minister of Bahrain reported recent criticisms from local
 banking and business circles that the country's currency was too
 tightly tied to the dollar and that the Government of Bahrain did
 not pay enough attention to the currency market. A recent small
 revaluation of the Saudi Arabian riyal probably also influenced
 the move. The monetary authorities of Bahrain also severed their

 determined by a basket of 16 major currencies.  The UAE is likely
 to follow,  since Saudi Arabia, Qatar,  and Iran also peg their
