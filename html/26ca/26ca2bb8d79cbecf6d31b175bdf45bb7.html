 The People Look at the Politburo
 Several vignettes about Chinese leaders have
 urf aced in recent weeks.  Although some of th
 e
 stories may be apocryphal, they provide some clues
 as to how the Chinese people perceive their leaders.
 One story circulating in Peking is that Vice
 remier Teng Hsiao-ping has virtually invited criti.-
 ism of himself by stating that anyone who assumes
 ...,._.responsibility should not be afraid of criticism.
 The story sounds very much like the rather blunt,
 outspoken Teng and is consistent with a number of

 .  Peking is still on public record
 as opposing "back door" methods, but no steps have
 been taken against people who have used such methods.
 According to the story, Mao's reason for want-

 was that it involved so  any peo

 jjyn any event, whether or not Mao did argue with his
 U_rVife over pursuing this matter, the Chinese people
 see her as the person who opened this Pandora's box
 nd obviously as a disruptive force on the political
 Gene.
 Another story about Chiang Ching is that she
 failed to applaud, unlike other Chinese leaders,
 after a private screening of a film about "Iron Man
 Wang," China's model worker who died a few years
 ago.  The film was probably not produced under her
 auspices.   In contrast to the growing number of docu-
 `                    entaries (such as this one) that are now being shown
 n the country, Chiang Ching's "model" cultural works
 are idealizations, not documentaries.

 Problems with the Militia--Who
 Watches the Watchers?
 With some notable exceptions, Peking's campaign
 to improve unity and stability and boost production
 has made progress this year.         The level of urban
 crime seems to have been reduced and some advances
 have been made in dealing with disgruntled youths,
 who were the main perpetrators.   However, the inter-
 vention of regular troops in Chekiang and reports by
 25X1C          /                                    indicate that the effort
 ,- to restore public order and local authority to
 pre - Cultural Revolution levels has a considerable
 distance to go.
 The militia, particularly the urban militia,
 has been Peking's primary instrument to enhance
 order in the last two years.   In the aggregate,
 the militia has performed reasonably well.  The
 upgrading of the militia has allowed the regime to
 I\virtually complete the removal of the military from
 ,'the expanded civil affairs duties acquired as a
 result of the Cultural Revolution, and has supported
 the priority goal of reducing the military's
 political involvement.  Thus, when Peking called
 in the PLA in Chekiang--and in effect admitted
 failure on the part of the militia--it was not
 an easy decision.   Furthermore, the well-publicized
 nature of the decision seems to be a warning to all
 parties, including the militia and its leaders, that
 factionalism will not be tolerated.
 Recent reports indicate that there is reason
 for concern.   As in Chekiang,  the Wuhan militia was
 disbanded for oarticipatina in factional struaale
 C `,rather than repressing them,
 rThe Wuhan militia is now under the direct command of
 the Hupeh provincial authorities, and Peking presum-
 ably hopes that they can straighten out the situation
 without having to call for troops.

 Another example of progress was reflected in

 7r  )Chengtu Municipal militia command had been estab-
 lished.   Szechwan has been one of the more turbulent
 areas in China, and the creation of the Chengtu com-
 mand is several months behind most other major cities.
 One problem that seems to have arisen as the
 result of Peking's emphasis on reducing factionalism
 is the abuse of militia authority in the name of law
 and order.                                           activities
 of militia units in Peking often border on criminal
 acts--including street fighting with juvenile gangs.

 it.   In Peking, this might include alternate
 politburo member Ni Chih-fu, a model worker who
 commands the capital workers militia.  Ni is
 hardly a major political target, but the real
 architects of the urban militia movement are
 difficult to identify.  Wang Hung-wen's name has
 CI)been mentioned as a possible national militia
 leader, but the impetus behind the upgrading of
 urban militia is more likely to have come from more
 moderate regime leaders.  with the political left
 in disarray, any backlash is likely to be limited
 at present.
 One way out of the dilemma would be to reduce
 the emphasis on the militia while strengthening the
 Public Security Bureau.   While the Public Security
 Bureau has been rebuilt down to the local levels,
 it does not appear to have regained its pre - Cul-
 tural Revolution authority.   The organization, which
 had dossiers on most leaders, was deeply involved in
 political infighting during the Cultural Revolution.
 Many of the dossiers found their way into the hands
 of the Red Guards who used the information to attack
 party and government leaders.  There may still be
 resentment against the Public Security Bureau, no
 matter how revamped, on the part of those now-
 rehabilitated veterans whose influence is strong
 at the center.  The bureau--or at least its top
 leaders--were involved in political maneuvering
 after the Lin affair and the previous minister,
 Li Chen, is widely rumored to have been assassinated.
 Whether or not this will make Hua Kuo-feng any
 less bold, the urban militia movement has clearly
 run into problems in some areas.  The militia is
 ill-suited to handle security duties over the longer
 term, and the eventual return of the Public Security
 25X1A        Bureau seems inevitable.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN DISSEM/

 The Commitment to Tanzania:   Hardly Altruism
 Festivities surrounding the formal completion
 of the five-year,  $402 million Tan-Zam railroad in
 Dar es Salaam this fall and the probable attendance
 of a high-ranking Chinese delegation will bring into
 focus Peking'"s heavy investment in Tanzania.   Presi-
 dent Nyererets government is,  in fact, the leading
 African recipient of Chinese economic aid and the
 second leading recipient worldwide of military as-
 sistance from Peking.
 The Chinese will maintain a significant aid
 program and large numbers of personnel in Tanzania
 well beyond ribbon-cutting ceremonies on the Tan-
 Zam line.   Although the arrangements are not yet
 final,  several hundred technicians will probably
 stay on to assist in operating and managing the
 railroad.   The continued presence of about 300 Chi-
 nese now working on several small rural development
 and construction projects and of some 750 Chinese
 military advisers also seems assured.   Under a $74-
 million agreement signed by Peking and Dar es Salaam
 last year, the Chinese have also agreed to construct
 two rail spurs into coal- and iron-rich areas in
 northwestern Tanzania and to help develop these re-
 sources.
 Despite its scope and expense, the Chinese
 effort in Tanzania is not aimed primarily at short-
 term economic and political goals within the coun-
 try itself.   On the economic front, the Tanzanians
 have little that China needs in terms of raw ma-
 terials and the Tanzanian market is a minuscule one
 for the Chinese.   Politically, Peking certainly   .
 values Dar es Salaam as a reliable diplomatic ally
 and is undoubtedly pleased that Nyerere has bor-
 rowed from the Chinese model for his own domestic
 programs.

 Such gains, however, could probably have been
 achieved with much less expense, and Peking clearly
 views its considerable investment in Tanzania in
 terms of the long haul and the larger African--and
 Third World--context.   on this broader plane, Pe-
 king has attempted to create in its aid program in
 Tanzania a model demonstrating to other African
 and developing countries China's willingness to ex-
 tend generous and politically untied aid without any
 danger of foreign subversion or interference in in-
 ternal affairs.   To this end, the Chinese have ap-
 plied themselves to their aid projects in Tanzania
 with unusual energy--particularly the Tan-Zam proj-
 ect, which will be completed well ahead of sched-
 ule--while carefully avoiding any impression that
 they are pressing for direct influence over the
 country.   Peking,  in fact, has gone so far to limit
 the impact of its large presence on the domestic
 scene in Tanzania as to provoke some criticism from
 Tanzanian officials.   The low key Chinese approach
 has had the overall effect, however, of building
 trust and allaying suspicions both in Dar es
 Salaam and elsewhere in the region.
 The establishment of durable relations between
 Peking and Dar es Salaam has also given the Chinese
 an important leg up in their competition with Mos-
 cow for influence with regional black nationalist
 movements.   Peking has long acted as Tanzania's
 agent in training and equipping various guerrilla
 groups.   This direct Chinese access and backing
 from the influential Nyerere were instrumental in
 gaining Peking the inside track with Samora Machel's
 forces in Mozambique.   The Chinese are moving in a
 similar manner to develop a strong position in
 Rhodesia, where Peking long backed the Zimbabwe
 African National Union  (ZANU)  and has recently
 stated its willingness to train and equip the joint
 forces of the African National Council--an um-

 week of talks between Council leaders and Salisbury
 and the increased possibility that guerrilla opera-
 tions might resume in Rhodesia have played com-
 fortably into Peking's hand.
 While China is on the whole probably satisfied
 with the returns from its commitment to Tanzania,
 the relationship has not been without its strains.
 Strident Chinese calls for "armed struggle" in
 southern Africa and repeated warnings that efforts
 at compromise between black nationalists and the
 white-minority governments were "political decep-
 tions" leave little doubt over Peking's displeas-
 ure with Nyerere's--and Zambian President Kaunda's
 --support for talks between Salisbury and the Rho-
 desian nationalist groups.   Peking has also had to
 draw the line on continued requests for arms from
 Dar es Salaam and can only view as ingratitude
 Tanzanian questioning of the quality of equipment
 already delivered.   Tanzania's acceptance of
 $74 million of Soviet military assistance in 1974
 undoubtedly increased Chinese irritation.   Peking
 has been willing to play down such frictions, how-
 ever, and this is another measure of the central
 role Tanzania has played and will continue to play
 in China's strategy in the area.   (CONFIDENTIAL)

 The Restriction of Bourgeois Rights:
 Shades of the Great Lea  Forward
 Efforts to restrict "bourgeois rights" have
 '1 intensified recently as the movement to consolidate
 ?_,_,  he dictatorship of the proletariat continues.  The
 major targets of this phase of the campaign include
 free markets, private property, private plots and
 other types of sideline production.  Although these
 "bourgeois rights" are protected under the Chinese
 constitution--Chang Chun-chiao in his speech on the
 evision of the Constitution stressed that these
 -rights are a necessary supplement to the socialist
 economy--a recent Red Flag article indicates that
 he party's line now demands their restriction.
 The heaviest pressure appears to be directed at
 the free markets.  Free markets in some provinces
 have been closed and hawkers are subject to arrest
 by security officials and confiscation of their goods.
 Free markets in other provinces, however, remain
 open but are subject to stringent controls.  Opera-
 tions of the remaining free markets in Kwangtung are
 controlled by regulations apparently contained in a
 recent provincial level document.   The new restric-
 tions include limited operation of the markets every
 fifth day, strictly controlled selling prices, and a
 ban on selling goods covered by the state procurement
 system--rice, tea, wheat and flour to name a few.
 Moreover, hawkers are required to obtain certificates
 stating that their communes have fulfilled the state
 quota on those items being offered for sale.   Public
 security forces, special market personnel, and the
 militia have been mobilized to enforce these new
 measures.

 Although no clear policy toward the restriction
 of the other "bourgeois rights" has yet emerged, re-
 cent Red Flag articles indicate that any private
 activity which interferes with the collective process
 or is not included in the state plan will be restricted.
 The absence of any clear central direction has led to
 widely disparate methods of implementation in the
 rovinces.   In some provinces all kinds of private
 ctivity including private plots are being banned,
 while in others only the more flagrant offenses are
 being remedied.
 Although the movement to restrict "bourgeois
 rights" has many political overtones, recent articles
 are stressing the detrimental economic effects that
 result from the failure to restrict these rights.
 One report suggests that the recent poor harvest in
 ne area of Kwangtung was caused by too much atten-
 ion to private plots.  However, the last time the
 leadership tried to abolish private plots and other
 incentives during the Great Leap Forward the results
 were disastrous.   Peasant intransigence and bad
 harvests forced the leadership to retrench.
 These new attempts to restrict "bourgeois rights"
 are already meeting with public opposition.
 are even now complaining a ou
 food shortages and loss of income due to the restric-
 tions of these "rights."
 Besides the certain economic effects, the restric-
 tion of bourgeois rights may have other serious con-
 sequences, which could threaten the stability that
 the leadership is trying so hard to achieve.  Under
 the circumstances--a stricter birth control policy
 which uses rations as a disincentive plus youths
 without ration cards who have returned illegally from
 the countryside--the proliferation of black markets
 is inevitable.   Already hawkers in Peking and Kwangtung
 are avoiding the restrictions and militia patrols by

 selling door to door.  The expansion of black markets
 could also contribute to the rising crime problems in
 China's major cities.
 Whether the leadership continues to press the
 movement to restrict "bourgeois rights" in the
 face of certain opposition remains to be seen.   Con-
 cerns for stability and production may prevail and
 prevent the leadership from taking this next step
 toward full collectivization.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN

 China Trade Delegation To Visit the US
 A high-level delegation from China's Council
 for the Promotion of International Trade will arrive
 in the US on September 5 for an 18-day tour.                 The
 mission will be composed of leaders of the council
 and representatives of the machinery, minerals and
 metals, and native produce trade corporations.
 Meetings will be held with members of Congress,
 government officials, and US businessmen to discuss
 C Chinese exports and imports, trade exhibitions, and
 regional trade promotion offices in the US.  The
 Chinese will also want to discuss the legal issues
 in US-China trade, including most-favored-nation
 treatment, a subject on which the Chinese are in-
 creasingly vocal.
 China has expressed concern over the imbalance
 in US-China trade and has been seeking to promote
 exports to the US.   Early this year a Chinese tex-
 tile delegation visited the US; a mission from the
 light industry trade corporation will arrive here
 next month.  Last year, China's trade deficit with
 the US reached $700 million.
 US-China trade is off substantially this year
 //~~~~'^^ because of the sharp drop in Chinese purchases of
 (O US agricultural products.   US exports to China for
 the year will reach about $250 million, compared
 with $807 million for 1974.  Chinese exports to the
 US will total about $150 million, up from $115 mil-
 lion :Last year.
 For the first half of 1975, US exports to China
 were $147 million and US imports were $73 million.

 Nonferrous metals, textiles, chemicals, and

 through December.   No further imports of US grain
