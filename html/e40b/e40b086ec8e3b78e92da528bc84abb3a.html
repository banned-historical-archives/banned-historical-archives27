 CAMBODIA'S "MINIMIRACLE"-- CAN IT LAST?
 PNOMP?NH
 untrained,  -e u ppe   am   an
 Army, backed by U. S. air power and
 South 'Vietnamese ground forces, has-for
 the moment-created a "minimiracle" in
 this Communist-threatened land.
 When American troops pulled out of
 Cambodia on June 30 after smashing
 Red sanctuaries, predictions were wide-
 spread that the Government of Premier
 Lon No] would fall in a matter of days
 or weeks.
 At the time, Cambodia had a virtual-
 ly unarmed force of 35,000 men. Hard-
 ened North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
 troops were unopposed in Northeast
 Cambodia and moving out across the
 country.
 The former dictator, ousted Prince
 Norodom  Sihanouk,  was  calling for
 revolution.
 Encouraging signs..In mid-August,
 the situation is still critical. But most
 observers here are vastly encouraged by
 recent developments.
 The Government in Pnompenh is
 stronger than it was six weeks ago. The
 Army shows signs of developing a back-
 bone, having withstood two Communist
 offensives since the Americans departed.
 And, so far at ' least, Prince Sihanouk's
 cal for_ revolt in the countryside has
 he big factor is morale. Says one
 erican: "I haven't seen this kind of
 1l4ity since Pearl Harbor."
 tudents,  bureaucrats,  the  middle
 ss, and even peasants, have enthusi-
 ically joined the struggle against the
 my.
 he Government called for 200,000
 inteers-and got them. In small but
 nist forces, the Cambodians are throw-
 themselves into the fight. Often, it
 e more valor than finesse.
 rse. South Vietnamese troops are bar-
 ing the Reds in Eastern Cambodia.
 erican air power-both B-52 bombing
 ply lines, and tactical support of
 mbodian troops-plays a big role. One
 itary source says that, without this
 support, the Cambodians could not
 e held on-and would not be able
 ed problems. The Communists have
 er difficulties. Their old sea-supply
 through Cambodia-which in the
 past few years supplied
 most of their ammunition
 and arms for the fight in
 Southern South Vietnam
 -has been cut off. So has
 most of their rice supply,
 which used to come of-
 ficially  through  Siha-
 nouk's Government.
 And Cambodian villag-
 ers are hostile to the Red
 invaders, giving the Lon
 Nol forces more intelli-
 gence than they can use.
 There  are  still  the
 equivalent of at least
 four divisions of Commu-
 nists inside Cambodia.
 That means as many as
 50,000 fighting    men.
 Their command structure
 Is intact and they are
 consolidating in   the
 Nnrtlwa_nt, sent of the Me.
 kong River and west of the Vietnamese
 border.
 What are Cambodia's chances of sur-
 viving over the longer nun?
 Much depends on Communist strata'
 y. Most observers believe there will
 e no all-out attempt to bring down the
 on Nol Government by massive mili-
 ary action against this capital.
 Rather,  the  Hanoi-Peking  strategy
 ppears to be to consolidate in the North-
 ast-which the Cambodians have tem-
 orarily abandoned. From there, the
 ar  against South Vietnam can be
 continued.
 Puppet front. A long, hard war of
 ttrition-using the puppet government-
 n-exile of Sihanouk as a front-has start-
 d against Lon Nol's Cambodia. Targets
 f opportunity will be exploited around
 he countryside, with priorities given to
 eizing rice and-more important-to re-
 ruiting Cambodians for Sihanouk.
 The Government is settling in for a
 ong haul, hoping to maintain the initial
 nthusiasm and support of the people.
 The Government hopes to turn 60,000
 o 70,000 men into a first-rate righting
 orce. The rest of the new manpower
 will be used to guard villages, to police
 nilitary installations and to counter Red
 errorism. More American aid-not only
 he 8.5 million dollars in arms and equip-
 ent already promised and arriving-will
 needed.
 So will continued U. S., South Viet-
 amese and Thai air support. Especially
 ought will be American economic aid to
 ?ebuild Cambodia's economy, which was
 ankrupted by Sihanouk's policies be-
 ore be was ousted last March.
 Peasants hold key. Biggest question
 s whether or not the Communists can
 eke progress enrolling the peasants in
 heir ranks. The Communists "hold"
 ore than a third of the country-the
 egions east of the Mekong River. But
 hese are largely uninhabited. The Gov-
 rnment's challenge is to protect the
 peasants in more densely populated
 eas from Communist thrusts south-
 ward and westward.
 Confidence may be misplaced, but
 'ght now the Cambodians-and many
 erican here-believe Lon Nol just
 night survive. They say that only time
 tell if the "minimiracle" of the
 ast weeks can continue.

 THE OBSERVER, London
 9 August 1970
 P,  lie
 01,
 from GAVIN YOUNG:' Skutt,
 SKuN, Cambodia. S August
 A SCORE of young Cambo-
 dians killed in an ambush a
 day ago lie in the sun today
 just down the road from here.
 They are behind us-on what
 shoal;' be our ' safe' side.
 Ahead, round. the' next bend
 in the road, funnels, of smoke
 rise from the little red-roofed
 ,town- of Skun.  The crash and
 rattle of rockets and. machine-
 guns. extend into the great green-
 ness around us, even at our
 backs on the way to Kompong
 .sham, the key base.
 Cambodian   regulars  . and
 volunteers  are  now fighting
 hand-to-hand   and ? house-to-
 house with Vietcong and North
 'Vietnamese troops who occupied
 Skun  a  week" ago. . I  saw
 American and South Vietnamese
 jets machine-gunning and rocket=
 ting outside the town.  Skun
 may be recovered today or to-
 ?niorrow. It sits on a vital cross-
 roads on the main northern'high-
 'way only 35 miles from Phnoni
 .Penh, but the situation in this
 important region of Cambodia
 will still be serious.
 I was plummeted down to the
 gales of Skun by a helicopter
 manned by South ? Vietnamese
 pilots, cool as ice in slinky black
 Orin, , suits  with  tiger-head
 bad es, , accompanied  by  a
 Vietnamese  colonel  and the
 gentle-looking Cambodian com-
 mander, General In Tani ; two
 years ago, an unbelievable com-
 bination of nationalities.                  ,
 We landed on? a cratergd road.
 The helicopter soared prudently:
 away.  And something. amazing
 happened. Despite the Vietcong
 milling around in the tinder=
 ,growth,  about  50  sweating
 ;Cambodian soldiers, in motley
 battle-dress or . khaki shorts,
 charged out of their foxholes,

 cheering, clapping their hands
 above their heads,, jumping ,in
 ,the air with glee, rushiiig',to
 ,shake the General's hand. In
 ,one of the hottest war zones'in
 ,Cambodia, we were suddenly- in,
 a.sea of damp smiling faces.'
 Army morale . r.
 astounding '
 i The high morale 'of Cam-
 bodia's under-trained :Army is
 astounding.  It seethes through
 an increasingly battered country
 like high-tension   electricity:'
 These men have been fighting+
 around Skun day and night for
 110 days.  Some are peasants
 others are students, labourers,
 teachers. ? All are volunteers.
 'They      have   been  badly
 knocked    about. ;Ihe ' North
 Vietnamese   had  infiltrated
 around and behind them.     A
 column from Kompong Cham
 that was to have relieved therti
 was caught in the ambush that
 Yet 'they    had    held-with
 sporadic air support and no hell
 copters.  Now  they   proudly
 pointed out their battered slit'
 trenches. Some had Vietcong
 rocket craters only six feet away.
 All were ripped with bullets.
 'They kept creeping up in the
 dark,' a Cambodian corporal
 said. 'They shouted " Lay. down
 your arms ! " and we opened up
 on them crouching- there only 20
 yards away.' I saw the blackened:
 grass and-bushes where Vietcong
 or Cambodian grenades had ex-'
 ploded and the traces of 'Viet-
 cong blood. I asked a boy, beam-
 ing and clutching his Chinese
 '
 sub-machine gun :  'Are you
 scared? '  He said: ' i was.? But
 now I know;what'the .Vietcong'
 are like, not any moro.'. He cer-
 tainly saw a battle here.  The
 General gave each man a.wcek's,
 pay, on the spot.
 General In Tam' is a remark-
 ,able man. Over 50, he is an
 administrator by profession, now
 a soldier by choice-'to save the
 country against this foreign in-
 vasion.' He is Governor of Kam-
 gong Cham province where he
 was born and which he loves and
 used to tour .regularly.  He is
 balding, looks more like. an
 academic than a soldier, never
 carries ?a weapon, and has a
 wrinkled dark face like a friendly
 walrut. Ile could be safe in the
 capital; his duties as President
 of the National Assembly could
 keep him there. He prefers to be
 with his men. He has already lost
 a brother and five nephews in a
 war that is only four months old.
 Today his staff tried to stop
 him going to Skun in a vulner-
 able helicopter--' The general is
 far too rash.'  But he said the
 soldiers should see him. He said
 it like a professor talking about
 his favourite class.
 He had already spent three
 ',days and nights under shot and
 shell with his front-line troops at
 Skun earlier this week. He had
 personally extricated an encir-
 cled battalion.
 Like all Cambodians, without
 exception, he complains mildly
 but with justice of the lack of
 modern equipment for his men.
 Earlier, at his base in Kotn-
 pong Chant, which is itself under
 rocket attack, I asked him if the
 Cambodians could hold up under
 the recurrent if limited losses in
 the week-old wave of Vietcong
 attacks across the country. ' Oh,
 Yes. With time we can train and
 (reorganise the ridiculous army
 Sihanouk left us.' When he saw
 Cambodians killed, did he feel
 angry at the obvious delay in arms
 deliveries  'from   Cambodia's

 'Well, a little of that.'  lie
 miled. 'But it soon passes. We
 point.  Men, women, girls and
 toys are in  uniform, deter-
 minedly clutching guns.  I saw
 a dignified old man of about 60
 with white hair and Ho Chi Minh
 beard being .pedatlcd along in a
 cyclo, nursing is carbino.  In
 the big lycee, alrepdy twice hit,
 by long-range Vietcong mortars,
 while some students play basket-
 ba'll or study, others in rotation
 man well-protected gun emplace-
 ments in which they sleep.   A
 professor, strapped about with
 ammunition belt, grenades, and
 carbine, pointed to himself and
 said smiling:  'The; Duke of
 Marlborough goes to war, n'est-
 cepcs?'
 In a small house in. a back
 sMcct flanked by scarlet hibiscus,
 two French priests, the only
 foreigners left in the city since
 it was cut off, told me: 'There's
 'no panic here. The people seem
 relaxed. They've been expecting
 an alttack for weeks and they're
 becoming used to it.  Much
 better disrciptine, too. Before, if
 a shot went off, everyone in the
 town would be blazing away.
 They laughed at the recollection.
 One does not get the feeling
 that the Vietcong and North
 Vietnamese  arc  achieving  a
 major breakthrough in this essen-
 tial heartland, though as the Viet-
 namese liaison officer with the
 troops at Kompong Cham says
 of  the  si;tuation:  ' It's not
 pretty, eh ? '
 The Cambddian strength is in
 their will to fight and the fact that
 this is not a civil war. But there
 are major North Vietnamese
 units moving down, by river and
 truck, They are desperate for a
 really big psychological victory.
 Food prices are beginning to
 creep up in Kompong Cham.
 The Cambodians have other
 disadvantages beside a shortage
 of weapons.  General In Tam,
 that unusual man, will not allow
 Napalm in his region. Again.
 other towns have been destroyed
 by air attack before bcing1retaken
 from the Vietcong. The general
 here says. 'I must at all costs
 protect our civilian lives and pre-
 vent material damage.  So the
 fighting has been very hard in
 Skun. The enemy gets into the
 build ngs-even  pagodas-and
 want to destroy our own houses
 and temples, so it takes longer to
 retake a town and our losses may
 be greater as a result.  I would
 not allow aircraft to brmb Skun.
 Meanwhile Skun will be retaken
 and tho main road opened again.
 But only tentatively. It will be a
 risky drive from Phnom Penh to
 Kompong Cham for sonic time.
 Today as I stood with the General
 with his joyful troops yn the edge
 of Skun, two big trucks encircled
 by a strongly armed escort were
 creeping down the road behind us
 at walking pace. Because of the
 lurking enemy, it . would take
 them six hours to'-pick up the
 poor ambushed bodies, the gay
 scarves made up from the Cam-
 bodian and Buddhist flags still
 around their necks, and deliver
 them to the incinerators in Kom-
 pong Cam only 15 miles away.
 nderstand that this war hap
 encd very quickly. We were all,
 ncluding our allies, taken rather
 y surprise.  It lakes  time to
 unea back.'
 Cambodianshave been largely
 inned on the defensive in the
 resent hefty Vietcong and North
 Vietnamese push from the north
 owards Phnom Penh thait has led
 o heavy fighting around Koni-
 ong Cham and even inside a
 Major  town  dike  Kon-Npong
 hom from which the Vietcong
 ave been ejected. There have
 Ben  setbacks  at  Vkirirom,
 attles around Takeo in the
 oath, and shelling of places
 Barer to the capital. Bridges
 ave been mined. 'Cambodian
 ivilians were killed in a major
 ietcong a.mbuIh on the main
 oad to the port of Kompong
 om.
 :.Volunteers '
 turned away.
 All the time the Cambodian
 rmy-turning away hundreds of
 olmvteers by now-is feverishly
 raining. It is oulnianouvred and
 utgunned. But it is-not collaps-
 g.  It is even hitting back in
 reas like Skun. And though it
 is a small country, Phnom Penh
 does not seem threatened today.
 Cambodian soldiers may look
 gaggle-Maggie,  but  they  have
 seldom run away. Here I have
 met 15-year-old veterans of two
 or three battles.    And their
 morale is higher than any I have
 keen in a:nybody',s army in 10
 years of visiting wars,
 It is a strange and rare situa-,
 tion. Kompong Cham, the lush
 green ' second city 'of Cambodia,
 is cut off from Phnom Penh since
 Skun was lost last week.  This
 week it was more dike a city that
 welcomes attack more than it
 fears it.
 Two nights ago the crash of
 Cambodian heavy - mortars and
 the drone of low-civoling Ameri-
 can planes dropping flares over
 the Mekong rryer made sleep
 difficult. Every street corner has.

 The government of Gen.

 political base, partially, throug
 patronage,  partially  throug

 grams but mostly by appealin
 to the patriotism and solicitin
 the support of the peasant an

 The efforts are cautious an
 often tentative, and they can b
 undercut at any time, of course
 by serious military reverses:
 By most estimates, the Phno

 a third of the countryside, but
 perhaps .,two-thirds of the pr

 Turn for the Good?
 It Has Its Troubles,
 But Cambodia' Proves
 It's Not Any Pushover:
 Hanoi Said to Be Too Weak
 To Fight Two Wars; Meets
 An Unexpected Resistance`
 A Tale of Two Ferryboats;
 By PETER R.  KANN
 Stof! Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
 PHNOM PENH-The Bulgarian embassy
 ere is
 upholstered in plastic leopardskin. Its walls are
 decorated with travel posters showing beefy
 peasant girls harvesting grapes for the pro-
 duction of wines like "Bulgarplod."
 On one wall of the office of the Bulgarian
 charge d'affaires is a large road map of Cam-
 bodia, festooned with several score little red
 flags. The flags mark scenes of battle, but the
 map is sadly out of date. There, are no red
 flags on the towns of Kampot, Kompong Thom,
 Kirirom or a dozen other sites of recent com-
 bat.
 "It  is  unfortunate,"  says  the . charge
 d'affaires, "but we have run out of flags."
 The Bulgarians aren't the only ones who
 have been unable to keep pace with recent
 events in Cambodia. Four months ago Cam-
 bodia was the most peaceful and cohesive little
 country in Southeast Asia. Today it is barely a
 country at all.
 Within two months of the mid-March coup
 that toppled Prince Sihanouk, North Vietnam-
 ese and Vietcong troops had spread across
 most of Cambodia, even occupying the towers
 of the ancient Khmer kingdom at Angkor Wat.
 Today they are in full control of all of north-
 east and most of northern Cambodia-more
 than half the country's land area.
 Bone Hope
 What's ,more, the South Vietnamese effec-
 tively took control of large parcels of southeast
 Cambodia.  Thailand  currently  is  debating
 when to move troops into western Cambodia:
 American and South Vietnamese planes _fly
 bombing raids throughout most of the count
 as the Cambodian army lumbers from one db.
 fe*t to another in Pepsi-Cola trucks and gaylli
 painted buses. ,  ,           ?             .
 Most of Cambodia's rural population lives
 under the control of neither the Communists
 nor the new Cambodian government of Pre-
 mier Lon Nol. They live in political vaccuums
 that are gradually coming to be called "con-
 tested areas."
 "We are witnessing the Congolization of
 Cambodia, a country, disintegrating before our
 eyes," says a European diplomat. He notes
 that the tough and resilient South Vietnamese
 have been fighting continually for 30 years, but
 still, South Vietnam is in better shape than
 Cambodia, which has been at war for only four
 Months.
 But if Cambodia is far worse oft than it was
 tour months ago, most observers here now feel
 that its prospects of resisting a Communist
 takeover look a bit brighter than they did two
 months ago. At that time there was talk here of
 the siege, and even seizure, of Phnom Penh,
 and of the hopeless incompetence of the Cam-
 bodian army.
 Communist Aim Unclear
 Now observers speak of the isolation, rather
 than siege, of the capital ("Lon Nol looks
 pretty secure as mayor of Phnom Pehn;" says
 a Western envoy). They still talk of Cambodian
 military incompetence, but the word "hope-
 lesO often is dropped ("The Cambodian army
 used to run on rumors of a Vietcong attack,
 now it only runs when the VC start shooting,"
 says a foreign military attache). And they now
 tend to stress the problems and weaknesses of
 the Communists, as well as their strengths.
 These shifts in attitude may seem overly
 subtle. But this is a country where the word
 "uncertainty" takes on a definitive ring, where
 Westerners resort .to humor and cynicism to
 try to blot out the tragedy, where an "optimis-
 tic military assessment" translates into more
 death and destruction for a country that tum-
 bled almost by accident into the eye of the In-
 dochina war.
 It's not entirely clear whether the Commu-
 nists' aim has been to topple the Lon Nol gov-
 ernment, to pressure it into a sort of accommo-
 dation, or simply to gain time while they set
 about consolidating vast new sanctuary areas
 In the northeast.
 f   "I think Charlie has been hoping to pick up
 Cambodia on the quick and cheap, and it hasn't
 quite worked," says a Western military at-
 tache.
 'A Tough Decision
 This official and others now believe the
 North Vietnamese  face  a tough decision.
 Should they make Cambodia their top military
 priority and concentrate their 35,000 or so com-
 bat troops .on conquering the country? Or
 -should they just continue harassnients to keep
 the Cambodians off balance while concentrat-
 ing their energy and forces on the war in South
 Vietnam? Few observers here believe that the
 Communists can, at the same time, take all of
 Cambodia and seriously threaten the crucial
 southern areas of South Vietnam.

 Several analysts here think the Communists
 will concentrate first on Cambodia. They argue
 that the enemy for months has been scaling
 down to a low-level "protracted war" in most
 of South Vietnam and that it's in their interest
 to lie low there for another year or two until
 U.S. combat troops are gone. They stress the
 relative ease with which Communist troops can
 win victories in Cambodia, to the extent, they
 contend, of toppling the Lon Nol government if
 they really try.
 The majority of diplomats, however, seem
 to be betting the other way. They argue that
 Hanoi is committed-both by its ideology and
 Its nationalism-to concentrating on winning
 the war in South Vietnam. They suggest that
 victories over the Cambodian army may be
 easily won, but lack the Impact of defeats of
 South Vietnamese forces or infliction of heavy
 casualties on U.S.'troops. They say the war in
 South Vietnam's southern corps areas is cur-
 rently going so badly for the Communists that
 they must commit more forces there. And they
 add that Cambodia will inexorably fall to the"
 Communists if the Thieu government can be
 defeated in Vietnam.
 Idoreover, there's a g~owing realization
 here that Cambodia would be no pushover for
 'the Communists. The dispersal of Communist
 forces across so much Cambodian territory al-
 ready is said to be causing supply shortages.
 More Important, the Communists are outsid-
 ers-and unpopular ones-in Cambodia. Cam-
 bodians traditionally hate Vietnamese of any
 sort and have been trying to resist various
 Vietnamese Invasions for centuries. Here the
 Communists cannot follow Chairman Mao's
 dictum to move among the people as fish in the
 ocean; so far they look more like piranhas in a
 goldfish  bowl.  Even  diplomatic  sources
 vaguely sympathetic to the Communists set the
 number of Cambodians fighting on the same
 side with the North Vietnamese and Vietcong
 at less than 10,000. Other Western diplomats
 say even that figure is twice too high.
 Whatever their problems, the Communists
 are master organizers and have a potent prop-
 aganda line in reminding the peasantry that
 in the good old Sihanouk days peace reigned in
 the rice paddies. And though the Communists
 are having only marginal success in turning
 the Cambodian conflict into areal civil war,.
 the Lon Not government-despite some signs of
 growing competence-is hardly moving to win,
 mass allegiance in the countryside.
 The New Helmet
 The new government has strong support
 among organized urban groups: Army, civil
 service, 'students, intellectuals, businessmen
 and, some say, the Buddhist clergy. Civil ser-
 vants in,, paramilitary dress walk proudly
 around the city. Nearly everyone in the capital
 wears some,scrap of military uniform, Includ-
 ing the teenyboppers who outfit themselves in
 khaki bell-bottom slacks. It's not unusual to'
 find a portly Cambodian soldier beaming with
 pride as he sits down to dinner at a French
 restaurant with a new steel helmet perched on
 his head. Other soldiers then wander by his
 table. to admiringly tap the new helmet.
 All this esprit fades rapidly as one leaves
 the capital. Only 20 miles away is the town of
 Saang, four times battled over and now largely
 In ruins. All but a few score of its 2,000 inhabi-
 tants have fled. A Cambodian battalion, com-
 manded by a major who was teaching primary
 school three months ago, Is based in Saang.
 Three kilometers down the road the Vietcong
 are taxing, propagandising and conscripting
 villagers. The VC have been there for three
 months.
 It is midafternoon and the Cambodian bat-
 talion has scattered to sleep  among the
 charred remains of shops and homes. The pro-
 prietor of a soft drink cart seems to be doing
 a  booming  business  selling limeade to the
 troops, but he says he is scared and plans
 to leave.
 Between attacks the Vietcong send small pa-
 trols to snipe at the Cambodian troops, most of
 whom are barefoot. The Cambodians also send
 out occasional patrols, but they never venture
 farther than two kilometers from Saang. The
 schoolteacher major seems perplexed when
 asked why his troops don't venture one kilome-
 ter farther to harass the enemy. "We are wait-
 ing for heavy rains so the countryside will
 flood. Then perhaps the Vietcong will move to
 high ground, and maybe we can find some
 -boats and attack them," he finally replies.
 While he talks, a chicken nuns Across his feet.
 It is by far the most animated creature in
 Saang.
 Saang  notwithstanding,  the  Cambodian
 army is starting to fight, better. Observers here,
 are Impressed with the personal courage of
 Cambodian soldiers, willing to go into battle
 with ancient weapons, inadequate ammunition
 and negligible training against experienced
 'Communist troops, with superior firepower.
 Many Cambodian retreats have been incon-
 testable cases of discretion being the better
 part of valor.
 The Cambodian army is greatly expanded
 -from 35,000 troops four months ago to about
 150,000 now, though fewer than 100,000 have
 any arms at all and fewer yet have anything
 approaching military training: But, even at its
 ;best, the army Is fighting a defensive, urban-
 ioriented war, trying to, prevent the enemy from
 'occupying or harassing towns.
 -Admirable Calmness?
 Politically, the. Lon Nol government has dis-
 played what diplomats consider s., suprising de-
 gree of internal unity. The national crisis
 seems to be keeping personal politicking at a
 every low level, and the Phnom Penh rumor
 -mill is devoid of coup scares. "The coup stage
 will come later, after the colonels have won a
 few battles," says one European envoy.
 Some diplomats also credit the government
 with admirable calmness In a situation where
 many men might panic. Other analysts attrib-
 ute the seeming composure to simple Cambo-
 dian inertia. War or no war, government of
 flees still close for the day by 2 p.m. and cabi-
 net ministers are easily located in Phnom.

 CPYRGHT
 In its relations with outside world, Cam-
 bodia has displayed both sagacity and naivete.
 It has wisely managed to maintain at least.the
 pretense of neutrality by avoiding any formal
 military alliances with its South Vietnamese
 and That neighbors.
 The Cambodians, however, have been wildly
 over-optimistic in their expectations of Ameri-
 can military assistance. To date the U.S. has
 provided only captured Communist weapons
 and $8.9 million worth of radios, trucks, car-
 bines and other modest equipment. The U.S.
 presence in Phnom Penh is still so "low pro-;
 file" that there is no American ambassador,
 and a senior member of the American mission
 travels by pedicab from the tiny hotel room
 where he lives to the cramped little office
 where he works.
 The U.S. has been so tightfisted that when
 two Cambodian ferryboats were sunk by the
 Vietcong and later raised through American ef-
 forts, they were towed off to South Vietnam.
 The ferries sat in South Vietnam for nearly two
 months because some U.S. Navy officials there
 hoped to trade them back to the Cambodians
 for an American river patrol boat that the
 Cambodians had captured inside Cambodia
 during the Sihanouk days. The total value of
 the river patrol boat, Which the Cambodians
 presumably need more than the Americans
 anyway, is less than ;50,000. Yet for two
 months Cambodian military and civilian traffic
 was hampered by lack of ferries on the Mekong
 River. The ferries finally were returned late
 last month and the Cambodians, it seems, will
 get to keep the patrol boat-the only one in
 their navy.
 American pennypinching is difficult for the
 Cambodians to comprehend, particularly when
 they look at U.S. extravagance in Vietnam,
 where $8.9 million can be expended on artillery
 shells and bombs in a single day. Cambodian
 officials who had expected American bases and
 combat troops and a cornucopian outpouring of
 airplanes,  helicopters  and  other wondrous
 'weaponry, now find themselves being turned
 'down on a request for 100,000 ponchos to keep
 their troops covered in the monsoon rains.: ,

 MIDEAST CEASEFIRE
 A ceasefire between the UAR and Israel became effective at 2200
 GMT, 7 August 1970.     An integral part of the ceasefire on the UAR-
 Israeli front is a military standstill to be effective 50 kilometers
 wide on each side of the ceasefire line.   This arrangement was made
 only for the Israel/UAR front because the LIAR was the only country to
 repudiate the ceasefire resolutions of 1967; therefore the Suez
 Canal represents the main military front.   On the Jordanian and Syrian
 fronts the 1967 ceasefire agreements still apply; these agreements have
 not been renounced by Syria and Jordan.
 Subsequent to the announcement of the ceasefire U Thant reacti-
 vated the mission of UN Special Representative Gunnar Jarring to work
 for a peace settlement under UN Security Council Resolution 242, dated
 22 November 1967.   Jarring, at this writing, is consulting with the
 UAR, Jordan and Israel to initiate political talks.   The principles
 of the UN Security Council resolution are:   Israeli withdrawal from
 occupied Arab territories; the right of Israel and other countries of
 the area to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries;
 freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area;
 a just settlement of the refugee problem; and a guarantee of terr-
 torial inviolability.
 An irritant to the ceasefire and to political talks will be the
 activities of the 'fedayeen'.   The 'fedayeen' do not want peace, they
 do not seek peace and to them the idea of a ceasefire is anathema;
 their aim is to destroy Israel.   Nonetheless, in spite of their
 capabilities for raids and harassment they have no political base
 and there is some reason to believe Arab governments may ignore
 military actions between them and Israelis as long as Arab interest
 in maintaining the ceasefire continues.   Nasir has deprived Palestinian
 organizations in Cairo of radio frequencies and broadcast facilities.
 Nasir's foreign policy publicist Mohammad Heykal, editor of Al-At-hram,
 in his influential Friday column on 7 April, wrote that the Palestinian
 organizations could not possibly liberate Palestine "from the river
 to the sea."  Heykal discredited the comparison often made between the
 Palestinian and Algerian situations and said that liberation was
 possible in Algeria, but was not possible in Palestine.
 Iraq opposes the ceasefire.   Iraq opposes the LIAR policy of
 acceptance of the ceasefire.   The USSR has failed to change the
 Iraqi attitude.   Historically, Iraq has always opposed Israel and,
 technically, has been at war with Israel since the first Arab-
 Israeli war.   Iraq has no common border with Israel and Baghdad is
 600 miles from Tel Aviv.   Syria has given lip service to opposing
 the ceasefire but has privately let it be known that it will support

 the UAR position.
 Gunnar Jarring is trying to bring Israel and Egypt to a meeting
 place; Israel wants the talks to be conducted by Foreign Ministers and
 has suggested Cyprus as the conference site.   Jordan and Egypt want
 negotiations to start at a lower level, an Ambassadorial level with
 New York as the site and with the option of upping the level of partic-
 ipation to include Foreign Ministers who will likely be in New York
 for the UN General Assembly beginning 15 September.
 21 September is the half-way point of the ceasefire period.

 Distinguishing the Palestinian Commando Organizations
 All Palestinian commando organizations have the same basic aims:
 (a) the regaining of all of Palestine, including present-day Israel, and
 the establishment of a Palestine state which would include Muslims, Christ-
 ians, and Jews; and (b) the rejection of a peaceful solution of the Arab-
 Israeli impasse, and the use of armed force as the chief weapon against
 Israel.
 The Major Palestinian Organizations:
 1.  The Palestine Liberation Movement (Fatah), the largest commando
 organization, has no special allegiance to any particular state or political
 party.  In contrast, other major commando groups are sponsored by either an
 Arab government or a political party (sometimes both).
 2.  The nucleus of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine
 (PFLP) comes from the George Habbash wing of the leftist Arab Nationalist
 Movement (ANM).  The ANM's more extreme Marxist-Leninist faction, led by
 Nayif Hawatmah, controls the Popular Democratic Front for the Liberation of
 Palestine (PDFLP).
 3.  The Vanguard of the Popular Liberation War and its military arm, al-
 Saiga, are sponsored and controlled by the Syrian Government and the Syrian
 Ba'th Party.
 4.' The Arab Liberation Front (ALF) was created by the Iraqi Government
 and the Iraqi Bath Party.
 5.  The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded in 1964 by
 the Arab Summit conference as a quasi-governmental organization.  It has a
 regular army of its own, the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), and a commando
 unit, the Popular Liberation Forces, which was formed after the-1967 Arab-
 Israeli war.
 In February 1969, after al Fatah succeeded in taking over its control,
 the PLO began to function as an umbrella for the various commando organiza-
 tions and other Palestinian groups.  Its Palestine Armed Struggle Command
 (PASC) coordinates the release of information concerning fedayeen commando
 operations, and is also to coordinate_their military activities.  PASC now
 includes eight commando organizations.  The PFLP is the only.major fedayeen
 group which has not yet joined and which still continues to operate inde-
 pendently of PASC.  Efforts are being made to bring PFLP into both the PLO
 and PASC, but so far no agreement has been reached..

 Differences between the Commandos:
 1.    Party affiliations and sponsorship.
 Arab governments sponsoring commando groups have tended to give their
 time and effort to their own rather than to Fatah and other groups.  They
 have also'been suspicious of commandos sponsored by a rival government or
 political party and have at. times deported them or curtailed their activities.
 2.  Nature of cooperation.
 Disagreements have arisen over reorganizing the PLO and over representa-
 tion,in that body.  Fatah favors proportional representation, depending on
 the size of the commando organization, and is against equal votes for each
 commando group because t)ie,small groups could then paralyze action with their
 veto.
 3.  Smaller vs. larger groups.
 Fatah is against the formation of smaller groups because it feels that
 these are being used to'sap the energy of the, bigger organizations.  In con-
 trast, the small commando groups feel that they serve a useful purpose and
 reflect differences of opinion.
 4.  Class struggle.
 Most commando groups consider themselves representative of progressive
 national liberation movements.  The PDFLP believes that the commandos should
 only include the workers and peasants because of the collusion between im-
 perialism and the big bourgeoisie.  Fatah believes that this class limitation
 would weaken the movement and that Marx?s class breakdown is not applicable
 to the Palestinian situation anyway.
 5.  Palestinian vs. Pan-Arab movement.
 Some groups such as the ALF emphasize the Pan-Arab nature of the struggle.
 Others such as Fatah consider the conflict as primarily a Palestinian one
 linked with the Arab revolution.
 6.    PFLP strategy.
 Although the commandos sympathize with any attacks against Zionist, im-
 perialist, and Israeli interests, only the PFLP has engaged in terrorism
 against these targets abroad.  Fatah has registered its opposition to those
 activities, and at this time the PFLP is alone among the commando groups in
 undertaking them.

 THE COMMUNIST SCENE
 (18 July - 21 August 1970)
 The Communist Dilemma in the Non-Communist World
 A Communist party which sets out on the parliamentary road to
 power may have to repudiate the Soviet Union in order to prove its
 own independence.       To do so is to risk loss of Soviet support,
 guidance, and funds.   To build a democratic, vote-getting image, a
 national Party may have to open a small crack in the Party to dissent.
 Yet no Communist party could long survive real debate.   So compromise
 is inevitable.   How the Japanese, French, and Italian Communist
 parties are faring in this dilemma is described below (see also the
 attached press materials on these parties).
 Japanese Communism's Seductive New Look
 "In a country like Japan, where the parliamentary
 system is established... it is preferable to rely
 on peaceful and democratic means, through parlia-
 ment, to establish a democratic government by
 gaining the support of the majority of the people
 ".... It  Editorial from Akahata, organ of the
 Japanese Communist Party (JCP).
 In support of this new look, Japan's small but growing Communist
 Party held the first "open" Party Congress in history from 1-7 July.
 Unaccustomed as the newly proclaimed "friendly party" was to a really
 open meeting, it showed the public and press a picture of disciplined
 unanimity and sterile self-criticism which scarcely enhanced its
 democratic image.   To support its new and "forward looking" attitudes,
 it has condemned the extremist leftwing students, announced that
 opposition parties would be permitted to function in a Communist
 Japan, and demanded that the USSR return the South Kurile Islands to
 Japan.
 The latter demand is consistent with their calculated and
 politically strategic independence from both Soviet and Chinese
 Communist parties.   The long-standing rift with Soviets, although
 exacerbated by the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia, has no moral
 or ideological basis.   The JCP denounces the CPSU primarily for
 supporting a dissident Japanese Party faction expelled some seven
 years ago.   On the eve of the recent 11th JCP Congress the Soviet
 magazine Party Life accused the JCP of plotting to form a third
 force in the international Communist movement and, worse than that,
 of supporting Chinese efforts to split the movement.   (The Akahata

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 reply of 29 June is attached.)  The JCP, however, has also attacked
 Mao and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for "ultraleft opportunism"
 because the CCP also supports a dissident Japanese faction, one
 whose sympathy for militant students and urban guerrilla tactics
 clashes with the JCP's new image.
 This independent stance (without diminution of JCP participation
 in international Communism) and their lip service to bourgeois freedoms
 of speech and assembly may have been factors helping to increase the
 JCP's Diet representation nearly threefold in December 1969 elections
 and in raising membership figures to make the Japanese among the three
 largest CP's in the non-Communist world.
 Schizophrenia in the Italian Communist Party
 "Tell the Italian Communist Party to reject the
 role of an agent of foreign Communism and try
 sincerely to construct an Italian socialism,
 Italian in all its aspects."  Josef Smrkovsky,
 Czech parliamentary leader under Dubcek, in Il
 Resto del Carlino, Bologna, 30 June 1970.
 Within the largest of all non-ruling Parties are two serious
 splits which prompt the PCI to play both sides of the political
 street.   The first split is between those habitually loyal to the
 Kremlin and those who recognize the political necessities of the
 Italian political scene.   The second is between the "internationalist"
 group of the Party under Luigi Longo and the Soviet-supported
 right-wing group plotting to succeed the aging leader.   On the one
 hand Italian Communists have repeatedly defended "national roads"
 to socialism and have called for autonomy for all.   Consequently they
 have also denounced the Soviet takeover of Czechoslovakia--that
 touchstone of loyalty to Moscow--deplored Dubcek's ouster, and continued
 a polemical exchange with the present Czech regime.   Their words
 no doubt strengthen their appearance as an autonomous Party which is
 occasionally tested by other Italian parties as a possible coali-
 tion partner.   On the other hand, the PCI retains close ties to
 Moscow, has not rejected the consequences of the Brezhnev doctrine,
 has ousted its Il Manifesto group of Moscow-baiters, retains numbers
 of old line Stalinists in its middle ranks, continues to depend on
 t'he.CPSU for financial support and is occasionally caught doing the
 Soviets' subversive business (the arrest of an Italian courier in
 Venezuela a few years ago revealed PCI funding of Latin American
 CP's for the Soviet Union).
 This "democratic, independent" PCI has recently hinted that it
 may consider a coalition offer but its self-proclaimed strength with
 the voters may have been somewhat damaged in the 7-8 June elections.
 They scarcely maintained their 1968 voting strength of 28%.   The

 Party's failure to divorce itself from Moscow may have helped to hold
 down the vote.   Their hypocrisy may underlie the trend of decreasing
 numbers of members (down 640,000 since 1954) who are increasing in age
 (only 20% are now under 30).
 A Torpid'Fench Communist Party Clings to Moscow
 "In the Communist Party, the only democracy is
 that of the wringer."  Charles Tillon, life-long
 French Communist.
 The stagnant French Communist Party (PCF), losing trade union
 control, unable to increase its strength at the polls, and desperate
 for a political alliance with which to face the 1970 Spring elections,
 shows the great strain of the need to appear to be everything it is
 not.   Subservient to Soviet policy since its founding, the February
 Party Congress rejected the principle of national roads to socialism
 and upheld the USSR as the only Communist model.   The Stalinist
 nature of the French Party is the very reason why the social democrats,
 whom the PCF is wooing, have consistently refused the overtures.
 Two prominent French Communists are making the suit even more difficult.
 Roger Garaudy, long a critic of the PCF leadership, and now
 expelled from the Party, forced the PCF into publishing notes of a
 1968 conversation between PCF leader Waldeck Rochet and Dubcek in
 which the former expressed his disapproval -- echoing the Kremlin's --
 of press 'freedom and of the revival of the social democratic party
 which Dubcek permitted.   These were damaging words at a time of
 negotiation with French social democrats.   Garaudy relentlessly
 continues his attacks on the PCF, challenging them to denounce the
 Soviet rape of Czechoslovakia.   In June Charles Tillon, former
 freedom fighter and former cabinet minister, unable to stomach his
 Party's submission to Soviet diktat any longer, spoke out publicly
 on the same issue.   Tillon agrees with Garaudy that PCF silence on
 Czechoslovakia denotes complicity rather than "noninterference.'.'
 By July the Party reacted in standard Communist fashion for treating
 the unanswerable critic:   they again revealed their "democratic"
 procedures by ousting the 73-year old Tillon from the Party.
 Despite the furor over these public challenges, the PCF was still
 unmoved in late summer, permitting only one brief comment that they
 did not approve all that was happening in Czechoslovakia.   To concede
 more to their own heretics -- even for eventual gain -- may be too
 bitter a pill.  And the risk of losing Moscow's support for the
 multitudinous French Communist fronts and activities may still seem
 too great.

 THE "PRAGUE CRISES" OF WESTERN COMMUNISM
 By Arnold Kuenzli
 Frankfurter Rundschau (Frankfurt Review), Frankfurt/Main,
 December 1969, 2 January 1970
 Controversy Constitutes an Ordeal --;Neo-Stalinism Has The Parties
 in a Schizophrenic Position
 Editor's Note:
 "Western communism is in crisis.  Since the invasion of
 Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops there is growing criticism of
 the methods of the Soviet Union.  In many countries, new groups
 are forming within the communist parties, or seceding.  On the
 other hand,opposition members are barred from party membership.
 Our correspondent Arnold Kuenzli reports in a series of three
 articles on extent and significance of this crisis."
 The intervention by the Warsaw Pact countries in Czechoslovakia
 dictated by the Soviet Union has produced a series of shocks in
 the European communist parties which resemble a permanent crisis
 the consequences of which cannot yet be estimated.  This crisis
 is the more dangerous to those concerned because they are already
 in the process of losing their identity as revolutionary Marxist
 parties due to their loss of revolutionary momentum and because.
 _
 of their drifting toward the democratic parliamentary system in
 the sense of "social democratization."  The neo-Stalinism practiced
 by the present Soviet leadership has practically maneuvered these
 parties into a schizophrenic position.
 Whereas they lean at the national level more and more toward
 democracy, parliamentarism, multi-party system, and'political
 pluralism -- like the Italian Communist Party in particular --
 at the international level they still cultivate unwavering
 loyalty to an increasingly neo-Stalinist Soviet Union whose
 intervention in Czechoslovakia they had officially condemned.
 And this schizophrenia does not only threaten the party, but also
 the Marxist mdvemont es suc}h.  Ernest Mandel, for instance, --
 possibly the smartest Trotzkyite to be found today -- in an address
 at Basle recently condemned the Soviet action in Czechoslovakia
 as a crime, but that did not keep him from continuing to address
 the authors of this crime as '"comrades."  According to the rules
 of logic he should really have been'referring to 'comrade criminal'

 At least four major factions may presently be distinguished
 within the communist movement with respect to Soviet moves in
 connection with the 21 August 1968 in Prague.  The first faction,
 which includes primarily the old party cadres of long standing
 but also some of the older party members, as always considers
 the Soviet Union the praised fatherland of the workers.which to
 criticize would be the same as betraying socialism.  The second
 faction is represented by the party leadership and consequently is
 for the time being the official party line.  The latter is character-
 ized by a hodge-podge of more or less unmistakable criticism of the
 intervention in Czechoslovakia and of unconditionally sticking to
 the friendship with the Soviet Union and to the close action
 alliance with the Soviet bloc.
 The third faction is represented, above all, by prominent
 party intellectuals like the Frenchman Roger Garaudy.  They do
 not merely criticize     intervention in Czechoslovakia_ as such,
 but they also point to the neo-Stalinist roots'of this intervention
 and demand a radical theoretical overhaul of Marxism which ought
 to be finally adapted to the 20th century without, however, completely
 breaking with the Soviet Union which they still see as the light
 of hope for socialism even though it may be temporarily hidden.
 The fourth faction finally -- disregarding the China of Mao
 -- is primarily at home in Yugoslavia, but is also represented in
 Western Europe by individual intellectuals such as the Austrian
 Ernst Fischer and by the Italians Rossanda, Pintor, and Natoli.
 To them, the Soviet system is not even socialism anymore, but
 rather -- in the words of Yugoslav Aleksandar Sekulovid -- a form
 of medieval "popism" which exploits the workers even worse and grants
 them even less rights than capitalism.
 At the present time, there is fierce controversy between
 these various factions in almost all West European parties that
 almost.approaches  an ordeal.: In France, this controversy is,
 focused  . on the person of politburo member Roger Garaudy who,
 himself a former Stalinist, as a professor of philosophy is one
 of the most prominent Marxist theoreticians. in Europe, who has
 for years fought for "modernization" of Marxism, who is one of
 the initiators of the dialog between Marxism and existentialism
 and above all of the dialog between Marxism and Christianity, and
 who is equally well familiar with practice owing to the long time
 he spent in the Soviet Union and in Cuba.
 Garaudy's criticism of the dogmatist perversion of socialism
 is relentless.  His book.on Marxism in the 20th Century closes with
 the sentences, "There is a Buddhist proverb that warns us against
 this dogratist temptation,'When the finger points to the moon, the
 fool will contemplate the finger."' But the present controversy
 was primarily started by an interview      Garaudy granted the
 Yugoslav.party organ Komunist,     which the latter printed on
 4 September 1969.
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 In this interview, Garaudy said the socialist world movement,
 was in a crisis, and not just solely because of the Sino,-Soviet
 arguments.  This crisis, he said, had first of all become evident
 at the Moscow conference of the communist parties in June of 1969
 because the partial agreement reached there had been possible only
 because all important problems -- namely China, Czechoslovakia, and
 the. different approaches to socialism -- had been swept under'the
 rug.
 That there is so much stagnation in socialist thinking today
 was first of all due to having failed to analyze the situation in
 the capitalist countries.  The Moscow document talks in almost
 ritual form about the inconsistencies in the capitalist world,
 without pointing out, however, that these inconsistencies are
 no longer those of the 19th century, but rather new kinds of in-
 consistencies.  These new inconsistencies are not being considered
 and are not being analyzed, particularly not those brought about
 by the new scientific-technical revolution.  Neither are the structural
 changes being analyzed in the working class, in the relation of
 production and markets, or in the increasing importance of science
 for the development of production.  If all this were to be treated
 as superficially as in the Moscow document of June 1969, one is
 bound to get the impression that socialist thinking is affected
 by sclerosis.
 But the same type of stagnation prevails with respect to
 analysis of the socialist world.  The Moscow document confirms a
 tendency to deny the existence of dissension in the socialist camp.
 The "spring of Prague" had been an attempt by the. Czechoslovak
 Communist Party in a developed country to construct and implement
 a model of socialism in accord with the scientific-technical
 revolution.  The revolutionary forces in the world today are
 stronger than ever, but these forces are in vast areas outpacing
 the existing communist parties.  In Latin America and in Africa
 there are national liberation movements which are partly inspired
 by socialist ideas, but without there being any Marxist parties.
 He had been particularly shocked, however, by the fact that
 on the occasion of the anniversary of the intervention in
 Czechoslovakia both Prague and Moscow had blamed all difficulties
 on some sort of imperialist plot.  He would certainly not deny
 the presence of counter-revolutionary forces in Czechoslovakia,
 but it would be overlooking the real problems if all difficulties
 were to be blamed on some imperialist conspiracy.  Such an attitude
 would resemble that of President Nixon who blamed all demonstrations
 against Rockerfeller whom  he sent as an envoy to Latin America
 on a handful  of students.  "This reminds me of the time in France
 when the capitalist press and the bourgeois press was after each
 strike searching for 'some hidden conductor.of.the orchestra'."
 At the October meeting of the central committee of the French
 Communist Party, Party Secretary Waldeck..Rochet subsequently used

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 this Garaudy interview as pretext for a whitewashing job.  Garaudy
 -= who at the meeting was given a chance to defend his opinion he said had used the events in Czechoslovakia "to promote anti-
 Sovietism and to foster the opportunist factions."  Although the
 French Communist Party had expressed its disagreement with the
 intervention in Czechoslovakia, it had in the same resolution called
 for firmly combating the anti-Soviet campaign, and it had resolved
 "to continue and intensify its efforts to maintain and strengthen
 the bonds of solidarity with the brother parties and particularly
 with the Soviet Union."
 Disagreement on a particular question should never be allowed
 to raise any doubts in the fundamental solidarity in the fight against
 the common imperialist enemy.  "By contrast, if Garaudy's attitude
 were to be followed, it would lead-to intensification of the dissension
 in the international communist movement, and to weakening of the
 international communist movement as'well as to division of our party
 . .."  The Communist Party of the Soviet Union on.an international
 scale is the crucial force in the fight against imperialism and in
 ,the fight for socialism.  Garaudy, he said, was systematically continu-1
 ing to confuse the question of the approaches to attaining of socialism
 with the concept of the "model" socialism.
 Use of the term "model would open the door to all kinds of
 interpretations, including rejection of the general laws of socialism."
 Finally, Garaudy were violating the principle of "democratic centralism"
 and therefore was also in disagreement with the central committee,.

 fighting the Authoritarian Spirit in the Party -- Manifesto Group
 Wants to Reform the Italian Cotmunist Party -- Mao Ts Cultural
 Revolution to be the Model
 The Italian Communist Party stands out in international
 communism for two reasons:  in terms of membership it is the largest
 of the communist parties in the world that are not in power, and
 with the possible exception of the Swedish Communist Party it is
 the most democratic party both with respect to its internal
 structure and its political program.  It has abandoned the program
 of revolutionary takeover with subsequent one-party dictatorship
 in favor of a theory which is committed to radical structural
 changes, and which aims at establishment of a coalition of all
 forces that are considered progressive, including left-wing Catholics..
 It has wholly condemned the Soviet intervention in
 Czechoslovakia; but like the French Communist Party it nevertheless
 still considers the Soviet Union the most important. ally in the fight
 of international communism, and it has no intention of breaking with
 this ally but merely wants to maintain its autonomy.
 This policy has now come under serious attack from a group
 which formed around the pape l 11 Manifesto and which is headed by
 the three prominent party members Rosan a, Natoli, and Pintor.  Thee
 spiritual head'of this group is Rossana Rosanda, an  equally smart'
 and energetic lady who during the past 20 years has made a name for
 herself internationally as the leading ideologist of the Italian
 Communist Party.  Merely the fact that Rossana Rosanda has now
 assumed the role of chief partisan in the fight:against the party,
 establishment indicates the seriousness of the crisis that grasps
 the Italian Communist Party.
 In its opposition against the course of the party, the
 manifesto group is incommensurably more radical than. for instance,
 Roger Garaudy in his party.  This group would like to re-commit
 the Italian Communist Party to a radical revolutionary course
 in domestic and foreign policy, and to transform it into a
 "new party" through a cultural revolution within the party.  It
 fights against authoritarianism in the party and demands a "group
 dialectic" which would do away with the existing so-called democratic
 centralism that is fashioned after the party model of Lenin, and
 which would allow truly dialectic interplay of the opposing forces.
 This is supposed to be instigated by openly demanded insubordination
 and disobedience by the party membership.  This then means the
 manifesto group takes a similar attitude toward the party. establish-
 ment as some radical student groups take toward the establishment of
 their universities.  They are obviously guided.by the idea of
 the cultural revolution that Mao Tse-tung himself used to destroy
 his own rusty party machine,in order to revive the revolutionary
 zeal in the party.

 Possibly even more drastic are the foreign policy demands
 of the group, for it plans on no more and no less than ouster
 of the existing governments in the Soviet Union and in the Soviet bloc. It calls for the Italian Communist Party to break with the
 party and the government of the Soviet Union which in the opinion
 of the group have betrayed the revolution.  The group demands
 "formation of a left-wing, revolutionary alternative within the
 social' t camp," and "defeat and replacement of the leading groups
 in the fSSR and in other socialist countries by the initiative
 of a new bloc of social forces under the leadership of the working
 class." Here again the Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia.
 furnished the deciding motive for the formulation of these extremist
 demands.  In the opinion of this group, the revolution in the
 European East can, if at all, be saved only if the revolutionary
 process in the West is intensified and-accelerated, and when the
 West in 'this'`manner helps initiate the ouster of the leading groups
 in the East.
 Since the manifesto group began to draw more and more support
 from the party membership and primarily from the youth, the party
 had to react, even more so because Rossana Rosanda,.Natoli and Pintor
 were members of the central committee.  The central. committee ordered
 a control commission that had been especially established for this
 purpose, to investigate the activities of.the Manifesto group.  The
 three cultural,revolutionaries.were given an opportunity to defend,
 their opinions before the control commission.  Toward the end of
 October the report prepared by this control commission was then
 submitted to the central committee which took several days to
 'discuss the report, and which finally ratified the report --
 against the votes of the three villains,with Chiarante, Luporini
 and Lombardo-Radice abstaining..(Luporini and Lombardo-Radice advocate
 an enliihtened, democratic Marxism and are prominently involved in
 the international dialog between Marxists and christians).
 The control commission report submitted to the central
 committee by chairman Alessandro Natta in its basic political
 attitude is largely identical to the stand taken by French party !  :
 secretary Waldeck Rochet in his controversy with Roger Garaudy.
 Natta denounced the policy of the manifesto group as being
 reckless, futile, and impotent, saying it did not constitute a
 critical, scientific contribution to the reality of the socialist
 countries.  This policy would isolate the Italian Communist Party
 from the Soviet Union and from other socialist countries, and this
 would also mean isolating it "from the anti-imperialist fight of
 the Vietnamese people, and of the people of Asia, Africa, and
 of the Near East, because it is just this relation to the USSR
 s:
 and to'the socialist countries that is the key to this fight."  It
 would."largely destroy the unity of the party.!'  Therefore, anti-
 Sovietism in any form or shape should be rejected.  In fact, what
 was involved in the group's criticism was not "criticism from the
 left," because it "did not in any manner differ from the positions
 of the right firing, that is, of ultra-social democraty."

 Enrico.Berlinguer, the "crown prince" of thetparty, on a
 conciliatory note subsequently sought to leave the door open for
 the manifesto group.  He assured there was no desire to proceed with
 administrative measures against the group but ratheir in the contro-
 versy with the group "to see the most democratic way through to the
 end."      A gesture of obedience would not be required! nor would.
 silence, but the controversy would have to remain within the party,
 and there was.a limit to forming factions that.shoild not be exceeded.
 He finally charged the group's call for breaking with the socialist
 countries were  "tantamount to dragging the heritagb of the October.
 revolution through the mud."
 We will not explore any further in how far the unshakeable
 ,pro-Soviet attitude of the western communist parties is a result
 of their financial dependence on Moscow (just one ekample:  in Austria,
 -Moscow has aa~ubstantial financial interest, in the, ubl.ishing house
 and in the press which publish all publications. of the Austrian-
 Communist `Party).  Berlinguer's stand makes clear that taking
 this pro-Soviet attitude at its ideological face value is tanta-
 mount to equating the goals of the Russian October revolution --
 which claimed Marx as basis -- with the present Soviet system.
 But this is precisely what the growing opposition within
 the western communist parties contests; in the eye:; of this op-
 position, the present leadership in the Soviet Union has'so
 obviously betrayed the goals and the spirit of the October
 revolution and of Marxism (even Trotzky had already written of
 a "betrayed revolution") that a break with these traitors ought
 to be made for the sake of these goals and for the sake of this
 spirit, particularly after the intervention in Czechoslovakia and
 the developments there since then.  To accuse instead the
 opposition of treason would be the same as hitting the barometer
 because it indicates bad weather.
 The mediation efforts of Berlinguer were not to be successful.
 The manifesto group stuck strictly to its view, and the party in
 its bad predicament did resort to disciplinary  measures after all:
 the three cultural revolutionaries were first expelled from the
 central committee, and finally also from the party.  It is not
 yet possible to say what further course this crisis may take, but
 there is every indication that this expulsion, which was already
 followed by further expulsions, intensified the crisis even more.

 was a spokesman of the youth organization of the Swedish Communist
 Party.  This incident -- and  it  was not the only one -- occurred
 in September 1969 at the 22nd Party Congress,,of the`Swedish
 Communist Party.
 C. H. Hermansson, chairman of the Swedish party, in recent
 years went further than any other communist leader in the matter
 of the party moving toward democratic-parliamentary methods.
 He went as far as declaring publicly that his party if it should
 come into power through elections, would in democratic manner go
 back into opposition in case it should as,a government party be'
 defeated in subsequent elections.
 This policy is opposed on the one hand by a hard core of
 old Stalinists, and on the other hand by   communist youth who --
 similar to the "manifesto group" in Italy -- rejects both the
 Soviet system and the policy of "growing into the capitalist system"
 of its own party.  But even Hermansson could not make himself
 immune against the schizophrenia.of on the one side in domestic
 policy supporting the parliamentary system and on the other side'
 continuing to promote the cause of unconditional solidarity with
 the Soviet Union despite all outright' criticism of the intervention
 in Czechoslovakia.
 At the party congress he declared, for instance, ""solidarity;
 with the people of the socialist countries to our party has always,
 been something that was  self-understood.  It still is a matter
 that goes without saying.  Developments in the international
 f
 our
 situation havebrought some complications in the form o
 relations to these countries.  Differences of opinion . . . have
 become strongly evident."                       But "we do not wish to participate
 in any manner in the anti-socialist propaganda that constantly
 tries to discredit the socialist countries.  Those who believe
 that our party will howl with the wolves against the socialist

 those who believe they can lead the party back to that period in,i
 the past when some tried to replace clear and truthful analysis
 with blinders and duplicity."  The party will be "threatened by
 consumption and decay unless we sharply improve our party work."
 The party congress became quite turbulent because particu
 larly the party youth did not mince any words.  As a result,
 past party secretary Bridjof Lager accused the party youth --
 of anarchism,  "the young anarchists are characterized by a
 pronounced negativist attitude.  They oppose everything that'is
 proposed or said by responsible party sources.  These young
 delegates behaved like a bunch of sparrows . . .."  The "official"
 party.line'was finally adopted -- after renewed demands for
 withdrawal of all foreign troops from Czechoslovakia -- but the
 sharp internal conflicts persist.
 Hardly anywhere has the drama of communist self-destruction
 taken such irrational turns as in the Austrian Communist Party.
 Ernst Fischer, an old friend of Dimitrov and Togliatti and the

 most prominent intellectual of the party who had faithfully served
 the party during an eventful life. described with uncompromising
 honesty in his fascinating recently published autobiography, was
 after much hem and haw finally expelled from the Austrian Communist
 Party.  Since the famous Kafka Conference at Liblice Palace near
 Prague, Fischer had been prominently involved in pr`bparations for
 the "spring of Prague", and no communist condemned Soviet inter-
 vention in Czechoslovakia as relentlessly as he did.
 He declared on Austrian television that a dictate were
 no agreement because there could be no agreement between wound
 and knife.  He called for formation of a new left in opposition
 to the intolerant and monolithic old left, and said in answer
 to questions put to him by the party arbitration commission charged:
 with dealing with his "case", among other statements, "I have
 frequently erred along with the party (when I thought of Stalin
 as the legitimate successor of Lenin, when I defended the Moscow;
 trials, when I opposed Tito, and so on).  I may also be in error`.
 inkopposition to the party; and I reserve this right.  I will
 never be prepared to accept the desolate conditions caused by
 the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia as 'normalization.'  The
 anti-Semitism ordered and organized by the power machine in
 Poland forced an exodus of Jews.  I will, whenever and wherever
 I can, contradict the lie that this anti-Semitism is due to
 the existence of Isreal or due to a 'Zionist conspiracy', and
 I will brand the methods practiced by the Polish power machine
 as being fascist.  There is nothing that is as revolting to the
 young generation as uniformed dogmatism and ideology standing at
 attention in strict formation.  An intolerant machine only serves
 self-satisfaction."
 With a Kick in the Back
 Fischer's friend Franz Marek, a highly intelligent man who
 was heavily influenced by Antonio Gramsci, and who as chief editor
 of the party journal Weg and Ziel had published the only really
 alive and interesting German-language communist journal, was fired
 with a kick in the back, without regard to his financial situation.
 This had the result that the opposition now has established its
 own paper called Wiener Tagebuch which now continues the tradition
 that Marek established with Weg and Ziel in refreshingly unorthodox
 manner and unfettered by party dictates.
 Since youth in the Austrian Communist Party is also rebelling
 against the,party machine, the latter has made preparations to
 dissolve th  youth organization of the party.  About one-third of
 the central committee is on Fischer's-and Marek's side, and the
 already inconsequential party is threatened by.ruin.  The'Wiener
 Tagebuch has this to say on the matter, "Artists, in whose state
 medals  ne had exalted, are leaving the party; plant union leaders,

 electionsfl are resigning their party functions; locals are closing
 down; and most of the young activists are, in the true sense of
 the word,.driven away -- but one continues unperturbed along the
 course of the.Prague example."
 The example of the Japanese Communist Party is highly
 interesting by contrast.  After the Italian party, this party
 is the second largest of the communist parties in the world
 that are not in power.  During the past five years alone it.
 raised its membership from 150,000 to 300,000.  After Khrushchev
 tried, with the support of a particularly pro-Soviet faction
 within the party, to gain influence over the party itself,
 the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party began'a "war on
 two fronts" by dissociating itself both from the "modern
 revisionism" of Moscow and from the "dogmatist factionalism"
 of Peking.  The intervention in Czechoslovakia was subsequently
 instrumental in further worsening     relations between the
 Japanese Communist Party and Moscow.  As a'result, and in contrasts
 to the European communist parties, the.Japanese Communist Party
 finally refused to participate in the June 1969 Moscow conference
 of the communist-partieso

 Party of Japan as one of the

 nist  parties in                     the  world
 confronts  Eastern Europe
 with a major new factor in
 the world Communist move-
 ment.
 East European countries
 like Romania and Yu ,osla-
 via seeking some counters
 to Soviet pressure tend to
 look toward China. But Pe-
 king's militant ideology is
 not an ideal alternative for
 East European Communist
 parties which hope for in-
 creased stability.
 . The "Communism with a
 human face" program now
 adopted  by  the  Japanese
 Communist    Party  in  the
 long run will probably be
 more acceptable 'to the neu-
 tralist wing in Communist
 Eastern Europe.
 Japan's Communist Party
 advocates   freedom   of
 speech, assembly and reli-
 gion. It has condemned both
 Moscow and Peking for in-
 terfering in the affairs of
 other  Communist parties
 and for their big-power poli-
 cies.
 It defends national inter-
 ests and would appear to
 come closer, for example, to
 the Romanian wish for sov-
 ereignty, independence and
 non-interference in relations
 with other states and par-
 ties.
 Behind the Japanese Com-
 munist Party and its grow-
 ing; electoral success'looms
 the economic potential of
 Japan. Expert speculation
 has projected Japan's eco-
 nomic buoyancy into a time
 toward the end of this cen-
 tury when it may become
 he world's second biggest
 ndustrial power, far ahead
 if China.
 If the Japanese Commu-
 ists continue to win sympa-
 hizers, observers in Eastern
 urope believe that the Jap-,
 nose  party  will  emerge
 ater in this decade as a
 hallenge to both the Sovitjt..
 nd Chinese movements.
 In any case, lthe Japanese
 arty is already a considera-
 le  force  in  the divided
 orld movement, and has
 chieved a new position of
 trength during the past few
 ears.
 Since 1966, party member-
 hip has risen by 100,000 to
 ell over 300,000.
 In- elections last Decem
 er, the Japanese party won
 he backing of 3.2 million
 oters-one  million  more
 han in the January, 1967,
 lection-and increased its
 epresentation in the lower
 ouse, of parliament from
 our to 14 members.
 This  is  still  relatively
 mall in a nation of 100 mi1-
 ion with a 486-seattlcgisla-
 ure, but it is significant as
 art of an overall trend.
 In Eastern Europe, the at-
 cntion  of the communist
 ulers.has increasingly been
 ocused on Asia. This is due
 in part to an easing of Euro-
 pean tensions, and in part to
 China's new efforts to wild
 friends and influence peo-
 ple.
 New and better East-West
 relations  are  shaping  up
 under the determined drive
 by west Germany to open
 doors to Eastern Europe by
 settling, frontier and related
 problems still left over from
 World War II.

 10 July 1970
 The 'Miyamoto' Communist Party
 The 11t   apan  Communist Party Congress, which
 ended a week-long session last Tuesday, saw Dir. Kenji
 Miyamoto, the strong-armed leader, complete his takeover
 of the party. Special Interest was also focussed on this
 convention, which was last convened four years ago.
 because It was widely publicized as being the first, ever to
 '1e opened to the press and the public.
 It had a significance also in the fact of its being held in
 the opening months of the 1970s-which the Communists
 have claimed will see a final showdown between the JCP
 land the Liberal-Democratic Party.  For this purpose the
 Communists had promised allout efforts to build up a new
 Image as the "friendly party."
 Mr. Miyamoto himself was named to the newly created
 post of the chairman of the presidium of the party's central
 ,committee.  Mr. Sanzo Nosaka, the veteran JCP leader,
 was selected for his fifth term as chairman of the central
 committee, but Frignificantly, he has been dropped as a
 member of the very organ of which he is the chairman.
 This. Is one of the signs that Dir. Miyamoto has now taken
 over full control of the Communist Party.
 A surprise selection, though not wholly unexpected,
 Was Mr. Tetsuzo Fuwa's emergence as the director of the
 central committee secretariat.  This is also a newly created
 post which is equivalent to a secretary general in other
 .parties: For Mr. Fuwa, a House, of Representatives mem-
 ber, this Is a four-rank promotion over his seniors In the
 ,arty. But he Is a bright young man whom some journalists
 `have already named "the prince of Yoyogi." He is naturally
 'one of Mr. Dllyamoto's group of youthful proteges, many
 .of whom have now advanced into the central committee.
 With Dlr. Nosaka relegated to a position of figurehead and
 with no other rival in sight, It is now clear the JCP Is the
 ?'Miyamoto" Communist Party.
 It may be partly because of 'Mr. Miyamoto's confidence
 tof being in complete control that the JCP Congress was
 ?'opnded" for the first time in its history. This may be con-
 ?sldered a remarkable "progress" for the Communists. But,
 .of course, they had no other choice, since they wanted so
 much to change their public image.
 It should be noted, however, that the meeting was.
 "open" In only a.limited sense. The party leadership's pro-
 ?ISosals and the comments of the delegates were made pub.
 Ile. But the selection of? the officers and the reading of the
 financial report and other matters which get at the core.
 of the party operations were held in complete secrecy. It
 would seem the JCP.s-till' has many things they dare not
 1tjring out into the open.
 The comments of the delegates also went no further
 'than to recount past actlvltles and to Indulge In much eelf-

 criticism.  Not one critical word was spoken against th
 reports and resolutions of the central committee. The lac
 ,of even a single dissenting voice made for a sense 0
 unreality at the public sessions.
 . But then it should not be surprising that the leopar
 cannot change its spots.  Although it has expressed it
 'desire to become a "friendly" party, the JCP has yet t
 deny the possibility of its ultimate resort to armed and vi
 lent revolution to set up a dictatorship of the proletariat
 11r. Fuwa, the party's eloquent and rising theorist, ha
 skirted around the issue by saying that "there has been n
 example of an armed revolution taking place In a highl
 developed capitalistic nation," and that the JCP wool
 strive "to become the majority party in the Diet."
 Yet, the party program still retains the statement tha
 the final guarantee of liberation depends on the establish
 ment of a proletariat dictatorship."  Indeed, what prevent
 the Communist leaders from coming right out to rejec
 the resort to an armed revolution and the setting up of .
 dictatorship of the proletariat?  Is it because they wool
 lose their raison d'etre?  But unless they make the pledg
 against a resort to an armed revolution, they cannot expec
 popular support.
 For the 1970s, the JCP goal Is said to be a growth whit
 -will enable it to engage the LDP in a showdown battle fo
 power. But in reaching that stage, the Communists see th
 need of going through the interim process of setting up
 ?'United Front-Democratic Coalition Government," whit
 would bring the parties of the left opposition togethe .
 against the Liberal-Democrats. This grand coalition of th
 ]eft would naturally, as far as the JCP is concerned, b
 under Communist domination, although the other partle
 may have their own ideas. But it would be. presumed tha
 the Communist plan would be that by the. latter part o
 .the 1970s they would have absorbed their erstwhile coil
 leagues to pave the way for the final confrontation with th
 LDP.
 The question which this prospect raises is what wil
 happen after the Communists take over.  They make n
 mention of this, of course.  But can we really trust th
 Communist claim the JCP is now an "open" party believln
 in such democratic processes as elections, parliament an
 multipolitlcal parties? Mr. Miyamoto has said, "The impo
 tant thing now Is tojjestablish a democratic coalition throug
 the Diet and elections."' The "now" in his statement sound
 ominous. We would say that the "friendly" image the JC
 Js trying to sell is a sham. We say this because the "Miy
 ntoto" Communist Party is putting on a soft-sell while stil
 retaining every bit of its old-fashioned Marxist dogmas.
 We must not' lose sight of the steel armor which lie
 under the JCP camopflage.                                                         `

 Communism with
 a democratic face
 Japan's communist party is out to prove
 that it is a communist party of a new
 democratic breed.  Last week, as the
 first step in an image-building campaign,
 the party opened the doors of its tradi-
 tionally secret congress for the first time
 in its 48-year history. The congress went
 on to commit the party to seek power
 by winning votes and to remain indepen-
 dent of both Moscow and Peking.

 in parliamentary politics could hardly
 be faulted. They declared that they

 of  a  49-year-old Tokyo   University
 graduate, Mr Tetsuzo Fuwa, for the new
 post of party chief secretary as an
 example of the new-style communist.
 The party's decision to concentrate on.
 election  drives  follows  a  15-year
 struggle  to  strengthen   the  party
 organisation. Party membership has

 AKAHATA, Tokyo (Organ of the JCP)
 29 June 1970
 Soviet Communist Part   ~urnal "Para  Life" Caries Treatise Criticizing JCP
 According to newspaper reports and.a Soviet News report, the 13th
 Issue of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's organ journal
 "Party Life" carried a treatit3a which severely criticizer] and attacked
 the Japan Communist Party in connection with tho,gontsntq of the 13th,
 Party Congress draft resolution.
 This treatise took up such points as that the Japan Communist
 Party did not attend the Conference of the Variout.Pertie~s held in Moscow
 last year, that it-does not stand on the theory of the completion of
 the revival of Japanese militarism, that it takes a critical attitude
 toward the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, that it opposes big power-
 ism and is advocating an autonomous and independent standpoint, that it
 opposed the aggression against Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union and
 others, and that it calls for a fair and just settlement of'the Kuriles
 question; and it criticizes the Japan Communist Party using the severest
 terms, such as that "objectively viewed, it is lending a hand to the
 enemy of the unification,of the communist movement," that "the Japan
 .Communist Party is following a policy line which isolates it from other
 Marxist-Leninist Parties," that "this is, a new attack of anti-Sovietism."
 that "there is a danger of making the Party itself a slave to the views
 of bourgeois nationalism," and that "the possibility of Its becoming a
 ,tool of the imperialist ambitions of Japanese monopoly capital cannot be
 ruled out completely."
 Six years ago, when the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committtee
 one-sidedly announced the letter, dated April 18, 1964, in which it it rudely
 and slanderously attacked the Japan Communist Party and its policy line, in
 the days when KHRUSHCHEV was the First Secretary, it was also announced in
 this same organ paper called     "Pcrty,Life.."..The criticism this time
 'takes exactly the same rethod as the way followed in the dayn of KHRUSHCHEV,
 not only in the point that it was carried in the same journal, but also.:
 !in such points as that it criticizes. everything that is not in complete
 accord with the assertions and standpoint of  the Soviet-Communist-Party.
 as "the enemy of unity" and "bourgeois nationalism," and in its contents.
 The, point to be especially noted is the fact that the'treatise
 appearing in this journal "Party Life," says that "no one is infringing
 on the Japan Communist Party's independence and autonomy,"     that "the
 'Soviet Communist Party has no iptention of interfering in the Japan.
 Communist Party," and that it says noticing at all about the problem of
 the attitude of the Soviet Communist Party toward the anti-Party
 schismatic elements of the SHIGA Factionq which is the biggest-problem
 worsening the relations between the Japan Communist' Party and the Soviet
 Communist Party.
 To begin with, the anti-Party organization of the SIIIGA Faction
 was the product of the big-power-type interference by KHRUSHCHEV and
 others of the Soviet Union.  When the SHIGA Faction formed the anti-
 Party organization of the "Voice of Japan," six years ago, the Soviet
 Communist Party's organ paper "Pravda" highly praised SHIGA, saying that

 he is "a patriot, a loyal son of the people, an internationalist, and hn
 activist devoted to the project of peace, democracy and socialism."  That
 the Soviet Communist Party openly supported these elements' anti-Party
 activities is a historical fact which no one can erase.  Furthermore,
 the relations between the Soviet side,ard the "Voice of Japan" faction
 have still not been clearly liquidated,, o''er, after the Japan-Soviet
 Communist ' Party Conference in February, 1B, `s,here the Soviet delegates
 firmly declared that there will be no relations with them in the future* Finally, as we criticized in the May 5 edition of Akahata, they finally
 increased their interference, even to the point of persons connected with"
 the Soviet Embassy openly attending-a meeting of the anti-Party SHIGA
 Faction, and encoui+aging it.  The basic cause (O1.the worsening of
 relations between the Japan Communist Party and the Soviet Communist Pex'ty
 lies i n this .
 On' this, question, tbo, however, the -"Party Life" treatise says,
 in regard to Akahata's criticism, that "thiaT'was done by persons working
 in the Soviet Pavillion at the World Exposition in'Osaka" and that it is
 not worth criticizing as interference,;.  It'also said that  the fact that
 it can list ?"only'such a laughable reason," "proves better than anything
 else the Soviet Communist Party's position, based on principles, and the
 fact that the Soviet Communist Party,is strictly upholding the rules'
 concerning relations between parties."    It puts forward the above
 "refutation."  However, none of the events concerned were connected
 with the World Exposition.  Especially, tthe,rally in Tokyo, attended by.
 the members of the Soviet Embassy, was a meeting directly sponsored by.
 the anti-Party organization of "the Voice of Japan."  Furthermore, at
 that meeting, Yoshio SHIGA, who calls himself the National Chairman of
 this anti-Party organization, personally delivered a "commemorative
 lecture," attacking the Japan Communist Party.  To attend such a rally
 and to deliver an address of encouragement is nothing      but.
 encouragement of and support for activities to overthrow the Japan
 Communist Party.  It is clear to anyone *ho has even a small understand-
 ing of "Party life" for a Marxist-Leninist Party, that this is ,not
 simply a "laughable" minor matter, and that it is a grave infringement-
 of "the Japan Communist Party's independence.and autonomy," and that it
 is the worst possible "interference."  Does the "Party Life" journal
 really think that it can' make others, believe that this-was not inter-
 ference, by bringing up the "World Exposition," as -an excuse for this
 serious interference?                               "
 If the "Party Life" journal persists in asserting that this
 interference is within the scope of 'activities of the Soviet_Communist'
 Party, "based on its principles," than it means that it is declaring
 itself that the "principles" of the ? Soviet' Communist?Party run counter
 to the accord reached by the international communist movement in the 1960
 Declaraition o' and that they ars based .i an anti-Harxist-Leninist stand.'*

 BOFFA COMMENTS ON DUBCEK PARTY EXPULSION
 By Giuseppe Boffa
 Slightly over a year ago, the CC of the Czechoslovak Communist
 Tarty showed that, when Dubcek was replaced by Nusak, it held the
 outgoing first secretary in high esteem.  A few hours later the
 country's President Svoboda made himself the interpreter of this
 esteem by a speech that was transmitted over radio and television.
 Confirmation of this homage did not appear to be a mere formality,
 for Dubcek retained his post in the party Presidium and was, more-
 over, assigned another authoritative political post -- chairman of
 Parliament.  The other day Dubcek was deemed unworthy of being even
 a party member.
 It is true that this year, beginning last summer, an intense
 campaign of accusations was conducted by a part of the Czechoslovak
 press against the leader who had guided the party during the "new
 course."  Dubcek was never able to reply to these charges publicly.
 At any rate nothing that was substantially new was said during that
 campaign, i.e.,(nothing that had not been carried in preceding
 months by the press of the 5 powers which intervened in Czechoslovakia
 and hence that; was not known a year ago, when esteem for Dubcek was
 expressed and he was retained as a party leader.
 Nor, judging from what we have seen in the Czechoslovak press,
 has Dubcek been involved in actions that could have modified so
 drastically the judgement of him.  Nor is it possible to understand
 how even the criticisms directed against him could imply the impossi-
 bility of his continuing to work for his country in a post like
 ambassador to Turkey, which Dubcek had accepted as a disciplinary
 measure and to which he had been assigned a few months ago.
 We know what Dubcek was and has been.I  His soldiering on
 behalf of the party lasted for 30 years.  He came from a family of
 old communiato, and he was shaped by the party during the Slovak
 resistance, above all In his country, then in Soviet higher political
 education institutions, and finally during the work to construct a
 socialist society.  To be sure, few individuals outside his country
 knew who he was in January 1988, when the crisis involving the Novotny
 leadership exploded, and he was called to fill the party's highest
 post.  We know, instead, that in that situation, which was difficult
 because of,its long deterioration, his task was anything but simple.
 It has been said that in that delicate situation, when work
 was directed at steering Czechoslovakia out of its profound crisis,
 leader Dubcek showed himself to be hesitant.  It should be added
 immediately, however, that this criticism has come from 2 opposite
 directions.  It was launched by those who wanted Czechoslovakia in
 the summer of 1968 to oppose with other forms of resistance, including
 extreme ones, the incursion by the troops of the 5 Warsaw Pact

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 countries.  As to the other direction, it was launched by those who,
 instead, reproached Dubcek for not having intervened with repressive
 measures not only against the resurfacing of rightist forces that
 tried to profit from the crisis but also against the expressions of
 dissent that were manifested among the very ranks of the supporters
 of. socialism.
 In reality, Dubcek and all those who shared leadership respon-
 sibility in that period did neither consciously.  They were aware,
 as documents show, of the dangers and traps that lay along their
 road.   But, just as we are able to take into account events by
 observing them directly, so they did not see this as reason to-
 reject the concurrent posing of 2 objectives.  The first was that
 of convincing the country that it would finally be governed in a
 way differing from the past:  they proposed the consistent develop-
 ment of socialist democracy.                     The second was that of maintaining
 Czechoslovakia, with its own autonomous aspect, within the alignment
 of socialist states in line with the determination of history and
 in complete fidelity to assumed commitments.
 It was not easy, we know, to operate in the circumstances
 of the 2 objectives.  Yet a tenacious attempt was made to reject
 neither one nor the other.  However contrary we are to idealizing
 the single personality, we do not think -- and we believe that;
 Dubcek himself did not think -- that the Dubcek leadership was able
 to handle every crisis.  There might have been weaknesses and errors.
 But nothing permitted one to forecast that the situation had been
 compromised.  Under Dubcek's leadership the Czechoslovak Party
 enjoyed in the country broad popular support, which was the only
 factor guaranteeing the attainment of those dual objectives.  What-
 ever one may think about the Dubcek leadership, he must demonstrate
 that those objectives, both essential, could have been attained and
 are attainable through methods differing from those laboriously
 tried when Dubcek headed the "new course."
 :
 There is ample evidence of a great consensus behind the party
 leadership, a consensus that wound up polarizing around several.
 names, the first of which was precisely Dubcekfe.  This vast popular
 movement represented a precious patrimony.  It would be damaging to
 conceal the fact that the popularity and prestige of the man remain
 very high in Czechoslovakia.  Perhaps even beyond his own desideratum
 and inclinations, Dubcek had become a Symbol.  With the measure of
 expulsion, a blow is inevitably struck at the Dubc'ek symbol,-not to
 speak of the political figure Dubcek.  _
 A year ago, when it was decided to retain Dubcek in the party
 Presidium though depriving him of his post as party leader, that
 decision appeared as a well-conceived effort to retain the political
 patrimony that had been accumulated under his leadership and to
 reassemble the various trends that had manifested themselves in the
 Czechoslovak Party, with a view to facilitating Husak's work.  But
 this direction was of short durations  To point up the contrast,
 the expulsion announced on Friday evening assumes the grave significance
 of surgery,  What is now eliminated is precisely what the laborious
 effort tried to salvage last year, ioe., the recovery of the vast
 CPYRGHT

 strength that had been manifested by the Czechoslovak people and that
 had been believed to have been expressed in the "new course" and in
 Dubcek.  We are thus far removed from even the change that was
 effected in April 1969.  For us, it is impossible to believe that
 this is the path leading to the overcoming of the Czechoslovak crisis.
 Recently the press has frequently referred to voices coming
 from Prague on the contrasts that occurred in the party Presidium
 with respect to expulsion.  There has also been talk of a contrary
 opinion on the part of the highest party and state authorities.
 We do not know how credible these voices are.  At this time there
 has been neither confirmation nor denial in Prague.  They are hence
 destined to be largely believed from the standpoint both of the
 significance of the act itself and of the manifest contrast with
 the decisions that were made slightly over a year ago and have been
 gradually modified over the past 14 months to confirm a crisis which
 cannot be said to have been overcome.
 As to the judgement of us Italian Communists, it was expressed
 immediately with great clarity by the general secretary of our party.
 It is a judgement dictated by a profound internationalist preoccupation.
 The Czechoslovak events involve us as militants of a large world move-
 ment through the international significance that these events have
 inevitably assumed.  Against this backdrop we have always expressed
 our concern.  Nor can we remain silent today.  Defining our position
 is our duty:  it means assuming our responsibility to the workers
 and people of our country.  The decisions made may be the prelude
 of even worse ones.  It would be dangerous if the negative reactions
 in Czechoslovakia and the international workers+ movement were not
 considered for what they really represent.,

 PARIS, July 18 - An of
 ai
 reer dates from a Black Sc
 mutiny o1 1919 has caused hilparty embarrassment by ope
 dissidence before several mit
 lion television viewers.
 Charles Tillon, a white-hair-
 ed 73-yaer-old militant who 2
 -years ago was a minister in a
 provisional Government run by
 Gen. Charles de Gaulle, an-
 nounced on the air last night
 that he had  been excluded
 from ibis party cell in Aix-en-
 Provence by its young leaders,
 acting on orders from above.
 Mr. Tilton delivered a strong
 attack accusing the present
 pary leadership of "Stalin-
 Jim." using of anti-democratic
 methods and failing to take a
 trong stand against the So-
 let-led repression in Czecho-
 lovakia.
 L'Humanlt&, the official par-
 newspaper consigned a short
 rticle on Mr. Tillon to the
 ottom of its fourth page to-
 ay. complaining mildly that
 e had chosen to speak on
 television rather than to .his
 wn party.
 Charge Not Denied
 The paper did not deny that
 e local cell had taken action,
 ut said no request for exclu-.
 on had reached higher bodies,
 f eluding to Cehntral Commit-
 e.
 The exclusion was believed
 have been provoked by the
 issuing of a statement last
 month by Mr. Tillon and three
 other prominent Communists
 now in disgrace.
 They were Roger Garaudy,
 the French party's best-known
 Intellectual until his exclusion
 a few months ago, Maurice
 I{riegcl-Valrimont  and  Jean
 Pronteau, both former members
 of the Central Committee.
 All had taken exception to
 the party's attitude on Czecho-
 slovakia, its purported lack of
 understanding of militant left-
 ist youth movements, and to
 centralization based on the So
 viet party that left no room for
 debate.

 felt strong pressure from within
 and without for a wholesale
 change.
 The inside pressures are typi-
 fied by the attacks of Mr. Til-

 erable standing, particularly in
 the older generation. 'In 1919,

 LE MONDE, Paris
 24 July 1970
 FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTIONS SEEN IN FRENCH CP
 by Maurice Duverger
 The internal unity of the French Communist Party is hardly
 being more weakened by the Tillon affair than y the Garaudy issue.
 The exclusion of the former chief of the FTP  expansion unknown7
 concerns broader segments of the party than the exclusion of the
 former director of the Marxist Studies Center.  The problems of the
 resistance have a greater'impact than intellectual discussions.   l3ut.
 the mass of militants are too accustomed to discipline, too persuaded'
 that discipline is necessary for the party to be effective, and too
 biased against "splinter intrigues" for them not to accept their
 leaders' decision.   Any highly structured and hierarchical organiza-
 tion reacts in the same way under similar circumstances.
 In this area, then, Georges Marchais may feel at ease.  The party,
 will not lose many supporters or many voters in this new crisis.  As
 for its effects outside the party, consequences there will probably.
 be different.  The image of French communism is now deteriorating a
 little more, as it has not ceased to do since 1968.  The climate is
 becoming still less favoiable to a reconciliation with the Social
 Democrats and to the development of an alliance of the left. The
 centrist movement, which also has the advantage of an unusually, dy-
 namic and efficient manager, is favored by the communist decline.
 And the progress made by the centrist movement is now more dangerous
 for the French CP than a possible loss of supporters or voters.
 Accusing Roger Garaudy and Charles Tillon of favoring;.. this move-
 ment is staying on the surface of the issue.  The promoters of tho
 centrist movement, of course, grasp such opportunities to feed their
 anti-communist campaigns and to divide the left a little more.   This
 is obvious ahd.completely natural.  But such maneuvers remain of
 secondary importance when compared to the essential fact which has
 favored the centrist movement for the past 2 years -- the invasion
 of Czechoslovakia by the itussiane and the crushing of a humanistic
 brand of socialism.   In this sense, Hessrs Rrezhnev and Rosygin are
 the true "objective allies" of Jean-Jacques Servnn-Schreiber.  Or to
 be more exact (for the Soviets must obviously.be more concerned with
 the USSR than with France), his true objective allies are the leaders
 of, the Communist Party who underrate the importance of the Russian
 invasion for public opinion in our country.

 Such a misinterpretation probably constitutes the fundamental
 strategic error of the French CP.  If communists as dedicated as
 Garaudy and Tillon, who accepted for such.a long time such rude humili
 ations in the name of discipline are now deciding to throw off this
 discipline, it is less to liberate their conscience than to draw at-
 tention to this error.  Waldeck Rochct appraised the situation well in
 August 1968.   The "censure" expressed at that time kept the party from
 cutting itself off from the rest of the left.  This censure was never
 disavowed.   But it is now too isolated and too weak after later develop.
 ments in the affair.  The silence maintained since that time by the
 Politburo and the central. committee has made the French CP the accom?
 p Place of Prague's neo-Stalinism in the eyes of non-communists.
 There reside both the major obstacle to the development of the
 alliance of the left and the fundamental aid "objectively" given.to?
 the centrist movement.  They can not easily be abolished, for a com-
 munist party can not rise up against the USSR, to which the fate of
 world communism remains linked. 'But in comparing the present attitudes
 ,of the French CP and the'Italian CP, one finds that the French party
 is hardly concerned with the problem, while the Italian party is activew
 ,ly involved with it.  This permits the Italian CP to maintain much
 better relations with the left, without betraying its Muscovite big
 brother.  The regrets expressed by L'Cnita about the exclusion of
 "comrade" Uubcek make the silence of L'Humanite even less justifiable.
 The official theory of the French CH' -- according to which one
 party must not get involved in the affairs of fraternal parties -- is
 doing it incalculable harm.   If in Prague they are again beginning to
 use the procedures of L'Aveu, if the Siberian deportation camps are
 being multiplied, must the other Communist parties be silent just as
 they were in the 1950's?  Such a silence would appear to be complici-
 ,ty, just as today silence about Czechoslovakia appears to be compli-
 city.  Nothing is more opposed to the idea of the solidarity of fra-
 ternal parties, to the notion of proletarian internationalism, than
 not criticizing one's brother when he deserves it, than not passing
 Judgment on one of the. members of the Internationale when his behavior
 is harmful to the others.   The large western communist parties -- the
 Italian and French parties -- do hold some possibilities of influ-
 encing the Soviet Union and the popular democracies.   By refusing to
 use this influence, the French CP is favoring the present evolution
 of neo-Stalinism, which hurts all the communist parties, eApecially
 the French party.
 Silence concerning Prague and Movcow is only one a::pect of the
 problem, however, and not the motet important one.   The most serious
 matter is not that the 'French C1' remains silent when confronted with
 the present hard line of the USSR and'of Czechoslovakia, but that it
 is itself acting as people acted in 114oscow in the time of Stalin and
 in Prague at, the time of the London trial.   Public opinion has the
 impression that the French party is not using its full force against
 Garaudy or Tillon only because its distance from power prevents it
 from doing so.  It hardly matters whether this impression is true or
 false.  The-essential is that it may be resented, and it is.

 Of course, it has almost always been like this.   Even in the
 60's, when liberalization was beginning to develop, the French CP did
 not go very faro   But then it was part of a general evolution leading
 to the de-Stalihization of the communist world.  The rigidity of the
 French Cl' could then be considered a holdover from its former con-
 dition that the new situation's development would cause to disappear
 little by little.  The French party did not change very much.   Still
 it did change a little under the guidance of Waldeck fochet.   Above
 all, it was part of a whole in movement.  Today, it can no longer be
 hoped that it will in the end be carried away in the surrounding thaw,
 for the present atmosphere is opposed to this, and a worldwide harder
 line is developing.  The hard stance of the French CP -- which is in-
 creasing -- thus takes on another meaning.
 Also, French public opinion is less.tolerant of a contradiction
 between words and deeds.   A great cleansing has been going on since
 May 1968, and the French Communist Party itself is also undergoing its
 consequences.   In the last few years it has made uncontestable efforts
 in the doctrinal sphere to define an "advanced democracy," to find a
 French path to socialism, to reject the thesis of a single party, and
 to assert its attachment to pluralism.  These efforts can hardly be
 effective since they are not accompanied by a similar change in be-
 havior.  The freedom given to Garaudy to express himself before the
 congress remained too isolated a swallow to lead to a belief in
 spring, while on the contrary so many signs are confirming winter's
 aye turn.
 The primary force in the centrist movement -- enemy number one
 of the French CP -- is linked .,o the fact that the alliance of the
 left appears much less "plausible" today than it did in 1966-1967,
 the era when public opinion surveys revealed that it was acceptable
 to many citizens, even moderates, even concerning the participation
 of communist ministers in the government.  This is related in part
 to the weakening of the Social Democrats, which prevents them from
 bringing a counterbalance to bear on their partner.   But it is due
 even more to the evolution of communism in general and to the evolu-
 tion of French communism in. particular.  For the French CA' to con-
 tinue in its prevent path means increasing the risk of finding itself,
 once again isolated for a long period, thus turning its back to its
 basic goal -- preventing its enforced return to the ghetto and the
 developing of a union of the left.-.,This fundamental contradiction
 between the goals of the party and the strategy that it is-applying
 to reach its goals i.n the end carries a greater weight than the at-
 titude of any one of its leaders during and after the occupation. -yt
 will'not be overcome so *&silyo

 frentc a In actitud de nuestro gobieruo, In niovilizaciott de tropas brasilcnas en la Cromer. v 1?S In fin de 1955, les Sovietiques avalent
 fait a Nasser des offres de service pour'
 fournir l'Egypte d'armes. La premiere guerre
 d'Isracl. moins d'un an plus tard, Ieur a per-'
 mis d'accroitre considdrablement l'influence
 qu'ils commcncaicnt a prendre en Egypte sur
 lc plan militaire, d'autant plus quits pou-
 vaicnt  arguer  que  c'dtait  la  menace  de
 Khrouchtchev de se scrvir de la bombe ato-
 mique qui avait arr@tE 1'avance des armees
 iisradliennes. La seconde guerre fut catastro-
 phiquc pour I'Egypte.
 Dans ces deux rencontres, les armdes ara.
 bes, a commencer par l'armde dgyptienne, per.
 dirent la quasi-totalitd de lours materiels. Sans
 sourciller, les Sovietiques les remplacerent. A
 l'origine, 1'essentiel de ces materiels dtait d'ori-
 gines europeenncs. Apres ces deux campagnes,
 ces armdcs nc disposent plus que de matd-
 rigIs de provenance sovidtique, ce qui, daps
 uric certaine mesure, facilite ('instruction et,
 plus encore, 1'ingerence sovidtique.
 Apres la premiere campagne, cette ingd-
 rence fut rclativcment discrete et faible. It
 n'y cut pas de commandcment sovidtique ins-
 talls a demcurc en Egypte, mais sculement des
 . conseillers . qui diffuserent des instructions
 et elaborerent un plan d'opdrations qui se
 rt vela pcu brillant et plut6t timord. Peutktre
 lesdits a conscillers . I'avaicnt-ils connu en
 fonction du personnel militaire dgyptien, Bien
 pcu prdpard a sescrvir des materiels de guerre
 complexes.
 La scconde guerre - assez humiliante
 pour les Sovietiques, pulsqu'on dit que cer-
 tains de leurs conscillers furent entratnds daps
 la ddbandade -- entraina une aggravation de
 I'ingdrence sovidtique, On respecte la fiction
 d'un commandenient autochtone, mais cha-
 que commandement dgyptien est double d'unc
 dquipe d'officicrs sovietiques. La preuve dtant
 faite que les forces egyptiennes, cmpctrdes
 dans le materiel moderne, ne peuvent se di-
 riger elles-memos, a moins d'aller volontaire-
 ment a un troisiepne ddsastre, on en arrive
 pcu a peu a unc commande directe, du moins
 dans les pontes lei plus importants.
 LES FORCES ASSISTEES
 II ne parait pas que les forces dgypticn-
 nes et cellos des autres nays arabes aicnt
 connu tine amplification de\.lcurs effectifs
 11 serait d'ailleurs'difficile de lever davantage
 de troupes et de les instruirc. Au demeurant,
 c'est surtout et toujours d'armemcnts, et des
 plus modernes, dont on a besoin pour abattre
 Israel, car les Arabcs, qui pourraicnt ddploycr
 toutes Icurs qualitds dans unc guerre do par.
 tisans, sont obliges de sc preparcr pour des.
 operations d'un style tout different et qui
 leur convient beaucoup moins.
 II semble done que Ics forces arabcs aicnt
 dtd reconstitudes a pcu pros tcllcs qu'cllcs
 dtalent, quant au nombrc, avant )a gucrrc dcs
 six jours, environ 100.000 hommes pour cc

 leurs moyens ont etC considcrablement accriis.

 N ric 400 (dont 250 T54), l'Irak, (?;.  e,'
 0 T 54). Cola fait environ 1.700 chars. Isr:
 en possedc sculcment In moltid, malgrd toutes
 les prises de guerre que son armdc a pu faire,
 mais les formations blinddes isradliennes sont
 entrainees et commanddes d'une manitre au-
 trement efficace.
 Dc plus, l'Egypte a etc amplement dotde
 en artillcric pour contrcbattre les installations
 isradliennes sur la rive occidentale du Canal
 de Suez. L'Egyptc aurait place Ic long du
 canal environ un millier de bouches a feu des
 modcles  a  longue  portdc  sovidtiques  de
 122 mm. et 130 mm. Les tirs ont commence
 en janvicr 1970; its ont inflige des pertes aux
 Isracliens, unc trentaine d'hommes par mois,
 rdduites au tiers apres les attaques de re-
 presailles des Isracliens. Ceux-ci 3n'auraient pas
 du tout la m@me puissance en artillerie sur le
 canal.
 On manque d'informations sur In valeur
 offensive quc pourraicnt avoir les grandes
 unites terrestres de i'Egypte, si, un jour ou
 l'autrc, cues tentaient de franchir le canal et
 de pdnetrcr a nouveau dans la region du Si.

 tdgec des fusses tactiques, a charge classiquc,
 dune portde dc 65 km., ce qui ddnoterait deja
 unc intention, ou du moins une possibilitd,
 offensive. Enfin, d'une manierc generale, on
 estime quc les forces dgypticnnes de terre,
 ainsi quc les autres forces, sont une fois et
 demi cc qu'cllcs etaient avant la guerre. Tout
 semble indiqucr que ce potentiel sera encore
 augmentd ; et ii 1'est ddja de fait par les nou.

 thddtre en haute tension. Scion unc opinion

 LES FORCES AERIENNES

 gins air-air autoguidds It l'infrarouge. Les
 . ayons d'action sont sensiblement plus dlevds,
 done de capacitd offensive.
 Numdriquement, Israel se trouve de memo
 a. la moitid des forces adriennes, do ses adver-
 snlres. Ndnnrroins co pays a engag6 d6s las
 premiers mois de 1970 des attaqucs en pro-
 fondeur au-dela du canal. Certains avions se-
 raient passes impundment au-dessus des de-
 fenses. Des destructions ont etd operdes It Pin-
 tdrieur du delta : camps militaires, rampes
 de lancement de fusdes de defense des vv lies
 et ddp6ts divers. En outre, plusicurs   g gyp-
 l.iens auraient dte abattus.
 Cependant, en matiere d'aviation, le fait
 capital est la Vrdsenoe de forces sovidtiqucs
 (on a pane dung division adrienne) et de
 pilotes egalernent sovietiques, une cinquan-
 taine sans doute, peut-titre meme une centaine.
 Leur nationalitd ne fait pas de doute, les Is-
 radliens ayant captd des messages emis par
 eux en langue russe au cours de lours vols.
 Qu'ils I'aient voulu ou non. les Sovidtiques se
 sont trouvds pris dans une sorte  engrcn   .
 tit
 re
 Ayant fourni des apparcils qui no peuvent
 pjlotes par des Egyptiens, ils ont dtd obliges
 aussi de fournir des pilotes.
 Il sembic qu'un accord tacite soit inter-
 venu entre les belligdrants pour que les appa-
 reils pilotes par les Sovietiqucs ne soient pas
 engages contre les forces aeriennes d'Israel,
 celles-ci rcnonccaant do Icur c6td It certaines
 operations do bombardement en Egypte pour
 ne pas risquer de se heurtcr aux avions so-
 vittiques.
 C'est dans le meme esprit sans doute que.
 les principales responsabilitds en matidre ad-
 rienne sont entre les mains des Sovidtiques, i
 qui laissent 6. l'aviation egyptienne les t5ches
 de caractere offensif, pour le moment les
 moms importantes.
 Ainsi, l'aviation pilotCc par les Sovidtiques
 fait figure pour le moment d'unc sorte d'dcran
 protecteur de I'Egypte. L'ensemble de la de-
 fense anti-adrienne aurait dte dgalement prisc
 entierement en main par les Sovidtiques : de
 nombreux  spdcialistes  seraient  arrives  en
 Egypte A cet effet.
 Ndanmoins, la presence d'cscadrilles so-
 vidtiques, prdvues pour I'attaque au sol en
 basse altitude (lei appareils dtant dotes d'en-
 gins air-sot) pout titre d'un poids considerable
 dans une guerre future. Et ces apparcils ant
 incontestablement une vocation offensive.
 Signalons encore la crdat:ion de plusicurs
 bases adriennes entierement sovidtiques.
 On dit que des diffdrends seraient surve-
 nus entre les Egyptiens et les Sovidtiques sur
 l'utilisation de l'arme adrienne, les premiers
 so montrant presses de partir A l'attaque, les
 autres prechant la moderation, en vue notam-
 ment d une preparation longue et mdthodique.
 Les Sovidtiques out dgalement installd soit

 quarante bases de lancement de fusdes Sam 3,
 qui demeurcnt dgalement enttre lours mains ;
 ils ont, en outrc, amend environ 15.000 spdcia-
 listes. Les livraisons auraient did de 1.500 fu-

 . contre l'aviation attaquant A basso altitude.
 On a e clement signald la presence d'engins
 Sam 2, de memo emploi, mais contre I'avlation
 en haute altitude.
 LES FORCES NAVALES

 CBS TELEVISION NETWORK
 Tuesday, July 28, 1970
 10:00 - 11:00 PM,  EDT
 With CBS NEWS 'Correspondents Harry Reasoner and William Cole
 PRODUCED BY CBS NEWS
 EXECUTIVE PRODUCER:  Perry Wolff
 REASONER:  Good evening.  You are about to see some extraordinary films.  They
 are interviews with three Russians, filmed in Russia, about their dissatisfaction
 and dissent, and there is also a moving voice message, recorded in a prison camp
 and smuggled out.
 Some few Westerners living in Russia occasionally get to know a Russian well
 enough to hear criticism of the government.  Some few Russians, having escaped
 to the West, have talked about what'they feel is the early decadence and vicious
 repression of their government.  Some few Russians, including one man we will
 hear from, have had critical books published abroad.
 But the men you are about to see talked for the camera in Russia, and they are
 still there.  They are most exquisitely aware that their government knows of
 these interviews, and that officials of the Soviet Government in the United States
 have television sets.  They are aware that in the crowded 53 years of Soviet his-
 tory, terrible things have happened to Russians for less than these men do to-
 night.  But they want these films to be broadcast, because they feel this will
 focus attention on what they believe is increasing repression of themselves and
 other dissenters.
 These films were made by CBS NEWS Correspondent William Cole who, a short time
 later, was expelled from Russia, perhaps coincidentally.  Bill Cole is a reporter,
 not a photographer.  On the technical quality of the films, the kindest thing we
 can say is that he really did very well.  The key thing was his relationship with
 the men.  We will hear from these men, and Bill Cole, in a moment.
 ANNOUNCER:  This is a CBS NEWS Special Report:  Voices From the Russian Underground,
 with CBS NEWS Correspondents William Cole and Harry Reasoner.
 (ANNOUNCEMENT)
 REASONER:   This .1s Bill Cole who, until very recently, was Chief of Bureau and
 Correspondents for CBS NEWS in Moscow, and filmed the interviews we're going to
 see tonight.  Bill, why tlid you get kicked out of the Soviet Union?
 COLE:  Harry~p I was told that my activities there were incompatible with-my states
 .as a journalist.  Actually, the authorities gave me no explanation, and I didn't
 expect one.

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 REASONER: It could have something to do with these interviews?
 COLE:      I think it did.
 ]REASONER:  How did you get these films?
 COLE:      I got to know the Russians in these films, and they wanted these films
 made, to let the outside world kr;:w what's happening in the.t country.
 REASONER:  Who are they?  What-is it?  Is it a large group of revolutionaries?
 COLE:    Not at all.  They're not revolutionaries at all.  They're good - they're'
 good Russians, but they want change.  They are members of what you - what they
 call the democratic movement, a movement fighting for basic human rights, civil
 liberties in the Soviet Union.
 REASONER:  How do they keep in touch with each other in a state like Russia?
 COLE:   They have an underground press, which they call Samizdat.  They have a
 newspaper, for example, called the Chronicles.  I've got an example of it here.
 It's not a newspaper, actually, it's - it's a typed letter, and it circulates in
 the thousands.  One man gets a copy of it, and he types four more copies and
 gives them to his friends.  Of course it's illegal, and it's dangerous to be
 caught with it.
 REASONER:  For these men this will be the biggest samizdat they've ever had, then?
 COLE:  It will, and that's what they want it to be.
 REASONER:  Who are we going to see and hear?
 COLE:  Well, the first man you'll see is Pyotr Yakir.  He's 48 years old and a,
 dedicated Communist.  He wants change from within.  He has spent 13 years in con-
 centration camps, and he is what you might call the non-titular head of the demo-
 cratic movement.  He was put into a camp the first time when he was 14, because
 he was his father's son.  His father was General Jan Yakir, a very celebrated
 general of the Soviet Army.  Stalin decided that Yakir should be shot.  He was
 taken out of bed one night and shot,..
 REASONER:  Yakir begins by speaking of a famous recent trial.
 COLE:  Yes, Pyotr believes that a change came in Russian opinion in 1966, with
 the illegal trials of two well-known Russian writers, Sinyavsky and Daniel..
 REASONER:  He also, of course, speaks in Russian, but as we listen to him, and
 in these other interviews, the translation will be by David Floyd, of the London
 Telegraph, an ecpert on Soviet affairs.  Let's listen to Mr. Yakir.
 YAKIR:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD:  (INTERPRETING):  The most important turning point in the way people are
 thinking was when Daniel and Sinyavsky were arrested.  Many educated people thought
 Daniel and Sinyavsky had done wrong by sending their writings abroad, and follclw-
 ing their trial and after Samizdat - Samizdat refers to the system by which people
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 simply reproduce and pass from hand to hand various writings - published the first
 speeches of Daniel and Sinyavsky, there came about a striking change, because both.
 Sinyavsky and Daniel spoke about what they thought.  They had written down what
 they believed, and didn't consider themselves guilty.  And many people began to
 think:  really, why should poeple be tried for their convictions?  Why, simply for
 what he thinks, does a man have to be arrested?  It was very similar to Stalin
 times, when people were sent to prison not even for what they thought, but for
 ??   what they were thought to believe, and had not said to anybody, but it had some-
 how been proved that they were dissenters.  So from that time on there were pro-
 tests.
 And then there was the trial of Galanskov and Ginzburg, and that was the time of
 the greatest enthusiasm, because firstly a great many people protested against the
 fact that the trial was held illegally and behind closed doors.  During the trial
 the situation changed a great deal.  Whereas during the trial of Sinyavsky and
 Daniel it had been impossible to approach foreign correspondents - the vigilantes
 would take people straight off to the police - at the Moscow City Court we all
 discussed the affair with the correspondents.  True, they wouldn't let us in any-
 where, but a certain contact was established, and everything we learned we passed
 on immediately to the correspondents.  The trial ended, and against-it there were
 a great many protests.  More than 2,000 people put their names to various letters
 of protest against conviction of people for their beliefs.  Sometime - about the
 same time, during the trial, Larissa Daniel and Pavel Litvinov handed correspond-
 ents a protest against the trial and. appealing to world public opinion.  That was
 the first, major step, which was a breach with all previous traditions. Never be-
 fore in Russia had there been a case of people appealing to the West with a pro-
 test against unlawfulness in our country.
 This is a great stride forward compared with Stalinism.  Under Stalin there was
 always an iron curtain, and no one knew what' was going on here.  Millions of
 people were destroyed and nobody knew about it.  Now we're trying to publicize
 every,arrest, every dismissal.  This we consider our main function - that is, in-
 forming people about what is going on and of those illegal acts.                       We consider
 this the main task of the day.
 Here is what I think.  We are all being arrested - those who took part in the
 democratic movement - but that's not the point.  We are apparently being arrested
 because it doesn't suit the authorities to have people about who criticize them.
 But there's no going back.  If we're not here there'll be others; there are al-
 ready many of us, many young people, and no independent thinking people in the
 Soviet Union will go back to what used to be.  They'll beat us and they'll kill
 us.  All the same people will go on thinking differently.
 REASONER:  Pyotr Yakir, one of three Russian dissenters, interviewed by Corres-
 pondent Bill Cole.  Bill, Yakir said "they will beat us and they will kill us."
 Has anything happened to these men?
 COLE:  Yes, Harry. The man you are about to see next was picked up by the KGB,
 the secret police, only a few weekd ago.  He's now in prison awaiting trial.
 His name is Andre Amalrik.  He's a 31-year-old historian and writer, who's been
 published all over the world, never in his own country, and he's just published
 an amazing book, called "Will the Soviet Union Survive until 198J?"  This is an
 amazing book because it was written in Russia.  Other writers -other Russian

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 writers have written such books criticizing the system and telling exactly --
 telling about it as. it is, but mostly from abroad, in safe places, and Andre
 has been awaiting arrest, and - and now it's happened.
 REASONER : You had some trouble getting part of the film of this interview out
 of Russia, didn't you?
 COLE:  Yes, I had a great deal.  I had Andre an film, and I tried to take it out
 not long ago and I was searched very thoroughly in customs.  The film was seized
 and developed.  I've heard in Moscow that it's going to be used at his trial.
 REASONER:  Will we hear about that trial?
 COLE:  I'm beginning to wonder.  The secret police have a new trick now.  They
 don't have trials in Moscow.  Andre was not taken back to Moscow, where he lives,
 but he was taken down to a provincial city, Sverdlovsk, and we may never bear
 what happens to him.
 REASONER:  Now, the fact that you had to re-shoot this interview will account for
 the change of scene that we'll notice, and also there's a lady in the film.
 COLE:  That's his wife,' Giselle.  She's a charming girl,-and a painter.  She's
 never been allowed to exhibit in her own country, because her art is not - doesn't
 fit the party line.
 REASONER:  Let's look at Mr. and Mrs. Amalrik.
 COLE:  Mr. Amalrik, why did you decide to write this book called "Will the Soviet
 Union Survive Until 1984?"
 AMALRIK:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD: (INTERPRETING).-'  I think there were three main reasons why I decided
 to write that book and to try and - try and get it published.  The,first was
 my concern for the fate of my country.  It was, alas, some years ago that
 I started to be concerned at the fact that my country was heading for a
 catastrophe in the not too distant future, and I wrote about it on two
 occasions to the editors of Russian newspapers in Moscow, but I received
 the most unconvincing replies, and then I decided to find another way
 of gaining publicity for my views.  In the second place, since, as I under-
 stand it, my book would appear abroad mainly, and would be distributed
 principally there, I set myself the objective of refuting those current
 and inaccurate ideas about my country which are widespread, mainly in the
 United States, that is, about the liberalization of the Soviet regime
 which is allegedly taking place.   And thirdly, I had the same reason as
 any author has who writes a book:  given that these ideas had come into
 my head, it was natural that I should want to write about them.
 What is really happening in the Soviet regime, in my opinion, is not that it
 is getting more liberal but getting more senile.  Liberalization would pre-
 suppose conscious reform, whereas in reality the regime is more and more
 losing control over the situation in the country.  From the point of view
 of the Americans the Soviet regime exercises far greater control over its
 country than, say, the American country does over its.  But for a totali-
 e ease 19  109/02 :  IA-                                      9-0 194. 00040005 0~01~7

 tarian regime the degree of control is already insufficient.  Well, as an
 example I can cite the unusual popularity of Samizdat.  That's the distribu-
 tion in typewritten form of uncensored writings.  This doesn't happen be-
 cause the regime takes a liberal view of such things or deliberately permits
 it, but simply because the regime can't do anything about this problem,
 mainly  because there's been an extraordinary increase in the number of people
 with education, and in the importance of the role played by educated people
 in - in modern society, and this intelligentsia can no longer and will no
 longer be satisfied with the miserable official writings which are offered.
 COLE:   What do ordinary people think of this regime?
 AMALRIK:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD:  (INTERPRETING):  I have had 'a lot to do with factory workers and farm
 workers, and it seems to me that they haven't really begun to think over the
 nature of this system at all - it seems to them it's always been like this and
 it always will be.  But at the same time there's evidence of very deep dissatis-
 faction with particular aspects of the regime, and, well, this can assume the
 most varied forms.  Some are dissatisfied because they. receive extremely little
 money by comparison with others, so they don't have enough to live on.  Others
 are dissatisfied because they can't buy anything for the relatively high wages
 they earn.  The farm workers are dissatisfied with their lack of civil rights,
 in that they cannot leave the villages.  The factory workers are dissatisfied
 with their complete dependence on the factory managements.  People living in
 small towns are dissatidfied because they can't - they don't have the right to
 move to bigger towns when there's no work in the small ones.  And gradually some
 people, at all events, begin to have the idea that all of these local, smaller
 problems have their origins in the  imperfections of the political system under
 which we live.
 What may lead to a revolution is the utter lack of good sense in the upper class
 which is trying to avoid any change and'to prevent society from having any mo-
 bility, which is always!x1civing to preserve and make permanent the breakup of
 our society into tightly closed castes.
 COLE:  Mr. Amalrik, the United States is vilified every day in the Soviet press,
 on Soviet television, and on radio here.  America  is pictured to Russians as a
 land where everyone's starving, where there's no freedom, and as the enemy.
 Why is this?
 AMALRIK:  (Speak in Russian)
 FLOYD:  (INTERPRETING):  If the regime is to make itself look attractive in the
 eyes of its own people, it must constantly depict in the most repulsive light
 all other countries, especially the economically advanced ones.  And it has to .
 be said that.for a considerable time now, this - this approach, this method,
 has been effective.  For example, I have had occasion to hear Russian farm
 workers saying' something like'this:  "Oh, well, life's very bad for us, but we
 are at least able to eat potatoes every day, and sometimes they bring us some
 kerosine.  But how on earth do people live in the capitalist countries?  There's
 probably nothing at all to eat, there."

 COLE: What did the average Russian think when Americans landed on the moon?
 AMALRIK: (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD:  (INTERPRETING):  I think people reacted in different ways, various ways.
 Some rejoiced at it, as a great victory, not just for the Americans but for the
 whole of mankind.  Others took it rather badly, because for ten years the Soviet
 people had had it drummed into them that the first man to set foot on the moon
 would be a Soviet man and that this would be final, complete proof of the super-
 iority of the socialist system.
 COLE:  Is it true that opponents of the regime here are put into mental hospitals
 to get'rid of them?
 AMALRIK:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD:  (INTERPRETING):  Yes,-it's true.  I think it's the most disgusting thing
 that this regime does.  At the same time, it seems to me this is a clear indica-
 tion of the complete ideological capitulation of the regime in the face of its
 opponents, if the regime can't find anything else to do with them but to declare
 them to be out of their minds.  I am very well acquainted with a number of people
 who have been put into psychiatric hospitals and certified as being not respons-
 ible for their actions.  There's General Grigorenko, then there's Ivan Yakhimo-
 vich.  The same fate now threatens Natalia Gorbanyevskaya.  And I want to say
 that these are perfectly normal, clear-thinking people, and they have been meted
 out a terrible fate.  They have to live there among genuinely deranged people,
 and moreover for an utterly undefined period, since the period of detention in
 a psychiatric hospital is not laid down in the sentence of the court.           -
 But I consider that no system of rule by force can exist without-people who are
 ready to submit to that rule.  And if we don't want the rule of force to,prevail.,.
 we must all fight against it, and not just say the regime is bad, that we have
 to suffer, and so forth.  It - it is a bad system, but that doesn't absolve us
 of blame for it's being bad.
 COLE:  You seem rather dissatisfied.  Would you like to leave the Soviet Union?
 AMALRIK:  (81peaks in Russian)
 FLOYD (INTERPRETING):  I'm dissatisfied with this political system, but this is'
 the country in which I was born, and I hope that in due course everything will
 change.  No, I don't want to leave this country.  It's another question . whether.
 if I'd been able to make a choice before my birth, then I would have preferred
 to be born in another country.
 (ANNOUNCEMENT)
 REASONER:  Andre Amalrik, the author, the second of the three Russians'that we're
 watching tonight, spoke of the use of mental hospitals as a kind of a prison for
 dissenters.  We've heard about that in this country.  Is it fairly common?
 COLE:  It's widespread in the Soviet Union, and actually, the man you're about
 to see is a man who, knows insane asylums very well.  He's a young dissident,
 27 years old.   He spent six of those 27 years in insane asylums, ;prisons, con-
 centration camps.  His name.is Vladimir Bukovsky.
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 REASONER:  What was his offense?
 COLE:  Well, his crimes were poetry readings - the first time he was sent to an
 insane asylum was because he was found to possess a book, an anti-Communist book
 written by a well-known Communist of the time, a book called "The New Class" by
 the Yugoslav, Milovan Djilas.
 REASONER:  He went to prison for that?
 REASONER:  You interviewed him outdoors.  Why, Bill?
 COLE:  Well, by that time the secret police knew that I was filming, and I was
 under close surveillance, as Bukovsky is right now, as he's been for - ever
 since last January, when he got out of his last stretch of prison.  So we found
 a secluded wood outside Moscow, screened in by - brush, and we filmed there.
 REASONER:  Let's go to the Moscow woods and Mr. Bukovsky.
 COLE:  What is life like for a dissident like yourself inside an insane asylum?
 BUIKOVSKY: (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD (INTERPRETING):  Imagine to yourself a prison - an old prison, which was
 a prison even before the Revolution - in which there are something like a thousand
 prisoners, more than half of them murderers, people who've committed serious
 crimes at a time when they were out of their minds, people who are genuinely sick,
 and the remainder who are political prisoners, dissidents, for whom no article -
 could be found in the criminal code, whom they could find no other way of treat-
 ing but in such a place.
 The fact is that the inmates, the patients in that hospital, the prisoners, are
 people who have done such things which from the point of view of the authorities
 are crimes, but which are not criminal from the point of view of the law.  And
 in order in some way to isolate them, to punish them in some way, such people are
 declared to be insane and are detained as patients In these mental prison hospi-
 tals.  Some time passed before I understood this and before I got to know my fel-
 low prisoners.  I believe this is the usual fate for a person who wishes to be
 himself, who wants to say what he thinks, to.act in accordance with his convic-
 tions and his ideas.  Events of recent years confirm my supposition.  Many people,
 tens, hundreds of people, have been declared insane and committed to various hos-
 pitals, mainly special ones, like those in Kazan, Leningrad, Chernikovsk,
 Sec:hyovka, and so forth.
 Its very much more difficult to get out of that place than it is to get into it.
 Firstly, in order.-to get out you must declare openly and officially to the doc-
 tors that you admit that you are sick - "Yes, I was - I'm ill.  I didn't know
 what I was doing."  And the second condition is to admit you were wrong, to dis-
 .avow what you did.                  I know of several cases of people who refused to say that
 they had done wrong and spent many long years in the hospital.
 Nikolai Samsonov, for example, a geophysicist from Leningrad, who was kept there
 simply because he refused to admit he was a sick man.  Another of my friends in
 the madhouse was, for example, a French Communist of Rumanian origin who had

 learn, to see what Communism was like in practice.  He went to work in. a foot-
 wear factory in Moldavia, and worked there for a long time.  But he was dis-
 pleased that the workers there received such low wages.  He told his workmates
 that they ought to fight for better pay.  They went on strike.  He was arrested
 and declared insane.  In the hospital he just couldn't understand what had
 happened to him, how Communists could do such things.  For him, Communism and
 the struggle for a better life were more or less the same thing.  He just
 couldn't understand, and towards the end of his stay he really began to go out
 of his mind, it seems to me, because he was telling everybody that the Soviet
 government was under the'influence of the Vatican.
 I had a lot of friends there and their fate, all of their cases, were proof for
 me that the people who landed up in that hospital were those who had done things
 for which they couldn't be brought to court, who had committed no offense, and
 the hospital was simply a means of getting rid of them, of putting them out of
 sight.  The hospital regime was similar to any prison regime.  An hour's exer-
 cise a day, locked cells, outside visitors once a month, one letter a month to
 relatives, one parcel a month, exactly the same as in a prison.  The doctors
 themselves realized that it was not a hospital but a prison, and sometimes they
 said so openly.  If a patient misbehaved, he could be punished.
 COLE:  How are dissidents treated in an insane asylum?
 BUKOVSKY:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD (INTERPRETING):  It was very easy to get into trouble in that hospital,
 and the punishments were very severe.  There are three kinds of.punishment which
 are most commonly applied there.  The first type is carried out by medical means.
 I think people know about a preparation known as Sulfazine, which is used if one
 of the patients, one of the prisoners in the hospital committed some offense,
 gave a doctor a rude answer to some question or declared that a doctor in the
 hospital was no better than an executioner in a white smock.  Such a remark
 would be sufficient to involve punishment.  Sulfazine is a pretty painful form
 of punishment.  It causes your temperature to rise to about 40 degrees Centi-
 grade, you feel you have a fever, can't get out of bed or move about, and it
 goes on for a day or two.  If the treatment is repeated, then the effects can
 last a whole week or - or even ten days.
 A second form of punishment involves the use of the preparation Aminozine, used
 in psychotherapy, also known, probably, in other countries.  It causes the pa-
 tient to feel drowsy, sleepy.  He may sleep several days on end, and if the
 treatment is given regularly he may go on sleeping for as long as it is continued.
 The third form of punishment we used to call - to call the "roll-up".  It in-
 volves the use of wet canvas, long - long pieces of it, in which the patient is
 rolled up from head to`foot so tightly that it was difficult for him to breathe,
 and as the canvas began to dry out it would get tighter and tighter and make the
 patient feel even worse.  But that punishment was applied with some caution.
 There were medical men present while it was taking place who made sure that the
 patient did not lose consciousness, and if his pulse began to weaken then the
 canvas would be released.
 Altogether, the medical forms of punishment were pretty widely used, and it
 was sufficient for a patient to appear cheerful or, on the contrary, miserable,
 show dissatisfaction or too calm - any deviation which might appear suspicious
 to the psychiatrists - to give them grounds for believing that he was ill -
 that would be sufficient for them to start using those treatments.

 COLE:  Well, what is life like for you here now?  Are you harassed by the secret
 police?
 BUKOVSKY:   (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD (INTERPRETING):  I was released from the camp in January 1970, but I did
 not change my opinions, and I did not give up my activity.  I continue to do what
 I was doing before, and therefore it's possible that I shall be arrested any day.
 I can be arrested at any moment, when I meet foreign correspondents, when I am
 distributing written material forbidden in the Soviet Union, and in other circum-
 stances.  It doesn't matter what excuse the authorities find for arresting ma.
 The reason is unimportant for them.  There's a saying in the camps so long as
 they've got the man, they'll always find the law to fix him.  Of course, I know
 I am being followed, my telephone is always tapped.  I feel that I am constantly
 under observation by the authorities.  When I have to do something that I don't
 -want the authorities to know about I manage to get away from them.  But it's
 pretty difficult in general.  I am unable to get the sort of work I like doing,
 if only because I an sufficiently well known, or because in my identity card
 there is a mark which tells anyone that I've been in prison.
 I an atten &clsLea about the prosp,~cta for change In this country , 'what wee hope
 to get from ,our activity, how many supporters we have and these are understandable,
 legitimate questions.  But they are very difficult to answer.  You have to under-
 stand first of all what's the essence of our struggle.  The essence of it is, in
 my view, the struggle against fear, the fear which has gripped the people since
 the time of Stalin, which has still not left people, and thanks to which this
 system continues to exist, the system of dictatorship, of pressure, of oppression.
 It's into the struggle against fear that we put our greatest efforts, and in that
 struggle great importance attaches to persopal example, the example which we give
 people.  I personally did what I considered right, spoke out on those occasions
 when I wanted to, and I'm alive, I am now sitting here and not in prison.  I'm
 alive, I can get about,' I can live.  For me and for many people that's very im-
 portant - it shows that it's possiblb to fight, and that it is necessary to fight.
 REASONER:  Bill, we've seen three Russians who willingly put themselves into
 hazard to make these films.  What's apt to happen to them?
 COLE:  Harry, I think these three men are in serious trouble.  The Soviet state
 simply does not permit criticism.  Of course, the authorities might wait six
 months, maybe a year; they'll wait until the furor dies down, and these men will
 be picked up.  They'll go back to the mental hospitals or to the concentration.
 camps where they were before.
 REASONER:  They knew that was going to - it was a possibility, when they agreed
 to and urged the interviews?
 COLE:  Actually, a couple of times I said, look, let's - let's throw this film
 away.  They said, no, regardless of the consequences, we want it shown.
 REASONER: Bill., you brought out a message from a man who went through something
 like this, didn't you?
 COLE:  Yes, Harry.  When I was expelled from Moscow I brought out on my person
 e. small tape that came, from the labor camps in the far north. It was a tape made
 by a very celebrated Russian writer, Alexander Ginzburg, who was imprisoned in

 1967 for protesting other trials of other writers.  And you asked me what these
 three Russians you saw tonight can expect.  I think that this message tells what
 they can expect.
 REASONER:  How did you know this was Ginzburg,on the tape?
 COLE:  I played it for friends of his in Moscow who verified, who confirmed that
 it was his voice.
 REASONER:  And the first,voice we hear is another - another prisoner, a Lithuanian?  '.
 COLE:  Yes. A Lithuanian who spoke a little bit of English, who introduced Ginsburg.
 REASONER: Let's hear some of.this message from inside.
 VOICE: This recording was made under complicated camp conditions.
 GINZBURG:  (Speaks in Russian)
 FLOYD (INTERPRETING):, In this concentration camp, for lack of. medical aid, six-
 teen political prisoners have perished recently.  Here there is only one doctor
 from amongtthe prisoners, the rights of man are violated, thousands.of people 'are
 deprived of their freedom, and everyone goes in danger of his life.
 I have just accompanied on his last journey my friend Jan Matusha.  Three months
 ago the Estonian Ans Frants died.
 For six months now have been languishing in the Vladimir prison - that living
 grave - my friends Yuri Daniel and Valeri Ronkin.  Several dozen of our friends
 were arrested in Moscow' recently.  Camps, prisons, and the death of those near
 to us - that is what we are surrounded by, and nevertheless we hope to hold out.
 We are sustained, not by the so-called decisive stand of the Soviet Union, nor
 by the good will of the governments of the great powers, but by the wrath, pro-
 test and solidarity of all honest people, of all who, hold dear the dignity of
 man, democracy and peace.  In decisive resistance to modern barbarism I see the
 only real guarantee that the rights of man will be observed, here and through-
 out the world.
 (ANNOUNCEMENT)
 REASONER:  Any of us who have seen a Chekov play know that understanding Russia
 and the Russians is hot always easy.  Here to try to help us understand better
 are two authorities on Soviet politics and literature who bring a special knowl-
 edge of the voices of dissent that we've heard tonight.  Patricia Blake is an
 authority on Russian literature.  She has written extensively on Soviet dissent,
 and is the author of several books, including "Dissident Vocies in Soviet Liter-
 ature."  She is a,contributing editor to Time Magazine.     Abraham Brumberg pro-
 bably is as familiar as any American with the dissident movement in Soviet
 Russia, and he is now writing a book on political opposition in the Soviet Union.
 For-many years editor of the journal, Problems of Communism, he most recently
 edited a collection of Russian documents entitled "In Quest of Justice: Protest
 and Dissent in the Soviet Union Today."  We asked the official Soviet news agency
 in New York to send a representative to comment on these interviews.  They de-
 clined.
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400050001-7
 One thing that interests me, with two people who know about as much about Russia
 as you can from this far away.  What was the - what was the impact of those
 interviews?  Miss Blake?
 BLAKE:  Shattering, really.  One has the impression of such nobility and purity
 and heroism.  I felt that viewing and hearing them speak was an ennobling experi-
 ence, I think, for Americans.
 REASONER:  Who are the people.that we're talking about?  What do the three people
 that we saw and the one that we heard represent?  Mr. Brumberg?
 BRUMBERG:  Well, I think we saw three representatives of what I would call the
 free, untrammeled spirits of Russia.  It is a phenomenon which is as characteristic
 of the Soviet Union as it was of pre-Revolutionary Russia.  These are people who
 are fired by a passion against injustice.  They may endure injustices for a long
 time;  they may be silent, but when they do finally speak out, nothing-is going
 to stop them.  They will court arrest, imprisonment, exile, possibly even execu-
 tion, for their beliefs.  I think this is a very, I think, as Pat said, a very
 ennobling phenomenon, and a very moving and a very-typical Russian type that we
 saw.
 REASONER:  Well, now, if they're characteristic of a type of Russian, what about
 the reaction of the regime to them?  Is that characteristically Russian?
 BRUMBERG:  Well, I would say that too is characteristically Russian, yes.  Of
 course, we have to distinguish between the reaction of the regime in Stalin's
 days, and the reaction to - of the regime since Stalin's days.  Understand, any
 dissent would have been absolutely unthinkable, even the slightest flare of
 skepticism or disagreement would be suppressed, so that speaking up was unthink-
 able.  Since Stalin's death, we. have seen the rise of what might be called a
 public opinion in the Soviet Union.  It is-still very small.  These people still
 are very much pereecut'ad by the regime.  In fact, if anything, there has been a
 reversal from a relatively lenient policy that existed in the last years of
 Khrushchev's reign, to more - more repression.  It is not the kind of repression
 that was practiced by Stalin, but it is - has still very grievous effects.
 REASONER:  They spread the word among themselves by means of this underground
 newspaper.  How many of them are there, would you guess, in percentage terms.
 If there were an election, a free election, in Russia today, would they be a
 major third party, or second party?
 BLAKE:  You know, it's very hard to judge - incalculable, even-it there were
 sociology, even if there were polls in Russia, it's really hard to measure the
 thrust and influence of ideas on people.  And sometimes ideas take a long time,
 to mature.  But in the words of Leo Tolstoy:  "A word is an act," and will cause
 reverberations and resonances which will not be seen immediately.  But later on,
 and we've seen this movement develop in an extraordinary way.  The numbers -
 it's hard to say'- you can have numbers from a hundred to ten thousand, just hard
 core people engaged in an active way in this democratic movement.
 BRUMBERG:   May I, perhaps, add one other thing, that we ought to distinguish be-
 tween the active dissenters and their passive collaborators.  I think that the
 very existence of a newspaper such as the Chronicle of Current Events attests to
 the fact that there are people who?,-while they may not be necessarily willing to
 put their signatures on some of the petitions printed, nevertheless will help

 out a great deal in circulating, informing the editors of this newspaper of re-
 prisals, of what has been going on in the camps, which is one of the most fasci-
 nating items that we read in this Chronicle, are hunger strikes., political pro-
 tests within the labor camps in the Soviet Union.  How do these items get out
 from the camps?  We don't know.  But I think it's safe to assume that there are
 quite a few people who are willing to collaborate with the dissenters in making
 their word known throughout the world.
 REASONER:  How typical is a - is a fairly harsh punishment?  Mr. Ginzburg spoke,
 in the tape from the labor camp, of dozens of his friends, of more than a dozen
 deaths in recent months.  Does a Soviet intellectual stand a fair chance of wind-
 ing up in jail?
 BLAKE:  A Soviet dissident intellectual, certainly.
 REASONER:  Part of what the people we heard from tonight are saying is that they
 are merely demanding the freedoms that they technically have.  Is that correct?
 There's nothing unconstitutional about what they did?
 BRUMBERG:  They do   some see as their main -their strongest weapon, the exist-
 ence on paper of legal rights.  The constitution of the Soviet Union is one of
 the most democratic and liberal constitutions in the world.  It promises freedom
 of speech, freedom>of assembly, and when these dissenters speak up, they point to
 the fact that what they are demanding is in effect the observance of Soviet laws.
 They know very well thlat these Soviet laws are not observed, are violated and
 abused continuously.
 BLAKE:  This, by the way, is a completely new element in Russian dissent.  I say
 Russian, not only Soviet dissent.  In the absence of any institutions, any demo-
 cratic institutions, pressure groups and so on, in which you can make yourself
 heard, what you - since you're helpless to do anything else, you take these ex-
 isting institutions and try and make them fulfill their ideal original function.,,
 And this is the strategy.
 REASONER:  They - they also don't seem to be internationalists, particularly,
 are they?  They're very Russian.
 BRUMBERG:  Well, in a lot of the major-areas of dissent, not the most, but one
 of the causes the dissenters have taken up is the invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 This is - this was very important about a year ago.  We have quite a few docu-
 ments protesting, and cases of individuals and groups, and even a demonstration
 in Red Square.  Small; to be sure, but typical of the passion.
 REASONER:  What do you make so far of the reaction of the government?  Do you -
 how do you judge which way they will go?  Will they tolerate more dissent or less?
 BLAKE:  You knows these do leave us in a terrible dilemma.  What - what we see in
 the last year suggests that without far greater doses of power, the influence of
 these people cannot be controlled.  It's not sufficient to arrest two or three.
 As Yakir said himself:  "They will kill us, they will beat us, but people will
 go on thinking differently."  But if they choose to re-institute the whole
 machinery of mass police power that we had under Stalin, then they would pay a
 very high price for it.   And I think they are very much aware of that.  For one
 thing, those people who are living in the Kremlin today know full well that if

 they re-institute this machine of power, they may be among the first to be de-
 voured by it.  And secondly, the whole thrust of Soviet policy in the '50s and
 'GCs has been to try and give Soviet citizens some incentives for creative tech-
 nology, in the sciences, for the worker, and if you re-impose power, then you
 have a - a submissiveness which lacks any sort of dynamic.  You cannot rule with-
 out an internal dynamic of some sort.
 REASONER:  What about the Russian man on the street, if there is such a thing?
 What would - what would these interviews mean to him?  Would he sympathize, or
 is he - is he happy with a generally better material lot?
 BRUMBERG:  Well, it's very difficult to answer this question.  I'm sure there
 are those who would regard some of these people as - just as intellectuals, which
 means the ordinary people have very little in common.  On the other hand, I think
 we have to remember that there exists a vast reservoir of grievances and dis-
 satisfaction - Amalrik spoke about it.  The peasants are dissatisfied, the work-
 ers are dissatisfied.  And not only because of economic grievances, but also be-
 cause of social and political repressions that are practiced against them.  And
 I think the future, in my opinion, of this whole movement of dissent, the demo-
 cratic movement, will depend very largely on the links that the intellectuals
 will or will not be able to establish with the ordinary people.
 REASONER:  If you could put yourself into somebody-else's shoes; suppose an offi-
 cial and believing member of the Soviet regime was in our group tonight.  What
 would his reaction be?  How would he explain those films?
 BLAKE:  I think the refusal of Soviet officials to come here suggests that they
 would be unable to cope with the questions raised so eloquently by those three
 dissenters and by Ginzburg in prison.
 REASONER:  What will the - what will the reaction be, officially and in the Soviet
 Union, to this broadcast, and to other television use which will probably be made
 of it?
 BRUMBERG:  Oh, I think the Soviet authorities. are going to be very displeased.
 They usually tend to dismiss the dissenters more or less as psychiatrically -
 more or less as misfits, as social misfits, and as representing nobody but them-
 selves.  This is their usual way of coping.  But they are very well aware that
 these people are not misfits, but on the contrary they are the most - they are
 the most articulate, perhaps the most intelligent of the Soviet intellectuals to-
 day, and that they are faced with a very serious ferment within Soviet society.
 And this is why they are going to be quite displeased with bringing that ferment
 out on the television screen.
 REASONER:  Will the - will wide attention for these men help them?. I mean,.will,
 it protect them?
 BLAKE:  Well,. who knows, it will probably protect them for a time.  Certainly
 people like Pasternak, for example, who was protected by his winning the Nobel
 Prize, by publicity in the West.  But sooner or.later, the KGB, which operates
 in some ways independently from the political leadership, that prepares its
 cases, and it waits until the political time is right for them to move.

 BRUMBERG:  I would say this, that the more formidable the stature of the dissen-
 ter, the greater the chances of an outcry in the West as a deterrent to further
 reprisals. A man like Solzhenytsin, though deprived of any possibility of pub-
 lishing, and making himself known within the Soviet Union, nevertheless because
 of his worldwide reputation, and also because of his reputation inside the Soviet
 Union, has thus far been left relatively alone.  The smaller, the less signifi-
 cant the dissenter, the greater will be the weight of the police apparatus upon
 him.
 BLAKE:  It hasn't saved Amalrik, has it?
 REASONER: Amalrik charged his government with a kind of a senility which is a
 strange thing for a revolutionary movement to be in - in half a century.  Is this
 a characteristic of communism, do you think, or a characteristic of Russia? .

 The Russians have compressed whole eras of national development into their half
 century of communism, from the rough, new enthusiasm of revolution through the
 terror of psychotic dictatorship to a period of great pride in material achieve-
 ment, and now, these Russian critics of the government say, to a kind of old age
 of communism, a stultification of bureaucracy and repression.  The critics ob-
 viously hate to see it happen.  They spoke their risky pieces to Bill Cole's
 camera out of patriotism and love, not enmity.  Even though some of the senti-
 ments of these dissenters sound like a highly intensified version of what our
 dissenters say about the United States, it's difficult for Americans to under-
 stand a society where criticism of the government .is a crime.                But in the next

 YULI DANIEL DUE TO BE RELEASED
 On 20 September 1965 Yuli Daniel was arrested in Moscow by the KGB
 while at the same approximate time Andrey Sinyavsky was arrested in Novo-
 sibirsk.   The two authors were given a rigged trial for "slandering" the
 Soviet system and sentenced in February 1966, Sinyavsky to seven years
 at hard labor and Daniel to five years at hard labor.   Inasmuch as terms
 in Soviet labor camp or prison customarily start from the time of arrest,
 Daniel's term should be up on 20 September, 1970.
 Daniel was sent to the Potma Camps in the Mordvinian Republic, to
 join thousands of other political prisoners.   He withstood the efforts
 of his keepers to break him with heavy work that overtaxed his war-
 wounded shoulder, and with shop work under such noise conditions that
 he was deafened.  According to Anatoly Marchenko, a fellow prisoner,
 Daniel maintained such high spirit that he earned the respect and ad-
 miration of even the hardest, most anti-intellectual of the other pris-
 oners.   The Soviet authorities, evidently frustrated by their inability
 to break Daniel in the labor camp, transferred him in September 1969 to
 the Vladimir Prison where he is believed to be presently.
 The Free World's press unanimously and spontaneously charged the
 USSR with reverting to Stalinism.   Intellectuals at all levels and in
 large numbers petitioned for the immediate release or, alternatively,
 a fair trial of the two.   The media of twelve Communist Parties in Free
 World countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, UK, France, Italy,
 Austria, Uruguay, US, Iceland, Chile) protested (albeit belatedly) that
 the Sinyavsky-Daniel case was hurting their image.
 Within the USSR the treatment of Sinyavsky and Daniel was regarded,
 according to Pyotr Yakir, one of the articulate voices of the Russian
 underground, as "the most important turning point" in the thinking of
 the Soviet people.   Why, they asked, should people such as Sinyavsky
 and Daniel be arrested for speaking about what they thought.   However,
 in practical terms, there were only weak forces able to oppose the op-
 pression of persons for their convictions.   For example, samizdat, or
 self-published writings distributed from hand to hand, was effective
 in raising and spreading indignation but totally without influence on
 Soviet policy-makers who persevered in tightening up their control over
 the Soviet people during the following years.
 Also with the passage of the years less and less concern has been
 voiced for Daniel and Sinyavsky as the Soviets have made every effort
 to keep information on them to a minimum.   The Soviet authorities are
 undoubtedly deluding themselves, however, if they think that the two
 jailed authors have faded from the memories of freedom lovers in the

 USSR and around the world.   For, as another Soviet protester, Alexander
 Ginzburg, said on a tape smuggled out of his concentration camp, "We
 are sustained. . .by the wrath, protest and solidarity of all honest
 people, of all who hold dear the dignity of man, democracy and peace."
 Whereas it's difficult and risky (but not impossible) for Soviet citi-
 zens to note that Daniel ought to be released when his term is up,
 there is no obstacle hindering the Free World press from going on
 record that it is vigilantly watching for solid evidence that Yuli
 Daniel will regain his freedom.

 SOVIET CARTOGRAPHIC INDISCRETIONS AT HOME AND ABROAD
 "9oviet  Atlas ?  Look  under
 'Eictlon'l"
 Sudhir Dar in

 Hindustan Times
 7 August 1970
 CPYRGHT
 Earlier this year the Western. press carried stories about. West European
 and American cartographers having discovered how their opposite numbers in
 the USSR were keeping the Soviet Union on the move by falsifying all official
 maps available to the general public.  According to the specialists, Soviet
 charts and atlases published in recent years have been designed to move coast-
 lines, towns, rivers, and other map features at random by as much as 25 miles.
 (A sampling of those press clips is attached.)
 Since the first articles appeared, it has been noted that other towns
 sometimes disappear for years and then suddenly pop up again -- as in the case
 of Sarova.   It is not only Western cartographers who are alarmed by the Soviet
 mappers' callous disregard for accuracy, the Estonians too are complaining of
 short shrift given them in the newest maps of the Estonian Republic.  When the
 Soviets consider it politically expedient, international borders can be shifted
 with equal callousness -- and not only Soviet borders:   in 195+ the USSR carto-
 graphically gave China some 50,000 square miles of territory belonging to India.

 To date, the Soviets refuse to give this territory back to India.
 Simultaneously, though generous with Indian territory, the Soviets
 have no qualms about arrogantly laying claim to some of the disputed
 islands along the Sino-Soviet border, as they did just last month.
 The Mystery of Sarova
 About 300 miles east of Moscow in the Mordvinian Autonomous
 Soviet Socialist Republic is the mysterious little town of Sa:rova
 -- mysterious because after 1958 it vanished and in 1969, reappeared.
 Sarova is a famous old landmark.  According to Baedeker's Russia of
 1914, on an excursion from Moscow to Kazan one might well stop off
 at Arzamas, enjoy its railroad restaurant, and make a short side trip
 to the Sarov Convent.   The following description is given:   "About 50
 versts (33 miles) southwest of Arzamas lies the Sarov Convent
 (Sarovskaya Pustyn) founded in the 17th century and containing the
 wonder-working remains of Seraphim, who died in 1833 and was canonized
 in 1903."  Things have changed.  Undoubtedly the convent still stands,
 but today the entire Mordvinian Autonomous Republic is "off limits" to
 all foreigners and the area around the Sarov Convent is a Natural Re-
 serve and as such is "off limits" to all but a handful of Soviet
 scientists, none of whom would concern themselves with the "wonder-
 working remains of Seraphim."
 The desecration of the Sarov Convent is cited by many older-
 generation Russians as typifying the way in which the Soviets wage
 propaganda against religion of any kind.   In 1935 the Soviet govern-
 ment officially designated the area surrounding the Sarov Convent
 as the Mordvinian Natural Reserve (Mordovski Zapovednik) "for pro-
 tection of particular kinds of landscape for the southern forest belt."
 The area is over 95 percent forested.  According to a 1969 publication,
 the USSR has some 91 Natural Reserves set aside to preserve nature and
 open only to scientists.
 But why did the Soviet map makers bother to take Sarova off the
 map -- and then last year put it back again?  The Sarovka River, which
 crosses the Natural Reserve area, has now disappeared too.   In Soviet
 atlases and on Soviet Territorial Administrative maps published in 1939
 Sarova appears as a town with a population of approximately 500 and
 nearby roads and a rail line are depicted as is the Sarovka River; no
 indication is given of the boundary area for the Natural Reserve.   In
 both the Atlas Mira of 195+ and a Territorial Administrative map of
 1958 Sarova is a town with a population of less than 10,000 located
 within the approximately 80,000 acre area (indicated by,-!J 4- lines;
 see the attached map insert illustrations) designated for the first
 time as the "Mordovski Zapovednik."  There is no Sarova in the Soviet
 atlases published in 1962 and 1967 or on Territorial Administrative
 maps issued in 1959 and 1966.   On the 1966 map the area incorporating
 the Natural Reserve has been expanded and the Sarovka River has dis-

 appeared.  A Territorial Administrative map published in 1969, however,
 puts Sarova back in its previous location and shows it again to be a
 town with a population of slightly under 10,000; the Sarovka is still
 missing.
 The Sovietization of Estonia
 In the attached article reprinted from the 7 February 1970 issue
 of Sovetski Estonii, an outraged Estonian Docent at Tartus State Uni-
 versity takes Soviet cartographers to task for their callous disregard
 for accuracy in a series of newly published Administrative maps of the
 Estonian SSR.  Without coming right out and saying it, the author's
 chief complaint is that the map makers have Sovietized Estonia.   This
 they accomplished through misspellings, erroneous transliterations of
 Estonian names, and by omission of the names of some 98 populated places
 which are centuries old.   Errors in drafting the drainage network, the
 appearance of a "mythical gulf which has 'flooded' two villages," and
 the unfortunate selection of insignificant hamlets to list as secondary
 populated areas are among the many other shortcomings scored by the
 author.
 "Cartographic Aggression" Against India
 The USSR's reissuance again four months ago of an official map of
 Asia which continues to cede some 50,000 square miles of the Sino-
 Indian boundary to China caused indignant walkouts this summer from
 both houses of India's Parliament.   The attached clips from Indian and
 other news media tell how this Soviet provocation, which many Indian
 Members of Parliament view as "blatant Soviet cartographic aggression,"
 has rankled India for the past 15 years.
 The objecting Members of Parliament charged the Government with
 failing to make the Soviet Union revise its maps containing the errone-
 ous delineations of India's northern territories and walked out after
 they in turn failed to get any assurances from the Minister of External
 Affairs, Mr. Swaran Singh, that the Government would ask the Soviet
 Union to issue a corrigendum to its newest map.   The Minister told Par-
 liament that the USSR had assured India that the wrong depiction of
 India's boundaries did not  "in any way affect or reflect the Soviet
 Government's understanding of and respect for India's frontiers."  As
 one correspondent points out, however, all East European countries, in-
 cluding Yugoslavia, use official Soviet maps.
 During the last few years the Indian Government has come across
 several official Soviet publications, all of them corroborating Chinese
 claims to regions along India's northeastern and northwestern frontier.
 These publications included all editions of Atlas Mira since 1954, a
 map of India published by the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1956, educa-
 tional atlases published in 1967 and 1969, and a wall map based on a
 Soviet cartographic survey issued in 1967.  Also during the last few

 years, Indian representations failed to  elicit from Moscow anything
 more than a standard reply that matters "would be looked into."  The
 final affront came in May this year with the publication of Volume I
 of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia which includes an official map of Asia
 that shows the same 50,000 square-mile area still cartographically ceded
 to China.
 "Cartographic Imperialism" Against China
 Last month the Soviets announced plans to develop two of the many
 islands along the disputed Sino-Soviet border.  An announcement which
 in effect signals Peking that these particular: islands are incontest-
 ably Soviet territory and that they are not to be negotiated.   The is-
 land area, at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, is by far.
 the most important of the more than 700 border islands claimed by both
 China and the Soviet Union.   It lies just opposite the strategic city
 of Khabarovsk, Headquarters of the USSR Far East Military District.
 Soviet maps depict the area as including two islands, the Tarabarov and
 Big Ussuri.   The two are separated by a narrow channel.   So narrow is
 the channel that on Chinese maps the island is one, Hei-hsia-tzu or
 "Blindman's Alley."
 The Soviet development plans were published in an article in the
 2 August issue of an important Party newspaper, Sovetskaya Rossiya, in
 which Soviet planners proposed extensive agricultural development of
 the area through the establishment of three large collective farms to
 produce milk, meat, potatoes and vegetables for Khabarovsk.   The article
 describes the projected plan as an outgrowth of decisions taken at the
 July plenum of the Party's Central Committee, thereby reinforcing Soviet
 claims to ownership of the territory.   The article also alludes to the
 area as important for the defense of Khabarovsk and refers to Chinese
 use of the island area as an operational base for Red Guard detachments,
 thereby reinforcing the impression that the area is of more strategic
 than economic value to the USSR.  A translation of the Soviet article
 is attached.   To date, Chinese media have not reacted to the Soviet an-
 nouncement.
 Note:   Comparison of the attached reprints from four Soviet maps de-
 picting the area of the Mordvinian Natural Reserve illustrates
 paucity of data given on maps and map legends in the later series.

 Governrnent'cartographcrs have!

 phifts in recent official atlases
 that seem to indicate distortion
 of'the entire map or the Soviet
 Union for national security.
 According to the specialist
 the Russian charts and atlases,
 once renowned for their stan-
 dards of excellence, have been
 designed in the last few years
 to move coastlines, towns, riv-
 ers and other map features at

 ,in an apparent attempt at de-
 ception.     l

 ,cases of such deformations,
 `which have also been detected

 Russia was moved 10 miles
 from its true location. on a

 road lines were twisted out of

 vised map locations are based
 on new surveys Is ruled out by

 ground that most of the Soviet

 SOVIET UNION:
 Atlas Shrugged
 -e  ussians almost got away %v-t r it.
 If it hadn't been for n tcani of shnrp-
 e-yed U.S. Government experts, the  at.
 est edition of Moscow's famed World
 Atlas would still be considered the best.
 But during a routine review, the Ameri-
 cans stumbled upon some glaring inac-
 curacies in the otherwise im recable
 maps. And last week they revealed that,
 in their judgment, those distortions were
 ,no accident but part of a conscious Soviet
 attempt at deception.
 What led the U.S. experts to this con-
 'elusion was the fact that the Russians
 are hardly neophyte cartographers. On
 the contrary, they have long enjoyed a
 worldwide reputation for their pinpoint
 precision. Yet, in the second edition of
 the World Atlas, which was published
 in 1967, several Soviet towns, railroad
 lines, lakes i{nd rivers have been moved
 ,from their true locations, in some cases
 by as much as 25 miles. The vital rail
 junction of Nevcl in western Russia, for
 'example, was shifted 10 miles away from
 its lakeshore location. Stretches of Soviet
 coastline bordering the icy Gulf of Fin-
 land were extensively distorted. And in
 remote Siberia, Bratsk, a city of 300,000
 people, underwent a major cartographic
 .transformation (map). The site of the
 Ovorld's largest hydroelectric plant, Bratsk
 is a key outpost in Moscow's attempt to
 develop its Siberian resources. It also,
 presumably, is important enough to be
 targeted for an intercontinental-ballistic-
 1uissile strike should the U.S. or China go
 to-wart with Russia In the future...
 There was little doubt that the securi-
 ty-conscious Russians had distorted the
 maps in an effort to mislead strategic
 planners in Washington and Peking.
 Work on the new maps began sometime
 in the mid-1960s, a tin-c when Moscow
 knew little about the sophisticated tech-
 niques of U.S. satellite photography. By
 now, of course, spy satellites have made
 it virtually impossible for Russian cartog-
 raphers to pull the wool over the eyes of
 their counterparts in the U.S. As for the
 Chinese, they presumably possess old-
 but perfectly accurate-Soviet' maps of
 their own. Thus, in order to deceive

 tradition, an obsessive preoccupation with,
 military secrecy.
 But, though it was understandable that
 'wartime Britain should remove its sign-
 posts to ensure the benighting of all those
 nuns who might be disguised German
 parachutists, the military value of the
 Soviets change the map: Red            Soviet ploy is far from clear: It is true

 SHORTCOMINGS OF A ,NEW MAP
 From the mail of "Soviet Estoniya"
 After more than a ten-year interval, a new administrative map of the
 Estonian SSR has finally appeared.  1/
 A total of 92,00 copies have been issued, of which )0,000 have appeared
 on the book market and were quickly sold out.  One might conclude that the
 new map has fully satisfied its customers.  However, there is no basis for
 such complacency.
 It is true that the first impression of the map design is favorable.
 A dense network of highways, a large number of populated places, rayon
 boundaries, and a schematic depiction of the rivers and large lakes are all
 found on the map.
 However, in the course of working with the map mistakes and defects come
 to light, deficiencies which should be corrected in the next edition.  Names
 are distorted, as in Cape Purekkari and Kassare Island, and also errors have
 been made in the transliteration of Latvian names into the Estonian language.
 There are mistakes in the drafting of the drainage network:  the basin of Lake
 Vyrts'yarv is shown connected in two places (along the rivers Ykhne and
 Tyanassil'ma) with the rivers of the Riga Gulf basin, which does not correspond
 to the truth in either case.  On the western shore of Lake Vyrts'yarv is shown
 a mythical gulf which has "flooded" two villages (Kivilyppe and Yarve).
 There are also inaccuracies in the spelling of populated places.  In
 Valgaskiy rayon, Igaste is given instead of the correct Iygaste.  In Vyruskiy
 rayon, Obiniste is given in place of Obinitsa; in Yygevaskiy rayon, Pudukyula
 instead of Pudivere; in Kokhtla-Yarveskiy rayon, Viluze instead of the correct
 Viluzi, and in place of Tarumaa--Taruma.  In Pyl'vaskiy rayon, Maritsa is shown
 instead of the correct Maaritsa, and Maekyula instead of Myaekyula; in
 Pyarnuskiy rayon, Yukhasel'ya is given instead of Yukhassel'ya.  In Tartuskiy
 rayon, the Tyakhtvereskiy sel'soviet is located not in Rakhinge, but in
 Il'matsalu.  On Mukhu Island, the Kuyvastu settlement and landing for ferry
 boats plying the strait is represented as the unknown hamlet of Vyykyula.   But
 all these errors are insignificant in comparison with the absurd choice of
 populated places to be represented on the map.
 The most annoying shortcoming of the map is the fact that, out of 237
 sel'soviets, only 139 are named on the map.   The vast majority (90%) of the
 Estonian sel'soviets carry the names of centuries-old populated places.   These

 are ancient villages and towns, whose names were later used by churches and
 parishes, then by volosts, and finally by the sel'soviets.  Under the names of
 these sel'soviets (parishes)have been organized the valuable collections of many
 of the Estonian SSR's institutions:  the State Historical Archives, and treasures
 of the Ethnographic Museum, the collections on dialects and phonetics of the
 Institute of Language and Literature, and the materials of the Commission on
 Regional Studies of the Academy of Sciences and of other institutions.
 Why, then, do we not see on the map the names of such well-known
 populated places, for which sel'soviets are named, as Alatskivi, Val'yals,
 Kaarma, Karksi, Myniste, Paystu, Rannu, Ridala, Khummuli, Emmaste, and at
 least 80 others?  The "secret" lies in the fact that these sel'soviets are
 "'encoded" under the little-known names of Lakhepere, Kiriku, Kaysvere, Kaali,
 Rooksoo, Aydu, Valla-Palu, Kyabla, Soe, Viyterna, and others.  As it happened,
 however, the executive committees of the rural soviets, about which we are
 speaking, are located not in the well-known settlements mentioned above, but
 in their outskirts, where there were vacant houses.  The map, however, denotes
 only their addresses--that is, the names of farmsteads, hamlets, and crossroads
 where these buildings stand.  Thus, in order to find the true names of the
 sel'soviets, one has to refer to the handbook of administrative-territorial
 divisions, and, from the addresses written on the map, reconstruct their names.
 The second major shortcoming of the map is the unfortunate selection
 of "other" (secondary) populated points.  For the most part, these are completely
 insignificant hamlets, places where the finger of the compiler happened to
 stop in his perusal of the source materials.  To make matters worse, his
 approach has turned up names which have nothing at all in common with the
 socialist transformation in the republic's rural economy, although it would seem
 to be time to consider carrying on the map the names of the new, well-
 established central settlements of sovkhozes and kolkhozes.
 Near Tallinn, there is a suburban sel'soviet bearing the name of the
 ardent revolutionary A. Sommerling.  More than 500 people are already residing
 in the central settlement of this sovkhoz.  The sovkhoz is the place of
 pilgrimage for numerous foreign delegations and is well known abroad.  However,.
 neither the sel'soviet nor the settlement is designated on the map; only the
 sel'soviet's location is given--the settlement of Lekhm'ya.
 In designating populated places on the map one ought to take into
 consideration their economic significance as well as their population size.
 To do so, it is necessary to have a good knowledge of the geography of the
 republic and to use various sources of information.  The cartographer who
 compiled this map is evidently not well versed in the subtleties' of the
 republic's geography and economy.
 One cannot help but conclude that the preparation of such maps requires
 the aid of persons well versed in the geography of the republic.  'T'here are
 sufficient-numbers of such specialists in Estonia.  Furthermore, they should
 participate in the initial compilation of the map,.not after the completion
 of the proof when only minor corrections are permitted.  For this, the
 cartographic enterprise ought to send a copy of the original draft, as well as
 a list of specific features, to other geographers for review and revision

 (for example, to Tartu State University or the editorial board of the
 Encyclopedia of the Estonian SSR); a copy should also be sent--for checking
 the transliteration--to the linguists in the Institute of Language and Liter-
 ature of the Academy of Sciences of the ESSR.  The administrative map is,
 necessary as a reference aid for the organization of workers in the most
 diverse professions.  The improvement of its quality requires the joint
 efforts of cartographers, geographers and management personnel.

 Walk-out In Rajy a Sabha'
 on Soviet maps
 Minister's explanation fails
 to satisfy MPs
 Hindustan Times Correspondent
 New Delhi, Aug. 6-The External Affairs Minister, Mr Swaran Singh, today
 (N) benches made a scathing attack on  the Government for its failure to make
 the Soviet Union revise its maps containing wrong delineation of ' India's  northern,
 boundaries.
 The issue was raised through a calling- attention motion, notice for which was given
 by Mr M. K. Mohta (Swa) and 15 others who pointed out that the Soviet map had.
 4llhowrl. large chunks of Indian territory as Chinese.
 Having failed to secure an assurance from the Minis-
 ter that the Government of India would ask the Soviet
 Union to bring out a corrigendum, almost the  entire-
 Opposition walked out.  Several members took notice of
 an "otherwise so vocal" CPI group leader, Mr Bhupesh
 Gupta, who remained behind, completely indifferent to
 the question.
 Sharing  the  members'  senti-
 ments, Mr Swaran Singh express-
 ed his "disappointment" with the
 Soviet authorities who  had not
 fulfilled -their earlier promises
 and reproduced faulty maps even
 In the latest edition of the "Great
 Soviet Encyclopaedia."  But he
 pleaded with the members not to
 be unduly exercised over it since-
 the USSR representatives had ex-
 plained that the matter had been
 dealt with in a "technical man-
 ner by their  cartographers  and
 specialists."
 The Soviet Union had further.
 assured India that "this' has  no,
 political significance" inasmuch as
 .'the USSR continued to "respect";
 India's territorial  integrity  and 4

 to take suitable steps for remov-
 the   technical  difficulties,
 whatever they might be so that
 "our territory is correctly. shown
 In their maps."  The issue was
 being pursued through diplomatic
 channels and at '-igher levels.'
 While walking out, the opposi-
 tion leader, Mr S. N. Mishra. des-
 cribed the Soviet action as "car-
 tographic  aggressior"  on India
 The fact that the USSR had been
 persistently flouting tb- friendly
 relations since 1956' without caus-
 ing any serious concerts  in  the
 Government. of India, slowed how
 come to the Soviets, according
 Mr Mishra,
 Mr Mohta was  surprised  that.

 ccepted the explanation giver by

 ontents had the approval of the

 so wanted to know why In reply
 o  an earlier ouestion, the Gov-,
 rnment had   not  included  the

 Mr Swaran    Singh refuted the'
 harge that the Government had
 shown any softness towards the
 viets, but the acts of friendly
 ountries  could  not be equated

 otivation was a material factor.
 111 the same, the Government of
 dia had taken strong ob.iection

 of the   "epoch  making"   Great

 TEXT OF SOVIET RUSSIA ARTICLE ON AMUR ISLANDS
 [Article by Far East Agricultural Scientific Research Institute Director, Doctor
 of Agricultural Sciences S. Kazmin and USSR Geographical Society full member,
 USSR Oeographiaal Society Priamurskiy (Khabarovsk) Branch Scientific Secretary
 A. Stepanov ;    The Orbit of the Large City"]
 [Excerpts] Khabarovsk has a great history, it is filled with strikes and bitter
 class battles before the revolution.   In the years of foreign military
 intervention the city -suffered heavy destruction, but it was built anew and
 became even more beautiful.   The free labor of Soviet people and the enormous
 help of the Communist Party and the entire country created in the same, but
 greatly expanded region, where, once single-story huts huddled together, a new
 Khabarovsk, which conceded'nothing in appearance to the newly constructed
 cities that had risen up in the country in the years of socialist building.
 It is necessary to begin in 1922, when the occupiers were driven into the
 ocean.   The Khabarovsk inhabitants were at that time 30,000 strong; whereas
 now the city's population is approaching the half-million mark.
 Modern Khabarovsk is a city with a highly developed industry and the cradle
 of Par Eastern machine building, which is represented by machine-tool building,
 electrical machine building, diesel production shipbuilding, and other branches.
 The industrial output of the city, which has about 100 combines, plants, and
 factories, includes the most varied products, a part of which is exported to
 over 20 foreign countries.
 However, the city is not only the chief worker of Priamurskiy but is also a
 mighty generator of Soviet culcure.   Suffice it to say that a considerable section
 of the Far Eastern intelligeni..,ia received training in Khabarovsk.  Here there is
 now an extensive network of higher and specialized secondary academic institutions
 providing specialists not only for the district but also for other regions.   The
 resonance of the scientific work and the sphere of interests of the integrated
 academic and industrial scientific research institutes that have been created in
 Khabarovsk extends far beyond the4istriet's.confines..
 The present-day Khabarovsk reality is a true road to a still more glorious future.
 No matter how wide the Amur is as it flows around the city, from the bank opposite
 Khabarovsk one cannot completely view this 40-kilometer right-bank city lined
 with high buildings, masses of 5-story apartments, and splashes of park.  The
 intermittent clearings in this line represent reserved. areas for erecting new
 industrial enterprises and housing and green zones.   The dotted fencing of the
 tower cranes on the left signifies the construction of the new northern
 microrayon where thousands of new settlers have already moved.  The groups of
 accumulated cranes on the right signify the sites of the enterprises of the
 southern, industrial area, which are being expanded and reconstructed.
 Khabarovsk is also creating its own academgorodok.  The USSR Academy of Sciences'
 Par East.Center intends to open several scientific.-research institutes on the Amur.
 The development of Khabarovsk has changed manes age-old attitude toward the Amur
 and has included the river's left bank and particularly the islands within the
 orbit of iamediate urban plans.  They are a plane of relaxation and.an important

 The fact that the river has been creating the soil for thousands of years and feeding
 it makes the floodlands especially valuable for the city.   It remains only to protect'
 the most valuable portion from the advance of the highflood waters.  Age-old experience
 tells us where it is necessary to do this....
 Above Khabarovsk the great Far Eastern river divides into two branches, as if preparing
 a gift for the city by its path.   on its right channel, the Amur receives the blue
 waters of the Ussuri at the Kazakevichev?? settlement.  The left channel washes the
 islands--suburbs of Khabarovsk--on the wostern and northern sides.
 A garland of flood islands, Khabarovsk's distinctive suburb is spread between the
 channels.   The largest of them are called Tarabarov and Boishoy Ussuriysk.   Their
 total area is more than 30,000 hectares,
 These islands are particularly important as a part of the city's "lungs" and its
 outside green zone.   Here are the summer and winter fishing places which the residents
 love, the golden beaches filled with thousands of bathers in summer, and the highly
 popular winter ski runs.  The first settlers of Khabarovsk recognized the Islands
 as an agricultural suburban base because of their fertile lands.  The best hay and
 pasture lands in the area are found here.  The young animals and the dairy herds of
 the "Oarovskiy," "Druzhba," and "Krasnorechenskiy" Sovkhozes are kept on the islands
 in summer camps,  The heights, covered by floodwaters only in rare years, are covered
 with kitchen-garden crops.   The kolkhoz fishermen also have their interests on the
 islands--their fisheries, which yield quintals of large small-mesh fish (chastik),
 are located here,
 Industrial shops and city quarters have long since crossed the Amur channel and settled
 in part of Bolshoy Ussuriysk Island.  The settlement, which is an island suburb of
 Khabarovsk and was created as a result of the development of shipping on the Amur,-
 was named Ussuriyskiy.   Mechanics, metalworkers, woodworkers, boilermakers, and people
 with dozens of other specialities, the "healers" of the Amur River fleet, live there.
 Senior engineer of the cadres section of the Khabarovsk Technical Communications Sector
 Zoya Ivanovna Ivanova says:
 Ship- repair shops are located here which give new life to the entire communications
 fleet of our sector:   motor launches and dredgers.   Good quality welding, carpentry,
 and boiler shops have been built.  There is everything for work.   Of course we in the
 settlement have a full range of cultural, everyday, and educational establishments
 without which city life is inconceivable:   a school, club, library, kindgarten and
 day nursery, and canteen, radio, television, asphalted streets all are common here.
 We are even building more.   Recently, two brick apartment houses were commissioned
 and a third'begun.
 Some of the settlement's inhabitants work in Khabarovsk, and the journey there by
 launch is short and pleasant.  But the majority find work locally.  The settlement
 quarries sand and other local building materials for Khabarovsk construction sites.
 The settlement gives hospitable anchorage to and undertakes repair work on many dozens
 of Amur ships wintering in the creeks and canals of the island.  The river workers'
 heavy crane operations are done here.
 The Khabarovsk people love their islands just as the Leningrad people love theirs;
 this love has Andured much suffering, for the islands have a military history of
 glory as well as a working history.

 During the Civil War and the struggle against foreign interventionists, the
 revolutionaries' underground communication lines passed through here, and Red raiding
 detachments operated here.   A monument in the Kazakevichevo settlement recalls the'
 immortal feat of communists and Komsomol members who barred the White Guarr]3' path
 to Khabarovsk-
 The ialanda hive played their part in repulsing agg~Qaaion.  In 1931 Japanose
 imperialists seized northeast China-Manchuria.   They broke through from the Chinese
 left bank of the Ussuri to the Soviet right bank in order to create a bridgehead
 on it for new provocations.   Particularly attractive to the invaders were Taraborov
 and the Bolshoy Ussuriysk Islands, which faced the waterfront of the hated
 Khabarovsk, which was one of the main organizers of Soviet aid to the Chinese
 people in the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist struggle.
 Many times in those years the sacred blood of Soviet people was shed on the islands,
 blood of the Border Guards fighting enemy landing forces on the ice or in the water.
 Border Guards hero Mikhail Zhidkov gave his life in battles with Japanese brigands
 on the Ussuri in 1939.
 At the same time, seven border guards at a neighboring outpost put to flight
 an armed band of 22 men.   Machinegunner Ivan Telegeyenko was awarded the medal "'for
 valor" for bravery and resourcefulness.
 The realistic plans of the city's working people are linked with the Tarabarov and
 Bolshoy Ussuriysk islands now, when every region of the country is so widely and
 practically discussing specific ways to implement the CPSL Central Committee July
 Plenum decisions on the further development of agriculture.    In accordance with
 the plenum's materials, an extension of reclamation work in the Far East is envisaged.
 The Khabarovsk people see this as the prerequisite for strengthening the islands'
 role in supplying the city with provisions.
 The Far East State Institute for Planning Water Resources Projects [Dalgiprovodkhoz]
 has proposed for implementation a detailed general project for further assimilating
 the Tarabarov and Bolshoy Ussuriysk Islands by building on them three large highly-
 intensive sovkhozes.   Dairy and potato-vegetable production  will be the main
 trend of their work. Of the 30,000 hectares of the islands' agricultural pastureland
 planned for utilization, some 7,000 hectares will be used as arable land, and the rest
 of the area will remain as meadows and pastures.
 The Khabarovsk citizens' increase in health and cheerfulness cannot be measured
 numerically.   The possible increase of agricultural potential in connection with the
 creation of sovkhozes on islands would be decisive for satisfying the city's
 requirements.  Island sovkhoze& will be able to satisfy 50 percent of the city
 population's requirements for potatoes, even if it grows considerably, and a large
 proportion of the city's requirements for vegetables.    The "Pioneer" strain of
 potato which is cultivated in the island's light soils is distinguished by its
 fine-tasting qualities and its starch content of up to 18 percent.  With the building
 of local repositories, no additional transshipments are needed.   Any place in the
 city--restaurant', dining room, store--will always have fresh potatoes only 15 minutes
 away by motor vehicle in winter.   The island fodder base will permit the upkeep of
 an additional 5,600 head of livestock, including about 3,000 cows.  An annual increase
 of about 10,000 tons of milk, and 700 tons of meat--produce so essential for
 Khabarovsk--is expected.

 The practicability of the planned "Dalgiprovod};hoz" project is confirmed by
 the data of the Far East Scientific Research In?titute of Agriculture, which
 over a number of years has conducted experimental work on assimilation of lands on
 the islands for mowing-grass, long-term pastureland, sow fodder crops, potatoes,
 and vegetables.  Apart from the advantages in the grain of the soil and fertility,
 island soils, compared with those of the mainland, receive somewhat more warmth
 during the vegetative period.  The annual norm for precipitation is about 760
 millimeters.  The heat resources and moisture supplies of the islands, as confirmed
 by man9 years of experience, permit the growing of tomatoes, cucumbers, aubergines,
 marrows, watermelons, and melons, not to mention crops in lesser demand.  The
 proximity of water insures good irrigation in the dry half of the summer, while
 the light composition of the soil provides for draining away excess moisture in
 the second half of the summer, which is accompanied by the monsoon rains.
 The favorable conditions in combination with the application of ridge-and-bed
 [grebne-gryadkovaya] agrotechnology which has been devised by the agricultural
 institute permits potato and vegetable harvests that are at least twice as large
 as the present harvests gathered throughout the kray.  As has already been noted,
 it is advantageous to use a large proportion of the island territory for fodder-
 growing land.  A system of agrotechnical and improvement measures for the radical
 and surface improvement of meadows has been worked out and a technology for
 creating highly productive mowing-grass lands and pastureland has been proposed.
 In the conditions of a rainy summer it is extremely farsighted to utilize the
 island grasses to prepare valuable albumin, vitamin grass meal, cured hay, and
 early silage. In our view it would be advisable for this purpose to envisage the
 construction on the islands of a plant for grass meal production.  In such a case
 the procurement of fodder would cease to be restricted by the unfavorable climatic
 conditions taking shape on the kray precisely at this time.  Part of the fodder
 will be obtained from the now unutilized aftergrowth.
 On these islands sown fodder crops, primarily corn, are beneficial in the long
 term.
 Naturally, the assimilation of the island land tracts demands additional capital
 investments.  But would it really cost little now to assimilate the heavy taiga
 .soils which, moreover, are situated at a great distance from the kray center?  One
 can say that generations of Khabarovsk dwellers have dreamed about large-scale
 agriculture on the Tarabarov and Boishoy tlsiriysk Islands.  Now,the inhabitants
 of the Par East have at their disposal equipment which is capable of lifting them
 out of the flood zone relatively cheaply.  The islands of nature's treasure house
 will become shops of health and produce for the great Far East city,
