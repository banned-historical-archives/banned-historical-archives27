Hanoi, Peking and Moscow Views 
of Southeast Asia 
The CIA has prepared a memorandum (Tab A) entitled How Hanoi,  
Peking and Moscow View the New Situation in Southeast Asia, which 
includes two divergent views on the Communist threat to Thailand. 
Annexed to the memorandum are three separate papers covering 
Hanoi's, Peking's and Moscow's future policies toward Indochina 
and Thailand. 
The CIA Directorate of Intelligence concludes that practical restraints 
-dictate that oVer the next-two-or three years there will be few desta-
bilizing developments in the region. The key points of their analysis 
are: 
-- Buoyed by victory, North Vietnam's leaders will inevitably 
move to establish their country as a power to be reckoned with in the 
region; the pace and tactics they adopt will be major determinants of 
the relative tranquility of Indochina and Thailand. 
-- Over the next two or three years, however, practical restraints 
will temper the chances of destabilizing developments. 
-- Hanoi, Peking, and Moscow will be limited in their capacity to 
project influence in the region by the nationalistic sensitivities of the 
Southeast Asian states and by the priorities of other goals. 
-- The enormous tasks of reconstruction and development in the 
north, and the consolidation of power and socio-economic adjustments 
Hanoi will wish to introduce in South Vietnam will absorb most of North 
Vietnam's attention and resources for the next few years.

? The principal thrust of North Vietnam's efforts toward non. 
Communist Southeast Asia and the non-Communist world in general 
will be actively to broaden its diplomatic and economic ties with these 
areas. 
? The USSR and China are likely to have even less leverage over 
Hanoi's policies in the future than they have had in the past. 
While Moscow may maintain a slight edge over the Chinese in 
Hanoi, any efforts to woo the Vietnamese into taking up the Soviet cause 
against the PRC seem doomed to failure. 
? Although the Southeast Asian region at large will be the scene of 
jockeying for influence by the Chinese, Soviets, and Vietnamese, none 
seems inclined to raise tensions recklessly. The best estimate is that 
Peking, Moscow, and Hanoi have all concluded that improved relations 
with the established governments of the countries will pay greater 
dividends in the near term than support for revolutionary activity against 
them. 
However, Peking and Hanoi will not totally abandon the latter 
course. 
Developments in Thailand will be regarded elsewhere as a key 
indicator of Hanoi's intentions ? but an increase in support to the in-
surgents from either North Vietnam or China, sufficient to endanger. 25X1 
the non...Communist government of Thailand, does not seem to be in the 
cards.

rl'OP SECRET CODEWORD  
-- Increasing urban labor problems, intractable problems of 
land reform and pressure from the farmers, and continued student 
unrest are a constant drain on the energies of the government. 
-- While Hanoi and Peking for the moment are placing emphasis 
on developing their relations with. the established non-Communist 
governments of Southeast Asia, this school believes that this policy 
may well change in the next one to three years. 
? With all the weaponry presently available to North Vietnam, 
Hanoi has the means ? at low cost to itself -- to increase substan-
tially its support to the Thai insurgents. 
I would additionally comment that no Thai Government has addressed 
the insurgency with vigor. With only a minimal increase in support, 
Hanoi could make the insurgency a significant problem for Thailand, 
particularly in the Northeast; moreover, there is no reason to assume 
that current problems in Vietnam will inhibit Hanoi from increasing 
its support of the Thai insurgents. 
Prime Minister Khukrit came away from his China visit in july believing 
he had assurances from both Mao and Teng Hsiao-ping of Chinese succor 
should the North Vietnamese attack Thailand. Even if the Chinese gave 
such assurances, they no doubt realize that a direct North Vietnamese 
attack on Thailand is unlikely in the foreseeable future. 
Complementary Chinese and Vietnamese support for Thai insurgents 
has persisted since the insurgency's inception in 1962; however, 
should Hanoi seek to annex part of Thailand to Laos, as some reports 
indicate, rivalry and friction could develop between Hanoi and Peking 
over the future course of the "revolution" in Thailand.

AN OVERVIEFA1* 
The end of the war in Indo-China introduces a period of 
uncertainty and transition in Southeast Asia. Buoyed by victory, 
North Vietnam's leaders will inevitably move to establish their 
country as a power to be reckoned with in the region; the pace 
and tactics they adopt will be major determinants of the relative 
tranquility of Indo-China and Thailand. There will be some tension 
and intermittent squabbling -- not only among Hanoi and its nervous 
neighbors, but? among Hanoi and its wartime allies, China and the 
USSR. Divergent national interests are emerging as each seeks 
to exploit to its own advantage the diminution of American in-
fluence in the region. 
Over the next two or three years, however, practical res-
traints will temper the chances of destabilizing developments 
arising from the greater manifestation of Sino-Soviet rivalry in 
Southeast Asia, serious friction between Hanoi and either, of

her wartime patrons, or,the possibility of Hanoi adopting an 
_ _ _ . . . 
aggressive course of behavior toward her neighbors. Hanoi, 
Peking, and Moscow will be limited in their capacity to project 
influence in the region by the nationalistic sensitivities 
of the Southeast Asian states and by the priorities of other 
goals. Both Moscow and Peking in their rivalry with each other 
will continue to be concerned with maintaining good relations 
with Hanoi, if only to prevent the other from gaining any 
major advantage. Although the potential for tension between 
Peking and Hanoi is high, both probably will try not to allow 
their differences to get out of hand. 
The following paragraphs offer our best judgments on the 
interplay of these various factors and on the probable course of 
events in Southeast Asia over the next two or three years. 
THE FUTURE OF THE COMMUNIST ALLIANCE  
The enormous tasks of reconstruction and development in 
the north, and the consolidation of power and socio-economic adjust-
ments Hanoi will wish to introduce in South Vietnam, will absorb 
most of North Vietnam's attention and resources for the next few 
years. We believe that much of the energy Hanoi his left over 
will be devoted to the problems of Laos and Cambodia -- problems 
which will be important to the interplay of forces among Hanoi, 
Peking, and Moscow, but will impinge far less directly on the 
stability of other parts of Southeast Asia. This does not mean

No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/08/05: LOC-HAK-539-7-2-4 
that the North Vietnamese cannot give modest amounts of material 
or even advisory support to the Thai insurgents, but it will 
limit the scope of Hanoi's actions in Southeast Asia. 
In line with this basically inward orientation, the principal 
thrust of North Vietnam's efforts toward non-communist Southeast 
Asia and the non-communist world in general will be actively to 
broaden its diplomatic and economic _ties with these areas. Hanoi 
will want to reduce its dependence on Moscow and Peking to the 
extent possible in meeting its needs for foreign economic assis-
tance. While such aid will perforce continue to come largely 
from the USSR and China, North Vietnam will do its best to widen 
its range of suppliers. In the meantime, the Vietnamese leaders 
will maintain the careful balance between Moscow and Peking which 
has served them so. well in the past. The USSR and China are 
likely to have even less leverage over Hanoi's policies in the 
litiire than they have had in the past. 
Hanoi's relations with Peking in particular will probably 
show increasing strain. The two powers are essentially rivals 
for political influence in the region. They will have competing 
S.  
objectives in their relationships with Thailand -- both with the 
government in Bangkok and with the Thai insurgents in the country-
side. They also have conflicting claims to several islands (the 
Paraceis and the Spratleys) in the South China Sea, and the 
possibility of off-shore oil will only exacerbate this contentious

China is a potential counterweight to Vietnamese influence 
in Laos, but probably will not challenge Hanoi at the central 
level. It will continue an interest inlgorth and Northwest 
Laos, as a limited buffer zone along its border and possible 
entry point to Thailand and Burma. Peking has deferred to 
Hanoi's patronage of the Pathet Lao; there is no reason to expect 
a significant change in this arrangement in the near future. 
Cambodia offers quite a different picture. The hyper-nationalism 
of the Khmer communist leaders will contribute to very contentious 
relations with the Vietnamese, and will offE,17, a much larger 
role as a counterweight to Vietnamese pressure. The prospects for 
???,,  
continuing disputes with Vietnam are high. Both the contested 
delineation of their common border, conflicting claims to the 
continental shelf in the Gulf of Thailand, and ethnic animosities 
will fuel the flames. Leaders on both sides have indicated a 
desire to keep the squabbling within bounds, but the composition 
and policies of the Cambodian government are still very uncertain 
and offer few clues to its future behavior. 
China clearly has entree through its early support of Sihanouk 
and its subsequent ties with the Khmer communist leaders. More-
over, China can offer material and technical aid and, with the 
port of Kompong Som (Sihanoukville) now in communist hands, need 
not use Vietnamese transport facilities to move its aid. Peking 
will prefer to avoid assuming an adversary position against Hanoi,

but China's support will nonetheless permit the Cambodians to 
remain largely independent of Hanoi's leverage, and Cambodia is 
likely to become a point of friction in Peking's relations with 
Hanoi. 
Moscow's influence will remain marginal in both Laos and 
Cambodia. The Soviet reluctance to break with Lon Nol will make 
the development of cordial relations with the new regime very 
difficult -- a problem illustrated by the unceremonious departure 
of the USSR's mission from Phnom Penh. The recent Soviet approach 
to Sihanouk with offers of aid -- however fruitless ? will un-
doubtedly be followed up with persistent efforts to re-establish 
a presence in the country, ifsonly to prevent China from enjoying 
a clear field. Soviet efforts probably will produce little political 
return; the Khmer communists clearly see Peking as a more useful 
counterweight against Vietnamese pressure. But as the Cambodian 
regime shakes down and begins to open its windows to the world, 
the Soviets -- with their noses pressed to the pane -- will be 
back not enjoying much influence but greatly exciting Chinese 
concerns. 
In Laos, Moscow's limited influence in the-past was derived 
largely from its role as one of the sponsors of the coalition 
government. But it is increasingly doubtful that even a weak 
facade of coalition government will survive Souvanna Phouma, and 
its passing will mean the further diminution of the already limited

4110 lip 
Soviet role. Soviet relations with the Pathet Lao were never 
close and the current efforts to improve them are not likely to 
meet with any significant success. 
BEYOND INDO-CHINA  
Although the Southeast Asian region at large will be the 
scene of jockeying for influence by the Chinese, Soviets, and 
Vietnamese, none seems inclined to raise tensions recklessly. 
Our best estimate is that Peking, Moscow, and Hanoi have all con-
cluded that improved relations with the established governments 
of the countries will pay greater dividends in the near term 
than support for revolutionary activity against them. However, 
Peking and Hanoi will not totally abandon the latter course. For 
their part, the ASEAN nations will try to adjust to the changing 
power balance in the region by improving relations with the communist 
powers. Ite growing inclination toward neutrality in non-communist 
Southeast Asia will probably be accelerated. But such adjustments 
are likely to be cautious, with no dramatic shifts in political 
alignments. 
.The USSR will be less able than its rivals to capitalize on 
the new atmosphere in the area which in any event has a low 
priority in Soviet interests., With Moscow's attention largely 
focused elsewhere, there is little chance that in the near future 
the Soviets will seek or gain any significant military or strategic

Concurrent with these efforts will be accompanying warnings of 
the threat of Chinese-inspired subversion and insurgency and, no 
doubt, the periodic advocacy of an Asian collective security pact. 
This counsel will fall largely on deaf ears. The Soviet Union 
is still looked upon with great suspicion -- an image not likely 
to dissipate soon. 
For China, a heavy influence in Southeast Asia is very important, 
but Peking continues to see the US presence as a useful counterweight 
to the USSR. This is their overriding concern, and Peking thus is 
unlikely to press for a further diminution of the American role. 
Peking, in turn, is seen in some of the region's capitals as a 
potential counterweight to pressure from Hanoi. While the Chinese 
favor a restrained Vietnameseforeign policy, however, they will 
try to avoid antagonizing Hanoi by :assuming too blatantly a compet-
itive posture. 
North Vietnam's behavior will be carefully watched by the 
ASEAN countries. 'Hanoi will find them willing to develop more 
normal relations but apprehensive about Hanoi's intentions --
specifically, whether they embrace ambitions of further territorial 
hegemony or a commitment to supporting revolution beyond Indo-China's 
borders. 
Developments in Thailand will be regarded elsewhere as a key 
indicator of Hanoi's (as well as China's) intentions. Thailand's 
border with Laos allows the easy support of the insurgents in the

from either North Vietnam or China -- sufficient to endanger the 
non-communist government of Thailand -- does not seem to be in 
the cards. Hanoi is not likely to choose this road unless it feels 
utterly frustrated in its diplomatic relations. The insurgency's 
limited capacity for growth and general affiliation with the PRC 
make this an unlikely option for Hanoi to pursue. Moreover, such 
a course would risk reversing Thailand's drift toward a more neutral 
and compromising position. 
In sum Southeast Asia will be the scene of much maneuvering 
for advantage among Peking, Moscow, and Hanoi, in which tensions and 
acrioany will frequently surface. But the internal and other pre-
occupations of all the parties and the desire and will of the 
local regimes to maintain their independence argue against any 
any power gaining a significantly ascendent position. Judgments must 
be tentative. The abrupt end of the war caught everyone off guard, 
and, undoubtedly, options and policies have not yet been clearly 
determined. In any case, the communist sates of the area can be 
expected to join the more radical foes of the US in international 
gatherings. Their prickly, hypersensitive leaders will seek to 
demonstrate their divergence from US positions on nationalistic, 
ideological and economic grounds. Most of these problems, however, 
are likely to be irritants rather than major dangers.

THE VIEW FROM HANOI 
Hanoi's victory in South Vietnam has brought into focus new 
policy objectives that will modify its relationships-with its two 
principal wartime allies, the Soviet Union and China. The most 
obvious change is the diminished requirement for massive military 
assistance, but the end of the war also gives Hanoi the opportunity 
to break out of the relative diplomatic isolation imposed by the 
war and to play a broader-and more independent role in international 
affairs. Soviet and Chinese aid never gave its donors much leverage 
over DRV policy, due to their rivalry for Hanoi's favor which the 
Vietnamese leaders skillfully exploited. Nonetheless, Hanoi was 
never comfortable with the potential for leverage that its over-
whelming dependence suggested and is determined to reduce it by 
substantially broadening its political and economic contacts. 
The intense nationalism of Hanoi's leaders raises the poten-
tial for friction not only in its relations in the region but in 
its dealings with its old allies, most particularly with the PRC. 
There are already signs of such friction in the current embroglio 
over territorial claims in the Spratley and Paracel Islands. Hanoi's 
criticism of the PRC's occupation of the Paracels not only reflects 
Vietnam's drive to establish its national prerogatives, but the 
basic ethnic distrust and animosity long felt toward the Chinede 
but submerged for practical reasons during the Indo-China conflict. 
This underlying tension in their relations can be expected to

surface periodically, particularly when Hanoi suspects the Chinese 
of maneuvering to contain its influence in the region. 
Hanoi's pique at real or imagined short-comings in Soviet 
political and material support has caused occasional strains, but 
despite the overwhelming preponderance of Soviet aid, the Vietnamese 
have always seen Moscow as a more distant, and thus less threatening, 
influence -- one that was highly useful in balancing China's influence 
but not a serious competitor with Vietnam's regional interests. 
Moscow is also apparently enjoying the benefits of generous support 
that preceded the final stage of the war at a time when Peking, al-
though equally forthcoming with aid, reportedly was counseling 
restraint and compromise. 
Gratitude is a transitory phenomenon, however, and Hanoi's 
post-war goals will shape its future relations with both Moscow 
and Peking. These initial objectives include the rebuilding and 
development of a war-damaged economy, the reunification of north 
and south, Hanoi's projection of its leadership in Indo-China, and 
the establishment of Vietnam's legitimacy in the diplomatic arena. 
Reconstruction and reunification are Hanoi's priority goals and 
will absorb most of the country's energies and resources. These 
priorities do not preclude an active foreign policy, although this 
preoccupation should influence its tactics. Buoyed by the euphoria 
of victory and a sense of momentum Hanoi clearly is in a mood to 
amplify its influence. This mood need not manifest itself in

military action, but should -- for the next two or three years at 
least -- be projected in political and economic terms. Indications 
are still tentative. The rapidity of the south's collapse took 
Hanoi by surprise, and undoubtedly there is still some debate and 
groping going on in the leadership councils. 
REUNIFICATION  
Although reunification is the primary goal of the North 
Vietnamese leadership, it probably will not be pursued precipitously. 
The PRG is emerging as a separate administration in the south that 
will have separate diplomatic status and representation in inter-
national bodies and may hold "elections" to legitimize the communist 
take-over. But there is no question that this political division 
is an artificial one that offers little opportunity for the de-
velopment of separatist tendencies in the south. The leaders are 
closely tied to the Hanoi regime. Politburo member Pham Hung, 
formerly chief of COSVN, has surfaced as the secretary of the 
southern party and the man who clearly is in charge. Moreover, 
the components of the southern administrative apparatus are re-
portedly being staffed by personnel from North Vietnamese ministries, 
and NVA troops are still present. This does not rule out occasional 
manifestations of regional prejudice and personal pique on the 
part of southern cadre, but Hanoi's control is too firmly entrenched 
to permit any serious maneuvering for greater independence. In 
any event the country's reunification was a goal long embraced

by Vietnamese on both sides of the DMZ; even the GVN emotionally 
rejected the notion of permanent partition. 
Hanoi would be sensitive to any efforts to encourage separatism 
in the south, though it is difficult to see where such encourage-
ment would come from. DRV officials have expressed suspicions, in 
months past, that the PRC was not anxious to see a united Vietnam, 
but such remarks seemed to reflect Hanoi's pique at China's apparent 
lack of enthusiasm for a renewed offensive. Nonetheless, as the 
chances for such tendencies to take root could increase the longer 
the two areas remain apart, reunification will probably be delayed 
no longer than two or three years. 
In the meantime, there are political and practical reasons 
for continuing the pretense of an independent southern regime. 
It is consistent with past communist claims and supports the legiti-
macy of the new rulers as rising from a local struggle rather than 
invasion from the north. Unification of two areas with such different 
social and economic structures will present serious problems. The 
relative prosperity of the south and its consumer-oriented and 
capitalist economy will not easily blend with the subsistence and 
socialist economy of the north and could aggrevate discontent in 
the north. Melding the two systems will not be easy, and in view 
of the disastrous effects of harsh land reform efforts in North 
Vietnam, the communist leadership may decide that a more gradual 
approach will lessen the chances of political disruptions. Political

control must be consolidated as well. Some resistance is apparently 
continuing -- how much trouble the communists will have with the 
Catholics and other religious sects, such as the Hoa Hao and Cao 
Dai -- is a questionable factor. As there are no national leaders 
of any status who could organize an effective resistance, political 
consolidation should not take long, but could be delayed if the 
communists decide to work more slowly through accommodation to more 
gradual stringent control in those areas where traditional anti-
communism has been strong. 
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT  
Reconstruction in North Vietnam was well underway before the 
war's end and should see the total recovery of the primary capital 
base of the economy (a very small base) by the end of 1975 or soon 
thereafter. While North Vietnam's leaders are preaching self-sufficiency, 
it is clear that they will require substantial development assistance 
for some time to come. The south's agricultural potential may 
eventually make Vietnam self-sufficient in food staples, but problems 
of distribution and reorganization pending the integration of the 
two economies will delay that day. In the meantime, the food 
deficit in the north, and Hanoi's desire to develop a modern economy 
and raise the standard of living of its population will demand 
continuing commodity and project assistance. 
The DRV's efforts to expand its economic contacts with the 
non-communist world began a year or so ago and are now accelerating.

This is partly a reflection of Hanoi's determination to reduce its 
dependence on the Soviet Union and China, and partly a desire to 
reap the benefits of the technical superiority found in Europe and 
Japan. Regardless of its economic needs, one should not expect 
Hanoi to rush pell-mell into the commercial arms of the West. 
Hanoi's approaches up to now have been very hard-nosed and the 
very primitive state of the DRV's industrial base will impose 
restraints on the amount and type of technology imported. More-
over, the DRV suffers from a severe shortage of capital and foreign 
exchange and undoubtedly would be reluctant to get into the heavy 
debt that normal commercial loans would involve. This need for 
loans on very soft terms will limit non-communist involvement, 
and force Hanoi to rely on the communist nations as principal 
suppliers of capital investments. 
As long as that dependence continues Hanoi will be strongly 
motivated to maintain the balanced relationship so skillfully ex-
ploited throughout the war. Soviet efforts to woo the DRV leadership 
into the Soviet camp with generous amounts of aid will probably 
fail despite manifestations of Vietnamese hostility toward the 
Chinese. China provides generous assistance -- slightly over half 
of the north's petroleum and food imports are provided by the 
PRC -- and while a decline in its aid might be offset by additional 
Soviet assistance, such a tilt would diminish the independence 
Hanoi so cherishes.

IIP 
PRIMACY IN INDO-CHINA  
The DRV leaders have long seen themselves as the natural and 
legitimate heirs to the former French Indo-Chinese empire. Their 
sentiments are reinforced by centuries of historical contention with 
the Thai (and Khmer) over the Lao and Khmer buffer zones between 
Vietnam and Thailand. The old Indo-Chinese Communist Party was the 
breeding ground of the independence movements in Laos and Cambodia; 
the Vietnamese cadre inspired, trained and often directed the de-
veloping parties next door. Although the liberation of the south 
had clear priority, the insurgencies in Laos and Cambodia were seen 
as integral parts of a whole concept -- the parts moving in different 
sequence but the finale encompassing a Communist Indo-China guided 
by the Lao Dong Party. 
Hanoi's goals in the area have had to undergo a certain refine-
ment. It is clear that the relationship between Vietnam and its 
Indo-Chinese neighbors must adjust to the strains of old ethnic 
animosities and to the political dynamics of the local situations. 
Yet the minimum requirements of Hanoi's interests -- friendly powers 
who defer to her basic foreign policy positions, buffers against 
external threats from a historically unfriendly direction and the 
exclusion of greater influence by any other foreign power -- should 
be largely satisfied, though in Cambodia s case, not entirely. It 
is clear, however, that Hanoi's once fond dream of controlling 
an Indo-China federation is dead for the forseeable future.

Cambodia presents the most, ambiguous situation ? one where 
Hanoi's equity has been significantly called into question by the 
independent-minded Khmer-communist leaders and where opportunity 
for competition with Hanoi's influence more readily presents itself. 
The North Vietnamese have probably realized for some time that 
their ability to control the Khmer communist movement would be 
doubtful. Strong ethnic animosity* provoked tension and conflict 
between Khmer and Vietnamese forces from the start and only abated 
when NVA forces withdrew to traditional border enclaves. 
Since their victory, the Khmer communists have adamantly 
asserted a particularly xenophobic independence, a clear determina-
tion to call the shots in Cambodia without outside interference, 
including Hanoi's. The Cambodians are not turning to total isola-
tion and recognize the need for some assistance in operating and 
developing the primitive industrial plant of the country, a realization 
indicated by the early arrival of Chinese technicians following 
the communist seizure of Phnom Penh. It is this very need that 
undermines Hanoi's leverage. The North Vietnamese would be hard-
pressed to provide Cambodia with the assistance it requires, and 
with the port of Kompong Som (Sihanoukville) now available to the 
* The Khmer empire once held sway over much of present-day South 
Vietnam and was pushed beck by Vietnamese expansion southward. 
Khmer memories of past glory are not dead, while the racially-
conscious Vietnamese, for their part, look down on the darker-
skinned Cambodians as a more primitive people.

Cambodian communists, the DRV will no longer be the sole conduit 
for foreign aid. 
The Vietnamese appear to recognize and accept the Khmers' 
nationalist sensitivities, a tolerance reflected in their frequent 
references to Cambodia's "territorial integrity." Hanoi's attempts 
to avoid a confrontation were reflected in its agreements to Khmer 
demands for the withdrawal of the residual NVA forces in Cambodia. 
But in view of the disputed territorial claims along their common 
border (already provoking an occasional armed clash) and among 
the off-shore islands, their patience with the Cambodians will 
be sorely tried over the next few years. 
Hanoi's careful cordiality has met with some reciprocation 
from the Khmer leaders. Khieu Samphan, a key leader and primary 
spokesman for the Cambodian communists, is the head of the recently 
formed Cambodian-Vietnamese Friendship Association, a role that seems 
to indicate his desire to keep any fraternal squabbles within care-
ful limits. But it is clear that Hanoi will have to compete with 
China for influence with the Khmer leadership. Regardless of 
whether or not Sihanouk returns, the FRC has developed entree 
with the Khmer leaders, who recognize China's usefulness as a 
counterweight against Vietnamese pressure, and who undoubtedly 
will try to play the two off against each other -- much in the 
manner that Hanoi successfully used with its supporters.

The situation in Laos is quickly shifting to one in which 
the communists will exercise control. While the edifice of coali-
tion government may be preserved, Souvanna Phouma's desire to see 
the country unified, plus the impact of communist victories in 
South Vietnam and Cambodia on both Pathet Lao ambitions and the 
rightists' will to resist is rapidly shifting control into the 
hands of the Pathet Lao. 
The North Vietnamese have a close relationship with the 
Pathet Lao leadership that appears to override any stirrings of 
nationalist independence in the manner of the Cambodians. While 
the party aristocrats such as Souphanavong and Phoumi Vongvichit, 
might have the strong sense of nationalism Souvanna Phouma believed 
might ease them away. from Hanoi's domination those leaders who 
appear to exercise the real power, such as Kaysone and Nouhak, 
have had careers even more closely entwined with the 'Vietnamese 
communist movement. Moreover, the Pathet Lao's dependence on 
Hanoi throughout the war was overwhelming. The communist vic-
tories were won by Vietnamese forces; Vietnamese advisors (and 
troops) were present with Pathet Lao forces throughout the country; 
and Pathet Lao leaders traveled frequently to Hanoi for consul-
tations. 
Hanoi's primacy seems unchallenged. The PBC has maintained 
close relations with the Lao communists, but Chinese interests 
have not conflicted with Hanoi's prerogatives. Peking appears to

have acknowledged the Pathet Lao as primarily a Vietnamese client, 
while Hanoi has accepted China's special interest in the northern 
? 
border area along her frontier. From all appearances, their rela-
tionship in Laos has been cooperative and not competitive. Chinese 
attempts to undermine Hanoi's position woad cauie imm6aiate friction, 
but such a development seems unlikely in view of the basic mutuality 
of their interests there.? a buffer zone along their borders, a 
corridor to Thailand. 
Moscow's relations With the Pathet Lao have been less close 
and its interests in Laos less pressing than China's. Soviet 
political support has been more notable for the preservation of 
the coalition in Laos than for Pathet Lao domination. The recent 
visit by a Soviet delegation to PL headquarters at Sam Neua was 
the first such occasion in five years, but despite Moscow's sudden 
solicitousness toward the Lao communists, Soviet influence is 
too remote to be very effective. Aggressive Soviet efforts to 
ingratiate themselves with.the Pathet Lao would be an irritant 
in their relations with Hanoi, but only a mild one. 
The rapid communist take-over in Laos raises the question 
of its future posture toward the outside world a posture that 
should be influenced by Hanoi's advice. Will a communist Laos 
close itself off from all but its socialist allies and emphasize 
self-reliance a la Cambodian style, or will it follow Hanoi's 
lead in opting for broader contacts? The instincts of the leaders

in the caves at Sam Neua are undoubtedly far more hostile than 
the urbane sophistication of their Vientiane representatives 
suggests, so a turning-inward cannot be dismissed. Once the last 
vestiges of American influence (such as USAID) are expelled how-
ever, Hanoi's example should encourage the Lao leaders to maintain 
the border diplomatic contacts that at least some of the Lao leaders 
seem to prefer. 
VIETNAM AS A REGIONAL POWER 
The DRV is moving quickly to establish its legitimacy and 
influence in the region. Although the current dispute over the 
military aircraft flown out of South Vietnam may delay the exten-
sion of diplomatic relations, Hanoi has indicated its desire to 
formalize ties with those ASEAN nations who have not already done 
so -- the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. In Thailand's 
case the former stumbling block of the US bases may have been 
resolved by the scheduled departure of US forces, although there 
were earlier signs that Hanoi might have been willing to accept -2 
their continuing presence. The North Vietnamese were never as 
sensitive about the bases in the Philippines and are unlikely to 
make their removal a prerequisite to establishing formal rela-
tions. 
It is clear that the departure of the US military presence 
from the region is a long-range Vietnamese goal. The theme of. 
a neutral Southeast Asia has already been advanced and no doubt

will be emphasized in Vietnam's regional politicking. Hanoi appears 
to envision a situation in which no one great power would have 
dominant influence in the area and thus all could be more readily 
played off and exploited by a regional coalition led by Hanoi. 
For at least the next year or so, however, the preoccupations of 
their tasks at home -- and ASEAN caution -- is going to. limitthe 
projection of Vietnamese influence. 
Thailand is clearly a special case. Both its geographic 
proximity and long history of contention with the Vietnamese in-
creases the potential for future conflict. The communist take-over 
in Laos virtually eliminates any remaining difficulties in providing 
logistical support for the insurgency in Thailand's northeast.* 
Moreover, there is a strong revolutionary fervor in the Vietnamese 
leadership which has undoubtedly been stimulated by the successful 
conclusion of the war after such prolonged frustrations. With 
the momentum of events in their favor, there must be some tempta-
tion to take advantage of the mood of uncertainty among their 
neighbors. Communist broadcasts and articles are replete with 
revolutionary rhetoric that speaks of the revolution in world 
* The communist insurgency in Thailand is active in three separate 
areas -- a rather feckless and poorly supported campaign in the 
south, one in the north that is supported by the Chinese, and one 
in the northeast, which has been assisted by the Chinese and North 
Vietnamese. All three operations come under the central guidance 
of the Communist Party of Thailand, a fact demonstrated in the 
occasional shift of personnel from one area to another.

terms and of the "changing conditions" that now encourage its 
growth -- arguments that are inconsistent with the non-belligerent 
tones of restraint and reasonableness evoked by WV officials 
to recent visitors. 
Such euphoria is only natural, however, and probably re-
flects little more than the "high" of victory, and not near-term 
policies under serious consideration. For a number of reasons, 
Hanoi is not likely to significantly stir up the Thai insurgency: 
the insurgency's inherent weaknesses, Hanoi's limited influence, 
and political expediency. At present, the insurgency is too weak 
to challenge the government's forces. In the northeast, its political 
base is largely restricted to isolated villages along the Lao 
border, where communist influence is less a product of popular 
support than of communist terrorism and government neglect. 
Bangkok dismisses the insurgency as involving only minority 
groups (the people of the northeast are considered country bump-
kins more akin to the Lao than to "real" Thai) along the borders 
and makes only a half-hearted effort to? suppress it, but if the 
government was provoked into taking more determined action, it 
could easily wreak havoc on the weak insurgent structure. It 
mould be inconsistent with communist guerrilla warfare doctrine 
to risk serious confrontation while the insurgent structure is 
still so fragile.

Moreover, the present nature of the insurgency imposes certain 
restraints on its growth that simply expanding material support 
would not overcome. The insurgency lacks strong political appeal 
and there are not yet the serious internal problems in Thailand 
that might generate broader support for armed insurrection. The 
communists' bid for broader appeal had been further undermined 
by the collapse of their two major propaganda issues -- the mili-
tary regime and the presence of US forces. Therefore, under 
current political conditions in Thailand the insurgency has little 
chance of developing into a serious threat. Hanoi's recognition 
of the insurgency's limitations is reflected in the scant atten-
tion it receives in North Vietnamese propaganda, in contrast with 
the coverage given Thailand's urban disorders. Hanoi obviously 
sees these as more influential in Thai politics and could see 
more useful opportunities in encouraging urban political organiza-
tions. 
Hanoi's options are further restrained by its limited 
influence over the insurgency. Even in the northeast, Hanoi can-
not ignore China's preferences, which currently favor the development 
of normal diplomatic relations with Thailand. The Thai Communist 
Party (CPT) is not anyone's toady, but its long relationship with 
the Chinese party, reinforced by the Chinese ethnic background of 
most of the CPT leaders, suggests that it would not adopt a policy 
strongly at odds with Chinese wishes.

IIP 
In any event, the Thai government's reaction to a serious 
flareup of insurgent activity would probably redound against Hanoi's 
minimum policy objectives in Thailand -- the recognition of the 
DRV's (and PRG's) legitimacy and removal of any threat to Vietnamese 
security. The present regime in Bangkok is anxious to normalize 
relations with the Vietnamese and willing to pull away from what 
it now perceives as a useless military partnership w;th the US; 
but that regime's position is a fragile one. Hanoi's adoption of 
a more aggressive policy could contribute to the regime's demise 
and the return of a military government more cautious in dealing 
with Hanoi and more anxious to preserve close ties with the 
Americans. 
Hanoi has not raised the spectre of insurgent threat to 
the Thai. On the contrary, in the exchange of letters exploring 
the approaches to formal relations, the DRV government made an 
unprecedented acknowledgment of Thai apprehensions and offered 
assurances (albeit obliquely) that they would not interfere with 
Thailand's internal affairs. While these assurances were couched 
in terms that linked them with Hanoi's own unhappiness with the 
US forces in Thailand, Hanoi's willingness to discuss the return 
of the local Vietnamese community (largely refugees who left 
Vietnam in the 1950s) -- another area of concern to the Thai 
government -- is a further indication of the give-and-take it is 
prepared to engage in to improve relations.

At the same time, the North Vietnamese will not completely 
abandon their support of the insurgents. The level of support may 
be a gauge of their frustration with state-to-state relations. 
Should the circumstances change -- should a coup return a more 
rigid and uncompromising regime to Bangkok or serious civil unrest 
unglue the harmony of Thai society and lower its resistance to 
communist influence -- Hanoi might find the insurgency a more 
attractive option to support. Even then, the underlying national-
ism of the Thai communists would diminish their usefulness as a 
vehicle of Vietnamese pressure. 
In Sum.... 
The Vietnamese communists face prodigious tasks at home in 
overcoming the damage and divisions of thirty years of war. While 
these tasks will not preclude an active foreign policy, they should 
absorb most of Hanoi's attention and resources for the next two or 
three years and blunt any expansionist tendencies the Vietnamese 
might harbor. Their continuing need for foreign economic assistance, 
their guest for broader diplomatic and economic contacts, and at 
least tentative indications of a desire to establish Vietnam's 
position as a legitimate member of the regional community argue 
for a period of non-belligerent behavior. The euphoria of victory 
will no doubt express itself in other ways ? a demanding tone in 
Hanoi's diplomatic approaches a stubborn, uncompromising posture

when it feels its national interests or claims (e.g., the offshore

tones of revolutionary fervor may provoke occasional tensions and 
acrimony, but for now, Hanoi appears to be taking a generally 
softer approach in its foreign policies.

PEKING'S POLICY IN POSTWAR INDO-CHINA 
PEKING'S GOALS AND ASSETS IN POST-WAR INDO-CHINA  
Peking's goals in Indo-China are to assert Chinese influence 
without losing ground, to keep to a minimum the Soviet presence 
there, and to prevent Hanoi from dominating the area. The Chinese 
must now work toward these goals in a situation in which the US 
is a diminishing enemy and thus in which China's strategic deterrent 
role is no longer its principal asset. 
The Chinese have new opportunities. They can now enhance 
their influence with the Cambodian communists by supporting their 
anti-Soviet and anti-North Vietnamese policy, while not openly 
contending with Hanoi. They can further enhance their influence 
with the Pathet Lao, and they may calculate that these communists 
will be, as the Cambodians already appear to be, competitors with 
if not opponents of the North Vietnamese. 
However, this very independence of mind which the Chinese 
already are exploiting is hazardous to Peking's policy in the 
area. The Chinese must now adjust to Phnom Penh's actions and 
needs, and this adjustment will require that they take a more 
explicitly anti-US position on certain issues, thus cutting 
across Peking's policy of rapprochement with the US. The Chinese 
may also be impelled to take a harder line toward Thailand if

Phnom Penh does so. Thus the Chinese are confronted with the 
painful situation -- at least potentially -- of the tail wagging

A. Chinese Influence 
In trying to assert their influence without losing ground 
to Hanoi or Moscow, the Chinese start with assets. 
first with aid 
and they have attained the first diplomatic presence in Phnom 
Penh; they have a considerable presence in Laos; and they have 
fairly stable ties with North Vietnam, and have given a high level 
of aid to Hanoi, although there are tensions.* However, the 
Chinese will have a problem restraining themselves -- of refraining 
from throwing their weight around in Indo-China as a big power. 
The Chinese have for centuries believed, and the Chinese 
leaders apparently believe today, that China's size and power, as 
well as superior culture, provide it with the right to assert 
strong political influence in Indo-China. This is precisely the 
great-power attitude which Mao has openly denounced in others, 
but which in fact is at the very core of Chinese behavior in the

* Peking has shown distinct degrees of warmth in its relations 
with the Indo-Chinese parties: warmest with the Pathet Lao, 
somewhat less so with the Cambodian communists, and correct but 
cool with the Vietnamese. This range of attitudes partly derives 
from the Chinese perception of how close these parties are to 
the Soviet party.

area. A clear expression of this was Peking's unsolicited advice 
on the strategy for running the war against South Vietnam, at first 
counseling the North Vietnamese to avoid negotiations and fight a 
protracted war (1965-71) and then applying pressure on the North 
Vietnamese to hasten along with negotiations and to compromise 
in order to attain a cease-fire (1972-73). Another clear expression 
of this great-power attitude was Peking's unilateral seizure of 
the Paracel Islands in January 1974, despite Chinese knowledge 
that the islands were claimed by the Vietnamese communists. The 
antagonism it aroused in Hanoi points to the larger problem of 
whether the Chinese will be willing to restrain themselves in 
post-war Indo-China. 
This great-power assumption of a right to predominant in-
fluence over China's small neighbors is as important as the very 
practical concern with securing China's southern borders, and 
? more important than the ideological commitment to advance rural 
revolution in Asia. The US presence in Indo-China had challenged 
the Chinese presumption to local superiority, and as that presence 
has receded, the independence of mind of the communist leaders 
in Hanoi, Phnom Penh, and Sam Neua has become correspondingly a 
more significant prospective barrier to Chinese dominance. Al-
though Peking's help was highly important in the accession to 
power of all three regimes in Indo-China, they probably will 
prove to be no more grateful for Peking's early support than Mao

himself has felt grateful for Moscow's post-1949 support, and will, 
like the Chinese, be unsubmissive on important matters of policy.* 
Should the Chinese leaders therefore, try to dictate a grand 
strategy for Indo-China, or dispute territory, or interfere in 
internal party affairs, the reaction from the new regimes will 
undoubtedly be vigorously anti-Peking. 
Hanoi's anger over the Chinese seizure of the Paracels and 
Hanoi's action of seizing six Chinese-claimed islands in the 
Spratleys in mid-April 1975, undoubtedly heightened Chinese aware-
ness of the potential for contention with the new regimes. The 
Chinese now seem to be trying to exercise restraint, hoping to 
avoid antagonizing the three Indo-Chinese parties, while extending 
political support and material aid to all three. However, there 
is in any case likely to be considerable tension (already evident 
in Peking's relations with Hanoi) in the Chinese handling of the 
ties between the new regimes and Moscow, especially if Phnom Penh 
changes its strongly anti-Soviet policy.

might lead to a Sino-American clash (conventional or nuclear) while 
supporting North Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, and Cambodian communist 
military actions -- has been displaced by anxiety lest the Soviets 
now obtain enhanced opportunities to "encircle" China, politically 
and with bases in nearby countries. The Chinese will work to 
prevent this, primarily by positing themselves to be the principal 
suppliers and political champions of the new regimes. 
The Chinese are gratified at the initial advantage they 
have attained over the Soviets in dealings with the new regimes 
in Cambodia and Laos. A primary Chinese goal will be to keep 
Cambodia -- and a communist-dominated administration in Laos --
deterred from eventually adopting the same policy as Hanoi, that 
of balancing one major. power (the USSR) off against the other 
(China). They have already indicated that they are aware that 
the Soviet alternative provides the new regimes with some poten-
tial leverage over Peking's policy, but they insist that such a 
potential will not hmpel changes in PRC policy. Actually, the 
capability of the Chinese to prevent such balancing action may 
decrease as post-war economic needs gradually replace the earlier, 
more urgent military needs. ? 
Globally, the Chinese will try to minimize the impact of 
the events in Indo-China on the role the US plays as counterweight 
to the USSR in the Sino-Soviet-US strategic triangle. While

long-standing line on "armed struggle" as the only road to power 
(itself an anti-Soviet position in the Sino-Soviet dispute), in 
private talks with visiting foreign leaders the Chinese have not 
only avoided crowing over the US defeat but also have insisted 
that the US, released from its Vietnam burden, can play a more 
positive role in the Pacific area. Although the Chines stric-
tures against "hegemony" apply ultimately to the US as well as 
the USSR, the view of the US as a counterweight to the USSR motivates 
the Chinese to advocate strong US support for Japan, including 
maintenance of bases there.* The Chinese leaders' attitude on 
the desirability of US bases in Thailand and the Philippines in 
the post-war era is less clear and may still be under considera-
tion. In any case, the Chinese leaders almost certainly will 
continue to calculate that the US is still the most important 
country confronting the Soviets globally, and that they must try 
to manipulate this confrontation to their advantage.

the Chinese unable to get the upper hand. North Vietnam continues 
to place orders for a wide range of industrial products and other 
equipment with the USSR and its East European allies. The Chinese 
will have to accept this situation in the south as well, and they 
undoubtedly were infuriated with the Vietnamese communists for 
permitting (if not encouraging) the Soviet Union to precede China 
in sending ships carrying grain to "liberated" Danang. However, 
the Chinese have proven to be prudent, focusing on the Soviet 
issue, and will probably avoid 2mly. attacking Hanoi on issues 
in dispute. 
C. The Contest with Hanoi 
Beyond the competition with the Soviets (expressed mainly 
in economic terms), a competition for favor with the new regimes 
will be launched against Hanoi (mainly in political terms). The 
Chinese, who earlier had professed to desire the advent of "a great 
unity of the three Indo-Chinese parties," probably see considerable 
advantage in disputes among these parties. Internecine disputes 
are likely to impel these parties to Seek Peking's support -- a 
situation which would increase Chinese influence in the area and 
decrease Hanoi's capability to dominate the area. 
It is clear to Peking that the emergence of the independent 
Cambodian communist regime is creating problems for Hanoi. That 
this would be true has been evident since 1972 when Cambodian 
forces proved willing to engage North Vietnamese units in eastern

Cambodia in bloody battles, on the issue of which troops were to 
occupy which areas. Moreover, Cambodian forces have recently 
seized at least one probable petroleum-bearing island in the Gulf 
of Thailand which had been coveted by the Vietnamese. The Chinese, 
if appealed to by the Cambodians, might profess to desire a com-
promise but, in fact, refrain from actively seeking a solution, 
calculating that the irascible Cambodians would tie up the Viet-
namese in a long, bitter, inter-party struggle. Such a struggle 
would tend to reduce Hanoi's pressure on Peking to return the 
PRC-seized Paracels. Thus one of Peking's major goals -- namely 
- 
to keep Hanoi from dominating Indo-China -- is further advanced 
to the degree that such disputes remain, or new ones arise, between 
the Cambodians and the North Vietnamese. 
In Laos, the Chinese apparently do not have a comparable 
opportunity to gain advantage over the North Vietnamese, inasmuch 
as the Pathet Lao still seem to accept Hanoi's advice if not 
control, and to avoid disputes with Hanoi over territory. On 
the other hand, the Chinese may seek to take advantage of their 
geographic proximity -- and possibly to retain some part of their 
presence in northern Laos -- to offer the Laotian communists a 
counterweight to Hanoi. 
In Hanoi itself, although the main levers of Chinese in-
fluence probably will continue to be material aid and political 
support, the Chinese almost certainly will be alert to groups or

individuals in Vietnam as potential instruments of Chinese influence. 
They undoubtedly recognize that 
the key figures holding real power behind the scenes of the new 
government in South Vietnam are, in fact, high-level Lao Doing 
Party officials who are loyal to the leadership in Hanoi. Never-
theless, they may believe that policy differences exist over whether 
and/or when to discard the facade of a separate, independent, and 
neutral government and carry out "unification." Despite the fact 
that the south is under the control of North Vietnamese party 
and army officials -- and in that respect, unified -- the Chinese 
apparently believe that separate policies applied in the south 
will provide them with leeway to maneuver. The Chinese presumably 
would support those Lao Dong Party leaders who prefer to delay 
"unification" indefinitely. 
In sum, Peking has a good chance of successfully assisting 
the most anti-Vietnamese force -- the Cambodians -- in a joint 
effort to keep Hanoi from dominating Cambodia. The Chinese 
apparently would have preferred the coalition in Laos to remain 
composed of more neutralist, non-communist leaders than it now is, 
but they are still in a good position to prevent Hanoi's total

themselves into a warm Hanoi-Peking relationship, but will probably 
avoid a public dispute with the North Vietnamese, as this would 
assist Moscow toward an even better relationship with the Lao Dong 
Party leadership than it now has. 
PEKING AND THAILAND: DIPLOMACY AND INSURGENCY SUPPORT 
Peking's policy toward Thailand seems to be similar to its 
policy toward Burma, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia --
namely, a dual policy of (a) diplomacy on one level and (b) support 
for Maoist armed insurgents in these countries on another level. 
Mao personally reaffirmed that policy 
in 1974, as did Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua in late April 1975 
when he told British journalists that China will continue to "support" 
revolution abroad. It is precisely that "support" and North Vietnamese 
assistance that has provided the communist insurgents in north and 
northeast Thailand with a sufficient amount of professional military 
training and modern weapons to sustain their anti-government guerrilla 
activities. There is no indication that the Chinese will cease their 
political support, which is mainly in the 'form: of inspirational 
broadcasts beamed to the insurgents 
Regarding material aid, there is evidence that the 
Chinese (as well as the North Vietnamese) continue to train Thai 
communist insurgents.

The Chinese will have to make a decision in the near future 
on whether to step up their support of the Thai insurgents with 
major inputs of weapons (and even advisers and combat cadres, as 
they have done in Burma) to make the communist insurgency in the 
northeast viable. Thus far, there is no evidence that such a 
decision has been made. They seem to be content to rock along 
with the insurgency at a low boil, while encouraging the Thais to 
take the final diplomatip step -- breaking ties with Taiwan and 
recognizing Peking. 
More important than all other considerations is Peking's 
apparent reluctance to have tension increase in Thailand at a 
time when the Chinese desire a concession from the US regarding 
Taiwan. The Chinese undoubtedly calculate that a significant 
increase of their inputs into the insurgency would be apparent 
to the US and would be held against them. They are worried that 
the events in Indo-China already may have made it more difficult 
for the US Administration to make a concession on the Taiwan 
issue. Peking has hinted that it is not prepared to go beyond 
low-level support for the Thai insurgents in the near future. 
Moreover, it is unlikely that competition with North Vietnam 
for influence in the Thai party leadership will impel Peking to 
greatly increase its inputs. The Chinese have had the inside 
track with the Thai party leadership ever since the Communist 
Party of Thailand was organized and staffed with Chinese and

Sino-)Thai cadres, and Peking probably still has the dominant posi-
tion. 
It is probable that following the establishment of diplomatic 
relations with Bangkok, Peking will suggest to the Thai government 
that it legalize the party. However, such a suggestion would be 
intended primarily as a counter to prospective Thai government 
requests that the Chinese cease supporting the insurgents ? a 
counter that Mao himself adopted to deflect the request of Malaysia's 
Prime Minister that Mao cease supporting the illegal communist in-
surgents in Malaysia. 
In sum, low-level support for the Thai insurgents probably 
will continue and the Chinese probably 
will keep encouraging the Thai communists to fight on, but greatly 
increased inputs are unlikely to be sent in from China in the near 
future. 
PROSPECTS  
The Chinese have the determination, and some of the assets, 
to play a major role in Indo-China ? mainly, Offering support 
to the new regime in .Cambodia and the communist-dominated coalition 
in Laos. In Vietnam however, tensions with the leadership in Hanoi 
have reduced the advantage the Chinese previously had (from 1960--
1972) in competition with the Soviets. But they have not given 
up on the North Vietnamese: they will try to keep their various 
disputes in private channels, and will continue to provide Hanoi 
with material aid and political support.

The Chinese are aware that China's ability to be the counter-
weight to Soviet influence is still important to the Vietnamese. 
China's role as a counterweight, however, will not be sufficiently 
important to provide Peking with a veto over Hanoi's foreign policy 
decisions. The factor of a Chinese counterweight is not important 
in the thinking of the Cambodians, as there is no Soviet presence 
in Cambodia, the Cambodians are furious with Moscow for failing 
to support them, and they will probably remain anti-Soviet for 
some time to come. 
Beyond this, the Chinese may be able to play some role as 
"honest broker" in internecine disputes among the Indo-China parties.. 
In addition, they may choose -- with uncertain chances of success --
to counsel restraint to the Cambodians on specific issues: for 
example, whether to attack the Thai border forces on the issue of 
Cambodian-claimed territory and whether to continue to hold foreigners 
(including crew members of seized foreign ships). 
? 
The principal concern for the Chinese in the near future will 
be to keep the Soviet presence in Indo-China down to a minimum.*

North Vietnamese sanction) decide to allow the Soviets to come into

their countries with technicians and aid in big numbers and amounts, 
the Chinese undoubtedly would try to effect a reversal of this 
policy; failing that, the Chinese would harden their attitude 
toward these regimes. Thus the Chinese will be constantly active 
and alert, monitoring the Soviet-related actions of the Indo-
Chinese parties, clearly unwilling to be passive in the Sino-Soviet 
competition for influence. 
The Chinese seem toiprefer that the Thai insurgency remain 
at a low boil. They apparently calculate that Hanoi's perception 
is roughly the same as their own, and that Phnom Penh (dependent 
on the Chinese and Vietnamese) will not have the material equipment 
to keep supplying the Thai insurgents even if the Cambodians were 
willing to intervene to step up the insurgency. Major inputs of 
personnel and material would be required, on something like the 
scale of the North Vietnamese inputs in Laos and Cambodia, to 
make the insurgency a genuine threat to the central government. 
The main Chinese goal in Thailand for the near future is to gain 
recognition of the PRC from Bangkok and to avoid tension-building 
which might worry the US Administration. ',Although the Chinese 
do not appear to be pressing Bangkok to remove US bases from 
Thailand, they may come to feel that it is necessary to do so, 
while desiring the continuation of an American diplomatic presence 
to offset any Soviet presence in Bangkok.

Somewhat farther down the road, they probably will aim at 
obtaining a left-leaning Thai government, which would profess to 
be "nonaligned and neutral," but which in fact would adopt all 
major Chinese foreign policy positions. Such a future Thai regime 
would have the advantage of not appearing to be a Chinese puppet, 
but of resembling Cambodia under Sihanouk's earlier non-communist 
but pro-Peking government, with which the Chinese were content. 
The advent of such a regime would probably provide the Chinese 
with a better chance to keep the Russians out than would be the 
case with a communist Thailand.

Moscow proved willing to back French communist support of French 
claims to sovereignty over Indo-China in 1946-47 (to bolster the 
PCF's struggle for power in post-war France), to endorse a peace 
settlement in 1954 which "robbed" Hanoi of the fruits of military 
victory (to support Moscow's first efforts at detente with the 
West), and to entertain President Nixon in the aftermath of the 
mining of Haiphong harbor in 1972 (to protect the budding detente 
with the United States). 
The USSR's objectives in Indo-China are essentially negative: 
to deny influence to its great power rivals, the US and China. 
The victory of Moscow's Vietnamese ally has meant some share of

reflected glory as well as -- at least temporarily -- excluding 
the United States from the competition for influence in Indo-China. 
At the same time, Moscow has been visibly relieved that the 
wax is at an end. Its value as a means of allowing Moscow to demon-
strate its "revolutionary" credentials had been reduced by the 
real and potential dangers it posed for US-Soviet detente. As 
long as it continued, Moscow could not rid itself of residual 
anxiety that events in Indo-China might somehow move in a direc-
tion which would threaten the fragile relationship with Washington. 
Now that the Indo-China war has ended in defeat for the US-backed 
regimes in Saigon and Phnom Penh, the Soviets are concerned at 
the possibility of an American backlash. Soviet leaders and dip-
lomats have taken care to avoid publicly gloating or associating 
the US with the debacle of the anti-communist forces and have 
privately disclaimed responsibility for or prior knowledge of the 
final offensives of the communist forces. 
Unease at the possible American reaction is more than matched 
by Moscow's uncertainty at the implications that the installation 
of communist regimes in Saigon and Phnom Penh and the rapid erosion 
of the political balance in Laos will have for the course of its 
bitter rivalry with China. Although the regional rivalry between 
the United States and the USSR has been more visible, it is China 
that has been most crucial to attracting Soviet attention to Indo-
China. Indeed Moscow's direct involvement in the Indo-Chinese

conflict as a major arms supplier followed on the heels of its 
quarrel with Peking, and must be seen as a Soviet effort to bid 
for the loyalties of Hanoi and to rebuff the Chinese challenge 
to Moscow's position as the preeminent center of communism. This 
challenge was fueled largely by Peking's charges that Moscow has 
sold out the cause of revolution for the sake of detente with 
imperialism. 
GOALS AND POLICIES 
A. Vietnam 
The USSR's first priority will be to preveht the extension 
of Chinese influence in the area. Yet the Soviets are also likely 
to want to see conflict and instability in the area kept below a 
level which could burden their broader interests. 
Soviet efforts to counter China will center on Hanoi. Moscow 
will seek to limit the degree of intimacy between Hanoi and Peking 
and to back the DRV as a local barrier to the expansion of Chinese 
influence. The Soviets have already given clear evidence of their 
intentions.

NMV 
The Soviets have significant advantages over Peking in any 
competition for influence in Hanoi, beginning with a somewhat better 
bilateral relationship with the Vietnamese. Although both China 
and the USSR aided North Vietnam greatly in its war effort, Soviet 
help was probably more crucial and recognized as such by them. 
Moreover, the occasionally erratic Chinese policy line dissipated 
much of the profit China might have extracted from its aid to the 
Vietnamese. The North Vietnamese 
found 
they could rely on Soviet assistance, whereas they could never be 
entirely sure of Chinese support. 
Equally important in buttressing the Soviet position in 
Hanoi is the long history of animosity and suspicion between the 
Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. These attitudes are kept alive 
by simmering territorial disputes, the most important of which 
are those over the Paracel and Spratley island groups in the South 
China Sea. The Soviets have weighed in on the side of the Viet-
namese on both questions. Soviet propaganda has belabored as an 
act of "imperialism" the Chinese occupation of the Paracels in 
January 1974, and the Soviets were quick to echo Hanoi's announce-
ment of the "liberation" of the Spratleys earlier this month. 
Moscow will do its best to keep the territorial issue alive as 
a source of discord between the DRV and China.

Hanoi's immense needs for aid as it turns to the tasks of 
reconstruction are also likely to give the Soviets advantages 
vis-a-vis the Chinese. The two Vietnams received a total of about 
$1.75 billion in economic aid last year, about $1,150 million in 
the north and $600 million in the south. Vietnamese needs may 
well drop this year, but will still remain large. The major share 
of the burden of assistance to South Vietnam, previously borne 
by the US, will have to be taken up by the USSR, if it is to be 
taken up at all. The immediate needs of the Vietnamese are for 
petroleum, fertilizer, and other commodities. Long term needs 
will be for technical and material assistance for industrial de-
velopment. The Soviets apparently have been the first to promise 
a large aid package. 
However, the prospective aid burden is so great that the 
Soviets are likely to encourage and assist Hanoi in its inevitable 
efforts to diversify its sources of aid. Indeed, the Soviets 
have already dropped a hint that they would approve of US aid 
in the reconstruction of Vietnam, and they are likely to make 
even more vigorous efforts in this direction in their approaches 
to third countries. Despite their reluctance to assume the whole 
burden, however, the Soviets are likely to bear whatever costs 
are necessary to keep the upper hand over the Chinese. 
It appears well within Moscow's capability to be the leading 
foreign voice in Hanoi for the next two or three years, a position

which will merely give it prominence rather than any real control 
over Hanoi. The USSR is likely to encounter much harder going in 
any efforts to see Hanoi through to a position of regional dominance. 
What the Soviets appear to have in mind is a loose Vietnamese 
hegemony over the other countries of Indo-China. Thus the Soviets 
support the reunification of Vietnam -- although they defer to 
Hanoi's judgment on timing and modalities -- in the interests of 
seeing Hanoi's regional,position strengthened, just as the Chinese 
view the prospect with obvious distaste for the same reason. 
B. Laos 
Soviet support for Vietnamese dominance over Laos and Cambodia 
is also due to the lack of a better means of gaining some influence 
in the area. The Soviets themselves do not play a major, role in 
Laos, much less in Cambodia. In Laos the Soviet position is in 
many ways dependent on that of the North Vietnamese, who have vied? 
with the Chinese for dominance over the country and still maintain 
'a substantial troop presence in the country. Soviet contacts with 
the Pathet Lao, on the other hand, have been minimal. 
Moscow's dogged support of the coalition government in Laos 
through the latest phase in the political battle in that country 
suggests that it is somewhat behind the pace of events. The Soviet 
position does serve the purpose of denying Moscow's responsibility 
for the destruction of the balance between the contending forces, 
but there is no reason to doubt Moscow's frequent expressions of 
25X1

25X1 
No Objection to Declassification in Part 2010/08/05: LOC-HAK-539-7-2-4 
satisfaction with the status quo in Laos. As recently as last 
March, the authoritative Foreign Ministry official, Mikhail Kapitsa, 
underlined Soviet preferences with the public comment that in Laos 
the Soviets are "royalists." 
Whatever the change in the political realities, the Soviets 
will urge the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao to maintain the fig-
leaf of coalition government. If the Pathet Lao should choose to 
dispense with this facade, the Soviets would, of course, swim with 
the tide. In any event, in circumstances of Pathet Lao dominance, 
the Soviets will follow their accustomed tactics of beckoning with 
offers of aid warning against the diabolical intentions of the 
Chinese, and urging the removal of Chinese forces from northern 
Laos. 
C. Cambodia  
Insubstantial as is the Soviet position in Laos, it is in-
finitely better than that which they "enjoy" in Cambodia. Moscow's 
relationship with the new communist rulers is little short of 
calamitous. The Soviet embassy in Phnom Penh was fired upon and 
looted by Khmer Rouge troops, Soviet representatives have been 
roughed up, and the entire seven-man official Soviet community 
in Cambodia was unceremoniously bundled out of the country with 
other resident foreigners.

there is evidence that Chinese technicians are on the ground in 
Cambodia and that the Chinese have established a diplomatic presence 
in Phnom Penh. 
The failure of Soviet policy to keep up with the pace of 
events has contributed mightily to Moscow's present discomfiture. 
Moscow was cool toward the Khmer Rouge rebellion at its inception 
because of the pro-Chinese proclivities of its leaders and because 
its titular leader, Prince Sihanouk found asylum in Peking. Moscow's 
reflexive hostility toward the Khmer Rouge was later reinforced 
by its apparent miscalculation of the balance of forces in Cambodia. 
As late as February 1975 Soviet spokesmen were insisting that neither 
side in the ,Cambodian civil war was capable of victory, and that the 
only solution to the conflict was a coalition settlement on the 
Laotian model. It was not until late March that the Soviets moved 
to break relations with the tottering Lon Nol government, much too 
late to affect their standing with the Khmer Rouge. 
Moscow's vistas are further darkened by the mounting signs 
of friction between the Khmer Rouge and .the North Vietnamese. The 
Khmer Rouge are moving with dispatch to expel the remnants of the 
Vietnamese presence in Cambodia, have preeented the Vietnamese 
with a fait accompli with their occupation of disputed islands 
in the Gulf of Thailand, and have engaged in sporadic border 
Lighting with the Vietnamese. For the short run, at least, Soviet 
hopes that Cambodia would fall under the sway of the North Vietnamese 
seem without foundation.

The Soviets so far have accepted the snubs and abuse which 
the Cambodians have directed their way with relative calm. They 
have not commented publicly on the ill treatment of their nationals 
and the violation of their embassy, although they have protested 
privately. Their only open show of displeasure was made during 
Brezhnev'sNLE. Day speech, when he conspicuously omitted mention 
of the Cambodians while extending fervid congratulations to the 
Vietnamese. 
The Soviets will probably opt to continue to extend the hand 
of friendship-- and aid -- to the Cambodians in the hope that 
they will eventually modify their hostility toward Moscow. In 
somewhat similar circumstances, they have endured considerable 
abuse at the hands of the Albanians while still continuing to 
extend the olive branch from time to tiMe. At the same time, they 
? 
will be realistic enough to realize that there is no real prospect 
of change in the immediate future; a circumstance which they can 
accept with minimum discomfort as long as their relations with the 
more important Vietnamese remain good. They might even see some 
advantage in being completely disassociated from a Cambodia which 
bids fair to be an abrasive presence in Southeast Asia. 
D Regional Goals 
It seems clear that the Soviets would prefer to see order 
and stability return to Southeast Asia, and will counsel Hanoi 
against the export of revolution. The pro-Chinese affiliations

of the existing insurrectionary or underground forces in the 
region -- in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia -- provide a firm 
foundation to this policy orientation, especially in light of 
Moscow's recent experiences with the Cambodians. Their record 
of performance in Laos and Cambodia underlines their distaste for 
unpredictable changes which threaten to undermine more important 
Soviet objectives in the West and in the major Asian countries, 
such as Japan and India. 
In addition to its internal logic, there is considerable 
objective evidence that this is indeed the Soviet position. Soviet 
propaganda has routinely attacked the Chinese for their "subversive 
activities" in such countries as Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and 
Thailand. The Soviets have in fact loudly condemned the various 
Chinese-oriented insurgencies in these countries and denied their 
communist credentials. Soviet preferences have also been evident 
in the tone of public commentary on developments in Indo-China, 
which have laid heavy stress on the tasks of "rehabilitation" 
which lie ahead and on the significance of peace in Indo-China 
for the prospects of detente. 
The Soviets can be expected to try to capitalize on the new? 
sense of insecurity felt by Thailand, Malaysia, and the other 
Asian neighbors of the new Indo-Chinese regimes to promote its 
scheme for an Asian collective security pact. This project, 
which among other things would commit the signatories to avoid

lup 
interference in each other's internal affairs, will continue to 
surface from time to time in spite of its heretofore tepid recep-
tion by the Asian addressees of Soviet approaches. Despite Moscow's 
pious denials, the Chinese are undoubtedly quite right in assuming 
that it is intended to isolate China diplomatically from its Asian 
neighbors. 
While there is little reason to doubt Soviet preferences in 
Southeast Asia, there is reason to question the Soviets' ability 
to impose their preferences on the region or even on their erst-
while allies in Hanoi. Moscow may caution Hanoi against increasing 
its involvement in the affairs of Thailand, but it would see little 
profit in directly confronting a Vietnamese decision to act other-
wise. Hanoi is, at the moment, their only high card in the Indo-
Chinese game. However, because the Chinese are likely to retain 
considerable influence over the Thai Communist Party, the Soviets 
are unlikely to endorse its insurgency even if the Vietnamese 
continue to aid it. Thus far, since the fall of Cambodia and 
Vietnam, the Soviets have in fact continued to condemn the Thai 
insurgents as Chinese "mercenaries." 
PROSPECTS  
The Soviets have no clear idea of what the future holds for 
them in Southeast Asia. Soviet officials noted glumly as the war 
In Vietnam ground to a close that there were too many unknown 
factors to enable them to predict what the new constellation of

forces in the area would be. They pointed out that these include 
the quadrangular interaction between Peking, Washington, Moscow, 
and Hanoi; relations between the North Vietnamese and the Viet 
Cong; between the Viet Cong and other South Vietnamese; between 
the Khmer Rouge and the Sihanouk loyalists; and between the Pathet 
Lao and the other Laotians. They could have added to the list 
relations between the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese and between 
the new communist regimes and communist insurrectionaries in 
neighboring countries. 
One unexpected result which could develop from the new situa-
tion could be a coincidence of Soviet and Chinese efforts to 
maintain an American presence in the area, each for their own 
reasons. The Soviets have already hinted at their interest in 
furthering better relations between Washington and the two Viet-
nams, and in having the US assume part of the aid burden. The 
Chinese, for their part, are loathe to see the Americans leave 
the Soviets a wider freedom of action in the area.
