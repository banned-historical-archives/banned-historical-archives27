DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Czechoslovakia- UAR: 
Czechoslovakia offered up to $28,000,000 in long-term 
111UUSL,L* al credits, to the UAR during talks recently held in 
Prague. The UAR, however, proposed that Czechoslovakia 
extend a $70,000,000 line of credit for use during Cairo's five-
year economic development plan. The talks are tentatively 
scheduled to be resumed in Cairo in October. Among other 
matters, the discussions in Prague also involved the question 
of re-export of cotton by the bloc, the supply of spare parts 
for arms previously furnished the UAR by Czechoslovakia, and 
financial arrangements connected with "past and future" military 
agreements. (Page 1) 
Communist China: Mao Tse-tung's personal convening of 
a meeting in Peiping on 15 September appears to be an attempt 
on his part to regain prestige lost in the failures of the "leap 
forward" and in the latest changes in the commune program. 
The meeting, attended by most of the top party and nonparty 
leaders, discussed the question of using the occasion of the re-
gime's, 10th anniversary on 1 October to grant pardons to re-
formed criminals and remove the label of "rightist" from those 
who "behaved well." Formal implementation of these policies 
was promptly initiated by a 16 September resolution of the State 
Council and the party central committee. The moderating of 
Peiping's attacks on "right opportunists" in the last few days is 
also probably intended to provide an atmosphere of national  
unity and to display the regime's "benevolence."

Laos: 6)ffic1als of the British Foreign Office have sug-
geste-M�American representatives the advisibility of nego-
tiating a deal with the Communists to restore the "sanitized" 
status of Laos along the line of the 1954 Geneva settlement. 
The French have already begun an apparently well-coordinated 
campaign to depreciate the military aspects and to advocate 
some concessions to the Laotian dissidents by the Phoui gov-
ernment to "stabilize" the situation. Skirmishing in Sam Neua 
and Phong Saly provinces apparently continues,an.d small-scale 
attacks on Laotian Army units have occurred in central Laos 
within the past week) 
(Page 2) 
*Iraq: The announcement in Baghdad that Brigadier Tabaqchali 
has been sentenced to death for his association with the Mosul re-
volt last spring is likely to result in a further increase in polit-
ical tension in Iraq and might possibly trigger a nationalist, anti-
Communist coup attempt. Tabaqchali, by his defiance of the pro-
Communist court president, Colonel Mandawi, has become a 
symbol of resistance to Communist pressure. Prime Minister 
Qasim must still approve the sentence before it can be carried 
out, and his decision may not be forthcoming for some time. Anti-
Communist elements might feel, however, that they cannot afford 
to await Qasim's decision,, since they have come 
tions as highly unDredict7..ble. 
Iraq: Iraq is shifting its patronage of Western educational 
institutions to those of the Communist bloc._ During the coming 
school year, a record number of government-sponsored students 
will be sent abroad, and it is expected that the Communist bloc, 
which had only 12 Iraqi students last fall, will receive many times 
that number this year, with a commensurate reduction in the num-
ber of students sent to Western countries. About 425 scholarships 
have been offered by bloc countries for the coming year, and 
"bargain rate" educational costs in bloc countries provide an ad-
ditional incentive for Iraq to send many of the 2,000 government-
backed scholars to the bloc. (Page 3)

Morocco:CKing Mohamed V will probably permit the 
Ibrahim government to remain in office for some time while 
he searches for a moderate successor, according to the 
American ambassador in Rabat. An early change of govern-
ment had been anticipated because the King was recently irri 
tated by left-wing youth group criticism of the army and secu-
rity forces, and right-wing monarchists had urged a showdown 
with left-wing members of the government  
Japan: Top Japanese Socialist party leaders have decided 
to adjourn the party convention until October without resolving 
the dispute between the left and right wings. Attempts� to me-
diate the crisis have failed to develop a basis acceptable to 
Suehiro Nishio for returning his right-wing faction to the con-
vention. Nishio, apparently influenced by some members of 
his faction who feel the time is not favorable, is delaying the 
formation of a new anti-Communist Socialist party, although 
he is committed at least to establishing a more aggressive in-
traparty opposition. (Page 4) 
Watch Committee conclusions: Situations susceptible of 
direct exploitation by Sino-Soviet bloc action which would jeop-
ardize US interests exist in the Middle East, particularly in 
Iraq and Iran, and in Laos. 
Middle East: The initiation of significant hostilities is un-
likely in this area in the immediate future. 
Laos: The dissidents, with probable North 'Vietnamese as-
sistance, continue to have the objective of establishing themselves 
in a strong position, particularly in the northern provinces, which 
they could use as the basis for political negotiation or for the ex-
pansion of military operations to include the greater portion, if 
not all, of the country, should government resistance weaken.

munist Ernest�ievar2. will have an influential industrial 
planning role. (Page 5)  
*France-Algeria: (De Gaulle's 16 September commitment to 
give Algeria the choice of independence "within four years of 
pacification" has the immediate aim of isolating the FLN and 
neutralizing an anti-French resolution in the UN General Assem-
bly. By stressing continuing military pacification and by offer-
ing integration of Algeria with France as an alternative he hopes 
to mollify his army and rightist critics. Nevertheless, his pub-
lic espousal of self-determination indicates confidence in suffi-
cient army support to control any overt opposition, and in eventual 
Moslem willingness to choose close association with France. The 
most likely leader of any serious opposition, Deputy Premier 
Jacques Soustelle� has reportedly assured De Gaulle of his sup-
port. FLN leaders, gathered in Tunis, appear certain to denounce 
De Gaulle's unwillingness to negotiate a political settlement, and 
probably view his proposals as an attempt to undercut their sup-
port in the UN and among Algerian Moslems.)

Czech Efforts to Strengthen Ties With UAR  
Czechoslovakia, in a move designed to strengthen its eco-
nomic ties with Cairo, recently offered additional economic aid 
to the UAR. 
 Czechoslovakia 
offered up to $28,000,000 in industrial credits to be repaid in 
eight years at 3-percent interest. The UAR, however, requested 
that a $70,000,000 Czech line of credit be extended: for use dur-
ing Cairo's five-year economic development plan. Further nego-
tiations on the matter are tentatively scheduled to take place in 
Cairo next month. 
Since 1955, Prague has provided Egypt and Syria with more 
than $30,000,000 in economic credits, all of which were extended 
prior to the formation of the UAR. A $56,000,000 Czech line of 
credit reportedly was offered Egypt in late 1957, but Prague did 
not follow up the offer after the creation of the UAR. The cur-
rent Czech offer of economic aid probably developed from dis-
cussions held in Cairo during August when a Czech ministerial 
delegation visited the UAR. Since then both Czech and UAR 
news media have reported Czech intentions to participate in the 
UAR industrialization program. 
The recent negotiations in Prague also concerned ways to 
improve Czech-UAR trade relations. The UAR expressed dis-
satisfaction with the Czech practice of re-exporting Egyptian 
cotton, and Prague promised to prevent this in the future. 
Czechoslovakia, for its part, voiced displeasure with Cairo's 
policy of granting discounts to Western purchasers of cotton. 
The trade talks are due to resume in Cairo shortly, when 
Czech negotiators are to contract for imports--including cot-
ton�from the UAR for fiscal year 1959-1960. 
The discussions in Prague also involved the supply of 
spare parts for the arms and  military equipment previously 
supplied by Czechoslovakia. 
this problem will be worked out after the cotton-
pricing question has been resolved. The talks also touched 
upon financial arrangements connected with "bast and future" 
military agreements.

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
ThbeSituation in Laos  
(British Foreign Office officials have suggested to Amer-
ican Embassy officers early British-American consultations 
on the advisability of at least exploratory negotiations with the 
Communists with the objective of restoring to Laos its previ-
ously "sanitized" status. Recalling their arduous 5-year anti-
guerrilla campaign in Malaya, the British officials doubt the 
feasibility of a military solution to the Laotian crisis. They 
express preference for some kind of "deal" along the lines 
of the 1954 Geneva agreements, in which the Communists, in 
return for guarantees against Western intervention in Laos 
and perhaps some concessions to the Pathet Lao, would refrain 
from giving military support to the rebel) 
(France, in line with its view that the trouble in Laos is 
largely of domestic political origin, has rejected the Soviet 
proposal for reconvening the 1954 Geneva conference which 
ended the Indochina war. The French have accused the Lao-
tian Army of exaggerating external Communist assistance to 
the dissidents in order to cover the army's "ineptness." A 
French Foreign Ministry official recently commented to 
American representatives that it "might not be a bad idea" 
for the Laotian Government to make concessions to the dissi-
dents to stabilize the situation. Such a suggestion is in keep-
ing with France's long-standing preference for the neutraliza-
tion of the non-Communist states in Indochina) 
Small-scale attacks on Laotian Army units have occurred 
in central Laos during the past two weeks. Skirmishing in Sam 
1 Neua and Phong Saly provinces also continues, but on an appar-
ently reduced scale),

Iraq Shifting Students to Soviet  :Bloc 
During the coming school year a record number of Iraqi 
government-sponsored students will be sent abroad, and it is 
expected that the Soviet bloc will make serious inroads in the 
number sent to Western countries. The bloc, which had only 
12 Iraqi students last year, has offered about 450 scholarships 
for the coming year. An additional incentive for Iraq to switch 
students is "bargain rate" educational costs in the USSR. An 
Iraqi educational official has stated that an Iraqi student in the 
US costs his government $4,200 per year, as opposed to a cost 
of $440 in the USSR. Moreover, he said, the USSR provides 
free medical care and other amenities, "which are not avail-
able in most Western universities." 
On 2 September the Iraqi Ministry of Education announced 
that 2,000 students will be sent abroad on Iraqi Government 
scholarships during the 1959-60 academic year, an increase 
of 700 over this year. According to the ministry, the approx-
imately 3,200 Iraqi students abroad this year on government 
scholarships and at their own expense were distributed as 
follows: US 941, Britain 623, West Germany 197, France 143, 
India 54, Switzerland 30, Austria 51, Italy 3, and Sweden 2. 
In the Middle East there are 546 in Turkey, 297 in Lebanon, 
279 in the UAR, 4 in Iran, and 3 in Pakistan. Of students in 
the bloc, there are 11 in East Germany and one in Poland. 
For the coming academic year, East Germany has granted 
70 scholarships, Bulgaria and Hungary 22 each, Czechoslovakia 
15, Poland 10, Rumania 6, Albania 5, and North Korea 5. The 
USSR has agreed to accept 300 students--50 on full scholarships 
--the costs of the remaining 250 being split between the USSR 
and Iraq. In addition, Communist China has granted 18. Yugo-
slavia will give 14 scholarships. 
In the past the tendency has been for Iraqi students to be 
sent to the US and Great Britain because of the widespread  
use of the English language in Iraq.

Now 
Japanese Socialist Leaders Seek Time to Repair Party Schism  
Top Japanese Socialist party leaders have decided to adjourn 
the convention now in session at Tokyo in an effort to gain time in 
which to repair the schism created by the walkout of the right-wing 
Suehiro Nishio faction on 14 September in opposition to the party's 
trend toward extreme leftism. The leaders plan to resume the 
convention in October, prior to an extraordinary Diet session 
scheduled for that month. While feverish efforts thus far have 
failed to develop a formula acceptable to Nishio for the return of 
his faction to the party fold, the leaders apparently still hope to 
fashion a compromise that will prevent a formal split in the party. 
Nishio, apparently influenced by some supporters who believe 
the time is not favorable, has not decided to form a new party im-
mediately, but has said he would do so in October if forced by the 
present Socialist leaders. He has asserted that such a party would 
be non-Marxist with a broad popular appeal which would garner 
Socialist support from beyond organized labor and farmer unions. 
The moderate right-wing faction of Jotaro Kawakami, which 
has about 65 of the party's 250 Diet members, appears to hold 
the key to future developments in the Socialist party. Although 
a majority of the Kawakami group is reported to support Nishio, 
the faction agreed to participate in the party convention which re-
opened on 15 September with the understanding that action on the 
reorganization plan and the election of officers would be carried 
over to the October meeting. Kawakami, who initially defended 
Nishio, now has made clear by publicly criticizing the dissidents' 
plan for a new party that he wishes to avoid a party split at any 
cost. Even if Kawakami's position provides an avenue for a com-
promise, Nishio appears committed to establish a more aggres-
sive intraparty opposition.

III. THE WEST 
Cuban Government May Be Reshuffled  
Rufo Lopez Fresquet, Cuban finance minister, is reliably 
reported to have said on 14 September that "necessary and im-
portant changes" would soon be made in key revolutionary gov-
ernment positions. Lopez, who is highly regarded by Ameri-
can officials, appeared confident of retaining his post although 
his replacement has been rumored, along with that of several 
other moderate ministers. 
Fidel 
Castro is dissatisfied with the slow progress of the revolution, 
particularly agrarian and educational reforms, and will shift 
the directors of both to other positions. There is one report 
that Castro will resign as prime minister and assume active 
control of the agrarian reform institute. Most observers agree 
that pro-Communist Ernesto Guevara will receive some im-
portant post directing the development or regulation of the in-
dustrialization program, which is another priority revolutionary 
aim. 
The retention of trained officials like Fresquet, Economy 
Minister Boti, and National Bank president Pazos--who are 
determined to keep the Cuban economy from collapsing--would 
serve as a counterbalance to the apparently increasing power 
of Raul Castro, Guevara, and other extreme leftists
