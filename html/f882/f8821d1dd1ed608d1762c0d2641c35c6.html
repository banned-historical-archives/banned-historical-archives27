 FOR BACKGROUND USE ONLY
 Principal Developments in World Communist Affairs
 (13 December 1967 to 16 January 1968)
 1.   Preparations for the Budapest consultative meeting continue to
 hold the center of attention of most of the Communist world.  A CPSU
 statement carried by TASS on 9 January disclosed that the opening date
 will be 26 February and confirmed reports that the Hungarian invitation
 was sent only to the 81 parties which participated in the 1960 Moscow
 conference, contradicting the 25 November announcement that "all" fra`
 ternal parties would be included.   This excluded the Yugoslav party --
 which stated its intent to boycott the meeting under any circumstances.
 The Budapest daily NEPSZABADSAG claimed on 24 December that "some 30"
 parties had declared their intent to join the 18 signatories; TASS has
 since; then reported acceptances by a number of parties, but it is not
 clear.whether these are in addition to those counted by NEPSZABADSAG.
 There has been (at this writing) no indication that any of the Far East
 parties has yet committed itself.
 2.   Meanwhile, various developments underscore Soviet difficulties
 in managing Communist affairs even among generally Moscow-oriented CP's:
 a.   The Italians and Yugoslavs are organizing a 22 January
 Rome meeting of representatives of some 20-25 Communist and other
 left-wing political parties from countries bordering on the Medi-
 terranean to plan "a major conference dealing with threats to peace
 in the area" on the very eve of the Budapest conference.   Yugoslav
 Communists, who leaked the story to the western press in Belgrade,
 reportedly view the conference as "something of a slap at the Soviet
 Union," according to the NEW YORK TIMES of 14 January 1968.
 b.   Rumania became further estranged from the USSR and the Sov-
 iet bloc.   The 14-15 December visit of Ceausescu with CPSU leaders
 produced a communique described as the coldest ever resulting from
 a visit of a Communist leader; at least one foreign correspondhnt
 in Moscow described the situation as "the brink of a major crisis."
 (Anatole Shub in the WASHINGTON POST).   On 3-4 January Ceausescu
 paid a "friendship visit" to Tito which was seen as a consultation
 on opposition to the Budapest meeting.   (However subsequent news
 reports indicate the Rumanians will attend that conference.)  Mean-
 while, a Rumanian delegation signed new protocols,, in Tel'iiv on
 19 December greatly increasing trade and providing for joint indus-
 trial ventures.   And in Bonn it was reported on 12 January that
 Rumania imported more industrial machinery and equipment from West
 Germany in 1967 than from the USSR for the first time since World
 War II.  West Germany has become Rumania's principal creditor.
 c. The Czechoslovakian Communists finally ousted old-liner
 Novotny from his 14-year Party leadership on 5 January in a stormy

 Approved For Release 2005/04/21 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400040005-0
 Central Committee plenum which began 19 December (recessed on the
 21st for the holidays), despite Brezhnev's hasty visit to Prague
 on 8-9 December in an apparent attempt to avert the action.  The
 compromise victor, 46-year-old Alexander Dubcek, moved in from the
 top spot in the Slovakian party organization, thus becoming the
 first Slovak to head the national party.   There seemed to be nothing
 in Dubcek's background foreshadowing resistance to Soviet policies;
 indeed, he grew up in the USSR while his dedicated Communist father
 worked there.   Less than a week after he took command the Party's
 official daily, RUDE PRAVO, published an article which set forth in
 broad outline a series of radical policy proposals which appear to
 be more liberal domestically than those of the Yugoslav "revision-
 ists", and more independent internationally than those of Rumania.
 (These, however are similar to articles in the same paper last sum-
 mer and may well represent only the hopes of the liberals, not the
 policy of the new leadership.)
 d.  Further Soviet problems with Cuba were seen when, only four
 days after PRAVDA on 29 December glorified the Soviet "oil bridge
 ... guaranteeing the supply of oil to the Cuban economy," Castro
 announced stringent gasoline rationing and other curbs on oil because
 Soviet deliveries had been so inadequate that Cuba had to use its
 military reserves.
 e.  In mid-January the Communist; press revealed ex post facto
 that the Soviet "troika" -- Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny -- had
 made secret visits to Warsaw, on 13-14+ January, and to East Berlin,
 on 15-16 January.  This was the highest-level Soviet delegation to
 travel abroad since Khrushchev's trips with Bulganin.   Speculation
 on the reasons for such a move included discussion of further prep-
 arations for the Budapest conference, measures to curb West Germany's
 growing ties with Eastern Europe, and discussion of the new Czech
 leadership ... but there have been no "inside" reports as yet.
 3.  The most notable Soviet Bloc achievement during this period was
 a 19-21 December Warsaw meeting of Warsaw Pact foreign ministers which
 drew Rumanian and Yugoslav participation.  It produced a weak communique
 which did not repeat their earlier charge of Israeli "aggression", bal-
 anced a renewed call for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Arab ter-
 ritory with the reaffirmation of Israeli's right to exist, and failed
 to mention any pledge of military and economic aid to the Arabs.
 4.  Moscow suffered public exposure of internal unrest during this
 period, brought into the open by the daring opposition of a number of
 brave Moscovites to the regime's efforts to crack down on dissident intel-
 lectuals.                     Even the daily organ of the British Communist Party, MORNING
 STAR, was moved to condemn the secrecy of the trail of Galanskov and his
 colleagues in a front-page editorial on 13 January.  And in New Delhi,

 where Svetlana Alliluyeva chose freedom last year, there was a repeat
 performance on a lower level as 28-year-old Aziz S. Ulug-zade, member
 of a Soviet youth delegation and son of a prominent Tadzhik writer,
 slipped away from his colleagues and requested asylum in the U.S. Embassy
 an 20 December.  After complicated negotiations, he was permitted by the
 Indian Government to leave on 31 December for refuge in Great Britain.
 5.  Reports from Communist China indicate the continued spread of
 disorder and violence in many areas.  Most schools are apparently still
 closed, despite the orders to reopen last fall.   Meanwhile, a speech by
 Peking Revolutionary Committee Chairman Hsieh Fu-chih, reported in Can-
 ton Red Guard newspaper WEN NO TUNG HSUN of 11 December, indicates that
 the Chinese CP is planning to hold a national congress -- the last was its
 8th in 1956 -- between. May and October of this year.  It will be totally
 rigged, with delegates appointed from the top down.  Further Chinese
 isolation from the world resulted from the expulsion of the only Czech
 correspondent from Peking 15 January, and the closing of the NCNA office
 in Brussels on 22 December.
 6.  Miscellany:  A pro-Chinese "Parti Communiste Marxiste-Leniniste
 de France" was formally constituted by dissidents formerly associated in
 the "Mouvement M-L" at a 30-31 December congress in Aixe-en-Provence.
 The weekly L'HUMANITE NOUVELLE will continue as the organ of the party.
 ....The strengthened Berlin' wall permitted only 120 refugees to escape
 across the boundary in 1967, according to the Wast Berlin "August 13"
 organization.

 PROBLEMS OF REFORM IN CHILE
 Eduardo FREI Montalva's election as President of Chile in September
 196+ was hailed by democratic forces as a major step forward in the his-
 tory of a country long considered one of the most stable and democratic
 in Latin America.   It was hoped that his dynamic, reform-minded Christian
 Democratic administration would prove to be an effective alternative to
 Communism by offering a real route to social and economic progress.   Frei's
 decisive victory in the presidential election was followed six months
 later by an impressive Christian Democratic Party (PDC) showing in the
 March 1965 congressional elections.   The PDC, won a majority in the Chamber
 of Deputies as well all the Senate seats it contested.  However, the
 Senate majority remained in opposition hands, presenting a serious ob-
 stacle to the passage of Frei's reform measures.   Since December 1966 the
 Senate has been controlled by an informal coalition of the Communist-
 Socialist front, FRAP (Popular Action Front), and the opportunistic Radi-
 cal Party (PR), supported at times by the conservative National Party (PN).
 In January 1967 the PN voted with this combination in the Senate to
 embarrass the government by withholding permission for Frei to make an
 official trip to the United States.
 Christian Democratic Party
 What is Christian Democracy?  Its definition varies from country to
 country in Latin America.   The movement is a force on the left which
 espouses change and reform, often radical in nature.   It has parties in
 16 of Latin America's 20 countries, but only in four of them -- Chile,
 Peru, Venezuela and El Salvador -- is the movement of current political
 significance.   In only one of these -- Chile -- is the PDC the governing
 party.   Christian Democracy is based essentially on the Roman Catholic
 Church's   growing liberalization in social issues.  While the majority
 of Christian Democrats are Roman Catholics, the ideology of the party
 throughout Latin America is one of general Christian practice and
 not especially one that is grounded in the precepts and tenets of Roman
 Catholicism.   Many Latin American Christian Democrats have renounced the
 teachings of the Catholic Church.   The changes advocated by the PDC are
 broad in range and include agrarian and tax reform, and extensive economic
 planning and control by the state.   Classical capitalism is repudiated.
 The Christian Democratic movement is def4nitely on the left, but the
 distance from the center varies from country to country.  No matter where
 the parties stand, however, Chile's President Frei may be regarded as the
 symbolic hemispheric leader of the movement.
 Recent PDC Trends toward the Far Left
 After Frei's victory the PDC was faced with the problem of changing
 from an opposition party to a governing party.   Frei had drained off many
 of the most able, moderate party members for positions in his government,
 leaving a leadership vacuum which he himself refused to fill -- he feels

 Approved For Release 2005/04/21 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400040005-0
 that the position of the presidency transcends party leadership respon-
 sibilities.                             The left-wing "rebel" faction of the PDC -- taking advantage
 of its newly acquired freedom of action -- gained control of the party
 on 16 July 1967 by taking over the national council and the presidency
 of the party.
 Five days before the party elections last July, the PDC rebel fac-
 tion asserted its independence of the Frei administration by engineering
 a party resolution approving the formation of a Chilean committee of the
 Cuban-sponsored Latin American Solidarity Organization (LASO).  The
 declaration damaged Chile's image in both North and South America and
 disheartened Christian Democrats elsewhere in Latin America who had
 regarded the Chilean party as a prime example of successful radical
 reforms through peaceful means.   Frei reacted by denouncing LASO and
 labeling Chilean delegates to the LASO Conference as "traitors," point-
 ing out that while he had no legal means of preventing LASO from forming
 a local committee, his government "will repress without hesitation any
 subversive intent and will not permit Chile to be the base for any action
 whatsoever which  interferes in the free self-determination of other
 peoples," adding that "Chile has all the means necessary" to control
 extremists.
 One of the first acts of the new PDC governing group was to appoint
 a commission to "stimulate a non-capitalistic way of development."  The
 commission's "Chonchol Report" advocated large-scale government inter-
 vention in the economy and nationalization of industry and conflicted
 directly with Frei's more moderate reform program.   Shortly thereafter,
 the rebels demanded that Frei shake up his cabinet, firing the ministers
 of health and labor, whom they considered too far to the conservative
 right; Frei refused, saying that the selection of cabinet officers is
 the prerogative of the president -- but he did compromise by agreeing
 to consult the new party leadership on important questions of internal
 and foreign affairs.
 A drop in popular support for both Frei and the PDC was indicated
 in the 2 April 1967 municipal elections, when Frei, placing his adminis-
 tration and program on the line in the hope of turning the municipal
 voting into a plebescite for the PDC, received only 35.6 per cent of
 the vote -- a distinct decrease from the 42.3 percentage received in
 the 1965 congressional elections.
 However, Frei regained at least interim  control of the PDC on
 7 January of this year at a special party convention where     after a
 hard-fought 15-hour battle during which the President made two personal
 apperances to defend his program -- he received a vote of confidence of
 278 against 202.   Senator Rafael Gumucio, the rebel leader, and his
 directorate stepped down to make room for the new chairman, Jaime Castillo
 Velasco, former Land and Colonization Minister and staunch supporter of
 President Frei.   The PDC convention pledged support for Frei's reform
 program, including his wage adjustment legislation, but voted against
 his one-year ban on strikes.   (See Attachment A)

 Communist Party of Chile (P.CCh)
 During the course of the recent disputes in Latin America between
 adherents of the Cuban brand of militant revolutionary Communism and the
 advocates of the more moderate Moscow line of peaceful revolution, the
 PCCh has consistently favored the "via pacifica."  Secretary General
 Luis Corvalan is one of the foremost Latin American proponents of the
 theory that the correct strategy for achieving Communist goals in a par-
 ticular country can best be determined by the local Communist Party, and
 that armed revolution is not the way to success in Chile.   To prove this
 thesis the PCCh will have to make an all out effort to gain power through
 legal means; therefore it can be expected to attempt to broaden its
 popular base aslmuch as possible in preparation for the 1970 election.
 Corvalan, in an article in the "World Marxist Review" for July 1967 (see
 Attachment B), claims that this is being accomplished:   "The Communist
 effort gradually to win over the masses from the Christian Democrats,
 delivering them from bourgeois influence and rallying petit-bourgeois
 support for the People's Action Front, is bearing fruit."  Since July
 1967 PCCh has made several steps toward inspiring a loose left-to-far-
 left coalition with the Radical and Socialist parties, even though a
 new split within the Socialists themselves (see below) and other factors
 may keep these three parties from any meaningful coalition behind a
 common presidential candidate in 1970.   The PCCh took an active part in
 the campaign of Alberto Baltra, the Radical Party's +aandidate for the
 senatorial by-election on 17 December 1967, and the Communists and the
 Radicals are likely to continue their cooperation.   Baltra won the
 senate seat by a narrow margin over the PDC candidate Jorge Lavandero,
 who received little help from his party.
 Socialist Party of Chile (PS)
 Dissensions within the PS during the last year tended to strain the
 unity of the FRAP, the Communist-Socialist coalition of several years'
 standing, in its struggle against the Frei administration.   In a PS Party
 plenum in June Senator Raul Ampuero, motivated by presidential ambitions
 and disagreeing with Socialist Party leader Salvador Allende, withdrew
 from the meeting, taking with him another Senator, six deputies, and 15
 (of about 30) regional secretaries.   Ampuero, who has since been expelled
 from the party, threatens to drain off the remainder of his so-called
 "popular socialist" following from the PS and establish a party of his
 own -- thereby creating a special dilemma for the Communists, who would
 then be forced to maintain working relations with two groups opposed to
 each other.
 At the PS Party congress in November, Senate President Allende, long
 a supporter of Castro's extremist views, suddenly found himself on the
 other side of the fence.   The extremist faction of the PS, which had come
 out strongly against supporting Radical Party candidate Baltra for the
 special senatorial election on 17 December, vilifying the PR as an
 "opportunistic bourgeois grouping," and condemning the electoral process
 as a means to power, decided not to participate in the election.   Allende,

 booed when he counseled moderation toward the Radicals, threatened to
 resign the Senate presidency and did, in fact, later turn over his official
 duties to an acting president.  Meanwhile, the extremist faction, strength-
 ened by the Ampuero withdrawal from party leadership, threatened to form
 a new party -- possibly in combination with the Movement of the Revolu-
 tionary Left (MIR) and other ultra extremists -- unless the congress adopted
 a harder line toward elections. The congress finally decided on a compro-
 mise course -- to abstain from the December senatorial by-election and
 participate in future elections on a selective basis only.   The decision
 will further increase the strains within FRAP, since the PCCh is committed
 to the legal road to power.
 Student Trends toward the Far Left
 In the student field there has also been a significant turn to the
 extreme left.   In the Concepcion University Student Federation (FEC)
 elections the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) and the Socialist
 University Brigade (BUS) formed a coalition to defeat the Christian Demo-
 cratic slate.                        The FEC Council will be composed of five members of the
 winning coalition, three Christian Democratic Youth members and one Radi-
 cal Youth member. The new president, Luciano Cruz of the MI4, was expelled
 from the Communist Party youth organization in 196+ for adopting a posi-
 tion more radical and extreme than that held by the Communist Party.   The
 election of Cruz would seem to indicate that University of Concepcion
 students openly support violent revolutionary change.
 Frei's Reform Program
 In spite of opposition from both the extreme left and the far right,
 the PDC reform program has made some headway.  Just past the mid point of
 his "revolution in liberty," Frei has managed to obtain some of the neces-
 sary legislation for his program, although in his own party the left wing
 seems to have more in common with the Communist-Socialist Popular Action
 Front than with the-government.- Frei's land reform program has been.
 hailed as the best of its kind in Latin America.   The Land Reform law,
 which was signed 16 July 1967 by Frei, proposes to parcel out 100,000
 small holdings to landless farm workers, squatters who have worked land
 they do not own for at` 'least five years, sharecroppers, renters, and
 caretakers or owners of land insufficient to support one family.   The
 lan.d,which will be sold to peasants without down payment and on long-term
 credit, will be expropriated from other land holders, who will be paid in
 cash and bonds over the next 25 years.   Land can be expropriated if it is
 larger than 160 acres of irrigated land, if it has been abandoned and lies
 fallow, or if it is poorly administered or upproductive.   This does not
 mean all large farms will be taken over by the government for sale.   In
 outlining his program Frei has said:   "There are 260,000 farms in Chile;
 we propose to expropriate only 4,000 of these."  All this is to be accomp-
 lished in the next five years, according to'Frei's program.  In this pro-
 gram as well as in most of his other reforms, Frei is caught in a cross-
 fire by his political opponents -- the Communist and Socialist parties

 are claiming that the law does not go far enough in that it will not pre-
 vent the rich land-holders from hanging on to their properties by hook or
 crook, and the rightwing interests contend that turning over good land to
 Chile's ignorant campesinos is a criminal waste.
 Inflation has long been recognized as a major problem in Chile by the
 Frei administration.   His latest measure to,combat increasing inflation is
 a composed wage adjustment plan which would limit wage increases in both
 public and private sectors, establish a wage increase partly payable in
 slow-maturing government savings bonds, prohibit strikes for additional
 wage increases and impose extensive price controls.  A 24-hour general
 strike in protest against this wage bill was called on 23 November by the
 Single Center of Chilean Workers (CUTCh), which is controlled by the
 Communist and Socialist Parties.   The strike was also supported by non-
 Communist unions not affiliated with CUTCh.   The government initiated
 proceedings against the leaders of the strike charging them with "organi-
 zing, guiding and promoting" massive riots, Wrhich left at least five per-
 sons dead and 66 injured.   The 35-day strike at the Anaconda Copper Com-
 pany's mine was settled on 4 December, with wage increases far above the
 government's suggested guidelines.   Other copper workers struck last month,
 both in sympathy with the Anaconda miners and in cooperation with the
 strike of 23 November.  When their contracts expire next year they will
 undoubtedly demand wage increases at least equal to those attained by the
 Anaconda workers, thus ending Government hopes for wage and price restraint
 in 1968.
 Frei has initiated other reforms -- some quite unpopular with the
 voters.   In order to lessen Chile's dependence on imported foodstuffs and
 conserve foreign exchange, he placed a ban on the sale of beef three
 weeks out of every four; and in an effort to regularize the working day,
 he shortened the daily three-hour siesta and placed strict regulations on
 the hours of movies and bars.   In the fields of education and housing the
 Frei administration had made significant progress.   Other portions of
 Frei's reform program, however, have not fared so well -- his revision of
 corporation law have been held up by the opposition majority in the senate.
 Any attempt to assess the Frei government's popularity, however, must
 take into account his successes and failures on issues such as agrarian
 reform and inflation.   It is still too early to judge the effectiveness
 of his agrarian program -- just getting underway -- but he managed to
 reduce inflation from 48 per cent a year when the PDC took over in 1965
 to 19 per cent in 1966.

 PROBLFMAS DE IA REFORMA EN CHILE
 La eleccidn de Eduardo Frei Montalva como Presidente de Chile, en
 septiembre de 1964, fu4 considerada por las fuerzas democrdticas como un
 paso hacia adelante en la historia de un pals considerado por largo tiempo
 como uno de los mds estables y democrdticos de Latinoameriea.  Se espe-
 raba que su administraci6n Cristiano-Dem6crata, dindmica y reformista,
 probarla ser una alternativa efectiva al comunismo, ofreciendo una ruta
 verdadera hacia el progreso econ6mico y social.  La decisiva victoria de
 Frei en las elecciones presidenciales fud seguida, seis meses mds tarde,
 en las elecciones para congresistas de 1965, per la presencia del impre-
 sionante Partido Dem6crata Cristiano (PDC).  El PDC obtuvo la mayorfa
 en la Comara de Diputados y en todas las curules del Senado; sin embar-
 go, el Senado permaneci6 en manes de la oposici6n, presentando un serio
 obstdculo en la aprobaci6n de las medidas de reformas presentadas por
 Frei.  Desde diciembre de 1966 el Senado ha estado controlado por una
 coalici6n informal del frente Socialista-Comunista, FRAP (Frente de
 Acci6n Popular), y del oportunista Partido Radical (PR), apoyado en oca-
 siones por el conservador Partido National (PN).  En enero de 1967 el
 PN vot6 con esta combination en el Senado con el fin de sabotear al go-
 bierno denegando el permiso a Frei de un viaje oficial a los Estados
 Unidos.
 Partido Dem6crata Cristiano
 Qud es Democracia Cristiana?  Su definici6n en America Latina,
 varfa segun el pals.  El movimiento es una fuerza de izquierda que pro-
 mulga cambio y reforma, a menudo en forma radical.  Tiene partidos en
 16 de los 20 passes de la America Latina, pero solamente en cuatro de
 ellos - Chile, Peru, Venezuela y El Salvador - el movimiento tiene una
 verdadera importancia polftica.  Unicamente en uno de estos passes
 - Chile - el PDC es el partido que gobierna.  La Democracia Cristiana
 estd basada esencialmente en la creciente liberacidn social de la
 Iglesia Catdlica Romana.  Aunque la mayorfa de los cristiano-dem6cratas
 son cat6licos romanos, la ideologla del Partido, a traves de America
 Latina, es la practicada por la generalidad.de los cristianos y no estd
 especialmente basada en los preceptor y normas del Catolicismo Romano.
 Muchos cristiano-dem6cratas latinoamericanos 'fan renunciado a las ense-
 fianzas de la Iglesia Catdlica.  Los cambios abogados por el PDC son muy
 amplios e incluyen las reformas agraria y de impuestos, un extenso plan
 econ6mico y el control por el estado.  El capitalismo cldsico es repu-
 diado.  El movimiento Cristiano-Dem6crata es definitivamente de izquier-
 da, pero la distancia que to separa del centro varfa segun el pals.
 An sin tener en cuenta las tendencias de los partidos, puede conside-
 rarse al Presidente Frei de Chile como lfder simb6lico del movimiento
 en el hemisferio.

 "agrupaci6n burguesa oportunista" y condenando el proceso electoral

 Esto no quiere decir que Codas las fincas grandes vayan a ser apropia-

 dicho: "En Chile hay 260.000 fj.ncas; nos proponemos expropiar solamente
 4.000".  Todo esto serd llevado a cabo en los pr6ximos cinco anos de
 acuerdo con el programs de Frei.  En este programs al igual que en Is

 nentes politicos - los.partidos socialista y comunista reclaman que is
 ley no vs lo suficientemente lejos al no impedir que los terratenientes
 retengan sus propiedades por medios tortuosos o aviesos, y los intereses
 de las derechas claman que entregar buenas tierras a los ignorantes
 campesinos chilenos es un desperdicio criminal.
 La inflacidn ha sido reconocida durante largo tiempo por la ad-
 ministracida de Frei como el mayor problems en Chile.  Su  ltima medida
 pars combatir la creciente inflacidn es un plan compuesto de reajuste
 de salarios que limite al aumento de los mismos, tanto en los sectores
 pdblicos como privados, establecer un aumento en los salarios pagadero
 parte en bonos de ahorro del gobierno a 1 argo plazo, prohibir las huel-
 gas par demanda de aumento en los salarios e imponer un extenso control
 sobre los precios.  El 23 de noviembre, la Central Unica de Trabajadores
 de Chile (CUTCh) que estd controlada por los partidos socialista y co-
 munista, llam6 a una.huelga general de 24 horas en protests contra esta
 ley de salarios.  La huelga f ud apoyada tambien por uniones no comunis-

 The party did, however, vote against one
 Frei proposalLone that would ban all labor

 defeat in the multihour session which saw a
 procession of votes which supported the
 Chilean Christian Democratic leader.
 Mr. Frei and his supporters argue that
 reform is essential for Chile, but it must
 come about through legislative vote and
 must not undermine the Chilean Constitu?

 tax reform, and significant housing construc-
 tion.
 'Temporary setbacks'
 The Frei reform program has been widely
 viewed as a major test of whether a Latin-
 American nation can carry out reform within
 the context of existing social and economic
 order. The latest Frei victory gives new
 hope to those who believe such reform is
 possible.
 Many observers of the Chilean scene have
 not been overly concerned by setbacks to
 the Frei program which have occurred from
 time to time, saying, as one here this week
 said, "In'the end Mr. Frei always manages
 to win the battle despite temporary set-
 backs."
 Only time will tell, however, whether Mr.
 Frei has won a lasting victory over dissident
 elements within the Christian Democratic
 Party.
 Mr. Castillo, new head of the party, said
 after assuming the post that he is inter-
 ested in being the leader of all Christian
 Democrats but refrained f om making any
 other statements on the party vote.
 In  line  with  this,  Radomiro  Tomic,

 rather indistinct, and the independence armies fighting for the

 It was not until independence was won and capitalism began to

 Lenin pointed out that any growth of the working-class movement
 and appearance of new fighters and new sections of working people
 "is inevitably accompanied by vacillation in theory and tactics".
 And he called attention to the fact that "the yardstick of an
 imaginary ideal" will get us nowhere and that vacillation should be
 regarded as "a practical movement of ordinary people".
 In other words, what we are dealing with arc growing pains that
 cannot conceivably be removed overnight. But it is also a cogent fact
 that imperialism benefits from differences arising between the
 revolutionary forccs, and especially from differences in the Com-
 munist parties. It is our duty, therefore, to prevent differences from
 obstructing united action against the common enemy. DitTerences
 arising between Communist parties should not impede mutual
 understanding any more than differences between Communists and
 other revolutionaries should impe.tr th - common fight against
 imperialism.
 Experience has shown that open polemics results in senseless
 name-calling and in arbitrary judgments. It serves no useful
 purpose and only aggravates the difficulties. Sometimes, it is true,
 a party has no choice but to express its opinion publicly. We have
 nothing against this. Out we are sure that direct contacts, bilateral
 and multilateral meetings, :a tactful fraternal dialogue and, most
 important of nil, steadfast unity of ncllon, are the best way to further
 mutual understanding.
 The driving force of the revolution in Latin America comprises
 the working class, pcnsants (tire majority of whom in many
 the national bourgeoisie. There are contradictions between than,
 but common interests in the fight against US imperialism and the
 oligarchies predominate. This offers a serviceable basis for tinily and
 call: for closer bonds. Our policy of united action by all anti-
 imncrialist and anti-oligarchic forces builds nn the belief that an
 alliance of workers and peasants, of the proletariat and the non-
 proletarian elements, is the hest possible basis for an enduring and
 militant united front. To make headway, mutual understanding
 lictwccn proletarian and petty-bourgeois revolutionaries is absolutely
 essential.
 The proletariat, the most powerful social class on our continent,
 is still growing. As many as 40 million pcopie (of whom one out of }
 every three is a factory or farm labourer), or more than half the
 gainfully employed population between the Rio Grande and Cape
 Horn, earn a livelihood by selling their labour power. In five
 countries, that is, Mexico, Brazil, Aui'entina, Uruguay and Chile,
 with nearly two-thirds of the total potmtation of Latin America, the
 proletariat is relatively strong, and not in numbers only.
 Communist parties exist in all Latin American countries. Like
 the fraternal parties elsewhere in the world, irrespective of their
 degree of development, they expound ideas that strike terror into
 imperialism, of which they arc the most relentless enemies.
 They arc the bearers of the finest revolutionary traditions of their
 peoples and have acquitted themselves splendidly ire tl " :^'nortant

 This, hop( cr, is inconceivable before a certain process of develop

 yet consider it completed. If, therefore, we were to try and impose a,
 standard' approach, entirely unnecessary difficulties would arise.
 The best way to facilitate unity in defence of the Cuban revolution

 disunites us.

 matter hinges on specific national conditions and on the existence in
 many countries of democratic and popular political forces and of
 objective social realities that fondition a multiplicity of progressive
 trends and parties. The Communist Party of France, for example,
 does not believe that "the one-party system Is essential for the

 opinion.

 problems faced by our movement are settled by agreement between
 the Socialists and Communists on the initiative of one of them. We
 call this joint leadership, which in Chile represents the concrete form
 in which the Communist Party plays its vanguard role.
 It may be that ultimately the Communists and Socialists will form
 a united party. But so far the question has not arisen, and is not
 likely to arise in the foreseeable future, and perhaps may never arise.
 As for the other Latin American countries, it appears that the
 need for united action by Communist parties and other revolutionary
 forces fits in with the need for co-operation at the level of joint
 leadership by those revolutionary forces which, in a definite sense,
 share the function of vanguard.
 A vanguard cannot conceivably be built by arbitrary or synthetic
 means around a leader or a few men who, individually, at least in
 their own opinion, adopt radical standpoints and prepare for
 revolutionary action. The exceptions to this rule only bear this out.
 A vanguard is the result of the fusion of Marxism with, the
 working-class movement, the moulding of revolutionary thought
 (above all among proletarians) and the application of Marxism-
 Leninism to the concrete conditions of a country, that is, the result
 of purposeful activity and of a natural, rather than spontaneous.
 process.
 On the other hand, as Lenin said, it is not enough to call oneself
 the vanguard or the forward contingent; all other contingents must
 be convinced that we really are in the van.
 The Latin American Communist parties were founded at different
 times. They function in different conditions and in different social
 and political situations. Some arc going forward from dissemination
 of scientific socialist ideas to consolidating their bonds with the
 masses, to organising mass struggle, to the phase of intensive social
 and political work which paves the way to the conquest of power,
 to the rapid development of the Latin American parties into the
 guiding force of the revolutionary movement.
 However, the Communists do not consider this the only possible
 perspective. In the name of the proletariat and on the basis of
 Marxism-Leninism, they arc -prepared to raise' to the highest
 possible level co-operation and unity with the other revolutionary
 forces,.

 Soviet Penetration of Nigeria
 The birth of Nigeria on 1 October 1960 was acclaimed by many as
 the entry onto the world scene of a black African state "destined to
 emerge as a major power in Africa."  The British wanted Nigeria to be-
 come their "showpiece" in. West Africa, but a showpiece of good govern-
 ment by Western standards -- a major mistake in the case of Nigeria.
 The country is a collection of diverse nations, tribes and cultures.
 Its people speak three major languages -- Hausa, Yoruba, and Ibo -- and
 about 150 minor languages.   English is the official language, but
 many Nigerians cannot speak it.   Religions make the gap even wider.
 Most of northern Nigeria is Moslem, and its culture comes from centur-
 ies of contact with Arab caravans.   The south is Christian and pagan,
 with a Bantu culture, somewhat modified by European incursions into
 the coastal areas.   British rule has been the only unifying factor in
 Nigeria's past history, and even then the British administered it as
 three units -- the colony of Lagos and the northern and southern pro-
 tectorates.   Since 1960 this loosely knit structure of incompatible
 cultures and racial groups has been held together by a constitution
 written as if intended for a people -united by'Anglo=Saxon traditions-
 and committed to a multiple-party system of government.   Its present
 internal problems were inevitable.   In January 1966 an Ibo officers'
 clique staged a coup, murdering officials and seizing power.   Six
 months later a non-Ibo officers' clique ousted them with additional
 bloodshed.  Each tribal faction called on tribal loyalties for support
 and this inflamed latent passions.   Northerners began to slaughter
 Ibos in their territories -- upwards of 30,000 men, women and children
 who had been living and working in northern cities as civil servants,
 techni6ians and traders were murdered in a barbarous fashion.  About
 two million survivors fled south where an Ibo Colonel named Odumegwu
 Ojukwu led the secessionist movement that in May 1967 created the
 independent state of Biafra.   (For further background data, see Attach-
 ment A.)
 SOVIET BLOC MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
 Soviet efforts to gain a foothold in Africa by supplying arms and
 planes to developing countries inimical to the. West began in Egypt in
 1955 and extended rapidly to Algeria, Guinea, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville)
 and Ghana.   Quick to take advantage of a chaotic situation, the Soviets
 have turned toward Nigeria.   Until last year Moscow never showed it-
 self sympathetic toward the Western-oriented leaders of the Nigerian
 Federation of 1960.   However, after the fighting broke out in July
 1967 between the Federal Military Government (FMG) of Nigeria and the
 secessionist state of Biafra, the Soviet Union was quick to respond to
 the FMG's appeal for assistance.   During the latter part of 1967 the
 Soviets managed to sell over $5 million worth of military equipment

 to the FMG, including 10-12 MIG jet fighters and three patrol boats.
 There are currently about 50 Soviets in Nigeria training Nigerians to
 operate and maintain the equipment.  By the end of August a Nigerian
 jet fighter was already attacking secessionist forces in the Midwestern
 State.
 Other Communist countries have also proffered military and techni-
 cal assistance.  In 1965 Czechoslovakia extended a $14-million line of
 credit to Nigeria and, after the secession, furnished to the FMG six jet
 trainers -- which can also be used as fighters and bombers.   In September
 1967 there were 14 Hungarian civil engineers engaged in roadbuilding and
 river control in northern Nigeria.  Polish pilots now predominate in
 harbor operations.   But through it all the Soviet Union insists that
 the conflict in Nigeria is an internal one and that all that ' the: Soviets
 want is peace and stability for Nigeria!   In October 1967 Soviet Premier
 Kosygin, in a personal message to Maj. Gen. Yakubu Gowon, Nigerian Chief
 of State, stated that he is opposed to any outside interference in
 Africa's internal affairs.
 While the Soviet Union is giving military support to General Gowon's
 Federal Military Government, it is also pursuing its standard tactics of
 penetrating Nigeria from within.  A number of Soviet-Nigerian friendship
 societies have recently been formed in the Western State, the home of
 the Yoruba tribe.  With the withdrawal of the educated Ibos to Biafra,
 the Soviets have found it expedient to cultivate the Yorubas, who are
 now supplanting the Ibos in public office.  Friiendship societies are also
 being formed in the largely Muslim north, where the Soviets undoubtedly
 foresee future ties with the rest of Muslim Africa.
 Moscow is also trying to enlarge its toehold in the Nigerian labor
 movement.   Following the dissolution of all political parties in 1966,
 the pro-Communist "Socialist Workers' and Farmers' Party" formally dis-
 banded, but its weekly organ ADVANCE has been taken over by the pro-
 Moscow Nigerian Trade Union Congress (NTUC) and continues along party
 lines.  On 5 November 1967 ADVANCEpubllshed a glowing message of greet-
 ings to the Soviet Union for its 50th Anniversary and a tribute by the
 head of the Nigerian-Soviet Friendship Society to the great friendship
 shown by the Soviet Union in Nigeria's time of need.
 While openly professing its support for Gowon's government, the Sov-
 i.et,Union is giving its covert support to the extreme Left.   In an October
 1.967 article on Nigeria in the international Communist journal WORLD MARX-
 IST REVIEW, the Soviets praised the banned Socialist Worker's and Farmers'
 Party and claimed that this party and the NTUC are in the forefront of
 the struggle against "feudal and captialist" elements in Nigeria (See
 Attachment B.)

 The Soviets have also stepped up their efforts aimed at the infor-
 mation media.  The Soviet news agency, Novosti, has recently appointed
 a representative in Ibadan and a splinter journalists' organization is
 receiving Communist support.  With the relaxation of FMG import restric-
 tions, there has been an increased influx of Communist literature, which
 can be bought at newstands and bookstores, and which is also distributed
 by the NTUC and affiliated unions.  The Soviets have requested permission
 to increase their Embassy staff in Lagos and have just opened a new
 chancery which is obviously designed for a greatly augmented diplomatic
 force.
 The Soviet Union had long taken special interest in countries that
 supply oil to Western Europe:   Iran, Algeria, Egypt, Syria, Iraq and
 others.   Now it has taken a stake in Nigeria which, before the war broke
 out, was supplying ten per cent of Britain's oil and has rich oil resources
 as yet only partially exploited.   Soviet interest in Nigerian oil became
 apparent in early 1967, following speculation in the American press that
 an independent Eastern Nigeria might give the oil companies better terms
 than they enjoy under existing contracts with the FMG.   Over twenty mil-
 lion tons of oil were produced in Nigeria in 1966, and 63 per cent of that
 in the Eastern Region.   If Biafra remained an independent state, the Sov-
 iet Union's chances of cutting into that vast oil reserve would be negli-
 gib'.e.   Once Moscow had made the decision to support the FMG, it did not
 hesitate to play upon Nigerian suspicions of the United States by linking
 that country's oil interests with Biafra and claiming that the United
 States is supporting the rebel forces with white mercenaries.
 In addition to its oil reserves, the Eastern Region has a palm pro-
 ducts crop that has been bringing in nearly $100 million a year.   Now, of
 course, revenue from both oil and palm products is denied to the FMG.
 The oil reserves of the Midwesternv-Region are at least as large as those
 of the East, although not yet as well developed.   The Western Region re-
 lies largely on its $100 million yearly cocoa crop, and the landlocked,
 North on its $150 million crop of peanuts, which, however, must be moved
 through the East or West to the sea.  While oil and cocoa are Nigeria's
 major exports, its natural resources also include coal, iron, limestone
 and natural gas.   It produces 45 per cent of the world's columbium ore
 -- used in the manufacture of steel alloys.  With a foreign trade amount-
 ing to $1.5 billion in 1966, it is the biggest and richest state in Black
 Africa, and -- with the decline of Western influences -- a natural target
 for Soviet subversion.
 Although the soviets have made a substait3ai:breakthroUghin-Nigeria,
 and their position can be expected to improve at all levels in the future,

 there are still important influences at work against Communist aims.
 General Gowon does not wish to break Nigeria's traditional ties with the
 West, particularly with Great Britain which has resumed military support
 to his government.  In addition both Gowon and his foreign affairs minis-
 ter, Dr. 0. Arikpo, seem fully aware of the dangers inherent in too ser-
 ious a commitment to the Communist camp.  As long as the present govern-
 ment is in power, Western interests will continue to be represented in
 Nigeria and expansion of the Communist subversive base may yet be conk
 tained.

 It was already too late: Foreign

 of the oil operations. moreover, was
 a practical argument for continued

 for the growing troubles, and each
 convinced it was the rightful dictator

 In the six months between that

 of Eastern Nigeria whose influence
 was felt. Ironsi permitted his tribes-

 CPYRGHT
 That the :Ibos were probably more
 qualified than the other big Nigerian{
 tribes to operate the government,
 bureaucracies was particularly galling
 to  their rivals.  Through  almost
 unique tribal open mindedness, the
 Ibos had moved in half a century,
 from primitive paganism to Chisti
 anity, to progressive, educated mod-
 ernism. This angered the increasing-
 ly decadent Yorubas of the Western
 Region, and the feudal, static, fatal-
 istic Moslem Hausas of the North-
 ern Region.
 Y  JUNE  1966, the country's
 fragile framework could no
 longer survive the imbalance of one-
 tribe supremacy. The Ibos were
 moving too fast, too gleefully in
 their search for the secrets of dur-
 able national power, and the keys to
 the safe. Tribal fragmentation was
 the order of the day, and one-tribe
 supremacy was, after all, only a
 warped version of tribal fragmenta-
 tion. A scapegoat had to be found
 for Nigeria's troubles.
 Clearly, the Ibos were the enemy,
 for they represented much that was
 hateful to both the Yorubas and the
 Hausas: They worked together in a
 spirit of mutual self-help, instead of
 clinging together out of mutual sus-
 picion; their upstart peasant vigor
 challenged the clever, subtle sophis-
 tication of the Yorubas and the dig-
 nified tranc, of the Nausas: their
 tribal democracy was almost un-
 African. Particularly tirestm;c was
 the Ibo insistence that political lead-
 ers are stewards of public trust,
 owing their constituents at least a
 shilling's worth of benefit for every
 pound of bribe sent to Switzerland.
 Most disturbing of all was the Ibo
 conviction that there is a future be-
 yond the beginning of the next rainy
 season, and that a man could some-
 how learn to control that future to
 his betterment.
 power, he set about restoring the
 dignity and local-level power of tra-
 ditional chiefs and minor kings in
 the Western (Yoruba) Region. This
 limited gesture was about as far as
 he could go in applying democratic
 thinking to the Yorubas, but its
 tentative success was too much for
 the Northerners.
 Thus, on July 29, 1966-two
 days after a conclave of traditional'
 chiefs whose support he was wooing,
 at which he had decreed that the
 national anthem would be sung at
 the opening and closing of all school
 sessions and.at all public entertain-
 ments-Ironsi was murdered by
 Northern soldiers. Killed with him
 was Colonel Fajuiyi,,his governor of
 the Western Region, and his ally in
 courting the chiefs.
 Each  of  the  major  Nigerian
 tribes is a nation in spirit, and
 bigger than most African countries
 in size: There are about 17 million
 Nausas, 15 million Yorubas and 9
 million Ibos. During the week fol-
 lowing Ironsi's death, it was evident
 that no replacement could he selected
 from these tribes, giving rise to the
 short day of the minority tribe. Lieu-
 tenant Colonel Yakubu Gowon, a
 Christian member of one of Nigeria's
 200-odd smaller tribes, emerged as
 the nominal leader of the military
 government. Gradually Gowon has
 become little more than a miouth-
 piece for the Hausa leaders, who
 still speak of national unity yet say,
 and not always so privately, that
 unity (meaning Northern domina-
 tion) is not possible unless the Ibos
 are either killed or contained in their
 homeland.
 For two months after he became
 Supreme Commander of the Military
 Government of Nigeria, Gowon tried
 to bring sonic semblance of order
 to the country. Then in September
 1966, the Moslem Hausas got down
 to the serious business of extermi-

 Whether the killing stopped sud-
 denly through Gowon's good offices,
 or because it was planned to begin
 and end on a signal from the North-
 ern leaders, is a subject of debate
 to this day in Nigeria. In any event,
 the next six months saw nearly 2
 million Ibos who had over the years
 gone to live in all parts of Nigeria
 flee back to their homeland in tile'
 Eastern Region.
 Disintegration, accelerated by the
 mass killings, was irreversible by
 early  1967.  Foreign  investment
 shrank to almost nothing, ending the
 proliferation of factories that had
 passed for development. Trade
 dropped to about half its normal
 level; Nigeria was no longer viewed
 as a prime market for toothpaste,
 plastic shoes, used clothing and all
 the other manifestations of Western
 prescriptions for African progress.

 are basically capitalists and hope

 presence clouds the situation and
 minimizes U.S. effectiveness in any
 effort to knock heads together and
 bring peace. Nigeria would be a sad
 and pointless place for a new East-

 lot it is: British-owned oil companies,
 trading companies, raw-materials ex-

 and British investment still dominate
 the Nigerian economy, All of this
 means more pious talk of unity for
 unity's sake.
 Biafra has made some strange
 friends in its struggle for embryonic
 progressivism. Portugal has become
 the principal channel through which
 arms and supplies reach Biafra, and
 a telecommunications link through
 Lisbon keeps Biafra in tenuous touch
 with the world. The crisis of Africa's
 biggest nation tends to divert atten-
 tion from Portugal's unpopular colo-
 nial holdings elsewhere in Africa;
 and for the moment, Portuguese help
 is as acceptable as any to the des-
 perate Biafrans. Rhodesian planes
 have also been reported in occasional
 traffic into and out of Biafra, and
 Rhodesia's motive may be similar to
 Portugal's.
 French prospectors have reported-
 ly found a particularly rich oil field
 in northwestern Biafra, which may
 account for the sale to Biafra of
 French helicopters and arms. The
 extent of the French presence in
 Biafra is not fully known, since the
 world press reports the war almost.
 exclusively from Lagos. It is known,
 though, that the Biafran government
 has been promising mineral and raw
 material concessions to its new
 friends in order to get still more
 tools and money for its war. Like a
 low-rated boxer selling more per-
 centages of himself than exist, Bi-
 afra is fair game for fiscal adven-
 turers, who stand to gain a great deal
 for low stakes if independence can
 be brought off.

 Federal government from making
 any serious efforts to effect peace in
 Nigeria. That Nigeria's principal
 human resource for development-
 the Ibo tribe-niay be decimated
 while the ono acts out its charade
 in perfect righteousness is one of the
 unfortunate contradictions of Africa
 today.
 No African nation has recog-
 n;zed Biafra, and no other nation
 cart until the black countries make
 the first move. Such are the rules of
 the world game of diplomatic pa-
 tronization.
 Biafra possesses all the elements
 of a viable political and economic
 entity. Its population is certainly
 large enough, it has plenty of raw
 materials to trade in the world mar-
 kets, and in aggressive human core.
 The oppo ite argument, for unite. is;
 equally convincing. A big Nigcria
 could in time, become a nucleus of a
 huge federation encompassing its
 landlocked neighbors to the north
 and perhaps its smaller neighbors
 to the west-the first real possibility'
 of a United States of Africa. Yet
 what is needed is not an immediate
 determination of the merits of seces-
 sion vs. unity but rather a cessation
 of fighting, and most particularly of,
 genocidal aggression against the Ibos.
 In terms of world politics, the
 positions of the various powers:
 toward the Nigerian tragedy are
 orthodox and perfectly correct-in'
 other words, based on their own self-
 interest. The hypocrisies involved
 in the public descriptions of those
 positions are irritating to a number
 of observers, though, and must be
 galling to the Biafrans, principally
 the Ibos, who know they are being
 penalized in the name of unity fop

 able to move out of stasis.
 The heedless inrush of machinery

 adventurers after Nigerian indepen-

 cash and guarantees-was not, some-
 how, seen as foreign intervention.-,

 stop the current slaughter in Nigeria

 the expectation that minimal force
 would bring the rebels to heel. Oju-
 kwu not only held off Federal attacks
 but shocked the Lagos government
 by immediately seizing the Midwest
 Region and grabbing nearly $10 mil-
 lion in cash from the banks and busi-
 ness houses there. An earnest war
 was obviously called for, and effec-
 tive control of the Federal military
 forces was lifted from Gowon by the
 Northern Officers.
 Now, after nearly half a year of
 fighting, Federal troops have found
 it impossible to establish military
 supremacy over the stubborn Bia-
 frans, even though they have retaken
 the Midwest and established some
 measure of control over approxi-
 niately, 25 per cent of Biafra's land
 area..Ojukwu, meanwhile, has been
 given a mandate by his Consultative
 Assembly, representing 14 million
 people from all tribes in Biafra, to
 continue the fighting. With the lbos
 feeling compression, and with the
 other tribes in Biafra having com-
 mittcd themselves to secession be-
 yond the point of no return, the
 Federal troops are facing an elusive
 and difficult opponent. Formal mili-
 tary action has increasingly degen-
 erated into unconnected guerrilla
 skirmishes.
 Enugu, the Biafran capital, has
 fallen to Federal forces-largely be-
 cause of a sellout by a handful of
 Biafran officers who decided the
 situation was ripe for a Communist
 coup. (They have since been ex-
 ecuted by Ojukwu.) But capitals are
 portable, especially the Biafran capi-

 Ibo problem and dolefully listing
 names of lbo leaders marked for

 show no signs of giving up, it is be-
 cause they at least know they are
 literally fighting for their lives.
 Therein lies the major hypocrisy
 of the Nigerian disaster: The public
 posture of nearly everyone else re-
 flects a pious concern for Nigerian
 unity, as if this were still possible.
 Diplomats, businessmen and other
 foreigners familiar with the situation
 know very well that the loos, and
 perhaps other tribes in Biafra. face
 extermination in large numbers; that
 in the event of a Federal victory in
 the civil war the Eastern survivors
 will be pariahs. Gowon and his
 government maintain that Nigerian
 unity is the sole issue in the civil war;
 they claim such matters as the clash
 between Moslem and Christian
 ethics and suppression of the uppity
 lbos do not exist.
 That the civil war has turned puni-
 tive is undeniable; that there is una-
 nimity on the purpose and extent of
 the punishment to be meted out to
 the Ibos is debatable. Gowon's per-
 sonal attitude seems more petulance
 than hatred; his field commanders
 seem committed to mass slaughter.
 But no matter who prevails, there is
 little chance that the Ibos will be
 welcomed back as real participants
 in a unified Nigeria, should there
 ever again be a unified Nigeria. Em-
 ployment is a critical issue in the
 country, and the Ibos, having been
 displaced in their jobs by Yorubas
 and members of other tribes, are not
 likely to find postwar Nigeria re?-
 ccptive to their aggressive penetra-
 .
 ducer of crude oil. Sixty per cent of
 the Nigerian oil reserves so far dis-
 covered are in the Eastern Region,
 and 60 per cent of that is in iboland.
 So talk of unity means, among other
 things, talk of who is to control the
 oil.
 Religious conversions from ani-
 mism in West Africa are being won
 by the Moslems, seven to three. To
 deny that there is religious involve-
 ment in the Nigerian impasse is
 fatuous nonsense, especially when it
 is realized that two directly opposite
 -ways of looking at life are in clash
 between the North and the East:
 Moslem fatalism and Christian self-
 determination. A sort of jihad is in
 progress, no mistake.
 Tribal supremacy is not in doubt
 for the moment. The loos could gain
 supremacy only through complete
 military victory, and that is all but
 impossible, considering the array of
 Nigerian and world forces against
 them. The Yorubas, through a half-
 century of internal bickering and dis-
 organization, have forfeited their
 claim to forceful influence, especially
 now that Nigerian military power is
 virtually a Northern monopoly. The
 Hausas and their intermingled Fulani
 remnants are supreme again.
 No world power seems willing
 to intervene to stop the war, to mini-
 mize the gathering genocide. Amer-
 ica has abdicated its growing influ-
 ence in Nigeria to the British on the
 thin, vestigial pretext that it is in the
 British sphere of influence, and that
 a special relationship between Wash-
 ington and London precludes Amer-
 ican interference. The American cop-

 The conflict had been maturing for some time. In fact, its roots
 can be traced to the divide-and-rule policy customarily followed by
 British imperialism in colonial territories. Its repercussions were
 painfully felt after Nigeria became independent in 1960. The ruling
 feudal and capitalist elements fomented communal strife, pursued a
 reactionary policy that left foreign-monopoly control intact and
 aggravated the poverty of the people. These factors, in the aggregate,
 arc responsible for the present tragedy.
 In February, the New York Times had this to say to potential
 Anerican investors: "The Federal Republic of Nigeria possesses
 abundant human and natural resources. Moreover, Nigeria main-
 tains an open-door policy towards foreign capital ... and has the
 largest and fastest growing market in Africa."

 Iberia, as the catty telegraph rightly stated on
 August 15, 1967, was to be turned into a "'show-window' of
 successful devolution from colonial paternalism to the responsible
 exercise of self-government". Independence was hedged off with
 reservations that safeguarded the interests of the imperialist mono-
 polies, which continue to operate just as they did in the colonial
 days.
 So much so, that practically the entire economy is controlled by
 the United Africa Company, a subsidiary of the great Unilever
 monopoly. Its operations extend from production of primary
 products to the clothing industry and retail trade, and together with
 other British firms it has cornered the supply of imported foods and
 consumer goods. The country's finances arc controlled by two
 British banks, Barclays and the Bank of West Africa.

 others are prospecting for oil, and still others are actually producing
 and exporting oil.
 The whole profit structure rests on rich natural resources and
 cheap labour, and to maintain that structure the imperialists have
 trained a cadre of bureaucrats and politicians.
 The foreign-monopoly stranglehold, the policy of the feudal
 chiefs, the compradore and venal bureaucracy have sharply aggra-
 vated social conflicts. The gap between the privileged minority and
 the poverty-striken majority is steadily widening. And in recent
 years the feudal and capitalist elements, supported by foreign Big
 Business, have maintained an offensive against living standards
 through wage freezes and confiscation of communal land tilled by
 the peasant farmers. The result has been more poverty and more
 unemployment.
 The working people have never accepted this and through their
 trade unions have been fighting to change the situation. The

 Nigeria, but General Gowon realised that, in this complex situation,
 his administration could survive only if it had the backing of the
 public, and if it curbed the omnipotence of the foreign monopolies.
 The ban on the political parties was not lifted, though many
 political detainees were released, among them Obafemi Awolowo,
 the West-Nigerian radical leader.
 The new government announced it would encourage economic
 and cultural co-operation with the socialist countries. For one thing
 it envisaged a substantial increase in trade with the USSR, Poland,
 Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and co-operation with these
 countries on oil refining, iron and steel and other projects.
 The Nigerians attach importance to the recent Soviet visit of their
 Commissioner for Information and Labour, Mr. Anthony Enahoro,
 and to the signing of a cultural agreement. Advance (September 2)
 commented that the visit "not only strenthened the relationship
 between the USSR and Nigeria but also opened a new era of
 friendliness and mutual understanding between our two countries".

 The imperialists retaliated by stepping up subversion in an
 attempt to sever off the oil-rich regions. They adroitly exploited
 tribal tension, always part of Nigerian life.
 Nigeria is inhabited by numerous tribes, the biggest of which are
 the Hausa, Ibo and Yoruba. The Hausa, followers of Islam, are
 concentrated in the North, whereas the Yoruba and Ibo are con-
 centrated in the predominantly Christian South. Originally the
 North formed a separate region, while the South was divided into
 three--the Western (including the Federal District of Lagos), the
 mid-West and Eastern regions.
 Distribution, of the population, according to the latest census
 figures published in the Nigerian Sunday Times in August 1964, is as
 follows :
 Northern Nigeria ..    ..    ..   20,758,875
 Eastern Nigeria  ..          ..   12,394,462
 Western Nigeria  ..               10,265,846

 Lagos District   ..    ..    ..      665,246
 All Nigeria      ..    ..    ..   55,620,268
 The Northern Region, as will be seen from the table, predomin-
 ated. Nor is that accidental, for prior to colonialisation the North
 was an agglomeration of feudal states with which the British com-
 pacted to exploit the people and the natural resources through a
 system of indirect administration, that is, through the feudal emirs
 and sultans. This tended to keep alive the old, backward structure.
 In the South, direct rule encouraged the development of capitalist
 relations, the rise of industry and towns, a national bourgeoisie and
 a working class and, in the final analysis, a powerful national-
 liberation movement.

 an Easterner, abo esh  t e eu a system. inc a sultans and emirs,
 alarmed at the prospect of lbo rule and loss of their privileges,
 engineered a series of massacres in which thousands of Easterners
 were killed and their homes sacked. Then, in July, came another
 military coup: Ironsi was overthrown and killed, and Major-
 General Yakubu Gowon, a Northerner, established a military
 government. The Eastern Region governor, Colonel Ojukwu,
 refused to recognise the new regime, though there was no indication
 of what policy it would follow. This precipitated a new series of anti-
 lbo attacks, in the course of which, according to press reports, not
 less than 30,000 people were killed. Needless to say, this inflamed
 tribal passions. About two million Easterners fled from the North.
 But was war inevitable? Nigerian progressives say it could have
 been avoided. In one of its August issues, Advance printed a letter
 by Chukwuma Nzeogwu, organiser of the progressive January 1966
 revolution, to Tunji Otegbeye, General Secretary of the banned
 Socialist Workers' and Farmers' Party: "I do realise that each
 component portion of our hapless Federation is in itself a little
 federation. This is all the more reason why the solution 'of the
 problem of nationalities should have been tackled in the same
 manner as the USSR dealt with its own nationalities. We must
 continue to preach this idea in preparation for the day when the
 people can fully liberate themselves through a popular revolution."
 The letter was written in Enugu, the Eastern capital, at the height,,
 of the chauvinist hysteria following the proclamation of the indepen-
 dence of Biafra.
 Supported by the progressive forces, the Federal government
 made several attempts to preserve the Federation. In January,
 General Gowon had a meeting (in Ghana) with the governors of all
 the regions. Their communiques emphasised the need to '"preserve
 the political unity of the country". Things

 imperialist powers as hostile. There have been protests from
 different circles. The pro-government Morning Post noted recently
 that Britain and the US were gravely impairing their prestige and
 would henceforth find it hard indeed to win back Nigerian friendship
 through "aid".
 Nigeria's patriots, notably its working class, are campaigning for
 territorial integrity and demanding effective measures to block sup-
 port for the separatists. Wahab Goodluck, President of the Nigerian
 Trades Union Congress, has declared that the task of the labour
 movement is to preserve Nigerian unity.
 And a trade union programme to that end calls for nationalisation
 of oil companies that refuse to pay taxes to the Federal government,
 for measures to stop the espionage activities of US and British
 organisations and consulates, organisation of volunteer security
 detachments and permission for the Trades Union Congress to rally
 the workers against imperialist conspiracies.
 In Eastern Nigeria itself, many favour national unity, and have
 been drawn into the separatist movement under pressure. The
 revolutionary traditions of the working class, which is least of all
 subject to chauvinist influence, are very much alive in Enugu, Port.
 Harcourt and other parts of Biafra. The Trades Union Congress and
 the banned Socialist Workers' and Farmers' Party enjoy wide
 influence too. This is how the situation is described by Tunji
 Otegbeye: "It is true that the forces of tribal chauvinism have risen
 to control the affairs of the Eastern Region of our country; that
 secession has been popularised through the radio and the press. But,
 all the information reaching us here indicates that the common
 people do not bclioe that the ansmcr to our teething probtcros is
 Balkanisation of our country."
 Progressive opinion and Communists the stiorld over are deeply
 disturbed by developments. They hope and beliese that Nigeria's
 patriots, its working class and the people generally kill put an end
 to the fratricidal swear and presersc Nigeria's unity. Peace and unity
 is the first step towards a democratic ,tructure and a just solution
 of the social and national problems that continue to beset Africa's
 biggest country.

 Problems Besetting Hanoi and the Viet Cong
 For the Communist leaders of North Vietnam, 1967 was a year charac-
 terized by more failures than successes and beset with problems of increas-
 ing severity.   In the area of population control, which most observers
 recognize as vital to ultimate victory and lasting peace, the Communist
 forces continued to suffer a steady loss.   Captured enemy documents orig-
 inally revealed that the Communists lost control over one million people
 between mid-1965 and mid-1966.   It has since been estimated, on the basis
 of population control statistics, that another million persons deserted
 the Communist cause in 1967.   Some of the "desertions" were the result of
 the extension of friendly areas of control, but most were caused by the
 flight of people from enemy-controlled areas.   Many fled the dangers
 caused by military operations against the guerrilla forces.   Disenchant-
 ment with their treatment by the Viet Cong -- who increasingly expected
 food, shelter, intelligence and tax money -- was a major reason for the
 population's swing away from the Viet Cong as were the prospects of a more
 secure life under the protection of the South Vietnamese Government, and
 the appeal of the Government's economic and social development programs.
 One of these, the Revolutionary Development (RD) program trains 59-
 man teams to go into hamlets all over South Vietnam to teach the people
 about farming, the need for education, medical and sanitation techniques,
 etc.   The RD cadres have been increasingly successful in helping the
 people and often in providing resources for the way to a better life.   At
 the end of 1965 there were 3,000 such team workers, by December 1966 there
 were 24,000 and by mid-1967 35,000.  By the end of 1968 it is anticipated
 that more than 60,000 RD workers will have graduated from the National
 Training Center at Vung Tau and will be at work in the field trying to
 build a new  and better Vietnam.   A measure of their success was illus-
 trated this spring when 4,500 of South Vietnam's 12,500 hamlets were suffi-
 ciently secure to hold the first round of free elections.
 The Chieu Hoi ("open arms") defector program encountered unprece-
 dented success in the first half of 1967, winning over more Viet Cong
 defectors in six months than it had in the whole of 1966.   By November
 1967 over 25,000 Viet Cong had defected.*  Captured enemy documents have
 revealed great concern on the part of the enemy leadership over the inroads
 of the Chieu Hoi program on their manpower as well as the effect of the
 RD program on their population base.   The RD cadres are high on the list
 of targets for assassination by the Viet Cong and the intelligence given
 to the South Vietnamese Government by Hoi Chanh (ralliers to the Govern-
 ment) is a cause for continuing concern to enemy leaders.   A link between

 ther.

 these two government programs has been the willingness of an increasing
 number of Hoi Chanh to work in the RD program.
 One problem inevitably breeds another, and the Communists' shrinking
 area of population control markedly reduced their ability to extract food,
 shelter, protection and tax money from the population.   The amount of intel-
 ligence they were able to gather via the civilian population also dwindled
 with a steady reduction in their effectiveness.   An increase in the bru-
 tality exercised to keep the population under control only served to alie-
 nate the people more and eventually this loss of influence was felt in
 fewer recruitments for the Viet Cong fighting forces.  As far as can be
 learned from Viet Cong defectors, the enemy, in the early days, had little
 difficulty in recruiting sufficient manpower in South Vietnam to fill the
 ranks of existing Viet Cong units and to activate new units as well.  By
 mid-1966 the Viet Cong was recruiting an estimated 7,000 guerrillas per
 month.   However, their waning population control and the increased Allied
 military pressure have greatly reduced the Viet Cong's ability to recruit,
 and between January and May 1967 their recruiting average was only about
 3,500 per month.   To bolster their dropping numbers, the enemy was forced
 to find recruits somewhere and considerable evidence points to the increas-
 ing enlistment of women and young boys.
 The supply of fighting men from North Vietnam, which averaged about
 8,000 during the first six months of 1966, dropped to an estimated 5,000
 for the same period in 1967.  Allied bombing has made infiltration of
 North Vietnamese troops into South Vietnam more difficult and certainly more
 hazardous, but that is only one portion of the problem.   North Vietnam has
 great numbers of able-bodied men available, but over half a million must
 be used constantly to repair damage caused to North Vietnam's vital trans-
 port arteries by Allied bombing in order to keep up the flow of imported
 materials on which their entire war machine depends.   That fact eliminates
 at least 300,000 able-bodied men from military duty.   Other major drains
 on manpower are the constantly increasing need for troops to man coastal
 defenses, heavy artillery batteries, and more than 7,000 anti-aircraft gun
 sites, and the growing need for army and security forces to maintain inter-
 nal. security.   It is suspected that the North Vietnamese Army leaders will
 inevitably be driven to drafting younger men and then boys as well as
 women to keep their fighting units close to minimum strength.
 Closely related to Communist difficulties in maintaining troop
 strengths are Communist difficulties in supplying the troops they do have
 with rice, clothing, medicines and a variety of other essentials.   Hanoi's
 agricultural and industrial output has shrunk to such a minute fraction of
 its former volume, that it is now dependent upon the Communist bloc for
 most of these civil requirements as well as virtually all its military
 supplies.   Supplies traveling overland can come only through Communist
 China, whose internal discord and running argument with the USSR have caused
 innumerable stoppages of badly needed supplies for-Hanoi.  Allied bombing

 of the area close to the China border compounds transportation diffic,i
 ties as does the mountainous terrain of the frontier area.   Allied bor:
 of the areas close to Haiphong (the major seaport) has caused Haiphong's
 virtual isolation from the rest of the country and goods leaving it since
 October of 1967 have had to be ferried laboriously across each of the
 many waterways.   Godowns quickly filled to overflowing and the congestion
 has become so serious that valuable goods have been left in the open
 streets.
 As for supply of foodstuffs, numerous captured documents, prisoners,
 and defectors have reported that food is increasingly scarce, that many
 of the rice growing areas formerly used by the Viet Cong have beeniover-
 run by Government troops and that the population is increasingly loath
 to pay higher taxes or to produce food upon demand.   And the increased
 demands have served to alienate more of the population with the result
 that the Viet Cong has a decreased base from which to derive support.
 The Communist difficulties are interlocking and feed upon one another
 in other ways as well.   The population swing against the Viet Cong result-
 ed in a considerable reduction in the intelligence furnished the Viet Cong
 which resulted in a poorer military showing.   A concomitant increase in
 intelligence flowing to the Allied troops has, in turn, been of consider-
 able military help.
 In 1967 the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam
 suffered heavier casualties than in any previous year (92,000 KIA by
 actual body count in 1967 as compared to 58,000 in 1966), they saw their
 supposedly impregnable base areas overrun in large-scale operations (such
 as Cedar Falls and Junction City), they lost immense quantities of arms
 and foodstuffs, abandoned quantities of top secret military and political
 documents and saw the destruction of literally miles of laboriously con-
 structed underground tunnels.
 1967 also saw a steady decline in the desertion rate from the South
 Vietnamese army and a steady increase in'that of the Communist forces.
 The Communist forces are also losing greater numbers in combat -- more
 than four times as many men as all the allied forces combined; Communist
 losses reached an alltime high in January 1968 with 5000 enemy troops
 killed in two weeks.   In 1965 the South Vietnamese Army was losing three
 weapons for each Communist weapon they captured.   By late 1967 they were
 capturing four Communist weapons for each one they.lost.
 There is no question that one of the telling factors in the declin-
 ing combat effectiveness of the Communist forces has been the growing mili-
 tary maturity of the South Vietnamese Army (ARVN).   The ARVN now has para-
 military forces.   The ARVN has made more contact with the enemy and in-
 flicted more losses than ever before and U.S. observers are quick to
 point out that the South Vietnamese soldier is shouldering more of the
 heavy combat burden with every passing month.   (See Hanson Baldwin article,
 attached, for details.)

 Tied in with the Communists' declining fortunes is a propaganda prob-
 lem, a weakness, that is being interpreted in some quarters as the major
 influence on their future military course.  Whereas Communist forces
 achieved 13 significant military victories in 1965 and four in 1966, there
 were none in 1967.   The end of 1967 was characterized by heavy concentra-
 tions of Communist troops (principally at Dak To in October and Loc Ninh
 in November) who sought, with what appeared to be suicidal desperation,
 a military victory.   "Human wave" attacks followed one upon the other,
 with appalling losses against an enemy in an obviously vastly superior
 position on land and in the air.   The lunacy of these attacks can be inter-
 preted, in light of the mounting difficulties facing the Communist forces
 in 1968, as a dramatic illustration of North Vietnam's anxiety to secure
 an improved position from which to negotiate an end to the war.   The
 Communist military offensive undertaken in early January may be a prelude
 to a diplomatic offensive by Hanoi to start as soon as it is possible to
 do so without its appearing to be the result of a military defeat.   If this
 speculation is correct, the enemy's belated willingness to sue for peace,
 or at least to commence negotiations, constitutes the strongest evidence
 of increasing Communist military weakness.

 KOREAN CHRONOLOGY
 A series of wartime agreements between U.S.,
 Britain, China and the U.S.S.R. led to the
 reestablishment of Korea as a free and independent
 state.   The Soviets occupied a portion of Korea
 from the 38th Parallel north, while the U.S.
 occupied the South.
 A Joint Soviet/American Commission failed to
 reach agreement on the formation of a Korean
 government. The U.S. referred the matter to the
 United Nations General Assembly in September
 1947.    Elections sponsored by the UN were held
 in May 1948.   The North Koreans refused to par-
 ticipate and established their own government.
 The UN subsequently declared the Republic of
 Korea to be the legitimate Government of Korea.
 The Americans and Soviets withdrew their troops.
 1949-1950                      The UN established a new commission on Korea to
 'work for reunification of the country, in the
 light of developments "which might otherwise
 involve military conflict in Korea."
 December 1949-January 50 Mao Tse-tung conferred with Stalin in Moscow.   A
 Sino-Russian Treaty of Fri ndship and Mut}zal
 Assistance was signed.   Allegedly the decision
 to attack the South was made at this time.
 25 June 1950                   A force of 60,000 North Koreans crossed 38th
 Parallel*  The U.S. requested UN action and UN
 forces were commited to Korea.
 October 1950                   Chinese CpDunists began infiltrating thousands
 of troops into North Korea.
 November 1950                  200,000 Chinese troops smashed across the 38th
 parallel in a massive drive which split and
 trapped UN forces and brought Chinese forces in
 South Korea to a fighting strength of 400,000.
 14 December 1950               The UN General Assembly approved a resolution for
 the creation of a Cease Fire Committee to negoti-
 ate! a compromise solution.   Communist China was
 invited to the UN to discuss peace terms.   No
 compromise was reached.
 1 February 1951                The UN General Assembly condemned Communist China
 as the aggressor in Korea.

 The truce talks dragged on; all major issues
 were agreed upon except the voluntary repatria-

 UN forces were continually denounced for alleged
 violations of the truce.   The war continued and
 the Chinese, despite their agreement not to do
 so, increased their troop strength to a total

 with a total of 450,000 UN forces, which remained

 Saigon Controls Two-Third's
 Of the Country, Computer Says
 SAIGON, Dec. 1 (AP) --,schools available, development
 Two-thirds of South Vietnam's
 17 million people now live in
 secure areas controlled by the
 Saigon government, the U.S.
 mission said today.
 The U.S. Embassy unveiled
 its new computerized Hamlet
 Evaluation System and said
 .the "secure" population has
 increased more than a million
 since last January.
 Ambassador   Robert   W.
 Komer, who heads the Ameri-
 can side of the pacification
 program, told a news confer-
 ence that the computer system
 provides a detailed monthly
 check on the campaign for the
 allegiance of the South Viet-
 namese living in the country's
 12,800 cities and hamlets.
 A checklist on 18 major
 Criteria Is filled out on comput-
 er cards for each hamlet by
 the U.S. district adviser and
 put through computers in Sai-
 gon and Bangkok, he said.
 In addition to hamlet securi.

 tion  on  such -matters  as

 projects, health facilities and
 even whether the hamlet chief
 sleeps in the hamlet at night.
 Pointing out that human
 evaluators previously weren't
 even sure how many hamlets
 were In South Vietnam, Komer
 said the new system is "not
 even near perfect, but it's
 more objective, more systemat-
 ic and it focuses on the key as-
 pects of pacification."
 "I think It's getting a pretty
 accurate picture," he added.
 The system has been in use
 since January.
 Only 8650-or 63 per cent of
 South Vietnam's 12,600 ham-
 lets can be evaluated. The rest
 are controlled by the Viet.
 cong. But Komer said popula.
 tion figures are more impor.
 tant than the number of ham-
 lets considered secure because
 the hamlets vary In population
 from 50 to 20,000 persons. Sai.
 gon and other large cities are
 classed as a group of hamlets.
 He  said  government-con-
 trolled hamlets tend to be larg-
 er and more prosperous since
 the government gives higher
 priority to more heavily popu-
 lated areas.
 Secure  hamlets  now  em-
 brace 66.6 per cent, of the pop-
 ulation. Contested hamlets ac-
 count for 16.2 per cent of the
 population, while another 17.2
 per cent lives under Vietcong
 control, according to the com-
 puter report.
 When the system was put
 into operation last January,
 Komer said, 62.1 per cent of
 the population lived in secure,
 hamlets, 18.5.per cent were in.
 contested areas and 19.4 per
 cent were under Vietcong con?
 trol. The population then was
 estimated at 16.4 million.
 Vietcong control Is highest
 in the Mekong Delta, where it
 runs 27.6 per cent, according
 to the report.
 In the embattled Military
 Corps I area just south of 'the
 Demilitarized Zone, 28.5 per
 cent of the people are said to
 be under Vietcong control.

 `Arvin' Is a Mixed Bag
 By HANSON W. BALDtVIN
 SAIGON, South Vietnim -
 Units of the -South Vietnamese
 Army moved into a few of the
 new bunkers and strong points
 of the "McNamara Line" south
 of the demilitarized zone last
 week. At the same time, three
 Vietnamese  ranger  battalions
 took over .from the U. S. 199th
 Brigade the principal burden of
 providing a pacification screen
 around Saigon.
 These and many other indices
 pointed to what some-but by
 no means all-U. S. officers feel
 is an increasing Vietnamese mili-
 tary maturity. Everyone agrees'
 that  greatly  improved  Viet-;
 namese combat effectiveness-
 better leadership, better disci-
 pline, less corruption, a lower
 desertiol rate and better morale
 -acre essential If a military vic-
 tory is to be won and confirmed
 by the political victory of pacifi-

 The expanded responsibilities
 of the Vietnames armed forces
 are, In a sense, a test of the
 degree of improvement in these
 forces since their low point in
 1965. That they have improved
 is  unquestionable;  that  they
 have a long way to go Is also
 unquestionable. The armed forces
 now number about 750,000 men
 and ' women and include many
 different types of military and,
 paramilitary units.
 Conscious of Clamor
 American officers in Vietnam
 are conscious of the public
 clamor In the United states'
 about "Arvin"-the Army of the
 Republic of Vietnam. But they t
 feel that many unfair criticisms:
 and  sweeping  generalizations
 have been made, and that since';
 U. S. combat units have been
 In Vietnam, the American press!
 has not reflected adequately the:
 heavy combat burden shouldered
 by the Vietnamese.
 "The truth is," one observer
 put it, "that everything you say;
 about the Vietnamese forces Is
 true."
 The armed forces are a mixed '
 bag. They are spotty and uneven;
 militia; some of the best units
 have fought the Vietcong and
 the North Vietnamese to a stand-
 still. In some units the war stops
 at siesta time and the dark of
 the night is a time to sleep, not
 to patrol. But not In all.
 Some uniti repeat the same
 mistakes they have made time,
 after time in the past. But not'
 all.
 Some units loot the villages
 they are supposed to, defend.
 But not all.
 Some units are commanded by
 officer politicians. But not all.
 There are highly encouraging
 bnd very discouraging signs.
 Perhaps the most encouraging
 sign is that there have been few

 1967. Two years ago, V.C. Main
 Force units used to give "Arvin"
 units a bloody nose and Govern-
 ment forces left stores or bun-
 dted of bodies on the fields. It
 IS true, of course, that more.
 %1J. S. troops and increased air.`
 rind artillery support for "Arvin"
 jhave been major factors in the
 `improved performance.
 Nevertheless,  even  in  the
 Mekong  Delta  where   three
 "Arvin" divisions have shoul-
 dered the principal burden, the
 Vietcong units have lost more
 than they have gained. Two local
 V.C. battalions have been de-
 activated, and even the once.
 feared and famous Taydo batal-j
 lion,  which  operated  near`
 Cantho, has been worn down- to
 a fraction Of its former strength.
 Leadership is Vital
 The effectiveness of South
 Vietnamese units is almost a
 direct reflection of their leader-
 ship. And in Vietnam-an unde-
 veloped country with only 13
 years of independent life and
 more than 20 years of war-
 leadership is thin indeed in both
 .the North and the South.
 Thus, the results vary from
 the sublime to the ridiculous
 from unit to unit. In the Camau
 Peninsula, a battalion of the 21st
 Division-regarded as one of the
 patrols regularly to five "clicks"
 (kilometers)  beyond  its  base
 camp. But in the Vungtau coastal
 region, the vessels of the Viet-
 namese Navy's in-shore patrol
 usually lie snugly in harbor at
 night, the very time when V.C.
 blockade running sampans may
 land their arms.
 There are many things being
 done to change this very mixed
 picture. A list of ineffective
 "Arvin" officers at many levels
 has been prepared: some have
 even been relieved and a few
 court martialed.  An  inspector
 general of the South Vietnamese
 Army is now checking effective-
 ness of units and commanders.
 Retraining programs and mobile
 'training  teams  are operating
 throughout South Vietnam with
 regular and regional and popular
 forces. Enlisted men have been
 promoted from their ranks; new
 sources of officers and noncoms
 are being tapped, and slowly,
 very slowly, the French Man-
 darin system which tended to.
 restrict  commissions . to  the
 upper classes is being broken.
 Many Reforms
 New laws have broadened the
 draft; a rice ration, pay raises,
 a better accouhting system and
 stiffer penalties have reduced
 the desertion rate by about 37
 per cent this year as compared
 to last year. Even so, desertions
 .still account for about 71 per
 cent of the total manpower
 losses In the South Vietnamese
 armed  forces,  and  the  slow
 struggle to make all the units
 combat effective is only In Its
 first' chapter.
 Nevertheless the process has
 started. "Amin" has rebounded
 from the dismal 'days of 1965,
 and next year the process of re-
 equiping the "Arvin" forces --
 which has already started with
 the assignment of M-l6 rifles to.
 the First Division---will bebroad-.
 ened and expedited.
 their leadership varies from ex-
 cellent to execrable; some of the      better "Arvin" divisions engaged

 WASHINGTON POST
 8 January 1968 (8)
 tyening is comprehensible, in
 fact, if you do not grasp the
 amply documented fact that
 the efforts the enemy troops
 are now being asked to
 make  are  regularly  pre-
 sented as climactic, with the
 assurance that they will be
 followed by peace-by-coalt-
 tidn."
 THE GENERAL dissemi-
 nation of this happy assur-
 ance in Vietnam is the rea-
 son, in turn, for the convic-
 tion of the informed group
 in Washington that Hanoi is
 getting ready to offer nego-
 tiations, although only on
 Hanoi Seen Aiming for Talks,
 ,On I'Lled Terms, After Attack
 AFTER LONG years of
 ,waiting, almost everyone in
 the narrow circle of in-
 formed persons is 'at last
 convinced that Ilanoi is on
 the verge of a major drive
 for a negotiated settlement
 in Vietnam. Yet there is lit-
 ,tie rejoicing, for two quite
 different reasons.
 The first and simplest rea-
 son is the kind of enemy ef-
 fort that must be expected
 in the very near `future,
 which will be aimed to ere-
 ate a favorable climate for
 the kind of talks that Hanoi
 .obviously wants. This can,
 perhaps, cost all too many
 American and allied lives.
 For  example,  Khesanh,
 the most westerly of the Ala-
 rines' fortified outposts on
 the DAIZ, is now held by
 less than two battalions of
 :troops. It enjoys overwhelm-
 ;ing artillery support, but at
 this season it Is very hard to
 resupply. And no less than
 Six regiments of the North
 Vietnamese home army-the
 equivalent of two divisions
 .-have been moving into
 place around this outpost
 held by less than two batta-
 lions,
 The
 temporarygjy~i
 of Khesanh is imaginable.
 Gen.  Westmoreland  may
 perhaps order evacuation in
 order to throw the very
 slow-moving enemy off bal-
 ance for a while, anchoring
 the western end of the Ma-
 rine line on the DA'IZ on the
 more easily defensible rock-
 pile position. But there is no
 sign of any such plan.
 Other less important posi-
 tions like the airfield at
 Banmethout and even Plei-
 ku, where the attack on
 the U.S. barracks touched
 off the Northern bombing,
 are also beginning to be
 menanced, albeit by less
 substantial  enemy  forces
 than those around Khesanh.
 There have been a whole se-
 ries  of  sapper  and                                            even
 ground force attacks on dis-
 ,tricts and provincial capitals
 in South Vietnam in recent
 weeks. These will no doubt
 continue throughout   this
 month'at a minimum.  .
 ALL THIS PAST or fu-
 'ture enemy activity can only
 be put in perspective by the
 captured documents summa-
 rized in the last report in
 Hanoi's own terms. As to
 the motives for such an
 offer,  they  are  obvious
 enough.
 One motive Is the simple
 fact that the strain and bur-
 den of the war are becoming
 near-unbearable  for  both
 Hanoi and the Vietcong pup-
 pets. That Is why the ex-
 traordinary step is being
 taken  of  promising   the
 enemy troops an end of the
 war at a stated time. As for
 the other motive, Hanoi is
 obviously planning to use
 the lever of the election
 year In America to get a-
 better deal than would be
 possible later on.
 No  positive  negotiating
 move will be made, most
 probably, until the attacks
 now prepared have at length
 been mounted. The offer
 will then take the initial
 form, beyond doubt, of a
 public or private intimation
 by Hanoi: "You stop bomb-
 ing the north uncondition-
 ally, and we'll start talking
 about coalition government
 In the South." This has al?
 ready been telegraphed by
 the Hanoi Foreign Minister
 Nguyen Duy Trinh.
 There are only two draw
 backs to this. An uncondi.
 tional, unreciprocated bomb.
 Jag halt in the North Is a
 nice, simple way to give the
 enemy just the respite he
 needs, so that the U.S. and
 allied soldiers at the front,
 will have a brand new war
 on  their  hands  in  six
 months' time. And the kind
 of coalition ;Hanoi wants to,
 talk about is also Intended
 to permit the "occupation of
 the countryside," followed
 by "surrounding the towns,"
 leading to "complete vic-
 tory."
 But there are all too many
 people in this country who
 have forgotten all our past
 experience, In Korea and
 elsewhere. President John-
 son will need a lot of guts to
 stand up to the clamor of
 people like' these. What al-
 most certainly lies ahead Is
 this space. Some documents tacked by the 18th Regi-      profoundly, encouraging for

 All.indicate that climatic,
 especially intensive enemy
 efforts will produce peace-

 that fighting will end "after

 WASHINGTON DAILY NEWS  (9)
 12 January 1968
 The Viet Cong Offensive
 % THE Viet Cong have been attacking at
 a hard, fast pace ever since the New
 Year's truce ended. A Communist bat-
 talion flattened Tan Uyen, a ? district
 town 23 miles north of Saigon; another
 occupied for three hours Khiem Cuong,
 a province capital 21 miles northwest of
 Saigon. Commandos hit supposedly, se-
 cure Kontum airfield in the highlands.
 North Vietnamese troops are showing
 new toughness in the central coastal
 plains and valleys, notably Que Son.
 And now a big buildup is reported near
 exposed Khe Sanh, near the Laos bor-
 der.
 We find this situation ominous and
 mystifying.
 Allied commanders take some satis-
 faction in the high price the communists
 are paying: 2868 reportedly killed the
 first week of the year. But the fact the
 Reds can mount an offensive in every
 section of the South - despite the 1.2
 m i I l i o n men the "improving" allies
 have under arms - gives us no cbm-.
 fort.
 As the Saigon-area attacks show, the
 Viet Cong evidently are using "War
 Zone C':' northwest of the capital, de-
 spite themassive American "clean-out"
 -in "Operation Junction City" over a
 year agog ,
 And there is some disturbing arithme-
 tic in the latest official estimates of
 communist strength in the South. De-
 s, p I t e 87,534 communists reportedly
 killed anc1 ` 27,178 defected last year,
 their ranks ' increased from 281,000 to
 somewhere between 298,000 and 333,000
 comparing Jan. 1, 1967 and Jan. 1, 1968,
 To cover losses and achieve that build-
 up, the communists had to recruit or
 infiltrate between 132,000 and 167,000
 new troops! Either the official statistics
 are out of whack, or the communists
 are not being so badly hurt by Gen.
 Westmoreland's "war of attrition" as
 we are led to believe.
 Even so, why the big communist of-
 fensive now? Probably to add to the
 fears of the South Vietnamese populace
 and further shake the morale of Sai-
 gon's armed forces and make headlines
 in the USA. There may also be an inter-
 nal motive: in recent weeks Viet Cong
 indoctrinators have urged their troops
 to make a special effort before the Tet
 holidays (at month's end) to win the
 "decisive victory" they promise will
 bring about a coalition government on
 favorable terms.
 Maybe, then, the current offensive is
 :designed as a prelude to a new diplo-
 matic move by Hanoi. We'll know short-
 ly. If the communist do use the Tet pe-
 riod to.make an offer, it will have to be
 more detailed and forthcoming than
 the bare "willingness" to talk provided
 we permanently halt our Northern
 bombings.
 In the past some leading doves have
 shrieked with fury that just when (it
 seemed) .the chances for peace talks
 brightened, the U.S. would "destroy"
 the prospect by upping its bombing
 raids or sending in reinforcements. Now
 that peace talk is in the air again - and
 is accompanied by the current commu-
 nist offensive In the South - we haven't;
 beard even it chirp of complaint.
