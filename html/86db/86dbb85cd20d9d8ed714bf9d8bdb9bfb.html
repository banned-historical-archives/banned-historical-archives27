 THE CIINESK MINORITY IN INDONESIA
 The two and one-half million.Overseas Chinese, comprising
 approximately three per cent of the .population of Indonesia,  con-
 stitute a racial problem for the Republic of Indonesia.                              Socially
 and culturally aloof, intensely proud of being Chinese; dispro-
 portionately wealthy with a strangle hold.on the economic life
 the archipelago, they are considered by the Indonesian's as their
 greatest internal political problem.  This political problem is
 complicated by the hold the Nationalist and Communist Chinese
 governments have on all their nationals overseas.
 In attempting to find a solution to the'problem posed by
 the complexities of theSino-Indonesian. relationship, ethnocentric
 attitudes have blinded most responsible leaders of both groups to
 some of the more promising possibilities.  These possibilities for
 solution are basically in the political area and depend upon
 whether the,  :ndigenous Indonesians can divest themselves of their
 prejudices regarding the Chinese and receive them as!full citizens
 of the Republic; and whether the Chinese can throw off the dual
 citizenship control of their motherland .and give their unquali-
 fiedsupport to the Republic.   Although the Indonesan.Csbinet
 is currently considering,implementation of the dual nationality
 law, no formal agreement :between the government and the Chinese
 Nationalists has been reached to date.

 THE CHINESE MINORITY IN INDONESIA
 I.   Background
 A.   Origins
 Chinese trading contacts with Java and Sumatra date from
 AD 400, but permanent settlements in the islands were not men-
 tioned until during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).   The.estab-
 lishment of the Dutch East Indies Company in 1602 resulted in
 a sharply increased immigration of Chinese commencing in 1619.
 These settlers originated from three distinct areas of main-
 land China with each area speaking an individualized dialect.
 From.'the South China mountainous area came the Hakkas; sturdy,
 freedom-loving, hard working toilers of the soil who initially
 engaged in agricultural projects in their new homes.   From the
 Canton and West River Delta area of Kwangtung came the Cantonese;
 men with a background of never being satisfied with their present
 living conditions and thus determined to seek fame and fortune
 in commerce and trade.   From Fukien Province, especially from.
 around the vicinity of Amoy and Foochow, came the Hokkiens;
 stubborn, hard-headed sailors and business men with one idea
 in mind (held by many overseas Chinese to this day) of amassing
 a fortune by any means necessary and retiring to their native
 villages to live in plenty in their old age.   From these
 southern areas of China, the Hokkiens furnished approximately
 47 per cent of the immigrants, the Hakkas 21 per cent, and the
 Cantonese 12 per cent, with smaller groups of Teochiu, Hainanese
 and others supplying the remainder of the Chinese settlers.
 B.   Number
 The last official census, taken in Indonesia in 1930,
 ,placed the Chinese population at 1,200,000.   Since that date
 the Chinese have increased steadily, according to competent
 observers, reaching a total of 1,900,000 in 1947, two million
 in 1950, and 2,500,000 in 1957.
 With the population of Indonesia estimated in 1957 at
 approximately 84 million, the Chinese settlers form about..
 three per cent of the inhabitants, the largest and most im-
 portant minority group.

 C.   Distribution.
 Geographically, the Chinese are distributed within.' the
 confines of the Republic as follows:
 a.  The Hokkiens form over one-half of the Chinese
 population in Java and Madura, and comprise approximato I ly
 60 per cent of the Chinese residents of the Celebes and the
 Moluccas.    They predominate in the cities where Chinese are
 found.
 b.  The Hakkas are in the majority of the Chinese
 inhabitants in west Borneo, Bangka and Billiton.  They; are
 alsd'present in Java, east Sumatra and in the Riouw archi-
 pelago.   In the Celebes and Moluccas they form 10 per dent
 of the Chinese population.
 c.  The Cantonese are more widely distributed than
 any of the other Chinese groups.  They'are found in Java,
 east and south Sumatra, Bangka and Billiton, and form about
 30 per cent of the Chinese living in Celebes and the Moluccas.
 d.  The Teochius are distributed similarly to.the
 Hakkas; the Hainanese are mostly urbanized and live in al-
 most all cities of the Republic, while the remainder of the
 smaller groups of the Chinese are generally found along the
 east coast of Sumatra.
 As a result of military operations between the Dutch and
 forces of the Indonesian Republic, the Chinese migrated
 in large numbers to the various cities with the result that
 there are presently large numbers of them found in Djakarta,
 Surabaya and Palembang.

 II.   Impact on Indonesia
 A.   Economic
 The economic grip which the Chinese hold over the economy
 of Indonesia is probably the basic cause of the indigenous
 peoples' resentment and fear of the Chinese minority.   Every-
 where they dominate the commercial life of the islands,espe
 cially in the internal wholesale and retail trades.  They
 control 95 per cent of industry.   All efforts to extend; the
 participation of Indonesians in these fields has so far; had
 little success.      With the advent of the Republican govern-
 ment, partially effective government controls, coupled With
 changing political and economic conditions, have forced; the
 Chinese into new patterns of living and even into some :illegal
 activities.   This development seems likely to alter adversely
 their relationships with the native peoples but unlikely to
 endanger the Chinese economic hold over the area.  The in-
 creasing urbanization of the Chinese has accentuated their
 aggressiveness, social aloofness, and disproportionate wealth
 as compared with the country's nationals, whose own standard
 of living has declined in the post-war period.   Foreign ex-
 change and other controls have transformed many of the Chinese
 into smugglers and black marketeers, and such operations have
 increased their wealth and their unpopularity. /  A metaphor,
 which has become a cliche, aptly portrays the impact of the
 Chinese minority on the economy of Indonesian the Chinese
 do not mind who holds the cow so long as they can milk it'.
 In the early days of the Dutch East Indies Company, the Chinese
 were permitted to settle in the various islands.  However,
 even before the European incursion, the Chinese, who h.d
 been trading in the archipelago since probably before the
 time of Christ, were perhaps the most important foreign
 group in the bazaar states, often living within the castle
 walls, advising the local king, and maintaining close com-
 mercial ties with merchants in China.   Asiatic, but bond
 neither by the ritualistic constraints of Hinduism or the
 legalistic ones of Islam; economically skilled and marvelously
 adept at political fence-sitting; tightly organized and
 industrious to a fault; and, perhaps most important, pbs-
 sessed of a calm sense of their own cultural superiority to
 both the Dutch and the Javanese, they were Java's most
 successful "marginal men."   As such the Dutch soon found
 them indispensable as intermediaries between themselves
 and the native population, fulfilling economic and political
 functions Europeans could or would not fulfill themselves.

 This explains how the Chinese secured their foothold In
 Indonesia and why they have succeeded in their dominant
 economic position throughout the islands.
 1900 was an important year in the economic life of the
 islands.   As a result of a decline in all businesses,: and
 thus in profits, the jealousies of the Europeans in Indonesia
 were directed toward the Chinese,   The Europeans maintained
 that the strong economic position of the Chinese minority
 was due to Chinese exploitation of the improvidence wind vices
 of the natives. 70   Until this time, a great deal of the
 wealth of the Chinese was derived from opium shops, pawn
 shops and usury.   Having a monopoly of opium, the Chinese
 vendors were in a position to push the sale of this harm-
 ful drug--an opportunity of which they took full advantage.
 As pawn brokers they fixed their terms for loans "with
 reference to the need of the borrower rather than to:the
 value of the pledge he offered."   The pawnshops were often
 illicit opium dens.   In other forms of money-lendingtheir
 operations were equally "unconscionable" in that they aimed
 to get the native officials in their power and used this
 power to oppress the agricultural cultivators.   Even when
 ostensibly engaged in commerce, they were equally engaged
 in money-lending, and they had such a strangler?hold 9n the
 batik (native cloth) industry in particular that the native
 craftsman was little better than a slave.   Regulations made
 by the government to protect the native from these forms
 of extortion and oppression were rendered largely inoperative
 by the combination of the Chinese among themselves trough
 their secret trade organizations to defeat those reg ilations. 11
 Thus in 1900 the government passed regulations abolishing
 the opium shops and established State pawnshops and facil-
 ities for agricultural credit which had a revolutionary
 effect on the Chinese economy.   Chinese were in. the unen-
 viable position of middlemen, exposed to the animosity of
 two opposed forces, the natives and the Europeans, though
 useful as a buffer between them,    High officials of the
 period gave support to the theory of the detrimental' role
 of the Chinese in Indonesian society, and many of them
 regarded them as the "main cause of the diminishing welfare
 of the Indonesians."   These regulations were all detrimental
 to the interests of the Chinese, for in one case they took
 away a business that had been theirs for centuries, and
 in the other they created competitors to them backed by
 all the capital and resources of the government. 12/
 Consequently, the Chinese had to seek. new:outle;ts
 for their idle capital.   They found two new enterprises.
 One was in speculation in land which entailed purchasing
 large private estates, 13   Chinese and all foreigners in

 Indonesia were greatly circumscribed in this activity due
 to laws which prohibited them from owning farm lands.   The
 other enterprise was in the banking field and subsequently
 in the development of industry.   In these new fields to
 which they put their riches, the Chinese became intimately
 associated with capitalist production and therefore into
 close alliance with the European community.   Thus the
 Chinese have been able to turn discriminatory legislation
 against them into personal means of further inroads into
 the economic life of the Republic.
 With the advent of the second world war, a financial
 depression occurred in Indonesia due to the collapse of
 Dutch business interests and their capitalistic financing
 of trade and industry.   The back of the Indonesian mercantile
 enterprise was broken in the crash.   The Chinese now took
 over---not only the more capitalized trades such as hardware
 and passenger trade, but even such traditional Indonesian
 commercial strongholds as cigarettes and textiles fell in
 large part into Chinese hands.   These Chinese hands were
 not, for the most part, those of the traditional peranakans
 Chinese born in Indonesia), but of the aggressive singkehss
 Chinese who came directly from the mainland), who had
 steadily increased in number and strength throughout the
 whole prosperity period and who now took the commanding
 position within the commercial community they still main-
 tain, squeezing out the traditional element both among
 the Chinese and the Javanese.   As the singkehs took over
 the buying of dry season crops in the rural sector, so
 they took over the greater part of the retail, wholesale
 and small factory  sector of urban life,   Where there
 had previously been several groups, of whom the Chinese
 were admittedly clearly the strongest, competing for in-
 come shares within the market sector, now the singke'hs
 began to loom over all the others. 15
 The resilience and resourcefulness of the Chinese was
 further shown in 1946 when Chinese trade was temporarily
 paralyzed at the time that the Republican currency was
 put into circulation,  Many Indonesians thought that the
 Chinese advantage in trade had at last been destroyed
 and that the Indonesians could now meet them on equal terms,
 but they soon found they had miscalculated the abilities
 of the Chinese to extricate themselves from this temporary
 setback.   A few years before this, during the occupation
 of the islands by the Japanese forces, the invaders had
 transferred to the Republic many economic  assets including
 a number of rice mills which belonged to the Chinese.   In
 addition, the Indonesian politicians introduced new laws

 of citizenship with disabilities for aliens,, whose object
 was to absorb a great quantity of Chinese manpower and to
 obtain control of Chinese property and their wealth.     Trade
 restrictions were introduced into the Republic.  The Chinese
 were forced to purchase considerable amounts of Republican
 national loan bonds.  But still the Chinese traders managed
 to make money due to their superior knowledge of the islands
 their nationalistic cohesion and their aggressiveness.   A
 large number of them became wealthy by running successfully
 and often the Dutch blockade to Singapore.       Durin$ the
 hostilities between the Djakarta government and the rebel=lious forces on Sumatra,, much of the blockade running was
 in the hands of Chinese who were able to gain financially
 in this dangerous trade o
 An enumeration of the economic areas in which the
 Chinese dominate, together with a brief description of the
 activity, follows-
 1.                            Rubber
 In the outer provinces Chinese traders dominate
 the market; l7  they also lead in.copra transactions. 18
 On the main islands there are numerous Chinese as
 small holders in rubber sales. IV
 2.   Rice
 In the wholesale field of rice importation, the
 singkehs Chinese have a commanding position  backed
 as they are by Chinese affiliates in the rice ex-
 porting countries of' Thailand and Vietnam   20  21
 3.   Investment Capital
 They have more capital for investments at their
 command than any other group in Indonesia and
 since 1949 indigenous Indonesians have not been
 able to catch up.   This capital is presently being
 used in investments in land, timber, sugar and
 other estate cultures. 22/
 Foreign Commodities
 At the beginning of the 19th century,- the Chinese
 had a commanding lead, in the importation.of foreign
 commodities,, which they have maintained until the

 18.    Miscellaneous Economic Activities
 While not dominating in these areas, many Chinese
 are employees of business firms, clerks, farmers
 (important only in west Borneo, east coast'of
 Sumatra, Bangka and Billiton), market gardening,
 fishing, collectors of taxes, salesmen, contractors
 and professionals (accountants, dentists, doctors,
 lawyers and teachers). L0  4142
 Indicative of the economic hold the Chinese have in
 Indonesia is the following survey of a typical town of some
 450 retail and service stores and shops of all sizep.   Only
 16 per cent of these stores and shops are owned andop--
 erated by natives; the remainder are divided, 33 per cent
 belonging to the singkehs and 48 per cent to the    eranakan
 Chinese, L3   The Chin     accordingly, form the heart o
 the town's economic circulatory system, pressing goads,
 many of them imported, down through its arteries, pulling
 back goods, the greater part of them agriculturxal, 'through
 its veins and passing them on to the large suburban: centers
 for further distribution0  The business districts are lined
 with small, open-front, wooden stores, over 80 per cent
 belonging to Chinese.   Inside the stores are found hardware,
 home furnishings, various types of food, jewelry, false
 teeth, automobile and bicycle parts, building mater?ials,
 textiles, and drugs, from.sulfa compounds to such promising
 medicines as crocodile tongues and cat's beard.  Much of
 the cloth is bought in Surabaya by the natives directly
 from Chinese stores there.   Chinese from the cities and
 larger towns often come to the typical town to trade with
 the indigenous market people. 44
 Up to the present time, the indigenous population
 has been unable to break the strangle hold of Chinese con-
 trol over the economic life of the Indonesian Republic..
 B.   Cultural
 That there is a race problem in Indonesia few Will
 deny, since informed Indonesians generally speak of the
 Chinese as constituting one of the most difficult And
 frustrating of contemporary questions         Indonesians
 regard the Chinese as perhaps their major "problem;"6
 Most Chinese meet Indonesians through work or business;
 seldom do they mingle socially.        Remaining alopf,
 refusing to be assimmilated, proud of being Chinese, and
 determined to preserve their culture by means of their

 .own schools, press and business guilds, the Chinese in In-
 donesia are a complete society to themselves, interested
 chiefly in advancing themselves in the economic life of the
 Republic.   Consequently, their impact socially on Indonesian
 social patterns and culture has been insignificant.
 In prewar (WW2) days, almost all interethnic c.ozitacts
 found the Chinese in a higher socioeconomic status than the
 Indonesians.  The attainment of political power by an
 indigenous elite has changed this situation and in all' im-
 portant range of contacts the Chinese now aie subordinate..
 Indonesians presently can, through discriminatory practices,
 give satisfying expression to their long smouldering re-
 sentment,   Consequently, Indonesia is faced with an acute
 and explosive problem of "race relations" and ethnocentric
 attitudes blind most responsible leaders on both sides to
 some of the more promising possibilities for solution. L8/
 In addition to the natural tendencies of Chinese overseas
 to remain apart socially and culturally from the indigenous
 population, there are further explanations of why this is
 especially true in Indonesia.   Some of the more important
 reasons are examined below.
 One of the main stumbling blocks to complete assim-
 ilation of the Chinese into Indonesian society is the land
 policy laid down by the former Dutch rulers and taken over
 by the Republican authorities.   This policy forbids non
 Indonesians from owning farm lands.   This rule has given
 protection to the natives but it has emphasized the plural
 aspect of society, and to the sensitive Chinese this is
 interpreted personally as placing them in an inferior
 position socially.   This policy has cut both ways.  The
 Chinese were, on the one hand, prevented from obtaining
 a monopoly of the land and dispossessing the natives, as
 they inevitably could have done when one considers their
 business acumen and aggressiveness.   On the other' han.d., any
 tendency toward the assimilation of the Chinese into the
 Indonesian community and making it a single homogeneous
 society was arrested. 49/  'p to the present no solution of
 this question has been evolved.
 Another stumbling block is the disproportionate wealth
 of the Chinese community, which produces envy and suspicion
 on the part of the Indonesians.   In 1937 the Chinesey less
 than two per cent of the country's population, included
 29 per cent of all those who lived in the islands with in-
 comes of 900 guilders and over. 50   While no statistics are
 available at the present writing, it appears that this dis-
 proportion has increased rather than lessened, thus Vin-
 creasing the apprehension of Indonesian officials.

 Approved For Release 1999/            P78-02646R000200070001-8
 Intermarriage between Chinese and Indonesians has con
 tributed little toward assimilation, while adjustments to
 environment continue to modify Chinese cultural practices
 only slightly. 51    In many of these intermarriages the
 Chinese have continued to preserve their surnames and thus
 a tie with their ancestors.   Some of these families have
 forgotten their native language but now speak a polyglot
 of their own making and still retain much of the culture
 and customs of their motherland.
 The discrimination practiced by the Indonesians against
 the Chinese and the social tensions prevalent are not cal-
 culated to pave the way for assimilation.  There are probably
 large numbers of Chinese living in the cities who are in
 a state of poverty, but these attract little attention..
 If the Chinese tend to hold together as a group, under con-
 ditions making for economic competition on a group basis,
 they are in great danger of becoming, eventually, a pariah
 group,   The Chinese are well aware of this.  But even if
 they should be more successful than the Inde-Europeans in
 assimilating themselves with the Indonesians, in the:long
 run they will be unable to maintain their privileged:
 position, 52  and at the present time they are unwilling
 to place this position in jeopardy.
 In the education of their children, the Chinese: have
 always been discriminated against.   Previous to 1900 the
 authorities laid down rules encouraging the establishment
 of schools, for the native population, with the primary
 purpose of training native officials.  This system con-
 tinued until the end of the century when, under the influ-
 ence of the ethical movement in Holland, a policy was laid
 down for nation-wide education not merely in the interests
 of the government,   Nothing, however, had been done for
 the education of Chinese children since the educational
 article in the Regulations of 1854 was interpreted not to
 apply to children of peoples assimilated with the natives.
 No subsidies were given to Chinese schools and Chinese
 children were permitted to enter the lower native schools
 only if there was room for them and if they knew sufficient
 Dutch to follow the instruction, and upon payment of higher
 school fees    Education in these schools led normally to
 employment in the government service, but from even the
 lowest ranks the Chinese were excluded.
 About 1900 the Chinese of Indonesia began to assert
 themselves to improve their position.   Education and the
 press were the chief means employed.   School societies
 were organized and schools opened..  English was chosen

 Approved For Release 1999          P78-02646R000200070001-8
 because English-speaking Chinese instructors could becheaply
 obtained from Singapore and, in addition, English had; the
 advantage of being the commercial language of the East.   The
 Chinese press in Indonesia, meanwhile, strengthened the unity
 of the national consciousness of the community and passed
 the Chinese grievances with the government..
 The Dutch government now began to make education; easier
 for the Chinese to procure.   Chinese were admitted to native
 schools on the same basis as natives, and the erection of
 government schools for Chinese, the so-called Dutch-Chinese
 schools, was begun in 1908, and in 1909 private Chinese
 schools were granted government subsidies.   It was soon
 evident that these private schools had the support of the
 Chinese community and every year more schools were established.
 Many Chinese urged that the Dutch-Chinese schools be!trans
 formed into national schools open to every Chinese child.
 This demand could not be granted since the number of teachers
 required was not available.   If these schools had been trans-
 formed into national schools, or if there had been some
 planning toward that end, a real beginning in assimilation
 would have been made with the younger generation of the
 Chinese population.
 The establishment of the Dutch-Chinese schools was
 in the nature of preferential treatment for the chin6se,
 and the Indonesians were not slow to recognize it.   While
 these schools were subject to Dutch official inspection
 and control., the curriculum had a purely Chinese nationalist
 character. /  Thus was born the swing-away from ultimate
 assimilation with the indigenous' population.   The establish-
 ment of these modern Chinese schools by the Chinese them
 selves contributed immensely to the rise of Chinese na---
 tionalismo   This nationalistic rise was so intense that it
 alarmed the Dutch and in 1908 they did a complete about-
 face in their policy, whereby the doors of Dutch culture
 were opened to the entire middle class of Chinese.   In
 turn, this caused the Indonesians to think of the Chinese
 community as being pro-Dutch and set off a series of
 retaliations and subjective prejudices that exist to the
 present time.
 In the post-world war II period, the system of Chinese
 schools? was greatly expanded and. the resinofication of
 peranakan society was by 1955 a major phenomenon in Java.
 As for singkeh society, its leaders were largely rebpon-
 sible for the development and rapid expansion of Chinese
 schools in Indonesia and for their politicization in the
 interests of. China.   In recent months Indonesian authorities

 Approved For Release 1999/0             78-02646R000200070001-8
 have made it clear that Indonesian citizens of whatever ex-
 traction will eventually be barred from attending. other than
 Indonesian schools.
 The Chinese,. who have long memories, have never for-
 gotten what happened to a gr-bup of their nationals who were
 completely assimilated with the native inhabitants at
 Tangerang.   In this rural community Chinese agriculturalists
 became indistinguishable from the indigenous population even
 to their physical appearances.   They spoke only Javanese-
 Malay and led a life almost identical with that of the
 Javanese farmers near them, retaining only their Chinese
 surnames,,.        It was here that a massacre of these Sinop.
 Indonesian farmers took place during the birthpangs of the
 Republic.   The New York Times of 6 June 1946 reported that
 600 Chinese,  suspected by      Indonesians of cooperation
 with the Dutch, had been slain and their villages set on
 fire.   The massacre did not end until 8 June.   Further out-
 breaks against the Chinese in September occurred at pagan
 Api Api when 200 were said to have been killed, with 20
 more at Bangko,  34 at Telok Poelau and 75 at Djembra..   In
 January 1947, 250 more were killed in Palembang in Sumatra.
 When the Chinese decided to place themselves under Dutch
 protection as a result of these outbreaks, the Indonesians
 felt they were confirmed in their suspicion that theChinese
 had cooperated with the Dutch imperialists in the affected
 areas, 5/  On the other hand, these series of killings
 tended to corroborate the Chinese suspicion that they were
 not wanted as equals by the indigenous population.
 The Chinese community continues to remain apart and
 unassimilated,   Among Indonesian politicians there are two
 schools of thought concerning the Chinese problems   One
 school regards the Chinese as a minority problem; the
 other school prefers to think of the Chinese born in -
 Indonesia as part of the Indonesian people,   Notwithstanding
 the desirability of the latter policy as an objectiv6,  the
 psychological tendency among the Indonesians generally and
 the Chinese community as a whole favors the first view.
 C.   Political
 There are two political issues concerning the Chinese
 minority which fundamentally affect their relationship
 with the Indonesian people.   These issues are their dual
 nationality and their inability to own land,

 1.    Dual Nationality
 Chinese governments have traditionally regarded the
 decendents of emigrants as Chinese citizens.   This
 position, taken toward the end of the Chaing
 Dynasty, has been maintained by all subsequent
 Chinese governments, although in very recent years
 both Taipei and Peiping have shown a willingness
 to retreat from this rigid position.   How to
 implement this willingness has not yet been worked
 out in detailed legislation by the Indonesian'Govern-
 ment in spite df the signing of an Indonesian-Chinese
 Dual Nationality Treaty with Communist China in 1955.
 Under the Dutch administration of the East Indies,
 it was ruled that a.Chinese born on Dutch territory
 was a Dutch subject as long as he resided there.
 The instrument transferring sovereignty over Indonesia
 from the Netherlands to the Republic of Indonesia in
 1949 contained a clause providing that Chinese who
 were Dutch subjects automatically became Indonesian
 citizens unless they specifically rejected Indonesian
 citizenship before December 31, 1951.   This system,
 known as the "passive system" in Indonesia, covered
 all persons 21 years or above, married, and who had
 lived in Indonesia for five years.  D.ring World..War II and
 the years immediately following there was little
 Chinese immigration into Indonesia and this provision
 conferred Indonesian citizenship upon virtually all
 Chinese in Indonesia unless they wished to reject
 it.   It did not, however, jeopardize their claim to
 Chinese citizenship..
 In 1951 the Indonesian Government issued a Registra-
 tion Regulation requiring all persons of non-in-
 digenous descent to register if they wished to re-
 tain Indonesian citizenship.   This was objected to
 by the Arab and Chinese minorities on the grounds
 that they already considered themselves Indonesian
 citizens and that the requirement to register was
 discriminatory.   This requirement, which became
 known as the "active system" was, however, maintained
 by the government.   In accordance with the regulation,
 it is estimated that about one-third of the Chinese
 population in Indonesia registered.   The "active
 system" cancelled the formerly applicable "passive
 system" and as a result two-thirds of the Chinese
 in Indonesia, through failure to register, lost
 their claims to Indonesian citizenship.

 Sunario, who later became Foreign Minister, made an
 important statement on 31 December 1951.   Stating
 that he did not agree with the concept of dual
 citizenship; he added that "a difference between
 .original and non-original citizens had to be made.
 This difference is related to the different economic
 conditions, the original citizens, owing to their
 economic weaknesses, are considered to need help,
 and as regards the others who are not original
 citizens, it is necessary to check their influence
 on the economy."  This statement shows that there
 was no intention to accord Indonesians of Chinese
 ancestry, even those who confirmed their desire to
 keep Indonesian citizenship under the "active
 system," equal business opportunities.   In 1953
 when.Sunario was Foreign Minister, the Ali Sastroamid-
 jojo Cabinet issued a regulation which reserved most
 of the import licenses to Indonesian citizens and
 in the administration of this regulation Indonesian
 citizens of Chinese ancestry were treated as non-
 citizen Chinese,
 Late in 1953 Communist China alloted four seats to
 Overseas Chinese from Indonesia in, the All China
 People's Congress, thus dramatizing the dual cit-
 izenship question.   In September 1954 the Indonesia
 press carried reports that during CHOU En-lai ' s
 visit to New Delhi in July, CHOU told Nehru that
 his government would henceforth regard Overseas
 Chinese as foreigners and that Peiping was willing
 to conclude agreements with other governments based
 .on the single nationality concept.   During November
 of 1.954 negotiations on the matter were held in
 Peiping but became stranded.on the question of the
 legal position of Overseas Chinese who passively
 declined to reject either Chinese Communist or
 Indonesian citizenship.   The Indonesian Government
 wanted such persons to be considered Chinese
 citizens and the Chinese Communists insisted that
 they be accorded the rights of Indonesian citizens.
 In.the meantime, the Indonesian Government decided
 to present a draft citizenship bill toParliament
 which provided that all Indonesian citizens residing
 in Indonesia should renounce any other citizenship
 they possessed within one year of the bill's coming
 into force

 By early spring 1955, both the Indonesian and Chinese
 Communist governments apparently were eager to reach
 agreement quickly on a dual citizenship treaty to
 enable the signing ceremony to  take place during
 CHOU's presence in Indonesia for the Asian-African
 Conference.   While the content of the negotiations
 was a closely guarded secret, two problems were
 assumed to have been discussed.  One was again the
 1951 Registration Regulation concerning what :should
 be done to persons who failed to reject either
 Chinese or Indonesian citizenship after the treaty
 became law, either through ignorance of the law or
 through willful decision not to make a rejection on
 the grounds that they were already good Indonesian
 citizens under the "passive system."   The other
 problem was the insistence by the Chinese Communists
 of a clause guaranteeing non-discrimination against
 Indonesian citizens of Chinese ancestry, which was
 rejected.:by the Indonesians.   In March, before the
 negotiations were moved to Djakarta, the Indonesian
 Government announced that in February a "second
 phase" registration of foreigners had begun.   These
 regulations stipulated that aliens had to register with
 the local Immigration Office, bringing with them at
 least 10 separate documents including such items as
 a letter from the tax office certifying full payment
 of taxes, police questionnaire, and a biography for
 every alien 16 years and above.
 On 3 June 1955, a note exchange took place between
 Prime Minister All Sastroamidjojo and CHOU En.lai
 which clarified some of the more ambiguous points
 in the Dual Nationality Agreement, which was signed
 in Bandung on 22 April 1955 by CHOU on behalf of
 Communist China and Sunario, on behalf of the Republic
 of Indonesia.   The five items in the exchange-of notes
 are as follows:
 a.   The dual nationality problem was inherited
 from the. Past.
 b.   There was a category of persons of Chinese
 ancestry in Indonesia whose social and political
 status testifies that they already had implicitly
 renounced Chinese nationality: such persons did not
 have to make a choice of nationality and it was to
 be left up to the Indonesian Government to determine
 who were to be included in this category.

 c.   The 20-year period of the treaty (subject to
 renewal) did not mean that persons who had chosen
 their nationality would have to do so again at the
 end of 20 years.
 d.   There will be established in Djakarta a joint
 committee of Indonesians and Chinese Communist rep?-
 resentatives who will discuss methods of implementing
 the Agreement.
 e.   The present status of dual nationals should
 remain unchanged during the two-year period for the
 choosing of nationality.
 However, there still was no agreed definition be-
 tween the Indonesians and Chinese Governments on
 what a dual citizen was.   The implementation of the
 agreement, therefore, would depend on the cooperation
 of the Indonesian and Chinese Communist Governments.
 Another danger to Indonesia was the provision for
 establishing offices to register the citizenship
 choices of Overseas Chinese.  This provision would
 give the Chinese Communists greater convenience
 for their subversive activities in Indonesia.   How-
 ever, the greatest danger arising from this agree-
 ment was the fact that, signed at the Asian-African
 Conference, it presented to the public evidence of
 a rapprochement between Indonesia and Communist China.
 The impact of this agreement upon the people living
 in Indonesia was varied.   On 1 May the PNI Executive
 Council announced its full concurrence with the'
 agreement.   On 2 May it was announced that the Cab-
 inet had approved its submission to Parliament.
 The anti-Communist newspaper'Indonesia Raga declared
 its opposition, stating the  .greement was more of
 a Communist propaganda victory than an instrument
 to solve a difficult minority problem.   The PSI
 issued a statement condemning the agreement as un-
 constitutional, but after the note exchange agreed
 that the notes opened the possibility of correcting
 mistakes in the Igreement.   Wibisone, a leader of
 the Masjumis declared his party would vote against
 ratification.
 In the Chinese community, reaction  was generally
 unfavorable.   The pro-Nationalist Chinese and anti-
 Communist Chinese objected to the implication that

 the choice-of nationality was confined to either
 that of Indonesia or Communist China and thus making
 them stateless,   SIAUW Giok Tjhan, a. pro-Communist
 and chairman of BAPERKI (a left-wing political' party
 composed mainly of Overseas Chinese) objected to
 the requirement of having to make a rejection bf
 nationality.,   After the exchange of notes SIAW.T
 changed his position, but apparently without en-
 thusiasm and further stated that BAPERKI would light
 for the right of Indonesian citizens of Chinese origin
 not to have to make the rejection,
 Representatives of the group of Chinese who were
 neither pro-Nationalist nor pro-Communist generally
 disapproved of the   greement.   After the exchange
 of notes, their opposition also subsided and their
 interest tended to rest only on the question of how
 the Indonesian Government would determine the cate-
 gory of persons who would be exempt from the require-
 ment of rejecting one citizenship or the other,   On
 27 June the pro-Communist newspaper Sin Po published
 a report that the following groups of persons would
 be exempt from making rejections:   cabinet ministers,
 members of Parliament, military officers, police,
 election candidates and those who vote. 58
 On 17. December 1957, the Indonesian Parliament ratified
 the Dual Nationality Treaty, with the Masjumi Party
 abstaining.   Ten days later the treaty was approved by
 the Chinese Communist State Council.   On 30 December
 it was ratified by the Standing Committee of the Chinese

 the dual citizenship, bill prior to the cit-
 izenship law would inevitably influence the
 future discussion of the later.
 MP Siauw Giok Tjhan (National Progressive]
 who opposed the motion said that in order,
 to end racial prejudices which occasionally
 gave rise to undesirable sentiments, settle-
 ment-of the dual citizenship bill was not
 urgent.
 There are two Overseas Chinese organizations in
 Indonesia that are of importance politically,'
 They are the BAPERKI Party (committee Concerned
 With Ending Racial Discrimination.)-and the Chung
 Hua Chtiao Ttuan Teung Hui (Djakarta General
 Association of Overseas Chinese Organizations)
 commonly referred to as the CHCTTH.
 The BAPERKI Party is made up almost.exclusively
 of Chinese   It functions as a party in elections
 and Its representatives serve in Parliament,ithe
 Constituent Assembly and in municipal councils
 In Indonesian politics it is aligned with the
 National Progressive Faction, gives all-out sup-
 port to President Sukarno, and generally finds.
 itself on the side of the Indonesian Communist
 Party in political debates,        In 1955 it
 polled approximately 160,000 votes in the Par-
 liamentary elections.   During the fall of 1957
 the Party endeavored to obtain at least one seat
 in as many Java municipal and regional councils
 as possible to lobby against the head tax on
 aliens as well as against the.glosing and re-
 strictions of Chinese schools in Indonesia. LO/
 At the core of Communist-oriented Chinese ccm
 munal organization in Indonesia is the CHCTTH.
 Technically a federation of Chinese organizations
 in the Djakarta area.only, it acts as.a.central
 headquarters for similar federations and single
 organizations throughout Indonesia.  Member,
 groups, in mid-1953 reported to number 70, come
 from every phase of Chinese community life--
 schools, labor groups, social and benevolent
 institutions, sports clubs, dramatic clubs, the
 press, merchant groups and youth and student
 groups, jLl/  The CHCTTH also acts as the com-
 munity contact for the Chinese Communist Embassy

 in Indonesia. 62   The Partal Komunis Indonesia (PKI),
 recovering in t 7e year following its, almost, complete
 annihilation in Madiun (September 19.8), found an
 unexpected ally in many of the Chinese Communist members
 of the Chung Hua 'Iaung 1-rui, from which the CHCTTH
 was ultimately'. formed in protest against Kuomintang
 dominance of the parent organization in 1952.  The
 Chinese Communist Embassy in 1950 used these pro-Com-
 munist members of t    sung Hui, and after 1952 the
 CHCTTH, as a front in extending aid to the PKi.
 The general tone of the constitution of theCHCTT
 is set up along the traditional lines of a Communist
 organization, with an all-powerful presidium holding
 strict control over its members. It has a.separate
 Youth Corps which as far back as 1952 reported a
 membership of 5, 000. ' 64     Si To Chan (SZU-?T' U Than
 0674/1778/6363) as of mid-April 1957 is listed as
 chairman of the organization. /  Probably the most
 important of the CHCTTH affiliates is the Min Sheng
 She (3046/3932/4357)\, which. has been described as
 the Chinese Communist Party in Indonesia in.disguise,
 and possibly the most politically active group among
 the Communist-oriented Chinese.   Its reported ob-
 jectives include,   elimination of any remnant of
 Dutch imperialistic influence in Indonesia; destruc-
 tion of the Kuomintang and all pro-Nationalist
 elements; organization of Communist cells; dis-
 tribution of Communist literature; support of the
 principles of MAO Tse-tung; support of the Soviet
 Union and Chinese People's Republic and aid; to them
 through espionage activities and in the procurement
 of essential materials; and undermining all pro-
 Western influence in Indonesia.   In mid-195:3 the
 organization claimed 5,000 individual members.   In
 1952 OEY Tjiu Kwie (HUANG Chou-kuei 7806/0719/6016)
 was reported as Chairman< 66
 While Kuomintang branches function in all the larger
 Indonesian cities, they are weak and operate at a
 disadvantage in a nation which does not recognize
 the Chinese Nationalist Government,  Political
 initiative in the Chinese community has clearly
 passed to the Peiping regime especially since the
 Korean War. 67.

 The inability of aliens to possess land legally
 in Indonesia colors the thinking of the Overseas

 Chinese community.   This prohibition, which Was in-
 stituted by the Dutch authorities and applied to their
 own nationals as well as to all foreigners, was
 designed to protect the indigenous populatio-a from
 exploitation.   It has been carried over as alaw by
 the Republic. 68   The O:inese argue that if'they
 cannot own land as the natives can, then they a.r.e,
 second-class citizens and in time this discrimination
 would lead to their economic collapse.
 On the other hand if they are to be citizensLof
 Indonesia in the true sense they must be able to
 own land,   Like the other minorities in Indo,esia,
 they are awaiting assurances from the government
 that they would receive equal treatment with. other
 Indonesian citizens before making up their minds
 concerning the dual citizenship question.   Con-
 sequ.ently, the chief question in their thinking
 is whether or not Indonesian citizenship would
 automatically eliminate the Dutch-imposed. ban on
 their acquisition of landed property.       To this
 major political problem the Republican, government
 has not yet provided an answer.   The matter has
 reached an impasse; the Chinese wondering'wh .t
 the local nationalists will offer them in return
 for shifting their allegiance, and the nationalists
 on their part wanting evidence of loyalty before
 alloting the Chinese an important stake in their
 country. L0
 The Overseas Chinese are now ?at the
 ~o
 politically.   Should they continue as aliens or
 should they endeavor to become citizens?   It'has
 been suggested that a firm political statement
 by both Taipei and Peiping that they regarded their
 countrymen who voluntarily would choose Indonesian
 citizenship as foreigners,  would help to clear
 the atmosphere.   Such,a declaration would be ex-
 tremely difficult to make.as it could be inter-
 preted as an abandonment of their own nationals,
 and thus a loss, of national prestige.   An effort
 is needed to settle these perplexing political
 questions fairly and amicably without loss to
 either the Chinese or the Indonesians and thus
 permit aliens, in Indonesia to become bona-fide
 citizens without reservations or discriminations,,
 Up to the present, there is little evidence that
 this is being done,

 III.   Principal Complaints of Indonesians and Chinese
 Both the Indonesian indigenous population and the Overseas
 Chinese domiciled in Indonesia have complained that there are
 serious grievances.against the opposite camp.  The principal
 complaints of both sides are listed below.   These complaints,,.
 compiled by authorities on Indonesia and often difficult to
 document, are nevertheless presented as the compiaintsvoiced
 by the average Indonesian and Chinese when iestioned to ex-
 plain the lack of harmony between them in their economic,
 cultural and political relationships.
 A.   Indonesians vs. Chinese
 1.   All Chinese are "bad", both pro-Nationalists and pro-
 Communists,
 ",Once a Chinese always a Chinese" is reportedly the
 slogan of nationalistic Overseas Chinese living in the
 archipelago.
 3.   A "superiority complex" is common among the young
 Chinese Nationalists.
 The Chinese hold the controlling position in the
 economy of the Republic, 95 per cent of the industry
 and internal trade and a near monopoly of both whole-
 sale and retail trade.
 5.   The Chinese are disproportionately wealthy; much of
 this wealth was unlawfully gained by black marketing,
 usury, unethical monopolies and "unconscionable"
 loan operations.
 6.   The Chinese are too shrewd and acquisitive.
 7.   As blockade runners of barter trade, the Chinese have
 contributed to the economic instability of the Republic.
 8.   During 1958 wealthy Chinese are illegally converting
 millions of dollars worth of rupiahs into Malayan
 currency and transferring their funds to Singapore.
 9.   The Chinese have always sided with the Dutch against
