 Wednesday, June 8, 1966
 Mr. CULVER.  Mr. Speaker, I recently
 had the opportunity to take part in
 Armed   Forces Day  celebrations  in
 Dubuque, Iowa.
 At a luncheon meeting that day, Brig.
 Gen, Howard F. Schiltz delivered an in-
 teresting and informative speech on the
 role of the U.S. Army in Vietnam.
 General Schiltz is the. Commanding,
 general of the U.S. Army Aviation Ma-
 teriel Command in St. Louis, and is
 therefore well qualified to discuss supply
 and logistical problems in Vietnam, and
 the importance of maximum mobility in

 To those who might challenge this stand in
 Vietnam, we reiterate the broad objective
 assigned our Armed Forces.
 First, to prevent, if possible, total nuclear
 war; if one does occur, to make certain that
 we bring it to the most favorable conclusion
 possible.
 Second, to dispel any Illusion of aggressors
 that they can successfully engage in local
 military adventures at the expense of the
 Free World nations.
 Third, to prevent the Communists from
 gaining  control  of  independent  nations
 through subversion, coercion, assassination,
 terror or guerrilla warfare. These are real-
 ities under the cloak the Communists cyn-
 ically call a "war of national liberation" or,
 "a people's war."

 The Communists see such a war in three
 phases: Guerrilla Harassment; battles of an-
 nihilation by enlarged and better-equipped
 guerrilla units against isolated units; and
 finally, massive attacks by powerful guerrilla
 armies.  This is the kind of enemy we face
 in Vietnam-tough, determined, and ruthless.
 Right about now I think a little back-
 ground information about the country of
 South Vietnam would be in order.     South
 Vietnam  contains  roughly  65,000  square
 miles, slightly larger than the State of Iowa.
 It's approximately 585 miles long-and its
 width varies from 50  to  150 miles.   The
 northern area is dominated by rugged moun-
 tains, with flat, fertile stretches along the
 east  coast.   The central area  is  a large
 plateau.  The south is mostly the rice-rich
 Mekong Delta.
 The country has a monsoon climate-rainy
 and hot during one period, dry and hot dur-
 ing the other.  The north is dry while the
 south is rainy, and vice versa.
 The population of South Vietnam num-
 bers around 16 million.  About 85 % are Mon-
 goloid in origin.  The remaining 15% is com-
 prised of various groups, including the moun-
 tain tribesmen-or Montagnards.
 North of the 17th parallel lies North Viet-
 nam, a bit smaller in size-some 56 thousand
 square miles and roughly the same popula-
 tion as its neighbor to the South.  North
 Vietnam has its mountains and its plateaus
 as does the South.  The people are essen-
 tially of the same stock as those in South
 Vietnam.  In other words-North and South
 Vietnam are pretty much alike as far as
 geographical features and people are con-
 cerned.
 Logically, this leads to another question.
 Since the background and the people are the
 same-why are they fighting against each
 other?
 This seems an appropriate time to dispel
 a misconception held by many people.  If
 you have two different segments of people
 from the same basic group-fighting between
 themselves, this really constitutes a civil war.
 This is the misconception.  The fighting in
 Vietnam is not a civil war.  It is not a rebel-
 lion.                                                                                                                               It is naked, cold-blooded aggression
 from  North  Vietnam.   President  Johnson
 stated last year, "It is guided by North Viet-
 nam and spurred by Communist China.                                                                                                                                      Its
 goal is to conquer the South, to defeat Amer-
 ican power, and to extend the Asiatic domi-
 nion of Communism."
 The Vietnamese have asked our help in
 their struggle for freedom against Commu-
 nist domination.  We have promised assist-
 ance and are fulfilling the pledge given by
 three American Presidents since 1954.   As
 earlier  moral  support and  economic  aid
 proved insufficient, in the early '60's we com-
 mitted large numbers of military advisers
 and  huge  amounts  of      equipment   to
 strengthen Vietnam militarily.
 From May '65 through January '66, the
 Army deployed  two combat divisions and
 four brigades to the Republic.   The  173d
 Airborne Brigade on Okinawa deployed to
 Vietnam in May. It was followed by the
 2d Brigade of the 1st Infantry Division in
 July.  The  same  month,  the  1st Brigade
 of the 101st Airborne Division reached Viet-
 nam.                                                                                                                                      And in September, the   1st Cavalry
 Division  (Airmobile)  arrived, followed by
 the rest  of the  1st  Infantry Division in
 October.  In the closing days of last year
 and the start of this year, two brigades of the
 25th Infantry Division were dispatched from
 Hawaii to Vietnam.     Concurrently, the Ma-
 rines deployed  two                                                                                                                                        divisions and the Air
 Force  sent  several   tactical  air  command
 squadrons.   The Navy increased its fleet size
 with the addition of the atomic carrier Enter-
 prise and the Coast Guard sent a flotilla of
 patrol vessels to help prevent infiltration by
 sea.  A third brigade of the 25th Division is
 now In Vietnam.   Substantial forces from

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APPENDIX           June 8, 1966
 to give a good account of themselves against
 the Viet Cong.  And the valiant South Viet-
 namese armed forces have improved in effec-
 tiveness as they wage their long fight against
 the enemy.
 I would like to go into detail about the
 deployment of one of the divisions to Viet-
 nam-the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile)-
 I think that probably the most striking de-
 velopment in the Vietnam conflict is the
 acceptance of the helicopter in carrying out
 the concept of maximum mobility.
 The importance of mobility-and constant
 search of military commanders for greater
 mobility has been recognized since earliest
 times.  Julius Caesar, before embarking for
 Greece and the final battle which defeated
 Pompey-said this to his troops:  "Fellow
 soldiers; neither winter nor the delay of our
 comrades shall check my onset.  I consider
 speed the best substitute-the most potent
 thing in war is the unexpected." And you
 remember that famous saying attributed to
 the brilliant  Confederate cavalry general
 Nathan Forrest, "Get there fustest with the
 mostest.`'
 Army aviation has brought the ground
 soldier a degree of mobility unknown in the
 past.  He can almost be here-there-every-
 where at the same time.
 After three years of study, tests, and evalu-
 ation by the Army, the 1st Cavalry Division
 was deployed to Vietnam in just over a
 month from the date of Its activation on 1
 July 1965.  The major innovation of this
 division is the use, where practicable, of air-
 craft-mostly helicopters-instead of trucks,
 tanks, and personnel carriers, to speed up
 the movement of troops and supplies.
 The airmobile division is authorized 434
 aircraft, all but six of which are helicopters,
 compared with only 101 aircraft in the stand-
 ard division.  The new division has only
 1,600 ground vehicles, mostly jeeps, com-
 pared with 3,200 in the infantry division.
 The special advantages of the armobile
 division are summed up in this statement by
 Major General Harry W. O. Kinnard, the
 first commander of the 1st Cavalry Division:
 "In brief these include the use of air vehicles
 to move over difficult terrain-to operate
 over wider areas with an enhanced surveil-
 lance capability; and use of the helicopter to
 permit combat units to be introduced near
 their objective, not fatigued by marching,
 and in tactical formations-.  The division
 already has proven it has a very rapid speed
 of reaction inherent in our massed assault
 supported by either tube or rocket artillery
 as well as tactical air strikes. Finally, be-
 cause of its Inherent mobility, the division,
 even more than the insurgent, has the abil-
 ity to choose its own time and place either
 to fight or not as is most logical."
 With the buildup I have mentioned, there
 came supply and logistical problems. Before
 we get into the subject of these problems,
 let me give you some information about the
 general conditions the American servicemen
 must cope with.  The heat-the leeches-the
 diseases-the less rain-dampness-wind-
 sand--dust, and I could go on and on.  Let
 me make these conditions a bit more con-
 crete.   There's the sand-for one thing.
 Fine-white----shifting sand.  It gets Into
 your eyes and burns your face.  Its com-
 panion is red, clay-like dust.                    These take,
 their toll not only of men but also of equip-
 ment.   For  instance-we have some rotor
 blades for helicopters which normally have
 a service life of some 2,500 hours. In Viet-
 nam--in some instances, the life is much
 less--thanks to the sand and dust.
 Then there's the rain and the dampness.
 Again, these are felt by men and machines.
 When I visited the headquarters of the 1st
 Cavalry Division last October and November,
 it was raining when we landed.  We learned
 it had been raining for eight straight days.
 Clothes never really dry-mildew establishes
 itself on leather and metal and everything
 else.  To say the least-it's unpleasant and
 uncomfortable.  These few words are just
 to supplement what `you already know about
 the conditions in Vietnam. And conditions-
 especially when we get into the area of
 equipment-naturally lead to another ques-
 tion.  Are our men getting the equipment
 they need--in the quantities they need-at
 the time they need it?
 I'll only speak specifically of Army avia-
 tion-for again, that is the area with which
 I am most familiar.  Our men are getting
 what they need-tdhen they need it.  Right
 now we-along with the other services-use
 Red Ball express-which I'm sure will stir
 some of your World War It memories.
 For those who don't recollect and for the
 younger group, the original "Red Ball Ex-
 press" was created during the Allied sweep
 through  France  in  the  closing  stages  of
 World War IT.
 The momentum of the drive was threat-
 ened and fears were raised that the advance
 would even grind to a halt because bomb-
 damaged railroads couldn't handle the vast
 amounts of supplies needed at the front
 lines.
 To avert such a disastrous possibility, a
 huge fleet of trucks was assembled, a RED
 BALL signifying priority over other traffic
 was painted on the bumper, and essential
 supplies were carried to the front over shell-
 pocked highways as fast as the trucks could
 roll.  As a result, the drive was sustained
 without critical shortages.
 This same approach, with some stream-
 lining and modification, is now being used
 again.  This time the roads are air lanes
 stretching from depots in the United States
 to Vietnam and the trucks are four-engine
 jet aircraft.
 All of our equipment is being affected by
 the conditions I mentioned previously.  Also,
 around the clock use of the equipment leaves
 little or no time for preventive maintenance.
 This then increases the requirement for re-
 pair parts.  For the armada of U.S. equip-
 ment in Vietnam-fighter aircraft, helicop-
 ters, tanks, bulldozers, trucks, materiel han-
 dling equipment, and others-the essentials
 they must have to keep them operating are
 replacement repair parts.  To cope with this
 problem, the jet age "RED BALL Express"
 was organized with a fleet of jet transports
 carrying priority repair parts and equipment,
 all marked with the RED BALL.  The system
 is designed to have the required part in the
 hands of the mechanic in Vietnam within a
 maximum of seven days from the time the
 requisition reaches CONUS.
 Let me briefly explain how the supply sys-
 tem for emergency requirements other than
 Red Ball Express works.  I will confine my
 explanation. solely to the Aviation Materiel
 Command In St. Louis.
 Our system is built around a computer
 which sits in our head-quarters down in
 St. Louis.  This computer is bulging with
 information about Army aviation materiel.
 In fact-there are some two billion pieces
 of pertinent information stored in our mas-
 ter file.
 Each part of each of our aircraft has an
 identification number.  This number-along
 with other information about the part-is
 punched into a card.    In fact-we punch
 whole decks-as they are called--of such
 cards.  And we send these decks out to field
 installations.
 When the man in Saigon finds he needs a
 part--he pulls the appropriate card from his
 files and drop it into a transceiver.  This is
 a machine somewhat like a teletypewriter-
 except that it transmits punched informa-
 tion-rather than words,  The transceiver
 transmits the information to a major over-
 seas supply depot.  The information is then
 run through their computer, which deter-
 mines whether or not the depot has the de-
 sired item in stock. If It has, the computer
 directs shipment to the requestor.
 If the part is not in stock in the overseas
 depot the information is relayed into our
 computer.  Our  machine  ascertains-that
 Sharpe Army Depot in California is the clos-
 est to the requestor in Saigon.  The machine
 then checks the Inventory of Sharpe.  If the
 part is on hand there-the computer auto-
 matically punches out ' a shipping order to
 the depot.
 If, however, the computer discovers that
 Sharpe doesn't have the desired part-it au-
 tomatically then goes to the next closest
 Army Depot and repeats the same process.
 It continues this until it locates and orders
 shipment  of the part.  Finally, the com-
 puter makes an automatic adjustment of
 the inventory for that particular part in the
 particular depot-as well as making an ad-
 justment in our master inventory records in
 St. Louis.
 Sometimes the machine doesn't stop there.
 It may find that-after filling the requisi-
 tion-our total stock has dropped to a point
 where we must order more parts.  This sets
 off another chain reaction-the upshot of
 which is that a contract for re-order is sent
 to the manufacturer.  This contract natur-
 ally has a delivery date specified.                                                                                                                                  The corn-
 puter quietly sits back and does nothing
 more.  But if information is not fed into
 the machine.saying that the order has been
 filled and delivered to the various depots as
 directed-the machine kicks out a letter to
 the contractor telling him he's behind sched-
 ule.  And here a man finally gets into the
 act. He gets a copy of this letter-and he
 then seeks to determine the cause for the
 delay and resolve any problems which may
 have arisen.
 The  result?  As  I  said-high  priority
 requisitions for Vietnam are filled within
 seven days after the man in Saigon sets the
 wheels in motion. This computerized oper-
 ation-plus the superb support provided by
 the  Military Airlift Command of the Air
 Force-makes it possible to give our men
 over there what they want when they want
 it.
 In conclusion, these are exciting times in
 the Army.  Much has been done in the past
 year, but much more remains to be clone.  I
 assure you that the United States Armed
 Forces are fully aware of the trying days that
 lie ahead, in Vietnam and elsewhere, and are
 determined that these days will give way to a
 bright future for peace and freedom for
 mankind.  As the late President Kennedy
 proclaimed on his first day in office, "Let
 every nation know, whether it wishes us well
 or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any
 burden,   meet  any  hardship,  support  any
 friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival
 and the success of liberty."
 Today, I ask all of you to join with me in
 praying for our men who are fighting to keep
 free  all countries  from  opppression.  We
 should do our utmost to show to the world
 that America has not ended the only strug-
 gle worthy of man's unceasing sacrifice-the
 struggle to be free. Thank you l

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 HON. HASTINGS KEITH
 OF MASSACHUSETTS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 8, 1966
 Mr. QUILLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am in-
 serting at this point in the RECORD an
 editorial from the Monday, June 6, 1966,
 Issue of the Newport, Tenn., Plain Talk.
 This is a thoughtful article on what
 we are fighting in Vietnam, and I take
 this opportunity to bring these comments
 to the attention of my colleagues and the
 readers of the RECORD.
 VIET NAM IS PART OF GLOBAL CONFLICT WITH
 COMMUNISM-IT IS NOT JUST A "LOCAL WAR"
 Those who subscribe to ' the  Fulbright,
 Schlesinger, Kennedy views on Viet Nam that
 the conflict is not critically important, that
 we could pull out without disaster, that other
 areas of conflict In the world are more im-
 portant, ignore basic and fundamental facts.
 Viet Nam is not a local war.  It is a part
 of the global conflict between Communism
 and the free countries of the world.
 In the current issue of the American Le-
 gion magazine an article by Gerald L. Steibel
 entitled "If We Leave Viet Nam ? ? ` Then
 What?" is most interesting.
 Mr. Steibe'1 points out that three Amer-
 ican Presidents since 1954 have had to face
 the truth in Viet Nam, while many home-
 front critics, including some in  Congress,
 have simply avoided it or tried to put it
 aside. The responsibility is not basically on
 their shoulders.
 Steibel says, "To the Communists, Viet
 Aram was never a local war. In 1961, Soviet
 boss Khrushchev publicly spelled out that
 the 'war of liberation' in Viet Nam 'must not
 be identified with local wars' and that all
 where are in the `front

 '6teibel points out that' General Giap, the               Viet Nam the results could be catastrophic.
 North Vietnamese Defense Minister himself,                He feels that present countries in Southeast

 zine                                                     Mr. KEITH.   Mr. Speaker, as more
 that our government attempted to con-
 ciliate Red China after the 1949 takeover   and more of our young men are called
 when Chiang Kai-shek was driven to For- to serve in Vietnam, it becomes impera-
 mosa.  Our diplomatic corps stayed on main-
 land China and we did everything to at-
 tempt to establish a relationship with the
 Red Chinese government.  The plain fact is
 that China threw the book at the United
 States from the very beginning and forced
 us to take action in supporting Chiang Kai-
 shek simply by driving our diplomats out.
 Again in Korea, we attempted to conciliate
 the Communists and it ended in the Korean
 War and a disaster.  However, the Korean
 War was a shock to the Soviet because it dis-
 covered that the United States would fight
 and that is something that they had not
 believed  possible.  Out  of this  experience
 came what today is referred to as Russian
 "peaceful coexistence."   Commander James
 says that although it is still practiced with
 nasty belligerence; it is an improvement over
 Soviet dreams of armed conquest of an un-
 armed world that preceded 1950 and led to
 the Russian role in Korea.
 Red China today scorns "peaceful coexist-
 ence" and is openly split with Communist
 Russia on this very issue.  We cannot see
 where giving ground would result in any-
 thing  but  another  disaster                                                                            for  the  free
 world.
 Vice President HUMPHREY pointed out re-
 cently: "Aggression unchecked is aggression
 unleashed. If we have not learned that in
 the last 25 years we have learned nothing in
 this century."
 tive that we take a sharp look at our
 system for selecting those who will go to
 defend this country.
 Nor only do gross inequities exist be-
 tween the practices of draft boards in
 one State and another-but even among
 the draft boards within each State. Fur-
 ther,  present  priorities  discriminate
 heavily against certain groups of young
 men-in a way that far surpasses what
 recent civil rights laws were passed to
 prevent.
 A recent editorial in the Old Colony
 Memorial in the town of Plymouth,
 Mass., presents a concise picture of the
 present system and its defects and would
 merit reading by a wide audience:
 REVAMPING THE DRAFT LAW
 The present draft law favors the college
 student and penalizes those who lack the
 money, brains or initiative to seek a higher
 education.                                                                  There  is  a  growing  feeling
 throughout the country, in which we share
 with strong conviction, that this inequity,
 as far as possible, should be eliminated.                                                              Too
 often going to college is being used as a way
 of saving one's own neck at the other fellow's
 expense.
 We say correct inequity "as far as pos-
 sible" for the reason that even before a fin-
 ger has been lifted in this direction we know
 that perfect justice is impossible.  Human
 nature and the social structure make abso-
 lute equity a goal beyond reach.

 good soldier has to be a man of action, capa-

 It is also true that military life often does
 attract young men unable or unwilling to
 get along in civilian pursuits.
 But even allowing for all inherent defects,
 real or imagined, of the military situation,
 the fact remains, so we deeply believe, that
 merely going to college should not be used
 as an excuse for escaping a soldier's obli-
 gations, as some sort of trick.
 To permit this sort of thing to continue
 makes for great bitterness among those who
 take the rap for the smart boys.  This bit-
 terness all but invites political exploitation
 of  an  authoritarian  nature.    From  the
 standpoint of the national wellbeing, fa-
 voritism in the draft over the long run is
 very bad indeed.
 Moreover, If It is true that the bulk of
 American college students have a superior
 intelligence, this intelligence is badly needed
 as leaven, above all in the "policy" type of
 small wars and pacifications common these
 days. After all, restraint and understanding
 are of the essence in this limited kind of
 conflict, quite different from the case in all-
 out wars of survival.
 Finally, it is unjust to favor one group
 to another's gross disadvantage.   There is
 no dodging this moral issue.
 No draft law can be 100 per cent equitable.
 But the one we have now is clearly in need
 of improvement.

 PROJECT IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE: REBUILDING
 OF BARK "KAIULANI" LAGS
 (By Peter O'Loughlin)
 MANILA.-In a dilapidated shipyard near
 Manila, a gaunt American sea captain is
 fighting a losing battle to restore the rusty
 hulk of the three masted bark Kaiulani, last
 of            17,000 American-built square riggers.
 "If we don't get some money soon, the
 whole project will come to a stop," said Cap-
 tain James Kleinschmidt, a director of the
 National Maritime Historical Society and the
 man charged with getting the old ship'sailing
 again.
 "We can't go on the way we are."
 The project to restore the vessel to its
 former glory is foundering in a sea of finan-
 cial troubles.
 If it sinks without trace, the result will
 be an embarrassing blow to American pres-
 tige in the Philippines-the ship was given
 to  the United States by former President
 Diosdado Macapagal as a goodwill gesture
 from the people of the Philippines.
 President Johnson accepted it at a White
 House ceremony in 1964 and directed the
 Maritime Historical Society to restore it and
 get it back to America.
 This was easier said than done, considering
 the ship had not sailed since 1942, was riddled
 with rust, had no sails, masts, rigging or
 spars.
 COST $200,000
 The society, hard up for funds, estimated
 the restoration costs at about $200,000 and
 that it would take some two or three years
 to get the Kaiulani shipshape.
 So far considerably less than $100,000 has

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. SPARK M. MATSUNAGA
 OF HAWAII
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 8, 1966
 Mr. MATSUNAGA. Mr. Speaker, the
 history of our maritime industry is one
 in which we can all take pride.  The
 American-built square riggers of the 19th
 century were the envy of their times.
 These ships played an active part in the
 early growth of our maritime industry.
 One of the most famous of these ships
 is the Kaiulani, named after a Hawaiian
 princess.  This ship, the biggest three-
 masted bark ever built in the United
 been raised by public appeals in the U.S. and
 despite moral support from the U.S. Embassy
 in Manila, the project, according to Captain
 Kleinschmidt is way behind.
 "We are in a bad way," said the 43-year-
 old former Merchant Marine skipper.  "It
 would be a tremendous loss of face for us to
 back out now.
 "Not only that, it would be a great blow
 to the United States-?-Kaiulani is a priceless
 relic of our maritime past."
 The only help on the horizon is a resolu-

 Who has been working on the ship for ten                  vessel picked up a load of explosives and
 solid months, any help is welcome.                        sailed for Sydney.  But the captain heard by
 MARITIME HISTORIAN         radio that Japanese submarines had attacked
 the Australian seaport on M   7, 1942 and

 a maritime historian, quit his job as assist-             to put in to Hobart, Tasmania.
 ant curator of the famous Marine Historical               In Hobart, Wigsten charged the crew with
 Association in Mystic, Connecticut, to come               mutiny and had most of them thrown in the

 some time ago if it were not for the help of
 local businessmen whom Kleinschmidt has
 been able to interest in the project.
 Kleinschmidt, who has been returned to
 the active Navy rank of lieutenant while he
 is working on the project, operates from a
 cubby hole office in a wartime quonset hut
 in the Philippine Navy yard at Cavite.
 He has a staff of 28 Filipino workmen and
 a secretary.
 PHOTOGRAPHS
 His office is decorated with photographs, of
 the Kaiulani under full sail taken in the
 days when It was one of the fastest sailing
 vessels afloat.
 The photographs are a marked contrast to
 the patched and grimy hull moored a few
 yards away.
 "The hull is basically sound despite all
 the  years  of  neglect,"  said  Kleinschmidt,
 kicking a large chunk of rust across the deck.
 "Some of it will have to be replaced to
 make her seaworthy.  The whole upperdeck
 will have to be renewed as well.  It's in a
 hopeless condition."
 The fact that,Katulani is still afloat at all
 is a tribute to Its builders.
 BUILT IN 1899
 The ship was designed and built in 1899
 by Arthur Sewall and Company, of Bath,
 Maine, as a fast sugar packet for the Ha-
 waiian  trading                                                                                                                                                                     firm of H.  Hackfield  and
 Company.
 It was named after an Hawaiian princess
 who died the year the ship was launched.
 Two hundred and 25-feet long, displacing
 1500 tons and with a cargo capacity of 2,400
 tons, Kaiulani was the biggest three-masted
 bark ever built in the United States.
 In 1907 Kaiulani visited Newcastle, the big
 port on the east coast of Australia to pick
 up a load of coal and got involved in a strike
 that kept 130 windjammers tied up in port,
 probably the last great collection of sailing
 ships'ever seen.
 Thirty-five years later Kaiulani went back
 to Australia, a final voyage that led to the
 Philippines.
 By 1910 steam ships had driven the old
 "downeasters" off the Honolulu sugar trade
 and Kaiulani was sold to the Alaska Packers'
 Association.
 Renamed the Star of Finland, she ran sup-
 plies to the isolated Alaskan canneries for
 many years until finally her owners put her
 into mothballs.
 In 1940 a San Francisco group bought the
 ship, restored Its original" name and Loaded
 it  with  timber.   On  September  25,  1941
 Kaiulani set sail for Durban under the com-
 mand                                                                                                                                of  a  cantankerous  Swede             named
 Hjalmar Wigsten.

 Supplies to the Vietcong
 OF REMAR
 KS
 U
 HON. JACK FEDWARDS
 OF ALABAMA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 8, 1966
 Mr. EDWARDS        of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Speaker, there is growing evidence of the
 importance of Cambodia in funneling
 supplies to the Vietcong in South Viet-
 nam.
 It has already been pointed out that
 ships are reaching Cambodia's capital
 city of Pnompenh by traveling on the
 Mekong River directly across South Viet-
 nam itself.
 Supplies can also be off-loaded at the
 port city of Sihanoukville from where
 they can travel inland on a road built
 with heavy investments of American aid.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- APPENDIX           June 8, 1966
 Now comes news that 100 supply trucks
 a month are moving through Cambodia
 with materials to support the Vietcong.
 The article as it appears in the Christian
 Science Monitor for June 1 follows:
 LAOTIAN  SAYS  REDS  USE  TRAIL  To  SUPPLY
 VIETCONG
 ((By Reuters)
 VIETIANNE, Leos.- Gen. Thao Ma, Lao, Air
 Force commander, asserts 100 supply trucks
 a month are passing along what he calls "the
 Sihanouk Trail" through northern Cambodia
 to the Vietcong guerrillas in South Vietnam.
 Traffic on this reported new route-named
 after Cambodian Chief of State Prince No-
 rodom Sihanouk-is expected by Lao mili-
 tary sources to increase,` with the so-called
 He Chi Minh Trail through southern Laos
 under frequent attack.
 Neutral Cambodia has strongly denied al-
 legations that its territory is being used by
 North Vietnam for aggression against the
 south.  Cambodia has told Britain and the
 Soviet Union-cochairmen of the 1954 Gen-
 eva conference on Indochina-that it will
 defend its frontiers against 'any violation and
 may ask for the help of friendly countries.
 Cambodia also reserved the right to ap-
 peal to the United Nations General Assem-
 bly or any other international organization
 against a reported United States decision to
 authorize American forces in South Vietnam
 to fire across the Cambodian border in self-
 defense.
 The State Department protested this month
 to Cambodia that Viet Cong troops were us-
 ing Cambodian territory to launch attacks
 against United States forces in South Viet-
 nam.
 General Ma said the Communists are bring-
 ing supplies into Cambodia by sea, then send-
 ing them by barge and truck up the Se Kong
 River into Laos.
 Fruits of the Interparliamentary Union
 Conference at Canberra
 EX'T'ENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. W. R. POAGE
 OF TEXAS
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, June 8, 1966
 Mr. POAGE.                   Mr. Speaker, while in
 Canberra attending a conference of the
 Interparliamentary Union last month, it
 was my privilege to meet and greet one
 of our former colleagues, the Honorable
 Omalio Osias, once Resident Commis-
 sioner from the Philippines to the U.S.
 Congress.  Those of us who knew him
 remember him as a great and a forceful
 patriot.  Today he is a senator of the
 Republic of the Philippines.  As such, he
 represented his country at the Canberra
 conference.
 During the years, Senator Osias has
 lost none of his fervor, his logic, or his
 patriotism.  He delivered one of the
 great speeches of the conference in sup-
 port of the American position.  More
 recently, he spoke to his own people on
 the floor of the Philippine Senate in the
 course of debate on a bill to expand the
 Philippine aid in Vietnam.  This speech
 was so cogent and so forceful that I ask
 unanimous consent to include excerpts
 therefrom at this time:
 Mr. President, what I am about to say may
 be rather Controversial.  It may invite criti-
 cism of my humble person.  I will say
 bluntly and without reserve that one rea-
 son that moves me to support the Vietnam
 aid is my will and desire to lend cooperation
 to the United States of America.  It will be
 said that I am one of the puppets of Amer-
 ica.                                                                        I am past the age when I am onion-
 skinned.  I have been toughened by Qbsta-
 eles,  difficulties,  sufferings.  I  know  that
 from the Communists circles I may be cited
 by the statement I am about to make as a
 stooge of the United States. Over and above,
 possible adverse criticisms directed against
 me I follow the dictates of my conscience
 and express my gratitude to the American
 government and people of the United States.
 I do not want the Filipinos to be ungrateful
 to America.  And I regret that there are
 some  demonstrators  who  have  given  the
 wrong impression that the Filipinos may be
 anti-American. I deny that there is anti-
 Americanism on the part of the Filipino
 people.  There is pro-Filipinism, yes.  I am
 of that persuasion.
 One placard carried by some misguided
 demonstrators  had  this  slogan:  "America
 Destroyer of Human Liberty."  That is not
 an expression emanating from the hearts of
 thinking   Filipinos.  The   correct slogan
 should  be "America    Defender   of  Human
 Liberty."  That is borne out by the facts of
 history.
 The young people who demonstrated in
 Manila for or against the Vietnam Bill merit
 praise and respect because no group resorted
 to violence.  The opponents were not unduly
 influenced by foreign Communist agitators
 who slipped into the city to organize leftists
 and demonstrators.  They only managed to
 inject some indecorous, denunciatory utter-
 ances  and                                                                                 arouse some  hatred  against
 America and its supposed imperialistic de-
 signs.  I am constrained to say to the youth
 that they are not in the right direction when
 they develop hate toward men and nations
 who are sympathetic and helpful to our peo-
 ple. It Is disservice to weaken and not
 strengthen amity among nations that cherish
 ideals and aspirations identical with ours.
 Mr. President, I just came back from par-
 ticipation in the Inter-Parliamentary meet-
 ing at Canberra, Australia.  I was impressed
 and I was also distressed by the concerted
 attacks of the Communist Delegates led by
 those from the Soviet Union attacking Amer-
 ica and her allies as imperialists.  As long
 as the attacks were concentrated upon Amer-
 ica,                                                                        I did not feel  called, upon to reply
 because the American Delegates were there
 to defend themselves.  But when they ac-
 cused America and her allies as being im-
 perialistic, I felt the Philippines was alluded
 to and I thought I would be remiss in my
 duty if I did not take up the cudgels.  Si-
 lence may be interpreted as assent.
 I  spoke  before  the parliamentarians of
 many countries in Canberra, Australia, as a
 Philippine Delegate in defense of the com-
 mon stand of the Republic of the United
 States and the Republic of the Philippines
 on the Vietnam conflict.  The charge of im-
 perialism against "America and her allies"
 clearly included the Philippines.  I repeated
 the Spanish adage, "Dime con quien andas y
 to dire quien eres."  Tell me with whom you
 associate and I will tell you who you are.  I
 made no secret of my friendship and respect
 for the United States of America with which
 the Philippines is associated on the most
 friendly and intimate terns.  I said it is ri-
 diculous for the Communist group to con-
 sider the Philippines, a country relatively
 small, weak, and poor, a country operating
 under a Constitution committed to peace, a
 country whose  greatest hero  and martyr,
 Rizal, was a man of peace, as imperialistic.
 I likewise said then and there and I say
 here and now that America by her record in
 the Philippines can not be Said to be im-
 perialistic.  She is to be admired for sending
 over 200,000 of the consummate flower of her
 manhood to fight in a war in the Oriental
 theater.  She is after no conquest of terri-
 tory.  She is not Spending millions for sell-
 aggrandizement.  She is in an undertaking
 in the defense of a cause, in the pursuit of an
 ideal more precious than property or ll:te.
 We were critical of American policy that was
 primarily  Europe  oriented.  We  ought  to
 commend her now that America's policy is
 Asia oriented.
 On the eve of our making a fateful deci-
 sion I desire to emphasize friendship and
 cooperation with the United States of Amer-
 ica as a vital part of my stand in favor of the
 Vietnam Bill which provides for our sending
 an engineering construction team with se-
 curity support.  Permit me to touch on some
 points which are pertinent to our delibera-
 tion based upon experience and matters that
 spring from knowledge of the facts which I
 positively know.
 In the United States there are a great many
 foreign students.  One university student in
 New York City coming from a Communist
 Country one day wanted to go across the
 Hudson River to visit a friend.  Accustomed
 to the practices in her totalitarian native
 land she went to a police officer and said, "I
 wish to ask a permit to go to New Jersey."'
 The police officer said, "What for?"
 "Well," she said, "that is what we have to
 do in my country."
 The officer very good naturedly said, "Go
 right ahead, my dear young lady.  You do
 not need any such permit in this country."
 This incident is brought to the fore at
 this juncture to underscore contrasting con-
 ditions in a totalitarian country and a free
 democracy.  I was one of the early pen-
 sionados or government students sent to the
 United States during America's administra-
 tion of Philippine affairs under Hon. William
 H. Taft, then Governor-General of the Phil-
 ippines.  I believe the Filipino students sent
 to America at the expense of our govern-
 ment will testify that all of us were given
 absolute freedom.     There was no regulation
 of our movement;      there was no effort to
 regiment our minds; there was no attempt to
 exercise  thought  control.  We  could  go
 where we  wanted  to    go;  we  could take
 courses or subjects we wanted to take; we
 Could  express verbally  or  in  writing the
 sentiments that we pleased.  And yet that
 was an investment of America because by
 the grant and observance of freedom, the
 students came back better Filipinos and at
 the same time admirers of America, her peo-
 ple, and her institutions.
 Then I had the good fortune of being
 elected Philippine Resident Commissioner to
 fight for our rights, for our interests, for our
 freedom and independence in the Congress
 of the United States.  My first week in the
 United States House of Representatives wit-
 nessed  my participating  in a  rough-arid-
 tumble  debate  because  the  distinguished
 Congressman  from Colorado, Mr.  Timber-
 lake, was defending a bill to exclude Philip-
 pine sugar from the American market.    I
 arose and fought that bill. I said that was
 not in keeping with democratic justice-the
 author was a Democrat-that was not in
 keeping with republican justice. I think
 the majority at that time were Republicans,
 and that was not in keeping with American
 justice.
 I fought the plan of excluding Philippine
 sugar because, I said, Americans cannot do
 that justly and fairly, for that would be
 discriminating against Philippine products
 while all American products go free of duty
 and without limitation to my country.  I
 was fighting on the floor of the House of
 Representatives consisting of 450 members
 or thereabouts against a Congressman who
 was an American protecting American in-
 terests.
 The majority of the members of Congress
 saw the justice of the Philippine stand and

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE             June 8, 1966
 tion of a most fascinating office: the
 ombudsman.  As I have informed my
 colleagues on many occasions, the om-
 budsman is a form of citizens' defender;
 he is the man who fights city hall. Often,
 the cases and complaints which come to
 the ombudsman are trivial, but justice
 is never a trivial matter.
 Several weeks ago, I complimented the
 Evening Star's "Action Line" column and
 said that this column is today the near-
 est thing the District has to an ombuds-
 man. I also stated that I intend to pro-
 pose a bill which would create an official
 ombudsman for the District of Colum-
 bia. This bill is very near completion.
 WTOP radio and television has recent-
 ly run a number of editorials urging the
 creation of an ombudsman here in the
 District of Columbia. Jack Jurey, speak-
 ing for WTOP, calls the ombudsman a
 "public protector." I support and shall
 introduce a bill to create such an om-
 budsman,  the  public  protector  that
 WTOP refers to.  It should be made
 perfectly clear, however, that an om-
 budsman is not a substitute for local self-
 government for the District of Columbia.
 I voted for the Senate-passed home rule
 bill and will continue to support princi-
 ples of local self-government.
 I ask unanimous consent to insert at
 this point_'n the RECORD the editorials
 referred to.
 There being no objection, the editorials
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [This editorial was broadcast on June 2 and
 3, 1966, over WTOP radio and television]
 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC PROTECTOR-I
 This is a WTOP Editorial.
 Since about two out of three people who
 live in the District weren't born here, the
 residents of this community need all the help
 they can get in dealing with their municipal
 authorities.  Even a native-born Washing-
 tonian has trouble understanding how this
 city runs.
 What we have, of course, is a board of over
 lords appointed by the President; a federal
 judiciary with many independent ideas;  a
 school board which apparently is responsible
 to no one;  an astounding proliferation of
 boards, agencies and commissions, many of
 which never meet; various and sundry con-
 gressmen who are enmeshed in District af-
 fairs for one reason or another; and, helping
 support the whole structure, a DC bureauc-
 racy consisting of thousands  of employes
 who have come to understand that, under the
 present scheme of things, what the ordinary
 Washington citizen may want has very low
 priority.
 It is asking entirely too much to expect
 that ordinary citizen to grapple with the
 mechanism of local DC government.        Too
 many officials don't really care about his
 problems; too many functionaries are out to
 lunch; too much paper is shuffled too rapidly
 for any constructive assistance.  The only
 solution  we can see--short  of an   elected
 local government under which the Individual
 would mean something-is a Public        Pro-
 tector.                                                                                     This would be a man, paid from pub-
 lic funds, who would have the authority to
 receive  and  act  on citizen complaints  of
 official abuses and transgressions. The Pub-
 lic Protector idea is nothing new there have
 been such Individuals in Scandinavia since
 about    the  beginning  of  the  nineteenth
 century.  Because Washington, D.C., has a
 local government with a nineteenth century
 flavor, now seems a good time to adopt the
 Public Protector concept.

 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC PROTECTOR-II
 Mr. BOGGS. Mr. President, an edi-
 torial in the June 7 Issue of the Morning
 News of Wilmington, Del? makes the
 point that churches have found pollu-
 tion of our air and water relevant to the
 1,500-year-old tradition of praying for
 a bountiful harvest.
 The comment which the editorial cites
 indicates how widespread is the national
 concern for cleaning up air and water
 pollution.
 This national concern is also reflected
 In the sincere efforts of the Special Sub-
 committee on Air and Water Pollution
 to provide the best possible tools to deal
 with the problem.
 Because of its relevance, I ask unani-
 mous consent that the editorial entitled
 "The Church Versus Pollution" be in-
 serted at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From the Wilmington Morning News,- Julie
 7, 1966]
 THE CHURCH VERSUS POLLUTION
 One of the favorite words in religious cir-
 cles nowadays is "relevant."  Churchmen are
 constantly telling each other that If they
 want anybody to listen, they must make the
 church's message relevant to modern times,
 Now there has come to our desk a church
 pronouncement that seems about as relevant
 as a church announcement can get.
 It comes from Fortress Press and it was
 designed for use as the back page of congre-
 gational bulletins on Rogate Sunday about
 three weeks ago.
 First it tells how that particular Sunday
 became an occasion of prayers for a bounti-
 ful harvest, a tradition that dates back to
 the year 452.  Then it proceeds to make the
 1,500-year-old tradition relevant:
 "Since that time, man has improved his
 stewardship of the soil, and we stand blessed
 today with abundant harvests.  But what of
 the rest of man's God-given environment--
 land, air, water and their natural beauty?
 "Across the nation, wells are running dry,
 reservoirs are depleted, fish are dying, beaches
 are unsafe for bathing and communities ra-
 tion water.  Yet man heedlessly dumps over
 a million gallons of waste every second into
 the nation's waterways.
 "This irresponsible stewardship has suc-
 ceeded in polluting every major river system
 and earned the caricature of 'a man worried
 about water, standing knee-deep in sewage
 and shooting rockets at the moon.'  As the
 crisis intensifies, let us heed the call to
 prayer, join the effort to remove waste and
 restore to natural purity the abundance of
 water God wishes to provide for all."
 Some  people  who  believe  the     church
 should stay out of political issues may react
 unfavorably, but others will be happy to see
 a moral issue drawn on a subject where
 communities too often drag their feet.
 We happen to believe the word-picture of
 modern man standing knee deep in sewage is
 overdrawn, and that it is an over-simplifica-
 tion to describe every imperfect sewage sys-
 tem as irresponsible stewardship.  But we
 share the desire for unpolluted water sys-
 tems as a national goal and welcome the
 interest of religious leaders in this national
 problem.
 OMBUDSMAN FOR THE DISTRICT OF
 COLUMBIA
 Mr. LONG of Missouri.  Mr. President,
 for several months, the Senate Subcom-
 mittee on Administrative Practice and
 Procedure has been studying the opera-
 This is a WTOP Editorial.
 Question: Who speaks for the citizens of
 the District of Columbia?
 Answer: Nobody.  Not really and officially.
 The resident of this beleaguered enclave
 of authoritarianism quickly learns several
 lessons if he attempts to deal directly with
 District of Columbia government.  First, that
 it is always difficult and sometimes virtually
 impossible to reach the official directly in-
 volved in a citizen's complaint.                                                                                                                                            Second, that
 the official, if he is finally 'located, Is too
 often unresponsive to some of the normal
 pressures of public office.
 In any other American city, a taxpayer may
 call his mayor or councilman and place a
 detailed, specific complaint about some error
 of commission or omission,  That taxpayer
 may be sure that his complaint will receive
 attention because there is a vote involved.
 Nothing moves a politician quite so quickly
 as the prospect of gaining or losing a vote.
 In the District there are the District of Co-
 lumbia  Commissioners,  two  civilians,  one
 military.  These gentlemen are estimable, no
 doubt, but are not chosen by Washington
 citizens.  They are appointed by the Presi-
 dent, not elected by the people. Consequent-
 ly the District Building's response time to
 the wishes of Washingtonians is lethargic.
 Indeed,  one  of  the  Commissioners'  prime
 functions is to close their doors and lower
 their window shades so as to make basic de-
 cisions concerning this city well away from
 the scrutiny of the inhabitants most directly
 concerned.
 At the White House, the President's District
 of Columbia adviser has an office, but is only
 fleetingly in touch with day-by-day opera-
 tions of District government.  On the Hill,, the
 congressional panjandrums are, for the most
 part, aloof from run-of-the-mill District of
 Columbia problems.
 Meantime, the District of Columbia bu-
 reaucracy  grinds  along-making  decisions
 and issuing orders, shielded by platoons of
 secretaries and assistants.
 There is little help for Washington resi-
 dents there-which is why this city, perhaps
 more than any other on the North American
 continent, needs a Public Protector to help
 safeguard the little guy from a big city, non-
 representative government.

 speaking for WTOP.

 DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PUBLIC PROTECTOR-III
 This is a WTOP Editorial.
 We've been talking the last several days
 about the need to establish a Public Pro-
 tector's office in the District of Columbia.
 What is a Public Protector?  In those coun-
 tries where the concept has been tested-in-
 eluding Sweden and New Zealand-a Public
 Protector (or Ombudsman) has various def-
 nitions.   He is a "guardian of the rights of
 citizens in their relation with the public
 authorities."  He has "a healthy preventive
 influence upon officials who might tend to
 be high-handed, arrogant, negligent or for-
 getful of the limits of their powers."
 Each public protectorship must be tailored
 to circumstances and Washington, D.C., with
 a unique lack of self-determination; would
 have to establish its own ground rules.
 To our way of thinking, the District of Co-
 lumbia Protector ought to have a broad grant
 of authority.
 He should have an office in some central
 location, probably the District Building.
 He should have a staff adequate to handle
 the load of complaints and investigations.
 He should be a free agent. He should not
 be under anyone's thumb.  He should have
 access to any official of District government
 on any matter relating to that official's duties.

 He should have the right to recommend to
 the Commissioners any changes and reforms
 he thinks necessary.
 He should have the right to examine offi-
 cial DC records and make whatever inquiries
 he thinks necessary.
 He should be free to publicize whatever he
 thinks necessary in the performance of his
 duties.
 This Public Protector, In short, would be a
 powerful and effective intermediary between
 the people of the District and their present
 unrepresentative government.  Lacking home
 rule, the residents of this city at least would
 have a champion of their own, not a series
 of disinterested appointees.

 Is a Swedish word meaning representative,
 in this base a person assigned to represent
 individuals in their dealings with bureauc-
 racy.               We prefer the term Public Protector,
 which we've been using in. our editorials of
 the last several days.
 Under the terms of the Long bill, the DC
 Public Protector-or Ombudsman-would be
 appointed by the President for a three-year
 term and would receive a salary of $25,000 a
 year.
 His duties would be to receive complaints
 from DC residents about the operations of
 their government, investigate whether those
 complaints are justified and do what he can
 to correct matters.  He could make specific
 recommendations to the DC commissioners
 or to Congress and could publicize any of
 his findings.
 This, in effect, is a way for the ordinary
 man to communicate with and make an im-
 pression on those who conduct the DC gov-
 ernment.  As we all know, that government
 is now immune to many citizen pressures
 because the District is governed by autoc-
 racy, not democracy.  If any city needs a
 Public Protector for its local citizenry, Wash-
 ington is it.
 The Public Protector bill will go either to
 the Senate District Committee or to the Ad-
 ministrative Practices and Procedures Sub-
 committee, of which Senator LONG is chair-
 map.  Either way, We'd like to have hearings
 held to see if the public supports the Public
 Protector idea for Washington.

 Mr. SALTONSTALL.  Mr. President,
 when we hear so much criticism of our
 efforts to help the South Vietnamese
 maintain their independence, it is grati-
 fying to see evidence of support for our
 position there.  The communicants of
 the Aldersgate Methodist Church in
 Chelmsford, Mass., have expressed their
 feelings in a most heartening affirmation
 of belief in the principles for which we
 are fighting.  This statement of position
 appeared in the Lowell Sun on May 11
 and I call it to the attention of my col-
 leagues. It expresses very well I think
 the essence of why we are in Vietnam
 and I ask unanimous consent to have it
 printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the

 A MAYOR TELLS HOW TO MODERN-
 IZE AMERICA'S CITIES
 Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, Mr. Her-
 man W. Goldner, mayor of St. Peters-
 burg, Fla., has written a thought-provok-
 ing article on the fiscal problems of
 American cities in the April issue of Na-
 tion's Business.  Titled "A Mayor Tells
 How To Modernize America's Cities," the
 article has some interesting observations
 regarding Federal, State, and local re-
 sponsibilities for metropolitan problems
 and alternative suggestions for meeting
 those problems.
 Mayor Goldner is a member of the Ad-
 visory Commission on Intergovernmental
 Relations and of the Board of Trustees
 of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He is
 12045
 a businessman-attorney, now serving his
 third term as mayor of St. Petersburg.
 His article deserves the attention of
 Members of Congress and State and local
 leaders.  I ask unanimous consent that
 it be printed in the RECORD at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From Nation's Business, April 19661
 A MAYOR TELLS How To MODERNIZE AMERICA'S
 CITIES
 President Johnson wants "a massive pro-
 gram," to attack the problems of America's
 cities including "demonstration  cities"  In
 slum sectors and model communities in the
 suburbs, teacher corps in slum areas, rent
 subsidies and anti crime and anti pollution
 programs for urban areas.  This is all in ad-
 dition to an array of existing programs.
 Against this background, Nation's Business
 presents the views of an authority who feels
 federal efforts are best devoted to enabling
 localities to solve their own problems.
 Too many of our ailing cities today are
 calling for massive doses of federal aid as a
 cure-all, complaining bitterly that they do
 not have the resources to heal their own
 maladies.
 They  are wrong.  They  have  potential
 cures at hand if they will honestly seek them
 out.
 Most  of  our  urban  areas  are stopped
 tantalizingly near to solutions by archaic
 laws and equally out-of-date thinking. They
 need not only more money but new systems
 and tools-from super-cities to computers-
 to help meet people's needs.
 If most of the nation's municipal govern-
 ments were private corporations, they would
 be out of business when the next payroll
 comes due because they cannot build the
 fiscal and organizational resources needed to
 ices, maintenance and capital improvements
 without adequate income.
 No  sane  businessman  would  consider
 forming a corporation which must rely upon
 its "competitors" for revenue.
 Yet municipal governments, as they exist
 today, are comparable to private firms which
 have gone into business without the ability
 to sustain their endeavors financially.
 Our cities and urban areas must rely pri-
 marily  upon  sources  of  income  already
 tapped by their "competitors" in govern-
 ment-the county, state and federal systems.
 And when our cities  find they cannot
 function fiscally, they begin to call loudly
 for help and too often the first call is for
 federal cash and lots of it.
 Our cities, often neglected In the past by
 unsympathetic  state   legislatures, expect
 some return on the federal taxes paid by
 their citizens.
 Massive federal aid, however, can mean
 an atrophying of municipal self-reliance. It
 causes a breakdown in planning to meet
 future needs; the feeling is that "if we run
 into trouble we can always  go to Wash-
 ington  and  hook  onto  some  program  or
 other."
 It leads, furthermore, to a distortion in
 allocation of local resources on a sound pri-
 ority basis. The temptation is great to con-
 centrate local spending on projects for which
 federal grants are  available, regardless  of
 need.
 Urban problems must be solved at the
 urban level. The federal government should
 lend financial assistance only in those areas
 meeting basic criteria, the most important
 being that an honest local effort has failed.
 This is not to deny Washington's responsi-
 bility, which exists if only because federal

 spendtig ultimately taps the same till as
 local government.  But straight substitu-
 tion of federal programs for local programs
 is wrong.
 The true federal responsibility, it seems
 to me, is to, create an environment wherein
 the cities can better solve their own prob-
 lems with their own resources.
 Municipal officials, myself included, jump
 at the opportunity to testify before congres-
 sional committees and point out that the
 220 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas
 (SMSA's)  as defined by the Bureau of the
 Census contain over three fourths of our
 people.   We emphasize that in these areas
 occur most of the poverty, delinquency and
 traffic congestion in the country and that
 these are national problems requiring finan-
 cial aid in large doses.
 However, there are some other shattering
 facts about these SMSA's and their own
 financial potentials which we mayors fail to
 mention;
 They account for three quarters of our
 bank clearings.
 They account for four fifths of all value
 added by manufacture. .
 They  contain  four  fifths  of  all  bank
 deposits.
 And most important of all, at least 80 per
 cent of all federal personal income taxes are
 collected from people within their bounda-
 ries.                    The personal income tax is the major.
 source of federal revenue from which fed-
 eral grants-in-aid are financed.
 Of course, the difficulty is that within the
 BMSA's the problems (poverty, crime, etc.)
 are not in the same jurisdiction as the fiscal
 resources.  Combined action by state and
 local governments is essential to meet these
 disparities.  One of the questions we in
 municipal government must honestly begin
 to ask ourselves is:
 Are federal funds too often taken by local
 governments simply because they are avail-
 able?
 We must soon seek the establishment of
 realistic criteria for the giving and receiving
 of federal funds by local governmental units.
 I suggest some of the points to be considered
 are:
 1. Is there a real need for federal funds
 for the particular local program for which
 they are sought?  How urgent is that need
 and what is the honest ability of the local
 government to meet that need?
 2. What realistic formula  can we agree
 upon to indicate the amount of local effort
 being brought to bear upon the particular
 problem for which federal funds are sought?
 9. Can  this  formula include  an honest
 appraisal of the tax base in use by the local
 unit and can it determine the extent to
 which the local unit is taxing, or otherwise
 seeking to raise money, to meet its needs?
 In addition, I believe we must have some
 hard and fast guidelines outlining the scope
 of federally funded local programs.  When
 do they begin, how broad an area do they
 encompass and-most importantly-when do
 they end?
 As one of four mayors serving on the
 President's Advisory Commission on Inter-
 governmental Relations and now nearing my
 fifth year of service in a metropolitan city?
 I find myself becoming increasingly aware of
 some municipal facts of life.
 My fellow members in the U.S. Conference
 of Mayors, I find, also are becoming more
 aware of these facts.
 NEEDED:  COURAGE
 Most of us have the revenue potential to
 enable us,to survive without massive federal
 aid.  Few of us have the political courage
 sincerely to use this potential.
 This revenue potential is available to us
 in the form of state or municipal personal
 income taxes.  It is almost the only local
 level tax which can grow with the economy.
 It can be a revenue source to supplant, in
 part, massive federal aid.
 The federal government-if it is sincere
 and honestly means what it seems to say
 about assisting urban areas to meet their
 problems-must provide a realistic tax break
 to enable these state and local governments
 to consider some form of personal income tax
 to finance programs.
 Such a cutback, or refund to persons in
 areas in which local governments are levying
 an income tax, would permit greater use of
 what is almost the only really untapped tax
 source left to the lower echelons of govern-
 ment.
 It also would permit local governments, in
 effect, to levy taxes for greater local use.
 And, conversely, It would permit greater tax-
 payer control over expenditure of tax dollars.
 Without a reduction in federal income tax
 rates to those taxpayers contributing to state
 and local income levies. the individual bur-
 den would be oppressive and grossly unfair.
 This is the only approach that recognizes
 the facts of political life.  The taxpayer, who
 feels that he has.little or no control over
 federal spending levels, is hardly to be blamed
 if he votes down a local bond issue or op-
 poses a local tax increase.                                                                                       Doing so he feels
 he can exercise direct influence on spending
 for public purposes.
 Now, with federal taxes levied for urban
 programs, it is hard for the local official con-
 fronted with real needs to resist pressure to
 ask for his "share."
 With creative administration, local gov-
 ernments can solve a good part of their prob-
 lems.  Proper zoning can, in many instances,
 ease the need for massive urban renewal pro-
 grams;  proper housing code enforcement,
 more often than not, can lessen the crises of
 slum clearance;  sensible  taxing  practices
 can permit a return of investment and risk
 capital to our central city core areas.
 In any event, we must not  -indeed, we
 cannot-increase the tax burden upon real
 estate or land.
 In most urban areas, and particularly in
 the heart of the city, land taxes must be re-
 duced.
 High land taxes In these older central city
 areas actually cause blight and decay, in
 many instances.  Because of a prohibitive
 tax structure, owners of older properties there
 are reluctant to keep up, or improve, existing
 buildings.
 This tends to encourage blight and decay-
 the very things most of us are seeking to
 halt, and usually are seeking Federal funds
 to help us halt it.
 A recent study by the Advisory Commis-
 sion on Intergovernmental Relations showed
 these changes and reductions are necessary
 because historically the federal government's
 intensive use of the personal income tax is
 the single most important deterrent to its
 expanded use by states and cities.
 Our research showed that between 1937
 and 1960 not a single state adopted a per-
 sonal income tax.  During this period 13
 states did adopt general sales taxes.
 A relative handful of the nation's cities
 are given a share of state income taxes for
 their needs.
 JOB  FOR  STATES
 In  addition,  however,  to making  addi-
 tional levies other than property taxes avail-
 able to local governments, the states must
 take revolutionary action to remedy the vast
 disparities of resources between individual
 jurisdictions in metropolitan areas. Among
 these possibilities are:
 Generous  state  financial  assistance to
 urban areas in such fields as sewage treat-
 ment,  improvement  of  schools  and                                                                                     mass
 transportation.
 Imposition or a special state income tax
 upon the residents of metropolitan areas and
 rebating the tax to the metropolitan areas on
 the basis of population or other formulas.
 Creation by the state of area-wide tax au-
 thorities to finance the most expensive urban
 services-including elementary and second-
 June 8, 1966
 ary education, vocational training? public
 health and law enforcement.
 Important as they are, finances are but one
 part of the fight to save our cities.
 Cities are more than a conglomeration of
 physical facilities feeding upon tax dollars.
 They are great, sprawling, teeming areas
 filled with an intellectual and cultural vital-
 ity which must live on.
 We recognize that urban needs and prob-
 lems do not stop at the city limits.  How-
 ever, our cities are deprived of the authority
 to offer services and seek revenues by these
 artificial geographic boundaries.
 They  create  a  broad  "no man's land"
 around the periphery of our cities.
 One  answer is annexation  of adjoining
 areas. It has some merits as a stopgap. More
 land area provides a broader base for real
 estate taxes, more geographay on which to
 base general obligation bond issues.  A. larger
 service area can mean a lower per capita cost
 for such things as sewage disposal, garbage,
 and trash pickups and water supply.   Un-
 checked annexation, of course, can create as
 many evils as it attempts to solve.  It can
 create  straggling  "strip  cities"   without
 enough revenue to provide services, or to
 keep pace with population growth.
 The 212 metropolitan areas in the nation
 in 1962 (the latest official figure) had 18,442
 local governments; 310 counties, 4,142 mu-
 nicipalities, 2,575 townships, 6,004 independ-
 ent school districts and 5,411 other special
 purpose districts.
 A way to end this duplication and over-
 lapping of function and tax sources could
 be the creation of "corporate cities" 'under
 a regional boards of directors.  These super-
 cities could have the authority to override
 archaic tax laws, the flexibility to expand and
 contract physical boundaries within the re-
 gion to match population movements and
 full recognition by other governmental units.
 They could absorb all of the functions of
 the governmental units within their bound-
 aries.
 In this way, each city and local govern-
 ment could retain its individuality, yet have
 a functioning unit through which it could
 try realistically to meet the needs of its citi-
 zens.
 The  1965  Utah  Legislature  approved  a
 somewhat similar concept. It provides for
 an amendment to the state constitution sub-
 ject to voter approval.
 If the amendment is approved by Utah
 voters this year, it will establish a procedure
 enabling a defined mctropolitan area to take
 over the powers and functions or existing
 governmental units within its outlined dis-
 trict.
 PARING COSTS
 In 1962 I conceived a plan setting up "re-
 gional substates" in an effort to provide au-
 thority and ability to meet growing urban
 problems and to remove the increasing du-
 plication of services and consequent taxation.
 Under my plan, Florida would have been
 districted into five regional areas of compa-
 rable population.  The regions would have
 been so geographically defined as to preserve
 the basic integrity of rural and urban areas.
 Each of my five substates would have an
 elective head, a cabinet and a legislature.
 This would permit each region the author-
 ity and local lawmaking ability to meet needs
 quickly as they arose.
 There are, of course, alternatives to this
 plan.
 Consolidation of services and authority
 within county rather than city limits is an
 attractive alternative.  This, in great part,
 can eliminate duplication of services, taxa-
 tion and governmental authority.
 Nashville-Davidson County in Tennessee
 and my own state's Dade County are em-
 barked  upon  a  comparable  endeavor  to
 streamline and make most efficient their gov-
 ernmental practices.  These two units are
 simply and basically reorganized county gov-
 ernments supporting urban area needs.

 THE  CONTINUING  UNFAVORABLE
 BALANCE OF     PAYMENTS-A
 GROWING DANGER
 Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr.  President,
 year after year since 1945, in order to
 strengthen the forces of freedom around
 the world, the United States has ex-
 pended an average of over $8 billion an-
 nually for foreign aid and military sup-
 port payments.
 In 1965, for example, our total Gov-
 ernment payments abroad were $8.5 bil-
 lion, including $4.3 billion in foreign
 economic aid and $2.8 billion in offshore
 military expenditures, plus $1.4 billion
 in service payments.
 A statistical tabulation was presented
 by General -Lemnitzer in testimony be-
 fore the House Committee on Foreign Af-
 fairs.  This testimony included a com-
 parison of U.S. defense expenditures in
 relation to the size of our economy with
 comparable  figures for  other NATO
 countries, for the period between 1947
 and 1963.' The testimony, once and for
 all, dispels any illusion that the United
 States is not carrying the major burden
 of defense for the free world.
 The figures of General Lemnitzer show
 that the United States spends annually
 for defense close to 10 percent of its
 gross national product; whereas France
 spends 6 percent, the United Kingdom
 about 5 percent, Germany and the Neth-
 erlands 4.5 percent, and Belgium and
 Italy 3.5 percent.
 In other words, U.S. defense expendi-
 tures abroad are more than twice as
 large, in relation to gross national prod-
 uct, as are the expenditures of most of
 our NATO allies.
 The United States has now become the
 world's major  debtor  nation,  owing
 abroad, primarily to the foreign central
 banks, over $29 billion in liquid liabil-
 ities; with its dwindling gold stock now
 standing at less than 113.6 billion.
 In addition, recently it has been re-
 ported that the United States had a
 balance of-payments deficit of 582 mil-
 lion in the first quarter of 1966. At an
 annual rate, this would make the year-
 end deficit $2.4 billion, far above last                                                     was going to say crisis.  It evidently is

 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, un-
 der the prior unanimous-consent agree-

 It was agreeable with him, and I was

 itary targets, or move out; and I so re-
 ported to the Senate.
 It was not possible to perceive the ad-
 vantage, net, of long drawn out mili-
 tary action in which our major effort was
 conducted where the enemy is strong-
 est-on the ground-instead of where
 we are supreme-sea and air.
 Later, upon return from Europe last
 April, this conclusion was reaffirmed, not
 only because of the great and growing
 cost, but also because of conviction this
 country is now over-committed as the
 result of our steadily increasing involve-
 ments, in men as well as money, over
 the past 20 years.
 Since April there have been new de-
 velopments, especially in South Vietnam,
 where there is now serious internal dis-
 sension between various elements, all of
 whom we are presuming are anti-Com-
 Znunist. And it is becoming steadily more
 difficult for me to understand how this
 Nation can successfully defend a people
 who are constantly fighting among them-
 selves.
 The problem is emphasized in the fol-
 lowing news report published earlier this
 week:
 Vietcong ambushers killed a detail of six
 U.S. Air Force men in an area where political
 turmoil has diverted South Vietnamese troops
 from normal campaigning against the Com-
 munists.  The Americans, members of a sur-
 vey team from a radar installation, were
 trapped in a truck 15 miles south of the
 border with the North.
 In any case, most discussions about
 Vietnam center on either diplomatic or
 military problems, with relatively little
 consideration of the great and growing
 economic problems this Vietnam involve-
 ment is now giving our Government.
 There was an interesting letter to the
 Washington Post on June 7, entitled
 "The Cost of Vietnam."  I ask unani-
 mous consent this letter be inserted at
 this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 COST OF VIETNAM
 Despite the millions of words in newsprint
 about the Vietnam war, very little has been
 written about its economic aspects.  Our
 avowed humanitarian aims are looked upon
 by many peoples of the world with suspicion
 or outright disbelief.  It is even doubtful if

 June 8, 1966             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                     12037
 adding at the end thereof the following new
 sentence: "Any veteran who is furnished
 care by the Administrator in a hospital in
 Alaska or Hawaii may be furnished nursing
 home care under the provisions of this sec-
 tion even if such hospital is not under the
 direct and exclusive jurisdiction of the Ad
 ministrs,tor. "
 The amendment was agreed to.
 Mr.   BARTLETT.  Mr.   President,
 once again the veterans of Alaska have
 cause to be grateful to the senior Sena-
 tor from Texas [Mr. YARBOROUGH], the
 chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs
 Subcommittee of the Labor and Public
 Welfare  Committee.  Because  of  his
 leadership and concern we are today
 considering my bill, S. 562, which has
 been favorably reported with amend-
 ments from his committee.
 I urge Senate adoption of this bill.
 The bill has two sections: The first,
 would provide for the restoration of hos-
 pitalization benefits which Alaska and
 Hawaii veterans enjoyed before state-
 hood.  It would give the Administrator
 of the Veterans' Administration the au-
 thority to contract with private hospi-
 tals for the care of veterans with non-
 service-connected  disability.  The  bill
 provides that this particular authority,
 which now extends to noncontiguous
 territories of the United States, would be
 extended once again to Alaska and Ha-
 waii.  This will expire in 10 years' time.
 At that time Congress could determine
 whether the services provided by this
 bill and which are now so badly needed
 are still warranted.
 The second purpose of this bill would
 be to permit veterans hospitalized under
 VA jurisdiction in Alaska and Hawaii
 the same opportunity to be transferred
 to nursing homes as veterans in other
 States now have.
 Under present law the VA is author-
 ized to transfer veterans needing ex-
 tended care to public or private nursing
 homes.  Such transfers reduce the costs
 for caring for the patients, insures him
 the care he needs before being returned
 to a normal life and provides an addi-
 tional hospital bed.   In the act author-
 izing these transfers it is specified that
 they may be made only from hospitals
 under the exclusive Jurisdiction of the
 Administrator.  This lets Alaska out.
 This lets Hawaii out.  There are no VA
 hospitals in Alaska or Hawaii.
 In Alaska, veterans with service-con-
 nected disability are treated at the Army
 hospital at Fort Wainwright, the Air
 Force hospital at JElmendorf Air Force
 Base, and various small hospitals run
 by the Department of Health, Educa-
 tion, and Welfare for the Alaska natives.
 These hospitals are obviously not under
 the direct jurisdiction of the VA and,
 thus inadvertently, Alaska veterans are
 unable to obtain nursing home treat-
 ment.  This is also true for veterans in
 Hawaii and the Philippines.  The bill
 before the Senate today would correct
 this oversight and would give to Alaska,
 Hawaii, and Philippine veterans the
 same standard of treatment as that ac-
 corded to veteran residents in the 48
 States.
 The VA contracts for a small number
 of beds in the federally owned Govern-
 ment hospitals of Alaska.  These beds
 are the only medical facilities provided
 for the more than 22,000 veterans living
 in Alaska.  These beds, I am told, are
 fully utilized.  The ' veteran who lives
 near one of these Government hospitals,
 and who, I might say, is fortunate enough
 to have a service-connected illness, will
 receive proper treatment.  If the illness
 is not service connected it is difficult for
 him to receive proper treatment.  Far
 more than half the beds in VA hospitals
 in the lower 48 States are occupied by
 veterans with non-service-connected ill-
 nesses.  Such men in Alaska, however,
 receive VA care only if there is a bed
 available in the leased space.
 Alaska is a vast land.  There are few
 roads and the principal means of trans-
 portation is by air.  This is expensive
 and, if illness is involved, sometimes
 dangerous.
 Before statehood the costs and the
 dangers were recognized by the Congress.
 It authorized the care of veterans in the
 closest available private hospital.  The
 costs of this care were paid by the VA.
 The justification for such a provision was
 explained by' Administrator Gleason in a
 letter to the senior Senator from Ala-
 bama [Mr. firta] dated March 12, 1963.
 Gleason explained why the VA supports
 giving such care to veterans living in the
 noncontiguous territories.  He said the
 distance from the mainland, the diffi-
 culty in transferring patients to the
 States, and the relatively small volume of
 patient demand made such provision ac-
 ceptable to the Administration.
 These conditions not only pertain to
 the territories, they also pertain to the
 two noncontiguous States, Alaska and
 Hawaii.
 On the basis of simple justice, I, there-
 fore, urge the Senate to give this measure
 its approval and I again would like to
 thank the senior Senator from Texas for
 his continued interest and concern for
 the welfare of Alaska veterans.  All
 Alaska veterans are appreciative of his
 efforts.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  The question is on the engross-
 ment and third reading of the bill.
 The bill was ordered to be engrossed
 for a third reading, was read the third
 time, and passed.
 The title was amended, so as to read:
 "A bill to amend title 38, United States
 Code, with respect to the definition of
 the term 'Veterans' Administration facil-
 ities,' and to eliminate certain require-
 ments for the furnishing of nursing home
 care in the case of veterans hospitalized
 by the Veterans' Administration in Alas-
 ka and Hawaii."
 Mr. BARTLETT.  Mr. President, in
 explanation of the bill, section 1 of the
 bill amends the definition of the term
 "Veterans'  Administration  facilities"
 contained in section 601(4) (C), title 38,
 of the United States Code, to include pri-
 vate contract facilities for a veteran of
 any war when such veteran is in a State
 not contiguous to the 48 contiguous
 States.
 Bills of similar Intent have been con-
 sidered in several earlier Congresses.
 The bill is identical in purpose to S. 625,
 which passed the Senate In the 88th Con-
 gress; to S. 801, which was reported from
 the Labor and Public Welfare Commit-
 tee in the 87th Congress; and to S. 2201,
 which passed the Senate during the 86th
 Congress.
 Under the present law, war veterans
 with non-service-connected disabilities
 are entitled to hospitalization in VA hos-
 pitals when they themselves are unable
 to pay the costs, and when space is avail-
 able in such hospitals. Further, they are
 entitled to hospitalization in private con-
 tract facilities, but only in a "Territory,
 Commonwealth, or possession of the
 United States."
 Alaska and Hawaii are the only States
 in which the Veterans' Administration
 maintains no hospitals, and the veterans
 in these States do not have the advan-
 tage of hospitalization in facilities de-
 voted entirely to the care of veterans.
 Before statehood, private contract fa-
 cilities were used in these areas to pro-
 vide hospital care to veterans with non-
 service-connected injuries. When Alaska
 and Hawaii became States, however, the
 Administrator of Veterans' Affairs lost
 the power to contract there for private
 hospital facilities, and it is to this prob-
 lem that section 1 of the present bill is
 addressed. In practical effect, this sec-
 tion of the bill merely restores the sit-
 uation which existed prior to the time
 Alaska and Hawaii achieved statehood,
 and they are the only States affected by
 this legislation.
 At the present time, hospital care for
 veterans with non-service-connected dis-
 abilities is provided in Alaska and Ha-
 waii through other Government hospi-
 tals.                                                                                         In Alaska, beds are allocated for
 veterans in hospitals of the Department
 of Defense and the Department of
 Health, Education, and Welfare. In Ha-
 waii, the Department of Defense has al-
 located beds in the Army's Tripler Gen-
 eral Hospital.  Under the appropriate
 conditions, veterans may go to these hos-
 pitals if beds are available.  But with
 the present increases in the demands on
 Department of Defense hospitals, it is
 possible that space will be less available
 than before.  Also, travel in the remote
 regions of Alaska and the outlying islands
 of Hawaii Is difficult, and there is a need
 to allow the veteran to be hospitalized in
 private hospitals near his home.
 Section 2 of the bill is identical to H.R.
 13187, the 89th Congress, as passed by
 the House of Representatives.
 When Public Law 88-450 was enacted
 authorizing among other things the fur-
 nishing of nursing care In Veterans' Ad-
 ministration operated nursing homes and
 in community nursing homes, there was
 no provision made for the furnishing of
 such nursing care in the States of Alaska
 and Hawaii.  One of the basic provisions
 of Public Law 88-450 is that in order for
 an individual to be placed in a privately
 operated or community nursing home for
 temporary care at VA expense the patient
 must first have been in a Veterans' Ad-
 ministration hospital and reached a

 the bulk of the? South Vietnam people are
 convinced, . , the notion of humanitarian mo-
 tive for an expensive war is entirely foreign
 to their habit of thought.  The acceptance
 of the idea depends on social consciousness,
 which on a national level hardly exists in
 most of Asia and has reached only rudimen-
 tary development in many other regions of
 the world.  If our avowed purposes are not
 accepted as the truth our actions breed dis-
 trust.
 In the. beginning, economic factors must
 have seemed insignificant.  The initial cost
 of ? our involvement was little more than the
 pay and allowances of a few thousand men.
 That undoubtedly seemed worth the ven-
 ture.  But we didn't win and from then on
 we reacted like the hapless gambler trying
 to recover his losses by increasing the stakes
 with the result that each successive stake
 became worse than the first.  Now that we
 have already expended $5 or $10 billion and
 have had three of four thousand fatal bat-
 tle and nonbattle casualties, we must ask
 ourselves, "Is the venture still worth it?"
 There has been no Pearl Harbor, our na-
 tional security is under no immediate threat,
 we have not committed ourselves to an all-
 out war and we have so far expended only a
 small part of the resources which an all-out
 war would call for,, Should we commit these
 resources?
 If, for example, the estimates (and these
 are conservative estimates) suggest that the
 war and occupation will last 10 years, that
 we will suffer 30,000 fatal casualties, and
 that the monetary cost will be in the order
 of $100 billion, Congress will be in a position
 to determine whether this is a reasonable
 price for making South Vietnam safe for
 some distant future democracy or whether
 we should spare the 30,000 men and begin
 searching for some less costly ways of con-
 taining communism.
 With a $100 billion purse this should be
 easy.
 H. SCIHULZE.
 NEW YORK CITY.
 Mr. SYMINGTON. I do not know the
 author, but do know he is right when
 he says his estimates of this tremendous
 cost could.well be conservative.  These
 costs are growing. 'To them must be
 added the billions apparently we plan to
 expend in effort to salvage our position
 in Europe.
 In the meantime our gold reserves con-
 tinue to dwindle, mostly to Europe; and
 current U.S. Government liabilities re-
 deemable in gold and owned abroad, pri-
 marily by the foreign central banks, con-
 tinue to increase.
 If our policies and programs continue
 to necessitate this heavy price, and our
 17-year unfavorable balance of pay-
 ments continues unfavorable, there must
 be a reckoning in the not too distant
 future.
 SECRETARY RUSK IS WRONG
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk should
 cease and desist his reprehensible and
 highly contemptible references to Com-
 munist China,  He invariably publicly
 displays his contempt for the Chinese
 and for-the leaders of mainland China.
 He publicly terms the capital of that
 nation "Peiping" instead of by its his-
 toric and proper name, "Peking."  A
 Secretary of State of the United States
 should be supposed to exercise some de-
 gree of tact and restraint in public state-
 ments. The contrary has been the rule.
 Under direction of Secretary of State
 Rusk, officials of the State Department,
 the U.S. Information Agency, and other
 Washington officials have been issued in-
 structions to refer to the capital of main-
 land China as "Peiping," the terminology
 that Chiang Kai-shek applied to it, and
 must, not refer to it as "Peking," the
 historic name and the name adhered to
 by Mao Tse-tung's Communist regime.
 The meaning of the word "Peking" is
 "northern capital." Peking was the rec-
 ognized capital of the Manchu dynasty
 and historically the capital of China.
 Even Secretary Rusk should know that
 the Chinese for thousands of years had
 a great history and noble tradition and
 that they have reason to be proud of
 their culture. Yet, due to technological
 superiority and weapons of war, Euro-
 pean nations throughout the 19th cen-
 tury conquered vast areas of the Chinese
 mainland.
 The English set an example of op-
 pressing Chinese nationals.  They and
 other Europeans came to regard Chinese
 as an inferior, low-grade people and
 over the years constantly humiliated
 them.  In fact, in the 1840's England
 fought a war of aggression against the
 Chinese because Chinese officials, to save
 the lives of their own people, tried to
 suppress the opium traffic which was ex-
 tremely lucrative to English merchants.
 To the shame of the British Empire, this
 war has been termed the "Opium War."
 It resulted in the seizure of the island
 of Hong Kong and other areas that had
 been Chinese for thousands of years.
 This lush territory, homeland of the
 Chinese, was taken either outright or
 under the guise of 99 year leases.
 Throughout the 19th and the early
 20th centuries, officials of European gov-
 ernments and even the United States
 frequently treated Chinese scholars and
 statesmen  with  contempt,  regarding
 then} as people to be exploited by the
 great powers such as Great Britain,
 France, Germany, and Russia.
 When liberty-loving Chinese rose in
 revolt in what was termed the "Boxer
 Rebellion," even our own Armed Forces
 joined with other powers to crush the
 rebellion.
 Shortly thereafter the Manchu dynasty
 was overthrown and a period of anarchy
 followed with various Chinese warlords
 fighting one another with their private
 armies.  The great powers took further
 advantage of this internal weakness and
 seized additional territory and privileges
 in China.
 In 192$ Chiang Kai-shek overcame
 other warlords, and to downgrade those
 he had beaten and to demonstrate his
 contempt, he moved the capital to Nan-
 king and changed the name "Peking" to
 "Peiping" which, translated, means pac-
 ified capital."
 Following the time the Communist
 forces chased Chiang Kai-shek from
 mainland China, they in 1949 reestab-
 lished the capital at Peking. From that
 date to the present time Peking has been
 the capital of Communist China.
 Nevertheless, on instructions from of-
 ficials of the State Department, many
 U.S. officials continue to use the term
 "Peiping."  This is an unnecessary ir-
 ritant to the people and rulers of Red
 China. Without a doubt this exercise of
 bad judgment, in fact stupidity, on the
 part of Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
 causes the Chinese leaders to be more
 inflexible in their intransigence.
 In 1814, in the course of our war with
 England, termed the "War of 1812," a
 small English army under General Ross
 with some marines and sailors under Ad-
 miral Cockburn routed American militia-
 men at Bladensburg and captured Wash-
 ington. These raiders burned the Presi-
 dent's house in retaliation for Americans
 burning the then capital of Canada,
 York, earlier in that war.  President
 Madison barely escaped capture. Imme-
 diately following the capture of Wash-
 ington and burning the President's house,
 the English withdrew.  This was in 1814.
 How would the people of the United
 States have liked it if a Prime Minister
 of England, around 1832, contemptuous-
 ly referred to Washington as "pacified
 capital" instead of referring to our capi-
 tal by its correct name, Washington?
 Secretary of State Dean Rusk would be
 well advised to discontinue the use of this
 insulting word, "Peiping," unless he is
 utterly lacking in sincerity in his claim
 that he is offering the olive branch of co-
 existence and peace.
 Claiming that our puppet Chiang Kai-
 shek, whose forces fleeing from the Chi-
 nese mainland slaughtered some 18,000
 unarmed citizens of Formosa, including
 women and children, in establishing his
 rule there and claiming that his govern-
 ment in Taiwan, the name he gave to
 Formosa, is the only legitimate Govern-
 ment of China, is fakery as statesmen of
 the world know.
 Our proper policy would be to continue
 the recognition of the government of
 Taiwan and then go ahead seeking a
 more flexible trade policy with China,
 continuing, of course, the ban on stra-
 tegic materials but permitting the export
 to Communist China of whatever the
 Chinese may wear, eat, drink, or smoke
 and, in return, buying the products and
 handicraft of the Chinese.
 We should offer diplomatic recognition
 to Communist China which has main-
 tained a government in mainland China
 for nearly 20 years. Were we to have an
 embassy in Peking with an Ambassador
 and staff we would have an open window
 and listening post in China. Because
 ours is an open society, China would
 have less to gain in opening an embassy
 in Washington.
 Mr. President, I shall continue to con-
 demn  and  denounce  State                                                                                    Secretary
 Rusk if and whenever he indulges in the
 use of the contemptible and insulting
 term "Peiping," aping the language of
 Chiang Kai-shek.
 PERMITTING THE PLANTING  OF
 ALTERNATE  CROPS  ON  ACRE-
 AGE WHICH IS UNPLANTED BE-

 ence report on H.R. 15151 is at the desk?
