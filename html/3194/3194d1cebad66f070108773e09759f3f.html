 LECTURE AND QUESTION PERIODS.   Lectures are allocated one hour and ten
 minutes.  Lecturers are requested to speak for not more than fifty
 minutes, allowing the rest of the period for questions and discussion.
 Seminar members should rise and identify themselves by name and agency
 when asking questions.
 DISCUSSION PERIODS.   Each country team chairman will ascertain in advance
 which of his team members wish to consult with scheduled speakers after
 their lectures.  If a substantial number of seminar members so indicate,
 an effort will be made to arrange for a discussion period with the
 lecturers.
 SEATING.  Seminar members will be seated in the auditorium by country
 teams.   Seat numbers will be indicated on Country Team Assignment sheets.
 ATTENDANCE.   Seminar members are expected to be on time for lectures and
 remain throughout the period.  A warning bell will be sounded three
 minutes before the lecture period begins.  Those who are unavoidably late
 may listen to the lecture in room 114 which is equipped with speakers.
 Country team chairmen will report on the attendance of members of
 their teams, both for lectures and other scheduled country team activi-
 ties.  The country team attendance sheet submitted by the team chairman
 is the basic "time and. attendance" record; it is used to support the
 certification of attendance for payroll purposes.
 A seminar member who finds it necessary to be absent from any
 scheduled activity must secure the written approval of his agency's
 faculty representative and the course coordinator.  Forms for requesting
 permission to be absent are available in the library.
 CLASSIFICATION.  All lectures will be privileged except for those given
 by non-governmental speakers which do not discuss United States policy
 and operations from classified sources.   All question and answer periods
 will be classified.  Classification of lectures given by United States
 officials will be posted to and including TOP SECRET.
 THE COUNTRY TEAM PROCESS.   Seminar members are divided into country teams
 throughout the course to enable them to concentrate on problems of the
 area to which they are assigned.   Afternoon sessions are generally
 reserved for the country team exercise.   Each team,  as it works on its
 problem, will find that it needs additional information or new inter-
 pretations of data.  The faculty adviser will assist the team to obtain
 briefings or opportunities for informal discussion with appropriate
 officers of any government agency or with resource personnel outside of
 government.  Such additional arrangements are at the option of each
 country team.
 READING ASSIGNMENTS AND BIBLIOGRAPHY.   The pages immediately following

 Problems of Development and Internal Defense
 Objectives
 To familiarize key civilian and military officers assigned to the
 developing countries, especially those where insurgency is active or in-
 cipient, with United States policy,  doctrine, and capabilities applicable
 to the prevention and defeat of inimical subversion and subversive in-
 surgency, through an examination of:
 Political, economic, social, and psychological factors which produce
 dissidence and insurgency inimical to United States interests; the nature
 of the external and internal threat; the broad strategic concepts involved
 in modernization and internal defense; the availability and use of United
 States resources in support of local governmental efforts to prevent or
 defeat subversive insurgency; the operational doctrine and techniques for
 the application and integration of these resources at the Country Team
 level on the basis of a common understanding of United States purpose and
 the limitations on United States capabilities.
 The participants will study the origins of insurgency as well as
 available techniques to defeat subversive insurgency; will learn as much
 as possible of the unique and indispensable contributions which all oper-
 ational arms of United States policy can bring to bear at the Country Team
