Abstract* 
1957 was a year of considerable experimentation and adjustment in 
Communist China, as the regime faced problems arising from collectivization, 
socialization, and ideological regimentation, the forced pace of industrial-
ization) and the aftermath of de-Stalinization and the Polish and Hungarian 
developments of 1956. Through Mao's "100 flowers" and "contradictions" 
formulas the regime attempted to institute a more flexible approach to 
problems of popular dissatisfaction, intellectual regidity, and party weak-
nesses, but reverted to more conventional authoritarianism wL5n the 
relaxation elicited excessive criticism of basic aspects of the regime's 
program. Consequently the latter part of 1957 was devoted to a weeding out 
of "rightists" from the government, party, and other sectors and to a 
heightened program of ideological indoctrination of the populace, although 
the CCP continued its "rectification" effort to eliminate failings in the 
party and government. 
In an attempt to streamline the gargantuan administrative and 
economic apparatus, Peiping at the end of the year began to transfer 
hundreds of thousands of cadres to lower echelons and to productive enter-
prises. In agriculture the regime, faced with considerable peasant 
opposition to the collective farms into which 97 percent of mainland China's 
peasants had been organized, attempted to find more effective methu63 of 
operating the collectives and of controlling the collectivized peaants and 
their product. In its economic program, adjustments were made to case 
inflationary pressures, relieve industrial shortages, and to improve state 
collections of agricultural products. Industrial and agricultural output 
in 1957, the last year of the first Five-Year plan, was about 133 percent 
and 15-20 percent, respectively, above 1952. 
In the field of international relations, the regime moved to recoup 
some of the losses it had suffered as a member of the bloc in 1956 as a 
result of the revelations concerning Stalin and the repression of the 
Hungarian rebellion. While retaining its initiative in making ideological 
formulations and maintaining its stature within the bloc, Peiping emphasized 
particularly its acceptance of Moscow as the leader of the bloc. Partici-
pating as the second-ranking bloc member after Moscow at the celebration of 
the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution, Peiping attempted to 
identify itself with Soviet gains during the year, and particularly with 
the Soviet launchings of two earth satellites. A notable feature of 
Communist China's rtlations with the non-Communist world was its sensitivity 
regarding the "two Chinas" concept, which it adamantly rejected as a US 
plot. 
The Chinese Communist regime appears to be facing the second 
Five-Year plan beginning in 1958 with considerable confidence in the 
economic field, although the maintenance of economic expansion will be more 
difficult and costly than in the first plan. However, through stringent 
economies and harsh limitations on consumption increases, the regime will

probably be able to maintain a rapid rate of economic growth, with national 
Income rising about six to sever percent annually. During this period the 
population problem will become increasingly significant with the population 
expected to rise from 64o million to 720 million. 
The regime will be faced with continuing and probably increasing 
dissidence among many sectors of the population, particularly peasants, 
intellectuals, and national minorities. Although the decrease in public 
support may hamper some of the programs, the regime's control apparatus 
will almost certainly be able to prevent any internal threat to its 
existence. 
The present character of the Sino-Soviet alliance will probably be 
maintained, with Peiping and Moscow bound by ties of mutual dependence and 
a common view of world history and of the East-West struggle. Barring 
Imforeseen shifts in bloc strategy or a major war, Peiping will probably 
continue its present tactics toward non-Communist Asia and attempt to 
exploit whatever non-Communist weaknesses may develop. Although these 
tactics may result in some increase in Peiping's influence and prestige, 
changes in its international position will be determined to a greater degree 
than in the past on the course of the conflict between the Communist and 
non-Communist worlds.

I. RECENT DEYELOPMENTS 
By early 1957, the air of acilfitience and certainty which seemed to 
characterize the Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 
September 1956 no longer prevailed.. This change can be partly explained 
by the fact that the Congress, the first in eleven years, could look 
back with justifiable satisfaction on the COP'S achievements after the 
Congress, it was necessary to face the future, with its uncertainties 
and. problems. More important, however, were certain &nestle and inter-
national developments which created additional problems or underlined 
old ones. Foremost among these developments were the domestic reper-
cussions of de-Stalinization and of the Hungarian and Polish affairs; a 
disappointing 1956 harvest and growing difficulties with a newly 
collectivized peasantry; increasing disillusionment, discontent and 
apathy; and the claimed 'basic completion of the socialist revolution," 
which necessitated reconciling policy with ideology. 
Accompanying this increase in problems was a more realistic 
recognition of the problems by the Chinese Communists. Thus in early 
1957 they were engaged in reappraising the situation in order to adapt 
their policies to meet the problems. 
Although specific developments prompted the CCP to undertake this 
reassessment, they were all manifestations of the fundamental problem 
inherent? in Chinese Communism: how to mobilize the country's human 
resources and utilize its material resources in support of the regime and 
its programs) particIllArly its economic policy of forced industrialization. 
UnWilling to make any basic change in this economic policy, the Chinese

Communists sought the solution by attempting to improve their utilization 
of material resources and their method of mobilizing the people. Domestic 
developments in Communist China largely reflected this attempt. 
During 1957, the Chinese Communists were largely successful in 
restoring the momentum of their economic program, but their attempts to 
devise new solutions to their political problems encountered unexpected 
obstaeles. Thus at the beginning of 1958, their economic activities were 
characterized by a renewed air of confidence; in the political field, Van 
regime having reverted:to previous methods, the atmosphere was more one 
of firmness of purpose than of satisfaction and assurance. 
A. Political and Social 
1. Maols "Contradictions" Formula. Available evidence strongly 
suggests that Mao Tse-tung himself, perhaps ignoring the apprehensions of 
some party leaders, devised the new formula for eliciting more positive 
support from the Chinese people. Mao presented the theoretical basis 
and the broad outlines of this formula in a speech to a Supreme State 
Conference audience of some 1,800 persons on February 27. The formula 
had two main Components. 
The first component was the thesis that contradictions 
me WM 
i?e?y 
problems and conflicts of interest -- continue to exist in a socialist 
society, partly owing to dialectic reasons and partly because of 
inexperience. These contradictions occur between-the-leaders-al:lathe 
people and within and between various groups, such as the workers, 
peasants, bourgeoisie, intellectuals and. minorities.

The second component of Mao's formula was a suggested method of 
handling these contradictions. He explained that there are two types of 
contradictions: antagonistic ones between the "people" and the "enemy," 
and non-antagonistic ones "within the ranks of-the people." Using the 
concept of the "people's democratic dictatorship," Mao stated that 
dictatorial methods should be applied only to the antagonistic contra-
dictions, while "democratic methods" should be used in handling contra-
dictions "among the people." Most of Communist China's problems were 
of this second category) Mao explained, and they should be resolved by 
'democratic methods, methods of discussion, of criticism, of persuasion 
and education, not coercive, high-handed methods." 
Mao's approach was a bold one with ambitious objectives. It 
avparently arose from his belief that it would be both feasible and 
desirable to rely less on repression and controls and more on voluntary 
popular support. The lessons of Poland and Hungary undoubtedly 
Influenced. his thinking) but domestic considerations were also important. 
The technique of repression, tight controls: and sudden spurts of 
"campaign" energy, previously effective in suppressing organized opposi-
1? 
tion and in establishing the institutional framework of a communist 
society, would be less productive in channeling the country's energies 
into the protracted. effort of economic development. By arguing that 
. ? - 
problems wereinevitable, even under communist, he apparently hoped to 
make the problems a common cause, thus .reducing the blate laid on the 
?, 
regime. And he intended to reinvigorate the' CCP by rationalizingthe 
problems, by creating abetter relationship between the party and the

people, by correcting the errors and fteknesses of party members, and 
by fostering a stronger sense of discipline and unity. 
2. The "Rightist" Issue. The full impact of Mho's speech was not 
immediate. In mid-April, however, it became apparent that the regime had 
decided to use the speech as a basis for a major campaign, and at the 
end of April the CCP launched a party rectification campaign, to be 
"guide ideologically" by Mho's thesis on contradictions.1 
This rectification campaign was described by the CCP directive 
as primarily an internal party matter with the objective of improving 
the party's "working style." However, the rectification technique 
emphasized the value of criticism as a means of identifying and solving 
contradictions, and in early May the CCP held a series of forums in 
which non,-Communists -- primarily intellectuals -- were encouraged to 
voice their frank views. These foruMs led the rectification movement 
into the tangential and unplanned "anti-rightist" phase which 
. _ 
constituted a fundamental change in the movement, and, it appears, in

activity. Reports that Mao specifically guaranteed that there would be 
no retaliation against those who voiced their views are partially 
slibstantiated and appear logical in view of the surprising frankness with 
which criticism were soon expressed. 
a. Criticisms expressed. Long frustrated. by enforced silences and 
apparently hoping that they could in fact influence the CCP, the 
intellectuals voiced criticisms which, in total effect, challenged the 
CCP's monopoly of leadership and some of its important policies. The 
following criticisms, all published in the mainland press, indicate the 
vehemence and range of subjects: 
Relations between the CCP and the people have deteriorated 
because the party believes that it should control "every-
thing under heaven." The demarcation between the govern-
ment and the CCP should be clearer. The National Peoplels 
Congress has no opportunity to discuss matters intelligently. 
A "political planning council," with large nom-CCP member-
ship and with broad authority, should. be established. CCP 
members adopt an arrogant attitude toward non-party persons. 
Minor political parties are slighted. CCP committees in 
educational institutions should be abolished. The CCP is 
not qualified to "lead science." Newspapers should print 
news; intellectuals should. be permitted to establish their 
own publications. A. high-level body should be formed to 
2..view the injustices which occurred in previous mass 
campaigns. Former businessmen no longer need extensive 
ideological remolding. The tempo of socialization should 
be slowed down. China should not bear the full cost of 
the Korean war, should obtain more lenient loan terms from 
the Soviet Union, and should receive compensation for the 
-eqpiPment which the Soviet Union removed from Manchuria in 
1545-46. 
b. Number of "rightists." It is not clear how many people voiced 
such criticisms. The Chinese Communists claimed that of the intellectuals 
and former busineasmen, only a small minority was involved. However, 54

People's Congress in January 1958, and an Incomplete count shows that 
about 500 persons have been attacked in the press. Whatever the 
number of persons who actively criticized the reginerthe criticisms 
represented the opinions of a still larger group of persons. CCP 
spokesmen stated that the large majority of the intellectuals and 
"bourgeoisie" have not yet accepted the "socialist road" and are "unwilling 
to accept the leadership of the party and the proletariat." The Chinese 
Communists have attempted to minimize the extent of opposition sentiment 
among the students, workers, and peasants, but official press reports 
suggest that a sizable wave of criticism of the regime swept through 
the schools, and that dissatisfaction, not necessarily related to the 
"rightist" issue, was widespread among the peasantry. Moreover, the 
vehemence of the regime's counterattack -- a move which necessitated a 
major chance in both the procedure and the tenor of the rectification 
campaign -- strongly suggests that the CCP was shocked by the prevalence 
of these views and concerned by the probability that the views would 
find a large receptive audience. 
The persons charged as "rightists" ranged from some of the 
country's most pronlrent non-Communists -- several government ministers, 
university presidents, newspaper editors -- to obscure individuals. 
Almost all areas of intellectual activity were affected; the CCP secretary 
general, for example, listed "industrialists and businessmen, democratic

parties, educational circles, journalistic and publication circles, 
cultural,and art circles, scientific and technological circles, health 
circles, many personnel of state agencies, college students, and so 
forth." In addition, "rightists" were found in the government, the 
army, the party itself, the Communist Youth League, in legal fields, 
and among the national minorities. Of the various groups, the minor 
"democratic parties," especially the China Democratic League, were 
charged with harboring the largest number of "rightists" in responsible 
positions. 
c. "Rightists" accused of organizing. How much organization 
or liaison there was among these "rightists" is not clear. Two of the 
leading "rightists" -- Chang Po-chun and Lo Lung-chi, government 
ministers and deputy chairman of the China Democratic League -- were 
accused of having formed a "conspiracy" with widespread contacts. It 
wassaid?that the "rightists" had a "platform, organization, and plan." 
The Minister of Public Security stated that counterrevolutionaries, 
"influenced by the frantic rightists," established organizations, 
carried out armed revolt, and engaged in propaganda activities. It is 
probable that the COP deliberately exaggerated the degree of organiza-
tion, and it seems doubtful that most of the "rightists" were 
organizationally united. However, there was undoubtedly some liaison 
withili-certain groups., Some of the 'persons accused as "rightists" 
may been seeking.an?opportunity,to exercise an ameliorating

these_ persons probably moved into action along the lines suggested by 
the Communist charges, attempting to "light fires" in non-Communist 
intellectual circles throughout mainland China. However, their objectives 
were probably not as ambitious as the regime charged, since it is 
improbable that they expected to usurp leadership of the country. 
d. Countattacragainst"ritists." The regime launched 
its counterattack -- the "anti-rightist struggle" -- in early June. 
Its technique was to make charges against the "rightists" in general, 
leaving to various other groups, such as the minor parties and 
professional bodies, the task of identifying the Iniividual culprits 
and specifying the charges. A. revised yersion of Mao's February speech 
was released) now incliiling criteria by which proper and-improper 
criticism should be judged. The principal criteria were acceptance 
of CCP leadership and support of socialism) and the broad accusations 
leveled against the "rightists" were that they were challenging the 
right of the CCP to lead the country and. were attempting to restore 
the "bourgeois economic and political system." 
Many of the prominent "rightists" publicly recanted; most 
initial confessions were rejected as superficial and unsatisfactory, 
and the "anti-rightist struggle" continued with heightened intensity 
and broadened. 'scope. The regime laid the groundwork for severe' 
punishment by using such phrases -as "criminal activity," "the enemy," 
and "the same category as counterrevolutionaries." Of long-term 
significance was the modification of Mao's discussion of contradictions, 
to.emphaiize that there will be recurrent struggles 'between the enemy

and. people" for some years, even though those who resolutely oppose 
socialism are small in number. 
..Some "rightists" were expelled from their positions in government 
(including three ministers) and other organizations, in the CCP and the 
minor parties, and in the people's congresses at both national and 
lower levels,, but none has been arrested as of mid-January 1958. It 
is possible that a few will eventually be charged with counterrevolutionary 
activity, but apparently the CCP hopes to avoid a reversion to widespread 
use of terror and physical punishment'. 
e. ,I.deological indoctrination stepped up. Perturbed by the 
signs of a more widespread dislike of communism than previously estimated, 
and hoping to derive some more positive benefit from the "anti-rightist!' 
campaign, the CCP broadened its original plans and launched a nationwide 
rectification movement. Of even broader scope, although somewhat ' 
different in form, .was the massive "socialist education" campaign 
conducted among workers and. peasants with the stated purpose of heighten-
ing their belief in the superiority of socialism and inculcating a 
proper understanding of the relation between individual interests and 
those of the state. For students, courses for ideological indoctrination 
have been heavily emphasized. Meanwhile, toward the end of the year the 
COP returned to its 'original program of party rectification, and thus all 
significant grtupe in the country were engaged in varying degrees in 
ideological indoctrination,

3. Party and Government.' The rectification campaign produced most 
of the significant developments concerning the party and government during 
1957. 
Rectification is a unique CCP device of inducing, or if necessary 
enforcing, party "purity;" its major objectives are to create conformity, 
tighten discipline, correct failings, and reinvigorate the party. The 
CCP directive emphasized that harsh techniques were to be avoided; the 
process was to be one of persuasion and education. A central feature was 
"criticism and self-criticism" as a method of identifying and correcting 
"contradictions", or errors in party work. 
It is natural that in the context of the rectification campaign, 
the more significant party and governmental developments during this period 
would highlight problems and wealmesses. However, there was little reason 
to believe that the party faced a critical internal crisis. The basic 
elements of its strength remained: a determined leadership,, a large 
membership organized to act as an instrument of control and policy imple-
mentation, and an intention and ability to enforce a high degree of 
discipline and conformity. 
a. Policy disagreements. At the beginning of 1957 it was 
apparent that some doctrinaire elements in the CCP were 'questioningthe 
fibloomirw and contending" policy which ha() had advanced in 1956. His 
strong reaffirmation of this policy in 'his February speech was undoubtedly 
intehded to silence these doubts, but there are indications that.Maols 
licontradictions" formula was in turn opposed by many party members, 
probably including some in the Politburo. Mao seems to have originated

-the new approach, rather than merely using his authority to settle a 
debate, and it is not known how many party leaders genuinely favored 
Mao's formulations. It is possible that Liu Shao-chi and P'eng Chen 
argued against the policy; "rightists" were accused of making such_allega-
ticns, and Liu took little publicized part in the initial phase of the 
movement. However, the subsequent modification of Mao's original policy, 
marked by the counterattack against the regime's critics, presumably 
provided considerable justification, to those who had questioned the policy, 
and it is doubtful that either those who supported hao or those who dis-
agreed with him have fallen into disfavor. Nevertheless, the debate may 
have at least temporarily sharpened divergent viewpoints within the party, 
and Mao's prestige as the infallible leader may have suffered slightly. 
This probable disagreement among the leaders was reflected at lower 
party levels. Some members were labelled "rightist" for expressing views 
comparable to those of the non-party critics, while others, fewer in 
number, were called "leftist" for questioning the fundamental concepts of 
the "contradictions" 'doctrine and the rectification movement. 
b. e?nsion In September 1957, the CCP 
claimed a membership of 12.7 million. Of these, 8.2 million had joined 
-the party after it achieved control of the country in 1949, of which 
about two million were recruited since June 1956. During the rectifi-
cation campaign, the CCP stated that many of the now moMbcra came from 
- 
a non-proletarian background, were-insufficiently grounded in communist 
theory,?ladke4,revolutionary,experience and fervor, and had been "steeled 
through labor."

c. Other party weaknesses. Explicit in the rectification 
campaign and in many party statements was a concern that party members . 
did not have the proper close contact with the people. Thus one of the 
main objectives of the campaign was to 'combat the admitted growth of' 
bureaucratism, which was stated to have led to the use of undesirable 
methoda of administrative control or oppression in dealing with the people. 
The campaign was also intended to overcome sectarian tendencies (described 
as adopting a narrow, compartmentalized approach to questions) and sub-
jectivism (a catch-all deviation arising from a failure to understand the 
reality of any situation). In addition, party members with an intellectual 
background were told to overcome vestiges of bourgeois thought and tenden-
cies towards liberalism and individualism. Occasionally alluded to during 
the rectification campaign, and even more evident in early 1957, were the 
doubts and confusion which were aroused by the Polish and Hungarian affairs 
and not fully allayed by the party's official explanations. 
d. Possible party purge. Although the policy of reeducating 
errant members was constantly stressed, and although the CCP will want to 
avoid a Stalin-type purge, at the beginning of 1958 there was increasing 
evidence that a significant number of party members might be expelled. 
A number of' provincial party officials, including the governor of Chekiang 
and a number of deputies to the National People's Congress, were dismissed 
from the party for "rightist" activities; more party members, including 
officials of the judicial organs and the party's newspapers, have been 
attacked as "rightists." In a review of the rectification campaign at a 
Central Committee meeting in September 1957, the party's secretary general

problems and adopted a "vacillating political stand," that-Prightists"

expulsion). So far no persons of Central Committee' level have been charged 
. with rightism, although one member was dropped for dereliction of duty. 
The rectification campaign itself, as distinct from-the "anti- - 
rightist struggle," had led a few if any expulsions, but' it is possible 
- that the leaders will use this opportunity for weeding ba-members of 
dubious reliability or ability. 
The delay in convening the second session of 4he*8th Party Congress, 
? 
previously scheduled for December, may be due to an ini4ation to utilize 
the Congress to summarize and terminate the "purge".aepeCt'of the rectifi-
cation campaign. 
e. Shift of cadres. An important change in the cadre assignments 
occurred during the period, again largely as a result of the rectification 
campaign. By the beginning of 1958, about a million cadres, perhaps half 
???.,r 
of whom were party members, had been transferred to lower'llevels; partic-
f' '1d1 
ularly to rural areas; large numbers were assigne o agrI1:11 tairal cooper-

Seldom mentioned in the past -- received considerable attentiOn?.-torWards

its assignment policies; 
? , 
instead, it called on cadres to demonstrate a more cooperative spirit and 
to emphasize their common devotion to communism. 
g. Rural cadres. The problem of ensuring efficiency of action 
and Orthodoxy of thought among rural cadres is not a new one. Chinese 
Communist statements during 1957 reflected the CCP's continuing concern, 
which was probably heightened by its more realistic appreciation of the 
difficulties of obtaining peasant support and of running the collectives 
smoothly. Some cadres were said to have identified themselves more closely 
? 
with the peasants' interests than with the state's demands on the question 
?!'T f 
of grain Collection. In more general terms, they were criticized for 
hiving "bourgeois" tendencies and for having failed to realize that the 
class struggle, particularly on the political and ideological level, 
-still continues in the countryside. To correct these weaknesses, the 
- 
Tarty stated that the "socialist education.!' movement was directed at the 
cadres as well as the peasants. The large-scale transfer of cadres to 
'I ? 
the rural areas undoubtedly had as one objective the expansion of the 
rural cadre system and, 'increasing the number of cadres of urban origin,

need for streamlining their swollen bureaucracy and promoting a greater 
measure of local initiative. The problem of readjusting central-local 
relationships was one of the major topics discussed during the 8th Party 
Congress held in September 1956. In November 1957, after almost a year 
of preparation, the central government issued a series of new regulations 
providing for a gradual, limited and still experimental decentralization 
of some industrial, commercial, and fiscal controls.1. This decentral-

4. Dissidence and Resistance. The Chinese Communist regime has been 
confronted with an increasing volume of popn1A+. dissidenCe and discontent 
among several sectors of the population, including the peasantry, students 
and intellectuals, and certain ethnic minority groups. This rising level 
-r 
of popular unrest appears to reflect a disillusionment arising from unful-
filled promises, as well as the stresses and strains involved in the regime/s 
accelerated program of collectivization and industri.ilization. Continued 
efforts by the regime to impose stringent political'and-social controls 
and to modify deeply ingrained social customs have also been contributing 
factors. 
Popular unrest on the China mainland has not been translated into 
well-organized and active resistance capable of threatening the stability 
of the regime. Active resistance activities have been localized, sporadic, 
and confined to small groups lacking effective leadership and organization. 
For the most part, popular dissidence has been expressed in passive 
resistance, apathetic resignation, or refusal to accept the doctrines 
disseminated by the regime. Nevertheless, dissidence constitutes an 
important obstacle to the successful implementation of the regime's 
political, economic, and social programs. 
a. 'Counterrevolutionary" moves. From the middle of 1955 to 
the fall of 1957, the regime carried out another nationwide drive against 
counterrevoluO.onaries" comparable in scope and intensity to an earlier 
? .

drive launched in 1951. ,During this movement, overaP0,600"counter,-

mass organizations, and state enterprises. About 5,000 of these were 
? .; ? 
uncovered within the CCP itself and 3,000 in the Communist'YouthIeague. 
According to official reports, some of these had "reached the innermost 
organs and had usurped impoitant functions of the party and the. state." 
In addition, more than 3,000 "reactionary cliques" were broken up, and 
"various sblemes within the government smashed." 
The part of the counterrevolutionary campaign aimed at the general 
population resulted in many arrests and reportedly in the surrender of 
some 370,000 "counterrevolutionaries" and criminals. Most of the specific 
cases of "counterrevolutionary" activity reported in the Communist press 
during 1957 have involved small-scale and localized instances of alleged 
sabotage, espionage, or assassination of CoMmunist officials. There have 
been no reports of large-scale armed uprisings comparable to the Tibetan 
revolt of 1956. 
While continuing their usual efforts to suppress counterrevolu-
tionaries, the Chinese Communists attempted to devise more subtle 
methods of detecting and minimizing popular dissidence -- the "contradictins" and "rectification!' movements mentioned above. However, the 
intensity and volume of the criticism revealed a residue of popular 
resentment and discontent which apparently alarmed the CCP leaders and 
prompted them to revert to more stringent control measures.

from-the "rectification" Campaign: and drive against "rightists" is the

December, party and government conferences were called in several of 
the "autonomous" areas inhabited by minority peoples, including the 
Chuang areas of Kwangsi, the Miao and rung areas of Kweichow, and 
the Ili region of Sinkiang. The dominant theme at these conferences was

minority groups had been agitating for the withdrawal of Han Chinese

of Chinese. In Inner Mongolia; he-C ommmnist press%reported that 
, 
"rightist" elements-among-minority group's were tziini to promote a 
"secessionist" movement. 
DeS.pite indications of mounting discontent among ethnic minority 
groups, Peiping has not abandoned 1t'6 policy of granting nominal 
"autonomy" to minority groups while at the same time tightening its 
administrative conti-ols over them. The regime announced plans to es-
tablish two new larger "autonomous regions" having an administrative 
status equiValent to provinces. One of these, the Kwangsi Chuang 
Autonomous Region, will include more than six million Chuang peoples, 
the largest single ethnic group on the Chinese mainland. The other, 
the Ninghsia- Hui Autonomous Region, established in the northeasteim 
part of Kansu. province, will have a population of about 1.6 million; 
one third of which will consist of Hui -. a loosely defined group Who 
. - 
are largely Muslim in religion, although Chinese in speech. In both

of these new "autonotous areas" the ethnic minorities will be outnumbered 
by Han Chinese, thus facilitating a further tightening of Minese control.

S. ?Education.and Trained Personnel. .During 1957, Communist China 
continued to emphasize the role of education and technical training in 
realizing the long-run objective of developing an industrialized economy. 
Although the reduce d,rate of industrial growth,resplted in a slight 
decrease in the total 1957 national budget when compared mith the previous 
year, the portion allocated for education expenditures increased in both 
absolute and percentage terms from approximately 8.8 percent in 1956, to 
10.2 percent. 1957. 
PeipirWs,rgeneral review of its programs was reflected in its, 
reassessment of educational capabilities. This resulted in a sharp 
reduct4on,in new,admissions, particularly in universities and colleges, 
although total enrollment continued to grow. Moreover, evidence ..of 
stuctiunrest and the political unreliability of leading intellectuals 
reveled during the rectification campaign caused the initiation of 
measures designed to reestablish student discipline and cloctrin4.orthodoxy 
as, well as reinforce the dominanance of CCP influence in educational circles. 
a. School ,enrollment 1957-1958. The Chinese Communists state 
that about 65 million children were attending primary schools in 1957-58, 
representing about 80 percent of the total number of primary school-age 
children and an approximate 5 percent increase over those enrolled the 
previous year. Available data suggest that total enrollment in middle 
schools in 1957-58 was about 5,100,000, a drop of several hundred thousand 
from the 1956-57 school year. With respect to secondary vocational training, 
total enrollment in 1957-58 was about the same number (530,000) as in the 
previous year; however, unlike 1956-57, more attended the secondary normal

of 'newly enrolled students dropped substantially from 18000o in 1956 
to 107,000 in 1957. 
_ b. Educational problems. Peiping stated iri early 1957 that fewer 
primary and middle school graduates would be permitted to advance to 
higher schools, and called for those students unable toa.dvance to turn 
to manual labor, particularly in rural areas, owing to the limited rise in 
urban employment in 1957. The government recognized that in some specialized 
fields at the university level, incorrect pedagogical methods, aggravated 
by poorly qualified teachere and inadequate equipment, resulted in poorly 
qualified graduates, Consequently, courses of training were increased 
, 
from four to five years. 'Furthermore, the regime announced that limited 
financial and material resources made it impossible to provide adequate 
school building facilities for the increased number of students who 
wanted to 'enter middle school's and higher educational institutions. In 
addition to these admissions of inadeqUacy, Peiping also found it 
necessary to reemphasize'that university and college graduates would have 
to agree to work assignments made'by the State. ?

Leaders and some school officialsAmplicated in a middle school,riot in ? 
quhan were executed. In July, Peipinbpublished regulations requiring all 
university and college students to prepare anew complete biographies as a 
means of evaluating their political reliability. Further political control 
measures stipulated that if a graduate adamantly refused tbe work aseign-
ment given, the State would not provide alternative employment and be 
would be placed under security surveillance. Students suspected of "anti 
-
socialist" leanings would be allowed to graduate, but would be placed on 
probation far,qne.to three. years and would receive no salary other than a 
living allowance. Although the number of graduates affected,by these 
administrative measures will probably be limited, they do serve as sharp 
reminders to the rest that the regime intends to exercise strict control. 
One of the principal criticisms made by the "rightists" was directed 
at the CCP committees attached to higher educational institutions. It 
called for the abolition of these committees on the grounds that the CCP 
members on these committees were inc45etept and that they subordinated 
intellectual inquiry to political requirements. T.1e regime reacted:by 
strengthening its controls in the schools. Recent,wholesale transfers of

government officials to local administratiye,posts,throughout,,the,country , 
included the assignment of large numbers of,political,officials to executive 
positions in many colleges and universities. In addition, Peiping decreed

These quotas have probably been largely fulfilled, .but many of the spidents 
have admittedly been inadequately prepared for their courses. Recent 
decisions have included a greater emphasis on the sending of graduate 
students because undergraduates have shown themselves unable to benefit 
fully from :their study abroad. 
Commmnist China continued its campaign during 1957 to lure pro-
fessionally trained overseas Chinese through attractive job offers and 
the appeals of dependents and relatives. Very few of this caliber have 
actually returned, although the recent efforts_of Chinese Communist 
diplomatic-representatives to contact the two Chinese-American Nobel prize 
winners is an example of their persistence in this directionA, . 
6. Socialization. While primarily concerned with rationalizing and 
consolidating the newly socialist organization, the regime continued its 
drive to complete the socialization of the economy during 1957. At the 
end of 1956, 96 percent of peasant households ihad been organized, with 
88 percent in collectives and 8 percent.. in "lower level" cooperatives. By 
the end of 1957, individual peasant housebold had .been reduced to 3 percent,", 
and most of these with the exception of Tibet and,othertexempted areas had 
been placed under the "guidance" of the nearest collective. Virtually all 
"lower level" cooperatives had beep.reised to full collectives.. Although a 
considerable number of collectiyes,reportedly:were "dilsolved" in early 
1957, this apparently r.epresented spontaneous action by..angry peasants 
and was tolerated only_4ntil rural cadre,forces.pould,be,strengthened.

The principle of "voluntariness" was mainteine,d in th.eory, .but in practice it

became virtually impossible for the peasant to escape collective- control.

a. AdjUstient to problems. During 1957 the regime showed condern 
over the inefficient operation of the collectives, the rise in peasant 
discontent, and the decline in the morale of rural cadres. The trend 
of 1955-56 toward ever larger collectives was reversed. The ideal Size 
was placed at about 100 households, half the 1956 size, preferably to 
contain only one natural village, in order to simplify management and to 
reduce hostility within the collective between antagonistic groups. Cadres 
were directed to participate in manual labor in a concerted effort to 
reduce administrative overhead. In their analysis of peasant discontent, 
the regime noted that 15 percent of the households had been discriminated 
against in collective operation -- those with many dependents and those 
with high or special skills -- and were strongly opposed to collectives. 
These were largely the better farmers and the community leaders. Although 
the regime claimed that 70 percent of the households were "basically 
staunch supporters" of the collective system, even these had 'grievance's 
and were "wavering," with an additional 60 to 80 percent of peasant 
households complaining of foodshortages. 
In mid-1957 the regime launehed a campaign of "socialist education" 
employing standard technidites of indoctrination and intimidation to oppose 
"capitalist" tendencies in the collectives. Succeeding the landlords and 
rich peasants; the upper-middle peasants are now to be "struggled" against,

B. Economic Developments 
1. General. Economic policy in 1957 was aimed at restoring stability 
and balance to the economy after the over-exertions of 1956, while attempt-
, 
ing to maintain much of the momentum of the 1956'program. The regime had 
made substantial achievements in 1956, increasing industrial output by 31 
percent and state capital construction by 62 percent, collectivizing agri-
culture, and mobilizing the peasants on a grand scale for land improve-
ments and the introduction of new, more intensive cropping practices. But 
by- the end of the year an unbalanced budget and liberal credit policies 
had developed strong inflationary pressures, and unbalanced production 
with attendant goods shortages was affecting industrial output and con-
struction and tying up resources in inventories. The urban population, 
up 7.6 percent was growing restive over shortages of housing and other 
facilities, foodstuffs, and other commodities. Rural resentmeht had 
flared up and hardened against the regimels program, as the peasants 
chafed under the new collective institutions, became embittered over 
apparent inequities and inefficiencies of their operation, and became 
sceptical and disillusioned as many of the technical innovations turned 
out to be failures. 
A policy of "readjustment" in 1957 was therefore indicated, and 
- 
the year opened on a note of uncertainty as the regime sought to determine 
the extent of necessary concessions and compromises. The budget called 
7.: 
fora 2.3 percent increase in revenues and a 5.7 percent cut in expendi-
, 
tures, including a 20 percent reduction in capital construction, in order 
, ?

to-achieve a fiscal surplus. At the same time, the rise in the annual

'output by 6 percent. Industrial output, Which increased only 6.9 percent 
in 1957 as a result of raw material shortages and market dislocations, is 
scheduled to rise by 14.6 percent in 1958, while capital'construction is 
to rise by 17.8 percent, exceeding the high level set in 1956. 
In contrast to the rosy optimism of the expansion effort of 1956, 
-however, the regime in 1958 promises only "hard work and thrift" and 
tightening controls. The 1958 economic plan credits the proposed expan-
sion to the new acceptance of socialism, following the intimidation and 
-indoctrination of the rectification and "anti-rightist campaigns," and to 
administrative streamlining, which has removed wavering elements from 
positions of influence and has placed dedicated Communists in command of 
the shaky collectives and local governments. A ruthless retrenchment is 
under way among the favored groups of the bureaucracy, the students, and 
urban labor, with a new insistence on doctrinal loyalty and on the silent 
acceptance of sacrifice. It remains to be seen What'respOnse the economy 
will make to this increased reliance on the whip. 
2. Finance. At the beginning of 1957 the regime was particularly 
concerned over bringing under control the inflationary pressures loosed

of Ic 1 billion (US$ .4 billion) in market purdhases by enterprises and

by price increases.

its fiscal position was strong enough to make supplemental appropriations 
of Y 1.34 billion (UVI'ii .5 billion), largely to restore postponed capital

Urban personal cash incomeappears-,to have,-been at planried levels, whilq:. 
rural personal cash income exceeded the target as a result of expanded 
crop purchases. However, a contraction of rural. credit and an expansion, 
of urban and rural savings held back the rise in "social purchasing 
power." 
For 1958 the regime estimates the market supply of commodities at 
*.50- billion (US$ 20.3 billion) and "social purchasing power" at.; 49.4 
billion (US$ 20.1 billion). Urban wages are to rise by Y. .55 billion 
(uS.2211. million), resulting in an increase of .5 billion (US$ ,203 
million) in the purchasing power ,of the urban population. A loosening, 
of rural credit and increased crop, purchases is scheduled, to expand rural 
purchasing power by 1r 2.2 billion. (US$ .9 billion) 3 while enforced economy 
measures are to reduce institutional-purchasing power by- Y .3 billion 
(US$ .1 billion). Despite the-rise in the market supply?of commodities, 
the supply of the two main staples, grain and cotton cloth; remains 
restricted. Total grain' sales will be reduced by limiting the, supply to 
rural ,areas in ,order ,to build up stocks, while the per capita supply of

billion), the highest level in recent years, to provide a balanced 
budget. 
Outsidd of the budget, state stocks were increased by 15 billion 
(US$2.0 billion) in 1957, owing in large part to the heavy crop pur-
chases at the end of the year, necessitating increased credit to state 
industry and commerce of g4 billion (US$1.6 billion) over plan. Support 
frori the fiscal surplus was about gl billion (US$.4 billion) over plan, 
while agricultural credit was reduced 1.6 billion (US$.2 billion) below 
the target, and urban and rural savings deposits exceeded expectations. 
Nevertheless, this left a deficit of about g2 billion (US$.8 billion), 
which the regime has been able to immobilize temporarily by paying the 
collectives by check for their surplus crops and controlling the disburse-
ment of these credit balances. 
The regime is faced in 1958 with the problem of managing these 
credit balances while carrying out its plan to increase industrial and 
commercial loans by g2 billion (US$ .8 billion) and agricultural loans by 
g.4 billion (US.2 billion). An allocation of Y.8 billion (US.3 billion) 
to bank reserve funds is carried in the budget, and past fiscal experience 
suggests that this item will in practice be considerably larger. Private

' 
under-employed peasant labor to carry out land improvements and to introduce 
. . , 
more intensive cropping practices. the program was rigorously carried out, 
and_in the winter of 1955-56 irrigation facilitiee were provided or 
improved on one-tenth of the cultivated land. While cultivated land 
increased by 1.5 percent, the expansion of multiple cropping raised the 
crop area by 5.4 percent to 159 million hectare. The high-yield crops of 
rice, corn, and potatOes were promoted, with rice acreage rising by 15 
percent and potato acreage by 10 percent. As a result of these develop-
ments, the regime claimed that food output, despite serious floois, 
, 
typhoons, and drought, rose 4.4 percent over the bumper 1955 crops. 
However, this "crash!' program with limited technical direction 
resulted in many blunders. A large portion of the new irrigation facili-
ties was poorly designed or constructed, resulting in inadequate irrigation. 
For example, 40 percent Of the wells lire inadequate, and the usefulness of 
the remainder was limited by failure to prepare the land and by lack of 
equipment for lifting and distributing the water. In many localities the

plog.s for the peasants was halted in mid-year with an unsold inventory of 
, _ 
850,000, as the featured .2-wheel, double share plow proved too unwieldy 
for small plots and in hilly areas, too large to be operated in heavy 
soils or by the light and weak Chinese draft animals, and too difficult to 
maintain in repair. Moreover, the pre-emption of peasant labor adversely 
affected livestock production and other subsidiary output normally con-
ducted-in the off-season. 
As a result of these mistakes and the reaction to them, the program 
was temporarily slowed. Much less development work was accomplished in 
? 
the winter ofj956-57, the regime having called earlier for a limit to the

'marketing experience showed; was seriously biased upward.' ...Sharp downward' 
revisions in the estimate's were made in:early:195/, but the 'final,estimates' 
may still overstate the crop. The state' grain levy (tax and purchase) was ? 
reduced by nearly' 1,000,000 tons husked grain, with concessions to eight 
calamity-hit provinces only partially offset by increased levies elsewhere. 
In these eight provindes the state, through reduced levies and increatied 
sales; provided: an increase Of 5,000,000 'tone Over the previous year, 
allegedly matching the decline in production. The regime claimed that in 
the-remaining provinces the net grain supply rose by 15 Million tons husked 
grain, involving a per capita increase of 42'kilograms'or nearly 20 percent 
in food supplies. However, the regime admits that 668o percent of the '

5. .Foreign Trade Ara the Balance of Payments. In the face of 
disappointing harvests in 1957, Peiping for the first year since it came 
to power -was forced to cut its exports, and placed its 1957 export plan 
at Y5,200 million :(US$2,114 million) or 6.6 percent less than in 1956. 
(See Appendix, Table 6.) This reduction reflected sharp.cuts in scheduled 
exports of vegetable oils, grain, and pork-commodities in short supply on 
thea domestic market. An increase in Peiping's foreign-aid program and 
service on foreign debt and a decrease in. Soviet loans, totalling in all a 
reduction of Y200 million (US$81 million) in foreign exchange, contributed 
to an .even greater decline in scheAuled imports which were placed at 
Y41755 raillion1'(US$1)933 million) or 10.2 percent below 1956 levels. In 
1956 Peiping.Admited.itjiad not.4q.et its export commitments, presumably 
to the USSR,: and in -early 1957 an agreement with the -USSR was announced, 
providing:forpostponing-Of.pertaint-eport commitments u/iktil 1958.

Although the Chinese' Corn unit 'recently stated that total trade in 
1957 slightly exceeded their 15fan, they gave na indiCation about the 
relative amounts accounted for by -exports aid imports. An earlier 
announcement regarding trade through October indicated that imports were 
running about three percent above the 1957 plan and exports lagging about 
three percent below plan. This lag in exports behind imports would reduce 
the trade balance by. Y320 million (US$130 million), but since exports are 
usually heavy at the end of th.c year, it is possible that the 'trade balance 
will be no less than planned. ' Partial trade returns from non-bloc countries 
suggest that Communist China's trade with the free world continues to 
account for about one-quarter of its total trade, with imports about 10 
percent above the 1956 level and exports registering a slight decline. The 
increase in imports resulted primarily from greater direct purchases from 
Western Europe and increased imports Of Indonesian rubijer 'and. Egyptian cotton. 
? 
An increase in trade by 8.6 percent is planned for-1958, which would 
bring the total back to the 1956 level. On the beisis of improved crops 
and -collections in 1957, Peiping shadld 'be able to expand its exports 
substantially. Although there was no increase in the amount budgeted-for 
foreign aid, the absence of foreign' loans, coupled with an increase of 16 
percent in the servicing of. the foreign debt, will severely .1 imi  t an 
expansion of imports. In additicihi Peiping may have to settle its postponed 
Soviet export commitmentS: At the -end of 1195' an' agreement was announced 
on the "readjustment of mutliai settlement of non'-trade.payments" which

could reflect some easing of Peipind's obligations to the USSR, but

Reports of planning developments during the year indicated that the regime 
was not planning to increase exports of basic foodstuffs, but was directing 
its attention to possibilities for increasing export production of ores and 
minerals, manufactures, and other products and for reducing the import 
requirements of its industrial program.

6. Labor. During 1957 the regime was attempting to restore an 
orderly and coherent labor policy after the sharp increase in employment 
and wages in 1956. At the beginning of 1956, when the regime was opti-
mistic over its resources, it decided to raise wages to improve morale and 
productivity. Since 1952 money wages had risen only 14.7 percent and real 
wages only 6.9 percent, and labor was getting restive. More important, the 
wage structure had remained relatively static since the days when wild 
inflation levelled all incomes to subsistence levels, and did not provide 
adequate incentives to skilled workers and technicians, or sufficient 
prestige and authority to such groups as teachers and low-level government 
officials. Accordingly, it was decided to extend a Nage increase averag-
ing 14 percent which". would be applied selectively among various groups, 
some effective April 1 and others July 1. During the year the regime 
failed to calculate non-agricultural labor requirements accurately or to 
control hiring sufficiently, and annual average wage employment under the 
state plan rose by 2.3 million -- nearly three times the planned increase 
-- to 21.2 million, and reached 22.4 million at the end of the year. Total 
wage earners at the end of the year, including those not under the state 
plan, were estimated at 24.2 million. 
In 1957, to ease the inflationary impact, it was planned to reduce 
employment by 140,000 by the end of the year, although average employment 
over the year would still exceed that of 1956 by 4.7 percent. Keasures 
were taken to rescind or limit some wage increases. Rural officials, 
originally favored, were to have their incomes brought back in line with 
peasant incomes. Advancement of apprentices was suspended, and other

promotions were to be carefully scrutinized and justified. Despite such 
actions, average mages were expected to rise by 4.2 percent in 1957 
(to 153 or US522 monthly) as the modified 1956 increases became effective 
over an entire year. The total wage bill would thus rise 9.4 percent to ' 
114.1 billion M5.7 billion), 
The regime reported average employment in 1957 at 23,973,000 and 
the mage bill-at Y15.25 billion (US)6.2 billion). However, the state plan 
now apparently includes all wage earners, and these figures appear to be 
consistent with the planned figures. In the plan for 1958, total wage 
earners will number 24,392,000, and the mage bill will increase to g15.8 
billion (US,6.4 billion). Of the increase in the mage bill, 1300 million 
(US3122 million) represents the wages for the 419,000 additional workers 
while 1250 million (US102 million) covers wage increases from promotions 
or minor' adjustments in the mage structure. The figures for total wage 
earners include those to be sent to rural areas, since these persons will 
apparently be carried on the rolls of their original organizations for at 
least the first two years. 
The limited rise in employment during 1957 and planned for 1958, 
numbering about 300,000 over the two year period, has intensified the 
problem of maintaining student and worker morale. In the expansion of 
the educational system during the First Five-Year Plan, a subsidized 
education was provided for all students who Mere able to advance at all 
grade levels. By the 1956-57 academic year, however, the educational 
system had filled out to the desired pyramidical structure. Tlhereas 
formerly the educational system had furnished limited numbers of college

and vocational vocational school graduates to the labor force -which were largely 
offset by the numbers drawn out of the labor force to fill college and 
middle schbol enrollment quotas, in June 1957 the educational system 
released 55,000 college graduates, 90,000 senior middle school graduates, 
800,000 junior middle school graduates, several hundred thousand vocational 
school graduates, and 4,000,000 primary school craduates. These numbers 
will increase in June 1958, and it appears that in the two years the 
educational system, excluding primary school graduates, will have released 
to the labor force eight to nine times the increase in urban workers and 
staff. The students are thus faced with the dual realization that edu-
cational advancement will be extremely competitive and limited and that 
employment prospects on completion of their education are very restricted. 
At the same time the regime faces a problem in organizing the urban 
labor force to absorb the numbers turned out by the educational system. 
The rapid expansion in the urban labor force in the past eight years has 
resulted in the promotion of large numbers of poorly educated and trained 
personnel to administrative, technical, and managerial posts. This group 
is regarded as incompetent by the young graduates, and in turn regards 
the latter as a threat to its position and status. In early 1957 the 
regime appeared ready to denand higher standards of performance and 
gradually to weed out incompetents. However, as the extent of "rightist"* 
sentiment in the country became known, the regime slipported the status quo, 
since the existing leadership cadres owed.ltheir-ppsition to the regime and 
could be counted on to be loyal to it.

-14.9-
The current campaign to send some 3,000,000 workers and staff to 
rural areas and "lower levels" appears in part to be an attempt to 
ameliorate this problem. The campaign is aimed primarily at young school 
graduates and will temporarily remove them from competition for adminis-
trative posts. The regime expresses the hope that the differences between 
the old cadres and the young intellectuals will disappear after the latter 
have been "steeled through manual labor," but the program appears to be 
a stopgap rather than a permanent solution. It seems likely that the 
problem will remain as a major source of friction and an obstacle to the 
smooth and efficient organization of the urban labor force. 
The effect of the wage increases of 1956 has been increasingly 
dissipated in 1957, and this trend will probably continue in 1958. During 
1956 the urban population rose by 7.6 percent, resulting in severe short-
ages of housing and other urban facilities and services. The urban retail 
price-index rose 2.3 percent in the 12 months ending March 31, 1957, and 
this index probably understates the real rise in prices. Foodgrain prices, 
which are heavily weighted in the index, remained stable while subsidiary 
foods and household goods prices rose sharply, with vegetable prices 
rising 27.7 percent. By mid-1957 the regime had reduced severe shorilages 
and price fluctuations, but at the cost of increasingly stringent ration-
ing.- The wage earner thus-has had his real wages undercut by rising prices 
and facing crowded urban conditions and limited market availabilities of 
basic staples, probably does not consider himself materially better off.

7. Demography. In 1957, with a more realistic approach to its 
problems 
_Peiping evinced increasing concern over its demographic problems 
and growing determination to undertake corrective action. While a tenta-
tive decision to encourage birth control appears to have been made as 
early as 1953, it has been difficult for the Communists, who traditionally 
have opp66ed neo-Malthusianism for ideological reasons, to provide un-
equivocal authoritative leadership to such a program. At the beginning of 
1957 additional detailed population estimates were released, and the short-
term and-long-range implications they had in the regime's economic program 
and the people's standard of living were discussed in less equivocal terms. 
Subsequently an increased effort to encourage birth control was organized, 
which not only sought to provide and explain contraceptive devices but to 
indoctrinate certain selected groups for increased acceptance of birth 
control. Restrictions on abortion and sterilization were liberalized, 
while youth orgnizations were directed to indoctrinate and exert social 
pressure on youth to postpone marriage, with the implied threat of an 
eventual increase in the legal minimum marriage age if this was not 
effective. These programs were still cautious and experimental, and as 
yet have evidenced no notable success, but they suggest that the regime 
is facing up to the problem and may take more aggressive measures. At the 
same time, the regime is still hampered by the dilemma of reconciling a 
birth control program with the traditional Communist rejection of neo 
NalthuSianism, and during the year sharp warnings were made not to utilize 
the population problem to advocate either alteration or postponement of 
any of the regime's programs.

The-regime was also faced with the more immediate problem of con-
trolling urban growth and migration. The urban population has reported-1Y 
increased from 58 million in 1949 to 39 million in 1956, rising by 7.6 
percent during 1956. Despite an attempted cutback in urban employment in 
1957, there was extensive rural migration to the cities during the winter 
of 1956-57 and again in the autumn of 1957, owing to the food shortages 
in the rural areas. Since employment opportunities were limited, the 
migration in these periods consisted largely of dependants. In Tientsin, 
of 2051000 rural migrants during this .period, half were women, while three-
quarters of_the.males were either, aged and infirm or children. With urban 
unemployment rising, public security bureaus reported increasing concern 
1 - 
over the rise in begging and petty crime. 
The regime has long had control over migrations, requiring regis-
tration and permits for all population movements. However, rural officials 
were reluctant to limit emigration, which would relieve pressures in the 
countryside. In early 1957 controls were tightened; centrpliling hiring 
and thus limiting employment ofgers as a cause of migration. However, 
dependents were able to justify visits to friends and relatives, and 
migration remained large. The regime subsequently instituted paid vacations 
for urban workers with families in %rural villages, apparently to justify 
refusal 4:4 travelapermits to dependents. -.1.'he public security bureaus also 
scrutinized the,urban.;dependent population closely,d pressures were

in the five provinces covering the North China plain and the Huai and 
lower Yangtze rivers, where the problem is serious awing to dense populations, 
unceratain crops, good transportation, and many large cities. Inspection 
of permits mas tightened at rail stations and other transfer points; begging 
and unlicensed peddling were prohibited, penalties were imposed on urban 
organizations failing to hire through the labor department, urban ration 
permits were more tightly controlled, and unemployed peasants in urban 
areas were being rounded up and employed in public works until they could 
be escorted in groups back to their original collectives or assigned to 
new collectives. 
8. Transport. Transportation facilities have been a limiting factor 
in Peiping's industrial program. During 1956, with the expansion in 
industrial output, construction, and urban needs, freight carried by modern 
means of transport increased by 25 percent, leading to severe traffic 
congestion on the railways in North and Central China and parts of Manchuria 
as well as in the Yangtze River ports. (See Appendix, Tables 4 et 5.) With 
the pace of economic expansion reduced in 1957, freight tonnage increased 
by only 9 percent. At the same time, there was a sharp increase in the 
investments allocated to expand facilities on the strained portions of 
the transport system. Thus the regime was able to meet its 1957 require-
ments satisfactorily, but the system is operating with little reserve 
capacity. 
Investments in new rail lines were reduced in order to increase 
investments for -improving. the capacity of the eccisting network. Construction

of the line to Foochow, chiefly of military significance, was postponed 
for a year, and only 36 kms. of track were laid on the Sinkiang line. 
.While 1,7)4.7 kms. of new track were laid in 1956, only 535 kms. were laid 
in 1957, including the restoration of the Kunming-North Vietnam line, 
continued construction of the high-priority Paotou-Lanchou line, and a 
number of industrial lines in the Wuhan and Paptou areas in preparation 
for the erection of large steel mills at these sites. At the same time, 
double-tracking was to be increased by over 600 lans. as compared with 
210 kms. in 1956, and 1/4. railway yards were to be expanded. Because of 
limited production capacity, only 160 locomotives and 6,800 cars were to 
be added to rolling stock, holding the planned increase in rail transport 
to four percent. However, by hauling heavier trains and reducing turn-
round time for cars, rail freight transport rose by 10 percent in 1957 
over 1956. 
Water transport freight tonnage rose by 2)4 percent in 1956 and 
8 percent in 1957 over the proceeding years, keeping pace with the 
expansion of total transport tonnage. The rise in Yangtze river traffic 
accounted for most of the increase, and there was a much smaller expansion 
of coastal and other river traffic. The regime is looking toward a sharp 
expansion of Yangtze River traffic and Yellow Sea coastal shipping to 
relieve strain on important north-south and east-west sections of the 
rail system. During 1957, 108 vessels aggregating 110,000 tons wei-e? 
added to the coastal and river fleets, and there was considerable invest-
ment in port facilities, particularly in congested Yangtze ports.

Truck transport increased sharply in 1956, but .remained at the 1956 
level during 1957 as imports of motor vehicles and petroleum were cut back. 
The regime appears to be curtailing its plans to develop motor vehicle 
transport as a means of opening up isolated rural areas, in order to con-
serve scarce foreign exchange. Instead, native transport -- junks and 
carts -- is to handle such needs. Truck transport, however, will continue 
to be important in servicing the sparsely inhabited peripheral areas such 
as Tibet, Sinkiang, and Inner Mongolia. 
In 1958 traffic requirements will again rise sharply, reflecting 
particularly the sharp rise in coal and steel production and in the capital 
construction program. Railway investment plans are 19.4 percent over the 
1957 outlays, although this increase largely reflects a resumption of new 
line construction. New track to be laid is placed at 1,290 kms., more 
than double that of 1957, while double-tracking is scheduled at 157 kms., 
one-quarter of the 1957 target. Additions to rolling stock will be in-
creased as a result of expanded production facilities, and include 200 
locomotives, 600 passenger cars, and 9,000 freight cars.

C. Military and Public Security 
1. Developments in Military Policy and Organization. Chinese Communist 
military policies during 1957 have continued along lines established in 
previous years, with major emphasis on 1) the modernization of the armed 
forces and the establishment of a regular reserve; 2) the maintenance of 
party controls over the armed forces; and 3) the continuing development of 
a defense industry. The CCP has claimed continuing redudtions in military 
expenditures and in the size of its armed forces. Efforts to promote 
greater economy in the military establishment have reflected the need to 
achieve a balance between the regime's short-term military program and 
its ambitious long-term plans for industrial expansion, including military 
support industries. Economy measures, however, have not been permitted to 
reduce the military effectiveness of the regime. In fact, through modern-
ization, more efficient recruiting and better training, this effectiveness 
probably increased during 1957. 
While the regime continued its previous efforts to modernize its 
armed forces, it claimed continuing reductions in military costs during 
the year... Annual expenditures for military defense, as stated in the 
1957 national budget, totalled 5.52 billion plan (DS02.3billion at the 
official exchange rate), representing 18.85 percent of the total budget. 
This would indicate a reduction in budgeted military expenditures of about 
10 percent from 1956 and 16 percent from the peak year of 1955. This 
leveling off reflects the receipt in 1955 of unusually large quantities 
of Soviet military equipment, possible modest reductions in personnel, and 
economies in overhead expenses.

Thus during 1957, efforts were made to reduce military costs in 
the field of logistics. Early in the year the Rear Services Department 
announced that operating expense's would be cut by one-third; subsequent 
directives issued by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stressed the need 
for greater economy in the use of food, fuel, and other materiel. In 
Janu6.--i7 1958; the director of the Rear Services Department claimed that 
over 70 million yuan had been saved during 1957 through economy measures. 
a. Recruiting policies. In an effort to create a more effective 
military establishment, the regime has continued its previous policy of 
rapidly replacing aging and less educated PLA personnel with younger 
recruits conscripted under the Military Service Law of 1955. During the 
winter of 1956-57, the regime carried out a third draft, concentrating 
chiefly on the 18-year-old age group. Former liberal deferment policies 
were tightened up, and certain types of exemption for government personnel 
were removed. Official figures on the total number conscripted have not 
beeri=released. On the basis of very fragmentary data, it has been roughly 
estimated at 400,000 to 500,000. A fourth draft call, begun in December 
19571_ is scheduled for completion in February 1958. 
- During 1957 the regime made continuing improvements in the general 
quality of new recruits inducted into the PLA, reflected in higher stand-
ards-pf education, Physical fitness, and political reliability. Greater 
efforts have been made to induct youths having some middleschool education. 
According to official claims, over 60 percent of the new recruits have had 
some,education beyond the level of primary school, and a like percentage 
reportedly belongs to the CCP or the -Chinese Communist Youth League.

MD 58 
The government also continued its policy of demobilizing precon-
scription veterans of the PLA. Original targets for the 1957 demobilization 
announced in November 1956 totalled 800,000. In July 1957 the regime 
announced that 620,000 had been demobilized. CCP leaders have claimed that 
the number of veterans damobilired in 1957 exceeded the number of new re-
cruits inducted, resulting in a new reduction in the overall strength of 
the PLA. 
Communist statements on demobilization suggest that more than 90 
percent of the enlisted personnel on active duty prior to 1955 have now 
been replaced, leaving only a small core of experienced personnel. Such 
a rapid rate of turnover in personnel would inevitably result in some 
reduction in efficiency. However, this has probably been more than counter-
balanced by the replacement of illiterate older veterans by younger and 
better educated recruits and by improvements in training. 
Peiping has been gradually formalizing and regularizing procedures 
for demobilization. New regulations issued by the Ministry of Defense in 
January 1958 provided that all men discharged from, the PLA in the future 
should be given indoctrination, prior to demobilization, in such matters 
as agricultural policy, relations with civilians, and participation in 
militia work. Upon demobilization they are expected to register for 
reserve service with their local governments. 
b. Military reserve system. As part of its modernization program, 
the goirernment has been in the process of creating a permanent military 
4. 
reserve. The original blueprint for this reserve system set forth in 
1955 called for the establishment of two reserves -- a first reserve

consisting of officers and men who have completed tours of active duty, 
and a second reserve consisting of men and women between the ages of 18 
and 40 who have not had military experience. Registration for the reserve 
was carried out on a localized and limited basis during 1955, but the 
reserve system as a whole appears to be still in the formative stages. 
Training for reservists has been limited to short-term military 
drills for selected age groups. In August, 1957 the PLA announced that 
reserve training would henceforth be combined with militia training. In 
some areas, at least, the reserve appears to be very closely related to 
the existing militia organization. To date, however, the militia has 
remained a separate organization, having local defense and public security 
functions. 
c. Party control of army. Chinese Communist leaders have continued 
to emphasize strongly the need for maintaining strict party control of the 
armed-forces. This was one of the major themes stressed at the August 1 
Army Day celebrations. Subsequent comments by CCP leaders concerning 
Marshal Zhukov firmly endorsed the existing system of party committees 
and dual leadership by military and political officers in the PLA: 
Since 1956, military men have assumed an increasingly prominent 
role in the highest levels of CCP leadership. Seven of the ten marshals 
of the-PIA are now members of the Politburo and about one-third of the 
new Central Committee members elected in 1956 are military men. However, 
there-has been no indication that the military group in the party bier-
_ 
archy_constitutes a separate "vested-interest" group competing with the 
civilian leaders of the party. All of the military men who have risen

to high rank in the CCP are veteran CoMmunistsmto have long been 
associted with Hao Tse-tung and-whd? are well indoctrinated in Communist 
doctrine.,' 
During 1957 there were a few changes in the assignments of high-
level military leaders. Most of these, however, appear to be routine 
personnel shifts lacking political sianificance. Two of the marshals of 
the PLA, Lo Jung-huan and Liu Po-ch'eng, were relieved of some of their 
operational responsibilities, presumably because both have now been 
4. 
elevated to Politburo status and have acquired more important policy-
making functions. Lo was replaced as head. of the Political Department of 
the PLA by 'Ilan Cheng, now a member of the party Secretariat. Liu was 
replaced as director of the PLA Training Department by Hsiao K'ol another 
veteran general. 
Among the rank and file personnel of the PLA, the percentage of 
CCP members and members of the Youth League has continued to be high. An 
estimated 75 to 80 percent of the officers and men of the PLA belong 
either to the CCP or to the Youth League. This would suggest that the 
PLA remains one of the most politically reliable groups on the mainland. 
Despite a reduction in preferential treatment during 1957, morale apparently 
remains high. 
-The regime's 1957 rectification program was extended to the PLA,

that a small number of "rightists" had been discovered in the PLA, but that 
the great majority of army personnel were politically reliable.

Other efforts continued to be made during 1957 to improve relations 
between the PLA and the people. During February and March, military units 
carried on "love the people" drives, marked by "fraternization" meetings 
between military personnel, government officials, and local:inhabitants. 
Military officers took part in manual labor, and army units continued to 
participate in various economic activities such as land reclamation, rail-
road construction, and harvesting of crops. 
_ The continued dependence of Communist China on the USSR in the 
military field was underlined by the sending of a high-level military 
delegation to Moscow in November 1957. The agenda and results of these 
high-level military talks have not been revealed. 
2. Internal Security. The Chinese Communist regime has continued to 
maintain a very large and effective security and police organization. The 
chief elements in this security network are the Public Security Forces, 
which are an integral part of the regular military establishment, and the 
People's Armed Police, which operate under the Ministry of Public Security. 
The operations of the security and police forces are reinforced by a large 
militia, which has local defense and security functions, and by a system 
of local residents' committees, which are linked up with the lower levels 
of the police and security organization. The regime's controls over the 
population are further reinforced by a network of mass organizations, which 
provide a means of controlling and manipulating various social and occu-
pational groups. 
Since 1949, the regime has carried out a series of nationwide... 
drives against counterrevolutionaries which appear to have destroyed most

of the effective centers of organized resistance to the regime. The most 
recent of these drives, begun in 1955 and completed in 1957, resulted in 
the exposure of almost 500,000 persons, most of whom were labelled "counter-
revolutionaries." In early 1957, the regime took the position that counter-
revolutionary activity had been virtually eliminated. Following the "anti-
rightist" phase of the rectification campaign, however, there was renewed 
emphasis on the continuing need for periodic drives against counterrevolu-
tionaries for an indefinite Period. 
_ During the latter half of 1957, the regime issued several new 
regulations which further formalized and systematized its internal security 
system and provided additional evidence of renewed emphasis on police state 
methods. 
In June, the central government issued a series of comprehensive 
regulations defining the "people's police" as a "state security force 
having the character of an armed force." Its chief functions will include 
the maintenance of public order, the arrest of counterrevolutionaries, the 
guarding of prisons and important government buildings, and the direction 
of local-security committees. 
In August, a series of new regulations concerning "labor custocly" 
was promulgated. These permitted administrative instead of judicial pro-
cedures-to deal with troublemake'rs: and, people not engaged in regular 
occupations. The regulations provide that such people can be assigned 
work by local government agencies. The "labor custody" system differs from 
the existing system of "labor reform" in that it applies to people who have 
not been convicted of crimes and provides compensation in the form of wages.

In September another method for controlling petty;criminals and 
troublemakers was officially proposed. This involves the drawing up of 
communal pacts by villages and rural cooperatives which place restraints 
on such people. It was further suggested that habitual troublemakers in 
the cities would be assigned to agricultural cooperatives and forced to 
work under surveillance. 
In October 1957 the government issued new security regulations 
covering minor breaches of public order not sufficiently serious enough 
to be dealt with under ordinary criminal law. The prescribed penalties 
range from fines to short periods of detention. At the same tithe new 
regulations were adopted concerning disciplinary actions against government 
officials guilty of maladministration and other illegal actions. 
In January 1958, the central government issued a new series of 
regulations regarding the maintenance of population registers, which further 
standardized a system of household registration plre0y in existence for 
some time. Under these new regulations, population registers are estab-
lished for each household and placed under the control of local security 
agencies. The registration system will enable the public security agencies 
to maintain strict surveillance over the population and to establish tighter 
controls over freedom of movement. One of the stated reasons given for the 
promulgation of these regulations at this time is the need to restrict the 
migration of peasants to urban areas, as well as the migration of popu-
lation to areas designated as "national border defense areas."

D. -Sino-Soviet Relations 
1. General. Developments in the relationship of Communist China to 
the USSR and the bloc during 1957 affirmed existing trends. Peiping 
attempted at every opportunity to underscore its support of Moscow as the 
leader of the bloc and to emphasize its overriding concern that the strength 
and uhity of the bloc vis-a-vis the West should not again be jeopardized. 
At the same time Peiping manifested an independence of thought and an 
increased initiative in ideological formulations which enhanced its influence 
through the bloc. These developments underscored the acceptance of Peiping 
within the bloc as the senior Communist power next to Moscow. Communist 
China's increased stature attained during the period of de-Stalinization 
and the Polish and Hungarian crises in 1956 was clearly not a temporary 
gain during a phase of Soviet adversity, but persisted even at the post-
sputnik celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, 
the high point of Soviet post-Stalin prestige. Welcoming Peiping's 
underlying support throughout the year, the USSR demonstrated considerable 
_ 
tolerance for Communist China's ideological views and enhanced position. 
MOSCOW publicized Maols theoretical formulation on "contradictions," and 
incorporated formulations that were identifiable as of Chinese Communist 
origin in the main address at the 40th anniversary Celebration. 
Beneath the surface of developments reflecting these trends was the 
continuing critical dependence of Peiping upon the USSR as a source of 
supply "Of essential equipment, economic and technical assistance, and 
military aid, including the military guarantees inherent in the Sino -Soviet

alliance. Peiping's -economic relations with the USSR and other bloc states 
continued to be close, although officially Communist China remained an 
observer rather than a member of the Council for Economic Mutual Assistance 
(CEMA). There were, however, indications that Peiping was attempting to 
scale down some of its import requirements as a result of foreign exchange 
shortages, aggravated by increasing commitments for repayment and service 
on Soviet loans obtained in the period 1950-1955. 
Peiping's dependence on the USSR was further underscored during the 
year by the highly publicized achievements of the USSR in the fields of 
science and weapons development. Communist China has been engaged since 
the Korean war in a crash program to "modernize" its armed forces, but as 
Peiping uses the term, modernization refers largely to conventional armaments. 
In this program Peiping has made great progress with Soviet assistance and 
is hoping gradually to achieve a greater degree of self-sufficiency; but if 
Peiping is planning ultimately to modernize beyond this level by equipping 
its forces with nuclear weapons and long-range missiles; it undoubtedly 
recognizes that it will be altogether dependent upon the USSR for a much 
longer period. 
2. Peiping's Position Clarified. 1956 closed with the announcement from 
Peiping that Chou En-lai would interrupt his South Asian tour for a visit 
to Moscow, Warsaw, and Budapest. Prior to this visit, Peiping on December 28 
released its definitive "Marxist" explanation of de-Stalinization and the 
situation in Poland and 'Hungary, to clarify its position on, these develop-
ments-. This statement placed Peiping on record as supporting Soviet actions

in Hungary but maintained Communist China's latitude in criticizing past 
"errors" in Soviet policy, whether these had previously been admitted by 
Moscow ox not(for example, Peiping cited Stalin's sometime tendency 
toward "great nation chauvinism" -- an "error" that had not previously 
been mentioned by Moscow sources). However, Peiping laid down what it 
regarded as the essential elements of Marxism that could not be challenged 
even in "comradely" criticism: i.e., the Leninist organization of the party, 
the necessity for revolutionary struggle and for the establishment of the 
"dictatorship of the proletariat," planned socialization and economic 
development, and opposition to "imperialist aggression." It made clear 
that it would not countenance criticism of the USSR or the Soviet system 
such as that made by Tito or actions such as those taken by Nagy that 
brought these principles into question, that threatened the solidarity of 
the bloc, or that seemed to lose sight of the common enmity of the bloc to 
the Nest, to which Peiping demanded that all family squabbles be subordinated. 
The December 28 statement included an elaboration of a point Peiping had 
previously raised in regard to Stalin's "errors" -- that these constituted 
reflections of "non-antagonistic" contradictions such as inevitably arise 
even under socialism, and must not be confused with the "basic" or 
antagonislic" contradiction between socialism and Western capitalism-
imperialism. 
After the December 28 statement, Chouls visit to Moscow, Warsaw, 
and Budapest was something of an anti-climax. Chou stressed on every 
occasion, the necessity for solidarity among Communist states. He did not

further publicly elaborate on Peiping's criticism of Moscow's past actions, 
in line with what appeared to be the primary purpose of his trip -- to help 
reestablish the bloc's common front against the West. Instead, Chou 
stressed Peiping's acceptance of Soviet leadership in the bloc. Ever the 
diplomat, however, Chou En-lai subtly tailored his formulations to local 
prejudice-S, consenting to the omission of any reference to Soviet leader-
ship in a communique issued jointly with Gomulka (Chou later explained that 
"if no unanimity can be reached for the time being, it would also be normal 
to reserve-the differences while upholding our solidarity"). 
3. New Light on "Contradictions." After Chou's trip the emphasis in 
Peiping's policies shifted to the situation within China. In his "secret" 
speech of February 27, 19573 Mao Tse-tung restated the thesis of "antago-
nistic" and "non-antagonistic" contradictions in terms of current Chinese 
Communist domestic problems, which he sought to alleviate through a period 
of "blooming and contending." Although Mao's speech was intended to meet 
an internal crisis in Communist China, it was cited in various partial 
versions by "revisionist" and anti-Soviet elements in Poland and elsewhere 
as offering a new "liberalized!' Marxism, notwithstanding the fact that the 
December T28 statement had already laid dawn the limitations on free criticism. 
In_the initial Febrrary 27 version of the speech, Mao reportedly 
restated--the Chinese 'Communist position in regard to Eastern European 
developments, elaborating- on the criticism of past Soviet policy contained 
in the December. 28 statement. However,' in the editing of the speech for 
its official public release on June 18, most of the discussion of Eastern

Europe was deleted, presumably to underscore the domestic preoccupation of 
the speech and to avoid its misuse by anti-Soviet elements. At the same 
time, Mao inserted his "six criteria" for permissible criticism, probably 
because-the original version bad occasioned "excessive" criticism within 
China and misinterpretation of Mao's position elsewhere. 
he revisions in Mao's text, while motivated primarily by consider-
ations of domestic policy, reflected also Peiping's desire that ideological 
matters should not undermine the Sino-Soviet alliance and bloc solidarity. 
Moscow for its part made a similar effort, deleting from the published 
version of a television interview by Kbrushchev a Temark that the "contra-
dictions" thesis did not apply in the USSR. Mao's "contradictions" thesis 
was first published in the USSR in the form of an April 13 People's Daily 
editorial reflecting the original unedited text) and the Soviet press 
carried the final revised version of June 18. Mao's theory was presented 
to the Soviet and Eastern European audience as a definite contribution to 
Marxism-Leninist theory of general interest, although developed for the 
particular circumstances of China and not necessarily of general applicability. 
4. Popular Attitudes Toward USSR. Aside from the ideological implica-
tions of Mao Tse-tung's "secret" speech, domestic political events in 
Communist China apparently had no direct impact on relations between the 
USSR and Communist China. However, the criticism of the regime that was 
permitted to be published during the "blooming and contending" period 
revealed significant hostile attitudes toward the USSR among some sectors of 
the Chinese intelligentsia. It was clear from Mao's speech and from

discussions published in Chinese Communist magazines and newspapers that 
Chinese intellectuals and students accepted the official Communist version 
of the Soviet intervention in Hungary only with reservations. More 
significantly, serious questions and even an unfavorable comparison with the 
US seem to have arisen in connection with Soviet economic policies toward 
Communist China., At the height of the "blooming and'contending" phase, 
Lung Yun, former warlord of Yunnan province and a vice-chairman of the 
Chinese Communist National Defense Council, stated that it was unreasonable 
for Communist China to bear the entire expense of the Korean war. Unlike 
the US which had cancelled some wartime loan repayments, the USSR was' 
requiring repayment for loans, and that it was doing this despite the 
uncompensated Soviet removals from Manchuria after the war. Lung Yun's 
views were described as "absurd!' by Peiping, and in early 1958 he was 
expelled from his positions in the NPC and the National Defense Council. 
However, his criticisms probably struck a responsive chord among many 
people, probably including some CCP members.

S. Official Visits. As in previous years, Peiping engaged .in an 
extensive exchange of delegations with the USSR and other countries of 
the Communist bloc. In addition to the usual exchanges of "unofficial" 
visitors and the customary trade and cultural delegations, an unusual 
-Tmnber of bloc states were represented repeatedly in Peiping by high-
level but largely ceremonial governmental, parliamentary, or military 
-delegations, including an unprecedented number of heads of state. 
Prominent bloc visitors to Communist China during the year included Soviet 
President Voroshilov (April and May), Czech premier Siroky (March), 
President Cyrankiewicz (April) and Defense Minister Spychalski (September 
and October) from Poland, Hungarian premier Kadar (September and October), 
and Yugoslav Vice President Vukmanovic (September). Of the Asian 
Communist leaders, both Ho Chi Minh and Kim Il -sung passed through 
Communist China several times. 
Peiping reciprocated these and other bloc delegations to Communist 
China with Chou En-lails trip in January to Moscow, Warsaw, and Budapest 
(and his talks in Moscow with other bloc officials, particularly the 
East Germans), Mao's attendance at the November celebration of the 
ammiversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, and Pleng Chents parliamentary 
delegation to Eastern Europe. However, despite a publicly announced 
invitation, Mao did not reciprocate Polish President Cyrankiewiczt 
visit, possibly because he did not want to detract from the prominence 
accorded the USSR in the November anniversary celebration by visiting 
Warsaw, a capital that by no means saw eye to eye with Mao in regard to 
the defefence to be paid to Soviet leadership within the bloc.

Some of thea bloc delegation p toured Communist China during the 
height of the "blooming, and contending'! and "reptification" period. In a 
number of cases, the Chinese Communist press publicized the extent to 
which the visiting delegations were.given glimpses into these Chinese 
Communist activities. Vorosbilov and members of his delegation were 
particularly quoted as engaging in good-natured banter with Chinese 
Communist officials about the rectification drive and the danger of 
estrangement between the party and the masses. In a different vein, 
Hungarian Premier Kadar was quoted at the time of the "anti-rightist" 
phase of the rectification movement as underscoring the importance of 
suppressing "rightism" in order to avoid a Hungarian-type uprising. In 
advertising these unique Chinese Communist programs to the visiting 
delegations from other bloc countries, Peiping appears to have displayed 
considerable pride of innovation and discovery. (The same note was touched 
in November by Mao himself in Moscow, when be desoribed for the benefit 
of his Supreme Soviet audience the rectification process as a Chinese 
Communist development.of Leninism.)

Polish-Hungarian crises of 1956. Two scientific delegations discussed 
questions of Soviet scientific and technical assistance to Communist 
China. A major military delegation, called to Moscow after lffaofs 
arrival, without prior public notice, held discussions with Soviet military 
leaders. Economic discussions may have been started on trade and other 
questions. Mao and some of the military and foreign office specialists

the fact that a Chinese Communist delegation was present (until its

diplomatic missions in Peiping to an unprecedented two-hour conferenCel

indicated that the., USbad adopted a "two Chinas" policy in recognition 
of the impasse its previous China policy had reached.' Chou stated that

ing additional international recognition for the GRC. Chou termed any 
such development entirely unacceptable to the Peiping regime, and. 
proclaimed that henceforth Communist China would not participate in Rry 
conference to which the CRC had761so,1),een invited.

the GRC, Peiping continued, except briefly after the Taipei riots, to 
? 
charge that the US was an unteliable ally for the GRC and that it was 
seeking to displace the present GRC leadership with "liberals" or with 
T " 
advocates of Taiwanese independence. The Chinese Communists continued 
subtly to encourage rumors that negotiations between them and GRC-leaders 
, 
were in process or about to be initiated, and on several occasions 
Chou En-lai and other spokesmen renewed previous offers of a vaguely-
described ?"high position" for Chiang Kai-shek, if he would subordinate 
his regime to that of Communist China. Perhaps because of the current 
lack of international publicity for the Geneva ambassadorial talks, 
Peiping's propaganda failed during the year to press strongly for a 
US-Chinese Communist foreign ministers' meeting. Chinese Communist 
charges of US subversive activities were generally linked to charges of 
GRC subversion and seemed to bear less on US-Chinese Communist relations 
v, 
than on domestic developments, such as drives against "counter-
revolutionaries," or on relations with other countries, such as Great 
Britain, which was repeatedly accused. of permitting Hong Kong to be 
used as a base for US and GRC subversive activities and espionage.

at the Far Eastern area. The Chinese Communists, while moderately active 
in the Niddle East, did not attempt to match the more dramatic Soviet

moves. For e2ample, they played a distinctly secondary role at the Cairo 
Asian-African Solidarity Conference, in contrast to the preeminent role

Peiping similarly followed the Soviet lead. Peiping expressed its approval

of each Soviet move in regard to disarmament, NATO, and other issues, but 
initiated no moves of its awn. There were no significant developments

in Chinese Communist relations with Western European states, other than 
a deterioration of relations with the UK because of a series of relatively

a tour of seven South and Southeast Asian non-Communist countries: 
Cambodia, India, Burma, Pakistan, Afghanistan, .Nepal, and Ceylon. (Chou 
also visited North Vietnam). Chou's trip was followed up with the usual

Speaker of Parliament Sartono of Indonesia, the Crown Prince of Yemen, 
and the by now customary succession of Japanese politicians, newsmen, 
military figures, and cther ,7roups. 
Despite Peiping's critical foreign exchange situation, the Chinese 
Communists made five major offers or grants of economic aid and loans: 
a grant of USa5750,000 to Ceylon in September, a loan offer of . 
US;d4,200,000 to Burma in December, a loan offer of US20,000,000 to 
Indonesia in September, an interest-free loan of USa6,000,000 to Yemen 
in January 1958, and, apparently, an indirect offer of some USI/0,000,000 
to Laos in February 1957., (A. reported offer of U3:a4,000,000 to Jordan 
in June has not been confirmed.) These aid offers were in addition to 
those previously granted: US22,400,000 to CaTbodial.USa2,600,000 to 
Nepal, and US,700,000 to Egypt during the Suez crisis. 
In addition to the aid offers, Peiping negotiated a number of 
trade agreements with non-Communist countries during the year. .However, 
Peiping generally took a more moderate position than previously in regard 
to the potentialities for expansion of trade. Several tradeddellegations 
were-told that the tightness of:foreign exchange and the still,very

by pointing to the partial nature of the relaxation of trade controls 
by the UK and Japan and to continuing restrictions on certain categories 
of items that Peiping was most anxious to obtain. 
As in past years Peiping attempted to extend its influence in 
the Asian area also through covert use of local Communist movements and 
overseas Chinese. However, the Chinese Communists were not overtly active 
in the twomost critical situations in the non-Communist Far East during 
the year -- the Lao and Indonesian crises. Offers of economic aid were 
made but did not figure importantly in either crisis. Peiping otherwise 
confined itself publicly to propaganda support for a coalition government 
in Laos and for the West Irian campaign in Indonesia, and sought particu-
larlt-to.identify the US as an obstacle to Lao and Indonesian aspirations. 
The Lao and Indonesian crises nevertheless created opportunities for the 
exparision of Communist Chinese influence through its connections with 
indigenous Communist movements and through its espousal of the "peaceful 
coexistence" and "Asian-African solidarity" line. The Indonesian crisis 
may have expedited Indonesian ratification of the Indonesian-Chinese 
Communist treaty on the status of overseas Chinese, pending since April 
1955.-
Despite the prominence of some of the Chinese Communist activities 
.7 
during the year, no new diplomatic recognition was accorded Peiping. 
--
Overtures for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Ghana, 
.61 
Malaya, and Tunisia were not reciprocated by those countries. Ambassadors 
were exchanged for the first time with Ceylon, stemming from the recog-
nition _of Peiping by Ceylon in 1950 and from a September 1956 agreement

to exchange representatives. Similarly, the Treaty of Friendship signed 
:w r 
with Yemen on January 12, 1958 -- the first such formal treaty by Peiping 
-; r ? t-j-f..!.. 
outside of the Communist bloc -- reaffirmed a previous (1956) agreement 
L. 
between. Yemen and Peiping to exchange diplomatic representatives. 
In fields other than recognition, Peiping's achievements during 
the year were likewise limited. Chou En-lai's reception in the cities 
he visited on his Asian tour, although generally favorable, was marred 
by _Peiping' s unqualified backing for Soviet intervention in Hungary. 
This was dramatized by the sudden interruption of the tour for the trip 
to Ebscau, Warsaw, and Budapest, which necessitated a rearrangement of 
the second half of his itinerary on very short notice to the host govern-
ments. Chou's trip led to a joint communique in every country but India; 
the omission probably reflected the divergent views on Hungary, under-
scored the gap that exists between Communist China and non-Communist 
Asia whenever Peiping reveals its overriding adherence to bloc as distinct 
from Asian aspirations. 
There were some other differences between Peiping and the non-
Communist countries that were not altogether obscured by Peiping's 
propaganda and diplomacy. A tour of India by the Tibetan Dalai Lama 
.1 
coincided with Chou's Asian tour and led to Chinese Communist charges 
that the Dalai Lama had been subjected to improper US pressure in India

Relations with Burma were aggravated bY the unresolved border question, 
which despite 'all'Bui-mese efforts seemedno nearer to solution at the 
beginning of 1958. Peiping's relations with a number of countries 
? 
suffered from Communist China's ties with local Communist movements and 
overseas Chinese; Chou was questioned sharply on both issues by local 
journalists during his tour. 
Chinese CoMtunist relations with Japan deteriorated during the 
year,'clespite a continuing flow to Communist China of Japanese delegations 
representing all political viewpoints and despite the fact that Japan had 
followed the UK lead in freeing a large number of commodities previously 
embargoed under Chincom regulations for export to Communist China. 
Peiping has been particularly adroit in practicing "people's diplomacy" 
with 'Japan and has succeeded in promoting trade and other relations 
through 'unofficial contracts, frequently involving Japanese politicians 
? 
of both major parties. The Chinese Communists have generally stressed 
a "reasonable" line in such contacts, taking the position that Japan

initially need not alter its relations with the US and the GRC in order 
to improve relations. however, Premier Kishi's trip to Taiwan in June

Chinese Communist relations with the UK have similarly deteriorated. 
On a number of occasions during the year Peiping complained through 
diplomatic and propaganda channels of Britain 's alleged ."unfriendly" 
attitude in connection with Hong Kong. Peiping sought to obtain permission 
tR establish an official representative in Hong Kong -- a request that the 
British reportedly intend to reject as they have done when it was raised 
in previous years. Other issues raised repeatedly included Britain's 
? alleged excessively lenient treatment of anti-Communists involved in the 
1956 Hong Kong riots and alleged improper resettlement of Chinese resi-
dents of an area of Hong Kong that was being redeveloped. In addition, 
- Peiping on several occasions leveled charges at the British of permitting 
Hong Kong to be used as a base for GRC and US subversive and espionage 
activities, as indicated above. 
Probably a more basic issue than the minor incidents in connection 
with Hong Kong was Peiping's apparently increasing irritation at Britain's 
stand with the US on many Far Eastern issues. Repeatedly since mid-1957 
Chinese Communist propagandists purported to see indications in various 
-.British actions (such as permitting a Chinese opera troupe from Taiwan 
to perform in the UK) of an espousal by Britain of a "two Chinas" 
formula, and Peiping formally protested on one occasion regarding this 
--issue. In a sharply-worded interview in January 1958 with Reuters 
correspondent David Chipp, Chou En-lai stated that relations between 
- -fCommunist China and the UK should have improved after the 1954 Chou-Eden 
talks in Geneva but that instead Britain had "even retreated, toeing the 
-7American line in every matter." Chou complained that Britain's position

117 FUTURE TRENDS 
A. Political and Social 
? ? 
Peiping's objectives in domestic political and social matters have 
undergone no significant change in the last year. These fundamental 
objectives are to consolidate control of the country; to mobilize the 
country to contribute more effectively to the ambitious economic and 
m4itary programs; and to complete the process of transforming the 
#is.titutional patterns and the thinking of the people along Communist 
lines. Towards these ends the Chinese Communists are attempting to 
strengthen the party, governmental, and security apparatuses; to 
increase the degree of positive popular support; and to build up a large 
. ? , 
corps of professionally capable and politically reliable persons to fill 
? ? ? 
the pressing needs of industry, agriculture, science, education, 
government, and party. 
1. The Party. Crucial to the Chinese Communists' future prospects 
?,. 
is the strength and, vigor of the party itself, which in turn depends on

the effectiveness of its leadership and the effectiveness of the rank-. 
and-file members. 
, a. Effect of policy disagreements. For years the CCP leader-
ship has demonstrated a-unity and, vigor seldom found in other comminist 
parties.. Deyelopments, during 1957 suggest that at ?.east temporarily

It appears unlikely that the of professional elites

to die. Such groups, with backgrounds different from those of present 
.t 
party leaders, will not develop for some years. Moreover, the CCP is 
undoubtedly aware of this latent problem, and will continue to take all

possible steps to ensure that the emerging elite groups remain responsive

to party policy and control. 
b. Probable situation should Mao die. It is not unlikely that

party authority would probably pass at first to a collective group corn-
prising, under present circumstances, Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, Teng

_Hsiao-p'ing and Chien Yun, with Chu Teh becoming titular head of state. 
- : 
However, as recent developments in the Soviet Union again demonstrated, 
? 
a genuine collective leadership cannot last long in a Communist totali-
tarian state. It is thus likely that both policy disagreements and 
power rivalries would become more pronounced and that Chou, Liu or Teng

2. Popular Response. The Chinese Communists are committed to an 
economic program which at besCwill provide during the next five years 
only slight material benefits to the people; they are also committed to 
a political and social program which creates more antipathy than goodwill.

The Chinese Communists recognize their problem, and have solved 
one aspect of it by creating a strong security system which is capable 
of preventing a popular uprising of sufficient dimensions to threaten 
the existence of the regime. A considerable number of cases of sporadic 
but isolated and small-scale active resistance will probably continue to 
occur during the next five years, particularly in rural and ethnic 
minority areas. The regime will probably be able quickly to quell these 
minor revolts, and suOh repercussicits-ds they might have are likely to be

unlikely that the regime will permit the peasants to retain appreciably

there is little likelihood of a marked improvement in worker morale. 
c. Anti-Chinese feeliu in,minority areas. The regime will 
probably continue to face acute problems in minoritY-inhabited areas. 
There were indications in the fall of 1957 that the regime was shifting 
its policy away from the cautious, conciliatory line followed since 1956 
to a new emphasis on imposing Communist control and programs. The shift 
in policy probably reflects a combination of factors, including a con-
cern that conciliation might permit anti-Chinese and anti-Communist feel-
ings to become more vocal and better organized, and perhaps renewed 
confidence in its ability to handle dissidence that might flare into 
minor rebellion. During the next year or so, Peiping will probably under 
the guise of combatting "narrow nationalism" attempt to rout out or 
suppress dissidence in,minority areas. There are some indications that 
the new, harsher line will be applied also to Tibet, but Peiping will 
almost cert-ainly be forced to proceed more cautiously in that area than 
in the minority areas that have been longer under Communist rule and that 
are more accessible to the application of Communist force. It seems 
probable-that no matter how Peiping balances force and persuasion in its 
minority policies, the historical anti-Chinese feeling among !minorities 
will continue to manifest itself in periodic minor disturbandes and, ir

3. Trained Personnel. During the period 1958-62, Communist China 
plans to graduate about 500,000 students from its higher educational 
institutions -- a reasonable estimate in view of the current enrollment 
of 443)000. Together with the approximately 370,000 that have been 
previously graduatedlihfi.:will Provide Criii4ce of some 870,600 persons --
disregarding attrition -- who have completed their university-level 
education under the Chinese Communists. Currently, about one-third of 
the students are enrolled in teacher-training courses -- an indication 
of the regime's planned expansion of primary and middle school education? 
Another one-third are enrolled in engineering courses, and seven to eight 
percent in each of the fields of science, agriculture and forestry, and 
medicine. It is probable that proportions approximating these will be 
maintained over the next five years. 
? 
Despite these impressive figures, the regime will experience 
difficulty in meeting the industrial and scientific needs for persons 
with advanced training and experience. In 155-56, 4,800 students were 
receiving post-graduate training) largely in technical fields. Some 
10,000 students have been sent abroad since 1949, the large majority to 
the Soviet Union, and an unknown percentage of these have received 
advanced training. These programs will probably be accelerated, parti-
cularly in the scientific field) in view of the regime's ambitious 
.;?: ? 
objective of approaching the most advanced levels attained in the world 
in many important fields of science. 
By 1962, the regime plans to double the enrollment in primary and 
? 
middle schools, hoping to approach the goal of universal primary

education in 1967. -Whether or not this target is reached, it appears that 
the previous problem of an insufficiency in the number of persons qualified 
to enter the higher institutions no longer exists. This expansion is lead-
ing to a broadening of the base of the educational pyramid and is creating 
the problem that the expectations of many primary and middle school graduates 
cannot be met -- a prospect hardly brightened by the claim that these 
students will comprise the "first generation of cultured workers." 
Despite the planned increase in the number of graduates, the 
regime's need for trained personnel will not be fully met by 1962. There 
will be a particular inadequacy in highly trained and experienced personnel 
in the more advanced scientific and technical fields. The problem is 
aggravated by the regime's apparent feeling that many pre-Communist in-
tellectuals cannot be expected to give loyal and enthusiastic support and 
therefore should not be given positions of responsibility. 
Qualitatively, the regime also faces problems which will make it 
difficult to achieve its stated objective of building up a large group 
that is both "red and expert." Earlier pedagogical methods have been 
declared unsatisfactory and are under revision. There is a shortage of 
qualified teachers. Events in 1957 will further reduce the vigor of 
academic activity. Political indoctrination courses have been increased, 
cutting into the regular curriculum; also, it appears that such courses 
have been resented by at least a portion of the students. Dislike of the 
system of assigning graduates with little regard to their preferences has 
been countered by an expressed determination to enforce rather than 
modify the system.

B. Economic Prospects 
1. The First Five-Year Plan. In assessing Communist China's economic 
prospects, it is useful to review the character of its development in the 
eight years since the regime gained political control of the China mainland. 
The initial three years were described by the regime as a "rehabilitation 
period," characterized by a stabilization of the economy, an extension and 
consolidation of the regime's political controls, and the expansion of 
production with relatively little fixed capital investment. The economy, 
which had been depressed and fragmented by over a decade of war and civil 
war, responded favorably, and by 1952 the regime had sufficiently expanded 
its fiscal revenues and improved its statistical apparatus to undertake 
planned economic development. During 1949-52 the regime claimed increases 
in the gross output of industry and handicrafts from g14 billion (US$5.7 
billion) to 1134.3 billion (US$13.9 billion) (in constant 1952 prices) and 
in gross agricultural output from Y32.6 billion (US$13.3 billion) to 
y48.4 billion (US$19.7 billion). This expansion is almost certainly 
greatly overstated, and reflects improved statistical coverage as well as 
real increases in output. The actual rise in total output is estimated at 
about 20-25 percent, a very rapid rate of expansion but well under half of 
what is indicated by the regime's data. 
-The first Five-Year\ an (1953-57) could be termed a "reconstruction 
period.," yiring which the regime directed much of its investment towaras

utilization of existing plant. A considerable investment in new facilities 
was made during 1953-57, however, much of which would be brought into pro-
duction during the second Five-Year Plan (1958-62). Because of the 
opliOrtunities to increase output with relatively little investment, total 
production continued to rise rapidly, and the regime claims that national 
income during 1953-57 increased about 50 percent in constant 1952 prices, 
as follows:

-98-
prices in 1952 had advanced two and five times respectively, while the 
price of imported goods in terms of the over-valued yuan exchange rate 
had risen only by half. Nevertheless, the real increase in national 
income is probably 70-80 percent of what is claimed, indicating a rapid 
growth of 35-40 percent over the five-year period. 
a. Industry. The growth in industrial output was sharply 
oriented towards heavy industry, and the expansion of gross output by 
industrial sectors during the first Five-Year Plan was as follows: 
(In billion yuan) 
Percent 
Increase 
1952 1957

85% 
All industry

This rapid growth was due largely to the reconstruction of existing 
plant,- particularly the stripped Manchurian industry, and to an increase 
in its utilization. In 1956 the regime estimated that new industrial 
plant completed after 1952 would contribute 15 percent of gross industrial 
output in1957 and 50 percent in 1962. These estimates would indicate 
that the plant existing in 1952 had nearly doubled its output by 1957 
and had contributed nearly three-quarters of the increase in industrial 
output; by 1957 it, was approaching maximum utilization, since an 
increase of only 5 percent in its output was projected for 1962.

Fixed investment in industry during 1953-57 was reported at ;27.8 
billion (US$11.3 billion), or nearly three-fifths of total state capital 
construction. Although this figure should be discounted because of the 
high prices of machinery and equipment which accounted for 38 percent 
of total state capital construction costs -- it still represents an 
impressive development effort. This investment was concentrated in heavy 
industry; the fuel and power industry absorbed about one-quarter and the 
iron and steel and machine industries each about one-eighth of industrial 
capital construction expenditures. 
I. Fuel and power. In the fuel and power industry, coal 
output rose from 63.5 million tons in 1952 to 122.4 million tons in 1957, 
with about two-thirds of the increase resulting from the reconstruction 
and expansion of existing mines. Existing mines absorbed one-third of the 
capital construction expenditures in the coal industry, and their investment 
cost per additicnal annual ton of coal production was about hslf that of 
the new mines. Despite the rapid rise in output, the increase in demand 
was even greater, and. by 1957 coal was distributed under stringent ration 
procedures, affecting household consumption in particular. 
Electric power output rose from 7.3 billion kwh in 1952 to 19 billion 
kwh in 1957, with a doubling in generating plant from 2,000,000 kw to 
4,000,000 kw. A part of the increase in plant represented the restoration 
of Manchurian power facilities removed by the USSR in 1945. Five turbine-
generators aggregating 350,000 kw were re-installed in the Tafengman Dam, 
and the large thermo-planta at Fushun and Fuhsin were rebuilt. Power

-100-
output per kw of capacity rose 30 percent, reflecting in part the 
development of power networks and in part the regulation of demand in 
order to reduce peak loads. 
Although the petroleum industry contributes only a small part of 
the energy resources, it is important to the regime's hopes for industrial 
expansion, and a large investment has been made in exploration and 
development of resources. Crude oil production rose from 436,000 tons in 
1952 to 1,445,000 tons in 1957, of which about two-thirds were obtained 
from natural oil deposits and the remainder from oil shale and coal 
distillation. Despite the regime's efforts, production has legged behind 
the target, and apparently hopes are fading for the discovery of many 
large and easily exploitable oil deposits. In its long-range plans the 
regime-is now calling for the substitution of other energy sources for 
petroleum wherever possible and, despite its high cost, for building new 
facilities for extracting oil from shale and coal. 
ii. Iron and steel. Iron and steel production was sharply 
expanded during the first Five-Year Plan, with pig iron output rising from 
1.9 million tons to 5.9 million tons and crude steel from 1.35 million tons 
to 5.24 million tons. Most of this increase has been obtained from recon-
structing previously existing facilities and through raising the output 
per unit of capacity by various technical measures. At the Anshan plant, 
which produces about half the iron and steel, eight of the former nine 
blast furnaces had been restored by 1957, together with both of its steel 
plants. Production rose far above previous levels as a result of careful

selection and preparation of materials and other measures designed to 
maximize the physical output per unit of capacity. 
iii. Machinery and equipment. In Manchuria and the port 
cities a considerable engineering industry had been built prior to 1949, 
designed to provide repair and maintenance services to existing industries. 
It is largely.this plant, re-equipped and reorganized and provided with a 
guaranteed home market, which has enabled the industry to increase its 
output 4.5 times during the first Five-Year Plan. Mass production of 
certain simpler products within the capabilities of the equipment and 
technology of various factories enabled a rapid.rise in output, but by 
1957 market limitations for these items were restricting output. However, 
there has been considerable investment in new plant, most of which will 
come into production during the second Five-Year Plan. Once in production 
these new facilities will enable increased domestic production of the 
heavier and more complex types of equipment.

-102-
b. Agriculture. Agricultural growth claimed during the period is 
largely the result of more intensive production on existing farms. Culti-
vated land rose 4 percent to 112,000,000 hectares, while crop area rose 
11 percent to 156,000,000 hectares, owing to increased multi-cropping. 
Food output rose 20 percent to 185,000,000 tons grain-equivalent, with the 
food crop area rising 7.3 percent to 120.5 million hectares and per-hectare 
yields rising 12 percent. Shifts to more intensive crops, i.e., rice and 
sweet potatoes, account for about one-third of the increase in yields. 
Other crop developments include a 9 percent increase in major oil crop area 
(soybeans, peanuts, and rapeseed) to 16.8 million hectares and a 3 percent 
increase in yields; a 4 percent increase in the cotton area to 5.8 million 
hectares and a 21 percent increase in yields; and a 61 percent increase in 
miscellaneous crop area to 12.9 million hectares. The claimed increase in 
agricultural productivity was even greater than these figures indicate, for 
1952 was a bumper crop year while 1957 was a mediocre or ordinary crop year. 
There was also a 10 percent increase in labor animals to 84,000,000 head, 
of more than one-third in hogs to 125,000,000 head, and of three-fifths in 
sheep and goats to 97,000,000 head. 
The main factor to which this agricultural expansion is credited 
has been the mobilization of idle and underemployed rural labor for increased 
cultivation work and land improvements. Irrigated land reportedly rose by 
one-fifth to 37,000,000 hectares, and extensive flood control and soil 
conservation measures were undertaken. In addition, chemical fertilizer 
supplies were raised from 333,000 tons to a peak of 2,000,000 tons in 1956, 
providing a small but important addition to soil fertility. Rural coal

supplies were more than tripled to a peak of over 25,000,000 tons in 1956, 
permitting greater use of straw and other by-products as feed and ferti-
lizer. Improved seeds were developed and by 1957 were sown on 40 percent 
of the grain acreage, 80 percent of the cotton acreage, and 30 percent of 
the oilseed acreage. There has also been an increase in the supply of farm 
? tools, and some progress was made in controllina crop pests. Among offset-
ting factors, there has been a sharp decline in draught-animal power per 
crop-hectare, resulting from a decline in the quality of the animals and 
from the fact that the increase in numbers has been largely in the nomad 
grassland areas. Another unfavorable factor was collectivization which has 
upset the production and market organization in the farm areas and has 
adversely affected the production of certain subsidiary products which were 
marginal peasant enterprises. 
Although information is inadequate to assess accurately the consist-
ency of the claimed increase in productivity in relation to the production 
measures taken, it seems likely that the regime has overstated the rise in 
farm output. It has admitted that its agricultural statistics, although 
improving, are still imperfect. Chinese officials, in discussions with 
Indian agricultural missions, have indicated that the data prior to 1952 
were clearly incomplete and that, while data since 1952 is generally compa-
rable, the possibility of a small bias from improved statistical coverage 
could not be ruled out. At the same time, marketing data indicate that the 
production-estimates assume that the peasants have been retaining and con-
suming much larger quantities of grain, cotton, and oilseeds, an assumption 
which seems at variance with the facts. It is of interest to note that

Dr. J. L. Buck's study of Chinese agriculture in 1929-33, which challenged 
the official data of that day, describes an agricultural plant very similar 
to that indicated by the 1957 data, with a comparable rural population, 
cultivated area, irrigated area, multiple crop index, and livestock popu-
lation. This may suggest that much of the expansion of the past eight years 
largely represents a recovery to prewar levels. 
c. Foreign trade. Foreign trade has been an important factor in 
Communist China's first Five-Year Plan, and has supplied the military equip-
ment, capital goods, and essential raw materials required by the program. 
To obtain the necessary imports, the foreign trade policy was to expand 
exports as rapidly as possible in order to finance a greater volume of 
imports, and to limit imports to essential commodities not produced in suf-
ficient quantity in the Chinese economy. During 1953-57, balance of payments 
pressures have been growing, reflecting the cessation of Soviet loans, a rise 
in foreign debt service, continuing high foreign-aid commitments (chiefly to 
North Korea and North Vietnam), and declining receipts from foreign expendi-
tures in China and from overseas Chinese remittances. As a result, although 
exports approximately doubled between 1952 and 1957, imports rose by only 
a third. 
The composition of Communist China's imports and exports during the 
first Five-Year Plan is estimated approximately as follows:

Over three-quarters of Communist China's trade has been with the Soviet 
bloc during the first Five-Year Plan. The Soviet bloc has supplied all of 
the military supplies, most of the capital goods, as well as certain raw 
materials and fuels under Western trade controls, e.g. petroleum. Most of 
the imports from non-Communist countries have consisted of consumer goods 
and raw materials, although some capital goods have been received, including 
uncontrolled items and those shipped in evasion of trade controls. The 
Soviet bloc has absorbed a rapid increase of Chinese exports, although by 
the end of the period Communist China appeared to be directing its attention 
to export markets in non-Communist countries, presumably intending to uti-
lize its export surpluses with the latter areas to settle import deficits 
with the Soviet bloc. 
d. Population, manpower, and consumption. During the first Five-
Year Plan the regime estimated from its 1953 census, its population regis-
tration figures, and its collection of vital statistics in selected areas, 
that its average annual population growth was 2.2 percent during 1553-57, 
and placed the mainland population at 575,000,000 at the end of 1952 and 
640,000,000 at the end of 1957. Urban growth was about twice as rapid as 
total growth, and the urban population rose from 72,000,000 to 92,000,000 
during the period. However, because of the small relative size of the 
urban population, it absorbed less than one-third of the total population 
increase. 
The population engaged in farming increased by 10 percent from 
482,000,000 to 530,000,000 while the non-farming population increased by 
18 percent from 93,000,000 to 110,000,000. Employment in government and

state-controlled enterprises (excluding the armed forces) rose from 10,000,000 
to 24,000,000. Part of this increase reflected the nationalization of private 
enterprise, and the net increase in staff and workers, i.e. wage-earners, 
is estimated at 5,000,000 - 6,000,000. The remaining non-farm labor force 
included the armed forces, personnel in service occupations and handicraft 
cooperatives, and a few unassimilated peddlers and tradesmen. 
Despite the rapid growth in population, the regime claims that the 
even more rapid growth in production has permitted the needs of the develop-
ment program to be met and has provided substantial increases in living stan-
dards, as indicated by the following data in constant 1952 prices of per 
capita consumption taken from its national income estimates:

However, it is believed that the regime has aver-estimated the growth 
in its agricultural output and thus exaggerated farm retentions, which 
constitute about three-fifths of peasant consumption. Further, while peasant 
cash income and consumption of textiles and other manufactures have in-
creased, the peasant preference is to spend the increased income for food 
which has been prohibited by the regime's controls over the distribution of 
the crops. Moreover, the measurement of consumption in 1952 prices, when 
farm prices were low and industrial prices high, has tended to exaggerate the

rate of growth of consumption. Thus, it is believed that real peasant 
consumption has increased very little and that the peasants, in -view of the 
controls over their consumption and the additional work required of them, 
consider themselves worse off in 157 than in 152. 
Real urban per capita consumption has undoubtedly risen during 
1953-57, probably close to the officially claimed rate of 4 percent annually. 
However, urban consumers have had to accept increasingly stringent rationing 
of basic commodities such as foodstuffs, textiles, and coal, as well as 
overcrowded housing and urban utilities. The rise in total per capita con-
sumption includes "social" consumption, such as military, health, and 
education expenditures, which has increased more rapidly than personal con-
sumption.

2. The Second Five-Year Plan. At the 8th Party Congress in 
September 1956, an initial working outline of its second Five-Year 
Plan was presented by the regime. Compared with the 1957 goals of 
the first Five-Year Plan, this plan projected by 1962 a doubling of 
industrial output and an increase of 35 percent in agricultural out-
put which were to contribute to a 50 percent increase in the national 
income. It was calculated that the expenditures would increase at a 
somewhat more rapid pace than national income, and that 'state fiscal 
expenditures during 1958-62 would rise by three-quarters over that 
planned for 1953-57. Tath the expansion in fiscal resources, state 
capital construction was to be doubled, with the shares allocated to 
industry and agriculture rising slightly to 60 and 10 percent respective-
ly. Fiscal expenditures during 1958-62 were indicated to be as follows:

Capital accumulation was to represent a slightly higher proportion of 
national income than in the first Five-Year Plan, but still was to permit 
a rise in consumption comparable to that during 1953-57. 
During 1957, as the regime attempted to work out the details of 
the plan, important modifications were made in the program, reflecting 
a recognition of the limited resources available. While the regime has 
not sumMarized the effects of these changes, it appears to be attempting 
to maintain the projected expansion in total output through a more 
effective utilization of available resources and by stretching out its 
timetable for constructing a modern capital goods industry. 
a. Agriculture. In September 1956 the 1962 farm targets called 
for a 35 percent increase in agricultural output over that planned for 
1957 including an increase in groin production to 250,000,000 tons, in 
cotton production to 2,400,000 tons, and in the hog pop-nation to 
250,000,000 head. During 1957 it was recognized that these goals were 
too ambitious, and the grain target was lowered to 240,000,000 tons, 
the cotton target to 2,150,000 tons, and the hog target to 220,000,000 
head. At the same time, the proposed agricultural development effort 
was increased, notably by raising the chemical fertilizer production 
target from 3,000,000 - 3,200,000 tons to 5,000,000 - 7,000,000 tons. 
In early 1958 long-range provincial targets were being raised sharply 
under the slogan, "advance by leaps and bounds." However, as in 1956, 
such targets appear to serve as a propaganda background supporting an 
agricultural program which calls for widespread changes in cropping

practices) and as yet do not appear to have altered the national targets. 
During the second Five-Year Plan, the emphasis will continue to 
be on increasing the productivity of existing farmland rather than ex-
panding cultivated acreage. The regime claims it has surveyed and found 
suitablr, for reclamation some 35,000,000 hectares in Manchuria, and in 
northwest and south China, but admits that the costs of drainage, irriga-
tion, and other development preclude bringing more than 7,000,000 hectares 
into production during 1958762. About half of this will be reclaimed by 
state farms producing soybeans in Manchuria (1.3 million hectares), cotton 
in the northwest ( .7 million hectares) and tropical crops in south China 
(1.2 million hectares). The balance is to be reclaimed by peasant re-
settlement programs and by bringing into production unused lands in the 
vicinity of the various collectives. Much of these new lands will be of 
marginal productivity, but the regime estimates that the program will 
increase production by the equivalent of 10,000,000 tons of grain. 
Despite the new lands, per capita farm land will decline further 
from .19 hectare in 1952 to .17 hectare in 1962. To increase the land's 
productivity, the regime proposes to mobilize additional rural labor, 
expand irrigation, and improve fertilization in order to increase yields 
and to introduce more intensive cropping systems. During the second 
, Five-Year Plan the irrigated area is to be expanded by 17,000,000 hectares 
.and irrigation facilities improved on 7,090,000 hectares now under irriga-
tion. The regime hopes also to increase the chemical fertilizer supply 
t6 7,000,000 tons, which it estimates will increase grain output by , 
15,000,000 tons and cotton production by 300,000 tons.

Despite the cutback -in taxtetiand'the increase'in-developmefit

has assumed that the Mei.ging of une-lconomiCally sMall farms Into large

land Improvements and additional field work. This assumption is 
warranted by pre-World lar II studies iihiCh show that Chinese peasants

one-fifth of the year; those on the larger farms'accomplished half 
again as much work per man as the average on all farms. However, in 
the first two years of collective operation these labor saVings have 
been dissipated by high administrative aVerhead and the inefficient use 
of labor. The regime ascribes this failUre to inexperience in 1956 and 
timidity in 1957; and its 1958 plan call for mobiliiing substantial 
additional labor. However, the consolidation of the collectives seems 
likely to be a long-term process during which the labor potential will 
not be realized, owing to large administrative overhead, inefficient 
management, and reduced peasant work incentives. 
lath experimental and extension facilities to develop and test 
new techniques necessarily limited, the program for rapid changes in 
cultivation practices is bound to result in costly errors, as in 1956. 
The regime admits this but justifies the program on the grounds that net 
production is to be increased. It has urged its rural cadres not to 
think--like one who has hit his thumb with a hammer--of the finger which 
has been hurt but of the nine which have not been hurt. The individual 
peasant, however, cannot afford to take gambles with his crop, and it is

25 and 30 percent. In view of the di&iculties facing the regimels

b. Industry. Under the second Five-Year Plan working outline, 
gross industrial and handicraft output in constant 1952 prices was to rise 
to Y. 130.6 billion (U53.1 billion) by 1962, or double that scheduled for 
1957 under the first Five-Year Plan. Actually, at the time the -1962 target 
- was announced, the regime was confident it would overfulfill the 1957 
target by 10 percent, so that the actual increase projected for 1962 was 
80 percent over the 1957 level. The ratio of capital goods to consumer 
goods was to be raised to 50:50 in 1962, as compared with the ratio of 
38:62 targeted for 1957 under the first Five-Year Plan and the ratio 
actually achieved in 1957 of about 45:55. While the epansion of capital 
goods output would still be more rapid, the disparity in the rates of 
growth between the two sectors would be reduced in the second Five-Year 
Plan, with consumers goods output rising by over half and contributing 
two-fifths of the total increase in output. 
During 1957 numerous changes were made in the second Five-Year Plan 
industrial program. Part of these adjustments resulted from changing views 
of requirements and natural,resources. Of more importance, however, are 
the indications that the regime found its resources inadequate to carry 
ailt the program it had outlined. As the various ministries worked out the 
details of the program, it became clear that the plan to increase the 
concentration of investment in modern industrial plant --dear to the 
_heart of every Communist regime -- left a wide gap between the targets and 
their means of achievement. A number of factors appear to have been 
involved in this reassessment. One surprise apparently resulting from the

calculations was the sharply rising investment cost per additional unit 
of production projected for the second Five-Year Plan, reflecting the 
necessity to rely on new investment for increased output rather than plant 
reconstruction and intensified use of industrial assets. In addition,,the 
long lead time between investment and the realization of 'production involved 
in the construction of large modern industrial plants apparently had not 
been adequately recognized, and it was found that part of the projected 
increase in output would not actually be realized during the second Five-
Year Plan. Further, the agricultural targets were found to be unrealistic, 
with the prospect that the expansion of consumers goods oUtput would be 
limited by shortages of agricultural raw materials. Again, foreign exchange 
resources were found to be inadequate to support the foreign exchange re-
quirements presented by the program (see Section c, Foreign Trade, below). 
To bring the plan into balance, the regime has increased the 
proportion of investment allocated to small industrial,plants, which it 
is calculated will reduce the investment and import requirements per unit 
of-capacity as veil as the lead time between investMent and realization 
of production. At the same time it is hoped that by scattering these 
plants in medium-sized cities, whiCh have not as yet felt the main impact 
of-urban expansion, the existing labor force and urban supporting 
facilities can be utilized, and nnon-productiven social overhead invest-
meht in housing and urban utilities may be slashed sharply. The.existing,

extensions or complimentary investments. This review has led to abolishing 
the separate management of arsenals, the surplus capacity of which is now 
to be utilized to produce machinery and equipment for the civilian economy. 
Development of coastal industry which has been relatively neglected for 
strategic reasons is to be emphasized where it can show large potential_ 
returns on investments. In addition) productive investment is to be 
economized through the acceptance of lower standards of construction and 
serviceability and the elimination of less essential facilities. 
The lag in agriculture is forcing increased industrial support of 
the farm program. The 1962 target for chemical fertilizer production, 
placed at 3.0-3.2 million tons in September 1956, has been subsequently 
raised to 5-7 million tons) with the stipulation that most of tbs equip-
ment is to be produced in Communist China. In addition, it is proposed 
to develop the production of agricultural machinery designed primarily 
to increase total farm output rather than mere labor productivity. At 
the same time, the tractor program appears to have been cut back in view 
of its high import requirements for equipment and petroleum. As yet, 
this program of industrial assistance to agriculture appears to be in 
the formative stage, with many of the details remaining to be worked out. 
In 1957, following the shortages of coal, power, and basic materials 
in 1956, it was decided to raise initial targets in the second Five-Year 
Plan for these materials to provide a margin of safety. The 1962 target 
for coal production was raised from 190,000,000-210,000,000 tons to 
230,000,000 tons, apparently with the,expectation,that most of the increase

would come from developing small local mines with relatively little in-
vestment and relying priMarily on manpower. Coal deposits are widespread 
in Communist China, and many outcrops are mined on a small scale for local 
use. The 1962 target for electric power output was increased from 40-43 
billion KITH to 44 billion KWIL and later to 50 billion KWH. The initial 
target involved the addition of about 3,800,000 KU to the 4,000,000 KU 
plant existing in 1957, and the later revisions suggest that a further 
1 million KW of capacity is now included in the plan. The additional 
capacity will apparently be obtained from increased domestic output of 
power generating equipment and be partly financed by investment economies 
on the plants originally planned. On the other hand, petroleum targets 
were cut back by an unstated amount from the 5,000,000-6,000,000 ton level 
in recognition of the inadequate resources. 
-The 1962 iron and steel targets were raised to 12,000,000 tons of 
ingot steel, the upper range of the former target of10,500,000-12,000,000 
tons. The steel centers at Wuhan and Pacitoul each with a projected annual 
output of 1.5 million tons steel, are to be completed, although the in-
vestment allocation has been lowered by reducing standards and eliminating 
auxiliary projects.. Some 18 small iron and steel plants are to be built 
with an-annual aggregate capabity of 1.8 million tons, with the expectation 
that they can be completed more quickly'and at an investment cost per ton 
of capacity of less than two-thirds ichat of the larger mills. At the

production targets for 1962 have, however, been lowered to 12,500,000 tons, 
the lover range of the former target of 12,500,000-14,500,000 tons, pre-
sumably reflecting a reduction in building construction following the cut 
in "non-productive" investment. 
Investment in machinery plants has apparently been cut back sig-
nificantly, reflecting in part a cut-back in certain programs, such as 
tractor stations, and in part a postponement in the timetable for developing 
domestic production of heavy and complex equipment, which is now imported. 
However, the Chinese Communists hope that, with the investment program 
now emphasizing less complex facilities, mass production of simpler products 
can be further organized and enable more intensive use of existing facilities. 
As a result of all these adjustments in the industrial program, it 
seems likely that production of capital goods at about the levels projected 
in September 1956 is now a reasonable prospect, and is based on investment 
requirements approximating available resources. On the other hand, con-
sumers goods output is likely to be reduced as a result of lowered agri-
cultural targets, and will probably be reflected in lowered consumption 
targets. In early 1958 industrial goals were being raised rapidly, par-
ticularly at the local levels, but this appears to reflect an attempt to 
activate local planning rather than a realistic raising of industrial sights.

investment in large modern plant in which import requirements formed a 
greater share of total costs. This change may reflect in part a more 
pessimistic view of the balance of payments problems. However, it seems 
likely that import requirements were not fully known until the various 
ministries had worked out the details of allocating the doubled capital 
construction funds; as these calculations were completed in 1957 it became 
apparent that the import needs presented were beyond Communist Chinats 
capacity to meet. 
The balance of payments pressures developed at the end of the 
first Five-Year Plan suggest that there will be no great increase in 
imports during the second Five-Year Plan. During 1953-57 net receipts 
from non-trade items financed a "g" 2 billion (US$.8 billion) import 
balance, but for 1958-62 it is estimated that an export surplus of 
1; 3 billion (U1.3 billion) will be used to finance net expenditures 
from non-trade items, as shown in the following table:

Exports reached a peak in 1956 and fell off slightly in 1957. 
According to the regime, exports during 1958-62 will increase much more 
slowly than during 1953-57. The export of foodstuffs, constituting about 
half of current exports, is to be held constant or reduced slightly; further 
expansion of exports mill depend on increased exports of minerals, in-
dustrial products, handicrafts, and subsidiary agricultural products. 
Despite the planned reduction in export expansion, it is estimated that 
total expotts during 1958-62 may exceed those during 1953-57 by about 
40 percent, reaching a level of1.Y.? 32 billion (US$13 billion). This level 
of' exports would permit an increase of 16 percent in imports to 
Y- 29 billion (US$11.8 billion). 
With the development of the economy, the regime has indicated that 
import requirements for raw materials, fuels, and essential consumer goods 
-wiL1 rise during the second Five-Year Plan. At the same time, it seems 
likely that military imports may decline somewhat as the military forces 
begin to shift from a rapid build-up to a maintenance and replacement phase. 
It seems probable therefore that capital goods imports can be increased 
to some degree. However, with capital construction expenditures being 
doubled it is clear that imports must form a much smaller proportion of 
total investment costs than in the first Five-Year Plan. In September 1956 
it was stated that the machinery industry would supply 60 percent of the 
machinery aria equipment requirements during the first Five-Year Plan and 
70 percent in the second Five-Year Plan, while in 1957 the latter per-
centage was raised to 70-80 percent, suggesting either that other import 
needs had proved greater than expected or that the estimate of total im-
port availabilities had been revised downward.

d. Population, manpower, and consumption. During the second Five-
Year Plan, total population is expected to increase at a rate similar to 
that during the first Five-Year Plan, and rise from 640,000,000 at the end 
of 1957 to 720,000,000 at the end of 1962. Although a birth control program 
is to be promoted during 1958-62, the regime estimates that in view of de-
clining mortality its effect will be to prevent an increase in the rate of 
growth rather than to decrease the rate. During the first Five-Year Plan 
there was an estimated migration of 8,000,000 from rural to urban areas, 
constituting about 40 percent of the urban growth. In the second Five-Year 
Plan it is hoped to reduce such migration sharply through population controls. 
However, the urban population in 1962 will probably reach 105,000,000-
110,000,000. 
Although,the population growth is expected to exceed 15,000,000 
annually, this growth will be concentrated in the group below working age, 
since the population structure is changing from that of a stationary to a 
growing population. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the annual growth in 
the labor force will be about 5,000,000, of which 4,000,000 will be located 
in the rural and 1,000,000 in the urban areas. The 1962 goal announced in 
September 1956 provided for an increase in workers and staff in government 
and state-controlled enterprises from 24,000,000 in 1957 to 30,000,000-
31,000,060 in 1962, although this goal may have been increased somewhat as 
a result of the subsequent adjustments in the plan emphasizing labor-intensive 
rather than capital-intensive projects. Other non-farm employment is expected 
to increase but little; thus about three-quarters of the 25,000,000 increase 
in the labor force will have to be absorbed in agriculture.

The 1962 goals announced in September 1956 provided for increases of 
25-30 percent in average wages and in total peasant income, which apparently 
would alloW_for per capita consumption increases at slightly greater rates 
claimed 
than/in 1953-57. However, agricultural targets have since been lowered, and 
are still believed to be unrealistically high. Thus it is estimated that at 
best peasant per capita output will rise by only eight to nine percent, a 
large part of which will be extracted by the regime for its own purposes. 
With the agricultural and consumer goods industry targets reduced, the margin 
for increa-s-ing consumption will be limited on a per capita basis to something 
like 1.5 percent annually. While wage-earners will probably be favored over 
peasants as in the past, rising peasant discontent or successful subversion 
of the regime's controls in the rural areas could alter the regime's 
allocation. 
3. Communist China in 1962. In 1962 Communist China will have been 
through a difficult period. More than 80 percent of its population will still 
be engaged in agriculture, which will have consolidated to a certain extent 
the collective revolution and will be in the throes of a technical revolution 
involving great changes in its cultivation practices. Peasant discontent 
will have been high throughout the period, reflecting rural resistance to 
change, little improvement in living standards, and the increased hazards to 
farm output from promoting new and untested cultivation practices. However, 
the regime will probably have improved its control over the collectives and 
devised means to enforce compliance with its directives. 
Industrial expansion will have been rapid, and by 1962 capital goods 
production will have more than doubled over 1957, providing a basis for a

-122-
very high rate. of investment and development. The expansion of consumer 
goods output, dependent on agricultural development, will be far less rapid, 
and will provide for little increase in living standards. Urban morale is 
likely to be low, with a minimal rise in living standards and diminishing 
prospects for advancement as the growth in urban employment slows down and 
positions are frozen in a stable bureaucracy. Student groups will probably 
be disillusioned over their prospects and restive. The problem of the "old" 
and "new" cadres will probably remain. In a period of social strains the 
regime will probably continue to maintain the politically reliable but un-
trained old cadres in their present leadership positions, while the colleges 
and high schools will provide several million new cadres to the labor force 
who will have little respect for the abilities of their superiors. 
By 1962, then, the regime will have greatly enlarged its industrial 
base at the cost of reduced political support and by resorting to harsher 
controls. Although this development is not likely to threaten the regime, 
it may tend to reduce the flexibility and effectiveness of its policies. 
However, the regimels long-run prospects maybe increasingly overshadowed by 
its population problem. It has only recently faced this question with some 
realism and is promising that despite a rural-based population and limited 
agricultural land resources, its policies of technical reforms in agriculture 
and of birth control will increase agricultural output at a faster rate than 
thejlopulation growth and will in several decades reduce population growth to 
manageable_proportions. By 1962 these claims will have had a partial test. 
If the prospects are unfavorable, they may have a corrosive effect on the 
unity and-self confidence of the Party.

C. Militart-
Chinese Communist military Policies over the next five years will 
continue to be shaped and influenced by the regime's aspirations for 
national strength and great power status. The regime will continue its 
present efforts to create a modern military establishment and will probably 
seek, with considerable success, to achieve greater self-sufficiency in 
the production of conventional weapons. However, it will continue to be 
dependent on the USSR for many military items, particularly for more 
complex equipment. 
Equally important is the fact that the Chinese Communists will 
undoubtedly continue to view the broader aspects of the Sino-Soviet alli-
ance as the major deterrent against external attack, particularly by the 
US, and as an essential element in Peiping's ability to project its power 
position into world affairs. This view was almost certainly underlined 
during the past year by demonstrations of Soviet weapons and scientific 
achievements, and by Peiping's clearer recognition of the role that 
nuclear weapons and missiles are likely to play in any future major mar. 
Nevertheless, Peiping will continue to emphasize a large and effective 
standing army. On the one hand, it cannot, duplicate the Soviet military 
pattern; while on the other hand, it probably believes that such an armed 
force will continue to be a decisive factor in any limited hostilities 
and that it will continue-to constitute an important psychological 
instrument against the non-Communist Asian states.

Levels of military expenditure projected under the second Five-
year Plan do not portend any sizable increase over present levels of 
military spending, and Peiping apparently intends to allocate most of the 
increase in domestic resources to its ambitious industrialization program. 
However, current levels of expenditure are sufficient to promote further 
strengthening of its military forces, and continued emphasis on the 
expansion of heavy industry will contribute to the improvement of military 
potentials. 
Chinese Communist aspirations for a great power status may eventu-
ally: impel the regime to develop some token evidence of nuclear capabili-
ties.. Peiping is developing a program of nuclear research, using Soviet 
equipment and technical assistance. However, in view of critical shortages 
of technical personnel and the competing demands of its industrialization 
program, Peiping is unlikely to carry out a program involving the large-
scale production of nuclear weapons. Over the next five years Communist 
China's indigenous nuclear capabilities will probably be largely confined 
to non-military uses of atomic energy, from which the regime can reap 
propaganda advantages. 
Peiping's efforts to modernize its armed forces may eventually 
produce a new generation of "technical" officers whose interests and out-
look are more purely military, and who ere less closely bound to the CCP. 
Such a development might tend to weaken party control over the armed 
forces. This, however, is unlikely-to become a serious problem during 
the next five .years. CCP leaders appear to be aware of this danger and 
will seek to maintain a tight .party control over the PLA. The percentage

of party and Youth League members in the armed forces will probably continue 
to be high, and the PLA will probably continue to be a well-indoctrinated 
group loyal to the regime. 
If present trends continue, the general quality and effectiveness 
of the PLA may gradually improve. The addition of better-educated younger 
4 
recruits to the PLA will facilitate training in modern weapons. 
The regime will continue its present efforts to develop a permanent 
military reserve. The development of such a reserve on a nationwide basis, 
coupled with the emergence of revised military concepts in bloc strategic 
thinking, may permit the regime to effect some reductions in the size of 
its regular armed forces.

D. Sino-Soviet Relations 
1. Objectives. During the next five years Peiping will almost cer-
tainly continue to believe that the military guarantees of the Sino-Soviet 
alliance constitute the principal deterrent against attack by the US. 
Peiping will continue to rely on the USSR and the bloc as its principal 
source of imports, aid, and technical assistance. Furthermore; Peiping 
will continue to share Moscow's ideology and view of history. Peiping's 
first objective in its relationship with the USSR will therefore be to 
maintain and strengthen the Sino-Soviet alliance and the bloc as a mili-
tary, diplomatic, and economic force in order that the bloc might fulfill 
what Peiping believes to be its historic destiny and in order to maximize 
bloc assistance for Peiping's domestic program. 
On certain issues Peiping's objectives may differ somewhat from 
those of the USSR despite the identity of long-range interests and Objec-
tives. Peiping's interests are more immediately involved than those of 
Moscow in certain Asian questions, particularly the status of Taiwan; on 
these issues Peiping may therefore take a more adamant stand than the 
USSR. Similarly, Peiping may make demands for its domestic economic 
program that Moscow could meet only at some expense to its own economy; 
In these cases differences could arise in spite of probable Sino-Soviet 
agreement on maximizing the economic strength of the bloc as a whole. 
Again, Moscow is more deeply involved in East European affairs and might 
in some cal-es believe that its authority must be imposed at whatever 
cost, while Peiping from its more detached viewpoint might feet that 
greater flexibility would strengthen the bloc vis-a-vis the non-Communist

world. In this connection Peiping will almost certainly wish to maintain 
its status of independence within the bloc, while Moscow probably does 
not view Chinese Communist independence as an end in itself but only as 
a contributing factor to the effectiveness of Sino-Soviet cooperation. 
However, in all such conflicts of objectives, both Peiping and tioscow 
will probably subordinate occasional differences to the wider interests 
of commonly held objectives and ideology. 
2. Probable Developments. Peiping will probably continue to play a 
role in the bloc second only to that of the USSR, and its recently in-
creased interest and influence in general bloc policies will probably be 
maintained. Chinese Communist foreign and domestic policies and state-
ments will, as they did in 1956-57, have considerable impact in other 
Communist regimes and movements. However, it is unlikely that Peiping 
will in the near future issue another ideological pronouncement that 
will arouse as much varied interest as the "contradictions" thesis. In 
fact, Peiping may attempt to minimize the international implications of 
its domestic activities in order not to appear to be undercutting Soviet 
leadership. 
The variations of objectives underlying the basic identity of 
Sino-Soviet interests will create occasional differences and disputes, 
such as arise in any alliance. Peiping and Moscow will make every 
effort, however, to prevent such problems from materially reducing the 
effectiveness of Sino-Soviet collaboration. The degree to which the 
efforts to subordinate disputes will succeed will depend in part upon 
the personal relationship of the Chinese Communist and Soviet leaderships

to each other. So long as Mao remains active, his seniority and tremen-
dous prestige will continue to permit Peiping to exercise considerable 
flexibility in accepting Soviet leadership without seeming to impair its 
independence; if Mao were replaced by lesser leaders, the problem of 
building prestige and gaining face might make Peiping a somewhat more 
difficult ally for the USSR. At the same time, however, lesser leaders 
in Peiping might be more dependent upon Soviet support in any domestic 
struggle and might therefore be more prepared to compromise 'on some 
issues with the USSR. Leadership developments in ,the USSR will similarly 
influence Sino-Soviet relations. If a delicate balance of political 
power should arise in the Kremlin, Peiping might exert some influence to 
tip the scale, despite the apparent Chinese Communist reluctance to be-
come involved in 3oviet internal politics. Furthermore, any leadership 
instability in the USSR that Peiping might interpret as a sign of Soviet 
weakness or indecision would make Peiping less prepared to follow the 
Soviet lead and more adamant in insisting on its own views and objectives. 
Among the problems in the Sino-Soviet relationship that are 
probably uppermost in immediate importance is that of economic relations. 
Peipingis receipts under Soviet loans have ceased and commitments to 
service loans obtained previously are now creating foreign exchange dif-
ficulties. It may attempt to obtain from the USSR an additional loan 
or at a minimum a postponement of service and repayment obligations for 
past loans. It is also conceivable that as Peiping's import require-
ments increase and its ability to increase certain exports, such as food-
stuffs, remains restricted, the USSR may be reluctant to supply in full 
Peiping's needs or accept in payment the exports Peiping has to offer.

Anotber-pressing problem likely to arise during the next five years 
is that of redefining the Sino-Soviet military relationship in the nuclear 
and missile age. Peiping will continue to be heavily dependent upon the 
USSR for military aid in conventional weapons and may in the next few 
years wish to acquire some capability in the missile and nuclear fields. 
The USSR would probably be reluctant to provide more than token quantities 
of modern weapons for Communist China, and would in any case seek to 
maintain more control over sach weapons than it has retained over con-
ventional arms. This might introduce an element of Soviet control in the 
Chinese military establishment that Peiping has so far avoided. 
Another problem in Sino-Soviet relations may involve the relation-
ship of Moscow and Peiping to the Asian bloc countries: Outer Mongolia) 
North Korea, and North Vietnam. Peiping's influence in each of these 
areas is substantial, although Soviet control remains predominant in 
Outer Mongolia and in North Korea. Outer Mongolia) North Vietnam, and 
North Kora are areas of traditional Chinese encroachment in which 
Peiping may have ambitions that conflict with Soviet interests. Peiping 
and Moscow appear to be cooperating in providing guidance and assistance 
to these countries, but this cooperation could, during the period of 
this estimate, assume increasingly competitive aspects, particularly if

movements. Although Peiping has made gestures such as the registration 
of "volunteers" for Egypt during the Suez crisis in 1956 and the grant-
ing of a loan to-Yemen in January 1958, the Chinese Communists have not 
attempted so far to match Soviet moves in the Middle East; in any events 
it has consistently declared its strong support of Soviet policies in 
the area. In the Far East and South Asia) Communist China, as an Asian 
state, has often been more effective than the USSR. In all of these 
cases; Peiping and Moscow appear to have exploited openings for increas-
ing Communist influence through aid, trade, and other tactics, without 
necessarily intending to abridge the influence of the other. However, 
with the continuing development of Sino-Soviet activities in the Asian-
African area, it is possible that conflicts may arise over spheres of 
influence or over the specific tactics to be followed. 
There has been much speculation concerning possible Sino-Soviet 
competition and disagreement in the ideological field. It is probable 
that during the next five years Peiping will maintain and possibly in-
crease its ideological stature within the world Communist movement. How-
ever, Peiping's pragmatism and flexibility that have in the past created 
differences between its approach and that of Moscow to ideological 
matters will also enable Peiping to adjust its formulations (as was done 
in Mao's";,..:eoret" speech) to minimize the disruptive effect on Sino-
Soviet relations.

ahead of the West in all respects, including international influence, in 
order to fulfill the destiny outlined for it by Marxism-Leninism. Thus 
even during its period of domestic preoccupation, the Chinese Communists, 
as dogmatic Communists, will be constantly and intensely conscious of their 
long-range world objectives, including the ultimate communization of all of 
Asia. The question of feasibility, rather than any weakening of desire or 
intent to achieve these objectives, will be the restraining element in 
Communist China foreign policy. It is this restraint which makes it 
unlikely that Peiping will resort to the use of military force as a 
principal-foreign policy tactic, barring a major shift in Soviet policy or 
.a softening of free world opposition. 
The US represents for Peiping the chief obstacle to the achievement 
of its short-term and long-range objectives. The effort to reduce US 
influence in Asia/ to weaken US determination to resist Communism in Asia, 
and to undermine US bilateral and multilateral security arrangements will 
therefore continue to be 'a dominant feature in PeipingPs policies during 
the next five years.

A concomitant short-t:enn. Chinese Communist objective is to increase 
its own influence, particularly in Asia and to a lesser extent in Africa, 
both by exploiting all possible opportunities with countries which have 
accepted it as a member of the Asian-African community Aand by seeking 
wider acceptance. Toward this end, the Chinese Communists will probably 
strive for the more limited objective of pro.Communist neutralism rather 
than demenaing more positive aliGnment with the bloc. Since the Chinese 
Communists undoubtedly reco3nize that Japan constitutes a power rival in 
Asia, they will make a stron3 effort to weaken Japan alignment with the 
West. They will also concentrate on relations with India, since an 
unfavorable policy shift by this leading Asian neutralist country could 
have serious repercussions for Peiping throughout the area. 
During the next five years it is probable that Peiping will also 
become more impatient to play the major role in international affairs 
outside of Asia to which it believes it is entitled. Accordingly, it may 
attempt to become more active on matters of broad international import, 
even if it does not secure entry into the UN. 
Elimination of the GRC will continue to be an important corollary 
to the objectives listed above. It is probable that the passage of time, 
even during the next five years, will accentuate rather than reduce 
Peiping's intention of removing this challenge to its international position, 
although the Chinese Communists will...grobably not resort to military 
.action against Taiwan so long as the US demonstrates a determination and 
ability to prevent a military seizure of the island.

2. Peiping's Tactics. There appears to be relatively little likelihood 
at preseht of a major shift in Chinese Communist tactics toward the 
.S2 
non-Communist world. During the next five years, Peiping will probably 
continue toemphasize non-military tactics, utilizing themes such as 
"peaceful coexistence" and "Asian solidarity't that are designed to extend 
Chinese Communist influence at the expense of the West. Peiping will 
co41nli to attempt to project an image of itself as a dynamic Asian country 
; 
rapidly solving its social and economic problems, but this effort will 
probably be hampered by the continuing necessity of relying on strict con-
trols rather than popular support. 
Peiping may attempt to negotiate with the West, particularly the US, 
over such issues as the status of Taiwan, Korea, or Indochina, but there 
is little prospect of a settlement of these issues and any concessions will 
be marginal, leaving unchanged the basic Chinese Communist hostility towai'd 
the West. 
A-reversion to Peiping's earlier tactic of military action and 
encouragement of insurrectionary activity by other Communist movements is 
unlikely tc tuke place unless Peiping comes to believe that Western and 
particu3av:Iy. US determination to resist Communism has been materially reduced, 
. - 
unless a major shift in bloc strategy should call for military or insur-
rectionary activity in the Far East, possibly for diversionary purposes, or 
unless Peiping came to believe that its vital interests or the existence of 
? ? 
a neighboring Communist regime could be preserved only through such activity. 
Despite the probable emphasis on "peaceful" activities, Peiping will 
attempt to exploit any opportunity for political or economic penetration

susceptible to its blandishments should adopt a lees neutral or less 
..4 ? e 
pro-American stand than heretofore, and it may in some cases resort to threats 
- 
and bluster to attain this end. Without abandoning its "peaceful" line, 
Peiping may for example attempt to force the UK and Japan to abandon what 
.1 
it interprets as support for a "two Chinas" situation. This tactic could 
lead to recurring crises over such questions as the status of Hong Kong or 
to difficulties in regard to Japanese fishing rights and. trade. Similarly, 
if Peiping _believed that it was making little Progress in arresting the 
trend toward development of a status2122 in the Taiwan Strait, it might re-

vert to a policy of periodic military action in the Straitl.including attacks 
on the smeller, less defended offshore islands, in an attempt to increase 
pressure on the GRC, the US, and the latter's allies, in order to keep the 
Taiwan issue alive and in a state of crisis just short, of major military 
action.

3. Probable Achievements. Through its various activities Peiping 
will probably be able, during the next five years, to increase its 
influence slightly in the non-Communist world through official and un-
official contacts, propaganda, and astute but necessarily limited appli-
cations of trade and economic aid. It is possible that several countries 
s? s 
which do-not recognize Peiping now may do so within the next five years, 
but most will refrain from recognizing Communist China while the latter 
? s 
is neither admitted to the UN nor recognized by the US. Peiping's 
principal sphere of action will be among the countries of Asia, although 
its activities in Africa and the Middle East will probably increase in 
4 
prominence in the course of the five-year period. 
. - 
In a period of less than a decade, the Chinese Communist regime 
has made substantial progress in extending its influence and making its 
impact felt in Asia and the world. It has gained recognition from 17 
non-Communist countries, fought the UN in Korea, participated in truce 
negotiations in Korea and in the Geneva conference on Korea and Indochina, 
gained acclaim at the Bandung Conference, and generally exerted its 
influence in much of Asia and Africa. However, much of this impact is 
attributable to factors which have already had their major effect on 
Communist China's status; such as the sudden emergence of a Communist 
China, itseconomic achievements, anti-colonialis.tsentiment in Asia, and 
the thee of Asian solidarity. These factors are still relevant, but 
the increments to Communist China's international position resulting 
- 
from these factors will not be as great as in the past. It is thus highly 
doubtful that Peiping will be able by its own efforts during the next five

years to approach its past record. Instead ;-:future improvements in its 
position will be increasingly dependent on overall Communist bloc achieve-
- 
ments. 
One of the problems facing Peiping in the next few years will be 
that of transforming "coexistence" into meaningful gains for Communism. 
, 
'rrom the Communist viewpoint the danger is thatprolonged coexistence 
may lead to widespread acceptance of the status gm (or, as Peiping puts 
it, of "two ChinaS") or even to stabilization of trouble spots, reducing 
the potential for Communist exploitation. It is doubtful that such gains 
? 
as Peiping can make through its own efforts during the next five years 
will solve this problem; the final outcome of which will be determined 
primarily by developments-in the broader aspects of the East-West struggle.

III. dUMMARY-AND CONCLUSIONS 
Present Situation. 
- 
1. The basic objectives of the Chinese Communist regime continue to 
be: a) to establish and maintain control over all territory which the 
Chinese Communists regard as having been under traditional Chinese control; 
b) to transform an underdeveloped country into a dynamic, industrialized 
state; c) to establish the social attitudes and institutional pattern of a 
communist society; d) to achieve a position of political, economic, and 
, 
military dominance in Asia and the status of an acknowledged world power; 
and e) to promote the objectives of the international Communist movement. 
2. The Chinese Communist Party, numbering about 12,750,000, continues 
. . 
to lie-alT effective-apparatus for controlling-the-country. -,Bbwever, certain 
internal party problems arising' from possible policy disagreements and 
queitions of reliability and efficiency among the rank-and-file members 
have hampered the implementation of some of the party's programs, and the 
leaders are currently engaged in a major effort to reinvigorate the party 
and government bureaucracy. 
3. Popular dissidence has increased over the last few years, 
particularly among the peasants, the students, the non-Communist intel-
lectuals, and the ethnic minorities. An effective public security apparatus, 
reinforced by a large and loyal military establishment, prevents dissidbnce---
from threatening the existence of the regime. The regime's attempt in 1957 
to devise a new method of eliciting a greater positive response from the 
people largely failed, forcing it to revert to orthodox control and indoc-
trination measures.

4. The regime yir-Oially cqmpleted the socialization of..agriculturel 
commerce, and industry during 1956apd 1957. It has claimed that 97 
? , 
percent of the peasants have been organized, nearly all in agricultural 
collectives. Private business has been's-17110st completely eliminated. 
Despite the initial success and relative ease of this tremendous trans-
, 
formation of Chinese society, it has been followed by a rise of popular 
dissatisfaction, particularly among the peasants. 
. - 
5. During the first Five-Year Plan the Chinese Communist economy 
exbanded rapidly, with an estimated average annual growth in its national 
income of seven to eight percent. Industrial output rose 133 percent with 
a three-fold increase, in capital goods and a rise of four-fifths in con-
., 
sumer goods. The increased industrial output was obtained largely from 
? 
the reconstruction and more intensive utilization of existing plant, . 
although a considerable investment was made in new plant which is to come 
? - 
into production In 1958-627 Farm output rose siepificantIy, although 
the increase was probably 15-20 percent rather than the 26 percent claimed 
by the resi.m. Wi1e developaent and technical improvements played a role 
In agricultural expansion, a large part probably reflected a recovery to 
pre-Wprld Wer II conditions.

, and workers rose from 10,000,000 to /1-1000,000'involving the nationali-
zation of 8,000,000-9,000A00' in private enterprise and a net increase 
of 5,000,000-6,000,000 wage-earners'. By the end Of 1957 nearly 97 percent 
of the 530,000,000 farm population were in collectives and most Of those 
producing handicrafts were in cooperatives. By 1957 the exPanded edu-
cational system provided formal training for about 80 percent of the 
children at the primary level, 12 percent at thelunior high level, three 
percent at the senior high and vocational level, and one percent at the 
college level. 
7. The regime successfully captured a large share of production 
increases for the support of its programs, and during 1953-57 both fiscal 
expenditures and total net investment approximately doubled.. Per capita 
consumption rose very little, if any, in rural areas, but possibly as much 
as four percent annually in urban areas. In the rural areas, crop controls 
and collectivization have led the peasants to regard themselves as much 
worse off, while -even in urban areas stringent rationing, crowded conditions, 
-and job dissatisfactions have let the people restive. 
8. The Chinese Communist leaders continue to view their close 
alliance with the Soviet Union as the keystone of their foreign policy. 
--Peipingss active participation in bloc matters during the last two years 
_ has increased its prestige and influence within the bloc; at the same time 
; 
the Chinese-Communists have strOngly reemphasized their support of the 
:11 
Jr 
principle of Soviet leadership of the bloc.

9. The .Peiping regime is.-recognized by 18. non-Communist countries, 14 
,having extended recognition during. the first year of the regime's existence. 
45 non-Communist states continue to. recognize the GRC. Despite the disparity 
in these figures, Communist China has achieved considerable: success, parti-
cularly in Asia, in portraying itself as .a dynamic country whose ,impact on 
World affairs will probably increase, although many .countries view this 
Prospect with concern. 
Future Trends, 
10. There are at present no identifiable trends.within Communist China 
which would indicate that the regime's physical control of the country will 
be effectively challenged during the next five years: However, in view of 
the regime's program, any increase in material or psych6logicalincentives ? 
granted to the people will necessarily be minimal. Thus some decrease in 
public support appears likely, which will tend to hamper the achievement of 
the regime's domestic objectives. 
U. The Communist Party will probably remain an effective apparatus 
-for controlling the country, but some decrease iniits ability to formulate 
and implement policies may occur as a result of morale problems among the' 
-? 
rank and file and possible disagreements among the leaders. If Mao dies, 
authority may pass temporarily to a collective group; but with.the loss or 
-Mao as a unifying factor, rivalry for power and policy disputes would proba-
bly grow with' considerablerapidity until power was seized by one man. These 
developments, coupled with :the loss of Mao's abilities and his domestic and 
-_-_international prestige, would appreciably weaken the party.

to 720 million, with three-quarters of the increase to be held in rural areas 
through control of population movements. By 1962 the degree of success the 
regime will achieve in slowing population growth through birth control and 
in increasing farm output through technological change is likely to influence 
its ponfidence and unity and be an important factor in shaping its future 
prospects. 
14. The regime's overall military po-Wntial will probably be increased 
r L4 ..aornization program, improved training, and a further development 
of the military-reserve system. Party control over the armed forces will 
continue to be strong. The regime may develop greater self-sufficiency in 
the production of conventional military weapons, but will continue to be 
dependent on the USSR for much of its heavy military egaipment and for nuclear 
or missile capabilities. 
15. The mutual dependence of Communist,China and the Soviet Union is so 
crucial to both countries that Peiping and Moscow will continue to,subordi-
nate any differences that may arise between them to the overriding consider-
ation of maintaining the doctrinal, political, economic, and military bonds 
which constitute their alliance. Commu4.st China will probably continue to 
exeroise the influence in bloc-wide mattets.which it has recently achieved. 
While-it will continue to defer to the Soviet Union on crucial questions of 
bloc policy, it will also continue to play a major role on questions of 
Communist policy in itsia. 
16. Barring any significant shift in Communist bloc strategy, it is 
unlikely ttlat Communist China will make-any major change in its foreign 
poliCk objectives or tactics. Its basic hostility to the US will remain,

and Peiping will attempt .to exploit what it apparently believes are elements 
? ?????? 
of weakness in US policy in Asia. Toward this end, it may intensify its 
, . 
efforts to convince other nations that it desires a rapprochement with the 
US, but marginal concessions that it might offer would exclude resolution 
of such basic issues as the status of Taiwan, Korea, and Vietnam. On the 
other hand, the? Peiping regime probably will not use military force to 
resolve these issues so long as it remains convinced that the US would react 
?, ?: 
effectively. However, Peiping is determined to keep the Taiwan situation 
4i 
from becoming frozen, and might step up military activity in the offshore 
island area to maintain fluidity and pressure. 
17. The Asian area will continue to be the major target of Communist 
? ? ? 
China's foreign policy activities, and its present tactics of stressing 
"peaceful coexistence" and "Asian solidarity" will probably be maintained. 
Communist China will probably become increasingly impatient to achieve a 
position where it can participate more actively in matters of broad inter-
,-
national import. Frustrated because its policies have not been more success-
ful in certain areas, there may be a trend toward a harder attitude toward 
? 
such countries as Japan and Britain, although Peiping will maintain a flexi-
- 
bility of approach in order to exploit all opportunities. 
18. Peiping may achieve some successes in increasing its influence and 
? . ? ? 
prestige, particularly in Asia and Africa. However, to a far larger extent 
than in the past, any change in Peiping's international position and its 
- 
impact on the international situation will be determined by course of 
the broad conflict between the Communist and non-Communist worlds. Communist

China will be a rtajor protagonist in this conflict and its action will thus 
influence the outcome, but Peiping's role in Asian and international affairs. 
will be increasingly dependent on factors which are not subject to Peiping's 
direct manipulation.
