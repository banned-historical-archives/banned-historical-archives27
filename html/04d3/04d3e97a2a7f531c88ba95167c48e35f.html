 "Political Connts on China's Economic Refaf't
 STAT
 The current climate in China favoring the expansion of foreign
 trade and increased direct foreign involvement in China's economic
 developnent''    W. 11 g  rx is intimately tied to the advance of
 policies in recent years associated with the Chinese Ccmmunast Party's
 (CCP) reform wing led by Vice Chairman Deng Xiaoping. Although Chinese
 -since /
 international economic acitivities increased steadily    the 1970's as
 China emerged from     its introverted preoccupation with the turbulent
 politics of the Cultural Revolution, the range and scale of Chinese
 economic interaction internationally increased dramatically in direct
 conjunction with the implementation of the whole range of reformist
 political, social and economic policies advanced by Deng:  eep
 Maintenance and improvements this climate favoring increased foreign
 economic delaings with China therefore rests finally on the overall
 stability and longevity of Deng 's overall reform program itself.
 The reform program advanced by Deng Xiaoping since the death of
 Mao Zedong covers the entire range of domestic policy. In addition to
 promoting the expansion of direct foreign trade, the Chinese leadership
 under Deng Xiaoping has  been increasingly ready to adopt foreign economic
 and business practices to facilitate trade, to acquire foreign technology
 for Chinese economic developnent, and to tolerate direct foreign invo ement
 in the Chinese'-domestic     through a variety ally                    of joint venture
 arrangements. 'E4bod` Beijing Is increased readiness to participate
 morel aggressively in the international economic community are the "special
 economic zones" established in recent years along the China coast as well
 as the designation of several more advanced regions in China'    to gear their
 economies directly toward the promotion of Chinese trade internationally.

 As has frequently been the case inJn the past when stress on

 Aeccanpar.-ing the broad variety of economic, social, institutional and
 cultural reforms undertaken by the Dengist leadership have been f
 political changes. With respect to the party itself Degn Xiaoping has attempted
 to reform the CCP into a more suitable instrument to       the rapid modernization
 of an increasingly complex Chinese society. The heart of these party reforms
 has been the process of "demaoification"--the reassertion of the ultimate
 political authority of the party organization itself in place of the formerly
 supreme authoirty of ciao Zedong and his thought--a.nd the regularization of
 party procedures and practices. Codes  f political conduct have been promulgated

 "leftist" principles and atttitudes that prevailed during the Cultural Revo-

 concept that the masses and their advanced political leaders are justified
 in "kicking aside" party and state leaderships and institutions which no
 longer represent their progressive interests and aims, Deng and his fellow
 reformers have promulgated a series of legal codes intended :dm to regulate
 political and social behavior which are appliable universally to party and
 state leaders as well as average Chinese citizen alike.
 In assessing the prospects for success and longterm longevity of the
 entire array of reforms advanced by Derg Xiaoping and likeminded reformers
 in China, three or four important points are worthy of note. First of all,
 e
 the various reforms Deng has put forward are coup '- entary. Taken together
 they comprise a mutually consistent package of policies and attitudes which
 reinforce each other. Deng 's various political, institutional and social
 reforms thus xdxm= are intended to serve the advance of the various
 eeoncmic reforms he and his colleagues have introduced, all with the
 aim of making China "a unbam powerful modern and socialist country" as
 rapidly as possible. Even PRC foreign policy under Deng's direction serves
 the same end : Chinese connections with the West-especially the United States ands--,
 not only serve the PRC's strategic needs but also further         Deng is s

 t''design for China ~s rapid modernization.
 Chinese leadership statements on Sine-U.S. and Sine-
 Japanese relations accordingly stress the complementary economic needs and assets
 each side holds for the other in bilateral ties alongside overriding strategic
 concerns in opposing the Soviet ffriior :ffAstrategy for China's economic development
 which placed less a premium on a role for advanced foreign technology, expertise
 more balance
 and capital Ix might accordingly fostera~?RC foreign policy which accentuates
 to a far lesser degree Chinese ties with the West.
 To the extent that Deng's reforms reinforce and serve each other, success
 on one policy front lends impetus toward success on other fronts. The normalization
 of Sine-Japanese and Sine American relations~.thus undoubtedly faVilitated the

 rapid implementation of Deng 's reforms in a deriestic political context
 increasingly favorable to him in the same year. The perception of success
 in agr cultural responsbility systems in     the years after 1979 undoubteldy
 prw oted their implementation in industry as well in 1981.
 By the same taken, ha,Tever, the internal coherexe of Deng's reforms
 likewise suggests that failure on one or more        policy fronts easily
 Econcrticj
 translates into setbacks on other reform fronts.  fficulties    brought on
 by the very success of Deng's reforms in 1980 thus appear to have been the
 primary factor in the political confusion among the Beijing leadership in
 the winter of 1980-$1, when Deng's surging political mai entum was effectively
 stalled and led most notably to the postponement of a series of fundamental
 reforms in party structure and leadership personnel arrangements. Similarly,
 tensions in Sino-  erican relations over the Taiwan question potentially
 undermine prospects for Deng's economic reforms to the extent that the Chinese
 leadership is ready to restrict the scale and scope of econcraic interaction

 the policies it includes
 The seond notable feature of Deng's reform package is tat
 olitically
 by and large here ical ? when viewed from the perspective of China's recent
 ad I
 history. The broad approach Deng's reform program   ke --employing broad
 united front tacitcs and subordinating considerations of political and
 ideological principle to the requirements of rapid economic development--
 -~ideological
 takes as its point ofv'depa`stu e-    political principles and attitudes
 embodied in the CCP's 8th Congress of 1956. That congress's policies and
 the leaders who advocated them were the focus of Mao Zedong's
 divergence frau much of the party's leadership in the years
 thereafter and of his antagonism during the Cultural Revolution years.
 Many of the specific reform policies advocated by Deng, moreover, were
 implemented or experimented with in the late 1950's and early 1960's

 and were excoriated during the Cultural Revolution. The agricultural
 responsbility systems, the expansion of sideline plots and the  proliferation
 of free markets m now presperirg as the hallmark of Dexgist agricultural
 reform, for example, were all introduced ar-        d   'early 1960's as
 a response to China's difficult economic situation in the wake of the great
 Leap Forward, and all were vilified during the Cultural Revolution as ;dm
 amounting to the reintroduction of capitalism into the Chinese countryside.
 To a very large extent, therefore, Deng Xiaoping's reform program amounts to
 a restoration of policies, attitudes and approaches to China's modernization
 which had been explicitly condemned for much of China's recent political past
 as violating the revolutionry principles and traditions on which the regime
 had been founded.
 The politically controversial lineage of marry of Deng Xiaoping's reforms
 naturally complicates their implementation by a party and state apparatus
 whose cadres retain vivid memories of the Cultural Revolution years. Chinese
 press commentary describes three types of cadre at lower levels of the party.
 One type of cadre continues to adhere to the "leftist" principles fostered
 during the Cutlrual Revolution years and therefore          believes the
 current reforms promoted by Deng Xiaoping to be "rightist" or "revisionist"
 and actively opposes their implementation. A second type of cadre firmly
 supports the current reform policies as politically and ideologically
 legitimate and accordingly works to implement them. Press commentary
 describing both of these types of party cadres =kmmoad claims flttly
 that both represent minorities among the pasty's lower levels. The third
 type of cadre, which such press commentary says constitute the overwhelming
 majority of the party's ranks, synpthatizes with the various reforms promoted
 by the central leadership under Deng Xiaoping's initiative but remains
 traumatized by their experiences during the Cultural Revolution. Ftecongi?.ing
 the controversial genealopZy of many of the reforms, therefore, these cadres

 hesitate to implement them, cautiously concerned that the current
 reformist atmosphere at the central level promoted under Deng's hegemony
 will dissipate in favor of more rigorously orthodox policy approaches
 and that they will be caught once again carrying out "rightist" policies.
 Chinese media accounts call this apprehension over the legitimacy of the
 reform policies "lingering fear," a debilitating political condition among
 ~y,r S
 cadres in the`pa ...  `s lower-level ranks which the press acknowledges
 persists today despite repeated efforts and assurances by the reformers
 to overcome it.
 A third factor complicating prospects for the success of Dengts reform
 program is the rising expectations $            of the Chinese public for
 direct)
 a larger share of the fruits of Chinese economic growth. The reformers
 themselves are responsible in large part for feu 7 ing these expectations.
 For one thing, steps to increase wages of various// categories of workers
 `productivity/
 in the cities and to spur~ er  i^   through the use oonus systems and
 other material incentives, together with corresponding steps to increase
 the income of the peasants in the countryside, have contributed to populin
 expectations of increasing prosperity. Secondly an academic debate since 1979
 on the "aims of socialist production" by reform economists  arguing that
 economic production under socialism is to benefit the people's livelihood
 and discrednltting the alleged Maoist approach of "making the transition to
 socialism in poverty"-presaged a reorientation of priorities in Chinese
 industry tciard consumer rather than producer goods in the past three years.
 '         This reorientation toward lightindustries has been upheld despite
 the depressing effects, acknawledged explicitly in the Chinese press, on the
 ~t
 heavy instal sector this past year.
 i-npact/

 strikes the visitor     to the Chinese capital irnmediate  on arrival, and
 is a direct consequence +nf the nearly-placed emphasis of China's economic
 planners on producing textiles for consumer use. Many of the clothes worn
 by the average Beijing citizen are in fact made at home on sewing machines
 which PRC industry now struggles to produce in adequate quantit  en's and using
 patterns drawn freehand from fashion advertising appearing in magazines from
 the West and Hong Kong.
 In a context of persistent reform promises to raise average income to
 levels comparable with Chinese workers in Taiwan or Singapore by some year
 or another and to produce goods increasingly \o
 direct popular consiir tion,
 the reform wing of the CCP led by Deng is under clearcut pressure to succeed
 in its programs. The difficulties in meetings these promises has created
 eeconomic
 problems already and will undoubtedly do so again. When Deng's `reform program
 took a decided step backward in the winter of 1980-1981 as reformist enterprise

 acknaaledged the dangers of disappointing risiing popular expectations:
 ""In the past, due to our lack of understanding of and consideration
 for the national conditions and our failure to explain them properly,
 we made casual remarks and promises and drafted some impractical plans
 for future economic development-a-a  ough we were motivated by the
 fervent hope to make the country strong and the people happy-and we
 caused complaints and dispappointment among the people because these
 promises and plans did not materialize." (FBIS China Daily Report, January
 2, 1981).

 prospects for their success.
 Such disappointments might be more manageable if the party's prestige
 and general popular image were not already dirrmed. The CCP faces what its
 own paper PEOPLE'S DAILY has termed a '-crisis of confidence" in Chinese
 socialism, a belief x3k allegedly widespread nn ong China's population and

 life in China since the mid-1950's--has festered and ripened into iq= what
 the Beijing press acknowledges to be open apstasy among at least a ''small
 handful'' of party members and open disaffection from the party among wider
 sectors of Chinese society in recent years. In part Deng's (xan efforts to
 legitimz%e his reforms by asserting the fallibility of Mao Zedong of and
 of the party itself over the past two decades has accelerated this disaffection.
 In that regard more conservative menbers of the Beijing leadership who opposed
 Deng's de-maoification efforts have been proven at least partly correct in
 their contention that Deng's frank acknowledgement of Mao's and the CCP's
 left deviations would disrupt political "stability and unity" and thereby
 cripple the party's ability to lead and control. The most visibile mani-
 festation of the "crisis of confidence" was the outpouring of criticism of
 Mao and the party at "democracy way" in Beijing in 1979, although other
 symptoms of disatisfaction with the party--suc)h as the recent debate explaining
 the CCP's 20-year deviation to the left as a product of its agrarian origins-
 abound.
 Taken together the various factors outlined above present the reform
 leadership in China with a serious dilemma. On the one hand the party faces

 the           economic and social strains that seem to accompany the

 to wonder exactly what is the central leadership's policy and to hesitate

 Much of this wavering in broad economic orientation, to be sure, is
 the result of the central leadership attempttag to grapple with unanticipated
 effects and consequences of their own policies. The upsurge of econanie reform
 through 1980, for example, meant for many selected enterprises an increased

 the leadership's oscillations on how to deal with the various economic and
 social effects of the party's implementation of responsibility systems in
 the countryside. Press commentary since 1980 has thus regularly cited instances
 where the implementation of such agricultural reforms has gone too far.
 Thus sane districts are said to have not only assigned production quotas
 according to households within existing production treams but also proceeded
 actually to divide up land and distribute it among households. The devolution
 of the focus of agricultural production under the responsibility systems
 similarly has had predictable, but nonetheless - controversial social effects.

 such social effects has been a dramatic resurgence of clan activity, Acccampariying

 lorgstaxx1ing party injunctions against them and to call for aew efforts
 to build "socialist spiritual culture" to replace theme while persisting

 It seems indeed possible the Deng's reforms, once             alla:ed
 to gather a momentum of their own, will bec ane a fixed feature of China's
 economic and political scene. That point has not yet been reached, however,
 and those who see Dengist reform as an unstoppable tread proceeding toward
 inevitable success mighconsider the CCP leadersh..p's own PC modest assessment
 support J       .11
 of the           for its own reform program, reflected in a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 commnentator article on February 9th this year. According to the party paper:
 Judging by the actual ideological state of the people at present,
 among our tens of millions of cadres and party members and among the
 people as a whole, those who really believe firily that our country
 is indeed in a period of great change and development, who beleive
 fir*nly that our country surely will be able to change chaos to order
 v
 and from poverty to prosperi~~l t 1, and who consciousi          dedicate
 theaselves heroically to bringing about this change, are still
 relatively few. The great majority of people look forward to such
 a future, but they have worries on one kind or another: some people
 are skeptical, hesitant and wavering; and there are alo a very small
 number of people who are firmly opposed to this great change and
 development and who want retrogression and the overthrow of the
 present system and leadership." (FBIS China Daily Report, 10 Feb 82).
 Dengist reform in China, from the fundamental overhaul of the party's own
 institutions to the establishment of special economic zones to promote
 foreign economic intercourse, has a good start, but to judge by the political
 context in which it has been initiated, its ultimate success is by no means
 guaranteed.
