 The State of         Perspective
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 The USSR and the PRC in the past year have taken the first steps on
 the long road toward reducing bilateral tensions and establishing a
 political channel for resolving differences. The Chinese apparently
 believe that their economic modernization effort requires prolonged
 stability on the Sino-Soviet border and that reduced tensions would
 allow a diversion of resources from military to nonmilitary purposes.
 The Soviets clearly want to prevent any further erosion of their
 strategic position in the US-USSR-China triangle and, at this
 juncture, want to capitalize on Sino-US differences. Indeed, both
 sides have sufficient motivation to improve relations in view of their
 serious domestic problems and their current difficulties in dealing
 with the United States.
 The Soviets are conscious of China's recent efforts to increase
 contacts and reduce tensions and presumably want to encourage
 further movement in that direction. Several factors could hinder
 Soviet efforts to make significant concessions, but the two sides can
 be expected to make further progress toward a "normalization" of re-
 lations in the coming months. A full-scale rapprochement is highly
 unlikely, but the atmosphere will improve and contacts will expand.
 The Chinese View of Sino-Soviet Relations
 Chinese leaders remain suspicious of the USSR but want to explore
 prospects for easing tensions and to probe Soviet willingness to
 accommodate their demands on the basic issues that divide the two
 countries. This marks a substantial shift in Chinese tactics in dealing
 with the USSR since the invasion of Afghanistan

 China and the Soviet Union have agreed to increase trade with each
 other, and there is a chance they will agree to greater use of Soviet re-
 sources in reequipping China's industrial plants. We believe, how-
 ever, that China would refuse any Soviet offers to resume economic
 aid.
 Vietnam remains concerned that its position in Kampuchea could be
 undermined by the Sino-Soviet talks. The Soviet Union, while
 attempting to reassure the Vietnamese, does not want to exclude a
 possible accommodation with China and might consider lessening its
 support for Vietnam in the unlikely event that the Chinese offer
 something concrete in return. However, a Soviet withdrawal or
 reduction of military and economic aid would not compel Vietnam to
 withdraw its troops from Kampuchea

 Over the past year or so, the Soviets have expanded their military and
 security links with Managua and have tried to bolster Sandinista
 capabilities to cope with the growing insurgency. They have
 continued to rely on intermediaries in supplying most military
 equipment to Nicaragua, in part to avoid provoking stronger US
 countermeasures. Moscow has also continued to softpedal its direct
 commitment to Managua, but has stepped up efforts to rally
 international support for the pro-Soviet Sandinista regime.

 The Soviet economy grew by 2 percent in 1982; farm output improved
 while industrial growth continued to deteriorate. Andropov's efforts
 to boost labor productivity through his "disciplinary campaign"
 probably will lead to a more rapid growth in industrial output in the
 short term. This, together with average-to-good weather, could well
 boost GNP growth in 1983. The outlook in 1984 and beyond,
 however, will be clouded by continued shortages of industrial
 materials and transportation and smaller additions to the labor force.
 services
 A crackdown on workers to reduce shirking on the job has been a key
 element in General Secretary Andropov's strategy for stimulating a
 faltering economy. The discipline campaign seems to be boosting
 efficiency and production but it is likely to run out of steam if greater
 worker effort is not rewarded by an increase in consumer goods and
 Since the late 1970s the availability of quality foods-and some
 staples-in the USSR has stagnated or declined. The regime has
 taken measures to minimize the impact of shortages on worker
 morale and productivity, shifting the worst effects from workers to
 those in Soviet society less able to mount effective protest. The new
 leadership, like its predecessor, continues to count on a better
 agricultural performance to increase food supplies; however, there
 are signs that it is giving greater consideration to the alternative of
 price increases in state retail outlets to contain consumer demand.

 The State of
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 Perspective
 The USSR and the PRC in the past year have taken the first steps on the
 long road toward reducing bilateral tensions and establishing a political
 channel for resolving some outstanding differences. The Chinese apparent-
 ly believe that their economic modernization effort requires prolonged
 stability on the Sino-Soviet border and that reduced tensions would allow a
 diversion of resources from military to nonmilitary purposes. The Soviets
 clearly want to prevent any further erosion of their strategic position in the
 US-USSR-China triangle and, at this juncture, want to capitalize on Sino-
 US differences. Indeed, both sides have sufficient motivation to improve
 relations in view of their serious domestic problems and their current
 difficulties in dealing with the United States.
 Chinese demands for changes in Soviet border policies (both military and
 territorial), as well as conflicts over various third-party relations, should
 assure that any progress is limited and gradual. Nevertheless, Beijing's
 willingness to begin a dialogue with Moscow marks a substantial shift in
 tactics since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (see "China Views the
 USSR") and presages increased economic activity as well as additional
 high-level political contacts. Aleksandr Bovin's trip to Beijing last month
 could very well lead to a resurrection of border talks. Bovin has links to
 party Chief Andropov and was formerly associated with the party's Bloc
 Liaison Department.
 In "The View From Moscow," we note that the Soviets appear convinced
 that, since both Moscow and Beijing currently have a list of grievances
 against the United States, they have a common incentive to settle some of
 their differences in the near term. The Soviets may well conclude that
 further initiatives on their part will be needed to keep the Chinese engaged
 in a process that could eventually lead to an improvement in their
 relationship. Such initiatives could include the withdrawal of a division or
 so from the border or a thinning of various units in the area, a

 Secret
 demilitarization of disputed areas, or an acceptance of the main river
 channel as the border on the Amur and Ussuri Rivers. At the very least,
 some normalization of relations and easing of tensions can be expected, but
 an end to the Sino-Soviet geopolitical competition or a genuine rapproche-
 ment cannot.
 The most likely area for improved relations would be in broadened
 economic exchanges between the two states. In "Prospects for Improved
 Sino-Soviet Economic Relations," we assess the likelihood of increased
 bilateral trade and China's greater use of Soviet resources in reequipping
 its industrial establishment. The Soviets are the likely beneficiary of
 China's decision to reduce its emphasis on importing whole plants from
 Japan and the industrialized West. Beijing may also see merit in drawing
 upon technological areas in which the USSR is well advanced, such as
 basic petrochemical technology and techniques for discovering and process-
 ing nonferrous metal deposits. The recent lessening of political tensions
 should facilitate economic negotiations and allow for the introduction of
 greater amounts of Chinese consumer goods into the Soviet Far East as
 well as Soviet timber, fertilizer, and machinery into China.
 Progress is far less likely on Third World issues that separate Moscow and
 Beijing, such as Afghanistan and Kampuchea. In the article "Vietnam,
 Kampuchea, and the Sino-Soviet Talks," we record China's efforts to use
 the talks to maintain pressure on the Soviet-Vietnamese alliance. Although
 the Chinese will also keep pressing their case on the Soviet presence in
 Mongolia and Afghanistan, the Soviets probably will try to focus the talks
 on bilateral, territorial, and military issues.
 The slightest improvement in Sino-Soviet relations would be beneficial for
 both sides, allowing China to increase the price for future cooperation with
 the United States and offering the USSR a reduced sense of geopolitical
 encirclement. Any progress between the two powers would increase anxiety
 among other states in the region, particularly in Japan and South Korea
 where there would be greater interest in defense cooperation with the
 United States. Sino-Soviet hostility generally leas been beneficial to
 ASEAN states, and these states would be particularly concerned with a
 thaw that was accompanied by a worsening of relations between Beijing
 and Washington.

 Sino-Soviet Relations:
 The View From Moscow
 The first round of Sino-Soviet "consultations" in
 Beijing last October produced little in the way of
 substantive results, and the two sides apparently
 continued to talk past each other to a large extent
 during the recent talks in Moscow. They have suc-
 ceeded in easing tensions somewhat, if only by main-
 taining a dialogue and increasing trade and other
 nonpolitical contacts, but seem to have made little if
 any progress toward settling their main differences.
 The Soviets are conscious of how far forward the
 Chinese have moved over the past year, however, and
 presumably want to encourage further movement in
 that direction. The Soviets also are aware that a
 totally uncompromising stand on the key issues risks a
 breakdown in the talks or an international perception
 that there is a stalemate-outcomes that they want to
 avoid.
 The Current Stage
 The dialogue to date has improved the atmosphere,
 but the Chinese have made it clear that any more far-
 reaching improvement in the relationship will depend
 on Soviet willingness to make concessions on at least
 some of the key issues dividing the two countries. The
 Soviets, while suggesting some flexibility, have not
 taken any concrete steps toward meeting Beijing's
 demands on these points. Soviet troops are still en-
 gaged in the Afghan conflict, the USSR continues to
 support Vietnamese operations in Kampuchea, and
 the Soviet military buildup opposite China gives no
 sign of abating.
 Moscow is probably encouraged by China's expressed
 willingness to discuss specific areas of difference,
 rather than press for action on all grievances at once.
 Moscow also may be encouraged by the fact that
 Secretary of State Shultz's visit to Beijing in Febru-
 ary did not resolve the Taiwan issue and by recent
 Chinese criticism of US foreign policy. If such is the
 case, Moscow may well believe that Sino-Soviet ties
 are more open to improvement now than at any time
 during the past two decades.
 The main problem, from the Soviet standpoint, is to
 find a way to improve relations with China without
 jeopardizing other key interests. The Soviets have, to
 this end, insisted that any improvement in Sino-Soviet
 ties will not be at the expense of their allies. They
 have, at the same time, used an article in New Times
 on 14 January to urge a resumption of the border
 talks with China, which were last held in June 1978.
 A few well-informed Soviet figures-most notably,  25X1
 Izvestiya political commentator Aleksandr Bovin,
 who reportedly is a confidant of General Secretary
 Andropov-also have raised the possibility of mutual
 force reductions along the Sino-Soviet border.
 A key question is the extent to which the USSR feels
 any sense of urgency about improving relations with
 China. The most recent Soviet statements-public     25X1
 and private-suggest that the USSR will continue to
 move cautiously and will be satisfied if it can "nor-
 malize" relations with Beijing over the next few years.
 Soviet Objectives
 Moscow wants, first and foremost, to prevent any
 further erosion of its position in the US-USSR-China
 relationship. The Soviets clearly do not want antago-
 nism on "two fronts" at a time of a mounting US
 defense effort and ever-increasing economic problems
 at home. They may hope to lessen the possibility that
 China would enter a two-front war against the USSR
 in the event of a NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict.
 Moscow wants to exploit the deterioration in US-  25X1
 Chinese ties that has occurred over the past year. The
 Soviets may think that an easing of Sino-Soviet
 tensions is encouraging Washington to question the
 wisdom of helping China to modernize its economy
 and defenses, and thus creating an environment in
 which Chinese disillusionment with the United States
 will continue. They certainly have long had an interest
 in persuading the United States that Sino-Soviet

 Soviet Forces
 The USSR has quadrupled its Ground and Air
 Forces opposite China since the mid-1960s while
 simultaneously modernizing these forces and improv-
 ing their logistic infrastructure. Soviet ground forces
 in the area now number approximately 435,000 men
 in 48 combat divisions-over 25 percent of the total
 manpower of the Ground Forces (see map). The
 Soviet armed forces and the KGB Border Troops
 together have between 600,000 and 700,000 men
 opposite China. The modernization of these forces
 has received new impetus since the early 1970s while
 the growth in the number of combat units has slowed.
 The number of tactical, fixed-wing combat aircraft
 opposite China has increased from about 220 in 1965
 to approximately 1,100 today. In addition, some 215
 medium or light bombers are assigned to the theater-
 level air army in that area. The main emphasis since
 the mid-1970s has been on the replacement of older
 tactical aircraft with new, more capable models. The
 number of attack, transport, and general purpose
 helicopters deployed along the border also has grown
 substantially from under 100 in 1965 to about
 1,200 at present
 Chinese Forces
 Despite cuts in defense spending and a reduction in
 the size of the Chinese armed forces, Beijing has
 steadily strengthened its defenses opposite the Soviet
 Union since 1979. China now stations nearly half of
 its ground and airforces-about 1.6 million men and
 some 2,700 combat aircraft-in the four military
 regions bordering the USSR and Mongolia.
 The current buildup has added new units and result-
 ed in a 30 percent increase in major weapons in the
 northern military regions. Most of this effort has
 been focused in the northeast, primarily in the Shen-
 yang Military Region. Improvements there include:
 ? Creation of three new local-force garrison divisions
 and one new tank division.
 ? Addition of armored regiments to eight garrison
 divisions.
 ? Addition of a mechanized infantry regiment to two
 main force divisions
 The Beijing and Lanzhou Military Regions have
 received less in the way of significant improvements,
 but the Urumqi Military Region in the northwest has
 received proportionately large quantities of new
 weapons. Urumqi defenses also have been strength-
 ened by:
 ? Moving an infantry division from Tibet to the
 capital.
 ? Adding a newly formed garrison division and main-
 force antiaircraft artillery division.
 ? Expanding two garrison units in the mountains west
 Recent military developments along the Sino-Soviet
 border include:
 ? The conversion of two motorized rifle divisions
 (MRDs) to tank divisions and the activation of a
 new MRD in the Far East Military District (MD).
 ? The introduction of T-72 tanks to Soviet forces
 along the border.
 ? The creation of new army- and corps-level com-
 mands opposite China.
 ? The reequipment of Soviet ground attack regiments
 with SU-17 Fitter and MIG-27 Flogger fighter-
 bombers and the SU-24 Fencer light bomber.

 relations are not frozen-if only to make the United
 States less confident about taking strong, anti-Soviet
 stands elsewhere in the world.
 Moscow probably is also hoping for an easing of
 Chinese hostility toward the USSR on a wide range of
 international issues, particularly on Afghanistan and
 Vietnam. Even a partial thaw with China could ease
 the pressure on the USSR's allies in Asia and reduce
 the danger of a US-China-Japan alliance in the Far
 East-a prospect that troubles the Soviets greatly. It
 also could allow the Soviets to shift some military
 resources in the Far East.
 Possible Soviet Concessions
 The Soviets have already had some success in improv-
 ing Sino-Soviet atmospherics without paying any
 price. Further improvement could require that they
 advance their positions in at least one of the areas
 discussed below.
 Soviet Forces Opposite China. The Soviet military
 buildup in the Far East is a major Chinese concern.
 We do not rule out the possibility of a unilateral
 Soviet move such as the withdrawal of a division or so
 from the border or a thinning of various Soviet units
 in the region. Even such token gestures, however,
 probably would be highly controversial within the
 Soviet leadership. The military remains deeply con-
 cerned about the vulnerability of the USSR's long and
 exposed eastern frontier, and many civilian leaders
 probably have their own doubts that a unilateral
 gesture would bring anything in return.
 Soviet officials have, in fact, insisted that any military
 disengagement along the border must be a two-way
 process involving some Chinese concessions. They
 have told Western diplomats and other contacts that
 the USSR will not dismantle its bases near China
 without receiving more than just a few "promises"
 from Beijing. But several well-informed Soviets have,
 at the same time, suggested that negotiations could
 lead to significant troop cuts on both sides.
 Less dramatic and costly Soviet proposals could in-
 volve advance notification of military exercises in the
 area and acceptance of observers at those exercises.
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa has indicated in
 recent conversations with Western diplomats that the
 Soviets believe the two sides will eventually reach an
 agreement on such measures, which would be consist-
 ent with Soviet commitments on the USSR's western   25X1
 frontier. Moscow also could propose a new set of rules
 governing the activities of border troops along the
 frontier or limiting reconnaissance flights in that area.
 The Soviets have little room for maneuver on the
 Chinese demand for a complete military withdrawal
 from Mongolia. They regard their military presence
 there as an integral component of their policy toward
 China. They may also be concerned that lessened      25X1
 support for the regime in Ulaanbattar could give rise
 to political instability there. The deputy director of
 China's main institute for Soviet studies claims that
 Izvestiya commentator Bovin-while in Beijing in   25X1
 February-did, however, suggest that the Chinese
 and Mongolians sign a nonaggression treaty and hint
 that this could lead to a withdrawal of some Soviet
 troops. The Chinese responded that this was a step
 "they could not possibly undertake" while Soviet
 forces remain in Mongolia. In conversations with US
 officials, the Chinese continued to dodge direct ques-
 tions on whether the issues of Soviet troop withdraw-
 als from the Sino-Soviet border and Mongolia were
 linked.
 Press reports that progress has been made toward a
 mutual reduction of forces along the border remain
 unconfirmed. Bovin's reported comment on Mongolia,
 however, is another indication that Moscow plans
 some initiative on security issues. The Soviets could,    25X1
 for example, offer to withdraw a limited number of
 troops-possibly up to a division-in return for a
 Chinese pledge not to attack Mongolia or station
 troops closer to it.
 The Territorial Dispute. The immediate sticking
 point-from Moscow's perspective-has been the
 Chinese notion that the two sides should recognize
 that certain areas are in dispute, withdraw their
 military forces from those areas (all of which are in
 Soviet hands at present), and agree to return all
 territory that rightfully belongs to the other. If Bei-
 jing were to suggest some flexibility on those points,

 however, Moscow probably would be willing to do

 The Indochina Connection. Moscow does not regard
 its support for Vietnam as a subject for negotiation in
 bilateral talks with the Chinese but could temper its
 backing of Hanoi to some extent in an effort to
 placate Beijing. Moscow could curtail shipments of
 material to Vietnam or put added pressure on Hanoi
 to scale down its operations in Kampuchea. The
 Soviets also could try to help arrange a face-saving
 settlement, such as a coalition headed by Prince
 Sihanouk, but they have shown no inclination to do so

 Afghanistan. The Soviets have even less room for
 maneuver on the Afghan question. But they could
 make a few tactical concessions to meet Chinese
 demands on this issue-such as intensifying their
 professions of interest in a political settlement. They
 also could consider another token troop withdrawal.
 Such moves would only be gestures, but they might
 give Beijing a pretext for scaling down its criticism of
 Bilateral Contacts. Finally, Moscow is sure to push
 for a further expansion of mutally beneficial economic
 and cultural ties. Both sides seem optimistic about the
 prospects for trade, which according to the agreement
 signed on 10 March will increase by over 150 percent
 and reach approximately $800 million in 1983, the
 highest level since the early 1960s. Much of the
 increase reportedly will come from larger Soviet
 purchases of textiles, which Moscow may see as a
 means of encouraging Beijing's dispute with Wash-
 ington over restrictions on Chinese textile exports.
 Moscow also probably agreed to make a greater effort
 to fill Beijing's orders for timber, other raw materials,
 and chemicals-items the USSR has been able to sell
 for hard currency. Sino-Soviet trade would still be far
 below the 1982 level of US-Soviet ($3 billion) and
 Chinese-US ($5 billion) bilateral trade, however.

 Soviet Constraints
 Several factors could hinder the Soviet effort to
 improve relations-among them, an apparently per-
 sistent Soviet belief in "hangi$g tough" when dealing
 with Beijing. Kapitsa has told Western diplomats that
 the Chinese have moved forward only because the
 Soviets stood firm on key issues, especially on the
 matter of preconditions for talks. Soviet academicians
 have expressed the same notion in recent exchanges
 with US experts.
 The Soviets may also be reluctant to offer much in the
 way of concessions because they are not sure about
 the ability of the current leaders to deliver on any
 bargain
 uncertainty over
 Chinese internal political stability was inhibiting a
 Soviet decision on force reductions along the border
 with China. Then, too, the Soviets may fear that
 concessions on the key issues would only whet China's
 appetite for more.
 The Kremlin leaders are, in any event, well aware
 that any offer of a disengagement along the Sino-
 Soviet border must take into account the interests of
 the Soviet military. A decision to offer Beijing major
 concessions on the issue of troop cuts would, even in
 the best of circumstances, entail acrimonious debate
 in Moscow. Such a debate would be a particularly
 unattractive proposition for Andropov and other Sovi-
 et leaders at this time, because the support of the
 military is critical in any succession period.
 The Soviets would face several problems in working
 out a proposal for troop withdrawals-among them,
 the difficulty of comparing a modernized well-
 equipped Soviet division with a poorly equipped but
 manpower-rich Chinese division. Also, the Soviets
 would not want to leave strategic targets-the Trans-
 Siberian Railroad, for example-or major population
 centers near the Chinese border unprotected. The

 Siberian climate rules out moving Soviet troops too
 far from the border region, and shifting troops to
 areas nearer Japan-such as Sakhalin Island-would
 upset the Japanese.
 Recent signs of strains in relations between Washing-
 ton, Tokyo, and Beijing probably have strengthened
 the case of those in Moscow who argue there is no
 need to move fast. A desire to protect other equities in
 Asia-most notably, ties to Vietnam and India-
 would also argue against any attempts to achieve a
 sudden breakthrough with the Chinese.
 Soviet Prospects
 The Soviets are probably uncertain about just where
 the current Sino-Soviet dialogue will lead. We doubt
 that Moscow expects a full rapprochement with both
 sides cooperating on a wide variety of issues and
 treating each other as equals. The Soviets know that a
 legacy of mutual mistrust and suspicion on both sides
 will complicate any efforts in Moscow or Beijing to
 build a domestic consensus in favor of improved
 We believe the most that Moscow expects is a limited
 detente with China-a further relaxation of tensions,
 increase in bilateral contacts, and some movement on
 the border dispute and related security issues. The
 Soviets are, of course, mindful that this would require
 significant "give" on both sides-with Beijing scaling
 down its demands on Kampuchea, Afghanistan, and
 Soviet military deployments opposite China. A deci-
 sion to accommodate the Chinese on any of these
 points would, by the same token, be extremely contro-
 versial in Moscow. It could be portrayed as a contin-
 uation of Brezhnev's policy, however, and there are
 grounds for taking some risks, since a leader who
 could ameliorate the hostility with China would sig-
 nificantly enhance his own position in Moscow.
 The Soviets-in our view-are mindful of the dynam-
 ics of the negotiating process and of the extent to
 which a key variable here is the existence in both
 Moscow and Beijing of the "political will" to settle at
 least some of their basic differences. They may believe
 that, since both Moscow and Beijing have a list of

 Secret
 The Chinese View of
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 At the 12th Chinese Communist Party Congress last
 September, Hu Yaobang characterized Soviet policies
 as "grave threats to China's security." Moscow's
 efforts in the past two decades to play a major role in
 Asian affairs are seen as an attempt to deny China its
 rightful position as an Asian power and to surround it
 with Soviet clients. China views Soviet activities in
 Indochina, South Asia, and Mongolia as part of an
 effort to encircle it and regards termination of these
 activities as necessary for establishing good relations.
 This concern is intensified by the Soviet military
 buildup along the border, which is regarded as far in
 excess of what is needed for self-defense and as proof
 of Moscow's intentions to use the threat of military
 force to gain political objectives. In Chinese eyes, a
 major purpose of this buildup has been to coerce
 China into accepting both a border settlement on
 Soviet terms and the status of a Soviet client stateP
 Factors Influencing New Approach
 A number of factors have contributed to the recent
 shift in the way China deals with this threat. Beijing
 continues to regard the USSR with deep suspicion but
 has concluded that China's interests are served by an
 easing of tensions and by the development of contacts
 in a number of functional and technical areas. F_
 In the past two years China has adopted a more self-
 assertive policy and has distanced itself from the
 United States on some issues. As part of the process of
 dissociation from the United States, the Chinese have
 calculated that greater contacts with the Soviets will
 serve to demonstrate independence and freedom of
 maneuver. Moreover, they appear to have concluded
 that political and economic gains can be achieved in
 relations with both the United States and the USSR
 through a more nuanced policy toward the USSR,_
 Chinese commentary in recent years has pointed to
 growing domestic and foreign difficulties facing the
 USSR. A nearly stagnant economy, the Afghan mo-
 rass, and difficulties in Poland have been cited. This
 treatment of Soviet problems probably reflects a
 belief that, while the USSR has not become less
 threatening, it may have become somewhat more
 likely to accommodate Beijing's interests. Although
 recent Chinese statements do not suggest optimism
 that the new Soviet leadership will be more flexible,
 Beijing apparently considers it useful to maintain a
 forum where Soviet willingness to compromise can be
 explored during the transition period.
 Finally, Beijing probably has been impelled by a
 desire to reduce tensions with Moscow in order to
 pursue economic modernization in a more tranquil
 environment. A reduction of Sino-Soviet hostility
 25X1

 could enable the regime to devote fewer resources to
 defense and more to economic development.         25X1
 Chinese Objectives
 We believe that China is using its opening to the
 USSR to ease tensions and to show progress on the 25X1
 basic issues that divide them. Beijing used the first
 round of talks to press the USSR on these issues and
 in the process,
 did not
 25X1
 signal any flexi i ity.
 25X1
 Beijing tied cultural and other agreements
 25X1
 to Soviet concessions-a position we believe it will
 slowly move away from as the talks progress.
 It is in Beijing's interest to gain some alleviation of its
 security concerns, and the Chinese will be anxious to
 encourage any process that promises a tempering of
 the Soviet threat. Beijing, moreover, almost certainly
 recognizes that even small steps on the basic issues ?
 will require a willingness to meet the Soviet Union
 halfway. This willingness, however, will be limited by
 China's belief that it is Moscow's responsibility to
 remove these threats to Chinese security.
 We believe that the Chinese will not be wholly
 intransigent on this matter, but their concern over the
 Soviet threat will lead them to demand, at the least,

 Secret
 that the USSR take the first step in alleviating this
 concern.                                Beijing
 will "consider" troop withdrawals from border regions
 if the Soviets first agree to reduce the number of their
 forces along the border. We believe that Beijing will
 become more flexible on this issue over time if the
 USSR shows some willingness to accommodate Chi-
 nese positions.
 In adopting more flexible tactics in its dealings with
 the Soviet Union and in resuming talks Beijing has:
 ? Opened a channel to the Soviets that can be used
 during the transition period to probe for signs of
 change in Soviet policies.
 ? Demonstrated its own desire to ease frictions in
 order to concentrate on internal development.
 ? Gained a means of sowing discord between Moscow
 and Vietnam.
 ? Reminded the United States that China has the
 option of improving relations with Moscow.l
 Chinese commentary also suggests that Beijing be-
 lieves its interests are served in people-to-people con-
 tacts with Soviet citizens, presumably in terms of
 demonstrating the falsity of anti-Chinese propaganda.
 China also considers that a more flexible attitude
 toward the USSR will give it broader access to
 Moscow's East European clients and greater opportu-
 nities to disrupt ties between them and the Soviets.F_
 in the spring of 1982
 Deng Xiaoping believed that China should continue to
 oppose Soviet "hegemonism" but also should reduce
 tensions with Moscow. He observed that relaxing
 relations with the Soviet Union would be beneficial
 for Sino-US relations. In seeking both to ease tensions
 with the USSR and to remind the United States that
 China should not be taken for granted, Beijing has
 attempted to restructure its relations with both of the
 superpowers in a way that:
 ? Lessens the prospects for conflict with the USSR.
 ? Enables China to pursue economic gains from ties
 with the USSR.
 ? Maintains those aspects of relations with the United
 Chinese Expectations
 China expects to be able to manage its relations with
 the United States and the USSR in a way that
 demonstrates China's independent status and pre-
 serves the gains made through its opening to the
 West. Chinese statements suggest that, in the short
 term at least, Beijing believes that it will not have to
 choose between East and West and that the process of
 reducing tension with Moscow will move at a slow
 pace that will not cause a reaction that could restrict
 Chinese access to Western trade and financial institu-
 tions.
 China does not appear at this point to expect that its
 talks with the USSR will progress rapidly to a
 resolution of differences and has even stated that they
 probably will be "marathon." Beijing, nevertheless,
 clearly wants to position itself to take advantage of
 any changes that might occur in Soviet policy and has
 set in motion a process that could lead to substantial
 improvements in its security. Although China will be
 willing to make concessions in order to ease the Soviet
 threat, past Chinese negotiating behavior suggests
 that they are likely to be slow in coming and would be
 made to encourage greater Soviet concessions.
 Beijing appears to have used the first round of talks to
 present a set of tough initial negotiating positions. We
 believe that the Chinese recognize that the question of
 Soviet support for Vietnamese activities in Kampu-
 chea is a very difficult issue for Moscow to deal with
 and that their proposals for Vietnamese withdrawal
 from Kampuchea and Soviet withdrawal from
 Afghanistan will complicate negotiations
 As the talks progress, China may first seek partial
 solutions to these problems, and it may turn to the
 question of Soviet troops along the border in the hope
 that a bilateral issue will prove less intractable than
 those involving third parties. We believe that the
 minimum that Beijing will demand is a reduction of
 no less than 10 percent of the Soviet forces currently
 along the border. China would, we believe, be willing
 to agree to mutual force reductions to gain Soviet

 We believe that China will accept partial solutions to
 these problems, both for their own sake and for the
 momentum that they could create for further progress
 on these questions. At the same time, however, Beij-
 ing would consider that such solutions only partially
 eased its security concerns. To the extent that these
 solutions failed to satisfy its concerns, China would
 continue to regard the Soviet Union as a threat and
 would therefore limit the extent to which bilateral
 relations were improved.

 Prospects for Improved Sino-
 Soviet Economic Relations-
 We believe that efforts by China and the Soviet
 Union to improve relations will probably include
 broadened economic exchanges between the two
 states. Both sides have agreed to raise the level of
 trade, and there is a chance they will agree to greater
 use of Soviet resources in reequipping China's indus-
 trial establishment. Because of their earlier disap-
 pointing experiences with the Soviets, we believe that
 the Chinese will refuse any Soviet offers to resume
 economic assistance and that they will be even more
 sensitive to the presence of Soviet technicians in
 China than they now are to technicians from the
 developed states
 The Setting
 Economic relations have not been at issue either in
 last fall's talks or in the current round of Sino-Soviet
 consultations. Both Beijing and Moscow, however,
 appear to anticipate prolonged discussions, and in
 these circumstances they may agree to actions in the
 economic sphere that will symbolize their professed
 interest in improving the relationship. We believe that
 both sides, but China particularly, could gain econom-
 ic advantages by expanding trade and permitting an
 enlarged Soviet role in the Chinese industrialization
 effort.
 Sino-Soviet Trade
 The Sino-Soviet trade agreement was signed in Mos-
 cow on 10 March. The announcement of the agree-
 ment noted that trade between the two countries will
 "expand greatly," but did not specify by how much.
 Although China complained last fall of Soviet delays
 both in shipping exports and in accepting Chinese
 goods, total trade in 1982 reportedly reached the
 planned level of $300 million. Prior to the 1983 talks,
 the Chinese told an East European diplomat that they
 expected a 40-percent increase in annual trade-to
 about $420 million. This level would still be well
 below the levels that existed before 1981, the low
 point for such exchanges (see table).

 trade-thus the potential for long-term expansion is
 sizable. The present markets in the Soviet Far East
 for Chinese textiles and other consumer goods and in
 China for Soviet timber, fertilizer, and machinery
 provide ample room for expanding total trade to at
 least the 1980 level and, perhaps within a few years,
 to the $1 billion level. Soviet nonoil exports have faced
 sluggish markets throughout the world for the past
 few years, and the USSR clearly has the capabilities
 for greatly increasing its exports to China. We esti-
 mate that China could similarly increase its exports to
 the USSR without seriously affecting its sales to the
 non-Communist world.
 China's policy of maintaining an "open door" to
 imports from the developed countries has been repeat-
 edly affirmed over the past year. While Beijing will
 try to avoid any trade commitment to the USSR that
 might constrain its ability to increase its exports to the
 United States, Japan, and Western Europe, we be-
 lieve growing import restrictions on Chinese goods in
 those countries could make the Soviet market more
 attractive.

 A Greater Soviet Role in Chinese Industrialization?
 Since the Sino-Soviet break in 1960, Beijing has on
 several occasions refused Soviet offers for a resump-
 tion of economic and technical assistance. For exam-
 ple, during the talks in 1979, China was unreceptive
 to Soviet offers of increased trade and economic
 assistance. At that time, Chinese industrialization
 policies were heavily focused on importing large num-
 bers of complete plants and state-of-the-art technol-
 ogies from the West. Further, China had arranged
 some $30 billion in Western credits to help finance
 the effort. Beijing clearly viewed Soviet capabilities
 for providing advanced technologies as limited.F__
 megawatts and facilities for manufacturing such
 equipment-areas in which the USSR is among the
 world's leaders
 In sum, we believe that Sino-Soviet trade will pick up
 over the next few years and that there is a good
 chance that China will agree to import, at least
 selectively, Soviet machinery and equipment. Al-
 though such arrangements could be useful in China's
 industrialization, they will not play the major role as
 long as China continues to view its modernization as
 primarily a matter of learning from and eventually
 catching up with the technologically advanced coun-
 Changes in China's industrialization policies since
 mid-1981, however, have enlarged the possibilities for
 a Soviet role in Chinese modernization. First, Beijing
 has reduced its emphasis upon importing whole plants
 from Japan and the industrialized West and has
 placed greater emphasis on upgrading and reequip-
 ping its 400,000 industrial plants. While China has
 continued to import selected equipment and processes
 from developed countries, it has increasingly relied on
 its own domestic investment resources for upgrading
 plant and equipment. Second, Beijing now recognizes
 that reequipping these existing plants, including some
 200 major facilities originally built with Soviet assist-
 ance in the 1950s, does not require the latest technol-
 ogies to make them more productive. The Chinese
 may now believe that the Soviet Union can provide
 industrial processes and equipment which, while they
 may not be as advanced as those available in the
 West, could improve industrial performance without
 the expenditure of hard currency. Under these cir-
 cumstances, the Chinese might now be more receptive
 to a Soviet offer to modernize a number of plants built
 with Soviet help in the 1950s.
 Whether modernizing existing plants or planning new
 ones, Beijing may see merit in drawing upon Soviet
 techniques for discovering and processing nonferrous
 metal deposits, basic petrochemical technology-for
 example, polyethylene and polyester production ca-
 pacities, which are important to the expansion of
 China's synthetic fiber industry-and high-voltage
 (above 500 kilovolts) transmission technology. Given
 China's strong interest in developing its hydropower
 potential, we believe it might be interested in acquir-
 ing Soviet hydrogenerators with capacities above 500
 tries of the non-Communist world.
 The Question of Soviet Aid
 We doubt that a Soviet aid program would be part of
 an expanded economic relationship with China. Pre-
 sent Soviet programs are directed to supporting such
 client states as Vietnam, and Moscow offers few
 economic concessions even to its East European allies.
 Moreover, China's foreign payments position is now
 far stronger than it was in the 1950s, when a Soviet
 loan of $1.4 billion provided the backbone of Chinese
 economic development, and China can readily pay for
 Soviet imports through exports. More important,
 Beijing would want to avoid any arrangement that
 could revive memories of the dependency marking
 earlier relations with Moscow. The Chinese leadership
 has for many years attributed a major part of its
 economic difficulties to the influence of Soviet eco-
 nomic doctrine in the 1950s and to the "perfidious"
 withdrawal of Soviet technicians and assistance in
 1960J
 Beijing's desire to minimize the appearance of
 dependency on the USSR and its continuing uneasi-
 ness over the presence of other foreign technicians
 now working in China will rule out the return of
 Soviet technicians on the scale of the 1950s (some
 2,000 Soviet technicians and advisers were withdrawn
 in the early 1960s). Nevertheless, almost any Chinese
 movement toward greater use of Soviet resources in
 the economic sphere will entail accepting a larger
 Soviet presence in China. This would be easier for the

 Vietnam, Kampuchea and
 the Sino-Soviet Talk
 Vietnam continues to show concern that its position in
 Kampuchea could be undermined by a Sino-Soviet
 accommodation despite Soviet assurances. Since late
 last year, top Vietnamese officials have exploited
 every occasion to ascertain Soviet attitudes toward the
 talks. Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Vo Dong
 Giang met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
 Mikhail Kapitsa in January to discuss Kampuchea
 and Soviet strategy for the second round of Sino-
 Soviet talks. One month later, after visiting some
 ASEAN states, Kapitsa stopped in Hanoi to reiterate
 Soviet support for Vietnam.-Earlier, in the annual
 Bolshevik Revolution anniversary speech, the CPSU
 promised to do all in its power to support Vietnam.
 Vietnam's senior leader, Le Duan, met with General
 Secretary Andropov on 23 December in an atmo-
 sphere of "complete mutual understanding," and a
 Vietnamese Communist Party secretary later said the
 USSR had promised that it would not discuss third-
 country interests in the Sino-Soviet talks.
 Vietnamese concerns are threefold. A Sino-Soviet
 accommodation that involved a cutback in Soviet
 military and economic aid to Vietnam would compli-
 cate Hanoi's efforts to control Kampuchea and would
 further strain the Vietnamese economy. We believe
 Vietnamese leaders also fear that loss of Soviet
 support would tip the military balance of power
 toward China, forcing Hanoi to deploy even more
 troops along its northern frontier and possibly increas-
 ing the risk of Chinese military action there.
 Vietnam in the Sino-Soviet Talks
 Although Moscow has sought to focus the Sino-Soviet
 talks primarily on bilateral issues, Beijing has seized
 upon them in part to try to divide Moscow from
 Hanoi. According to diplomatic               re-
 ports, China presented to the USSR in the opening
 round a plan on Kampuchea that included:
 ? Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampuchea as one
 condition for improved Chinese economic and cul-
 tural relations with the USSR.
 ? Chinese discussion of normalizing relations with
 Vietnam after "some regiments" have begun a
 phased withdrawal.
 ? An end to Hanoi's "anti-Chinese policies."
 ? UN-supervised elections for all Kampuchean fac-
 tions and international guarantees of Kampuchea's
 independence, neutrality, and nonalignment.F        25X1
 The USSR replied that it would not discuss issues
 involving third parties like Vietnam, and it has public-
 ly called the Kampuchean situation irreversible. Beij-
 ing probably calculated that it would be rebuffed, but
 it hoped to highlight Moscow's role in supporting
 Vietnamese aggression in Kampuchea. China might
 also hope to stir controversy within the Soviet leader-
 ship over the wisdom of continuing to support Viet-
 nam in policies that are expensive to Moscow both
 diplomatically and economically
 Near-Term Progress Unlikely
 China has offered little to the Soviets that would
 offset the present advantages they enjoy from their
 relationship with Vietnam. By bolstering Vietnam,
 the USSR diverts Chinese attention from the Soviet
 border and helps obstruct Chinese influence in South-
 east Asia. Soviet naval forces use Vietnamese facili-
 ties to support aerial surveillance and intelligence
 collection over the South China Sea and the western
 Pacific, as well as Soviet naval deployments in the
 Indian Ocean.

 Secret
 The Chinese at this time would be extremely reluctant
 to agree to a settlement in Indochina that recognized
 the primacy of the pro-Vietnam group in a Kampu-
 chean coalition government. On the political front,
 resistance to the Vietnamese occupation of Kampu-
 chea has allowed Beijing to find common cause with
 the five ASEAN nations, which historically have been
 more wary of Chinese than Soviet or Vietnamese
 intentions in Southeast Asia. ASEAN's support has
 provided the Chinese-backed, anti-Vietnamese resis-
 tance group in Kampuchea the international recogni-
 tion otherwise denied it and prevents Vietnam from
 consolidating its positions as a major regional power
 and virtual overlord of Indochina. Diplomatic reports
 indicate that the Chinese want to give the resistance
 groups time to strengthen their forces before they
 consider any negotiated solution in Kampuchea
 Even if Moscow and Beijing were to reach some form
 of agreement on Indochina, Hanoi probably would not
 cooperate-a fact that inhibits Soviet efforts to make
 any deal to which Hanoi might strongly object. As
 indicated in many public statements, the Vietnamese
 believe a client regime in Phnom Penh is necessary to
 their security. In our opinion, Hanoi believes that
 were Kampuchea not under Vietnamese control, it
 would fall under Chinese influence. Furthermore,
 Kampuchea is the only major policy success for the
 Vietnamese leadership since unification of Vietnam-
 one Hanoi is unlikely to let slip.
 Vietnamese Political and Military Options
 Should Hanoi sense some movement toward a Sino-
 Soviet accommodation further down the road, it has
 some military and political options of its own. It could
 stage a large-scale provocation along the Sino-
 Vietnamese border, the Thai-Kampuchean border, or
 among the South China Sea island groups that Hanoi
 disputes with Beijing. Such an action would be aimed
 at forcing the Soviets into supporting Vietnam.
 On the political front, Hanoi might try to prevent a
 Sino-Soviet arrangement on Kampuchea by initiating
 negotiations to create a coalition government between
 the Hanoi-backed Heng Samrin forces and the non-
 Communist resistance in Kampuchea-thus isolating
 If the Vietnamese were to face a total loss of Soviet
 military aid, they might sharply escalate their mili-
 tary activities in Kampuchea in an attempt to cripple
 the resistance before the supply pipeline closed. This
 would require the transfer of several divisions from
 the Chinese border. To be assured of success, the
 Vietnamese would also have to use air power-used
 only sparingly in the past-and mount extensive
 operations inside Thailand against supply caches,
 refugee concentrations, retreating guerrillas, and per-
 haps Thai military and administrative personnel. This
 scenario seems unlikely, however, since Hanoi knows
 that the Kampuchean resistance could be resupplied
 while Vietnam could end up weaker-and in a poor
 position to face US aid to Thailand if Thailand were
 drawn into the war by Vietnamese attacks.
 The Need for Aid
 Moscow's ability to influence Vietnam depends main-
 ly on the effectiveness of military and economic aid as
 a lever. Soviet data show that Moscow provided about
 $2.3 million per day in economic aid to Vietnam in
 1981-82. The costs of oil supplies-about 30,000
 barrels per day-and of the Soviet-financed grain
 shipments probably account for the bulk of this
 amount. In addition, some $2.2 billion of military
 equipment was shipped to Vietnam during 1979 and
 1980 to strengthen defenses against China and to
 supply Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea.
 Soviet reduction or elimination of military aid would
 have little immediate impact on Hanoi's military
 operations in Kampuchea. Vietnam has ample stock-
 piles of military equipment, and we believe the Viet-
 namese still have the capability to manufacture the
 small-arms ammunition necessary to maintain the
 effectiveness of their army-mostly light infantry-
 for several years. Over the longer haul, Vietnam's

 poor record of maintaining more sophisticated equip-

 would limit the military's flexibility. A Soviet aid
 cutoff would also, in time, erode the capabilities of the
 units assigned to the northern border against China,

 A cutoff or reduction of Soviet oil deliveries to
 Vietnam would have a more serious impact, particu-
 ~e estimate that the Vietnamese
 have a 30-day supply of fuel in Kampuchea. Once this
 was exhausted, the mobility of Vietnamese forces
 there would be sharply curtailed, and we would expect
 a slow but steady deterioration in the security situa-
 tion in the interior of the country. In addition, the
 Vietnamese would have to abandon the large-scale
 combined-arms operations employed successfully in
 the last dry season (November 1981 through May
 1982) along the Thai-Kampuchean border-but not
 repeated on the same scale this season. We believe,
 however, neither the loss of mobility nor the cutback
 in large operations would weaken the Vietnamese
 position enough over the short term to compel a
 withdrawal or reduction in forces
 Prospects
 The USSR has only limited options for trying to
 pursue reconciliation with China yet preserve an
 alliance with Vietnam. We believe Moscow will seek a
 middle course. It might reduce both military and
 economic aid, saying it was continuing to help Viet-
 nam defend itself and develop its economy rather than
 supporting the Kampuchean war effort. It might also
 launch new diplomatic efforts to resolve the Kampu-
 chean problem, rather than just endorsing Vietnamese
 proposals, and urge Hanoi to moderate criticism of
 China and to restrain military operations in Kampu-
 chea
 25X1
 25X1
 Such temporizing would probably satisfy neither Beij-
 ing nor Hanoi. Although Sino-Soviet relations might
 improve somewhat, the continued clash of Soviet and
 Chinese interests in Asia will reinforce Moscow's
 reasons for supporting Hanoi. The USSR probably
 also would be careful not be to seen as coercing or     25X1
 abandoning an ally because of the potential problems
 with other present or prospective clients. Nonetheless,
 so long as the USSR continues talks with China,
 Hanoi will worry about being sold out.F                 25X1 1

 Soviet Military Assistance
 and Support for Nicaragua
 The USSR gradually expanded its military and secu-
 rity role in Nicaragua in 1982 to help entrench the
 pro-Soviet Sandinista regime. During the year, mili-
 tary and security relations between the USSR and
 Nicaragua became closer and more formal, and Nica-
 raguan Defense Minister Ortega and Interior Minis-
 ter Borge visited Moscow for consultations.
 Military Deliveries
 The Soviets have for the most part continued to use
 Cuba and other third parties to supply military
 assistance to Nicaragua in order to avoid provoking
 US countermeasures against either Nicaragua or the
 USSR. Military equipment funneled through Cuba,
 Algeria, and other third parties in 1982 included 20
 T-54/55 tanks, 12 truck-mounted multiple rocket
 launchers, and one patrol boat. The rocket launchers
 and the patrol boat were sent from the USSR to
 Algeria and transshipped to Nicaragua
 In funneling arms through the Algerians and in some
 cases the Cubans, the Soviets have usually shipped
 equipment on their own carriers from the USSR to
 these countries. The equipment has then been re-
 loaded aboard Algerian and Cuban ships for transfer
 to Nicaragua
 One significant delivery in 1982, by a Bulgarian ship
 that arrived in Nicaragua in November, may be an
 exception to this pattern. The T-54/55 tanks involved
 may have been drawn from Bulgarian inventories, but
 in our judgment the delivery was almost certainly
 made at Soviet behest.
 Although the bulk of significant Soviet military
 equipment has come through these intermediaries, the
 Soviets have directly delivered MI-8 helicopters,
 AN-2 transport aircraft, and trucks. These deliveries,
 at least some of which originated in Leningrad, have
 been made at the port of Corinto on the Pacific coast.
 Corinto is the only Nicaraguan port capable of han-     25X1
 dling major oceangoing vessels. So far this year, the
 Soviets have delivered four armed MI-8 helicopters
 directly to Corinto and have shipped two AN-26
 transport aircraft to Cuba for eventual transshipment
 to Nicaragua.
 We estimate that Soviet military agreements with
 Nicaragua-including both direct and indirect ship-
 ments-totaled about $120 million through 1982. We
 believe most of these agreements were made in 1981
 and estimate that new agreements worth about $10
 million were made last year (see table for information    25X1
 on deliveries).

 distant problems, strain Washington's relations with

 Secret
 The Soviet Labor
 Discipline Campaign
 run out of gas.
 A crackdown on workers to reduce shirking on the job
 has been General Secretary Andropov's major initia-
 tive thus far to increase production and improve
 Soviet economic performance. The labor discipline
 campaign aims at punishing workers or depriving
 them of rewards because of absenteeism, tardiness,
 excessive job turnover, and alcoholism. The campaign
 was initially well received by the public and seems to
 be boosting production so far. If greater worker effort
 is not rewarded by an increase in consumer goods and
 services, however, the discipline campaign is likely to
 ity at the primary production level.
 Origins of the Campaign
 The discipline campaign is clearly a key element in
 Andropov's strategy for stimulating a faltering econo-
 my. His strategy began with the use of "administra-
 tive measures" to enforce discipline: "Although every-
 thing cannot be reduced to discipline," he said, "it is
 with discipline that we must begin, comrades." This
 tactic was intended to get laggards off the streets and
 back on the job. The regime hopes for a response in
 production large enough to provide incentives for
 boosting productivity. At the same time, Andropov is
 promoting two additional tactics designed to reinforce
 labor's commitment to better job performance: (1)
 linking wages and bonuses more directly to'production
 results and (2) granting more managerial responsibil-
 The keynote of the current campaign was Andropov's
 speech at the Central Committee plenum on 22 No-
 vember, in which he noted that poor performance
 should have "an immediate and unavoidable effect on
 the earnings, official status, and moral prestige of
 shoddy, inactive, and irresponsible workers." Since
 mid-December, when a Politburo meeting focused on
 letters from workers complaining about the lack of
 law and order and discipline, the campaign has picked
 up steam. At a meeting on 24 December, representa-
 tives of Moscow enterprises called for a reduction in
 absenteeism and turnover and demanded an increased
 use of firings to enforce labor discipline. That meeting
 has been followed by a daily barrage of articles,
 exhortations, and exposes in the central and regional
 press reinforcing these themes.
 While malingering workers are the prime targets for
 punishment, laggards in management-including par-
 ty, trade union, and enterprise authorities-are under
 pressure to shape up as well. For example, in late
 December, Pravda published an open letter from
 dissatisfied workers in a heavy construction enterprise
 to the Minister of Ferrous Metallurgy complaining
 about nondelivery of supplies and demanding im-
 proved performance by the Ferrous Metals Ministry.
 25X1
 The police reportedly have raided stores, restaurants,
 theaters, and public transportation to check docu-
 ments. These tactics appear to have been successful.
 Queues at shops are said to be shorter, and the US
 Embassy in Moscow reports having heard of numer-
 ous cases of workers being dismissed for being absent
 without leave.
 Popular Reaction
 Many Soviets have expressed satisfaction with the
 discipline campaign as something that is long overdue
 and will get the economy moving again. Indeed,
 IMEMO Deputy Director Ivanov noted that the
 campaign and followup Politburo meetings were
 touched off by an outpouring of workers' letters
 calling for such a crackdown. But even if the average
 Soviet worker puts in a larger share of the scheduled
 workweek on the factory floor, he still would not
 expect to work harder while he is there
 Because the Soviet system can implement coercion
 more quickly and easily than it can change en-
 trenched bureaucratic procedures, the labor discipline
 campaign runs the risk of being carried too far too
 fast. Indeed, in a manner typical of Soviet-style
 campaigns, the police have been heavyhanded and

 Secret
 indiscriminate in cracking down on absenteeism. A
 continuation of this tactic could foster an atmosphere
 of resentment and fear throughout the work force.
 Because of widespread use of shift work in industrial
 centers, many workers are on the streets during
 normal working hours. Such workers reportedly are
 becoming annoyed and frustrated by delays involved
 in waiting for document checks
 Perhaps recognizing that too much zeal in carrying
 out the discipline program could further alienate the
 work force, the Politburo, at a meeting in mid-
 January, evidently examined other measures to keep
 workers on the job. The Council of Ministers issued a
 resolution providing flexible work hours for the serv-
 ice sector and expanding consumer services such as
 shoe repairs, laundries, and retail food outlets at
 factories. This would reduce the pervasive pressures
 on workers to leave work for long stretches during the
 day to attend to personal business. The deadline set
 for implementation of this decree is 1 April 1983. The
 US Embassy in Moscow reports that a number of
 stores are already adopting evening hours in response
 to the resolution.
 Impact on Production
 The campaign seems to be boosting efficiency and
 production. East European diplomats have reported,
 for example, that the tempo of work in the Soviet
 institutions with which they do business has picked up
 markedly. Moreover, some of the nearly 6-percent
 increase in industrial production in January, com-
 pared with January 1982, may have been the result of
 better work habits. January 1982, however, was a
 particularly poor month for Soviet industry, and we
 have no way of determining how much of the January
 1983 rebound was due to tighter discipline.
 The intensity and harshness accompanying the cur-
 rent campaign represent a departure from behavior
 during the Brezhnev years. In the last major discipline
 campaign, in the winter of 1970, labor placement
 bureaus were supposedly given a greater role in
 controlling workers. Violators of labor discipline were
 to lose their bonuses for three months and were to be
 assigned to lower paid employment regardless of their
 qualifications. Unnamed leaders who failed to fulfill
 plans were reprimanded. But the police were not used,
 nor were there calls for firings as in the current
 campaign.
 The best the Soviets can probably hope for from the
 present campaign is a gain in production per worker
 corresponding to an increase in the hours actually
 worked. The payoff ends when downtime is reduced to
 the level dictated by machine breakdowns, interrup-
 tions in material supplies, and the like. This benefit
 could be offset by growing resentment if greater
 worker effort is not rewarded by an increase in the
 supply of consumer goods and services.
 The discipline campaign will have tough sledding for
 a variety of reasons. Until allocational priorities
 change there is little hope for large increases in the
 supply of consumer goods and services. Public toler-
 ance of a tough discipline drive, 30 years after Stalin,
 is likely to be tenuous and transitory. Moreover, in the
 current tight labor market, management will be reluc-
 tant to crack down on workers, who can easily quit
 and get jobs elsewhere, often at higher pay. Moreover,
 it has been standard managerial practice to hoard
 labor "reserves" to meet erratic work schedules or
 provide temporary help for the harvest from the pool
 of nonfarm workers. Finally, firing workers goes
 against the grain of Soviet society, which believes a
 worker has the right to a job, and even to the job he
 now holds.
 The campaign's aim of reducing excessive job turn-
 over will have a particularly heavy impact on young
 workers and could be counterproductive. In an era of
 a tightening labor market, geographical and intersec-
 toral mobility is at a premium. Workers under 30
 years of age are responsible for about 60 to 65 percent
 of all turnover, and 75 percent of those leaving their
 jobs have worked less than three years. Instead of
 arbitrarily curbing job turnover, some of the factors
 that contribute to high rates of turnover should be
 alleviated. These include dissatisfaction with working
 conditions (dangerous duty, boring work assignments,
 and erratic work schedules-frequent periods of idle-
 ness followed by episodes of "storming") and inade-
 quate living arrangements (poor housing and a lack of

 Soviets Recognize Limits
 Some Soviets recognize these points. Trade Union
 chairman Shalayev, while endorsing the need for
 greater discipline at the plenum held in January,
 seemed to stress the unions' role as defender of
 workers' interests by promoting incentives such as
 improved working conditions and greater use of the
 brigade system of labor organization. The chairman
 of the Metallurgical Industry Workers Union sup-
 ported this position, noting that violators of labor
 discipline "cannot be fired; they have families to be
 Several recent articles have suggested that improve-
 ments in economic management rather than harsh
 measures to change poor attitudes and habits among
 workers hold the key to higher productivity. V. Kosta-
 kov, a sector head at Gosplan's Institute for Economic
 Research, recently wrote in Literaturnaya gazeta that
 "it is necessary to infuse the struggle for strengthen-
 ing discipline with the understanding that we should
 have in mind the whole productive chain. This matter
 should not be reduced only to a struggle with idlers."
 Andropov himself, in his much publicized recent visit
 to a Moscow machine-tool factory, stressed the long-   25X1
 term nature of the task and collective responsibility in
 carrying it out, beginning at the ministerial level. He
 may have been signaling the police to back off
 somewhat by emphasizing the risks in getting bogged

 Two liberal economists were cautiously optimistic

 been more widely introduced, the economists noted
 that "we cannot simply uproot people and force them

 Secret
 Coping With    jhortages
 in the USSR
 Changes in food supplies are the Soviet citizen's
 leading barometer of his standard of living. Food
 accounts for the largest share of his family's budget,
 and shortages must be coped with on a daily basis.
 Since the late 1970s, after a decade of substantial
 improvement in the Soviet diet, three notable changes
 have occurred in the food supply:
 ? The per capita provision of most quality foods, as
 well as some staple foods, has stagnated or declined.
 ? A growing share of food in short supply is unavail-
 able for purchase by the general public but available
 through a variety of special distribution schemes.
 This has led to greater tautness in the supply of food
 in state-operated retail markets, making shortages
 appear worse than they are in the aggregate and
 leading to increased rationing.
 ? The quality of many food products has declined as
 farms and processing enterprises, in an effort to
 reach output targets, strive for quantity at the
 expense of standards.
 10 percent between 1979 and 1982.
 Meanwhile, prices for perishable foods in the collec-
 tive farm market, which vary according to supply and
 demand, rose in Moscow at an average annual rate of
 foods may be targeted for price increases this year
 In the face of pervasive consumer dissatisfaction, the
 regime has taken steps to limit the dangers. It is
 stressing measures that minimize the impact of food
 shortages on worker morale and productivity by shift-
 ing the worst effects from workers to those in Soviet
 society less able to mount effective protest. The
 leadership so far has stuck to its basic policies relating
 to food supply and demand, like its predecessor
 counting on a better agricultural performance to
 increase supplies. Some signs have appeared, however,
 that the Andropov regime is giving greater consider-
 ation to the alternative of price increases in state
 retail outlets to contain consumer demand. Selected
 Slower Growth in Food Supplies
 While Soviet citizens receive enough calories, the diet
 is inferior in nutritional quality and variety to that of
 developed Western countries and most East European
 countries. In the first 10 years of its tenure, the
 Brezhnev regime improved the bland and starchy diet.
 The consumption of starchy staples declined from 54
 percent of caloric intake in 1965 to 46 percent in
 1977, as quality foods such as meat and dairy prod-
 ucts became more available. Nevertheless, in 1977 the
 share of starchy staples in the Soviet diet was still
 twice as high as in the US diet; the share of meat and
 fish, less than half the US level. With more rubles in
 their pockets, consumers were eager for further ad-
 vances.
 With the exception of eggs, the per capita availability
 of various quality foods peaked in the late 1970s. In
 1982 per capita meat consumption was down 1 per-
 cent from its 1979 peak. In comparison with peak
 availability, 1981 consumption of milk products was
 down 5 percent; fish products, down 3 percent; and
 fruits, down 2 percent. Insult was added to injury as
 potatoes, "the second bread," became scarce in 1980
 and 1981 following disappointing harvests.
 Without increased food imports in recent years, the
 per capita availability of some major foods would
 have been several percent lower. The leadership may
 have decided, however, to hold the line on some
 imports last year. For example, the Soviet Union's
 purchases of meat declined by nearly 10 percent in
 1982 despite lower prices on world markets
 The evidence of a change for the worse in food
 supplies obtained from Soviet production statistics is
 confirmed by a special survey project carried out by
 the Soviet Area Audience and Opinion Research
 Division of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. In the

 The survey data point clearly to unevenness in food
 allocations, confirming earlier indications of a high
 correlation between city size and food availability: the
 smaller the city, the worse the food supply. In the
 survey period, supplies worsened more for smaller
 cities, leaving residents of cities under 100,000 bear-
 ing the brunt of the shortages (see table)
 worker morale and productivity.
 Special Distribution Systems
 The combination of stagnant or reduced output of
 quality foods, growth in per capita money incomes
 (some 3 to 4 percent a year since 1975), and stable
 prices in state-controlled retail outlets has led to
 excess demand for these foods. Thus far, Andropov
 appears to be following Brezhnev in not endorsing
 broad official price increases as a means of eliminat-
 ing the gap between food supply and demand. Rather,
 the leadership has been calling attention to past
 improvements and is promising to improve the long-
 run food supply through reorganization of the agricul-
 tural sector and associated branches of industry.
 Meanwhile, aware of the risk of civil unrest occa-
 sioned by food shortages and of the average worker's
 tendency to ask "So what if the world is wide when
 my shoe pinches," Moscow has taken more immediate
 steps to minimize the impact of food shortages upon
 Since the mid-1970s-but especially in the last two
 years-a system of special distribution of foodstuffs,
 considerably more extensive than the traditional spe-
 cial stores for selected elites, has been developed.
 Under the new approach, foodstuffs are made avail-
 able at the workplace. The public catering system, for
 example, has sharply increased its worker cafeteria
 operations. In many factories, trade union officials
 organize regular deliveries of foodstuffs prepacked
 according to individual order. In others, coupons,
 redeemable for supplies set aside in retail stores, are
 distributed. And on the eve of holidays, special food
 packages are distributed at numerous worksites.F_
 These systems originally developed out of local initia-
 tive-for example, that of enterprise managers who
 wished to improve productivity by cutting down on the
 common practice of workers leaving the workplace to
 shop. The special distribution practice is now so
 widespread that the Soviet press has dropped its
 former reticence about the subject. The nationally
 circulated labor newspaper Trud, for example, recent-
 ly described in glowing detail how 260 enterprises and
 institutions in Klaipeda, Lithuania, receive daily de-
 liveries of food packages based on workers' advance
 orders. According to the article, 100,000 people in this
 city of 185,000 are served through the special distri-      25X1
 bution system. However, as emigres from Klaipeda
 have reported, the stores serving the general public
 are generally left seriously undersupplied.
 According to recent Soviet statistics, the practice of
 organizing food sales at the workplace has undergone
 considerable expansion. From 1977 through 1981, the
 number of sites for distributing prepackaged food
 supplies at industrial enterprises and construction
 projects has increased 300 percent and their commod-
 ity turnover has increased 700 percent. A January
 1983 Council of Ministers decree ordered all types of
 consumer service enterprises to expand their opera-
 tions at factories and other workplaces.
 Food Quality
 Per capita daily protein consumption in the Soviet
 Union remains more than adequate for health needs,
 although it has dropped slightly since 1975, and the
 share drawn from animal sources has declined. Vita-     25X1
 min intake is not as satisfactory. According to studies
 of various categories of the population conducted by
 the Institute of Nutrition of the USSR Academy of
 Medical Sciences, consumption of vitamins is inade-
 quate, especially during winter and spring. The intake
 of vitamins C and A was singled out as particularly
 The problems with the structure and nutritional quali-
 ty of the diet have been accompanied by an erosion in
 the quality of individual foodstuffs. This is partly
 because the quality of some agricultural products has
 deteriorated in recent years, partly because increased
 transportation problems have led to more spoilage,   25X1
 and partly because of quality control problems in the
 food-processing industry. Some specifics:
 ? As the average weight of animals sold to the state
 for slaughter has dropped, the proportion of bone to
 meat in the animal carcass has risen and consumers

 are getting a higher proportion of bone in their meat
 purchases. Meanwhile, a disproportionately large
 share of quality cuts has been going into the special
 supply systems.
 mindful also of the role of food price increases in
 kindling worker unrest in Poland.
 Particularly since Andropov's rise to power, however,
 Moscow has become increasingly concerned about
 illegal economic activity and the official corruption it
 breeds, as well as the effects of drinking and low
 morale on labor productivity. An anticorruption cam-
 paign launched in the fall of 1981 is being taken up
 with new vigor, and the Andropov regime has made
 "poor labor discipline" (a code phrase for absentee-
 ism, turnover, and shoddy work) a major theme. But
 because poor worker performance and black marke-
 teering often reflect frustration over daily hardships,
 the regime has to tread a fine line between limiting
 illegal activity and adding to tension in the labor
 force. In recent weeks, observers have noted some
 improvements in state store food supplies; the new
 regime may be temporarily boosting deliveries by
 releasing state-held reserves to ease the introduction
 of the labor discipline campaign and to make a good
 ? Emigre complaints about watery milk are becoming
 increasingly common. Soviet statistics show that the
 fat content of milk sold to the state is down
 somewhat. Both emigres and the Soviet press have
 reported instances of farm workers and retail clerks
 diluting milk to meet output and sales targets.
 ? The fat content of butter has also dropped, but more
 sharply. The share of industrially produced butter
 with a low fat, high water content rose from roughly
 50 to 90 percent between 1974 and 1979.
 ? An increasing number of complaints in the Soviet
 press and by recent emigres indicates that the
 quality of bread and other baked goods is slipping.
 According to a recent article in Kommunist,
 "Alarming symptoms revealing the low quality of
 the bread baked in many republics and oblasts have
 appeared." In response, food industry officials cite
 the delivery of poor-quality flour from the milling
 industry, as well as a falling gluten content in
 wheat.
 Consumer Attitudes
 Although some unrest has occurred-such as short-
 lived work stoppages-consumers generally have lim-
 ited their expression of discontent to grumbling
 among friends. Consumers appear to be dealing with
 long queues in ways that do not directly threaten the
 regime-for example, through recourse to the much
 higher priced foods in the officially sanctioned collec-
 tive farm markets and through barter and black-
 market activity. The increasing distribution of food-
 stuffs at the workplace appears to have headed off
 protest among the most volatile segment of the popu-
 lation-large worker groups at industrial installa-
 tions. The group left most vulnerable, the nonworking
 elderly, presents little risk of violent protest.
 So far, Moscow has preferred to deal with the effects
 of repressed inflation rather than risk violent protest
 of the sort that food price increases helped, to provoke
 in the Soviet Union in 1962. The authorities are
 initial impression upon the populace.
 Policy Options
 The Andropov regime has endorsed the Brezhnev
 Food Program, which calls for increased output of
 quality foods over this decade. But the Food Program
 does not address several of the agricultural sector's
 systemic flaws, and there is resistance to some of its
 organizational aspects. A marked improvement in the
 supply of meat and other quality foods to the consum-
 er would require a greater increase in agricultural
 production (or in imports) than we see in prospect.
 Further shifts in the allocation of food, more ration-
 ing, slowing the growth of money income, and prom-
 ises of more quality foodstuffs can contribute little
 more to contain rising consumer demand. Moscow
 will have to consider other measures.
 The prices of staple foods were last officially in-
 creased in 1955, and those of quality foods in 1962.'
 ' Some food prices-especially for processed foods-have risen,
 however, due to pricing procedures which allow increases for
 product improvement. In practice, "improvements" often are non-
 existent, or marginal. This is one cause of consumer complaints
 about inflation. In addition, the prices of some so-called luxury
 foods-coffee and chocolate, for example-have been included in
 recent official price increases for categories of goods considered
 "nonessential.'

 Secret
 The population, however, is likely to view price in-
 creases as infringing an implicit social contract-in
 return for stable retail prices on essential goods, the
 populace puts up with low wages and few amenities.
 Popular displeasure, however, is likely to be propor-
 tional to the degree of price increases. We calculate
 that moderate price increases for livestock products
 would bring per capita purchasing power for these
 items back approximately to its 1975 level. If the
 regime raises prices gradually over a series of years
 and does not simultaneously provoke worker anger-
 by imposing sharply higher production quotas, for
 example-serious unrest could be avoided. The re-
 gime may test the waters this year by targeting a few
 foods for increases; recent evidence indicates veal and
 lamb prices may already have been raised.
 Some leadership waffling on the longstanding com-
 mitment to stable retail prices has appeared. A
 Pravda article last December on the waste of bread
 included reader letters advocating bread price hikes,
 and a contribution to the same article by the first
 deputy minister of the food industry lacked the usual
 promise of no price increases. In his well-publicized
 visit with Moscow factory workers in February, An-
 dropov left the door open to price hikes, saying that
 "the path of rising prices ... does not suit us as a
 general one, although, it must be said, we do have
 certain distortions and discrepancies in prices and we
 must eliminate them." Meanwhile, the regime may be
 hoping that the late 1981 price increases for a broad
 range of nonfood goods that pushed up the official
 price index for retail trade by 3 percent in 1982, along
 with some additional price increases on nonfood goods
 early this year, may have absorbed sufficient consum-
 er purchasing power to make broad food price hikes
 unnecessary for the time being.
