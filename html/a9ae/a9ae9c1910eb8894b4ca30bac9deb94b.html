 CHINA: New Foreign minister
 The standing committee of the National People's Con-
 gress, China's legislature, announced only one major personnel
 decision when it ended its three-day session yesterday.
 Former Chinese ambassador to the UN Huang Hua, who
 was recalled to Peking a few days ago, has replaced Chiao
 Kuan-hua as foreign minister. Huang is one of China's most
 seasoned diplomats and played an important role in the early
 stages of China's opening to the US. His appointment suggests
 that Peking does not plan any major departures from its current
 foreign policy line.  In fact, the announcement of the close of
 the session included a reference to continuation of Mao's
 revolutionary line on foreign affairs, a codeword for the opening
 to the US.
 The removal of former foreign minister Chiao Kuan-hua
 I            1              was apparently based on his domestic political attitude--he
 evidently was too strident in his criticism of ousted vice
 premier Teng Hsiao-ping--rather than on any unhappiness with
 his conduct of foreign policy.
 I     I The standing committee decided on other appointments
 to and removals from important government positions, but none
 was announced. These probably included the formal removal of
 the ousted leftist leader Chang Chun-chiao from his job as vice
 premier and the naming of new ministers of culture, education,
 and coal.
 I     I The meeting did not name a new premier. Party chair-
 man Hua                uo-feng continues to hold that title, and the leading
 candidate for the post, Li Hsien-nien, was identified as a vice
 premier. It is possible that strong supporters of former vice
 premier Teng Hsiao-ping--perhaps among them Defense Minister
 Yeh Chien-ying, the second most powerful man in China--are
 advocating that the job be kept in Hua's hands until Teng can
 be "rehabilitated" and step into it.
 Other than the opening speech by Politburo member Wu
 Te, none of the speeches or announcements made at the session
 referred to the need to continue to criticize Teng. His re-
 habilitation does not seem likely to occur soon  but is a
 strong possibility over the longer term.

 There was no announcement of a new chairman of the
 National People's Congress, a position that is equivalent to
 head of state. Filling this post could be a contentious issue.
 There are signs that some in the leadership, possibly led by
 ambitious military leader Chen Hsi-lien, would like Defense
 Minister Yeh Chien-ying to move up to the chairman's job,
 leaving the defense portfolio to Chen.
 I     I Yeh probably does not want to relinquish his control
 over the army. He and others in the leadership probably would
 prefer that the chairmanship go to Wu Te, a civilian and lead-
 ing candidate for the job. Wu, however, continues to be
 identified as a vice chairman.

 THAILAND:  Relations with Neighbors
 I Prospects for improved relations between Thailand
 an   i s Indochinese neighbors suffered a significant setback
 with the military takeover in Bangkok on October 6.
 I           IThe anti-communist, and specifically anti-Vietnamese,
 oric of the new Thai leaders, especially Prime Minister
 Thanin, sparked a vitriolic response from Hanoi that has con-
 tinued unabated. Vietnam continues to express concern that the
 return to military control will lead to a return of US military
 forces to Thailand, although the thrust of Vietnamese complaints
 in recent weeks has been the alleged mistreatment of Vietnam-
 ese residents and refugees in  Thailand.
 I             uIn spite of its rhetoric, however,  the Thai leader-
 ship has moved fairly quickly to try to halt the deterioration
 in relations.i

 I           Hanoi's reaction has been discouraging for Bangkok.
 There sti. l has been no answer to Thailand's diplomatic note
 on the August agreements, and the Thai offer to send a delega-
 tion to Hanoi to discuss the question of technical overflights--
 an issue that has been dragging on for several months--was
 turned down. Hanoi's excuse was that the Vietnamese are too
 busy preparing for a party congress this month.
 I            IThis may be true. Once the party congress is over,
 the Vietnamese may respond more positively to Thailand's ges-
 tures. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong has reaffirmed
 to foreign diplomats Vietnam's desire for normal relations with
 Thailand. There may be further delays, however, before the
 Vietnamese come around to a more reasonable exchange on out-
 standing practical issues.
 I Some of the basic issues that have long plagued Viet-
 nam-   ai relations--such as the repatriation of the Vietnamese
 in Thailand--are not likely to be resolved in the next few years
 and will be a continuing source of tension.  In the meantime,
 the Thai government may come under pressure from those who see
 such conciliatory gestures as demeaning, especially when the
 are met with apparent Vietnamese scorn.                                           25X1
 25X1                   A revived Gaullist party, elated by its success in
 the French by-elections last month, will elect Jacques Chirac
 as its president at a special convention on Sunday.

 The dynamic and ambitious former prime minister will
 then be a rival to President Giscard for leadership of the
 center-right, although both deny they are competitors. Giscard's
 popularity is at an all-time low, and the Gaullists are finding
 they have less and less in common with his policies.
 I           I The Gaullists have,  for example, recently resisted
 Giscard s efforts to push for ratification of the EC plan for
 direct elections to the European Parliament. They have also
 rejected his choice for a single progovernment candidate for
 Paris'  first election of a mayor next spring.
 I             The Gaullists view the by-elections as a per-
 sonal success for Chirac and a defeat for Giscard's Indepen-
 dent Republicans, who lost two out of the three seats they cam-
 paigned for and only narrowly captured the third. The Gaullists
 see this as proof that Chirac's strategy of direct confronta-
 tion with the left has more election potential than Giscard's
 unsuccessful attempts to win over certain leftists.
 The Gaullists are on the verge of an extensive re-
 structuring of their party at Chirac's behest. Although some
 of the Gaullist "barons" have reservations about Chirac's plans,
 only former prime minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas has set him-
 self up in complete opposition. Other "barons" disagree with
 some of the details but will probably go along.
 Partisans of Chirac's reforms dominate more than
 half of the party federations, and the convention is likely
 simply to ratify reforms--including a change of name and the
 replacement of the old executive bureau--that have already been
 agreed upon.
 Although Chirac's emergence as the new Gaullist
 leader will influence election maneuvering and introduce a new
 fluidity into French politics, the majority parties still have
 a common desire to defeat the left in the 1978 legislative elec-
 tion. There will be a strong trend toward polarization of the
 right as Chirac strives to attract new voters and assure the
 primacy of his party within the governing majority. An abrupt
 break is unlikely before the election.

 //The oil ministers' meeting, still officially set
 0 open on  ecember 15, probably will be postponed for five days
 to avoid conflict with the ministerial session of the Confer-
 ence on International Economic Cooperation scheduled to begin
 in Paris on December 15. The temporary delay would afford sev-
 eral oil ministers the opportunity to attend the CIEC and as-
 sess concessions by developed countries before deciding on the
 oil price increase. The delay would also avoid making CIEC a
 forum for criticism of an OPEC price decision.//

 purchase its oil, with the expectation that other OPEC countries
 would follow his lead.//

 prices throughout the oil consuming countries because the in-

 In order to maintain tactical flexibility and to
 so  en  - e break with past policy, party leader George Marchais
 has used unofficial spokesmen to float some of the leadership's
 more unorthodox ideas--for example, the proposition that French
 participation in NATO could make the left's ultimate accession
 to power in France "safer."  In addition, the party gave its
 candidates in the by-elections more freedom than it had ever
 permitted before in the hope that this would convince French
 voters that the Communists respect democratic practices.
 I             The new tactics have had mixed results.  In the first
 round ot the by-elections, the Communists held their own in
 one district, gained four percentage points in another, and
 lost almost as many points in each of the remaining five.  It
 was the Socialists, rather than the Communists, who attracted
 most of the new voters and some voters from the center and
 right.
 I      I In the two districts in which the Communists had
 secon -round candidates, party discipline among the leftist
 parties held and the Communists made a good showing.  In fact,
 the Communist candidate in the run-off in a Paris suburb at-
 tracted more than the combined first-round votes of the left
 and was only narrowly defeated. Although there were many local
 factors responsible, the close result confirms the growth of
 the party in some of the Paris suburbs--in part a result of the
 exodus of working-class voters from the high-cost central city

 not far from the truth.
 I             In most cases, however, the party is still getting
 its members from traditional sources--workers or families with
 a tradition of supporting the left--and adding strength in
 areas where it is already in the majority. The new members tend
 to be young, but they are also less disciplined and less re-
 ceptive to orthodox Marxist ideology, and probably more fickle
 in their voting.
 I             IThe party's new liberal line has not improved the
 image of Marchais, who has never been popular. A recent poll
 indicated that one year after frequent exposure to a noncom-
 bative Marchais on television and in press conferences, more
 than half of the French public still had an unfavorable impres-
 sion of him--a slightly higher number than a year earlier.
 I     I Whether or not the new approach represents a genuine
 evolution of French Communist views--40 to 50 percent of the
 French public do not believe it does--the party will probably
 continue its softer line in the period before the local elec-
 tions next year and the legislative election in 1978.
 It is unlikely that the party's election tactics will
 ring -1 =anything more than a marginal number of new voters.
 Just maintaining its strength in the face of both the Socialist
 challenge and shifting sociological patterns may turn out to be
 a considerable accomplishment. Even if their voting strength
 declines, however, the Communists stand to increase their
 participation in municipal governments through their alliance

 VENEZUELA: Oil Sales to Cuba
 During his recent visit to Moscow, President Carlos
 Andres    erez concluded an agreement in principle with the USSR
 for Venezuela to supply Cuba a small amount of its petroleum
 needs.
 Venezuela will initially sell Cuba 10,000 barrels per day
 of crude oil, about 8 percent of Cuba's crude requirements;  this
 amount will eventually double.
 I          uIn return, the USSR will supply a similar amount of
 petroleum to some of Venezuela's customers in Europe. The pro-
 posed deal would reduce transportation costs for the USSR, which
 would be able to shift to other uses a few of the 20 to 25 tank-
 ers now in the Cuban trade.
 Because of the difficulties in determining the per
 I arre   equivalence of Venezuelan and Soviet oil,  it may be some
 time before the agreement actually goes into effect.  Inability
 to overcome this problem scuttled a previous trilateral arrange-
 ment among Mexico, the USSR, and Cuba. For Venezuela, the agree-
 ment is largely a political gesture to both the USSR and Cuba.
 It will receive no economic advantage in its trade relations
 with either country.
 I             In Venezuela, the political impact of the arrangement
 with    e soviet Union will be minimal. The limited scope of the
 arrangement--in comparison with earlier reports that the swap
 would entail as much as 120,000 to 150,000 barrels per day of
 Venezuelan crude--may cause some surprise.
 Administration leaders will probably emphasize the
 positive aspects of the agreement: the potential for increasing
 Venezuelan influence in Cuba, diversification of Venezuela's
 petroleum export market, and the enhancement of Venezuelan in-
 fluence in the Caribbean region, an area that Venezuelan offi-
 cials have come increasingly to regard as a natural sphere of
 influence.

 POLAND: Personnel Changes
 Personnel changes announced yesterday in Warsaw are
 clearly intended to strengthen Gierek's hand in the party and
 the party's control over the government. The announcement im-
 mediately followed a central committee plenum and a session of
 parliament.
 Two Politburo members, Jan Szydlak and Jozef Kepa,
 were name  deputy premiers, auguring tighter party control over
 the economic bureaucracies. These moves to pack the government
 with proven party stalwarts probably reflect Gierek's reported
 conclusion that economic technocrats had increasingly escaped
 party control. He also blamed the technocrats in part for the
 fiasco over price increases last June.
 I            iSzydlak will have to give up his position on the party
 secretariat and Kepa his position as head of the Warsaw party
 organization.  In practical terms, however, the two men will be
 well situated to use their status as Politburo members to improve
 economic coordination and performance.
 I              Two new party secretaries were also announced. Stefan
 stows i resigned his position as foreign minister to assume
 the party position. This move appears to be a promotion. Alojzy
 Karkoszka comes to the secretariat from the Council of Ministers
 and will strengthen the party's direct control over investment.
 Both men are compatible with Gierek. Emil Wojtasek, a career
 diplomat, will be the new foreign minister.
