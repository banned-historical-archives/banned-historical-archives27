WASHINGTON,D.C. 20505 
Honorable Brent Scowcroft 
Assistant to the President 
for National Security Affairs 
The White House 
Washington, D. C. 20510 
Dear Brent: 
10 April 1976 
Enclosed is a summary of the position I am taking o 
current impasse involving termination payments under the 
program. Hopefully, I will be given an opportunity to present 
it to the Defense Subcommittee prior to the Easter recess. 
In that connection, if the occasion presents itself, it 
would be most helpful if the President could cover this matter 
with any of the members of the Subcommittee. (Membership list 
attached). 
We are in the process of pulling together from our field 
stations the total listing of all obligations involved. A 
detailed report on our finding will be transmitted as soon as 
possible. 
In the event I am unable to persuade the Subcommittee of 
the merits of our position, it may be necessary for the Admini-
stration to proceed without their approval. There appears to 
be no question of the legality of such action and it is imperative 
that we fulfill our obligations. 
I would welcome any suggestions on the attached draft. 
Sincerely, 
Enclosure

LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (UPI) -- REFUGEES ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE FIGHTING 
BETWEEN CUBAN-BACKED GOVERNMENT FORCES AND REBEL GUERRILLAS IN 
SOUTHERN ANGOLA ARE FLOODING INTO NEIGHBORING ZAMBIA, HOME AFFAIRS 
MINISTER AARON MILNER SAID TODAY. 
1 MILNER SAID NEARLY 16,000 BLACK ANGOLANS HAD FLED SOUTHERN ANGOLA 
SINCE FEBRUARY AND IF THEY CONTINUED TO ARRIVE SEEKING SHELTER, 
ZAMBIA COULD BE FACED WITH "A VERY SERIOUS REFUGEE PROBLEM." 
THIS MONTH, ABOUT 1,000 REFUGEES ARRIVED IN SOUTHERN ZAMBIA AND 
WERE TRANSFERRED TUESDAY TO THE MAKENI TRANSIT CAMP, SOUTH OF LUSAKA. 
AN ANGOLAN STUDENT, HUDSON PETEPEET, 21, TOLD REPORTERS WHO 
VISITED THE CAMP WEDNESDAY, "WE HAD TO FLEE BECAUSE FJGHTING IS STILL 
GOING ON IN OUR COUNTRY AND MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING." 
A GROUP OF ABOUT 700 BLACK TRIBESMEN FROM SOUTHERN ANGOLA FLED 
INTO SOUTH WEST AFRICA (NAMIBIA) THIS WEEK AND ALSO REPORTED 
CONTINUED CLASHES BETWEEN GOVERNMENT TROOPS AND GUERRILLAS OF THE 
NTIONAL UNION FOR THE TOTAL INDEPENDENCE OF ANGOLA. 
MORE THAN 8,000 REFUGEES HAVE BEEN HOUSED IN TENT CAMPS IN SOUTH 
WEST AFRICA IN THE PAST 10 MONTHS. 
SINCE FEBRUARY, UNITA GUERRILLAS HAVE BEEN FIGHTING A BUSH WAR IN 
SOUTHERN ANGOLA, WHERE THE GROUP HAS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AMONG THE 
RURAL POPULATION, AND HAS VOWED TO CONTINUE FIGHTING UNTIL CUBAN 
TROOPS AND RUSSIAN ADVISERS HAVE LEFT THE COUNTRY. 
uN/TA, WHICH HAD WESTERN BACKING IN THE ANGOLAN CIVIL WAR, WAS 
DEFEATED BY THE POPULAR MOVEMENT FOR THE LIBERATION OF ANGOLA FOR 
CONTROL OF THE GOVERNMENT FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF PORTUGESE 
FORCES. THE SOVIET ADVISERS AND THOUSANDS OF CUBAN TROOPS BACKED THE 
MPLA. 
PETEPEET SAID THE GOVERNMENT FORCES WERE USING ARMORED CARS, TANKS 
AND HEAVY MACHINE GUNS AGAINST NITA FIGHTERS, WHO ALSO HAD 
"SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS." 
ANOTHER REFUGEE, A FORMER CIVIL SERVANT FROM MAVINGA IN SOUTHERN 
ANGOLA, SAID HE AND MANY OTHERS HAD TRAVELED ON FOOT FOR HUNDREDS OF 
MILES TO REACH ZAMBIA. THE GROUP HE WAS WITH LIVED MAINLY OFF WILD 
FRUIT AND KEPT AWAY FROM VILLAGES. 
"WE HAD TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW WHICH VILLAGES 
SUPPORTED THE GOVERNMENT," HE SAID. "VE WERE FRIGHTENED ALL THE TIME 
OF BEING STOPPED AND TURNED OVER TO THE SOLDIERS."

First, the runway was very short; 
second, Texaco, which holds the fuel 
contract in Guyana, refused to sell the 
fuel. Cuba tried to resolve this by 
sending a shipload of gasoline to Gu-

WASHINGTON POST 
(PARADE) 9 JAN 1977 (10) 
iffm The Soviet 
Union has been 
trying for months to pur-
chase from Great Britain 
its most powerful aero-
engine, the Rolls-Royce 
RB-211, which provides, 
50,000 pounds of thrust to 
the jumbo jets. 
The Soviets are building 
their first wide-body 
airliner, the Ilyushin 86, 
which will seat 350 pas-
sengers, and they want to 
study the RB-211. 
The British are willing 
to sell a flock of the 
RB-211's to the Russians, 
but they want to control 
their production under 
license by the Soviets. 
They don't want to sell 
two or three and then have 
the Soviets pirate the 
engine with modifications. 
In 1947 the British 
Labor government under 
Clement Atlee made the 
mistake of selling 55 
Rolls-Royce Nene engines 
to the Soviets against the 
advice of its intelligence 
experts. The Soviets im-
mediately began reproduc-
ing the engine illegally 
for their fighter's sOd, 
bombers. It was *tette 
fighters and lOibers that. 
were subsequently sent to 
North Korea to fight 
against U.S. aircraft in 
the Korean war. 
The British are deter-
mined not to make the same 
mistake again. If they 
sell Rolls-Royce engines 
to the U.S.S.R., they want 
to provide substantial 
orders to the British air-
craft industry. Otherwise 
--no deal.

A Coup Against 
Mao's Memory 
HONG KONG?The struggle for 
power in Peking, apparently, had all the 
Ingredients of a Chinese opera. The par-
ticipants in the drama behaved more as 
If they were engaged in the petty in-
trigues of a bygone dynasty than in the 
power politics of a modern state. 
For an account of these fascinating 
events, we consulted Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger and some of his top ad-
visers. Then we flew to Hong Kong to 
talk to the China watchers on the scene. 
What appears to have happened, as 
we reported in an earlier dispatch, was 
a posthumous coup against Mao Tse-
tung. The old revolutionary was an un-
predictable ruler who periodically 
sought to purify his own government 
with disruptive, revolutionary cam-
Indfam 
The most chaotic was the Cultural 
Revolution of 1966, a confrontation be-
tween the Red Guards and the Old 
:lunch. Encouraged by Mao, young ide-
lists mocked and mobbed senior gov-
ernment leaders. Some of the most pow-
erful figures in China were subjected to 
public humiliation. Mao evidently 
thought this was good for their revolu-
tionary souls, but the experience report-
edly left them deeply embittered. 
Mao used similar tactics to hold the 
military down. In 1971, he accused the 
former defense minister, Lin Piao, of 
plotting his overthrow. The army com-
manders suffered a severe loss of public 
prestige. 
Thus, the senior bureaucrats and mili-
tary commanders were left to stew in 
private. They would later join forces 
after his death. But meanwhile, in sub-
tle ways characteristic of the Chinese, 
they resisted Mao's disruptions. They be-
lieved that practical policies and orderly 
development, rather than sheer ideolog-
ical zeal, would be best for China. 
By 1974, the bureaucrats had regained 
control of the government machinery. 
But Mao continued to crack the ideolog-
ical whip through his wife, Chiang 
Ching, who exercised rigid, stifling con-
trol of the nation's cultural activities. 
Some analysts believe the present Pe-
king line that the ambitious Chiang ma-
nipulated Mao. But our sources are con-

have left the government in the hands 
of the senior bureaucrats, including vic-

their sympathizers. Tong himself had 
been an ideological casualty.

Reports keep cropping up that the Castro 
government in Cuba would like to reduce its 
role in Angola and concentrate on solving 
severe economic difficulties at home. If this is 
true, the stage may soon be set for a resump-
tion Of efforts to normalize U.S. relations with 
Cuba. 
The two countries were edging cautiously 
toward negotiations until the Cuban dispatch 
of several thousand troops to Angola in the 
autumn of 1975, and Washington's understan-
dably stiff reaction stopped the movement in 
Its tracks. 
In the context of time and circumstances. 
the U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba and the 
attempt to isolate the Communist regime from 
normal contacts with other countries in the 
hemisphere made sense in the early 1960s. 
As time went on, however, it became ob-
vious that. the Castro government would not 
go away; that danger from Havana-supported 
guerrilla movements in other Latin American 
countries was fading, and that U.S. policies 
actually were forcing Cuba into an ever great-
er dependence on the Soviet Union. 
The Castro regime, for its part, could not es. 
cape the economic facts of life. The estrange. 
ment was denying Cuba advantageous access 
to American marketoand-Anierieratieclmoloo.

The first signs of a thaw came in 1972, when 
Washington and Havana negotiated an agreed 
ment providing for the extradition of Ameti. 
can skyjackers landing in Cuba. But the real 
breakthrough came in the first eight months 
of 1975. 
Premier Castro, on the occasion of a visit by 
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) and a party 
of U.S. newsmen, talked a tough line?but 
made it ummistakably clear that he would 
welcome better relations. In his words, "We 
wish friendship. We belong to two different 
worlds, but we are neighbors. One way or an-
other, we owe it to ourselves to live in peace."' 
Within weeks thereafter, the United States 
joined 15 other members of the Organization 
of American States in voting to remove the 
organization's collective sanctions against 
Cuba, and eased the restrictions on tales to 
Cuba by foreign subsidiaries of American 
'companies. 
Realists. didn't expect that normal trade and 
diplomatic ties would be restored overnight, 
but it did appear that the two governments 
were nearing direct negotiations. 
Then came the revelation that 15,000 or 
more Cuban troops had landed hi Angola to 
insure the victory of the Marxist-oriented, So-
viet-backed MPLA in that country's bloody, 
three-cornered power struggle. 
President Ford called Castro an "interna-
tional outlaw" for intervening in Angola, and 
warned that continued Cuban meddling in 
Puerto Rico would be considered an "un. 
friendly act." Castro called Ford a "vulgar 
liar," and announced his intention of extend-
ing military and political support to "progres-
sive" movements wherever and whenever he 
chose. 
In October, professing to believe that the 
United States was involved in the bombing of
