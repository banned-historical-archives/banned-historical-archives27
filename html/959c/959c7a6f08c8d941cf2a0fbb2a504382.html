				    	[Article  by  Raymond  Aron:    	"From  American  Imperialism  to  Soviet  Hegemonism"~
				    	~TextJ    	Some  30  years  ago,   	the  professor  of  international  relations  and  the
	     	-		     	man  in  the  street  pictured  the  world  in  about  the  same  way.    	The  professor
				    	used  scholarly  teYms  to  describe  the  system  of  relations  between  states  as
	     	.		     	a"bipolar"  system.    	The  man  in  the  street's  picture  focused  on  the  rivalry		   	_
				    	betweea  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union,  ~ot  without  underestimating
				    	the  overall  ecanomic  an~  military  superiority  of  the  maritime  power,   	the			  	-
				    	American  republic,  a  superiority  over  the  Euro-Asi.an  land  mass  cou~parable
				    	to  Great  Britain's  former  s~periarity  over  Europe.    	And  it  was  only  20
	    	~		     	years  agc  that  mankind  was  terrified  and  held  its  breath  when  KrushchPv
				    	issued  his  quasi-ultimatu~  on  Berlin   	(1958),  and  again  a  few  years  later			  	~
				    	(1962)  duriag  the  LCuban~  missile  crisis.
				    	Today,  professors  and  the  man  in  the  sr_reet  probably  agree,  but  no  longer
				    	on  a:~y  one  picture  of  the  world,    	If  anything,  they  would  both  consider  the
				    	world  too  difficult  to  picture  clearly  because  of  its  sheer  complexity.
				    	Should  the  Moscow-Peking-Washington  triangle  replace  the  Moscow-Washington
				    	duel?    	Which  of  the  duelists  now  ha.s  military  supremacy?    	Does  the  East-West		  	_
				    	conflict  still  have  the  global  significance  we  attributed  to  it  until  about
				    	the  early  1960's?
				    	Admittediy  cne  u~:ited  States  and  the  So~~iet  Union  continue  to  merit  the			   	=
	    	_				distinctive  position  they  have  assumed,  a  position  which  observers  admit
				    	they  have.    	They  are  the  only  nations  possessing  a  complete  arsenal  on
				    	land  and  sea,  in  air  and  space,  from  submachine  guns  to  megaton  bombs.			    	_
				    	They  alone  have  the  capability  of  pro~jecting  their  military  strength  to			   	-
				    	any  point  on  the  globe.    	They  alone  have  participat~d  in  the  conquest  of
				    	space.    	What  is  more,  from  now  until  the  end  of  the  century  they  will
				    	essentially  retain  this  duopoly,  regardless  of  what  progress  the  People's
				    	Republic  nf  China  may  make  during  the  next  20  years.
				    	Why  do  we  havF;  a  blurred  picture  of  the  world  instead  of  the  unduly  simple
	    	-				structure  of  the  cold  war?    	Keeping  to  the  e~sential  points,  here,  in  ~y

			 	1.    	The  confusion  in  distinguishing  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  Marxism-
				Leninism  which  transfigured  a  great  power  rivalry  into  ideological  warfare
				now  belongs  to   	the  past:    	the  so-called  socialist  bloc  has  shattered  into
				fragments.    	The  PRC  denounces   	Soviet  "hegemonism"  as  the  number-one  enemy.				 	-
	   	'	   	In  the  absence  of  Moscow,   	the  intelligentsia  could  dream  of  a  real  Mecca  in
				Belgrade  or  Havana,  with  Titc  or  Fidel  Castro  against  the  Stalinist  or
				capitalist  Goliath.  How  can  one  possibly  choose  between  North  Vietnam's
	   	-	   	quasi-Stalini.sm  and  Kampuchea's  ~uasi-ger.ocide?    	China  supgorts  Phnom  Penh
			 	because  Moscow  supports  ftanoi.    	Once  in  power,   	communist  parties  revive						-
	   	_	   	their  nations'  historic  quarrels.														   	-
			 	It  would  be  too  simple  to  eliminate  the  ideological  dimensiun  and  return  to
			 	the  chess  games  of  diplomacy.    	In  Asia,  both  empires,  Russian  and  Chinese,
				have  elevated  the  same  ideology  to  a"truth  of  state."    	They  accuse  each
	    	.	   	other  of  betraying  that  truth.    	In  so  doing,   	they  have  stripped  th~ir
				ma.neuvers,   	alliances,   	and  hostilities  of  all  ideological  garb:    	pure  and
				naked  power  politics  has  thus  emerged  frorn  the  terminology  that  once
				disguised  it,   	and  both  powers  are  now  unmasking  each  other.									-
			 	Elsewhere,   	it  is  an  altogether  different  story.    	The  victory  of  a  progressive
			 	or  Marxist-Leninist  party  does  not  necessarily  result  in  that  country's
				alinement  with  the  Soviet  bloc,  although  it  frequently  daes.    	Even  i^  the
			 	absence  of  such  alinement,   	the  new  regime  that  professes  to  be  socialist
	    	~	   	conducts  a  different  brand  of  diploma;,y  than  the  moderate  or  Fro-Western
			 	regime  it  overthrew.    	Entry  of  the  communist  party  into  the  government  of
			 	Paris  or  Rome  would  be  an  event  fraught  with  unpredictable  international
	    	-	   	consequences:    	any  extreme  interpretation--i.e.  a  disaster  or  a  brief					   	-
			 	episode--would  be  mentally  satisfyin~  but  would  present  the  real  facts  in				   	-

					  	establishment,   	Republicans  and  Democrats,  who  conceived  and  supported  the

				     	`    	that  yesterday's   	friends  no  longer  speak  to   	each  other.

		 	_			 	are  they  doing  with  it?    	tirhat  can  they  do  with  it?    	Is  inactive  force  real
			_			  	force?    	In  1950-53,   	the  United  States  was   	not  victorious  over  North  ~orea,
					   	that  half  of  a  co~zntry  saved  by  the  intervention  of  "volunteers,"  in  cther
					  	words,   	regular  PRC  troops.    	The  United  States  was  defeated  by  ~;orth  Vietnam,
					  	another  half  country,   	defeated   	in  the  sense  that  North  Vietnam  achieved  its
					  	goals  without,  however,  having  thereby  defeated  the  U.S.  expeditionary  force.
		 	-			  	Did  the  Soviet  Union  need  40,000  tanks  to  quell  the  Hungarian  revolt?    	To

					  	Diplomats  with  less  cynicism  than  Stalin--"the  Pope,  how  many  divisions
			-			  	does  he  have?"--never  forgot,   	in  their  negotiations  and  calculations,  how
		 	-			 	many  men  under  arms  each  ambassador  represented.    	Today,   	the  number  of
					  	special  embassy  counselors--cultural,   	scientific,   	commercial,  public  affairs--
					  	symbolizes   	total  diplomacy,   	illustrates  the  new  dimensions  of  diplomacy.
					  	4.    	These  conditions  give  rise,   	therefore,   	to  one  major  question:    	Where
		 	_			  	does   	the  essential  element  of  relations  between  states   	lie?    	On  the  one
					  	hand,   	it  lies  in  the  accumulation  of  weapons  and   	the  technical  advances
					  	made  in  nuclear  znd  nonnuclear  weapons;  on  the  other,   	in  national  economies		 	_
					  	operating  within  a  world  market.    	For  the  first  time  in  history,   	as  historians	  	_
		 	-			  	have  pointed  out,  a  world  market  does  not  extend  and  operate  inside  a  world
					  	empire.    	European  industry  depends  on  oil  from  the  Persian  Gulf.    	National
					  	or  multinational  firms  obtain  necessary  parts  for  their  machinery  from
					  	countries  where  wages  are  low.    	Our  relations  with  our  partners  in  the
					  	European  Community,  with  the  oil-praducing  countries,  wi.th  the  Soviet  Union
					   	and  Eastern  Europe  involve  commercial  exchanges  primarily,  and  intellectual		 	-
					  	or  artistic  exchanges  secondarily.    	Socialist  countries  do  not  fully  belong
					  	to  the  empire  of  u~erchants,   	but  they  are  linked  to  it  by  their  recourse  to
					  	private  bank  loans  with  which  to  finance  purchases  in  the  West.
					  	A  world  society,   	so  to  speak,   	consists  of  a  set  of  compl~x  international		     	-
			-			  	and  transnatio:~al  relations  as  much  as  or  more  than  traditional  diplomatic-
					  	strategic  relations.    	Ideas   	or  news  reports  cross  borders  and  go  around
					  	the  world  in  a  few  minutes.    	Technical  innovations  and  scientific  discoveries

			    	All  of  this  accounts   	for  tt~~e  diversity  of  images  from  which  professors  of

			    	more  complementary  than  incomgatible.    	I  shall  take  as  my  starting  point
		 	-	   	the  distinction  betwePn  the  system  of  relations  between  states,   	a  system
			    	governed  by  ttie  ratio  of  forces,  and  the  world  society  over  which  no  one

			     	positions  of  the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union  within  this   	system  of
			    	relations  and  this  world  society.    	Does   	the  relative  decline  of   	the  United
			     	States  mark  the  passage  from  American  imperialism  tc  Soviet  hegemonism?
			    	Arms  and  Diplomacy																		 	-
			    	Russian-American  rivalry  assumed  two  altogether  different  forms,  one  in
			    	Europe,   	the  other  in  the  rest  of  the  world.    	Here  in  Europe,   	two  coalitions
			    	gradually  took  shape,   	from  1947  to  1955,   	on  both  sides  of  the  demarcation
		 	-	   	line:    	the  Warsaw  Pact  and  the  Atlantic  Alliance.    	Borders  did  not  change				   	-
			    	and  neither  of   	the  two  coalitions  resorted  to  military  action  to  alter  them.
			     	In  Asia  and  the  Middle  East,   	these  two  superpoloer~s  acted  behind  the  scenes,
			    	if  not  on  the  scene,  but  their  troops  never  clashed  directly  on  the  battle-
			     	field.
			    	The  two  limited  wars  in  which  the  United  States  committed  an  expeditionary				 	=
			    	force  both  had  an  accidental  character.    	Stalin  would  probably  not  have
		  	_	   	~iven  Kim  I1-song  the  green  light  if  Washington's  diplomats  had   	let  it  be
			     	clearly  known  in  advance  that  the  United  States  would  not   	tolerate  the
			    	invasion  of  South  Korea  by  North  Korean  troops.    	Hostilities  would  not  have
			     	continued  for  3  years  if  Truman  had  heeded  the  Chinese  warnings   	India's
		  	-	  	ambassador  had  relayed  to  him.    	Likewise,   	the  United  States,  opposed  to  the
		  	-	  	return  of  the  French  to  Indochina,   	reversed  its  attitude  as  a  result  of						=
			    	Ma.o  Tse-Tung's  victory  in  China.    	After   	the  Geneva  Conference,   	the  United				   	_
		 	_	  	States  did  not  have  to  perpetuate  a  Korean-type  situation  in  Vietnam  under
			     	condition.s  far  more  unfavorable  than  in  Korea:    	unlike  the  South  Korea?n  armed			   	-
			     	Forces,   	the  South  Vietnamese  armed  force~  did  not  counterbalance  the  troops					f
			    	mobilized  by  the  other  half  of  the  country.
			    	Leaving  these  two  limited  wars  aside,   	the  system  of  relatir,ns  between  states
			    	ch~nged  as  a  result  of  decolonization,   	internal  uprisings,  and   	shifts  of				     	-
			    	allegiance  from  one  bloc  to  the  other.    	The  United  States  or.  the  Soviet  Union			   	-
			    	intervened  in  the  internal  politics  of  countries  and  between  countries,  but
			    	under  juridical  camouflage  that  was  impeccable  more  often  than  not.    	The
			    	United  Nations  Charter  does  not  prohibit  a  country  from  buying  arms  c4:  the				  	~
			    	outside  or  fram  requesting  aid  from  another  countr;?.    	The  United  States  aad
			     	the  Soviet  Union  have  responded  to  this   	type  of  request,  and  they  have					  	-
			    	withdrawn  their  advisers  and  troops  whenever  the  local  government  has  called			     	_
			    	upon  them  to  do  so.    	President  Sadat  obtained  the  withdrawal  of  Soviet
			    	advisers.    	Ethiopia's  revolutionary  regime  also  obtained  the  departure  of

							zmage  of  its  military  intervention  by  associating  its  Warsaw  Pact  allies  in
							the  operation.    	Except  for  the  crises  of  1956  and  1968,   	the  superpowers
							intervened  in  the  internal  affairs  of  other  countries  without  expressly

		     	_			 	advisers,   	covert  intervention  in  an  effort  to  destabilize  a  regime  by
							supporting  its  opposition  or  rebellious  ethnic  minorities.    	From  this   	stand-
							point,   	it  can  be  said  that  gunboat  diplamacy  has  gone  out  of  style.
							In  the  Middle  East,   	Israel  a.nd   	the  Arab  countries  have  waged  four  wars--1948,
							195b,   	1967,  and  1973   	(omitting  the  1970  war.  of  attrition)--ended  by  cease-
							fires  and  never  a  peace  treat,y�    	In  1956,   	France  and  Great  Britain  partici-
		    	~			 	pated  in  the  operations.    	Since  then,   	they  have  been  kept  out  of   	the
							negotiations  in  crisis  situations.    	Not  because  of  their  role  in  1956,   	but
							for  a  simpler  reason.    	When  countries  wage  wars  against  each  other,  the
							only  other  countries   	they  will   	listen  to  are  those  capable  of  mobilizing
		     	-			 	forces  in  the  theater  of  operations.    	In  1956,   	1967  and  1973,   	the  Russian-
							American  negotiations,   	conducted  in  the  background  of  the  United  Nations
							S~curity  Council  and  General  As~embly,  influenced  the  duration  of  the
							hostilities  and  the  tern~s  and  conditions  of  the  cease-fire.    	Russians  and
							Americans  refrained  from  any  direct  participation  in  the  fighting,   	thus
							enabling  the  Israelis   	to  win  victories  in  the  field.    	In  1973,  Y~owever,
		    	=			  	the  Russians   	first,  and  then  the  Americans,  resupplied  their  respective
							proteges  during  the  fighting.    	And  they  hastened  the  declaration  of  a
							cease-fi.re  in  order  to  save  an  Egyptian  azmy  surrounded  in  the  desert.
		     	-			  	In  a  simi.lar  crisis  when  the  Kramlin  seemed  to  be  about  to  dispatch  airborne
							divisions  to   	the  Middle  F.ast,  what  ratio  of  forces  determined  the  outcome  of
		    	-			  	the  test  of  wills?    	Was  it  the  ratio  of  forces  available  in  the  theater,  in

				 	missiles?    	Or  with  the  number  of  tanks  or  fighter  squadrons  on  each  side  of
				  	the  demarcation  line  in  Europe?    	On  the  surface,   	the  question  answers  itself,
				  	so  to  speak.    	The  liberation  movement  in  Mozambique  upheld  Marxist  or
				  	progressive  ideas.    	It  was  not  in  Moscow  but  in  our  European  unive-rsities
				  	that  Af rica's  liberators   	learned  their  ideology.    	A  progressive  movement  won			    	-
				  	in  Angola  because  the  U.S.  Congress  refused  to  appropriate  tl~e  funds  needed
				  	to  support  the  nonprogressive  liberation  movement.    	The  ratio  of  forces
				  	between  the  various  parties  inside  Ethiopia  and  Angola  does  not  depend  on
				  	the  overall  +ratio  of  forces  between  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  TJnited  States,
				  	but  on   	the  respective  capability  or  willingness  of  Westerners  and  Soviets				   	_
				  	to  help   	their  party.
				  	The  apparent  separation  between  the  ratio  of  local  forces  and  the  ratio  of
				  	global   	forces  of  the  two  superpowers  is  never  a  complete  one.    	The  interven-
		     	-	   	tions  in  Africa  by  Cuban  troops  presupposed  the  existence  in  the  Soviet  bloc
				  	oF  transport  aircraft,  a  series  of  air  bases,   	and  perraps  even  airborne
				  	aivisions  should  they  be  needed.    	In  the  Middle  East,   	the  Kremlin  tolerated
				  	the  Isr:~eli  victory  in  1967  and  was  reluctant  to  employ  its  airborne  divisions
				  	in  1973  because  of  U.S.   	power  as  much  as  because  of  regional  circumstances.
				  	In  the   	Cuban  crisis  in  the  fall  of  1962,   	all  the  advantages  were  on  the
				  	American  side:    	locally,   	the  U~S.  Army,  Navy,  and  Air  Force  had  overwhelming
				  	superiority;   	likewise  U.S.   	strategic  nuclear  weapons  were  three  or  four
				  	times  more  powerful  than  those  af  the  Soviet  Union.											-
				  	How  can  anyone  accurately  determine  the  relative  part  played  in  settling  a
		     	-	  	crisis   	by  conventional  weapons  in  the  theater  of  operations  and  nuclear
				  	weapons ?
				  	The  best  approach  is  to  s*_ick  to  prudent  conclusions.    	The  central  balance,
		     	-	  	the  one  encompassing  both  Europe  and  the  strategic  weapons  of  the  two
				  	superpowers,  does  exercise  an  influence  over  crises  and  over  diplomatic
				  	confrontations  and  their  outcome  when  armies  face  each  other  or  when
		     	-	  	recourse  to  arms  by  the  superpowers  appears  ~rabable  or  at  least  plausible.
				  	On  the  other  ~and,  whenever  Russian-American  rivalry  extends  inside			     	'		 	-

					     	that  Moscow  now  surpasses  Washington.    	We  could  easily  add  many  other  such
					     	statistics.    	For  instance,   	the  Soviet  Union's  military  budget  increases			   	_
					     	3   	to  S  percent  annually,   	and  represents  some  13  percent,   	perhaps  even  15
					    	percent,   	of  the  USSR's  gross  national  product,  a  percentage  triple  that  of
					     	the  United  States   	(5  percent).    	Even  in  the  nuclear  weapons  field,   	the			    	-
					     	Soviets  are  the  ones  who  have  made  the  most  progress.    	They  have  deployed
		    	'				two  new  submarine-launched  ballistic  missile   	(SLBM)   	systems,  and  three			    	-
					     	land-based  missile  systems.    	The  Americans  have  deployed  only  one  new  SLBM		    	-
					     	system,   	the  Trident,  have  MIRVed  their  Minuteman  and  ~oseidon  missiles,			   	-
					     	and  improved  the  accuracy  of  their  nuclear  warheads.    	During  the  past  10
					     	years,  negotiations  on  strategic  arms  limitations  agreemeats   	(SALT  1  and			 	-
					     	SALT  2)   	have  accompanied  and  dissembled  Soviet  progress.
					     	The  SALT  agreements  are  based  on  the  so-called  arms  control  doctrine.    	The		    	-
					     	crux  of   	this  doctrine  may  be  described  as  follows:    	establish  an  arms  ratio
					     	such  that  neither  of  the  duelists  will  be  tempted  to  use   	them.    	Arms  control
					     	does  not  involve  disarmament  or  the  reduction  of  arms  to  a  minimum:    	if
					     	each  of  the  superpowers  had  only  some  100  missiles,   	each  would  run  the  risk
					     	of  being  disarmed  by  a  first  strike,  and  this  risk  would  increase  instability.

		     	-				other  words,  on  those  weapons   	that  could  reach  Soviet  territory  when  launched
					     	from  American  territory  or  submarines   	(or  vice  versa).    	The  SALT  agreements
					     	are  aim~d  at  creating  "stability"  not  between  all  the  military  resources  of		  	_
		    	-			 	the  two  superpowers  but  between  one  category  of  nuclear  weapons,  namely
					     	intercontinental  launchers.    	Insofar  as  these  agr_eements  achieve  their
					     	goal,   	they   	"neutralize,"  as  it  were,   	these  weapons.    	Stabilization  entails		   	-
					     	nonuti.lization  of  these  weapons,   	unless  there  is  a  direct  attack  against
					     	them  or  against  national  territory.    	What  is   	left  of  their  deterrent  func-
					     	tion?    	The  very  principle  of  SALT  cannot  help  but  revive,  with  greater
					     	urgency,   	the  issue  Europeans  have  been  raising  for  the  past  20  years:
					     	Is  European  security  assured  by  NATO's  conventional  forces  or  by  the  thermo-			-
					     	nuclear  capability  of  the  Uni'ced  States?												-
		    	-			 	In  the  early  days  of  NATO,   	the  presence  of  American  troops  symbolically
					     	obliterated  the  distance  between  the  Old  World  and  the  New  World:    	"Ich
					     	bin  ein  Berliner."    	An  agreement  limited  to  strategic  arms  wi.dens  the  gulf

					     	of  these  negotiations  at  once  and  the  same  time;    	if  the  goal  of  these			   	_
					     	negotiations  is  equality  or  equivalertce  in  one  isolated  field--long-range
					     	launchers--the  Americans  are  logical  in  prohibiting  giving  the  Backfire  an

			     	Two  ideas  guide  the  thinking  and  action  of  American  officials  and  their
			     	advisers.    	The  first  is   	that  ~ussian-American  rivalry  is  inscribed  in  the

			     	a  rnora  or  less  high  level  of  intensity.    	The  second  is  that  it  is  in  the
     	~			 	common  interest  of  the  two  superpowers  and  of  a11  mankind  not  to  wage  the
					"unthinkable"  war,
			     	These  are  reasonable  ide~s   	that  can  be  endorsed  but  they  do  allow  one
			     	element  of  doubt  to  linger.    	The  course  of  diplomacy,  crises  and  their
    	_			 	outcome,   	are  affected  by  the  arms  available  to  one  side  or  the  other.			     	-
			     	What  influence  will  the  results  of  SALT  exercise  on  possible  confrontations
			     	between  the  two  superpowers?    	Considering  the  future  status  of  nuclear
			     	forces  in  1982  or  1985,  would  a  confrontation  of  the  same  type  as   	the  1962

		    	weapons  nor  nuclear  power  plants  ~rom  us,  whereas  the  PRC  would  like  to  buy
		    	some  of   	these  from  us.    	The  United  States  has  decided  not  to  sell  arms   	to
     	-	     	1'eking  but  has  already  let  it  be  known  that  it  would  not  oppose  any  contrary
		    	decision  by  Europeans.
		    	The  Soviets   	definitely  look  with  disfavor  on  this  rapprochement  between
		    	Westerners  and  Chinese.    	For  ~ur  part,  we  rnust  not  delude  ourselves  about
		    	the  military  scope  of  this   	"objective  alliance."    	If  the  Soviet  Union  were
		    	to  launch  an  offensive  limited  to  one  or  another  of  the  hot  spots  on  the				  	_
		    	Sino-Soviet  border,   	the  United  States  would  have  neither  the  intention  nor
		     	the  means  of  intervening.    	Likewise,   	assuming  the  Soviet  Union  launched  its
		    	armed  forces   	toward  the  Atlantic,   	China  would  not  come  to  our  rescue.
		     	China  is  not  for  Western  Europe  the  ally  at  the  enemy's  back  that  Russia
		    	was  for  France  at  the  beginning  of  the  century.
		     	The  men  in  the  Kremlin  probably  see  a  mortal  danger  in  China's  alliance
		    	with  Japan  and  China's  modernization  with  the  help  of  the  West.    	But  this
		     	is  only  a  medium-term  or  long-term  matter.    	The  Chinese  armed  forces  are
		     	20  years  behind  the  Soviet  armed  forces  from  an  equipment  standpoint.    	Japan
     	,	     	allocates  about  only  1  percent  of  its  gross  national  product  to  its  self-
		     	defense  forces.    	I  doubt  that  by  playing  the  Chinese  card,   	the  United  States
		     	will  bring  Moscow  to  display  more  flexibility  or  ma.ke  more  concessions.
		     	The  opposite  result  seems  more  probable  to  me.    	The  Vietnamese  wanted,  at
		     	all  costs,   	to   	liquidate  the  Pol  Pot  regime.    	Tha  Soviets,   	to  say  the  least,
		     	were  not  annoyed  when  this  liquidation  occurred  shortly  after  Washingtc~n's
		~	     	recognition  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China.
		     	The  Chinese  rightly  denounce  Soviet  hegemonism  as  the  number-one  enemy.				    	-
		     	From  their  viewpoint,  quite  obviously,  because  they  have  no  comtmn  border

					Peking.    	Both  moral  and  political  reasons  deterred  the  inzshington  leader-			 	-

					The  United  States  alone  ruled  the  world  market,  so  to  speak.    	It  was  the
					financial,   	commercial  and  industrial  center  of  the  so-called  free  world.
					It  allocated  available  surplus  capital  to  foreign  investments.    	It  held			    	'
					first  place  in  most  of  the  advanced  technologies.   	Some  6  percent  of  the
					world's  total  population  consumed  50  percent  of  the  raw  materials  used  by
					a11  ma.nkind.    	It  was  an  abnormal  situation  that  could  not  last  and  it
					prompted  the  establishment  of  such  international  organizations  as  the
					International  Monetary  Fund,  GATT,  and  the  United  Nations.
					The  Ma.rshall  Plan,   	and  the  recovery  of  Western  Europe  and  Japan  were
					consistent  with  the  logic  of  the  system  of  relations  between  states  as
					well  as  the  logic  of  the  world  market,   	such  as  these  were  viewed  by  leaders
					in  Washington.    	What  now  remains  of  the  United  States'   	supremacy,   	some  30
					years  after  the  Marshall  Plan?
					Per  capita  production  in  Europe's  most  advanced  countries  now  seems   	to  be
					hi.gher  than  that  ir,~  the  United  States  when  we  use  the  official  rates  of
	 	-		     	exchange.    	Even  though  the  underevaluation  of  the  dollar  distorts  these
					figures,   	the  fact  remains  that  per  capita  production  in  Switzerland,  Sweden,
					and  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany,  ha.s  come  close  to  or  equalled  that  in
					the  United  States.    	The  United  States  still  retains  its  superiority  in  an
			     	area  that  is   	the  deciding  factor  in  the  system  of  relations  between  states,		    	-
