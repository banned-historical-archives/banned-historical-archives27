CHAPTER ONE - HOW TO DELIVER SPEECIES  
I. Anybody Can Make A Speech 
We all live in communities. This means that everYdaY 
we spend some time talking to someone or other. Everyone can 
talk, and everyone is talking. Nevertheless, there are many 
people who believe that talking with a purpose or to a group or 
a crowd is something very difficult. Expecially, when it comes 
to making a speech, too many people think that there must be 
some particular way of doing it, or that speeches are meant for 
wiser people and not for everyone. 
In Japan, the precept "the people shall obey but shall 
not know" has predominated in the teach4ng of the common people 
for over a thousand years. For this reason it has become second 
nature to accept the predominating idea that speeches are made 
by the ruling class and that the ruled are there only to listen, 
to take orders and to be pushed around. This long life of for-
ced silence, of having to repress any desire to speak out the 
pending discontent or dissatisfaction, has resulted in confin-
ing innumerable people within a servile spirit. Consequently, 
a large number of people have the idea that speaking in public 
is an expression of some terrible disobedience. They even 
believe that by speaking in public some unexpected misfortune 
may befall the person and this idea, in turn has further 
aggravated the servile spirit.

The new constitution recognizes, though still somewhat 
inadequately, political freedom and the basic rights of man. 
The scope of freedom of speech has been broadened considerably 
compared to the old constitution. Anyone is now allowed to say 
what he wants freely. However, actually when we '4ive this mat-
ter furthe7 thought, we see that there are still many barriers 
In the way. Ever since the 'Red Purge', it has become dangerous 
to support the Communist party or to express agreement with 
their policies. There have been actual instances in many dif-
ferent places of work whe?e people who have shown such tenden-
cies have been discharged in very underhanded ways. 
With such situations still existing, how can we say 
that freedom of speech is assured? People are actually afraid 
of making speeches in public and thereby attract attention or 
perhaps be blacklisted because of what they say. This cannot 
be real freedom of speech at all. 
Nevertheless, the united strength of the laborers and 
the farmers has been gradually clearing the field for more free-
dom in speech as a result of the struggles they have been 
carrying out during the ten years oi? so after the war. Little 
by little their just opinions are getting to be heard. Of 
course, the way these laborers and farmers speak is not polished. 
They cannot make 'good' speeches. Yet, what is more eloquent 
than the truth they have to say? Everyone is beginning to try 
to speak this truth and these people are gradually finding out

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
that speech-making is not reserved only for the leaders and 
the wise. Actual instances have proven the eloquency of these 
working people and they have come to realize this fact them-
selves. 
Furthermore, even women have awakened to the fact that 
they can speak out without any fear in front of other people. 
These women, who were made to believe that speaking in public 
was for them impossible, gathered together for peace Congresses, 
or Anti-Nuclear Bomb Meetings, or Mothers' Rallies and have 
cried out the truth as they know it. In doing so they have 
broken all conventional rules. 
All this proves that anyone who can talk can also 
make a speech. You do not have to have a trained voice nor a 
loud voice. By using a microphone anyone can reach out to any 
kind of a crowd. As long as you can speak and are willing to 
make some preparations, mentally and otherwise, you can now 
deliver a good speech. 
It is gradually becoming pointless to think that there 
must be some special way to make a speech or to feel that a 
certain form must be followed. Actually, old-fashioned ora-
torical speeches are rather coming to be considered out-dated 
and queer. To overstrain oneself or to strike a certain atti-
tude in speech may even sound comical. Times have changed and 
the normal form of speech attracts the listener most naturally. 
All.in all, grave decisions need not be made.in order to make

a speech. Anyone can make a speech. 
However, speeches are aimed at a great number of peo-
ple. And since there is no doubt about this, it would be rude 
and impolite to the listeners for anyone to make a speech that 
is too carelessly prepared or too perfunctorily delivered. 
The purpose of this chapter is to clarify the most 
basic ideas and things to bear in mind when making a speech, 
so that anyone will be able to deliver a speech. 
2. Defects In The Public Speech Of The Past. 
There is an old Chinese saying that tells us to 'Probe 
into the old and learn about the new'. So, before going into 
any further explanations of modern forms of speech, we shall 
take a brief glance at the speeches of the past. 
Of course, in this small guide book, we do not have 
the space to delve into the long history of speech that may take 
us thousands of years into the past. What we will do is to look 
back upon the past forty or fifty years from around the end 
df the Meiji era through the Taisho and up to the Showa era  
and find some examples in the speech of our own country. 
It is generally accepted that the term 'speech(ENZETSU)' 
came into existence when YUkichi Fukuzawa established the KEIO 
GIJUKU(Keio University) at Mita in Tokyo and erected a 'Public 
Speech Hall(ENZETSU KAN)! in a corner of the school premises

Ne, 
with the purpose of training students in public speech. This 
word became popularized throughout Japan around the years 188L 
to 1881 (13th and 14th years of Meiji) when the local young 
leaders of the Liberal Party, awakened to the new era of demo-
cratic rights, barnstormed the entire nation. Therefore, it 
can be said that the origin of speech in Japan comes from the 
cries that were directed towards the government demanding of 
political freedom. 
In the language used by the students of this time, there 
were a lot of words transcribed into Japanese frpm the Chinese 
language. Rhetorically this influence made the language ornate, 
and since the students were always indignant over something or 
other, their style in public speech could be called 'ornate 
indignation style.' Very few students seemed able to speak 
deliberately and logically and to convince the listener in a 
cool way. Consequently, it became common to think of speech 
as being a very loud and exaggerated manner of expressing one-
self. It was not until the latter part of the Meiji reign that 
the term 'lecture(KOEN)' was used for the quiet and more academic 
type of speech. 
Whatever these historical facts may tell us, there is 
no doubt that, in the course of time, the word speech came to 
mean generally, and had to be, the 'ornate indignation style'. 
And this style was accepted until the development of the radio 
and the microphone. Even to this day, there are old-fashioned 
-5-

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
politicians and aged Buddhist priests who believe that a speech 
must be made with superfluous adjectives and Chinese expressions. 
For them the most elozuent type of speech must also have a cer-
tain rhythm. These people so stronglY insist on this ornate 
oration that this type of speech shows no sign of disappearing 
yet. In spite of the fact that our language is changing fairly 
rapidly, the spoken aria the written languages are coming closer 
together, the newspapers are limiting the number of Chinese 
characters used in their pages, and the modern use of KARA 
prevails, the old-fashioned style of oration is still enjoying 
an existence. It is not uncommon to hear someone crying out 
in a grated voice neglecting even the very convenient micro-
phone. And we have to bear with it. 
We need not go far for any proof of this miserable 
situation. Just wait until the general elections begin. Once 
the candidates hit the road, their speeches and the way in 
which they will be delivered will be living exhibitions of an 
out-moded style, mechanical ignorance and senselessness. 
One of the reasons for this existing situation lies 
in the minds of the politicians. They arrogantly believe that 
the common people should listen to anything they have to say, 
and they still believe that when the rulers or leaders have 
anything to say it must be said in the most pompous and 
Ingratiating way. 
The second reason stems from the laziness of the poli-
ticians to understand the movements in the new age. They 
- 6 -

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
forget that the common people are moving along busily everyday 
with the current of time and that these people are also grow-
ing with time. They somehow manage to remain ignorant to t4e 
fact that the language, the way of thinking and the mechanical 
culture of the world are progressing day by day. Our speeches 
also, in the past, have been redundant with stereotyped Marxist 
terms. We were self-satisfied with what we were saying. Being 
so blind, how is it possible to befriend the common people? 
We must be willing to part with all the defects of 
speech being used so far. There must be a plainer, clearer 
and more familiar way to communicate ideas. And only when we 
master this way of communication can we be called good speakers. 
3. "Hit the People" Speeches Must Be Avoided 
We often hear people say that they are going out to 
make a speech and 'to hit the people hard ' But when we 
come to think of this expression, there really isn't anything 
so arrogant and contemptible. We want the people to listen to 
our speeches, and not to hit and hit and hit them hard. It is 
only from self-centered subjectivism,. from contempt of the 
people and from the desire to drag the people around that such 
a grave misconception stems. 
Now, to agitate does not mean the same thing as hitting 
the people. No matter hog loud a voice one may use in speech, 
- 7 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
if the listener is not moved emotionally, the speech has not 
been agitating. To be agitated means to be moved to action. 
If the listener after hearing a speech is moved to do something, 
to feel that he must face any difficulty and surmount it, he 
has been agitated. This cannot be done by forcing logic down 
the listener's throat or roaring at him at the top of one's 
voice. Such emotion can be stimulated only when the facts are 
shown one by one and when there is a quiet persuasiveness. 
Agitation means to stimulate the emotion in this manner and 
direct it into one right way. Whatever the case may be we must 
try to avoid making speeches with the idea of hitting the 
people. All the superfluous excitement is waste of energy for 
the speaker and for the audience. 
One of the greatest shortcomings and at the same 
time one of the characteristics of the speech in the past has 
been this meaningless excitement and the exaggerated indigna-
tionapparant in it. But it may be difficult to do away with 
this completely. For when aAyone decides to make a speech 
before a great number of people, it is almost inevitable that 
that person becomes tense and feels excited, whether he be con-
scious of it or not. Yet it is not only pointless to exag-
gerate this excitement but even harmful. With such unnecessary 
emotion it is impossible to make a good and responsible speech. 
good speech cannot be made by hitting the people. 
It should be made by speaking in a very ordinary way what anyone

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
would say anywhere and anytime. Only in this way can delivery 
of good speeches be achieved. Especially when we consider the 
fact that we are willing to correct any wrong that may have 
risen from ignorance in the past, we should by all means stop, 
at this moment, the kind of speech that has the arrogant atti-
tude of hitting the people. 
4. New Method In Uech 
From what has been said, it is possible to discern a 
certain course towards a new method in speech. It is quite 
clear that the first step towards the new method of speech is 
to say in the most natural way what anyone can say anytime, 
anywhere. 
But we, in this guide book, are trying to make clear 
the way of speaking for the working class people. And from this 
viewpoint it is not sufficient to encourage only a natural kind 
of speech. We must at least always bear the following two points 
In mind. Namely, first, for whom we are making the speech, and 
second, what we are speaking for. At the same time it is impos-
sible to forget that we are learning from the common people and 
offering our services to them. The most important thing in 
relation with this is to hold a world view based an class strife, 
and to be sure to understand thoroughly the dialectical materi-
alism. It is nonsense to remember by rote any particular thesis

without the person himself holding a definite world view. A 
rendition of the news like a parrot cannot be called a speech. 
Mao Tse-tung tells us that 'One who does no research 
work by himself has no right to speak', a saying we nll must 
remember well and put to action. We must make our speeches only 
after we have given our own deep thoughts to it, listened to 
what other people have to say about the subject, made a thorough 
investigation on it, studied it, and done the best we could to 
prepare for it. Then actually it does not matter whether there 
may be some shortcomings in the facts from the eyes of higher 
authority. What At most important is not to make a speech 
with unconvincing assumptions and facts that have not been 
verified. When we take up a certain social incident, we must 
be careful to see its historical background, its geographical 
setting, its human relations, its political implications, its 
economic standing, and perhaps even its influence on future 
developments. Only after we have given the subject this much 
careful strdy can we grasp a definite view on social life. 
It is said that 'truth is always truth only under a 
certain condition'. And we know that this 'certain condition' 
is constantly changing along the law of evolution. Both in the 
fields of natural science and social science we are not allowed 
to be lazy. We must always give serious thought to our imme-
diate questions. We must try to derive a solution that will 
lead the common peopl. toward happiness, and we must let the

people know what that solution is. It is important to work acti-
vely with the people. 'The philosophers were able to understand 
the world. But what is important is to reform the world' are 
words from the FUEURBACH thesis and words that we must not for-
get. 
Since we are speaking of public speech, we must be 
ready to take assume responsibility for what we say. We also 
must do our best to work towards the realization of what we say. 
In other words the new method of speech depends on 
how well we can base our arguments on material dialectism, how 
simply and straightforward we can deliver it, and how much it 
will contribute directly to the betterment of the people. If 
the speech we deliver cannot help the people, if the common 
people cannot understand it and if they turn away from it, we 
must say that that speech was a failure. On the other hand, no 
matter how much your speech may attract the attention of the 
people, if it leads in the opposite direction from what we aspire 
as the law of social evolution, then such a speech also should 
be considered a failure. 
The way to master the new method of speech is not as 
simple as taking the escalator or the elevator to a higher 
floor. The way is similar to the path leading to the summit of 
a mountain. Each strong step leads us that much higher. And 
nobody else will take these steps for us. Of course, it is 
almost impossible to run up this mountain path. But why hurry?

Anyone, as long as he is willing to walk up step by step, 
will certainly reach the top. Furthermore, if one is healthy 
enough and has that much preparation, this path is one that can 
be taken by anybody. This mountain we are talking about is by 
no means a mysterious mountain. It is not a mountain reserved 
only for a limited nuniber of privileged people. 
Let us all join hands, cooperate, and together climb 
this new mountain! 
5. Practising Speech 
a. The Structure Of Speech 
The primary thing to bear in mind when you make a 
speech for the first time is to make clear what you are expect-
ed to do. For example, say you are asked to make speeches to 
boost a candidate in an election. You must make sure of a 
number of things: are you supposed to introduce the candidate? 
or is the subject you are supposed to speak on related to 
international problems, internal national problems, economic 
problems, or cultural problems? or again whether you are sup-
posed to talk beftre the candidate or after him, whereabouts 
you come and about how long you are expedted to talk. All 
these matters should be clarified before you begin to gather 
material for your speech. If this much preparation is not Made, 
it is most likely that there will be over-lapping among the 
- 12 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
different speakers,and sometimes even contradictions. The 
most important point is to avoid by all means any great amount 
of repitition of what the candidate himself has to say. 
Again, for instance, if you are supposed to speak in a meet-
ing discussing the social security problem, you should try to 
find out, somehow beforehand, what the other speakers are going 
to say, and to prepare your own speech on a different line, or 
if changing the subject is difficult, at least, change your the 
approach to the same question. 
The best thing to do is for all the speakers to meet 
once before the meeting and decide what particular portion of 
the entire subject each person should handle. If this is 
impossible, the sponsor or the person in charge of the whole 
program should make similar arrangements. 
Now, when you are asked to be a speaker, you should 
by all means make a draft of your speech. Perhaps the occas-
sion may not call for a well written manuscript, yet you should 
try to make a draft. 
Let us take a brief look at the time element. Two 
hundred and forty to two hundred and seventy words(Japanese) 
can be read in a minute. This x.eans that if you are using the 
regular four-hundred-word manuscript-paper, by spacing your 
sentences and paragraphs adequately, you will be able to read 
each page in about a minute. Eight or nine of these pages 
will take about ten minutes, and seventeen to eighteen pages 
- 13 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
would probably take about twenty minutes. If there are other 
statistics and illustrations to be shown, that much extra 
time should be taken into consideration beforehand. 
Now, on making a draft, it may be a good idea to 
keep a memo into which you can jot down some of the main points 
you would like to speak about. Next you must decide in what 
order you want to present your idea. At this point there is 
one important thing you must try to remember. Do not think 
you can say everything related to the subject in one speech. 
Instead you should try to limit your speech to one of the main 
points in the subject and center the speech around this one 
main point. After you have made this decision ymi are now 
ready to sit down and write a draft. Be sure you space your 
lines and paragraphs carefully and do not forget to write in 
a way you usually speak. 
After you have made your first draft, read it out 
loud. If you have a friend who is willing to listen, have 
him listen and time you, and ask for his comments. Then you 
should go over your draft once more. Try to make sure whether 
the order of paragraphs is right, whether there isn't anything 
else that must be said, or whether there isn't any portion that 
ought to be deleted. There may be some expressions that do not 
sound quite right. Some of the words you have used may be too 
difficult or misleading. 
Go over your own draft from these different viewpoints, 
-

( 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
and with a red and blue pencil put in marks for remembrance. 
Places that should be emphasized can be underlined, while other 
marks can be used to show places that may be deleted in case 
time runs out. 
The best thing to do after this draft is made is to 
rewrite the speech on a card or some cards. Of course, the 
whole speech need not be written. It is best to write only the 
main points. But if all this is too much work, the next best 
thing to do is to go over the draft thoroughly, and then read 
it nut loud once more as if you were actually giving the 
speech. 
When you are doing this reading, it is a good idea 
to time yourself two or three times. You should try to see how 
long it takes when you read the speech slowly and also when 
you read it fast, since when we say it takes a minute to read 
240 to 270 words we, of course, are talking of the average. 
The time can easily be shortened to thirty seconds or again 
stretched to two minutes. All this depends on the practice 
you do. You must know your own normal pace so that you can 
plan more carefully in the future. After you have done this 
much it may be another good idea to mark places that ought to 
be said rather slowly for emphasis and faster for effect. 
There are roughly four ways in which you can const-
ruct your speech. The first is to place your theory at the 
beginning and then to bring in the facts that will back up your 
- 15 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-010411Rnn9-4nn9qnnnl 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
theory. The second is to show the facts at the beginning and 
from these facts draw out your theory. The third, of course, 
is a mixture of these two. You also can consruct your speech 
strictly from the logical point of view. It is difficult to 
say which of the four ways is the best for any speech. The 
choice should depend on the subject of the speech, the speak-
ing habit of the speaker, or again on the nature of the audi-
ence or the atmosphere of the meeting. In mapy cases, though, 
it has been considered best to start out with concrete facts 
which can be understood easily and which might be more familiar 
to the audience and then to go on to a theory drawn out of 
these concrete facts. Live facts are most eloquent in speech. 
When the speaker can talk of some personal experiences 
that he has actually seen or heard of, or of some fact about 
which he hqd made personal investigations, then his speech 
breathes with life. It levelops the power to attract other 
people and moreover there will be no worry that he may say the 
same thing as some one else. One of the main things to remember 
when composing a speech is to strictly avoid saying anything 
about something you are not too sure about. Second-hand infor-
mation also has only that much attractiveness. This should 
also be avoided. 
We must learn to treasure live facts above anything 
else. Do nnt say anything that is based on unconvincing assum-
ptions. Try to compose your speech upon facts that have been 
- 16 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 CIA RDP81 0104?1Pnn9qnno-v-Irmi a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
ascertained. Thus, as is probably clear by now, it is extremely 
important to construct a tightly organized speech. You do not 
have to worry about writing beautiful words. Say only what 
you think must be said in a language that you yourself are sure 
about. 
Now, when you get on the platform, try tilt to look at 
your manuscript. Remember it is there just in case you want 
to make sure what you were supposed to say. 
; b. Physical Conditions 
Makirg a speech requires more energy than you can 
imagine. The purpose of this short section is to mention some 
of the points that should be borne in mind in connection wiPi 
your health and physical condition. 
First, it is impossible for consumptive people to 
make speeches. 
Next, people who have weak tonsils or a '-iad nose 
should receive complete medical treatment. Otherwise, making 
speeches will probably only help to worsen their illness. 
Toothaches can interfere with a long speech. When a tooth is 
loose or missing, it may cause mispronunciations and other 
inconveniences for the speaker. Sometimes when speechs are 
made after exhaustion or lack of sleep the speaker may lose 
his voice temporarily. 
Now, about food. Try not to make speeches directly 
after a full meal or again when you are very hungry. This 
-17-

:??? , 
f. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
may cause dizziness or a stomach ache, or again, the voice 
may become hoarse. It is important to see that there is at 
least an hour after the meal? But, of course, you need not 
be too sensitive about meal hours if the speech to be given 
is a very short one. 
There are people who drink a lot of water while 
speaking. That is not good for your throat. Speaking in a 
loud voice cause a slight degree of inflammation in your 
throat. Therefore, though cold water may feel soothing, it 
does not help the throat at all. The more water you drink the 
hoarser your throat will get. If you are not straining your 
voice, you should be able to speak for about an hour without 
drinking any water. But if you do have the habit of drinking 
water during your speech, you should ask the people who are 
managing the meeting to warm the water a little bit and be 
careful not to drink too much at a time. 
People wearing glasses have a handicap because they 
cannot speak with their eyes. If you are only slightly near-
sighted it would be much better to speak with your glasses 
off. The movement of your eyes can help you in your speech 
for more than you imagine. It is said that 'the eye is the 
window to your heart'. So to close these two windows con-
stitutes a disadvantage in the effects of your speech. 
Of course, a large rerson has more advantages than 
a smaller person, especially in a big hall. When the plat-
form is large and the rostrum is large and microphones are 
- 18 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 CIA RDP81 0104?1Pnn9qnno-v-Irmi a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
standing on the rostrum, the small person becomes smaller and 
shows little appeal to the audience. 
People with a weak heart must be very careful. Too 
much excitement must be avoided. The same care applies to 
penple who have hi7,h blood pressure. 
All in all, to have a healthy body is the first 
condition to be fulfilled to make a good speech. It is impos-
sible to expect a good speech from an unhealthy body. But 
there are times when a speech must be made despite the con-
dition of one's health. In such cases, every care must be 
made to create optimum conditions under which the person is to 
make his speech. 
c. Voice and Language 
Your voice is made when a small amount of breath 
comes through your throat and vibrates the vocal chord. This 
voice is amplified in the hollow portion of your mouth and nose 
and comes out through your lips. In other words, to speak 
means to breathe. Now, in order to breathe properly you must 
inhale and exhale properly. Therefore, when we talk of a 
good voice we must consider this breathing method. That is, 
we must learn to take in as deep a breath as possible in the 
most natural way. To do this we must try to take regular deep 
breathing exercises. 
We breathe with our breast, with our shoulders and 
-19-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 CIA RDP81 0104?1Pnn9qnno-v-Irmi a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
with our stomach. And to go a step further we our also 
breathing through our skin pores. Among all these breath-
ing methods the one that allows us to take the deepest breath 
is the breathing using the stomach and coving the diaphragm. 
This is the reason why we should try to do take regular exer-
cises in this deep breathing. Thece is no difficulty in 
doing this at all. All you have to do is practice breathing 
with your stomach as you were probably taught in school. 
Practice moving your diaphragm and by doing so you can 
strengthen is. With this practice you will be able to take 
in deep breaths very effectively. Doing this exercise morn-
ing and evening is not only good for your health but good 
for your voice. So we encourage you to keep it up if you 
wish to improve your speech. 
Nmal as we have been saying, to make a sound means 
the same thing as to exhale. Therefore it is very important 
to use your breath sparingly when speaking. Almost all 
people have the habit of using too much breath for the first 
few woris. So the best thing is to be careful not to do so. 
Probably another thing that is still more important is to 
utilize hundred per cent the resonance effect of the mouth 
and the nose and to develop a beautiful resounding voice. 
Recently the microphone has come into use and this 
has made the old-fashioned training of the voice for a great 
crowd quite unnecessary. Yet, even before the microphone, a

- 20-

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
clear resounding voice has the best effect. It may be a good 
idea to train yourself a little in singing. This may help 
you a great deal. 
To have a beautiful voice is a definite advantage 
when making a speech. But from =any experiences in the past 
we have seen that people who have beautiful vbices are liable 
to rely too much on their voice and too little on sincerity. 
Such a person must take extra care to avoid such mistakes, 
while on the other hand do all he can to develop his beauti-
ful voice further. 
In contrast to this we see many people having a 
very hard time and worrying about their poor voices. But 
we must remember that anyone can, by training, develop his own 
characteristic voice and make it sound attractive. By practi-
cing deep breathing daily, by training yourself to place as 
little stress on the vocal chord as possible and still more 
by using your whole body as an instrument of resonance and 
getting to know the knack of making the entire hall resound, 
you will then have a very attractive voice. 
The next problem will be about the language. Since 
a speech is not a singing recital, it is very important to 
concentrate much attention on the language usage. 
There may be infinite problems related with the 
use of our language, but in this section we will limit our-
selves to language usage only in relation to speech.

The first thing to be noted is to try to use the 
standard language. 
Secondly, since the speaking language depends entire-
ly on sound to convey the meaning of a word to the listener, 
it is very important to use understandable words and to avoid 
words that have the same sound and may be misleading. Of 
course, in our language it is possible to discern words that 
sound the same from the context of the sentence. In any case 
you must be very careful in using such words. 
To give an example there are probably more than ten 
words that have the same pronunciation tSEIKO....(success, 
steel manufacture, elaborate, crude, work in fine weather, 
pure and dignified, etc ) When you refer to any of these 
words in speaking you should try to say the same thing in 
easier terms, but again there are words that can be understood 
clearly from the context. All in all, you must never forget 
that the listeners have only their ears to discern what you 
are saying, so therefore you must be careful in the words 
you Use. 
Thirdly, you must avoid using terms that can be 
understood only by a certain limited number of people. For 
instance you cannot expect the housewives in your audience to 
understand you when you say, "Comrade So-and-So is uncompro-
misingly steeped in the principles of indoctrination, and 
hence his tendencies into radicalism...." It is quite clear

that instead of using these difficult Marxist terms and 
foreign words you should try to use words more familiar to 
the common people. You should try to use words that are used 
daily and also to explain the difficult terms with factual 
examples. 
Fourthly, your language should not be too rough nor 
too polite. Try to set your standard at the level of the 
common daily language of the common people, using the standard 
language with a correct pronunciation and understandable words 
"As round eggs can be cut into squares, so one same thing can 
be said with an edge." 'This old saying tells us that one 
misuse of a word may irritate some people, bring grief to some 
people, and even cause mirth in others. This means that we 
should use our very best common sense and be careful to use 
words that will convince everybody. 
Finally, above all, you must be sincere in what 
you are saying. No matter how nice the speech may be, how 
well it is delivered, how beautiful your voice may be, and 
how well it may be understood, if there is no sincerity in the 
way you give it, the words are as good as dead. 
On the other hand, if you can show that you honestly 
mean what you are saving, then no matter how simple your words 
may be, they will touch the listeners' soul. It is amazing 
how sensitive the listeners are in detecting whether there is 
this honestry in the speech or not from the words that flow

out of the speaker's mouth. When we think of this we know 
that the spirit that should underly all our speeches is none 
other than sincerity. 
d. Attitude and Gesture 
A good listener is said to be able to appraise a 
speaker by the way he carries himself onto an the platfoom, by 
the time he has lifted his face to utter the first word of the 
speech. This shows how important the attitude of the speaker 
is even before he actually utters a word. 
If the speaker has self-confidence in what he has 
to say and is enthusiastic about the speech, then there can 
be seen an inexplicable nuance of this confidence in his 
eyes and in his face and in his whole attitude. Most 
listeners are 'sensitive to this. 
In the past, speakers were expected to appear on 
the platform with a pompous attitude. Today, this is not so. 
But, of course, this does not mean that one is allowed to be 
indiscreet. 
In many cases we may not be able to wear nice 
clothes, but the important thing is not expensive clothes as 
much as clean simple clothes and a warm attitude. 
In many cases we are apt to turn our eyes away 
from the audience when making the speech, down to our 
manuscript:ot just down. We must somehow force ourselves 
out of this bad habit and learn to look into the faces of 
the audience. Of course, it is not necessary to throw back

your shoulders and strike an attitude, but to produce a 
better voice and also to relieve your vocal chords from any 
unnecessary tension you must avoid stooping over. When you 
are in a position in which your two arms are carrying most 
of your weight leaning heavily on the rostrum, it will not 
be good for your breathing and furthermore, this position 
will restrict your gestures. 
The best way to carry your body in delivering a 
good speech is to stand with your feet slightly apart, per-
haps with one foot placed a little forward than the other. 
Set your hips straight on your legs and take an attitude 
similar to 'parade rest'. When you are speaking always be 
careful to keep your weight on your feet and not to lean 
forward - this will make you look down and take your eyes 
away from the audience. Also leaning forward will put that 
much strain into your posture and tire you. When you are 
planning to make a speech of more than thirty minutes you 
must be careful about this habit, too. Furthermore, today 
the microphone has become very popular and in most cases one 
is found standing on the platform. The contrast will not be 
too good when the speaker is bending forward like a bent nail 
whereas the microphone is bolt straight. This slightly stoop-
ing posture will make you use more energy in adjusting your 
voice. All these things point to the fact that you must learn 
to stand with the right posture in making your speech.

Next, about your gestures. Gestures have never been stipu-
lated as a rule in speech making. They should come naturally. 
Through training them the natural movements of your body can 
be transformed into something appealing. 
Some people do not use their left hand or arm. 
When this reaches the extreme, they even lead people to believe 
that gestures are meant only for the right arm, and we see 
people waving their right arms around most unnaturally; 
Gestures' of the whole body are something that will 
help in the expression of words. They may be used to empha-
size certain points. In any case they should come naturally 
from the speaker himself and should express his awn chara-
cteristics. People's gestures should not be imitated, but odd 
mannerisms in your own gestures should be corrected by all 
means. To make your head, hands and arms, shoulders, and 
your legs hetp express your thoughts in words, freely and 
without giving other people a sense of peculiarity, takes 
a lot of training. 
Therefore our best advice is to tell you not to go 
to any length trying to develop gestures that really do not 
belong to yourself. If they come naturally then it is 
alright. Be careful to develop such natural gestures so 
that they will grow to be one of your valuable assets. This 
can be done only after you have given careful thought to 
the many practices you might experience.

e. EYes and Ears 
Where to rest your eyes on when you stand in front 
of a great audience is a problem. Try to remember that the 
most natural way to settle ybur eyes is to face the audience 
straight and keep your eyes a little above the middle of 
the crowd. Do not look around too much, but remember that 
it is also important tb always keep in touch with the people 
in the audience to your right and left or directly in front 
and way above. 
As a rule the speaker should not take his eyes 
off his audience. Reading the manuscript, then, becomes a 
great disadvantage. Even when you reach out for your water, 
you should try to find the glass with your hand and drink 
the water without moving your eyes away from the audience. 
In other words, we understand the speech to bd a 
communication of human emotions of the speaker and of the 
listeners through words, and that the eyes take on a very 
important role in this communication. The speaker should 
constantly be aware of the listener's attitude, while the 
listener should watch the movements of the speaker's eyes 
and try to understand the thoughts and passions, the depth 
and the strength, through them. Looking at this in a very 
severe way, we can say that a speech is like a serious duel. 
One wink of the eye may lead to your own death, or again 
could give you an unexpected opportunity.

When you get used to speaking, you will gradually 
be able to read the expressions in the faces of the members 
of the audience. Then you can tell whether you should drop 
your voice and speak quietly or raise your voice and go on 
in an emphatic way, or again talk slowly or quickly, or 
make the audience laugh or make them thnse. When you can 
read the expressions on the faces of your listeners you 
will be able to make the above decisions reflectively. 
Along with the eyes, the ears also play a very 
important role. You should be able to tell how far your 
voice is reaching, whether your voice is just right for the 
microphone or not, or again whether it is too loud or not. 
You must be able to detect all these things for yourself and 
at the same time be able to listen to the hum of voices, 
the sighs, the clapping of hands, the cheerings, and the 
laughs in the crowd. You must be able to catch these 
expressions very quickly and be able to react to them effect-
ively. 
All in all, a speech is not merely moving your 
mouth and saying something. You must alert all the nerves 
in your body and call forth their cooperation. When we 
are speaking to one person we use our senses actively and 
respond to the other person's reactions. In a speech we are 
actually facing hundreds and sometimes even thousands of 
people. Wouldn't you think it natural that that much more

4 
physical energy would be used and that that much more nerves 
before such great crowds should be strained? 
By now it should be obvious what we mean when we 
say that a epeech is like a serious duel. There never can 
be too much preparation, and enough training is never 
really enough. Don't you think it would be a good idea to 
form small groups that can get together and listen to each 
other's speeches, encourage each other, and criticize each 
other for constant improvement in the future? 
f. The Microphone and Tape-recorder 
Now, let us go into a brief explanation of the 
4 
4 microphone and the tape-recorder. (Further detail will be 
given in the section 'Amplifier and Tape-recorder'.) Here 
we will give only a few hints in connection with giving a 
speech. 
Today, hall with fairly large audience capacities 
usually are equiped with public address systems, but there 
seems to be very few people who can really use the micro-
phone properly. We will, therefore, begin with general 
remarks. 
First, all microphones have a directional nature, 
which means that outside of A certain angle your voice will 
not enter the microphone. 
Secondly, the microphone receives only a limited 
pitch and volume. Voices that range beyond this limit cannot 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
-29-
50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81 01041Rnn9qnn9-4nnnl a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
be amplified adequately and will rather tend to become 
bothersome noises, and there is nothing more trying for 
the listener. 
Thirdly, there are various types of microphones, 
good and bad. Each type of microphone has its own special 
range. You should know the differences in order get the 
best results. Don't presume that you know all about micro-
phones, but go to someone and ask him precisely what you 
should do to get the best results from the microphone you 
are supposed to use for the speech. 
You should also train your ears to detect, when 
you utter your first few words, how far the voice is reach-
ing out into the audience. This may, at first, be a little 
difficult, but if you have a good ear and at the same time 
if you watch carefully for any reactions in the audience 
you will be able to tell quite accurately how far your 
voice has reached. By all means, train yourself in this 
detection. 
Any noise other than your words coming out of 
the microphone is an utter nuisance. Don't make any noise 
yourself on the table where the microphone stands. Avoid 
holding and kicking the microphone. Remember to speak into 
the microphone from the right distance. 
Now, next about the tape-recorder. There still 
seems to be a lot to be learnt in the use of this very 
convenient instrument. 
_ 30 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-01041Rnn9Inn9qnnni 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
When you have to make the same announcements 
in several different places, the best thing to do is to 
have the announcements recorddd in a man's voice and a 
woman's voice over and over again. The best portion in 
this recording should be picked out and used for the 
announcements. By doing so you can save a lot of trouble 
and be very efficient. Yet even this much evidently is not 
being done very properly. 
You can use the tape-recorder for speech practice 
too. For instande, go over your speech four or five times 
and then make a recording. Go over the speech again five 
or six times and then make the second recording. After 
another series of practices make your third recording and 
listen to all three of them, making comparisons. You can 
also go further by picking out the best parts. from the 
three recordings and arranging them into one speech. 
Listening to this edited speech of yours, you may even be 
surprised at how well your own speech sounds. This may 
encourage you and become a standard for you and help in 
further improvements. 
Of course, there can be a more scientific approach 
to your speech. Use a stop-watch and see how long it takes 
to say certain phrases and how long some of the pauses 
are. Time some of the phrases while you read them quickly 
and also while reading them slowly. Carefully note down 
- 31 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA--RDP81-01041Rnn9Inn9qnnni g 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
all these timings and variations and after going over it 
two or three times build your speech up in a strictly 
scientific way. 
This method can be used not only for pacing your 
speech, but for emphasis and intonation in your speech. In 
either case, to use the tape-recorder in this way will 
undoubtedly hep you greatly to understand the defects in 
your speech and to set a standard for your speech. 
Another good idea is to have a group of people 
listen to your speechtirrorgh the recording. Criticising 
the recording sometimes does not bother the speaker so 
much because he can listen to it somewhat more objectively 
himself. Try to keep a reserve of reels and through this 
training with the tape-recorder, let us do our best to reform 
the old-fashioned speeches into more modern speeches. 
Further effects of using the tape-recorder can 
be seen when.a person who has trained himself in this met-
hod makes a radio broadcast. It is surprising how self-
assured and confident you can be. Also when you stand in 
front of an ordinary microphone you will have by this time 
learned not just to roar into it. 
There are still unexplored fields in the use of 
the tape-recorder. We hope that originality and creativity 
will produce further experiences in this field for the bet-
terment of our speech.

6. About The Listeners 
There can be no speech without an audience before 
the speaker. Not only that, but with the development of the 
microphone, we can today speak to thousands and sometimes 
even tens of thousands of people at once. In such large 
audiences there can be old and young, men and women, and 
so the crowd is not necessarily limited to any one category 
of people. 
People who have just started out in making speeches 
say that it scares them to speak before a large crowd. 
There may be differences in atmosphere according to the mass 
psychology of the crowd, but the difficulty in speaking 
before a crowd does not come only from the size of the 
audience. A more significant reason for this difficulty 
may stem from the type of people who make up the audience, 
such as, most of the people being young or perhaps middle-
aged, the majority being men or women, laborers, farmers, 
merchants, intellectuals, br perhaps children. The dif-
ficulty in such cases stems from the fact that you will 
have to center your speech around this particular class 
of people and focus your speech to that point. 
Formerly, people used to say to people who were 
afraid of crowds, 'Don't think they are people. Consider 
them as a bunch of pumpkins or something.' This is a 
-33-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-01041Rnn9Inn9qnnni 
? 
; ? : 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
pretty rough way to go around teaching speech. We cannot 
afford to do such things today. 
What is more important today is respecting your 
audience and not feeling any inferiority. Whatever the 
case may be, never look down upon your audience. You 
need not be afraid of them', but be sure not to think that 
the audience is just a stupid crowd. This misconception 
may lead you into trouble. In an audience there most 
probably will be someone or other who has deeper thoughts 
or who may be more active in practice than the speaker 
himself. Each face in the crowd may not look too impres-
sive individually, but the audience as a whole has a 
tremendous strength. It is very important not to forget 
this fr,.ct. 
The audience will soon see through any unconvinc-
ing poses struck by the speaker. Half-hearted speeches 
can never grasp the attention of the audience. 
To speak for the betterment of the common people, 
to draw out the discontent of the people in a concrete 
form, and to organize the request of the people in a very 
brilliant way - this is the kind of speech for which we 
aspire. 
To achieve this effect you must observe the 
audience very carefully, you must analyze the audience, 
organize it and decide precisely where you want to aim 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release p 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA RDP8i-ninztqPnn9qnno 
; 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
your speech. After doing this you must bravely, frankly, 
and straightforwardly jump right into the crowd. You may 
actually be standing on a platform, a little higher than 
the audience, but this does not mean that you should feel 
satisfied with this high position. You must try to deve-
lop your speech in harmony with the movement of the audience, 
as a friend of the people. At the same time you should 
not feel inferior to the crowd. Have confidence in the 
realization that you are their friend. Speak in their 
language and speak persuasively what you must say. 
!Listen well and you speak well' means that if 
you want to become a good speaker, you should always be 
conscious of being one of the common people and to be in 
with them and th listen to as many speeches as possible. 
Repeating this, you will be able to grasp the psychology 
of the crowd, not just theoretically, but through your 
own experience. You will be able to see for yourself the 
subtle nuances in their psychology. This will naturally 
lead you to the best kind of speech. 
Furthermore, by living in with the people you 
will be able to observe and know very intimately their 
clothes, attitudes and expressions. Keep piling these 
experiences up and you will find yourself understanding the 
feeling of the audience without much trouble. This is one 
of the most important daily practices you should try to

observe. 
7. Consideration of Time And Place 
a. The Relations Between Time and Place 
So far we have been talking about meetings held 
under most ordinary conditions. But recently there are 
meetings held in the open. There are times you have to 
make speeches on the street of in a small area where you 
work. Sometime you might even have to stand in court. 
There may also be some difference according to the season, 
like spring, summer, fall, and winter, and even between 
morning, afternoon and evening or night. 
To make detailed remarks about each of these 
cases would be almost impossible because of the infinite 
differences in the outward conditions. So, here in this 
book we will limit ourselves to the basic things to be 
noted and things we come across frequently in our daily 
life. 
First, we shall talk about the question of time. 
'Summer is warm, and winter is cold.' No one 
has to be told this foreknown fact. And quite naturally 
it is best to arrange any meeting during the summer to be 
held in a cool place, and in winter to be held at a time 
of the day that may not be too cold. Whether indoors or 
- 36 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
outdoors, you must have this most common fact in mind. 
To open or close a window and, in case of a street meeting, . 
to consider the direction of the wind are all done for the 
sake of the audience. If the audience becomes bored mainly 
because of the heat, or if they have to stand shivering in 
the cold, it will most likely be impossible to get good 
listening. 
To make speeches in a loud annoying voice early 
in the morning or again late in the night is something we 
should know not to do as common sense. 
Differences in weather and climate are great 
between Hokkaido and Kagoshima. There are also different 
customs according to the regions. These differences should 
be carefully considered. 
Next, let us take a look at speeches made out of 
doors, expecially in the streets. Here we must be careful 
about the following disadvantages. 
First, the audience usually is not a stable crowd. 
Secondly, there are constant bothering noises. 
Thirdly, we never can tell when it might begin 
to rain or blow, or when any other emergency may come up. 
Fourthly, it is very possible that interference 
(such as antagonists, police, or traffic, etc.) will come 
In. From such circumstances, we know that it is impossible 
to make long, complicated talks. We must try to make our 
arguments short and precise and to speak clearly and _ 
- 37 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
impressively. The thing is to impress the audience. The 
speaker should stand on a box or something to make himself 
seen, at least the upper half of his body, from the whole 
crowd. The speaker's gestures should be more exaggerated 
than the gestures he usually makes indoors. The voice 
should be louder and in a higher pitch. This is only 
natural in order to surmount all the hindrances and to 
keep the attention of the crowd. 
Even though the speaker may be very good and is 
able to draw a large crowd, it is quite impossible to hold 
that crowd longer than an hour. Physical conditions will 
not allow this. 
It is best not to let anyone stand behind the 
speaker, It is not only very inconvenient for the speaker 
to have someone listening behind him but is also liable 
to cause trouble. If such places can be found, it is 
best for the speaker to stand with a wall or a fence or 
a small hill behind him. 
When using the microphone, especially when the 
microphone is a good one, be careful not to make it blare 
out too loudly. It is far more effective to keep the volume 
down so as to be just right for your crowd and in consider-
ation with the surroundings. A blaring microphone may 
bring adverse reactions. 
Even outdoors, there may be places like parks 
- 38 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
and squares where several hundred or a thousand persons 
can gather for the purpose of listening to a speech. 
Under such conditions it may be possible to settle down 
and make a fairly long speech, but still it will be very 
difficult to achieve the sort of intimate atmosphere that 
you would be able to get in a hall. 
In cases of large meetings such as those held 
on May Day Eve, May Day, National Conventions or Comme-
morative Meetings where there will be huge crowds of 
thousands and more, the conditions for the speakers are 
just about the same as we have mentioned so far. 
In regards to the microphone it must be said 
that fast talking should be avoided. Each word must be 
pronounced clearly and slowly and the speech itself should 
be short and impressive. The microphone probably will be 
turned up to its highest volume and, if so, unclear and 
running pronunciations may all emerge as meaningless noise, 
The larger the crowd is the more careful you 
must be to remember this: If you talk into the microphone 
as you would in a small meeting, then most likely your 
voice will become all mixed up and the audience will not 
be able to grasp a word of you are saying. Ordinarily 
you may think it too slow, but under such conditions slow 
speaking may not even be slow enough. Speak slowly and 
clearly.

In court or when you are standing in front of 
a demonstrating group of people, that is, when there is 
an audience behind you, you must be careful about your gesis 
tures. In speaking, remember that the crowd is behind you 
and try to make your voice bounce back from the wall in 
front of you. Otherwise your speech will become very 
weak. 
Speeches made in the place where you work can 
be made under numerous conditions. Since it is impossible 
to touch on all these different conditions we will leave 
it out. 
Basically it is the one same thing: The impor-
tant thing is to take y-mr stand in the crowd, with the 
crowd and for the crowd. Sacrifice yourself and cry out 
for the people. 
On the other hand, no matter how passionate you 
may be, you must also be cool. You must do all you can 
to consider the conditions of the place and the time best 
suited for the people. Do not part from the people. It 
is as clear as day that any speech made from a position 
too fax above the common people will result in a tragic 
failure. 
b. Response And Jeers 
?  
Applause and jeers, along with cheers and 
- 11-0 ? 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
murmurings, are all responses and expressions of the 
audience. The speaker should in his turn catch on sensi-
tively to these expressions and react to them effectively. 
In Japan, since the history of speech itself is 
so short, manners in clapping hands and jeering are not 
as refined as in foreign countries. Yet, if we listen 
carefully we can distinguish these expressions from the 
applause. 
1. expressing agreement 
2. expressing an urge 
3. expressing a demand to stop 
Lf. expressing i interference 
5. expressing deep admiration 
6. expressing perfunctory gratitude 
The speaker and the chairman should be able to understand 
these differences. 
Whatever the case may be, during the applause, 
the speakerrs voice cannot be heard. Here the speaker 
should pause for a while and after asking the crowd to 
quiet down by some gesture (raising your hand as to stop 
something is most common), go an with the speech. 
When you find that the crowd wants you to stop 
or is interfering with the speech you must quickly grasp 
the cause of this discontent and do something about it. 
If you try to force ybur speech through without really 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
having that much ability, the meeting is apt to end up 
In great confusion, 
If you think you have the ability and are confident, 
you can tell the crowd this, 'There seems to be many among 
you who disagree or are not satisfied with what I have 
been trying to tell you. But please bear with me for a 
little while longer. From what I have said so far it may 
be difficult to understand what I really want to say  
And after saying this much you can go on to tell them your 
honest opinion undauntedly. 
When you know that the applause is an expression 
of agreement and appreciation you should respond with at 
least a smile, although it is unnecessary to bow. 
After all, the speaker should by all means try 
to react positively to the responses the audience makes. 
This will certainly be a great help in heightening the sense 
of unity and will further the smooth communication of 
intimacy. By all means try not to let the audiences' res-
ponse go by without any reaction on the speaker's part. 
Next, let us talk about the jeers. Here again 
we can divide them into the following different expres-
sions. Probably the most convenient distinction is: 
1. jeers expressing disagreement 
2. jeers expressing incomprehension 
3. jeers that are nothing but a lot of hot air 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R007?Ann9nnni 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
4? jeers meant for interference which can 
be done individually and in union. 
The speakers now have a microphone on their side 
while the people who jeer do not. So actually it is best, 
especially for speakers who are not used to jeering, to 
go right ahead with their speeches ignoring the jeers. But 
in case you do not have a microphone and the jeering can 
be heard just as loud as your speech then you should say, 
'Wait! I think I can answer that ' or, 'Exactly! Why 
you have to say such things is itself the main problem....' 
of, 'All right! Let us take a look at what you are saying.. 
..e. ' Of course, you do not have to say the same thing, 
but the important thing is to restrain the excited feeling 
and at the same time to change your own strategy. 
Formerly, there were people who would stand up 
in their awn seats and begin their ywn speeches, but 
recently this kind of thing has become very rare. 
No jeering will last longer than thirty seconds. 
Most of them will stop in about ten seconds. During this 
short time the speaker should wait patiently and listen 
to what the person is trying to say. If you can stand 
there without becoming confused and flurried then it is 
quite impossible for the jeerers to upset you. 
Unless you have a very good and loud voice or 
the microphone is in extremely good condition, you should

not try to bear down and talk over the jeering. If you 
make the audience feel that you are being pushed by the 
jeering then you have lost the battle in speech. Try to 
hold your composure all the time and rout the jeering. 
When you are not too sure about yourself in 
the face of jeering, you must be caceful from the begin-
ning not to let the crowd jeer you while even if they do, 
you should try to let it pass by. Above anything else 
finish your speech before this interference comes in. 
The best way to understand how to conquer any 
type of jeering is not by logic, but by going to a meet-
ing and doing some jeering yourself. 
c. Emergencies and Interference 
The hall may suddenly be thrown intb_darkness 
because of an electricity accident, or the microphone may 
stop functioning, or some part of the hall may fall, and 
a commotion may arise. Such emergencies may arise. At 
the same time in all cases you must be prepared for some 
kind of interference from your adversaries. 
When there are such emergencies or interference, 
the most important thing is for the speaker to stay com-
posed. You should not be confused and become excited. 
Try to stay as cool as possible and think how you calm the 
listeners. Of course, at the same time something should

be done about the accident. 
Here is an interesting episode about an emer-
gency in England. A lady, who was apparently a member 
of Parliament, was making a speech when someone of the 
opposition party shouted, 'Fire! Fire!' The hall was 
thrown into a turmoil, but the speaker perceived this to 
be a false alarm and, in a very composed voice, started to 
sing, 'God save our gracious King 17 the national 
anthem. This calmed the audience down and she continued 
her speech. 
In short, when you are standing on the platform, 
all the eyes of the audience are on you and so when there 
is any interference by adversaries the thing you must do 
is to get those ayes back to you as soon as possible and 
then act in the most sensible way. 
The most important thing to remember when speak-
ing to a large crowd is to have a firm hold on the people 
and to keep them in order. This is the first step to the 
prevention of any type of emergency or accidents among 
the people. During the time of the meeting the speaker 
should consider his life to be in the good hands of the 
audience, but at the same time he should also be conscious 
of the fact that the lives of the people in the audience 
are in his responsible hands. This realization is very 
importantt.

Not all people can chance on an emergency and 
face up with it squarely. They learn how to handle these 
difficulties through experience and failures. But what 
is really important is being constantly alert. 
If we realize that our first duty is to serve 
the common people, then it would be impossible to run 
away in the face of an emergency for the sake of saving 
our own lives. It is only from one's willingness to take 
such a disadvantage and t6 sacrifice oneself that a sublime 
spirit to lead the common people arises. You may think 
yourself to be awfully superior and 'big', but if it is 
nothing sincere, the thin veneer will soon wear off in the 
face of a sudden emergency. 
Let us assume that there were a fire in the hall 
where you are making your speech. Unless you are prepared 
to tell the people in the crowd very clearly and with 
composure the safest way out, and you yourself are prepared 
to stay in the hall to the very last to see that all the 
people have left the place safely, then you are not qua-
lified to be a speaker. 
But, on the other hand, it is more important to 
make thorough preparations in connection with the hall so 
that such emergencies will not occur. These preparations 
must be made before the meeting is held and greatest care 
should be given in going over all the details. Of course,

the main responsibility for all this preparation should be. 
taken by the sponsors, but the speaker also should always 
be aware of what is going on in the hall, and make sure 
how he Should go around in preventing any emergencies. 
d. Humor and Wit 
The string of a bow, if always kept too tightly 
strung will, because of the conkant tension, become 
slack." The same can be said of man's nerves. If you 
keep them in a tight and attentive condition for too long 
a time, they are apt to become tired and slack. 
In a meeting where there are to be many speakers, 
you may be alloted thirty minutes for your speech, but you 
must remember that the audience has been listening to other 
speakers for perhaps an hour before or even two to three 
hours continuously. 
It becomes very important to break the tension in 
the audience somewhere. And it is here where humor and 
wit come in. 
A forced laugh will probably only irritate the 
people, but elegant humor, witty remarks, and smooth 
satire are usually very agreeable. 
To laugh is a comfort to man and a very healthy 
release. But then how can this laugh be made? 
A laugh can be produced when certain rules are 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release  50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81_n1naqPnn'Yznry)Qtv-1,14 
;.? 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
applied wisely. 
The first key is association. Here are some 
examples. 
'When the Yoshida "Tosa dog" Cabinet tumbled, 
and the Hatoyama "Dove" Cabinet arose, the majority of 
the people thought that perhaps the dove would be a little 
more peaceful than the dog. This was the beginning of a 
mistake. Of course, it is only natural to think that a 
dove is quieter than a dog, but the trouble was that the 
dove of Hatoyama was not the "peace dove" drawn by 
Picasso. This Hatoyama dove was nothing but a carrier 
pigeon dispatched by the United States Forces.' 
Now, this is a satire based on an association 
with the dove (which word appears in Hatoyama's name). 
It is not too good an example, but in this way you can 
refer to animals to help arouse some kind of an associa-
tion. You can usually cause laughter with this key. 
The next key is a play on words. 
'I believe that the words used for the present 
JIYU MINSHU PARTY (Liberal Democratic Party) are wrong. 
It should be "self-playing" (JIYU) and "sleepy-wine" 
(MINSHU) party. I really can't think of any other better 
word.' 
This type of play on words can be applied to 
practically anything. But at the same time you should be 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-0104f1Pnn9qnno,v-Inr11 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
- - 
careful because unless the pun is very good the audience 
is apt to jeer you down shouting "poor pun!" You must be 
sure to use only bright puns. 
The third key is to resolve a statement of 
seemingly contradictory remarks into one final object. 
For instance, 'The buildings of the Tokyo Metropolitan 
Government, The National Defense Board, and the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Forestry are all new and very much 
after the western style, but if you ask me they are 
actually no better than the TATAMI mats of a poor tene-
ment house the more you bat them the more dust comes 
out.' 
The fourth key is to point out serious contra-
dictions. 'The Hat oyama government, when it came into 
power, promised an early restoration of relations with 
Soviet Russia. Consequently, if they could succeed in 
restoring normal relations between Japan and the Soviet 
UnionlAdagy would have been accused of breaking a promise. 
Then, of course, they would have had to give up their 
cabinet. But on the other hand John Foster Dulles tells 
them not to open up relations with the Soviet. If this 
government loses Dulles' support, it will be just like 
taking Shigemitsu's crutches away - the cabinet would 
have nothing to do but collapse. They are in a very 
similar position s Shigemori of the Taira clan was because 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release  50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01n4f1Pnn9qnnormr11 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
if they wish to be faithful to the United States then they 
cannot be loyal to the people of Japan. If they wish 
to be loyal to the people of Japan, then they apparently 
cannot be faithful to the United States. Now the time 
has come where we must watch to see whether the "HATO" ? 
(dove) will give up or whether the people will cry, "so 
what (so wat...so viet) did I tell you!" Either way this 
cabinet doesn't seem to have too. long a life.' 
Now, beyond these four keys there are two or 
three more complicated and professional ways of making 
people laugh. But our purpose here is not so much to 
tell you any superb way of making people laugh as to call 
your attention to some ways of relieving the tension in 
the crowd who may be getting tired after listening for a 
long time. 
There is no way to give really adequate instances 
of wit. Wit has to come spontaneously. It has to flow 
from the mouth of the speaker fluently and in response to 
the subtle changes and expressions of the audience. 
You have to be careful all the time in order to catch 
this subtle movement in the crowd. You will have to be 
very sensitive. You will also have to be very alert. 
Try to read thedaily papers, listen to the radio, note 
the conversations on the street, and observe the opinions 
expressed at public meetings.

e. Debate Meetings 
Recently, debate meetings have come to be held 
very f?equently. A debate is not as simple as a public 
speech. 
First, you must find out before-hand as much as 
you can about the opponent. You will have to base your 
arguments and strategy upon the knowledge you have of this 
opponent. Of course, you must make sure what the aim of 
the debate will be by asking the sponsor of the meeting. 
Second, you must know what kind of people will 
be gathering to hear the debate. 
Third, you must be sure of just how much you 
can say within the time given you. You will have to 
prepare arguments to back up your initial argument. 
These and other important points related to the sub-
ject should be written down carefully in notes. 
Fourth, listen very carefully to what your 
adversary has to say and do not forget to take notes of 
his main points. 
Fifth, try to make as wide and careful a sur-
vey as possible to see what the general public thinks 
about the particular subject in question. 
Sixthly, the debate should be conducted calmly 
and politely, and you shOuld try not to become emotional. 
51 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
All in all, the final decision of a debate 
must be made by the audience and so you should be care-
ful not to become absorbed in efforts to subdue your 
adversary. The important thing is to proceed with your 
debate with the idea of convincing as many people as 
possible in the crowd. No matter how rough your adversary 
may be in presenting his arguments, do not fall tit for 
tat. You should be calm and logical, and you should 
try to present your argument with the purpose of proving 
to the people how right it is. In a debate the one who 
becomes excited and emotional is the loser. 
At the same time you should be very careful 
about the time limit you have to present your argument. 
If you insensitively go right on talking into the time 
allottJd for other people, it will be very difficult for 
you to win the sympathy of the people. The time may be 
limited, but it is entirely up to you to present your 
argument Eall tnfute your opponent within this given time. 
Since doing so much is the true purpose of a debate meet-
ing, you should do your best to practice for it. 
8. What The Chairman Should Know 
We have written about the chairman of a mass 
meeting in the next section, so in this section we shall 
confine ourselves to pointing out a few important things 
- 52 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
? 
V*: 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
that the chairman of a speech meeting should bear in mind. 
In speech meetings of the past, the chairman 
seemed merely to be the person who saw to the smooth 
management of the meeting or the person who introduced 
the speakers. There should be more for him to do. 
The chairman is the person who presides over 
the entire meeting. He should see that tie meeting pro-
ceed b Smoothly and to achieve this, he should be very 
careful in all details. He should make all efforts to 
unburden the speaker from any unnecessary encumbrances 
and atthe same time to make conditions favorable for the 
listeners. In other words he must take on all responsi-
bilities for the management and functioning of the meet-
ing. In face of an emergency, the chairman should help 
the speaker in finding temporary measures to bring safety. 
The chairman should first know very well what the 
purpose of the meeting is. He must know as much as he 
can about the kind of people who are expected to come 
to the meeting. -He should also know accurately about 
the background of the speaker, about his facilities and 
his characteristics. After all this information, he 
should keep in touch with the prompter and mind the time 
and preside over the meeting. 
Expecially, in a public speech meeting where 
several speakers may come up on the platform, the chair-
man is, from begining to end, the one man presiding 
- 53 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Cop Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-A 
? 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
through the entire meeting. .Consequently, he must be 
the person who grasps the feeling of the people in the 
audience. 
The chairman need not say too much, but he must 
show enough sincerity to win the confidence of the people. 
Ee shouE,A do all he can to improve the atmos-
phere of the meeting. To do this he must keep close 
contact with all the other people in charge of different 
things in the hall. He should see to it that all the 
seats are taken care of. He must, worry about the ven-
tilation and the microphone, and keep an eye on all the 
people who come in or go out of the hall. In this way 
he should try to keep the hall always in optimum condi-
tion and thus leave it to the speaker to do his best. 
At the same time, when one of the speakers is 
making his speech the chairman should see that the next 
speaker is ready and that the program is all going well. 
He should constantly be thinking about the best effect 
in carrying on with the meeting and accordingly should 
make most careful preparations. These preparations must 
be carried out. 
There are many speech meetings where the chair-
man presides merely as a symbol. The lighting ma be 
too dark and the faces of the speakers difficult to see, 
or the people coming in and going out may be very noisy, 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
yet the chairman just sits there and says nothing. Such 
examples are not infrequent, but of course such a person 
cannot be considered a true chairman. 
If the chairman comes to have more authority, 
he should be able to change the positions of some of the 
speakers. For instance, if one speaker makes a very 
serious speech, a speaker in a lighter vein could be 
brought in to relieve the tension, or after a man, a 
woman speaker could be placed. This type of shifting 
should be possible for good effects. 
When the chairman thinks it to be most effec-
tive, he should order a recess in the program, or order 
a rearrangement of the seating, or again he could take 
time out for lighting and ventilation. 
Having considered the duties of the chairman 
thus far, it becomes quite apparent that it has been a 
great mistake to consider tie duty of the chairman to be 
merely introducing the subjects and the names of the 
speakers. The responsibility of a chairman is very 
great. And the authority of a chairman becomes higher 
as he gradually shows ability to handle his responsibility 
successfully. 
This is the reason why the chairman should 
know all about the hall where the meeting is to be held. 
He should make a careful investigation and be sure that 
-55-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Co .y Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
every thing in the hall is in its right situation and 
condition - the entrances, corridors, toilets, waiting 
rooms, balconies, upper floors, ground floor and then the 
lighting, the source of the incoming electricity, the 
curtains, and the emergency exits. All of these places 
should be gone over. Unless he is quite sure about all 
these things, it will be very difficult for him to coope-
rate with the speakernin handling any emergency. 
The speaker, when he is on the platform can 
help in an emergency, but when he has to go around to 
some other meeting he will not be able to stay at one 
particular meeting from beginning to end and consequently 
will be unable to assume full responsibility. On the 
other hand, the chairman is the one who presides all 
through the one meeting and he is the one who must 
assume the responsibility. 
Such things as giving the audience infor-
mation(about no smoking, or the toilet, or about eating 
in the hall), or as relieving the crowd by making some 
witty remarks when too much tension is built up, or 
again conversely, when the crowd seems to be too noisy 
to bring it under control, or when introducing the 
speaker, instuad of just giving his name, to tell the 
audience a little about his background, characteristics 
and books he has written - all these things fall under 
- 56 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26:

the responsibility of the chairman. 
Many people know from experience how com-
fortable it is for the speaker to speak and how pleasant 
it is for the listeners to listen when a meeting is 
presided over by a good chairman. 
In the future we must endeavor with the cooper-
ation of all to educate good chairmans. If we just 
leave the matter to take its own course, it will be 
impossible to create a good and effective speech meeting. 
People who aspire to become speakers must seek 
opportunities for becoming chairmans and gain actual 
experience. These experiences are sure to be a great 
help to you in the future.

THE ROLE OF THE POSTER AND HOW TO MAKE THEM 
1. The Role Of The Poster 
The role of the poster and its importance can 
never be over emphasized. An attractive and friendly 
poster has much influence upon the people. When we think 
how the poster helps in furthering our activities, how 
it appeals to the people and makes them think and act, 
then we cannot possibly say that posters are useless. 
Everyday we look at numerous posters on the 
street corners, in street-cars or in buildings. Most of 
these posters use pictures, photographs, designs and 
cartoons, while there some that have only words. 
Some posters are in one color while there are lavish ones 
of many colors. When we also consider the size and the 
kind of paper used we can see that there are a large 
variety of posters. 
Primarily, the object of posters is to adver-
tise commercial goods, to announce public events or to 
tell of elections and other movements. When we look at 
these different types of posters, we recognize that all 
much 
of them have this/in common g they present to the fore-
most the one matter they want to publicize and all pains 
are taken to draw the attention of the people. 
_ 58 _ 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release  50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP8i-ninzr1Rnn9qnry-rzritin4 0 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
When we consider the poster, we should also 
place our aims along this line. The poster is referred 
to by some as 'a telegram in picture and word.' It 
should waste no words and it should attract the atten-
tion of the people. Not only should it tell one par-
ticular thing but it should also be so effective that 
it will remain in the memory of the persons who see it. 
This is why we must study the poster. Firtt, we shall 
reconsider our attitude towards posters. After that 
let us go on to how to make posters, how to use them 
and on to the experiences of various activities related 
to the poster. 
2. Understanding The Poster 
In the past we have always been too eager to 
make posters and post them around whenever an occasion 
arose. We would tell ourselves that each single poster 
was helping the revolution. Believing this, we would go 
around with a buckets of paste in our hands after our 
daily work. We did not mind our physical weariness nor 
the fact that we had to work during the night. We were just 
eager to get the posters posted. Sometimes posting 
posters itself got to be a very important part of our 
organizational work. This kind of activity had its 
merit. 
But recently there are trends to ignore the

? f? 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
relationship between the poster bf handbill and the 
common people. People are beginning to say that in the 
past we have been working too much with the walls and 
fences, atid they insist that we start working with the 
common people and try to further our ties with them. 
Of course what these people are saying has 
merit, especially insofar as it points oUt the defects 
of the narrow-sighted activities of the past. But when 
we give this matter further thought, we can see that 
both merits are only one-sided. If we look at only one 
side of the matter and refuse to admit the ugly part of 
the other side, we will not be able to strengthen our 
activities. 
In order to strengthen our ties with the com-
mon people, we must be able to convince and mobilize 
them. We firmly believe that history is made only by 
the common working people who are doing the productive 
work. We must learn from the experiences and the 
creativity of these people. We should be able to 
organize what we have learnt and to return it in this 
organized form to the people again. These activities 
will not only raise the common people but will also 
serve to raise ourselves. Thus we will be able to 
grasp the common people by thought. 
We cannot forget for a moment that or duty

is to seek direct tles withthe people and to have per-
sonal talks with them. But this alone is not sufficient. 
There is a limit to the limit of work one person can do 
in trying to make these personal contacts. Our activities 
will become narrow and limited if we rely only on this 
method. 
So it becomes very important to make indirect 
contacts with the people. This is the reason why 
various surveys have been made to find effective ways 
to increase our ties with the people, and this is why 
propaganda methods are being studied. When we think of 
the great current of mess communication being turned 
out by our enemies, we must use the most effective 
type of propaganda appropriate to the time and place. 
At the same time we will have to grasp accurately their 
objectives in infiltrating into the minds while also 
grasping the true thinking of the people. All this 
must be done by watching carefully theirs and our 
own propaganda. 
It must be apparent now that the poster is 
a very important weapon inxhieving closer ties with 
the people 
a. Posters That Have Taste 
Recently, commercial art has developed remark-
ably. Studies in propaganda art have also been extended. 
- 61 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-01041Rnn7Inn9qnnn1 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
We must learn frolv all of these studies. 
Yet we must not forget that our posters always 
have to exemplify the proletariat spirit, that there 
must be a flow of the common people',,, blood in its 
expressions. Our posters have to stand with the people. 
They have to fulfill a role in the betterment of the 
people. In other words, our posters have to say what , 
the people want to say. They must be able to express 
what the people want, from the standpoint of the people. 
Therefore, we want to make something that will make 
everybody say, 'Yet, this poster is different from an 
ordinary commercial poster. It is the kind of poster 
that we want.' We do not want poste's that are flashy 
or eccentric. We do not want any that cannot be under-
stood. What we want are posters that are bright, strong 
and fliendly. It is important that they be clear and 
clean. 
b. The People's Words, The People's Desires 
Recently we see many posters that have slogans 
in them or posters with slogans only. These slogans, 
if you wish, are the voices of the people. They should 
be words to which the people can say, 'That's right! 
I agree!' 
But there are times when we come upon posters 
that tell downright, in a commanding way, what should

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
be done - the kind in which the leaders are telling 
the people what they should do. There are also some 
posters that are abviously self-conceited. Such 
slogans will tend to repulse the people. They will 
just look at them and say, 'Alright you do what you 
want, but do not expect us to come along.' 
This is a problem of our mind. Our slogans 
must show that we are willing to suffer with the 
people, to struggle and fight and be happy with the 
people. Let us not be fancy with our words, but use 
the common living language of the people. The slogan 
will lose half of its effectiveness if we worry too 
much about the rhetoric, if we play too much with 
the words and clutter up our simple purpose. The 
phrases should be short and clear, so that they can be 
read at one glanc:e. If possible the words should 
have rhythm. 
When a series of small slogan posters are 
used as a set, the entire meaning is clear when they 
are posted in order. But we must be careful to see 
that each individual poster has a clear meaning in 
order to prevent confusion and misunderstanding. 
c. Well Designed Posters 
We often see on the walls of farm houses 
pictures taken from magazines and calendars. Such

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
pictures can be seen in other places, too. Even in the 
city, in dormitories and in boarding houses, we can see 
graphic pictures from magazines cut out and tacked on 
the walls. This is proof that the working people are 
locking for pictures of high artistic value. It is 
an expression of a very strong cultural desire. So you 
can see that we should try to make posters not only for 
political purposes but with a deep interest in art, and 
distribute them to the public. From past experiences 
we know that, even for political posters, fine posters 
showing the party spirit and exemplifying artistic work 
in a true sense are wanted by the people. We must have 
the cooperation of artists in our work. If possible, 
we should make, in this way, posters that people would 
even want to buy. 
d. Posters, A Publication 
A good poster should be something that people 
would want to buy with money. In our organization and 
in other democratic groups, we have been publishing 
posters financed by ourselves. We even distributed 
them free. This practice has actually encouraged the 
idea of considering posters as something cheap. The 
tendency to use posters as waste paper still pervades. 
To eliminate this habit we should establish 
the habit of selling posters unless it is a special 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP8i-ninaqpnn-rnmorw-,,,, 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
occasion for free posters. In the foreign Communist 
Parties the posters are printei by the publication 
section of the party and are sold. They are even sold 
through book stores. They consider the poster as a 
publication. We think that this is a very good thing 
in uniting the work of propaganda, finance and organi-
zation smoothly. 
3. Notes On Making And Distributing Posters 
a. Effective Posters 
The posters(handbills, also) should have a 
very clear central idea. You cannot possibly put 
everything into one small poster. Expecially when we 
realize that a poster appeals to the senses, we should 
bear this point in mind. 
When we walk down the street we can see all 
over the place all sorts of posters advertising and 
announcing things. But is would be fair to say that 
almost all of these advertisements and announcements 
do not impress the people enough to linger in their 
memory. There are also many that are difficult to 
understand and others that are simply disgusting. We 
should bear this in mind. But nevertheless, even these 
cheap posters will gradually hold a place in our minds 
If they are presented to us often enough. This cannot

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
be denied. This repetition is very important. 
Posters that are beautiful, posters to which 
we can agree wholeheartedly, posters that are attractive, 
made with soothing colors, have good slogans, neat 
letters and pictures, in other words, posters that are 
designed very effectively are the ones that are really 
impressive. 
We know by experience that posters for the 
motion pictures and for 'want ads' attract strong Atten-
tion. This is true even though the poster itself may 
not be too good. 
From what we have observed so far the follow-
ing things should be considered in making a good poster. 
1. Repetition is necessary (distribute in large 
numbers, widely and as often as possible) 
2. They should be posted in places that are 
sure to draw the most attention. 
3. They should be attractive, beautiful and 
friendly. 
4. They should be well-rounded but simple. 
5. They must match the feelings of the people. 
6. The message should be clear and simple. 
b. Notes On Making Posters 
We ask professional artists to design a 
poster for us with the idea of creating unique ones. 
-66-
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043RCM9mn9qnnni_R 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
But we often just go to them and ask them without making 
the idea too clear. The artist is asked to do the rest. 
Many times this results in posters that do not say what 
we want and in having to remake the whole thing. Thus 
we have to ask some one else and by doing this may put 
the prordssional artist to shame. No one gains from 
anything like this. 
On the other hand, there are times when we 
go to the artist and give him a thorough lecture on 
the political situation. After this we tell him what 
the content of the poster should be, how it should be 
done, what kind of a picture should be on it, where 
the slogan should come and practically tell him every-
thing as if he were a mere apprentice. This does not 
leave much room for the free creative mind of the 
artist to go to work. It limits the artist and what 
we get is a stylized poster without any appealing 
strength. Using the artist in this way does not help 
in our relation with him either. 
Furthermore, there are times when the artist 
comes forth with a wonderful original painting. But 
because of our lack of knowledge in printing(about color, 
size, proof sheets, etc.) it is possible that the ori-
ginal beauty of the painting is lost. In many cases 
we also have to take into consideration the artisan 
- 67 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr  2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-0104:1Rnn9qnn9-4nnni a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
'spirit of the printer. Otherwise again we will end 
up in getting a poster that lacks the original taste 
in the painting. These are bitter experiences. 
There have been numerous mistakes made in the 
distribution of the poster. The place was not just 
right or the time was wrong. Sometimes the preser-
vation of material was bad and caused us a great loss 
financially in that we have had to buy the same material 
again. There were times when we thought that a certain 
poster was so important that, it superceded everything, 
even money. Plunging into the production of this poster 
without adequate plans has caused us to suffer for not 
being able to pay the printers when the posters were 
completed. Again there have been times when we made 
too many posters or were too late and had to pile them 
up in the corner of the room to collect dust. There 
were also times when we did not have enough time to 
distribute the posters and had to post them all in one 
place. We realize that we suffered much from not 
having made systematic studies about our posters along 
with surverys concerning their influence upon the 
people. 
We think the following points are important 
in making a poster. 
1. In making a poster, the opinions of many 
-68-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Co .y Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
people should be considered. 
2. The opinions of artists should be respected, 
and they should be allowed to give expres-
sion to their free creative talents. 
3. Definite financial and other work plans 
should be made based on our own strength 
and the strength of our cooperators. 
4. Geographical conditions(for instance, places 
to post, places likely to draw attention, 
etc.) should be investigated. 
5. Surveys and studies concerning the pro-
duction work should always be made. 
Expecially surveys on the reaction of the 
posters should not be forgotten. 
6. practical and technical knowledge should 
be kept in mind. 
7. Materials and equipments needed to make 
posters should be well-preserved. 
We have now given you a brief outline of the 
role of posters and how they can be made, but this does 
not mean that all posters should be left to professional 
artists for completion. We, in the past, have valuable 
experiences in making hand-painted posters ourselves. 
Let us not hesitate in studying the methods of making 
posters and in actually making them. After this, we

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
should try always to reflect upon our past work. Comple-
ted posters will probably teach us much and by learning 
from these posters we should continue our endeavors in 
improving them.

KNaWLEDGE OF 8 MM MOVIES 
1. The Present State of 8 mm Movies 
Recently we often see in the newspapers and 
weekly magazines such words as 18 mm. cine' or 'home 
movie'. In the city it is not unusual any longer to 
see someone taking movies with a small movie camera. It 
Is indeed surprising to see the amazing development of 
the 8 mm. eine camera in the last two or three years. 
This new cine camera will probably be the next boom in 
this country. 
This new eine camera gets its name from the 
width of the film used, which is 8 mm. The 16 mm(used 
mainly for making films of portable purposes) and .15 mm  
(used mainly for theater films) are also called so from 
the width of the film used. 
Generally speaking the Japanese people like 
cameras. This characteristic seems to be world famous, 
and indeed, it is probably because of this basic chara-
cteristic that the new 8 mm. and other small sized 
cameras are coming to attract a great many enthusiasts. 
a. The Reason For The Enthusiasm In 8 mm. Movies 
There are reasons for this widespread popu-
larity in 8 mm. movies. In the past such a hobby was 
- 71 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr  2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043Rnn9mn9qnnni_g 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
possible only among the more privileged salarymen and 
the bourgeoisie. But recently the 8 mm. cameras are 
being manufactured in this country and the manufacturers, 
foreseeing a bright future for these miniature cameras, 
have planned the production on a mass production basis. 
Therefore they can be purchased fairly cheaply while 
the handling is not too complicated. 
Among amateur photographers, interest is 
shifting from 'still' photos to 'moving' pictures. 
These small cine cameras fulfill the desire of these 
amateurs very conveniently. Furthermore, the profes-
sional motion picture distributors have ilso started to 
handle these small films seriously. They realize the 
great possibility in the futwe for these small films 
in the field of visual education. One of the reasons 
for the popularity of these films is because the dis-
tributors are advancing the practical use of them. 
Even the manufacturers are extending their 
work to the field of 8 mm. films by transcribing larger 
films into this smaller size. They are also conducting 
research into the possibility of making 8 mm. talkies. 
This all points to a brighter future and more popularity 
for the 8 mm. camera. 
b. How The 8 mm. Movies Are Being Used 
Formerly the 8 mm. camera was used to take 
pictures of the family or friends. Some people have 
- 72 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-0104:1Rnn9qnn9-4nnni a 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
centered their pictures upon certain subjects, like 
scenes of his country side, or pictures introducing 
works of handcraft or art. Some people have even exper-
imented in making dramatic pictures. Recently, the 8 mm. 
is being used by labor unions and other democratic 
organizations. The National Tax Office labor union, the 
National Railway labor unionlithe Peace Committee, or 
the Kanagawa Branch of the Social Party are using 8 mm. 
movie cameras. Although the general trend is still 
towards personal use and rather weak in the direction 
of uses for organizational work, still, the National Tax 
Office labor union has been taking movies of their col-
lective bargaining and other news pictures about their 
strikes, and distributing them to their local chapters. 
They were also planning to take technicolor movies of 
the 1957 May Day rally. During the struggles at 
Sunagawa over the Air Base extension dispute in 1956, 
the Kanagawa branch of the Social Party took a full 
documentary df the event. We presume that there are 
members among the various labor unions wh may have 
8 mm. cameras. It is necessary to get the cooperation 
of these people and to establish 8 mm. movies as a 
very effective weapon in our propaganda work.

2. Practical Questions Concerning The 8 mm. 
a. Finances Of The 8 mm. 
How much does it cost to have and use a 
8 mm. camera? Many people think that it would cost a 
great deal. Of course, the amount would differ accord-
ing to the kind of camem you buy and what accessories 
you intend to buy with it. But actually, for practical 
use it is not too expensive. 
Here is a rough estimate of what the cost 
would be like. 
Camera Japanese camera...middle class: 23-7000 yen 
to 34,000 yen. This is just about right for 
our uses. 
Projector 24,000 yen to 38,000 yen. This will get you 
a good purchase. 
Film Connector and cement about 2,000 yen 
These three things are musts. Besides these it would 
help to have the following things. 
Editor 4-5,000 yen to 12,000 yen. 
Titler 1,000 yen to 4,000 yen. This unit is used 
to put titles into your pictures. It is not 
necessary if you think you can do the titling 
yourself. 
If you have these things you will-be able to handle 
almost any kind of movie and show them. The total

.?11. 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
cost of all these items of enuipment is still cheaper 
than the cost of the Canon VT type camera. Nowadays, 
there are stores where you can purchase material through 
the easy payment method. 
b. The Films 
The films sold on the market are 25 feet long, 
In taking the pictures you use the film both ways which 
makes it double in length or 50 feet. Projected, this 
will give you a four minute movie. 
The cost for films is: 
Ordinary black and white 750 yen (including deve-
- -4,-, 
1 , , 
loping) 
Technicolor 1,700 yen 
Now, when we say one roll makes a four minute 
movie, it sounds awfully short, but when it comes to 
taking the pictures it is not so easy. From experi-
ence twenty scenes is just about enough. This means 
that each scene should be about ten to fifteen seconds 
long. 
Take the cuts in the newsreels you see at 
the theater. The entire news is about ten minutes and 
each cut is from five to fifteen seconds. There are 
some cuts that last as long as thirty seconds, but in 
such cases you may feel that it is rather too long 
So you can see that in four minutes you can actually 
- 75 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-010411Rnn9-4nn9qnnnl 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
take a lot of scenes. 
Let us take a look at the film from the view 
point of cost. For instance, if we compare the 8 mm. 
with the twenty exposure 35 mm. film used in the Canon 
camera, the 35 mm. film will cost you 220 yen, deve-
loping will be 60 yen, and printing will be about 20 yen 
a piece for the brownie size which will be thus total 
about 500 yen. Altogether the cost will come to 780 yen. 
Even with an ordinary camera you can never be 
sure of getting twenty good pictures. So when you take 
everything into consideration, it may be possible to 
manage the 8 mm. camera more economically. With news-
reels it is commonly understood that two to three times 
the length actually used must be taken to get the pic-
tures needed. When you ace planning for films you 
should take this into consideration too. But on the 
whole, the 8 mm. movie has a very wide ralage of pra-
ctical use. Therefore, if you purposely and consciously 
use 8 mm. movies for propaganda purposes and cultural 
enlightenment, you can never tell how valuable the 
effect will be. 
c. Professionalizing The 8 mm. Movie 
Apart from commercial movies, the one advan-
tage 8 mm. movies have is the inexpensiveness of film 
and convenience in handling.

.^: 
After the recent war, the 16 mm. movies have 
become professionalized. Before the war they were 
classified as amateur. It was during the war that the 
16 mm. movies proved to be far more convenient for 
carrying around than the regular 35 mm. movies. 
Machines for 16 mm. movies also made rapid progress 
and thus this type of movie came to establish itself 
firmly. After the war the 16 mm. emerged as the favo-
rite movie for portable use and came to be used very 
widely in schools and other organizations. But still 
there remain problems economically speaking. 
Under such circumstances the 8 mm. has been 
attracting attention. Talkies for the 8 mm. and the 
duplicating of 8 mm. films both were formerly considered 
unfeasible. Sucess has been achieved in breaking 
through these limittions and consequently the movie 
distributors are paying much attention to future deve-
lopment. 
It is time that the 8 mm. movie has something 
very appropriate in fitting into the present situation 
of Japan. Compared to the 200,000 yen or more needed 
for a 16 mm. projector alone, the cost for the 8 mm. 
would be only one third including the king of pictures, 
the editing and all the necessary equipment. Further-
more, with he 16 mm. systems one reel of film would

cost 25,000 yen, whereas if you use the 8 mm. you can 
buy from four to five reels with the same amount of 
money. From these facts it is easy to understand why 
the 8 ram. is being appreciated when used for audio-visual 
education. You can do much more even within the com-
paratively cheap limit of this field. Another thingJis 
the fact that even the very humble people can now make 
their own movies any way they want to. People who have 
been making their productions with slides have now an 
entirely new field to look forward to in the future. 
d. The Effectiveness Of The 8 mm. Movie. 
There may be some persons who still think 
that the 8 mm. movie belongs in the category of toys. 
They think that, at the most, only about five to six 
people can enjoy looking at these movies in a small 
room. But actually, the 8 mm. does not suffer so much 
in comparison with 16 mm. movies. 
With a projector manufactured in Japan you 
can get a projection on a screen about nine feet across 
and six feet down. The distance from the projector to 
the screen would be tout ten yards and could probably 
be shown to a crowd of 500. The above example is the 
maximum. Ideal conditions would be for a projection of 
about a little over four feet across, three and a half 
feet down at a distance of about five yards. This would

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
be just about right for about 50 to a 100 persons. In 
other words, such showings would be aproppriate for 
classrooms or smaller gatherings in homes. The 8 mm. 
movies are gaining a reputation of their own. We 
believe that in the future 16 mm. movies will be used 
for large eF,semblies and the 8 mm. movies for smaller 
meetings. 
3. The Application and Future Of 8 mm Movies 
Needless to say, propaganda and enlightenment 
through the audio and visual senses have great effecti-
veness. But when we want to do something in the line 
of audio-visual education in our homes, wor4 places, 
within labor union activities or other organizational 
work, it seems, under the present situation, that slides 
are still the most convenient. In fact, the readiness 
with which we can use slides and its characteristic 
of being able to be made exactly as we want them seems 
to supersede the use of any commercial or ready-made 
movies. If we could only make movies with the con-
venience and precise purpose of these slides, the effect 
would be far greater. Any one who has had experience 
in active propaganda can see this point. 
So far, there have been many documentary 
productions of our struggle in life, very vividly done, 
-79-

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
in slides. But how much more impressive these expres-
sions would be if we could only put them into action 
through the use of 8 mm. movies! 
We also have dreams for the future. If we 
could only transcribe regular movies onto the more 
convenient 8 mm. film; if we could only equip ourselves 
with an 8 mm. camera and projector and document our 
class struggles and then show them widely to our own 
organizations and the public; or if only we could docu-
ment various news events from different parts of the 
land; if we could produce films for propaganda and 
educational purposes, how greater our range of activities 
would grow. For this we ourselves must work very hard, 
while at the same time we must secure the cooperation 
of professional movie makers.

HOW TO CARRY OUT PORTABLE MOVIE ACTIVITIES 
1. What Is A Portable Movie 
We are now interested in the number of peo-
ple who go to see movies, not in the regular movie 
thePters but outside of them. According to a survey, 
the aggregate number of such persons is approximately 
500 million for a year. The same survey tells us that 
the aggregate number of people who go to see movies in 
the regular theaters amounts to somewhere around 900 
million. So compared to this number, the 500 million 
is not in the least small. 
These 500 million people are seeing movies 
that come around to their villages or to the schools. 
Of course, the children who see movies used for audio-
visual educational purposes are included in this number. 
At present, the projector used most commonly 
for these portable movies is the 16 mm. projector. The 
number of these 16 mm. projectors being moved around 
all over the country is estimated to be about 40 
thousand, and surveys show that 500 new projOctors 
are being purchased every month. Besides these 16 mm. 
machines a number of portable 35 mm. projectors are 
also moving around. 
The influence of the movie is greater because 
it can be shown much more conveniently than dramatic

plays. This is the reason why various government offices 
and companies are using very actively the portable movie 
for their respective purposes. 
2. Various Portable Movie Activities 
The Library of the Educational Agency...This 
library bases its aim on the recreational desires of 
the people. The contents of the films.have strong 
tendencies of preserving the characteristics of the 
feudal social order. 
Portable Movies of the Professional Enter-
tainers...Their purpose is nothing but money. They 
will show anything entertaing for a cheap price. 
Movies Sponsored by Commercial Firms and 
Companies...Portable movies sponsored by department 
stores, drug companies, or newspapers are included 
in this category. These movies are solely for adver-
tising purposes. These people have the mopey to make 
these films and with these films they go into the 
hinterlands where there are no other recreational faci-
lities. The influence of these films is great indeed. 
Portable Movies used by Democratic Organi-
zations and Labor Unions...Fundamentally their purpose 
is to change the way of thinking of the people, but 
at the same time try to fulfill the recreational 
-82-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
desires of the people. Recently their activities have 
become very vigorous. 
There -are labor unions that have appropriated 
budgets for portable movies. They began with propaganda 
and educational activities within the union, but now 
they are wiring into the rural and urban areas to get 
into closer contact with the farmers, the workers and 
citizens through the same propaganda and educational 
activities. 
The most active of the labor unions in these 
movie activities is the National Railway Workers Union. 
It has more than 4o projectors working fully over the 
country. At headquatters they have a Film Center and 
close to a hundred films are prepared for use. In the 
Tokyo area they als.D have more than a hundred profes-
sional camera technicians to do the work. These films 
are shown at the places of their work, in homes, at 
their meetings, and in rural villages. 
Now, the National Communication Workers, the 
National Telegraph Workers, The National Locomotive 
Workers and other large unions are preparing to make 
Film Centers. Their various activities are also so 
numerous that all of them can fardly be listed here. 
For instance, the Tobu Traffic Labor union has a regular 
program of showing movies to the people who live along 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
their railway line. These people have come to under-
stand the labor movement as a constructive movement that 
gives them pleasure, and not as a red-flag-waving orga-
nization that does nothing but go on strikes. The 
Niigata branch of the National Railway Workers Union 
has made a movie titled 'The People Who Sow' and thus 
has brought a closer tie between the farmers and the 
other people. In Kyushu and Yamaguchi we hear that the 
Teachers' Union and other unions made movies to support 
their candidates in elections and thus increased the 
votes for the reform faction in the rural areas. 
Besides these domestic activities, there are 
also international activities going on with Soviet 
Russia, the Chinese Peoples' Republic or the People's 
Republic of Korea. 
We hope that from such movie activities even-
tually there will be born productions of our own. 
Activities of the United States Information 
Service...During the Occupation the United States 
realized the great impact of the movie and distributed 
very widely the so-called C.I.E. movies. Through the 
Social ani Education Section of the prefectural govern-
ments the C.I.E. equipped all town and village halls 
with a 16 mm. projector and trained technicians to use 
them. By distributing movies showing the American way

of living they at the same time used the opportunity 
to propagandize against Soviet Russia and Communism. 
After the Peace Treaty was signed they transferred all 
these items of equipment to the custody of the Ministry 
of Education. American Cultural Centers were established 
all over the country and they even enforced their acti-
vities by contributing special automobiles for the 
purpose of moving libraries. 
At present it is said that there are three 
thousand 16 mm.(NATCO) projectors and 800 films on 
600 different subjects and that 50 new films are being 
sent over every year. The number of people who see 
these movies through the year is said to be about 150 
million. 
Activities Sponsored by the Ministry of 
Education...Recently USIS movies are not very popular. 
So now the Ministry of Education is appropriating every 
year a budget of about 70 million yen for the production 
of educational movies. The Ministry purchases all the 
productions and then distributes them to the prefec-
tural educational councils free of charge. Thus they 
are apparently trying to centralize the control of 
educational.films. Recently a reform has been made in 
the system of the educational council and for the Tokyo 
district an Inspection Board for Educational Films has 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6

.4. 
been established. This indicates a revival of controls. 
Activities Sponsored by the Monopolistic 
Capitalists in their Productivity Improvement Movement 
...They center their public relation activities around 
the Labor Policy Section of the prefectural government 
and set their sights specifically at the medium and 
smaller enterprises. They are also playing an impor-
tant role in the labor management of factories. We 
should bear in mind their way of moving into the minds 
of the workers through such monpolistic methods. 
The Audio Visual Library. ..As far as edu-
cational films are concerned, in 1955 48o were pro-
duced while during the first half of 1956 already 
close to 300 have been produced. This library purchases 
these films and maintains and uses them. There about 
600 such libraries throughout the nation. 
The movement to establish film libraries in 
as many districts of Japan as possible grew actively 
during the two years since the National Educational 
Movie Promotion Convention was held in August, 1954, 
and now, there are many film libraries that have 
become independent and are managing their own affairs. 
They seem to have superseded the bureaucratic controls 
of the Ministry of Education. 
The Audio-visual Libraries in the different

districts of Japan are becoming more active as the 
movies are beginning to be used for educational pur-
poses in the schools. But an the other hand there 
seem to be a lot of difficulties because of financial 
weaknesses in the foundation. 
2o satisfy the 500 million people who are 
said to be depending on portable movies for their 
recreation and education, the activities of demo-
cratic organizations and managements, movie circles, 
labor unions and other service groups do, not seem 
to be quite satisfactory. These democratic groups 
own only one per cent of all the 16 mm. projectors 
moving around in this country. 
Let us all do our best to bring good movies 
into districts where there are no other theaters. 
3. Problems Of The Portable Movie 
When we reflect upon our past movie acti-
vities, we realize that other than the proselyting 
movies shown by large labor unions with their own 
projectors and films, there have been very few recrea-
tional movie meetings. Most of our movies were shown 
after lectures or speech meetings, and when we did 
show movies by themselves, they were solely for the 
purpose of advocating peace movements and anti-nuclear

t: ? 
causes. In short we have had little experience in 
holding good movie meetings with the purpose of showing 
the people what they want to see cheaply. 
Therefore what we know about movie meetings 
is very limited and perhaps not too systematic, but 
we willtr7 to arrange them in the following sections. 
a. What Interferes With Movie Meetings 
A great many obstacles must be removed 
before a movie meeting can be held. Some of the 
^ 
obstacles are financial problems, problems inlaerent 
in the rural district:NInterference or relations 
with other movie groups. 
Finance... In the first place, a movie meeting cannot 
be held free. Any small meeting costs a certain 
amount of money. Expenditures for the hall, film 
expenses, expenses for renting the projector and 
employing a technician and expenses for publicizing 
the movie must all be included. All these put toge-
ther comes to quite a sum and the money cannot be 
acquired easily. To solve this problem we must look 
for cheap ways to borrow good films and projectors, 
and make detailed plans. For instance, we can make 
plan d for a series of tours with one film or act 
upon the bargain sale season and ask some of the stores 
to invest some money in the plan. Then we can invite 
- 88 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
customers, merchants, and apprentices to the movie 
and later make a report on the budget, expenditures 
and balance. Such would be a more original way to solve 
the problem. 
We can also borrow films cheaply from the 
Audio-visual Library or utilize the projector of the 
public hall of the village. There have been examples 
of movie meetings that have succeeded by giving two 
showings in the day, one dul'ing the daytime for 
children with a special discount and one at night for 
, the general public. Recently there are democratice 
service groups that will arrange for the use of 
16 mm. films in lots that include a drama, newsreel, 
cartoon and short documentary. In this way we can 
borrow these films for a long term and very cheaply. 
Problems in the Rural District...We usually plan movies 
in the rural district at times when their field work is 
not so active. Yet this simple fact does not work 
out so easily all the time. Generally speaking, 
there are few films that are suited for showing in 
the rural districts. There are also old customs that 
tie down these districts. We know of an example of 
a village in one of the prefectures where the villa-
gers had organized a movie association. They would 
come together and decide upon what movie they wanted 
-89-k 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
? 
to see, then they would solicit members who were will-
ing to pay a ten yen fee for membership. Thus they 
managed to hold regular movie meetings. In these 
rural districts there is one important thing to be 
careful about. That is the possibility of making 
rather dogmatic ddcisions on what movies are good and 
imposing these movies upon the people. By using such 
high-handed methods we are liable to arouse adverse 
effects and be disappointed. Great care should be 
taken concerning this matter. People who have had experi-
ence in rural movie activities say that it is very impor-
tant to proceed with your work in these districts in 
close cooperation with the young men's organizations 
and other varilus circles and that the main pers6b-in 
charge of the activity should try to cooperate with 
other people of the village. Of course, this may not 
be anything that applies especially to the rural 
districts, but still it is definitely important for 
.recuml districts. 
This is another example - in a certain vil-
lage the time of the annual festival was chosen for a 
movie meeting and seemed to have received hearty 
approval. In another village, we hear that the young 
men's organization thought of putting on a movie show 
for the purpose of raising funds for their own organi-
zation. Instead of showing low grade action movies 
- 90 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
(depicting sword fights) or cheap melodramas which 
the town professional usually brings along, they made 
a careful choice of what they thought was for the 
general good. This program seemed to have pleased 
the people and of course they were able to raise the 
funds they needed. In this program they put in a 
film about agricultural techniques which received 
unexpected support from the people and had to be 
shown twice the same night. Taking these things 
into consideration, we must make careful studies about 
the rural districts and then go into them to work with 
them. 
About Interference...Often there are unexpected inter-
ferences when the time actually comes to hold a movie 
meeting. This is especially true An the rural districts. 
When we plan showing the prople liberal and democratic 
movies, the police may go around asking people whether 
they are planning to go tb the movie that night or 
sometimes a boss of the district may butt in. There 
are also accasions where the relation with the electric 
power company and the tax office does not work out 
smoothly. We must be very careful not to create such 
troubles and at the same time we must try hard to get 
the support of the people. The tax problem is refer-
red to in the section about 'Holding Public Meetings'. 
- 91 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Relation with Other Movie Groups...The question here 
is the relationship with professional movie operators 
who are touring the district and the theaters in nearby 
towns. When drama movies gketbbre shown there is an 
understanding that such movies will not be shown within 
an area bf a six mile r*Iiiits from the theater or that the 
film will not be loaned without the pormission of the 
owner of the theater. 
In such cases, the matter should be discussed 
carefully and patiently. Otherwise, plans should be made 
to use films that are not drama pictures, such as edu-
cational movies or other movies that have been sent to 
our organization from Soviet Russia or the Peoples' China, 
or movies that have been made by independent producers 
(not the large commercial producers). It may also be 
necessary to have a good talk with the people who are 
touring the district professionally while it may be pos-
sible to persuade these people to show go2d movies on 
their tour. Anyway, it is very important not to leave 
any misunderstandings with these people. 
b. Technical Problems In Showing Movies 
Now, when you are ready to show the pictures, 
the next three things should be considered. 
CLEAR PROJECTION 
GOOD SOUND EFFECTS 
-92-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
DO NOT CUT THE FILM 
Any movie meeting will be a complete failure 
if the projection is not clear or the sound is not 
audible or if the film breaks in the middle of a scene 
or even if the audience has to wait while the projector 
is being reloaded. 
These are matters concerning the film, pro-
jector, amplifier, voltage and technician. All these 
things should be gone over carefully before the meeting 
and a good technician should be employed for the 
operation. 
c. Selection of Films 
The way to make a success of the movie meet-
ing is to select good films. No matter how well the 
meeting is publieized and how well the people gather, 
if the movie is not a good one, you can not expect 
too much. The best thing to do is to ask as many 
people as possible and decide what is best. You must 
avoid making narrow decisions and taking it for 
granted that the people will like the films you plan 
to show them. In short, you must be careful about 
arranging the kind of films to be shown to the people 
who you want to come to the meeting. 
When you have a long drama movie or a docu-
mentary film, it is always a good idea to have short 
-93-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
cartoons, newsreels, or educational films to go with 
it. In the farming districts let us try to remember 
putting in a film showing new farthing techniques. 
If you are holding an anti-nuclear meeting or perhaps 
an evening meeting to fu,ther international goodwill 
and understanding, you must prepare films that are 
in line with the general idea of the meeting. 
In such cases, one important point that should 
be borne in mind is to know beforehand what kind of 
films are being shown at other group meetings and movie 
theaters. If you neglect this, you may commit the mis-
take of showing a movie that the people have just seen 
recently or some trouble may be caused with the theaters. 
In selecting films you must be careful not 
to choose from catalogues because among the films 
listed there are liable to be many that are old and 
worn out. Make sure that you have the kind of film 
you really want. 
For the combination of films you must take 
Into consideration the length of the films. It will 
help you greatly to keep the following things in mind. 
It takes about ten minutes to go through 
one reel. 
3E4 S.= P- 2 
2 Cartoons 
(2 reels) 4o minutes 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
1 Educational film (2 reels) 20 minutes 
1 Drama film (10 reels) 100 minutes 
TOTAL (16 reels) 160 minutes 
In this way you should make careful pland 
as to how long the meeting is to be and how the com-
bination should be made. Of course, if the film is 
a very good one, the time of the meeting should be 
arranged according to the length of the film. 
d. How To Decide On The Place And Time 
The place most convenient for everbody, the 
time most pleasant should be picked out and ample time 
should be allotted to the planning of the meeting. 
In the rural districts the slack season 
would be a good time, while if it is during the summer 
time a cool place somewhere outdoors would be a nice 
place(although you must be prepared in case there is 
rain). Be sure to make all neccessary arrangements 
for renting a hall. There have been times when the 
anticipated hall could not be rented because it was 
taken for granted that the hall would be availabel. 
The notice form for holding a meeting to be 
presented to the local government office differs 
according to the districts. Be sure to fulfill the 
necessary procedures. If the title of the film is 
not known, that fact should be clearly written. 
- 95 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Unnecessary things must not be written. When the meet-
ing is to be held in a school or within: the place of 
your work, there is no need to submit a notice. 
e. About the Projector and Film 
The first thing to be considered when plan-
ning a movie meeting is here the projector and film 
for the meeting should be obtained. The projector 
can be borrowed from the educational section of the 
local government office, public hall, school, or firm. 
The cost will probably be cheaper that way too. But 
on the other hand, the projectors in these public 
institutions are liable to be in bad condition and may 
even damage the film. Furthermore, there may be cases 
in which you will not be able to borrow from these 
institutions. In such cases the best thing to do is 
to borrow the projector with the film from the film 
company. 
When you ask a movie company for help, be 
sure to give them the following information. 
*The date and time of the meeting. The 
film you would like to have. Two sub-
stitutes(at least) should be listed in case 
the film you want is not available. 
*Make clear who is in charge and who is handl-
ing finances. Address and telephone number.

*Whether the film should be in 35 mm. or 
16 mm. Whether you need a projector or not. 
*The name of the meeting, its object. The 
program. 
*The capacity of the hall. The distance 
from the electricity source. 
*The method of transporting film and pro-
jector. 
If just the film is needed you can have them 
6end it by ordinary railroad transportation. In stich 
cases it is necessary to tall them what station it is 
to be sent, and do not forget that it is usually cash 
on delivery. 
Now, if you are planning to use 35 mm. films, 
the preparation will not be so easy as the 16 mm. film. 
In the first place you must see whether the film has 
been shown in the local theater. If it has not, there 
will be little possiblity of getting permission for the 
showing. Most of the 35 mm. films are made by the 
monopoly enterprises(Daiei, Shochiku, Toho, Toei, 
Nikkatsu, etc.) and are screened at theaters. If a 
film has not been shown in the local theater, as a rule, 
it will not be allowed to go out through any other 
channel to that area. Consequently, you must have the 
agreement of the local theater owner before you can ask

the movie distributors for the film. 
In case of 35 mm. films you must notify the 
fire department 72 hours before the showing with the 
name of the technical engineer and his license number. 
Next, let us consider a little about the 
unreleased films. Films from Soviet Russia, China, 
Korea, and Eastern Europe are sent to some organizations 
in Japan and are shown as unreleased movies. These films 
can be borrowed if you send in a request to the organi-
zation or movie company that holds them. Most of these 
films have no Japanese subtitles, so explanations will 
be necessary. In case you need a person to give you 
the explanations, his expenses will come to about five 
hundred to a thousand yen, and this must be appro-
priated in the budget. Furthermore, a microphone will 
have to be prepared in the hall for clear hearing. 
Some projectors have an amplifier system in the machine. 
These points must clarified. 
4. Budget For A Movie Meeting 
Film Expenses 
The expenses for borrowing 35 mm. Japanese 
films will be somewhere around 4,0o0 yen to 15,000 yen. 
The films of Toho and Shin Toho are fairly high while 
the independent productions like Shochiku, Daiei and

Toei are fairly cheap. Technicolored films are more 
expensive than ordinary black and white films. 
Foreigns films range from 7,000 yen to about 
30,000 yen. Americans films are more expensive and 
it seems that it is difficult to borrow them. 
Educational films and documental films are 
about 500 to 1,000 yen per reel. Newsreels are aboUt 
1,000 to 1,500 yen per reel 
Expenses for borrowing 16 mm. films are as 
? 
follows: 
Japanese Films 
? 
3,000...5,000 yen 
Foreign films(black & white) 
5,000 yen 
Foreign films(technicolor) 
10,000 yen 
Educational films (per reel) 
300 800 yen 
Newsreels (per reel) 300 600 yen 
*Expenses for showing the films 
35 mm. films (one showing) 
3,000 yen 
16 mm. films (one showing) 
2,500 yen 
The expenses for the technical engineer is 
included in the figures mentioned. When you are plan-
ning to have two movies at once(over 16 reels), you 
will be able to get the second film at a fifty per cent 
discount. This same discount will applied in case you

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Co .y Ap roved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
plan to show the same film twice in the same day. 
*Expenses for transportation 
It is impossible to transport the projector 
by hand. You will probably have to use a taxi or a 
bicycle-drawn trailer. When you are carrying the 
projector in with you on a train, you will be requested 
to pay 100 yen for a 16 mm. projector and from 150 to 
300 yen for a 35 mm. projector besides the fee for the 
red-cap. If the hall is not too far, a taxi probably 
will be the most convenient. 
A projector is very heavy. With a 16 mm. 
projector there are usually three to four components, 
each of about 45 kilograms. With a 35 mm. projector 
there are about seven components. All this cannot be 
carried by one technician. The technician will bring 
the machines to the station by train at the time you 
wish. You must have as many people as you think neces-
sary waiting at the station on the platform to help 
the technician carry all these units. In case there 
Is a change of trains and only three or four minutes 
are available for carrying all these things you must 
have more people to help you. 
*Expenses for publicity 
There are many ways to finance the publicity 
of the film. You can take advertisements to put on

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
the leaflet or admission ticket. You can also put 
commercial advertisements on your poster for the film. 
This same thing can applied to your programs, too. 
If you think of some such ingenious method, you can 
probably cut down on your publicity expenses. 
But there have been examples where the pub-
licity expenses were overly economized resulting in 
very bad attendance at the meeting and thus causing 
a deficit in the overall finances. Of course, there 
are examples where a fairly large sum of money was 
used for good publicity, which resultea drawing a 
very large crowd and bringing a profit. 
Consider carefully the time and place and 
make a thorough plan for your publicity. Your budget 
should be made accordingly. 
*Other matters 
Expenses for renting the hall, publicity 
expenses and transportation expenses for the techni-
cian should all be appropriated. When the technician 
has to stay overnight it may be a good idea to have 
him stay with the person who is in charge of the 
meeting. 
Now, the money for the film, projector and 
technician is usually paid in advance when the con-
tract is made. If this is impossible you could try

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
to make an arrangements whereby, after paying the 
expense for the film in advance, you can pay the rest 
at the time of the meeting. 
If you borrow the film on a long term con-
tract, there usually is a discount. This being the 
case, you may be able to form a moderate budget by 
planning on a series of meetings with the same film. 
Recently there have been formed democratic movie com-
panies that will set up a program at the same cost 
for a month loan(about fifty five per cent discount). 
This sort of program is a combination of a drama 
film, a cartoon and a short. The expenses are from 
about 4,500 to 5,500 yen, projector included. 
When the film alone is sent from the com-
pany it will come by railway and cash will have to 
be paid on delivery at the station. In order to 
receive this film you will have to take your seal 
and the money for the film and go to the station. 
Since there are groups to where the film must be sent 
again, you must send it back to the company as soon 
as the meeting is over. For further information about 
sending the film, you must ask the person in charge 
at the station who will tell you what to do and to 
what station it should be sent.

5. Publicity for Movie Meetings 
Publicity is a very important aspect of 
movie meetings. It may cost a little, but if there 
are printed posters that go along with the film you 
should buy them with the film and post them where 
people can see them. Hand-painted posters should also 
be made as attractively as possible. 
Bills and leaflets must be scattered in a 
manner that will bring the best results after thorough 
descussion with the members of the group. If the 
bills are to be folded in with newspapers, it should 
be done the day before or on the morning of the meet-
ing. 
It is very effective to write on the bill 
clearly the names of tha staff aril cast of the picture. 
On the day of the meeting you must try to 
finish the preparations as early as possible. For 
earlycomers you might play records for entertainment 
and also use the microphone to draw the attention of 
the passersby. If you think you can afford it, it 
may help to call the 'ding-dong' publicity men or use 
a publicity truck, or again you could use fireworks. 
6. Preparation And Work To Be Done On The Day Of 
The Meeting 
The preparation work must be shared by all. 
- 103 - 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 0 50-Yr  2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043RnnTInn9gnnni_g 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Avoid having one person do all the work. 
If you are planning to take admission fees, 
you must work hard to sell as many tickets beforehand 
as possible. Someone should always know how many tickets 
are being sold and in which area they seem to be selling 
the best. If there is an area where tickets do not seem 
to be selling smoothly, people should be increased in 
that area. 
You should arrange to take commercial adver-
tisements from some local stores for your program. 
At the pl,ce of the meeting you can arrange 
to have stalls selling milk, bread, or books to rein-
force your financial activities. 
To set the projector and test it usually takes 
about an hour. Consequently, the machines and the tech-
nician should be at the hall at least an hour before the 
meeting begins. Two or three people should be there to 
help. 
The screen should be set up at a distance of 
about fifty to seventy feet from the projector without 
any creases. Try not to stain the screen. The size of 
the screen should be about nine feet down and twelve 
feet across. If the hall is small this size should be 
reduced. Out of doors the screen must be set about six 
feet from the ground, or else the people in the rear 
will not be able to see.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
If the distance to the source of electricity 
is too long, you should have the service man extend 
the power line to where the projector is. In such 
cases, be sure you are using a cable that has a 
15 to 20 ampere capacity. If the cable is too small 
the voltage may drop and the cable may burn. It will 
be a good idea to investigate beforehand the electri-
city situation both daytime and nighttime. Take a 
look also at the fuse box and see if the fuse is large 
enough to provide the current necessary for the pro-
jector. 
The table on which the projector is to be 
placed should be large and steady. (In case of a 
16 mm. projector there sh-mld be one large and one 
smaller table. For a 35 mm. project')r there should 
be three or f-lur large ones.) 
Care should be taken to keep the vicinity of 
the projector free from people. 
In case you are using a 35 mm. projector 
you should have a fire extinguisher or a bucket of 
water near lt hand so that you can use it in emer-
gency. 
The amplifier speaker must be placed where 
the sound effect is best in the hall. When carrying 
out all these preparations be sure that you do not

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
let the projector cord and the amplifier cord run 
loose all over the place. 
When you are planning for a daytime meet-
ing, the first thing you must take care of are the 
black curtains to darken the hall. As you go into 
a theater you remember it is so dark at first you 
can hardly see where you are going. Well, the inside 
? 
of the theater must be that dark to get the best 
effects. At the entrance of the hall there must be 
a curtain on the inside and also on the outside of the 
door. Otherwise everytime someone comes in, light 
will enter the hall and lessen the effect. 
The extra time before the movie begins 
should be used wisely. As the people gather in the 
hall and there ig still some time before the movie 
begins, you can have them sing songs they know toge-
ther, or play records, or again another important 
thing is to give an explanation of the movie to be 
shown. Of course, it would be a good idea to display 
still pictures of the movie, posters and wall news-
papers for the benefit of the people. 
Now, about the showing of the movie. After 
the meeting begins there should be at least one person 
at the door for information and another person at the 
projector. Care should constantly be taken so that 
- 106 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release  50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-n1n4npnn9-4nnormn4 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
no one tris over the cord connected to the projector 
and that no one comes and leans on the table the 
projector is placed on. Frequently people do trip 
over these wires and sometimes push the table and 
thus cause damage or interfere with the projection. 
It is important to take note of the kind of 
people gathered at the meeting, what kind of impres-
sion they give, what the entire atmosphere is like and 
what parts of the movie they seem to be moved by most. 
After the meeting the hall must be cleaned. 
One person must take the responsibility of 
returning the projector and the film. This person 
must see to it that nothing goes wrong. 
Not too long after the movie is shown you 
should have some of the people who saw the movie 
get together and have them talk about it and criti-
cize it. Let us always remember not to do things 
without evaluating them after they has been done. 
These things should be done after the meeting is over, 
and then you will be able to see in perspective what 
was right and what was wftng about the meeting. Thus 
you can put your experiences in order and make better 
preparations for the next meeting.

HOW TO PUT ON A KAMISHIBAI(Picture-story Show) 
AND HOW TO MAKE BEST USE OF IT 
1. The Histroy of The Kamishibai 
There are a few things to remember when 
putting on a Kqui?hibai. The first most important 
thing is to know the features of the Kamishibai and 
then actually know where and how it should be used. 
Next, you must know what the people expect from the 
Kamishibai and be able to respond to their desires in 
a most sincere way. Unless you handle the Kamishibai  
with these points in mind, your Kamishibai activities 
are apt to face difficulties. Then it is clear that 
they will cease to be effective weapons for propaganda 
use. For this reason, let us take a look at the his-
tory of the aullgh11221. 
The Kamishibai is said to have originated in 
Japan among the children of the common people. There 
is an episnde that tells us how this Kamishibai was 
born. On one nf the back streets in Tokyo there was 
a small candy shop for children and working at this 
shop there was a young man by the name of 'Kin-chan'. 
The time was sometime during the Meiji era. This 
young man had no other job and he was staying at this 
shop. 'Kin-chan' liked to draw pictures. He showed 
- 112-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 0 50-Yr 2013/08/26: 
Declassified in Part- Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
these pictures to the children who came to buy candy at 
the store and told themstories along with them. The 
children were failcinatel and always asked for more. 
'Kin-chan' became more and more interested in this 
drawing and story-telling himself and finally he cut 
out the characters in his pictures and made them into 
paper dolls. He made these dolls act out a play. 
This became the 'Tachi-e', the very origin of the 
Kamishibai. Before this 'Tachi-e' came to take the 
present form of Kamishibai, there were probably two 
or three more interested IKin-chans' who gradually 
created the form and substance of the Kamishibai. 
In this little episode of 'Kin-chant origi-
nating the Kamishibai, we feel something warming, 
pleasant and yet rather pathetic. The Kamishibai 
was thus born in the back streets between this one 
young man who had no regular job and the children he 
loved. It has grown since and developed to what it 
is today. As the salted radish pickles and soy bean 
soup are characteristically Japanese, so is the 
Kamishibai a pure product of Japan. It has its own 
original form. 
Since the Kamishibai was thus born especially 
for the children and for their pleasure, there is no 
doubt that they were very happy about it, but from

the standpoint of content the educators could not 
agree too well with what was being shown. Children 
who, at school, would show about as much response as 
a stone or piece of wood during lessons could be seen 
in the streets gathered around the Kamishibai man like 
ants on sugar. There they would be as happy as can 
be, talking and shouting with no restraint whatsoever. 
Considering the content, but more so of the great 
attractive power of the Kamishibai, many teachers 
began to reflect upon the use of this media. Some of 
these teachers atarted what could be called a movement 
for educational Kamishibai. This was around the 
eighth year of Showa(1933). 
What we want to consider in this section is 
this educational Kamishibai, derived from the street 
2. The Characteristics of the Kamishibai 
The Kamishibai is defined as being 'a unified 
form of picture, literature and acting'. Sometimes 
we are shown Kamishibai that tell about the 'evil of 
drinking' or again some that depict the history of 
a particular locality. But in most cases they are 
nothing but large pictures with an explanation, or 
cut up novels with a drawing for each separate part. 
- 114-

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
In a Kamishibai the picture itself must be acting. 
The characters in the pictures and the events that 
take place in the story must be actively living. In 
other words the story must be toll with a real time 
sequence and with depth. 
You may ask how a picture can act. It does 
sound awfully illogical. But by using the special 
technique of the Kamishibai, the picture, and the 
words and the way these are presented, you can arouse 
the imagination of the people who are watching and 
thus make the picture act. 
Let us compare the Kamishibai with slides. 
Here is an example of the street Kamishibai. 
"Alas! The little girl's life is in the hands 
of this ruffian. But then  (draw the 
picture quickly away.) 
"Ha...ha...ha! I am the champion of justice, 
the Golden Bat!" (A picture of a masked man in 
a red mantle-coat appears.) "Stop this if you 
can!" (Draw the picture quickly away) 
The next picture appears immediately and 
the ruffian is dead. Such a format and speedy chang-
ing of the pictures wille.&tually give the children 
the feeling of action. The combination of the moving 
picture and the words overlapping makes them see the

Golden Bat actually flying down from the air to the 
rescue of this little girl. 
Now let us see what will happen with slides. 
"Alas! The little girl's life is in the hands 
of this ruffian!" (picture changes) 
"Then from nowhere the Golden Bat appears laugh-
ing, 'Ha...ha...ha!" (picture changes) 
"The Golden Bat here wields the swprd of justice 
and kills the bad man." 
You can see that the movement becomes slow. This is 
because each picture is independent and must come 
one after another. With a Eamiatillui, since the 
next picture begins to appear as soon as you remove 
the one in front, you can create a certain sense of 
dramatic imagination by making quick changes or slow 
changes. Of course, with slides there is the advan-
tage of being able to use photographs. Slides are 
more prosaic and they tell a straight story. With 
real dolls you can create an unique atmosphere 
with their movements and their comical attitudes. 
This atmospOere is the life of puppet shows. 
Compared to slides and Kamishibai, the puppets can 
express laughter and satire more fully. 
The characteristics of the Kamishibai are 
that:

1. it has dramatic force. 
2. since the media is pictures you can draw freely 
worlds of imagination, worlds of the past, 
of the Antarctic or the Tropics, of the 
primitive days or of future communist 
society. 
3. anyone can show it anywhere(indoors or 
outdoors) and anytime(day or night). 
4. it has great appeal to the smaller 
children. 
5. it is very simple to make. 
Now, for em example of a Kamishibai. The best way 
to learn about the Kamishibai and how to use it most 
effectively is to study an actual work. The follow-
ing Kamishibai is named "The Promise For Peace". 
Let us study the text and compare it with the pictures.

August 6th, 191+5 8:15 A.M. 
The world's first atomic bomb was dropped 
on Hiroshima. 
One streak of an ominous, piercing light 
flashed through the cloudless sky. And suddenly, 
a fire ball, heated to a million degrees, exploded 
with a terrific noise.

Fire broke out in all parts of the city. 
Because of the heat, whirlwinds swept 
along tearing down buildings, telephone poles and 
trees. 
Two hundred and forty seven thousand 
citizens died out of a total population of four 
hundred thousand. (pause) 
Children were forced into misery. 
Let me tell you just a few cases out of

who suffered from this atomic bomb.

And Shigeko, who lost her father from an 
atomic disease, says: 
"I hate the miserable war! feople of Japan! 
People of the world! Let us all join our hands and

bombs!" 
How can we answer this appeal made by the 
children who suffered from the atomic bomb?

3. How To Put On A Eamignihal 
a. How To Choose A Work 
You should try to make your own Kamishibais, 
but for the time being, the most convenient thing to 
do is to buy or borrow an already printed work. When 
you want to put on a Kamishibai with a special theme 
or one that shows particular aspects of local districts 
then you must make them yourself, but if you are look-
ing for general works for children, then from the 
standpoint of flinances and effects it will be much 
better to select a good one and buy a ready-made printed 
work. In prep-schools and kindergardens the children 
will look at these Kamishibai over and over again with-
out getting tired of them, so it will not be a waste 
of money to buy such works. On the other hand, for 
elder children, if yoU show them something you had 
before, they will shot.t and let you know that they have 
seen it before. In such cases, you must go to the 
schools, prefectural offices or municipal offices and 
see if you cannot find and select something for them. 
It is most convenient to utilize these facilities. 
On the whole when we select such works for 
children we are apt to think somewhat lightly about the 
content. It will never be good for us to choose works 
just because "there is a bear in the picture", or

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
because the title has the word "good friends..." in 
it, or again, just because the picture seem to be cute. 
WIlether- it ma ,bb a regular drama or a Kamishibai for 
children's meeting there is no difference insofar as 
the need of a good repertoire goes and naturally there 
should be different reactions to each of the different 
programs. There are works that are good everytime they 
are done, but on the other hand there are some that 
fail to make an impression and must be dropped for lack 
of interest. Always be careful to choose something 
that is close to the interest and daily life happening 
of the chtldren. And to understand what the children 
? 
are interested in, you must be with them, you must 
show Kamishibai a-ows to them and play with them. 
You can never expect to be right in your 'decision by 
taking it for granted that children like adventure 
stories or cartoons. 
At the same time it is not necessary to 
believe that unless your pictures have some sort of 
moral im it, lit lacks adequate guidance value for 
children. There are time- when there is too much of 
the "bad-wolf-being-killed" theme and "down-with-the-
king" theme. Of coursa the children do like such themes, 
but they also like stories that are sad or stories that 
are comical. Our aim in putting an these Kamishibai 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
? 129-
50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6

Es'z 
for the children is to try to do what we can in nur-
turing rich humanism in them. They must grow to know 
how to laugh, cry, love and be angry. It is not our 
purpose to teach them to "denounce" and "attack" all 
the time. 
The above mentioned points seem to be impor-
tant in selecting a good work. Yet, always remember 
that the work must be well done as a Kamishibai and 
that it must be effective when put on. Kamishibai  
is a form of drama and, as has already been mentioned 
in the section entitled 'Characteristics Of The 
Kamishibai', the words and pictures must match and 
furthermore it must be constructed dramatically. 
Otherwise, it will not be attractive. 
Now, let us imagine that we are putting on 
the Kamishibai "Promise For Peace". We will see what 
steps must be taken in order to put it on. 
b. Preparation 
The first thing is to see that all the pic-
tures are in order. Take all sixteen pictures and be 
sure that the sequence is in order. The explanation 
for the first picture must be pasted on ti back of 
the sixteenth picture. 
Next it your practice. You must practice as 
many times as possible. At first, watch the pictures 
- 130-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
while you read out loud or face the picture while 
reading. The picture is both the set of the play and 
the actor, so you, the speaker, are actually saying the 
words for the actor in the picture. That is why it is 
very important that you match your voice and intonation 
to the scenet.in the picture and the facial expressions 
of the characters. You could break up the atmosphere 
by using the expression of a 'madam' when a beautiful 
princess is supposed to be saying the same words. 
Now, let us begin with "The Promise For Peace". 
Read out loud while you draw out the pictures as told 
in the directions. After you have finished reading it 
all through, reflect once more upon what the theme was, 
what it want q to tell and what would be the best way 
to give it the right communication. It is very impor-
tant to get into the feelings of the actor. The appeal 
of the children who suffered from the atomic bomb is 
very solemn. You cannot afford to just read it off 
because of shyness in doing a Kamishibai. The people 
who were sacrificed in the explosion of the atomic bomb 
and the people in your audience will not permit that. 
This fatal atomic bomb must be wiped off 
from this earth. This theme told through the story of 
these children must be grasped. Then go over the text 
once more. You should grasp the place that is most 
- 131 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 50-Yr 2013/08/26 ? CIA-RDP81-01043R0023nn7?I1)nn1_R 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
important in the story, while there are places that 
must be read with reverberations, or places that can 
be passed over as explanations. All in all you should 
be able to grasp the climax of the entire story and 
emphasize that point. 
After you think you have grasped the main points 
In the story, you can try it out on your family or 
friends. You will probably be too wrapped up in the 
excitement of doing, the Kamishibai and not be able to 
tell what kind of an impression you gave to the audience. 
That is why it would be a good idea to ask the frank 
comments of these people who were kind enough to listen 
to you. Another good thing to do is to have some one 
else read the text for you so that you can see what kind 
of anieffect the performance has. After practicing 
several times in this way, and after you have under-
stood how to say the words for each picture and the way 
to draw them out, you can go out and do the Kamishibai 
with confidence. 
It is quite impossible to act in a play or 
handle the puppets without any practice at all. But 
with the Kamishibai, as long as you can read the text 
behind each picture, you can do it with hardly any 
practice. No Ipatter how bad the reading may be, the 
picture will tell a great portion of the story and for

this reason the audience will in most cases listen 
quietly. Because of this convenient feature, there are 
some lazy peoplc: who go into their performance without 
reading the text beforehand even once. 
This Kamishibai, "The Promise For Peace", is 
a very moving Kamishibai as long as you do it seriously 
and sincerely. But if you do it half-heartedly, nobody 
will be moved. Such persons like this are the kind of 
people who say that Kamishibai are only for children. 
c. The Place For Showing 
It really does not make any difference whether 
the Kamishibai is performed outdoors or indoors, but. 
at least the following points should be borne in mind. 
The first is the position of the Kamishibai. 
The box holding the pictures should be placed on a 
table a little higher than the eyes of the audience. 
When there is an especially large crowd the stage must 
be placed fairly high if you want everybody to see well. 
The light must be shining upon the picture and not coming 
0 from behind. 
Next, take note of the audience. The ordinary 
printed Kamishibai is made for ?tout fifty people to be 
shown in a room the size of a classroom. Therefore, 
you will probably get best results if you have from 
about fifty to a hundred people in a nom ab-rut as large 
-133-

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
as an ordinary classroom. When you have a larger crowd 
than this you must give further consideration to the 
lighting or use a microphone. 
The audience should be seated in rows fanning 
out from the Kamishibai in the center. The smaller 
children should come to the front while the larger and 
elder ones should go to the rear. These are things 
that hardly need mentioning, but it is a good idea to 
tell the children about these very fundamental things 
before the show begins and to put them in order. 
d. The Address Before The Meeting 
The address before the meeting must not be 
something formal and pompous. A simple and sincere 
one becomes the nature of the Kamishibai. When you 
are performing "The Promise For Peace" in front of 
grown up people, you can say: "We will now show you 
the Kamishibai, 'The Promise For Peace'. This 
Kaaighibai wus made to tell the people about the angu-
ished appeal of children who suffered froT the atomic 
bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima." This simple 
address is enough and after you have said this much 
it is best for you to go right behind the stage and 
begin the Kamishibai. Do not start any propagandiging 
for anti-nuclear movements here. Doing so will only 
serve to decrease the attraction of the Kamishibai.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
If your audience consists of children, you can add that 
all these stories in the Kamishibai actually happened 
and that the story was made from compositions that 
the children wrote. You can see that the eyes of the 
children become brighter after you have told them even 
just that much. 
e. The Performance 
Now, let us go into the performance. The 
following matters must be remembered. 
Be sure to use the stage. The stage referred 
to here means the wooden box that holds all the pictures 
and becomes a larger frame for them. If you do not use 
this frame(stage) the entire effect will be lessendd 
consid-rably. It is because there is a framed stage 
that the audience can sit and admire the imaginative 
world of the drama. A painting is set in a frame and 
is thus limited to its world. The same thing can be 
said about the Kamishibai. Of course this frame also 
serves the practical purpose of expediting the handling 
of the pictures. 
The next problem concerns the position of the 
performer. Should he stand behind the stage out of 
sight from the audience or should he show his face? 
Originally, the Kamishibai was made for the picture 
to act and from this viewpoint it would not be right 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 
? 
- 1.35 - 
50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
for the performer to show his face. The audience 
shnuld be made to concentrate on the pictures. 
Especially with a Kamishibai like "The Promise For 
Peace", which has dramatic force, it would be very 
distracting to have the performer showing his face and 
watching the expressions of the audience. He should 
stand 'behind the stage. But with pictures where you 
can laugh and sing with the children or when you are 
showing the Kamishibai to small children or again when 
you are showing it outdoors where there are other things 
to distract the children's attention, you should stand 
beside the picture so that yuur voice can be heard 
better. 
Take care with the wqy you draw the pictures 
out from the frame. People say that a good or bad 
performer depends on how well he can draw the pictures 
out from the frame. YDU can see, then, how important 
this technique is. In the first place you must 
practice to draw the pictures out smoothly(do not make 
any noise and keep the corner of the picture down). 
Next, be sure to understand the meaning of the directions 
for drawing the pictures out. These directions are 
made for better effects, so you must try to catch 
the meaning and think of a good way to bring out this 
effect.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
At the end of the first scene of "The Promise 
For Peace" the direction says -drawing the picture out -. 
This direction -drawing the picture out - is used when 
similar scenes like this one come one after another. 
The direction is also used when an explanation is neces-
sary from one picture to the other like from (3) to (4), 
or when the lapse of time must be shown like from (9) 
to (10), or again when, in the case of (10) to (11), 
after one of the boys says, "Hey! Kiyokoppei!" the next 
scene must come out at the same time. This handling 
of pictures mkes the connection from scene to scene 
smooth, and, being aided by the words that are said 
while the picture is actually drawn, the audience can 
visually and psychologically be cacried over to the 
next scene. Therefore, when there is this direction, 
telling you to say tho words while -drawing the picture 
out-, you should try not to pause between the words, 
although the picture changes. 
Now, the direction after (2) is -draw out-. 
The reason for this direction is that with the pictures 
(I) and (2) the explanation of the atomic bomb dropped 
on the sixth of August is finished and from (3) the 
actual drama begins. This is where there must be a 
pause. You should practice to draw the picture out 
slowly and with ease.

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
After pictuce (6) the direction is -draw out 
quietly-. In this scene the father finally decides to 
leave his dying wife for the sake of his children. 
It Is a very tragic scene and feelings have been stir-
red up to a high pitch. Therefore, the picture should 
be drawn out very, very quietly as if feelings are still 
lingering behind. 
After picture (12) it says to -draw out 
quickly-. Here, Kiyoko says, "I'll show you my scar!" 
and when the picture is drawn the'flash-bang'scar that 
she has been hiding all this time can be seen in a large 
picture. Now, drawing the picture out quickly must be 
done for two effects: the first is to make the appear-
ance of this flash-bang scar as effective as possible, 
and the second is to show up tAe change in Kiyoko's 
attitude from the first picture where she is turned 
around and showing only her back to the next picture 
where she is looking straight forward. 
As for the ways of drawing out pictures, we 
have mentioned four: draw out, draw out quickly, draw 
out quietly, and drawing the picture out. Besides 
these basic ways there are times when you can stop the 
picture half way through or perhaps even one third the 
way throggh. 
The next thing you must keep in mind when 
- 138 - 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
performing is to make the pictures act. This is the 
most difficult part of the Kamishibai and when you have 
mastered the way to make the pictures act then you can 
consider yourself as having graduated from the 'college' 
of Kamishibai. It is as important as that. Frequently, 
there are people who believe they can handle the 
Kamishibai very easily because they have had experience 
in acting themselves or in handling puppets. When we 
watch the performance of these people we often see that 
the performance itself is awfully vigorous, but that in 
most cases the character in the pictures are not act-
ing at all and that the words only are flying around 
on a shallow plane. 
In a play a live person is the one who is 
speaking the words, but in the Kamishibli the words 
must be spoken by the characters in the pictures. 
The words must be spoken to make these characters act 
within the picture and must not dominate the picture. 
For instance, if you have a picture of a May Day crowd, 
it does not help to give a sense of reality at all 
to shout at the top of your lungs. In this case it 
will be far more effective to make a low, long drawn 
out growl-like sound. The quietness and the force behind 
it will probably make the picture come alive. 
In considering the question of making the 
-139-
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
picture act, we should not be too afraid of over-acting. 
At least when the performer overacts, it is interesting 
to watch his acting. The problem actually lies with the 
person who gives a dull performance. Lilfe a grade 
school child who has forgotten to prepare for the day's 
lesson, if the performer just goes over the text as if 
he were reading an uninteresting book mechanically, the 
result is sure to be a failure. Or if the old people 
and the young people, girls and boys who appear in the 
pictures all speak in the same way, or furthermore, 
if there is no difference between expressions of joy 
aad anger and the entire text is gone over in a mono-
tonous tone, then it is here where the problem lies. 
The Kamishibai is an acting that anyone should be 
able to do. But if you forget that this is an acting 
and just go along without showing any emotion, without 
expressing any change in tone, without any intonation, 
then the Kamishibai becomes dead. The important thing 
is to indentify yourself with the characters in the 
pictures and try to express the dramatic effect that 
is drawn into the pictures. 
Now, about the language. In the Kamishibai 
there is the dialogue and the explanatory language. 
The first text in "The Promise For Peace" is this 
explanatory language. "August the sixth, 1945. 8:15 
in the morning " In order to read this correctly 
- 
Declassified in in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release@ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Ap roved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
with the right feeling you must look at the first 
picture. This shows the greatest moment of tragedy in 
the history of mankind, the moment when the first 
atomic bomb exploded on this earth. Thu date and I*me 
here is not the same as with any other date or time. 
You must understand the deep tragedy that the people 
of Hiroshima experienced and with a de mb emotional 
conviction, with weight and force you must begin, 
"August the sixth, 1945......." The rest will come 
naturally. 
As shown in this example, the explanatory 
words should be read clearly, but at the same time 
it should be read to creat an atmosphere and to arouse 
the feelings of the audience. It should have the 
effect of the emotional passages of the gidayu in the 
Kabuki plays. Take a look at picture (3). In this 
one picture there are the words of Kenichi, his 
mother and his father. How should these different 
dialogues be spoken? There may be some people who use 
different voices for each person and make awfully 
superficial imitations of children and women. This 
is not good. In the Kamishibai it is important to always 
use your own voice. Within the range of your own 
ordinary voice you can use your high soprano and alto 
voice along with your tenor and bass voice. 
- 
npriassifipci in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release @ 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
Generally, women and children in the play should be 
made to speak rapidly with a high and thin voice. 
Old people can be made to speak with a deep, slow 
voice, and men with a deep broad voice. If you can use 
your voice in this way the feeling of these different 
characters can be expressed. Of course, a child has 
its own peculiar way of speaking, while a mother has 
hers. It is important to catch these peculiarities. 
And in many cases neople have difficulty with laughing. 
Instead of just trying to make a real laugh, it may in 
some cases be more effective to say, "Ah-ha-ha-ha!" 
slowly. 
Finally about the entire balance. Try not 
to make the whole thing a continuation of monotonous 
words. Just because the Kamishibai is about the tragedy 
of the atomic bomb does not mean that the whole thing 
should be done in a stiff tone or that it must be done 
with a forceful and impassioned voice. This monotony 
will probably give the opposite effect by burdening the 
audience too much and subtracting from the should-be 
serious atmosphere. It will probably have less 
appeal. 
If you look at the pictures, you will see that 
they are arranged so that after the emotional climax 
where the mother dies pinned under burnigg beam there 
- 142 -

comes the explanatory picture (7), and then the tragedy 
of (8) and (9) which in turn is followed immediately 
by pictures of later more peaceful days. Sometimes you 
may have to shout with emotion in your voice, or soften 
your voice and make a tender appeal, or again explain 
in a plain tone. It is this change in speed and 
emphasis that catches the attention of the audience and 
guides their feelings, 
4. How To Make Best Use Of The Kamishibai  
Last summer there came this report from one 
of the villages in Iwate Prefecture. "We have recalled 
the village mayor and succeeded in electing a mayor 
from the reformist group. One of the indirect forces 
that have made this possible was the modest activity 
of showing Kamishibai shows to the children for three 
years." One of the youth associations in the Gumma 
Prefecture reports that they have been showing 
Kamishibai shows which they prepared, to children in 
protective institutions and that they feel themselves 
growing through this activity. 
Children love Kamishibai, it nourishes their 
soul and can change their way of thinking. The person 
who performs the Kamishibai should also love it and 
should feel a joy in showing it to the children. It is 
from this kind of eagerness that organizations are

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
formed. Children's groups and Kamishibai circles can 
be formed. 
We must refrain from taking advantage of the 
children or using the Kamishibai as more tools. The 
reason we show the children Kamishibai is because we want 
these children to grow to be fine men and women who will 
some day contribute greatly to their communities. It is 
because we want to fulfill the children's quest for cul-
tural improvement, and to answer the desires of the par-
ents. We want to do something for both children and 
parents. Through such activities we believe that there 
will be born a solid feeling of trust between ourselves 
and the children and their parents. This cannot be 
achieved in three months or even in half a year. It is 
wrong in the first place to try to calculate how soon 
this feeling of trust will be born. It is most impor-
tant to feel the necessity to do something for the child-
ren who are running about the streets and to do something 
to help the parents who are too busy to look after their 
children. 
It is not difficult to make the children and 
parents happy by showing them a Kamishibai. As long 
as you are willing to do it, all you have to do is to 
tell five or ten children that y-lu will show them a 
Kamishibai. When the time comes for the Kamishibai 
to be performed you will probably be surprised to find

? 
50-Yr 2013/08/26: CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
a crowd waiting for your performance. How wonderful 
it would be if you could find time anytime to show 
these children a Kamishibai! If you can continue this 
sort of activity, a lot of people are bound to gather 
around you. But always be sure to remember never to 
break a promise with the children. No matter how busy 
you may be a promise wade with the children must be 
kept. 
The Kamishibai can be used not only at 
children's groups but when you are conducting researches 
in the rural districts, for children when there is a 
strike in the factory district, at temporary children's 
facilities made during the busy season in the farm 
district, and when you are looking after children during 
a mother's meeting in the city. 
The so-called 'propaganda Kamishibai' made in 
connection with political programs and tax problems 
are also very important. But the difficulty lies here 
in making good ones and in the limit in the audience. 
You should be encouraged to make bold experiences in 
this field and in this case it may be important not 
to rely too much on the conventional idea of what a 
Kamishibai should be. Since we believe that the slides 
can be used more effectively for pronaq,anda purposes, 
we will make no more mention about the Kamishibai.

APPENDIX (Vol. 1) 
1. Laws Concerning Propaganda 
Propaganda Activities and the Law 
There are many laws concerning propaganda 
(publicity), but as far as our own propaganda goes we 
find that there are no laws that directly govern the 
substance of our propaganda or our way of expression. 
What come into question are the places we 
place our signs and the places we post our posters 
that are used for propaganda purposes. These come 
under the Minor Offense Law and the Road and Traffic 
Regulation Law. 
When we are posting posters it may be pos-
sible that we meet interference in the form of arrest 
on the spot under the Minor Offense Law. But this 
actually constitutes interference with political 
activities. Under the constitution we are free to 
participate in political activities. Moreover, it is 
obvious that there should be no offense when we can 
find motion picture posters posted all over the same 
place. In such cases we can protest. 
Although it is possible for us to protest 
and take legal action, we must remember that lawsuits 
can not be settled in any simple way. So the best

thing left for us to do is to gain the sympathy and 
support of the general public. To do this we must 
first have the understanding cooperation of the people 
who ltve in the houses where the postings occur. 
Next, of course, we should have posters that actually 
represent the feelings of the people, that can be 
protected by the-people. 
The following are some of the laws that we 
should know and need study.

2. Related Laws Concerning Advertising Vehicles And 
The Opinion Of The Tokyo Municipal Traffic 
Division (research made by the Tokyo 
general assembly) 
(1) Laws that regulate the activities of advertising 
cars used for political propaganda purposes are Article 
XXVI of the Road and Traffic Regulation Law and the 
other laws based on this law. The Traffic Division of 
the Metropolitan Police Office acts according to these 
laws, but concerning the advertising cars, Items 8, 9, 
12 of Article LVI1 of the Metropolitan Road and Traffic 
Regulation Law (along with items 10, 11, and 13) will 
come into question.

(2) Basing their argument on the portion within the 
brackets( ) of Article LXIX of the Road and Traffic 
Regulation Law, the Traffic Division answers the ques-
tion "Is it not sufficient to submit application for 
permission to one Police Office?" by saying, "Propaganda 
activities of an advertising car cannot be considered 
as a continuation of the same one propaganda" and 
maintains that permission must be received from evey 
Police Office that holds authority over the area within 
which the car wishes to conduct its activities. The 
reasons for this argument are that traffic conditions 
differ according to the different areas of jurisdiction 
and that the way a crowd gathers also differs according 
to the different street corners and .according to the 
way the propaganda is carried out. 
(3) The Traffic Division insists that advertising cars 
for the labor unions and political parties must apply 
for permission from the Police Office. 
(4) They say that this is purely for the purpose of 
preventing accidents and not for interfering with 
political activities. 
(5) We believe that there are many points under the 
forementioned headings that need further investigation 
and study.

4. Annual Events 
We have so far been quite eager in celebrat-
ing commemorative days concerning our own organizations 
or international events commemorated by laborers. But 
there are other national events to be celebrated accord-
ing to long-established customs. There are also events 
designated by the government. For us it has not been 
uncommon to denounce many of these events as feudalistic 
or to be indifferent about them. Not only local bosses 
but even serious citizens take deep interest in these

towards them. The following list was made for that 
purpose. Besides these regular events there such events 
designated by the government as the So-and-so Week and

APPENDIX (Vol. 2) 
1. Present Situation of the Radio and Foreign 
Broadcasts 
a. The Present Situation of the Radio 
Recently, the television has become very 
Popular, but this does not mean that radio is losing 
ground. Walking through the streets of a town or 
even a small village, one can hardly come upon a place 
where the sound of the radio is not heard. Indeed 
we are today overwhelmed by radio waves and sound. 
According to a recent survey, the number of 
families listening to the radio is assumed to be 
about 14 million, which means that approximately 
80% of all the families in this country listen to 
the radio. The survey tells us that the radio is 
on for an average of 4 hours a day. (Of .course, there 
are radios that are turned on for the day without 
anyone listening.) 
As can be seen by these figures, the radio 
is wielding a great amount of influence upon the 
people along with the television, movies, press, 
magazines, and other publications. Among the general 
public, 58% of the people say that the radio is the 
main source of their recreation, while 49% of the 
farmers say that the radio is their chief method of

gaining any training or study. The most popular 
program of November, 1956 was "Father is a Jolly Old 
Man" and roughly 3 million families, 10 million peo-
ple, were listening to this single program. Therefore, 
it is clear that we cannot shut our ears to the radio. 
Perhaps the radio may be monopolized by the capita-
lists, but considering the aforementioned figures, 
how can w,-; afford to ignore this vast mass communi-
cation media and be satisfied with reading just 
bulletins of reformist political parties and demo-
cratic organizations? How can we expect to reach the 
people and convince them when we limit ourselves 
to the narrow scope of these party bulletins? It is 
equally wrong to assume that our propaganda acti-
vities in the radio field are fulfilled by listen-
ing only to democratic broadcasts and inviting 
others to liSten with us. 
We must begin by listening to programs 
being listened by the general public and by getting 
together to talk about or criticize the program. 
By listening to these programs we can train our-
selves to detect rumors and the play on words and 
to understand the essential nature of songs and 
other forms of entertainment. The basis of our 
activities concerning the radio and its starting

point is in this training each person to be able to 
detect the true intentions of the programs and the 
cooperation to achieve this aim. 
One of the PTA groups of a primary school 
in the western suburbs of Tokyo once borrowed the 
recording of a program about "Juvenile Delinquency" 
from NHK. This program had already been broadcast, 
but they borrowed it and played it once more in the 
classroom and, after listening tothe program, the 
mothers got together and discussed the problem. 
A member of the editorial staff from NHK was invited 
to this discussion and was asked various questions 
while at the same tile requested to litten to their 
ideas. It is said that NHK, when again planning 
this sort of program, asked for the cooperation of 
these mothers in gathering material and in the plan-
ning. In other words, these mothers have shown the 
way for us how to organize ourselves in the field 
of radio by: 
1. deliberately selecting a radio program and 
listening to it; 
2. talking together about the program; 
3. making requests to the broadcasting company 
or encouraging them; 
4. making clear their opinion about the program

and cooperating in the planning and produc-
tion of later programs; 
In this way, we consider it very impor-
tant today to promote active work among family 
groups, work groups, smaller circles, unions, women's 
and educational organizations. Altogether these 
groups should endeavor for the democratization of 
the radio and through this process for the demo-
cratization of society. 
Here are some examples that may help you. 
1. Use the tape recordings of broadcasts that 
have already been broadcast. For this pur-
pose you can take recordings directly from 
the broadcast and use it later. (This type 
of recording cannot be used for profit-making 
purposes.) There are some good recordings of 
the famous May Day incident and the Sugoh 
incident.

2. You can send letters to the broadcaoting 
company or to the sponsors. Send critical 
articles to the press or other party bul-
letins. Hold discussion meetins in the 
family, hospitals and schools. Talk with the 
people who appeared on the program or with 
the people of the company.

cooperate with the planning and production 
of better programs. Small circles, amateur 
drama groups, choruses and study groups should 
be encouraged to appear on programs. Local 
cultural projects should be encouraged to 
appear on the radio with sincere cooperation 
and help. Try to appear on or send letters 
in to such programs like "Request Concert" 
or "Our Voice". Put in requests for docu-
mentary locations at your workshop or locality. 
4. Express your opinion about the general plan-
ning of radio programs. These opinions can 
be about the content or time, of the program 
and can be made through the union, circle 
discussion groups or cultural organizations. 
Educational organizations, women's groups, 
cultural and labor organizations should keep 
systematic supervision over programs con-
cerning their field and should make their 
opinions known. 
2. About Foreign Broadcasts 
It is possible for us to listen to foreign 
broadcasts. We should take more interest in these 
foreign broadcasts and take part more actively in

a. Guide to Reception 
It is very important to have technical 
knowl-edge -about the radio in order to spread the 
reception of democratic foreign broadcasts. Since 
with foreign broadcasts, the sensitivity is bad and 
there is much static or interference compared to 
domestic broadcasts, we should have some knowledge 
about the radio.

Most of the foreign broadcasts are sent to 
Japan by short wave, but Moscow, Peiping and Korea 
Central have medium wave broadcasts. 
In order to listen to short wave broadcasts, 
you must have an all-wave radio set or use a tuner 
with a lapperheter.pdyne radio set. This tuner is a 
very convenient apparatus and is sold by the trade 
name "NSB Tuner'.!. Fixing this tuner to your set is 
not difficult at all. Any one can do it by refering 
to the diagram provided. A good one will cost anywhere 
from 350 to 400 yen. It is sold in ordinary

radio shops, radio information centers and by the 
Denpa Kogyo KK.. In the Kansai area you can order 
one from the Kyodo Musen K.K.. 
The medium wave broadcasts of Moscow, 
Peiping and Korea Central can be received with an 
ordinary medium-wave 5 tube superheterodyne receiver 
with simple T.R.F. radios if they are in good con-
dition. These broadcasts can be heard very clearly 
on the Japan Sea coast and western Japan. 
b. The Performance and Reception of the Radio 
No matter what the radio may be or what the 
frequency may be, if you wish to listen to foreign 
broadcasts, you must bear the following points in 
mind. 
1. Be sure you have an aerial. You can get aerial 
wire from your radio dealer for five yen per 
meter. You must have at least five meters, and 
you should stretch this across your room or 
outdoors as high and as long as possible. This 
is how to do it. Pare the insulation off of 
one end and insert the bare copper wire into 
the aerial terminal of your radio set. Stretch 
the wire along the wall(pillar and horizontal 
beam) of your room. Leave the other end as 
it is. In reinforced concrete buildings or

ordinary homes with wire nets plastered into 
the walls, an indoor aerial cannot catch the 
radio vaves. In such cases the aerial should 
be set up outdoors. 
. 2. Next, turn on the switch and check the sensi-
tivity. In other words, ynu must be sure of 
the efficiency of your set. Now, see if you 
hear distant broadcasts at night as well as 
local MIK and commercill broadcasts. (For 
instance, if you are in Tokyo, see whether you 
can hear Osaka.) 
3. If you can catch Osaka, then try 548 KC (Moscow) 
which is at the right end of your dial. 
4. If you have succeeded in catching Moscow, then 
your radio set will probably be able to catch 
Peiping and Korea Central. If you cannot hear 
Moscow, the efficiency of your radin is low 
and you should take it to a radio shop or 
have some technician look at it. 
5. Finally make sure whether the dial markings 
and the broadcasts coincide. 
Now, for the reception. 
1. Set ynur dial to the station to which you 
wish to listen. Be careful not to turn the 
dial as if you were listening to a local

Declassified in Part - Sanitized Copy Approved for Release ? 50-Yr 2013/08/26 : CIA-RDP81-01043R002300230001-6 
broadcast. Often the reason why the desired 
station cannot be found even though the radio 
is in good order is because the dial is turned 
roughly. The radio waves of foreign broad-
casts are so sensitive that a quick turn of 
the dial will only jump the delicate band. 
2. For the beginner, the best way to catch the 
desired station is to listen for the theme 
music. (For instance, with Moscow it is the 
"Mother Country" and with Peiping it is 
"Volunteer Army March".) The theme music is 
played for three minutes directly after the 
broadcast begins. At night if you try to 
catch this theme music, it will not be too 
difficult to find your station. 
3. When you have accomplished reception, turn the 
-volume dial to the position best suited for 
your room and mark it for future convenience. 
4. While listening, there are times when the sound 
fades and becomes very small. In most cases 
you do not have to worry about this because 
the sound will soon revert to its normal 
volume. Do not turn the dial and lose the 
station altogether.

than when listening to medium wave broadcasts.

RELATUJAkia Aim of the 'Corporation 
Tax' Revision 
1. Outline of the Corplration Tax Revision 
The law aimed at levying taxes on politi-
cal parties and other public organizations was passed 
at the 26th National Diet and went into effect on 
the first of April, 1957. This law consists of the 
revision bills and tax bills that include articles 
imposing taxes upon 'organizations that have no per-
sonal character', which are called corporations. 
- 12 -

The majority of the people believed that 
this revision was one of the series of revisions 
made in-accordance with the government's policy of 
reducing their taxes by hundred billion yen. 
Furthermore, few people showed interest towards 
this revision mainly because of the unaccustomed 
term 'organizations with no personal character'. 
The government and the Liberal Democratic Party 
saw this weak point and pushed this bill through, 
which in effect established a law imposing taxes 
upon all public organizations, circles, study groups 
and other organizations and upon their activities. 
The first Article of the Corporation Tax 
Law includes this paragraph: 
"Any association or foundation that is 
not a corporation, but provides for a representa-
tive or an administrator, and runs a profitmaking 
concern(only those that have continual establish-
ments will be considered) will be considered as a 
corporation(those associations and foundations that 
have given up being profitmaking concerns are included. 
Hereafter these organizations will be called 'organi-
zations with no personal character'.) and to which 
this Law will apply." And in this Tax Law other 
articles also contain paragraphs clarifying this 
'organization with no personal character' based on

? s) 
the basic article just mentioned. 
Now, what is this 'organization with no 
personal character'? .ccording to material gathered 
by the Finance Ministry, the following organizations 
come under this category. 
? Mefa/.e and Relief organizations(unions for 
employees, worker's unions, mutual benefit 
associations, welfare associations, town meet-
ings, prefectural associations, youth organi-
zations, women's associations, etc.) 
? Educational organizations(parent-teacher's 
associations, students' assemblies, alumnae 
groups.) 
? Religious organizations 
* Medical organizations(medical centers and 
other such organizations) 
* Sports and Recreational organizations 
* Publication organizations 
* Political parties, Supporter's associations, 
Goodwill and Friendship associations, etc. 
In other words, political parties and 
labor unions, all sorts of public organizations, 
music and movie appreciation circles, study groups, 
mother and children gatherings, gangs of street-booth 
operators, associations for supporting members of

the Diet and all other groups around us are included 
in this definition 'organization with no personal 
character'. The people belong, in some way or ano-
ther, to one or more of these organizations. Now, 
how can we be indifferent to this law when the aim 
of it is to impose taxes upon all these organizations? 
Think of the huge number of organizations there may 
be scattered all over this country. 
According to the new Law, when these 
organizations begin a protitmaking business, they must 
pay corporation taxes. Formerly, a profitmaking 
business was defined under the following 28 types 
of businesses: selling merchandise, money-loaning, 
manufacturing, radio broadcasts, freight, warehouse, 
contractor, printing, publication, photography, 
hall, hotel, restaurant, brokerage, agency, mediator, 
wholesale, moneychanger, mining, gravel and sand, 
bath-house, barber, theater, variiety hall, recrea-
tional center, pleasure resort, freight handling. 
The new Law has added three more: realtor, medicine 
and health, art training (sewing, cooking, barber, 
beautician, judo, flower arrangement, dancing, act-
ing, etc.) 
Political parties and other public organi-
zations all have their own original business in

order to carry out their aims and principles. For 
instance, they publish party bulletins, their mutual 
benefit associations help get merchandise for their 
employees cheaply, they have small appreciation 
circles for movies and music where the expenses are 
provided by the members, they have chorus groups 
and all sorts of other activities. Now, according 
to the new law, all these activities can be considered 
as profitmaking concerns such as publication, selling 
merchandise, theater, or art training. Furthermore, 
when the fees and donations contributed by the members 
of these activities for the upkeep of their group 
can be considered as a profit, this finance must be 
handled accordingly. Therefore, you can see the 
reason for the hot debate over the intrepretation 
of this Law and over the question of whether this 
Law should be kept in effect. 
As has been explained, all public organi-
zations that can be considered as profit concerns 
must pay a tax of 35% when their annual income is 
less than one million yen and 40% when over that 
amount. This rate is the same as other corporations 
and is clarified in the new Law. Besides their 
duty of paying taxes, these organizations must now 
make reports on their income and carry out other

duties  regulated under the Tax Law. As for the 
report, the 'association or foundation with no 
personal character' must, -ithin two months of its 
establishment, report on the title, object of work, 
type of profitmaking business i plans to conduct, 
name of representative and place handing the business, 
to the Tax Office. If the business is in the red, 
of course, there is no need to Day taxes, but determin-
ing whether or not the business is actually in the 
red is left to the investigative powers of the Tax 
Office who can come and demand to investigate the 
books. Furthermore, in case an organization does 
not make this report, it can be indicted under the 
criminal law for not making the report. 
This is the outline of the nature of the 
newly revised Corporation Tax Law and the term 
'organization with no personal character'. 
2. What The Ruling Class Is Planning To Do 
The Constitution makes it clear that the 
object of taxation should be clarified in accordance 
with the principle of providing laws for all taxes. 
So far, the object of the corporation tax law was 
directed towards a corporation listed as an indi-
vidual. This new term 'organization with no per-
sonal character' enlarges the scope of the corporation

- 
so much that we can now say that the number of such 
organizations is unlimited because there are pro-
bably new ones established every day while on the 
other hand older ones are disappearing at the same 
rate. The substance of each organization also dif-
fers to a great degree. The new Law tries to define 
this vast mass under the abstract name 'organization 
with no personal character' and is trying to impose 
this tax by a one-sided decision. This action is 
definitely contrary to the spirit of the Constitution. 
Then, why did the government and the 
Liberal-Democratic Party 1.1..),ve to enract such an 
4 
unconstitutional law? The first reason isinte 
other than to collect as much in taxes as possible. 
The government is pushing forward the beautiful 
slogan 'reducing hundred billion yen from your 
taxes', but behind this great slogan they are also 
planning for a natural income increase of twenty 
million and this is where the increase in taxes 
becomes necessary. The tax reduction policy actually 
touches only a little over ten per cent of the tax-
payers, who belong to the upper income bracket; the 
rest of the people, over seventy per cent, do not 
share the benefits at all. On the other hand, the 
government is planning to cover the ten million

yen reduction in taxes by the expected natural 
increase of twenty million. But where does this 
natural increase come from? It is a known fact 
that the small amount of money in the form of taxes 
wrung from the small enterprises, laborers and 
farmers make up this natural increase. This new 
idea of imposing taxes upon 'organizations with no 
personal character' is really none other than the 
result of desperate thinking by the government to 
increase funds in the treasury. It is a law that 
ignores the rights of the people. 
The second reason, one which is very 
important, is that this Law was aimed particularly 
at democratic organizations. By im,-)osing taxes 
upon the public organizations the government can 
indirectly suppress them financially and interfere 
with their policies. They also can use the Tax Law 
as an excuse for probing into the organization of 
these groups as well as into activities and their 
financial situations. Thus they are planning to 
draw these organizations under government jurisdi-
ction. When this bill was decided at the cabinet 
meeting, there is said to have been some under-
standing among such capitalist organizations as the 
conservative parties and the Japan Federation of

Employers' Association and other supporting associa-
tions to the effect that 'consideration will be given 
at the time of administration' for these organization. 
Another episode also underwrites this fact. It has 
been reported that, when one of the staff members 
of the Liberal Democratic Party thundered into the 
office of Finance Minister Ikeda saying, "Are you 
trying to cause some sort of a feud within the party 
by imposing taxes upon my supporter's association?", 
the Minister answered, "The aim of the Law is directed 
towards the democratic organizations." and thus 
calmed the party man. This is definitely an action 
that ignores the democratic rights of the people and 
is as bad as the "Ordinance Regulating Organization". 
The Laborers and the members of democratic organi-
zations must show greater interest in the enforce-
ment of this Law. 
3. Fighting Against The Revised Articles 
We have to stop this Law and it is pos-
sible to stop it. 
First, we must reveal the contents of this 
Law and the aim of the government. As it is, few 
people know what this Law means and most of the 
people are indifferent about it. One thing we can 
do is to make active surveys of the various organization

in the city an then tell them about this Law. In 
this way we must try to develop a cooperative move-
ment against this Law. 
Secondly, when there is a request from 
the tax office to make a report, that request should 
be refused. It is important to first make sure on 
what ordinance the tax office has based its decision 
in dlassifying your organization as an 'organization 
with no personal character', and who make the final 
decision. There is no law that defines the chara-
cter of each and every organization. It is impos-
sible to do such a thing. Therfore, it is clear 
that the tax office has made its own unilateral 
de3ision. Actually, the tax office doesfAot have 
the authority to decide whether your ordanization is 
an 'organization with no personal character' or not 
and, consequently, it is perfectly legal to refuse 
any such request from the tax office. It is very 
important how it is decided whether an organization 
is an 'organization with no personal character' or 
not. It is equally important to fight against the 
way decisions are made concerning the judgement of 
being a profiting business or not. All organiza-
tion are busy with their activities for the achiev-
ment of their original aims. To publish party 
rao,

bulletins and pamphlets for propaganda purposes and 
to appreciate music and movies within small circles 
with the fees of the members are not activities 
aimed for a profit. It is important that you are 
sure about this fact. Do not be afraid to do the 
work you are expected to do. 
Thirdly, since it is clear that this 
Article is unconstitutional, we must organize forces 
to take legal action against its unconstitutionality. 
In order to put these forces into effect, we must 
call for the cooperation public accountants and 
lawyers and make preparations for action whenever 
the condition arises. 
In short, we must all realize strongly 
that this Article is unconstitutional, that no 
organization can be taxed under the vague defini-
tion of being an 'organization with no personal 
character', and, consequently, that this Article 
can be stopped and turned into :lead letters.
