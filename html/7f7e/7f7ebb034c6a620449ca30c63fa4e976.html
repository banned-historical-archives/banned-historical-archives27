 CHINESE JOURNAL OF SOMATIC SCIENCE
 Today, the  board of the Association of Somatic Sciences is convening
 its fourth meeting.   At the same time,                   our journal,   the "Chinese Journal
 of Somatic  Science" has   also been  published.    It may               be said that our
 Chinese  Association  of   Somatic                   Sciences has    progressed   to    a  new
 operational stage.    For  our work  to enter  a new stage, our ideological
 knowledge must also follow.   We must not continue to remain at   that stage
 of hard combat with the group of opponents where we have been for the past
 several years.    We  must  now  fight   another    hard                 battle  to establish
 scientific research   the somatic sciences.         Comrade Chen Xin published an
 article on this major topic in   the initial        issue of   "Chinese Journal of
 Somatic Science"   entitled "The  Concept and Methodology of the Human Body
 as an Open, Complex Giant System?-."      Here,   I will  use this               concept that
 the human body is an open, complex giant system to talk about my knowledge
 of somatic sciences and  the   operations   of   the  Association   of Somatic
 Sciences.    I hope that you comrades will point out any errors I may make.
 In 1983, I had an article in "Nature Magazine" entitled "Concerning the
 Science   of   Thought"?.      In   this  article,   I mentioned the outlines of
 somatic   sciences,   but   I  did  not  yet  mention  the  problem  of human
 paranormal abilities.      At  that time, my primary   understanding was that
 there was a history    of several   thousands of  years in medicine and that
 there was  a great  deal of practical experience there.     Modern physiology
 and medicine also had a history of 200 years.        This is important.   At that
 time,   I   stressed  the      effect of  human   consciousness.     This   is the
 difference between    man      and   animals. Therefore,   the shock  waves of
 paranormal abilities   have caused  us to greatly open up our eyes.         At the
 same time, a great "wave of  popularity for     QIGONG" has   risen around us,
 reminding people  of China's         ancient medicine   of several thousand years-
 Chinese medicine.                   This allows us to recognize   that the   concepts we have
 studied in   the past  concerning man are not sufficient for our needs,  and
 we have finally come to recognize that the human body is an  open, complex
 giant system.   Concerning this question, Comrade Chen Xin also stated very
 clearly in the first issue of "Chinese Journal          of Somatic   Science"  in an
 article entitled   "Somatic Sciences  - The  Way to  Major Breakthroughs in

 Modern Science"-3.   When I think about it, the reason we were  able to come
 up  with, this    concept  was  with  the   assistance of the discover of the
 phenomenon of human paranormal abilities.   For my  personal understanding,
 I  must thank  the  origins      provided   by  human  paranormal   abilities.
 Therefore, those comrades who    are performing  work  in  human paranormal
 abilities have made major contributions and performed meritorious services
 which    will  be  called a  milestone   in  the history    books    of  man's
 understanding of the world.
 I pointed             out in  that article   in 1983   that somatic   science was a
 major part of the body of modern science and technology.   It parallels the
 natural   sciences,   social sciences,   the  mathematical sciences, system
 sciences,   thought   sciences,   military        sciences,   behavioral sciences,
 geological sciences  and the artistic theories.   Each major part has three
 levels, the theoretical sciences,  the technical sciences and the practical
 technologies.
 Naturally, there are several special points in the artistic theories,
 because the practice of artistic theory  is artistic  creation and   is not
 science.     When somatic   science is added to the major fields above, there
 are a  total  of   ten,   which  compose the  body  of  modern   science and
 technology.       Each  part    has   its   own  philosophical  outline.     The
 philosophical outline of the natural sciences is the   natural dialectics.
 The    philosophical    outline    of social  sciences   is     the   historical
 materialism.    The  philosophical      outline   of   the artistic theories is
 aesthetics.  The philosophical outline of the somatic sciences is the view
 of man and nature.      Finally,   they  are     all   gathered   together   in the
 philosophy  of  Marxism,   while  Marxism uses the philosophical outline of
 each part to guide the   advances   in   science   and  technology-4.        In the
 somatic sciences, the philosophy of Marxism guides research in the somatic
 sciences through the view of man and nature.   The  achievements of somatic
 sciences add   to the   philosophy of  Marxism through  the view        of man and
 nature.
 Although I already had the concept of somatic sciences in 1983, I had
 a very  shallow understanding  toward the overall further understanding of
 the human body at that time.   I only knew that it was very complex.   As to
 what extent,  I was not clear.   Beginning in 1988, we gradually discovered
 in our system discussion classes the concept that  as a  system, the human
 body is not a normal system.   First of all,  it is an open system, which is
 to say that this   system  has exchanges    with  the  outside  world.    For
 example,  through breathing,  eating and drinking and elimination of wastes,
 it carries out a material exchange.    Through sight, hearing, taste, smell
 and touch   it conducts   an informational exchange.   In addition, the human
 body is composed of billions and billions of molecules.     Therefore,  it is
 not a small system nor is it a large system, but it is a giant system even
 larger than a large system.    Also, all the component  parts of  this giant
 system are  different.    The interaction  between these components is also
 very complex.   Therefore, it   is  a  complex  giant  system.    Some giant
 systems such  as the   air in this auditorium are also composed of billions

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 and billions of molecules, so it is a  giant system.    However,   there are
 not very many types of molecules, and the interaction among the molecules
 is not complex, so it is  a simple  giant system.    For  open simple giant
 systems,  a theory can be constructed to process them such as the theory of
 I. Prigogine and H. Haken with a great deal of success.   This won them the
 Nobel Prize.     However,   using  their  theories   to process open complex
 systems such as the human body or society is unsuccessful.    This  was the
 fallacy of the "brains" of the social sciences in advocating the injection
 into China of foreign economic theory a short time ago.
 Therefore,  to study an open, complex giant system  such as  the human
 body,  it   is necessary  to take   another route.    It has been the past few
 years that we have    formed  a  type   of  method   in   our systems sciences
 discussion   class  which  we   called "the comprehensive integration method
 from the quantitative to the qualitative"5.   Specifically, it is combining
 bit    by  bit,   everyone's  qualitative   and incomplete opinions to form a
 numerical model, entering boundary restrictions and performing qualitative
 calculations, and   finally reaching    a conclusion. Actually, this is also
 the modernized processing method of what in the past we called "democratic
 centralism".      However,  in the past when using this principle,  errors were
 committed, and when error was added on top of error,   it was  not possible
 to collect   the proper opinions.   Why was this the case  Because there was
 no scientific method to accomplish the summing up.   During  sessions of he
 National People's  Congress or the Chinese People's Political Consultative
 Congress the delegates would put forward  a number   of opinions  and there
 were several programs, but finally what happened was there was actually no
 good method of summing  up  these   ideas or  platforms,   so  how  could a
 scientific decision  be reached?    Therefore, all credit for the formation
 of the concept of an open,  complex  giant   system  and  the comprehensive
 integration method  from the         quantitative to the qualitative should go to
 the Chinese people.  From this  basis, mans'   ability  to  understand his
 world has risen to a new stage.
 Since man   is an   open, complex giant system,  in our study of somatic
 science, we  must  use   "the        comprehensive   integration  method from the
 quantitative       to the  qualitative".     This  is  a basic      view point and
 methodology.       This new concept we have come up with, we should say here at
 today's meeting,   had its  beginnings in the theories of Chinese medicine.
 Therefore, we have already pointed out that Chinese     medicine, QIGONG, and
 human paranormal   abilities all taken together form somatic sciences.   Now
 I would like to say that our theories have also risen, risen          to this view
 that the human body is an open, complex giant system.   We should hold this
 view to reshape all old knowledge of the human body.   I         believe that this
 is the   task of  the Chinese  Association of   Somatic Science.  Naturally,
 this task is a monumental task and will take a great deal of effort.   I am
 afraid   it  will   take  until  the  next   century.    However, we must have
 confidence.   In  the  past  thousands  of  years,   mankind   has constantly
 searched for,   and today has finally found, the proper avenue, and we must
 go down that road.

 Since the human body is an open, complex  giant system,   the study of
 the human body must not be simplified.   We must not grasp one single point
 and ignore the rest.   Therefore,   we must   search for   truth through facts
 and    must  pay  special serious   attention   to  obtaining  knowledge from
 experience.   As for somatic science, the basis for practical    knowledge is
 medicine.    Medicine is  the most   abundant source for practical knowledge
 for somatic science.   Because man becomes ill, and when he becomes ill he
 is treated.    In   order to   treat ailments,  it is necessary to clarify the
 cause of the disease and to study just what the     human body   is. This is
 especially   true   of clinical  medicine.      It  has  direct  contact with
 patients.   A patient is a real and   complex entity.    There   is no way to
 simplify the   patient.    I have  had contact  with a number of persons who
 conduct medical research.   They often simplify man, and often look down on
 people  practicing  clinical  medicine,   feeling  that  they    are not very
 "scientific".   However, I feel  that   the   "scientific"   they  are talking
 about is   often a component of mechanical materialism.      We in the somatic
 sciences must never commit the errors of mechanical materialism.    We must
 pay serious   attention to  the experiences of clinical medicine,  including
 Chinese medicine.    Chinese medicine has a history  of thousands  of years
 and   includes  a  great  number   of things.   Through practical experience,
 Chinese medicine has a great deal  of  perceptual   knowledge.    They also
 worked hard to summarize this and to form the precious theories of Chinese
 medicine.   Naturally,  there are also  minority nationality medicines such
 as  Tibetan medicine     and  Mongol  medicine, so  we   call it traditional
 medicine.   Actually, this problem is also being taken seriously in foreign
 countries.    In the  british magazine "The New Scientist"', it was stated
 that there are two medicines in North Africa,   one is   called Frankincense
 and one is called Myrrh which are very famous and which they are studying.
 Later we also saw a news item that stated that  chimpanzees in  Africa eat
 two types   of leaves   every morning, one has the Latin name of Aspilia and
 the other is called Lippia Plicata.   The item stated that these   two types
 of   tree   leaves are   healthy  and give  an  appetite. That is to say,
 chimpanzees  also  eat   herbs.     Therefore,   Chinese medicine    and   the
 nationality medicines    all over  the world   are very fruitful storehouses,
 and there histories are probably longer than several   thousand years.      If
 we   tack  on the  ancestors  of    man,  it is probably a history of several
 hundred million years.
 Another major aspect is Western medicine.   Another is the combination
 of Chinese   and Western  medicine.   In this years fifth issue of "People's
 Pictorial"'?, I saw some successes of the combining of Chinese   and Western
 medicine.   However,  I could not find these in medical books.  This is also
 something very valuable in  the practical  experience of  medicine, and we
 must not ignore these things.
 The fifth  aspect is  psychological treatment.   There has been a fair
 amount of growth here in the  past several  years.      Professor Wu Jieping,
 vice chairman   of the  China Science Commission told me that psychological

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 treatment is very important, and that when he was seeing patients, he used
 psychology.     Therefore,   everyone   should  not  feel   that psychological
 treatment is not important.   The treatment of  patients by  QIGONG masters
 also has a psychological effect.
 The sixth  aspect is  QIGONG.    QIGONG is  very effecting in treating
 certain ailments of certain people.     However, the pattern has not yet been
 fully identified.   We cannot, however,  ignore QIGONG because of this.
 The seventh aspect is paranormal abilities.   Many comrades here today
 all conduct research in paranormal abilities, so I need not   speak more of
 the significance of paranormal abilities within somatic science.
 Are there still more aspects?    As our understanding grows, there may
 well be more.   These seven aspects I have mentioned  are mentioned   in the
 general order   in which  they have   received serious attention after their
 appearance.   Naturally, the   comrades here today probably  have their own
 order, and   I will  not argue   this.   However, these seven aspects are all
 directly used to process man, and they cannot be simplified   for practical
 experience of   the human  body and our research into the somatic sciences.
 We must consider man as an open, complex giant system,   and no  two people
 are   the  same.     Therefore,  clinical  medicine is the most abundant and
 complete source of information for research into somatic   science and must
 be  given   our full   attention.      In   our Chinese Association of Somatic
 Science there is a Clinical Medicine Philosophy Committee.   Their research
 plays a major role in the development of somatic science.   Furthermore, to
 what I   have said   in this  section, we  should not   restrict ourselves to
 Chinese medicine,    but should   also include all seven aspects of clinical
 medicine.   For example,   I have   already suggested  using the theories of
 Chinese medicine to analyze large numbers of cases of Western medicine.
 From the  viewpoint of     somatic   science,  there can be even greater
 developments in   clinical   medicine.      In   the  past  when  talking about
 medicine,  it was divided into the first medicine which was the medicine of
 the treatment of disease, and the second medicine      which was  the medicine
 of health   maintenance and  disease prevention.      As for the concept of the
 third medicine, I have several different ideas.       The English for the third
 medicine   is  rehabilitation  medicine.     Our   translation   as   "recovery
 medicine" is not appropriate.   For a patient   to recover,      that belongs to
 the   first   medicine,   while    third  medicine    actually   refers  to   the
 restoration   of   functions of    the       disabled.      It   is   recovery through
 mechanical methods.    Actually,   there are   a great many such instruments.
 Nearsightedness cannot be cured, so glasses are worn.   If       one is   hard of
 hearing,  he  wears a  hearing aid.          If the heart function is poor, a pace
 maker is implanted.   As science   and technology     advances, there   are more
 and more   of this  sort of  thing.   There is an article called "Conceptual
 Technology"!~ in which it   states that   "We have    been wearing  glasses for
 several generations.    Then there were contact lenses.   Now we perform eye
 surgery to help ourselves see better.    We can also  remove aged     bones and

 skin.         We are slowly and  actually using  more and  more materials   in the
 human body.   We are becoming controlled machines.   We are using technology
 externally and internally to perform certain mechanisms of life."           On the
 second page   of the   28 May,       1990 issue  of "Guangming Ribao" there was a
 news item on a   "new  model  multiple  function  rehabilitation  bed being
 placed into  use".This discussed  using a new multiple function electronic
 bed to help people perform a  number of   lost functions.    Somatic science
 research can   help us manufacture even more mechanical electronic devices.
 These    devices can  help  people  recover  some  functions   which medical
 treatment methods   cannot recover.   Therefore,  I believe   that the third
 medicine   cannot  be   called recovery  medicine,   but  should  be   called
 "reconstructive medicine",   which is  the reconstruction  of organs of the
 human body.
 From the viewpoint of somatic science, I feel that there   should be a
 fourth medicine,   which is   the stimulation of functions which most people
 do not   have,   such  as  paranormal  abilities.    I   call this "Creation
 Medicine".     We  must   create ourselves,   create  a man superior to that
 created by "god".   Also, this is a  conscious dynamic   creation.   This is
 one major aspect of   our somatic   science.    It also includes three other
 aspects.   The first is to use the  methods of   somatic science       to enhance
 the accomplishments    in athletics.   Comrade  Xia Shuangquan  of the Wuhan
 Physical Education College studied   and  tested   using  QIGONG  methods to
 improve   athletic  achievements.    The  second  aspect is to improve mans
 intelligence.   Comrade Wu Yitong of  Anwei has   conducted some experiments
 in this   area, using  QIGONG methods.  However,  it was an error for him to
 list using QIGONG to correct nearsightedness in this category,  as   that is
 a  first  medicine   problem.     The third   aspect is to induce paranormal
 abilities, bringing into play abilities which are dormant in man   or which
 man does not have.   I believe that somatic science should study the fourth
 medicine, which are problems of creative medicine.
 Somatic science   should  turn   toward  medicine,   and  the clinical
 medicine includes  the four  medicines, which    are the first medicine, the
 second medicine,  the third medicine and the fourth medicine.    Furthermore,
 the  four   medicines  all  must  use  Chinese  medicine, Western medicine,
 combined  Chinese  and   Western  medicine,     folk  medicine,  psychological
 treatment, QIGONG, and paranormal abilities.   We naturally are also unable
 to  state  that  paranormal  abilities   only  belongs  within   the   fourth
 medicine.  This concept must be clarified.   ]
 In Shanghai there   is   a doctor   called  Sun  Qiyuan_   He studies
 leukaemia.   He  advocates  that  it   is  wrong  to  separate  medicine and
 pharmacologyG.   I feel that this is reasonable.   Some people do not go to
 a  doctor  when   they  are   ill,   but  buy medicine   according    to  the
 advertisements for drugs which could cause problems.    This is because even
 though they have the same ailment, no two people are alike, and  no matter
 what a  persons condition,   or as we say what their functional state might
 be,  it   is not right to  just take  any medicine.    The  current state of
 confusion in the medical treatment enterprises is a cause for concern.

 We who  work in  somatic science should also note that there are very
 many problems which clinical medicine has not solved.   Not long ago   I saw
 Doctor Kuang  Peigen of  Hospital Number  301.   She talked to me about the
 problem of pain.   She said that this problem is very complex,   and that we
 did not understand it.    There is a World Pain Association, and there are a
 large number of people who have  joined it.    Some   are medical personnel,
 some are  psychologists and  some are sociologists.   Because the causes of
 pain are very complex, much pain cannot be cured and  nothing can  be done
 about   it.     Therefore,  our   knowledge of the human body, especially our
 knowledge of the nervous system is very lacking.
 III.  THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS
 In 1983, In my article   "About   Thought   Science",   I mentioned this
 problem.    Now I believe that we who are doing research in somatic science
 should also pay attention to this problem.   Because the        human body   is an
 open, complex  giant system, it is necessary to give serious consideration
 to the feedback effects of the human consciousness  to the      other parts of
 the     body.     This   is psychology,   a  basic branch of science in somatic
 sciences.   When   they  studied    the   human mind   in  ancient times, they
 committed mistakes       of idealism.    Later, when psychology was established,
 it   came  up     against mechanical     materialism.   A  typical  example   is
 behavioral psychology,            which is the so-called "black box theory". At the
 present time, there are a great number of different types of psychological
 research in   foreign country,   and none   of these can convince the others.
 However, I believe some of the questions can  be clarified.    For example,
 research in brain science can resolve such problems as sensation, which is
 the detection of external information, and   how it   is transmitted to the
 brain after   receiving it.    This   is biological psychology. However,  the
 next higher level of sensation is known in psychology as perception.     This
 is very  complicated and cannot be clarified.    Because perception involves
 even more complex  questions  such  as   how  does   the  brain     process the
 received information.  There are people in foreign countries who have done
 research in ovine perception.   They say if a man is standing, the sheep is
 afraid.    If the  man is lying down, the sheep is not afraid.      This is one
 interesting phenomenon.   Recently I saw a book  review10 which  reviewed a
 book called   "Synesthesia" by Richard E. Cytowic.   From the book review, I
 felt that it should not have been called Synesthesia, but should have been
 called "Feelings".    Feelings  are something even higher on the scale than
 perception.   For   example,   someone  hears  music,   first  of   all   is the
 sensation from      the ear to the  hearing nerves,   and then the controlling
 portion of the brain processes the sensation information  which gives rise
 to perception.      Perception is then combined with the culture of the person
 listening to the music and finally the feelings of listening  to the music
 are reached.    Similar  processes apply  to touring  scenic areas, reading
 poetry or watching a performance.   However, I   see that is very difficult

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 for psychology  to study this question, because it currently can still not
 be divorced from the processing method of the reduction theory.   There are
 many books   like this.  This  is a  problem that  psychology is presently
 faced with. It is even more important   for we  who are  doing research in
 somatic science   to pay attention to this problem, and we must jump out of
 the framework of  psychology  and  use  the  methods   of  processing open,
 complex giant  systems,   and  we  must  use the comprehensive integration
 method   from  qualitative to  quantitative  to  gradually  move  up  from
 biological psychology   to the spiritual level which R. Sperry talks about.
 Once we have determined how human  sensation rises  to the  high spiritual
 activities,   and then,   how does  this high level activity feed back and
 affect other portions of the human body.   This is actually to   establish a
 science of spirituality. If those working in somatic science do not study
 this question,  a number of questions such as  QIGONG and   human paranormal
 abilities may  not be  able to be solved.   I spoke of this problem before,
 and today while summarizing this concept of "sensation",    I would   like to
 iterate the role of consciousness and mind in somatic science.
 IV.   LEADING IDEOLOGY AND METHODOLOGY IN STUDYING SOMATIC SCIENCES
 Research in somatic science must use the philosophy of Marxism, which
 is dialectical materialism, as its guide.   As  for somatic   science,  it is
 the view of man and nature which connects it to the philosophy of Marxism.
 The three levels of the view of man and nature  are the    microscopic view,
 the macroscopic  view and  the universal  view.   Chinese medicine has made
 large contributions to the macroscopic view aspects.    Here,  I   would like
 to emphasize  that we  must not   commit errors  of idealism and mechanical
 materialism.   In some fields of natural sciences and technology   it is not
 very easy to commit errors of idealism.   However, due to the influences of
 Western  sciences,   it   is  very  easy  to commit   errors  of   mechanical
 materialism.   As we say in the vernacular,  this is stubborn as a mule,  and
 it takes a simplistic view of problems.   Research into somatic science not
 only  guard   against   idealism,   it  must also  guard  against mechanical
 materialism.   In  the  past,   the  persons  who  criticized   research into
 paranormal abilities and opposed us included those who said we were guilty
 of idealism and mechanical  materialism.     However,   if  we  maintain the
 philosophy  of  Marxism,   and  maintain dialectical materialism,  if anyone
 calls us   idealistic, then they must   themselves be   guilty of mechanical
 materialism.    Therefore, I once more stress that those working in somatic
 sciences must do   a  good job   in   learning the  philosophy  of Marxism.
 Otherwise, we   not only   will not be able to do a good job in our research
 in somatic science, but will also   make  mistakes.     The  central leading
 comrades have repeatedly stressed that leading cadre must do a good job in
 learning the philosophy of  Marxism.    Why have   they done that?  Because
 leading  comrades  must    handle social  problems,   and these are an open,
 complex giant system.      It   shares  this  point   in common with somatic
 science.    Therefore, those working in somatic science must do a good job
 in learning the philosophy of Marxism.
 Recently I saw the  book "Preliminary  Explorations into  the View of
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 Man and  Nature" edited  by Comrade Ye Jun of Sichuan.    I believe that the
 book contains a number of things  that   appear  to  be   true  and   are yet
 untrue.    Therefore,  it will not be an easy task to construct this bridge
 of the view of man and nature between   somatic science   and the philosophy
 of Marxism.
 Here  I   would like  to   say  that the problems faced by the Chinese
 Communist Party in leading the new democratic revolution   and in socialist
 construction are  very complex, but they have achieved great victories and
 accomplishments.   The summarization of this experience and the refining of
 a high degree of philosophy lies in the though of Mao Zedong.   The thought
 of Mao Zedong presents the theory of scope of dialectical  materialism for
 interrelated complex  problems".    It is  a sharp  weapon for research in
 somatic sciences.   We must study and put to use this philosophical thought
 of Mao Zedong.
 With  a    leading ideology,    the  next   thing   is  the problem  of
 methodology.   The method for       handling this   open,   complex  giant system
 which    is  the human  body   is  the   comprehensive integrated method from
 qualitative to quantitative.        It is not   that old     method  of reduction
 theory.    The reduction   theory dissects things, tests them, and then puts
 them back together.   This is the Baconian      method of  300 years   ago. For
 the    past    several hundred   years   people     have   always  followed this
 "scientific method" when conducting research work.    However,       this set of
 methods cannot be used to solve open,    complex giant systems.      Because this
 system is extremely complex,  how is   it to   be dissected?       And the small
 system   dissected   are   not the  original   systems and there is no way to
 summarize the bit by bit research of the small systems.    I       just mentioned
 that the  views of persons conducting medical research are not the same as
 those of clinical doctors,  and the  patients faced        every day  by clinical
 doctors are   each and every on an entire person, an entire entity.   Facing
 this open, complex  giant   system  of   the   human  body,   we  must conduct
 comprehensive research,   and must  not tarry  at the level of doing bit by
 bit research.   We must summarize research of the various  portions.   There
 are numerous papers published in the medical field every year, but they do
 not solve problems.  Why?    Because  that  research   is    all  bit  by bit,
 partial,  and   has not  been all summarized.   Somatic science research must
 summarize all    information.    That requires  the use of the comprehensive
 integration method of from qualitative to quantitative.
 We stated   in the   first section that this method was the creation of
 the Chinese people.   The foreigners do not have it  yet.    Naturally, they
 also face          complex problems   in practice,   and know  that the old Baconian
 methods do  not work,   so in    recent years   there has   appeared in foreign
 countries          a  fad   of so  called   complexity research.     However,  after
 discussing it back and      forth, no       feasible methods   came out   of it which
 could solve  problems.    So it  is we  who are  marching in the forefront.
 This   is  something  that  we  Chinese  workers   in          somatic   science can
 celebrate.

 On the  other hand,  in practical use of the research method described
 above, because it involves the social   situation  of  China,   there   are a
 number of  difficulties that   have yet   to be   overcome.   There is a great
 deal of information to      be  summarized.      It  cannot  be  done  by hand.
 Therefore, we  must use   the methods    of modern information technology and
 use modern information technology as  tools  to  assist   human   thought in
 order to  complete the comprehensive integration   form the qualitative to
 the quantitative.   Those doing somatic science research must take   part in
 this work  and must have a firm grasp of this method.   As we are know, Mei
 Lei of the Space Medicine Engineering Lab has  done a   great deal  of work
 with computers   and Lu    Zhu and Lu Huo of the Nanjing Military Region Main
 Hospital have done research  in dimensional  EEG.    Is it  not possible to
 summarize this   work on EEG?   Recently I saw research into fingerprints by
 Shao Ziyuan of the Henan Physical Science Research  Academyls which stated
 that finger prints represent a persons genetic information, and by looking
 at fingerprints it is possible to  select people   with athletic abilities.
 I think  that this is simplistic.  Since finger prints represent heredity,
 and it cannot be said   that   heredity is   all  determining, environmental
 influences also  play a  great role.    I fear that human functional states
 require several hundred  parameters     to  describe  them  and  must  not be
 simplified.      Recently I   saw  an   article in "Nature Magazine" by Zhang
 Shaoguang on his theory concerning the networks of    the human  body-14.   He
 stated that the material basis for networks were a type of liquid crystals
 which organized movement between   certain gaps  and channels    in the human
 body.    This is  also too  simplistic.    Also,  it  is only one idea and no
 thorough research has been    done.     Heilongjiang  Science   and Technology
 Press has  come out with a book on modernized research in Chinese medicine
 by Zhang Shishun in which he quotes me as saying that the human body   is a
 system.    However, his  system is too simple. He also uses that pansystem
 theory of Wu Xuemou of   Wuhan.    Zeng   Weijun   of the  Nanjing Municipal
 Jiangpu County Hospital has written a book on research in Chinese medicine
 by many scientific disciplines which broadens the horizons of the theories
 of Chinese  medicine.   He has brought in everything he could use.   This is
 an excellent beginning, but   it is   only a  beginning.   Because the human
 body is too complicated, we must not now simplify it.
 In   the  past,   Western  medicine  frequently  made  the  mistake   of
 simplification, treating only the seat of   the disease.      Recently  in the
 May 1990 issue of "Scientific American" I saw an article written by Steven
 A. Rosenberg15.     He told how to enhance   the human  immune capabilities to
 allow the immune system       to defeat  cancer.    This is a step in the right
 direction.   The article stated that in 1968 when he was a  resident of the
 Boston  Hospital   he  had   a  patient  with stomach pains.   An examination
 showed he was suffering from gall stones.   He used     surgery to  remove the
 stones.   However, checking the patients medical records he discovered that
 12 years earlier the patient had stomach cancer   and when  it was operated
 on,   it  was  discovered   that   it   had   spread to the intestines and was
 inoperable.  The doctor believed that he had at the  most three  months to

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 live. However, strangely enough, after three months, he grew stronger and
 stronger, and 12 years later while undergoing surgery for gall  stones,  it
 was discovered  that the   cancer was   completely gone.   Rosenberg believes
 that it was the result of the immune system.   This is   one type   of system
 view point,   and is  not treating  the head if the head hurts and treating
 the foot if the foot hurts.
 I also thought of Chinese medicine treatments.   They often use a type
 of tonic.    What is a tonic?  In general it is what Western medicine calls
 strengthening the immune abilities.   However, what Chinese  medicine calls
 a tonic is more than the Western medicine enhancement of immune abilities.
 Western medicine now  also   uses  some  tonic medicines,   such  as Lysium
 Chinese and   astragalus. However, Western medicine does not know that the
 time of year is important for tonics.    Some tonics  can only  be taken in
 the Winter   and cannot be taken   in the Summer.   Chinese medicine is more
 clear on this.
 These examples all make it clear  that  we   must  use  the  view the
 problems of   the human  body from  the viewpoint of an open, complex giant
 system.    We  must  use  the   comprehensive integration   method  from the
 qualitative to   the quantitative.   We  must use the philosophy of Marxism
 and the view of man and nature to  guide our   research,  and  must not only
 grasp a single point without the rest.   If there are to be accomplishments
 in somatic science   research,   mechanical  materialism  must  be overcome.
 However,   at  the  present   time, dispersion   is  a  major  problem,   and
 dispersion is a major enemy  of somatic     science  research.     Within the
 Association of Somatic Science, there are quite a number of well known old
 experts.   They have already retired   from  the  front  line  of scientific
 research and   do not wish to do that bit by bit work any more.    If the bit
 by bit research is not all summarized,   how  can   we progress?     This is
 extremely important for somatic science research.
 There have  been accomplishments  in Chinese somatic science research
 and there is great hope for the future.   This is not only because   we have
 Marxism -  Leninism and  the thought  of Mao    Zedong and the philosophy of
 Marxism guiding    our work,   but Chinese Somatic Science   Research is also
 guided by  the Party.    At  the top  there is  a Party  and State four man
 somatic science leadership team, and below the leadership team there   is a
 group of   experts.  Because somatic  science research requires the use of
 the   comprehensive    integration  method    from  the    qualitative  to   the
 quantitative which requires summarization, I would like to stress one more
 time that summarization is the most   important task  for the   expert team.
 The board   of directors   of the Association of Somatic Science should also
 conduct summarization work.     It is  also necessary  to do  the bit  by bit
 operations, but summarization is where the future of somatic science lies.
 We must turn around the trend toward scattered research!      In the  past in
 the atomic   and nuclear bomb, we relied on a unified leadership, relied on
 a high    degree   of  political   awareness,   high  degree   of organizational
 discipline, and high degree of science.   This type of organized integrated
 operations is what somatic science needs.       I   hope that  through this type

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 of work  we can change how others view our Association of Somatic Science.
 They feel we are   the "Chinese  Association of  Paranormal Abilities" only
 working  with  performances  or  doing  bit  by  bit testing or the "China
 Association of QIGONG".  We  must   enter a  new  age   of  Chinese Somatic
 Science.    The scope  of our work must not only include the first medicine
 and the second medicine, but must also be broadened to  the third medicine
 and we  must create   the fourth medicine.   Therefore, somatic science is
 intimately related to socialist modernization construction in China.
 Are the points of my understanding as I  related them  above correct?
 I ask  the board to discuss them. The members of theboard are the leaders
 of our association.   Our Chinese Association of Somatic Sciences  must act
 as determined by the board.

 THE WORKING TASK OF THE CHINESE SOCIETY OF SOMATIC SCIENCE
 BY:   Zhang Zhenhuan
 Today,   Comrade  Qian  Xuesen  described in a detailed and systematic
 manner the problems concerning the various aspects of somatic science.   In
 the past,   Comrade Qian Xuesen has spoken with insight on somatic science,
 playing a major role in promoting  our work.    Today,   Comrade Qian Xuesen
 has come to take pat in our meeting, and we are very happy to see his high
 spirits and hear his resonant voice.
 Today we also celebrate   the founding  of  the  "Chinese  Journal of
 Somatic   Science".     This is    a publication jointly managed by the China
 Society of Somatic   Science   and  Shanghai's  Jiaotong  University.    This
 cooperation helps   to ensure    the quality  of the  magazine.   We hope that
 everyone will take this cooperation seriously and will treasure it.
 Having heard Comrade Qian Xuesen's report, I feel that there is still
 a  very   great  distance  from  what  we    are  doing   in   our work and the
 requirements Mister Qian spoke of.   Mister Qian's speech today  on somatic
 science was  very thorough  and systematic.    He  pointed out that somatic
 science is the combination   of many  scientific disciplines.    To actually
 carry it out, the contents are very abstruse and very difficult.
 Our work is guided  by the  philosophy of  Marxism.    How is it led?
 This should be very specific.   How can  we, through  our work,  cause even
 more people  to understand   us and to attract even more scientists to take
 part in our work?  As  for the  question of           mechanisms, this has not yet
 been clarified.    We  should resolutely continue and not waver.   We should
 continue to open up new areas in our work.
 As for he debate over somatic science,         it   has not  yet stopped.    A
 doctor of chemistry in Hong Kong once said,  "even if my own son could read
 characters using his ears, I would still not   believe it.    However, there
 are comrades   of this sort around us, who just because their own child can
 read characters with their ears, so do   they  believe   in   it.     The year
 before last there were several Americans,  including a magician who came to
 China to oppose human  paranormal abilities   and QIGONG.     They  wanted to
 see, but  we would  not let  them see.    Why  should we  show them Chinese
 things.   Later there was an investigative commission  which came   from the
 United States,   and it published an article saying that there was still no
 proof of human paranormal abilities.   What qualifications did they have to
 publish such  a criticism    (Comrade  Qian Xuesen interjected:   didn't the
 person who invited those Americans -   the Editor-in-chief  of the "Science
 and Technology Daily" - resign?)
 We want   to do a good job of combining somatic science with the study
 of Marxism.   Concerning the question  of consciousness   and existence,  the

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 question  of   thought  and  the  brain,   and the problem of subjective and
 objective, we must do a good job in our study  and research.    As   of now,
 there has  still  been  no  work dealing specifically with the problem of
 consciousness.   This is a problem of doing a good job in research from the
 viewpoint   of   the  philosophy  of  Marxism.  We  have  discovered a new
 phenomenon, and we should outline it from the viewpoint of philosophy, and
 when it cannot be explained in terms of old concepts and old view points,
 we should create new things.   Also, as for the   human brain,   we have done
 only very   little superficial   research.    In order to further investigate
 such problems, can we train ourselves to generate   certain functions?    If
 we ourselves have these abilities, then we have a right to speak about the
 explanations of certain things.   We have to work hard in these   areas.  In
 general,  our  work is  still quite   a ways   from the systematic and strict
 requirements proposed by Mister Qian.
 Below, I would like to talk about the    problem of   the organizational
 establishment of   the society.   At   the present time there are people all
 over China submitting requests to  join   the  Chinese  Society   of Somatic
 Science.    To deal with this, we have adopted an active serious program in
 organizational development operations, and as of the end of March of 1990,
 our society had grown to 333 members.   Of these 185, or 55.6 percent, held
 a position at the   level of   associate professor  or associate researcher.
 This illustrates  that the  quality of   our membership is relatively high.
 Our  members are    scattered   from  27 provinces,   Cities   and Autonomous
 Regions.    At the  present time   only Qinghai, Xizang and Hainan Island do
 not have members.  The concentrations of members are in Beijing, Shanghai,
 Sichuan,    Yunnan, Hei.longjiang,   Jiangsu, Shaanxi,  and Hunan.   There are
 already six group memberships,  and the  Jiangxi Province   Somatic Science
 Society and the Guizhou Province Somatic Science Society have requested to
 become new group members.
 It is worthy of note that   in areas  where provincial,   municipal,  or
 autonomous   region   first   level  somatic   science   societies (or research
 committees) have  been   established,   under the   leadership  of   he local
 science   committees   or   science  association,  in order to make widespread
 contact with activist elements, this      has  spread to   a    number of local
 societies.    For those  who are   top notch and who have made contributions
 toward the growth of somatic science,    only when  one of      these submits an
 application is   he accepted   as a member of the Chinese Society of Somatic
 Science.   This is the way it was handled in Yunnan and Guizhou.   From what
 we have   learned a  few prestigious  societies have  used this tiered form
 growth model.   Now, our   Chinese   Society  of   Somatic   Science,   with the
 support   of   the local   societies   in the  various localities, has these
 layered conditions.   In the work of organizational  growth in  the future,
 we   should   also learn   from  their experience and adopt a layered growth
 membership method.
 In order to strictly  ensure the  quality of           our membership,    we are
 primarily adopting   two methods.     One is to travel the mass line,  relying
 on the local societies for new membership growth.      The second is to act in
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 accordance  with  the   charter   of our society, thoroughly investigate and
 research applications and conduct review and approval in a serious manner.
 Having tested the measures above through practice, I believe they are
 actually effective.    After   several  years  of  stable  growth,   the vast
 majority  of  activists  who  are really conducting scientific research or
 organizational and liaison  work in     somatic  science   have  already been
 absorbed into  our society.   New activists will continue to appear in the
 future, but not on a   large   scale.      In  the  first   half   of   1990,  the
 organizational work  committee received a total of 30 applications to join
 the   society.       Except for  two    applications  which       did   not   meet
 qualifications, all were handled in the order received.    For a fairly long
 time into the future, we will in general  be able      to ensure   this type of
 growth rate.    As for the problem of training, such as training doctors to
 see into patient's bodies, we have to pay more attention to this.
 To   sum  this  up,    we    should     have       strict  and   conscientious
 organizational work,   to gradually form a corps of cadre which can fight a
 hard  fight   in   the   realm  of  somatic   science.     This   is  a reliable
 organizational  guarantee  towards  our      strategic  objectives    and toward
 achieving the various tasks which Comrade Qian Xuesen pointed out today in
 his report.
 In the  past several years, by relying on this corps or ours, we have
 achieved a  certain     degree  of  success   in   academic   construction.    In
 general,  there are the following aspects:
 The   first,           through    strict,   designed   and  targeted   scientific
 experiments, we have demonstrated several objective phenomena of the human
 body under different functional states.   This has provided a valuable clue
 towards establishing a singular science concerned with these phenomena.
 Second,  according to these facts which have already been established,
 some   scientific    research;    personnel have   already  begun   to    conduct
 theoretical research  such as  Comrade Liu  Yicheng's preliminary research
 into   multistate physics.        Many others have received much encouragement
 from his work.
 Third,  in order to have more   thorough research,   all of   the special
 committees set     up have  begun different degrees of explorations along the
 direction of their special interests, providing an excellent beginning.
 Fourth, some special committees, such as the fourth      medicine special
 committee,   have   already  conducted  a  number of attempts at the applied
 science     level  such  as  making  students  more   intelligent    with  some
 preliminary accomplishments.   This type of work is continuing to develop.
 Fifth,  in  the conduct   of somatic science experiments, especially in
 the conduct    of   human paranormal  ability  experiments,      several special
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 problems have   arisen such  as the  discovery that the thought activity of
 those taking  part   in  the  experiments  could  produce   an unconventinal
 reaction on   the capabilities   of the instruments.    This is a phenomenon
 unseen in ordinary physics experiments.
 With this work, and   facing the       results obtained   in somatic science
 research,   this  problem has    arisen  which has attracted attention:   How
 should we view human thought activity?    This reminds me of a conclusion of
 Engels which  was that human conscious thought is the highest level of all
 forms of activities in the material world.   Since this   is the   case, just
 exactly what   effect can this type of the highest form of activity have on
 other forms of activities.   As for this question, standing  on the heights
 of philosophy,   Mao Zedong  once proposed   a topic  from the view point of
 knowledge:   Material can be transformed into spiritual,   and spiritual can
 be transformed   into material-    He  also pointed   out that this is a leap
 phenomenon often seen in daily  activities.      It   would   appear   that our
 research in somatic science may make some discoveries and some progress in
 this area.      There are now people who are considering:    How can conscious
 activities be   tested?    There is   a scientific    researcher in the "Second
 Artillery" system who developed an instrument which he designed to measure
 "thought forces".   Some of the comrades here today have already taken part
 in these experiments.   How can  we continue   to develop  this?    This work
 should be continued.   Also,  in the past acupuncture treatment required the
 use of material needles, but now there are those who hold the  needles but
 do not   have to   stick the needle into  the patients  body, but stick the
 needle into the acupuncture mannikin, and the patient senses this.   How is
 this done?    Of   the people using this  method, there   is one called Chen
 Deshun who is a deputy chief   resident.    He said  that it   is possible to
 stimulate a   reaction in   the patient   through thought activity.   Is this
 really the case.   We should use strict testing to   demonstrate this, using
 a  "double  blind",   where     the  patient does  not   know beforehand what
 acupuncture point on his body the  doctor  will   try  to   affect  with his
 thought activity,   and the  doctor himself  will not know beforehand which
 acupuncture point will be selected, but this will all be determined at the
 last moment  by those   conducting the experiment.     Later, the results will
 be compared, and see if the      acupuncture points  affected by  the doctor's
 thoughts   and  the  ones  the  patient   sensed were     the same. If these
 experiments are able to produce hoped for results,   then it  would signify
 that these new phenomena are presenting a challenge to physics.
 To do        research and  to have  results in  this research   on the open,
 complex giant   system of  the human  body, methodology   is very important.
 Everyone   must   conscientiously study and   have  a   firm  grasp  of   the
 "comprehensive    integration  method from    qualitative  to quantitative"
 brought up   by Mister Qian.   Since it is from qualitative to quantitative,
 researchers themselves must   have  personal  practical   experience   in the
 things they  are researching.   It is only in this manner that there can be
 qualitative knowledge-    Therefore, if your  are doing  research in QIGONG,
 you  should  have  some   personal  knowledge   of QIGONG.   If you are doing
 research in human paranormal abilities,  it would be best if  you possessed

 paranormal abilities  yourself.    Comrade Long Wenyu of the standing board
 of governors of our society is  already   in  his  seventies,   and  yet has
 developed a  degree of   abilities.   This is a great inspiration to us all.
 There are people who oppose us who say that we are all wrong.     This spurs
 us on.    If people raise an army against us,  it will make us all the more
 determined, and we will definitely find some way to make it through.
 In order to do a good job in somatic science research, we  must still
 thoroughly study  and use  the knowledge   of modern   science.   At the same
 time, we should work hard to   extract the   essence of  China's traditional
 culture.    This is   our major   advantage, and it should not be overlooked.
 We should be fully aware that research in    somatic science  is a difficult
 system engineering    project, just   like Mister Qian said, we must expend a
 great deal of energy to collecting and studying     in many  different areas,
 and then consider the summarization of this work.   In order to do this, we
 must do a good job in division of     labor and   cooperation.    We must  do a
 good job   in organizational   coordination.   The Chinese Society of Somatic
 Sciences must consciously undertake these tasks.    From  the progress made
 in  the  past   two   or   three  years,   the key  points of our work are to
 strengthen the work of     the various  special committees and to strengthen
 the various   local somatic   science societies.    For   example, the Sichuan
 Provincial Somatic Science Society has done the following  things in about
 one year:    One, the provincial somatic science society leadership section
 was injected with new strength, with deputy governor of Sichuan   in charge
 of education,   Comrade Han   Bangyan serving  as the director, and Comrades
 Zhou Mengpu and Wang Puyan serving  as deputy  directors.    The provincial
 science committee and the provincial education committee also both support
 the  work  of   the   somatic   science   society. Second,   it    is  making
 preparations to  establish a  Sichuan Provincial  Somatic Science Research
 Center with personnel and spaces from the Sichuan Scientific and Technical
 University.     The   provincial  science   committee  has   approved this and
 provided expenses. In this manner,   they  have  formed      a  new scientific
 research  base. The   original   scientific    research   base,   the Sichuan
 University  Somatic  Science  Research  Lab     still  continues to progress
 forward according to its own characteristics.   This year it has cooperated
 with units concerned in Beijing in applying for   research topics  from the
 State  Natural  Science  Foundation  Commission.     In this manner, it has
 gradually  formed  a  new  situation  with  both  division   of   labor   and
 cooperation.    Somatic science   societies or research committees in other
 areas can also create their own  new  experiences.      We   are  prepared to
 conduct some   investigations and studies to summarize this experiences and
 to gradually publicize them.
 According to the original plan,  in   the second   half of next year we
 are to   convene an international symposium on somatic science.   Will we be
 able to do a good job in this?  This will depend on whether or not  we are
 able to bring forth anything of any content.   In order to do a good job in
 preparation,  we   hope that everyone will  make suggestions,     and think up
 some good   ideas and   like professor Ju Qingquan of the Sichuan Provincial
 Somatic Science Research Center, who not only took  the lead      himself, but

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 was also able to  mobilize even  more people who share the common goal to
 take part in the practical work  in somatic   sciences.    If everyone were
 able to do this,  our forces would be even larger.
 In April   of  this  year,   a Japanese somatic science exchange group
 visited China and visited such places   as  Beijing and  Jilin.     We were
 prepared to receive them,   and the results were fairly good. In the future
 this sort of international exchange work will continue  to grow.    We must
 all be  prepared, and  we must not take this too lightly.   The building up
 of international exchange will be an encouragement to us.
 In order to do a good job in  these things mentioned above,  we must
 also strengthen   the work of our society office, and continue to do a good
 job in our journal and our societies "bulletin".  Everyone  must work hard
 to support   our journal  which is the magazine "Chinese Journal of Somatic
 Science".    We must   also support  our "bulletin".        Information materials
 work must    also be firmly grasped, and some way found to collect even more
 related information such as the biweekly broadcast on Soviet television of
 information on   human paranormal   abilities.    We must widely collect such
 information.   At the same time,   we must  do a  good job   in informational
 exchanges and  build up  our contacts  with various         areas.   It is only in
 this way that the work of our Chinese Society of  Somatic Sciences   can be
 even more effective and more dynamic.

 RESEARCH IN RESTORING A BROKEN LEAF THROUGH ESP
 BY:   Wang Chongyuan, Shou Zhumin and Pu. Xianggen of the Bai Qiuen
 Medical University
 This article reports on using ESP to restore artificially broken tree
 leaves.   The experiment was videotaped and this  broken leaf  was cut into
 thin   strips   which  were         subjected  to  microscopic   examination with an
 optical and electronic microscope.   The examination demonstrated   that the
 skin and   zoological cells  on the  surface of the pittosporum tobira leaf
 were restored.  The experiment was repeated three times at different times
 in different    places, always successful.         The shortest time was 23 minutes
 and the longest time was around four hours.    The  author has demonstrated
 this fact   in cytology ultrastructure.   This will be of major significance
 for the traditional concepts of restoration of organic trauma.
 The objective of the   experiment:   to use  bi.ocytology  methods to
 demonstrate   the    possibility  and    actuality  of ESP   restoration   of
 artificially broken leaves.
 Dates of experiments:  October and November of 1986.
 Location of experiments:   Bai Qiuen Medical University.
 Recording   equipment:     Autopsy    microscope,   optical microscope,
 electron microscope (Japanese,    650 power).
 ESP   subject:     Li  Zhanru,   female,   19  years   old, student at the
 Changchun Post and Telecommunications College (now a student   at the First
 Military Medical University).
 The conduct  of the    experiment:   There was a division of labor among
 those present at the experiment.   There was  the subject   (the person with
 ESP abilities - Li), the person in charge of the experiment, a monitor and
 tester (a volunteer took part) and the observers.   The leaves used   in the
 experiment were chosen at random just prior to the experiment (the subject
 did not know what type of leaf it would be prior to the experiment).    The
 length of   the leaf  was measured   and the leaf was marked.   With all the
 observers watching,  the leaf was torn into two pieces, and placed into the
 hands of   the subject   (one of   four illustration on cover) (translator's
 note, not available).    Then she held it in her fist, and after a length of
 time, Li   said she felt a sensation (meaning it had reconnected), and then
 in front of the observers she   opened her  hands to   let them  see and the
 state of   re-connection was checked.   In the process of the experiment,  it
 was required that the subject not leave her  seat or   open her   hand.   The
 observers sat   around the subject.   In the third experiment, a young woman

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 was assigned to do a control experiment.   The results of the experiment in
 the restoration   of the pittosporum tobira leaf were conclusive.   Although
 modern biology and medicine cannot come  up  with  an   explanation.    This
 author   of   this   experiment  did  not rely purely on observation with the
 naked eye. The re-connection and state of restoration of   the broken leaf
 was also subjected to observation at the cellular level.
 In order to preserve the biological cells and tissue structure of the
 pittosporum tariba leaf in  a normal   and total   state, the   leaf about to
 form together was processed with fixer and was encased in wax.   Successive
 slices were made and died for observation.
 Viewed microscopically, the two ends of the pittosporum tariba leaves
 had joined  very well and there wan no trace of leaf overlapping.   Looking
 at the veins of the leaves, the main veins and the branches as well as the
 microscopic lines   all lined up precisely back in their original position.
 Although some sections had not  yet   completely  rejoined   and      small gaps
 remained,  the  veins of the leaves were reconnected,  and the two ends came
 together just as they were before separation (cover    illustrations two and
 three) (translator's  note: not   available).    The degree  recovery of the
 surface of the two ends of   the  broken   leaf  was  not   consistent. The
 thinner portions  near the  outer edges of the leaves had been fairly well
 restored, while at the thicker portions   at the  veins there  were visible
 gaps,  however,   they had already grown back together (cover illustrations
 three and four) (translator's  note:     not   available).      Similarly, the
 degree   of   recovery  for different   levels  of  the   leaf  were also not
 completely consistent.   Cross   sectional slices were made     of the joining
 areas of   the leaf,   and gradual  closing of  the surface skin is visible,
 forming a bridge  connection     (illustrations five   through  seven).    The
 spongy tissue  and the palisade tissue were successively built up. In the
 restoration of the  original     biological tissue, the   sequence  was from
 surface to  the interior,  and at the same time it was also possible to see
 layers which had not  yet  been   completely  restored   (illustrations five
 through eight).
 Observation  under   a  sweep electron microscope further demonstrated
 the above described results of consecutive slicing.    The two   ends of the
 broken leaf showed clear inconsistency in the degree of restoration at the
 surface.   The edges of the leaf had   recovered far  more than  the central
 portions of the leaves, and no gaps could be seen there (see illustrations
 nine and ten).
 Cutting super  thin slices  of the   reconnected portions  of the leaf
 demonstrated  the   leaf   surface  was completely restored according to the
 original tissue   structure.     The  plant  cell   arrangement  was ordered.
 Similarly,   it  was  possible   to  see   the  diagonal  gap in the state of
 complete recovery and near   complete   recovery   (illustrations   eleven and
 twelve).

 ILLUSTRATION 12:   Regional cellular arrangement gradually becomes ordered.
 The key to the experiment of the restoration of broken   leaves is the
 question   of  whether   or  not  Li  Zhanru's paranormal abilities actually
 exist.    This is  because they   are the  primary condition   for success or
 failure in the restoration of the broken leaf.   Concerning Li's paranormal
 abilities, continuously checked them for seven years between 1980 and 1986
 (up until   the time of the experiment).   We tracked her from the beginning
 of junior middle school until she was in college.    During this  time, she
 was tested   and evaluated  by the  somatic science research experts of the
 various institutes of higher learning and scientific research units in our
 province,   and   there   is no   room  for  doubt about the existence of her
 paranormal abilities.   Her paranormal abilities are multifaceted,   such as
 recognizing characters with her ear,    remote sensing,  thought transference,
 and seeing into the human body'-
 As        for   the               success   rate   of restoring  broken    leaves   and   its
 repeatability, the   experiment or   restoring artificially  torn leaves was
 conducted a total of three times         (not   including  ten   times   outside the
 experiment) with success all three times.   The facts illustrate that it is
 repeatable, and the success rate is high, eliminating      random chance.        As
 for  'recognition       of  paranormal abilities,   the  author  believes      that
 paranormal abilities have nothing to do with ghosts or goblins,       but are a
 special sense   or latent      ability of   the human  body recognized by modern
 man.   There are   certain   conditions     under which  it occurs,   and these
 conditions can  be learned  with energetic        training. However,  it is also

 restricted by objective conditions.   Just as Qian  Xuesen said,   the human
 body is   a complex  giant system.    Because in the process of man learning
 about the objective world is like an endless river, it  never stops?.     We
 have noted that these three successes took different lengths of time,   some
 longer than others.   The first time only took 23 minutes.    The experiment
 was held in a small meeting room, and we had discussed this experiment for
 a long time, and  were very  excited and  there was  a cordial atmosphere.
 Many of   those observing  were young graduate students, and the conditions
 were very simple, there  was no  special equipment.    The  second time was
 much different   from the  first in that the   experiment was held in video
 taping class room.  We used a video  camera and  there were  bright lights
 all around.    The observers were   all looked  very curious and surprised.
 The video camera ran the whole time.    According to the subject,   she was
 afraid   the   experiment  would  fail, and   the many psychological factors
 caused the time for her    to  succeed to  be  longer.     This   is just as
 professor Zhang Hekang said,   the individual consciousness becomes the main
 participant in the experiment.    The so called individual consciousness is,
 the author  believes, the ideas of paranormal abilities.    But what are the
 connection between these ideas    and the thought activities  of the brain,
 with the   knowledge of paranormal abilities, with the location in time and
 space when it is used on an object to alter it.   Just because   it is based
 on such  recognition, we   tried to  create conditions for each experiment.
 Actually, scientific experiments all do their best to eliminate extraneous
 factors such as putting the person with paranormal abilities at ease prior
 to  the  experiment,   eliminating  or  reducing   the   tenseness    of   the
 atmosphere,   and   to conduct  some   stimulation experiments to induce the
 abilities of the subject.
 As for the question of restoration of the leaves after  being broken,
 we observed   the cellular  ultrastructure,  and   in addition to aiding what
 the naked eye could not see, we also wanted to test the reliability of the
 observation and    the actuality of the joint the broken leaves.   Paranormal
 ability restoration of a  broken leaf   is not   like abracadabra  and it is
 done, but   it takes  a period   of time.    Through both the optical and the
 electron microscope,  the complete restoration of the veins of the two ends
 of the leafs where they come together can be clearly seen, and there is no
 possibility of trickery.  Even if   someone were   to try  to glue   the leaf
 together while        watching what he was doing,  it would be impossible to get
 the vein patterns to come together so perfectly and smoothly.    The author
 believes   that       to  do this  through  some   sort   of trick, the following
 conditions would be  necessary:     (1),      it   would  be  necessary to know
 beforehand what   type of leaf was  going to  be used.     (2),   it would be
 necessary to   have some   sort of   tools.      (3), There  would have to be a
 certain amount   of time   and space.         Throughout the entire process of the
 experiment, none of the conditions for trickery were present.     The samples
 were chosen   at random    and there was a double blind.   The recover of the
 leaf was plant cell recovery.     The         entire  process from  disordered to
 ordered,        and   it occurred gradually.  This also demonstrates the objective
 factors   necessary  for   the  transition  process.     Under    an   electron
 microscope, the viewing of successive slides of the tissue at the juncture

 of the leaf demonstrates this process, even though  we are  unclear of the
 mechanism  through  which  of  human  paranormal ability restores a broken
 leaf. This will require further   investigation.    However, the revelation
 of this fact raises two necessary considerations.
 1.    ESP can restore a broken leaf, can it cure wounds or diseases of
 the human body?   It would seem that it may.
 2.   It would  be a  contribution to  medicine to   further clarify the
 mechanism     of  ESP   cures   and  use   this  for  wound recovery and disease
 treatment.

 A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO THE MECHANISM OF "THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE"
 BY:   Shao Laisheng, Lu Huihua, Shen Yunhu and Fang Linhu
 (Fudan University)
 In  the  process  of          "thought   transference" experiments, there must
 flash before the frontal lobes of the person sending the  messages and the
 person     receiving  the  messages  an  ESP   special   "screen"i in order for
 transference to take place.   We took the   screen flashing  time to  be the
 sending and receiving time.   We discovered that at close distances (100 to
 1000 meters) times for sending and receiving messages   were very   much the
 same.      Both times  differed from a few seconds to several minutes.   Later
 while conducting long range   (over   100   kilometers)    through transference
 experiments,   we    discovered   that the  difference  between sending    and
 receiving times differed by as much as several hours.   This new phenomenon
 of "time differential" caused us to do further explorations.    This article
 introduces in some detail the experiments and the   results.    It discusses
 the  process   of  how   we   became  aware  of  the    generation  of   "time
 differential" and our hypotheses.   On this basis, we propose   a hypothesis
 for the mechanism of "thought transference" which is related to the memory
 storage system of the brain.
 I.   In the process of   short range   thought transference experiments,
 we  determined   the  times   the   "screen"   appeared for   the   sending and
 receiving subjects by looking at our watches when they said the screen had
 appeared.    There are    quite a  few subjective factors here, so we need to
 change over to using stop watches   to   record   the   sending  and receiving
 times.    This means  we must push the button on the stop watch immediately
 when the screen appears to the sender and the receiver in order   to reduce
 any man made effect.   Table one is a portion of the experimental results.
 The experimental   conditions for table one:   The message was composed
 of two arabic numerals.   The sending distance was about 100 meters.   There
 were seven   comrades with  ESP abilities who took part in the experiments.
 Although we did everything possible to synchronize the stop watches, there
 was a   time discrepancy  of from ten seconds to more than two minutes.   We
 also compared the records of experiments of more      than 100  experiments of
 transference   from   100  meters   to   10 kilometers.   The time differential
 still changed in an unpatterned manner.   We did not detect any     pattern of
 change related to the  distance.    Therefore, during  this stage of close
 range experiments,  our explanation of the   "time differential"   is that we
 just believe it is generated by subjective influences on the subjects,  and
 experimental   error  primarily  comes  from  factors which  we  could not
 control.

 On 18 January of 1990, we were successful in our   first long distance
 "thought   transference" experiment   (between                                Shanghai and  Changzhou,  a
 distance of about 200                     kilometers).    The results              of the experiment were
 completely beyond    our expectations.                    While eliminating any possibility of
 message transfer  by any                                other means,   the time  differential between the
 sender and   the receiver  was as much or more than six hours.   The results
 of this experiment are given below:
 It was arranged by the persons   in charge  of the experiment at both
 terminals that:   At   12:30 PM and 19:00 Pm on 18 January there would be a
 thought transference experiment.   At 20:00 exactly, the  persons in charge
 of    the   experiment   at both  places  would   compare   the  results of the
 experiment over long distance     telephone.     At   Changzhou  at   12:30,  the
 person in charge of the experiment, Lu Huihua,  randomly wrote two messages
 to be transferred and gave them to two senders, Ji Meiyun and  Yin Yufang.
 Ji's message  was "Return   to Shanghai  Saturday afternoon", and Yin's was
 "274".   Ji's screen appeared at 12:41 and 12:50.  Yin's appeared   at 12:42
 and 12:53.    In Shanghai, the person in charge of the experiment there was
 Shao Laisheng.   Beginning at 12:30, four persons including Pang   Fei began
 receiving.    However,   within   the   alloted   time for the experiment (45
 minutes), the screen had not   appeared.     This  experiment  was  called a
 failure.    That night, at 19:00 both sides began the experiment again. The
 message sent by Ji was "914", and the one sent by Yin was "Did   it rain in
 Shanghai today"?    However,   the messages  received in Shanghai were those
 which had been sent from Changzhou at noon, and not those which  were sent
 that night.    The  time of   transference between those two places was more

 The next day, another two  more   experiments                                                  were   conducted exactly
 like the  day before (except the messages were different) with exactly the
 same results.
 Between 23 and 30  January, we   conducted four   completely successful
 thought   transference   experiments    between   shanghai and Taixing,  and the
 time differential was still fairly large.   The                                                    results of the experiment
 are given in table two.

 1. From   a  superficial    view                 of   the above long distance thought
 transference experiments:   The reason the time differential from Changzhou
 to   Shanghai  was over   six  hours  was  because the two experiments were
 scheduled six hours apart.     From  Shanghai                to                                   Taixing,        the  message was

 Approved For Release 2000/08/11: CIA-RDP96-00792R000400290002-1
 likewise not   received in the alloted time, and after more than two hours,
 each person   actively   received   one  more   time.     Therefore,   the "time
 differential"   cited  above   is   related   to  the interval between two ESP
 functional states, and this  time   interval  was   artificially determined.
 However,   in  actuality,   there   is  a time delay of several hours between
 sending and receiving in "thought transference". This is where         the basic
 nature of   the "time  differential" lies.      Therefore, we must propose new
 explanations,  and the new explanations obviously must be tied in  with the
 question of the mechanism of thought transference.
 We believe a possible explanation is:    The "time delay" phenomenon is
 related to the storage and memory functions of the brain.   This hypothesis
 can be   tied in with the study of modern psychology and theoretical models
 of memory.   In the  process  of  understanding  this  world,   the   role of
 storage and   memory are   a very important link.    Simply stated,  there is
 constantly changing information from  our surrounding  environment, mainly
 through   light  waves   and   sound  waves  which affect our sensory organs,
 transforming physical    stimulation   energy  into nervous  activity.    The
 nervous activity   is carried to the brain where is generates sensation and
 perception.     Furthermore, the   filtered information   is all automatically
 stored in   the memory system.   Later, through recollection,  it is possible
 to retrieve the stored information, and by analyzing    and summarizing this
 information, man gains a better understanding.   We can use similar methods
 to illustrate the "time differential" phenomenon         of through transference,
 which is   also due   to the  generation of   a memory  storage effect in the
 brain.
 If the receiver of thought transference goes into an ESP state within
 the    alloted   time,   but   the   "screen" does not flash before his temporal
 lobes, then it is generally believed that the  experiment did  not succeed
 (the   subject  was   affected  by  physical   and psychological internal and
 external interference, this is a common   occurrence).    However, we cannot
 eliminate the   possible existence of a certain ESP receptor in addition to
 the other ordinary sensory organs of the body, and that   it can   enter ESP
 radiated information   into the memory storage system of the brain.   Later,
 the receiver, out of necessity, goes into an  ESP state,   and can retrieve
 the stored  ESP message,   which reappears  on the "screen".   Therefore, in
 long distance thought transference experiments, due to the  memory storage
 effect   of the  brain,   the   information going from storage to the screen
 would allow for the existence of a fairly long time differential.
 2.   In order to better explain the above hypothesis, we have used the
 following diagram.
 Illustration one   supposes that the differences  between the thought
 transference   transmitting and   receiving  processes   are    only   in   the
 transmission time,  and outside information goes through normal information
 reception systems (sight,  hearing,  touch,   etc.)   into  the  brain   to be
 stored in   the memory    system.   ESP information carriers go through an ESP
 reception system (ESP receptors) and are    entered into  the memory storage

 system.      However,   later   information  processing,   up  until the screen
 appears,   the  process   of    ESP   radiation  generation   is  similar.      In
 illustration  one,      the   "Screen  effect  generating   system", the      "ESP
 receptors" and the "ESP radiation"   are     all  hypothetical.     Even though
 their existence cannot be demonstrated by physiological, psychological and
 physical experiments, we can   list  a  number  of       related  experiments to
 illustrate that there is a certain objective basis to this chart.
