 [Rxcerpts$  Peking February 22 (APP)--Former president Richard Nixon met with the
 widow of Chinese Premier Chou En-lai here this morning to convey his condolences to
 her on the first full day of his visit to China.
 Accompanied by his wife Pat and Foreign Minister Chlao Kuan-hua, Mr Nixon met for
 55 minutes in the National People's Congress building here with the 71-year-old Mrs
 Teng Ying-Chao, who is herself a member of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
 The meeting was seen as a significant gesture by Mr Nixon because it was with Mr Chou
 that he worked to bring about the establishment of relations between China and the
 United States.
 The congress building was decked out with dozens of red flags, signifying the presence
 in the city of a foreign guest on an official visit.
 During the first few minutes of the meeting, reporters heard Mrs Teng, who was dressed
 in a light grey tunic and trousers, tell Mr Nixon that she had informed her husband
 in the hospital that the former president, had accepted his invitation to return to China.
 "Chou was quite pleased," she said.  "It was a great pity that Chou could not welcome
 you as he has left us."

 Mr Nixon, dressed in a blue suit, said he much regretted that he had not come in time to
 pay a last visit to the premier with whom he drafted the 1972 Shanghai Communique which
 "normalised" Sino-U.S. relations after 20 years of hostility.  "I have seen many world
 leaders," he said, "but Chou was a great man.   He had a good understanding of the whole
 world, not only his part of the world, and  a great ability to analyse problems.
 "He was pragmatic in his decisions in the best interest of his nation as well as of other
 nations.   The word tgreatf is used so much when leaders pass away and it begins to mean
 nothing, but in Chou's case he truly was a great leader,  He left a.legacy behind,"
 Mr Nixon said.

 Party, published a large frontpage photograph of the Nixons, arrival at Peking airport

 [Text]   Peking, February 22, 1976 (HSINHtJA)--Following is the full text of Acting
 'Premier Hua Kuo-feng's toast at the banquet in honour of Richard M. Nixon, former
 president of the United States of America, here this evening;
 Mr and Mrs Nixon, ladies and gentlemen, comrades and friends, Four years ago,
 President Nixon visited our country, and China and the United States issued the famous
 Shanghai Communique.   That historic event has played a major role in improving and
 developing Sine-U. S. relations and exerted a farreaching influence internationally.
 Mr Nixon certainly showed farsightedness in taking this courageous action in his
 Capacity as U.S. President at a time when contacts between the Chinese and American
 peoples had been suspended for more  than 20 years.   The redwood saplings President
 Nixon brought here as a gift from the American people to the Chinese people are growing
 sturdily, symbolizing a new phase of friendship between the Chinese and American
 peoples.   In the 4 years Since then, contacts between our two peoples have resumed
 .and the relations between our two countries improved on the basis of the principles set
 forth in the Shanghai Communique.   On the significant occasion of the fourth anniversary
 of President Nixon's first visit to China, Mr and Mrs Nixon have come again to visit
 our country at the invitation of the Chinese Government.   It is my pleasure to extend,
 on behalf of the Chinese Government and people, our warm welcome to you and the other
 American guests.
 The American people are a great people.  The Chinese people area great people.  Our
 two peoples have always been friendly to  each other.   True, China and the United
 States have different social systems and ideologies and there are differences of
 principle on quite a number of issues; however, our two countries have many points in
 common in the world today.   The Chinese Government has always pursued and will
 consistently pursue the line, principles and policies laid down by Chairman Mao in
 the field of foreign affairs.  We remain convinced that so long as both sides earnestly
 implement the principles of the Shanghai Communique, Sino-U. S. relations will further
 improve,, and that this conforms to the common desire of the Chinese and American
 peoples.
 In the past 4 years, the world has witnessed a series of important events, and
 encouraging changes have taken place in the international situation.  The situation
 characterized by great disorder under heaven is developing further and becoming better,
 and better.  The danger of the outbreak of a new war keeps growing as a re ult of the
 intense rivalry for world hegemony, and in particular, that imperialism wh`.ch flaunts
 the signboard of "socialism" has reanhed out its grasping hands everywhere and carried
 out rapid expansion; it has become the main source of war.   This is a fact which
 attracts people's attention today.  The only realistic and,effective way to cope with
 this situation is for the peoples of the world to heighten their vigilance, strengthen
 their unity and get well prepared against war.   It will be recalled that Mr Nixon
 wrote in June 1972 that aggressive ambitions are held in check not by idealism.   It,
 should also be noted that this expansionism is pitiable, being lacking. in capabilities
 though wild in ambition. [paragraph continues]

 Its aggression and expansion everywhere bear the seeds of defeat.  History has time
 and again proved that expansionists never come to a good end; such was the case with
 Hitler, and the hegemonism of today will come to no bettor end. It is the people, and
 definitely not hegemonism, that is really powerful.                a     .  .
 In China, a revolutionary mass debate is going on in such circles as education, science
 ..,A and technology.  It is a continuation and deepening of the Great Proletarian Cultural
 Revolution. It fully demonstrates the extensive democracy practised in our country
 under the system of socialism.  We are confident that, through this debate, Chairman
 Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will find its way deeper into the hearts of the
 people, and our socialist motherland will be further consolidated. It will. also enable
 us to do better in making a greater contribution to humanity in accordance with
 Chairman Mao's teachings.
 The next fifty to a hundred. years or so will be a great era. of radical change through-
 out the world, an earth-shaking era without equal in any previous?historicalperiod.
 The road of advance of human history is always tortuous, but we firmly believe that
 the people of the world, by waging unremitting struggle, will usher.in a most
 splendid future.
 Finally, I propose a toast to the health of former U.S. President Nixon and Mrs Nixon.
 to the health of the., other American guests, to the health of all friends and comrades
 present,, and to the friendship between the Chinese and American peoplesi

 President Richard M. Nixontm toast at the banquet given in his honour by the State
 Council here this evening:
 Mr acting Premier. Mr Foreign Minister, and all of you distinguished guests on this
 very happy occasion,
 Soon after we arrived last night in Peking for our second visit, a Chinese friend said
 to me that to meet someone after a long period of being apart is a special pleasure.
 That is exactly the way we feel tonight,
 As it has already been indicated that it was just 4 years ago. this week that the
 Shanghai Communique was issued, [as received] [Peking NCNA Domestic Service in Chinese
 at.1840 GMT on 22 February renders this sentence as follows: "As it has already been
 indicated, it was just 4 years ago this week that the Shanghai Communique was issued."]
 That historic document ended a generation of confrontation and conflict between our
 two countries and began an era  of negotiation and consultation and also progress
 toward both goals we share together.
 Acting Premier Hua tonight has eloquently supported the principles of the Shanghai
 Communique.  And President Ford in his state visit to China in December strongly
 affirmed the support of the United States for tie.principles of the Shanghai Communique.
 This indicates that this document was something more than the usual statement signed by
 two leaders of a nation or two nations at any particular time.  [Peking NCNA Domestic
 Service in Chinese at 1840 GMT on 22 February renders this sentence as follows:  "This
 indicates that this document was more important than any usual statement of a general
 nature signed-by the leaders of two countries and by two countries."]  Because what
 we see here is that while the interests of great powers are involved that even though
 the leaders may change the interests remain the same.  And this is because the principles
 of the Shanghai Communique were principles that were in the interests of both the Pe9ple's
 Republic of China and the United States of America.  Those principles are   just as
 strongly held 'today as they were 4 years ago.

 TNTERNATIONAL APQATRS
 I recall that I first had the honour of meeting Chairman Mao 4 years ago.  We s  ~?.e'
 very candidly and honestly about the fact that we came from different backgrounds
 and that we had many areas in which our beliefs on philosophical, political and eccr.c.:'
 matters were different.
 What then brought us together?  This was the answer:  History has brought us together.
 And now 4 years after that meeting history calls on our two nations to continue to
 work together to build on the foundation that we laid 4 years ago and to build on the
 document which set forth the principles on which we had agreed.  We must realize how
 vital it is to do so, because the future not only of the 800 million people who live
 in the People's Republic of China and the 200 million people who live in the United
 States of America but the future of all the people in this world depend upon the
 reliability, and the capability and the determination of our two nations to work
 together for the cause of peace with security for all nations.
 There are of caurse some who believe that the mere act of signing a statement of
 principles or a diplomatic conference will bring instant and lasting peace.  This is
 naive.  There cannot and will not be lasting and secure peace until every nation in
 the world respects the security and independence of every other nation large or small.
 Let me illustrate that point by reading directly from the Shanghai Communique: "Both
 sides are of the view that it will be against the interests of the peoples of the
 world for any major country to collude with another against other countries or for major
 countries to divide up the world into spheres of influence." [Peking NCNA Domestic
 Service in Chinese at 1840 GMT on 22 February renders the final phase as.  "Spheres of
 interests.,"]
 And when all countries in the world as have the People's Republic of China and the
 United States of America subscribed to the supported that principle.   [Peking NCNA
 Domestic Service in Chinese at 1840 GMT on 22 February renders the immediately
 preceding words as:   "supported those principles,] then there will be real peace and
 security for all countries in the world.
 In his remarks tonight the acting premier has spoken eloquently of the redwood saplings
 that we had the honour to plant at the beautiful city of Hangehow 4 years ago.   CPekint
 NCNA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1840 GMT on 22 February omitted the words "beautiful
 city" in referring to Hangchow]   Wheh my daughter Julie and her husband David Eisenhower
 returned from their trip to China, they told us that they had been informed in Hangchow
 that over 5,000 seeds had already been taken from those saplings and will be planted
 all over China.  And when a dinner was given for them as they were about to leave China
 from Shanghai, their Chinese host made the statement that those California redwoods
 were a symbol of the evergreen friendship between China and the United States.  And
 tonight I hope and trust that in the years ahead like the giant California redwoods
 China and the United States will grow strong and tall in their friendship.
 And so it is in that spirit that I ask you to join me in the return toast   To Chairman
 Mao, to the Acting Premier Hua. to all of our hosts and your guests and to the evergreen
 friendship of the Chinese people and the American people.

 [Excerpts]  Peking, Feb 22 (APP)--Speaking at a banquet given for him by* Chinese leaders,
 Mr Nixon clung to the subject of Sino-American relations since his "historic" visit to
 Peking exactly 4 years ago when he was the American president.
 ?-a
 Mr Nixonts speech followed one made by his host, tava 1(uo-feng, who was ape:;king officially
 for the first time since being named as interim prime minister or February 7.
 Mr Nixon spoke with dignity and barely-concealed sentimentality of what was probably his
 greatest success in international affairs:  The establishing of better relations between
 People's China and the United States following his last Peking visit.
 Mr Nixon said:  "This document (the Shanghai Communique) is something more than a statement
 signed by two leaders of two nations at any particular time.  Even if the leaders may
 change, the interests remain the same,
 "The principles of the Shanghai Communique are in the interests of the peoples of the USA
 and of China".
 Through that statement, the former president seemed to be referring at the same time to
 his own forced resignation in 1974, to prime minister Chou En-lai's death and, perhaps,
 to the disgrace that is apparently threatening Tang Heiao-Ping who, only 2 weeks ago,
 had seemed destined to succeed Mr Chou.
 Previously, Mr Rua had emphasized that Sine-American relations "will further improve so
 long as both sides earnestly implement the principles of the Shanghai Communique".
 Among the Chinese present at the banquet were three former Kuomintang (Nationalist army)
 officers who were freed last year after having been in prison since 1949.  The diplomatic
 corps was not present at the reception, with the exception of certain members of the
 U.S. Liaison Office here.  The musical programme was very similar to that of Mr Nixon's
 last visit and included "Rome of the Range", "Turkey in the Straw" and "Beautiful America".

 NIXON VISITS PEKING AGRICULTURE S}OiIBIP

 [By George Biannic]
 [Excerpt] Peking, Feb 23 (AFP)'>-Former President Richard Nixon, here on an official visit,
 said today that in the future China would become "a great industrial power".  Mr Nixon
 was speaking after a visit lasting more than 2 hours to an agricultural exhibition
 aimed at showing progress made by China in the agricultural.sphere over recent years.
 He said that China had avoided the "mistake" often made by developing countries which
 sought "instant" industrialisation and let agriculture fall behind".  He added. "As a
 result neither succeeds because without a firm and strong agriculture there cannot be
 the industrial growth that a country needs.
 "This exhibition does indicate emphasis on agriculture that speaks well for the future
 development of the  People's Republic of China not only as a nation that can feed and
 clothe and house its people thanks to agriculture but also as a nation that will be a
 great industrial power".  Mr Nixon, who was accompanied by his wife Pat, showed  seat
 interest in. all aspects of Chinese agriculture asking a number of questions of
 mechanisation and distribution networks etc.
 On leaving the exhibition hall accompanied by Deputy Chinese Agriculture Minister Hsiao
 Peng, who acted as a guide to P_esident Gerald ford when he was here last December,
 Mr Nixon, who is being received here as if he were a head of state, seemed to forr;et
 that he is now no more than an ordinary visitor.  Tt was as a representative of t;-ac
 United States that he proposed agricultural cooperation between America and China
 saying that the two countries could work together because ti:e;r had both made :great
 progress in agriculture not only on the production side but also in the field of
 distribution.

 [That)  Peking, rebruaxy 21, 1976 (HSYNHUA)--The new tsars have recently indulged
 themselves in abusive rhetoric and gone to such length as to trot out a philosophy of
 abuse.  Singing high praises of abuse, the Soviet LITERARY GAZETTE not long ago
 carried a remarkable article tracing the "history of abuse" and suing up the
 Russian 'cart" of using invectives.  In all seriousness, it calls abuse a weapon   to be
 used to confirm moral superiority".  "Civilized abuse" and "positive abuse" will be
 very useful, it asserts.  Now invectives could be "civilized" and what "art" is needed
 when they are used to pursue political aims--these are best exemplified in the Soviet
 press and by the performances of Soviet diplomats abroad.
 In a vociferous frenzied campaign of abuse launched recently by the new tsars, all their

 Soviet ambassadors, counsellors and corresponde
