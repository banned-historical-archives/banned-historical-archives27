 CONE DENTIAL
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 Political activity in Leb-
 anon is reviving.                         Speaker of
 Parliament Usayran professes
 to be confident that a quorum
 will be on hand for the presi-
 dential  election                            session  he
 called for 31 July after cancel-
 ing the session scheduled for
 24 July.  Opposition leaders,
 although they are still insist-
 ing they will not participate
 in any election until American
 troops have been withdrawn from
 the country, are considering
 candidates.  The leading con-
 tender in the opposition's mind
 appears to be Yusuf Hitti, a
 nonentity who presumably would
 be easy for the pro-Nasir ele-
 ments to manage.   President
 Chamoun is putting forward simi-
 lar candidates on his side--
 Jawad Bulus, a respected Maro-
 nite savant who seems to have
 a number of supporters but lit-
 tle influence, and Alfred Naq-
 qash,   a  70-year-old  former
 foreign minister.  General Shi-
 hab is no longer being seriously
 considered by the civilians, al-
 though some army officers still
 hope for a coup to put him in.
 Rebel  military  activity,
 which dropped off sharply when
 the American forces  arrived,
 shows signs of resuming its us-
 ual pattern.   Kamil Jumblatt's
 Druze rebels are again moving
 on the Beirut-Damascus road,
 courtesy of the army which has
 vacated positions opposing them,
 and reports of larger scale in-
 filtration from Syria are again
 being received.  There has been
 no indication of a rebel inten-
 tion to attack the  American
 forces,   although  sniping  at
 American aircraft continues.
 As tight a security lid as
 King Husayn's  government can
 forge has been placed on Jordan,
 but officials still fear the
 outbreak of disorders or a coup
 attempt. Disturbances seem par-
 ticularly likely to occur in
 West Jordan if the Western pow-
 ers appear to be becoming rec-
 onciled to the new Iraqi regime.
 Husayn and Prime Minister Rifai
 have stopped pressing for Ameri-
 can troops to join the British
 forces in Jordan, although they
 would still like to have them.
 Rifai's latest concern is Jor-
 dan's isolation from interna-
 tional air traffic, which oc-   25X1
 curred when the UAR banned the 25X1
 craft over its territory.
 Iraq
 The new regime in Baghdad
 has further     consolidated its
 position.    Reports from the
 provinces this week indicate
 that there was very little if
 any opposition anywhere to the
 coup, although the middle class
 generally has adopted a "wait-
 and-see" attitude.   Public serv-
 ices and communications have
 been restored throughout the
 country, the curfew period in
 Baghdad has been abbreviated,
 and the border with Syria has
 been opened, although others
 remain closed.   Officials of the
 regime have continued to pre-
 sent an appearance of friendli-
 ness toward the West and have
 reiterated assurances that they
 will respect existing oil agree-
 ments,   although  they  do  wish

 to     renegotiate  them  in  due
 course.
 Behind the facade of calm
 and friendly assurances, how-
 ever, the Iraqis have clearly
 been fearful, of Western inter-
 vention against them and have
 sought Nasir's full support.  On
 19 July an Iraqi delegation head-
 ed by Colonel Arif, deputy prime
 minister  and  possibly  the
 "strong man" of the regime,
 signed an alliance treaty with
 Nasir in Damascus.
 It is also clear that the
 Iraqi regime intends to follow
 Nasir's policy, even if it does
 not actually join the UAR.  Colo-
 nel Arif, who does most of the
 speaking for the regime, has of-
 ficially defined the new course

 against the new look
 in Baghdad.   His trip
 to Moscow and a private
 UAR propaganda line
 that the purpose of this
 trip was to persuade
 the Kremlin not to in-
 tervene in the Middle
 East  were almost cer-
 tainly aimed in part
 at frightening the
 West.  UAR officials
 are evidently fearful
 nevertheless that they
 may find themselves at
 war With the West, and
 military preparations
 have been hastened in
 both Egypt and Syria
 against such an even-
 tuality.                                                                              Emphasis has
 been placed on antiair-
 craft defenses ; ships
 loaded with cement are
 reported in position in
 the Suez  'Canal;  and
 the  ports  of  both
 countries have  been
 closed  during  the
 night.    Much  of

 and may be designed to reassure
 the populace, particularly in
 Egypt, of the UAR's ability to
 meet hostile attack.  At the
 same time, however, Nasir and
 UAR agents have been active in
 seeking to exploit other periph-
 eral situations to  undermine
 the  Western  position in the
 area.
 The Ruler of oil-rich Ku-
 wait, who has been in Damascus
 on vacation, had two interviews
 with Nasir this week, and is
 reported to have assured the
 UAR leader of his good will,
 citing the fact that he had re-
 sisted efforts to bring him in-
 to the Iraqi-Jordanian union.
 While there is no confirmation
 of Syrian press assertions that
 Kuwait may soon join the UAR,
 public sentiment in Kuwait fa-
 vors such a move, and the Ruler
 might  do  so if  only to use
 Nasir for protection against
 the revolutionary Iraqis.
 In the Sudan, pro-Western-
 Prime Minister Khalil is facing
 discord within his own party
 and increased activity by the
 opposition, partly at least
 Egyptian-inspired.  A unanimous
 vote by the Sudanese Senate on
 23 July  condemning  American
 landings in Lebanon and  the
 British action in Jordan  sug-
 gests that Khalil may be losing
 his hold over even his own fol-
 lowers.
 The Saudi Government,
 fearful that the revolutionary
 surge may engulf it along with    25X6
 Iraq, is pursuing an open policy
 Israel
 The Israeli Government re-
 mains alert to possible dangers
 to  it  in  the  Middle  East
 situation, but has not yet mo-
 bilized reservists other than
 those probably needed to plan
 more general action.   Tel Aviv,
 concerned that its acquiescence
 in the British airlift to Jordan
 will serve to identify it fur-
 ther as a tool of imperialism
 in the minds Of neutralist Asian
 and African nations, is protest-
 ing vigorously against the con-
 tinuation of the operation.
 The Israelis are redoubling their
 efforts to obtain promises of
 Western support and materiel.
 Foreign Minister Meir is now on
 a mission to Western Europe for
 that purpose.
 SINO-SOVIET AND FREE-WORLD REACTIONS TO MIDDLE EAST CRISIS
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev's  I lomatic and propaganda campaign
 ostensibly favorable reply to
 American and British proposals
 for a UN Security Council ses-
 sion at the heads-of -government
 level is designed to maintain
 the momentum of the bloc's dip-
 to exploit Arab-Asian opposition
 to Western policies in the Mid-
 dle East.    The Soviet response
 attempts to construe the Western
 letters as acceptance of Khru-
 shchev's 19 July proposals and

 is deliberately ambiguous as to
 the agenda, participants, and
 procedure of such a meeting so
 as to maintain maximum freedom
 of maneuver.   Moscow's aim ap-
 parently is to ensure that all
 the important discussions will
 be conducted in a Security Coun-
 cil subcommittee composed of the
 Big Four and India plus repre-
 sentatives bf "interested Arab
 states."
 The Soviet summit call
 highlights a concerted bloc cam-
 paign to extract maximum diplo-
 matic and propaganda benefit
 from the Western landings in
 Lebanon and Jordan and to in
 hibit additional Western mili-
 tary moves against the "Arab
 liberation movement."  Moscow
 moved promptly to establish dip-
 lomatic relations with the new
 Iraqi Government and to extend
 its diplomatic and propaganda
 support.   Bloc embassy officials
 in various world capitals pri-
 vately have pressed the line
 that the USSR is not particular-
 ly concerned by Western troops
 in Lebanon and Jordan, but that
 any military move against-Iraq,
 either alone or in concert with
 Baghdad Pact countries, will
 provoke "serious" but unspeci-
 fied Soviet counteraction.
 the Soviet chargd in Ankara
 that Turkey "will refrain from
 taking any steps which might in-
 crease tension."  This appears
 to be part of a coordinated ef-
 fort to reinforce psychological
 pressures on Western and neutral
 countries as to dangers inherent
 in the Western moves.
 Although the Arab press
 has yeported Soviet assurances
 of "volunteers" in the event of
 Western military action against
 the UAR or Iraq, Moscow has not
 played up this possibility in
 the present crisis.   Moscow ra-
 dio has devoted more attention
 to present Middle Eastern de-
 velopments than to any other
 international matter  in the
 whole post-Stalin period.   Mos-
 cow propaganda does not reflect
 concern that Soviet security
 has been threatened by the land-
 ings in Lebanon and Jordan, al-
 though frequent reference is
 made to the dangers of "world
 conflagration" which might arise
 from a continuation of Western
 aggressive moves in the area.
 Massive "popular demonstra-
 tions" throughout the bloc and
 the Soviet Aviation Day speeches
 of Marshals Malinovsky and Ver-
 shinin on 20 July were designed
 to reinforce the false sense of
 crisis contained in the Khru-
 shchev summit letters.
 Neither Moscow nor Cairo
 has released the substance of
 the secret Khrushchev-Nasir
 consultations held in Moscow
 on 16-17 July, but Khrushchev
 at the Polish Embassy reception
 on 22 July stated that he and
 Nasir reached "an identity of
 views."  Nasir's brief public
 account of the talks and press
 accounts originating from Da-
 mascus and Cairo reinforce the
 popular image of close Soviet-
 UAR collaboration.
 Soviet maneuvers in the UN
 have been designed to mobilize
 world-wide opposition to recent
 American amd British action in
 the Middle East and to forestall

 moves.    Soviet UN delegate A. A.
 Sobolev on 22 July, following
 Security Council rejection of
 Soviet amendments, vetoed the
 watered-down Japanese resolution
 to strengthen the UN Observation
 Group in Lebanon, suggesting
 Moscow is more interested in
 keeping the issue alive before
 the UN than in gaining early
 withdrawal of American troops
 from Lebanon.
 On 19 July,Sobolev vetoed
 the American proposal for send-
 ing a UN emergency force to Leb-
 anon in line with Moscow's long-
 standing opposition to such UN
 forces.   The 18 July Soviet pro-
 posal for calling a special ses-
 sion of the  General  Assembly
 was not voted on
 Moscow wou
 hold off pressing  or an immedi-
 ate assembly meeting pending
 Western response to Soviet pro-
 posals for a summit meeting.
 Peiping's Reaction
 Since 17 July, the  day
 after the Western intervention,
 Communist China's press and ra-
 dio lave devoted almost exclu-
 sive attention to the situation,
 and Peiping has joined Moscow
 in a massive propaganda counter-
 attack against the West's "ag-
 gression."  Mass protest rallies
 were held from 17  to 21 July
 throughout the mainland surpass-
 ing those held during the Suez
 crisis; Peiping claimed on 21
 July that some 21,000,000 Chi-
 nese had participated in demon-
 strations.
 There are still no signs
 that Peiping is considering any
 kind of major military diversion
 in the Far East.   Chinese Com-
 munist efforts, like those of
 Moscow, have been aimed chiefly
 at limiting and containing West-
 ern intervention, while whipping
 up world opinion in opposition
 to the West.
 Apparently confident that
 diplomacy and propaganda. can
 bring about a disaster for the
 West, Peiping has made no direct
 mention of "volunteers" nor has
 it indicated any intention to
 intervene directly under present
 circumstances.
 Free-world opinion has
 rapidly accepted the fact that
 the next approach to the Middle
 East problem will be through a
 summit conference under UN aus-
 pices.   Many countries neverthe-
 less harbor  deep  misgivings,
 fearing that the meeting will
 not produce any progress toward
 a solution, and several nations
 not now members of the Security
 Council are pleading their cases
 for inclusion in the discussions.
 The Asian Baghdad Pact
 powers are especially skeptical
 of the meeting's  ability  to
 achieve a satisfactory solution.
 Other Asian countries, such as
 Ceylon and Indonesia, will feel
 that they have less opportunity
 to be heard than in a General
 Assembly session.
 Those most directly con-
 cerned with the Middle East are
 anxiously: awaiting clarification
 as  to  which  Arab  countries
 Khrushchev  referred  to  in
 his note of 23 July. Nasir  has
 indicated a desire to come to
 New York, and all other Arab
 countries will  probably  also
 wish to be represented.   Both
 Israel and Turkey feel  they
 should attend any Middle East
 meeting, raising the possibility
 that Iran and Pakistan may also
 put in their bids.       Recrimina-
 tions from rejected countries
 will be directed toward  those

 powers responsible for the se-
 lection.
 North Atlantic       Council
 discussions have brought out
 differences among NATO allies
 as  to  the objectives  of a
 summit  meeting.  At a 23 July
 meeting,   the  German  repre-
 sentative,                        supported  by the
 French, Italians,   Dutch, Turks,
 and Belgians,   expressed  deep
 concern lest    the  discussions
 with   the  Soviet Union be
 broadened to  cover   long-range
 Middle  East  problems.   They
 did  not appear  satisfied
 with   the British  statement
 that only the  pending immedi-
 ate                problems  of Jordan and
 Lebanon would  be discussed,
 with broader  questions  neces-
 sarily awaiting  more extensive
 Western consultation.
 UN Secretary General Ham-
 marskjold                   takes the  posi-
 tion  that  his previous                 terms
 of  reference  are  sufficient
 for  the time  being  to enable
 him  to proceed legally despite
 the  Soviet veto  of  the Japa-
 nese  resolution.   He plans to
 retain political control    of
 the  enlarged  group himself.
 Despite  his previous reluctance,
 the secretary  general  now ap-
 pears  willing to set up a force
 as  large as necessary to con-
 trol the situation.
 Meanwhile, additional na-
 tions are recognizing the new
 Iraqi regime.   Sino-Soviet bloc
 countries have all recognized
 Iraq.   With India's recognition
 on 23 July, the number of Asian
 and African nations following
 suit is expected to increase
 materially.   Indonesia,  the Su-
 dan, and Tunisia took the step
 prior to India.   Since West Ger-
 many also appears to favor rec-
 ognition, a general movement in
 this direction may develop soon
 in Western Europe.
 Western Europe
 Both France and Germany seem
 apprehensive lest too- close a con-
 nection with the Anglo-American
 intervention hurt their own stand-
 ing with the Arabs.   Bonn wishes
 to maintain its economic interests
 and preserve its political neu-
 trality in the Middle East.   The
 De Gaulle government fears the in-
 tervention may have harmful reper
 cussions in North Africa, and Paris
 now seems anxious to avoid joining
 in the intervention.  Although De
 Gaulle appears to agree with a
 Foreign Ministry group that has
 been urging that the close French-
 Israeli diplomatic and military
 contacts be played down, a stand-
 ing agreement with Tel Aviv for a
 French landing in Israel in cer-
 tain circumstances may already e,dst.
 Among Western European de-
 mocracies, the Netherlands Govern-
 ment has offered the firmest sup-
 port of the intervention. Austria,
 while privately approving, has
 stated it.will p-erndt no more military
 overflights of its territory for
 the present.   Sweden failed to
 persuade Norway and Denmark to
 take a joint approach in urging
 Western acceptance of Khrushchev's
 call for summit talks. Of NATO
 members, only Canada called for a
 "positive" response.
 Latin America
 Official reactions to the
 Middle Eastern events have ranged
 from full support of the US posi-
 tion by most of the smaller coun-
 tries to only very tentative sup-
 port by Mexico.
 There is serious concern
 among some that the t1UN  may
 be  weakened  by  what  the
 Mexican  foreign  minister  re-
 ferred                                                                to as  the  threat
 of a  return  to  "unilateral

 BRITAIN'S MOVES :IN THE ;MIDDLE ;EAST
 The gradual but steady con-
 centration of British forces in
 the Mediterranean, Arabian pen-
 insula, and Indian Ocean areas
 appears designed to enable Brit-
 ain to retain control through-
 out the Persian Gulf area and
 particularly to safeguard the
 vital Kuwait oil supply.   The
 British will probably not oc-
 cupy Kuwait's oil installations
 against the wishes of the Ku-
 waiti authorities unless trou-
 ble develops.
 The populace in Kuwait has
 welcomed the Iraqi coup, but
 authorities have told Brit-Ain
 they can maintain order and
 would consider occupation of
 the airfield premature at this
 time.   If a quick airdrop be-
 comes necessary, a paratroop
 battalion is available on Cyprus.
 In the event of overflight prob-
 lems, infantry units would have
 to be sent by sea from Bahrein.
 A British official in Kuwait
 claims troops could be there
 in six hours.
 No animosity or discrimination
 has been shown to Americans or
 the British so far, but the Amer-
 ican Consulate expects trouble,
 as the reformist nationalists
 have been ominously silent.
 In contrast to Kuwait, the
 Ruler of Bahrein has agreed to
 receive British reinforcements,
 and a battalion has already ar-
 rived.   A destroyer en route
 to Bahrein will i augment  ? the
 normal patrol vessels in the
 Persian Gulf.
 The British were also con-
 cerned about possible disturb-
 ances in Qatar, where sabotage
 occurred during the Suez crisis,
 and sent a frigate with a land-
 ing party aboard to stand by.
 The frigate returned to Bahrein
 when the strike of native oil
 workers was settled without in-
 cident on 21 July.
 Libya
 In order to protect and if
 necessary evacuate the King of
 Libya,
 The British political agent
 appears to  have developed a
 good working relationship with
 Acting Ruler Abdullah Mubarrak.

 ported Mubarrak for:the succes-
 sion and might try to work out

 should move closer  to Nasir.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 The British in Aden are
 preparing for increased Yemeni
 agitation.   The Anglo-Yemeni
 talks in Ethiopia on 14 July
 produced reasonably friendly
 discussion but no agreements.
 Britain has declared it will
 extend both economic and mili-
 tary aid to the prospective fed-
 eration of Aden principalities
 and may specify details in talks
 planned shortly between the
 rulers and the governor of Aden.
 Meanwhile, preventive aerial
 reconnaissance of Yemeni terri-
 tory has increased.
 London  has indicated it
 will increase  both  its eco-
 nomic and military aid to the
 Sultan of Muscat beyond that
 originally planned
 There have been indications
 for some time of a prospective
 increase in Omani rebel activi-
 ty.
 Jordan
 In an effort to minimize
 friction, the 1,700 to 1,800
 troops are confined mostly to
 the Amman airfield.   Forces are
 being supplied via overflights
 of Israel--high and at night,
 at Israeli request--but London
 is urgently attempting to or-
 ganize shipments through the
 Suez Canal.   The War Office has
 declined to specify London's
 next move should Nasir refuse
 permission to use the canal.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 MIDDLE EAST OIL SITUATION
 Iraq
 The Iraqi regime's assur-
 ances to the West that the flow
 of oil will not be interrupted
 are probably aimed at discour-
 aging Western intervention.   As
 a result of the confusion, how-
 ever, tankers initially were
 stopped from proceeding up the
 Shatt al Arab River to the Iraqi
 ports of Fao and Basra.   A few
 tanker diversions to other ports
 did occur, but the situation
 now is normal.   Shipments of
 Iraqi oil to Jordan, which began
 just before the coup, have been
 halted, thus stranding in Iraq
 about half of Jordan's tank
 trucks.
 Iraqi cooperation with the
 UAR on oil matters has already
 begun.

 Oil continues to flow from
 Kuwait, the Middle East's larg-
 est producer, at a record rate
 of nearly 1,600,000 barrels a
 day, and there are no indications
 that the flow will be  halted.
 However, riots, strikes, and
 sabotage are possible.  Over
 half the approximately 200,000
 inhabitants of Kuwait come from
 Arab Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and
 Egypt.   These elements are pre-
 dominantly responsive to Nasir's
 brand of revolutionary national-
 ism, as are many of the remain-
 ing 100,000 Kuwaitis.
 Commenting on widespread
 reports that Kuwait would soon
 join the UAR, an official Syrian
 spokesman stated that "no formal
 decision has been taken thus far"
 but that the UAR welcomes the Ku-
 waiti  people to "join the caravan
 of liberated Arab nationalism."

 Saudi Arabia's denial of
 overflight permission to US air-
 craft for an airlift of products
 from the  Bahrein refinery to
 Jordan derives from Crown Prince
 Faysal's policy of seeking an
 The Saudi Council of Minis-
 ters--a body headed by Faysal--
 has just issued a decree  an-
 nouncing that the 44,000-square-
 mile "preferential area" west
 of the Aramco concession and
 encompassing the city of Riyadh
 will be broken up and given out
 to possibly as many as ten dif-
 ferent companies.   The  Royal
 Council apparently does not in-
 tend to honor its contractual
 agreement with Aramco guarantee-
 ing the company what amounts to
 a first refusal on this area.
 Bahrein is a relatively
 large supplier of military POL
 requirements for both British
 and American military  units,
 although it is not an important
 oil producer by Middle Eastern
 standards and accounts for only
 about  37,500 barrels  a day--
 less than 1 percent of produc-
 tion in the area.   Bahrein has
 a major refinery with a capacity
 of 211,000 barrels of crude a
 day and cracking facilities for
 43,320 barrels a day.
 American refinery officials
 on British-controlled Bahrein
 fear there is an even chance of
 a strike, since the refinery em-
 ploys about 1,000 Iraqi Arabs
 plus numerous other pro-Nasir
 groups.   During the Suez crisis,
 acts of sabotage did occur at
 the refinery.   The Ruler of
 Bahrein, the British political
 agent, and the American refinery
 manager all feel that sabotage
 is  inevitable  without  heavy
 guard.   It is doubtful, however,
 whether a heavy guard could pre-
 vent violence.
 The present crisis has had
 no effect on Iranian production
 or transportation of oil, and
 the Tehran government is unlike-
 ly to take any  action  which
 would either halt or reduce the
 flow of its oil to the West.
 The major oil terminal and re-
 finery area of Abadan has been
 heavily reinforced by Iranian
 troops, and travel in the area
 has been restricted.  Friction
 is said to be developing between
 the thousands of Arabs employed
 locally and the Iranians, and
 Arab- or Communist-directed vio-
 lence may develop.
 Preparation for Sabotage
 Iraq and the UAR have made
 preparations for denying oil to
 the West.   Two old barges have
 been towed by the Iraqi regime
 to the Iraqi port of Fao at the
 mouth of the Shatt al Arab River,
 which forms part of the Iraq-
 Iran border.   These barges if
 sunk  would  block  the river
 channel, effectively denying
 oil tanker transit not only to
 the Iraqi ports of Fao and Basra
 but to the Iranian oil terminals
 of Abadan and Khorramshahr as
 well.   Cairo is said to have
 moved at least two cement-loaded
 block ships into position  in
 the Suez Canal.    Explosive
 charges have long been in place
 along the Iraqi and Saudi pipe-
 lines which pass through Syria,
 but it is not  believed  Nasir
 will  destroy  them   unless
 his  position  worsens  con-
 siderably.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 Prospects
 With the exception of Iran,
 all of the major Middle Eastern
 oil-producing countries now
 have indicated some degree of
 responsiveness to Nasir's influ-
 ence.  While Iraq has assured
 the West that oil will continue
 to flow, it has declared its ad-
 herence to Nasir's brand of na-
 tionalism and has announced its
 intention to seek renegotiation
 of IPC's concession  agreement.
 Even the conservative and pro-
 Western regime of the late Nurd
 Said of Iraq, however, was be-
 ginning to pressure the IPC for
 substantial changes in the com-
 pany's concession area  and a
 change in the profit split toward
 the newly established  75-25
 Iranian pattern.
 The Rulor of Kuwait, who
 is still in Syria, may have come
 to some form of working arrange-
 ment with Nasir during his two
 meetings with him there, although
 the Ruler's. main concern is prob-
 ably to protect his own income.
 Before he went to Damascus, he
 had been urging an accommoda-
 tion with Cairo as the  only
 practical course.   In Saudi
 Arabia, the recent developments
 make clear that future oil poli- 25X1
 cy will be determined with one
 eye directed toward Cairo.
 25X1
 GENEVA TECHNICAL CONFERENCE ON TEST DETECTION
 The Soviet delegation to
 the Geneva technical conference
 appears to be seeking  a wide
 enough measure to agreement to
 handicap the West in insisting
 on more  extensive inspection
 measures and bring pressure to
 bear on Britain and the United
 States to halt tests.   In pur-
 suit            of this objective,   the
 Soviet delegation has conceded
 that  limited flights   by air-
 craft to collect samples of nu-
 clear debris could be made under
 certain circumstances over So-
 viet and US territory.
 The Soviet delegates aban-
 doned their  insistence  that
 surface stations alone be used
 to collect nuclear debris and
 agreed to the use of aircraft
 over oceans and, if a test alert
 resulted from other detection
 techniques,.  over  Soviet and
 American territory.   Soviet
 delegates have also hinted at
 agreeing to mobile ground in-
 spection after a test alert at
 the option of an international
 control body.
 At an informal meeting on
 17 July, Soviet delegates made
 a strong bid  for concluding a
 unanimous agreement on a control
 system and thereby avoiding an
 intergovernmental dispute. They
 argued that  this was possible
 if the West did not  make too
 extensive demands for inspec-
 tion.   The  Soviet  delegates
 claimed that an elaborate inspec-
 tion system that could guarantee
 a high probability of detection
 was unnecessary because no coun-
 try would undertake nuclear tests
 if there were any real likelihood
 of detection.   They  suggested
 that a minimal control   system
 could be established initially
 which-could be expanded when
 more highly developed detection
 techniques were perfected.   The
 delegation appears interested
 in getting agreement on the out-
 line of an inspection system
 without much consideration of
 its details, an approach that

 could exaggerate the amount of
 agreement that had actually been
 reached.   The Soviet delegation
 has not presented as much scien-
 tific evidence for its proposals
 as have the Western scientists.
 The conference has reached
 agreement on acoustic and nu-
 clear debris sampling methods
 of detection, but some differ-
 ences still remain on seismic
 and electromagnetic methods.
 While the scope of inspec-
 tion that Moscow might agree to
 will not be clear until there
 is a comprehensive discussion of
 control systems, the scientific
 papers thus far presented by
 bloc scientists at Geneva are
 designed to prove that a suffi-
 cient degree of inspection can
 be achieved with a modest inspec-
 tion system.   A remark by one
 Soviet delegate that it will be
 difficult to complete the con-
 ference before 6 August suggests
 that the USSR does not plan any
 abrupt break in talks after the
 30 days it originally specified
 for the conference have elapsed.
 OSI)
 (Concurred  in  by     25X1
 According to present pros-
 pects, the USSR will have a bump-
 er harvest this fall--possibly
 the largest in Soviet history.
 Favorable weather, following a
 late, cool spring, has prevailed
 thus far in most of  the  new
 lands and in the traditional
 growing areas.   The American
 Embassy comments it has become
 increasingly apparent  in  re-
 cent weeks that if favorable
 weather continues, a record crop
 could be harvested this year.
 Khrushchev,  in his 17 June
 report  to the central committee
 on agricultural procurement, in-
 dicated that prospects were
 good for most crops, and Minis-
 ter of Agriculture Matskevich
 said that as of 10 July the con-
 dition of grain crops was good
 almost everywhere, except for
 some districts in the Urals and
 western and northern Kazakhstan.
 A Gosplan official recently told
 an American delegation of agri-
 cultural economists that the
 grain harvest would exceed that
 of 1956,  the best year thus far.
 In 1956, harvest losses
 caused by both rainy weather
 during the harvest season and by
 inadequate transportation and
 storage facilities were high in
 the new lands area.   Storage
 facilities have been substan-
 tially expanded since that time.
 A bumper grain harvest this
 year would enable the USSR to
 increase its exports to non-
 bloc countries and to the Euro-
 pean satellites, especially in
 the south, where prospects are
 for a small-grain harvest some-
 what below average.   Although
 serious floods may be developing
 in China, Peiping will probably
 not receive agricultural prod-
 ucts from the USSR.   The flow
 of agricultural products has
 been traditionally from China
 to the USSR.
 A bumper harvest would
 also aid in the drive to catch
 up with the United States in
 meat and milk production.   Milk
 production may increase suffi-
 ciently in 1958 for the USSR to
 claim to have caught up with or
 even to have surpassed  the
 United States in total produc-
 tion.   In 1957 the USSR claimed
 to have produced 95 percent as
 much milk as the US; a more ac-
 curate comparison, however,
 would probably put Soviet milk
 production closer to 85 percent
 of that of the United States.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 Peiping's "rectification"
 campaign, which is the regime's
 systematic program for refining
 Communist cadres to the point
 where they are capable of reg-
 imenting the populace without
 provoking antiregime sentiments,
 is "nearing conclusion" in cen-
 tral government departments.
 Rectification in these depart-
 ments has been'the pilot for the
 over-all `campaign,   and  last
 week's announcement that 90 per-
 cent of them will conclude their
 drives by the end of July sug-
 gests that Peiping expects to
 wind up rectification in all are-
 as,by fall.  The campaign for
 the past several months has been
 directed toward drumming up pop-
 ular enthusiasm for the regime's
 all-out production effort, and
 the Chinese Communist party con-
 tinues to avoid the crude and
 repressive measures used in na-
 tional campaigns during 1950-54.
 During the present cam-
 paign, the regime has attempted
 to appear solicitous in redress-
 ing popular grievances against
 Communist cadres.   The People's
 Daily on several occasions has
 attacked the "phenomenon of in-
 equality," which it admits still
 exists in the relationship be-
 tween leaders and the public.
 Public debate and the lodging
 of popular protests have been
 stressed as the means for pre-
 venting discontent arising from
 the "mistakes" of cadres.
 Posters with large Chinese
 characters,   which  have  been
 plastered on factory buildings
 and agricultural cooperative
 headquarters, were declared on
 17 July to be the    "permanent
 method of airing views in the
 future."  Unlike the free-speech
 period  during  the  spring  of
 1957, however, the criticisms
 contained in the posters apply
 only to lower level cadres and
 administrative personnel--in-
 cluding some plant managers--
 and for the large part discuss
 major production measures before
 the measures are put into effect.
 The rectification campaign
 within the Chinese Communist
 party is similar to its prede-
 cessor of 1942-44, which was
 designed to improve the indoc-
 trination of party members and
 train them to apply Bolshevism
 to Chinese conditions.   Thus
 far there has been no confirma-
 tion of rumors of a Stalinist-
 type purge and killing of "old
 comrades."  Only a handful of
 "rightists" have been exposed
 in the party, and none of these
 is believed to have been punished
 severely.  The number of Commu-
 nist  party                                                            members  expelled
 since October 1955 as "counter-
 revolutionaries"--well before
 the start of the rectification
 drive--came to less than one
 percent of total party member-
 ship, according to the minister
 of public security.
 Rectification in the Minis-
 try of-Public Security points
 up the relatively moderate na-
 ture of the campaign.   Police
 boss  Lo  Jui-ching recently
 stated that "only a part" of
 the people's police is "liked
 by the masses," primarily be-
 cause the police "speak rudely
 to the masses and do not treat
 them as equals."  Lo stated
 that, during the rectification
 drive, inhabitants of such
 cities as Peiping and Shanghai
 have been criticizing the police
 by using posters; he claimed
 that "public criticism of the
 police is permitted nowhere else
 in the world."  In exhorting
 public security personnel to
 improve, he warned that whether
 the populace "dares to criticize
 us or not" constitutes an im-
 portant criterion for judging
 whether police-populace rela-
 tions are "normal."  However,
 the people, too, have been
 "bound to good behavior"  by
 publicly signing pacts under
 which individuals are to educate
 themselves in "socialism" and
 become, in effect, part of the
 docile labor force of "red" ex-
 perts and workers now being
 created.

 In support of this year's
 all-out drive for rapid econom-
 ic development, Peiping has as-
 signed more troops to civilian
 tasks, evidently hoping that
 military personnel, with their
 disciplined labor force and rel-
 atively,. high technical skill,
 will set a beneficial example
 to workers and peasants and re-
 furbish the image of the armed
 forces as a friend of the masses.
 This campaign will probably not
 be allowed,  however,  to inter-
 fere significantly with the
 training and efficiency of com-
 bat units.
 Members of the armed forces,
 from "generals to privates,"
 have been ordered to contribute
 this year some 30,000,000 man-
 days to agricultural work, a
 50-percent increase over last
 year.   By the end of April, how-
 ever,                  the armed forces had al-
 ready contributed 15,000,000
 man-days to water conservancy
 work alone, and the year's tar-
 get seems almost certain to be
 overfulfilled.
 The army's railway  con-
 struction corps recently doubled
 its target for railroad build-
 ing in the Second Five-Year
 Plan (1956-1962), to a total
 of over 6,000 miles of new line.
 In the Sinkiang autonomous re-
 gion,  where the army has been
 particularly active in the past,
 army units plan to reclaim more
 than 600,000 acres of farm land
 this year alone, as compared
 with a total of only 500,000
 acres reclaimed in the past sev-
 en years by army labor.   These
 units will also play a key role
 in the regime's plan to turn
 Sinkiang  into  one  of the'
 nation's  top  cotton-produc-
 ing areas.
 Since late last year, mili-
 tary factories have been di-
 verting part of their produc-
 tive capacity to the manufacture
 of civilian goods.   Thus, an air-
 craft plant which formerly pro-
 duced  for  the                                                               military  is
 now making light transports for
 China's civilian air line,  and
 a  naval  ship  repair  facility
 in Fukien is making steel   for
 civilian consumption. Numerous
 articles  have  appeared  in
 the  mainland  press  detailing
 how  machine  shops  and re-
 pair  facilities                                                             of the armed
 forces are producing small
 tractors, irrigation pumps, and
 other types of equipment for
 China's farms.  Military units
 have been   reported  helping
 civilian authorities  build
 the  local industrial  instal-
 lations which are a featured
 part of Peiping's new program
 for socialist construction.
 At least one military
 unit, which has retained  its
 organizational integrity after
 discharge from the armed forces,
 has been active as a construc-
 tion company at the No. 1 Auto
 Works in Changchun and later at
 Fularki.   The majority of this
 year's discharged servicemen,
 including officers, have "vol-
 unteered" for work on state
 farms in northern Manchuria.
 Others have been assigned to
 work on farms and mines in
 northwestern China.   This di-
 version of the military to sup-
 port the civilian economy il-
 lustrates the importance the
 leadership in Peiping attaches
 to achieving a measurable de-
 gree of success in the present
 drive  for   economic   develop-
 ment.                   Prepared         25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 PEIPING CONTINUES HARD LINE TOWARD JAPAN
 Peiping is giving no sign
 of letting up its pressure  on
 the Kishi government in Japan.
 Economic and cultural exchanges
 broken off by Peiping in early
 May remain in abeyance, and Com-
 munist spokesmen have recently
 called for further sanctions
 to be taken against the Japa-
 nese.
 The Chinese still insist
 that the Kishi government must
 take the first step if relations
 are to improve.   It now appears
 that Peiping's minimum  price
 for a resumption of trade is
 Kishi's approval of all provi-
 sions of the fourth  private
 trade agreement.  The terms of
 this agreement, which permits
 the exchange of trade missions
 with quasi-diplomatic rights
 and the right to fly the nation-
 al flag, very nearly caused a
 rupture in Japanese - Chinese
 Nationalist relations  last
 spring before it was rejected
 by the Japanese.
 For a normalization of all
 relations, however, Peiping says
 it will require full diplomatic
 recognition from Kishi, or, at
 a minimum, a break in ties be-
 tween Tokyo and Taipei.
 The latest tactic that Pei-
 ping is using to increase the
 pressure of Japanese business
 interests on Kishi for a resump-
 tion of trade is the threat of
 a boycott by Overseas Chinese
 of Japanese goods in areas of
 Southeast Asia.  At a  recent
 meeting in Peiping of an organi-
 zation of Overseas Chinese who
 have returned to China, two Com-
 munist spokesmen called on the
 "broad masses of patriotic Over-
 seas Chinese" to boycott Japa-
 nese goods and thus iaqsist the
 "motherland" in the  struggle
 against Japanese "economic ex-
 pansion."
 It is doubtful that Pei-
 ping could carry off a boycott

 throughout all of Southeast Asia,
 but Japanese goods have been
 losing their pre-eminent posi-
 tion in markets there for some
 time--in large part because com-
 petitive Chinese goods are con-
 sistently underpriced.  The mere
 threat of a boycott, however,
 has heightened concern in Japan,
 particularly among textile in-
 terests,   that  it might  lose
 Southeast Asian markets to Com-
 munist China.

 PEIPING'S ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA              k
 24 July 1958
 Communist China, already
 well established in consumer
 goods markets in South and South-
 east Asia, is selling increasing
 amounts of machinery and indus-
 trial raw materials there as
 well.   Peiping's  exports, al-:
 though relatively small in the
 area, will probably expand rap-
 idly since they are tied in with
 the Chinese aid program and at-
 tractive terms are being offered
 Under Peiping's recent
 loans and grants worth about
 $60,000,000 in Southeast Asia,
 Chinese consumer goods are being
 sold in local markets to finance
 the construction of light indus-
 trial plants.   Indonesia is re-
 ceiving a textile factory, and
 Burma is importing Chinese ma-
 chinery for soap and textile
 plants.   Under its grant to Cam-
 bodia, China is to construct
 sion from that country is in-
 vestigating the possibilities
 for this venture.   Exports of
 machinery and consumer manufac-
 tures as a form of assistance
 have increased the willingness
 of underdeveloped areas to ac-
 cept Chinese aid programs, and
 have established a foundation
 for Peiping's expansion of po-
 litical relations as well.
 China is emphasizing ex-
 ports to Southeast Asia, to off-
 set its growing trade deficit
 in Western Europe.   China also
 is able to purchase raw materials
 from Southeast Asia for its own
 use or for re-export to the So-
 viet bloc.   The growth of Commu-
 nist China's sales in the area
 has been conspicuous since 1955,
 and total exports to Southeast
 Asian countries amounted to
 $95,000,000 in 1957, double those
 of 1955.

 CAMBODIAN RECOGNITION OF COMMUNIST CHINA
 The Sihanouk government's
 de jure recognition of Commu-
 nist China, to include an ex-
 change of ambassadors, follows
 several weeks  of  demagogic
 stage-setting by the premier.
 Sihanouk has been alluding to
 the need for a "new ally close
 at hand" to offset alleged West-
 ern bias against Cambodia in
 its increasingly bitter terri-
 torial and other disputes with
 South Vietnam.   Cambodia here-
 tofore has deliberately avoided
 any closer ties with Peiping
 than the economic and cultural
 relations entered into in 1956.
 Many influential Cambodians,
 apparently including King Sura-
 marit and Queen Kossamak, are
 deeply concerned over the im-
 plications of this step.   They
 fear this will aggravate the
 problem of Communist subversion
 and jeopardize the continuation
 of American aid.   Although Siha-
 nouk is still firmly in command,
 open defiance of his power may
 develop among conservative po-
 litical and military elements
 who are increasingly critical
 of his one-man rule.
 Strong reaction can be ex-
 pected from South Vietnam, where
 officials fear Sihanouk also in-
 tends to grant representation
 to Communist North Vietnam.
 Saigon is convinced that Siha-
 nouk--who is likened to a less
 intelligent Nasir--harbors gran-
 diose plans of restoring, with
 the support of Communist China,
 the  ancient Khmer  Empire at
 South Vietnam's expense.   Presi-
 dent Diem has regarded Sihanouk's
 past accommodation of the Sino-
 Soviet bloc a serious menace to
 Vietnam's security.   He has dwelt
 recently on growing internal op-
 position to Sihanouk and can be
 expected to support, if not ac-
 tually promote, a scheme to re-
 move him from power.
 Cambodia's recognition of
 Communist China constitutes a
 significant political victory
 for Peiping and will enhance its
 prestige throughout Southeast
 Asia,  particularly among the in-
 fluential Overseas Chinese com-
 munities.  Taipei's already
 shaky influence  among  Cam-
 bodia's 250,000 Chinese will
 be virtually eliminated, and
 chances for accrediting the un-
 official Chinese Nationalist
 consul now in Phnon Penh appear
 nil.                                       25X1

 Army Chief of Staff Nasu=
 tion has-ordered lav:.,enforcement
 agencies to take steps to pre-
 vent strikes and sabotage or any
 other threats to public order.
 This is an apparent reference
 to the recent threat of SARBIJPRI,
 the Communist-dominated agricul-
 tural workers' union, to take
 action against American rubber
 interests in Sumatra unless US
 troops are withdrawn from Leb-
 anon.  At least two other Com-
 munist-led labor unions and one
 Communist-manipulated organiza-
 tion  have, threatened ':action
 against American economic inter-
 ests.
 The army's ability to pre-
 vent extensive damage should the
 Communists choose  to  follow
 through on their threat is high-
 ly questionable in view of the
 troops' present difficulties in
 maintaining order in the dissi-
 dent Sumatran areas.  A concert-
 ed sabotage campaign in Sumatra
 would also affect American oil
 installations,   where  another
 Communist-dominated  union,
 PERBUM, is strong.

 occupied Tondano,   a city near
 Menado in the North Celebes, on
 17 July, thereby further reduc-

 Indonesian Government lead-
 ers believe the dissidents in
 Sumatra plan to transfer their
 headquarters from Central  to
 North Sumatra, specifically to
 Tapanuli, an area where the dis-
 sidents have been most effective.
 The army appears to
 have abandoned plans for post-
 poning  the 1959 national elec-
 tions, probably as a result of
 nonsupport from President Sukarno.
 According to Deputy Chief of Staff
 Djatikusumo, military leaders are
 considering strengthening IPKI--

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 June 1958
 HONG KONG - CHINESE COMMUNIST RELATIONS
 Hong Kong - Chinese Commu-
 nist relations, already strained
 by British efforts to curb Com-
 munist subversion in the local
 schools, may be further exacer-
 bated by Peiping's order for
 "peaceful" demonstrations in
 the colony to protest Anglo-
 American intervention in the
 Middle East.   The Hong Kong
 authorities also believe Pei
 ping may take economic reprisals
 against the colony, which re-
 ceives about 80 percent of its
 foodstuffs from the mainland.
 While the local security forces
 are believed capable of control-
 ling any civil disorder short
 of an all-out Communist attempt
 to take over the colony, Hong
 Kong's dense and volatile popu-
 lation poses a latent threat of
 mass violence that might  be
 Ignited by;-any civil crisis.
 Both Hong Kong and London
 have been concerned for some
 time over Peiping's reaction to
 the colonial government's re=
 fusal to permit Communist-con-
 trolled local schools to fly
 the Chinese Communist flag.
 The ban is aimed at combating
 Communist subversive activities
 in the schools, although local
 British courts may not uphold
 the government's action.   Commu-
 nist propaganda has strongly
 condemned the ban, and Peiping
 on 10 June officially protested
 this "unfriendly act."
 One London official has
 termed Peiping's attitude in-
 creasingly "nagging and trucu-
 lent."  Despite this, however,
 London has authorized the Hong
 Kong authorities to take action
 against the principal of the
 colony's largest Communist-
 dominated school for his con-
 tinued violation of the prohi-
 bition of political activity in
 the schools.   London's reply to
 Peiping's protest of 10 June
 will declare that the flag ban
 was ordered to prevent possible
 civil violence which could arise
 if the Communist-controlled
 schools continued to fly Pei
 ping's flag.  Most of Hong Kong's
 population, which is 98-percent
 Chinese, is believed opposed to
 the Peiping regime.
 The Hong Kong police re-
 cently withdrew permission for
 an international trade fair to
 be sponsored by local supporters
 of the Chinese Nationalists in
 mid-August.   The police explained
 that the fair also would con-
 stitute a threat to public safety.
 The government's action in this
 instance, however, appeared
 primarily intended to demon-
 strate its impartiality.
 Peiping's local machina-
 tions in response to the Middle
 East crisis appear to have in-
 creased the possibility of civil
 disorder in Hong Kong.   However,
 the capabilities of the Hong
 Kong security forces have im-
 proved since the riots of 1956,
 and the British continue to
 assert their right to control
 Hong Kong affairs without out-
 side interference.
 PRO-COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP OF JAPANESE TEACHERS' UNION CHALLENGED

 established system for evaluat-
 ing teachers.   If the moderate
 wing wins out in the convention
 scheduled for 27 July, it prob-
 ably             would try to make some
 compromise with the government
 on the teacher rating system,
 which appears certain to become
 effective throughout most of
 Japan in September.
 Prime Minister Kishi, to-
 gether with conservative leaders
 in business and education, re-
 gards the teachers' union as the
 greatest threat to Japan's demo-
 cratic institutions.   The gov-
 ernment is attempting to re-
 strict Nikkyoso's influence by
 reimposing some degree of cen-
 tral government control of edu-
 cation--as well as by direct
 measures to restrain the union's
 political activities.
 Since 1956 local school
 boards have been appointed by
 governors and mayors instead of
 elected despite the opposition
 of scholars, educators, and the
 press, who charge a revival of
 state control of education.
 The government has devised
 a standardized rating system for
 teachers throughout the public
 school system.   The system, which
 has been implemented in two of
 Japan's 46 prefectures and is
 expected to become effective in
 most others in September 1958,
 offers incentives to outstand-
 ing teachers and is designed to
 improve personnel methods and
 raise the level of instruction.
 A recently passed government
 bill gives school principals a
 special allowance and is designed
 to induce them to leave Nikkyoso.
 Prime Minister Kishi also has
 intimated that, if necessary,
 he would resort to legislation
 excluding principals from mem-
 bership in the union,  and the
 government is considering stand-
 ardizing textbooks throughout
 the country.   Texts are now
 selected by individual teachers.
 The teachers' union is the
 country's largest labor organ-
 ization, comprising.about 85
 percent of Japan's 645,000 pri-
 mary and junior high school
 teachers.   Teachers in senior
 high schools.have a separate
 union.   Japanese -'schoolteachers
 are traditionally conservative,
 but since World War II have been
 dominated by Communists holding
 powerful policy-making positions
 in the union.   Nikkyoso exercises
 political power through its
 position as the largest union
 in the General Council of Trade
 Unions  (Sohyo),  and through its
 control of 24 Socialist members
 of the Diet.
 During Nikkyoso's annual
 convention in early June, con-
 troversy over policy toward the
 government's system of rating
 teachers and factional rivalry
 over the election of the secre-
 tary general revealed a split
 in the union between moderate
 and leftist factions.   Secre-
 tary General Miyoshi Hiragaki,
 representing the pro-Communist
 elements, walked out of the
 convention when Vice Chairman
 Sadamitsu Miyanohara, leader
 of the moderate faction, won
 the election, apparently by one
 vote.   The convention adjourned
 without validating the election
 requirthg a new convention to
 settle the dispute.
 The union charges the gov-
 ernment with attempting to con-
 trol individual teachers by
 arbitrary discharges, penalties,
 and a return to prewar  institu-
 tions.   The government appears
 determined,  however,  to continue
 its attack against Communist
 influence in the teachers' union
 and to discourage teachers from
 using their classroom positions
 for political activities.   The
 government program has  not
 aroused popular :opposition, and 25X1
 Japan's teachers probably will
 gradually become more responsive
 to central direction.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 NEPAL'S DETERIORATING FINANCIAL POSITION
 Nepal's efforts to develop
 its primitive economy are im-
 peded by the country's limited
 financial resources.  The budget
 for fiscal 1959, which began on
 15 July 1958, indicates that the
 government will exhaust its funds
 by the end of 1958 unless  it
 cuts economic development activi-
 ties or resorts to printing pa-
 per currency.   Since either move
 would cause political problems
 for the government in view of
 the elections scheduled for Feb-
 ruary 1959, Katmandu is more
 likely to attempt to secure addi-
 tional foreign aid.
 Expenditures budgeted for
 the present fiscal year total
 $14,950,000.   Normal government
 expenses account for $11,836,000
 of this sum, and the remaining
 $3,114,000 is to be used for
 economic development, chiefly
 in conjunction with foreign-
 aided projects.  Total antici-
 pated revenues are only $10,310,-
 000, leaving a deficit of $4,-
 640,000.   Katmandu can use $2,-
 330,000 in unutilized Chinese,
 Communist.aid which.was given in
 the form of cash, as well as the
 remaining $820,000 the govern-
 ment has in the Nepal State Bank,,
 thus reducing the deficit to
 $1,490,000.
 While Nepal could increase
 taxes enough to eliminate even
 this shortfall, no political
 leader in the present interim
 government is likely to support
 such a move or to take responsi-
 bility for butting economic de-
 velopment expenditures before
 the elections.  The government,
 therefore, probably will attempt
 to secure additional foreign aid
 to enable it to carry out pres-
 ent development plans.
 The Soviet-Nepalese com-
 muniqud issued at the end of
 King Mahendra's recent visit to
 the USSR stated that Moscow
 agreed to extend economic assist-
 ance to Nepal and that discus-
 sions on the scope of such aid
 would be undertaken after the
 King returned to Katmandu. While
 the Nepalese Government prob-
 ably is willing to receive some
 Soviet aid, it is reluctant to
 accept Soviet technicians and
 may attempt to use the talks
 with the USSR to stimulate India
 and the United States to expand
 their existing aid programs.
 India is already supplying $20,-
 000,000 in  assistance to Ne-
 pal's Five-Year Plan.

 MILITARY DISAFFECTION IN CEYLON
 The reported deterioration
 of morale within Ceylon's mili-
 tary and police forces, which
 suppressed widespread communal
 violence in late May and early
 June, creates doubt concerning
 their ability or desire to main-
 tain internal security in the
 event of further disturbances.
 Their lowered morale  stems
 chiefly from apparent disagree-
 ments between Prime Minister
 Bandaranaike and Governor Gen-
 eral Goonetilleke over the role
 of the armed forces and who is
 to control them under emergency
 rule.   Bandaranaike's interven-
 tion has hamstrung military ef-
 forts to execute orders from
 Goonetilleke, who took over
 primary responsibility for di-
 recting the armed forces when
 he assumed emergency powers on
 27 May.   Increased unrest in the
 services might eventually cause
 key military elements to become
 antagonistic toward the govern-
 ment.

 lice excesses in their efforts

 der of 5 July to arrest a high-

 Ceylon's eastern province dur-

 also stated that it is "high
 time" the governor general took
 action "to end this administra-

 nection  "a caretaker govern-

 The increase is Goonetilleke's
 personal power as a result of
 his firm use of emergency powers
 and the corresponding decrease
 in Bandaranaike's prestige may
 be responsible for at least two
 recent indications of friction
 between the two men.   At a meet-

 and Bandaranaike held with major
 newspaper editors to discuss ex-

 ranaike granted permission for
 free reporting on parliamentary

 apparently at Goonetilleke's re-

 authorizing arrests without war-

 on 5 July, was restored the next
 day, probably also at  the-:gov-

 economic program, however, and
 he is apprehensive over the re-
 percussions Middle East devel-
 opments may have on the Algerian
 situation.
 France's most immediate
 economic difficulties have been
 temporarily put off.   Finance
 Minister Pinay's gold-babked
 loan, which brought in approx-
 imately $785,000,000, including
 $169,000,000 in gold, has im-
 proved foreign exchange holdings
 to the extent that France may
 not have to resort to foreign
 assistance before the end of
 the year.   De Gaulle's promise
 to review the wage situation in
 the nationalized industries be-
 fore the end of the year if eco-
 nomic circumstances warrant will
 not satisfy labor, however, and
 Christian and Socialist union
 leaders appear seriously  con.
 cerned over worker reaction.
 Nevertheless, a Communist union
 official has expressed doubt
 that a strike would be called
 in the immediate future.
 On the international eco-
 nomic front, the premier has in-
 structed the cabinet to find
 some means of reaching agreement
 on the proposed free trade area
 in the interest of maintaining
 unity within the Western world.
 Farm and business groups, how-
 ever, which had been reluctant
 even to enter the Common Market
 despite '-its- concessions'  to
 France, will oppose a too lib-
 eral  interpretation of this
 order.
 The cabinet is completing
 its review of an initial draft
 of constitutional revisions which
 will be submitted to an advisory
 committee of legislators  and
 jurists by the end of July.  It
 has been announced that the over-
 seas territories will be asked
 after the referendum to decide
 whether they prefer (1) contin-
 uation of their present status,
 (2) full integration with France
 as departments,  or  (3) "associa-
 tion" in a framework of federated
 territories.
 Algerian settler extrem-
 ists, who reject any form of
 federal relationship and demand
 complete integration of Algeria
 into France, can be expected to
 react sharply to this proposal
 in view of De Gaulle's earlier
 statement that Algeria would
 have a "choice place" in a fu-
 ture federal association of
 France and its overseas posses-
 sions.   Their reaction will prob-
 ably be intensified by a debate
 just published in Paris in which
 the prointegration side admitted
 a federal relationship was the
 only practicable way of associat-
 ing Algeria with France.   De
 Gaulle now seems fearful lest
 Middle East events precipitate
 developments in North Africa
 which would prevent the applica-
 tion of a moderate program.
 THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT
 The close margin of 295-
 287 by which the Italian Chamber

 BRAZIL RELATES DULLES'VISIT TO WESTERN SECURITY
 During Secretary Dulles'
 planned good-will visit to Bra-
 zil, scheduled for 3 to 5 Au-
 gust, President Kubitschek will
 probably emphasize not only
 Brazil's serious financial dif-
 ficulties but also the pressing
 need for "Operation Pan-Ameri-
 ca"--his term for a "comprehen-
 sive reappraisal" of inter-Amer-
 ican relations proposed in a
 letter to President Eisenhower
 in early June.   Kubitschek views
 underdevelopment as the weakest
 link in hemisphere security,
 and he has pointed to the urgent
 need to remedy the situation.
 While Kubitschek has left
 a specific blueprint for "Op-
 eration Pan-America" to a later
 inter-American meeting, he has
 described in recent speeches
 some  of the  Latin  American
 grievances  which  he  feels
 threaten  to  undermine the in-
 ter-American system.
 Brazil views itself as the
 United States' senior partner
 in Latin America, not only be-
 cause of its size and strategic
 location but also because of
 its close political and mili-
 tary  support  of. the ':United
 States.  Brazil believes this
 close cooperation increases its
 vulnerability in the East-West
 struggle and that it should have
 more of a voice in internation-
 al affairs--that the Latin
 Americans should no longer be
 "a simple choral group."
 Kubitschek told top govern-
 ment and military officials on
 18 July that it was of primary
 importance to "maintain inde-
 structible relations" with the
 US and, therefore, Brazil's duty
 to express unhesitatingly its
 sincere reactions. Kubitschek
 described his letter to Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, which he sent
 shortly after Vice President
 Nixon returned from South Ameri-
 ca, as a "warning cry against
 the cold war that is now begin-
 ning to exhibit its first symp-
 toms in our continent."  In
 addressing Latin American dip-
 lomats on 20 June, he urged
 that the sickness of underdevel-
 opment be combated with mod    '
 ernized international financial
 institutions, technical assist-
 ance, and measures to protect
 primary products from excessive
 fluctuation. His views have been
 heartily  endorsed  in '.Latin
 America.
 Increasing financial dif-
 ficulties in Brazil, linked to
 lower prices and reduced coffee
 exports, which supply 60 percent
 of Brazil's foreign exchange,
 have limited Brazil's economic
 development plans and caused
 rising discontent.  National-
 ists  friendly  to                                                             the  United
 States, as well as extremists,
 are  exerting  pressure  on  the
 government to seek quicker so-
 lutions to pressing economic
 problems.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 July 1958
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 MIDDLE EASTERN MEMBERS REAPPRAISE BAGHDAD PACT
 Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan
 are engaged in an intensive re-
 appraisal of regional security
 along the  "northern tier" in
 preparation for the  Baghdad
 Pact Ministerial Council meet-
 ing             in  London  on            28  July.
 Alarmed over the  effects of
 the Iraqi coup on collective
 defense arrangements and  on
 the stability  of  governments
 in the area,  Ankara, Tehran,
 and Karachi will strive  for
 greater regional integration,
 full US adherence to the pact,
 and increased military assist-
 ance.   They anticipate that the
 British role will be de-empha-
 sized in any event.
 Impact of the Iraqi Coup
 The sudden overthrow of
 King Faysal's regime was as much
 a   psychological  blow  to  the
 three other  Moslem  nations in
 the Baghdad Pact as  it was a
 loss in purely strategic terms.
 The shocked  reaction  of the
 Turkish, Iranian,   and Pakistani
 chiefs of  state was quickly
 translated  into concern over
 the future of the collective de-
 fense system and also over in-
 ternal repercussions in their
 own countries.   Demoralization
 among the pro-Western countries
 in the area was recognized as
 a real danger.
 News of the military coup
 in Iraq broke as  the leaders
 were gathering on 14 July in
 Turkey for a meeting  of the
 Moslem lembers of the  pact in
 advance of the Ministerial
 Council   meeting in London. The
 conference was hurriedly con-
 verted, in the absence of King
 Faysal, into a round of inten-
 sive consultations among the
 Shah of Iran, Turkish President
 Bayar, and Pakistani President
 Mirza on the fast-developing
 Middle Eastern crisis.
 The pact leaders adopted a
 more confident tone in statements
 following the Ankara talks, ob-
 serving that  recent events in
 the area stressed "more  than
 ever the need for  collective
 security and for an organization
 having a very practical nature."
 Officials made clear their deter-
 mination to increase the collabo-
 ration between Turkey, Iran, and
 Pakistan, and thus  strengthen
 the "Baghdad" Pact.  While pub-
 lic avowals of closer cooperation
 were designed primarily to demon-
 strate the solidarity of  the
 Moslem countries in the pact, it
 was evident that all three gov-
 ernments did in fact feel  the
 need to draw together as never
 before in the interest of self-
 preservation.
 Strategic Considerations
 The Moslem members had long
 regarded Iraq as the     weakest
 link in the alliance,   and had
 frequently considered the pos-
 sibility of its withdrawal. They
 did  not anticipate,   however,
 that  King  Faysal's government
 might be forcibly  overthrown
 and  Iraq transformed into what
 they view as a hostile base.
 Much of the alarm expressed
 in Ankara and Tehran reflected
 the greatly increased threat to
 each nation's frontier security
 posed by the new government in
 Iraq.   Most-of Iran's western
 borderland, as well as its vul-
 Ene" T northern border with the

 USSR, now is open to infiltra-
 tion by subversive elements.
 Moreover, Iran's access to the
 Western world will be curtailed
 by Iraqi control over the major
 highway between Tehran and
 Baghdad.   Turkey, which recent-
 ly displayed great apprehension
 over the danger of subversion
 from Syria, now is even more
 concerned at the extension of
 what it considers to be pro-
 Communist influence along the
 remainder of its southern flank.
 Officials in Ankara and Tehran
 probably see the developments

 members greater leverage in
 exerting pressure on Washington
 to  join  the  pact,   since:

 The denial of important
 bases and lines of  communica-
 tions located in Iraq would
 constitute a more considerable
 loss for the pact in strategic
 terms than the loss of Iraq's

 in Iraq as a further step in
 Moscow's "leapfrog"  strategy
 of penetrating the Middle East
 behind the free world's de-
 fense line.
 The new Iraqi Government
 has not yet indicated its final
 attitude toward association
 with the Baghdad Pact.   Its
 withdrawal or expulsion from
 the pact would remove the Arab
 element in the alliance.   While
 the influence of the pact
 throughout the Middle East would
 be considerably lessened as a
 result of its dissociation from
 the Arab world, it might produce
 an alignment with greater unity
 of outlook and purpose.   Histor-
 ical relations and continuing
 disputes between Turk and Arab,
 and between Persian and Arab,
 had tended to inhibit genuinely
 close cooperation among the
 Turkish,  Iranian, and Iraqi lead-
 ers.   Withdrawal by Iraq would,
 65,000 troops.   The
 take-over of Baghdad
 by potentially hos-
 tile forces, more-
 over,  involves far      25X1
 more than a blow to
 the pact's prestige,
 for in addition to
 lending its name to
 the pact, Baghdad
 housed the secretariat
 where classified files
 of the various po-
 litical, military, eco-
 nomic, and counter-
 subversion organiza-
 tions are stored. The
 reported seizure of
 these documents is likely to be
 fully exploited for propaganda
 and intelligence purposes.
 National Concerns
 Turkey will continue to be
 a vigorous supporter of regional
 security arrangements in the
 Middle East.    While Prime Min-
 ister Menderes and Foreign Min-
 ister Zorlu privately may feel
 less satisfied with the pact,
 largely because of its failure
 to provide the mechanism for
 Western-backed armed action
 against the Iraqi rebels, these
 leaders can be expected to work
 energetically;,, to increase the
 effectiveness of the pact agree-
 ments.
 Turkey's continued partici-
 pation in the pact is not like-
 ly to be affected by the dis-
 favor with which important seg-
 ments of the population view

 the whole approach toward rela-
 tions with the Arab world which
 the pact represents.  A number
 of influential Turks have shown
 considerable suspicion of Arab
 leaders in the pact, accusing
 them of trying to use Turkey
 and the pact apparatus to fur-
 ther their own national or
 personal interests.
 Iran is likely to relate
 its commitment to the pact in
 the future on the prospects for
 US adherence and additional
 American arms, and on the will-
 ingness of its allies to join
 in an effort to restore a pro-
 Western government in Iraq.
 Should these conditions remain
 unfulfilled, the Shah probably
 would strive for some alterna-
 tive to the pact as presently
 organized.
 In forthcoming pact con-
 ferences,  Tehran can be expected
 to express its urgent concern
 over Iran's increasingly ex-
 posed position between the USSR
 and Nasir's sphere.   Continuing
 Soviet maneuvers on the northern
 border are likely to intensify
 its apprehension over the time-
 liness and effectiveness of US
 support in the event of an ag-
 gressive move by Moscow against
 Iran.
 The Shah is particularly
 worried over possible domestic
 repercussions of the events in
 Iraq, and fears anti-Western
 nationalist elements will be
 encouraged to attempt similar
 action against his regime. Like
 the Turkish authorities, Tehran
 officials will be especially
 preoccupied with the effects of
 Cairo radio's propaganda on
 the Kurdish minority as well
 as on Arabs in southern Iran.
 Pakistan is interested in
 the Baghdad Pact primarily as
 a counterweight to the influence
 of India and other nonaligned
 countries.   Karachi will want
 to repair the damage to the
 pact's prestige by strengthen-
 ing its cooperation with the
 like-minded governments in Teh-
 ran and Ankara and adopting a
 more aggressive stand against
 the encroachments of Nasirism.
 Senior Pakistani army of-
 ficers have placed themselves
 strongly on record as favoring
 prompt military action to lib-
 erate Iraq.   President Mirza
 has been particularly outspoken
 in his advocacy of forthright
 steps to recover the situation

 unlikely to resort to action
 without consulting US officials.

 able success,  especially in East
 Pakistan, in stimulating popular
 protests against   the  govern-
 ment's pro-Western foreign pol-
 icy on the basis of recent Mid-
 dle Eastern developments.
 Future Alignment
 The Middle Eastern members
 of the pact will concentrate
 immediately on tightening the
 working relationship between
 Ankara, Tehran, and Karachi.. The
 increased danger to all of ex-
 panding nationalism on the one
 hand and Soviet threats on the
 other is likely to impel the
 three countries toward closer
 integration of their political,
 economic, and military ac-
 tivities.
 Uppermost in the minds of
 government leaders will be the
 objective of committing the
 United States to a more active
 association with the pact.
 Turkish, Iranian, and Pakistani
 officials will argue that the
 latest developments in the Mid-
 dle East demand a thorough re-
 thinking of regional security
 needs.   Requests for substantial
 increases in military force
 goals and for stepped-up eco-
 nomic assistance, calculated on
 the basis of new estimates of
 each country's security posi-
 tion, are likely to be forwarded
 to Washington within  the  near
 future.
 British association with
 the Baghdad Pact, on the other
 hand, may be de-emphasized as
 a result of the new situation,

 its special relationship with
 Iraq.  A growing sensitivity
 to identification with colonial
 powers has been evident in the
 pact capitals since the erup-
 tion of nationalism in Baghdad.
 The Moslem allies can be ex-
 pected to exert strenuous ef-
 forts to increase American in-
 fluence in the pact.
 As pact members reassess
 the security of the "northern
 tier," renewed interest in pro-
 posals for a regional federation
 of some kind is likely to be
 stimulated.   The Shah of Iran,
 concerned over the weakness of
 Iraq as an ally,  has for some
 months urged President Mirza to
 consider some form of federation
 between Iran and Pakistan. The
 Shah's interest in sharing Paki-
 stan's more advanced military
 force is certain to be enhanced
 by the presence of forces viewed
 as unfriendly on his western

 gree.
 The three Moslem nations
 also are likely to pay greater
 attention in the future to the
 position of Afghanistan. Tehran
 may attempt to iron out long-
 standing differences which have
 strained its relations with
 Kabul in the past.   Similarly,
 Karachi and Ankara can be ex-
 pected to renew efforts to es-
 tablish closer ties with Afghani-
 stan.   When Turkey's President
 Bayar visits Kabul in September,
 he may broaden his discussions
 of the status of the Turkish
 military mission there to in-
 clude proposals for Afghan as-
 sociation in a new regional
 grouping.   However, while the

 Congress in July last year.,.
 Vice Premier Li Fu-chun at the
 Eighth All-China Congress of
 Trade Unions in December said
 that China had to fulfill its
 scientific goals if.it is expected
 to carry through its over-all
 plans for future development.
 Government support of
 science in 1957 was marked by
 a budget increase of 25 percent
 over 1956, granted in the face
 of a general hold-the-line budg-
 et policy.   Estimates for 1958
 show a 30-percent increase over
 1957.   The percentage of the
 total budget is 1 percent and
 better, a fairly high figure
 considering the modest size of
 Communist China's research es-
 tablishment.
 China has undertaken to
 attain or approach in the next
 12 years world-power status in
 those scientific fields deter-
 mined to be most important in
 strengthening national power,
 including nuclear energy, elec-
 tronics, jet propulsion, mineral
 exploration, metallurgy, heavy
 chemicals, agricultural chemis-
 try, flood control, power de-
 velopment, and fundamental re-
 search.
 The amount of research
 done so far has been slight.
 The scientists have been busy
 organizing, planning, and train-
 ing, and research work has been
 devoted largely to low-level
 industrial testing,  trouble-
 shooting,  assimilating foreign
 technology, and overcoming in-
 dustry's inability to provide
 equipment and material needed
 in research and development.
 Scientists' time has also been
 absorbed by various political
 campaigns, such as land reform,
 the 3- and 5-anti programs, and
 the antirightist and rectifica-
 tion program now drawing to a
 close.   The effect on science
 of the present government's wide
 program to reduce overstaffing
 and improve contact with the
 people is not yet clear.   Its
 application to scientific es-
 tablishments has been mentioned,
 but with few details.
 China is beginning to pro-
 duce its own laboratory equip-
 ment and materials, including
 some for meteorological and geo-
 physical exploration.   Because
 of the minimal support.given
 science by industry in China,
 the scientists have taken on
 the job themselves.   Scientists
 have successfully engaged in re-
 fining germanium crystals for
 their budding transistor "in-
 dustry," actually still in the
 trial-production state in the
 laboratories.   Production of
 chemical reagents is moving
 along slowly, and the Communists
 report success in some metallur-
 gical projects and some advances
 in the technology of synthetic
 fuel production.
 Expansion in the organiza-
 tion of research probably now
 is tapering off.   The Academy
 of Sciences has 55 research in-
 stitutes and some 20 subordi-
 nate research bodies.   The gen-
 eral fields of medicine and
 agriculture are both organized
 under central academies under
 the Ministries of Public Health
 and Agriculture respectively.
 The various technical ministries
 have under their jurisdiction
 a total of about 100 research
 institutes, not including local
 industrial laboratories or pro-
 vincial agricultural experi-
 ment stations.
 Science is controlled at
 State Council level through the
 Scientific Planning Commission,
 set up in 1956 with 35 members

 of criticism of the party fol-
 lowing the invitation to "let
 all flowers bloom" and to help
 "rectify" the party.
 The Overseas Chinese scien-
 tists are viewed by the regime
 as a potentially rich source
 of new badly needed talent.   In
 the United States alone there
 are about as many Chinese na-
 tionals with doctor of philos-
 ophy degrees as there are in
 Communist China, and the regime
 has been trying to entice them
 to return to the mainland.
 Some 100 have returned since
 the Communist take-over.
 There has been little in-
 crease in the number of quali-
 fied researchers under the Com-
 munist regime.   Examination of
 candidates for the advanced-
 degree program of the Academy
 of Sciences revealed surpris-
 ingly poor preparation.  In
 technician and engineer train-
 ing, shortcomings have also
 been disclosed when graduates
 with very narrow fields of
 specialization could not be
 fitted into changing personnel
 requirements.   Policies are
 changing, with more emphasis
 on quality and fundamentals
 which are more broadly appli-
 cable.
 An intensified effort to
 train advanced scientists  in
 China got under way in the
 Academy of Sciences- in 1956,
 with some 200 scientists being
 named as graduate tutors.  In
 the fall of 1957 a similar pro-
 gram was started in the uni-
 versities with about 130 tutors.
 About one half of these 330
 have doctor of philosophy de-
 grees.   Each tutor apparently
 takes on one or two trainees
 each year for training up to
 four or five years.
 The training program in
 the Academy of Sciences calls
 for producing 10,500 scientists
 of the doctor of philosophy
 level by 1967,   a  goal  that
 could conceivably be met if the
 number of tutors is expanded
 and if training is the princi-
 pal activity of the few good
 scientists.   A hitch in the
 program may have already de-
 veloped inasmuch as no announce-
 ment of the enrollment of new
 graduate students in the acad-
 emy has been made for the 1957-
 58 academic year.   Instead,
 according to an announcement
 of 17 June, the academy is set-
 ting up a new "university of
 science and technology" to en-
 roll 950 undergraduate students
 this summer.  These students are
 to work in or in very close
 association with the academy's
 research institutes.  This plan
 may be the academy's answer to
 the problem of getting quali-
 fied men for its advanced pro-
 gram.
 The Academy of Sciences
 sent 129 men to the USSR in 1956
 for advanced study, and the Min-
 istry of Higher Education sent
 about 500 postgraduates, some
 of whom will be trained as re-
 searchers.   The number sent is
 limited by the shortage of quali-
 fied men and by the need  to
 keep the older men in China to
 carry on research and teaching.
 Returnees with "associated doc-
 torate" degrees numbered 62 in
 1956; two received doctorates
 in 1956.   An estimated one hun-
 dred such trainees will return
 each year during the early years
 of the 12-year plan, and the
 number will increase in the
 latter years.
 A Soviet adviser is regu-
 larly assigned to the Chinese
 Academy of Sciences and Soviet
 scientists have lectured in
 China, but on the whole the
 USSR has not shown an enthusi-
 astic interest in promoting re-
 search and development in Com-
 munist China.   Until this year
 there has been no known over-
 all research and development
 agreement with the Soviet Union.

 tific field  are  believed  to

 have been limited to statements
 of intention and ad hod rela-
 tions.   Sixteen Soviet scien-
 tists arrived in China in the
 spring of 1956 to help work out
 the 12-year plan, and in March
 1956 Communist China joined
 with the Soviet Union and the
 satellite countries in estab-
 lishing the Joint Nuclear Re-
 search Institute at Dubna near
 Moscow.  China, -which contributes
 20 percent of the operation
 costs of the institute, is per-
 mitted to use its research and
 training facilities.
 The Chinese probably in-
 stigated the three-month-long
 negotiations in Moscow which
 led to an agreement in January
 1958 providing Soviet assist-
 ance to China on its 12-year
 plan.  Details of the agree-
 ment are lacking, but apparent-
 ly an attempt was made to tie
 it down to specific goals of
 the 12-year plan.   The agree-
 ment probably also clarifies
 and extends arrangements for
 giving Chinese scientists ad-
 vanced training in the USSR.
 Another  agreement  was
 signed in December 1957 between
 the science academies of the
 two countries aimed at facili-
 tating cooperation.   This agree-
 ment appears to be a belated
 effort to implement the Chi-
 nese and Soviet resolutions
 agreed on when the Soviet acad-
 emy mission visited Communist
 China in June 1955.
 Relations with other bloc
 countries are nominal.  There
 has been some exchange of lec-
 turers,  and research students
 have received some advanced
 training in satellite countries.
 Peiping is on record that
 it will seek knowledge wherever
 possible  including  the  free
 world.   Mao Tse-tung is report-
 ed to have said to the Supreme
 State  conference: in February
 1957 that "it is even necessary
 to learn from the United States,
 especially  in  the  field  of
 science and technology."
 Communist China's scien-
 tists are beginning to make con-
 tact with free-world scientists
 --particularly Japanese--by at-
 tending scientific congresses.
 The Japanese Science Council
 and the Chinese Academy of
 Sciences exchanged delegations
 in 1955 and a group of Japanese
 physicists spent a month in
 China in the spring of 1957.
 There is some indication that
 Peiping would like to have Jap-
 anese scientists come to China
 for extended periods for re-
 search and teaching.
 The Chinese Communists
 withdrew officially from the
 International Geophysical Year
 because that body recognized Na-
 tionalist China as an official
 participant.   They continued
 in an observer capacity, however.
 Nuclear Energy Developments
 With a very limited number
 of  nuclear  physicists,   few
 training facilities, and limited
 industrial capacity for the pro-
 duction of nuclear facilities,
 Communist China is heavily de-
 pendent on the USSR for its
 progress in the field of nuclear
 energy.
 As a country in a position
 to contribute uranium resources
 to the Soviet nuclear energy pro-
 gram, Communist China was desig-
 nated in 1955 as one of the bloc
 countries that would receive
 Soviet aid in nuclear research.
 On 1 July, China announced that
 the 6.5-10 megawatt thermal re-
 search reactor and 25,000,000-
 electron-volt cyclotron built
 with Soviet assistance began
 operating on 13 June.   These
 facilities, largest in the bloc
 outside the USSR, are believed
 to be located in Peiping.
 Some alleged details of
 the agreement connected with nu-
 clear energy development have

 Six months after the ouster
 of dictator Perez Jimenez, Ven-
 ezuela's caretaker junta is
 still attempting to balance
 antagonistic military and civil-
 ian elements, and faces serious
 difficulties in carrying out
 its plan for a peaceful trans-
 fer of power to a coalition
 government expected to be elected
 on 30 November.  The conditions
 essential to a peaceful transi-
 tion--survival of the junta and
 election arrangements acceptable
 not only to the disparate par-
 ties but also to the tradition-
 ally dominant military--may be
 difficult to meet.
 Governing Junta
 The governing junta, with
 three military and two civil-
 ian members, appears to have
 the backing of civilian groups,
 the press, and public opinion
 generally, and to retain the
 majority, but diminishing, sup-
 port of the military.   Junta
 President Larrazabal, key per-
 sonality in the government at
 present, is a high-ranking naval
 officer whose brother is com-
 mander of the navy--an associa-
 tion which has seemed to carry
 a special guarantee of naval
 support for the regime.
 Although theoretically
 apolitical, the junta is in a
 position to influence the out-
 come of the elections for a con-
 stitutional government.   Through
 the policies it adopts and the
 use of its appointive powers,
 it is able to promote the in-
 terests of one or more of the
 political parties.   Larrazabal
 himself has been considered a
 coalition presidential candidate.
 The Military
 The traditionally dominant
 military has the power to take
 over the present government or pre-
 vent an elected government from as-
 suming office. Factors promoting
 such a move include the military's
 strong hostility to Venezuela's
 largest party, the leftist but non-
 Communist Democratic Action (AD),
 and concern over the growing in-
 fluence of the Communist party.
 Serious checks on the free-
 dom of the military to intervene,
 however,  include the continuing
 reorganization of the armed
 forces following the ouster of
 senior officers who served under
 the former dictatorship; the
 minority of the military which
 might oppose a coup at the pres-
 ent time; and the pronounced
 public opposition to a return
 of strong military rule.   Civil-
 ian groups also might unite to
 oppose a coup, with resultant
 widespread violence.   Moreover,

 luctant to act without some

 advance indications that US rec-
 ognition of a new military-
 sponsored regime would be forth-
 coming at an early date.
 Political Parties
 Four of Venezuela's five
 major political parties have
 reorganized rapidly since the
 fall of the dictatorship, and
 one new party has been founded.
 The voting strength of these
 groups-can only be estimated
 because of the lapse of time
 since the last free nationAl
 elections were held.
 AD, although probably the
 majority party, is limited by
 the attitude of the military,
 who tend to consider
 it Communist.   Its
 leader, Romulo Betan-
 court, is virtually
 eliminated from the.
 presidential race as
 a consequence.   AD,
 however, apparently
 has substantial in-
 fluence in the pres-
 ent government and
 the support of the
 great majority of or-
 ganized labor.
 The Venezuelan
 have the advantage of being na-
 tional parties somewhat more ac-
 ceptable to the military than
 either AD or PCV.   COPEI also
 has the endorsement of the
 Catholic Church.
 The influence of the moder-
 ate Republican Integration (IR)
 cannot be measured accurately,
 but it has been accorded favor-
 able treatment by the govern-
 ment, and its membership includes
 a number of respected individ..
 uals.   Unlike the other four
 parties, however, it has no known
 labor following or youth auxil-
 iary.                                                                 Other  minor  parties

 the great majority of labor is
 reportedly affiliated with AD.
 Under the present uncertain
 political conditions, the grow-
 ing number of unemployed--esti-
 mated at 70,000, primarily in
 Caracas--lend themselves to po-
 litical manipulation and could
 serve as a significant element
 of force for political parties.
 Avowedly apolitical, the
 Roman Catholic Church in Vene-
 zuela exercises some influence
 on government and politics, al-
 though less than in some other
 Latin American countries.   It
 is associated with the COPEI
 party and COPEI's labor affili-
 ate,  for which it acts as coun-
 selor.   The Catholic paper La
 Religion, which has an esti=
 mated c rculation of 28,000 and
 is the only periodical which is
 anti-Communist at present, prob-
 ably has some political influ-
 ence over moderate and conserva-
 tive readers.   Moreover, clerics
 are active on political bodies
 such as the Patriotic Front.
 The press has become in-
 creasingly influential under
 the present government, which
 seems highly sensitive to pub-
 lic opinion, with the number of
 papers and their circulation
 increasing since the ouster of
 dictator Perez.   The press,
 which tends to be antimilitary,
 is largely leftist-owned and
 -managed, and most of the staffs
 of the principal newspaper are
 penetrated by Communists or
 sympathizers.   Virtually  no
 anti-Communist material is
 printed in the non-Communist
 press, which also serves as an
 outlet for Communist Propaganda.
 Thus the press has considerably
 enhanced the position of the
 PCV as a power element.
 Student groups, which took
 the initiative in the overt ci-
 vilian phase of the movement
 which ousted Perez, have become
 one of the leading forces in
 Venezuelan politics.   The major
 political parties except IR also
 have youth auxiliaries.   The
 principal independent organiza-
 tions in the Caracas area are
 penetrated and, in large meas-
 ure, dominated by Communists.
 Politically oriented, the stu-
 dents are readily manipulated
 by political agitators.   Since
 the public in Venezuela is gen-
 erally hostile to forceful ac-
 tion against student demonstra-
 tions--a situation which often
 embarrasses an incumbent regime
 --students are a power in na-
 tional affairs beyond their
 strength in numbers.
 The principal business or-
 ganizations are in part designed
 to influence national economic
 policies to favor Venezuelan
 industry and commerce over for-
 eign competition,  but they are
 also a potential stabilizing
 force.   The financial resources
 of the members, the majority
 of whom tend to be conservative,
 could be applied to influence
 the military or the political
 parties.
 Outlook
 Much of the present uncer-
 tainty derives from the fluid
 relationships among Venezuela's
 power elements.   The junta has
 alienated some military support
 recently by complacency toward
 the growing Communist influence
 and by its quick response to
 civilian pressures.   The prin-
 cipal check on a military coup
 apparently is the likelihood of
 widespread civilian violence
 against such a move, as was dem-
 onstrated on 22-23 July when
 Defense Minister Castro Leon
 was forced to resign.
 The strength of parties
 vis-a-vis the military depends
 in large degree on the mainte-
 nance of their proclaimed truce
 and unity program.   All major
 groupings are members of the
 Patriotic Front, which played a
 key role in the ouster of Perez
 and whose present objectives
 are to ensure an elected con-
 stitutional government and to
