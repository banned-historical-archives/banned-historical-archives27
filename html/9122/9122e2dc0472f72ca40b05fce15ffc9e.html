 Chinese officials in Peking are attempting to put the best face on an obviously
 confused and heated leadership situation. For the first time since Teng Hsiao-ping
 came under attack, a party official in Peking has said Teng retains his job as party
 vice chairman and that he was not named premier because his party duties are so
 heavy.
 Other Peking officials have already confirmed that Teng retains his government
 and military positions. Although these statements may be an attempt to quash
 speculation outside of China about Teng's status, it seems likely that the leadership
 has not yet made any firm decisions and that Teng does indeed retain all his
 posts-at least for now.
 The current status of Defense Minister Yeh Chien-ying, who, like Teng, was
 closely associated with Chou En-lai, is not clear. Peking reportedly issued a directive
 in early February announcing the replacement of Yeh on an interim basis because of
 his poor health. Neither the Chinese Foreign Ministry nor the Defense Ministry
 would confirm this story, however, and the Defense Ministry has said Yeh remains in
 his job. That Chinese officials have denied the story, despite the issuance of the
 directive, suggests the subject is very sensitive.
 Rumors are circulating in China and in Hong Kong that Yeh actually resigned
 his post in protest over the treatment of Teng Hsiao-ping. Yeh's resignation on these
 grounds is not inconceivable because he threatened to resign during the Cultural
 Revolution over decisions he opposed. In any event, some Chinese officials
 obviously do not believe the official story that Yeh's health took a turn for the
 worse shortly after Chou En-lai's funeral.

 There are some tenuous signs in the propaganda that acting Premier Hua
 Kuo-feng may himself be under attack, presumably from the party's left wing. Hua
 seems to have some responsibility for science, and a propaganda debate over how to
 conduct scientific work may be aimed at him. An article in People's Daily attackinn
 'he Soviet security minister may also have been intended as an indirect attack on
 Hua, who is China's security minister. People's Daily has also attacked those who
 out three instructions from Mao on an equal footing, claiming that one is more
 important than the other two. In his speech last fall at an agricultural conference,
 l iua seemed to put equal emphasis on all three and could be a target.I

 Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam left Beirut yesterday after conducting the
 first round of bargaining among Lebanese Muslims and Christians to form a new
 cabinet. Creation of a coalition government that would include representatives of
 the Christian Phalanges Party and the large left-wing groups is a necessary first step
 toward implementing the reform program announced by President Franjiyah last
 weekend.
 Khaddam, according to press accounts, is hoping to persuade Phalanges chief
 Pierre Jumayyil and Kamal Jumblatt, the principal spokesman for the left, to accept
 positions as senior ministers along with several other Muslim and Christian notables.
 A large cabinet made up of technicians would serve under them to deal with the
 problems of reconstruction. Muslims and Christians reportedly would have equal
 representation in the cabinet.
 Jumblatt announced yesterday that his party would refuse to join a new
 government unless major adjustments favoring the Muslims were made in the reform
 program. He reportedly is also lobbying for the revival of the National Dialogue
 Committee, created during the early stages of the fighting last year. Leftists were
 over-represented in this extra-governmental body and prevented it from becoming an
 effective force for reconciliation.
 Before leaving Beirut, Khaddam told reporters he hoped a new cabinet could be
 announced before the end of the month. Khaddam will probably seek permission
 from Damascus to put new pressure on Jumblatt. The Syrians have less leverage to
 use on Jumayyil, who also appears reluctant to be represented in the cabinet.
 Feuding between Jumblatt and Jumayyil was a major cause of the rise in tensions
 last year  and  could  have  a  similar impact on the oresent situation.

 The final troop withdrawal and transfer of territory under the second Sinai
 disengagement agreement is scheduled to take place this weekend. By noon today,
 Israeli troops will have evacuated the Mitla and Giddi passes, and withdrawn to
 defensive positions to the east. Egyptian soldiers are to complete occupation of the
 former UN buffer zone by noon tomorrow, when the agreement takes full effect.
 Implementation of the military protocol to the cease-fire has proceeded
 smoothly, despite a slight delay by the Israelis while awaiting US Congressional
 approval of the agreement. Subsequently all withdrawals and transfers have been on
 time and without incident. Minor problems arising over location and configuration
 of early warning stations have been resolved by the joint Egyptian- Israeli-UN
 commission.
 To the east, in Israeli-occupied Sinai, a new airfield is nearing completion at Al
 Arish and facilities at Gaen Nagb airfield are being expanded. In the meantime,
 operational use of Bir Jifjafah and Bir Hasanah (New) airfields near the present
 disengagement line has declined and improvements at these facilities have not been
 noted. According to the Israeli press, Prime Minister Rabin has stated that Israel may
 be willing to withdraw to a line running from Al Arish toR'as Muhammad in return
 for the end to the state of belligerency with Egypt.

 After almost nine years of halting development and slow progress toward a
 summit meeting, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will hold its
 first summit in Bali next week.
 The agreement of the five leaders from Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
 Philippines, and Thailand to meet together and to issue a common declaration is
 itself a major achievement, considering the conflicting national outlooks and the
 personal animosities that exist between some of them. The brief history of the
 Association has been marked by frequent indifference on the part of some members
 to the concerns of the others, and a common view of regional cooperation has been
 slow in developing. The need to hold six preparatory meetings testifies to the
 difficulty of achieving common policy views.
 Members of ASEAN have had different reactions to the fundamental political
 and social changes that have occurred in the region over the past few years. Well
 before the end of the Indochinese war, Malaysia took steps to open relations with
 China and called for the neutralization of Southeast Asia. Malaysia and Singapore
 opened relations with North Vietnam, and Thailand appeared to be moving toward a
 more evenly balanced foreign policy. With the fall of Vietnam, both Thailand and
 the Philippines accelerated their moves to open relations with China, and Thailand
 and Malaysia advocated the expansion of ASEAN to include Cambodia, Laos, and
 Vietnam.
 Indonesia and Singapore, on the other hand, have been apprehensive about
 further communist expansion in the region. Jakarta was unhappy with the decisions
 by Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines to establish diplomatic relations with
 China and has resisted any suggestions that ASEAN'S doors be opened to the
 Indochinese states. Instead, Jakarta, with little regard for Thai and Malaysian
 sensitivities, has been pressing proposals for mutual security understandings within
 the ASEAN framework that would inevitably carry anti-communist connotations.
 Singapore, with support from the Philippines, has been actively promoting
 increased economic ties among the ASEAN nations and has recently stepped up
 efforts to form an ASEAN free trade area. Indonesia, the most populous and
 economically backward of the ASEAN states, views Singapore's motives as
 self-serving and argues that a tariff-free arrangement would lead to Singaporean
 domination of area markets for a wide range of consumer products.
 The Philippines' promotion of a treaty of amity, which would establish
 machinery to mediate disputes between member states, is viewed by Malaysia's new
 Prime Minister Hussein Onn with extreme distrust as a device that could allow

 Manila to revive its claims to the East Malaysian state of Sabah. Hussein Onn views
 Phillipine President Marcos with extreme distaste as a grandstander capable of
 twisting anything Hussein says to imply Malaysian acknowledgment of Manila's
 claim to Sabah.
 With little more than a week to go, these issues were still unresolved, and
 representatives from the five ministries of foreign affairs met this week in a crash
 effort to paper over differences and secure the compromises needed to make
 possible a joint declaration.
 To ease Thai and Malaysian concern over the issue of ASEAN's proper role,
 Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik has publicly disavowed any intention to make
 ASEAN a military bloc and has affirmed that the present bilateral security
 arrangements between members are the most practical approach. Malaysia and
 Thailand, at least for the time being, appear to have dropped their proposal for
 Indochinese entry into ASEAN. The members apparently have decided against any
 public statements about the security implications of the communist take-over in
 Indochina at the summit in order not to provoke a communist reaction.
 Although Singapore and the Philippines are annoyed by what they regard as
 Indonesia's negative attitude toward a free trade area, they apparently will drop the
 proposal for now and will raise the concept only as a long-term goal. Some positive
 steps toward greater regional economic cooperation, however, are likely to be
 endorsed, including giving the member states priority access to food and energy
 supplies available in the region.
 With Indonesia taking the lead in working out the compromise, Malaysia
 appears resigned to the amity treaty but with the proviso that the mediation
 provision will require the unanimous consent of all five member states before it is
 employed. Philippine President Marcos may, however, refuse to accept such a
 proviso.
 Malaysia has for some years been interested in establishing a zone of neutrality
 in Southeast Asia, but it has received little encouragement from the other members
 and has not pressed this proposal in recent months. Earlier ASEAN foreign
 ministers' conferences have voiced support for neutrality as a desirable goal for the
 longer term, however, and the Bali summit will probably reaffirm this support.

 The US defense attache in Cairo reports that President Sadat informed the US
 ambassador on February 18 that Egypt has signed a contract with Rolls Royce to
 overhaul MIG-17 and MIG-21 aircraft engines. The work is to be conducted in
 Egypt, presumably at Egypt's Helwan aircraft plant located about 15 miles south of
 Cairo.
 The Egyptians have been working hard to improve their aircraft maintenance
 capability, particularly with respect to Soviet engines. Currently they are credited
 with the ability to overhaul the Soviet RD-11 engine which powers early model
 MIG-21s. The British would presumably perform overhaul on the later model
 MIG-21 Js equipped with the RD-13 engine. This model accounts for almost two
 thirds of Cairo's 210 MIG-21 inventory.
 Although Egypt has been rumored to be seeking help both for spare parts and
 in maintaining its Soviet aircraft for some time, Egypt's decision to have Rolls
 Royce assist in maintaining its MJG aircraft was undoubtedly prompted by
 Moscow's decision in January to cancel Egypt's MIG engine overhaul program in the
 Soviet Union.

 West German Chancellor Schmidt, in his talks earlier this month with Prime
 Minister Wilson and President Giscard, reviewed progress on matters related to West
 European cooperation, as well as certain bilateral issues.
 The talks between Schmidt and Wilson appear to have been particularly frank
 and fruitful, a sign that the two men have patched up their personal relationship that
 was damaged when Wilson demanded a separate seat for the UK at the Conference
 on International Economic Cooperation at Paris last December.
 The talks ranged from a discussion of the election of a European parliament to
 prospects for Greece becoming a full member of the EC as soon as possible.
 Subsequently, the EC Council endorsed the Greek membership bid.
 The key topic in London was the question of renewing the five-year bilateral
 military offset agreement that expires on March 31. Wilson presented his position
 forcefully, arguing that cuts in the British defense budget might have to be deeper if
 Bonn does not increase its offset payments above the present annual level of $40
 million. Despite his reservations on the subject, Schmidt agreed to begin negotiations
 before the current agreement expires.
 Schmidt's talks with Giscard devoted more attention to the larger European
 issues. The two probably discussed Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans' report on the
 future of Europe, released in early January, and the proposal to create a new and
 more restricted executive body for the EC-the so-called Directorate-that French
 journalists have attributed to the French President. Press commentary suggests that
 the Chancellor, who fears institutional distinctions between the economically strong
 and the weak within the Community will alienate the British, rejected the
 Directorate concept. The less-controversial Tindemans Report, however, received
 serious attention and will again when Schmidt and Giscard, along with Wilson, meet
 at the next European summit in Luxembourg on April 1-2.
 The problem of stabilizing exchange rates received the most publicity. Both
 leaders publicly stated after the conference that no change in the official value of
 either national currency was necessary and that the central banks were authorized to
 intervene in money markets to maintain parity rates within the limits established by
 the joint float of EC currencies. The financial markets calmed down this past week,
 perhaps in reaction to this official announcement.

 Disagreement over the scheduling of presidential and legislative elections in
 Portugal is still delaying completion of the pact between the political parties and the
 military on the country's future political structure. The Lisbon press is now
 speculating that the agreement probably will not be signed before early next week.
 The center-left Popular Democrats are holding out against the military's
 suggestion that presidential elections be held six months after legislative balloting
 because they want President Costa Gomes out of office as quickly as possible. The
 party prefers simultaneous elections, or at least only a slight delay between the two
 votes, with the president holding limited powers in the interim.
 e Council is scheduled to take up the pact again on
 Monday.
 The stalled negotiations have delayed completion of the new constitution,
 which must incorporate the pact's provisions. The Revolutionary Council has
 extended the mandate of the constituent assembly until the end of April. The delay
 also appears likely to push back by a few weeks the April 25 deadline for the
 legislative election previously set by the Council.
 The Revolutionary Council will also consider the implementation of autonomy
 measures for the Azores and the Madeira Islands at the Monday session. The
 Azorean regional council submitted its proposed autonomy statute to Prime Minister
 Azevedo last week and is hoping for quick approval by the Revolutionary Council.
 The decision to grant autonomy to the Azores has already improved relations
 between the islands and the mainland. The autonomy process has only just begun in
 the Madeiras, however, and resentment toward the Lisbon government remains.
 Shortly after the Prime Minister arrived in the Madeiras on Thursday to swear in a
 regional council to govern the archipelago, a bomb exploded on a major highway
 where his motorcade was expected to pass.
 The bombing may well have been the work of the right-wing Front for the
 Liberation of the Madeiran Archipelago, which demands total independence. The
 organization had exhorted Madeirans to boycott Azevedo's visit and threatened to
 organize separatist demonstrations.

 Azevedo plans to cut short his stay on Madeira to return to Lisbon for a special
 government meeting today on whether to recognize the Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola.
 President Kenyatta at public rallies has displayed extreme indignation over the
 claim, apparently contained in a message from Ugandan President Amin to the
 British High Commission in Kampala, that a portion of Kenya belongs to Uganda.
 Kenyatta is painfully aware of his country's inadequate military strength and
 will probably use the Amin claim as a pretext to renew his arms purchases request to
 the US and Britain. Kenyatta has beer dissatisfied with the results of earlier aid
 discussions but he may reason that Amin's latest outburst could induce Western aid
 donors to be concerned over the possibility of offensive action by the Soviet-armed
 Ugandan forces.
 Amin for his part may be concerned by the continuing severity of economic
 dislocations at home. He therefore may have revived the issue as a means of focusing
 a disgruntled public on an external situation.

 There is no sign of a slackening in the wave of strikes, civil disorders, and
 kidnapings that have plagued the government and caused President Lopez to
 postpone indefinitely plans for lifting the nine-month-old state of siege before the
 April mid-term elections.
 The disorders, springing from a variety of grievances, come at a particularly
 embarrassing time for Lopez as government leaders are preparing a warm welcome
 for Secretary Kissinger when he arrives in Bogota on Sunday. The government may
 also have to contend with demonstrations against the visit specifically targeted by
 leftist groups eager to cash in on the publicity.
 The disorders now affect vital sectors of the economy. Not only is the
 government plagued by student strikes and clashes with police but a work stoppage
 in Buenaventura, Colombia's leading Pacific port, has severely crippled commercial
 activity. Civil strikes in several cities protesting deficient public services and wildcat
 strikes by bank employees and Finance Ministry tax collectors serve only to confirm
 the general public impression that the government is not responding.
 Adding to the deteriorating situation is the kidnaping last weekend of the
 veteran head of the Colombian Workers Federation. His abductors are claiming that
 he will be "tried" for crimes against the working class. According to the US
 embassy, labor union officials and police fear that the official may now be dead. The
 Federation has threatened a massive strike by its members to protest the kidnaping,
 raising the threat of further disorders.
