 had disclosed to Lansdale the

 Lansdale arranged for Hinh's staff

 Until the fall of 1955, Diem was
 theoretically prime minister to the
 dissolute Emperor Bao Dai. But
 on October 6, Diem announced a
 referendum to choose between
 himself and Bao Dai as chief of
 state. Ever the psywar expert,
 Lansdale advised Diem to take out
 some "subliminal insurance" by
 having the ballots colored in ways
 that would influence the vote.
 Diem's ballots were printed in
 cheerful red, the color Asians in-
 tetpret to mean good luck, while
 Bao- Dai's ballots were a bilious
 shade of green, which signifies a
 cuckold to Vietnamese. The color
 insurance was reinforced by a
 substantial amount of military
 muscle, and Diem ended up with
 98 per cent of the votes. Lahs-
