 (U)   CHINA:   SOME IMPLICATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL REFORM
 Summary
 The Chinese Communist Party plenum in October
 1984 gave Deng Xiaoping a mandate to take wide-
 ranging action to revise China's planning, pricing,
 wage, and management systems.   By scrapping Stalin-
 ist methods, China's leaders are seeking to increase
 efficiency and productivity and to promote greater
 specialization and more rapid technological change--
 advances they identify as crucial to the attainment
 of ambitious goals for economic development.   Indus-
 trial reform could alter China's economic structure
 if the leadership perseveres.   The reform, however,
 does not entail the abandonment of socialism.
 Obtaining the mandate apparently required some
 compromise on the part of the reformers, led by Deng,
 on the scope of reform.   The state will remain in
 control of production and distribution of basic
 agricultural and industrial products.   Price reform,
 which is pivotal, is to proceed cautiously.   Ampli-
 fication of the reform proposals in coming months
 could be difficult if controversy resumes in the
 leadership over the advisability of relaxing state
 control over investment and prices and expanding the
 roles of enterprise managers and markets.   Further-
 more, lower level party officials are likely to
 resist efforts to reduce their influence over eco-
 nomic affairs.
 In the near term, the reformers appear to have
 sufficient political strength to keep the thrust of
 reform intact.   If they succeed in enacting bold
 reform measures, the quality and mix of industrial
 output should improve.   But the rate of industrial
 growth is likely to slow compared with increases
 achieved in recent years as enterprises adjust to
 higher production costs resulting from price reform.

 Over the longer term, the success of reform probably will rest
 more on how well the current leadership handles likely bouts with
 inflation and rising unemployment than on how completely the reform
 meets its stated objectives.   Inflation is the more dangerous chal-
 lenge because policies that would be required to restore price sta-
 bility also could undercut the reform.   Left unchecked, however,
 inflation would shatter the consensus on policy that Deng and his
 supporters have worked so hard to achieve and, in the process,
 could imperil their leadership.

 Conditions Ripe for Reform
 The immediate pressure for proceeding with industrial reform
 in China stems mainly from political factors, including Deng's age
 and the need to secure his policies and the succession.   By acting
 now, the leadership should be able to get reform regulations in
 place before China embarks on the 1986-90 five-year plan, and it
 could use the targets of the plan to increase the number and influ-
 ence of those having a stake in the continuance of current economic
 policies.   Deng already had achieved agreement on the need to rem-
 edy defects in Stalinist methods that retarded modernization of
 industry, misallocated investment, wasted labor and materials, and
 stifled individual incentive.
 Improved economic performance over the past few years, partic-
 ularly in 1984, may have provided the leadership a platform on
 which to promote the reform:
 --In agriculture, China harvested its fourth successive record
 grain crop in 1984.   Expected to exceed 400 million tons, grain
 production is large enough to reduce imports and permit some
 exports.   The cotton crop--estimated at 5.5 million tons--also
 is a new record.   Impressive results of agricultural reform
 (begun in 1979) buttress the case for industrial reform,
 even though the leadership cautions that improvements in indus-
 trial performance would be smaller and more difficult to
 achieve.
 --Industrial production posted double-digit growth in 1984 for
 the second consecutive year according to recent Chinese esti-
 mates.   Based on nine-month data,  the State Statistical Bureau
 projected a?12.5-percent increase in industrial output, com-
 pared with 10.5-percent growth in 1983.   Better balance in
 growth also was anticipated; output was expected to grow by
 11 percent in light industry and by 13 percent in heavy indus-
 try.   In 1983, production by light industry rose by 8.7 percent
 and heavy industry, by 12.4 percent.
 --During January-September 1984, the volume of foreign trade
 rose by more than 20 percent and China's trade surplus
 amounted to $350 million.   Foreign exchange reserves totaled
 about $17 billion at mid-year.   Large foreign exchange hold-
 ings (equivalent to 8 months of imports) and a high level of

 confidence among lenders regarding China's creditworthiness
 will cushion the impact of spending to retool China's
 factories.
 Economic Pressure for Reform
 Rapid growth has exacerbated a number of fundamental economic
 problems, making the need for reform more acute:
 --Increased agricultural production, especially of grain, has
 led to growing state purchases.   Greater sales of foodstuffs
 at prices below acquisition cost have driven up the cost of
 subsidies.  According to the Chinese economic research office
 and International Monetary Fund calculations, price subsidies
 rose from about 14 billion yuan in 1979 to 33 billion yuan in
 1982--accounting for more than 32 percent of gross state finan-
 cial expenditures that year.   Price subsidies have increased
 further, although more slowly, during the past two years.   The
 state also is incurring substantial increases in storage costs
 because of the greater-than-expected boom in agricultural out-
 put.  Rapidly rising income in rural areas has increased demand
 for agricultural investment goods and other farm inputs, con-
 struction materials, and consumer goods which the industrial
 sector is increasingly less able to satisfy.
 --The rise in industrial production has not been accompanied by
 sufficient increases in the marketability of goods produced.
 During January-September 1984, for example, the amount of funds
 locked up in unsalable inventories (at existing prices)
 increased faster than the growth in output of finished goods,
 according to the Ministry of Finance.   Moreover,-while some
 progress was made in cutting losses of unprofitable firms, the
 reduction was less than the planned amount.   Deficits in a few
 important industries, such as coal mining and timber, are
 increasing faster than output.
 --The State Economic Commission has reported that foreign trade
 losses during January-September 1984 were reduced, but no
 indication was given about the rate of reduction compared with
 this year's plan.   The mounting trade surplus, however,  is
 adding to the state's subsidy burden because foreign exchange
 earnings--converted into domestic currency--in general do not
 cover production costs.   Last year, for example, foreign trade
 subsidies are estimated to have almost quadrupled.   Some
 Chinese economists consider foreign exchange reserves exces-
 sive, implying that more imports should have been purchased to
 enhance supplies of consumer goods in the cities.
 --Rapid growth of the Chinese economy has kept pressure on bot-
 tleneck sectors, particularly energy and transportation.   The

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2011/12/01 : CIA-RDP93T01142R000100240032-2
 continued rise in government spending necessary to finance
 construction of dams, powerplants, highways, and railroads is
 threatened by the rising portion of the state budget consumed
 by subsidies.   The budget deficit, in fact, has grown in the
 past two years, adding to problems with inflation.
 Wide-Ranging Initiatives
 An important shift suggested by the decision of the October
 1984 plenum is an effort to proceed concurrently with the various
 reforms to planning, pricing, wage, and management systems.   Before
 the plenum, public and private discussions by Chinese officials had
 indicated that price reform--including reduction of subsidies--was
 viewed as the most difficult task and would be tackled last.
 Although no plan for price reform has been revealed, the
 timetable for initial adjustments appears to have been advanced.
 The period to accomplish price reform, however, may extend beyond
 that scheduled for other changes.  Recently published remarks by
 Premier Zhao Ziyang show that he expects price reform to continue
 into the 1990s.   Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang projects a more
 rapid pace for reform.   In a speech delivered in late November and
 reported in the China Daily, Hu provided a 3-4 year timetable for
 price reform.   Hu also said that wage increases would be granted
 first to prevent any decline in living standards, stressed that
 price adjustments would not be allowed to result in a rise in the
 price level, and pledged that the leadership would proceed with
 extreme caution.l/
 None of the targets of reform is new and all had been
 described--at least in principle--in the press.   Many changes
 already have been implemented on a selective, experimental basis.
 For example, above-quota production of rice and coal is being sold
 at floating prices.   Decentralization also is under way.   In at
 least two cities and in selected factories in some others, man-
 agers are operating factories independently of state ministries.
 Provincial and local officials, too, are taking on greater roles in
 economic decisionmaking, especially in foreign trade and in the
 allocation of investment for local enterprise development.
 On October 4, two weeks before the plenum met, the State
 Council approved a set of provisional reforms of the planning
 system to take effect beginning in 1985.   The number of product
 groups covered by compulsory state production plans will be reduced
 1/    (C)   Hu's remarks probably were intended to assuage popular
 fears of an erosion of purchasing power.   For example, news
 that the October plenum had approved a price reform sparked a
 consumer purchasing spree at retail outlets.

 from 120 to 60 in industry and from 29 to 10 in agriculture.   In
 place of compulsory plans the state will rely on guidance plan-
 ning and market regulation.   A narrower focus for state control is
 also featured in planning of materials supply, domestic commerce,
 foreign trade, and wages. The investment plan will remain man-
 datory for projects financed by the state budget, but the coverage
 of the investment plan will continue to shrink.
 Institutional and Practical Limitations
 Retaining central command over key industrial and agricul-
 tural products?  will lessen the benefits of reform, but it also
 will provide a means for the state to contain undesired side
 effects.   Products excluded from planning reform probably account
 for more than half of the gross value of industrial and agricul-
 tural output.   By concentrating state control on production and
 distribution of industrial inputs, the leadership is ensuring
 against a wrenching dislocation of the economy--an event that
 could overturn the leadership as well as its policies.
 Similar caution is likely to appear in managerial reforms.
 Officials have expressed concern about the capabilities of enter-
 prise managers because many owe their positions to political
 connections and may lack the expertise needed to run factories
 independent of ministerial controls.   These concerns probably were
 not mollified by results of a state-conducted test in August 1984:
 94 percent of more than 9,000 managers passed a-section on prin-
 ciples of business administration.   This outcome suggests that the
 leadership is not insisting on very high standards and that the
 state may provide highly specific guidance to firms for some time.
 Party influence in factory affairs--through the factory party
 committee--is being called upon to shepherd the transition to the
 new management system.   Factory party secretaries will be judged
 by their progress on this task.   In this fashion, the leadership
 may be trying. to coopt one of the more likely resistance elements
 into support of the reform program.
 Wage reform differs in thrust from other reforms and is
 pointed mainly at reversing past emphasis on egalitarianism.   Wage
 differentials are to be widened to reward those with better skills
 and more responsibilities.  To enhance worker incentives, wages and
 bonuses are to be increased to reflect gains in productivity and
 profits; and, where possible, wages will be calculated on a piece-
 (U)                      This includes such products as fuels and power,  ferrous
 and nonferrous metals,  building materials,  chemicals,  selected
 machinery and equipment, grain,  cotton,  edible oil,  and
 tobacco.

 Declassified and Approved For Release 2011/12/01 : CIA-RDP93T01142R000100240032-2
 rate basis.   Wage levels, however, will not be set competitively
 in a labor market.   The state will continue to determine the size
 of the wage fund, and decisions on its distribution will filter
 down to provincial officials and enterprise managers.   Moreover,
 controls will remain in place which inhibit job-changing and
 migration to high-wage areas, blunting the influence of market
 signals to guard against too rapid urbanization.
 The Challenge of Inflation and Unemployment
 Inflation is the most dangerous problem the leadership will
 face in the reform period.   Hyperinflation 40 years ago led con-
 sumers to cherish price stability and to tolerate coupon ration-
 ing.   Popular resentment could be raised by perceived-lack of
 fairness in price rationing, an issue certain to be fanned by
 opponents of the reformers' policies.   The reform also will worsen
 China's problem with unemployment.  While unemployment will be a
 less tractable problem for government controls than inflation,  it
 is less likely to generate social unrest great enough to threaten
 the leadership.
 Inflationary Pressures.  Price revisions are likely to result
 in a hike in the general price level, depending on the strength of
 the leadership's effort to make prices rational.   The State Eco-
 nomic Commission expects that about 10 percent of China's indus-
 trial output will be freed from state price controls, according to
 a commission official interviewed recently by a Japanese newspaper.
 The leadership probably could brake excessive price increases for
 these goods.   More upward pressure on the general price level is
 likely to result from price changes in the broad range of products
 that remain under state control.   Fuel, particularly coal, is
 priced cheaply in China compared with both prevailing inter-
 national prices and domestic costs.   Higher energy prices would
 induce most industries to press for higher product prices.
 In the consumer sector, higher prices for basic foodstuffs
 can be avoided if productivity continues to grow rapidly in the
 farm sector.   Prices for quality foods, however, may escalate
 sharply as households attempt to improve their diets.   Prices for
 manufactured consumer goods and construction materials also are
 likely to rise as increasing household incomes put pressure on
 supplies.   In this respect, the one-time increase in the wage
 level, planned to maintain living standards, may feed inflation.
 Unemployment Problems.   The reform initially will slow the
 rate of job creation, intensifying unemployment.   The state hopes
 to overcome any decline in the rate of job creation in the state
 sector by encouraging expansion of cooperative and small private
 ventures.   The cooperative/private sector has grown exponentially
 during the past two years, especially in the area of services.
 I            Declassified and Approved For Release 2011/12/01 : CIA-RDP93T01142R000100240032-2
 Declassified and Approved For Release 2011/12/01 : CIA-RDP93T01142R000100240032-2
 Rapid growth rates, however, rest upon a very small base, and this
 policy is unlikely to keep the unemployment rate from rising.   The
 government probably will avoid overly concentrated unemployment by
 selectively moderating its policies and will try to respond to
 complaints by raising expenditures on income maintenance programs.
 Underemployment in industry is widespread.   Because the
 reform is partly directed at encouraging factory management to
 become more profit-minded, managers are likely to use their
 expanded authority to trim the ranks of workers.   The Chinese
 press already is citing examples of firms reducing the number of
 workers and obtaining increases in production.   Factories that
 displace workers are responsible for locating work for these
 employees but are not required to find jobs that provide the same
 level of income.   The political sensitivity of this issue will
 make managers cautious, and the number of underemployed workers
 could rise as factories are modernized.   Large cuts in factory
 work forces are unlikely.   More troublesome will be decisions on
 closure of unprofitable enterprises.
 Compounding the state's problem, demographic factors indicate
 that the number of new entrants to the labor force will continue to
 rise as the reform is being implemented and extended.   Light indus-
 try including textiles provided two-thirds of the new jobs in
 industry in recent years.   This sector, however, will have the
 greatest difficulty adjusting to reform.
 Problems of Growth, Investment, and Urban-Rural Differences
 The initial adjustment, especially to price revisions, will
 be painful for many small, light industry factories that are
 profitable only because of the current structure of administra-
 tively set prices.   Heavy industry will feel the effect of the
 drive to weed out inefficient firms but probably will have more
 time to adjust.   Zhao expects that the rate of industrial growth
 may drop to about 7 percent during the 1986-90 five-year plan
 period.   Even though reform probably will slow the rate of
 industrial growth over the next few years, it should improve the
 quality and mix of goods and services and reduce the proportion of
 products that accumulate in unsalable inventories.
 Complications may arise from the plenum's call for focusing
 investment on upgrading existing factories.   Imports of equipment
 and technology are projected to reach about $14 billion during
 1985-87, according to a recent announcement by Zhu Rongji, Vice
 Minister of the State Economic Commission.   Purchases of machinery
 and technology from the West, however, could surge above this
 amount.   Along with gaining more control over investment deci-
 sions, factory managers are being allowed more freedom to conduct
 trade.   Trade deficits seem likely unless the central authorities

 limit managers' access to foreign exchange.   But this would put
 the state back into the process of administrative rationing,
 undercutting the reform program.
 Finally, reform could aggravate problems of unequal income
 distribution.   The sensitivity of this issue centers on gaps in
 living standards between urban workers and peasants3/ and between
 the more affluent provinces along the coast and the poorer prov-
 inces in the interior.   Past policies have concentrated on nar-
 rowing differences in earnings and opportunities.   Current policies
 emphasize rapid development of the coastal regions, prior to
 beginning large-scale redevelopment of the industrial northeast.
 Efforts to modernize more backward regions are far in the future.
 The gaps in income distribution, therefore, probably will
 widen.   How fast they widen will depend on trends in the terms of
 trade between regions and between various sectors in the economy
 and will be an additional result of price reform.   Even if the
 leadership copes with more immediate challenges to reform posed by
 inflation and unemployment, it will have to grapple for years with
 a worsening regional problem because of the growth strategy it has
 chosen.

 3/     (U)   China's State Statistical Bureau recently reported that
 in 1983 the ratio of the standard of living between urban
 workers and peasants was 2.2:1.   This is a substantial gap,
 but the ratio also is at its lowest level in the history of
 the People's Republic.
