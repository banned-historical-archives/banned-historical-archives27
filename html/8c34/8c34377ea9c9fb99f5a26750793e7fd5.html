 Premier Jaruzelski returned home yesterday after two days of
 talks in Moscow.  Warsaw's continued delay in covering the interest
 yauments overdue to Western banks from 1981 may bring default nearer.
 Polish and Soviet leaders yesterday concluded their
 two-day summit with a communique in which the Poles re-
 newed their loyalty to Moscow and to "socialism" and
 pledged to "cut short resolutely" any future efforts to
 disrupt Poland's economic and political system.
 The communique mentioned the "vital significance"
 of dependable deliveries of fuel and raw materials and
 said that Moscow will continue to support and assist the
 Poles.   Warsaw promised to "make efforts" to ensure bal-
 anced Soviet-Polish trade.   In addition,  the two sides
 noted that CEMA is ready to help Poland.
 Moscow and Warsaw criticized US  interference in
 Poland's internal affairs, particularly the "sordid
 attempts" to use the CSCE followup conference in Madrid
 for this purpose.
 Meanwhile, unidentified Soviet sources have told
 Western reporters that the USSR agreed during Jaruzelski's
 visit to provide Poland with more aid than was called for
 in the protocol of early January.   The sources did not
 indicate how much additional aid would be provided, or
 in what form.
 Comment:   The communique,  as well as the visit as a
 whole,  is reminiscent of the pre-Solidarity era.   The
 opaque language,  lack of detail,  and the conformity of
 views reveal little about. the course of discussion.
 The brief reference to balanced trade in the commu-
 nique suggests that Moscow will not be generous with its
 help.   Additional aid could take several forms.   Moscow
 might allow the Poles to run a trade deficit in 1982
 larger than the 1.2 billion rubles agreed to in January,
 provide hard currency credits, or accelerate deliveries

 of Soviet goods.   Rather than a single,  large commitment,
 Moscow probably prefers to dole out additional aid piece-
 meal and to base its decisions on the course of events
 in Poland in order to maximize its leverage.

 EL SALVADOR:   Increasing Rightist Strength
 //The cogoverning Christian Democrats, concerned over growing
 support for the right, are considering a postelection coalition
 with the conservative National Conciliation Party.

 Salvador's request for economic assistance.//
 //Christian Democratic officials reportedly believe

 Impending IMF Assistance
 Top Secret
 The IMF reportedly will approve El Salvador's re-
 quest for a $40 million aid package for 1982 by late
 this month.   In exchange,  San Salvador has agreed to
 reduce government deficits by slashing nondefense spend-
 ing by nearly 30 percent in real terms this year.   In
 addition,  the government has agreed to limit the decline
 in its foreign exchange reserves,  to continue to liber-
 alize currency controls, and to put ceilings on domestic
 credit, particularly for the public sector.
 Comment:   The IMF aid will provide part of the
 approximately $180 million needed to prevent a decline
 in imports and GNP this year.   To meet the tough terms,
 however,  the government probably will require additional
 assistance from other donors beyond the roughly $300 mil-
 lion already promised.   The IMF's position is a signifi-
 cant departure from the attitude prevailing last July,
 when European members of the Executive Board were reluct-
 ant to agree to funding in the absence of longranae
 guarantees of economic and political stability.

 CHINA:   Streamlining the Bureaucracy
 measures are in fact a political purge.
 The speech by Premier Zhao Ziyang marking the official inau-
 guration yesterday of China's bureaucratic reform program outlined
 specific reorganization plans and sought to allay fears that the
 and Army bureaucracies.
 Zhao stated that the State Council's 98 ministries,
 commissions, and agencies will be pared to 52 and their
 staffs reduced by one-third.   The reform of the provin-
 cial and municipal governments, originally scheduled for
 the second half of 1982, will be delayed until next year.
 Zhao did not touch on reforms under way within the party
 not at individuals.
 The Premier acknowledged the difficulty and magni-
 tude of the task, but he also noted that the smoothness
 with which the preliminary work had proceeded over the
 past two months attests to China's political stability
 and unity.   He termed the reorganization a "profound
 revolution" aimed only at administrative structures and
 administrative streamlining.
 Comment:   Despite Zhao's assertions, the reorgani-
 zation is in part politically motivated.   Vice Chairman
 Deng Xiaoping realizes he will have to remove thousands
 of politically suspect officials to guarantee his suc-
 cession arrangements and ensure the continuation of his
 policies after he leaves office, but the leadership
 appears less united on this cause than on the need for
 Details of the bureaucratic reforms had been
 closely guarded, while leaders negotiated behind the
 scenes who would go first and when, and Zhao's speech
 indicates that these decisions have been made.   Deng and
 his allies will want to maintain momentum, however, while

 retaining the appearance of leadership stability and
 unity.   Threatened bureaucrats will seize on any hint
 of income.
 China probably will realize little if any immediate
 economic saving from the reorganization.   Lucrative
 retirement benefits--including full salary--in effect
 will purchase the compliance of senior officials who
 exceed the new age limits.   Many younger surplus offi-
 cials will be assigned to courses for professional
 training and political indoctrination, with no loss

 SOMALIA:   Cabinet Changes
 President Siad's cabinet changes on Monday are intended to
 confuse potential political opponents during his impending absence
 from the country and to create the impression of progress in deal-
 ing with economic and military problems.
 Acting Defense Minister Omar Haji--who visited
 Washington seeking military aid in January--has been
 demoted to Minister of Health.   He is being replaced by
 Vice President Samantar, who served as Defense Minister
 in a previous cabinet.   Samantar is close to Siad and
 retains support in the Army.
 //The demotion of Omar Haji suggests that Siad knew
 of his intention to use his position to build a power
 base.   Samantar will now be in _a position to undo Omar
 Haji's efforts.//
 Comment:   //The President probably also was disap-
 pointed by Omar Haji's failure to obtain more military
 aid from the US.   Siad's appointment of Samantar, who
 has been less vocally pro-Western than Omar Haji, may
 be a signal to Washington that Siad does not want Somalia
 taken for granted.   The President also may believe that
 he will now win personal credit for any increased US
 assistance, which he is likely to seek next week during
 his visit to Washington.//
 //The limited scope of the changes reflects Siad's
 increasing rigidity in dealing with his political and
 economic problems.   Siad hopes that increased US assistance
 will strengthen his domestic position, but aid programs
 under consideration in the West will have little effect
 unless accompanied by fundamental reforms.//

 //Alfonso Guerra, the Socialists'  second in command,

 the Socialists ahead of the governing Democratic Center
 Union.  Gonzalez believes he would need the acquiescence
 of business leaders to govern, however  and has been
 campaigning hard to win their trust.//
 Comment:   //The quarrel within the leadership re-
 flects a longstanding division between Gonzalez and the
 more leftist rank and file.   Guerra's challenge, however,
 is probably less a show of strength than an attempt to

 USSR-CUBA:   Trade Prospects
 Soviet Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Komarov,  who
 signed the trade protocol for 1982 in Havana last month,
 subsequently has suggested that trade will increase in
 value by 25 percent over last year.   An accord on
 credits also was signed.   Available data indicate that
 Soviet trade with Cuba increased less than 10 percent
 during the last two years.
 Comment:   The Soviets probably are willing to
 support such an increase, despite growing economic prob-
 lems at home,  in order to reassure President Castro of
 Moscow's commitment in the face of mounting US pressures
 against Cuba.
 USSR - EAST ASIA:   Soviet Peace Proposals
 President Brezhnev has broadened Soviet arms con-
 trol propaganda to include East Asia and the Pacific.
 The Soviet leader,  in a wide-ranging letter responding
 to an appeal by an Australian group to curtail the arms
 race,  recently proposed that the US and USSR limit mili-
 tary activities in the Pacific.   In replying to a similar
 appeal from Japanese intellectuals,  Brezhnev on Monday
 proposed a formal bilateral agreement that Moscow would
 not use nuclear arms against Japan in return for a pro-
 hibition by the Japanese against nuclear warheads on
 their territory.
 Comment:   The suggestion for curbing military activ-
 ities in the Pacific,  which parallels the Soviet proposal
 for the Indian Ocean, underscores Moscow's interest in
 encouraging public support for regional security talks
 in the western Pacific,  particularly in Japan.   Brezhnev's
 proposal will embarrass Prime Minister Suzuki.    Even though
 Suzuki will reject it in order not to put a further
 strain on Japan's security relationship with the US,
 he will find it difficult to present a rationale that
 will be persuasive for the many Japanese opposed to
 nuclear weapons.   Suzuki is open to criticism by the
 opposition parties because he has already gone on record
 that the government will under no circumstances permit
 nuclear weapons to transit or be based in Japan.

 Western donors have decided to provide only $7 mil-
 lion for some 15,000 metric tons of rice to keep open
 the UN-sponsored emergency relief pipeline via Phnom Penh.
 Donors have already agreed to continue a separate aid
 program for Kampucheans living along the Thai border.
 If a critical food shortage develops in the interior of
 Kampuchea,  however,  the Western donors will increase
 assistance through Phnom Penh somewhat--provided the
 Heng Samrin regime permits improved international moni-
 toring of Western aid distribution and the Soviet Bloc
 donates the bulk of any additional food requirements.
 Comment:   Neither condition is likely to be met.
 Aid commitments so far by all donors will not meet most
 of the large anticipated food shortfall this year in
 Kampuchea.   Various sources--using Phnom Penh's data--
 estimate that this deficit will range from 280,000 to
 315,000 tons.     Any large shortage probably will lead to
 another mass movement to the Thai border by Kampucheans

 CHINA:   Fertilizer Shortage
 Beijing has issued price and distribution regula-
 tions to make better use of dwindling supplies of chem-
 ical fertilizer.   The government especially wants to
 stop cooperative employees from selling fertilizer at
 inflated prices for personal profit or trading it for
 scarce consumer goods.  Last year, potash output dropped
 by 45 percent,  and imports of fertilizer declined sli htly
 because of a shortage of foreign exchange.
 Comment:  Fertilizer remains a critical commodity
 because increased food production will require adequate
 supplies.   China has asked a US firm to help open new
 potash mines and is considering outside assistance to
 increase its output of nitrogen fertilizer.

 //The decision to seek improved relations with
 Israel, which have been strained since de Gaulle stopped

 //Mitterrand will point to his public support for
 the Camp David accords and for French participation in
 the Sinai peacekeeping force as evidence of his support
 for practical steps toward peace.   At the same time, he
 will suggest that the Camp David process cannot resolve
 the Palestinian issue and that a supplementary approach
 is needed.   Mitterrand believes that to preserve its inde-
 pendence and security,  Israel eventually will have to
 accept the establishment of an independent Palestinian
 state.//
 //The President may cite the proposals outlined last
 year by Saudi Prince Fahd as constructive.   He will take
 care,  however,  to disassociate France from some aspects
 of those proposals,  such as making Jerusalem the capital
 of a Palestinian state.//
 //Mitterrand doubts that Prime Minister Begin can
 be persuaded to alter his approach to the peace process.
 French officials apparently fear that Begin soon may
 take some provocative action, possibly an attack on
 southern Lebanon.   They probably believe that France's
 counsel will be received more favorably by elements of
 the Labor Party.//
 //The French leader will attempt to assuage Begin's
 concerns over French nuclear cooperation with Iraq.   He
 probably will argue that renewed cooperation would be
 tied to Baghdad's acceptance of strict safeguards, pre-
 venting the diversion of French equipment and technology
 for military purposes.//
 Mending Fences With Arab Leaders
 //Syrian President Assad and PLO officials already
 have criticized Mitterrand's visit, with the PLO now
 asking Mitterrand to invite Yasir Arafat to Paris--a
 request Mitterrand is likely to refuse.   The trip also
 may undermine Renault's efforts to end the Arab boycott
 against it.//

 visits to Jordan and Iraq.//
 //French officials appear confident, nevertheless,
 that relations with leading Arab partners will not be
 seriously affected.   Paris recently has attempted to
 reassure Arab leaders that France will not soften its
 position supporting the Palestinians or change its policy
 of seeking closer ties with the Arab states.   Mitterrand
 is likely to reiterate such assurances during subsequent
 peace with Israel.//
 //Despite its reservations, Paris probably will in-
 crease behind-the-scenes efforts to develop a unified
 Arab endorsement of the Fahd proposals after the Israeli
 withdrawal from the Sinai.   The French also may seek to
 promote a reconciliation between Egypt and other Arab
 states, especially Saudi Arabia.   French officials appar-
 ently believe that renewed Egyptian leadership in the
 Arab world would help bring other Arab states closer to
 improvement of relations with Israel.//
 //The French also will continue to encourage Israel
 to be more forthcoming on the Palestinian issue.   France's
 insistence on this, combined with its efforts to broaden
 considerable ties with the Arab states, will limit the
 //Mitterrand may eventually offer suggestions of his
 own on the peace process--probably after consultations
 with France's EC partners--if he sees a consensus develop-
 ing among key interested parties.   He probably will take
 pains, however, to ensure that France is viewed as sup-
 porting initiatives from within the region rather than
 proposing a formula from outside.//
 //Paris is unlikely to make any such move until it
 has a clearer picture of US policy toward the region.
 French officials apparently believe that only Washington
 can hope to obtain significant concessions from the
 Israelis but that US officials have yet to focus on the
 Palestinian issue.   Paris probably will remain skeptical
 that a strategic consensus on resisting possible Soviet
 threats to the region can be achieved until the Pales-
 tinian issue is resolved.//
