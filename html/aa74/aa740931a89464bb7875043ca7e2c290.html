 27 September 1965
 Western       In Whose Interest
 Unity
 BrIefly Noted 0000"
 The reaction to Gen. de
 Gaulle's 9 September
 press conference among
 his EEC and NATO partners ranged
 from silence to restrained disap-
 pointment when he confirmed a de-
 termination to cripple the exist-
 ing machinery of Western solidarity
 and strength.   His allies apparently
 saw little point in reiterating what
 had been said so often - that NATO
 and the EEC embodied the collective
 politico-economic strength without
 which the West would be impotent vis-
 a-vis Communist threats.  And no mat-
 ter how noble the Western vision or
 its intent toward the East might be,
 as Brzezinski pointed out in "Peace-
 ful Engagement"
 "no Western policy of conciliation
 is possible in a context which allows
 the other side opportunities for ef-
 fective military blackmail."
 However, the outpouring of Com-
 munist comment from Moscow, Pankow
 and Warsaw (with others yet to be
 heard from) made clear that they rec-
 ognized Western solidarity as the pri-
 mary obstacle to Communist designs in
 Europe.
 On 11 Sept, Radio Moscow quoted
 de Gaulle's statement that, "France
 attributes much importance to the new
 trend in its relations with Russia.
 It rejoices over the result of the
 visit of the head of the Rumanian Gov-
 ernment, G. Maurer, and prepares with
 great satisfaction to welcome the head
 of the Polish Government, J. Cyran-
 kiewicz" ... "France's (statement) of
 relations with the socialist countries
 of Eastern Europe reveals the
 realistic approach of French diplo-
 macy to this problem."  On 12 Sept,
 Radio Moscow broadcast the text of
 a "commentator's roundtable" amongst
 whom were-the editor of-Pravda
 Valentin Zorir_, and others.  In an
 effort to exacerbate U.S.-French re-
 lations, these Kremlin spokesmen as-
 serted that the U.S. had forced
 agreements upon France in the past,
 and was now characterizing de Gaulle
 as a major enemy of the U.S.   Commu-
 nist hopes were clear in their state-
 ment that, "France's actual with-
 drawal from NATO would mean an almost
 mortal blow to the organization, if
 not a mortal one ... it is beyond
 doubt that these actions of Gen. de
 Gaulle against the American dictate,
 against the imposition of NATO plans
 upon Europe, and of Common Market
 plans, objectively represent a posi-
 tive factor in the political life of
 today."
 On 10 Sept, East Berlin Radio
 applauded de Gaulle's press confer-
 ence statements, especially his
 reference to the EEC commission in
 Brussels as  an embryo of technoc-
 racy," and the European Parliament
 as "a figurative legislature."  The
 French attitude toward the visiting
 Rumanian and Polish delegations was
 hailed, as was the French attitude
 toward the Oder-Neisse line (there
 is no evidence that de Gaulle actu-
 ally did discuss the Oder-Neisse
 issue with Cyrankiewicz).
 On 11 Sept, Warsaw Radio and
 the CP organ, Trybuna Ludu, spoke
 favorably of the press conference:
 "de Gaulle's statements were like a

 lecture on the policy of a state
 that is building its independence on
 the strong basis of a realistic view
 of the world ... de Gaulle demon-
 strated a consistent foreign policy -
 a consistence also proved by his other
 declarations."

 Lin Piao's statement of the Chicom blueprint
 for world war has captured wide attention; it
 may tend to obscure the fact that Soviet strat-
 egy -- even if more cautious and realistic than
 Peking's aggressiveness -- aims ultimately at
 the same goal of world domination.
 BUT, the USSR is faced with two diametrically
 opposed tasks, which help to expose its real
 intent, namely:  to press its peaceful coex-
 istence strategy against the Free World while
 maintaining its position among Communist coun-
 tries and parties against the CCP's accusation
 that it is no longer a revolutionary party,
 society or power.
 SOVIET PROPAGANDA DEFENSIVE ON TWO FRONTS is
 a case study which shows     this dilemma
 his
 commentary on speeches made at a conference
 of Soviet agit-prop officials in Moscow in 1963
 is as pertinent today as it was when Khrushchev
 was in power, following the same strategies.

 September:  La,ve.riteg Paris-published "monthly" organ of the French
 section of the London-based ""International Committee," the smallest of
 the three factions contending for recognition as the Trotskyist "Fourth
 International," prints a 256-page special issue devoted entirely to a
 Stephan Just article entitled "Defense du Trotssysmeti" which deals mainly
 with (a) 'revisionism, the liquida.tin; factor, of the Fourth International,"
 abd (b) "the struggle for reconstruction of the Fourth International."
 September 1:  Moscow weekly New Times carries an article by President, Ho
 Chi Minh on the '"'20th anniversary of the DRV," -- which carefully and
 neutrally handles policy as "Marxism-Leninism creatively applied to the
 specific conditions of one's country," with absolute loyalty to proletar-
 ian internationalism.
 TASS announces that Suslov and Ponomarev met with top Spanish Com-
 mu.nists Ibarruri and Carrillo "vacationing in the USSR.`  An "exchange
 of opinions and information" took place "in an atmosphere of cordiality
 and friendship typical of the relationship between the CPSU and the PCE."
 September 2_3:  The Chinese Communists mark the 20th anniversary of V-J
 day with _a people's Daily editorial on the 2nd and a greatly expanded
 (30,000-.word), bellicosely arrogant  article by Vice Premier and Defense
 Minister Lin Piao, entitled "Long Live the Victory of the People's War,"
 published in all papers on the 3rd and in multilingual pamphlet form.
 The massive Lin article, intended to "review the historical experience
 of the great victory of the people's war in China and to recapitulate
 Comrade Mao Tse--tun 's theory of 12e22le's war ('diametrically opposed'
 to Soviet views)," repeats previous Chinese denunciations of the Soviet
 leadership in a 3,000-word final section, entitled "The Khrushchev Re-
 visionists Are Betrayers of People's War," and in numerous references
 earlier in the text.
 Working hand in glove with the U.S. imperialists, they
 are doing their utmost spread all kinds of arguments against people's
 war and, wherever they can, they are scheming to undermine it by
 overt or covert means....
 ... They have no faith in the masses and are afraid of U.S.
 imperialism, of war, and of revolution.
 The propaganda of the K revisionists against people's war and
 the publicity they give to defeatism and capitulationism tend to
 demoralize and spiritually disarm revolutionary people everywhere.
 These revisionists are doing what the U.S. imperialists are unable
 to do themselves and are rendering them great service ....  They
 have completely betrayed the M-L revolutionary theory of war and
 have become betrayers of people's war.

 is finished.  And. the successors to K revisionism will fare no
 better  . . . .,   will be  swept  like dust from the stage of history by

 September 3:  Pravda announces a top-level delegation of the Bolivian CP
 had visited the USSR in July-August:  talks with Ponomarev "in an atmos-
 phere of fraternal friendship" 1'showed that both parties' views coincided
 on questions of the World Communist and iational Liberation Movements.'
 September 3-6:  Radio Moscow announces that Premier Kosygin received a
 high-level, Rodriguez-led Cuban delegation on the 3rd:  they "had a
 friendly talk on matters of mutual interest."  Brezhnev received Rodriguez
 on the 6th, "in a friendly, cordial atmosphere."
 September 3-11: A top-level Rumanian party-state delegation, led by
 Party First Secy Ceausescu and Premier Maurer are given ostentatious
 reception and treatment during a week-long visit to the USSR, climaxed
 by a Kremlin rally and the signing of a joint communique on the 10th.
 Brezhnev's rally speech ingratiatingly lauded Rumanian successes and
 repeatedly emphasized the need for unity and cohesion of all Communists
 and revolutionary forces in the face of such dangers as U.S. aggression
 in Vietnam, pressure for nuclear arms for the West German revenge-
 seekers, and the India-Pak conflict, indirectly striking at the Chinese,
 in connection with the latter, as "third forces" which "might appear'
 and which "will be gladdened and will try to make capital out of the
 aggravation of I-P relations, and sometimes add oil to the fires ....
 It is not difficult to predict that the dragging of these two states
 into a devastating internecine conflict and their mutual weakening could
 suit only those who dream of subjugating these two large Asian powers to
 their influence ....""  Ceausescu's reply goes along in supporting the
 duty to "exert every effort to promote the uninterrupted strengthening
 of unity and cohesion," -- but he devotes most of his time to strong
 insistence on "the principles of independence, equal rights, non-
 interference in internal affairs; respect of the right for each party
 to make its own decisions,  etc.  His only reference to China is his call
 for "the reinstitution of the lawful rights of the CPR in the UN."  The
 unusually long (5,000-word) communique, which, inter alia, announces
 their decision to form a mixed intergovernmental economic commission and
 the signing of a 5-year protocol on coordination of development plans
 and economic cooperation, begins with a bow to their "strict observance"
 of equality, mutual respect, etc., and stresses their "unbending resolve"
 to struggle to strengthen unity.  It endorses "the holding of a Second
 Conference of the Afro-Asian countrie-.without mentioning Soviet par-
 ticipation -,- and  the lawful rights" of the CPR in the UNIT.  It confirms
 the might of every party to express its opinions on questions of the ICI,

 but says that "differences arising ... ought _Zot to affect comradely
 international relax icn n yarong countries of the socialist system."  It
 endorses "tours fo'~ d   gat ohs- ,   official and unofficial visits" by
 party leaders, and. "brcadcr use of such forms of interparty cooperation
 as the holding of consultations," -- but says nothing about multiparty
 meetings.
 September 5:  The first Chinese comment on Indo-Pak warfare, by People's
 Daily Gbserrer, strongly su-worts Pakistan and denounces the  "Indian
 U.S. y al*.s?a,  a.i5 the t"ii revisionistswho Piave
 visa, with the U.73;_. _1n granting money and arras to India."
 September 6-15:   A top-level, Czech Party-State delegation, led by Presi-
 dent Novotny, is given a red-carpet reception in Moscow on the 6th, de-
 parts on a tour on the 8th (the Rumanian delegation departed on tour
 just before the Czech arrival on the 6th, returned to Moscow on the 9th,
 and went home on the llth),returns to Moscow on the 13th and meets again
 with top Soviet leadership on the 14th before going home on the 15th.
 After the first round of talks on the 7th, TASS reports that "a complete
 identity of vier*s was recorded on all the questions discussed..`  Drezhnev
 and Novotny speeches at a Kremlin rally on the 14th are replete with
 mutual praise and affirmations of solidarity and identity of views, with
 Novotny adding that "all of us must strive toward the holding of an
 international conference of C.cs at an appropriate time.'`  (Text of com-
 munique not yet available.)
 September 6:  Peking People's Daily Commentator, denouncing the "impos-
 ing" of the "act of reconciliation" on the Dominican people, declares
 that "Johnson and the modern revisionists have rejoiced too soon."
 September 7:  East German Party daily Neues Deutschland criticizes
 Indonesian CP Chairman Aidit's 16 August press conference remarks in
 favor of continuing public polemics (#61).   It is essential to avoid
 public polemics.  Comrade Aidit himself has repeatedly voiced this view,
 e.g., two years ago when he suggested to the CPSU and the CCP that they
 discontinue public polemics."
 An Albanian Zeri I Popullit editorial denouncing "Indian aggression
 against Pakistan" also strikes at "the e-%rer closer cooperation between
 the K revisionists and the Indian reactionaries to the detriment of the
 independence of other Asian countries and international security.  In
 this way both the K revisionists and U.S. imperialism seek to make India
 a pawnm in the anti-Chinese crusade."
 September 8:  A TASS statement in Pravda calling for a cease-fire be-
 tween India and Pakistan and offering Soviet good offices includes the
 assertion that the conflict only benefits "external forces" who are
 encouraging further Indo-Pak bloodshed `for their own purposes."

 "Now that the imperialist pressure on Afro-Asian countries is in-
 creasing, the opinion of UAR President- Nasir that the Soviet Union should
 take part in the Algiers conference becomes all the more significant.
 This opinion is shared by all those who remember the great contribution
 of the Soviet Union to the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and

 the U.S. on India's aggression against Pakistan has won U.S. appreciation.
 September 11:  An Observer article in North Vietnamese Party daily Phan
 Dan on the Indo-Pak conflict tries to balance between the Chinese and
 Soviet lines:  it is slightly weighted on the Pak side but tries to duck
 the issue by placing the blame heavily on the U.S. and U.K.
 September 11-12:  CPSU boss Brezhnev visits Poland "as guest of" Polish
 Party boss Gomulka and they "held friendly talks," according to TASS on

 September 12:  Peking distributes text of an interview granted 8 Septem-
 ber by Premier Chou En-lai to Kamal Amir, chief editor of the UAR's
 Middle East News Agency.  One question asked his views on Soviet partici-
 pation in the Algiers 2nd Afro-Asian Conference.  Answer:
 "The A-A Conference is a conference or Asian and African states.
 The Soviet Union is not an Asian state, nor is it an African state.
 Therefore, it is not qualified to take part in the A-A conference.  The
 reason is quite simple.   ... The question of Soviet participation should
 no longer exist.
 But the actions of the Soviet Government belie its words.  In re-
 cent months, it suddenly went back on its declared position . . asking
 some A-A countries to bring up again the question of Soviet participation....
 This is actually an attempt to stir up differences anew among the A-A
 countries, to disrupt A-A solidarity, and to confront the 2nd A-A Con-
 ference with a serious crisis or even with the danger of failing to con-
 vene.

 25X1 C 1 Ob CHINA ADVOCATES WORLD-WIDE WARS
 a.  countering ComChina's attempts to stir
 up wars and armed insurrections (or to pro-
 fit from existing conf icts) in all parts
 of the "third world";
 b.  exposing ComChina's true intentions in
 all Afro-Asian organizations and interna-
 tional fronts, particu a~ in the context
 of Bandung II (November 5, Algiers?) and of
 Sukarno's plans for a "Conefo" ("Conference
 of the New Emerging Forces");
 c.  opposing ComChina's admission to the UN
 and other international bodies and protest-
 ing diplomatic relations with Peking.
 SITUATION:  ComChina has proclaimed the "inevitability of wars in
 the age of imperialism" ever since it first appeared on the international
 scene.   In the Sino-Soviet conflict, Peking's peremptory demand to stage
 wars "of liberation" everywhere and Mao's contemptuous dictum that "all
 imperialists are paper tigers," were major bones of contention.   Chicom
 support for insurrections in Laos, Vietnam, the Congo, Zanzibar and else-
 where also dates back several years.
 During the last year, Peking vetoed peremptorily any negotiations
 to end the escalating war of Communist aggression in Vietnam, exploded
 its first two nuclear devices, expanded its diplomatic contacts in Africa
 and Asia preparatory to the Bandung II Afro-Asian Summit Conference (post-
 poned at the last minute because of the 'fall of Ben Bella), while inten-
 sifying its world-wide campaigns of subversive propaganda.   ComChina is
 encouraging Indonesia's aggression against Malaysia and champions Pakistan
 in her conflict with India, while denouncing Moscow's attempts to concili-
 ate the Indo-Pakistani fighting.
 Under these circumstances, an authoritative article "Long Live the
 Victory of the People's War," ostensibly pegged to the 20th anniversary
 of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II (but actually con-
 cerned with entirely different and more timely issues) and attributed to

 Marshal LIN Piao, Chicom Defense Minister, Vice Chairman of the Polit-
 bureau of the Chinese CP and one of Mao Tse Tung's oldest associates,
 has the significance of a major declaration of Chicom foreign policy.
 Extensive excerpts from the text of Lin Piao's article, in the
 English translation furnished by NCNA, the Chicom news agency, and re-
 printed in The New York Times, are to be found in an unclassified at-
 tachment.                            The text is accompanied by detailed notes, explanations and
 critical comments.   The following   h i g h l i g h t s    from the
 lengthy document should be especially noted (underlinings added):
 1.   "The seizure of power by armed force, the settlement of
 the issues by war, is ... the highest form of revolution"
 (p. 1 of attachment)
 2.   "The establishment of rural revolutionary base areas and
 the encirclement of cities from the countryside is of out-
 standing and universal practical importance ..." (p. 3)
 3.   "Since World War II, U.S. imperialism has stepped into the
 shoes of German, Japanese and Italian   F a s c i s m ...
 It is the most rabid aggressor in human history and the
 most ferocious common enemy of the people of the world."
 (P. 7)
 4.   "When the U.S. aggressors are hard pressed in one place,
 they have no alternative but to loosen their grip on
 others....  Everything is divisible.  And so is this co-
 lossus of U.S. imperialism.   It can be split up and
 d e f e a t e d."  (p. 9)
 5.   "U.S. imperialism relies solely on its nuclear weapons....
 Even if (it) brazenly uses nuclear weapons, it cannot con-
 quer the people who are indomitable."   (p. 9)
 6.   "The spiritual atom bomb that the revolutionary people
 possess is a far more powerful and useful weapon than the
 physical atom bomb."   (p. 10)
 7.   "As for revolutionary wars waged by the oppressed nations
 and peoples, so far from opposing them, we invariably give
 them firm support and active aid."   (p. 15)
 8.   "Imperialism is   w e a k e r   than ever and U.S. imperi-
 alism, the chieftain of world imperialism, is suffering
 one defeat after another.... the people's wars can be won
 and U.S. imperialism can be    d e f e a t e d    in all
 countries."  (p. 17)

 CZECHOSLOVAK PERFORMANCE, INDICTING COMMUNISM AT LARGE
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   Giuseppe Boffa is a leading Italian Communist journalist
 and author of the book, After Khrushchev.   He has spent the last twelve
 years in Moscow, Prague and other Communist capitals as permanent cor-
 respondent of Unita, the PCI's daily newspaper.   In August 1965 Unita
 published a series of four articles by Boffa, datelined Prague.   English
 translations of these articles are appended to this BPG (unclassified).
 Boffa proclaims at the outset that the Czechoslovak economy "suffered
 incalculable losses as a consequence of rejecting the Marshall Plan aid
 offered by the U.S. after the war, restricting trade with the West, and
 directing nearly all of its industrial exports to the socialist countries."
 He analyzes critically the deplorable results of the subordination of the
 economy of Czechoslovakia and of Moscow's other satellites - since 19+7 -
 to the interests of the Soviets.  He reviews how Moscow forced upon them
 its own economic and political models and forced them to implement the
 unrealistic plans of the Council for Mutual Economic Aid ("CEMA" or
 "COMECON").   In this typical Communist attempt to tie the inherent evils
 of their system to the dead past or deceased comrades, Boffa does not
 challenge whether the Novotny regime is seriously doing anything now to-
 ward the much-heralded domestic "reforms" or lessening of its massive
 "trade-aid" penetration of developing countries.
 The postwar plundering of satellites by the Soviets, and the satel-
 lites' descent into the morass of Communist mismanagement is scarcely
 news, to wit:

 BRITISH GUIANA
 25X1 C10b MOVES TOWARD INDEPENDENCE
 Ir
 SITUATION:    The British Government has called a conference in
 London for 2 November 1965 to establish, with the chief political lead-
 ers of British Guiana, procedures and date for granting final independ-
 ence to that land.   It is expected that this important event will be
 fixed for some time in the Spring or Summer of 1966.   It is equally ex-
 pected that there will be strong opposition to granting independence
 under the present circumstances by the largest political party in Brit-
 ish Guiana, the People's Progressive Party (PPP), led and dominated by
 Communists, most notably by Cheddi Jagan and his wife Janet.  (It must be
 noted that, while the leadership of the PPP is entirely Communist, the
 rank & file is certainly not.   It supports the leadership for strictly
 racial reasons.)
 Thanks to Jagan's policies during the past twenty years, the PPP
 has gained the almost exclusive support of the East Indian part of the
 nation's population, which comprises 48% of the total.  The PPP has thus
 managed to set the East Indians against the Negro -- or African as they
 are called there -- part of the population which comprises 34% of the
 total.   This unfortunate racial division led to constant and bitter
 strife during the many years in which Cheddi Jagan was Premier under the
 tutelage of the British Colonial Office.
 In the wake of elections held in December 1964, a coalition govern-
 ment came to power, headed by Forbes Burnham, leader of the predominantly
 African People's National Congress (PNC).   The third ranking party, the
 United Front (UF), received 3 out of the 13 cabinet posts with its leader,
 Peter D'Aguiar, named Minister of Finance.   This new government has al-
 ready made significant progress in assuaging the wounds of racial strife
 which were the legacy of Jagan's tenure.  Equally important, the nation's
 economy is rapidly recovering from Jagan's misguided and bungled manage-
 ment -- which has become almost the hallmark of crypto-Communist as well
 as avowedly Communist governments.
 Jagan recognizes the great disadvantages of having Independence ar-
 rive while his opposition is in office and he may be expected to try his
 worst to disrupt the peace of the nation badly enough to force the post-
 ponement of that event.  And if Independence is attained in spite of him,
 then his opposition tactics will be redoubled.

 Excerpts From Peking Declaration
 Urging World `People's War'
 to Destroy U.S.
 CPYRGHT
 PEKING, Sept. 3 (Reuters)-
 Following are excerpts from an
 article by the Chinese Commit-
 itist Defense Minister, Marshal
 Lin Piao, published in all,major
 Chinese newspapers today and
 made available in English by
 Hsinhua,  the  official  press
 agency:
 COMNENTATORtS NOTES :
 1.  Passages citing Mao The Tung are marked with
 an asterisk  t. *) ;
 2.  Passages attacking the Soviets are marked with
 a vertical black line I
 Marshal LIN Piao is Vice Chairman of  the Politburo
 and of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
 Party ( CCP ), Minister of National Defense and Vice
 Chairman of the National Defense Council.  L1n Piao
 was born in Hupeh in 1908, son of a factory owner.
 He went from a Middle School in Wuchang to the
 Military Academy and graduated 15025.  In the same year,
 he joined the CC?.  In 1y32, he was appointed connnander
 of the First Red Army and made the "Long March" .-with
 Mao to the North.   Wounded when fighting  the Japanese,
 he spent four years, 1y38 - 15042, in the Soviet Union
 for medical treatment. He has been a member  of the
 Central Committee, CCP,  since 1yb5?
 It was on the basis of the
 lessons derived from the peo-
 ple's wars in China that Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung, using the
 simplest and the most vivid
 language, advanced the fa-
 mous  thesis  that  "political
 power grows out of the barrel
 of a gun."
 He clearly pointed out:
 The seizure of power by
 armed force, the settlement
 of the issues by war, is the
 central task and the highest
 form  of  revolution.  This
 Marxist-Leninist principle of
 revolution holds good univer-
 sally, for r }~Chinar~ve 11 ed  or

 War is the product of im-
 perialism and the system of
 exploitation. of man by man.
 Lenin said that "war is al-
 ways and everywhere begun
 by the exploiters themselves,
 by the ruling and oppressing
 classes."
 So long as imperialism and
 the system of exploitation of
 ma' by man exist, the im-
 perialists  and  reactionaries
 will= invariably rely on armed
 forge to maintain their reac-
 tionary rule and Impose war
 on the oppressed nations and
 peoples. This is an objective
 law independent of man's will,
 Readiness to Go to War
 Is Marxist `Touchstone'
 In the last analysis, whether
 one dares to wage a tit-for-
 tat -struggle against armed
 aggression  and  suppression
 by the imperialists and their
 lackeys, whether one dares to
 fight a people's war against
 therit  means  whether   one
 dares to embark on revolu-
 tion. This is the most effective
 touchstone for distinguishing
 genuine from fake revolution-
 aries and Marx.ist.Leninists.
 In view of the fact that
 some people were afflicted
 with the fear of the imperial-
 ists and reactionaries, Com-
 rade Mao Tse-tung put for-
 ward his famous thesis that
 "the imperialists and all reac-
 tionaries are paper tigers."
 In  appearance,  the  reac-
 tionaries are terrifying but in
 reality they are not so pow-
 erful. From a long-term point
 of view, it is not the reac-
 tionaries but the people who
 are really powerful.
 The history of the people's
 war in China and other coun-
 tries provides conclusive evi-
 dence that the growth of the
 people's revolutionary forces
 from weak and small begin-
 nings into strong and large
 forces is a universal law of de-
 velopment of the class strug-
 gle, a universal law of devel-
 opment of the people's war.
 A  people's  war  inevitably
 meets with many difficulties,
 with ups and downs and set-
 backs in the course of its de-
 velopment, but no force can
 alter its general trend toward
 inevitable triumph.
 Comrade   Mao   Tse-tung
 points out that we must de-
 spise the enemy strategically
 and take full account of him
 tactically.
 To despise the enemy-stra-
 tegically is an elementary re-
 quirement  for a  revolution-
 ary. Without the courage to
 despise the enemy and with-
 out daring to win, it will be
 simply impossible to make a
 revolution and wage a peo-
 ple's war, let alone to achieve
 CPYRGHT
 This allegation that war is absolutely inevitable is
 even more categorical than the formula to 'which the
 CC? leaders agreed a few years earlier, when they
 voted for the STATEMENT of the leaders of 81 Communist
 Parties, convened in Moscow, November 1960 t hereafter
 referred to as the Statement )i-ch declared :
 tt  The aggressive nature of imperialism has not
 changed.  But real forces have appeared that are
 capable of foiling its plans of aggression.  War
 is not fatally inevitable.  11 t Underlining added )
 MAO never faced a major power in war :  the Japanese,
 soon after invading the Chinese mainland, waged also
 wars against the U.S. and Britain.  Moreover, the
 Japanese forces in China had to fight not only the
 Communists but also the Nationalists.
 'There is no such "universal law".  Many revolutionary
 uprisings in history failed . German Peasant War 1525s
 Paris Commune 1871,  Hungarian uprising 1956 ), either
 because the opposition was too strong or the revolu-
 tionaries were ill prepared and lacked unity.  Other
 uprisings succeeded temporarily but ended ultimately
 in a tyranny as bad as ( if not worse than ) the regime
 they had overthrown :  the French revolution of 1789
 led to Napoleon I, their revolution of 181.8 to Napoleon
 III, the Russian revolution of 1917 to Stalin. Hardly
 encouraging for anybody contemplating another "peoplets
 war".

 Thesis of `Paper Tiger'
 Called Light of Truth
 The  imperialists are  ex-
 tremely             afraid  of         Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung's thesis that
 "imperialism and the reac-
 tionaries are paper tigers"
 and the revisionists are ex-
 tremely hostile to it. They all
 oppose and attack this thesis
 and the Philistines follow suit
 by ridiculing it. But all this
 cannot in the least diminish
 its importance. The light of
 truth cannot be dimmed by
 an body.
 Comrade Mao  Tse-tung's
 theory of the peoples' war
 solves not only the problem of
 daring to fight a . people's
 war, but also that of how to
 wage it.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung is a
 great statesman and military
 scientist, proficient at direct-
 ing war in accordance with
 its  laws.  By  the line and
 policies, the strategy and tac-
 tics  he  formulated for  the
 people's war, he led the Chi-
 nese people in steering the
 ship of the people's war past
 all hidden reefs to the shores
 of victory inmost complicated
 and difficult conditions.
 It must be emphasized that
 Conirade   Mao   Tse-tung's
 theory of the establishment
 of  rural  revolutionary base
 areas and the encirclement of
 cities from the countryside is
 of outstanding and universal
 practical importance for the
 present revolutionary strug-
 gles of all the oppressed na-
 tions and peoples, and partic-
 ularly for the revolutionary
 struggles of the oppressed na-
 tions and peoples in Asia,
 Africa  and  Latin America
 against imperialism and its
 lackeys.
 Many countries and peoples
 in Asia, Africa and Latin
 America are now being sub-
 jected to aggression and en-
 slavement on a serious scale
 by the imperialists headed by
 the United States and their
 lackeys.  The basic political
 and' economic  conditions  in
 many of these countries have
 many  similarities  to  those
 that prevailed in old China.
 As  in    China, the  peasant
 question is extremely impor-
 tant in these regions.                     The
 peasants constitute the main
 force of the national-demo-

 Mao's 11 PAPER TIGER 11 doctrine has never been put  to
 the acid test.  Of course, the mere possession of
 bigger and better military "hardware" alone has never
 insured victory.  The morale of the armed forces, the
 political stability of the country, political and
 military leadership etc. are also determining factors.
 Some times regimes have collapsed or lost wars because
 of such non-mrrtlitary shortcomings : this experience,
 however, applies by no means only to "imperialists"
 but to all kinds of political  systems, including
 Communist ores.  Mao's slogan attempts to cause the
 same type of dangerous delusion which made Hitler and
 his Axis partners contemptuously describe the Western
 powers as "decadent democracies" -- whereupon they
 lost World War Two.
 11 Establishment of rural revolutionary base areas and
 the encirclement of cities from the countryside .... 11
 contributed unquestionably to Mao's seizure of power
 in China and is now standard doctrine for all Communist
 guerrilla movements and insurrections, whether or not
 directed by pupils of Peking.  However, Mao might have
 never won if the Japanese had not been defeated outside
 China and if the Chirese Nationalists had received from
 the free world the kind of material and political
 support Mao received from, his "big brother" Stalin.
 Moreover, it remains to be seen whether rural bases
 remain safe and whether cities can be effecter. ely en-
 circled if the guerrillas have to face modern t non-
 nuclear ) weapons and a really determined foe, not
 the obsolete equipment of the Chinese Nationalists or
 the half-hearted effort of France against Ho Chi Minh's
 guerrillas.
 Armed support from the U.S.  and other free countries
 has been furnished only where either a Communist
 insurrection was staged from the outside ( as in South
 Vietnam ), where an originally non-Ccmzm nist upheaval
 was '..being infiltrated by Communists ( as in Santo
 Domingo ) or where a non-Communist rebellion assumed
 dangerous proportions thanks to Communist arms shipment
 training and other military support ( as in the Congo )
 The comparison  of basic political and economic
 conditions in these countries with those that prevailed
 in old China is entirely meaningless, as even a cursory
 examination of the pertinent facts will show.

 The countryside,          and   the
 countryside alone,        can pro-

 from  which  the  revolution-

 victory.   Precisely      for  this
 reason,  Comrade          Mao  Tse-

 revolutionary base areas in
 the rural  districts and  en-

 Taking the entire globe, if
 North America and Western
 Europe can be called "the
 cities of the world," then
 Asia, Africa and Latin Amer-

 of the world."
 Since World War II, the pro-

 also presents a picture of the
 encirclement of cities by the
 rural areas.

 " The countryside, and  the countryside alone, can

 implicit confession   a the  ommunists :
 ( Chinese or
 otherwise ) have been unable to follow the teachings of
 MARX and LENIN who taught that the proletariat -- i.e.
 the industrial workers in capitalist enterprises -- are
 the hard core and the true leaders of the Communist
 revolution.
 Calling Western Europe and North America "the cities
 of the world", while Asia, Africa and Latin America
 constitute "the rural areas of the world", is a grossly
 misleading comparison, again demonstrating Peking's
 inability of recognizing the realities of the world.
 The comparison means that,''just as the rural areas of
 China I. allegedly  conquered the cities of China,
 the rural areas of the world will conquer the cities of
 the world, thus completing world conquest by the
 Communists.  However, the  cities of China depended
 upon their agrarian hinterland for food and agrarian
 raw materials, whereas Western Europe and North America
 are not only self-supporting in food and agrarian
 products, but are even exporting vast surpluses to the
 socalled "rural areas of the world", including the
 many millions of tons of grains, shipped from the West
 to China, the Soviet Union and other Communist
 countries, unable to feed their unhappy subjects.
 The author's comparison of the rural areas and the
 cities of the world is wrong for other reasons, too --
 for instance, large parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
 America can certainly not be compared with pre-Mao
 China.

 countries, where, according to MARX and LENIN, the

 show very little revolutionary unrest -- the U.S.,
 Britain, West Germany and Canada none at all.  Second,

 the national-democratic revo-
 lution              of  the  colonial and
 semi-colonial countries of the
 East. The Chinese revolution
 has successfully solved the
 problem of how to link up the
 national democratic with So-
 cialist revolution in the colo-
 nial and semi-colonial coun-
 tries.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung has
 pointed  out  that,  in  the
 epoch since the October Rev-
 olution, anti-imperialist revo-
 lution in any colonial or semi-
 colonial country is no longer
 part of the old bourgeois, or
 capitalist  world  revolution,
 but is part of the new world
 revolution, the   proletarian-
 Socialist world revolution.
 Comrade Mao Tse-tung has
 formulated  a  complete the-
 ory                of the new democratic
 revolution. He indicated that
 this revolution, which is dif-
 ferent from all others, can only
 be, nay must be, a revolution
 against imperialism, feudalism
 and   bureaucrat   capitalism
 waged by the broad masses
 of Lhe people unde the leader-
 ship of the proletariat.
 This means that the revo-
 lution can only be, nay must
 be, led by the proletariat and
 the  genuinely  revolutionary
 party armed with Marxism-
 Leninism, and by no other
 class or party.
 This means that the revolu-
 tion embraces in its ranks not
 only the workers, peasants,
 the urban petit bourgeoisie,
 but also the national bour-
 geoisie and other patriotic and
 anti-imperialist democrats.
 This means, finally, that the
 revolutions directed against
 imperialism, feudalism and
 bureaucrat capitalism.
 The new democratic revolu-
 tion leads to Socialism, and
 not to capitalism.
 Comrade  Mae  Tse-tung's
 theory of the new democratic
 inist theory of uninterrupted
 revolution.
 Comrade  Mao  Tse - tung
 made a correct distinction be-
 tween the two revolutionary
 stages, i.e., the national-dem-
 ocratic and the Socialist revo-
 lutions, and he correctly and
 closely linked the two. The na-
 tional - democratic  revolution
 is the necessary preparation
 for the Socialist revolution,
 and the Socialist revolution is
 the inevitable sequel to the
 .national - democratic revolu-
 tion.
 There is no great wall be-
 tween the two revolutionary
 stages. But the Socialist rev-
 olution is only possible after
 the completion of the nation-

 The experience of the Chi-

 tasks of the national-demo-
 cratic revolution can be ful-
 filled only through long and
 tortuous struggles. In this
 stage of revolution, imperial-
 ism and its lackeys are the
 principal enemy.
 In the struggle against im-

 is necessary to ally all anti-
 imperialist  patriotic  forces,
 including the national bour-

 sonages.
 All those patriotic person-
 ages from among the bour-

 gressive historical role: they
 are  not tolerated  by  im-

 the proletariat.

 " IMPERIALISM " , as understood by everybody but a
 doctrinaire Marxist-Leninist, denotes a regime which
 conquers and subdues foreign lands and peoples, whether
 to enhance its military might, its economic resources
 or to create new settlements for its own population sur-
 plus.  This type of aggressive and war-like regime has
 existed throughout history, since the early days of the
 Sumerian, Egyptian, Persian and Roman empires.  The
 Soviet Union is imperialist -- holding vast areas against
 the wishes of their inhabitants,from the Baltic states
 and Bessarabia, through Central Asia, to the Far East.
 So is Communist China, suppressing large minority
 groups by force, as in Tibet, and coveting even larger
 foreign lands, as shown by the maps in every Chieom
 school textbook, depicting the vast colonial empire of
 the Manchu Emperors as "Chinese".  The imperialism of
 Western Europe has almost reached its end, most
 colonies having been granted independence since 1945.
 U.S. imperialism was always merely "marginal", her
 colonial possessions only a minor fraction of the size
 and population of the mainland.  Since 1945, the Philip-
 pines have been voluntarily granted independence, Hawaii
 voted by plebiscite to become the 5oth State of the U.S.
 and Puerto Rico voted repeatedly in favor of its status
 quo, having been offered free choice.  --  Use of
 "imperialism" in Communist propaganda is therefore
 badly misleading : they hope to be able to use it as

 "  .... imperialism heading for their doom ... Communism
 marching to victory.  "    Even though Marxist-Leninist
 prophesies and forecasts have been repeatedly and often
 disastrously wrong, Communist propaganda still tries
 to impress less experienced audiences with its
 apodictic prognostications.  Long-range forecasts,
 disproved by history, included the allegation that the
 middle classes would disappear, that gigantic trusts
 would swallow all smaller enterprises, that imperia-
 list countries would be ruined when they lost their
 colonies,  and many others.  Tactical prophesies,
 seriously damaging the Communist cause by their
 mistakes, were, for instance :  Stalin's assumption,
 Hitler and  the West would fight to each other's
 destruction, left the USSR unprepared for Hitler's
 onslaught 1y41 ;  a forecast by Soviet economists that
 transition from war to peace economy would "inevitably
 provoke a grave depression in the U.S., misdirected
 Soviet  foreign policy in the first years after the
 war ; the Berlin blockade, the Korean war, the Cuban
 missile crisis and many other Communist setbacks were
 the results of other erroneous forecasts.
 Equating the U.S. with German, Japanese and Italian
 Fascism is more inept than.one would expect from a
 crafty Chicom propagandist.  German Communists helped
 to undermine the Weimar Republic and thus facilitated
 Hitler's rise to power.  Stalin concluded the notorious
 pact which gave Hitler a free hand to launch World
 War Two.  Without billions of dollars worrth of U.S.
 lend-lease aid, of weapons, other military equipuent,
 food and medical supplies, the Soviet Union might
 have never recovered from the consequences of Stalin's
 criminal folly.  Generally,  conditions in ComChina,
 the Soviet Union and other Communist countries
 resemble far more closely those which existed in
 Hitler's Germany than those prevailing in the U.S.
 and throughout most of the free world.

 solely on its nuclear weapons

 Nuclear weapons cannot be

 U.S. imperialism has been
 condemned by the people
 the whole world for its tower-
 ing crime of dropping two
 atomic bombs on Japan. If it
 uses nuclear weapons again,
 it will become isolated in the

 Moreover, the U.S. monop-

 The U. S. aggressors are in
 danger of being swamped in
 the people's war in Vietnam.
 They  are      deeply  worried
 that their defeat in Vietnam
 will lead to a chain reaction.
 They are expanding the war
 in an attempt to save them-
 selves from defeat. But the
 more they expand the war,
 the greater will be the chain
 reaction. The more they es-
 calate the war, the heavier
 will be their fall and the more
 disastrous their defeat.
 The people in other parts
 of the world will see still more
 clearly that U. S. imperial-
 ism can be defeated, and that
 what the Vietnamese people
 can do, they do too.
 History has proved and will
 go on proving that the peo-
 ple's war is the most effective
 weapon against U. S. impe-
 rialism and its lackeys. All
 revolutionary people will learn
 to wage a people's war against
 U.  S.  imperialism   and  its
 lackeys.  They, will take up
 arms, learn to fight battles
 and become skilled in waging
 a people's. war, thought they
 have not done so before.
 U. S.  imperialism,  like a
 mad bull dashing from place
 to place, will finally be burned
 to ashes in the blazing fire
 of the people's wars it has
 provoked by its own actions.
 11  Spiritual Atom Bomb  "  :  Another favorite slogan of
 Chicom propaganda, revealing the abysmal ignorance of
 the realities of the outside world in which Peking
 rulers keep themselves and their subjects.  As noted
 above, weapons alone do not decide wars --  the morale
 of the armed forces ( and of the civilian population ),
 as well as other factors, contribute to the outcome of
 every conflict.  But is the Marshal's arrogant assump-
 tion -- i.e. that the moral, political etc. factors are
 all in favor of Peking or of Communism generally --
 justified ?  Not at all : during World War Two, the
 morale of the Soviet forces, commalded by Mao's"big
 brother" Stalin, was the worst of all major powers,
 especially during the first two years.  Hundreds of
 thousands of Soviet soldiers and officers ( including
 2U generals ) not only surrendered to Hitler's armies,
 but volunteered to fight on Germany's side against
 Stalin's hated tyranny.  At the end of the Korean war,
 more than 20,000 Chican and North Korean Communist
 soldiers refused to return to their Communist homelands,
 whereas only 23 Americans remained on the enemy's side
 ( most of whom, incidentally, reconsidered since ).
 There have already been thousands of Vietcong defectors,
 too.  Where, then, is the "spiritual atom bomb" ?
 It is just another deceptive propaganda trick, designed
 to send millions of other peoples into war.

 The  Khrushchev  revision-
 ists have come to the rescue
 of U.S. imperialism just when
 it is most panic-stricken and
 helpless in its efforts to cope
 with the people's war. Work-
 ing hand in glove with the
 U.S.  imperialists,  they  are
 doing their utmost to spread
 all kinds of arguments against
 the people's war, and where-
 ever  they  can,                      they  are
 scheming to undermine it by
 overt or covert means.
 Russians Denounced
 For Lack of Faith
 The fundamental reason why
 the Khrushchev revisionists
 are opposed to the people's
 war is that they have no faith
 in the masses and are afraid
 of U.S. imperialism, of war
 and of revolution.
 Like all other opportunists,
 they are blind to the power
 of the masses and do not be-
 lieve that the revolutionary
 people are capable of defeat-
 ing imperialism.
 They submit to the nuclear
 blackmail of  the  U.S.  Im-
 perialists and are afraid that,
 if the oppressed peoples and
 nations rise up to fight the
 people's wars or the people of
 Socialist  countries repulse
 U.S.  imperialist aggression,
 U.S. Imperialism. will become
 incensed' they themselves will
 become involved and their
 fond dream of Soviet-U.S. co-
 operation  to  dominate  the
 world will be spoiled.
 Ever since Lenin led the
 Great October Revolution to
 victory, the experience of in-
 numerable revolutionary wars
 has borne out the truth that
 a revolutionary people who
 rise up with only their bare
 hinds at the outset finally
 succeed in defeating the rul-
 g classes who are armed to
 teeth.
 We leave it to the Soviet government and to the CPSU
 leaders to respond to the numerous attacks, slanders
 and distortions this article levels against them.
 However, balanced analysis of this Chiaom document
 requires some comments upon the facts involved. Here t
 the present Moscow leadership, far from having come
 "to the rescue ... of panic-stricken U.S. imperialism",
 has hardened its attitude towards the U.S. in recent
 months.  Moscow has even stooped to personal insults
 against the President of the U.S., to demagogic ex-
 ploitation of the Los Angeles riots and to reducing
 cultural exchanges with the U.S. --  risking new
 tensions between the two big powers, primarily
 because the rulers of the Kremlin seem to believe
 k very much to their own disadvantage ) that they must
 take the side of the Vietcong aggressors -- even though
 the war in Vietnam helps only their Chinese rivals.
 Unfortunately,  the Soviet leadership continues to
 cling to concepts of "world-wide Communist solidarity"
 which the Soviet Union has actually long outgrown and
 which have ceased to be a firm basis for Moscow's
 foreign relations -- including relations with foreign
 Communist Parties.
 Moscow is hardly less reckless than China in stirring
 up -- or supporting -- conflicts and insurrections, as
 demonstrated in the Cuban missile crisis, in Soviet
 arms shipments to the Congo rebels, to Cyprus and
 other crisis areas.  It is hard to see what Peking
 means by accusing the Soviets of "opposing people's
 wars".  On the contrary, it is known that Soviet arms
 shipments for Vietnam encountered major Chicom
 obstacles and delays.
 The October Revolution was by no means an uprising
 "with bare hands" , but undertaken by a Bolshevik
 paramilitary organization t led by unperson Trotsky ),
 supported by major disaffected Army and Navy units --
 and could never have won, if the Tsarist regime, its
 armed forces and its police had not been fatally
 weakened by four years of external warfare against a
 superior enemy, imperial Germany, first.

 In a way that runs counter

 The Khrushchev revisionists
 insist that a nation without
 nuclear weapons is incapable
 of defeating an enemy with
 nuclear  weapons,  whatever
 methods of fighting it may
 adopt.
 This is tantamount to say-
 ing that anyone without nu-

 bullied and annihilated, and
 must either capitulate to the
 enemy when confronted with
 his nuclear weapons or come
 under the "protection" of some
 other, nuclear power and sub-
 mit to its beck and call.
 Isn't this the jungle law
 of  survival par excellence ?
 Isn't this helping the impe-
 rialists in their nuclear black-
 mail? Isn't this openly for-
 bidding people to make rev-
 olution ?
 The Khrushchev revisionists
 assert that nuclear weapons
 and strategic rocket units are
 decisive  while  conventional
 forces  are  insignificant, any
 that a militia is just a heal
 of human flesh.
 For ridiculous reasons such
 as these, they oppose the
 mobilization of and reliance
 on the masses in the Socialist
 countries to get prepared to
 Ise the people's war against
 imperialist aggression.
 They have staked the whole
 future of their country on
 nuclear weapons and are en-

 with United States imperial-

 rying to strike a political

 CPYRGHT
 Referring to the Communists and their subversive allies
 and followers as  "  Amateurs  "   is bitter irony -- even
 though not intended by thee author.  Actually, all
 Communist parties -- by no means only the Chinese --
 have developed subversion and guerrilla warfare to a
 complex art and science, to which they have devoted
 years of studies, innumerable books, pamphlets and
 articles and which they are teaching in a vast complex
 of training schools, covering  the globe from Peking to
 Zanzibar and from Moscow to Cuba.
 " An.  ne  without nuclear weapons is destined to come
 to grief ....   "     -- not at all, unless he follows
 irresponsible advice and starts a war with a
 nuclear power.  Experience of 20 years of the nuclear
 age has clearly shown that the "balance of terror"
 between the big nuclear powers grants even smaller
 nations a freedom of political and diplomatic action
 which they may not have possessed prior to World War
 Two.  The conclusions the author pretends to derive
 from Moscow's somewhat more realistic stand on nuclear
 warfare are therefore unproven and irrelevant.
 The masses of CasnChina are already mobilized in a huge
 "Liberation Army'" and even more numerous militia units.
 The true meaning of this passage is therefore a demand
 that Moscow should commit its military forces to fight
 China's wars.

 The Khrushchev revisionists
 maintain that a single spark
 in any part of the globe may
 touch  off  a  world  nuclear
 conflagration   and     bring
 destruction  to mankind.   If
 this  were  true, our  planet
 would    have  been destroyed
 time and time again.
 There have been wars of
 national liberation through-
 out the 20 years since World
 War H. But has any single
 one of them developed into
 a World War? Isn't it true
 that the United States im-
 perialists' plans for a World
 War have been upset pre-
 cisely thanks to the wars of
 national liberation in Asia,
 Africa and Latin America?
 By contrast, those who have
 done their utmost to stamp
 out the "sparks" of people's
 war have in fact encouraged
 U. S. imperialism in its ag-
 gressions and wars.
 The  Khrushchev  revision-
 ists claim that if their gen-
 eral line of  "peaceful, co-
 existence, peaceful transition
 and peaceful competition" is
 followed, the oppressed will.
 be liberated and "a world
 without   weapons,   without
 armed  forces  and   without
 wars" will come into being.
 But the inexorable fact is
 that imperialism and reaction
 headed by the United States
 are zealously priming  their
 war machine and are daily
 engaged in sanguinary sup-
 pression of the revolutionary
 peoples and in the threat and
 use of armed force against
 independent countries.
 The kind of rubbish ped-
 dled by the Khrushchev re-
 visionists has "already taken
 a  great  toll  of  lives  in  a
 number    of    countries.  Are
 these  painful  lessons,   paid
 for   in  blood,    still insuf-
 ficient ?
 The essence of. the general
 line of the Khrushchev  re-
 vionists                      is    nothing other
 than the demand that all the
 oppressed peoples and nations
 and  all  the   countries that
 have      won  independence
 should lay down their ar is
 and place "themselves at the
 mercy of he U. S. imperial-
 ists and their lackeys who
 are armed to the teeth.
 The author scoffs at the thought that  " ... a single
 spark ... may touch off a world nuclear conflagration",
 noting that none of  the conflicts of the   st 2U years
 have led to nuclear war.  This is certainly the most
 criminally irresponsible gamble with the lives of
 hundreds of millions of human beings.  Invention of
 the nuclear weapons dates back only 20 years and the
 memories of World War Two are still too vivid in most
 major nations i outside China ) to encourage a new
 global conflict.  But this offers no assurance whatso-
 ever for the future, especially if madmen like the
 Peking leaders circle the globe -- with or-:,without
 nuclear devices of their own -- , looking for new
 conflicts to provoke.  Most wars of the past, including
 the first two World wars and the Korean War, erupted
 because of miscalculations, lack of information and
 accidents on one or both sides.  This holds true of
 future conflicts as well.
 "   ....   Already taken a great toll of lives in a number
 of countries ".  Whose lives is the Marshal charging
 against Moscow ? Hardly the tens of thousands of
 Hungarians, killed when the Soviet Army quelled the
 Budapest uprising 1)56, or the hundreds of East Germans,
 "pacified" by Soviet tanks 1953.  Or does he refer to
 Vietcong casualties which might have been avoided if
 the Soviets had sent more military aid earlier ? i. But,
 as noted above, China impeded such aid th ipments )
 Apparently,  this passage has no meaning at all : it is
 "pure" Chicom propaganda, not blemished by any facts.
 Far from having urged any nations to "lay down their
 arms", it was Moscow rather than Peking which furnished
 weapons, including submarines, jet bombers and guided
 missiles to numerous countries unfriendly to the U.S.,
 from Cuba via Egypt and Iraq to Peking's faithful ally,
 Indonesia.  What, then, does  the Marshal want ?

 w nue. magistrates are al-
 lowed to burn down houses,
 the common people are for-
 bidden even to light lamps."
 Such is the way of the im-
 perialists and reactionaries.
 Subscribing to this imperial-
 ist philosophy, the Khrush-
 chev revisionists shout that
 the Chinese people standing
 in the forefront of the fight
 for world peace:
 "You are bellicose!"
 Gentlemen,   your   abuse
 adds to our credit. It is this
 very  "bellicosity"  of ours
 that helps to prevent impe-
 rialism  from                     unleashing a
 world war. The people are
 "bellicose" because they have
 to defend themselves and be-
 cause the imperialists and re-
 actionaries force them to be
 so.
 It is also the imperialists
 and reactionaries who have
 taught the people the arts
 of war. We are simply us-
 ing revolutionary "bellicosi-
 ty" to cope with counter-
 revolutionary bellicosity.
 How can it be argued that
 the  imperialists  and  their
 lackeys may kill people ev-
 erywhere,                          while  the people
 must not strike back in self-
 defense or help one another?
 What kind of logic is this?
 The         Khrushchev  revi-
 sionists regard                        imperialists
 like Kennedy and Johnson
 as "sensible" and describe us
 together with all those who
 dare to carry out armed de-
 fense against imperialist ag-
 gression as "bellicose." This
 has revealed.the Khrushchev
 revisionists in their true col-
 ors as the accomplices of im-
 perialist gangsters.
 War Is `Great School'
 To Temper People
 We know that war brings
 destruction, sacrifice and suf-
 fering on the people. But the
 destruction, sacrifice and suf-
 fering will be much greater
 if no resistance is offered to
 imperialist armed aggression
 and the people become willing
 slaves.
 The sacrifice  of a small
 number of people in revolu-
 tionary wars is repaid by se-
 curity  for.                    whole  nations,
 whole countries and even the
 whole of mankind; temporary
 suffering is repaid by lasting
 or even perpetual peace and
 happiness.
 War can temper the people
 and push history forward. In
 this sense, war is a great
 school.
 In diametrical opposition to
 the Khrushchev revisionists,
 the   Marxist-Leninists   and
 revolutionary  people   never
 take a gloomy view of war.

 Chinese Communists have never given their own people,

 certain that a large majority in both South and North
 Vietnam would vote for the Vietcong, their Chinese
 commissars and their Soviet weapons to leave, certain
 that this would also result in a withdrawal of U.S.
 forces.  There are some regions in the world where
 masses favor war -- but not for the reasons preferred
 by Peking, rather for deep-seated racial/ethnic
 enmities, as the conflict between Arabs and Israel, or
 between India and Pakistan.  Peking profits from all
 conflicts at least indirectly, even if they spring
 from causes alien to Chieom doctrine.

 To win the struggle against
 United States imperialism and
 carry  the  people's  wars to
 victory, the Marxist-Leninists
 and    revolutionary  people
 throughout  the world   must
 resolutely oppose Khrushchev
 revisionism.
 Today,   Khrushchev   re-

 audience among the revolu-

 Wherever there  is  armed
 aggression and suppression by
 imperialism and its lackeys,
 there are bound to be people's
 wars against aggression and
 oppression. It is certain that
 such wars will develop vigor-
 ously. This is an objective law
 independent  of  the  will  of
 either the United States im-
 perialists or the Khrushchev
 revisionists.
 The revolutionary people of
 the world will sweep away
 everything that stands in the
 way of their advance. Khrush-
 chev is finished. And the suc-
 cessors  to  Khrushchev  re-
 visionism will fare no better.
 The imperialists, the reac-
 tionaries and the Khrushchev
 revisionists, who have all set
 themselves against people's
 war, will be swept like dust
 from the stage of history by
 the  mighty broom  of the
 revolutionary people.
 Great changes have taken
 place in China and the world
 in  the  20  years since the
 victory of the war of resist-
 ance against Japan, changes
 that have made the situation
 more favorable than ever for
 the  revolutionary people of
 the world and more unfavor-
 able than ever for Imperial-
 ism and its lackeys.
 When Japanese imperialism
 launched its war of aggres-
 sion against China, the Chi-
 nese people had only a very
 small  people's  army  and  a
 very small revolutionary base.
 And they were up against the
 biggest military despot of the
 East. Yet even then, Comrade
 Mao Tse-tung said that the
 Chinese  people's  war  could
 be won and that Japanese im-
 perialism could be defeated.

 Peking Vows to Support
 Vietcong Until Victory
 The struggle of the Viet-
 namese people  against U.S.
 aggression and for national
 salvation is now the focus of
 the struggle of the people of
 the world against U.S. ag-
 gression.
 The  determination  of  the
 Chinese people to support and
 aid the Vietnamese people in
 their  struggle  against U.S.
 aggression and for national
 salvation is unshakable. No
 matter what U.S. imperialism
 may do to expand its war
 adventure,  the Chinese peo-
 ple will do everything in their
 power to support 'the Viet-
 namese                         people until  every
 single one of the U.S. ag-
 gressors  is  driven  out                         of
 Vietnam.
 " U.S. imperialism ... is suffering one defeat after
 another '  Where, comrade Marshal ?  We are far from
 desiring to paint an over-optimistic picture of free
 world victories or to underestimate the threat of
 Communist aggression.  Nevertheless, we can hardly view
 the collapse of Stalin's blockade of Berlin, the
 frustration of Communist aggression in Korea, or
 Khrushchev's forced withdrawal of his nuclear missiles
 from Cuba as U.S. defeats.  And the outcome of Vietnam
 remains yet to be seen, even though we realize  that
 Mao & Co are determined to fight to the very last
 Vietnamese.
 Finally, this long-winded article reveals its true
 purposes :  first of all, it is to suppress any ideas
 in North Vietnam or among the Vietcong in South Vietnam
 that the conflict might be ended by negotiations ;
 second, as additional insurance against possible
 "weakening"of the Vietnamese  t who have had centuries
 of tragic experience under the overlordship of
 Imperial China ), to stir up subversion and insurreetial
 in as marry other countries as possible.  The Chicoms
 do not insist that Vietnamese alone the for the greater
 glory of Mao : they are equally willing   to accept the
 sacrifices of other peoples,  without regard to race,
 nationality or geographic location.

 The U.S. imperialists are
 now clamoring for another
 trial of strength with the
 Chinese people, for another
 large-scale ground war on the
 Asian mainland.
 If they insist on following
 in the footsteps of the Japa-
 nese Fascists, well then, they
 may do so, if they please. The
 Chinese people definitely have
 ways of their own for copin>r
 with a U.S. imperialist war
 of aggression.
 Our methods are no secret.
 The most important one is
 still mobilization of the peo-
 ple, reliance on the people,
 making every one a soldier
 and waging a people's war.
 We want to tell the U6.
 imperialists once again that
 the vast ocean of several
 hundred    million    Chinese
 people in arms will be more
 then enough to submerge your
 few million aggressive troops.
 If you dare to impose war
 on us, we shall gain freedom
 of action. It will then not be
 up to you to decide how the
 war will be fought. We shall
 fight in the ways most ad-
 vantageous to us to destroy
 the enemy and wherever the
 enemy can be most es.  de-
 stroyed.
 Since the Chinese people
 were able to destroy the Ja-
 panese aggressors 20 years
 ago, they are certainly still
 more capable of finishing off
 the U.S. aggressors today.
 The naval and air superior-
 ity you boast about cannot
 intimidate the Chinese people
 and neither can the atom bomb
 you brandish at us.
 If you want to send troops,
 go ahead. The more the bet-
 ter.  We  will  annihilate  as
 many as you can send, and
 can even give you receipts.
 The Chinese people are a
 great, valiant people. We have
 the courage to shoulder the
 heavy burden  of  combating
 U. S. Imperialism and to con-
 tribute our share in the strug-
 gle for final victory over this
 most ferocious enemy of the
 people of the world.
 It must be pointed out in
 all seriousness that after the
 victor of the war of resist-
 ance, Taiwan was returned to
 China.  The  occupation  of
 Taiwan by U.S. imperialism
 is absolutely unjustified. Tai-
 wan Province is an inalien.
 able part of Chinese territory.
 The U. S. imperialists must
 get  out  of  Taiwan.  The
 Chinese people are determined
 to liberate Taiwan.
 " The vast ocean of several hundred million Chinese
 people in arms ... "  The Korean war has shown that the
 Chican leaders, after having exhausted their foreign
 vassals k China intervened in Korea only after the
 North Korean army had been decisively defeated ), are
 sacrificing the lives of their own subjects just as
 recklessly as the lives of others.  However, what is    Alk
 the potential of  such "human assault waves" against
 naval or air power, not to mention nuclear weapons ?
 In 1945P., when Mao's masses swept the China mainland,
 they were unable to cross  the narrow Formosa Straits
 --  just as Hitler's tremendous land armies never
 managed to cross the English Channel.  The Marshal
 discusses here types of warfare he has never experien-
 ced : he is presumably too arrogant to learn from the
 experiences of other nations, including the Soviet
 Union.
 " If you want to send troops, go ahead.  The more the
 better.  We will annihilate as many as you can send,
 and can even give you recei  s. it   This cynic   in-
 vi a  on to mass slaughter reveals clearly what
 "socialist humanism" truly is.  If anybody should still
 not understand what the U.S. mission in Vietnam is,
 here is his answer : to protect the non-Communist
 majority of the Vietnamese people against grisly "jokers"
 like this.  Note the sly reference to "receipts",
 presumably the Chicoin way of alluding to capitalist
 greed who treats even the dead bodies of soldiers as
 merchandise to be receipted for.

 In commemorating the 20th
 anniversary of victory in the
 war  of  resistance  against
 Japan, we must also point out
 in all solemnity that the Jap-
 anese militarists fostered by
 U. S. imperialism will certain-
 ly receive still severer punish-
 ment if they ignore the firm
 opposition  of  the  Japanese
 people and the people of Asia,
 again indulge in their pipe-
 dreams.
 U.S. imperialism is prepar-
 ing a world war. But can this
 save it from its doom? World
 War I was followed by the
 birth of the Socialist Soviet
 Union. World War II was fol-
 lowed by the emergence of a
 series  of  Socialist. countries
 and many nationally independ-
 ent countries.
 If     the  U.S.  imperialists
 should insist on launching a
 third world war,  it can be
 stated   categorically that
 many more hundreds of mil-
 lions of people will turn to
 Socialism;  the   imperialists
 will  then  have  little  room
 left on the globe; and it is
 possible that the whole struc-
 lapse.
 We are optimistic about the
 future of the world. We are
 confident that the people will
 bring to an end the epoch
 wars in human history.
 Comrade   Mao   Tse-tung
 pointed  out long ago  that
 war,  this monster, "will be
 finally eliminated by the pro-
 gress pf human society. And
 in the not too distant future,
 too.  But  there is only one
 way to eliminate it and that
 is to oppose war with war, to
 oppose  counter-revolutionary
 war with revolutionary war."
 All peoples suffering from
 U.S.  imperialist aggression,
 oppression and plunder. unite!
 Hold aloft the just banner
 of people's war and fight for
 the cause of world peace, na-
 tional liberation. people's de.
 Victory will certainly go to
 the people of the world!
 Long  live  the  victory  of
 people's war!
 This prophecy -- that, because World Wars I and II
 led to establishment of Communist regimes, World War
 III would mean the ultimate doom of imperialism and
 world-wide Communist victory-  is a boomerang : it
 implies that Communism needs devastating wars to
 seize and to expand its power ~ as indeed it does ).
 The leaders of the 81 Communist Parties, including the
 Chinese, in their already quoted Statement, were more
 far-sighted than the Marshal when they rejected this
 assumption :
 It  The imperialist reactionaries, who seek to arouse
 distrust for the Communist movement and its
 ideology, continue to intimidate the masses by
 alleging that Communists need wars between states
 to overthrow the capitalist system and establish
 a socialist system.
 If  The Communist parties emphatically reject this
 slander.  The fact that both World Wars, which
 were started by the imperialists, ended in
 socialist revolutions by no means implies that the
 way to social revolution goes necessarily through
 world war, especially now that there exists a
 powerful world  system of socialism.  Marxists-
 Leninists have never considered that the way to
 social revolution lies  through wars between
 states.  11
 We don't have to "slander" Communism any more.   The
 Marshal has obliged us with any proof still needed.
 He obviously has not as much confidence in the "world
 system of socialism" k which, of course, includes the
 "Khrushchev revisionists" ) as was professed by the
 party leaders who drafted and accepted the above
 statement.

 and sub-caps:  Planning, Prague's view of the re-
 forms -- The Czechs have gone further than the
 other Socialist countries in various respects --
 New events in the struggle against dogmatism --
 From our own correspondent, Prague, 30 Jul 65.]
 After spending a month in Moscow studying up on the changes being
 prepared for the Soviet economic system and the political repercussions
 such changes may bring about, I came to Prague to study the same ques-
 tions here And'I:have now been here for a week.   Czechoslovakia stands
 in the forefront in the discussions going on in almost all European
 Socialist countries on the subject of new trends in the economy.  As
 seen from Moscow, happenings in Czechoslovakia are taking on what seems
 to be the outlines of a deep, drastic reform, though none would go so
 far as to call it a wild adventure.  From Moscow's viewpoint these
 changes may even be a bit too radical and should be looked upon with a
 certain degree of caution and be judged accordingly.   Seen from Prague,
 though, these events take on a different perspective but without losing
 any of their interest.   In a certain way the impression one gets from
 Moscow still remains true but at the same time it becomes more compli-
 cated, takes on additional nuances and so becomes transformed into what
 amounts to a deeper insight into an intricate process wherein different
 trends and factors combine and conflict with one another in such a way
 that nobody can safely predict any final, sure outcome.
 Undoubtedly there are certain points where the Czechoslovaks have
 gone further today than any of the other Socialist countries.   This is
 not just a matter of opinion but one of actual fact.  And this is what
 makes discussions among the Czechoslovaks and their own experiences of
 so much interest.   They have gone further than the other countries in
 their theoretical formulation of their new trend, explicitly maintain-
 ing that it is necessary to combine the principle of planning with the
 mechanism of the market.   They have also gone further in working out
 a set of corresponding principles having a systematic nature of their
 own; the putting of such principles into general practice would bring

 about a substantial modification of the way in which the Czechoslovak
 economy operates.   They have also gone further in defining these trends
 in black and white because ever since January (1965) there has been a
 resolution on the books approved by the Party's Central Committee in
 plenary session, specifying how the new system is to go into operation
 as of 1 Jan 66 after one year of experimentation on a pilot scale, but
 involving a large enough sector of the economy (one hundred important
 enterprises representing one fourth of the country's industrial output)
 to be something more than just a pilot operation.
 But when one starts to investigate just what will undergo any con-
 crete change after 1 Jan 66, one finds that these general principles
 are being applied in Czechoslovakia with a generous dose of caution.
 First of all provision is made for a transitional period during which
 both the old and the new methods of planning and administration will
 continue to coexist side by side, though the older methods are to pro-
 gressively lose ground while the newer ones gradually take over.   It
 is hard to say how long such a transitional period could last.   It is
 calculated that it will take three years but four years are not ruled
 out and it could even take longer.   This is particularly true of the
 new price system (built around three categories of prices -- unre-
 stricted prices, ceiling prices and fixed prices -- in all cases cal-
 culated in such a way as to ensure that the producer will be remunerated
 for his products since he is working to satisfy a real market (demand);
 this price system is to some extent the mainspring of the new trend.
 One can find the same caution being practiced with respect to every
 other feature of the reform,   There is no point in taking them all up
 here one by one.   The new system is already generally known in its broad
 outline.   It has been discussed again and again and in Italy, too, where
 in particular Professor Sik, one of its originators, went to discuss it
 in a series of conferences held this spring (1965).   Its main features
 are direct relations among enterprises, planning which outlines only the
 more important features of national economic development, a heavy decen-
 tralization of investments, broad autonomy of decision for groups of
 enterprises and a rate of pay depending largely on the efficiency of
 the enterprise in which one works,  Added to this is a kind of contract
 with the foreign market, including the markets of the capitalist West,
 capable of subjecting Czech enterprises to the stimulation offered by
 heightened competition.
 All of this is a future goal, a long-range one, even though it is
 all spelled out so clearly (and this is where Czechoslovakia has its
 advantage). In the case of the more immediate, short-range future, the
 new Five-Year Plan (1966-1970) has largely been already predetermined
 in advance by a series of previous investments, by the work already done
 on large construction jobs which have to be finished and by the need to
 avoid upsetting overnight a giant productive apparatus which cannot be

 ground to a halt and made to stand still while changes are being decided
 upon.  Each one of the new principles, then, is only being put into
 partial application.   If one also bears in mind the fact that these prin-
 ciples are in turn a watered-down version of proposals of an even more
 radical nature, then one may better understand why it is legitimate to
 speak of such changes as cautious at this point.
 Nevertheless, taken as a whole, one cannot help but consider the
 Czechoslovak reform to be anything else but a daring move.  As original
 and interesting as the intrinsic features of this move may be, there is
 more to it than that.  What also matters is the general atmosphere with-
 in the country where such a reform has been brought to light.   Even just
 a few years ago -- four or five years ago, let's say -- Czechoslovakia
 could have seemed to be a socialist country willing to tighten its belt
 again and again, the good economic situation then existing being accom-
 panied by a complete lack of interest in political and ideological dis-
 cussion.  Now the tables have turned.   The economic situation is no
 longer so bright.  But discussion and debate on matters of culture and
 politics have sprung up stronger than anywhere else and have gone deeper
 to the root of matters than elsewhere too, perhaps.
 The economic reform we are talking about is being presented as an
 important event in the struggle against Stalinism or, to be more exact,
 against the straight-jacketing of economic thought which was typical of
 the "cult of personality" and one need only refer to the latest edition
 of the international magazine, Problemi della pace e del Socialismo
 (Problems of Peace and Socialism) to find an example of this.   There
 was a time covering several years after the 20th Congress of the CPSU
 when it seemed as if the anti-Stalinist counteroffensive or as one more
 often says here, the anti-dogmatic counteroffensive, would never have
 any effect in Czechoslovakia other than of a very limited variety.  Now
 it has really started here later than it did elsewhere but it has made
 up for its late arrival by making deeper inroads and by taking a more
 original form.
 The rehabilitation of the victims of the Stalinist period was later
 doming in Czechoslovakia, but when it did it took the form of public
 trials.   The cultural discussions have started out more moderately and
 cautiously but the spirit of free discussion has gradually gained a more
 solid foothold.   Nobody could be surprised nowadays at the fact that old
 cubist paintings are being shown on exhibit in Prague.   There are ex-
 hibits following all the different trends, a thing one could not even
 imagine as happening in Moscow at the present time.  When Khrushchev and
 Ilichov were publicly attacking the Soviet intelligentsia in 1963 there
 was not even one official declaration in Prague supporting their state-
 ments.   In Czech theatre today the types of plays which predominate are
 the satirical ones along with those of a more formal kind dealing with
 serious subjects.   None of all this means that the problems of cultural

 life have been solved once and for all for everybody.   It does mean,
 though, that where such problems have not been solved there is, in any
 case, a spirit of struggle with the cultural disciplines coming to the
 fore and asserting their role as vehicles of research and discovery.
 The new Czechoslovak motion-picture art was born out of this atmosphere
 and over the past two or three years their entries in film festivals
 have been a welcome revelation and certainly represent one of the most
 interesting artistic manifestations we have been able to glean in recent
 years from the Socialist countries.
 These Czechoslovak motion pictures really deserve to be given a
 detailed analysis but that would be outside my field.   Others have al-
 ready discussed them and will continue to do so.   I would only like to
 note that one of the themes which gives them their strength is that of
 individual responsibility, moral responsibility and civic duty, aside
 and apart from any collective responsibility of any kind whatever.
 This theme has struck a new chord.   It would seem to me to be not at
 all arbitrary to tie it in with the content of the economic reform
 about to go into effect.  This new reform not only aims at putting a
 whole set of ideas and incentives into action again in the economy --
 ideas and incentives that had previously been declared outmoded -- but
 which now appear necessary to the economy's efficient operation; it
 goes further in that it aims at reawakening the spirit of initiative
 and responsibility of the individual producer and of groups of pro-
 ducers, stimulating their direct interests.   In order that it may be
 applied with success there must first be a profound change in people's
 ideas (an evolution of their spirits); it actually calls for that very
 reawakening of individual dedication which the "cult" succeeded in suf-
 focating in the past, the very spirit which was bound to turn out to be
 more important and valuable to Socialism than ever in the final analysis.

 One of the most important points in the history of these recent
 years and perhaps the most important for an understanding of the evolu-
 tionary change taking place in the Socialist countries is how the new
 reform to be introduced into the Czechoslovak economy starting 1 Jan 66
 was arrived at.   The decision to go through with it, made by the Party's
 Central Committee in January, this year (1965), laying down the broad
 outline of the reform, was not a hasty one.  Nor was it the result of
 any change in the country's top leadership,  The reform is the outcome

 to an end.   The process involved a struggle of ideas which had both its
 high points and its low points, a pressure exerted by the fact that the
 Czechoslovak economy is a unique one having few parallels and a certain
 type of political infighting.
 The first discussions go back to 1956 during the months immediately
 following the 20th Congress of the CPSU and they are related t6 similar
 discussions which took place in Poland on the subject of what should be
 the "model" of economic development for the country.   It was already felt
 that the path of industrialization followed by the Soviet Union could not
 be imitated for too long a time in a country already as far developed as
 Czechoslovakia.   It took some time, though, before any modifications were
 worked out; these did not make any appearance until as late as 1958.  For
 the first time the concept of "effectiveness" was introduced into economic
 policy, while there was an expansion of the profit motive at enterprise
 level and an attempt was made to find more subtle criteria for evaluating
 plan fulfillment other than mere quantitative ones and a start was made
 towards regulating the activities of individual enterprises from above by
 means of fixed standards leaving room for a certain margin of autonomy or
 leeway instead of resorting to a series of administrative rules and.instruc-
 tions to deal with each individual case.
 This timid attempt had very little success because two years later in
 the face of a combination of difficulties on both the international and
 domestic scenes it was quietly buried in actual practice.  This first epi-
 sode explains the reason why there was no great amount of real enthusiasm
 until the new reforms had actually gone into operation; it was necessary
 to wait and see first of all what real consequences they would have in
 actual practice.
 Promptly afterwards there was a sharp brush with reality.   The Czech-
 oslovak economy went through what cannot be called anything else but a
 crisis in the years 1962 and 1963.  After a year of stagnation there was
 a genuine recession in 1963; the national income dropped 2.4 per cent; in-
 dustrial production decreased 0.6 per cent and investments by 11 per cent.
 The third five-year plan, initiated in 1961, had to be given up.   Ever
 since then Czechoslovakia has been governed only by more moderate plans
 worked out from one year to the next.
 In the meanwhile discussions flared up again.   The debate on Liber-
 man's,proposals which started in Moscow in 1962 served to give these dis-
 cussions impetus.   But in Czechoslovakia things took a different turn and
 followed a path independent of the Soviet.  While the discussions in Moscow
 became bogged down for some time, in Prague they developed, became more far-
 reaching and quickly arrived at certain conclusions, gaining adherents in
 top policy-making posts.
 The debate took on an openly controversial character in the press. The
 new points called for a change in the criteria used in the system of plan-
 ning, itself, as well as in administration as practiced up to that time so
 more leeway would be given to the interplay of the market-place.  The op-
 ponents of these ideas, rallying around Rozsipal, a former vice-president
 of the Gosplan who editorialized on the subject in articles in Rude Pravo

 Communist Party, asserted instead that the most urgent task was to
 correct the serious imbalances appearing in the Czechoslovak economy
 and that these corrections had to be made using the traditional meth-
 ods of strongly centralized administrative fiat.  Professor Sik stated
 on the contrary that the imbalances were the result of the system cur-
 rently in force and that if the system were not changed the imbalances
 would continue to occur over and over again.  We in the West therefore
 have a tendency to look upon Sik as the one who created the reform now
 planned; here in Prague the matter is seen in a more complex light.
 Sik, as a member of the Party's Central Committee and as director of
 the Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences, was the most out-
 standing individual but he was only one of a number of economists who
 had carried on the battle in the press.   It is therefore only right
 that a few others be named, for example, Komeda and Kozusnik who are
 two research men belonging to the same team who with both their theo-
 retical writing and their articles did much to contribute to the vic-
 tory of the new principles,
 When the discussion was taken up in a political context Sik was
 appointed by the Party leadership to head up a commission of fifteen
 theoretical and practical specialists who were supposed to draw up the
 new proposals.  During this second stage of the debate the ideas origi-
 nally discussed in the press underwent some retouching and correction.
 It thus became a plan which had already been made over and remade over
 by many different architects when it was finally approved by the Cen-
 tral Committee in January; before it has been completed in all its de-
 tails it will also have to pass through additional hands and then it
 will have to be put into practice.
 The search for a new system in January was in any case one point
 in the country's favor.   The objective reasons were such as to out-
 weigh every opposing opinion; the Czechoslovak economy needs new ad-
 ministrative criteria.   The characteristic features of this country
 always have been and still are very different from those of all the
 other Socialist countries.   Its economy was highly industrialized from
 the very start.  Even though its natural resources and manpower re-
 serves were poor, it had advanced traditions of technical progress.
 The lion's share of industrial production went to the export trade.
 The planning criteria followed for Socialist industrialization of the
 USSR -- that is, of a country which had diametrically opposite charac-
 teristics -- could not be long applied to Czechoslovakia without bring-
 ing about unfavorable results.   It is interesting to note how today's
 Czech economists, when looking for some affinity with Soviet economic
 thought, are more inclined to find it in the 20's when it was still
 possible to compare all the possible alternatives in the USSR rather
 than during the period of Stalinist planning when only one version was
 imposed from the top down.   If the Soviet model was imitated again
 after 1948 it was only because none other was known of and because the
 Stalinist policy did not make allowance for any other and also because

 as a first step right after the war it was able to offer a solution
 to certain structural problems of the Czechoslovak economy, for ex-
 ample, the industrialization of Slovakia, the alignment with the
 developing economies in the other Socialist countries and guarantees
 of a certain minimum standard of living and social security for all.
 On being prolonged beyond its first few years, though, it created
 a series of problems, imbalances, delays, etc. which gradually wors-
 ened until they became obvious to all in the 1962-63 crisis which still
 cannot be said to be completely overcome even today.   The strength of
 the new principles lies in the fact that they point to a way out of
 these contradictions.
 As reports from Moscow tell us the old model has also found itself
 in trouble in the USSR, too, in the meanwhile and these difficulties be-
 came increasingly clear as the USSR gradually succeeded in drawing away
 from the stage of de-Stalinization.   It would seem, then, that the ques-
 tion has been settled for once and for all in Czechoslovakia.   In re-
 ality things are much more complicated.  For many years this very type
 of development has been identified with Socialism itself.  There are
 other less industrially developed countries where such a form of develop-
 ment is even today performing the task of bringing about industrializa-
 tion.  For years and years the political leadership, social life and
 both private and public thinking were formed and developed unformly in
 keeping with such a viewpoint.  All of this needs to be taken into ac-
 count.   Even today in defining the reforms there are those who speak of
 a "new system" and those who speak only of "improvement" of the old;
 both terms are met with sometimes in the same newspaper or in the same
 circles. It is not just a question of words; it is a way of expressing
 different ideas about what must be done from the first of the year on
 afterwards.  At first one could be led to believe that in such cases
 one is dealing with theoreticians who want to bring about the reform on
 one hand and practical men who are unwilling to accept it; but after a
 while it became apparent that the demarcation line cut across those in
 both camps; it is found among administrative personnel, in research in-
 stitutes and among the technical and engineering leadership.   The dis-
 agreement which existed over the past years as to whether to accept or
 reject the principles decided upon in January has now attached itself
 merely to the field of their application.
 Once again the objective thrust is directed against the real prob-
 lems of the Czechoslovak economy; the resistance comes from the mental
 attitude and the superstructure of administrative personnel built up
 and trained during the period of the old type of planning.   The most
 important things at stake both here and in the USSR are both economic
 and political at the same time.

 My Czechoslovak friends set great store by showing me the First In-
 ternational Jewelry Fair at Jablonec.   So one morning I started driving
 towards the town located a short distance from the point where the Polish
 and German Democratic Republic borders converge with those of Czechoslo-
 vakia, in what was once called Sudetenland where in reality World War II
 started with the betrayal of Munich. The beautiful, hilly countryside
 of northern Bohemia, an open invitation to carry a tent in one's car,
 served as a pleasant introduction to my visit.   The fair which awaited
 me at Jablonec is international only because of a limited participation
 by twenty different countries, including Italy.   The predominant part
 of the fair remains Czech. Nevertheless, this alone made my trip worth-
 while,   One of the country's most celebrated architects, Svoboda, the
 same who prepared the beautiful Czechoslovak exhibit at the 1958 World's
 Fair in Burssels, was called upon to give his advice in outfitting the
 exhibition.  He and his coworkers have shown themselves to be capable of
 unlimited imagination and good taste in showing the locally manufactured
 jewelry.  Necklaces, earrings and bracelets were exhibited in what were
 deliberately chosen to be the most unrealistic settings possible, among
 the fish in an aquarium, among the sparrows and nightingales in an im-
 mense aviary, almost lost among the deposits of the roughest, crudest
 ores of the earth, grouped together to make up figures which, by con-
 trast, seemed to have stepped out of an expressionist painting.  Play of
 light and water, mathematically calculated movements and stereotype photo-
 graphs contribute to make the show a successful hit.
 Jablonec jewelry has one specific feature about it; it is fake.   It
 started three centuries ago as the manufacture of substitutes to replace
 the most expensive and authentic precious gems on certain special occa-
 sions.   In short, it is the junk jewelry industry.  Based essentially on
 the use of glass, for which Bohemian glassmakers are famous, the work
 ended up by taking on a value of its own, quite independent of the fea-
 ture of imitating other gems.  Jablonec glass became a rival of gems
 rather than a substitute for them.  At the turn of the century it was
 well known and sought after throughout the world.  After World War I
 there was a downturn in the demand for this kind of work and the fall
 off became steeper after World War II when it seemed as if the products
 of Jablonec could find no place in a Socialist economy,   It is only in
 recent years with a return to favor of world fashions that the fortunes
 of this industry have begun to turn.   The products of Jablonec now make
 up no small part of the Czechoslovak export trade, with 97 per cent of
 the total output being exported to 65 different countries.   In the dis-
 trict of Jablonec alone more than 30,000 persons are employed in the
 amnufacture of jewelry.

 This year's show, the attention given to setting it up and prepar-
 ing it and the interest in showing it to me were all evidence of the
 new battle in which Czechoslovakia is engaged to win a place for itself
 on world markets, above all in the West.   Czechoslovakia is hungry for
 foreign currencies.   This is also seen in the renewed attention being
 given to the "invisible" items of export, for example, to the tourist
 industry.   Prague was relatively full of foreigners this year, swarming
 around Charles Bridge and Hradcany Castle.   Their coming is encouraging
 for a thousand reasons.  Nevertheless there are some serious obstacles
 which inhibit any influx of greater proportions.   In spite of the ab-
 sence of any seacoast, Czechoslovakia is a country which lends itself
 readily to summer vacationing; the countryside is attractive even if
 not varying much from place to place.  The cultural attractions are of
 the highest level at Prague if not elsewhere as it is one of the most
 beautiful cities in all Europe.  The traditions and manners of the coun-
 try are those of open-hearted hospitality.   There is a shortage, though,
 of the equipment needed for modern handling of tourists and that which
 exists is inadequate because long neglected and this includes hotels,
 restaurants, roads and service stations.   Now when attempts are being
 made to fill the gap one sees how far behind these services have fallen
 in the past twenty years.
 In any case the Czechoslovak battle for foreign trade cannot be won
 by Jablonec glass and the tourists who visit Prague alone, no matter how
 important both of these are.   The decisive front is the sector of indus-
 try and, in particular, Czechoslovak machinery; the rest only plays a
 secondary and supporting role.  Given the narrow limits imposed by the
 domestic market, Czechoslovak industry has always worked for foreign
 markets ever since the country has been independent.   But this is the
 very place where one finds the greatest difficulty today.   It is here
 that delays have taken place which threaten to be more costly than the
 shortcomings in the tourist sector.  Ever since 19+7 Czechoslovak exports
 have experienced a sudden about face.   They broke away from Western mar-
 kets and were directed towards the countries of the Socialist camp which
 was then undergoing development towards formation of a bloc.   This politi-
 cal decision has been and still is a matter of conflicting claims and de-
 bate.   I personally believe that it was largely unavoidable.                              The political
 conditions accompanying the Marshall Plan, the splitting of Europe into
 two blocs, the "cold war" and the economic blockade practiced by the West
 left little or no alternative but to go over to the other side politically,
 too.  One can argue, too, about whether such a move was not pushed too
 far beyond the limits of what was necessary; in my opinion if such a move
 was already necessary, then it was not.  But the question of the conse-
 quences arising out of this move is another matter again.
 The Eastern market needed immense quantities of equipment in order
 to become industrialized.   Czechoslovakia was able to supply this market.
 This favored that unilateral and topheavy development of the economy which
 is so harshly criticized by economists today.  Everything was staked on

 heavy industry, on the production of producer goods, building new enter-
 prises alongside the old ones, sometimes at too fast a rate and without
 worrying about technological progress and this was the really unfavor-
 able outcome, the one complained about so loudly today.   This is how
 the country got out of step with the advancing world technology.   In
 many cases Czechoslovak industry is no longer able to compete with the
 industry in the West.   This also begins to have unfavorable reverbera-
 tions on the East's markets, above all ever since the countries of
 Western Europe have recognized the fact that they could make a new come-
 back in Eastern Europe by offering their own products on that market.
 The Czechoslovak economy suffered a serious blow in 1960 when China, on
 seeing its "great leap forwards" fall short, refused to accept large
 quantities of materials already manufactured or on its way in fulfill-
 ment of Chinese orders.   This Chinese decision smacked more of politics
 than of economics.  But nowadays even countries like Romania, Bulgaria
 and Poland are pointing out to the Czechs that their products are at
 times inferior to those of the Western competition and one can hardly
 contest the sound economic reasons behind their arguments.   Czechoslovak
 industry therefore finds itself obliged to regain a level of competitive-
 ness with the West, not just to be able to sell to the West as it would
 like to do, but also to sell to the East.  This is one of the essential
 goals which inspired the reform of planning on the agenda.
 While these problems have been rearing their heads on the Social-
 ist markets there has simultaneously come into being within the country
 a situation wherein even the conditions necessary to any continuation
 of the previous extensive development of the economy came to be lacking.
 Manpower resources started to dry up; the countryside was no longer able
 to supply new manpower for the new enterprises since all the young peo-
 ple and women remained and most of the women are already employed in
 Czechoslovakia.   This combination of factors explains why the third Five-
 Year Plan, drawn up in 1960 in line with the older criteria, could not be
 fulfilled.  The opening up of new markets in the underdeveloped countries
 or uncommitted nations which desire in turn to industrialize themselves
 was unable to offer any solution both because of the special aid terms
 required for sale to such countries and because here, too, the same com-
 petitive conditions had to be faced.
 The absence of any long-term goals of development of the Socialist
 community on a unified basis has hurt Czechoslovak industry in the past
 as it still does today.   This is the great problem of COMECON.  For ob-
 jective reasons the Czechs have been and still are among the most ardent
 supporters of collaboration within this organization.   But now they are
 becoming aware that not even COMECON can solve the present-day problems
 of Czechoslovakia.  The solution cannot be expected to come from outside.
 Czechoslovak economists prefer to look for a solution in the principles
 they have laid down as a foundation for their system, even if they are
 not entirely unaware of the fact that at least at the beginning some
 people may well be hurt by it.

 and sub-caps:  The economic reform demands democra-
 tic Socialist solutions; The new labor code approved,
 taking off the manpower freeze and making it easier
 for workers to change their jobs; Czechoslovakia, the
 "new system," - Back from Prague.]
 The Czechoslovak National Assembly voted in the new Labor Code this
 year.   A long time had been spent in drawing it up and discussing it.
 Its final approval underwent a, number of delays, the last one occasioned
 by the need to make the new law fit the requirements of the new economic
 system to go into effect at least partially as of Jan 1.   Its chief new
 feature consists in a gradual unfreezing of the manpower tie-up which
 existed in Czechoslovakia ever since the time of the first five-year
 plan.  The officially proclaimed goal is that of making it easier for
 workers to move from one job to another because otherwise the new cri-
 teria of economic management tending to create a difference between the
 more efficient and the less efficient enterprises and making the more
 efficient ones more attractive to the workers would not be able to oper-
 ate effectively.
 There are two facets to the end of the manpower freeze.   On one hand
 a limitation is done away with in that the chances for a worker to quit
 his job to take another one will no longer be subject to the system of
 authorizations hitherto provided for and will thus become a real right of
 the worker to exercise and not just a very circumscribed one fraught with
 problems and difficulties as it was under the old law.   In order to avoid
 any abrupt changes provision has been made for a transitory period during
 which it will still be necessary to give six months prior notice; later
 this, too, will be reduced to but a few days.   There is another side to
 the picture, too, though, because at the same time restrictions will be
 placed on the rights of the labor unions to oppose any kind of layoffs
 and up to now the unions have used this right quite generously and almost
 without any limit; this limitation of the trade unions' rights will also
 be introduced gradually through a transitional period.  Inevitably the
 new rules allowing a worker to change his job will find popular favor,
 but the permitting of layoffs will turn out to be much less popular.
 Here we are touching on one of the broadest problems opened up by
 the debate on the economic reform, that of its political consequences.
 It is in fact impossible that there should be any coherent application
 of the principles in the basis of the new system of planning and admin-
 istration without there also being a corresponding affect upon the en-
 tire political life of the country because up to now the country's po-
 litical life has been strongly molded by the ideas on planning and
 administration of economic matters held in the past.
 Approved For RPIPacP('tA       l7 ? CIA-RfP7R-03061 A000300050001-4
 Just one example of this is the question of local autonomy.   In
 practice local control has been reduced to an insignificant level and
 even the attempts made back around 1960 to further stimulate it have
 been to little or no avail.  The National Committees, which are the
 organs of local power, have in fact a limited financial autonomy be-
 cause the main part of their budgets comes from funds appropriated from
 the national budget.  Will it be possible for a relationship such as
 this to continue between the central government and the local organs
 even after greater financial autonomy and freedom of action has been
 granted to individual enterprises and concerns?  The answer would seem
 to be no.   Though such a relationship may be consistent within a system
 wherein the whole of economic life was regulated by the detailed instruc-
 tions emanating from a central source of control, such relationships are
 no longer considtent when economic activity is organized in such a way
 as to leave room for a borad decentralization of decision-malting.
 The problem of local autonomy, an important one everywhere, is
 particularly important in Czechoslovakia where in the last analysis it.
 becomes a problem of the relations between Czechs and Slovaks, a problem
 it would be wrong to speak of as being settled forever as has been shown
 in recent years by the reappearance of a whole series of Slovak demands
 at the very time when Slovakia, with its industrialization, had achieved
 great progress.
 But there is more to it than that.   If applied, the reform would
 bring about at least for a while at first a set of results which could
 prove in some cases to be unpopular.  Here we have a process which aims
 at making the Czechoslovak economy more efficient and more productive.
 Certain enterprises will be shut down and others will become stronger.
 Others will cut down on their number of employees which today may be ex-
 cessive and these workers may have to move to other plants which feel a
 manpower shortage.  Workers will therefore have to be displaced and some
 will need to be retrained.  There will also probably be a fight to re-
 duce the level of wages which is very high in Czechoslovakia.  All of
 this is hard to do in a Socialist country without the conscious partici-
 pation of at least a large part of the masses involved.  How can their
 cooperation be attained?  The traditional system of mobilization through
 campaigns and slogans of a political kind can no longer be effective.
 But it is still not clear what can be used to replace it.  There has been
 talk of self-government at plant level and such talk is still going on.
 It appears that this made up part of a first version of the proposed re-
 form and that it was then discarded at least provisionally.  Discussions
 have been carried on at top level in conferences the proceedings of which
 have not been made public on the questions of creating new organizations
 to represent the workers in the factories; no decision has yet been ar-
 rived at because there is resistance to such a suggestion.   The proposal
 has also been made that alternative forms of economic plans be suggested
 and submitted to the people so they will know what is involved in each of
 the choices that is to be made; the forms of discussion attempted to date
 though have been quite far from anything of the kind.

 The entire theme of Socialist democracy thus ends up being only
 a corollary or adjunct to economic reform.   Here just as in the USSR
 there is much less discussion of these problems than there is of the
 technical aspects of the new system.   Some are aware of the fact they
 exist but they do not talk about them while others are perhaps not
 even fully aware of them.   There are those who think that once the re-
 forms are put through everything else will come automatically while
 others are convinced that nothing will change without a fight.  Judg-
 ing just from these brief contrasts of ideas one can readily see the
 political as well as the economic importance of the discussions which
 have grown up around the problems of the economy.
 Something is stirring.   Legislative activity has speeded up in
 recent months.   The National Assembly is working harder and longer.
 Approval has been given the law guaranteeing to every citizen the right
 to receive a passport to travel abroad with certain restrictions; among
 the restrictions which appreciably limit the effect of the law itself
 is one based on the availability of foreign currency which is very scare
 at the present time.  A law on the press is being made ready and is the
 subject of an unfinished debate between the leadership and those who are
 pressing for it.   The new Code of Criminal Procedure calls for the pres-
 ence of a lawyer at the side of the accused during every stage of the
 investigation.   I gained the impression after talking to various attor-
 neys that the question of the day now arousing most interest among the
 public and among those who are specially trained in the field is that
 of the rights of the citizen.   The gravest and most serious shortcomings
 continue to persist in this field.   But this is nothing more than just
 one part, an essential and irrevocable part, of course, as experience
 has shown, but not the only part of the full range of requirements that
 need to be met to achieve a Socialist democracy.
 In substance these problems are common to the entire Socialist camp.
 They exist in the USSR.   They exist more in some places and less in
 others in all the countries of Socialist Europe.   But they are felt in
 Czechoslovakia today perhaps more so than anywhere else.   The very state
 of maturity and of development which have been attained by the country
 explains this difference; it is no mere chance that this is the country
 where not only a higher level of production had been attained, but also
 where the working classes had a longer tradition of struggle and organize
 tion behind them and where even before the Socialist forces gained power
 the conquest of democratic freedoms had already taken root.  We opened
 up our investigation on this key and it is well that we close it in the
 same way.   The outcome of this pilot experiment in Czechoslovakia and of
 the political struggle and debate going on there, good or bad though it
 may be, can serve as a valuable experiment not only for Czechoslovakia
 but for the whole Socialist community.

 Fact Sheet
 27 September 1965
 The small colony of British Guiana, located on the northeast coast
 of South America, has a political importance immensely greater than its
 size or economy could ever warrant.  This importance derives from the
 fact that, in a nation riven by racial strife, its largest political
 party, composed almost exclusively of a single ethnic group, is entirely
 dominated by a group of Communists.
 The only British colony on the South American mainland, British
 Guiana was acquired by Great Britian from the Dutch in 1811.  It has an
 area of only some 83,000 square miles.  Its leading export products are
 rice, sugar, and bauxite which produce an annual foreign trade of about
 $117 million British West Indies dollars (B14I $1.00 = U.S. $.59).  The
 present population is estimated to be about 620,000 of whom some 1+8
 percent are of East Indian origin and 31+ percent of African origin, the
 remainder being Amerindian, Chinese, and European.
 25X1C10b
 British Guiana began moving toward independence when a new Consti-
 tution was introduced in 1953, instituting universal suffrage, a bicameral
 legislature, and a ministerial system.  In April of that year elections
 were held to establish the new legislature and the People's Progressive
 Party (PPP) won a sweeping victory, capturing 51% of the vote, and 18 of
 the 21+ seats in the assembly.
 At that time the PPP was a leftist party led by Cheddi Jagan and
 his wife Janet.  Jagan, the eldest of 11 children, was born on March 22,
 1918 on a sugar plantation in eastern British Guiana.  His grandparents
 had come to the colony as indentured sugarcane laborers from famine-
 stricken India.                           His father was foreman of a plantation work gang.
 Cheddi Jagan managed to get to the United States in 1936 where he
 studied at Howard University in Washington and then at the Northwestern
 University Dental School in Chicago, from which he graduated in 1912.
 In Chicago he met his future wife, Janet, a student nurse and member of
 the Young Communist League.  The following year the Jagans returned to
 British Guiana, where he set up business as a dentist and she started
 in left-wing politics.  Cheddi soon became equally involved in politics,
 first as treasurer of the sugar cane workers trade union (he was a
 dentist!) and then in 1917 he won a seat in the legislature as a repre-
 sentative of the rural district of Central Demerara.  Jagan had the very
 active support of his wife and together they founded the Politial Affairs
 Committee in 1917, which became the PPP in 1950.
 As a result of the PPP's electoral victory in 1953, the party was
 called upon to participate in the cabinet.  Characteristically this pro-
 duced a crisis in the party with the ultra-leftists arguing that they

 should not hold office in the government because the Constitution was
 rife with defects, according to their dogma.  (These same purists had
 vociferously advocated back in 1950, that the Party be a straightfor-
 wardly Communist Party, not a "spineless leftist coalition.")  A com-
 promise was worked out, however; it provided for the PPP to enter the
 government, but to use its position to frustrate the workings of the
 government, thereby proving that the constitution was unsatisfactory
 and providing an excellent platform for demanding far-reaching constitu-
 tional reforms.
 In October 1953, faced with demonstrations and strikes encouraged
 by the PPP, the British Governor called upon the Colonial Office to
 send troops and warships to forestall a suspected attempt "to set up a
 Communist state."  The constitution was suspended, Jagan and the other
 PPP ministers were dismissed, a state of emergency was declared, and
 the British Government issued a White Paper charging the PPP leaders
 with efforts to turn British Guiana into a Communist state by means of
 violence and conspiracy.  An appointed government was then instituted
 and it ruled the country for the next four years.
 During the interim years a struggle for power developed in the PPP;
 it was led by Forbes Burnham, a Negro (or African, in the local parlance)
 who had been a Minister in the PPP government.  Failing in his attempt
 to oust Jagan, Brunham broke with the PPP and formed his own party, the
 People's National Congress (PNC).  Although many East Indians left the
 PPP to join Burnham, and many Africans remained in the PPP, the overall
 result was nevertheless to create a distinct racial split which has since
 accentuated itself and the PPP is now almost entirely East Indian and the
 PNC African.  Ironically the three chief ultra-leftists of Jagan's party,
 shaken by Khrushchev's Secret Speech and the Hungarian Revolution, re-
 signed from the PPP, two of them leaving politics altogether while one,
 Sydney King, joined Burnham and became a violent Negro nationalist.
 New elections were held in 1957 and were characterized by a subtle
 racist policy adopted by the PPP calculated to bring in East Indian
 votes.  It succeeded and the PPP received 4+8% of the popular vote.
 Under the terms of a revised constitution promulgated in 1957, the
 cabinet was presided over by the Governor who retained emergency powers,
 to be invoked in the event of crisis.  The PPP held five cabinet seats,
 with Jagan Minister of Trade and Industry and his wife, Janet, Minister
 of Labor, Health, and Housing.  Jagan's conduct was quite different from
 that of 1953 and his Party cooperated satisfactorily with the Governor
 (in keeping, let it be noted, with the Soviet policy of consolidation
 and peaceful coexistence after the Secret Speech and the repression in
 Hungary).  This moderation led the British Government to consider further
 steps toward independence and a Constitutional Convention was held in
 1961 to establish a new Constitution giving further autonomy to the
 Guianese and to prepare the way for full independence, then contemplated
 for 1962.  This new law provided internal self-government with the British
 government retaining control over national defense and foreign relations,
 as well as a veto po:rer over legislation.

 The elections of Aug,
 gast 1961 were marke^. by racial tensions and
 charges of Communism.  The PPP emerged from the campaign with 42.6 per-
 cent of the vote and 20 of the 35 legislative seats.  Forbes Burnhem's
 PNC garnered 41% of the vote end 11 seats, and the United Force (UP), a
 new party formed by conservative businessman Peter D`Aguiar, got 16.4%
 of the vote and 4 seats.  Jagan was thereupon installed as Premier.'
 The new government announced its two main objectives as the estab-
 lishment of a socialist economy and the achievement of independence.
 This was sufficient to discourage further foreign investment in British
 Guiana and Jagan's attempts to secure large-scale economic aid from the
 United States were not successful.  Under these circumstances Jagan an-
 nounced a new austerity budget in February 1962, which was greeted by
 protest demonstrations which soon degenerated into large-scale riots in
 the course of which whole sections of Georgetown were burned down.  Jagan
 was compelled to call on British troops for help in restoring order.
 In October of that year a conference on independence was held in
 London to agree upon the procedure for granting independence and to fix
 its date.  The Guianese representatives, Jagan, Burnham and D'Aguiar
 could not agree on the procedure and date, however, and the talks col-
 lapsed.  1963 was marred by an 80 day general strike led by the Trades
 Union Council and followed by the Civil Service Association, and the
 workers in industry, transport and postal services.
 A second conference on independence was held in London in October
 1963.  Again the conferees failed to agree and, in consequence, asked
 Mr. Duncan Sandys, the British. Colonial Secretary, to impose a solution,
 with which they promised to aide.  Ther:?upon Sandys announced that new
 elections would be held in 1964 under a new electoral system of Pro-
 portional Representation (PR) and that after these elections a new con-
 ference would be called to settle any further outstanding issues and to
 fix a date for independence.
 The crucial factor in this decision was the introduction of PR.
 Until that time el._ctio:.zs had aaen h.~ld under the simple plurality ..
 system in each electoral district (known in English and Guianese parlance
 as " first-past-t .lc- poc ;'t) .  Although the plurality system tends to en-
 courage a two party system, it worked in British Guiana (a) to foster
 party voting along strictly racial lines, (b) to favor the election of
 East Indians, since they are more evenly spread through the country, the
 Africans being heavily concentrated in the urban areas, and (c) to per-
 petuate the PPP in office (witii only 42.6 percent of the vote they
 obtained 57 percent of the seats).  PR, on the other hand, would tend
 to fragment the major parties, hopefully breaking the lines of racial
 division, and to foster the formation of small groups representing
 regional and occupational interests.
 The PPP immediately realized its mistake in permitting Sandys to
 decide upon the electoral system and, failing to honor Jagan's commit-
 ment, emphatically declared that it would not accept Proportional Repre-
 sentation.  The PPP organ Thunder, in its issue of February-March 1964,

 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300050001-4
 declared:  "The Sandys Plan must be stopped and party members and
 supporters must understand that in order to stop the Sandys Plan they
 will have to make sacrifices on a scale and to a degree never required
 of them before.  Whatever the effort and whatever the sacrifices, the
 Sandys Plan MUST B  STOPPED."
 The strategy decided upon was to create sufficient chaos so that
 an election would be impossible and at the same time to push a demand
 for immediate independence so that either the British would give in and
 grant independence, or a successful revolution could proclaim independence.
 The campaign was launched with a strike by a government-sponsored scab
 sugarcane workers' union.  The union was not recognized by either the
 British Guiana 'rades Union Council nor by the employers; it had been
 created because the PPP had been entirely unsuccessful in its attempts
 to gain control of the legitimate union.  However, this strike was really
 only an excuse for chaos.  It led to some 200 deaths, hundreds of injured,
 and millions of dollars of damage to cane fields, factories, houses,
 stores.  But the worst crime of all was that the PPP's campaign increased
 and crystallized the racial conflict in British Guiana to the point that
 in villages of mixed population, the Africans packed up and moved to
 African-controlled areas for protection, and the East Indians left for
 Indian-controlled villages.  Thus the supreme accomplishment of Jagan
 and his Communists had been the destruction of an inter-racial amity con-
 structed during a period of some 200 years.
 Finally, in May, the Governor declared a state of emergency and
 British troops were called out to prevent sheer anarchy.  Although the
 struggle continued thereafter in sporadic outbursts throughout the coun-
 try, peace was imposed sufficiently to permit the registration of voters
 and the holding of elections on December 7, 1964.
 As hoped, the PPP failed to gain a clear majority of votes; it re-
 ceived only 45.8% and 24 seats versus 40.5% (22 seats) for the PNC, and
 12.4% (7 seats) to the UF.  The PNC and UF immediately agreed upon a
 coalition government and on December 14, 1964 Forbes Burnham was installed
 as Premier and Peter D'Aguiar as Minister of Finance.  When the new Parlia-
 ment convened on 31 December it was boycotted by the PPP; this boycott was
 maintained until May 1965, when the PPP deputies were sworn in, but they
 left again two days later when the speaker of the house refused to let
 them debate endlessly the salary of the Attorney General.
 The period since the installation of the Burnham government has been
 marked by intermittent acts of sabotage and terrorism despite efforts to
 solve the racial conflict by the Colonial Secretary Anthony Greenwood,
 who visited British Guiana in February 1965, and the repeated attempts
 at conciliation made by Forbes Burnham.
 One of Cheddi Jagan's oft-repeated complaints, and a major excuse
 for his opposition to independence, has been that the civil service, and
 most particularly the police force, is controlled by Africans and that

 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300050001-4
 East Indians are discr!mins:1.ed against in the civil service employment
 practices.  To answer this accusation as impartially and objectively as
 possible, Burnham invited the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ),
 a highly respected organization composed of leading lawyers and judges
 from practically all non-Communist countries, to conduct a special in-
 vestigation in British Guiana.  But when the investigators held hear-
 ings in British Guiana in June 1965, Cheddi Jagan refused to testify!
 It is interesting to note that the evidence presented to the investiga-
 tors did indicate that a large majority of police officers are of African
 origin ... for several not-so-obvious reasons:  (a) The urban population,
 from which most of the officers are recruited, is preponderantly African,
 the East Indians being concentrated in the sugar-growing rural areas;
 (b) Only a relatively small percent of the applicants for police posi-
 tions, are East Indians; (c) Many East Indians don't pass the English
 language requirement because they have been taught in Hindu in their com-
 munal schools which they have attended in preference to the public schools
 where instruction is in English; (d) many of the East Indians are simply
 too small to meet the requirments of the police force.  In any event, the
 ICJ report is expected to be published early in October 1965; its find-
 ings will be of interest, as is the fact that the Burnham government
 solicited this impartial investigation.
 The most notable achievement of the Burhnam government has been the
 boost given to British Guiana's economy; this has been in good measure
 due to renewed confidence in the country's future on the part of foreign
 investors.  An American aluminum company has announced an investment in
 a new processing plant; Germany is providing technical assistance , the
 United States Government is providing funds, equipment and advisors for
 major construction projects;
 the Guianese themselves have contributed L10 million to their country's
 development.  Unemployment is being tackled realistically.  Perhaps
 most important of all is not these concrete achievements but rather the
 contrast in directions:  the new government is moving forward, the pre-
 vious government was leading the nation to ruin.  Of course much remains
 to be done.  As the new Prime Minister says:  "ode have not achieved the
 millennium.  Milk and honey are not our diet.  But can anyone deny that
 British Guiana is on the move, and has established its right to take its
 place among the free nations of the world"?
 And independence is indeed the next, and imminent, step.  The
 British Colonial Secretary, Anthony Greenwood, has called for a confer-
 ence in London on 2 November to finally establish the procedure and set
 the date for granting independence.  It is generally expected that agree-
 ment will be reached on a date sometime in the Spring or Summer of 1966.
 There is little doubt that Jagan and the PPP will attempt to fore-
 stall independence as long as they are out of power.  Nor is there much
 doubt that, failing to prevent independence, they will attempt to oust
 Burnham before the next regular election, scheduled for 1968.  However

 Approved For Release 1999/09/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300050001-4
 Jagan will have his problems.  For one thing, although the controlling
 directorate of the PPP is Communist, the constituents are not.  And
 there are already signs that the rank and file realize that the PPP's
 policies are not entirely in the interests of the Indian community.
 The quality of Prime Minister Burnham's statesmanship may well succeed
 in posing an attractive alternative which could wean them away from
 their extremist leaders.
 Another problem for Jagan is the development of the current ultra-
 leftist faction of his party, now led principally by Brindley Benn, the
 PPP's former Chairman, and by Moses Bhagwan, head of the party's youth
 branch,the Progressive. Youth Organization (PYO).  It is the PYO which
 has been sending youths to Cuba and Moscow for training in guerrilla
 warfare and sabotage as well as in Communist theory and tactics.  As
 has been seen in other countries of Central and South America, these
 are the "violence now, theory later" fanatical extremists who cannot
 but alineate a large part of the East Indians.
 Typical of the problem involved was the press conference held on
 12 September 1965 by two Guianese students returning from study in Cuba
 where they had scholarships awarded by the PPP.  They said they had been
 forced to undergo military training, including infantry, bombing and
 sabotage tactics, as part of their "scholarship."  According to the
 Georgetown press, they exposed a Cuban-Jagan plot to foment rebellion
 in British Guiana by pitting East Indians against Negroes.  The two stu-
 dents revealed that they had tried to leave Cuba for a whole year before
 being finally released.  They were warned by the Cubans and by the PPP
 representative in Cuba, Lalbahadur Labachan that they and their families
 would be killed if they tried to say anything against the PPP-
