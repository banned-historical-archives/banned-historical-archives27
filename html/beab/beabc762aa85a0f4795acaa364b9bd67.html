 A mixed force of Palestinians and Muslim leftists capture Lebanese army armoured car
 LEBANON: WORSE YET
 Fighting intensified ominously this week as
 more mainline Palestinians entered the country in
 support of the Muslims and leftists, and the
 Lebanese armed forces became more heavily in-
 volved on the side of the Christians. The
 deterioration resulted in an immediate sizable
 jump in the aggregate death toll since armed
 clashes first broke out last spring, and prompted
 an announcement by Prime Minister Karami that
 he would resign. New hopes that the adversaries
 might at last be ready to defuse the situation,
 nourished initially by little more than the sheer
 magnitude of the carnage, were encouraged by
 President Franjiyah's public claim on January 22
 that all parties had agreed on a new plan to
 resolve the basic political issues underlying the
 protracted crisis. In fact, such agreement is ap-
 parently still being sought.
 Warfare Spreads
 For the first time since the conflict began last
 April, the Lebanese air force, apparently on
 orders from Christian Interior Minister Shamun,
 made several strikes against Palestinian and
 Muslim forces. The target groups had surrounded
 a group of small Christian villages south of Beirut
 early last week. The action was not cleared with
 Karami, who also serves as defense minister, and
 triggered  his resignation statement. Lebanese
 ground forces sided more openly with Christian
 militiamen in the battle to fend off combined
 Palestinian and Muslim advances on the Christian
 city of Zagharta in the north and Zahlah, the ma-
 jor Christian enclave in eastern Lebanon.
 Meanwhile, the main Christian militias sup-
 ported by some elements of the army concen-
 trated on tightening their blockade, established
 two weeks ago, of two large Palestinian refugee
 camps in eastern Beirut. They also strove, with
 some success, to consolidate their hold over the
 northeastern portion of the capital on both sides
 of the Beirut River. The Christians now have
 access to a major supply route north of the city
 and have established control over a large area
 from the northeast sector of the capital that is
 contiguous to the predominantly Christian Mt.
 Lebanon area.

 These gains were offset, however, by heavy
 Christian losses in northern and eastern Lebanon,
 where approximately 3,000 troops of the Palestine
 Liberation Army have crossed the border from
 their bases in Syria. These troops have not yet
 become significantly involved in clashes with
 either the Lebanese army or the Christian militias.
 They have provided important support, however,
 to the fedayeen and Lebanese Muslims who are
 tightening their hold on large areas of the north
 and the east.
 The battlelines that have developed over the
 week have begun to create a de facto partition of
 the country as Muslim and Christian enclaves
 have fallen one after another. This emerging
 geographic division and the heavy losses on both
 sides have had a sobering effect on all parties to
 the conflict that may help in further negotiations.
 Political Developments
 Syrian President Asad played a major role in
 working out the "comprehensive political
 settlement" announced by Franjiyah's office; it is
 a revision of the five-point peace program
 proposed by the Syrians last month and rejected
 by the Christians. The new agreement calls for the
 formation of a military committee composed of
 Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian representatives
 to fix a date for a cease-fire. The committee is
 then to name a number of subcommittees to im-
 plement the truce.
 Few specifics have been announced,
 suggesting that many details remain to be worked
 out on the terms of a political settlement and
 even on how a cease-fire is to be implemented.
 The new plan reportedly retains Muslim demands
 for equal representation in parliament and the
 continued election of the prime minister by the
 parliament. Unlike the-earlier proposal, however,
 it would allow the Christians to keep their
 predominant representation in top civil service
 and army posts.

 Karami's threat to resignon January 18 gave a
 greater sense of urgency to political negotiations
 Myatt
 throughout the week, and probably shocked
 Muslim and more pragmatic Christian leaders
 into greater flexibility. Concern that remaining
 government authority might collapse should
 Karami decide to carry out his threat has probably
 given added impetus to Syria's mediation effort.
 By threatening to withdraw, Karami has also
 strengthened his own hand, which has been a
 force for reconciliation and compromise.
 On the Christian side, Franjiyah and
 Phalanges Party leader Jumayyil seem inclined to
 accept the Syrian plan; Shamun, however,
 appears  to  be  resisting.  Leftist spokesman
 Jumblatt has not been heard from nor have other
 representatives of the more radical leftist and
 Muslim factions. Even if the top leadership of rival
 groups can be brought in line, there is still a
 serious question of whether undisciplined forces
 on both sides would accept a truce.
 Economy Near Standstill

 the economy close to a standstill. Although many

 of the foreign firms that have left may eventually
 come back, a return to prewar levels of economic
 activity is unlikely for many years.
 With few natural resources of its own,
 Lebanon has relied on commerce and banking. Its
 economic policies, together with a strong curren-
 cy, have promoted large capital movements into
 the country and rapid growth in earnings from
 banking and commercial services. Beirut became
 the key international commercial center in the
 Middle East.
 Lebanon's prosperity hit a peak in 1974.
 Buoyed by Arab oil money, Lebanon achieved a
 record balance-of-payments surplus and added
 $650 million to its foreign exchange reserves. Net
 capital movement into the country reached $875
 million in 1974 compared with a previous high of
 $280 million three years earlier. Tourism rebound-
 ed sharply from 1973 when it was dampened by
 the October war.
 The fighting that began last April totally
 reversed this picture of prosperity. The foreign
 business community-the backbone of banking-
 commercial activity that had been generating
 some 70 percent of Lebanon's gross national
 product-left and so did hundreds of thousands
 of skilled foreign workers. Lebanese white collar
 workers have also begun to leave.
 The country has been split into isolated units,
 production has all but stopped, unemployment is
 high, and distribution problems are severe. There
 are serious food shortages in sections of Beirut.
 The latest Lebanese estimate of the economic
 cost of the war, made in October, put physical
 damage and commercial losses at nearly $3.5
 billion-equivalent to the country's gross national
 product in 1974. Heavy fighting since then has
 added to the toll. The gross national product in
 1975 could be down as much as 20 percent, and
 Lebanon may have run up its first balance-of-
 payments deficit since 1967. Beirut will have to dig
 into its $1.7 billion in foreign exchange reserves to
 cover the large balance-of-payments deficit likely
 this year.
 Even if the fighting were to end soon and
 some sort of political stability were restored, the
 country would still be left facing a long recovery
 period and a need for substantial foreign
 assistance. Foreign businesses have set up
 elsewhere and will not return quickly. Many
 foreign workers who have fled the country have
 found niches in Amman, Kuwait, and other Arab
 cities and are not likely to rush back to Beirut.
 Lebanon will also be saddled with economic
 problems that are unrelated to the fighting. An
 agreement with Iraq, which provided half of
 Lebanon's petroleum consumption, expired in
 December. The contracted price was $3.05 per
 barrel, and a new contract will probably be at
 world market prices, thus adding $175 million to 25X1
 Lebanon's import bill. Lebanon owes the Saudi
 pipeline carrier $100 million in back payments.
 ANGOLA:    / 3, /5/ /111-'
 The Popular Movement for the Liberation of
 Angola moved quickly to expand  military
 operations on its southern front following the
 collapse in the north of the National Front for the
 Liberation of Angola. In heavy fighting in several
 areas of central Angola during the past week, the
 Popular Movement met stiff resistance from units
 of the National Union for the Total Independence
 of Angola that South Africans have been aiding.
 The  National  Union's position  may soon
 deteriorate rapidly, however, as a result of the
 reported decision by Pretoria to withdraw its
 forces from the Angolan conflict. The number of
 Cuban troops in Angola spearheading the
 Popular Movement's drives now probably ex-
 ceeds 10,000 men.

 South African troops that have been operating in
 the eastern and western sectors of central Angola
 reportedly have already begun a pullback to
 Namibia. Some South African forces will almost
 certainly remain on the Angolan side of the
 border to protect the important Cunene
 hydroelectric project.
 The loss of the South African troops is a major
 blow to the National Union, which was counting
 heavily on them to help it cope with expected
 new drives by the Popular Movement and its
 Cuban legions. National Union officials apparent-
 ly had expected Pretoria to step up its assistance
 in view of the failure of the Organization of
 African Unity to condemn South Africa's involve-
 ment in Angola at the recent OAU emergency
 summit meeting. The National Union itself has
 neither the technical know-how nor the equip-
 ment to compete with the Cuban-backed and
 Soviet-equipped Popular Movement forces. Its
 only chance for survival may be to revert to
 guerrilla tactics.
 Military Situation
 In northern Angola this week, the Popular
 Movement concentrated on consolidating its
 position at Ambrizete. It has not attempted to
 push farther north toward the Zairian border,
 suggesting that some forces from this sector have
 already been shifted to operations in the south
 against the National Union.
 Reports from central Angola are fragmentary
 and contradictory, but it is clear that fighting
 between the National Union and the Popular
 Movement has intensified. One of the most
 heavily contested positions was Cela.
 In the east, the National Union appears to be
 maintaining pressure on  Popular Movement
 forces ensconced in the important railway town
 of Teixeira de Sousa, close to the Zairian border.
 Last weekend, Popular Movement troops in this
 battle area were hit from another direction when
 Zairian jet fighters strafed the Soviet-backed
 group's positions at two locations. The strikes ap-
 parently were in retaliation for the Popular
 Movement's earlier destruction of a bridge link-
 ing Teixeira de Sousa with Dililo on the Zairian
 side of the Cassai River; at least one of the strikes
 may have been coordinated with a ground move
 by National Union troops.
 Political Developments
 The military collapse of the National
 Front-historically the Popular Movement's most
 bitter adversary-is stimulating new talk of a
 possible political settlement between the other
 two groups. Reports indicating that such a deal
 was under active consideration have circulated

 for months; it would probably be favored by most
 of the 22 African countries that refused to accept
 Agostinho Neto's Popular Movement regime as
 Angola's legitimate government at the OAU sum-
 mit and by at least some of those who supported
 the Popular Movementt. Since that meeting, an
 Egyptian official told the US embassy in Cairo that
 a new effort is under way to bring about "unity"
 between the Popular Movement and the National
 Union. He professed not to know whether the ef-
 fort was meeting with any success.
 The National Union's Savimbi has consistent-
 ly favored a compromise arrangement that would
 enable all three Angolan groups to be included in
 a national unity government as envisaged in the
 independence agreement they concluded with
 Portugal a year ago. The National Union formally
 reiterated this position-rejected by the National
 Front since last summer-at its annual conference
 late last month. This week, Savimbi, in Kinshasa
 for a strategy meeting with President Mobutu,
 publicly denied current press reports of secret
 contacts between his group and the Popular
 Movement looking toward formation of a two-
 party coalition. Nevertheless, in view of recent
 military developments, Savimbi might now be
 willing to conclude such an arrangement.
 The real problem, of course, is gaining the
 agreement of the Popular Movement, which for
 months has also rejected the unity solution. At
 present, Neto's regime is publicly proclaiming
 that the defeat of the Front changes nothing and
 that no coalition is possible with any of the
 "lackeys of imperialism." In the past, some of-
 ficials of Neto's group have stated privately that a
 coalition might be concluded with the National
 Union provided the South Africans leave and
 Savimbi steps down. The first condition now is ap-
 parently being satisfied; the second might be
 negotiable.
 If key African supporters of the Popular
 Movement were to press for an accommodation
 with the Union, political leaders of the Movement
 might still be amenable. But at this stage the
 chances that Neto's military hardliners, who are
 surely anticipating additional major victories for
 their forces, could be brought into line any time
 soon seem dim indeed.

 Soviets Maintain Uncompromising Line
 Moscow is continuing its tough, uncom-
 promising public line on Angola in the wake of
 the OAU summit.
 Pravda, in its weekly roundup of international
 affairs, poured cold water on the notion of a
 coalition government as a solution to the Angolan
 conflict. There is no "realistic" basis for a govern-
 ment of national unity in Angola, Pravda said, ad-
 ding that such an idea is obviously the product of
 "pressure from Western imperialist circles." In an
 effort to put the best possible face on Soviet dis-
 appointment over the OAU's failure to recognize
 the Popular Movement as Angola's legitimate
 government, Pravda claimed that the deadlock at
 Addis Ababa was really a defeat for the
 "imperialists," who were unable to "dictate" the
 course of events in Angola.
 In addition to reaffirming strong Soviet and
 Cuban support for the Popular Movement, Prav-
 da and all other components of the USSR's media
 have been giving heavy play to the military
 collapse of National Front forces in northern
 Angola. The commentaries stress the opportunity
 this presents for major Popular Movement gains
 against National Union forces on the eastern and
 southern fronts.
 Despite the Kremlin's hard public line, hints
 that the USSR's position on Angola may not be
 entirely inflexible are continuing to come from
 Soviet officials in Moscow and abroad. There is
 some talk of a coalition government that is clearly
 dominated by the Popular Movement.
 The idea of a coalition government un-
 doubtedly reflects one strain of Soviet thinking on
 the Angolan problem, but it is not likely to be in
 ascendance so long as the Popular Movement and
 the Cubans appear to have an opportunity to
 crush their rivals on the ground in Angola. If the
 National Union collapses as a fighting force and
 the South Africans pull out, however, it is possible
 the Soviets will urge Neto to make some gesture
 of reconciliation to the Savimbi remnants in the
 interest of gaining stronger control over the
 Angolan countryside and its divided, tribal pop-

 INDIA: DEPENDING ON FOREIGN OIL
 India's oil production of 150,000 barrels per
 day covers only about 30 percent of domestic re-
 quirements of about 520,000 barrels per day. Since
 1965 the use of oil has grown 8 percent annually,
 and oil imports have risen 7 percent annually. In-
 dia now ranks second in oil imports among
 developing countries. Brazil imports the most.
 Since 1965, total commercial energy con-
 sumption has grown at the relatively low rate of 5
 percent per year. Coal is the most important com-
 mercial energy source, providing about 60 per-
 cent of commercial consumption. Coal reserves
 are extensive, exceeding 100 billion tons, 1,300
 times current annual  production. Petroleum

 provides about 30 percent of commercial energy
 consumption.
 The financial strain resulting from the
 quadrupling of world petroleum prices in 1973-74
 prompted New Delhi to impose a ceiling on im-
 ports and to hold down domestic consumption.
 These efforts were successful largely because of
 the industrial slump under way since 1973. In 1974
 the volume of oil imports was held at the 1973
 level, but the cost doubled, reaching $1.5 billion.
 To offset the higher outlays for petroleum, as well
 as for fertilizer and food imports, imports of
 capital equipment and spare parts were severely
 restricted, reinforcing the industrial slump.
 Economic recovery in 1975 caused oil imports to
 increase 7 percent, to 300,000 barrels per day of
 crude and 65,000 barrels per day of products.
 INDIA: Commercial Energy
 Consumption

 To ease the financial burden, New Delhi has
 increased direct government purchases of oil and
 has negotiated concessional financing with
 several OPEC suppliers. During the past two years,
 an estimated $500 million in payments for imports
 was deferred under agreements with Iran, Iraq,
 and Abu Dhabi.
 Turbulence in international oil prices and
 marketing arrangements has accelerated New
 Delhi's long-planned take-over of the oil in-
 dustry. In 1974 the government bought 74 percent
 of Exxon's marketing and refining operations; the
 remainder will be acquired in 1981. Burmah
 Shell's assests were purchased in December, and
 negotiations for take-over have started with
 Caltex, the last foreign oil company in India.
 Over the long run, New Delhi hopes to ease
 the oil burden by stepping up domestic energy
 production and by converting from oil to coal. In-
 dia has considerable energy resources, but, in the
 past, exploitation has lagged because of the curbs

 government bureaucracy.
 While onshore efforts have been disappoint-
 ing,                                                       offshore exploration shows considerable

 crude oil production rates of 200,000 barrels per
 day in this offshore area by 1980.
 India faces a formidable challenge in
 forestalling an increase in oil imports. Five years
 from now, oil consumption is likely to be on the
 order of 760,000 barrels per day.  India will
 probably maintain or improve the current ratio of
 domestic production to oil consumed, which will
 require additional production on the order of 85,-

 ICELAND: BACK FROM THE BRINK
 The British decision on January 19 to
 withdraw its frigates and reconnaissance aircraft
 from Iceland's unilaterally declared 200-mile
 fishing zone came just hours after Reykjavik had
 decided to break diplomatic relations with Lon-
 don.
 The Icelandic cabinet held two emergency
 sessions on January 19. The first meeting ended
 with a decision to break relations next week un-
 less Britain withdrew its frigates from Iceland's
 disputed waters. A ramming incident at sea,
 however, sent the cabinet back into session, with
 the result that the deadline for breaking relations
 was moved up to January 24.
 British press reports indicated that an Icelan-
 dic patrol boat rammed a British fishing vessel
 after failing to cut the British trawler's lines.
 Iceland blamed the UK, labeling the incident a
 "deliberate ramming" by the British trawler.
 The Icelandic ultimatum came while NATO
 Secretary General Luns was meeting with British
 Foreign Secretary Callaghan in Brussels to try to
 work out a solution to the dispute. Both Luns and
 Callaghan were angered by the timing of the
 Icelandic announcement, especially since
 Callaghan had already agreed last week to
 withdraw Britain's frigates and fishing vessels from
 Icelandic waters in return for an Icelandic com-
 promise on the size of the British annual catch.
 After Luns failed to get Iceland to retract its
 ultimatum, Callaghan agreed to proceed with the
 withdrawal. Callaghan warned, however, that the
 warships would return if Icelandic patrol boats
 continued to harass British trawlers. Callaghan
 also invited Icelandic Prime Minister Hallgrimsson
 to London for talks with British Prime Minister
 Wilson. Hallgrimsson and Wilson will presumably
 try to formalize a "cease-fire" and work out a date
 for the resumption of negotiations.
 Luns was apparently able to convince
 Callaghan that the Icelandic government was in
 no mood to compromise. Luns came away from a
 meeting last week with government leaders in
 Reykjavik "appalled" by Icelandic intransigence.
 Emotions have run higher during the current dis-
 pute than during previous periods of tension
 generated by the fisheries dispute, and public
 opinion on the left and right clamored for a tough
 Icelandic stance. Reykjavik's decision to issue its
 ultimatum, even though Britain had already

 agreed to withdraw from Icelandic waters, was
 probably meant to appease such demands.
 By giving in to Reykjavik's demands, London
 probably hopes to avoid involving NATO in the
 dispute. Iceland had vowed earlier to withdraw its
 NATO delegation if the break in relations with
 London did not result in any progress. In addition,
 the majority of participants in a North Atlantic
 Council meeting in Brussels on January 19 called
 on Britain to withdraw its frigates as a first step
 toward resuming negotiations.
 London's immediate concern now is that with
 the frigates gone, British trawlers may again be
 subject to Icelandic harassment. The UK has
 decided, therefore, to keep its unarmed protec-
 tion vessels on station. Reykjavik has so far refus-
 ed to give London any assurance that the harass-
 ment of British trawlers will cease.
 Iceland will drive a hard bargain on a new
 fishing agreement if Hallgrimsson and Wilson
 decide to resume negotiations. When talks broke
 off last November, Reykjavik was insisting that
 Britain limit its annual catch to 65,000 tons. Lon-
 don was pressing for 110,000 tons but later in-
 dicated a willingness to compromise.
 Hallgrimsson, already in political trouble for the
 "restraint" he has shown on the fishing issue,
 knows that many Icelanders feel the government
 has made too many substantive concessions
 already.

 Spanish police pursue demonstrators along Madrid's main street
 SPAIN: UNREST CONTROLLED    ' -
 The government's policy of using enough
 force to prevent political demonstrations and
 strikes from getting out of hand-but stopping
 short of the extreme measures of the Franco
 era-appears to have controlled the current wave
 of protests in Madrid.
 The success of the police in preventing the
 large-scale leftist demonstration this week has set
 back leftist efforts to politicize current labor un-
 rest. The rally was called by the two major leftist
 opposition coalitions, the Communist-dominated
 Democratic Junta and the Socialist-led Platform of
 Democratic Convergence. The two groups plan-
 ned to march on the prime minister's office to
 press demands for political reforms, higher
 wages, and amnesty for political prisoners. Some
 leftists reportedly hoped to provoke strong
 government countermeasures,  including
 bloodshed, in order to discredit the new govern-
 ment and its proclaimed tolerance of orderly dis-
 sent.
 The government banned the demonstration
 as disruptive to public order and announced the
 police would take whatever measures necessary
 to prevent it. Reportedly this caused some impor-
 tant members of the coalitions to decide not to
 participate. A heavy concentration of police
 prevented groups from congregating, and while
 some tear gas and clubs were used in crowd con-
 trol, police action was generally restrained. Only
 seven persons were detained.
 The two coalitions may now find it difficult to
 carry out other large-scale joint actions since it is
 now clear they would provoke another massive
 police turnout. Earlier, the Communist Party and
 several illegal labor organizations were calling for
 a general strike this month.
 The government has also been successful
 with its decision to draft workers to keep essential
 services going. Rail and postal services returned
 quickly to normal this week after government-
 issued edicts drafting postal workers and railway
 personnel made them liable to military discipline
 if they refused to return to work. Subway workers
 will also be drafted if they follow through on
 threats to strike again. The government has said it
 will negotiate with public utilities workers, but
 will not tolerate disruption of services.
 Senior military and civilian officials have told
 US officials they are confident that this first
 serious challenge to the government will start to
 ease soon, as some of the remaining large strikes
 are settled.
 There are some indications that labor unrest
 may already have passed its peak. Striking con-
 struction and port workers have begun to return

 to work after winning pay raises that may be close
 to 20 percent-3 or 4 percent higher than the
 current wage ceiling allows.
 Madrid's industrial area, however, remains
 the focal point of unrest with about 15 large fac-
 tories still closed, an estimated 40,000 metal and
 auto workers idle, and another 6,000 bank
 employees staging intermittent stoppages to sup-
 port demands for higher pay. About 125,000
 workers are still idle across the country, but
 almost double that number have returned to
 work. The fact that the government permitted its
 wage ceiling to be broken in the port and con-
 struction industry settlements has led to specula-
 PORTUGAL: MILITARY-PARTY TALKS
 The Portuguese military is now engaged in
 consultations with the political parties this week
 to determine the future shape of the government.
 Although some politically minded officers are
 reportedly trying to retain a dominant role for the
 military, the parties will make a determined effort
 to curb its power and to start the country toward a
 democratic parliamentary system.
 The talks will center on an exchange of
 proposals for revising the pact guaranteeing
 military supremacy in the government, which was
 imposed upon the parties last spring by the
 pro-Communist  Goncalves  regime.  Although
 both sides want to reach agreement soon in order
 to pave the way for national elections by April 25,
 fundamental differences could cause the talks to
 drag out.
 A draft agreement given to the parties last
 week by the Revolutionary Council will form the
 basis for discussions. The draft appears to be the
 work of a group of officers led by Foreign
 Minister Melo Antunes which seeks to continue
 the military's leading role for a period of several
 years in the belief that inter-party squabbling
 makes military oversight necessary if there is to be
 effective government. The military's proposals
 would give the Revolutionary Council veto power
 over nominations for prime minister and over
 legislation dealing with foreign affairs, national
 defense, freedom of association, elections, and
 division of property among the private, state, and
 collective sectors.
 While the armed forces' proposal would give
 the president-who although directly elected
 would almost certainly be a military man-the
 power to dissolve the popularly elected legislative
 assembly, it also allows for the Revolutionary
 Council to request such action. The president
 would also be empowered to dismiss the prime
 minister after consultation with military leaders,
 the parties, and the cabinet.
 The military's draft, which in effect makes the
 president, the legislative assembly, and the
 cabinet subordinate to the all-military
 Revolutionary Council, has drawn sharp criticism
 from the democratic parties. Only the Com-
 munists and the fellow-traveling Portuguese
 Democratic Movement are expected to endorse
 the plan without substantial revisions.
 Although the lines appear tightly drawn,
 there is probably some posturing on both sides.
 Revolutionary Council insider Vasco Lourenco
 admitted last week that the council knows its
 proposals will be altered and that they represent
 only "a valid starting point." The parties also
 appear to be overstating their case in the hope of
 gaining further concessions from the military in
 the bargaining process.
 In the end, the talks should result in some
 moderating of the military's current position. Of-
 ficers of the so-called "operational" group within
 the Revolutionary Council, who share many of
 the democratic parties' views, claim they were not
 consulted on the council's proposals. During the
 talks, this group may be able to lend some sup-
 port to party efforts to move Portugal further
 along the road to representative government.

 TURKEY: STUDENTS HURT DEMIREL
 Student disorders in Turkey continue to
 aggravate political tensions and have given op-
 position leader Ecevit additional ammunition in
 his campaign to undermine Prime Minister
 Demirel's shaky coalition government.
 Violent campus clashes between extreme
 left- and right-wing student groups have assumed
 nationwide proportions in recent weeks, virtually
 paralyzing much of the system of higher educa-
 tion. Incidents resulting in serious injury have
 become commonplace, and more than 10 youths
 have been killed since the violence began last fall.
 University authorities have admitted their inabili-
 ty to cope with the problem, shifting the burden
 to the government.
 Demirel has hinted at the possibility of
 declaring martial law to combat the problem, but
 military leaders fear that such a move might only
 further polarize Turkish youth. In the likely event
 that the violence continues at its present levels,
 the government will probably rely on methods
 short of martial law. If the situation worsens,
 however, martial law may prove unavoidable.
 In recent days Ecevit and Demirel have ex-
 changed harsh accusations regarding responsibili-
 ty for the student problem. Ecevit has called
 several times for an end to Demirel's faction-
 ridden government, charging that Demirel is
 planning to use martial law both to counter the
 current problem and to intimidate his political
 opponents. Demirel has responded by accusing
 Ecevit and his Republican People's Party of en-
 couraging the campus violence as a means of
 destroying not only the government but also the
 political system.
 Ecevit has also been working against Demirel
 behind the scenes. Ecevit appears to be courting
 independent deputies as well as supporters of the
 government in hopes of unseating Demirel when
 the government's budget bill comes to a vote
 later this month or next.
 BALKAN COOPERATION: A CAUTIOUS STEP
 Middle-level officials from all Balkan coun-
 tries except Albania will meet in Athens Monday
 for initial talks on expanded regional cooperation
 in non-political fields.
 The proceedings will be marked by caution
 on all sides. Greece and Turkey, although
 members of NATO, have serious bilateral
 problems. Yugoslavia and Romania, the two
 would-be neutrals, have differing views on
 regional cooperation, and Bulgaria will be viewed
 by all others as Moscow's surrogate. The dis-
 cussions will be strictly limited to cooperation in
 such non-controversial areas as trade, com-
 munication, culture, sports, and energy.
 Greek Prime Minister Caramanlis claims that
 he is sponsoring the conference because he wants
 inter-Balkan relations to reflect the spirit of
 Helsinki, and his Foreign Ministry has taken pains
 to stress that the initiative does not portend a shift
 in Greece's traditional pro-Western orientation.
 Caramanlis' prime motive, however, may be to
 secure the support, or at least neutrality, of his
 Communist neighbors in case Greek-Turkish
 relations further deteriorate. He may also have
 sought to pre-empt any similar initiative by the
 Turks.
 Caramanlis broached the idea of the con-
 ference during his visits to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria,

 to all the Balkan states immediately after the

 earlier suspected Greek motives and feared
 repercussions at home.
 The Albanians predictably refused to attend
 because of their deep suspicions of any regional
 schemes that include Warsaw Pact countries, par-
 ticularly Bulgaria.
 By contrast, Romania, which is constantly
 searching for ways to loosen Moscow's grip on
 the Balkan members of the Warsaw Pact, is
 enthusiastic about the meeting. President
 Ceausescu would like to create an institutional

 USSR-CHINA: SOVIETS SKEPTICAL
 Moscow's skepticism of China's motives in
 releasing the Soviet helicopter crew became
 more apparent on January 16 when Pravda
 carried an article under the authoritative
 pseudonym I. Alexandrov. The article did not
 mention the release; instead, it focused on an
 anti-Soviet campaign in the Chinese press over
 the past two weeks and berated Mao and his
 "minions" for launching it. The article omitted
 even the most perfunctory reference to
 Moscow's desire for normal relations and
 suggested that the Soviets are prepared to wait
 until "true" Chinese patriots succeed in over-
 coming the "Maoist renegades who have
 usurped power" in China.
 The article seemed intended to tell the
 Soviet people not to jump to any conclusions
 regarding a change in Chinese policy toward
 the USSR as a result of Prime Minister Chou
 En-tai's death and the release of the helicopter
 crew. itmay also have been published to put
 the Chinese on notice that they will have to
 tone down their propaganda before they can
 expect a meaningful response from the Soviets.
 react jointly to any Soviet venture in the region. In
 a rare show of discord in Yugoslav-Romanian
 relations, President Tito derailed a similar
 Ceausescu initiative in the summer of 1973. The
 Yugoslav leader believes that going that far would
 only give the great powers an additional incentive
 for intervention in regional affairs.
 Belgrade is of two minds about the meeting.
 While the Yugoslavs welcome the experiment as a
 means of promoting detente and of eroding
 Europe's opposing military alliance systems, they
 strongly suspect that the Bulgarians will promote
 Soviet interests in the area. Yugoslavia will
 therefore seek to highlight Sofia's subservience to
 the  Kremlin  at  every  opportunity.
 There is also a suggestion in the Alexan-
 drov article that the Soviets are trying to dabble
 in Chinese politics. The article refers, without
 elaboration, to Chinese "patriots" who want to
 bring China back into the socialist community
 and who are of concern to Mao and his
 cohorts. The article also takes an unusual swipe
 at the leftist Politburo member Yao Wen-yuan,
 the only Chinese leader, aside from Mao,
 specifically mentioned.
 It may be that the Soviets are trying to tell
 their Chinese audience, with more specificity
 than before, exactly whom in addition to Mao
 they find objectionable. On the same day the
 Alexandrov article appeared, the Foreign
 Ministry's leading China expert, Mikhail Kapit-
 sa, derided yet another left-wing Politburo
 member, Wang Hung-wen, in an unusual inter-
 view with an Italian weekly magazine. The
 primary audience in this case was European,
 not Chinese, but Kapitsa's remarks served the
 purpose of getting on the public record
 Moscow's negative attitude toward another
 possible successor to the present Chinese
 leadership.

 USSR: FOOD SHORTAGES
 The first reports of local bread shortages have
 appeared in the Soviet press. The Ministry of
 Agriculture's newspaper, Rural Life, acknowledg-
 ed receiving complaints of shortages from a
 number of widespread rural areas, one in the
 Ukraine and five in the Russian Republic. The arti-
 cle made no mention of last year's harvest failure,
 blaming instead the mismanagement of local
 supply organizations.
 Although local shortages of various foods are
 endemic, the regularity of bread supply has been
 affected by the 1975 grain shortfall. We expect the
 overall bread supply will be adequate, but spot
 shortages will continue. The average quality of
 bread, however, is already declining as flour mills
 extract more flour from each bushel of wheat. In
 Moscow, white bread is available, but the
 appearance of loaves is deteriorating; apparently
 bakeries have not yet adjusted to using coarser
 flour. In Riga and Tallinn,. US embassy officers
 could find only tan and dark breads for sale on re-
 cent visits, indicating that bakery supplies of
 highest quality white flour in those areas have
 been drastically reduced.
 Conditions vary from city to city, however.
 Embassy officers found adequate supplies of
 white and dark bread in Odessa but little or no
 beef, mutton, or eggs. In Khabarovsk, on the
 other hand, good quality beef was available as
 well as plenty of bread, but no mutton, pork,
 eggs, or butter were seen. These shortages com-
 bined with an expected decline in availability of
 other food items make the outlook for the con-
 sumer bleak, at least for the next few months.
 The appearance of the Rural Life article
 suggests growing concern that the deteriorating
 food situation will affect morale. It was clearly in-
 tended to reassure consumers. The article
 emphasized the disciplinary measures meted out
 to the local officials held responsible for the shor-
 tages. Local supply organizations are thus put on
 notice that they must work hard to ease distribu-
 tion problems.
 Industry is also expected to help ease shor-
 tages. Bakeries have been instructed to reduce
 waste by producing smaller rolls, a measure
 suggested but not implemented after the poor
 1972 harvest. The rolls are primarily for factory
 and school cafeterias where waste is high. In addi-
 tion consumers are again being reminded that
 "bread is our greatest treasure and we must
 respect it."

 AUSTRALIA: NEW FOREIGN POLICY
 Since coming into office six weeks ago, the
 Fraser government has underscored the impor-
 tance to Australia of ties with traditional allies,
 correcting what it saw as the tendency of the
 Labor government to ignore such ties in the pur-
 suit of Australian nationalism. The Liberal-Coun-
 try government will not return to the
 patron-client relationship with the US of earlier
 Liberal-Country administrations. The more in-
 dependent stance adopted by the Whitlam
 government is popular in Australia, and the Fraser
 government will maintain much of it. Fraser has
 plainly stated, however, that there will be renew-
 ed emphasis on ties with the US and that there is
 no need to feel defensive about this.
 Fraser's first move to strengthen the US con-
 nection was to back the US-UK naval base on
 Diego Garcia Island in the Indian Ocean. The
 Whitlam government had been outspoken in op-
 position to the project and had supported an In-
 dian Ocean "zone of peace," appealing to world
 navies to stay out of the area. Fraser belittled the
 Whitlam proposal for ignoring the reality of the
 new Soviet naval buildup there.
 Canberra will also push ahead with the con-
 struction of a new naval base on the Indian Ocean
 coast of western Australia. Fraser's defense
 minister has announced that Australia's allies will
 be given access to this facility. Fraser is also rever-
 sing the Whitlam government's refusal to permit
 port calls by US nuclear-powered warships.
 Canberra intends to lift the ban as soon as en-
 vironmental safeguards are improved.
 The new government is already working on
 ways to improve Australia's ties in the Far East. It is
 supporting the members of the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in their efforts
 to build up that organization, but is trying to do so
 in ways that will not be interpreted as intruding
 into ASEAN affairs-a criticism frequently leveled
 at the Whitlam government.
 The government endorses Labor's opening of
 relations with Peking, and Fraser plans to visit
 Prime Minister Fraser
 Peking and Tokyo this spring, before coming to
 Washington. The government hopes to repair the
 damage to relations with Japan caused by the
 restrictive investment and trade policies of the
 Whitlam government. To this end, Deputy Prime
 Minister Anthony will visit Japan next month.
 Although the Japanese may discern a more
 hospitable investment climate, Canberra is reluc-
 tant to relax its protective tariffs, believing that

 Maintaining congenial   relations with
 Australia's  closet  Far  Eastern  neighbor, In-
 donesia, is proving to be the Fraser ad-
 ministration's first difficult foreign policy
 problem. Australian governments consistently
 place considerable importance on friendly ties
 with their populous northern neighbor, but In-
 donesia's military intervention in East Timor has
 injected a major complication. Although both
 Whitlam and Fraser had clearly signaled their ap-
 proval of a quick Indonesian take-over, the
 take-over has not been quick, and both the Labor
 and the Liberal-Country governments have felt
 compelled to cater to the Australian public's sym-
 pathy for the leftist Fretilin forces' fight for in-
 dependence.
 The Fraser government is particularly em-
 barrassed by a leak to the press of a confidential
 recommendation from the Australian ambassador
 in Jakarta that Canberra accept Timor's integra-
 tion into Indonesia-a recommendation that has
 now been publicly rejected by Fraser. Foreign
 Minister Peacock tried to minimize the problem
 this week following a brief visit to Jakarta, but
 Australian sympathy for Fretilin has significantly
 complicated Canberra's dialogue with Jakarta.
 The Fraser government is backtracking on
 other Whitlam innovations. In addition to public-
 ly supporting Chinese criticism of Soviet naval ac-
 tivities in the Indian Ocean, the Prime Minister
 has disavowed Labor's recognition of Soviet
 claims to the three Baltic states, a gesture for
 domestic political gain that must strike Moscow as
 a peculiarly gratuitous slap. Moscow in fact has
 accused Fraser of resurrecting cold war rhetoric.
 The new government is apparently also
 departing from Labor's ambivalent Middle East
 policy. Whitlam had supported Israel's right to
 UN membership, but then met with a PLO
 representative invited to Australia by Labor lef-
 tists, antagonizing both Arabs and Israelis. Fraser
 publicly promises to support Israel.
 On the economic front, the new administra-
 tion will provide a somewhat more favorable in-
 vestment climate and greater incentives for
 development of the country's energy resources.
 Although the Liberal-Country government's
 foreign investment objective is the same as
 Labor's-50 percent Australian equity in new
 development projects-the new government is
 likely to be more flexible in applying existing
 guidelines.
 Direct government involvement in the
 mineral and energy field will be greatly reduced
 by the Fraser government, a development which
 will tend to reassure potential foreign investors.
 Canberra has already announced plans to divest
 itself of investments acquired by the Whitlam
 government through the now defunct Petroleum
 and Minerals Authority, including coal, copper,
 and natural gas projects.
 Development of Australia's massive uranium
 deposits will be encouraged by the Fraser govern-
 ment. The new administration has said it will per-
 mit exports of uranium oxide, but will watch
 carefully to ensure that domestic needs are met
 and a reasonable return is obtained. The Labor
 government had banned uranium exports,
 awaiting higher prices.
 Development of Australia's other energy
 resources should also get a boost from the new
 government. The Fraser government has promis-
 ed incentives for oil exploration and production
 including a full write-off of exploration costs
 against current income, and a special investment
 allowance for development costs. The Whitlam
 government's energy policies had caused oil ex-
 ploration to come to a virtual standstill-only 14
 oil wells were drilled during the first nine months
 of 1975, compared to 135 in 1972.

 CHINA: THE ECONOMY IN 1975
 While operating more smoothly in 1975 than
 in 1974, the Chinese economy did not produce
 the banner year with which Peking had hoped to
 end the fourth five-year plan.

 The Chinese press has reported only sparsely
 on economic performance in 1975 and on the
 outcome of the five-year plan. For example, the
 New Year's day editorial in People's Daily- nor-
 mally the  vehicle for an economic
 stocktaking-claimed only that industry and
 agriculture had fulfilled the five-year plan goals;
 Peking has never made these goals public. Based
 on sketchy information, our preliminary estimates
 for 1975 are that:
 ?  industrial production rose by about 10
 percent, compared with only 5 percent in 1974;
 ?  grain output was roughly the same as
 the record 255 to 260 million tons harvested
 the previous year;
 ?  imports remained at the 1974 level of
 $7.5 billion; exports rose from $6.5 billion to
 $7 billion.
 The strong industrial advance was largely at-
 tributable to the easing of factional wrangling and
 labor unrest that had disrupted factories and
 mines in 1974. The fastest growth continued to be
 in the petroleum sector, with output of crude oil
 rising to 1.6 million barrels per day-a jump of
 more than 20 percent. Industrial performance was
 again marred, however, by persisting bottlenecks
 in the key steel and coal industries. The People's
 Republic continued to add industrial capacity by
 commissioning major new plants of both foreign
 and domestic origin.
 The performance of agriculture was generally
 disappointing. Only soybeans and such secondary
 crops as oilseeds, sugar, and tobacco showed
 gains. Grain production was about the same as
 1974 while cotton output was lower. The record
 harvest of 1974 permitted Peking to cut grain im-
 ports to less than 4 million tons last year, down
 from 7 million tons in 1974.

 A curb on imports reduced China's un-
 precedented $1-billion trade deficit in 1974 to
 about $500 million last year. Japan remained the
 top trading partner. Chinese imports from the !US
 plummeted from $949 million in 1974 to $320
 million in 1975, the result of reduced Chinese
 purchases of US agricultural products. Chinese
 exports to the US moved up to $155 million, com-
 pared with $115 million in 1974.
 At the meeting of the National People's
 Congress a year ago, Premier Chou En-lai laid out
 a long-range economic program concentrating
 resources on agricultural development. His
 successor, Teng Hsiao-ping, is a tough and ex-
 perienced administrator and is likely to continue
 programs formulated by Chou. For the short run
 at least, we do not expect any radical revisions in
 economic plans or policies.

 MALAYSIA: AN ORDERLY SUCCESSION
 Newly installed Prime Minister Hussein Onn
 has stressed that he will continue the moderate
 racial policies of the late Prime Minister Razak in
 an attempt to keep the lid on the ever-present
 racial tensions in Malaysia. Razak's sudden death
 last week had immediately brought into question
 the durability of his communal policies, which
 had kept racial animosities in check. Although
 committed to giving the Malays a greater share in
 the Chinese-dominated economy, Razak had
 pursued this goal with a sufficiently measured
 pace to avoid alienating the Chinese. Most
 Malaysians accept Hussein as a moderate on race,
 in the mold of Razak.
 Hussein has a history of heart trouble,
 however, prompting doubts about how long he
 can remain in office. The announcement by
 Hussein's physician that the new Prime Minister
 has made a good recovery and is fit will be regard-
 ed with skepticism by politicians and by a public
 C~,- "? - k 7
 that was kept in the dark about his predecessor's
 illness.
 Doubts about Hussein's health will probably
 increase the maneuvering among contenders for
 eventual leadership. Although many Malay
 politicians generally accept the national necessity
 of avoiding communal strife, some, in their quest
 for support, will be tempted to appeal to Malay
 racism. The large Malaysian Chinese community
 will have doubts, moreover, whether any of the
 potential successors to Hussein possess the
 political adroitness and strength to keep Malay
 pressures against the Chinese within bounds.
 The immediate political question requiring a
 decision is the selection of a new deputy prime
 minister to replace Hussein. Underscoring the
 orderliness of the succession, Hussein says he is in
 no hurry to appoint his deputy; he probably has
 not yet made a choice between the two top con-
 tenders, Agriculture Minister Ghafar Baba and

 Education Minister Mahathir. Hussein could also
 reach deeper into the party hierarchy to find a
 more acceptable candidate.
 Hussein has a reputation for quiet com-
 petence and, if his health holds up, could provide
 a period of-good management that would redress
 some of the slackness and drift that marked the
 final two years of the Razak administration. The
 new Prime Minister is more pro-Western than his
 predecessor and will be less inclined to pursue
 nonalignment as the centerpiece of Malaysian
 foreign policy. His focus will be in working with
 Malaysia's neighbors in making the Association of
 Southeast Asian Nations a significant re ion
 organization.
 NORTH KOREA: DEBT DEFAULT
 North Korea's large-scale default on its debts
 to Japan and the West-the first by a Communist
 country-has derailed Pyongyang's moderniza-
 tion plans based on the acquisition of advanced
 Western equipment.
 In the early 1970s Pyongyang decided to
 reduce its economic dependence on the Com-
 munist countries as part of a broader reorienta-
 tion of its foreign policy. Since then, North Korea
 has purchased $600 million worth of industrial
 plants and related equipment from Japan and
 Western Europe. Imports from the West jumped
 sharply in 1973-74 because of expanded plant
 deliveries and  unexpected large grain re-
 quirements following poor harvests. Plant imports
 were financed by medium-term credits and grain
 imports by short-term credits.
 Repayments on these debts were already tax-
 ing Pyongyang's ability to earn foreign exchange
 when the recession in the West cut demand and
 prices for nonferrous metals, North Korea's major
 exports. The result was an unmanageable $500--
 million hard currency trade deficit in 1974. In late
 1974 North Korea began to default on its
 payments. By early 1975 the total amount of the
 debts in arrears to Japan and Western Europe
 reached $200-$300 million. Rescheduling of some
 debts and offsetting new defaults have kept total
 arrears at roughly this level.
 Japan and a number of West European coun-
 tries have suspended further credit guarantees for
 North Korea. Some suppliers have halted equip-
 ment deliveries until back payments are made,
 while others are demanding substantial down
 payments for new purchases. Efforts to resolve the
 payments crisis have had meager results.
 ?  About $150-$200 million in debts has
 been rescheduled by West European banks
 for one to two years.
 ?  Pyongyang has been attempting to
 pay its debts to Japan before they fall more
 than six months in arrears, to forestall a
 cutoff of exports by Tokyo.
 ?  A September 1975 meeting of
 Western creditors failed to agree on mul-
 tilateral rescheduling of North Korea's $800
 million in officially backed debts.
 ?  No hard currency relief hasbeen ob-
 tained from the Communist countries, and
 negotiations for a $200-million loan from
 Iran remain stalled.
 ?   Imports fell sharply in 1975 and the
 trade deficit was cut, but only to about $300
 million, as contractual deliveries of
 machinery and equipment on credit con-
 tinued.
 Delays in construction at several plants are
 hampering Pyongyang's industrial development
 and-because some products from these plants
 are planned for sale abroad-will retard export
 growth. No new plant contracts have been signed
 since mid-1974, and two plants already under
 contract have been scuttled. Unless North Korea
 finds some unexpected source of sizable hard
 currency credits, the debt service burden  will
 mean further curtailment of imports from the
 West and further cutbacks in its ambitious plans

 BRAZIL: GEISEL ACTS
 President Geisel this week directly challeng-
 ed military conservatives by firing one of their
 leading figures, Second Army commander
 General D'Avila Mello, army chief in the Sao
 Paulo area.
 D'Avila Mello was relieved shortly after the
 death of a civilian prisoner in a Second Army jail.
 Geisel quickly named a close associate, General
 Dilermando Gomes Monteiro, to assume the im-
 portant Sao Paulo command.
 The President probably removed D'Avila
 Mello to drive home to the conservatives that
 there are limits to their influence and to give sub-
 stance to his promise- last fall not to tolerate
 further incidents like the death in October of a
 Brazilian newsman. His death occurred also in a
 Second Army jail cell, an alleged suicide. Civilians
 and military officers alike have been edgy since
 that incident, which received international atten-
 tion.
 Since gaining the presidency nearly two years
 ago, Geisel has been trying to curb the power of
 conservative military and security officials at the
 local level. Many of them operate almost in-
 dependently of Brasilia. The President has had
 only limited success, and the effort has brought
 him into conflict with influential officers who
 think harsh measures are still needed.
 Only two weeks ago Geisel acceded to con-
 servative pressure, removing from office two op-
 position legislators who had lashed out against
 the military. The lawmakers were among three
 who had been accused by security officials of be-
 ing "Communist subversives." All three protested
 their innocence in public, but two went on to
 charge that investigators had obtained evidence
 only through torture of prisoners. Conservative
 military officers generally view criticism directed
 at them as a threat to national security and are es-
 pecially sensitive to charges of torture. There is lit-
 tle question they pressed Geisel to respond.
 The two, a state deputy and a federal con-
 gressman, were promptly removed by Geisel,
 who used a broad, all-purpose decree power to
 suspend their political rights for 10 years. The
 President did not move against the third, most
 likely because he did not raise the torture issue.
 Moreover, another congressman, who recently
 denounced the military, avoided punishment by
 issuing a retraction.
 Brazilian politicians, looking forward to
 municipal elections scheduled for later in the
 year, have mixed feelings about Geisel's struggle
 with the conservatives. They are cheered by his
 refusal to cave in, as evidenced by his strong
 move against the Second Army commander. They
 are fearful, however, that the conservatives, who
 wield  important,  if indeterminate influence,
 could redouble their efforts to undermine the
 President's position and perhaps cancel or rig the

 ECUADOR: THE NEW CABINET
 The new cabinet appointed last week by the
 three-man junta reflects a variety of political and
 economic philosophies and  perpetuates the
 divisions over policy that contributed to the
 demise of the Rodriguez Lara government early
 this month.
 Of the ministry-level members of the cabinet,
 eight are military officers; three are civilians. This
 is an increase of one civilian since the last major
 cabinet change that followed the abortive
 September 1, 1975 coup attempt.
 The appointment of Colonel Rene Vargas to
 the critical position of minister of natural
 resources is likely to be the most controversial. A
 former director of CEPE, the state-owned
 petroleum corporation, Vargas has been a consis-
 tent critic of US petroleum companies operating
 in Ecuador. During his tenure as CEPE chief, he
 formulated policies that did much to drive away
 new foreign investment.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/27: CIA-RDP79-00927A011300040001-4
 The junta's principal spokesman, Admiral
 Alfredo Poveda, has attempted to reassure the
 foreign oil companies that the junta would keep
 Vargas on a tight rein and that his appointment
 does not presage a radical shift from the more
 moderate oil policies adopted last week. Despite
 this reassurance, the appointment is ill-timed and
 will undoubtedly affect current relations between
 the ministry and Texaco-Gulf Company and dis-
 courage new exploration and exploitation of
 petroleum resources in the country.
 The  appointment  of  conservative
 businessman Cesar Robalino Gonzaga as finance
 minister does not augur well for a consistent
 government economic policy. Robalino clashed
 strongly with Vargas over oil policy when Vargas
 was head of CEPE and Robalino was subsecretary
 in the natural resources ministry. Subsequently,
 Vargas was instrumental in blocking Robalino's
 appointment to a cabinet position last August,
 and the two men are known to despise each
 other. Since the two ministers have major roles in
 formulating the government's oil-based
 economic policies, there is unlikely to be much
 innovative action as long as both men are in the
 cabinet.

 PANAMA: TORRIJOS' CUBAN VENTURE
 The first face-to-face meeting between
 Panamanian leader General Torrijos and Cuban
 Prime Minister Fidel Castro was a polished
 political show by both men. Torrijos ac-
 complished his primary objectives-to publicize
 his battle for sovereignty over the canal, focus
 attention on Castro's strong support of that cause,
 and boost his own revolutionary credentials. With
 Castro's considerable help, he was able to do this
 without giving significant new ammunition to
 critics of a new canal treaty.
 Throughout the January 10-15 visit, Torrijos'
 performance reflected concern for LIS sen-
 sitivities. He avoided railing at the US. Onlly when
 pressed at a news conference did he repeat his
 familiar stand that if peaceful routes to a new trea-
 ty were closed and he had to choose "between
 leading or crushing the people," he would lead
 them.
 In their speeches, both leaders stressed the
 need for Panama to continue to negotiate calmly
 and noted the differences between the Panama-
 nian and Cuban experiences. The controlled
 Panamanian press in many instances highlighted
 these differences.
 The final communique mirrored the publicly
 restrained approach and skirted all delicate
 topics. General statements supported self-?deter-
 mination, territorial  integrity,  and  anti-
 colonialism, but no specific mentionwas made of
 such favorite Cuban causes as Puerto Rico or
 Angola.

 PERU: ECONOMIC PROBLEMS .
 Economic  problems, compounded  by
 reported disagreements within the government
 over the future of revolutionary programs, are
 likely to cause political difficulties for President
 Morales Bermudez during the next few months.
 During a major speech on the state of the
 economy last week, Economy Minister Luis Barua
 painted a somber picture of the impact of the re-
 quired  adjustments  to  serious  balance-of-
 payments problems.     Import restrictions and
 burgeoning  government  expenditures have
 fueled domestic inflation, while agrarian re-
 form policies have resulted in food shortages.
 At the same time, Barua announced a
 number of programs aimed at stabilizing the
 country's financial situation and at easing foreign
 payments difficulties. These measures include in-
 creased taxes, wage guidelines, reduced govern-
 ment subsidies on a number of basic consumer
 goods, temporary rent controls, and additional
 controls on imports.
 Efforts to increase exports will be severely
 hindered, however, by the slow revival of the
 world market expected this year. Balance-of-
 payments problems consequently will persist and
 thus narrow the government's ability to improve
 the economic situation. Since foreign reserves
 were largely depleted in 1975 to finance the
 record $1.6-billion current account deficit, Peru is
 depending on large increases in long- and
 short-term capital borrowing to cover this year's
 projected deficits. The new austerity measures in-
 troduced by Barua are intended to encourage the
 international financial community to be
 forthcoming with financing.
 The degree of success enjoyed by the
 government in coping with the impact of world
 recession will also depend in part on the response
 by labor to the wage guidelines and increased
 prices resulting from the lowered subsidies. Labor
 strikes in the second half of 1975 further reduced
 exports, and the present calm in labor-govern-
 ment relations is likely to prevail only until the last
 official wage increase is eaten up by inflation. The
 Communist-directed General Confederation of
 Peruvian Workers, which has supported the
 political goals of the military regime, instituted its
 first general strike in December and will probably
 be even less prone to accommodation in light of
 last week's austerity measures.
