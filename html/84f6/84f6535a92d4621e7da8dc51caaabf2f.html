 SOVIET SUITIIT BEHAVIOR, REAFFIRMS LEADERSHIP COLLEGIALITY
 The Soviet leaders seemed to go out of their way at the recent
 Nixon-Brezhnev summit to demonstrate the collegial nature of the
 country's leadership organs.  In addition to U.S. reports of lengthy
 Politburo meetings in the midst of the negotiations, there were other
 signs in Soviet media that internal checks and balances were
 affecting the conduct of Soviet policy.  The media accounts of the
 talks and the official documents consistently reflected the image
 of a negotiating team on short leash, subject at all times to the
 oversight and review of the full collective leadership.  Seen
 against the background of the historical stress on collegiality
 in the Brezhnev leadership and recent signs of conflict over policy
 and personnel, these signs suggest the presence in the leadership
 of a delicate balance.
 Progress reports on the talks, the Joint communique issued on their
 completion, and the statement of party-government approval of their
 results published on 5 July were all devoid of the stress on
 Brezhnev's "personal role" in improvLng U.S.-Soviet relations aEen
 in last year's summit.  At the same time, this year the media
 accorded Foreign Minister Gromyko greater promin.nce in the
 negotiations than before.  Thus, he was listed along with Brezhnev,
 Podgornyy and Kosygin as a primary member of the Soviet delegation.
 Press coverage of the talks drew attention to the more or less
 equal role played by the four members of the Soviet "delegation."
 Thus, PRAVDA on 29 June carried three pictures of identical size
 showing Podgornyy, Kosygin, and Gromyko, respectively, signing
 documents in the name of the Soviet Union.
 Collectivity was also prominent in the protocol aspects of the
 visit.  This year Brezhnev joined Podgornyy and Kosygin in welcoming
 Nixon upon his arrival at Vnukovo airport and in seeing him off on
 3 July.  The three leaders, along with Gromyko, accompanied Nixon
 to the Boishoi Theater on the 28th. In 1972 Podgornyy and Itosygin
 were alone in performing such functions.
 Brezhnev nevertheless remained the prime Soviet negotiator on such
 thorny issues as SALT, as in 1972 and 1973.  As in 1972, official
 dispatches reported separate Brezhnev-Nixon meetings as well as those
 be

 accorded the honor of signing the arms accords on the summit's final

 Moreover, the Brezhuev mini-cult of personality, which reached
 significant prop  tions during the';recent Supreme Soviet election
 campaign, continues to be cultivated in the Soviet press.

 form; in fact, is the more accurate translation--a more literal
 English rendering of the temporal  clause would be "in the
 nearest future."  The use of the English superlative echoes
 several routine-level commentaries prior to the-Moscow summit
 whinh cited unidentified Western press reports to the effect that
 "the U.S. leaders support the idea of holding the third stage at
 the highest level and without unnecessary delay, ."
 line with its pre-summit stand, Moscow has stressed the singular
 importance of a "successful conclusion" for the conference.,
 The Russian-language version of the 5 July party-government
 approval statement was identical to the joint communique in its
 discussion of the timing of the conference.  Howe"rer, the TASS
 English translations of the two documents were at variance.  Thus
 where TASS English cited the joint communique as saying that the
 two sides were "in favor of the final stage of the conference
 taking place at an early date," the TASS English translation
 quoted the approval statement as referring to both sides working
 from the assumption that the "results of the talks will contribute
 solutions acceptable to all for the remaining problems."  In
 summit level as soon. as possible.  It has done so by playing down
 the conditional nature of the joint communique's statement that
 both sides "proceed ftom the assumption thet the results of the
 negotiations will permit the conference to be concluded at the
 highest level."  Similarly, Moscow has all but ignored the
 communique's passage which said that Moscow and Washington, in
 cooperation with other CSCE participants, would work "to find

 demands on such issues as greater freedom of movement for people
 and ideas between East and West Europe.       IZVESTIYA's first deputy
 chiefeditor and West European expert Nikolay Polyanov,'appearing
 on the.weekly Moscow radio international observers discussion
 program on the 7th, asserted that these issues we       "

 And PRAVDA's authoritative Yuriy Zhukov, in au article on the
 9th reported by TASS, charged that certain delegations at Geneva
 were complicating the negotiations and making unacceptable and
 irrelevant proposals--complaints which were almost identical to
 those made by Brezhnev in his election speech on 14 June.            Where
 Brezhnev did not single out the cultural and human contact proposals
 at Geneva as the contentious issues, Zhukov explicitly place d.the
 "unacceptable. proposals" in this category.
 The Zhukovarticle certainly made clear the hardline Soviet
 .position regarding Western demands for "concessions" on the
 dissemination of ideas and informa!aon.  Moscow has not, however,
 publicized a threatening statement by Soviet ambassador to Britain
 Nikolay Lunkov.  Addressing a London luncheon on 2 July, Lunkov
 was cited by the British press as saying that a failure of the
 CSCE could "mean a return to the past, to the tensions in the
 relations between states, to a cold war and even posiu1.y to a
 hot war."  It is not unusual for Moscow not to publicize comments
 made by its ambassadors, but Lunkov's remarks add to the Soviet
 psychological tactics surrounding their push for a conclusion
 to the conference.

 NCNA's'5 July announcement that Chou En-tai had received Senator
 Jackson in a hospital that day gave the Chinese people their first
 official word that the premier was ill.              The hospital reception
 tends to confirm that Chou's recent curtailment of protocol
 appearances has been due to poor health, rather than political
 difficulties or preoccupation with other affairs.  Chou's meeting
 with Jackson was his first appearance since 31 May, when he met
 with Malaysian Prima Minister Abdul Razak.
 By formally announcing that'Chou is in the hospital Peking appears
 to be:,signaling that Chou's health problems are serious, but that
 he is.not incapacitated and remains.able to receive selected
 foregn visitors.  A front-page picture of Chou's meeting with
 Jackson in the 6 July issue of PEOPLE'S DAILY showed Chou, dressed
 in his traditional grey tunic, smiling and looking generally fit.
 For the past several months Chou's protocol, duties have been largely
 taken over by two of his Vice Premiers, Tang Hsiao-ping and
 Li Hsien-non.  Chou's health problems first became evident during
 the Peking visit of Senegal President Senghor in early May, when he
 apparently became suddenly indisposed and missed a state dinner,
 after which Li Hsien-nien substituted for Chou at all functions
 for Senghor.  Later in May Chou failed to appear for most official
 ceremonies during visits to Peking by Pakistani Prime Minister
 Bhutto and Archbishop Makarios.  He did, however, take part in
 substantive bilateral talks with each visitor as well as in their
 separate receptions, with Mao.
 JACKSON TREATMENT.     Though NCNA's overall treatment of Jackson's
 trip confo,~med.to the usual Chinese coverage
 for such high-level visiting U.S. congressional leaders and officials,
 there were some departures from past practice--in addition to the
 exceptional meeting with Chou in the hospital--that indicated special

 Unusual Chinese interest in Jackson's views was suggested by the
 fact that Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Hai-Jung, an official
 with, reputed close ties to Mao, attended his'talks with Chinese
 officials,  Though Wang has attended` Chinese official sessions
 with President Nixon and Secretary Kissinger, she has generally

 Administration.    NCNA, in reportingJackson's     i

 MINISTER WRITING IN NEW JOURNAL CALLS FOR EXPANDED PRC TRADE
 In a landmark. article written for a new Chinese quarterly journal,
 CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE  PRC F
 ,       oreign Trade Minister Li Chiang has
 firmly advocated expanding commercial ties with other'countries.
 .Earlier this year the anti-Lin and Confucius campaign seemed to have
 produced debate,within China over the proper role of foreign trade,
 but Li's article indicates that the debate has been resolved, at
 least for now, in favor of continuing tl.- axpansionist policies of
 the past few years
 Li claimed the movement to criticize Lin and Confucius "will certainly

 Perhaps in reaction to foreign speculation over the ideological
 campaign and the effects of Chou's illness on Chinese policies, Li
 also specified that "China's foreign trade is     d               it

 benefits China has derived; from foreign trade since then.  The
 article,highlighted the "substantial" future potential in.Peking's
 foreign'trade'because of China's "vast territory, rich resources,
 large population and flourishing socialist construction," and
 stated that trade must develop "in steady steps."
 The article specified the. importance of balanced imports and
 exports in future expansion, noting in conclusion that Chinese
 imports,will be increased in step with the growth of Chinese
 exports.  It also said Peking would never follow some international
 trade practices allegedly used by the Soviet Union, including attempts
 to attract foreign capital, exploiting domestic or foreign resources
 in conjunction with other countries, use of joint management with
 foreign countries, and efforts to "grovel for  foreign loan."
 BACKGROUND     At the height of the anti-Confucius campaign early
 this year, complaints over the growing influx of
 foreign products into China had appeared in the Chinese media.
 Since then, however, Chinese leaders and media comment, have token
 pains to show that Pe"ing's keen'interest of.recent years in
 expanded foreign trade remains on course.*  Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-pang, in setting forth a position, in favor of equitable
 international trade at the 10 April UN special session on raw
 materials, said that Peking's advocacy of economic self-reliance
 "in no way means 'self seclusion."'  In May the Chinese leadership
 and media gave heavy attention to a French industrial exhibit then
 in Peking, while last month NCNA went out of its way to cite a

 DPRK. PRC NOTE ANNIVERSARY OF NORTH-SOUTH UNITY DECLARATION
 DPRK comment on the anniversary of the 4 July 1972 North-South
 declaration on reunification was more extensive and took a harsher
 tone this year than in 1973, reflecting, the current stalemate in
 North-South relations.  Unlike last year, when only a NODONG SINMUN
 editorial marked the event, this time the North used the occasion
 to denounce, the ROK and the United States in a number of forums,
 including a NODONG SINMUN editorial and editorial article, a
 Pyongyang rally attended by several Political Committee members,
 and a statement by' the North's cochairman at the North-South talks.
 Reflecting the current gloomy state of North-South relations,
 Cochairman Kim went beyond the North's normal complaint in recent
 months that relations were "returning" to a situation like that
 before the ,4 July 'Joint statement, declaring that they had "returned."
 .Speaking at the Pyongyang rally, Central Committee member Yang
 Hyong-sop went nearly as far, saying relations had "virtually
 returned" to the predialog state.
 The Pak government came in for greatly increased vilification this
 year.  Only the statement by Cochairman Kim was limited to last
 year's practice of referring to the South Korean "side" or "authorities,
 which -as. Pyongyangway of conforming to the joint statement's
 stipulation that mutual slander be halted'.  The NODONG SINMUN editorial
 article went so far as to call Pak a "rank traitor" and a "wretch."
 The United States and Japan also came in for criticism, but on standard
 terms.
 PEKING     Chinese treatment of the anniversary, like North Korea's,
 .was more extensive and at a higher level than last year,
 highlighted by a PEOPLE'S DAILY editorial commemorating not only the
 4.July anniversary but also the first. anniversary of Kim Il-song's
 23 June speech proposing a five-point reunification program.  The
 4 July editorial carried the first Chinese demand in several years
 for thet "immediate" withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea, but
 the demand was not accompanied by any increase in Peking criticism
 of the Uid .,ed States.*  Evidence that the Chinese were carefully

 tailoring their comment to make the point that they feel the time
 has come for . movement on the troop issue was the fact that Peking
 made no other reference to the United States in the editorial, and
 Peking replays of DPRK pronouncements carefully excised most U.S.
 references.
 Coinciding with this year's expanded treatment was a 3 July Peking
 .rally attended by Peking chief and Politburo member Wu Te in support
 of Kim 11-song's three principles and five-point program for reunif i-
 cation.  The rally was the first Korean support rally held in China
 since July 1971 to be attended by a leader of We rank.  The Peking
 gathering concentrated its fire on ROK President Pak, with few
 references to the United States.
 In replaying the Kim statement and the Pyongyang rally speech by
 Yang Hyong-sop, Peking carefully edited their remarks to exclude
 all criticism of Japan and most of their U.S. references. All of
 Kim's references to the United States were omitted except for his
 demand for U.S. troop withdrawal.  With Yang's speech Peking went
 even further, omitting all U.S. references, including Yang's call
 for the South Korean people to demand the "unconditional, immediate
 withdrawal" of U.S. troops.

 BULGARIA, YUGOSLAVIA'CLASH ON MACEDONIAN ISSUE AT UN SEMINAR
 successive days TANJUG reported highly unusual remarks by the
 Bulgarian representative defending'his country's position and
 criticizing that of Yugoslavia and the lengthy reply of the
 Yugoslav representative.  Monitored Sofia media have ignored the
 incident.
 Yugoslavia appears to have taken advantage of its role as host
 for A UN seminar on national minorities to draw attention to its
 perennial dispute with Bulgaria.over the Macedonian issue.  On
 discussion and by the remarks of the seminar chairman, a Yugoslav
 TANJUG's coverage of the incident appears to be objective.  In
 an apparently straightforward account on 3 July the news agency
 reported without comment the Bulgarian representative's claims
 .that books and other materials handed out by the Yugoslavs at
 .the seminar being held in Ohrid, Macedonia, contained misrepresenta-
 tions of Bulgarian policy on the Macedonian situation.                   Denying the
 existence of a Macedonian minority in Bulgaria, he warned against:
 Yugoslav "interference" in Bulgarian internal affairs and against
 linking the Macedonian question to general bilateral cooperation

 Yugoslav representative--a refutation repeating the standard Yugoslav
 positions.  This was followed, according, to TANJUG, by remarks from

 ARAB-ISRAELI  ISSUE
 MOSCOW CRITICIZES "MISTAKES" OF PALESTINIAN MOVEMENT
 Although Moscow is continuing to insist on the need for Palestinian
 representation at the Geneva conference, a 9 July Arabic-language
 broadcast by the "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress has revived
 past criticisms of disorganization and mistakes in tha Palestinian
 resistance movement.  Although this is at the lowest level of Soviet
 propaganda, it suggests some Soviet misgivings about supporting a
 fractured and squabbling Palestinian delegation at the peace
 conference.
 Moscow would seam to be trying to score points with the Arabs by
 continuing to espouse recognition of Palestinian rights as a key
 point in any Mideast settlement, while simultaneously equivocating on
 the problem of a Palestinian role in Geneva.  The Arabic-language
 service of Moscow radio has skirted the statement in the joint
 U.S.-Soviet communique that the question of "other participants" in
 the Geneva conference should be discussed at the conference itself.
 In agreeing to this language, Moscow seemingly backed off from its
 insist.3nce on Palestinian representation.  TASS commentator Kornilov
 on the 4th went out of his way to demonstrate that the Soviet position
 on thib issue has snot changed when he said he had "learned from well-
 informed circles" that in the U.S.-Soviet summit talks the USSR
 stressed the need for stepping hp the reneva proceedings, with the
 participation "from the very beginning" of Palestinian representatives.
 And IZVBSTIYA, as reported by TASS on the 8th, declared that the
 Palestinian Arabs ahouRd have the possibility to shape their own
 destiny, and went on to say that the Geneva rarference "can and
 should become" the most suitable venue for the discussion of their
 lawful rights.
 Soviet difficulties with the disorganized Palestinians were made
 clear in Radio Peace and Progress' list of complaints against the
 movement.  The commentary "regretfully admitted" that the Palestinians'
 "imperialist and Zionist" enemies were exploiting "all the
 organizational mistakes" of the movement, one of the "biggest and
 most serious" mistakes being that of opening fedayeen ranks to
 "everybody and his brother."  The commentary repeated criticism
 expressed in a major PRAVDA analysis of the Palestinian movement in
 August 1972, complaining of the absence of a political party or .maited
 mass organization combining military activity with political
 enlightenment among the refugees and Arabs living in the occupied
 territories_

 Radio Peace and Progress also indirectly criticised fedayean
 operations conducted trom Lebanon in assailing the Chinese slogan
 that power comes out of tta barrel of a gun.  This idea, the
 commentary said,  loads  to mistakes in assessing the movement's
 capabilities at "times of fluctuation," isolates the moderate
 elements calling for a peaceful political sattlemant, and alienates
 certain sections of the population of Arab countries hosting the
 Palestinian movement.
 Undertones of annoyance'over Palestinian disunity were more
 guardedly &*groaned in a Bukharnv NSW TIME article (No. 23, 21 June)
 on the recent Palestine National Council seas hn in Cairo. While
 Bukharow put the best fade on the results of the session, he
 suggested dissatisfaction in'conciuding that the resistance move-
 ment would be the' wore??euNco4ssful the more united it became, the
 more closely, it cooperated. with than:,"progiassive" Arab countries,,
 and "the  or. realistically it approaches the political solution"

 ,con emn the extreme left for "disruptive and provocative
 activity," the main danger for Portugal is from conservative

 threat from the right, against reaction, against fascism."
 ,Both Moscow and the PCP have been reluctant to analyze and comment

 id
 PCP, who stressed that an economic crisis could become the "main
 danger" to Portugal's achieving democracy and that the communists
 regard preventing such a crisis no "extremely important."  Several
 other TASS items have carried denunciations of "opportunist elemental'
 and extremists on both the political right and far, left, cautioning
 that these circles seek to profit from "anarchy and economic chaos."
 COUNTERCOUP     In publicizing PCP denunciations of extremism,
 DANGER          Moscow has continued, albeit in a subdued manner,
 to press a standing theme in its poet-coup treat-
 ment of.eortuguese events, namely that "forces of reaction" stand
 ever rea, to return the country to a dictatorship.  TASS on 21 June,
 for example, quoted Alvaro Cunhal in an interview with the French
 newspaper LE FIGARO as raising the specter of Allende's overthrow
 in Chile, applying that episode to the current Portuguese situation
 by warning that "Portuguese reaction has borrowed the experience
 of Chilean reaction in regard to economic pressure." Cunhal did
 not pursue the analogy with Chile, however, and was careful to
 note that "the Portuguese army is not the Chilean army."  On
 another occasion TASS quoted Cunhal'as saying that although the
 communists    d~

 democratization or a return to dictatorship.              The implications

 already agreed toraistablish diplomatic relations on 31 May.
 Subsequent Soviet comment has praised the establishment of
 Soviet-F r'Luguese relations, emphaaizing that it was a "logical"
 developm!en;t after the 25 April coup.
 Over the past several treks Moscow and ;'eking comment on Portugal `'.a
 relations with its Afrfean colonies has r;--?"led diverging views
 about the significance','of the 25 April coup in Lisbon for the
 territories of Guinea-Biezau, Ango;La, and Mozambique.  Moscow's
 position, reflected in Soviet leadership statements and media
 comment, as well as in the fact that diplomatic relations were
 established with Portugal on 9 June, has bean to advocate full
 independence for the three territories and express cautious
 optimism over the prospects for Lisbon negotiating an end to its
 colonial rule.  The Chinese, on the other hand, while also
 stressing the necessity of unconditional independence for the
 territories, have predictably taken a tougher position than the
 Soviets, urging continued armed struggle by the liberation move-
 ments until independence is achieved.
 MOSCOW    An indicat,.on of Moscow's assessment of the Spinola
 government's policies for the three colonies came in
 the Soviet leaders." official greeting to the Organization of
 African Unity (OAU)'summit conference held recently in Mogadiscio,
 Somalia. The text of the message from Podgornyy and Kosygin,
 published in PRAVDA on 14 June, included a passage crediting the
 overthrow of Caetano with creating "new favorable conditions for
 the immediate implementation of the inalienable right of the
 peoples of these countries to sovereign and independent development."
 It also attributed the removal of the "fascist regime" in Portugal
 in large measure to they offorti. of liberation movements in Africa
 and implied that the now government was not only ideologically
 different from the old, but was also likely to recognize the
 costliness of continued rule over these territories.

 for the colonies could lead to a Rhodesia-style white settler
 breakaway, Kudryavtsev nevertheless concluded with the observation
 that new Portuguese Foreign Minister Soares' moderate statements
 on cooperating with the United Nations to find a a',lutiont  the
 colonial problem "inspires us with a certain hope'", that
 solution may be found.
 The Soviets have responded contemptuously to ;.ghat they regard as
 a,.tnolly irresponsible Chinese position or. the liberation move-
 ments in Portugr' 3e Africa since the ouster of Caetano.  A Moscow
 broadcast to Africa on 28 June noted that in "the complicated
 situation that has arisen in Portugal and its colonies, extremism
 is dangerous," and accused "Maoists and groupings close to them"
 of  acting in the interests of fascism and colonialism" by adopting
 an inflexible position on liberation movement policie4. This is
 consistent with'what the Soviets have criticized as a generally
 anti-Soviet policy by Peking in the less-developed countries of
 Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  An article by an analyst of
 Chinese foreign policy, G. Apalin, in SOVIET RUSSIA of 20 June,
 for example, rebuked the Peking leadership for "attempting to
 drive a wedge" between the USSR and its friends in the Third
 World.
 PEKING     Chinese interpretations of Portuguese Africa's future
 prospects reflect skepticism about the intentions of
 .the Spinola regime while criticizing the USSR for establishing
 diplomatic relations with Portugal.  Foreign Minister Chi Peng-fel,
 in a 1 July banquet speech for a visiting Gabonese delegation,
 said that until Portugal grants unconditional, "total" independence
 to its territories, the OAU summit conference request that no
 state recognize the Spinola government would receive the resolute
 support of "the Chinese Government and people."  Recent Chinese
 comment has taken pains to stress the insistence of the Guinea-
 Bissau and Mozambique liberation movements on continued "armed
 struggle" for complete independence.  NCNA observed on 2 July
 that despite the military coup, "the colonial wars waged by
 Portugal in Africa have not ceased."
 Pekin h'As-ilso criticized the Soviet stance:  NCNA on 30 June
 sluArply attacI d the "Soviet social-imperialists" for having
 "hastily established relations with Portugal" in "total disregard
 of the just voice of the African countries." Unlike the Soviet
 leadership message to the OAU summit, the greeting from Chou En-lat.,
 ignored the changes in the Portuguese African situation.  His
 message, released by NCNA on 11 June, repeatedly referred to "great-
 power hegemonism
