 LEBANON   1,L
 The Syrians called at least a temporary
 halt this week to their offensive in
 Lebanon's central mountains after
 pushing their Palestinian and leftist adver-
 saries out of several key strongpoints by
 October 1. The pause-ordered ostensibly
 to permit further negotiations-seems
 designed to fix the blame primarily on
 Palestinian intransigence for the con-
 tinuing political impasse.
 At present, the Syrians appear bent
 more on sowing dissension among their
 opponents and eroding Yasir Arafat's
 leadership position within the Palestine
 Liberation Organization than on ob-
 taining an acceptable political settlement.
 Damascus media have called increasingly
 for Arafat's removal as head of the PLO
 and Fatah and have implied that he has
 become the main obstacle in the way of a
 Syrian-Palestinian  reconciliation.  The
 Syrians reportedly demanded a change in
 the leadership of the Palestinian move-
 ment as a condition for a new cease-fire
 this week.
 By presenting such an unpalatable con-
 dition, the Syrians appear to be
 deliberately courting Arafat's rejection;
 they are making it impossible for him to
 salvage any Palestinian independence in
 Lebanon and still reach an accommoda-
 The Syrians may try to take A ay  lef-
 tist leader Kamal Jumblatt's headquarters
 astride the major Beirut-Damascus road,
 where the Palestinians and their leftist
 allies are apparently well dug in. Or they
 may attempt to capture the northern port
 of Tripoli, where they and the Christians
 have recently reinforced their positions.
 Because such assaults would result in
 heavy casualties, however, the Syrians ap-
 parently are leaning in favor of an offen-
 sive south and west from Jazzin, aimed
 presumably at isolating the Palestinian
 strongholds at Sidon, Tyre, and
 Nabatiyah and cutting them off from the
 Palestinians' main bastion in west Beirut.
 According to press reports, Syrian
 Deputy Defense Minister Jamil met this
 week with several local Lebanese officials,
 political leaders and delegations from
 southern Lebanon; the Lebanese allegedly
 BEIRUT
 West BeirJ
 requested the entry of Syrian troops and
 those of the Syrian-sponsored Lebanese
 "vanguard" army to restore security. The
 Syrians used such local appeals earlier
 this year to justify their occupation of the
 Bekaa Valley.
 The Egyptians are still trying to keep
 themselves in the negotiating picture.
 Foreign Minister Fahmi paid a visit to
 Paris on short notice late last week, ap-
 parently to request France to send troops
 to Lebanon to buttress the Arab League
 security forces already there. France con-

 tinues to condition any French role on the
 agreement of all parties to the conflict.
 The proposal, nevertheless, reportedly
 irritated the Saudis, who appear to hold
 President Sadat primarily responsible for
 the collapse of their efforts to convene a
 mini-summit on Lebanon. Sadat, still in a
 bitter anti-Syrian mood, has turned a deaf
 ear to Saudi complaints.
 Soviet Initiatives
 The  oviet proposal of October 1 for a
 resumption this month or next of the
 Geneva conference on the Middle East
 caps several weeks of Soviet diplomatic
 activity.
 The call for a return to Geneva is
 similar to a Soviet proposal last April. At
 that time, Moscow was concerned that

 tian friendship treaty-together with the

 RHODESIA 1 -i c, 17
 Unity talks between tw~ of the major
 Rhodesian nationalist factions apparently
 have made little progress so far. The talks
 between the Zitlibabwe African National
 Union and the Zimbabwe African
 People's Union-the two groups that
 have guerrillas in the field-are now tak-
 ing place in Maputo and are likely to shift
 to Dar es Salaam soon.
 ZAPU,  which  has  a  stronger
 organizational structure inside Rhodesia
 than does ZANU, is said to be insisting
 that political unity must be achieved
 before military forces can be united.
 ZANU, which commands the loyalty of
 most of the guerrillas, refuses to enter into
 anything but a loose political alliance.
 ZANU leaders fear that political unity
 would only benefit ZAPU leader Joshua
 Nkomo, whom they have long distrusted.
 ZANU representatives also met last
 week in Lusaka with representatives of
 Lebanon-had created the impression
 that the USSR was on the outside looking
 in.
 The Soviets now propose:
 ? A conference in two stages, the
 first dealing with organizational and
 procedural problems and the second
 with substantive issues.
 ? Palestinian attendance "on an
 equal footing from the very out-
 set"-phrasing which is far more sup-
 portive of the PLO's role than the
 Soviet proposal in April.
 ? An agenda that includes discus-
 sion of Israeli withdrawal from all oc-
 cupied Arab territories and the es-
 tablishment of a Palestinian state.
 The Soviet statement makes a point of
 appealing to Israel by including agenda
 items  that stress  "appropriate inter-
 national guarantees" for Israel's existence
 Muzorewa had been left out of the
 original unity talks by the other factions
 and  by  the  "front-line"  African
 presidents. Muzorewa's welcome home
 last Sunday by a large and enthusiastic
 crowd, after over a year of self-imposed
 exile, suggests that he hopes to use his
 political following to win a key role in
 settlement talks.
 The guerrilla leaders, as distinct from
 the nationalist politicians, continue to
 take a hard line in public on a settlement.
 At a press conference in Maputo last
 week, a guerrilla leader said that the
 fighting will continue until the Smith
 government is prepared to surrender un-
 conditionally. Guerrilla activities in
 eastern Rhodesia have continued largely
 unabated in recent days.
 and security as well as an end to the state
 of war between Arabs and Israelis. The
 Soviet proposal does not imply, as did the
 one last April, that a peace settlement
 would lead to the re-establishment of
 diplomatic relations with Israel.
 The Soviets want to be part of any ma-
 jor negotiating activity in the Middle
 East. Their latest actions also suggest they
 believe the Lebanese situation is in a
 critical phase-especially after the Syrian
 offensive  that began on  September
 28-and that it will further complicate
 Soviet relations with both Syrians and
 Palestinians.
 Moscow's proposal follows a flurry of
 diplomatic activity that began three weeks
 ago:
 ? An authoritative article that
 appeared in Pravda on September 8
 announced a more evenhanded policy
 toward Syrians and Palestinians.
 ? The  Soviets  consulted  in
 mid-September with PLO leaders
 Arafat in Beirut and Qaddumi in
 ? Geneva conference representative
 Vinogradov visited Syria two weeks
 ago to get Damascus' support for the
 Soviet initiative. The Soviets also
 made diplomatic contacts with other
 Arab states, including Egypt and Iraq.
 The USSR's Geneva exercise has been
 a sterile one in the past, and Arab-Israeli
 reaction thus far indicates that the Soviets
 will be no more successful this time.
 ? A Soviet embassy official in Cairo
 remarked privately on October 4 that
 Egypt was "not particularly
 enthusiastic" about the Soviet
 proposal.
 ? Syrian President Asad, in an in-
 terview that appeared on the day of the
 Soviet proposal, was unusually critical
 of the USSR.
 ? Israeli officials have dismissed the
 Soviet initiative as "nothing new."

 It is not yet clear whether the Thai
 military's assumption of power on Oc-
 tober 6 was an outright coup or a move in-
 vited by a frustrated and weary prime
 minister.
 In an address to the nation late on Oc-
 tober 6, however, Admiral Sa-ngat, leader
 of the newly formed Administration
 Reform Party-controlled by the
 military
 is explanation that the
 armed forces had felt it necessary to act to
 restore order and to eliminate alleged
 communists in the government suggests
 that the military might have taken the in-
 itiative and forced Seni's hand.
 At the same time, military leaders are
 The Administration Reform Party has
 dissolved parliament and banned political
 parties, but has pledged to respect the
 Thai people's "aspiration to preserve the
 democratic form of government."
 One of the military administrators' first
 acts was to announce that all treaty com-
 mitments would be respected and good
 relations with all countries promoted.
 Both Sa-ngat and Kamon favor close
 Thai-US military relations and were
 troubled by the recent US withdrawals. It
 is possible that the military leaders will
 play down, if not reverse, the Seni
 government's emphasis on working out an
 cR 5
 accommodation with Vietnam.
 Both Sa-ngat and Kamon have been
 regarded as nonpolitical, highly
 professional military officers with high
 standards of personal honesty. Their
 reputations will lend credence to
 Sa-ngat's public statement that he and his
 colleagues do not aspire to hold power for
 an extended period. (An assessment of the
 fragile nature of parliamentary
 democracy in Thailand appears in the
 feature section of this publication.)

 CHINA
 The Chinese marked National Day on
 October 1 with a facade of unity amid
 signs of continuing dissension within the
 leadership. The Peking-based members of
 the Politburo avoided festive activities but
 did appear at a meeting attended by 400
 ITALY  ~5'  2
 Prime Minister Andreotti began this
 week to seek parliamentary support for
 key portions of the economic stabilization
 program that his Christian Democratic
 minority government has been working on
 since August. The Communists, whose
 cooperation in Parliament is essential to
 Andreotti's survival, have so far shown a
 willingness to work with the Prime
 Minister. At the same time, they are
 clearly determined to shift economic and
 fiscal decision-making as much as possi-
 ble to the legislature. Such a shift would
 enable the Communists to exert max-
 imum influence on Andreotti's program.
 Andreotti has asked Parliament to con-
 sider two proposals, which form the bare
 minimum for any effective stabilization
 representatives of the "masses."
 The leaders were listed in their normal
 protocol order, projecting an image of un-
 ity and continuity, and the meeting itself
 was billed as a symbol of unity between
 the leadership and the people. Politburo
 members from the provinces, who had ap-
 parently remained in Peking after Mao's
 funeral for a Politburo meeting, returned
 to their home bases for the holiday.
 In a break with past practice, Peking's
 three major publications did not issue a
 joint editorial for National Day. Instead,
 People's Daily published an editorial of its
 own that called for studying Mao's works
 and made only passing reference to the
 campaign against Teng Hsiao-ping. That
 the other two major publications, which
 usually collaborate in joint editorials, did
 not lend their weight to this editorial
 could indicate some dissatisfaction with
 its content.
 The editorial's treatment of Teng was
 effort. To try to dampen inflationary
 pressures, he is requesting that automatic
 cost-of-living allowances be reduced for
 the upper 20 to 25 percent of wage
 earners, with a complete blockage of the
 allowances for the highest paid workers.
 Andreotti also wants to increase prices
 for many public services and
 government-controlled  commodities;
 some of the funds raised by hiking public
 service charges would be used to help
 finance a controversial industrial moder-
 nization and development program, the
 details of which Andreotti has not yet dis-
 closed.
 The  Communists'  inclination  to
 cooperate with Andreotti is illustrated by
 the effort the Communist-dominated un-
 ions apparently made to encourage Italy's
 major labor federation to agree in princi-
 ple this week to Andreotti's proposed
 limitation on cost-of-living increases.
 Ironically, the unions dominated by An-
 dreotti's Christian Democrats were less
 receptive because of their larger propor-
 tion of highly paid workers.
 much milder than some recent articles
 that suggest the party's left wing is trying
 to breathe new life into the criticism cam-
 paign. There may also have been some
 disagreement over the editorial's
 characterization of Mao as pre-eminent
 among communist theoreticians. This was
 in contrast to a joint editorial by the three
 publications, issued on September 16, that
 named Mao as only one among several
 communist giants.
 In another possible sign of conflict
 among the leadership, an article in the
 current issue of Red Flag resurrects a
 quotation from the disgraced former
 defense minister Lin Piao. This prominent
 use of a well-known Lin statement is the
 latest of several indications that Lin and
 the "coup" with which he was associated
 remain a contentious issue and that there
 is continued unhappiness over the army's
 loss of prestige since Lin's fall.
 The response of the Communists to An-
 dreotti's proposed price increases, on the
 other hand, demonstrates that the party's
 price for continued cooperation is a larger
 role for Parliament in policy formation.
 Andreotti initially tried to raise certain
 prices by decree, as the government is
 legally empowered to do. The Com-
 munists, however, are holding Andreotti
 to an earlier pledge to consult Parliament,
 and the issue is being considered this week
 by two parliamentary committees, one of
 which has a Communist chairman.

 GREECE-TURKEY
 The Greek  and Turkish foreign
 ministers concluded their discussions in
 New York on October 1 by agreeing to a
 resumption of negotiations on the Aegean
 continental shelf and control of Aegean
 airspace.  Representatives of the two
 governments will meet to consider both
 issues on November 2, probably in
 Switzerland.
 Positive public comments by both sides
 suggest that the foreign ministers over-
 came some earlier obstacles. After the
 meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister
 Caglayangil expressed satisfaction that
 the Greeks no longer insist on discussing
 only the legal aspects of the dispute and
 are now willing to discuss other points
 such as the security requirements of the
 two countries.
 In Athens, Greek officials said publicly
 that they were satisfied with the meeting,
 noting that the Turks had expressed un-
 derstanding. This could mean that
 Caglayangil did not press Greece to
 Q
 The tenth round of the Mutual and
 Balanced Force Reduction talks opened
 last week in Vienna.
 During the round last summer, the East
 finally provided data on its forces in Cen-
 tral Europe, thus opening the way for
 detailed discussions on force levels for the
 first time since the talks began in 1973.
 The chances for progress during this
 round, which will conclude in December,
 depend on the allied ability to respond to
 the East's move by tabling updated
 figures on its own forces.
 The principal stumbling block facing
 the Western allies is the French refusal to
 include data on French forces or to have
 them counted under the collective ceiling
 on ground troops the West wants es-
 tablished  for both  East and  West.
 Although France does not participate in
 the Vienna negotiations and has disclaim-
 withdraw the case it submitted to the
 International  Court  of Justice.
 Caglayangil may also have again played
 down Greece's illegal militarization of its
 easternmost Aegean islands.
 The apparent Greek decision to engage
 in more meaningful negotiations is partly
 a result of Turkish pressure in the form of
 the recent seismic exploration in contested
 Aegean waters. Athens has realized that
 its case does not have the full support of
 its allies and of the international com-
 munity. This was evident in the UN
 Security Council's handling of the Greek
 appeal in August and in the subsequent
 rejection by the International Court of

 Despite the positive atmosphere of the

 The allies are trying to arrange a com-

 general, they fear a French announcement
 would cause the Soviets to be reluctant to

 Germans also fear a French announce-

 demand-which is directed at establishing
 limits on the size of the West German

 Canadian Parliament Opens with Liberal Party Popularity at New Low
 Parliament reopens next week with
 public opinion polls showing that Prime
 Minister Trudeau's Liberal Party has
 dropped to a new low in its popularity
 rating. The government's  policy of
 bilingualism has provoked bitterness
 among both English- and French-speak-
 ing Canadians, and its wage-and-price
 controls are widely seen as major causes
 of continued high unemployment and a
 sluggish economy.
 Trudeau is well aware of his problems.
 Last weekend, he bluntly told a provincial
 party gathering that the party is "out of
 touch" with the grass roots, disorganized,
 and ranks as a minor party west of On-
 tario. The Liberals have to be worried, he
 said, about their "future as a national par-

 CUBA--~
 Prime  Minister  Fidel  Castro
 acknowleged in a speech on September 28
 that the Cuban economy is having serious
 problems because of the 60-percent drop
 in world sugar prices since last year.
 Castro said Cuba has had to reduce
 hard-currency expenditures sharply and
 will have to cut imports if it is to meet the
 repayments schedule on its mounting debt
 with the West. Imports from the West,
 which totaled $1.7 billion in 1975, were
 down an estimated 25 percent during
 January through May and may have to be
 reduced further this year.
 Castro said imports from communist
 countries, which amounted to $2.1 billion
 or 55 percent of total purchases last year,
 will be maintained.
 The Cuban leader announced a series of
 belt-tightening measures that will further
 restrict the already austere Cuban
 lifestyle. The coffee ration is to be cut-as
 In the government's Speech from the
 Throne on Tuesday kicking off the new
 legislative year, Trudeau will undoubtedly
 call for a continued fight against inflation,
 but he might indicate some softening of
 the government's guidelines on wages and
 prices to placate both labor and business.
 There are indications that he will push for
 increased Canadian ownership in the
 transportation field and a streamlining of
 the cumbersome foreign investment
 review process.
 Trudeau has already gotten off to a bad
 start this autumn.  Federal-provincial
 was the rice ration earlier in the
 year-because of drought and the need to
 conserve foreign exchange. Other con-
 sumer items, all or part of which must be
 imported from the West, will be limited
 and, in some cases, eliminated.
 Castro reiterated that Cuba's basic
 development strategy will not change.
 Because of its comparative advantage in
 growing sugarcane, Cuba will not seek a
 radical  diversification  of  agricultural
 production in an attempt to replace those
 products now being imported from the
 West. Sugar is still Cuba's most impor-
 tant export-accounting for 89 percent of
 total exports in 1975-and substantial ex-
 pansion of nonsugar exports is several
 years away.
 The reduction in imports from the West
 will lead to a cutback in production of
 manufactured goods-particularly con-
 sumer items-and force Cuba to revise
 downward its five-year plan that began
 this year. The cuts will complicate and
 delay achievement of the plan goals,
 which place considerable emphasis on
 Western capital equipment.
 A  large reduction in supplies of
 Western agricultural equipment, such as
 relations are strained, and labor has called
 for a nationwide work stoppage two days
 after Parliament convenes. The Prime
 Minister's  critics  say that his  long-

 Thailand's experiment in democratic government was
 plagued from its beginning by problems that have deep cultural
 roots and are not easily changed.
 Thailand: Shaky Political System
 a near-crisis compelled some temporary
 consensus.
 Political parties-now suspended at
 least temporarily-are basically alien to
 the Thai culture. Only the Democrat Par-
 ty has a semblance of permanence (it has
 existed since 1946). Other parties have
 made fleeting appearances, usually
 created for the parliamentary contests
 that briefly interrupted military rule. The
 civilian elite tended to shy away from the
 risks and futility of party politics, preferr-
 ing the real power and influence of the
 bureaucracy.
 The Democrat Party comes closest to
 being a political party in the Western
 sense. It draws support largely from the
 Bangkok area, but is developing strength
 in other parts of the country, particularly
 in the south, and is more of a national
 party than any other. Once regarded as
 the best organized and least corrupt of the
 Thai parties, it has become deeply divided
 along regional and generational lines,
 divisions that clearly weakened the posi-
 tion                                                                                      of former prime minister Seni
 and dissipated the strength that should
 have accrued from the party's large
 plurality in the just-dissolved Assembly.
 The Thai Nation Party, the second
 largest, is more typical of Thai political
 bodies; it is a coalition of conservative
 businessmen,  many of them retired
 military officers, and civilian bureaucrats
 held together by a web of personal and
 business relations. The party is descended
 from a powerful military clique of the
 1950s that was ousted from power by
 parliamentary  democracy.  These
 weaknesses are reinforced by cultural
 The  return to martial law in          patterns and are not susceptible to easy
 Thailand-whether it proves to be tem-   elimination. The instability and vacilla-
 porary or drawn out-is yet another in-             tion that have marked government perfor-
 dication of basic weaknesses in the                  mance can only reduce the already
 nation's three-year-old system of       tenuous commitment to democratic rule
 in Thailand.
 There have been three elected
 governments since the promulgation of
 the constitution in 1974. The first one
 lasted less than a month. Khukrit
 Pramot's administration  lasted  I1
 months. His brother Seni's coalition end-
 ed a shaky five-month existence with his
 abrupt resignation on September 23. The
 coalition re-emerged two weeks later
 scarcely changed and with little prospect
 for improvement in its performance; it
 was hampered from the beginning by the
 maneuvering of rival coalition leaders and
 by the internal divisions in the Prime
 Minister's Democrat Party.
 The multitude of parties competing for
 power-19 of the 41 that ran in the last
 election  were  represented  in the
 parliament-so spread the vote as to
 make coalition government unavoidable.
 Yet the coalitions did not represent com-
 mon political purposes so much as
 associations of convenience among party
 leaders who saw cabinet membership as
 the best way to protect and advance their
 personal interests.
 With coalitions divided by conflicting
 personal ambitions and interests, the
 development  of coherent  government
 policies has been virtually impossible until

 Left-wing students at Thammasat University open fire during demonstration
 Field  Marshal Sarit in  1957. The
 overthrow of Sarit's heirs, Thanom and
 Praphat, gave the old clique new life.
 Political Cliques
 Most of the political parties are com-
 posites of such cliques, or, in the case of
 many of the small ones, temporary
 vehicles to further one person's ambition.
 The Thai clique system is a reflection of
 the patron-client phenomenon that per-
 vades Thai society-a natural falling into
 place of a superior-inferior relationship
 with attendant obligations on each side.
 Such a system can be a source of social
 and political stability, as in Japan, In
 Thailand, however, patron-client relations
 are  transitory-clients  are  constantly
 reassessing the advantages of existing
 arrangements and seeking more beneficial
 patrons. In the parliamentary context,
 parties were unstable, continually shifting
 in relative strength as individual members
 offered their allegiance to the highest
 bidder.
 The 1974 constitution corrected some
 of the more glaring deficiencies that con-
 tributed to the failure of earlier ex-
 periments in representative government.
 Members of the legislature could no
 longer change parties without losing their
 seats, a provision that contributed to
 some stability in the most recent
 Assembly, The legislators, however, could
 and did sell their votes. In general, the
 Assembly behaved more responsibly and
 cautiously under the 1974 constitution. It
 did not, for example, throw down the
 gauntlet to the military at budget time, a
 tactic that helped to bring down the
 parliament in 1971.
 Protest and Polarization
 Fractious and vacillating government
 clearly  endangered  the long-range
 prospects for democracy in Thailand. The
 Thai are a conservative people, comfor-
 table with forms of paternalistic
 authoritarianism  and  uncertain that
 free-wheeling Western democracy is real-
 ly compatible with their society and their
 needs.
 The growth of protest politics and its
 attendant violence contributed to public
 skepticism and reduced the tolerance level
 of right-wing civilian and military groups.
 In the past few years, students, workers,
 and farmers,  traditionally passive
 elements of society, were increasingly
 drawn into active politics-but their im-
 pact was sporadic.
 The protest movements tended to be
 divided into competing cliques that ex-
 pended much of their energies in in-
 ternecine feuding. They were, however,
 capable of coalescing temporarily around
 a dramatic issue and placing considerable
 pressure on the government for relatively
 short periods.
 The students remain the cutting edge of
 protest politics. They have lost much of
 the glamor they once enjoyed fer their
 role in bringing down the military regime
 in 1973. Since then, the more visible ac-
 tivists have grown increasingly leftist and
 now form the core of a nascent radical
 movement.
 The radicalism of a few student leaders
 and the public's impatience with their ac-
 tivities encouraged repressive measures by
 right-wing forces. Groups such as the
 NAWAPHON (New Strength Group)
 and the Red Gaur, little more than bands
 of armed thugs, were used successfully to
 intimidate the students and other radical
 activists. The extremism of both rightists
 and leftists has contributed to a growing
 polarization in Thai politics, which has
 been reflected in the increasing violence of
 recent months.
 This growing tendency to violence may
 abate somewhat under martial law at
 least initially, since leftist activists are
 likely to go into hiding to avoid
 arrest-and worse-at the hands of the
 military.
 The King
 The King has little formal political
 authority, but he commands considerable
 moral influence and has been an impor-
 tant stabilizing factor. His intervention in
 1973-when he gave protection to student
 leaders and helped persuade Thanom and
 Praphat to leave the country-and the
 moral support he gave the new political

 SECRET
 structure had a critical impact on political
 developments. In moving on October 6 to
 take charge, the military was doubtless
 convinced that the King supported the
 declaration of martial law.
 The King has been clearly disturbed by
 the sense of instability that has permeated
 civilian politics since 1973. He was ap-
 palled by the growing left-wing movement
 and fearful that coalition governments
 beset by infighting could not cope with
 the country's problems.
 The special relationship he has careful-
 ly cultivated with the student community
 has probably been seriously damaged by
 his disenchantment with the student ac-
 tivists. He was outraged at reports alleg-
 ing that the student demonstrators hung
 the crown prince in effigy on October 6,
 and his alienation from the students will
 not only reduce the King's ability to act as
 a calming influence but also encourage ex-
 cessive reactions by the right.
 The Army
 The key factor in Thailand's political
 future is, as always, the army. With
 strong leadership, the army could be the
 most disciplined and effective political
 force in the country-ready to be used as
 a voting bloc to influence a parliamentary
 election or as the muscle for a coup.
 The First Division of the First Ar-
 my-the Bangkok garrison-is the
 traditional coup force, and the political
 proclivities of the First Army commander
 are of utmost importance to the govern-
 ment. The minister of defense holds
 another crucial post; he can place his
 allies in key military assignments when
 the annual retirements and rotations take
 place. The supreme military commander,
 as head of all the armed forces, is also in
 an influential position, as indicated by his
 selection on October 6 to run the new in-
 terim military council.
 Until called upon to take over in the
 wake of the new student violence this
 week, most senior army officers seemed
 disinclined to think in terms of a return to
 military rule. There was growing dis-
 satisfaction within the military with the
 government's weak and ineffectual per-
 formance, but most of the senior officers
 apparently felt that the army should not

 be directly responsible for the collapse of
 Thailand's fragile democracy.
 Their basic interests were not seriously
 threatened by the conservative civilians in
 power, and the military's links to the
 political parties enabled them to
 manipulate the political system. The out-
 break of serious violence together with
 Seni's manifestly weak leadership,
 however, set the stage for the declaration
 of martial law.
 Disunity and Indecision
 Thailand's parliamentary government
 has always been sustained more by
 negative factors than by positive ones.
 The parliamentary government's under-
 pinnings have been weak, and the com-
 mitment to its conceptual foundation
 fragile. The majority of the Thai people
 had become increasingly disenchanted
 with the weak performance of their
 government under former prime ministers
 Seni and Khukrit, and, while not pleased
 at the prospect, are probably resigned to

 Nigeria: Progress Toward Civilian Rule
 Head of state General Obasanjo renew-
 ed last week the commitment made a year
 ago by  his predecessor, General
 Mohammed, to hand over the reins to
 civilians in 1979. In an address on Oc-
 tober 1, marking the 16th anniversary of
 Nigerian  independence, Obasanjo
 emphasized the progress the military
 regime has made during the past year
 toward returning the country to civilian
 rule.
 Obasanjo was making his first national
 day appearance as Nigeria's leader. He
 moved into the top spot last February
 when Mohammed, who came to power
 after the ouster of General Gowon in July
 1975, was killed in an abortive power grab
 by disgruntled military officers.
 As a southerner and the first Yoruba to
 be head of state, Obasanjo was initially
 uncomfortable in the leadership role
 because he thought he might not be accep-
 table to Mohammed's fellow Muslim
 northerners. He now appears to be warm-
 ing to his job, but he remains highly sen-
 sitive to the northerners' feelings. He
 made a point, in his speech, of paying ef-
 fusive homage to Mohammed.
 In fact, the northerners, who agreed to
 Obasanjo's succession for the sake of
 national unity, appear to have lost little or
 no influence. Their chief representative on
 the ruling Supreme Military Council,

 Armed Forces Chief of Staff Shehu Yar
 Adua, is the regime's second ranking
 member-if not its strongman.
 Program for Civilian Rule
 In his speech, Obasanjo reported
 "significant advances" in the five-stage
 program for returning the country to
 civilian rule that General Mohammed
 outlined last year.
 One first-stage goal was reached early
 this year when the military government
 decreed the creation of seven additional
 states and declared closed the long-stand-
 ing statehood controversy. The decision
 satisfied at least some of the minorities in
 the original 12 states that had long press-
 ed for their own states in order to have
 more voice in national affairs.
 Obasanjo announced that a draft con-
 stitution-another  first-stage
 goal-would be made public this week for
 a year of public discussion. The draft, the
 work of a 49-member citizens' committee,
 was completed last month ahead of
 schedule.
 The draft calls for an elected president
 and vice president, a bicameral federal
 legislature, elected governors for the 19
 states, civilian control of the armed
 forces, and national political parties. A
 national constituent assembly is to be con-
 vened in October 1977 to adopt the con-
 stitution.
 An ambitious plan for reorganizing the
 country's local government structure by
 October  1978-another goal set by
 Mohammed-has also been launched.
 The government characterizes the plan as
 the "cornerstone" of its civilian rule
 program.
 Existing local government bodies are to
 be dissolved and new local councils chosen
 in nonpartisan elections in some states
 late this year. Caretaker councils are be-
 ing formed to serve until the elected coun-
 cils take office in January.
 Obasanjo announced the appointment
 of an election commission to begin initial
 preparations for state and federal elec-
 tions, probably in 1979. The commission
 will organize and oversee the elections,
 register voters and political parties, and
 delimit constituencies as prescribed by the
 constitution.
 According to the timetable announced
 by Mohammed last year, all these steps
 are to be completed in time for the
 military to return to the barracks on Oc-
 tober I, 1979.
 Hurdles Ahead
 The regime has pushed its program for
 return to civilian rule aggressively, but the
 steps ahead contain numerous pitfalls.
 For example, reorganizing local govern-
 ment without provoking a serious
 backlash from traditional local leaders,
 especially in the north, will be tricky.
 The powerful Muslim emirs and other
 traditional rulers have long opposed the
 introduction of elective government in
 their areas. They withheld public support
 of the plan until the regime modified its
 reforms to allow for many "local
 peculiarities," specifying that emirs may
 be nonpartisan presidents of local councils
 and may continue to "aid" in tax collec-
 tion. Many traditionalists also object to
 the regime's proposal that women be
 allowed to vote.
 The campaigning for the local elections
 could easily rekindle old ethnic and
 regional animosities that have beset
 Nigerian politics in the past. Political par-
 ties remain banned for the coming local
 elections, but ambitious politicians will
 feel compelled to start building a follow-
 ing. If the local politicking begins to
 reopen old political wounds, the regime
 may decide to stretch out its timetable.
 Before the local councils take office, an
 old controversy over the population cen-
 sus may crop up again. The boundaries of
 each local unit and funds provided to it
 apparently will be determined by the
 figures in the 1963 census, These are dis-
 puted by rival ethnic groups.
 Among Nigerians there is still
 widespread skepticism that the present or
 any successor military regime will actual-
 ly give up power voluntarily. Some
 high-ranking officers are widely believed
 to be amassing personal fortunes, and
 some observers suspect they will find ex-
 cuses not to follow through on their
 program-especially  if it  runs into
 problems.

 There is no end in sight to the dispute over Western
 Sahara, but none of those involved-Morocco and Mauritania
 on one side and Algeria on the other-now seems anxious to
 push for a showdown.
 Dispute Continuing Over Western Sahara
 Seven months after Spain turned over
 administrative control of Western Sahara
 to Morocco and Mauritania on the basis
 of an agreement reached in Madrid in
 November 1975, the legal status of the
 former Spanish territory is still being ac-
 tively contested by Algeria. The prospects
 for a negotiated settlement seem remote,
 and neither King Hassan nor President
 Boumediene shows any disposition to
 compromise.
 Throughout the past summer, the
 ing  the  insurgency  indefinitely.  The
 danger is that Morocco may eventually
 become so frustrated with a guerrilla war
 of attrition, which King Hassan has
 repeatedly warned he will not tolerate,
 that it will resort to direct retaliation
 against Algeria.
 Territory Partitioned
 Moroccan and Mauritanian forces oc-
 cupied Western Sahara soon after the
 November agreement, and the two coun-
 tries formally partitioned it last April.
 Morocco acquired the northern two
 thirds, including the rich phosphate
 reserves at Bu Craa, and Mauritania gain-
 ed  control  of the lucrative marine
 resources at Dakhla and the unexploited
 iron ore at Agracha. Each country
 proclaimed the extension of its sovereign-
 ty over its portion of the territory.
 Algeria, for its part, has been following
 a two-track policy attempting both to
 secure international censure of Morocco
 and Mauritania and to develop the
 Polisario Front into a credible military
 and political force. So far, the Algerians
 have had little success lining up
 diplomatic support for their position or
 for  the  Polisario  "state"-Saharan
 Democratic Arab Republic-created un-
 der their auspices last February. Only
 Algeria, eight other African states, and
 North Korea have recognized the Front's
 government-in-exile.
 In political forums, Algeria argues that
 the partition arrangement is illegal and
 continues to demand a referendum on
 self-determination under UN auspices.
 The Algerians cite a  number of
 resolutions  adopted  by  previous  UN
 General Assemblies that call for such a

 quarrel between Morocco and Mauritania

 while guerrillas of the Algerian-backed

 The pattern of diplomatic wrangling
 and sustained guerrilla warfare is likely to
 continue for some time. Neither side now

 procedure, including  one passed  last
 December.
 Morocco and  Mauritania point to
 another UN resolution, also adopted by
 the General Assembly last December,
 that in effect recognized the Madrid ac-
 cord. They insist that the resolution's re-
 quirement  for consultations with the
 territory's inhabitants was fulfilled last
 February when the Saharan assembly-a
 consultative body originally created by
 Spain but subservient to Rabat at the
 time-endorsed the turnover agreement.
 The UN, however, has not accepted the
 Moroccan-Mauritanian position because
 there was no UN role as called for in both
 resolutions.
 In late June, a meeting of foreign
 ministers of the Organization of African
 Unity, after a stormy debate, passed an
 Algerian-favored resolution reaffirming
 the Western Saharan people's right to
 self-determination and defeated a Moroc-
 can-Mauritanian  motion  to  censure
 je/
 Algerian aggression. The Moroccans
 walked out of the session and threatened
 to withdraw permanently from the OAU.
 Algiers' victory proved to be short-liv-
 ed. The followup OAU summit meeting in
 early July shelved the pro-Algerian
 resolution and passed a face-saving com-
 promise-a proposal for a special summit
 on  Western Sahara.  There is little
 enthusiasm among OAU members for
 such a meeting, and it may never take
 place. Thus far, no member has formally
 requested that a summit on Western
 Sahara be convened.
 Morocco views the Western Sahara
 issue as a bilateral dispute with Algeria
 and wants to limit further deliberations to
 reducing tensions in the region. Morocco
 prefers that any discussion of the problem
 be confined to the Arab League, where
 Morocco has considerable support, rather
 than the OAU.
 The  Moroccans,  nonetheless,
 successfully exploited the OAU proposal
 to blunt Algerian efforts to secure backing
 at the nonaligned summit in Sri Lanka in
 August. The nonaligned heads of state
 merely took note of the OAU proposal in
 their political declaration, expressing
 hope for a peaceful solution.
 At the UN
 Algeria almost certainly will seek a
 full-scale debate on the Western Sahara
 issue at the current General Assembly ses-
 sion, but the Algerians' poor showing at
 the nonaligned conference suggests they
 may be unable to win support for another
 resolution.
 Morocco's
 fallback position probably will be to argue
 that the dispute should be left for
 deliberation in regional bodies.
 With the UN in mind, Morocco and
 Mauritania have begun a propaganda
 campaign calling for the return of
 Saharan refugees in Algeria. Morocco is
 asserting that only a few refugees in
 Algeria are from Western Sahara and
 that these "Moroccan citizens" are being
 held against their will by Algerian
 authorities.
 Morocco and Mauritania are sensitive
 about the refugee issue because it under-
 mines their argument that the Western
 Saharans have been consulted. They have
 pushed their case against Algeria with the
 UN High Commissioner for Refugees in
 the hope that Algeria will be unable to ex-
 ploit this issue when the Commission
 meets in committee early next month.
 In the Territory
 Morocco and Mauritania are firmly es-
 tablished  in  the  principal  towns of
 Western Sahara, but they have not been
 able to eliminate Polisario guerrilla in-
 filtration and harassment in outlying
 areas. At least 2,000 to 3,000 guerrillas
 continue to carry out sabotage and hit-
 and-run attacks in southern Morocco
 and Mauritania, as well as in Western
 Sahara.
 In early June, the Front launched a sur-
 prise attack against the Mauritanian
 capital of Nouakchott. The guerrillas in-

 Mauritania's vulnerability as the weakest

 Since the attack  on Nouakchott,
 military cooperation between Morocco
 and Mauritania has increased. A special
 radio link between the two countries'
 senior military commanders is being set
 up, and a small Moroccan military liaison
 group reportedly has been sent to
 Nouakchott.

 already suffers from a shortage of finan-

 additional resources to support a cause

 Morocco, for now at least, is unlikely to
 escalate its dispute with Algeria. To do so
 would undermine the initiatives it is plan-

 port it has carefully cultivated among
 other Arab and African states. The recent
 routine rotation of fresh, and probably in-
 experienced, Moroccan troops into
 Western Sahara suggests the Moroccan
 government is continuing the level of its
 military effort there.
 The prospects for a negotiated settle-
 ment seem remote. In any eventual
 political deal, Algeria would have to settle
 for limited consultations with the Western
 Saharan people that did not alter Moroc-

 in turn, would have to accept at least a

 The military-controlled governments in southern South
 America all feel threatened by domestic terrorism and share a
 sense of isolation from the rest of the world. They are
 cooperating in an increasing variety of bilateral and mul-
 tilateral programs.
 South America:
 Cooperation Among Military Regimes
 11
 Circumstance and mutual interest are
 drawing leaders of the southern cone
 countries-Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
 and Paraguay-into closer political and
 economic cooperation. The army-con-
 trolled governments of these countries
 share a ubiquitous fear of communist sub-
 version, a growing feeling of isolation
 from the rest of the world, and a concern
 that they are being abandoned by the US.
 Brazil and Bolivia are beginning to par-
 ticipate in the relationship but have reser-
 vations for one reason or another. A
 close-knit alliance of these countries could
 have important implications for the US.
 The southern cone regimes purport to
 be  "democratic,"  but  are clearly
 authoritarian. The men in power do not
 get their support from political groups,
 but from the military.
 Most of the military leaders are con-
 vinced they can exert a modernizing in-
 fluence on government through increased
 efficiency and rationality. Most believe
 they are better qualified to govern than
 civilian politicians.
 The views of these military leaders
 seem to be coalescing into a still-unform-
 ulated philosophy of military admin-
 istration in which an abhorrence of
 disorder, distrust of the old politics, and
 dedication to social and economic
 progress are the driving forces.
 Fear of Subversion
 The military leaders believe the
 primary national concern should be
 security. The principal enemies are leftist
 terrorism and international communism.
 Preserving the nation, in their view, must
 take precedence over personal well-being
 and individual freedom.
 The preoccupation with security may
 seem excessive, but for the countries that
 have participated in a struggle against
 terrorists, the fight is real. It is true, for
 instance, that political violence in Argen-
 tina took more lives last year than the
 total killed in Northern Ireland during the
 past five years. All of the southern cone
 countries, to one extent or another, feel
 threatened by terrorist violence.
 Isolation
 Most of the countries suffer from a
 poor image in the world press and in inter-
 national  forums.  The  military
 governments are variously described as
 "totalitarian"  and "fascist." One
 Brazilian government official lamented to
 US embassy officers that the Israelis are
 praised for staging a raid into Africa
 against  terrorists,  but similar
 counterterrorist activities in Brazil are
 called excessive and cruel in the world
 press.
 Leaders in the southern cone also
 believe that investigations by unofficial
 and official bodies such as Amnesty Inter-
 national and the UN Commission on
 Human Rights are overzealous and mis-
 guided. The leaders think they should
 have the right to eliminate terrorists
 without foreign interference.
 Chilean leaders in particular are weary
 of "international interference," and
 profess to see the recent murder in
 Washington of former ambassador

 Letelier as part of a plot to discredit the
 nation. All of these countries believe they
 are the victims of an international cam-
 paign led by the communists.
 Close Cooperation
 The original impetus for cooperation
 among the southern cone countries
 probably came from Chile. Following the
 coup in 1973, the Chilean regime was anx-
 ious to acquire friends and military equip-
 ment for protection against a perceived
 threat from Peru.
 The Chileans first approached Brazil
 and came away with the belief that Brazil
 at least would lend a hand indirectly if
 Chile were invaded. Chile then ap-
 proached Bolivia and proposed a renewal
 of discussions on an outlet to the sea.
 Dipl"omatic relations between the two
 countries were re-established in February
 1975.
 The military coup in Argentina last
 March brought Buenos Aires into step
 with its neighbors. The Argentines in-
 creasingly  began  talking  of "new
 realities" in hemisphere affairs and
 cooperation among all of the southern
 cone countries including Brazil.
 After a period of concentration on the
 internal security situation and the
 economy, the Argentine government
 finally felt secure enough early last
 summer to implement some new foreign
 policy initiatives. In June, the Foreign
 Ministry sent carefully selected am-
 bassadors to Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and
 Paraguay. High Argentine officials also
 began visiting around the continent to dis-
 cuss topics of mutual interest.
 Current Status of Cooperation
 Diplomatic activity in the southern
 cone has continued. Argentina and Brazil
 reportedly have had discussions on
 creating a "South Atlantic Treaty
 Organization." This naval alliance is en-
 visaged as a defense of the South Atlantic
 against the Soviet-Cuban presence in
 southern Africa. The Brazilians, so far,
 have dismissed talk of an alliance as non-
 sense, but rumors persist.
 Argentina and Paraguay agreed this
 month to increase trade by eliminating
 customs barriers. They also said they
 would stimulate complementary joint in-
 dustrial  projects.  Argentine President
 Videla met with Uruguayan President
 Mendez and agreed to increase coopera-
 tion between the two governments. Videla
 is scheduled to visit Chile and Bolivia at
 the end of this month.
 Chilean diplomacy continues to be
 directed against Peru, but improved
 relations between the two countries have
 diminished the urgency of the Chilean ef-
 fort. Chile is continuing to talk with
 Bolivia about an outlet to the sea. Chilean
 willingness to discuss the problem and
 Peruvian intransigence have improved
 relations between Chile and Bolivia.
 Chile is working to increase trade
 relations with Paraguay and Uruguay. It
 is already involved in a "joint integration
 commission" with Argentina and also
 hopes to increase trade with that country.
 Chile has concluded that the Andean Pact25X1
 restricts development and that there is a
 better market for Chilean products in the
 southern cone.
 Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay also
 have been discussing trade and coopera-
 tion. Brazil and Paraguay already are in-
 volved in the construction of the Itaipu
 hydroelectric project on the Parana River.
 Paraguay and Uruguay have just launch-
 ed a joint commission; its first task is to
 eliminate customs restrictions between
 the two countries.
 Many intangibles will affect the extent
 of southern cone cooperation. There are
 many reasons why these countries would
 be drawn together in some sort of an
 alliance, but there are also old an-
 tagonisms.
 The great imponderable is Brazil-the
 only country in the area with true global
 aspirations. Until now, Brazil has been
 lukewarm toward an extensive alliance
 with neighboring countries. Whether or
 not Brazil can be enticed into joining the
 group may be one key factor in the extent
 and direction of southern cone coopera-
 tion. A lasting improvement in relations
 between Argentina and Brazil would be a
 difficult achievement under any con-
 ditions, but the leaders of both nations
 may now be prepared to try to accomplish
 just that.
 Continued perception of mutual in-
 terest among all of these countries is the
 most important element in the future of
 their relationship.  A prolongation of
 terrorist activities in the southern cone
 will drive these countries into further
 cooperation.
 Continued US criticism for human
 rights violations will heighten the sense of
 abandonment already prevailing in the
 area and intensify the feeling of isolation
 and frustration. This could foster closer
 cooperation  and  increasing protests
 against US interference in internal affairs.
 Chilean and Uruguayan leaders have
 already suggested publicly that their con-
 tinued swallowing of criticism from the25X1
 US on human rights issues is not worth
 the limited assistance they now get from
 Washington.
