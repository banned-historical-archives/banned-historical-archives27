 CHINA
 China's leaders made substantial
 progress in the last two weeks in filling
 key posts in the provinces with new
 men and also may have taken the first
 steps toward initiating a campaign
 against leftists in the military.
 The naming of five new provincial
 bosses brings to seven the number of
 new provincial leaders identified since
 mid-February and to nine the total
 named since the purge of the four left-
 ist Politburo members last October.
 Four of the nine replaced incumbents;
 the others took over positions that had
 been vacant for some time.
 The appointments made so far are
 doubtless the result of complex politi-
 cal maneuvering in Peking and the
 provinces.  One pattern that has
 emerged seems to reflect the influence
 of Politburo members Yeh Chien-ying
 and Hsu Shih-yu, both military men.
 Only three of the new provincial lead-
 ers are career soldiers., however, and
 two of them have been political
 officers.
 Progress in filling provincial vacan-
 cies suggests that other issues that have
 divided the regime may be nearer reso-
 lution. At present, however, the status
 of former vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping
 remains unclear, and local officials con-
 tinue to be uncertain about how to
 interpret directives published early last
 month.
 A campaign announced in late Feb-
 ruary in the army's newspaper may
 presage some personnel. changes in the
 army. The campaign calls for emula-
 tion of a unit of the 1st Army that has
 been known for its annual "rectifica-
 tion" efforts-reviews of the ideologi-
 cal level of the unit's members. On
 higher levels such efforts usually lead
 to personnel changes.
 The unit also has a record of having
 intervened in 1975 in civilian factional
 disputes in Chekiang, where it was sent
 that year by then chief of staff Teng
 Hsiao-ping. The unit replaced one that
 had taken sides in the disputes and
 apparently had illegally passed arms to
 one of the civilian factions.
 Although the army apparently har-
 bored relatively few supporters of the
 "gang of four," at least three military
 regions have reported extensive leftist
 interference in military affairs.
 Despite the apparent support of
 Yeh Chien-ying and Hsu Shih-yu, the
 new campaign may be encountering
 some resistance from local leaders. Ac-
 cording to one provincial radio broad-
 cast, the emulation drive was to have
 begun last January. So far, however,
 only a few provincial broadcasts have
 made  reference to the  campaign.
 PAKISTAN    t - 2
 Prime Minister Bhutto's Pakistan
 People's Party won over 150 of the 200
 seats at stake in the National Assembly
 election on March 7. It was a higher
 percentage than the party gained in the
 last election in 1970, which had provided
 the basis for Bhutto's political dominance.
 Although some dissatisfaction with
 Bhutto's performance as the country's
 leader surfaced during the campaign, his
 victory appears to have been achieved
 without extensive government in-
 terference. This may help him to maintain
 the backing of the armed forces and the
 bureaucracy if opposition leaders, who
 are claiming the election was rigged, go
 through with threats to stage a major
 post-election  campaign to bring him
 down. The alliance of parties opposing the
 Prime Minister has announced that it will
 not participate in the National Assembly
 and will boycott provincial assembly elec-
 tions scheduled for March 10. It has also
 called for a nationwide strike on March
 11.
 The People's Party won by carrying the
 rural portions of Punjab and Sind
 provinces, which elect over half the
 National Assembly. Before the voting,
 opposition parties appeared to have made
 significant inroads in the Punjab. In the
 end, Bhutto won a big victory there,
 probably because of support he received
 from traditional local leaders and doubts
 among voters that the opposition could
 form a stable government.
 In Baluchistan Province, government
 control of the electoral process gave the
 People's Party six of the seven seats. The
 opposition won in other areas where it
 clearly had the greater popular support,
 notably in the North-West Frontier
 Province. The opposition also did well in
 urban areas in the Sind, including
 Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and com-

 SIERRA LEONE
 President Siaka Stevens' regime in
 Sierra Leone appears to be in trouble.
 lheie is widespread political unrest in the
 country, and some army officers-may-be
 disaffected.
 S-udent-led  antigovernment
 demonstrations began in late January and
 continued sporadically for about three
 weeks in the capital of Freetown and some
 hinterland areas. Several students were
 killed in the disturbances, which resulted
 in rumerous arrests and considerable
 property  damage..  The demonstrators
 called for the resignation of the 71-year-
 old President, who came to power eight
 years ago after a short period of military
 rule.
 Police forces restored surface calm
 after Stevens agreed to a student demand
 for an early general election; it has been
 set for April. Some elements in the army,
 however, apparently oppose holding an
 election because they fear it
 In fact, more violence seems likely in
 Sierra Leone as the campaign proceeds.
 The US embassy in Freetown reports that
 opposition candidates in the eastern and
 southern provinces are well organized and
 could provide strong competition to the
 ruling All People's Congress. Although
 Stevens' party is the only national
 political organization, it has a narrow
 ethnic base and is badly factionalized.
 The government is already responding
 with strong-arm measures designed to in-
 timidate its opponents. Three members of
 the opposition were reportedly arrested
 late last month, and mass arrests are said
 to have taken place recently in the capitals
 of the eastern and southern provinces.

 ARAB-AFRICAN SUMMIT
 Arab and African leaders wound up
 a three-day summit in Cairo on March
 9 with ringing declarations of their de-
 sire for political and economic soli-
 darity, but their willingness to follow
 through on pledges of mutual support
 remains to be tested.
 The conferees-about half were ac-
 tually heads of state-apparently suc-
 ceeded in avoiding discussion of con-
 tentious bilateral issues, but African
 hopes for major increases in economic
 aid were frustrated. Arab delegates re-
 jected an African proposal for $2.2 bil-
 lion in new multilateral aid over the
 next five years and offered instead less
 than $350 million in multilateral funds
 beyond commitments already made.
 As a result of these pledges, African aid
 receipts will increase, but only slowly
 and by less than $100 million annually.
 The  Arab donors-Saudi Arabia-
 Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab
 Emirates-also pledged $1.1 billion to
 be extended bilaterally over a five-year
 period through their individual na-
 tional foreign development agencies.
 The  average  annual  commitments,
 Sierra Leone President Stevens
 however, represent no increases over
 the amounts promised by each of the
 four donors last year.
 The Arabs, for their part, obtained
 the political backing they sought, al-
 though in a somewhat watered-down
 form. The joint political declaration is-
 sued at the conclusion of the confer-
 ence condemned Israeli practices in the
 occupied  territories, but  was no
 stronger in its support for the Arabs'
 struggle against Israel than in its back-
 ing for the Africans' struggle against
 "racism." The declaration did not di-
 rectly equate Zionism with racism, al-
 though it did denounce "neocoloni-
 alism, Zionism, racial segregation, and
 all other forms of racial discrimina-
 tion."
 The Arabs committed themselves
 more firmly to the cause of African
 liberation movements by pledging fi-
 nancial aid for the first time-$5 mil-

 FRANCE        r
 The campaign for the mayoralty of
 Paris, which will end this weekend, has
 turned into a battle between President
 Giscard and Gaullist leader Jacques
 Chirac for control of the center-right in
 French politics. The conflict could make
 it difficult for the governing parties to
 cooperate after the election.
 Giscard all along has viewed Chirac's
 candidacy as a direct challenge to his
 authority as President. Recent reports
 suggest that leaders of Discard's Indepen-
 dent Republican party have been involved
 in last-ditch maneuvering to stop Chirac
 from becoming mayor. The chances are
 that they will be unable to do so, but the
 bitterness created by their effort seems
 sure to further strain relations among the
 coalition partners.
 The elections on March 13 to the
 municipal councils in Paris and other
 French cities will be followed by a run-off
 a week later. Members of the councils will
 then meet and elect one of their number
 mayor by secret ballot. On the first two of
 three permitted ballots, an absolute ma-
 jority is required for election; on the third
 ballot, the candidate with the most votes
 is elected.
 In Paris, the division of seats between
 the lists headed by Chirac and Minister of
 Industry d'Ornano, the standard-bearer
 for Giscard, is likely to give each faction
 fewer seats than will be won by the
 Socialist-Communist alliance, which is
 expected to make major gains. A com-
 promise is therefore essential if Paris,
 considered a vital springboard for the
 legislative election in 1978, is not to fall to
 the left.
 The US embassy in Paris believes the
 emotional feeling against Chirac within
 Giscard's entourage is so strong that
 Giscard might order the d'Ornano coun-
 cilors to ensure Chirac's defeat by not giv-
 ing him their votes on the third ballot,
 thus giving the left a victory. If Giscard
 does so, Chirac will be even further
 alienated, and he could withdraw Gaullist
 support from the government.
 The prospect of a disruptive parlia-
 mentary session leading to an un-
 wanted early national election prob-
 ably is enough to dissuade Giscard
 from  a  suicidal maneuver against
 Chirac. Even if the two leaders finally
 reach a compromise, however, it will
 be a long time before the bitterness
 created  by  the  race  dissipates.

 4    Z
 Prime  Minister Tindemans                                                                 dis-
 solved parliament this week and called
 for a general election on April 17. His
 government will stay on in a caretaker
 role until after the election.
 The shaky Tindemans government
 lost  its  narrow  majority in the
 parliament last week when the Prime
 Minister expelled the small Walloon
 Rally from the governing coalition.
 The immediate cause of the rift was
 the party's refusal to support the gov-
 ernment in a vote on the budget.
 The root of the problem, however,
 lies in the government's complicated
 efforts to restructure Belgium into
 autonomous linguistic communities.
 All major parties are agreed that some
 form of federation is required, but
 many details remain to be worked out
 between  the  Dutch-speaking and
 French-speaking communities.  The
 Walloon Rally tried to force the issue
 by threatening to withdraw from the
 government unless agreement was
 reached by last weekend.
 The Walloon party's action
 followed an announcement of various
 new  economic measures-including
 higher taxes-that are opposed by most
 labor and business groups. The
 principal labor unions have scheduled a
 month-long series of 24-hour strikes to
 show their displeasure.
 The opposition parties, led by the
 Socialists, do not have any solutions
 for the country's problems and would
 have  preferred to avoid  an early
 election. The Socialists, however, re-
 fused an invitation by Tindemans to
 join in a provisional three-month gov-
 ernment to try to resolve the region-

 West European Communist leaders Berlinguer (left) of Italy, Carrillo (center) of
 Spain, and Marchais of France appear at news conference following the summit
 EUROPEAN
 COMMUNISM     Cl. L~-
 Leaders of three West European
 communist parties--Carrillo of Spain,
 Berlinguer of Italy, and Marchais of
 France-ended two days of talks in
 Madrid last week by reiterating pre-
 viously stated "Eurocommunist" prin-
 ciples and issuing a mild reminder of
 their concern about human rights viola-
 tions in. the USSR and Eastern Europe.
 The main purpose of the meeting
 was to buttress the position of the
 Spanish party, which is waiting for
 Spain's Supreme Court to rule on the
 party's legal status. The party hopes to
 participate in the legislative election
 this spring.
 This purpose appears to have been
 well served, but Carrillo was not able
 to persuade Berlinguer and Marchais to
 criticize human rights violations in
 Eastern Europe in harsh terms in their
 joint communique.
 The Italian and French leaders ap-
 parently were anxious to avoid further
 strain in their relations with the East
 European regimes over treatment of
 political dissidents.
 Instead, the three leaders confined
 themselves to endorsing the "full appli-
 cation" of the Helsinki agreement and
 to an expression of hope for positive
 results from the European security
 conference later this year in Belgrade,
 where human rights violations are
 likely to become a major issue.
 The joint communique otherwise
 breaks no new ground, and the Soviets
 will not find it difficult publicly to
 interpret the reference to Helsinki and
 Belgrade as support for their position
 that the West is guilty of ignoring all
 but the human rights provisions of the
 accords.
 Carrillo wanted to demonstrate his
 party's independence from the Soviets
 by condemning Soviet and East Euro-
 pean repression. In this way he in-
 tended to remind the Spanish Supreme
 Court that his party has no formal ties
 to the USSR and that it has long been
 the most outspoken Western party in
 criticizing the Soviets. Probably out of
 deference to Berlinguer and Marchais,
 Carrillo toned down his criticism at the
 press conference  that  followed the
 summit meeting. Carrillo denounced
 socialist states that violate liberty but
 did not mention the USSR by b  name..
 Meeting in Sofia               s -5
 Communists with a different set of
 priorities were conferring in Sofia, Bul-
 garia, while the Madrid gathering was
 under way.  Representatives of the
 communist parties of the USSR, six
 East European countries, Cuba, and
 Mongolia met for two days in the Bul-
 garian capital to discuss ideological is-
 sues. This was the third meeting of
 these party ideologists in six months.
 In the final communique, the rep-
 resentatives emphasized the need to
 oppose Western "interference" in the
 communist countries, a reflection of
 concern about the  pressure being
 exerted from the West on the human
 rights issue.
 The subject of Eurocommunism
 was surely on the agenda in Sofia, even
 though there was no mention in the
 communique of the West European
 communist summit.  The  USSR is
 clearly concerned about the implicit
 challenge Eurocommunism represents

 to its leadership of the communist
 world.
 When the party ideologists held
 their previous meeting last December,
 the discussion reportedly was about
 the "disruptive" effects of the Helsinki
 accords on certain West European com-
 munist parties, but there was no agree-
 ment on what to do about this.
 The importance attached by Mos-
 cow to the Sofia meeting is demon-
 strated by the make-up of its delega-
 tion. Boris Ponomarev, a candidate-
 member of the Politburo, led the
 group, which included three Central
 Committee secretaries. Ponomarev is in
 charge of relations with nonruling com-
 munist parties, and his presence in
 Sofia  was another indication that
 broad issues affecting the communist
 movement in Western countries were
 on the agenda.
 The final communique referred to
 the "equality" of the participants and
 to the "efficient" and friendly atmos-

 ROMANIA

 The damage resul tng from Romania's
 severe earthquake on March 4 is sure to
 add to the country's economic problems.
 Major industrial centers, coal mines, and
 key oil fields-largely located in
 south-central Romania-have been
 affected, and thousands of dwellings have
 been destroyed.
 According to preliminary reports, the
 worst destruction occurred in Bucharest,
 Romania's  largest industrial center.
 Three power plants, a major engineering
 plant, 15 other factories, and 150 apart-
 ment buildings were destroyed.
 In Ploesti, half of the 70 industrial in-
 stallations, including three oil refineries,
 have been reported severely damaged.
 The refineries produce 160,000 barrels per
 day of petroleum products and account
 for about one third of Romania's total
 refinery capacity. Approximately 300 of
 the wells in the Ploesti oil fields were
 BUCBABEST*     Epicente
 rrr
 damaged, but most of them, according to
 the Romanian press, resumed operation
 on March 7; the fields account for about a
 third of Romania's crude output.
 A significant slowdown in the produc-
 tion of oil, gas, and machinery would be a
 considerable blow to an already strained
 economy. Even before the earthquake,
 Romania was unlikely to meet its overly
 ambitious economic goals, which called
 for an 8-percent annual rate of growth in
 Gross National Product during the five
 year period 1976 to 1980.
 The Romanians have been counting
 heavily on large increases in energy supply
 to spur industrial growth. If this supply is
 reduced as a result of the earthquake,
 more oil will have to be imported, further
 adding to the country's balance-of-
 payments problems. Its hard-currency
 debt has been increasing rapidly and
 already exceeds $3 billion.
 The new economic burdens are likely to
 fall mainly on the hard-pressed consumer.
 Reconstruction needs will divert resources
 from  consumer-oriented  investment,
 which was already faltering last year when
 it grew only half as rapidly as planned.
 Emergency aid has been delivered by
 several countries, including the US and
 USSR. Several times in the past Presi-
 dent Ceaucescu has sought long-term
 economic assistance from the West; he is
 certain to use the disaster to try again to
 obtain  sizable  Western _pjd.
 Hours after the earthqua  (dioCk
 Romania, President Ceausesc f returned
 home from a 12-day trip to West Africa
 during which he stressed Romania's
 third-world ties and sought expanded
 bilateral trade.
 Ceausescu visited Mauritania, Senegal,
 Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria on the
 trip, his first to Africa in three years. He
 was accompanied by key foreign affairs
 and economic advisers.
 In all five countries visited, the
 Romanians and their hosts signed trade or
 economic protocols pledging greater
 bilateral cooperation. Romania agreed to
 reschedule Ghana's $1.4-million debt and
 established a joint economic commission
 with the Ivorians. Ceausescu may have
 made deals for increased supplies of cer-
 tain raw materials, but he apparently
 failed to get the Nigerians to agree to
 sell oil to Romania.
 At every opportunity, Ceausescu
 highlighted Romania's support for the
 "new economic order" advocated by
 third-world countries and for the elimina-
 tion of colonialism, racism, and
 apartheid. He also emphasized non-
 interference in internal affairs, national
 sovereignty, equal rights among states,
 and renunciation of the use or threat of
 force in interstate relations. His reitera-
 tion of the latter points has surely irritated
 the Soviets, although they have come to
 expect such language from the
 Romanians.
 Ceausescu doubtless hopes the trip will
 help secure African support for
 Romania's bid to become an "observer"
 in the nonaligned movement. In the past,
 some African states strongly opposed
 Bucharest's candidacy; at last August's
 nonaligned summit in Colombo,
 Romania was admitted only as a "guest."

 EAST GERMANY
 East Germany recently began charging
 a "street usage fee" for nearly all
 automobiles that enter East Berlin from
 West Berlin. The fee nearly doubles the
 cost of a trip through the wall. Allied
 vehicles are not affected by the East Ger-
 man measure.
 This was the latest in a series of actions
 by the East Germans since the beginning
 of the year aimed at eroding the special
 status of East Berlin, over which they
 have long claimed full and exclusive
 sovereignty. East Germany is also seeking
 to curtail Western contacts with its
 citizens, and there are reports that the
 higher fee has cut traffic to East Berlin by
 a third.
 The new fee will give the East Germans
 additional hard currency, which is always
 in short supply in their country. The
 amount of hard currency that they are
 likely to take in-probably about $2.5
 million-suggests, however, that
 economic considerations were not a
 primary factor in the decision.
 YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslavia is hardening its previously
 cautious stance on the human rights issue,
 probably in response to increased Western
 publicity and more open dissent at home.
 In a speech last week, leading party
 Secretary Stane Dollanc accused the West
 of overemphasizing human rights
 provisions in the Helsinki accords and of
 launching a campaign in support of the
 country's dissidents.  He said Yugoslav
 dissidents are trying to exploit Western
 publicity to attack the Yugoslav system.
 The US embassy reports that two
 signers of a December petition on
 freedom of travel have lost their jobs, and
 the author of a magazine article that
 harshly  criticized  the  Czechoslovak
 regime's handling of dissidents expects to
 lose his job. A recent issue of the party's
 official weekly Kommunist attacked the
 magazine for printing another article that
 conflicts with the "basic values and orien-
 tations of Yugoslav society."
 The Yugoslav regime at first tacitly
 supported the Czechoslovak dissenters,
 but Yugoslav media have recently been
 less sympathetic in discussing dissent
 elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
 The regime has not yet formulated a
 policy toward its dissidents, and there are
 reports of disagreements within the
 leadership group over how to deal with
 them. This indecision could lead to more
 challenges to the regime's authority,
 something Yugoslav leaders almost cer-
 tainly hope to avoid before the signatories
 to the Helsinki accords meet in Belgrade
 in June to prepare a follow-up European
 security conference scheduled for this
 fall.
 Party secretary for international af-
 fairs Aleksandar Grlickov recently told
 Western newsmen that the regime will
 grant amnesty to many of its political
 prisoners within two months. Belgrade
 hopes that such a move would improve
 Yugoslavia's image in the West, but
 the regime probably will not permit
 any significant internal  liberaliza-

 Indira Gandhi's Congress Party may win only a modest
 victory in the national election next week. If so, the Prime
 Minister's freedom of action may be reduced, and some of her
 more controversial policies could be sidelined.
 India: Election Campaign
 The electoral contest for control of the
 lower house of the Indian parliament has
 developed into a much tougher fight than
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi anticipated
 when she unexpectedly dissolved parlia-
 ment last January. The election is to be
 held over a five-day period starting on
 March 16. Gandhi's Congress Party may
 win more than half the 542 seats at stake,
 but it does not appear likely to retain the
 two-thirds majority it secured in the last
 national election in 1971.
 Assuming that her party wins only a
 modes: victory, Gandhi's freedom of ac-
 tion as prime minister will probably be
 reduced. Some of the controversial
 policie:> she recently adopted-such as
 the nation's first vigorous birth control
 program-may be sidetracked.
 Predicting the outcome of the election
 is hazardous because of the size of the
 electorate-there are 320 million eligible
 voters--and the absence of any reliable
 means of measuring public attitudes in the
 hundreds of thousands of villages where
 most Indians live. It is clear, nonetheless,
 that the main opposition groups are
 cooperating against the ruling party more
 effectively than ever before and that they
 have succeeded in putting Gandhi on the
 defensive.
 When she announced two months ago
 that the, election would be held in March,
 Gandhi bypassed recent legislation that
 allowed her to wait until 1978. She ap-
 parently concluded that she could win
 handily now and that postponement
 would be an unnecessary political risk.
 The public seemed relatively satisfied
 with the economic and social gains at-
 tained since Gandhi's government im-
 posed a national emergency in June 1975.
 Ample rainfall in the past two years had
 helped produce bumper crops, and the
 economic situation was better than usual.
 The opposition appeared to represent lit-
 tle threat, as most parties were crippled by
 the jailing of their leaders and by
 regulations that curbed political activity.
 The formerly free press was muzzled.
 Gandhi's Miscalculation
 Gandhi, however, appears to have un-
 derestimated the extent of disenchant-
 ment with her authoritarian rule; her deci-
 sion to permit a fair and free election has
 worked against her. By lifting most
 restrictions on political activity and on the
 press, she has encouraged the venting of
 frustration and discontent that had been
 contained since imposi?ion  of the
 emergency.
 Moreover, the release since January of
 many opposition party leaders along with
 tens of thousands of other political
 prisoners furnished the opposition with
 experienced spokesmen who, because of
 Gandhi's repressive policies, had greater
 reason than in the past to cooperate
 against the government.
 A Key Defection
 The most dramatic setback for Gandhi
 was Agriculture Minister Jagjivan Ram's
 unexpected resignation in February from
 the Congress Party and from the cabinet,
 in which he had served almost continuous-
 ly since independence in 1947. Ram was
 an associate of the late Jawaharlal Nehru,
 India's first prime minister and Indira
 Gandhi's father, and has long been a
 spokesman for India's 80 million lowly
 "untouchables." His support is greatest in
 populous northern India, where the
 Congress Party has traditionally done
 well in elections.
 Ram's defection was a blow to
 Gandhi's prestige and raised great con-
 cern about the loyalty of other long-time
 followers. Many of the party's aging "old
 guard" and some leftists deeply resented
 the growing influence and the conser-
 vatism of the Prime Minister's 30-year-
 old son Sanjay, who apparently was be-
 ing groomed for eventual succession.
 Others were unhappy with Gandhi's
 moves since June 1975 to change the con-
 stitution in order to give herself more
 power.
 Fortunately for Gandhi, Ram's defec-
 tion occurred before the Congress Party
 had completed its selection of parliamen-
 tary candidates. Through last-minute
 changes, the party was able to nominate
 many stalwarts who were originally slated
 to be replaced by Sanjay Gandhi's young
 supporters.  These  reinstatements
 probably prevented additional important
 defections to the opposition, although
 they also forced Gandhi to retain some
 candidates whose loyalty remains
 questionable.

 The opposition, meanwhile, was mak-
 ing unexpected headway, forging a
 strategy that could cost the Congress Par-
 ty many parliamentary seats. Four major
 noncommunist parties formed a united
 front called the Janata or People's Party.
 The new party contains a mixture of
 ideologies-socialists, economic conser-
 vatives, Hindu nationalists, and long-time
 Congress Party opponents of the Prime
 Minister.
 The Janata Party, in turn, agreed to
 cooperate with some regional parties,
 with  Ram's new "Congress for
 Democracy" and, in certain areas, with
 the Marxist Communist Party, an in-
 digenous Communist Party without ties
 to either Moscow or Peking.
 United Opposition Front
 By fielding single opposition candidates
 in many constituencies, the united front
 and its allies hope to overturn the old
 pattern in which Congress Party victories
 occurred because the opposition was
 splintered. In each of the five parliamen-
 tary elections since independence, the
 splitting of opposition votes among many
 small opposition parties ranging from the
 extreme right to the far left has enabled
 the Congress Party-the only truly
 national party-to win a parliamentary
 majority with less than half the popular
 vote.
 The Congress Party is contesting all but
 50 seats that it probably could not expect
 to win. In those districts Gandhi has
 agreed to cooperate with the pro-Soviet
 Communist Party of India, an occasional
 ally, or with regional parties.
 About half the 2,400 candidates for the
 lower house are serious contenders. The
 remainder are independents with little
 chance of winning. Many races appear to
 be close. Both the Congress Party and the
 opposition are relying on candidates who
 are proven vote-getters rather than on
 youth, women, or other newcomers. Caste
 and religious considerations are playing
 their usual important roles.
 Major Issues
 The main issues in the campaign are:
 ? Imposition and continuation of
 the state of emergency.
 ? Sanjay Gandhi's role in the
 regime.
 ? The birth control program, which
 went into high gear last April.
 The opposition is demanding that the
 emergency be lifted; Gandhi claims it
 must be retained to sustain economic
 progress and as long as there is any
 domestic or foreign threat to national
 security. By domestic "threat," she means
 any attempt to undermine her authority.
 In alluding to foreign dangers, she has
 recently been careful not to name coun-
 tries, but most Indians probably assume,
 because of her past accusations, that she is
 referring to the US.
 The relegation of Sanjay Gandhi to the
 background in the campaign is an
 acknowledgement that the Prime
 Minister's ambitious son is now a political
 liability. The younger Gandhi made many
 enemies by disregarding established
 political traditions, but his strong support
 for slum clearance and birth control
 programs probably is the main reason for
 his eclipse. To save face, he is running for
 his first parliamentary term from a dis-
 trict in which he is likely to win.
 The government's family planning
 campaign became widely unpopular as
 fears of compulsory sterilization swept
 many poor communities. These anxieties
 were exacerbated by a slum clearance
 program under which entire communities
 were sometimes uprooted and relocated.
 Actions of overzealous bureaucrats,
 together with the opposition's probable
 complicity in spreading rumors about
 forced sterilization, have apparently
 helped to make the family planning
 program an explosive campaign issue. As
 a result, the government has quietly

 Approved For Release 2008/07/02 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011500100001-5
 SECRET
 suspended the sterilization drive in most
 states.
 Gandhi has admitted publicly that
 some "excesses" occurred in achieving a
 record 7.5 million sterilizations in the past
 year, and she has promised that greater
 care will be used. It is unlikely, however,
 that the millions of Indians at the lowest
 rung of the social ladder-and the sizable
 Muslim minority--can be convinced that
 they are not special targets of the family
 planning program.
 lr an effort to offset disaffection
 among these traditional Congress Party
 supporters, the government recently
 offered a-number of-costly economic con-
 cessions to civil servants and other
 workers. These groups have suffered
 financially from the ban on strikes during
 the emergency and from the government's
 anti-inflationary policies, which blocked
 wage hikes, bonus payments, and higher
 cost-of-living allowances.
 The Campaign Trail
 A lack of broadly popular figures in the
 Congress Party--largely a result of
 Gandhi's moves over the years to
 eliminate her coin petitors-has caused
 her :o assume the major burden of cam-
 paigning. She has remarkable stamina at
 age 59, but her whirlwind tour of the
 n
 ( y
 states has been a grueling experience
 made only somewhat easier by the advan-
 tage that government transportation gives
 her over her opponents.
 Gandhi and the opposition are focusing
 most of their attention on heavily pop-
 ulated northern India-the "Hindi
 Belt"-where four states account for
 about 40 percent of the seats in the lower
 house. Many Indian observers claim
 Gandhi is in trouble there but will do
 better in the southern and western
 regions.
 Gandhi's  audiences  throughout  the
 campaign have been considerably smaller
 and less enthusiastic than those of her op-
 ponents. While the opposition lacks any
 single leader of Gandhi's prominence, it
 has an abundance of good speakers and
 colorful figures who are able to cover
 many of the rural areas Gandhi has not
 had time to visit.
 The opposition asserts that it is fighting
 for democratic principles ,and portrays the
 election as the last chance to choose
 between  democracy  and  dictatorship.
 Gandhi counters with cha-ges that the op-
 position front represents an opportunistic
 alliance of conflicting ideologies and
 would be unable to provide stable-govern-
 ment.
 Neither side has made foreign policy a
 significant issue in the campaign.
 It appears increasingly likely that
 Gandhi will be weakened by the coming
 vote-assuming she refrains from in-
 terfering in the electoral process and
 keeps her promise to accept the mandate
 of the voters. So far, there has been no
 sign of any meddling in what has been a
 remarkably peaceful campaign. Nor has
 there been any evidence that Gandhi plans
 to tamper with the returns.
 If Gandhi anticipates a major defeat,
 however, she might postpone the election
 at the last minute, citing internal instabili-
 ty, foreign interference, or some other ex-
 cuse.
 If the Congress Party secures only a
 narrow majority-between 272 and 300
 seats-a period of instability and in-
 decisive rule could follow. Efforts might
 even be made from within the party to
 oust Gandhi and select a new prime
 minister.
 A wider margin of victory-between
 300 and 325 seats-would decrease the
 possibility of defections from the
 Congress Party and permit a more stable
 rule. It would somewhat limit Gandhi's
 power by giving her less than the two-
 thirds majority needed to amend the
 constitution. Such a victory thus could
 re-establish a more meaningful and
 traditional parliamentary system and halt
 the authoritarian trend that has marked
 much of Gandhi's 11-year tenure-as prime
 minister.
 Such  an outcome, however, would
 probably hurt  chances for continued
 momentum  in  certain  domestic
 programs-such as the birth control drive
 and the shift during the past two years
 toward more pragmatic economic
 policies-that are opposed by powerful
 pressure groups. It could also make it
 harder for the government to make
 decisions on emotional issues such as
 those affecting  India's relations with
 Pakistan.
 A victory for the opposition would
 signal a major political upheaval and
 usher in a highly uncertain era in Indian
 politics

 The talks that Jordan and the Palestine Liberation
 Organization began recently under pressure from Egypt and
 Syria are unlikely to resolve quickly the problems between King
 Husayn's regime and the Palestinians but could lead to closer
 coordination of strategy for Middle East peace negotiations.
 5
 Jordan-PLO: Beginning a Dialogue
 A first round of talks between the
 Palestine Liberation Organization and
 Jordan in late February in Amman ended
 on an inconclusive note. The two par-
 ties-archenemies for years-touched
 only tentatively on the problems of coor-
 dinating their peace negotiating strategies
 and forging a link between Jordan and
 any future West Bank state.
 The dialogue opens a useful channel for
 exchanging views and lays the
 groundwork for possible: closer coopera-
 tion later on. Given their history of bitter
 relations, however, neither the PLO nor
 Jordan is likely to adopt a more flexible
 position on a coordinated approach to a
 renewed Geneva conference on the Mid-
 dle East without continuing strong
 pressure from Egypt and Syria-the two
 states that promoted the dialogue.
 The dialogue moved ahead, at least
 symbolically, this week when Jordan's
 King Husayn and PLO chief Yasir Arafat
 reconciled publicly in Cairo where they
 were attending the Afro-Arab summit
 conference. They apparently held a
 number of individual meetings with Egyp-
 tian President Sadat and Syrian President
 Asad at which the subject of an early for-
 mal tie between the PLO and Jordan was
 surely discussed.
 Press reports state that Husayn and
 Arafat decided to forge a link prior to the
 resumption of Geneva peace talks, but it
 is unclear how much real agreement was
 reached. Any arrangement between the
 two probably is general in nature, leaving
 the difficult details of closer cooperation
 still to be worked out. They apparently
 did at least agree to meet again with the
 Egyptian and Syrian presidents within the
 next month or so, this time in Damascus.
 Meanwhile, the next step in the
 dialogue process is likely to take place at
 a meeting in Cairo next week of the
 Palestine National Council, the
 Palestinians' policy-setting parliamentary
 body. The Egyptians and Syrians, work-
 ing with moderate Palestinians, have been
 busy for months preparing the way for a
 council session, and they presumably ex-
 pect it to endorse in some form the Jor-
 dan-PLO tie they seek.
 Jordan's Position
 For the Jordanians, who drove the
 Palestinians from Jordan in 1970 and
 1971, the talks with the PLO are a painful
 and  potentially hazardous exercise.
 Before the talks began two weeks ago,
 King Husayn privately said that he did
 not know what to say to the PLO delega-
 tion and that the Jordanians would begin
 by simply listening to what the PLO had
 to say. While seeing few possible benefits
 for them from a relationship with the
 PLO, the Jordanians have definite ideas
 on what they are determined to avoid:
 ? They will not allow the PLO a free
 hand politically in Jordan.
 ? They will not permit the PLO to use
 Jordan as a base for political or military
 activities on the West Bank.
 ? They will avoid being drawn into
 negotiating with Israel over the future of
 the West Bank and Gaza without a clear
 public mandate from the PLO and the
 other Arabs that would protect Jordan in
 the event these territories were only par-
 tially returned.
 Jordan does want to develop and main-
 tain a strong voice on the West Bank
 whatever the ultimate disposition of the
 territory, and this will color Jordan's
 dealings with the PLO on this subject.
 Jordan's determination in this regard
 was reflected during the talks in Amman
 when Jordanian officials resurrected the
 plan King Husayn unveiled in 1972 for a
 United Arab Kingdom. Under the plan,
 the East and the West Bank areas would
 each be ruled by a native-born governor
 and a provincial cabinet responsible for
 internal affairs. The national government,
 led by Husayn, would be responsible
 primarily for foreign and military affairs.
 The Jordanians asked the PLO to
 review the proposal and respond at some
 future date, presumably during the next
 round of talks. When it was initially aired,
 the Jordanian plan was roundly denounc-
 ed by virtually all other Arabs. It is un-
 likely that the PLO will now find the idea
 any more palatable unless the plan is con-
 siderably modified. But the PLO response
 will provide some clues on where the
 dialogue might lead.
 The PLO

 the Palestinian movement over the

 wisdom of improving relations with Jor-
 dan, but most Palestinian leaders appear
 to favor the idea. Because both Egypt and
 Syria are promoting the dialogue, the
 PLO is unable to play one off against the
 other as it has in the past on other issues.
 Although uncertain about where the
 dialogue will lead, the PLO probably does
 have some general objectives in mind.
 Palestinian leaders realize there is a

 status of the West Bank and Gaza. They
 are further aware of the likelihood that
 any Palestinian state formed from those
 areas will be required to have ties to Jor-
 dan.
 The PLO wants to ensure its participa-
 tion in the creation of such a Palestinian
 entity. Should Jordan assume the Palesti-
 nian proxy in the negotiating process, or if
 a joint Jordanian-PLO delegation for
 Geneva is formed, the PLO wants to be
 sure it has the controlling voice in

 negotiations over Palestinian issues.
 PLO leaders have viewed with some
 anxiety Jordan's recent efforts to increase
 its influence among Palestinians on the
 West Bank at their expense. The PLO
 may hope that improved relations with
 Jordan will undercut Jordanian activities
 on the West Bank, although such a step
 could have the opposite effect of legitimiz-
 ing the Hashemite regime in the eyes of
 West Bank Palestinians. Through Jordan,
 the PLO also is looking for some direct
 contacts on the West Bank and more
 direct access to the approximately
 900,000 Palestinians living in Jordan
 proper.
 Beyond these goals, Arafat and other
 PLO leaders may hope that establishment
 of the dialogue with Jordan will buttress
 recent efforts to demonstrate to Israel and
 the US the PLO's new "moderation."
 The PLO will try to avoid giving the Jor-
 danians its full proxy in any future
 dealings with Israel.
 Both Egypt and Syria are clearly nudg-
 ing Jordan and the PLO in the direction
 of some kind of formal association as a
 device for overcoming Israel's objections
 to dealing directly with the PLO. Presi-
 dent Sadat has urged the two parties to
 form a confederation prior to a reconven-
 ed Geneva conference. President Asad has
 given his guarded endorsement to this
 idea, provided the PLO and Jordan agree.
 The willingness of Egypt and Syria to
 force the pace of the dialogue, however, is
 likely to depend on the steps they believe
 the US intends to take next to break the
 current negotiating impasse.
 The Egyptians seem anxious to see the
 matter resolved and the Geneva talks
 launched; the Syrians, however, appear to
 be hanging back, waiting for some sign
 that they will get back all or at least a
 major part of the Golan Height's in the
 next round of negotiations. Without some
 credible assurances that the US is ready
 to press Israel for substantial concessions,
 neither Egypt nor Syria may be prepared
 to push the PLO to compromise its posi-
 tion and strike a hard and fast deal with
 Jordan over the future of the West Bank.

 his control. They have been increasingly
 critical of Qadhafi's arbitrary and often
 eccentric style of governing.
 As Secretary General of a new General
 People's Congress, Qadhafi holds the
 most important position in the revamped
 government. The old Revolutionary Com-
 mand Council has been abolished; its
 members have been appointed to a
 five-member Secretariat of the General
 People's Congress.
 The two members of the council who
 held cabinet posts, former prime minister
 Jallud and ex - interior minister Humaydi,
 have been removed) from direct
 governmental responsibility. All four of
 the former council members have retained
 their military ranks; they may continue to
 serve as personal advisers to Qadhafi.
 The new General People's Committee,
 which replaces the Council of Ministers, is
 headed by Abd al-Ati al-Ubaydi, a former
 minister of labor and civil service. He is,
 in effect, the prime minister and is the
 first civilian to head a Libyan government
 since  1970 when Qadhafi dismissed
 former prime minister Maghribi. Qadhafi
 personally nominated al-Ubaydi to
 replace Jallud and then rammed through
 a "unanimous" vote in favor of his selec-
 tion.
 Qadhafi's Distrust of Military
 Libyan military officers generally view
 the reorientation as new evidence of
 Qadhafi's distrustful attitude toward
 them. Qadhafi, in fact, is hoping that the
 Libya: Qadha ft's Reorganization
 reorganization will enable him to
 transform his popularity among Libya's
 largely rural, tribal population into a
 more effective political instrument and
 thus reduce his reliance on the armed
 forces. Over the short term, however, he is
 running a high risk of further demoraliz-
 ing the officers who have been the primary
 prop of his regime.
 Qadhafi has been on the defensive since
 1975, when a coup attempt engineered by
 Revolutionary Command Council
 member Umar Muhayshi and a small
 clique of army officers brought
 wide-ranging  dissatisfaction  with
 Qadhafi's one-man rule to the surface.
 The defection of other council members
 following Muhayshi's betrayal, and the
 resentment stirred up by an investigation
 of the conspiracy, compounded tensions
 between Qadhafi and the military and
 ended all pretense of collegiality within
 the council.
 Since 1975, insubordination and
 violence   within   the   armed
 forces-including several reported
 attempts on Qadhafi's life-have in-
 creased. Qadhafi has responded by
 repositioning key units and major am-
 munition stores, upgrading police and
 paramilitary forces at the expense of the
 army, and systematically replacing those
 suspected of disloyalty with his kinsmen
 and members of tribes from his home
 region.
 He was hesitant, however, to reduce the
 power of his colleagues on the council
 without first regaining control of the
 military. He apparently came to feel con-
 fident that he could remove the glaring
 evidence of divided leadership that the
 council had come to represent. None of its
 Muammar Qadhafi      S
 four active members at the time of its
 abolition, including Jallud, has a power
 base sufficiently strong to challenge
 Qadhafi, and dissension among them
 probably precludes their acting in concert.
 In his campaign to promote the new
 government structure, Qadhafi has
 remained vague about what is to become
 of his colleagues. He has said that their
 protective role is over and that the people
 can seek their help as they see fit.
 The New Government
 Qadhafi's plan for the new government
 is designed to maximize and exploit his
 support among tribal and rural com-
 munities. Over the past year, he has spent
 much time in the countryside explaining
 his ideas, cultivating supporters, and en-
 couraging them to greater political ac-
 tivism. His orchestration of numerous
 popular demonstrations has served both

 to generate enthusiasm for the new order
 and to warn his detractors that he has the
 support necessary to carry off the change.
 Under Qadhafi's blueprint, the elec-
 torate is to be organized into small
 neighborhood "congresses," trade unions,
 and  "people's  committees"  to give
 Qadhafi's tribal supporters maximum
 representation. The  General People's
 Congress will serve as a national parlia-
 ment and is also supposed to elect a
 president-presumably Qadhafi-who is
 to have vaguely defined but no doubt
 sweeping powers.
 Much of what Qadhafi has said about
 the new government and the way he has
 orchestrated its promotion are reminis-
 cent of old-fashioned tribal politics.
 Meetings over the past several months to
 discu;s the plan have consisted of debates
 over local interests., with Qadhafi receiv-
 ing as well as issuing criticism and advice
 but always acting as final arbiter. Most of
 the people in his audiences seemed to en-
 joy the exchange and appeared ready to
 do his bidding.
 Reaction
 Much of the military, especially the
 officer corps, probably regards Qadhafi's
 move as a simple power play that will lead
 to further changes in the officer corps and
 a general diminution of the importance of
 the armed forces.
 It is not clear that this cynicism extends
 to the ranks. Most enlisted men come
 from Bedouin families whose lot has im-
 proved markedly under Qadhafi's rule.
 While moving against many officers,
 moreover, Qadhafi has been careful to
 cultivate their subordinates. In addition to
 keeping salaries of the enlisted men
 relatively high, he has repeatedly ad-
 monished officers to follow the example
 of the "loyal" rank and file.
 Libya's small educated middle class
 probably views the government restruc-
 turing with alarm. The traditional com-
 mercial establishment and the new class
 of professionals and businessmen have
 never been sympathetic to Qadhafi's
 military dictatorship. Now they are even
 more fearful of his turn toward tribal
 politics.
 Qadhafi has coupled his elevation of
 tribal groups with repeated verbal attacks
 on the urban "bourgeoisie" and a number
 of policy moves against the private sector
 of the economy. In the past, the business
 community has been able to fight a
 successful rear-guard action by simply
 delaying, ignoring, or evading his decrees.
 This may become increasingly difficult as
 tribal and rural leaders-who have a
 strong bias against the urban es-
 tablishment-become more politicized.
 Economic growth in the 24 industrialized countries linked
 in the OECD probably will be somewhat less this year than in
 1976 Unemployment in these countries as a whole is not likely
 to be significantly reduced.
 As a group, the 24 industrialized coun-
 tries that are members of the Organiza-
 tion for Economic Cooperation and
 Development seem on the way to
 moderate economic: growth-an increase
 of about 4 percent in real Gross National
 Product-in 1977. This increase
 woulc. be somewhat less than last year's
 and less than the increases achieved in
 past recovery periods. Consumer prices
 seem likely to rise at an average of about
 8 percent, which is near last year's pace.
 Investment in plant and equipment
 probably will remain a weak element in
 the recovery. Potential investors in vir-
 tually all the OECD countries are dis-

 couraged by slow expansion of real con-
 sumer demand, the presence of con-
 siderable excess capacity, and rising costs.
 In several countries-notably France,
 Italy, Canada, Spain and Portugal-
 political uncertainty is another serious
 depressant.
 The expected increase in production
 would not reduce unemployment percep-
 tibly in the OECD countries as a whole;
 growing labor forces and rising produc-
 tivity will offset the increase in real de-
 mand. In fact, joblessness will increase
 from present high levels i n a number of
 countries.
 Varied Growth Rates
 The pace of economic activity will con-
 tinue to vary considerably within the
 OECD group. Japan and West Germany,
 the members with the biggest economies
 after the US, will do comparatively well.
 In Japan, stimulative measures now
 contemplated should yield a real GNP in-
 crease of 6 percent despite a general
 slackening  in  foreign demand for
 Japanese exports. In West Germany, the
 government seems committed to in-
 troducing mild expansionary measures
 this summer that should enable produc-
 tion to grow at 4.5 percent. The forecast
 of faster growth in the Big Three than in
 the remainder of the OECD implies that
 Big Three current balances will
 deteriorate from the relatively strong
 positions of last year.
 The UK, France, Italy, and Canada all

 SECRET
 are pursuing policies that can be
 characterized as cautious to restrictive.
 Slow real growth will be an inevitable side
 effect of policies aimed at slowing infla-
 tion and reducing current-account
 deficits. Of the four countries in this sub-
 group, only Canada is likely to achieve 4
 percent real growth this year; at the other
 extreme, Italy's production will stagnate.
 The smaller OECD countries will re-
 main pretty much on their present courses
 in terms of economic policy and perfor-
 mance. For the majority this means
 cautious policies, continued slow growth,
 and further increases in unemployment.
 Only Greece, Turkey, and oil-rich
 Norway are likely to increase production
 5 percent or more.
 The governments of Japan and West
 Germany, the major foreign candidates
 for the faster growth that would attract
 imports and further the international
 recovery, are reluctant to undertake
 greater stimulation. Both fear the effect of
 domestic inflation, and the West Germans
 cite technical problems that would impede
 the implementation of tax cuts or spen-
 ding increases. Japan's current-account
 surplus already seems likely to decline by
 $3 billion this year, and West Germany's
 probably will slip too.
 The smaller OECD countries having
 relatively  strong  current-account
 positions-Belgium, the Netherlands,
 Norway, and Switzerland-are unlikely
 sources of greater stimulation at this time.
 The first three have serious inflation
 problems, and the conservative Swiss are
 determined to avoid that difficulty. The
 Swiss political system, moreover, does not
 lend itself to bold action, and unemploy-
 ment is not high enough to generate much
 pressure for stimulation.
 Impact of Stimulation
 In any case, the international linkages
 are such that very large increments in
 GNP would be required in any one of the
 Big Three to produce substantial effects
 on other countries' real growth and
 current-account balances.
 The impact within the Big Three and
 the induced effects elsewhere would be
 considerably greater if stimulation were
 applied simultaneously throughout the
 Big Three-and the results would be still
 greater if the strongly positioned smaller
 OECD countries also stimulated their
 economies. Even in this case, however, the
 effect on the rest of the world's problems
 would be limited. Stimulative policies

 Southeast Asia. The countries of that region are wary of the
 Japanese and will ask a high price for any new relationships and
 seek guarantees against political interference.
 might yield a psychological boost that
 could bring a widespread increase in
 private investment, but it is very difficult
 to quantify the likely extent of such an
 effect.
 Stimulation by the better-positioned
 OECD countries would benefit the
 current accounts of other OECD coun-
 tries more than the accounts of those
 developing countries that are not
 members of the Organization of
 Petroleum Exporting Countries. This is
 because most OECD trade takes place
 within the group. If the seven stronger
 OECD countries all undertook stimula-
 tion, probably over half the current-
 account gain would accrue to non-
 stimulating OECD countries and about 20
 percent each to the OPEC and non-OPEC
 developing countries.
 The source of improvement in the
 current-account balances of the
 nonstimulating countries would, of course,
 be deterioration in the balances of the
 stimulating countries. The stimulating
 countries, moreover, would have to accept
 bigger governmental budget deficits and
 some increase in inflation above rates that
 otherwise  could  be  achieved.
 9      Japan: More Interest in SoutheinaSt Asia
 The Japanese are moving toward a
 more active role in Southeast Asia. The
 trend is certain to unfold slowly because
 the Southeast Asians are wary and the
 Japanese are proceeding cautiously. Still,
 the potential impact of heightened
 Japanese attention on the region's
 economic development-and at least in-
 directly                                                    on   Asian   security
 relationships-is great.
 Japan took cautious initiatives in
 Southeast Asia last year, offering to act as
 a bridge between Hanoi and the Associa-
 tion of Southeast Asian Nations. Neither
 party  responded  positively-the  Viet-
 namese and ASEAN states continued to
 clash verbally-apparently leading Tokyo
 to conclude that such an even-handed ap-
 proach was unworkable..
 In November, Tokyo clearly decided to
 give priority to its ties with ASEAN,
 proposing regular consultations with the
 organization. ASEAN accepted the offer,
 and it recently proposed that the first
 talks be held in Jakarta this month.
 The Japanese Foreign Ministry also un-
 Approved For Release 2008/07/02 : CIA-RDP79-00927A011500100001-5
 !1442'00
 dertook detailed planning late last year,
 and the Tokyo press-evidently using
 government backgrounders-has echoed
 the line that Japan should attempt to
 "perfect" relations with the ASEAN
 state;, while "maintaining a dialogue"
 with the Indochinese countries.
 This year, the Fukuda government is
 continuing the same policy line. Japan has
 anncunced that a larger share of
 economic assistance will go to ASEAN
 state:; than in previous years; visits by
 Foreign Minister Hatoyama are set for
 this spring, and there is talk of visits by
 Prime Minister Fukuda in the summer.
 A major factor motivating Tokyo is its
 long-standing desire to ensure Japanese
 access to Southeast Asian resources and
 markets. Increasingly, however, Japanese
 thinking about the region appears to be
 taking a broader perspective.
 The US embassy in Tokyo reports a
 slowly building consensus among
 Japanese leaders that Japan ought to have
 a "special relationship" with Southeast
 Asia similar to West European - African
 and US - Latin American ties. Some
 Japanese leaders, such as former prime
 minister Miki, like to think of their coun-
 try as Asia's spokesman in the West.
 The obstacles to such a relationship,
 both in Japan and Southeast Asia, are
 substantial. The Japanese are wary of
 becoming involved in big-power or local
 rivalries in what they see as a volatile
 region. The resentment against Japan that
 welled up during former prime minister
 Tanaka's Southeast Asian trip in 1974
 made a lasting impression on Tokyo.
 A Japanese military role in the region is
 still  unthinkable,  and the Japanese
 Finance Ministry remains generally op-
 posed to providing any large-scale aid. At
 the same time, there appears to be an un-
 derlying assumption in Tokyo that a more
 active Japanese role would not only help
 focus Southeast Asia economically on
 Japan and the West, but also contribute
 eventually to regional stability and securi-
 ty.
 The Southeast Asians, fearing new
 forms of Japanese imperialism and ex-
 ploitation, will ask a high price from
 Tokyo. They want not only aid but also
 stable and preferential markets for
 semiprocessed as well as raw materials;
 they also want more control over
 Japanese investment and technology.
 The ASEAN states certainly want no
 political interference from Tokyo, but
 they apparently believe the Japanese can
 carry out some limited political tasks
 useful to the region.
 The US military withdrawal from
 mainland Southeast Asia apparently
 helped stimulate Tokyo's heightened in-
 terest in the region. Japan's role is still
 significantly affected by US policy, and
 Tokyo will be looking for assurances that
 the US intends to remain active in the
 region and that Japan will not be moving
 into an ex osed position
