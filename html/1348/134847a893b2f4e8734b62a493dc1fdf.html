	  	-		     	JAPAN  MUST  FACE  FACTS,   	INCREASE  DEFENSE  BUDGET
				 	Tokyo  BUSINESS  JAPAN  in  English  Feb  81  p  7												 	-
				  	[Article  by  Maeamichi  Inoki,  Chairman,  Peace  and  Security  Research  Institute]
				  	[Text]			  	S  is well  known,  che Ministry of Finance occupies an especially high position				     	-
								  	A  among Japanese  government  ministries.  The  fact  that  it was the only min-~
								   	istry  before  and  during  the war  not  headed by a military man shows that it pos-
								   	sesses  an  excellent  tradition.  However,  it  would  appear  on  the basis  of recent
								   	press  stories that  this ministry, supposedly with a concentration of elite talent, is
								   	making a terrible mistake.
										I  was  astounded  by  a  frontpage  story  in  the  December  4  issue  of the Sankei
								   	Shimbun (Tokyo morning edition). The article stated:
										"In  regard  to  defense  costs  in  the  general  budgetary  demands, the  Defense
								   	~tinistry's  request  for  special  treatment  outside  the  budgetary  framework  has
								   	been  approved  in  essence  and  the  agency  has  submitted  a  demand  for  a  9.7%
								   	increase  over  this  year's  budget.  This  fact  }ias  been  explained  ro  the  U.S.  and
	 	a								uther  countries.  However,  forced  to  limit  increases  in  its  general  account
								   	e~penditures,  excluding  defense and grants to local administrations, to 4~Io in the
								   	face  of  the  severe  government  financial  situation,  the  Finance  ltinistry  is
								   	claiming  that  it cannot grant large�s~ale increases for defen~e costs alone, and for
								   	this reason, it can allow an increase in the  range  of only 7%."
	  	"							   	There  are  two  reasons  for  my  surprise  upon  reading  this  article.  One  is  the
								   	Finance  Ministry's  claim  that  the  need  to  hold  down  any  defense  spending
								   	increase  to  7~o is  due  to the deteriorated government finances which forced it to
								   	limit  the  increase  in  general  account  expenditures  to  4%.  According  to  the
								   	December  8  issue  of the  Sankei Shimbun, the Finance  Ministry strongly insisted
								   	"it  is  out  of the  question  to  raise  defense  spending  alone by 9.7% when general
								   	account expenditures are being raised by only  3.4%."
										If  the  Finance  Ministry  has  such  a strong  feeling  for  the  need  for  balanced
	  	-							 	spendings,  then  I  would  like  to  ask  why  in  1967  when  the  general account was
								   	increased  by  14.8%,  the  defense  budget  was  limited to only  11.8%and in  1973,
								   	when the  former was increased by 24.6%, che latter was held dewn to  16.9%.
										When  it is seen  chat the increase rado for spendings un welfare, education and
								   	public  projects  was  well  above  that  for  defense,  the  current  Finance  Ministry's
	  	-								explanation  of balanced  expenditures  is merely  an  excuse  and  the  truth  of the
								   	matter is  that the ministry is taking the defense  issue lightly.
	 	-							 	Difference  Between West  German  Dafense Capability
										The  responsibility,  of  course,  for  holding  down  defen~e  spending below  the				    	_
								   	increase  level  of  general  account  expenditures  normally  lies  with  government
								   	leadership.   	However,  From  the  viewpoint  of  compilation  processes  of  this
								   	country's  annual  budget,  the  Finance  Ministry  must  also  share  the  blame.  As a

							 	Even  me*e  astonishing nonsensical is the  Finance Ministry's claim that even if
		-					    	the  increase  is  limited  to  7%,  it  would  still  enable  Japan  t~  maintain  the  0.9
						     	percent-to-GNP  ~eve1  in  its defense  spendings  and  that  the  real increase will  oe
		_					    	3%plus  thus  approximating  the  figur~  for  West  Germany.  What  does  the
		-					    	maintenance   	of  che  0.9%  of  the  GNP-level  actually  mean?  What  kind  of
						     	sensitivity  lies  b~tund  the  claim  of the  need  for  only  maintain a figure witich
						     	has been harshly  crii.icized by the U.S. and NATO countries as a free ride?							  	-
							 	Over  the  past  20 years, West German  defense budgets have consistently been
						     	much  higher  than  those  of Japan  and  for  this  reason,  a real  increase  of 3% by
						     	West  Cerrnany  has gr~eat  significance. In  contrast,  Japan's defense capability has
						     	had  serious  defects  due  to  foot-dragging  in  budgetary  appropriadons over  the
						     	past  ?0  years,  as  revealed in  "Defense  of Japan."  Hence  it  is  clear  to everyone						 	_
						     	that  with  the  almost  irresponsibly  small  r~al  increase  of 3% by Japan, there can
		-					    	be no ;.mprovement in Japan's defense capability.

			    	[Text]    	Growing  Use  of  Microprocessors
			   	A  great  change  has  occurred  in  the  structure  of   	the  machine  industry  due  to  the
	  	-		 	development  of  LSI  in  the  late  1960's  and  the  appearance  of  the  microprocessor  in
			   	the  early  1970's.    	Conventional  machine  industry  products  have  entered  the  new
			   	category  of  "mechatronics"   	(mechanica.l  +  electronics)   	through  the  active  applica-
			    	tion  of  microelectronics  technology.
			   	This  qualitative  change  in  mechanical  products,   	the  unification  of  machinery  and
			   	electronics,  began  in  the  1950's,  way  before  LSI  and  microprocessors  appeared.    	It
			   	was  stimulated  by  the  development  and  ir.dustrial  application  of  the  transistor.
			    	This  technological  revolution  brought  new  products  into  existence  such  as  indus-
			    	trial  robots  and  numerically  controlled  machine   	tools.    	However,   	the  appearance  of
	  	-		 	LSI  and  the  microprocessor  had  a  wide-rangir?g  inf luence  on  all  products  related  to
			    	the  machine  industry,   	from  machine  tools  to  precision  machinery,   	automobiles,   	ships,
			    	communications  equipment,   	and  home  electrical  products.    	In  particular,   	the  appear-
			    	ance  of  the  microprocessor  dramatically  raised  the  cost  performance  of  industrial
	   	.		 	robots  and  NC   	(numerically  controlled)  machine  tools  as  well  as  greatly  changed  the
			    	product  character  of  office  machines,  communications  equipment,  measuring  equipment,
			    	optical  equipment  such  as  cameras,  medical  equipment,  h~me  electrical  products,   	and
			    	audio  products.    	And  as  a  result,   	the  structure  of  market  competition  is  undergoing
			    	tremendous  changes.
			    	For  example,   	in  the  field  of  machine  tools,   	the  use  of  nume-rical  control  with  the
			    	application  of  IC's  and  LSI's  has  brought  about  changes  in  the  composition  of  parts
			    	used  in  manufacturing  machine  tools.    	Electronic  parts  now  account  for  a  large  part
			    	of  the  total  cost.    	Also,   	the  importance  of  microelectronics  has  grown  in  tech-
			    	nological  development--the  key  to  success  in  market  competition.    	This  technology
			    	is  central  to  NC  machine  tools,   	and  a  growing  number  of  machine  tool  manufacturers
			    	are  setting  up  new  electronics  technology  development  departments.    	In  this   	field,
			    	el.ectronic  equipment  manufacturers  such  as  Fujitsu  ranuc  and  Mitsubishi  Electric
			    	are  taking  the  lead  in  the  application  of  electronics  to  machinery.

				     	This   	trend  of  applying  electronics  to  machinery  by  use  of  the  microprocessor  is
				     	widespread.    	In  addition  to  machine  tools,   	it  includes  packaging  machines,   	scales,
	     	.				agricultural  equipment,   	freight-handling  equipment,   	and  also  sewing  machines,
				     	cameras,   	and  recreational  equipment.    	It  could  be  called  a  new  wave  in  the  machine
				     	industry,   	and  in  general  this  gro~ath  of  "mechatronics"  increases  the  added  value  of
				     	machine  products,  makes  product  discrimination  possible,   	and  increases  international
				     	competitiveness.    	But  at   	the  same  time,   	dramatic  changes  are  underway  in  the  struc-
				     	ture  of  machine  industry  market  competition  due  to   	the  progress  of  "mechatronics."
				     	The  biggest  change  is  that  electronics-related  industries  such  as  computer,   	semi-
				     	conductor,   	and  electrical  products  manufacturers  are  beginning  to  have  a  great   	deal
	     	_				of  influence  on  the  machine  industry.    	In  the  NC  macfiine  tool  field,   	the  added  value
				     	accompanying  improved  performance  and  greater  use  of  electronics,  which  in  the  past
	     	-				would  have  gone  to  the  machine  manufacturers,   	is  being  taken  away  by  the  the  elec-
				     	tronics  manufac~urers.    	In   	the   	field  of  packaging  machines,   	cnmpanies  which
				     	previously  had  no  connection  with  the  field  whatsoever,   	such  as  Tokyo  Electric  and
				     	Ishida  Koki  Seisakusho,   	have  come  in  with  microcomputer  technology  and  are  rapidly			_
				     	eating  away  at  the  market.    	The  wrapping  and  packing  machine  industry  has  had  a
				     	market   	of   	less   	than  150  billion  yen,   	and  wi~h  400  manufacturers  struggling  for  it,
	     	-				competition  has  been  excessive.    	Now,   	the  advent  of  the  microprocessor  is  a  new		    	-
				     	cause  of   	competition.    	This  is  also  true  for  weighing  and  measuring  equipment  and
				     	automatic  knitting  machines.    	The  appearance  of  the  microprocessor  has  had  a  great
				     	impact   	on  the  structure  of  sectors  dominated  by  small  and  medium  enterprises  as  well
				     	as  on  the  home  electrica].  produc:.s  market,  which  is  dominated  by  large  industries.
	     	~				The  Role   	of  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  System  Houses
				     	The   	term  "microcomputer  revolution"  probably  has  a  more  insistent  impact  on  the
	    	-				smaller  machine  manufacturers  than  on  large  industries.    	At  any  rate,   	this  kind  of
				     	technology  has  the  power  to  directly  affect  the  life  of.  a  business.    	Stated  dif-

				     	losing  out  and,   	conversely,   	fast  application  means   	growth  for  a  company.    	But   	there
				     	are  many  medium  and  small  enterprises   	that  develop  unique  "mechatronic"  products  and

			  	These  small  and  medium  machine  manufacturers  began  this  development  of  electronics		     	_
			  	applications  in  mach?nes  between  1977  and  1978,   	and  more  kinds  of  companies  are
			  	becoming  involved  every  year.    	Among  them  are  local  industries  that   	organize  micro-
			  	computer  application  study   	groups  which  include   	industrial  sectors  connect~d  ~dith
			  	prefectural  industrial  development.    	The  applica tion  of  electronics   	to  machinery
	 	_		 	has  become  a  major  trend  that  cannot  be  avoided  by  small  and  medium  machine  manu-
			  	facturers  trying  to  open  up  new  markets.
			  	In  connection  with  promoting  the  application  of   	electronics  to  machinery  by  small
	 	~		 	and  medium  machine  mar.ufacturers,  we  must  touch   	on   	the  role  of  the  system  house,   	an
			  	industrial  organization  set  up   	for  development.     	The  definition  of  a  syster.i  house
			  	is  not   	definite  yet,   	but   	in  geueral  it  is  understood  to  be  an  enterprise  which			    	_
			  	specializes  in  system  design  with  the  use  of  microprocessors  or  microcomputers.			   	-
			  	There  are  some  170  system  h~uses  established  throughout  Japan,  with  wide-ranging
			   	activities  including  production  and  sales  of  the ir  own  products  using  microcomputers,
			   	commissioned  de~elopment,   	cooperative  development,   	and  consulting  (on  the  use  of
			  	microcomputers).    	There  are  two  main  types  of  sy stem  h~uses:    	enterprises  which  do
			   	subcontracted  work  for  large  industries  and  develop  speciall}~  ordered  products,   	and
			   	enterprises  which  develop  mass-production  products   	such  as  personal   	computers  and		     	-
	 	-		 	system  analyzers  in  order   	to  manufacture  tl~e  sy stems  themselves.							 	_
	 	-		 	Hosaever,  viewed  as  a  propelling  for~e  for  "mechatronics,"   	they  are  staking  out  ter-
			   	ritory  in  their  fields  of   	specialization  supporting  the  use  of  microcomputers  in
			   	various  fields  of  machine   	industry  products,  sucr~  as  measuring  instruments,  machine
			   	tools,   	agricultural  equipment,   	~aedical  equipment,   	data  communications  terminals,
			   	etc.
			   	Strengthening  of  International  Competitiveness											    	_
			   	The  unique  "mechatronics"  products  recently  being  unveiled  one  after  another  by
			   	small  and  medium  machine  manufacturers  ar~  becoming  very  competitive  in  overseas
			   	markets  as  well  as  in  domestic  markets.    	For  example,   	the  automatic   	dicer  for  IC
			   	wafers  developed  by  Disco  K.K.   	has  secured  98  p ercent  of  the  domestic  market  share
	  	'		  	and  60  percent  of  the  world  market.    	Originally,   	this   	compaay  manufactured  grinding
			   	stones   	for  machine  tools.    	However,   	it  made  ef�orts  to  develop  cutting  technology
			   	for  IC  silicon  wafers  as   	the  semiconductor  indus try  grew.    	The  results  became  known
			   	and  contributed  to  the  growth  of  the  company.    	The  company  developed  the  wafer  dicer
	  	_		  	in  1975,  and  in  1979,   	after  further  improvements,   	it  developed  the  world`s   	first
			    	fully  automatic  dicing  saw  (a  totally  automated   	device  for  the  silicon  wafer  cut-		     	_
	 	-		  	ting  process).    	'fhe  motiv~tion  of  this  "mechatronics"  product  development  was  the
			    	fierce  battle  among   	the  semiconductor  manufacturers  to  lower  costs.    	AlI  semicon-		     	^
			    	ductor  manufacturin~  companies  are  working  hard   	to  achieve  more  automation  as  the
			   	key  to    	reducing  costs.    	Because  of   	tliis  situation,   	che  Disco  Company,   	as  a  manu-
			    	facturer  of  grinding  and   	cutting  stones,  develop ed  an  ultrahigh-precision  cutting
			    	machine.    	The  company  is   	small,  with  81  million  yen  in  capital  and   	380  employees,
			    	but  with  this  new  technology  it  has  made  a  vigorous  entry  into  the  world  market  as
	  	.		  	we11  as  the  domestic  market.    	In  1975y   	it  opened  an  American  branch  in  Mountain

					While  large-scale  industries  keep  plenty  of  electronics  engineers  inside  the  company,	 	_
					they  also  utilize  the  strength  of  systems  companies  which  are  more  flexible  as   	they
					work  hard  to  increase   	their  competitiveness  in  electromechanical  devices.    	By  this
					method,   	Japan  has  come  to  be  recognized  as  a  leader,   	along  with  the  United  States
		.				and  West  Germany,   	in  the  applic~~ion  of  electronics  technology  to  the  machine  indus-
     	-				try.     	For  example,  METALWORKING  NEWS,   	a  machine  industry  trade  journal,   	predicts		  	-
					that  Japan  will  achieve  tremendous  international  competiveness  in  the  1980's  in  all
     	-				fields  of  machine  industry,   	including  NC  machine  tools  and  industrial  robots.
					This   	trend  is  already  materializing.    	For  example,   	in  the  area  of  NC  machine  tools,
					a   	typical  "mechatronic"  product,   	Japan  has  become  more  competitive  than  either  the	     	`
					Uni~ed  States  or  West  Germany.    	At  first,  Japan  had  a  chronic  import  surplus  in
					machine  tools  from  the  United  States  and  West  Germany,  which  had  had  advanced
		-				machine  indus;.ries   	for  a   	long  time.    	In  the  late   	1970's,   	however,  as  the  use  of  NC
					devices  with  built-in  microcomputers  became  co~mnon,   	exports  to  the  United  States
					and  West  Germany  had  a  sudden  spurt  of  growth,  and  in  1978  Japan  had  an  export
					surplus  in  trade  with  [dest  Germany.    	In  particular,   	the  amount  of  exports  to  the
					United  States  in  1979  was   	12   	times  the  amount  of   	imports,   	and  Japan  was  180  billion
     	-				yen  in  the  black.    	In  trade  with  West  Germany,  we  were  4.5  billion  yen  in  the  black~
					The  machines   	exported  to  both  countries  are  of  the  most  advanced  types,   	including			_
					NC  machines.    	In  1979,   	49.2  billion  yen  worth  of  exports   	to  the  United  States,   	or
					73  percent  of  the  total,   	were  in  NC  machines.    	Some  79  percent  of  the  amount  of		    	~
					exports  to  West  Germany  was  also   	in  NC  machines.     	(.See  table).
					A  rapid  growth  in  exports   	is  also  expected  in  the  1980's   	for  industrial  robots,		    	~
					which  are  closely  associated  with  machine  tools.    	A~cording  to  a  survey  by  the		     	~

			   	and  appliance  industries,   	the  chemical  industry,   	safe  and  vaul.t  manufacturers,   	and
			   	the  steel  industry.    	The  automobile  industry  began  using  robots  very  early  to
			   	improve  productivity  and  become  mo~re  competitive  internationally.    	1980  has  been
			   	called  the  "base  year  of  industrial  robot  dissemination."    	Many  government  measures
			  	have  been  carried  out,   	such  as  establishing  an  industrial  robot  leasing  system  with
 ~			 	government  loans   	(from  the  Japan  Development  Bank)   	and  inclusion  of  industrial		     	-
			   	robots  in  a  special  loan  system  for  industrial  safety  and  hygiene  facilities.
			  	However,   	these  moves  on  the  part  of  Japan  are  being  looked  upon  with  suspicion  by
			   	the  countries  of  Europe  and  the  United  States.    	For  example,   	the  "United  States
  _	 	.	     	Japan  Trade  Report"  presented  last  Sep~ember  in  the  Trade  Subcommittee  of  the  U.S.
			  	House  of  Representatives  mentions  that  industrial  robots  and  machine  tools  are
			  	moving  in,   	along  with  computers  and  semiconductors,   	as  long-term  industrial  prob-
			   	lems  between  the  United  States  and  Japan  in  addition  to  the  present  causes  of
			   	economic  friction  such  as   	the  automobile  and  NTT  problems.    	Chapter  5  of  the  report	    	,
			   	states  that  in  the  advanced  technological  fields  of  semiconductors,   	computers,   	and
			   	the  "mechatronics"  products  described  above,   	Japan  is  gaining  the  lead  or  has  al-		 	-
			   	ready  surpassed  the  United  States.    	In  response  to  this  trend,   	the  report  warns,
  .			 	the  U.S.   	Government  and  U.S.   	industry  must  work  out  e`fective  countermeasures.
			  	The  following  kind  of  awareness  about  industrial  robots  and  machine  tools  under		    	-
			   	scrutiny  here  is  presented.    	"Japan  is  the  world  leader  in  the  field  of  robot
			   	engineering--the  use  of  inechanical  operatin~  devices  for  groups  of  machines  which
			   	carry  out  repetitive  or  dangerous  assembly  operations.    	The  use  of  robots  not  only
			   	aids  in  controlling  costs  and  impr�oving  productivity,  but  it  also  helps  improve
			   	quality  by  eliminating  the  human.  error  which  creeps  into  monotonous  or  difficult
			  	work.    	Robot  technology  was  originally  systematized  in  the  United  States,  but  ac-
			   	cording  to  the  estimate  of  Nomura  Securities,   	there  are  now  135  robot  manufacturing
			   	plants  in  Japan  and  only  40  or  50  in  the  United  States  and  Western  Europe  together.
			   	It  is  said  that   	there  are  10  times  as  many  industrial  robots  in  operation  right  now
			   	in  Japan  as  in  the  United  States  and  Europe."
			   	In  short,   	there  is  a  huge  difference  between  Japan  and  the  United  States  in  the
			   	field  of  industrial  robots.    	Also,   	on  the  basis  of  this  awareness,   	the  report
 -			 	analyzes  the  role  played  by  MITI  in  the  development  of  Japan's  industrial  robots
			  	and  suggests   	that   	tax  measures  and  technological  development  like  that  being  car-
 _			 	ried  out  in  Japan  are  necessary  for   	the  United  States.
 -			 	The  following  stat~ment  is  made  with  regard  to  machine  tools:    	"Japan  is  becoming
			  	a  major  exporter  of  machine  tools,   	and  this  will  probably  lead  to  future  trade
			   	friction.    	Japan  is  especially  competitive  in  the  development  of  high-level,			  	-
			  	numerically  controlled   	(NC)   	machines  using  microprocessors."
  -			 	The  threat  of  NC  machine   	tools  is  more  real  than  that  of  industrial  robots.    	In
 _			 	fact  the  rapid  growth  oE  NC  machine  tool  exports  to  the  United  States,   	chiefly

		    	should  be  included  in  the  world  market  strategy  of  Japanese  industry  to  cope  with
		    	this  situation.    	These  measures  would  include  suitable  industrial  coordination  and
		    	steps  to  avoid  friction,   	such  as  local  production,   	sales  agreements  with  local					=
     	-	     	mariufacturers,   	and  mutual  development  projects.
		    	Increased  trade  friction  may  be  considered  harmful  to  Japanese  industry  over  the
		    	long  term,   	so  our  influence  on  local  industry  in  the  countries  that  import  Japanese
		    	goods  must  be  considered  carefully.    	Especially  with  electromechanical  products,
		    	there  is  a  great  possibility  of  causing  labor  and  social  problems  as  well  as				  	-
		    	adversely  affecting  local  industry.    	For  example,   	in  the  past  few  years  a  negative
		    	influence  on  the  microcomputer  industry  is  drawing  attention,   	especially  in  Europe,
		    	and  a  nu~ber  of  surveys  and  reports  are  being  prepared  by  both  the  public  and
		    	p:.ivate  sectors.    	Labor  officials  are  especially  concerned  about  this  problem.    	This
		    	is  because  "mechatronics"  products  such  as  industrial  robots  are  usually  developed
     	-	     	as  effective  labor-saving  devices  for  the  factory  or  office,   	and  there  is  great
		    	concern  about  resultant  unemployment.    	Microprocessors  are  referred  to  in  Europe
		    	as  a  new  teehnology,   	and  their  impact  on  employment  is  feared.    	As  this  tendency
		    	develops,   	the  international  competition  related  to  Japanese  eldctromechanical  pro-
		    	ducts  may  take  on  new  dimensions  that  go  beyond  simple  business  strategy.

			   	[Article  by  EKONOMISUTO  editorial  staff]
			   	[Text]    	Japanese  National  Project  Method												    	_
			  	At  th~  end  of  1979   	the  cumulative  total  of  Japanese  postwar  overseas  investment  ex-	     	-
			  	ceeded  30  billion  dollars.    	The  expansion  in  overseas  investment  has  resulted  in
			  	many  so-called  "big  projects."    	Big  pro,jects  are,   	gen~rally  speaking,   	large-scale
			  	pro~ects  in  which  large  amounts  of  capital  are  invested.    	Each  of  these  big  projects	    	-
			  	involves  a  number  of  companies  or  whole  industries,   	and  has  great  significance  for
   	-		    	both  industry  and  the  national  economy.    	This  report  is  an  overview  of  big  projects
			  	which  involve  large-scale  plant  and  equipment,   	such  as  resource  development  pro-
			  	~ects  and  steel  and  petrochemical  pro~ects.											     	-
			  	Although  all  are  called  big  projects,   	they  take  a  variety  of  forms.    	They  can,
			  	however,  be  roughly  classified  into  three  groups  based  on  how  averseas  expansion  is
			  	achieved.																				  	-
			  	Japanese  Enterprise  Leadership:    	In  these  projects  Japanese  firms  bear  the  financial,
			  	operational  and  sales  responsibilities,   	and  receive  all  or  most  of  the  resources
			  	developed.    	Japanese  f3rms  generally  provide  all  the  financing,  or  more  than  50
   	-		    	percent.    	Most  projects  are  promoted  in  developing  countries.    	Examples  are  Arabian
			  	oil,  Abu  Dhabi  oil,  Asahan  aluminum,  Alaska  pulp,   	Zaire  copper  mines,  Mamut  copper
			  	mines,   	Iranian  petrochemical  and  Singapore  petrochemical  projects.    	The  Qatar  steel
			  	mill  belongs  to  this  category  even  though  Japan  has  a  minority  share.
			  	Import-heavy  Participation:    	These  projects  are  usually  undertaken  in  combination
   	-		    	with  enterprises  of  advanced  countries,  with  3apanese  firms  holding  up  to  a  50
			  	percent  interest  and  a  corresponding  financial  responsibility.    	The  Japanese  firms
			  	sometimes  receive  developed  resources  over  and  above  the  investment  share.    	Operation
			  	is  generally  left  to  partner  firms.    	Examples  are  ADMA  oil  development,   	Indonesian
			  	oil,   	Brunei  LNG,  Malaysian  LNG,  Niger  uranium,   	Ranger  uranium,   	NZAS  aluminum,  VENALUM,
   	-		    	Robe  River  iron  ore  and  Bowen  coal.
			  	Investment-Purchases/Advance  Payment  for  Imports:    	In  these  projects,   	financing  is
			 	providing  to  the  operating  entity  as  development  capital  for  new  projects,   	or  capital
			  	is  provided  for  expansion  of  existing  projects,   	or  import  costs  are  paid  in  advance;

		    	in  return  Japanese  firms  receive  long-term  imports  of  ore  or  other  resources.    	This
    	-	     	method  is  widely  used  for  Indonesian  LNG,   	enriched  uranium,   	iron  ore,  unprocessed
		    	coal,   	copper  and  so  on.    	Recently  there  have  also  been  projects  involving  oil  from
		    	Indonesia  or  Mexico,  although  in  the  past  these  countries  had  been  developing  oil
		    	products  independently  for  the  most  part.
		    	The  term  "national  projects"  has  come  to  be  much  used  lately.    	This   	term  generally			 	-
		    	indicates   	those  projects  where,  a~  in  the  case  of  the  Iranian  petrochemical  project,
		    	the  government  ohtains  a  cabinet  decision  to  nrovide  necessary  assistance  via  con-
     	~	     	cerned  government  agencies  or  via  the  Overseas  Economic  Corporation  Fund  (hereafter
		    	referred  to  as  the  Fund).    	The  terms  "national  project"  suggests  government  manage-
		    	ment  or  leadership,   	but  these  are  large  projects  wiiere  decisions  and  risks  belong
		    	entirely  to  private  firms.    	Still,   	from  the  perspective  of  economic  cooperation
		    	with  other  countries  and  in  terms  of  securing  resources  and  industrial  sites  for
		    	Japan,   	the  government  and  the  private  sector  do  have  a  large  degree  of  unity  whi:h
		    	can  be  characterized  as  "Japan  Incorporated."
		    	Thus  the  government  provides  aid  by  negotiating  with  the  other  government  to  formu-
		    	late  the  project,   	and  to  lay  out  the  foundations  for  the  work.    	Financing  is  pro-
		    	vided  in  tt-.e  form  of  yen  loans,  investment  by  the  Fund  or  the  Petroleum  Development
     	.	     	Corporation,   	(both  government-relatecl  bodies),   	and  in  the  form  of  borrowing,
		    	usually  in  all  cases,  from  the  Export-Import  Bank  or  from  others.
		    	But  a  close  look  at  "national  projects"  shows  that  they  correspond  almost  exactly
		    	with  big  projects  of  the  Japanese  enterprise  leadership  type;   	the  main  ones  are  ADMA,
		    	Asahan,  Amazon  Aluminum,   	Japan-Brazil  paper  and  pulp,  Alaska  pulp,  Usiminas  iron
		    	mi11,  Mexican  large-diameter  pipe/cast-forged  steel,   	Iranian  petrochemicals,
		     	Singapore  petrochemicals,   	Saudi  methanol,   	Japan-Brazil  agricultural  developmenti  etc.

		     	With  the  OPEC  price  increases  and   	the  rush  to  participate  in  oil  development  projects,			_
		     	Japan  has   	increasingly  encouraged  oil  exploration  and  development  projects  during
		     	the  mid-1960's  and   	the  mid-1970's.    	But  there  have  been  few  development  successes;				-
		     	there  are  now  only  about  ten  pro~ects  which  provide  Japan  with  imports  of  crude  oi?_
		     	Japan's  "independently  developed  crude"  secured  from  overseas  projects  came  to  25
		     	million  kiloliters  in  1979,  about  nine  percent  of  all  the  crude  oil  Japan  imports.
		     	The  greatest  source  of  imports  is  Arabian  oil   	(13  million  kiloliters),   	followed  by

				Indonesia  LNG   	(Badak    	in  East  Kalimantan  and  Arul  in  Northern  Sumatra)
		_	     	Pertamina  will  build  liquefaction  plants--two  systems  in  Badak  and  three  in  Arul
				(using  the  MCR  method  of  America's  Air  Products  Co.,   	1.6  million  tons  per  system).
		     	Mdst  of  the  funding  will  be  provided  by  Japan,   	in  return  for  which  Kansai  Electric
		     	and  five  other  users  are  to  receive  7.5  million  tons  of  LNG  per  year  for  20  years.
		     	This  concept  was  firmed  up  by  Pertamina  and  Nissho  Iwai  between  1972  and  1974.
				Japan  provided  a  yen  loan,   	and  five  users,   	seven  trading  companies,   	16  banks  and  one
		     	other  company  set  up  Japan-Indonesia  LNG  Co.   	(Jilco)   	as   	the  funnel  for  fi:~ancing.
		_	     	By  1975  construction  costs  had  swollen  from  1  billion  to  1.5  billion  yen  and  the
		     	problem  of  cost  overruns  arose,  but  additional  financing  was  found,  and  since  then
				construction  has  g~ne  as  it  should.    	LNG  production  began  in  Badak  in  July  1977  and
		-	     	in  Arul  in  August  1978,   	and  about  a  month  later  the  first  tankers  arrived  at  the
				Senboku  nr.   	2  plant  of  Osaka  Gas  and  Chubu  Electric's  Chita  base  respectively.    	Pro-
				duction  and  shipment  have  ~one  along  well;   	this  is  a  ma~or  import  source  which  pro-
		     	vided  over  half  of   	the  approximately  16  million  tons  of  LNG  Japan  imported  in  1980.
				Brunei  LNG
				Brunei  LNG  was  established  as  a  joint  venture  of  Shell,  Mitsubishi  Corp  and  the
				Brunei  government   	(with  shares  of  45%,   	45%,   	and  10%);   	it  liquefies  LNG  and  sells
				the  entire  volume  of  5.14  million  tons  to  three  Japanese  users  including  Tokyo
				Electric.    	The  ~oint  venture  contract  was  concluded  in  December  1969,  and  a  lique-
				faction  plant  from  America's  Air  Products  Co.   	(five  systems  of  1.05  million  tons
				per  year)  was  consCructed  with  engineering  by  Japan  Gasoline  and  America's  Procon.
				Operations  and  shipments  have  gone  smoothly  since  production  began  in  1973.				     	-
				This  was  Japan's  first  overseas  LNG  project.    	Because  construction  was  done  in  an
	 	~	     	earlier  period  the  construction  costs  were  reported  at  only  250  million  dollars.
				It  is  a  good  example  of  a  successful  pro~ect.
				Another  is  Abu  Dhabi's  Das   	Island,  where  Mitsui  &  Co.   	and  Bridgestone  liquid  Gas
				(total  share  24.5%)   	~oined  with  the  Abu  Dhabi  Government   	(51%),   	BP  and  CFP.    	This
				project  produces  2.05  million  tons  of  LNG  per  year,   	all  of  which  is  to  be  sold  to
				Tokyo  Electric  Co.   	for  18  years.    	The  first  ship  arrived  in  May  1977.
				In  addition,  Mitsubishi  Corp.   	has  joined  with  Shell  and  the  Malaysia  Petroleum
				Corp.   	in  an  LNG  production  plan  in  Bintula,   	Sarawak.    	An  annual  million  tons  of  LNG
				will  be  sold  to  Tokyo  Electric  and  one  other  company  for  20  years  beginning  in
	 	_	     	1983.    	Construction  of   	three  liquefaction  plants   	[will  have  three  systems]--each
				with  a  2  million  ton  capacity--  is  now  underway  with  Japan  Gasoline  Co.   	and  Kellogg		     	~
				as  general  contractors.    	The  Japanese  users  are  negotiating  for  increases  of  3.2
				million  tons  of  Indonesian  LNG  from  Badak  and  3  million  tons  from  Arul.    	And  there
				is  a  western  Australia  continental  shelf  project  in  which  plans  are  being  worked
				out   	to  supply  gas   	to  Australia  and  6  million  tons  of  LNG  per  year  to  Japan.
				Uranium
				Japan  now  has  21  atomic  power  plants  with  an  output  of  about  15  million  kilowatts.
				Seven  plants  now  under  construction  will  have  a  capacity  of  5.8  million  kilowatts.

				   	with  France   	(COGEMA,   	34%),   	Ni ger   	(31%)  and  Spain   	(10%).    	Over  a  period  of  19  years
				    	Japan  will  take  back  13,000   	tons  of  uranium  concentrate   	(enough  to  keep   	i0  light
				   	water  reactors  of  a  million  kilowatts  operating  for  10  years).    	The  Akouta  mines
				    	are  loc:ated  in  the  S~:hara  des ert  100  km  from  Niamey.    	CO~~MA,   	the  operator,   	extracts
				   	a  very  high-grade  ore  averaging  0.48  percent  from  the  mine  pits.    	The  ore  is  pro-
				    	cessed  to  a  concentrate   	(yellowcake)  by  the  sulfate  mixture  method;  the  concentrate
				    	is  transported  1500  km  by  road  and  500  km  by  rail,   	then  loaded  onto  ships  at
				   	Cotonou,   	Benin.

				     	In  the  next  10  years,  however,   	chip  imports  will  decline.    	i:nsuring  a  supply  of  raw

			   	Through  its  U.S.   	suhsid~ary,  Alaska  Pulp  has  acquired  timber  rights  in  Tongass
			   	National  Forest;   	it  produces  dissolved  pulp   	(DP)   	for  synthetic  textile  and  lumber
			   	products  and  buys  chips  from  other  companies,   	of  which  the  major  portion  is  sold  to
			    	Japan.    	The  Sitka  plant,  which  provides  dissolved  pulp  for  rayon,  has  been  in  full
			   	operation  since  December  1959.    	In  1962  its  capa~ity  was  increased  to  180,000  tons		     	-
			    	per  year,  but  because  Japanese  synthetic  textile  manufacturers  switched  to  polyester
			   	production,demand  for  rayon  pulp  has  been  slow  and  prices  have  been  depressed.    	In
			    	1967  lumber  capacity  was  expanded  by  purchasing  the  AWP  plant   	(65  million  broad-
			    	feet--1  bd-ft  is  a  board  one  foot  square  and  one  inch  thick)   	to  add  to  the  plant   	[on]
			    	at  Wrangel   	(100  million  board-feet).    	In  addition,  chips  were  purchased  from  the
	    	-	     	U.S.  and  sold  to  Japanese  users.    	Cooperation  in  this,   	the  fi~st  large-scale  postwar
			    	overseas  pro~ect,  was  sought  from  all  quarters  and  in  February  1956  the  cabinet
			    	approved  efforts  tu  promote  it.    	The  prim~ry  stockhalders  in  Alaska  Pulp  are  17
			    	banks  and  29  textile,   	trading  and  other  companies.
	    	-			In  other  projects,  Japan  obtains  chips  of  tropical  woods  from  Malaysia  and  elsewhere
			    	in  Asia  and  Oceanis;   	the  largest  of  these  is  the  Harris-Daishowa  project   	(New  South
			    	Wales,   	Australia).    	This  pro3ect  was  originally  a  joint  venture  with  local  capital,
			    	but  now  it  is  completely  owned  by  Japanese  firms.    	It  produces  eucalyptus  chips
	    	-			and  buys  waste  chips  from  other  sources,   	s~lling  its   	total  output  to  Japan.    	Between
			    	1965  and  1975s   	several  overseas  pulp-related  projeets  were  organized  as  joint

			    	New  Zealand'~  North  Island  sends  its   	full  production  of  about  200,000  tons  of  pulp
			    	each  year  to  Japan.    	There  are  also  pro~ects  for  overseas  production  of  finished
			    	products:    	Jujo  Paper  Co  joined  with  Weyerhaea~ser  in  the  Norpac  newsprint  project
	    	-			in  the  U.S.   	(200,000  tons  per  year  and  is  now  being  expanded),  and  Oji  Paper  Co

			    	plant  is  in  progress).
			    	Iron  and  Steel  Raw  Material
			    	In  the  past,   	raw  materials  for  iron  and  steel  making  were  secured  mostly  in  the
			    	form  of  imports  through  trading  companies.    	In  the  mid-1960s,  however,   	greater

				  	For   	7  years  since  crude  steel  production  peaked  in  1973,   	the  level  of  production  has	    	_
				  	stayed  around  100  to  11U  million  tons.    	There  has  thus  been  little  enthusiasm  for
				  	taking  part  in  new  pro~ects  during  this  period,   	but  now  crude  steel  production  is
				  	expected   	to  increase,   	and  new  projects  may  now  be  undertaken.
				  	Robe  River  Iron  Mines   	(Western  Australia)
	   	=		    	A  Japanese-U.S.-Australian  consortium  (unincorporated  joint  venture)  has  carried  on
				  	open  pit  mining  of  the  Robe  River  and  East  Deepdale  iron  ore  deposits;   	the  ore  is
				  	crushed  at  the  port  160  km  distant  and  part  is  pelletized  and  sold  to  Japan  (9
				  	million  tons  in  1979).    	In  1977  production  was  expanded  to  ZO  million  tons.    	Both
	   	_		     	Nippon  Steel  Corp.   	and  Sumitomo  Metal  Mining  Co.   	joined  Mitsui  &  Co.   	as  consortium
	   	-		    	members  by  acquiring  part  of  f~ustralia's  holdings.    	The  share  of  the  Japanese
				  	partners   	totals  35  percent,  but  operation  of  the  project  is  left  in  the  hands  of
				  	the  American  partners.
				  	In  1979  Japan's  iron  ore  imports  totaled  125  million  tons,   	of  which  over  40  percent
				  	came  from  Australia.    	The  lar.gest  source  is   	the  Ha~ersley  Mine   	(18  million  tons
				  	imported);   	Japanese  trading  and   	steel  companies  have  6.2  percent  of  the  stock  in
				  	its  holding  company.    	In  second  place  is  the  Mount  Newman  Mine   	(16  million  tons);
	   	-		     	Japanese   	tradin~  compar.ies  hold  10  percent  of  the  consortium.    	Japanese  and  U.S.
				  	companies  have  the  Savage  River  Mine  on  Tasmania  which  has  been  producing  pellets
				  	since  1967.
				  	Bowen  Coal   	(Queensland,  Australia)
				  	In  1966,   	Mitsubishi  Corp.   	formed  a  consortium  with  Utah  Develo~ment,   	a  U.S.   	compar.}~.
	   	-		     	Since  1971,   	they  have  successively  developed  the  Goonyella,   	Peekdowns  and  Salagee
				  	Mines  in  the  Bowen  coalfield.     	These  are  all  open  pit  mines,   	and  the  coal  is  shipped
	   	-		     	mostly  to  Japan  from  Hay  Point,   	200  km  distant.    	At  present  Japan's  take  of  Bowen
	   	-		     	coal  is  9.7  million  tons,  about  15  percent  of  tne  total.    	Mitsubishi  Corp.   	control-
				  	led  15  percent  of   	the  consortium  at  the  time  of  development,   	but  its  holdings  have
				  	dropped  to  12  percent  with  the  participation  of  other  partners.								-
				  	In  Brazil,   	Jananese  blast  furnace  operators  and  zrading  companies  have  a  20  percent
				  	share  in  development  of  the  Agunas  Cuteras  iron  mine  at  Belo  Harizonte  in  Minas
				  	Gerais.    	The  mine  began  producing  ore  in  November  1973.    	Kawasaki  Steel  Corp.   	is
				  	participating  in  the  development  of  the  Capanema  Mines.    	Production  will  begin  in
				  	1982.    	Capanema  iron  ore  will  be  supplied  to  Rio  Boce,  Kawasaki's  partner,   	and  to
	   	_		     	the  sintering  plant  wnich  Kawasaki  Steel  and  Tubarao  iron  mill   	(described  later)
				  	operate  on  Mindanao  in  the  Philippines.
				  	To  secure  coal  from  the  U.S.,   	which  has  the  highest  quality  unprocessed  coal,
				  	financing  and  purchases  began  around  1970  for  development  imports  ~f  Virginia  Poca-	     	=

				  	As  early  as  the  1950s  Japan  sought  to  secure  copper  ore  overseas  to  cover  domestic
				  	shortages  by  investment-purchases,   	primarily  in  the  Philippines  but  also  in  Canada		 	"
				  	and  Latin  America.    	In  the  latter  half  of  the  1960s   	the  scale  of  mine  development
				  	began  to  increase,   	and  there  were  more   	[and  larger]   	instances  of  icrvestment-purchases,

				 	Pro~ects  for  coal  for  general  use  are  in  progress  primarily  in  Australia:    	New
				 	South  Wales  coal   	(Lithgow,   	Barsrock,  Workworth,  Drayton),   	Queensland  coal   	(Bracewell)
	  	,		     	etc.    	Preparations  for  coal  extraction  are  already  being  made  at  some  projects,  but
	  	-		     	the  ,~,ro~ect   	structure  and  f inancing  for  most  of  the  large  projects  is  still  being
				 	formulated.
				 	The  above  projects  are  those  financed  by  Japan.    	To  conclude,   	here  are  three
	  	-		     	representative  examples  of   	large-scale  plant  exports:
				 	Algerian  gas  processing  plant:    	This  is  a  300  billion  yen  plant  exported  to  SONOTRAC
	  	-		     	by  the  Japan  Gasoline  Co.   	and  C.   	Itoh  &  Co.    	It  is  a  large-scale  plant  constructed
				 	in  the  northern  Sahara.

	  	_		     	year)   	constructed  in  the  Baoshan  area  of  Shanghai.    	Engineering  was  undertaken  by
				 	Nippon  Steel  Corp.,   	and  exports  of  about  370  billion  yen  are  projected  for  the  first
				 	phase  (3  million  tons  per  year).
	  	_		     	Hong  Kong  Subway  Construction:    	The  subway  is  to  connect  Kowloon  and  Hong  Kong.    	The
				 	civil  engineering  for  the  first  phase  is  a  large-scale  project  of  about  230  billion
				 	yen.    	Japanese  construction  companies  are  responsible  for  nine  areas  of  construction
				 	costing  60  billion  yen.    	Deferred  payment  Export-Import  Bank  financing  has  been

		    	to  Produce  40,000  B/D  in  1984"]
		     	[Text]    	The  Japan  ~il  Development  Co.   	(JODCO,   	headed  by  Takeki  Tanaka)   	and  the  Abu
		    	Dhabi  National  Oil  Co.   	(ADNOC)  have  be~un  a  joint  exploitation  of   	the  Sateh  oil
		     	field,  which  is  part  of  the  Abu  Dhabi  Marine  Area   	(ADMA)   	drilling  concessions.
		    	AlthouRh  Japan's  overseas  oil  development  ventures  usually  take  the  form  of  parti-
		     	cipation  through  investment,   	in  this  venture,   	JODCO  is  the  operator.    	The  Japanese
		     	oil   	development  industry  has  long  wished  to  be  operators,   	and  much  is  expected
		     	from  this  project.    	Oil  production  is  projected  to  be  40,000  B/D  by  the  end  of  1984.
		     	JODC~  and  ADNOC  reached  agreement  on  the  Sateh  oil  field  development  project  last
		     	summer.    	The  nrojer_t  includes  the  development  of   	(Jarnayn),   	Dalma',   	and  Sateh  fields.
		     	The  existence  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  has  been  proven  by  two  experimental
		     	drillings  made  by  ADMA  OPUCO.    	ADMA  OPUCO  is  a  consortium  of  JODCO,   	British
		     	Petroleum  (BP),   	Companie  Francaise  des  Petroles   	(CFP)   	and  ADNOC.
		     	Sateh  crude  has  an  API  of  31   	(American  Petroleum  Institute  Scale)   	and  contains
		     	0.7  percent  stilfur.    	The  estir~ated  oil  reserve  in  Sateh  amounts  to  800  million  B.
	 	_	    	The  project  wil~.  hegin  with  three  drillings  at  the  Sateh  oil  field.    	About  $30
		     	million  will  be  invested.    	Japan's  share  will  be  40  percent  of  expenses.    	Drilling
		     	of  Dalma'   	and   	(Jarnayn)  will  begin  if  Sateh  drilling  is  successful.    	The  JODCO's
		     	take  from  these  oil  fields  will  be  40  percent  of  production,   	and  ADNOC's  take  will
		     	be  60  percent.
	 	=	    	The  ADPtA  drilling  concessions  were  o~tained  in  1972.    	Drilling  interests  are
		     	distributed  as  follows:    	JODCO  12  percent,   	BP  14.7  percent,   	C~'P  13.3  percent  and
		     	ADNOC  60  percent.    	JODCO  has  since  participated  in  the  development  of  Umm  Shaif,
				lower  Zakum,   	upper  7,akum  and  iJmm  al-Dalkh  oil  fields.    	JODCO  is  the  operator  o�  the
				Umm  al-Dalkh  oil  field  development  project.    	Between  1972  and  1980  it  has  drilled
				19  wells.    	Production  of  oil  will  begin  by  the  end  of  1982.    	Thus,   	JODCO  will  be
				the  operator  of  two  oil   	fields  in  ADMA,   	at  Umn  al-Dalkh  and  Sateh.
				In  addition  to  these  development  pro3ects,   	Japan's  Abu  Dhabi  Oil  Co.   	and  Godo  Oil
				Development  Co.   	are  also  promoti  nt  level

			    	4.    	Radiative  Process
			    	As  indicated  by   	(3.1),   	there  are  few  effective  restricted  levels  at  n<  nt,
			    	and    	radiation  is  discharged  mainly  by  radiative  rebonding  and  bremsstrahlung~
			    	The  respective  rPaction  rates   	for  these  processes  are  given  in  the  following
			    	manner.

			    	As  a  result,   	the  time  required  for  radiative  discharge  is  the  fallowing
						 	tr  -(a  +Rb)N    	ti  2  x  10-~  T1~2/N21   	z2  s.						 	(4.3)
									0
			    	In  this  manner,   	the  radiation  time  is  very  much  longer  compared  to  heating
			     	time,   	and  the  entropy  generation  due  to  radiation  associated  with  initial
	  	_		  	compression  is  small.
			     	Even  whQn  a  weak  radiation  is  emitted,   	there  is  need   	to  consider  transport  of
			     	this  radiation  before  it  can  have  any  effect  on  external  items.    	The  Thomson
			     	scattering  is  effective  in  the  transport  of  high  energy  x-ray.    	The  optical
			     	depth  in  plasma  of  thickness  k  cm  with  respec.*_  to  this  phenomenon  is  the
	   	-		  	following
						  	Tes     	~Th  NQ  ti  6.0  x  10-4  N21   	Q.								 	(4.4)
			     	In  this  manner,   	there  are  many  instances  when  optically  thin  situations  are
			     	encountered  at  high  energies,  and  i~  may  be  thought  that  radiation  exits
	  	~		  	directly.    	When  heavy  elements  retain  the  orbital  electrons,   	the  photoelec-
			     	tric  effect   	takes  hold.    	When  an  element  of  atomic  number  Z  retains  a  single  K
			     	electron,   	the  pliotoe?ectric  absorption  cross   	section  of  x-rays  with  higher
			     	energy  than  the  K  absorption  edge  IZ  is  the  following
						  	6k(z,   	hv)  ti  6.3  x  10-18  Z-2   	~hv~7/2   	~1+  6(I-�  -  1)~   	~m^2�			~4.5)

			     	The  optical  depth  is  greatly  dependent  on  the  energy  and  the  degree  of  ioniza-
					tion.    	When  ionization  is  by  way  of  photoionization,   	radiation  goes  deeper,
			     	and  the  prc~pagation  rate  is  dependent  on  the  rate  of  generation  of  radiation
			     	and  is  of  the  order  of  R,/T  tr.

	    	~			   	spectrum  approaches  a  Rayleigh-Jean,s  spectrum,
					  	The  above  discussion  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  manner.    	Plasma  of
					  	NQ  ti  1021cm'2  is  optically  very  thin  except  for  near  the  K  absorption  edge  and
					  	the  visible  region.    	About  half  the  radiation  generated  at  the  surface  of  the
					  	target  solid  is  radiated  from  the  surface  while  the  remainder  is  absorbed  into
					  	the  target  solid  body.    	The  a.attez  is  converted  to  radiation  similar  to  black
					  	body  radiation,   	but  the  black  body  temperature  is  lower  than  the  electron
					  	temperature  so  that  a  soft  x-ray  or  ultraviolet  radiation  is  the  result.
					  	When  low~  temperature  black  body  radiation  and  high  temperature  electrons  inter-�
					  	act,   	Compton  heating  occurs.    	The  heating  rate  depends  on
	    	-						 	y  =  Tes   	(kT/mc2)												 	(4.9)
					  	y�  under  the  present  experimental  conditions.
					  	The  effect  of  the  magnetic   	field  was  disregarded  in  this  discussion,  but  cyclo-
	    	-			    	tone   	[phonetic]   	radiation  appears  in  tt~e  radio  region  of  laser  plasma.
					  	Should  a  strong  radiation  be  generated  in  the  long  wavelength  region,   	it  is
					  	transported  outside  as  a  light  bubble.    	These  interesting  phenomena  have  no
					  	direct  relationships  with  atomic  processes  but  should  not  be  disregarded  when
					  	the  entire  phenomenolot~ical  effects  are  considered.

				 	by  generation  of  radiation  as  a  result  of  which  the  plasma  is  continually  ioniz-

			   	Tokyo  SHL'KAN  SHINCHO  in  Japanese  1  Jan  81  p  25
			   	[Text]    	The  magnetic  lift  type  linear  motor  car,  being  developed  by  National  Railways
			   	Corporation  as  an  innovative  hypersonic   	train  of  the  new  post  super-express   	train  era,
			  	~as  at  last  entered  into  the  unmanned  running  test  stage  using  test  cars  with  enough
			  	space  for  people.    	The  test  cars  have  finally  started  "lifted  runs"  at  the  experimen-
			   	tal  center  in  Mlmitsu,  Hyuga,  Miyazaki  prefecture  since  December  16th.
			   	On  the  16th,  Car  MLU  001,  weighing  approximately  10  tons,   	recorded  240km/h  for  26
			  	seconds.    	-----JNR  mainta~.ns  that  the  tests  would  be  repeated  some  more,   	and,
			   	"Practicalization  target  date  is  set  for  the  decade  starting  from  1985,   	and  a  speed
			   	of  500  km/h  will  be  realized."
			   	On  the  other  hand,   	Japan  Air  Lines  is  also  developing  a  similar  linear  motor  type
			   	"lifted  transport"   	(note:    	JAL  calls  it  a"transport").    	This  one  is  envisioned  to
			   	serve  as  hypersonic  transport  which  runs  at  about  300  km/h  between  the  center  of  a
			   	city  and  a  suburban  air  port,   	for  example,   	Tokyo-Narita  airport  and  Sapporo-Chitose
			   	airport.    	According  to  the  blueprint,   	it  is  designed  to  run  a  distance  of  70km  from
			   	Tokyo  to  Narita  in  15  minutes  and  45km  from  Sappori  to  Chitose  in  9  minutes.    	Up  to
	  	_		 	the  present  time,   	however,   	an  unmanned  transport  recorded  a  speed  of  380km/h  and
	 	_		 	100km/h  with  men  aboard.
			  	As  already  reported  in  newspapers  and  magazines,   	the  Ministry  of  Transportation  has
	 	=		 	expressed  "objection"  to  this  project.    	This  is  accountable  for  slimmed  government
			  	budget  and  the  difficulty  in  setting  up  a  separate  company.    	"Abortion  of  Developmen~"
			  	was  at  one  time  considered  even  among  the  insiders.    	Nonetheless,   	JAL  continues  to
			   	develop  it,   	aiming,   	for  the  time  being,   	to  demonstrate  the  transport  at  the  Science
			   	and  Technology  Fair  to  be  held  at  Tsukuba  science  and  academical  community  5  years
	  	'		 	later.
			   	Well,   	is  it  really  necessary  to  have  these  hypersonic  cars?    	If  so,  why  waste  money
			   	and  efforts  by  permitting  both  JNR  and  JAL  to  develop  bilaterally  pxactically  the  same
	  	-		 	object?    	How  about  the  technological  and  environmental  problems   	that  lay  on  top  of
			   	those  moral  questions2
			   	First  of  all,   	commenting  on  500  km/h  surface  transportation,   	man's  endless  desire  for
			   	"faster  speed"  should  be  admitted,  which  inevitably  created  super-express  railways  and

				    	endorsed  the  flight  of  jet  passenger  liners.    	Now,  if  the  linear  car  is  really  "fas~er,
	    	-				cheaper,   	s afer,  pollution  free,   	noise-free  and  useful  for  energy  saving  practice,"
				    	isn't  it  much  better  than  the  jet  planes   	that  gozzle  enormous  amounts  of  oil  or   	the
	    	=				auper-express  trains   	that  unabashedly  emit  noise  and  vibration?
	     	.		     	Next,  what   	about  the  technological  aspect  of  the  car?    	The  lift  type  linear  motor
				    	car  "can  make  the  500  km/h  mark  without  sErious   	difficulties,"  since  nothing  but  air
				    	resists  its  movement  because  it  does  not  have  wheels,    	In  fact,   	JNR  achieved  the
				    	SOU km/h mark  although  the  test  run  was  operated  using  only  one  car  without  men  aboard.
	    	_				However,   	many  unsolved  problems  still  remain  before  it  can  be  actually  used,   	for  in-
				    	stance,   	running  on  curves,   	pressure  in  tunnels  and  cross-wind  stability.    	To  cope  with
				    	these  prob lems,   	they  say,   	"We  will  comgletely  remodel  the  present  test  course  for  a
				    	new  model   	car   	(U-shap~ed)   	and  conduct  the  tests  using  a  train  of  cars  and  manned  cars."
	    	_				Yet,   	the  road  to  the  practicalization  is  still  far  away.    	When  all  thQSe  problems
				    	are  resolved,   	the  hardest  obstacle  of  securing  land  for  use  is  awaiting.
	    	_				How  about   	the  Linear  car  of  JAL   	(HSST)?    	This  one,  different  from  the  so-called
				    	JNR's   	"repulsion  lift  type"   	(note:  applying  the  principle  of  N  to  N  and  S  to  S  re-
				    	pulsion  in  magnets,   	the  body  of  the  car  is  repulsed  from  the  guideway  and  lifted),
	    	-				is  called   	"absorption  lift  type."    	The  magnets  on  the  edges  of  the  car  body,  which
				    	is  curved  as  if  to  embrace  the  guideway  from  both  sides,  are  drawn  into   	the  back  side	  	r
				    	of  the  guideway,  but   	the  secret  of  this  car  is   	that  the  car,   	at   	this  time,  will  not
				    	stick  fas t   	to  the  guideway  but  "be  lifted  in  space  by  magnets."    	It  will  run  lifted,
				    	maintaining  clearance  of  approximately  1  cm.											    	=
	   	~				The  technical  team  of  the  JAL  contends,   	"All  problems  are  solved,"  and  they  assure
				    	that  "600  km/h  is  also  OK."    	"It's  no  big  deal,  we  can  install  tracks  along  the

		    	According  to  the  performance  calculation  compiled  so  far  by  the  promotion  council,
		     	construction  expenses  for  the  basic  part  of  the  track,   	such  as  tunnels  and  bridges,
		    	will  amount  to  the  same  as   	the  super-express  railways,  but  the  tutal  const:ruction			  	_
		    	expenses  will  be  about  6  billion  yen/km  at  the  current  price,   	an  appro~cimate  20
		    	percent  increase  cou~pared  to  the  super-express  rail.ways  because  the  propulsion  guide
		     	coil~   	(magnets)  caill  be  installed  in  line  formation  instead  of  using  rails  even  if
     	-			the  coil  is  assumed  mass-producable.    	The  cost  o�  construction  work  between  Tokyo  and
		     	Osaka  is  estimated  to  be  on  the  scale  of  approximately  3  trillion  yen.    	However,   	due
		     	to  the  absence  of  rails,  wheels,  wiring  and  pantographs,   	the  increase  of  the  con-
		     	struction  work  expenses  will  be  balanced  oi~t  by  the  decrease  of  the  operational  ex-
		     	penses.    	All  in  all,   	the  linear  cars  can  be  managed  by  expending  just  about  as  much		     	-
		     	as  appropriated  for  the  super-express  railways.
		     	Additionally,   	on  the  matter  of  energy  consumption,   	the  "superconductive  magnets"			   	~
		     	installed  in  the  body  of  the  car  serve  as  an  "energy  saving  power"  which  does  not			  	-
		     	require  a  supply  of  electricity  in  its  service  life  once  the  electricity  is  initially
		     	charged  after  it  is  cooled  close  to  absolute  zero   	(minus  273�C)   	in  a  freezer  and  its		   	-
		     	electric  resistance  is  reduced  to   	zero.    	Nonetheless,   	the  electricity  must  be  con-				_
		     	stantly  supplied  to  the  coils  on  the  ground,   	and  the  el2ctric  consumption  shoots  up
		     	with  the  acceleration  of  speed.    	With  a  speed  two  times  faster  than  the  super-express
		     	railways,   	the  energy  consumption  is  estimated  to  become  about  3-fold.    	Also,   	in  this
		     	case,   	if  the  linear  car  is  operated  at  a  conservati~e  speed  of  around  300 km/h,   	the				-
		     	energy  expenses  will  be  balanced  out  fairly  well  by  the  reduction  of  the  maintenance
		     	expenses.
     	-			On  the  other  hand,   	if  this  linear  car  line  is  opened  and  operated  at300   	km/h,   	the				_
     	�			distance  between  Tokyo  and  Osaka  will  be  only  90-100  minutes.    	Adding  to  the  passen-
		     	gers  of  the  super-express   	train  "hikari,"  which  currently  amounts  to  little  less   	than		 	_
     	_			35  million  people  a  year,   	many  of   	the  air  line  passengers,   	over  3  million  people  a
		     	year,  will  be  expected  *.o  switch  over  to  the  linear  line.    	The  promotion  council
		     	predicts  an  annual  passenger  demand  of  about  40  million  people.    	To  cope  with  this
		     	passenger  increase,   	the  capacity  of  the  linear  car,   	they  say,   	shall  be  slightly  under
		     	100  people/car  and   	the  train  shall  be  composed  of  several  cars.
		     	The  JNR's  linear  car  development  project  has  been  undertalcen  at  the  JNR  Nliyazaki
		     	Lift  Type  Railway  Experiment  Center  in  Hyuga,  Miyazaki  prefecture.    	Since  the  4km			 	_
		     	utility  type  U-shaped  running   	track  was  completed  at  the  end  of  last  year,   	they  have
				started  to  lift  test  run  using  a  new  model  "MLU  001"  test  car  with  passenger  space.
				It  is  projected  that  a  7  km  running  track  will  be  made  within  fiscal  1981  to  conduct
		=			manned  tests.    	In  fiscal  1982,   	a  3-car   	txain  will  be   	tested.    	Finally,   	in  fiscal  1983
				and  thereafter,   	they  will  speed  up  for  the  establishment  of  undeveloped  technologies
				such  at  test  runs  on  sections  with  sloges,   	sections  under  tunnels  and  sections  be-
				tween  points.
				Takagi,   	the  president  of   	the  JNR,   	announced  ambitiously  at  the  Diet:    	"Hope  for			    	~

				we  shall  devote  ourselves  more  intensely  and  continue  the  tests.    	We  may  yet  need
				another  decade  before  we  can  achieve  our  goal,  but  we  would  also  like  to  study  con-
