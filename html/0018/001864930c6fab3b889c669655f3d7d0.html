 POLICY ISSUES IN TI-1113 PURGE' OP LIN PIAO
 This study finds that the principal -- and still
 unresolved -- issue behind the momentous purge of Lin
 Piao and associates, has been the issue of civilian
 versus military control over China's political system.
 Although dramatic, differences over foreign policy -- for
 example, whether China should seek improved relations
 with the US and/or the USSR -- have apparently not been
 central to the purge.   Certain differences do seem to
 have been present concerning the style and pacing of
 domestic policies; but, by and large, back of the
 political-military struggle for power, questions of
 policy have been weapons used to attack and undermine
 domestic adversaries, rather than matters of substantive
 difference.
 In preparing the study this Staff has benefited
 from the comments and contributions of a number of other
 offices of the Central Intelligence Agency.   Because of
 the still incomplete nature of available data, however,
 the study's views represent the judgments essentially
 of this Staff and of its author.   Further comments will
 be welcome, and should be addressed to the study's
 author                     of this Staff.

 POLICY ISSUES IN THE PURGE OF LIN PIAO
 Summary
 In very broad and somewhat simplified terms, the
 origin of the purge of Lin Piao's "conspiratorial clique"
 is believed to be the same as the origin of the Cultural
 Revolution -- Mao Tse-tung's conviction that he would
 have to remove his designated successor as the leader
 of a "disloyal opposition" in order to regain control
 over the political apparatus in China.  Demonstrating
 the difficulty of delegating power within China's poli-
 tical system, the Cultural Revolution and the Lin Piao
 affair have been in essence struggles for control of
 the political apparatus between Plao and his designated
 successors.   Within this larger context of a struggle
 for power, policy issues become primarily weapons for
 use in, rather than the causes der se of, such struggle.
 The supreme irony of the Cultural Revolution,
 undertaken in order to enable ilao Tse-tung to regain
 control over a "bureaucratic" Party apparatus,  is that
 it ended with the creation of a new Army-dominated ap-
 paratus even less responsive to Mao's direction and con-
 trol.                            In a very real sense, the growing disagreement
 over the respective roles of civilian and military
 authority in the period from 1967 to 1971 reflected
 mounting friction over the roles of Mao and Lin in the
 new structure of power.   When Mao first suspected and
 then became convinced that Lin was opposing his efforts
 to re-establish civilian Party control, the issue of
 civilian versus military control became the central
 issue in a protracted political struggle which would
 lead in time to the fall of Lin Piao.

 Although personal attitudes and impressions are
 hard to document, the record does seem to indicate
 clearly Mao's growing disillusionment with the performance
 of Lin Piao and the military apparatus over a period
 of time dating back to the spring of 1969, when Mao
 issued the first of many warnings to Army representatives
 serving in the new Revolutionary Committee structure
 to correct their defective work-style   in these early
 warnings, Mao characterized this work-style as "arrogant
 and complacent" and "crude and careless," defects which
 he charged had led the PLA-dominated apparatus to commit
 "mistakes" in the implementation of regime policies.
 Mao's growing distrust of his chosen successor
 was manifested dramatically in March 1970 when Mao
 decided to remove the post of Chairman of the State
 from the new draft Chinese People's Republic Constitu-
 tion.                             Lin apparently interpreted this decision, which
 confirmed Chou En-lai as the de facto head of the govern-
 ment, as in effect disinheriting  imas t1.o successor.
 This helps to explain why Lin Piao (who saw Mao with-
 drawing his right to the succession), Chen Po-ta (who
 was vulnerable, at a time when the policy line was shift-
 ing to the Right, as the exemplar of "ultra-leftism")
 and four top-ranking military leaders  (who viewed Mao's
 escalating pressure on the military apparatus as a threat
 to themselves) banded together "to prepare and launch
 a surprise attack" -- as the Party documents explaining
 the Lin affair now assert -- at the Second Plenum at
 Lushan in August 1970,
 Since it was apparent that Lin was challenging
 him as the head of a powerful military organization,
 Mao was compelled to be cautious and circumspect in
 takin    action a ainst him.

 conspiracy would have aroused opposition from military

 leaders and might have resulted in civil war.   Instead,
 Mao at the Second Plenum intensified the continuing pres-
 sure on Lin's military apparatus by initiating a "criticize
 revisionism and rectify work-style" campaign which would
 dominate China's political life throughout the following
 year.
 Since the road to power in the Cultural Revolu-
 tion of both Lin Piao and the PLA had been one of "giving
 prominence to politics,' the central charge in this
 campaign -- that an overemphasis on politics had resulted
 in "Lefti:st deviationism" in the implementation of Piao's
 policy line -- served to undercut one of the most important
 justifications for Lin's and the PLA's continued right
 to rule.  The generally negative response of military
 authorities throughout China to this rectification campaign
 indicated, moreover, that they were quite aware that it
 threatened their continued domination of the political
 structure.   The struggle between Mao and Lin for control
 of the political-military apparatus had reached an impasse,
 soon to explode in the bizarre sequence of events beginning
 with an abortive Lin-sponsored attempt to assassinate
 Mao and culminating in Lin's fiery death in a plane
 crash in Mongolia.
 If it is true that Plao even before the Ninth Party
 Congress suspected Lin of opposing Party leadership over
 the Army, there is reason to believe that Plao sensed this
 opposition first in a disagreement over the scale of the
 purge within the Party.   This was a disagreement not only
 over the extent to which the old Party was to be purged
 but also, as a corollary, over the criteria to be used
 in selecting new Party cadres.  The implications of the
 shift following the Ninth Party Congress -- to emphasize
 professional qualifications rather than revolutionary
 criteria in the selection of new Party leaders -- were
 clear.   Many of these were to be old Party cadres who,

 having been properly educated and "transformed," were
 to be "liberated" and returned to positions of authority.
 Sensing a threat to their continued exercise of political
 power, both radical ideologues and military leaders had
 reason to join forces to carry out what is now called an
 "ultra-leftist" cadre policy characterized either by whole-
 sale purging of old Party cadres or "failing to liberate
 cadres on time."
 The mechanism for carrying out this "ultra-leftist"
 cadre policy was the May 7 Cadres School, an institution
 to which old Party cadres were sent for a refresher course
 in the study of Mao Thought -- as well as hard physical
 labor -- and where through faithful performance of these
 duties they could demonstrate anew their loyalty to Chair-
 man Mao and I?iao's revolutionary line.   The flaw in this
 arrangement was that these schools were run by the PLA,
 with military leaders empowered to decide whether the old
 cadres had passed the test of political loyalty.   The
 charge that the radical ~rleologues of the Cultural Revolu-
 tion Group and officers of the PLA abused this authority
 to prevent the rehabilitation of veteran Party cadres and
 thus perpetuate their own power is both credible and
 supported by developments at the time.
 A highly dramatic and visible issue, the role of
 foreign policy in domestic political conflict in general
 and in the Lin Piao affair in particular, must be approached
 with great care.   There is a strong temptation, for example,
 to define a  rpiori the foreign policy issue in the Lin
 Piao affair in terms of a dispute concerning the triangular
 relationship between China, the Soviet Union and the United
 States, with one group favoring a rapprochement with the
 Soviet Union and the other with the United States.   In
 fact, it appears that Mao, Lin, Chou and the top PLA leaders
 were all agreed that the Soviet Union constituted the gravest
 military threat to China and that policy differences vis-
 a-vis the USSR were confined to questions of degree and
 emphasis.

 The dispute concerned not so much which of the two
 great powers, Russia or America, China should conciliate,
 but whether China should switch from the isolationist and
 confrontationist foreign policy posture of the Cultural
 Revolution to a more flexible and pragmatic approach.
 Lin  Piao is clearly on record as one of the principal
 art-hitects of what might be called the "revolutionary
 model" of foreign policy which dominated China's foreign
 relations during the Cultural Revolution.   Since Chou
 En-lai personified the post-Cultural Revolution turn toward
 what might be called a\"nationalist model" of foreign
 policy, the dispute over the issue of foreign policy in
 a real sense was a dispute between these two leaders,
 each striving to enlist support for his views.   The record
 shows, moreover, that Chairman Mao backed Chou throughout
 most of this struggle, providing decisive support in the
 final showdown debate when Lin stood up in a Central Com-
 mittee meeting to oppose the proposed visit of President
 Nixon to China.
 Lin based his opposition to President Nixon's visit
 not so much on considerations of power as of ideology,
 portraying negotiations with the United States as a betrayal
 of the Chinese and world revolutions.   It seems fairly
 clear, moreover, that although Lin used the Soviet Union
 as a counter in his argument against the Nixon visit, he
 did so more from a desire to score debating points or to
 strengthen his ideological argument than from any prior
 understanding with the Soviet leadership.  Just as Mao
 and Chou had earlier attacked policies with which Lin was
 directly associated as "ultra-leftist," Lin and his mili-
 tary supporters were now attacking the Piao-Chou policy
 of negotiations with the United States as "too rightist."
 With respect to economic policy, the central charge
 leveled against Lin Piao is that, whereas Liu Shoo-chi
 had committed the Rightist error in the early 1960's of
 overemphasizing production at the expense of politics,

 Lin and his colleagues were guilty of the "ultra-leftist"
 error of overemphasizing politics at the expense of pro-
 duction.   Although grossly exaggerated and distorted,
 there is an element of truth in this indictment of the
 military-dominated apparatus for having handled poorly
 the complicated task of rebuilding the economy following
 the disruption of the Cultural Revolution,   The end
 result of radical ideologues and military leaders together
 controlling the implementation of economic policy in the
 period following the Ninth Party Congress was an "ultra-
 leftist" tendency to go beyond Plao's policy guidelines,
 a tendency expressed first in setting unrealistic goals
 and then in resorting to coercion in an attempt to achieve
 these goals.
 Characterized as "Chairman Plao's new economic
 line," these guidelines were reminiscent of the economic
 strategy which had produced the Great Leap Forward, only
 this time presented in a more reasoned and moderate vein
 in an apparent effort to take account of earlier mistakes.
 A central feature of these guidelines was Mao's call for
 a sustained high rate of economic development to be achieved
 primarily by mobilizing China's huge underemployed labor
 force to carry out Leap Forwards in agriculture and medium-
 and-small-scale industry.   In this effort to undertake
 simultaneous Leap Forwards in both industry and agricul-
 ture -- the entire undertaking to rely heavily on political
 indoctrination and ideological incentives -- there was
 ample room for controversy in the allocation of blame when
 the effort began to founder in early 1970.
 Among the reasons for revising China's Fourth
 Five Year Plan at or shortly after the Second Plenum in
 August 1970, the basic reason was that the attempt to
 carry out a "practical" Leap Forward had failed.  Another
 reason for the change was the need to reverse the trend
 toward decentralization of economic and administrative
 power and to re-establish centralized control over the

 economy.   A third reason, revealed by Chou En-lai in dis-
 cussing a dispute within the leadership over "guns versus
 butter," was the difficulty which had been experiences?
 in attempting to shift the burden for the development of
 China's agriculture and local industry to the provincial
 level.
 In this debate over the age-old question of "guns
 versus butter" (which would be discussed in the press as
 the question of whether industry should be developed with
 "electronics" or "steel" at the center), there was a
 natural basis for alliance between the radical planner,
 and the military.   For to the extent that the ideological
 view of Chinese man (as willing to subordinate individual
 to collective or national goals) prevailed, there would
 be more funds available in the central budget for the
 development of advanced weapons and military industry.
 That such an alliance, whether tacit or overt, did in fact
 exist is suggested, moreover, by the content of the public
 discussion of this issue.
 Another policy issue was the undertaking following
 the Cultural Revolution to reform China's rural communes.
 This constituted an atte,upt to revive a number of the
 original features of China's commune system.   This time,
 however, these radical reforms were not to be imposed
 from above by administrative fiat, but rather were to be
 accepted "voluntari.ly" by a peasantry whose ideological
 consciousness had been raised as a result of the Cultural
 Revolution.
 The vehicle for the "voluntary" introduction of
 these reforms was a nation-wide campaign initiated in
 the fall of 1968 of learning from and emulating the model
 Tachai agricultural production brigade, a collective farm
 so advanced that it had eliminated private plots, merged
 production teams and instituted a system of income dis-
 tribu,ion combining both socialist and Communist features.

 Simply put, the problem facing the "leading comrades" at
 all levels in carrying out the "learn from Tachai" campaign
 was how to persuade China's peasants "voluntarily" to pro-
 duce more and consume less in order to accelerate economic
 development.
 That this campaign was based on a utopian view of
 human nature was demonstrated by reports of rising peasant
 discontent throughout 1969-1970.   Confronted with these
 reports and with a threatened decrease in production, the
 t-daoist leadership was compelled step by step to abandon
 these radical rural reforms, so that by the Second Plenum
 in August 1970 it had returned once again to the rural
 institutional system to which China had retreated in the
 early 1960's.   In explaining how this nation-wide "learn
 from Tachai" campaign (which clearly had the approval of
 Chairman Mao at the outset) had gone so badly awry, the
 basic charge against Chen Po-ta and Lin "iao concerning
 rural policy is not that they opposed Chairman Mao, as
 was the case in foreign policy, but rather that they
 encouraged -- with evil intent -- the "overzealous im-
 plementation" of Mao's rural policy guidelines.
 Although other policy issues appear now to be
 largely settled,  the central policy issue in the Lin
 Piao affair -- the issue of civilian versus military
 control over China's political system -- has yet to be
 resolved.
 /Mao and Chou are quite aware teat t e
 task of regaining control over an Army-dominated political
 apparatus is much more formidable than the earlier task
 undertaken in the Cultural Revolution of regaining con-
 trol over a Party-dominated apparatus.   Relying once again
 on a rectification-and-purge campaign to accomplish this
 difficult task, Mao informed regional military leaders
 more than a year ago (even before Lin's abortive coup
 attempt)  that the time had come for the PLA to give up
 the political role it had played during the Cultural.
 Revolution and concern itself with military affairs.

 The  amount  of progress achieved during the past
 year in returning political power to civilian Party
 leadership in Communist China is difficult to determine.
 Party documents indicate that more than 30 central and
 regional military leaders have been purged as members of
 Lin Piao's "conspiratorial clique," and many more military
 leaders are missing.  Nearly all of the key military region
 commands have, as Mao directed, made self-criticisms and
 expressed their determination hereafter "to respect, sup-
 port and observe" civilian Party leadership.   Several
 well-documented meetings of central and provincial leaders
 in Peking in recent months, together with the rehabilita-
 tion of a number of Party figures, also suggest that
 progress is being made in the civilianization of China's
 political structure.
 Until such time as the identity of those holding
 the top positions in the new Party and government apparatus
 is known, it would be prudent to reserve final judgment
 on the outcome of this effort to return China to civilian
 rule. It would also be prudent, however, to recognize
 that Mao Tse-tung has demonstrated repeatedly his ability
 in the face of great odds to rectify and purge, if not
 finally to control, the political apparatus in China.

 Mao Tse-tung said that his object

 had characterized it in 1949.   It was
 misleading to look for policy motives
 -- for instance, economic or foreign
 policy -- behind it.

 have to remove his designated "successor" as the leader
 of a "disloyal opposition" in order to regain "effective
 control" over the political apparatus in China.   As Liu
 Shac-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping were charged with corrupt-
 ing the Party and state apparatus with a form of Rightist
 "revisionism" in the early 1960's, so Lin Piao and Chen
 Po-ta are now charged with corrupting the post-Cultural
 Revolution apparatus with a form of Leftist "revisionism,"
 the end result in each case being the sabotage and failure
 of 1lao's "correct" policies.   As the latest and most
 striking example of a recurring phenomenon in the Chinese
 Communist political system, Lin and Chen are being used
 as scapegoats for the failure of Mao's Cultural Revolu-
 tion policies.
 Demonstrating the difficulty of delegating power
 within China's political system, the Cultural Revolution
 and the Lin Piao affair have been in essence struggles for
 control of the political apparatus between Mao and his
 designated successors.   To Mao, the fact that the apparatus
 is not responsive to his directives and policy guidelines
 is evidence that his successor is attempting to expand
 his power base by creating an "independent kingdom."
 To his designated successor, familiar with Mao's political
 work-style, the fact that Mao then launches a rectifica-
 tion campaign against his apparatus -- the Party in the
 case of Liu Shao-chi, the Army in the case of Lin Piao --
 is a clear sign that in time he too will have to under o
 this process of "rectification.
 It is in this context of mounting distrust and
 suspicion between Flao and his successor that the role of
 policy and policy issues in the Cultural Revolution and
 the purge of Lin Piao must be viewed.  Within this larger

 context of a struggle for power -- with Plao convinced
 that his successor is conspiring to take away more and
 more of his power, and his successor convinced that Mao
 is intent upon disgracing and purging him -- policy
 issues become primarily weapons for use in the struggle,
 rather than the causes, per se, of such struggle.   The
 struggle over policy issues, moreover, has not involved
 competing policies so much as charges of defective
 implementation of Maoist policies.   Whereas Liu Shao-
 chi was charged with sabotaging Mao's policies from the
 Right through willful obstructionism, Lin Piao and
 Chen Po-ta are now charged with sabotaging Mao's policies
 from the Left by carrying them to excess -- and with
 evil intent.
 In sum, policy issues in the Maoist political
 system are concerned basically with considerations of
 prestige and power.  To the victor in policy struggles
 (so far Mao) belongs the spoils of infallibility, to the
 vanquished the ignominy of political disgrace and almost
 certainly, in the case of Lin Piao, death.

 The Is:iue of Civilian Versus Military Control
 The Army... has now taken power in
 7,000 local units  [of government] ...   By
 and by we want to pull the Army back from
 its dominant position in the local units.
 But that can only be done after we have
 found new leaders.
 -- Lin Piao, Speech at Central Committee
 Work Conference, 30 March 1967.
 There is a certain uneasiness among
 some Party members about the power role
 inherited by the Army following the break-
 up of the Party bureaucracy during the
 Cultural Revolution...   .7s there not a
 tendency for high military officers to
 become overlords of the Party?  An 'army
 dictatorship' ?
 -- Edgar Snow, "The Army and the Party,"
 in The New Republic, 22 May 1971.
 The supreme irony of the Cultural Revolution, under-
 taken in order to enable Mao Tse-tung to regain "effective
 control" over a "bureaucratic" Party apparatus, is that
 it ended with the creation of a new Army-dominated ap-
 paratus even less responsive to Mao's direction and con-
 trol.                            As indicated by Lin's statement cited above, P4ao
 and Lin were agreed in the early stages of the Cultural
 Revolution that this dominant political role of the Army
 was only a temporary expedient until the violence and
 disorder of the Cultural Revolution subsided and "new
 leaders" could be found.   To understand the most important
 of the many policy issues in the purge of Lin Piao, it

 is necessary to understand how Hao and Lin cane to dis-
 agree on the central issue of civilian versus military
 control over China's political system.
 In a very real sense, the growing disagreement over
 the respective roles of civilian and military authority
 in the period from 1967 to 1971 reflected mounting fric-
 tion over the roles of Piao and Lin in the new structure
 of power.   As Hao turned away from the "destructive"
 please of the Cultural Revolution (centering on the destruc-
 tion of his opponents entrenched within the old Party
 and government apparaty ) to the "constructive" phase
 of defining post-Cultural Revolution domestic and foreign
 policies and building a new political apparatus, he began
 to turn increasingly to Chou En-lai for advice and assist-
 ance, and to stress the need for rehabilitation of civilian
 "veteran Party cadres" as more experienced and expert in
 carrying out these complicated tasks.   Sensing Mao's
 increasing reliance upon Chou En-lai, and 11ao's concurrent
 shift toward a more moderate policy line as a threat to
 his position as the successor, Lin then began to turn to the
 Army (his other major base of power aside from Mao) and
 to Chen Po-ta (the architect of a number of the Leftist
 policies of the Cultural. Revolution) for support in a
 struggle for the succession,   When Mao first suspected
 and then became convinced that Lin was opposing his efforts
 to re-establish civilian Party control, the issue of
 civilian versus military control became the central issue
 in a protracted political struggle which would lead in
 time to the fall of Lin Piao.
 Although personal attitudes and impressions are
 hard to document, the record does seem to indicate clearly
 l.iao's growing disillusionment with the performance of Lin
 Piao and the military apparatus over a period of time,
 dating back at least as far as the Ninth Party Congress
 in the spring of 1969.

 events which culminated in Lin's abortive coup attempt
 began in early 1969 when Mao issued the first of many
 warnings to Army representatives serving in the new
 Revolutionary Committee structure to correct their
 defective work-style. Mao in these warnings characterized
 this work-style variously as "arrogant and complacent"
 or "crude and careless," defects which he charged (for
 example, in his 28 April 1969 speech to the First Plenum
 of the Ninth Central Committee) were responsible for
 "mistakes" in the implementation of regime policies.
 Coupled with this early warning against Army mistakes in
 policy implementation was the charge appearing in an
 August 1969 Red Flag article that these "leading cadres"
 in the new structure of power were violating the require-
 ment of "collective leadership"; that is, were slighting
 or suppressing the viewpoints of the civilian components
 of these Revolutionary Committees, and thus were guilty,
 as subsequently charged, of "one-man rule."
 In a series of articles published in November 1969,
 Mao's criticism intensified with the leveling of a new
 and more serious charge against the PLA-dominated appara-
 tus:   that its defective work-style resulted from ideolo-
 gical shortcomings and a bourgeois world outlook.   An
 important 5 November People's  Daily editorial criticized
 this work-style as "bureaucratic, subjective and formalistic,"
 in contrast with Mao's practical and realistic work-style.
 In what appears in retrospect to be a significant allu-
 sion, a commentary in the November 1969 issue of Red Flag
 refuted the argument that "so long as one has a correct
 main orienta`.ion, the question of work-style is a minor
 matter."  Since Lin Piao is now attacked for advancing
 this very argument (as he in fact did), it appears that
 Mao and Lin may already by the fall of 1969 have had dif-
 ferences of opinion over the reliability and loyalty of
 the Army-dominated political apparatus.
 Strengthening the view that the issue of civilian
 versus military control may already have surfaced was a

 significant alteration at this time of the formula express-
 ing command and control over the People's Liberation Army.
 Whereas previously the standard formulation had been
 "personally founded and led by Chairman Mao and directly
 commanded by Vice-Chairman Lin," leadership of the PLA
 was now depicted (in the authoritative 1 October 1969
 National 1)ay editorial) as "founded and led personally
 by Chairman Mao and commanded directly by Chairman Mao
 and Vice-Chairman Lin'   un erlining supplied).   Although
 this change to cal  attention to Mao's direct command

 as demonstrating heightened regime concern over the pos-
 sibility of a Sino-Soviet border war, it now appears
 that this change re-

 against Lin.

 It was at just about this time, in November 1969,
 moreover, that the Central Committee launched an investi-
 gation (reportedly under the direction of Chou En-lai)
 of the "5/16" group, a hypermilitant Red Guard organiza-
 tion which in 1967 had engaged in conspiracy to seize
 power and in 1969 generally symbolized the extremism,
 violence and Leftist excesses of the Cultural Revolution.
 Although perhaps intended more as a warning to Chen Po-
 ta and other radical ideologues at this stage, many of
 the charges of "ultra-Leftism" leveled against the "5/16"
 group at this time (e.g. their "desire for instant Com-
 munism" and their persecution of "veteran Party cadres")
 would be leveled subsequently against Lin Piao and his
 military supporters.
 As a final indication of a growing divergence
 throughout 1969 between 11ao and Lin, the recent Party
 documents purporting to explain the Lin affair charge
 that Lin's conduct and behavior toward Mao changed fol-
 lowing'the Ninth Party Congress in April of that year.
 In a criticism remarkably similar to one made earlier
 against Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping for their con-
 duct in the period preceding the Cultural Revolution,
 it is charged that Lin "isolated himself, and took no
 notice of, nor did he seek the advice and opinions of
 Mao Tse-tung."  In fact, this changed relationship re-
 sulted more, it is believed, from a change in the conduct
 and attitude of A1ao who, as noted above, turned away from
 Lin to rely increasingly on Chou En-lai and to espouse
 more moderate policies following the Ninth Party Congress.
 Feeling himself "isolated" from Mao, Lin then turned for
 support to his other major source of power, the Army.
 In this way, then, the larger problem of civilian versus
 military control was being transformed into a personal
 struggle between Mao and Lin for control of the structure
 of power in China.

 I1ao's growing distrust of his chosen successor in
 the fall of 1969 was manifested dramatically in ?larch
 1970 when Mao decided to remove the post of Chairman of
 the State from the new draft Chinese People's Republic
 Constitution.   Lip apparently interpreted this decision,

 for advice and assistance, had in some ways already become
 the de facto successor, this action suggested that Mao

 Following this momentous decision, two developments
 in mid-1970 set the stage for the dramatic confrontation
 which would. take place between Mao and Lin at the Second
 Plenum in August.   First was the movement instructing the
 PLA to study Mlao's thought on Party-building, centering
 on "Article 5 of the Party Constitution" -- the article
 which specifies civilian Party leadership over the Army.
 The second was publication in the authoritative 1 July

 of Lin Piao,  Tung Pi-wu has once again appeared regularly
 in the position of "acting Chief of State," a position
 in which he was identified briefly in October 1969 and
 then not again till February 1972.   This suggests that
 Lin's interpretation of Mao's March 1970 decision was
 correct -- that it was directed not at the office but
 at the man who was supposed to inherit that office.

 selecting  Communist Party members,  which differed sharply
 from those advanced by Lin Piao in August 1966 at the out-
 set of the Cultural Revolution.   Lin on that earlier oc-
 casion had defined a loyal Maoist (one therefore entitled
 to Party menibersliip) as one who eagerly studied Mao thought,
 attached great importance to political and ideological
 work, and was filled with revolutionary zeal; the 1 July
 1970 editorial redefined a loyal Maoist as one who was loyal
 to Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung Thought and to Chairman
 ilao's proletarian revolutionary line (featuring the
 combination of theory with practice), who trusted the masses
 and practiced collective leadership, and who, after making
 mistakes, was willing to conduct self-criticism.   By
 omitting any reference to Lin's three criteria, redefining
 ;Taoism in less Leftist terms  (P1ao would soon tell Couve
 de Murville in October that he was a "center-Leftist")
 and continuing to attack (indirectly) the "arrogance and
 complacency" of PLA representatives serving in the new.
 structure of power, this editorial helps to explain why
 Lin Piao (who saw Mao withdrawing his right to the succes-
 sion), Chen Po-ta (who was vulnerable, at a time when the
 policy line was shifting to the Right, as the exemplar of
 "ultra-Leftism") and four top-ranking military leaders
 (who viewed Mao's escalating pressure on the military
 apparatus as a threat to themselves) banded together "to
 prepare and launch a surprise attack" at the Second Plenum
 at Lushan in August 1970.
 This attack, contained in speeches by Lin Piao
 and Chen Po-ta, was directed at those leaders (Kang
 Sheng directly, Chou En-lai indirectly) who, in drafting
 the new State Constitution, had deleted the post of
 Chairman and a provision extolling the "genius" of Mao
 Tse-tung.   By so doing, Lin and Chen charged, Kang and
 Chou had revealed their opposition to Mao's leadership
 and Mao's thought and, accordingly, should be criticized
 and presumably purged.  Attempting to use Mao's name,

 in order to win majority support, the strategy of what
 would come to be known as Lin Piao's "conspiratorial
 clique" backfired when 11ao rejected both the proposal for
 a State Chairman (reminding Lin that on six earlier oc-
 casions he had told him "ive do not need a Chairman of
 the State") and the view of "genius" which Lin and Chen
 had propounded in their speeches.   Choosing this overt
 test of struggle in an effort to protect himself and
 his military structure of power, Lin was forced to
 retreat on the political battlefield (withdrawing the
 minutes of his speech and dissociating himself from Chen
 Po-ta) and to turn from openly-declared political combat
 to the clandestine plotting of a coup d'etat as the last
 act of a desperate man seeking to reclaim by force what
 had once been granted to him and then taken away -- his
 right to rule China as 11ao's successor.
 Since it was apparent to Mao that Lin was challeng-
 ing him as the head of a powerful military organization
 (he subsequently referred to this struggle at Lushan as
 the tenth major struggle between opposing "lines" and
 "two headquarters" in the history of the Chinese Communist
 Party), llao was compelled to be cautious and circumspect

 any action
 against Lin at this juncture without concrete proof of
 conspiracy would have aroused opposition from military
 leaders and might have resulted in civil war.   Instead,
 Mao at the Second Plenum intensified the continuing
 pressure on Lin's military apparatus by initiating a
 "criticize revisionism and rectify wvork-style" campaign
 which would dominate China's political life throughout

 "criticize revisionism and rectify work-style" campaign
 and its predecessor, the Cultural Revolution.   A central
 feature of both was to transfer responsibility for the
 failure of the preceding policy line from Mao who had
 originated it to the political apparatus which had im-
 plemented it.  The strategy for both was to hold a few
 "class enemies" at the top primarily responsible for the
 mistakes committed in carrying out the previous policy
 line, accusing them of formulating and spreading a "revi-
 sionist" ideology which then corrupted the work-style
 of leading cadres at intermediate and lower levels of
 the apparatus.  Whereas the Cultural Revolution had, at
 a time when the policy line was shifting to the Left,
 attacked Rightist "revisionism" and the resulting
 "bureaucratic" work-style of the Party apparatus, the
 objects of attack in the campaign initiated at the Second
 Plenum, at a time when the policy line was shifting to
 the Right, were a form of Leftist "revisionism" and the
 resulting work-style of "arrogance and complacency" of
 the PLA-dominated political apparatus.
 Within this larger strategy, a common tactic in
 both campaigns was to identify the "class enemies" at
 the top either singly or in small groups at different
 stages, worLing upwards to reach the number two man in
 the Chinese Communist leadership held ultimately respon-
 sible for the conduct of the political apparatus under
 his control.
 Lin was not deceived by Mao's
 initial tactic of focusing exclusively on Chen Po-ta
 (attacked as an "ultra-Leftist" and "political swindler")
 in the early months of this latest rectification campaign.
 As early as the winter of 1970-1971, Lin sensed that he
 would be the ultimate target of this campaign and by
 spring of 1971, his suspicions hardened to a conviction,
 he was already engaged in plotting a desperate coup d'etat
 as preferable to the certain fate of political disgrace
 which lay before him.

 Although primary responsibility for the failure
 of the preceding policy line was assigned to a few "class
 enemies" in the central leadership in Peking, leading
 cadres at the regional and provincial levels  (the civilian
 Party First Secretaries in the Cultural Revolution and
 the military leaders who dominated the political apparatus
 following the Cultural Revolution) were also held partially
 responsible for the mistakes committed in carrying out
 the previous policy line.   This responsibility resulted
 from ideological failings which,  in the period preceding
 the Cultural Revolution, had caused them to deviate to
 the Right by overemphasizing production at the expense of
 politics and, in the period following the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, had caused them to deviate to the Left by overempha-
 sizing politics at the expense of production.   The three-
 fold remedy for this latest error of "Left deviationism"
 was, by means of the "criticize revisionism and rectify

 remould their thinking (by studying P.iao's philosophic
 works and thus learning how to "integrate theory with
 practice" and to adopt a "realistic and scientific" ap-
 proach to problems);  (2) to rectify their work-style (cor-
 recting the defects of "arrogance and complacency" and
 overcoming the tendency toward "one man mule" by respecting
 the collective leadership of civilian Party committees) ;
 and (3) to demonstrate their loyalty to Mao and their will-
 ingness to return to the correct Maoist line by engaging in
 self-criticism.
 Since the road to power in the Cultural Revolution
 of both Lin Piao and the PLA had been one of "giving
 prominence to politics," the central charge in this
 campaign -- that an overemphasis on politics had resulted
 in "Leftist deviationism" in the implementation of Mao's
 policy line -- served to undercut one of the most important
 justifications for Lin's and the PLA's continued right to
 rule.   The generally negative response of military author-
 ities throughout China to this rectification campaign

 indicated, moreover, that they were quite aware that it
 threatened their continued domination of the political
 structure.  This response, in well-documented instances
 at the Military Region level (e.g., the Canton MR) was to
 ignore  the  campaign's  injunctions  to  change  course,  carry
 out self-criticism and obey the directives of the civilian
 Party apparatus.   Further, a number of regional and pro-
 vincial military commanders continued, in the face of
 mounting evidence that both Lin and the Army's political
 role were under Maoist attack, openly to praise Lin Piao
 and glorify the Army.  Although this was true in a number
 of provinces throughout the early months of 1971  (e.g.
 Shantung, Sinkiang, Kwangsi and Iiupeh), it was most
 gra.phicall  ? illustrated in Fukien where, as late as April
 1971 in his Party Congress speech, the Foochow MR Commander
 Han Hsien-chu assigned almost as much prominence and praise
 to Lin Piao as he did to Mao.
 This striking manifestation of resistance to the
 "criticize revisionism and rectify work-style" campaign
 confirmed what Mao already knew -- that in Lin and his
 military supporters he faced a powerful adversary against
 whom he would have to move cautiously both at the center
 and in the provinces.  Apparently feeling that the time
 had come, Mao in August and early September 1971 conducted
 an inspection tour of the Canton and Nanking Military
 Regions aimed generally at "educating cadres, achieving
 unity and denouncing conspiracies and intrigues" and
 specifically at seeking assurances of support from these
 regional military leaders in an impending showdown with
 Lin and his group of military leaders.   The struggle
 between Mao and Lin for control of the political-military
 apparatus (the issue of civilian versus military control)
 had reached a flaslipoint, soon to explode in the bizarre
 sequence of events beginning with an abortive Lin-
 sponsored attempt to assassinate Mao and culminating in
 Lin's fiery death in a plane crash in Mongolia.

 The Issue of the Scale of the Purge
 The other thing the Chairman  [Mao]
 was most unhy about [concerning the
 Cultural Revolution] was the maltreatment
 of 'captives' -- Party m'mbers and others
 removed from power and subjected to re-
 education...   Maltreatment of [these]
 captives...  had slowed the rebuilding
 and transformation of the Party.
 -- Edgar Snow, "A Conversation with Mao
 Tse-tung," in Life, 30 April 1971.
 I was told [by a Chinese official]
 that the first disagreement between the
 two hierarchies  [the political and mili-
 tary] concerned the scale of the purge
 within the Party...   The supporters of a
 more radical purge... dreamed about a
 pure and hard Party, but they came up
 against Mao Tse-tung who... wished to
 limit the damage...  and against Chou En-
 Zai who was anxious not to break the
 tool [the Party].
 -- Claude Julien, "The Lin Piao Mystery,"
 in Le Monde, 30 December 1971.
 If it is true)
 that Mao even before the Ninth Party Congress suspected
 Lin of opposing Party leadership over the Army, there is
 reason to believe that Mao sensed this opposition first
 in a disagreement over "the scale of the purge within the
 Party."  Beginning in the fall of 1968 (when the task of
 rebuilding the Party was first undertaken) and continuing

 right up to the dramatic events of September 1971, this
 was a dispute not over the need to purify the old Party
 apparatus (a central aim of the Cultural Revolution) but
 over the manner in which and the extent to which, this
 purge was to be carried out.   The outcome of this struggle
 between two groups of "radicals" (including Lin Piao, Chen
 Po-ta and probably Kang Sheng as well) and "moderates"
 (including on this issue Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai)
 within the top leadership would determine, of course,
 who would control the new post-Cultural Revolution struc-
 ture of power.
 There is good evidence that Mao, who initiated
 the attack on high-ranking Party cadres at the outset
 of the Cultural Revolution, had become alarmed by reports
 of widespread violence and of the wholesale purge and
 replacement of old cadres in the nation-wide "purification
 of class ranks" campaign carried out by the military-
 dominated apparatus in the fall of 1968.   Reacting to
 this early example of "maltreatment" of Party cadres,
 Mao directed that no further arrests be made without
 prior approval at the provincial Revolutionary Committee
 level and further instructed (in the 1969 New Year's
 Day editorial) that in carrying out this campaign there-
 after "the target of attack must be narrowed and more
 people must be helped through education."  This new
 emphasis on moderation in "class struggle" was extended
 at the Ninth Party Congress to provide "a way out"
 ("liberation" and "suitable work") even for "bourgeois
 reactionary academic authorities" and "capitalist roaders
 in power."  Intended to signal the end of the "destructive"
 phase of the Cultural Revolution, the new emphasis on
 unity and conciliation at the Party Congress also indi-
 cated a desire to get on with the final "constructive"
 phase of the Cultural Revolution in which the central
 task was reconstructing the Chinese Communist Party.

 mittee immediately following the close of the Congress,

 Mao stressed the need to "be careful and prudent" in
 rebuilding the Party, citing the previous "mistake"
 which had resulted iron "carelessness" of "arresting...
 too many people."  Asserting that it is "always better
 to unite more people" including even "those who oppose
 us," Mao then repeated an earlier instruction that it
 was the responsibility of the military to solve the wide-
 spread problem of factionalism, quarreling and disunity
 at provincial and local levels of the new political
 structure.   As the de facto government already held
 responsible for solving~l other problems in their
 local areas, the military apparatus was now informed
 that it was also responsible for rebuilding a united
 civilian Party which would then replace it as the right-
 fui ruler of China,
 This reminder to the military that its dominant
 political role was only temporary and transitional was
 made more pointed in accompanying editorials (for example,
 the 17 February 1969 People's Daily editorial entitled
 "To Be Good at Translating the Party's Policy Into Action
 by the Masses") pointing out that "veteran Party cadres"
 were better qualified, because of their "richer experi-
 ence and better understanding of the Party's policies",
 to undertake the complicated tasks of the new "construc-
 tive" stage of the Cultural Revolution.   Whereas Lin Piao
 had stressed simple political virtues (the eager study
 of Mao thought, the earnest promotion of political and
 ideological work, and revolutionary zeal) as the criteria
 for selecting new leaders during the initial "destructive"
 stage of the Cultural Revolution, now more emphasis was
 to be placed on professional qualifications in selecting
 Party leadership cadres,   In terms of the familiar Maoist
 dialectical formulation of the ideal cadre -- both "red
 and expert" -- the pendulum was now swinging back from
 the earlier Cultural Revolution extreme of excessive reli-
 ance on "redness" to a position in which "expertness" was
 now considered to be of at least equal if not greater
 importance in the selection of new leaders..

 The implications of this shift from revolutionary
 to professional criteria (a shift undoubtedly encouraged
 by Chou 1,n-lai in the interest of administrative effici-
 ency) in the selection of new Party leaders were clear
 -- most of these were to be old Party cadres who, having
 been properly educated and transformed, were to be "liber-
 ated" and returned to their former or similar positions
 of authority.   Sensing a threat to their continued exer-
 cise of political power, both radical ideologues and
 military leaders, not only in Peking but also at pro-
 vincial levels, had reason to join forces to carry out
 what is now called an "ultra-leftist" cadre policy char-
 acterized either by wholesale purging of old Party cadres
 or "failing to liberate cadres on time,"
 The mechanism for carrying out this "ultra- leftist"
 cadre, policy was the May 7 Cadre School, an institution
 to which old  Party cadres were sent. for a refresher course
 in Mao Thought study and hard physical labor and where
 through faithful performance of these duties they could
 demonstrate anew their loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao's
 revolutionary line. By mid-1970, 100,000 cadres from the
 central political apparatus and some one million cadres
 at the provincial level had been sent down to these schools
 in the countryside for study and labor,   The flaw in this
 arrangement was that these schools were run by the PLA,
 with military leaders empowered to decide whether the old
 Party cadres had passed the test of political loyalty and
 were thus entitled to return to positions of authority in
 the new political apparatus.  The charge that the Cultural
 Revolution Group radical ideologues and the PLA abused
 this authority to prevent the rehabilitation of veteran
 Party cadres and thus perpetuate their own power -- a
 charge first intimated by Mao to Snow in December 1970
 and now explicitly stated -- is both credible and supported
 by developments at the time,

 There are a number of indications, for example,
 that beginning in the fall of 1969 Mao was turning to
 Chou En-lai for advice and assistance in dealing with
 this coalition of radical civilian and military leaders
 intent upon perpetuating the power structure and  olicies
 of the Cultural Revolution.
 as early as October 1969 Chou had been entrusted with
 full authority to prepare for convening a National People's
 Congress  (which would then approve a new State Constitu-
 tion and establish a new Central Government apparatus)
 and that one of the reasons why the Congress was post-
 poned on several occasions in the ensuing year was that
 the continued practice of "military control" was considered
 incompatible with the NPC idea of rule by the people
 (i.e. civilian rule).   Thus, if Chou was not yet in a
 position to challenge military dominance in other areas
 (for example, at provincial and local levels of the new
 political apparatus) he could at least (with Mao's
 authorization) keep the military from moving in to
 dominate the slowly emerging Central Government structure.
 Another development in the fall of 1969 was the
 holding in November of a national leadership meeting at
 which a series of important policy decisions were made,
 two of which concerned this ongoing struggle for control
 of the post-Cultural Revolution political apparatus.
 First was the decision, apparently made at this time,
 to abolish the Cultural Revolution Group (which had been
 charged with carrying out most of the Leftist policies
 and programs of the Cultural Revolution) and to demote
 its head Chen Po-ta to a position of relative unimportance
 (there is no record of Chen making a speech or even a
 private statement relating to policy after October 1969).
 The second was the concurrent decision to initiate
 the campaign noted earlier against the "5/16" group, the
 militant Red Guard organization active in 1967 which now
 symbolized both the discredited policies of the Cultural
 Revolution and those who continued to promote these

 policies.   A central charge in the anti-"5/16" group
 campaign as it unfolded in 1969-1970 was that it had
 been guilty of "ultra-leftism" in its attitude and
 behavior toward Party cadres -- specifically, that it
 had "wrongly accused people..   hung tip the cases of
 cadres for years...  [and] wanted to exclude all veteran
 cadres."  These charges would be extended a year later
 to apply to Chen Po-ta (explicitly) and Kang Sheng
 (implicitly) and then further extended another year
 later to apply to Lin Piao and his supporters throughout
 the military apparatus.
 Lin's responsibility for tine "ultra-
 leftist" ca re policy is traced back to the three criteria
 he had formulated in August 1966 (with P1ao's approval)
 for defining a loyal Maoist -- criteria which stressed
 the simplified study of Mao thought, the primacy of
 political and ideological work, and revolutionary zeal.
 These criteria, it is now charged, were used by his
 military apparatus following the Cultural Revolution
 to strike at and purge systematically without cause
 veteran Party cadres (employing the argument among others
 that "the older the cadres, the more outmoded they are")
 in order to appoint friends and proteges to positions of
 authority in the new political apparatus.  To correct
 this unjust and corrupt use of power, there has been in
 recent months a campaign to rehabilitate veteran cadres
 (90 to 95 percent at local levels), including even the
 much-maligned Commander of the Wuhan Military Region
 Chen Tsai-tao, who in mid-1967 had achieved notoriety for
 allegedly leading a mutiny against Peking.
 With the fall of Lin Piao and his principal sup-
 porters, the issue of the scale of the purge appears to
 have been largely resolved, with Chou En-lai on record
 as estimating that not more than one percent of the
 membership has been expelled from the Party as a result

 of the Cultural Revolution.   In the struggle over this
 issue, a struggle which began in the spring of 1969,
 Mao and Chou have emerged victorious, with the result
 that more experienced and expert civilian Party cadres
 are now beginning to take over from the military cadres
 who, since the beginning of the Cultural Revolution,
 have dominated the structure of power in China.

 The Issue of Foreign Policy
 A highly dramatic and visible issue, the role of
 foreign policy in domestic political conflict in general
 and in the Lin Piao affair in particular must be approached
 with great care.  In addition to the usual difficulty of
 attempting to ascertain the positions adopted by leaders
 of opposing factions or interest groups on the domestic
 political scene, there is the complicating factor that
 the actions undertaken by foreign governments have a signi-
 ficant impact on the development and outcome of the internal
 1leadership debate on foreign policy.   There is  he further

 complicating factor that Chinese officials have, in briefing
 non-Communist Westerners, tended to exaggerate the import-
 ance of foreign policy out of a desire to minimize the still
 potentially explosive central issue in the Lin Piao affair
 of civilian versus military control in China.   Finally,
 there is a strong temptation to define a priori the foreign
 policy issue in terms of a dispute concerning the triangular
 relationship' between China, the Soviet Union and the United
 States, with one group favoring a rapprochement with the
 Soviet Union and the other with the United States.   In
 fact, it appears that Mao, Lin, Chou and the top PLA leaders
 were all agreed that the Soviet Union constituted the gravest military threat to China and that policy differences vis-
 a-vis the USSR, if any, were confined to questions of
 degree and emphasis.
 The evidence, as illustrated by the quotation
 cited above, indicates that the role of foreign policy
 in the Lin Piao affair was more tactical than causative
 or fundamental in nature.   The dispute, moreover, con-
 cerned not so much which of the two great powers, Russia
 or America, China should conciliate, but whether China
 should switch from the confrontationist and isolationist
 Foreign policy posture of the Cultural Revolution to a
 more flexible and pragmatic approach.  _An intensive
 review...-of the record indicates, furthe.rmore.,.....th.a.t-._the
 impact of developments abroad upon-this internal policy
 debate, while significant, was not decisive,   The effect
 of"these develolments, principally those in Southeast
 Asia, would be one of slowing down but not reversing the
 trend toward moderation in China's relations with the outA11'
 side world.
 In contrast with other policy issues, Lin Piao
 is clearly on record as one of the principal architects
 of what might be called the "revolutionary model" of
 foreign policy which dominated China's foreign relations
 during the Cultural Revolution.   In his famous treatise

 on people's war published on 3 September 1965, Lin pro-
 claimed the need to promote revolution abroad patterned
 after the Chinese revolutionary model, a model featuring
 rural-based armed struggle which would then surround and
 finally capture the cities.   In his speech commemorating
 the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution on 6 Novem-
 ber 1967, Lin depicted this model (which Chairman Mao "with
 genius" had created) as a "great new development" in both
 the Marxist-Leninist theory and practice of revolution and,
 as such, having general validity throughout the world.
 And in the accompanying joint People's Dailyy. Red Flag
 and Liberation Army Daily editoria  on this occasion,
 Chairman Mao was haile  as "the greatest teacher and most
 outstanding leader of the, proletariat in the present era"
 and China was declared to be "the center of world revolu-
 tion."
 In practice, as is now well known, this effort to
 propagate Mao's thought and thus promote revolution abroad
 embroiled China in controversy with nearly every important
 government of the world.   The realization that, as a re-
 sult of the provocative and self-defeating foreign policy
 of the Cultural Revolution, China stood isolated in the
 face of a major threat to its national security then pro-
 duced a turn to the Right toward a more pragmatic and
 moderate foreign policy, a process which began hesitantly
 in the fall of 1967 and has proceeded through several
 fairly well-defined stages up to the present.   Since Chou
 En-lai personified this turn toward what might be called
 a "nation.alis_t model  of__ foreigr__policy,__as _.L.in Piao had
 personified the_._p_rece.ding "revolutionary._jnode.l.," the
 dispute over the issue of foreign policy in a real sense
 has been a dispute between these two leaders, each striv-
 ing to enlist support for his views.   The record shows,
 moreover, that Chairman Mao backed Chou throughout most
 of this struggle, providing decisive support in the final
 showdown debate when (as noted above) Lin stood up in a
 Central Committee meeting to oppose the proposed visit
 of President Nixon to China.

 The first stage in this protracted process of re-
 treating from Left (the "revolutionary model") to Right
 (the "nationalist model") in foreign policy extended from
 the fall of 1967 through the summer of 1968 and was marked
 by the return of Premier Chou En-lai to a dominant role
 in foreign affairs.   Speaking to workers in this field             At
 in December 1961, Chou reminded his listeners that like
 it or not Peking had no choice but to deal with other
 countries primarily as sovereign states and governments and
 quoted Mao as stating that China during the preceding sum-
 mer had been guilty of "great-power chauvinism."  Also
 revealing a new awareness of the nationalist sensibilities
 of Communist Parties and other governments throughout the
 world, the Chinese leadership in a Central Committee deci-
 sion in_ 1.1.~1968 directed that Chinese propaganda intended
 for - foreign audiences would no longer refer to China as
 "the center of world revolution" or to Mao Tse-tung as
 "the leader" of the international Communist movement or
 as "the leader of the peoples of the world" -- views which
 Chou En-lai would subsequently (in mid-1971) characterize
 as "ultra-leftist."  That Mao in 1968 was already dis-
 sociating himself from these "ultra-leftist" views was
 indicated by his instruction in September to a Japanese
 revolutionary group that,  instead of blindly initiating
 China's revolutionary model, it should "integrate the uni-
 versal truths of Marxism-L?,ninism with the concrete
 practice of its own revolution."
 The second stage in this slow process of moving
 toward the Right in foreign policy lasted from the Soviet
 invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 through a series
 of border clashes with the Soviet Union in 1969 and the
 Cambodia military campaign in the spring of 1970 to the
 Second Plenum in August 1970.  Within this stage two

 imperialist" and "social-fascist"), a solemn declaration
 (subsequently identified as Maoist) of the arrival of a
 "new historical stage of opposition to United States
 imperialism and Soviet revisionism," and the launching
 of a massive "war preparations" campaign in which (as
 Lin Piao put it) "all work" was to be "observed, examined
 and approached from the standpoint of ware"  This "war
 preparations" campaign justified:   (1) in politics, the
 continued domination by the military of the political

 the combined South Vietnamese and United States military
 intervention in Cambodia three weeks earlier, the Chinese
 leader -- in what would subsequently be referred to as
 "Mao's new evaluation of the international scene" --
 declared in effect that the United States had now displaced
 the Soviet, Union as China's number one enemy,   The personal
 insults and hostile rhetoric formerly reserved for the
 Soviet Union and the Soviet leadership were now heaped
 on the United States government (engaged in "fascist rule")
 and on President Nixon (the prepetrator of "fascist atroci-
 ties").   This new hostile and confrontationist posture
 toward the United States was revealed even more clearly
 in a 25 June 1970 joint editorial entitled "People of Asia,
 Unite and Drive the U.S. Aggressors Out of Asia," in which

 it was stated unequivocally that "one's attitude to the
 United States is the principal criterion for judging a
 true or sham revolutionary."
 The other -- and contradictory -- trend throughout
 this period was one clearly associated with Chou Fn-lai
 which sought to substitute negotiation for confrontation
 and to adopt a more flexible foreign policy stance at a
 time of national danger.   This flexible approach was to
 be applied towards both superpowers, first toward the
 United States in the tentative invitation in November
 1968 (later withdrawn) to resume the Warsaw talks, and
 then toward the Soviet Union in the October 1969 agreement
 to negotiate the Sino-Soviet border dispute.   It was in
 keeping with this flexible strategy of playing the United
 States and the Soviet Union against each other that Chair-
 man Mao, on the day following the United States military
 intervention in Cambodia in the spring of 1970, osten'a-
 tiously sought out the chief Soviet negotiator on the
 reviewing stand at May Day for a friendly chat,  including
 an injunction to get on with the border talks.
 Keeping in mind that Chairman Mao (as well as
 Premier Chou) is renowned as a master of tactics, a close
 reading of the ensuing 20 May statement suggests, more-
 over, that it was intended not only for use in the struggle
 against China's enemies abroad but alsc for use in the
 continuing struggle for control of the political apparatus
 at home.   For it was by virtue of the much-quoted dictum

 retrospect that an equally important if not more important
 objective of Mao's in issuing this 20 Play statement was
 to undercut Lin's and the military's right to rule at home.
 This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that
 Peking, following the issuance of this statement, did not
 in fact significantly step-up material support for revolu-
 tionary armed struggle throughout the world.   In authori-
 tative explanations of this 20) May statement in July and   ~.r-- T
 August 1970, Chou En-lai and rang Sheng were quite explicit
 in pointing. out that revolutionary organizations abroad
 would have to rely on their own resources and that, since
 in most areas of the world "no revolutionary possibilities
 existed," China, rather than providing political, military
 and financial support to revolutionary groups abroad,
 would seek to promote the interests of world revolution
 thereafter by relying primarily on state-to-state relations.
 Underlining the need (in accordance with Mao's teachings)
 to "combine Marxism-Leninism with reality in each country,"
 these officials criticized the mistakes of "left-extremism"
 and "great-nation chauvinism" in China's foreign relations
 during the Cultural Revolution, citing as one example the
 mistake of claiming universal validity for China's revolu-
 tionary model.   Since Lin Piao was the only prominent
 Chinese leader on record as having committed this mistake,
 it appears that Mao's 20 May statement, far from represent-
 ing a return to the "ultra-leftist" foreign policy line
 of the Cultural Revolution, was being used as a tactical
 weapon in the accelerating struggle between the proponent
 of civilian (Maoist) versus military (Lin Piao) control
 over the political apparatus within China.
 It is in this larger framework of a struggle for
 power, then, that the last stage of turning to the Right
 in foreign policy -- a stage represented by the dramatic
 debate within Peking's top leadership over President
 Nixon's visit -- must be understood.   Although the terms
 of this debate are now fairly well known, the timing and

 occasion can only be deduced on the basis of related
 developments.   It is of crucial importance, in attempt-
 ing to ascertain when the debate took place, to know
 when the proposal for a visit reached China's top policy-
 makers.   This, according to Edgar Snow, had taken place
 "by late autumn of 1970" when "several urgent and
 authentically documented inquiries reaching China had
 indicated that the President wished to know whether he
 or hir, representative would be received in Peking."
 This suggests that the debate took place no earlier than
 the: Second Plenum (Au ust-Septem. er_,.,19-IQ) and probably
 at an expanded Politburo meeting held in November to sum
 up and criticize the errors committed by Chen Po-ta.
 That the debate (characterized as one between Lin and
 Chou, with Mao coming down on the side of Chou) was held
 no later than November is suggested by Mao's assurances
 to Snow (in their conversation of 18 December 1970) that
 President Nixon "would be welcome" -- that "he could just
 get on a plane and come."  The actual invitation would
 not be tendered, however, until sometime the following
 spring, only after the new crisis in Sino-American rela-
 tions occasioned by the South Vietnamese invasion of Laos
 had been resolved.
 As indicated in the quotation cited at the beginning
 of this discussion, Lin based his opposition to President
 Nixon's visit not so much on considerations of power as
 of ideology, portraying negotiations with the United
 States as a betrayal of the Chinese and world revolutions.
 This was probably dictated by tactical considerations,
 since it was difficult to deny that the Soviet Union with
 more than a million armed men posed on the Sino-Soviet
 border represented a graver threat to China's national
 security.   It seems fairly clear, moreover, that although
 Lin used -;ie Soviet Union as a counter in his argument
 against the Nixon visit, he did so more from a desire to
 score debating points  (he is reported to have said, for
 example, "If Mao can invite Nixon,__why__carL't.._.I_inv.i.te_

 The Issue of Economic Policy

 emphasis to materials, machines, mechani-
 zation, and so-called material incentives...
 The other way is our way Zed by Chairman
 Mao in which revolution leads mechaniza-

 ?- Lin Piao, Address at the Chinese Com-
 munist Party Central Committee Work
 Conference, 25 October 1966.
 The emergence of the situation of
 great Zeap forward is the inevitable
 result of the development in depth of
 the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolu-
 tion...   A new Leap Forward in industrial
 and agricultural production is bound to
 appear after every great political
 campaign...   This is  'spirit being turned
 into material.'
 -- Canton Radio, 30 December 1969.
 One of the most distinctive elements of Hao's
 thought is reliance on political indoctrination to
 motivate and control human thought and behavior.   The
 ultimate expression of this political indoctrination,
 "mass-line" approach to economic development was the
 Great Leap Forward.  A central purpose of the Cultural
 Revolution, as indicated in the quotations cited above,
 was to arouse the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses
 preparatory to a new Leap Forward in economic development.

 The central charge now leveled against Lin Piao
 with respect to economic policy is that, whereas Liu Shao-
 chi (following the Soviet revisionist example) had com-
 mittel the Rightist error in the early 1960's of over-
 emphasizing the material factor, Lin and his colleagues
 are guilty of the "ultra-leftist" error of overemphasizing
 the human, spiritual factor in the production process.
 In ideological te'rlms, this overemphasis of the subjective
 factor is said to derive from the "bourgeois world out-
 look of idealism and metaphysics."  Although Lin, Chen
 Po-ta and other of their supporters at the top are held
 primarily responsible, leading cadres at intermediate and
 lower levels of the apparatus are also held responsible
 for having implemented this "ultra-leftist" economic
 policy line.
 Although grossly exaggerated and distorted, there
 is an element of truth in this indictment of the military-
 dominated apparatus for having handled poorly the complicated
 task of rebuilding the economy following the disruption
 of the Cultural Revolution.   In much the same way as it
 performed badly its task (assigned at the Ninth Party
 Congress) of rebuilding the political system, the end
 result of radical ideologues and military leaders to-
 gether controlling the formulation and implementation of
 economic policy in the period following the Ninth Patty
 Congress was an "ultra-leftist" tendency to go beyond
 Mao's policy guidelines, a tendency expressed first in
 setting unrealistic goals and then in resorting to
 coercion in an attempt to achieve these goals.
 Mao's policy guidelines were first outlined in an
 unpublished speech by Premier Chou En-lai on 4 May 1969
 and then discussed at greater length in an authoritative
 October 1969 Red Fla  article entitled "China's Road of
 Socialist Industria ization."  Although characterized by
 Chou as "Chairman Mao's new economic line," it was in many
 ways reminiscent of the eccnomic strategy which had

 produced the Great Leap Forward, only this time presented
 in a more reasoned and moderate vein in an apparent ef-
 fort to take account of earlier mistakes.   Vague and con-
 tradictory and perhaps inherently unworkable as these guide-
 lines were, it is not surprising that those leaders at
 both central and local levels responsible for interpreting
 and implementing them eventually came to grief.
 As spelled out in Chou' s speech and the Red Flag
 article, Mao in his new economic line called for a sus-
 tained high rate of economic development (as opposed to
 the low projections of economic growth which he attributed
 to Liu Shao-chi) by asserting that "we have unlimited pos-
 sibilities for developing our economy unceasingly and at
 a very rapid pace without parallel in capitalist economies."
 This was to be achieved in the modern industrial sector
 by rejecting Liu Shao-chi's doctrine of "trailing behind
 foreign countries at a snail's pace" and instead (as Mao had
 put it five years earlier) "making maximum use of advanced
 techniques so that our country can be built into a social-
 ist modern power within a not long historical period."
 This was to be achieved primarily in the non-modern
 sector, however, by mobilizing China's huge underemployed
 labor force to carry out Leap Forwards in agriculture and
 medium-and-small-scale industry.  To make this approach
 more appealing to the peasants  (who were expected, under
 the doctrine of self-reliance and local self-sufficiency,
 to finance this local industrial effort), the rapid develop-
 ment of local industry, it was stated, would bring about
 agricultural mechanization quickly and would, furthermore,
 by reducing the differences between town and country,
 facilitate the advance to Communism.   In this effort to
 undertake parallel Leap Forwards in industry (in both the
 small-scale and locally-financed and the large-scale
 centrally-financed industrial sectors) and simultaneous
 Leap Forwards in both industry and agriculture -- the entire
 undertaking to rely heavily on political indoctrination

 and ideological incentives -- there was ample room for
 controversy in the allocation of blame when the effort
 began to founder.
 Another feature of this "new economic line" -- the
 decentralization of administrative and economic power so
 that China, as Mao told Snow, could stimulate "regional
 and local initiatives" -- would also create difficulties
 in its implementation.   One difficulty was the divergence
 which began to develop among provinces in late 1969 and
 early 1970 in the understanding and execution of Mao's
 vague policy pronouncements.  Aligned on one side were
 zealots in such provinces as Heilungkiang and Kiangsi stress-
 ing revolutionary courage and daring as a prime requisite
 for promoting Leap Forwards in industry and agriculture
 and criticizing "rightist conservative cadres who failed
 to see the revolutionary zeal of the masses imbued with
 Mao Thought."  On the other side were more moderate leaders
 in such provinces as Liaoning and Kirin who stressed the
 need for a practical and realistic work-style, warned against
 the setting of unrealistic goals and pointed out the danger,
 in criticizing Liu Shao-chi's Rightist revisionist economic
 line, of going to the opposite Leftist extreme of neglect-
 ing production and equalizing the distribution of income.
 The problem of drafting China's Fourth Five Year
 Plan in accordance with the vague and contradictory pro-
 visions of Mao's "new economic line" was further complicated
 by the fact that at the time it was being drafted in 1969-
 1970 China was in the grips of a "preparations against
 war" campaign in which all work, including economic work,
 was, according to Lin Piao's injunction, to be "observed,
 examined and approached from the standpoint of war."  This
 provided an opportunity'  for military leaders at the Center
 to call for greater emphasis on the development of advanced
 weapons and military industry in the drafting of the Five
 Year Plan.   That this opportunity was exploited is suggested
 by the criticism, explicit and implicit, leveled against
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010049-3
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010049-3
 the first draft of this Plan after it was changed at (or
 shortly after) the Second Plenum in August 1970.
 The new draft of China's Fourth Five Year Plan,
 flected a basic decision to reject the Great L
 F
 eap
 orward
 approach in favor of a more realistic economic strategy;
 to shift investment resources away from the development
 of technologically advanced and military industry toward
 basic industry in a more balanced development of the national
 economy as a whole; and, at provincial and local levels,
 to place greater emphasis on the development of agricul-
 ture as opposed to local industry and, as a result, to
 stretch out the timetable for achievin     ricultural mech-
 anization.
 In what was probably an
 implicit reference to Chen Po-ta and other radical economic
 planners in China, Mao cautioned against those who promised
 spectacular development in the economic field within a
 short period and urged the Pakistani President to be candid
 in explaining the true status of the economy to his people.
 The 1971 New Year's Day editorial repeated an old Mao
 statement that it would take "several decades" to over-
 come China's economic backwardness, indicating publicly
 both the shift away from a Great Leap Forward approach
 in the drafting of China's Fourth Five Year Plan and Mao's
 endorsement  of this change in plan.
 Among the reasons for this shift toward a more
 realistic strategy of economic development, the basic
 reason was that the attempt in 1969-1970 to carry out a
 "practical" Leap Forward had failed.   Despite periodic
 injunctions (for example, in February and March and again
 in November 1969) to "leave enough leeway" in the drawing up
 of production plans, the practice of escalating production
 targets to demonstrate revolutionary zeal (for example,

 the goal of doubling grain production in a number of
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2009/12/03: CIA-RDP85T00875RO01000010049-3
 provinces within five years) had become widespread.
 Another reason for the change was the need to re-
 verse the trend toward decentralization of economic and
 administrative power and re-establish centralized con-
 trol over the economy.   What had happened was that the
 provinces (and the administrative subdivisions within
 the provinces) had abused the power entrusted to them,
 it was charged, to overemphasize the development of local
 industry at the expense of agriculture.   Kiangsi Province
 was a case in point.  Whereas only eight months earlier
 Kiangsi had been hailed as a national model and pace-
 setter, the provincial leadership in Kiangsi admitte.i
 in a long December 1970 editorial of self-criticism that
 it had been guilty of "blind development, departmental-
 ism and excessive decentralization" in its development
 of local industry.   In this admission of "blind develop-
 ment" of local industry, there was evidence that still
 another mistake of the earlier Great Leap Forward period
 -- the diversion of scarce human, financial and material
 resources from the agricultural to the industrial sector -
 had been repeated.   This admission was then made explicit -
 in a subsequent People's Daily discussion of "leftist"
 errors committed in carrying out agricultural mechaniza-
 tion, errors consisting of an excessive accumulation of
 funds from China's peasants and the allocation of exces-
 sive amounts of labor from agriculture to the development
 of local industry.
 A third reason, revealed by Chou En-lai in dis-
 cussing a dispute within the leadership over "guns versus
 butter" which he claimed had been a central issue in
 a "critical policy debate" preceding the fall of Lin
 Piao, was the difficulty which provincial officials had
 experienced in attempting to "persuade workers, peasants
 and soldiers to accept directives from Peking</div></div></div>  </div>
