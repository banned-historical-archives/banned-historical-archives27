			  	jArticle  by  Pierre-Yves  Cosse:    	"Algeria  in  Transition"J
 -				[Text]    	In  March  1979  the  high-ranking  Algerian  officers  chose  one  of  their  own,
			 	Chadli  Bendjedid,   	the  most  senior  officer  in  the  highest  rank,   	to  succeed  Houari
			 	Boumedienne.    	Their  choice  was  ratified  by  a  special  FLN  congress,   	specially
			 	assembled  by  the  nation`'s  leading  cadres.    	After  2  years  of  his  being  president,
			 	one  might  well  wonder  if  a  new  economic  and  political  system  is  in  the  process
			 	of  being  established  or  if  tre  changes  which  have  been  made  are  still  minor  ones,
			 	Recognizing  Economic  Mistakes
			 	jdhat  is  new	 	certainly  style  and  behavior,   	both  in  the  analysis  and  presentation
			 	of  problems  and  in  decision-making.    	There  exists  a"Ghadli  style"  marked  by  cau-
			 	tion,   	good  sense,  and  moderation  which  is  making  its  mark  in  all  sectors  of  govern-
			 	m~nt  activity.    	Algeria  no  longer  parades  its~l~  as  a"model"  for  developing
			 	countries,   	it  has  no  lessons  to  give,   	and  it  has  stopped  making  defiant  statements
			 	regarding  its  rate  of  development  and  modernization.    	It  recognizes  the  errors
			 	which  have  been  made,   	principally  in  the  economic  field,   	which  it  is  high  time  to
			 	c ~~�recr..
			 	Thus  there  is  open  criticism  of  the  ambitious  industrialization  of  which  Belaid
			 	Abdeslam  (SONATRACH's  first  president)  was  the  ardent  promoter.    	The  large  indus-
 ;				trial  complexes,   	which  resort   	to  complex  technologies  and  continuously  call  on
			 	massive  znd  costly  foreign  cooperation  for  assistance,   	are  creating  new  forms  of
  .		     	dependence.    	Algerians  do  not  have  real  control  over  their  m~ans  of  production:
 -				the  most  spectacular  example  of  this  is  given  by  the  Arzew  natural  gas  lique-
			 	fac.tion  complex   	("GNL  [LNG]I     	which  is  in  the  hands  of  the  American  E1  Paso
			 	Company,   	at  a  time  when  SONATR.ACH  is  in  open  conflict  with  that  company  about  the
			 	price  of  gas  it  sells  El  Paso.    	Large  production  units  are  spread  out  all  over
			 	Algeria,   	completely  dependent  on  external  sources  for  their  sugplies,   	still  not
 _		     	having  sufficient  water  resources  at  their  disposal--all  this  is  not  likely  to
 -		     	insure   	industrial  take-off.    	By  increasing  the  number  of  massive  investments,
			 	too  many  Algerians  have  delayed  the  time  when  they  should  be  taking  ~n  the
			 	responsibility  of  making  the  new  means  of  producxion  work.    	This  whole  critical
 =		     	phase  h~zs  ~iven  rise  to  appraisals  being  drawn  up  under  the  responsibility  of
			 	the  new  minister  of  planning,   	appraisals  which  have  not  been  made  public  in

		  	detailed  form.*    	Nevertheless  the  press  has  made  reference  to  cases  of   	factories
		  	working  at  only  10,   	20,   	40  or  50  percent  capacity,   	but  one  cannot  distinguish  be-
		   	tween  cases  of  slow  start-up  and  somewhat  definitive  failures.    	From  this  has
		   	resulted  a  new  industrial  "discourse,"  set  out  particularly  in  the  Algerian  S-year
		   	plan   	(1980-1984);   	priority  is  given  to  finishing  projects  underway,   	to  rigorously
		   	programming  investments,   	to  creating  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  which  will
		   	do   	subcontracting  for  large  national  enterprises,   	to  strengthening  ~he  economic
		   	role  of  the  wilayas,   	and  to  redistribution  benefiting  light  industries  which  are
 -		 	less  capitalistic  and  likely  to  satisfy  im.nediate  needs.
		   	Regarding  hydrocarbons,   	the  debate  has  been  more  confused,   	for  questions  of  per-
		   	sonality  have  been  mixed  into  it.    	The  Abdeslam  and  Ghozali  group   	(Abdeslam  anc~
		   	Ghozali  being  SONATRACH's  first  two  presidents)  has  criticized  the  present  mii.is-
		   	ter  in  writing   	(which  is  a  breach  of  the  code  of  conduct  among  Algerian  leaders):
		   	the  dispute  revolves  mainly  around   	the  price  of  natural  gas  which  at  the  moment
		   	has  not  been  allowing  Algeria  to  derive  a  substantial  income.    	More  generally,   	the
		   	criticism  is  concerned  about  a  certain  amount  of  squandering  of  scarce  natural
		   	resources  which  become  more  valuable  with  the  passage  of  time.    	Would  it  not  be
		   	better  to  conserve  subsoil  resources  longer  rather  than  "squander"  the  dollars
		   	earned   	from  them  in  costly  and  unrealistic  projects?    	zt  is  true  that  the  time
		   	when  Algerian  oil  resources  will  be  exhausted  is  near   	(about  15  years)  and  that
		   	production  has  already  started   	to  decline.    	To  be  sure,   	natural  gas  is  taking
		   	over,  but  its  development   	(on  the  technical  and  co~ercial  leveZ)  has  proved  to  be
		   	much  more  complicated  and  costly  than  anticipated.
		   	La.rge-scale  overexpansion  in  agriculture  has  also  been  condemned.    	Grouping
		   	cogether  22,000  European  farms--which  were  the  most  fertile  land--into  2,000  so-
		   	called  "self-managed"  properties  which  frequently  exceed  1,000  hectares  has
		   	presented  nanagement  problems  which  are  not  yet  resolved.    	So  there  3re  plans  to
		   	reduce   	the  size  of  the  properties  and  to  assist  small  private  farmers,   	particularly
		   	with  credit.    	Since  "industrial"  excess  is  meant  to  disappear,   	establishing
		   	industrial  complexes  on  good  farming  land  is  prohibited  and  the  choice  of  a  site
		   	involves  consent  of   	the  Walis  and  the  municipalities.    	Agricultural  prices  paid  to
		   	producers  and  agricultural  wages  will  be  raised  in  order  to  reduce  the  disparities
 -		 	with  remuneration  in  industry.
		   	One  finds  the  same  sense  of  balance  and  the  happy  medium  in  the  financial  sector:
		   	new  importance  is  accorded  to  balancing  the  big  accounts,   	particularly  to  elim-
		   	inate  any  risk  of  external  pressure.    	Regarding  external  debt,   	the  debt  service
		   	to  export  ratio  rose  to  27  percent  in  1979;   	this  was  considered  excessive  and  led
		   	to  imports  of  heavy  industrial  equipment  being  reduced.    	The  inflow  of  dollars
		   	caused  by  the  doubling  of  oil  prices  since  the  beginning  of  1979  is  improving  the
		   	financial  situation  and  during  the  second  half  of  1980  made  it  possible  to  import
  _		 	massive  amounts  of  everyday  consumer  goods  with  a  view  to  meeting  the  most  pressing
		   	needs.    	Balancing  the  budget  is  also  recognized  as  desirable.    	The  task  of  finan-
  -		 	cial  monitoring  is  being  upgraded;   	a  Revenue  Court  has  been  set  up,  while  the
		   	authority  of  banks,   	which  has  been  weak  up  to  now,   	has  been  increased,   	particularly
		   	in  regard  to  state  enterprises.
		    	?~Only  the  amount  of  what  is  "remaining  to  be  completed"  under  the  heading  of
		    	projects  listed   	in  the  two  preceding  plans  have  been  published.

			  	forced  Ben  Bella's  release  on  his  peers.    	At  the  time  of  the  Ka.byle  unrest   	(spring
 -				1~8Q),   	tt~ere  ~,~as  a  phase  during  which  the  authorities  made  use  of  pro~ocation  and
 -				].ost  control  of  events,   	after  which  moderation  carried  the  day,   	at  least  tempor-
			  	arily.    	Arrests  were  kept  down  and  all  persons  charged  were  set   	free.    	Algeria
			  	without  a  doubt  is  one  of  Africa's  countries  with  the  fewest  political  prisoners.
			  	Finally,  Franco-Algerian  relations  have  been  marked  by  a  desire  for  detente  and
			  	caution.    	The  new  president  gives   	inr_erviews  to  radio  and   	the  French  press.    	A
 ,				serious  crisis  over  immigration  was  averted  tahen  th~e  president  of  the  French
			  	Republic  abandoned  the  idea  o~  forcing  a  sizable  number  o~  Algerians  settled   	in
			  	r"rance  to  speedily  return  to  th2ir  country.    	The  Sahara  and  POLISARICI  are  ceasing
 _				to  be  a  source  of   	serious  tensions  between  the  two  countries,  and  France  is  gradual-
  "				ly  oecoming  genuinely  neutral.
			  	If  style  makes  the  man,   	we  are  beginning  to  know  who  Chadli  Bend,jedid  is:    	he  is  a
 ,				man  who  likes  order,   	he  mistrusts  theoreticiaiis  and  technocrats  cut  off  from  every-
			 	day  realities,   	and  he  detests  "rabble-rousing"   	(such  as  that  evidanced  by  the
  ~				campaign,  a  short-lived   	one  it  is  true,   	against  social  i1Ts);   	he   	is  empirically-
			 	minded  and  desires  to  provide  concrete  solutions  to  the  everyday  problems  of  his
			 	countrymen,   	particularly  by  reducing   	shortages,   	and  housing  and  transportation
			 	difficulties;   	he  is  an  Algerian  con.cerned  about  reconciliation  and  national  unity,
			 	and  he  is  ready  to  com~  to  an  unders;:anding  with  his  enemies,   	domestic  and
			 	foreign,   	out  of  respect  for  stubborn  nationalism.
			 	Not  only  are  L�he  pref erences  of  Algeria's  new  president  well  known  but  also  for
			 	2  years  now  his  powers  have  been  considerably  strengthened.    	He  has  progressively
			 	eliminated  his  principal  adversaries  by  gentle  methods.    	Also,   	in  the  wake  of  the
			 	Kabyle  troubles  the  party's  prerogatives,   	which  had  been  evidence  of  the  presi-
			 	c?ent's   	i_mpor_ence,   	crere  cut  back  to  his  apparent  benefit,   	though  the  president  is
			 	s'_il?  perma~iently  n~onitored  by  his  peers.    	Has  a"Chadl~sm"  been  born  af ter  2
			 	ye~~r s  af  ma.turing,,   	and  is  it  ready  to   	transform  orientations  whicli  are  still
			 	vague  i.nto  clear  policies?
			 	Ti~e  Means  of  Change  Are  Nonexistent
			 	In  ordei-  to  replace  the  "state  capitalism"  set  up  by  Houari  Boumedienne,   	a  new
			 	formu?a  *aould  have  to  en�~erge.    	In  fact,   	neither  the  ideology,   	the  methods  nor  the
			 	personnel  teams  for  its  replacement  exist.    	Perha.ps  President  Chadli  has  opened  up
				a  phase  oi   	transition  to  a  new  regime,   	but  this  phase  has  certainly  not  ended.
		 	,     	First  cf  all  the  new  president  lacks  a  clear  ideology.    	From  this  standpoint,
				Ctiadli  is  not  an  Algerian  Deng  Xiao-Ping.    	All  one  has  to  do  is  run  through
				official  documents  to  observe  nearly  total  continuity.    	Chadli  Bendjedid  could
				have  sifted  through  ihe  legacy  of  his  predecessor,   	considering  that  "Algerian
				socialism"  consisted  of  several  major  orientations:    	harnessing  national  resources
			 	(lan3  and  hydrocarbons),   	keeping  state  control  over  the  tools  necessary  for  rapid
				dev~lo,nlent   	(state  enterprises),   	fixing  priorities  by  means  of  a  medium-term  plan,

		   	illiteracy.    	Other  mechanisms  would  have  been  considered  as  means  or  methods  to
		   	adapt  according  to  circumstances:   	extending  nationalization  of  the  means  of
		   	production  to  the  service  sector  or  to  small  businesses,   	the  degree  to  which  there
		   	is  concentration  in  industry  and  banking,   	a  f ew  state  enterprises  having  a  monopoly
		   	over   	import  rights,  and  fixing  productiox~  prices  in  an  authoritarian  way.    	Unless
		   	these  "gains"  are  questioned,  President  Chadli's  preferences  will  remain  at  the
		   	state  of  wishful  thinking  and  changes  will  remain  marginal.    	Rigid  official  doc-
		   	trines  permanently  limit  his  margin  for  maneuvering.

 ~		  	For  example,   	in  order  to  establish  either   	state  enterprises  or  privat'.e  companies
		   	which  are  either  medium-sized  or  small,   	those  companies  must  not  have  to  wait
 -		  	several  years  to  obtain  equipment  or  necessary  spare  parts  from  state  enterprises
		   	which  have  "overall  import  authorizations"   	at  their  disposal  and  use  them  on  a
		   	priority  basis  for  their  own  needs  and  those  of  other  large  compani~s.    	Neith:r
 -		  	will  there  be  any  diversification  of  the  industrial  netkork  without  far-reaching
		   	modification  of  the  import  system  and  without  changes  in  taxes  and  credits.    	For
		    	the  moment,   	this  mechanism  is  part  of   	the  gains  which  cannot  be  questioned.    	By
		    	the  same  token,   	boosting  a  private  sector  which  would  compete  for  services  assumes
		    	that  the  appropriation  of  ineans  of  production  be  abandoned  for  activities  like  the
		    	hotel  business  which  the  Algerian  Governmen t,   	given  the  current  state  of  its  capa-
 -		  	bilities,   	cannot  adequately  manage.
		    	Most  of  all,   	a  clear  method  for  regulating   	the  economy  should  be  chosen.    	The
		    	situation  is  currently  a  paradoxical  one.    	On  the  one  hand  the  market  does  not
		    	take  responsibility  for  determining  prices  and  general  production  trends.    	On  the
		    	~ther  hand  there  is  no  real  Algerian  "GOSPLAN":    	the  Ministry  of  Planning  is  a  weak
		    	institution  and  its  principal   	interventionary  activity  is  concerned  wlth  invest-
		    	ments.     	The  technical  ministries  and  state  enterprises  have  at  their  disposal  a
 -		  	large  r~argin  of  autonony  for  setting  their  monopoly  prices,   	disregarding  the
		    	requirements  of   	the  coordination  of   	sectors.    	At  this  time,  when  new  production
		    	entities  are  starting  to  supply  the  domestic  market  in  a  meaningful  way,   	the
		    	problem  of  logical  consistency  is  becoming  sharpened.    	Either  Algeria  has  to  pro-
		    	vide  itself  with  a  mandatory  centralized  nlanning  system  which  sets  objectives
		    	and  norms  at  all  stages  of  production  via  sector  ministries,   	or  it  has  to  agree  ~o
		    	let  supply  and  demand  gradually  come  into  play  in  sectors  where  a  certain  amount  of
		    	competition  can  show  up,   	although  it  may  mean  subsidizing  some  basic  products  for
		    	consumer  benefit  such  as  is  done  already.    	Because  of  existing  shortages  and
		    	extensive  hoarding--of  cash--thi~  last  general  policy  could  be  implemented  only
		    	grad.ually.    	An  essential  prerequisite  is  ma ssive  reduction  in  paper  money  in
		    	circulation,  cahatever  way  it  is  done   	(voluntary  conversion  into  savings  at  finan-
		    	cial   	institutions  or  German-stvle  authoritarian  monetary  reform).    	If  ~  choice  is
		    	not  madz,   	the  unofficial  market  will  continue  to  expand  and  will  become  official,
		    	while   	state  enterprises  will  still  be  in   	the  process  of  asking  the  financial
		    	authorities  to  replenish  their  operating  capital  in  the  form  of  appropriate  funds.
		    	Cadres  Are  Lacking
		    	For  this  kind  of  reorientation  there  needs   	to  be  a  homogeneous  team  which  is  not
		    	now  ~he  case.    	Certainly  there  are  some  quite  brilliant  and  competent  politicians

			 	and  were  d~cima*_e~  by  the  colonial  war,    	There  has  been  an  unfilled  void  since  the
			 	removal  of  Belaid  Abdeslam,  whose  arguments  can  be  questioned  but  not  his  intelli-
			 	gence  and  character.    	The  minister  ot  planning,  who  lived   	for  a  long  time  in  the
			 	Jnited   	States,   	is  not  sufficiently  entrenched  politically  to  assert  himself  in  thE
  -		     	areas  ~~f  bath  the.ory  and  organization.    	The  replacement  of  leaders  is  slow  and
			 	difficult;   	the  former  president  had  promoted  technocrats  but  they  have  fallen  back
			  	in  cases  wliere  they  had  not  gained  sufficient  credenti.als  i~z  the  war  of  liberati~n.
			 	The  A;..N   	[National  Liberation  Army]   	has  already  supplied  Algeria  with  many  of   	its
  '		     	cadres  and  it  is  not  in  a  position  to  flood  the  country  with  leaders  of  a  high
			  	stars~lard.    	Cadres  with  influence  benefit  from  income  due  to  their  status  even  when
			  	the;�  are  recognized  by  everyone  as  incompetent.*    	To  be  sure,  ministers  or  leading
			  	figures  in  state  enterprises  are  replaced  from  time  to  time,   	but  those  actions  re-
			 	main  limited.    	In  a  context  such  as  this  one  the  Boumedienne  system,  which  is  sup-
			  	portpd  by  only  a:ninority  but  has  to  its  credit  the  fact  that  it  is  established,
			  	shows  itselL  to  be  relatively  secure.    	Many  Algerians,   	having  seen  their  country
			 	narrowly  escape  chaos  in  the  period  which  followed  independence,   	fear  change,
			 	whatever  change  it  may  be.    	They  are  fearful  of  the  disorder  which  would  be  caused
			 	during  an  initial  period  by  reforms  and   	sudden  changes  of  officials,   	disorder  which
  -		     	would  be  difficult  to  avoid  in  a  c~untry  in  which  family,   	regional  and  political
			  	cZans  are  powerful.    	Finally,   	the  president  and  his  government  are  not  protected
			  	from  politicai  reactions  by  the  late  president`s  supporters.    	An  excessively  pro-
			 	nounced  opening  up  would  be  interpreted  as  a"Sadatization"  of  the  economy,   	and
			  	rapprochement  with  Egypt  by  a  member  of  the  "Rejection  Front"  seems  difficult  to
			  	conceive  of  in  the  short  term.    	The  behavior  of  Algerian  leaders  and  cadres  is
			  	characterized  by  great  caution,   	and  a  wait-and-see  attitu3e  prevails  over  the
			  	spirit  of   	initiative.
  -		     	Therefore,   	for  2  years  many  steps  which  have  been  taken  are  negative,   	symbolic  or
			  	limited  in  character.    	The  large  industrial  projects  have  been  checked  and  even
  '				called  into  question   	(the  third  Arzew  liquefaction  plant,   	for  example)  but  no  small
			  	a..d  medium-scale  industrial  policy  has  begun.    	The  breaking  up  of  SONATRACH  into
			  	sever~l  autonomous  companies  was  ~nnounced  at  the  beginning  of  1980,   	yet  there  is
			  	S~LJ~.  Ollly  a   	single  SONATRACH  in  existence.    	The  marketing  of  agricultural  products
			  	has   	beer  made  more  flexible,   	since  self-managed  areas  can  sell  directly  in  the  mar-
			  	ket,   	b:~�   	tlie  restructuri.ng  of  enterprises  has  not  started.    	Although  a  600-page
			  	document  called  "Draft   	1980-1984  Plan"  was  debated  by  2,000  representatives  at  a
			  	conference,   	specific  choices  were  avoided,  whether  they  had  to  do  with  sr.ructural
			  	reforms  or  large  projects.    	Algeria`s  march  towards  development  was  slowed  rather
			  	than  its  direction  shifted.    	Strict  regulations  which  are  still  in  place  are  being
			  	bei~t.    	Thus,   	every  year  a  million  Algerians  are  able  to  bring  back  in  accompanying
			  	ba~gage  from  France  several  billions  worth  of  goods  not  recorded  at  customs,   	good~

			  	[Article  by  Hazhir  Teimourian]
			   	[TextJ    	Iranians  living  in  Britain  last  night  circulated  what  was  described  as
    	-		    	an  appeal  by  Mr  Abolhasan  Bani-Sadr,   	the  deposed  president,   	calling  on  the
			  	people  of  Iran  to  resis t  tyranny.    	This  is  the  first  reported  statement  f rom
			  	rir  Bani-Sadr  since  he  was  last  seen  on  June  12,    	He  is  in  hiding.
			  	In  separate  messages   	to  the  people  and  to  the  armed  forces  of  Iran,  Mr  Bani-Sadr
			  	said  he  did  not  recognize  the  legality  of  his  deposition.
			  	"You  must   	continue  to  resist  the  imposition  of  any  tyranny  on  you,  whether  it

			  	gain  faith  in  themselves  and  in  a  better,   	more  progressive  future,"  he  was
			  	quoted  as  saying.
			  	Ttiz  appeals  were  circulated  in  the  form  of  a  dupl3cated  document  bearing  the
			  	title  Islamic  revolution,   	that  of  Mr  Bani-Sadr's  recently-banned  newspaper.
			  	E~;le  so~.irces  said  the  statements  were  telephoned  abroad  on  Wednesday  from
			  	scr,iewh,-re  in  Iran.
			  	The  Iranian  authorities  have  said  the  former  president  was  still  in  th e  country
			  	and  orders  were  given  to  the  people  to  arrest  him  on  sight.    	There  has  been
			  	speculation  that  he  had  fled  to  Egypt.

		   	urged   	them  to   	fight  on  until  final  victory  over  Iraq  was  achieved,   	saying  that
		   	in  the  present  critical  situation  that  Iran  faced  his  own  predicament  was
		   	i~naterial.    	It  was  of  vital  importance  that  the  armed  forces  should  prevent
		   	outside   	factors  from  weakening  their  morale,   	or  traitorous  hands  stabbing  them
		   	:r.  t'ye  ba~~k.
		   	He  u~f~nded  his  role  as   	the  fcrmer  commander-in-chief  of  the  armed  forces,   	saying
		   	tha~  h~  had  quadrupled  their  efficiency  from  the  dark  days  at  the  start  of  the
 -		  	caar  with  Iraq,   	not  through  interference  in  mi19_tary  matters  or  oratory,  but
		   	through  the  encouragement  of  talent  ar.d  the  delegation  of  responsibility.
		   	"4r  Eani-Sadr  said  many  commanders   	frequently  complained  to  him  of  interferenc-~
		   	by  leaders  of   	the  IRP.    	He  quoted  a  grandson  of  Ayatollah  Khomeyni  saying  that
		   	the  IP.P  pref erred  the  loss   	to   	Iraq  of  the  southern  oil  province�of  Khuzistan
		    	to  ~he  consolidation  of  his   	(Mr  Bani-Sadr's)  political  position  through  victory
		   	in  ti~e  war.
		   	rir  Ba>;i-Sadr  also  told  the  armed  forces  of  his  faith  in  Islam  and  in  the  Iranian
		   	n~~t:~~~  ;   	saying  that  his   	Islam  was  not  a  reli~ion  of  hatred,   	revenge  and
		   	inferiority  complexes,   	as  was  that  ~f  "the  plotters  that  deposed  me,"  but  a
		   	religion  of   	lovQ  and  freedom,   	growth  and  initiative.
		   	In  his  message  to  the  "men  and  women  of  Iran,"  Mr  Bani-Sadr  particularly  praised
		   	the  resistance  of  his  women  supporters  in  the  face  of  intimidation  by  "the  club-
		   	tvielding  rabble,"  indicating  that   	the  women  of  Iran  had  appreciated  his  efforts
		    	to  gain  their  liberation.    	He  also  expressed  his  hope  in  the  young  people  of
		    	Iran.
		   	The  }*oung,   	he  said,   	could  not  grow  and  fulfil  themselves  in  a  country  that  lacked
		    	freedom,   	but   	until  they  rose  to  free  themselves,   	"general  insecu~ity  and  civil
		   	war,   	repression  and  economic  stagnation  will  continue."
		   	The  deposed  president  ended  his  message:    	"I  have  put  my  hope  in  you,   	the  young
		   	generation  of   	Iran.    	You  and  I  have  entered  into  a  pact  together,   	a  pact  of
		    	solidarity,   	a  pact  of  resistance.    	The  time  has  come  to  be  true  to  our  promise."

			 	Paris  AL-wt~,TAN  AL-'ARABI  in  Arabic  15-21,  22-28  May,   	29  May-4  Jun
			  	/Article  by  Fu'ad  Abu  Mansur:    	"AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI  Opens  the  File  on  Moroccan
			 	Democracy"/
			  	/15-21  May  81  pp  37,   	38/
			  	/Text/  The  main  characteristic  of  Moroccan  political  life  is  its  pluralism.    	This
  -		     	is  cLearly  obvious  from  the  titles  of  the  damestic  newspapers  and  publications
  -		     	that  proliferate  in  vendors'   	kioaks  in  Raba~  and  Casablanca  and  in  the  hands  of  the
 '		     	youths  who  circulate  in  front  of  cafes  and  bars  or  line  up  at  corners  and  before
			  	traffic  lights.
			  	A  mere  quick  glance  at  these  newsgapers  will  underline  the  different  positions  of
			  	various  groups  in  the  Moroccan  family,   	showing  that  the  options  of  the  right,
			  	center  and  le�t  are  sametimes  compatible,   	sometimes  discordant,  and  that  the  parli.a-
  -				mentary  game  3s  based  on  democratic  rules:    	the  majorit,y  makes  the  decisions  and
			  	the  opposition  exercises  the  veto  or  the  right  of  refusal.    	The  decisive  say  ul-
			  	tirtiately  rests  with  the  majority,   	as  is  the  case  in  deeper-rooted,   	older  democratic
			  	trsditions.
			  	Duri,ng  ~y  recent  stay  in  Morocco,   	I  met  with  party  heads  and  organization  secre-
			  	taries.    	I  also  attended  meetin~s  in  the  Istiqlal  and  Federal  Party  members'   	cells.
			  	I  visix~d  the  hames  of  popular  officials  and  main  branches.    	I  talked  with  the
			  	editorial  boards  of  the  Arabic  and  French  language  party  press.    	One  product  of
			  	this   	trip  through  the  "machinery  of  the  Moroccan  party  experiment"  was  Chat  I  ended
			  	up  with  a  group  of  facts,  most  ~mmpnrtant  of  which  are:
			  	1.    	The  majority  of  the  Moroccan  people,  especially  the  young  generation  born  in
			  	the  iifties,  has  been  100  percent  trained  in  parties  and  politically  educated  in
			  	ideological  and  union  terms  in  the  cities  and  heavy  popula~ion  areas,  but  this  de-
  -				clines  or  pales  in  the  rural  and  desert  areas  where  the  middle  aged  and  the  elderly
			  	provide  the  family  or  tribal  options,   	in  addition  to  other  considerations.
			  	2.    	Each  of  the  five  major  parties  has  a  basic  traditional  body  of  people  on  which
			  	it  r2lies  in  the  framework  of  political  activity  and  mobilization.    	The  Istiqlal
			  	Party  relies  on  bourgeois  personnel,  particularly  the  petty  bourgeois,  who  embrace
			   	the  orir~~iple  of  equaliCy.    	The  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers  is  active
			  	in  young  and  intellectual  circles  and  stresses  trade  union  activity  as  a  means  for

		  	changing  social  stru~tures.    	The  National  Liberal  Grouping  attracts  persons  from
		  	the  far  right  and  the  far  left  who  have  came  to  feel  despair  over  traditional  con-
		  	cepts  in  political  and  party  areas.    	Then  there  is  a  constitutional  monarcliist
		  	party  under  the  leadership  of  Ahmed  Osman,  who  for  7  years  played  the  part  of  prime
		  	minister  in  the  caSinet  which  preceded  the  current  one  of  Maati  Bouabid.    	The  Popu-
		   	lar  Movement  led  by  Mahdjoubi  Ahradane  is  strong  in  desert  areas  and  is  actively
		   	training  Berbers,   	stressing  the  values  of  Moroccan  cultural  integrity,   	especially
		   	Berber  integrity,  by  promoring  the  Amizigh  language  of  the  Amizigh  peoples  wha  are
		   	spread  about  in  the  Greater  Atl~s  areas.    	The  Moroccan  Conmiunist  Party,  known  as
		   	the  Party  of  Progress  and  Socialism,  under  the  leadership  of  AZi  E1  Yaata,  is  active
		   	in  workers'   	cells  and  industrial  concentrations,   	especially  in  Casablanca;   	it  issues
		   	its  newspaper  AL-BAYAN  in  Arabic  and  French.
		   	3.    	The  proliferation  of  parties,  with  their  diverse  methods  of  fighting  and  their
		   	diverse  concapts  and  demands,   	function  within  lines  already  laid  out  in  the  contexC
		   	of  the  country's  basic  options.    	There  is  a  matter  which  is  taken  for  granCed,  or  a
		   	fixed  element,   	in  Moroccan  politics  which  unites  people  on  the  right  and  the  left.
		   	This  is  the  democratic  constitutional  monarchy,  which  Moroccans  are  united  in  be-
		   	lieving  is  the  safety  valve,   	the  moral  and  material  framework  of  the  Moroccan
		   	identity,   	and  the  benevolent  rule  which  supervises  the  progress  of  the  political
		   	game  and  limits  the  fouls  on  the  political  playing  field.    	Opposition  radicals
		   	acknowledge  that  the  ~Cfng  always  tries  to  anticipate  their  criticisms  and  their
 _		  	reservations  and  that  in  a  meeting  he  even  laid  stress  on  the  need  Co  improve  the
		   	workers'   	standard  of  living,   	and  went  farther  than  the  opposition  in  his  emphasis.
		    	4.    	Another  fixed  or  obvious  point  is  the  unity  of  Moroccan  territory  and  the  just
		    	nature  of  the  defense  of  the  Western  Sahara.    	This  is  a  common  denominator  and  does
		    	not  admit  of  individual  interpretation  or  debate  among  the  20  million  Moroccans.
		    	The  parties  are  united�in  believing  that  the  Sahara  war  is  a  facricated  issue  manu-
		    	factured  by  Algeria  to  sap  Morocco's  vigor  and  shake  the  throne  and  that  the  Moroc-
		    	cans  are  prepared  to  negotiate  directly  with  the  Algerian  regime  to  set  out  Che
		    	bases  for  a  solution  and  proceed  taward  a  forthcaming  union  of  the  Maghreb  countries
		    	in  which  each  country  will  preserve  its  special  economic  and  cultural  characteristics.
		    	5.    	Do  these  basic  options  limit  the  mavement  of  Moroccan  parties?    	What  are  they
		    	left  with  within  these  lines?    	The  party  officials  I  met  stressed  that  the  option
		    	of  the  war  in  the  Sahara  is  a  specific  decision  which  all  Moroccans  have  agrPed
		    	upon.    	This  unanimity  does  not  diminish  the  iu~ortance  of  party  life  as  a  motive
		    	force  for  individual  and  group  po~wers  and  a  criterion  for  campetition  within  the
		    	quest  for  betCer  conditions.    	They  also  emphasized  party  contributions  since  in-
		    	dependence  in  the  realm  of  the  establishment  of  modern  structures  for  Morocco,   	the
		    	provision  of  public  facil{ties  and  the  choice  of  agricultural  and  industrial  pol-
		     	icies.
		     	6.    	Here  the  margin  in  which  the  Moroccan  parties  function  possesses  a  quixotic
		     	character.    	The  media  war  flares  only  on  the  pages  of  newspapers  and  stays  within
		     	the  limits  of  censure,  keeping  organizations  away  from  the  experience  of  "lebani-
		     	zation"  or  the  language  of  blood  in  the  absence  of  diplomacy.    	Everyone  is  a  mon-
		     	archist  and  there  are  none  of  the  Trojan  horses  of  foreign  systems.    	Even  the
		     	newspaper  profession  reflects  the  childish  quality  of  the  first  beginnings  of  the

			 	certain  loyal  parties  received  a  weight  out  of  proportion  to  their  real  strength~
 _				The  criticism  remained  within  the  context  of  the  media  and  did  not  get  tn  the  pvint
			 	of  the  withdrawal  of  opposition  deputies  from  parliament.    	Today  news  is  circulat-
			 	ing  to  the  effect  that  the  federalist  deputies  are  proposing  to  withdraw  fram  the
			 	discussion  again  in  the  event  the  parliamentary  period  extexids  to  next  summer.
			 	However,   	an  infQrmed  federalist  source  told  AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI  that  the  subje~t  of
			 	withdrawal  is  being  carefully  discussed  in  parry  circles  and  has  not  been  resolved
			 	in  a  final  fashion.
			 	5.    	Isic/  The  phenomena  which  merit  attention  are  the  �laxeups  within  the  tradition-
 -				al  Moroccan  parties.    	Schisms  have  afflicted  party  life  since  1956.    	In  1959,   	the
			 	Istiqlal  Yarty,  which  represents  a  patriotic  legacy  of  struggle,  split  apart,  and
 -				the  Nati~nal  Federation  of  Popular  Forces  and  the  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular
			 	Farces  branched  out  from  it,   	the  former  under  the  leadership  of  the  father  of  the
			 	Moroccan  left,  Abdallah  Ibrahim,   	and  the  latter  un,der  the  leadership  of  Abdel
			 	Rahim  Bouabid.    	In  1978,  we  witnegsed  the  birth  of  the  National  Liberal  Grouping
			 	under  the  leadership  of  Ahmed  Osman,  who,   	in  turn,  had  fought  in  the  ranks  of  the
			 	Istiqlal  Party  like  many  of  the  technocrats  on  the  Moroccan  stage.    	Today  there  is
			 	a  parlimentary  rift  in  the  National  Liberal  Grouping  under  the  leadership  of  the
			 	deputy  Ahmed  Belhadj.    	However,   	this  secessionist  group  has  not  yet  conceived  a
			 	mature  political  program  or  declared  its  ob~ectives.
			 	In  any  event,   	the  outbursts  in  the  Moroccan  parties  are  not  a  sudden  occurrence.
			 	Observers  emphasize  tlhat  Chey  are  a  burdensome  legacy  that  has  been  with  Che
			 	nationalist  paxties  since  the  dawn  of  independence.    	The  late  Allal  E1  Fasi,   	the
			 	first  man  of  the  Istiqlal  Party,  warned  of  this  phenomenon  in  his  book  "Se~f
			 	Criticism~"    	It  is  obvious  that  party  rifts  are  not  a  Moroccan  characteristic  but
			 	a~~�t)dwide  one.    	Gaullism  has  become  "Gaullisms,"  Marxism  "Marxisms"  and  Ma.oism
			 	"Maoi.sms:'    	It  is  the  struggle  of  ideas  which  is  fragznenting  the  traditional  struc-
			 	tures.    	The  firsC  rift  in  the  Moroccan  national  movement  occurred  when  Mohamed
			 	Hassan  E1  Quazzani  was  compelled  to  establish  the  National  Party,   	introducing  into
			 	party  Iife  a  spirit  of  religious  fanaticism  and  chauvinism--two  manifestaCions  of
			 	tactics  of  "slander  and  reproach"  which  party  people  refer  to  when  Chey  talk  abou~
			 	organizations  that  star~d  in  their  way.
 -				i~uroccan  party  figures  arQ  united  over  the  fact  Chat  King  Mohamed  the  Fifth  was  tl?e
			 	father  of  Moroccan  democracy.    	He  fflrmcd  the  first  coalition  government  in  the  his-

			 	gave  on  the  eve  of  20  August  1956.    	To  satisfy  the  criticism,  Mohamed  the  Fi�th

			 	Istiqlal  Party,   	on  27  October  of  the  same  year.    	In  the  meanwhile,   	trade  union

		    	taks  final  form  until  6  December  1959  and  that  was  the  basic  turning  point  in  the
		    	course  of  rto~occan  parties.
		    	The  main  split  created  secondary  ones,   	including  the  Moroccan  Federation  of  Labor,
		     	the  National  Federation  of  Moroccan  Students,   	the  General  Federation  of  Workers  as
		    	a  rival  of  the  Moroccan  Federation  of  Labor,   	and  the  Generai  Federation  of  Moroccan
		     	StudenCs  as  a  rival  of  the  National  Fed~ration  of  Students.    	In  this  period,   	that
		     	is,   	on  the  eve  of  the  sixties,  par*yo  urientations  defined  themselves  in  the  wake
		     	of  the  radical  dispute  between  M'Hamed  Douri,   	the  current  minister  of  equipment
		     	(who  at  that  time  was  minister  of  econamy)   	an~d  Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid,  naw  the  first
		     	secretary  of  the  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers.
		     	In  this  historical  context,   	there  were  three  force~  of  attraction,  and  these  re-
		     	sulted  in  the  emergence  of  the  National  Federation  of  Popular  Powers,   	the  loyal
		     	son  of  the  Istiqlal  Party  and  thQ  Ss~cialist  Federati~n  of  Popular  Pawers.    	Abdel
		     	Rahim  Bouabid  stated  that  the  change  or  alteration  in  the  title  was  simed  at  avaid-
		     	ing  the  confusion  which  old  party  members  of  the  National  Federation  exploited  in
  .		   	Casablanca,  retaining  this  title  though  they  did  not  by  any  atretch  of  the  imagina-
		     	tion  reflect  its  essence.
		     	Mehdi  Ben  Barka  paused  at  length  in  his  "Book  on  the  Revolutionary  Choice"  to  dis-
		     	cuss  the  reasons  for  party  fragmeatation,   	considering  it  tantaIIwunt  to  a  histor9.c
		     	error.    	He  said:    	"There  are  three  errors:
		     	"1.    	Our  incorrect  evaluation  of  the  half  ineasures  we  were  compelled  to  adopt.
		     	"2.    	The  closed  framework  through  which  our  struggles  passed  without  the  parCici-
		     	pation  of  the  masses  of  the  people.
		     	"3.    	~'he  obscurity  surrounding  our  ideological  positions."
		     	Political  and  ideological  pluralism  began  a  new  stage,.proceeding  fram  diverse
		     	notions  of  national  activity.    	Public  fre-Edolna  were  not  a  gift  "from  above"  to
		     	people  active  i~  the  press  and  in  ideas.    	When  the  National  Federation  of  Popular
		     	Powers  was  given  responsibility  for  the  cabinet  along  with  Abdallah  Ibrahim,   	a
		     	wave  of  arrests  took  place  which  extended  to  Mohamed  E1  Basri  aixl  Abdel  Rahman  E1
		     	Youssofi,   	two  prominent  figures  in  the  National  Federation.    	By  the  time  Morocco
				was  taken  with  shock  at  the  death  of  Mohamed  the  Fifth,   	the  option  of  public  free-
				doms  had  became  strongly  rooted  in  people's  spirits  and  had  become  a  demand  equal-
				ling  those  of  bread  and  a  decent  living  in  importance.
				When  Hassan  the  Second  inaugurated  the  first  session  o�  the  first  elected  parlia-
				ment  in  the  history  of  Morocco,  he  insisted  on  the  need  to  "pursue  the  democratic
				course  to  its  natural  ends."    	He  said,  "We  have  refused  to  do  anything  except  to
				relinquish  a11  tasks  of  our  own  accord  and  free  will,  restricting  ourselves  to  the
				areas  of  competence  exercised  by  heads  of  atates  in  democratic  countries."
				Party  pluralism  became  more  firmly  imrplanted  in  the  second  parliamentary  experience
				of  July  1970.    	On  22  July  of  thaC  year,   	the  Istiqlal  Party  and  the  National  Federa-

			  	and  helped  direct  attention  to  the  pitfalls  of  ignoring  defects  in  the  administra-
			  	tive  superstructure.    	The  Moroccan  ruler  put  his  hand  on  the  defects  and  held  in-
			  	tensified  contacts  with  the  parties  on  the  eve  of  Ahmed  Osman's  assumption  of  rhe
			  	Moroccan  preniership  on  19  November  1973,   	stressing  the  need  to  build  a  democratic
			  	Morocco  which  would  rely  on  a  government  instrument  helping  to  promote  the  course
			  	of  construction  and  growth.    	The  party  heads  responded  to  the  royal  appeal  in  let-
			   	ter.a  in  which  they  replied  by  setting  out  their  notions  of  the  creation  of  a  Moroc-
			  	co  whl.ch  was  able  to  respond  to  the  challenges  of  the  age.    	The  answers  came  from
			  	Allal  E1  Fassi  for  the  Istiqlal  Party,  Abdallah  Ibrahim  for  the  National  Federation
			   	of  Popular  Powers,  Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid  for  the  Sociali.st  Federation  of  Popular

			   	for  the  Democratic  Constitution  Party,  and  Ali  E1  Yatt~  for  the  Party  of  Progress
			  	and  Socialiam.
			  	The  rayal  missive  and  the  parties'   	responses  to  it  were  basically  oriented   	toward
			   	the  process  of  "deepening"  Moroccan  democracy  and  findi.ng  a  way  to  avoid  the  in-
			   	eptitude  of  forn?er  ruling  officials.    	It  was  given  to  everyone  to  believe  that  no
			  	party  had  a  monopoly  on  the  right  to  speak  in  Che  name  of  the  people  but  that  all
			   	conceptions,   	in  spite  of   	their  different  tendencies  and  notions,   	had  to  be  an  em-
  _			 	bodiment  of  collective  concerns.    	Mr  Ahmed  Osman  strove  to  make  this  slogan  reali[y
  -			 	when  he  assimilated  a  large  number  of  opposition  members  into  the  corps  of  employees
			   	cooperaCing  with  him.    	He  worked  tirelessly  over  a  pair  of  reforms  in  the  7  years
			   	in  which  he  headed  up  the  Moroccan  cabinet:    	the  selection  of  competent  personnel
 -			 	and  the  modernization  of  staffs  and  structures  to  accommodate  the  new  economic  and
			   	cultural  developments.
			   	This  }~ard   	time  in  the  life  of  the  Moroccan  parties  passed,   	regardless  o�  their  in-
  -			 	ternal  contradictions,   	thanks  to  the  royal  safety  valve.    	The  political  shocks  in
			   	the  modern  history  of  Morocco  were  of  such  force  that  they  created  profound  up-
			   	heavals  in  party  structures  and  in  addition  there  were  errors,   	special  calculations
			   	and  debts  on  the  part  of  specific  persons.    	Today,   	each  of  the  main  parties  bears  a
			   	legacy  uf  accomplishments  and  frustrations,  but  the  dynamic  of  renewal  has  brought
			   	figures  and  leaders   	to  the  fore  who  are  up  to  the  current  challenges.
			   	Here  the  Istiqlal  Party  is  gambling  on  retaining  its  basic  features,   	benefitting
			   	from  its  former  brilliance  in  attracting  new  staffs,  while  its  adversaries  continue
			   	to  describe  it  as  "the  sincere  guardian  of  bourgeois  interests,"  criticising  it  for
			   	a  sort  of  stagnatfon  of  leaders  and  directives.    	They  also  observe  that  its  popu-
			   	larity  has  not  diminished  with  time,   	since  Chere  are  broad  groups  of  Moroccans  who
  -			 	aspire  to  reap  the  fruits  of  private  ownership  and  personal  wealth.    	However,   	in
			   	the  minds  of  citizens,   	the  Istiqlal  Party  remains  a  kind  of  Moroccan  "Gaullism,"

 _		  	kept  the  party's  name  after  the  c~llective  fragmenration  which  beset  it  on  the  eve
		    	of  the  eighties.
		    	The  Party  of  Progresa  and  Socialism  branched  off  from  the  French  Co~rtuniat  Party
		    	in  the  days  of  the  protectorate.    	Its  opponenta  accuse  it  of  keeping  an  open  line
		    	to  Moscow,  which  is  important  since  Moroccans  are  concerned  with  there  religious
		    	values  and  do  not  accept  Cammunism  as  a  political  sysCem.    	The  popularity  of  this
		    	party  decli.ned  after  the  defeats  of  world  communism,   	the  termination  of  the  "red
		    	tyranny"  in  Moscow  and  the  death  of   	'Abd-al-Nasir.    	However,  Ali  E1  Yatta,   	in  his
		    	remarks  and  statements,   	emphasizes  the  "national  character"  of  his  party  and  is
		    	close  to  the  principles  and  goals  of  the  National  FederaCion  of  Popular  Powers.    	He
		    	also  relies  on  labor  and  women's  organizations  in  pramoting  the  class  struggle  in
		    	Morocco.
		    	While  the  popular  movement  manag~d  to  form  a  party  reserve  for  the  Istiqlal  Party,
 _		   	especially  since  its  activists  had  fought  for  independence  and  were  a  model  for
 _		   	Moroccan  citizens  who  were  in  touch  with  their  country  and  its  actual  situation,

 -		   	its  adversaries  rebuked  it  for  having  a  racist  character  that  made  it  a  trump  card
		    	in  many  people's  hands.    	Proof  of  that,   	those  opposed  to  it  say,   	is  the  fact  that
		    	its  notions  disappointed  a  large  group  of  its  adherents,  who  split  off  from  it  and
		    	formed  other  parties,   	including:
		    	E1  Khatib  and  E1  Oukouti,  who  formed  the  Popular  Constitutional  MovemenC.

		    	As  regards  the  National  Liberal  Grouping,  which  is  relatively  new,   	since  it  was
		     	founded  in  1978,   	its  opponents  criticise  it  f~r  "being  in  debt  to  the  administra-

		     	far  as  to  describe  it  as  "an  artificial  current  which  represents  a  mixture  of  in-
		     	terests."    	Naturally  liberal  officials  reject  these  charges,   	saying  "No  onp  is  able
		     	to  monopolize  political  action  and  we  came  onto  the  political  stage  to  fill  a  void
		     	that  citizens  were  starting  to  grumble  about."

		     	in  an  attempt  to  determine  each  party's  position  and  present  its  acccn~lishments  in

			 	appointed  ambassador  to  Bonn  and  Washington,   	respectively.
			 	Tod.ay  Ahmed  Osman  is  free  to  devote  his  �ull  time  to  Grouping  affaira,   	atrivinK  to
			  	~stabli~i3  ~ts  positions  on  the  Moroccan  stage  in  the  framework  of  the  democratic
			 	experiment  and  its  concomitant  democratic  features.    	This  discussion  wfth  him  was
			  	aimed  at  ascertaining  the  Liberals'  place  on  the  Moroccan  political  map  and  becam-
			  	ing  acquainted  with  the  game  of  majority  and  opposition  in  the  structure  of  existing
			  	institutions  and  the  context  of  aituations  caming  to  the  fore  on  the  Arab  and
			  	foreign  planes.
			  	/4uestion/  Members  of  the  Is~iqlal  and  federalists  say  that  the  Liberal  Grouping
			  	arose  suddenly  without  prepar,3tory  arrangements  and  that  it  is  a  result  of  the
			  	Iatest  election  campaign.    	How  do  you  view  this  assessment?
			  	/Answer/  I  described  this  point  a  faw  days  ago  in  my  meetings  with  the  activists  in
			  	the  Grouping  and  at  the  massive  rally  we  held  in  the  town  of  Oujda.    	We  believe  in
			  	party  pluralism  whiie  not  seeking  to  balkanize  political  life  in  Morocco.    	The  other
			  	parties  must  agree  to  enter  or  leave  the  new  movement  without  wishing  to  monopolize
			  	political  action  in  any  of  the  stages  of  the  national  forward  march.    	The  game  of
			  	democracy  requires  the  involvement  of  a  number  of  partie~  possessing  different  vis-
			  	ions  an~d  conceptions.
			  	To  state  that  the  Liberal  Grouping  was  the  result  of  the  latest  elections  is  not
			  	in  keeping  with  reality.    	Haw  can  a  diaciplined  political  mavemeat  like  the  Liberal
			  	Grouping  possess  the  wherewithal  of  power  and  legitimacy  to  came  into  being  over-
			  	night?
			  	When  we  examine  the  political  terrain  in  Morocco,  we  observe  that  the  traditional
			  	political  parties,   	that  is,   	the  parties  founded  for  the  sake  of  regaining  natianal
			  	in~dependence,   	have  not  kept  abreast  of  developments  in  domestic  and  international
			  	life.    	The  leaders  have  not  changed.    	We  observe  the  same  people  remaining  in  pol-
			  	icy  positions.    	This  does  not  mean  that  we  do  not  feel  appreciation  for  these  lead-
			  	~rs.    	I  have  been  and  still  am  engaged  in  d{ecussions  with  them  and  am  a  friend  of
			  	thei~s.    	Therefore  I  believe  I  can  speak  without  embarrassment.
			  	In  our  new  activity  we  felt,   	since  the  seventies,   	that  it  was  necessary  to  estab-
			  	lish  a  new  po]itical  current  to  fill  a  kind  of  vacuum  resulting  fram  lapses  in  the
			  	modernization  process.    	We  present  ourselves  as  standin~  in  the  line  of  auccession
			  	of  the  National  Movement,  whose  combative  past  we  do  not  deny,   	although  we  are  try-
			  	ing  to  inject  new  blood  into  it  by  bringing  in  new  persons  and  styles  and  adjusting
			  	r.4  the  requirements  of  the  current  situation  and  the  challenges  that  have  accumu-
			  	l.ated.
 �			 	In  another  area,   	there  is  apathy  in  local  political  life.    	We  are  striving  to  im-,
			  	plant  the  dynamism  of  new  activity  in  its  place.    	It  would  have  been  easy  to  give
			  	birth  to  our  movement  before  the  elections  when  we  were  in  posirions  of  responsi-
			  	bility  and  were  a~ole  to  monopolize  political  decisions.    	However,  we  preferred  to
			  	make  a  ~umprehen:,ive  opening  and  mobilization  and  appealed  to  the  cther  parties  to
			  	engage  in  a  modern  damocratic  life  which  was  in  keeping  with  the  disturbed  atmos-

		    	on  our  part.    	Therefore  we  came  into  being  and  entered  the  1976  local  elections,   	in

		    	that  this  imposes  growing  rifts  on  it$  ranks.    	They  ciCe  the  "shock"  receatly

		    	leadership  of  Mohamed  Belhadj,  who  is  intending  to  crystallize  a  new  plan  of  action.
		     	/Answer/  The  fact  that  there  are  rifts  does  not  mean  that  the  movement  does  not  have
		    	a  program.    	Programs  are  easy  to  set  down.    	I  appeal  to  all  to  read  the  statements
		    	and  speeches  closely.    	They  are  devoid  of  the  stirring  promises  ~rhich  are  frequent-
		     	ly  repeated  in  the  marketplace  to  attracting  followers  but  generally  remain  mere
		     	ink  on  paper.    	We  have  a  program  which  is  characterized  by  realism,   	transcending
		     	slogans  and  aiming  at  the  execution  of  programs.    	We  came  into  being  with  a  reserve
		     	of  accomplishments  and  we  are  continuing  along  this  courae  within  an  equation  which
		    	matches  words  with  deeds.
		     	/guestion/  Could  we  have  same  examples?								  	~
		     	/Answer/  We  have  been  in  the  cabinet.    	I  personally  held  the  position  of  premier
		     	for  a  period  of  l  years   	(1973-79).    	We  have  accamplished  tangible  things.    	Our

		     	stead  of  a  background  of  slogans  or  aspirations.    	The  fact  that  there  are  rifts  does

				this  characterization  correct?
				/Answer/  This  is  a  characterization  which  has  no  basis  in  fact.    	We  have  gone

				numerous  occasions  that  we  are  not  a  party  which  was  essentially  founded  to  win

			 	Moroccan  pali~ical  soil.    	We  hope  that  otheLS will  recognize  our  capital.    	We  appeal
			 	to  them  ta  take  a  more  sporting  attitude  in  dealing  with  us  and  looking  upon  ~~s.
			 	/Question/  The  economic  philosophy  of  the  Liberal  Grouping  is  based  on  capitalisr
			 	liberalism.    	non't  you  believe  that  there  are  poor  classes  in  Morocco  which  vie~~   	i_1~~,s
			 	philosophy  with  a  kind  of  suspicion  and  rebel  against  its  economic  and  social  p1~e?~:-
			 	ises?
			  	/Answer/  We  believe  in  giving  the  individual  absolute  freedom  and  in  givin~  free
			  	rein  to  individual  initiative  as  an  element  of  social  liberalism  noi~  capitalist
			  	liberalism.    	We  also  put  priority  on  training  individuals  and  groups,   	overseeing
			  	government  activity  and  holding  official.s  to  account.    	The  government  plays  a  basic
			  	role  in  the  life  of  the  individual  an~i  the  group;  we  are  not  against  that.    	We  nre
			  	liberals  who  set  forth  from  the  premise  of  our  equation,  which  holds  that  the  in-
			  	dividual  must  work,  be  active  and  move  as  a  part  of  and  on  behalf  of  the  group.
			  	/Question/  Don't  you  therefore  adhere  to  the  class  struggle?    	There  are  distinctive
 _				sociai  class~s  in  Morocco  which  have  special  distinguishing  features.    	We  observe
			  	that  acting  to  fill  the  gap  moves   	the  young  generation  in  particular  and  results  in
 -				attracting  rich,  poor,   	affluent  and  needy  people.    	Aren't  you  neglecting  this  basic
			  	struggle  a  littl~?
			  	/Answer/  We  do  not  talk  about  class  struggle  because  we  do  not  want  to  apply  foreign
 -				philosophies  or  imported  ideologies.    	Class  struggle  is  a  Marxist  notion  which  we
 -			 	reject.    	Conversely,  we  are  aware  that  there  are  social  differences  in  Morocco,   	as
			  	in  other  countries  of  the  world.    	We  fi~Zht  them  with  all  our  strength  and  devote  an

			  	r^.^t  ttae~  interests  o�  specific  groups  in  Moroccan  society?
			  	/Answer/  Not  at  all.    	Our  line  of  struggle  attracts  other  classes  of  Moroccan
			  	society,   	students,  worke:s,   	and  intellectuals  belonging  to  all  social  classes,   	the
			  	newness  of  aur  movement  noGwithstanding.    	In  a  short  period  of  time  we  have  attract-
			  	ed  braad  groups  of  Moroccan  masses.    	Let  us  look  at  our  latest  meeting  in  the.town
			  	of  Oudjda  with  young  people,  peasants  and  classes  of  limited  social  means.    	We  also
 -			 	~sttract  employers  and  affluent  people.    	What  is   	to  stand  in  the  way  of  that?    	Other
			  	parties  are  launching  a  new  level  of  criticism  against  us  every  day:    	sametimes  we
			  	represent  the  bourgeoisie,   	sometimes   	they  charge  that  we  are  defending  capitalism
			  	~fo~F.stically  ar~d  abroad.    	These  are  truly  amazing  things.    	Our  goal,   	contrary  to

		    	/guestion/  Do  you  believe  that  party  life  in  Morocco  has  created  a  qualitative
		    	change  in  the  thinking  and  mentality  of  the  citizen?    	We  observe  that  the  major
		    	parties  are  vertical  rather  than  horizontal  in  orientation  and  that  traditional
 =		   	categories  dominate.    	In  other  words,   	have  the  parties  transcended  their  character

		     	to  embody  a  natioaal  action  ovex  which  all  citizens  can  agree?
		     	/Answer/  Your  question  forms  part  of  the  basic  conceptions  of  the  Liber~l  Grouping.
		    	We  have  made  it  a  general  practice  to  state  that  we  are  suffering  from  a  void  in
  ~		   	traditional  political  life.    	A  grave  silence  has  been  hanging  over  the  nation,
		     	especially  in  the  current  stage,  which  is  witnessing  an  intensification  of  problems
  ,		   	d,~mestically  and  abroad.    	We  have  said  that  it  is  necessary  to  penetrate  the  wall
		     	of  silence  and  establish  a  new  movement  that  will  train  young  people  and  invite
		     	them  to  take  part  iz  the  forward  march  of  the  nation  and  the  young.    	For  a  1  mg
		     	time  we  have  been  waiting  for  awareness,  vigilance  and  participation  from  the
 -		   	political  parties,  which  continue  to  adhere  to  their  worn  out  leaders.    	Therefore
		     	we  have  decided   	to  cross  the  baCtle  lines  and  have  worked  assiduously  to  wake
		     	citizens  up  and  mobilize  them  to  participate  in  damestic  and  national  responsibili-
		     	ties.
		     	A  Democratic  Pluralism
		     	/suestion/  Is  the  silent  struggle  among  Moroccan  parties  likely  to  acquire  a  bloody
		     	character  along  Lebanese  lines?    	What  deterrent  is  there  to  prevent  that?    	Follow-	   	~
		     	ing  that,   	how  is  the  arteriosclerosis  among  the  parties  on  the  one  hand  and  among
		     	the  wings   	that  are  fighting  one  another  within  each  individual  party  on  the  other
		     	ro  be  cleared  out?
		     	/Answer/  We  deplore  struggle  among  parties,  whfle  accepting  the  existence  of  plural-
		     	ism,   	having  reservations  about  the  chaos  it  produces,   	and  aiming  at  preventing  the
		     	fragmen~ation  or  dilution  of  the  scope  for  political  action.    	Organization,  frank-
		     	ness  and  mutual  re~pect  are  necessary.    	Therefore  we  oppose  party  zealotry  and  same
		     	parties'attempts  to  ~nonapolize  the  poltical  scene.    	There  are  democratic  ways  to
		     	separate  loyal  forces  from  oppositio~~n  ones,   	such  as  referendums  and  elections.
		     	Above  and  beyond  that,  we  condemn  repressive  fascistic  doctrines  because  they  kill
		     	democracy.
				Ths  Liberal  Grouping  categoricaLly  believes  that  democratic  conszi~utional  monarchy
  -		    	is  the  guarantor  of  our  unity  and  coexistence  within  a  democratic  climate  and  the
				defender  of  citizens  against  doctrines  of  repression  and  daminance.
				/guestion/  Are  you  satisfied  with  the  government  coalition  which  Maati  Bouabid
				heads?    	How  do  you  evaluate  its  achievements?    	It  is  stated  that  it  lacks  a  harmon-
				ious  commir.gling  among  members  and  that  his  majesty  the  king  has  repeatedly  inter-
 -		    	vened  to  resolve  the  polarizations  within  it.
				/Answer/  There  can  be  no  doubt  that  I  address  myself  to  this  aspect  constantly,
  -		    	stressing  the  need  for  solidarity  and  harmony  during  the  difficult  stage  Morocco  is
				now  going  through  in  terms  of  the  economy,   	the  society  and  defense.    	We  hope  that  a

			  	homogeneous  government.    	It  is  obvious  that  every  coalition  government  has  advan-
			  	tages  and  faults.    	The  faults  generally  rise  to  the  surface  and  a  curtain  falls

  ~				of  party  pluralism  and  preparing  for  more  aggressive  activity  if  circumstances  be-
			  	cane  favorable?
			  	/Answer/  What  is   	the  nature  of  this  fifth  column  you  are  talking  about?
			  	/Question/  It  could  be  parties,  currents  within  parties,   	or  a  group  of  peaple  out-
			  	side  the  party  framework  who  are  prepared  to  cooperate  wi.th  foreign  bodies  in  order
			  	to  weaken  Moroccan  resistance.
			  	/Answer/  I  know  nothing  about  it  to  this  moment.    	We  are  far  from  falling  prey  to
  ~			 	the  Lebanese  predicament,  because  constitutional  monarchy  is  a  basic  element  for
			  	bringing  people  together  and  protecting  our  lines  with  /at  least/  a  minimum  of  pro-
			  	tection  against  the  dangers  hanging  over  us.    	In  sight  of  the  envirornnent  that  sur-
			  	rounds  us,  we  must  remain  vigilant,   	strangthen  our  vigilance  and  spread  it  through-
			  	out  the  Moroccan  masses.    	The  best  protection  is  guidance.    	The  Moroccan  people  to-
			  	d:~,y  enjoy  greater  resources  than  in  the  past  for  crushing  the  enemies'  plots  and
			  	expusing  their  intentions.
  .			 	/g~~estian/  Is  it  likely  that  the  Moroccan  press,  with  its  various  tendencies,   	is  in
			  	the  absence  of  censorship,   	Iikely  to  play  the  role  of  a  Trojan  horse  in  Moroccan
			  	society?    	Are  there  legal  measures  to  deter  any  excesses  that  might  occur?
			  	/Answer/  When  the  situation  concerns  damestic  security  and  the  defense  of  institu-
			  	tions  and  sacred  affairs,   	there  are  natural  laws  in  every  organized,  well  balanced
			  	countr;~.    	We  are  struggling  for  freedom  of  the  press  and  freedam  of  expression--
			  	withing  the  context,   	however,   	of  the  laws  and  presentation  of  our  national  values.
			  	The  Moroccan  newspapers  are  characterized  by  a  patriotic  nature  in  general,   	they
			  	strive  to  defend  our  genuine  heritage  and  they  are  free  from  foreign  involvements.
			   	/Question/  What  are  the  reasons  why  the  Moroccan  people  are  satisfied  with  the  king

		    	/Text/  Observers  agree  that  the  Soeialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers  possesses  a
		    	magnetic  power  on  the  Moroccar~  stage.    	People  attribute  this  to  the  dynamism  of  its
		    	staff  inembers  and  the  fact   	that  it  has  grasped  the  premises  of  social  and  cultural
		    	restlessness,   	especially  among  young  people  who  have  lost  hope  in  traditional   	forms
		    	of  struggle  and  aspire  to  "revolutionize"  Moroccan  structures  and  institutions.
		    	Historically  speaking,   	the  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers  arose  out  of  the
		    	National  Federation  of  Popular  Powers  whfch,  in  turn,   	arose  out  of  the  Istiqlal
		    	Party  in  1959  as  a  consequence  ~f  the  growing  gap  between  generations  which  had  be-
		    	come  estranged  in  their  notions  of  political  and  national  action.    	The  silent  strug-
		    	gle  among  the  leaders  also  had  an  effect  or.  the  process  of  ideological  fragmentation
		    	which  Morocco  went  through  on  the  verge  of  the  sixtie~.    	There  is  n~  doubt  that
		    	Abdallah  Ibrahim,  nicknamed  the  father  of  the  Moroccan  left,   	reproached  Istiqlal
		    	Party  people  for  covering  up  exploitative  acts  which  well-known  Moroccans  had  been
		    	commi.tting,   	called  for  greater  equality  in  the  context  of  equality  of  opportunity
		     	for  all  citizens,   	and  prompted  the  young  generation  to  assume  positions  of  internal
		    	decisionmaking  rather  than  clinging  to  anoutmoded  philosophy.
		     	The  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers  stayed  in  the  shadow  of  Abdallah  Ibrahim's
		     	notions  for  some  time  before  he  went  off  on  his  personal  poliCical-ideological
		     	tangent.    	It  is  well  known  that  when  it  arose,   	~he  National  Federation  contained
  -		   	such  prominent  personalities  in  the  Moroccan  political  game  as  Boutaleb,  Ben  Barka,
		     	Ahmed  Ben  Souda,  Abdallah  E1  Sinhadji,   	E1  Touhami,  E1  Ouazzani,  Mahdjoub  Ben  Seddik,
		     	Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid  and  Abdel  Kader  Sahraoui,  but  conflicts  of  views  and  interests
		     	scattered  them  in  different  directions.    	Secret  and  open  formations  and  organiza-
		     	tions  arose  �ram  this.    	Today,  Abdallah  Ibrahim  alone  remains  on  the  stage  and
		     	mobilization  activity  has  shifted  over  to  Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid's  organization,   	which
		     	aspires  to  "establish  a  sucialist  society  in  which  there  is  no  explcLtation  of  man
		     	by  his  fellow  man."
		     	Young  Staff  Members
		     	A  number  of  poltical  analysts  say  that  there  is  no  radical  ideological  dispute  be-
		     	tween  the  two  federations.    	Such  contradictions  as  exist  are  just  in  the  context  of  ~
		     	personalities.    	This  does  not  in  any  event  diminish  the  experiment  of  the  Social-

			  	A  group  of  premises  or  considerations  determine  the  Socialist  Federation's  politi-
			  	cal  geography  on  the  map  of  Moroccan  parties.    	These  are:
			  	1.    	The  basic  tenet  of  the  federation's  brand  of  socialism  is  collective  ownership
			  	of  the  means  of  production  and  exchange,  which  are  to  be  managed  by  producers
			  	through  their  organizations  along  with  the  government  apparatus,  which  is  to  be
 -			 	subject  to  oversighC  by  party  organizations.    	This  brand  of  socialism  is  practiced
			  	as  a  program  of  analysis  and  struggle.    	It  rejects  abstract  models  and  the  p~.rrot-
			  	ing  of  foreiga  experiences.
 ~			 	2.    	The  application  of  a  com~re:hensive  strategy  relying  on  the  interconnection  and
			  	equal  importance  of  liberation,   	growth  and  democracy,  with  the  objective  of  build-
			  	ing  a  socialist  c.ivi3.ization  in  keeping  with  the  particular  characteristics  of  the
			  	Moroccan  people.
			  	3.    	The  need  for  economic  Iiberation  in  order  to  attain.  an  economic  development
			  	possessing  numerous  complex  facets,   	in  the  context  of  Morocco,   	first,   	then  the
			  	Maghreb  countries,   	as  gart  of  an  integrated  economic-developmental  system  which
			  	wiil  lead  to  high  rates  of  industrialization.    	The  premise  is  an  agricultural  and
			  	agrarian  reform  emancipated  from  relations  of  subservience  and  directed  toward  self-
			  	sufficiency  and  exports.
			  	4.    	The  So~ialist  Federalists  emphasize  building  a  material  base  for  development
			  	through  integrated  industrial  projects  to  guarantee  the  integrity  of  the  econrnnic
			  	system  within  the  framework  of  the  domestic  dynamism  of  accumulated  capital  and
			  	the  effort  to  liquidate  vertical  relationships  which  could  draw  branches  of  pro-
			  	duction  into  centers  of  capitalist  decisionmaking  and  guidance.
			  	Responding  to  collective  needs  at  Che  expense  of  individual  ones  is  a  condition
			  	which  is  connected  to  revolt~ =onfzing  goverrunent  structures,   	implanting  real  dem-
			  	ocracy  and  striving  to  formulate  a  genuine  modern  culture  which  will  liberate  citi-
			  	zens  from  dispossession  and  alienation.    	The  instrument  for  realizing  these  goals
			  	is  the  party.    	The  point  of  departure  is  self-criticism,   	and  the  success  of  the
			  	movemenC  depends  on  young  intellectuals..  who  are  liberated  fram  social  reaction.
			  	5.    	All  experiments  at  unity  within  the  Arab  nation  are  welcomed,  no  matter  what
			   	tl~eir  results,   	and  an  effort  is  made  to  place  them  firmly  ~aithin  a  unified  struggle
			  	which  progressive  popular  organizations  with  united  ideological  c~ptions  will  lead,
			  	followed  by  development  plans  which  are  capable  of  providing  true  Arab  unity  on

		    	The  Particular  Character  of  Morocco
		    	In  actual  practice,  after  studying  the  fonns  of  the  Socialist  Federalists'   	struggle,
		    	we  observe  that  these  ideological  premises  have  become  confined,   	or  have  nearly  be-
		    	come  confined,   	to  more  realistic  demarbds  which  are  clos~r  to  the  particular  nature
		    	of  the  situation  in  Morocco.    	These  are:
		    	Raising  the  sharply  expanding  differences   	in  incomes  between  ordinary  families  and
  -		   	the  exploitative  classes:    	5  percent  of  the  population  monopolizes  close  to  half
		    	the  national  incame.    	The  Socialist  Federalists  give  this  class  the  name  "economic
		    	oligarchy."
		    	The  issue  of  the  monopolization  of  farmland,   	especially  irrigated  land,  by  b:g
		    	Moroccans.
		    	The  issue  of  continuing  the  liberal  platform,  which  eases  the  tasks  of  the  Moroccan.
		    	bourgeoisie  and  speculators.
		    	Limiting  the  intensified  economic  crisis,   	the  rise  in  the  prices  of  foodstuffs  and
		    	equipment  and  the  growing  problems  of  Moroccan  exports,  which  are  adding  to  the  ex-
		    	ploitation  of  the  toiling  masses  and  the  spread  of  uneraployment  and  misery.    	To
		    	curb   	this  phenamenon,   	the  Socialist  Federation  claims  that  real.planning  based  on  a
		    	dialogue  with  the  masses  in  the  context  of  local  institutions  is  necessary  and  that
		    	recourse  must  be  made  to  the  basic  nationalization  of  the  means  of  production,
 -		   	transportation,   	exchange  and  lending,   	in  addition,  as  radical  change  in  the  admin-
		    	istrative  structure  remains  a  basic  condition  for  reversing  the  economic  decline.
		    	Which  of  the  Socialist  Federation's  economic  demands  have  been  realized?    	What  ac-
		     	complishments  has   	the  federation  carried  out  in  actual  practice,   	now  that  it  has  a
		     	history  of  approximately  20  years  of  party  activity?
		    	A  responsible  source  in  the  Socialist  Federation  told  AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI,   	"The
		     	political  map  in  Morocco  could  become  clearly  known  in  the  event  honest  election~s
		     	were  continuously  held.    	This  has  unfortunately  not  hagpened.    	We  had  great  hopes
		     	of  attracting  broad  new  groups   	to  our  party  and  consequently  having  the  political
		     	map   	take  clear  form.    	This  requires  neutrality,   	or  at  least  r~spect  for  the  ballot

 i		   	box.    	People  talk  about  guarantees.    	In  mun3.cipal  and  village  elections,   	these  have
 -		   	been  pro  forma,   	and  no  consistent  fraud  ha.s  occurred.    	Therefore  the  Federal  ParCy
 _		   	prevailed  in  Rabat  (we  have  29  out  of  39  counsellors),  Agadir  (26  out  of  31  coun-
		     	sellors),   	and  Fez  (19  out  of  39  counsellors),  while  the  Istiqlal  Party  has   	16,   	and
  .		   	there  are  four  independents,   	in  addition  to  the  municipalities  of  Sila,  Ain  Ziyab,
		     	Qalat  E1  Saraghina,   	Inzeghane,   	and  small  towns  like  Djaad,   	Safar  and  E1  Araiche.
		     	In  the  town  of  Safi  20  of  our  people  aut  of  31  succeeded  in  winning  seats  in  the
		     	city  council,   	but  meddling  disrupted  the  balance,  especially  in  Tangiers,   	Safi  and
		     	Kuneitra  ..n  the  form  of  consistent  invalidations."
		     	Severe  Criticism  of  the  Government
  .		   	He  continued,   	"We  presented  the  problem  to  the  government  and  the  cabinet.    	However,
		     	investigations  did  not  take  place  in  the  d~sired  depth.    	In  our  newspapers  we  pub-

			  	1977  no  official  denial  has  been  issued.    	We  do  not  want  to  stab  democracy  in  the
  ~				back.    	We  have  fought  for  it  for  decades.    	The  result  is  that  the  first  secretary,
  -		     	Mr  Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid,   	lost  in  the  city  of  Agadir."
			  	The  responsibl.e  source  went  on  to  sumnarize  the  severe  criticisms  against  the  cur-
			  	rent  cabinet  listing  a  number  of  points,   	including:
  -				"1.    	The  refusal  to  review  econanic  options  whose  infeasibility  has  been  underlined
			  	by  experCs  as  far  as  current  conditions   	in  Morocco  go.    	For  example,  we  published
  =				a  report  by  the  World  Bank  in  the  newspaper  AI,-MUHARRIR  pointing  out  that  Morocco
 -				has  about  7  million  citizens  at  the  poverty  level,   	out  of  a  total  population  of  20
			  	million.    	The  report  cited  accurate  details  ancl  figures  which  we  had  always  used
			  	with  officials.
			  	"2.    	The  dominance  of  irresponsibility.    	For  example,   	last  year  the  minister  of  ed-
  -				ucation  took  serious  decisions  without  previous  consultation  or  study,   	and  this
			  	created  an  uproar  in  the  country.    	We  said  that  no  minister  has  the  right  to  deal
			  	with  future  generations  in  this  manner.    	At  the  education  symposium  held  in  Afran,
			  	on  the  basis  of  an  invitation  from  his  ma.jesty  the  king,   	it  became  apparent  from  the
  -				discussion  that   	the  government  had  not  agreed  to  the  decisions  of  Che  minister  of
			  	education,  Mr  Azzedine  Laraki.    	The  drought  which  occurred  this  year  and  the  means
			  	with  which  it  is  intended  to  allevia~e  its  effects  have  an  influence  on  the  irre-
			 	~onsibility  of  some  ministers.    	Where  are  the  prudent  measures  for  coping  with  the
			  	disaster?    	Why  these  bureaucratic  measures   	for  coping  with  it,   	such  as  the  formation
  -				of  coc~nittees  and  study  panels?
			  	He  went  on,   	"Following  the  Afran  debate,  we  kept  the  country  from  losing  an  academic
			  	year  in  the  universities.    	However,   	our  reco~endations  were  not  applied,   	in  spite
			  	of  our  practical  solutions,  which  take  existing  resources  into  consideration.    	For
			  	example,  we  propounded  solutions   	to  the  problem  of  professors  in  higher  education,
			  	then  professors  offering  35  hours  of  teaching  a  year,  who  are  prepared  to  go  to  more
			  	than  or.~  institute.    	Who,   	however,   	is  planning  to  create  such  a  structural  shift?
			  	'['he  minister  said,   	'We  are  short  of  classrooms.'    	We  counted  the  classrooms  and
			  	found   	Chat  they  could  accommodate  a  large  number  of  students,   	to  meet  our  needs  for
			  	audii:oriums.    	There  is  a  vicious  circle  represented  by  a  lack  of  oversight  in  the
			  	followup  af  everyday  matters."
			  	Easy  Slogans
			  	In  this  regard,   	the  Socialist  Federation  is  playing  the  part  of  a  constructi.ve  op-
			  	position,   	as  its  officials  say.    	"It  presents  alternatives,  but  there  are  officials
			  	who  do  not  adopt  them,"  continued  the  source,   	"because  they  consider  that  their
  _			 	options  are  correct.    	Does  the  disturbance  that  exists  lie  within  the  context  of  a
			  	conflict  between  party  plans  and  goveriunent  plans,   	and  the  refusal  to  accept  specific
			  	concessions?"
  ,				Mr  Mohamed  E1  Yazighi,   	second  man  in  Che  federation  and  member  of  the  Political
			  	Bureau,   	said   	that  it  is  not  proper  for  such  a  c~nf lict  to  be  one  of  the  endurin~
			  	phenamena  of  the  coalition  government.    	It  is  necessary  to  agree  on  a  mini.mum  pro-
			  	gram  to  prevent  the  fragmentation  of  government  activity.    	Regarding  ~he  "phenc~m-
			  	enon"of  ~'emocracy  in  Morocco,   	the  federalists   	say  that  that  should  be  deepened  be-

		  	on  the  sidelines,"  on  grounds  that  through  democratic  activity  they  are  promoting

		  	tions  of  the  young  people  who  are  seeking  a  way  of  life  for  themselves  within  Moroccan
		  	society.    	They  also  direct  blame  at  the  federalists'  monopolization  of  certain  areas
		  	of  Moroccan  culture  and  refusal  to  work  outside  of  them.    	Their  observations  in  par-

		   	/Text/  Abdel  Rahim  Bouabid,   	first  secretary  of  the  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular
  ~		 	Powers,   	is  the  most  prominent  man  in  the  opposition  in  Morocco.    	After  independence
		   	his  name  was  liked  with  ambitious  schemes  for  establishing  a  Moroccan  economy  liber-
		   	ated  from  all  subordination.    	He  also  helped  launch  the  democratic  experiment  in
		   	Morocco  and  is  considered  one  of  the  most  prominent  defenders  of  democracy's  need
		   	for  pluralism,   	lib~ralization  and  active  trade  union  dialogue.
		   	This  conversation  is  an  atCempt  to  determine  the  Socialfst  Federation's  place  on  the
		   	Moroccan  party  map  arul  unearth  its  most  important  notions  concerning  the  economy,
		   	democracy  arnd  politics  in  the  context  of  local,  Arab  and  international  considerations.
		   	/Question/  Disagreements  exist  over  the  orientation  of  the  Socialist  Federatio,n.
		   	People  say  that  there  was  some  fraud  in  the  latest  parliamentary  elections  and  that
		   	opposition  still  assumes  a  theoretical  character,   	since  you  are  holding  onto  parlia-
		   	mentary  representation  through  the  31  deputies  that  belong  to  the  Federation.    	How
		   	do  you  stand,   	between  theory  and  practice?
		    	/Answer/  There  is  no  inconsistency  in  our  stand.    	We  could  have  withdrawn  from  parlia-

			  	/Question/  Doesn't  your  obsen?atian  concern  a  specific  phenamenon  and  consequently
			  	fail  to  deal  with  democratic  life  in  Morocco  in  its  overall  sense?
			  	JAnswer/  I  am  confining  my  statement  to  the  recent  parliamentary  elections.    	We  were
			  	asked   	to  take  part  in  them  and  a  council  was  established  by  name  of  "the  Council  To
			  	Watch  over  the  Elections."    	Basically  we  had  deman,ded  that  the  administrative  ap-
 -				paratus  hold  to  a  position  of  neutrality  so  that  the  masses  could  express  their  op-
			  	tions,   	if  anly  in  a  relative  sense.    	Hawever,  blatant  interference  took  place  in
			  	every  electoral  precinct  and,   	~n  addition,  presures  were  brought  Co  bear  by  the  ad-
			  	ministrative  apparatus,  which  chose  people  who  would  represent  it.    	7'hese  adminis-
			  	tration  representatives  today  constitute  what  is  called  the  National  Liberal  Group-
 -				ing.    	They  were  chosen  by  every  means  available  by  the  administrative  apparatus  and
			  	that  imparted  a  fraudulent  turn  to  the  elections.    	However,   	the  struggle  for  democ-
			  	racy  has  yielded  a  number  of  gains  which  we  cannot  deny.
			  	Participation  in  the  Regime
			  	/suestion/  What,   	specifically,  are  the  gains?
			  	/Answer/  Freedom  of  the  press,  for  instance.    	Press  censorship  has  been  eliminated
			  	as  a  part  Af  the  temporary  positive  measures  which,  it  is  said,   	will  be  final.
			  	There  are  other  gains:    	a  number  of  political  prisoners  have  been  released  and  some
			  	peogle  living  abr~uad  have  been  able  to  come  back  to  Morocco.    	Hnwever,   	there  ~re
			  	other  negative  points,   	such  as  the  100  prisoners  who  are  in  jail  because  of  their
			  	political  positions.    	We  are  demanding  that  they  be  releaseci,   	in  parliament  and  on
			  	the  street.    	This  is  a  black  mark  in  the  ledger  of  democracy.    	We  do  not  understand
			  	what  distinction  was  made  between  the  people  who  were  released  and  the  people  who
			  	are  still  in  prison.    	It  is  as  if  the  administrative  apparatus  does  not  want  to  res-
			  	pond  to  all  the  urgent  demands  at  once;   	it  is  as  if  it  is  asking  for  something,in
			  	exchange.
  _			 	/Question/  What  in  your  view  do  they  want  in  exchange?    	A  freeze  on  demands  by  the
			  	Federatia~~~   	for  example?
			  	/Answer/  One  thing  they  want,   	for  exan~ple,   	is  our  agreement  to  take  part  in  the
			  	gover~e*~,~.    	We  have  raised  a  question:    	How,   	aiad  on  what  basis,  will  we  agree  to
			  	such  participation?    	The  government  has  ignored  the  fraudulent  elections  and  it  is
 -				propounding  capitalist  liberalism.    	How  can  we  find  common  ground  with  a  group  that
			  	is  opposed  to  our  choices  and  conceptions?    	If  there  is  common  ground  between  us  and
			  	thF  members  of  this  gavernment,   	the  grounds  for  dialogue  will  be  easy.    	We  were  told,
			  	"Thera  is  a  grave  threat  to  Che  unity  of  Moroccan  soil."    	This  is  enough  to  bring
			  	everyone  together,   	aside  fram  other  consideratians;   	there  is  national  consensus  on
			  	this  issue  at  all  public  levels,   	and  a  security  council  was  established  in  the  wake
			  	of  this  threat.    	We  took  part  in  it  because  it  concerned  the  Sahara  question  and
			  	territor~al  unity.    	Our  response  was  that  it  was  not  possible  for  us,  however,   	to

	    	/Anscoer/  Our  activity  is  aimed  at  rectifying  the  demoaatic  process  if  only  in  the
	    	relative  sense.    	We  do  not  aspire  to  the  democracy  of  England.    	We  want  to  take
	    	stock  of  the  particular  nature  of  the  MQroccan  situation  and  the  dangers  threaten-
	    	ing  it,  which  also  threaten  Algeria  in  the  saTne  connection.
	     	/guestion/  Are  you  referring  to  a  specific  source  of  danger  for  Morocco  and  Algeria?
	    	Hoca  does   	Che  Socialist  Federation  view  the  Libyan  role  in  the  area,   	for  example?
	     	/Answer/  In  1974  Col  al-Qadhdhafi  said  that  it  was  not  useful,for  the  Arabs  to
	     	create  artificial  entities  in  the  area  and  that  he  wanted  unity  and  wanted  people
	     	to  work  toward  unity.    	After  that,  he  went  through  a  change  and  started  financing
	     	and  training  what  is  called  Polisario,   	in  order  to  establish  a  Saharan  entity
	     	stretching  from  Libya  to  the  Atlantic  Ocean.    	This  approach  is  bound  to  exacerbate
	     	tensions  with  Algeria  and  Mali.    	Today  he  is  again  extending  his  political,   	finaii-
	     	cial  and  administrative  sovereignty  over  Mauritania  and  is  asking  the  Mauritanians
	     	to  help  create  a  Saharan  Republic.    	Such  a  republic,   	in  the  event  it  is  established,
	     	will   	threaten  the  identity  of  Mauritania  and  cause  it  to  explode  from  within,   	be-
	     	cause  of  the  existence  of  the  tribes  and  their  proliferating  disputes.    	Black
 _	   	Mauritanians  do  not  accept  Che  dominance  of  Polisario  or  groups  from  the  north,
	     	and  they  reject  Libyan  policies.
	     	/Question/  The  Socialist  Federation  opposes  some  of  the  economic  opti~ns   	the  present
	     	government  is  pursuing,  but  the  alternative  it  presents,  deep  down,  does  not  differ
	     	from  the  approaches  that  are  being  propounded  in  the  Moroccan  arena  now.
	     	/Answer/  The  alternative  we  are  propounding  is  different  fram  the  options  of  the
	     	present  and  previous  governments.    	There  is  what  is  called  the  public  sector,  which
	     	plays  a  basic  role  in  eccnomic  growth  as  an  energetic,  pioneering  element.    	In  the
	     	first  years  of  independence,   	the  progressive  movement  in  Morocco  was  on  the  fore-
	     	front  in  creating  public  sectors,  but  when  governments  came  to  power  which  e~poused
	     	the  liberal  capitalisr_  road,   	the  facts  of  the  situation  changed:    	the  public  sector
	     	was  not  serving  the  total  nation  but  voluntarily  served  the  private  sector,   	and   	the
	     	capitalist  bourgeoisie  which  emerged  after  independence  has  deepened  social  differ-
	     	ences  in  an  increasing  manner  as  a  result  of  the  economic  policies  that  are  follow-
	     	ed.    	Our  option  is  not  just  to  nationalize  sectors;   	it  is  also  to  include  them  in
	     	a  developmental  framework  which  will  serve  the  nation.    	There  is  no  point  natfon-
	     	alizing  if  that  does  not  involve  the  government  and  the  administrative  apparatus
			in  the  process  of  serving  the  whole  people,  not  of  serving  the  bourgeoisie  and
			feudalism  in  the  agricultural,   	industrial  acyd  commercial  fields.
			Staff  Members  and  Notions  Propounded
			/suestion/  Some  Socialist  Federation  leaders  are  capitalists,   	like  the  deputy  Ben
			Said  and  Abdel  Quahed  E1  Radi.    	Where  do  you  stand  between  the  notions  you  pro-
			pound  on  the  aeople's  behalf  and  your  bourgeois  staff  inembers?
			/Answer/  Mr  Ben  Said  is  not  a  feudalist.    	He  is  a  lawyer  and  exaggerates  in  estim-
			aring  his  wealth.    	Mr  Abdel  Quahed  B1  Radi  is  a  university  professor  and  depends
			on  his  monthly  salary.    	The  village  from  which  he  is  descended  is  collective  prop-
			erty.    	Our  leaders  do  not  include  capitalists.    	There  are  personnel  with  a  bourge-
			ois  standard  of  living,  but   	that  is  a  situation  which  exists  in  most  progressive

			 	parties.    	A  capitalist  may  say  that  he  believes  in  the  socialist  option  but  that  he
			 	is   	living  in  a  capitalist  system  in  spite  of  his  struggle  to  change  the  structure
			 	of  bourgeois  society  and  launch  it  in  a  socialist  direction.    	Such  cases  are  to  be
			 	found  in  the  French  Caa~unist  Party  and  the  French  Socialist  Party,  as  well  as   	the
			 	Italian  one.
			 	/suestion/  In  these  cases,  where  is   	the  revolutionary  credibility?    	Is  revolution
 -				a  matter  of  slogans  without  live  examples  in  the  real  world?
			 	/Answer/  Let  us  turn  the  equation  around:    	there  are  poor  people  who  are  active  in
			 	fascist  parties.    	The  Istiqlal  people,  who  have  chastised  us  for  these  contradic-
			 	tions,  have  forgotten  that  this  way  of  thinking  goes  back  to  the  French  administra-
			 	tion  in  the  d~ys  of  the  protectorate.    	The  French  told  nationalists,   	"You  are  the
			 	people  who  are  benefitting  from  the  economic  situation  and  the  reforms  we  are  car-
			 	rying  out."    	They  would  organize  public  demonstrations  in  downtrodden  areas  to  sup-
			 	port  the  French  protectorate,  demonstrations  of  migrants  and  bedouins  for  instance.
			 	People  who  criticise  us  for  the  contradictions  aim  to  defend  their  own  interests,
			 	having  taken  advantage  of  colonial  conditions.    	In  this  fashion  they  have  Caken  the
			 	place  of  the  foreign  colonialist.    	Even  in  the  co~anies  where  they  are  taking
 -				"Moroccanization"  measures,   	they  have  monopolized  shares  and  positions  they  do  not
			 	deserve  and  have  struggled  to  acquire.    	These  are  manna  frosn  heaven  for  them.    	The
			 	serious   	thing  is  that   	they  have  sometimes  used  state  money  to  monopolize  company
			 	shares  in  the  context  of  loan  policy.    	Thus  the  govertnnent  has  helped  create  a
			 	capitalist  bourgeoisie  with  the  people's  money.    	If  Moroccan  capitalists  were  like
			 	European  ones,   	that  is,   	if  they  had  earned  their  wealth  through  their  own  efforts
			 	and  their  pioneering  initiative,  we  would  have  said  that  that  was  natural  and  did
			 	not  lie  within  the  context  of  our  struggle  against  them.
			 	Outside  the  Game
			 	/~uestion/  Of  the  Socialist  Federation  group,   	it  is  said  that  they  follow  a  tech-
			 	nique  ai~debilitation.    	Do  you  agree  with  me  or  not?    	Are  there  no  middle  of  the
			 	road  salutions  or  openings  to  dialogue?    	The  king,   	for  example,  has  proposed  a
			 	referendum  on  extending  the  Chamber  of  Deputies'   	term  from  4  to  6  years.

			 	ering  the  age  of  the  crown  prince  from  20  to  18.    	How  do  you  explain  that?
			 	/Answer/  I  see  no  contradiction  in  the  process  of  acceptance  and  rejection.    	We  say
			 	that  the  recent  elections  were  fraudulent  and  we  do  not  want  mem~ers  of  parliament
			 	to  keep  occupying  seats  they  do  not  deserve.    	If  we  agreed  that  would  be  a  cantra-
			 	diction,   	not  the  opposite.    	The  issue  is  not  one  of  4  or  6  years;   	it  is  the  desire
			 	not  to  lengthen  the  life  of  a  fraudulent  assembly.    	When  we  hold  a  boycott,   	that
			 	means   	that  there  is  no  guarantee  underlining  the  soundness  of  electoral  procedures.
			 	We  want  to  stay  outside  the  administration's  game.    	We  were  asked  at  the  end  of  1979
			 	to  negotiate  with  the  administrative  apparatus  on  a  specific  matter  related  to  the
			 	number  of  Socialist  Federation  deputies.    	We  refused   	to  bargain,  out  of  the  concern
			 	not  to  stab  the  course  of  democracy  in  the  back.
			 	/Question/  The  Istiqlal  members  say  that  your  secession  from  their  party  was  a

										 	FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY
		 	/Answer/  The  Istiqlal  Party  was  lacking  in  coordination  and  mobilization.    	There
		 	were  bourgeois,   	lower  middle  class  and  peasant  elements  in  its  ranks  who  had
		 	gathered  together  to  oppose  colonialism.    	After  independence,   	the  emphasis  is  on
		 	issues  changed  and  a  schism  occurred  overideology  and  mobilization.    	The  Istiqlal
		 	members  participate  in  the  regime  but  they  have  forgotten  the  slogans  they  used  to
 _	     	propound.    	The  class  struggle  has  arisen  from  the  capitalist  options  in  which  they
		 	have  sought  refuge.    	We  did  not  manufacture  the  class  atruggle--that  is  a  conse-
		 	quence  of  the  bourgeois  environment.    	When  the  Istiqlal  members  monopolize  compan-
  _	     	ies,   	factories  and  land,   	they  find  themselves  faced  with  a  class  of  ordinary  people
		 	who  resist  their  acts.    	Herein  lies  the  truth  of  the  class  situation  which  is  be-
		 	coming  seriously  aggravated.
		 	/Question/  Why  do  people  find  fault  with  you  for  resorting  in  a  big  way  to  slo~ans
		 	in  order  to  attract  young  people  who  are  frustrated  and  feel  economic  and  social
		 	despair?
		 	/Answer/  There  is  a  mass  cansciousness  which  we  want  to  mobilize.    	Ask  the  workers
		 	and  studants,   	if  you  want,   	to  find  out  how  our  notions  respond  to  their  aspirations.
		 	Society  has  produced  the  frustrations  and  bitterness  which  you  are  talking  about.
		 	6Je  want  our  young  people  to  be  liberated  from  them  and  therefore  we  give  them  the
		 	means   	to  become  liberated.    	Why  shouldn't  we  mobilize  people's  powers  to  eliminate
		 	unemployment  and  social  backwardness?    	Why  do  we  note  a  concern  to  keep  things  as
		 	they  are  rather  than  move  them  forward?    	The  defects  do  not  lie  in  the  ideas  and
		 	concepts--they  lie  in  the  people  who  are  given  responsibility.
		  	/Question/  How  do  the  Federal  Socialists  explain  the  upheavals  in  the  structures  of
		  	traditional  parties?    	It  is  said  that  polarization  and  incompatible  currents  exist
		 	within  the  Socialist  Federation.    	What  is  the  truth  of  these  items?
		  	/Answer/  There  are  numerous  reasons  in  the  historic  context.    	There  is   	the  struggle
		  	of  ideas,   	generations  and  ideological  fragmentation.    	Lest  we  speak  overlong  in
		  	analyzing  the  past,   	let  us  look  around  ourselvQS.    	We  consider  that  the  rifts  which
		  	have  occurred  in  the  Liberal  Grouping  do  not  inspire  our  amazement  or  disapproval.
		  	This  is  because  the  Liberal  Grouping  is  a  coalition  of  a  group  of  interests  which
		  	are  sometimes  contradictory.    	We  do  not  give  a  great  deal  of  thought  to  this.    	How-
		  	ever,   	in  the  case  of  the  Zstiqlal  Party,   	there  are  currents  within  it  that  are
		  	creating  poles  the  conflicting  positions  in  which  decisionmakers  are  moving  create
		  	further  confusion  and  polarization.    	I  am  not  qualified  to  spell  out  contradictions
		  	within  the  programs  which  have  been  set  forCh;   	the  people  in  the  Istiqlal  alone  can
		  	identify  points  of  disturbance.
		  	Addressing  ourselves   	to  the  Socialist  Federation  of  Popular  Powers,  we  can  state
		  	without  reservation  that  currents  exist  within  it.    	This  is  natural  and  does  not
		  	surprise  us.    	The  questions  our  staff  inembers  raise  lay  our  options  and  tendencies
		  	out  on  the  table  and  make  them  better  suited  to  the  tentative  activities  we  are
		  	undertaking.    	I  believe  that  these  currents,  which  ultimately  contribute  to  party
		  	unity,   	express  the  awareness  and  deep  understanding  of  the  nature  of  the  role  and
		  	the  historic  stage  Morocco  is  going  through.    	They  are  gaining  greater  effective-
		  	ness  and  endurance  for  our  goals  of  democracy,   	socialism  and   	liberation.

			   	IAnswc:r/  I  do  not  believe  that  there  are  Trojan  horses  on  the  Moraccan  party  map.
			   	In  the  past,   	trivial  attempts  were  made  but  today  the  powers  are  joining  forces
			  	with  the  nation  in  the  face  of  the  escalating  dangers  which  hedge  us  about.    	There
			   	is  a  consciousness  which  will  keep  the  Moroccs~n  masses  far  away  fram  the  Lebanese
  _				experience,   	from  *.~hich  intense  foriegn  intervention  has  arisen.
			  	Part  of  the  Whole
			   	/Question/  You  talk  a  great  deal  in  your  press  about  the  "lack  of  wherewitha~  for
			   	a  dialogue  between  the  government  and  the  unions."    	To  what  do  you  ascribe  this
			   	estrangement?
			   	/Answer/  tJe  rarely  hear  of  discourse  between  government  officials  and  the  unions,
			   	that  vital  element  in  the  economic  destiny  of  the  country.    	People  say  that  we  are
			   	living  in  a  country  that  has  political  and  union  pluralism.    	That  is  not  enough.
			   	That  is  a  part  of  the  whole,   	but  the  whole  ought  to  be  a  dialogue  with  workers  and
			   	producers  and  agreement  on  procedures  bearing  on  demands.    	The  demands  are  still
			   	hanging  in  all  fields.    	We  can  cite,   	as  an  example  the  Phosphate  Organization,   	the
			   	biggest  productive  installation  in  Morocco.    	It  has  1,000  workers  and  an  important
			   	union  exists  which  speaks  for  this  massive  group.    	Since  1976,  when  the  union  was
			   	founded,   	the  minister  has  not  received  the  union  bureau,  which  is  emcpowered  to
			   	represent  the  workers.    	The  government  states  that  it  is  on  the  side  of  union  rights,
			   	freedams  and  dialogue,  but  for  4  years  the  director  general  of  the  ministry  refused
			   	to  meet  with  trade  union  o�ficials.    	It  is  not  enough  to  talk  about  democracy.    	It
			   	is  necessary  to  impart  true  meaning  to  the  notion  of  democracy.    	If  I  ask  any  of  the
			   	current  ministers  abaut  agreements  he  has  concluded  with  trade  union  officials,   	he
			   	will  not  give  a  positive  answer.
			   	/~uestiun/  How  can  we  explain  this  failure?    	Are  there  democracies  in  the  world  in
			   	the  basic  sense  of  the  word,   	in  France  and  Britain  for  example?    	Many  criticisms  ~
			   	have  been  made  of  democratic  practices.
			   	/Answer/  We  in  the  Socialist  Federation  are  not  despairing.    	There  are  areas  in  our
  -			 	exercise  of  democracy  which  are  improving.    	However,   	there  are  other  fields  where
			   	we  cor,sider  democracy  has  been  abolisited.
			   	/Question/  Will  the  Socialist  Federation  withdraw  fram  parliament  in  the  event  the
			   	4-year  period  now  in  effect  is  extended?
			   	/Answer/  No  one  has  yet  confirmed  that  the  current  period  of  this  parliament  will
			   	be  extended.    	One  hears  items  of  news,   	but  it  is  not  in  our  power  to  make  decisiona

		   	as  the  Istiqlal  Party  sees  them?
		   	/Answer/  The  two  most  prominent  features  of  Moroccan  pol~~tical  life  are  freedom  of
		   	thought  and  freedom  of  action.    	This  freedom  may  be  attributed  to  a  sound  concept,
		   	which  the  Istiqlal  Party  has  believed  in  for  a  long  time,  which  may  be  sum~arized
		   	as  the  refusal  to  be  assimilated  into  a  system  of  foreign  values,  French  ones  in
		   	particular.    	The  French,   	during  the  periods  of  national  struggle,   	gave  the  Istiqlal
		   	Party  (considering  that  it  was  the  sole  party  that  existed  on  the  stage  at  t~hat
		   	time)   	the  offer  of  incorporation  into  French  political  movements.    	The  Istiqlal
		   	members  refused  to  be  incorporated  into  any  f oreign  movement,   	since  it  was  their
		   	goal  to  preserve  the  genuine  nature  of  Istiqlal  thinking.    	We  realize  that  there
		   	are  political  parties  and  movements  which  have  arisen  in  countries  under  French
		   	colonization  but  were  directly  connected  to  French  organizations.    	This  observation
		   	applies   	to  Algeria  and  the  African  countries.    	In  Morocco  (and  in  Tunisia  also)   	the
		   	notion  of  avoiding  French  political  hegemony  took  solid  form.    	The  people  in
		   	Istiqlal  implanted  the  foundations  of  this  principle  and  rejected  the  notion  of  a
		   	single  party,   	although  they  were  the  only  people  on  the  stage.    	If  we  go  back  to
		    	the  writings  of  A~lal  E1  Fassi,   	in  his  work  "Self  Criticism,"  we  will  see  that  he
		   	attacks   	the  notion  of  a  single  party  and  stresses  the  need  for  a  pluralism  of  par-
		    	ties  in  an  independent  Morocco.    	After  independence,  we  proceeded  to  promote  an
		    	atmosphere  of  democratic  struggle  and  freedam.    	We  established  intellectual,  work-
		    	ers'   	and  union  societies   	to  liberate  discussion  from  the  fetters  of  disruption
		    	through  a  proliferation  of  voices.    	There  is  no  doubt  that  the  democratic  tradition
		    	has  been  deeply  rootec:  in  the  Istiqlal  Party  vision  from  the  time  we  presented  a
		    	petition  demanding  democracy  in  the  early  forties.    	This  is  the  legacy  of  our
		    	poliCical  struggle,   	especially  in  the  context  of  everyday  practice.

			 	/Question/  It  is  said  that  the  Istiqlal  Party  protects  the  interests  of  some  afflu-
			 	ent  groups  in  Moroccan  society,  while  its  power  of  attraction  in  toiling  labor  cir-
			 	cles  is  weak.    	To  what  do  you  ascribe  this  distincCion2
			 	/ana-~er/  Tiie  Istiqlal  Party  arose  fran  the  premises  of  petty  bourgeois  groups  end
			 	the  dawntrodden  working  classes  in  the  rural  areas  and  towns.    	The  faunders  of  tl~e
			 	Istiql.al  Party  were  students  and  pupils  in  secondary  bchools.    	The  events  of  1927
			 	and   	1928  are  clear  on  this  subject.    	There  is  no  ambiguity  in  this  regard  with  res-
			 	pect  to  the  party's  first  title,   	that  is,   	the  National  Action  Bloc.    	The  party's
			 	mobilization  power  at  that  time  was  concentrated  among  tradesmen  and  small  merchants,
			 	especially  in  towns  which  depended  on  traditional  domestic  industry  such  as  Fez,
			 	Marrakesh,   	Rabat,   	Sila,  Meknes  and  Tetouan.    	These  towns  were  the  physical  birth-
 _				places  of  the  national  movement.    	The  tradesmen  constituted  the  movement's  first
 -				core,   	followed  by  bedouins,  peasants  and  intellectuals  of  modest  means.    	Up  to  to-
			 	day,   	the  Istiqlal  Party  has  depended  on  these  professional  and  social  classes.    	Let
			 	us  not  forget   	the  role  of  the  working  class  in  the  party;   	it  played  a  vanguard  role
			  	in  the  clashes  which  occurred  in  Morocco  on  behalf  of  independence,  such  as  those
			  	of  1933,   	1936,   	1937,   	1944  and  1947,  when  the  Moroccan  French  struggle  was  at  its
			 	peak  in  the  towns  and  rural  areas  under  the  command  of  Marshal  Juin.    	In  Che  light
			  	of  all  this,   	I  do  not  believe  that  we  are  protecting  the  interests  of  the  upper
			  	bourgeoisie.    	That  charge  has  been  directed  against  us,  but  is  not  founded  on  any
			  	basis  of  specific  evidence.
			 	An  Obsolete  Movement?
			  	/guestion/  Well  informed  circles  in  opposition  garties  say  that  the  Istiqlal  Party
			  	is  an  obsolete  movement  which  is  concerned  with  past  achievements  and  does  not  pay
			  	attention  to  the  challenges  of  the  present,  and  thus  that  the  party  has  lost  its
			  	earty  allure  of  the  days  of  Allal  E1  Fassi,   	and  3ts  power  to  mobilize  has  conse-
			  	quently  diminished.
			  	/Answer/  That  is  not  true.    	Let  me  invite  you  to  the  festivals  we  hold,   	or  the  cell
			  	msetings  we  organize  periodically,   	so  that  you  can  see  the  Is;:iqlal  Party's  credit
 -			 	anc?   	strength  by  yourself  and  our  power  to  attract  people  by  using  the  method  of
			  	"cer~radeship"  inside  and  outside  our  activity.    	The  cell  is  a  group  of  "camrades"
			  	in  areas  of  agriculture,   	industry  and  education.    	The  National  Assembly  composition
			  	of  the  Istiqlal  Party  (with  400  caaanitted  party  men)   	gives  evidence  of  the  class
			  	compesition  of  our  staffs.    	They  are  all  working  people  of  modest  social  status,
			  	as  is  L-he  situation  with  the  Organization  of  the  General  Federation  of  3tudents  of
			  	Morocco  and  the  Organization  of  the  General  Federation  of  Moroccan  Workers.
			  	/guestion/  What  was  Allal  E1  Fassi's  role  in  the  Moroccan  national  movement  and  the
			  	Istiqlal  Party  specifically?    	Why  is  it  said  that  your  party  lost  its  allure  after
			  	the  death  of  E1  Fassi?
			  	/Answer/  Allal  E1  Fassi  was   	the  founder  of  the  natianal  movement.    	He  worked  con-
			  	stantly  to  this  end  from  the  time  he  was  15.    	He  based  his  mass  struggle  on  a
			  	feeling  for  social  justice  when  he  regulated  the  conditions  for  the  apportionment
			  	of  water  in  the  city  of  Fez.    	He  was  a  poet  on  public  occasions,  which  made  him  a
 _			 	goinr  of  atL�raction  for  broad  masses  of  people,   	especially  among  the  classes  of
			   	tradesmen  and  small  manufacturers.    	He  then  began  to  give  free  classes,  which  drew

			the  hational  Action  Bloc  was  founded.    	It  held  its  first  organizational  meeting
			and  elected  Allal  as  its  head  although  competitors  were  present.    	His  Istiqlal
			Party  leadership  goes  back  to  this  period.    	He  was  in  exile  9  years  in  Gabon,   	on
			grounds  that  he  was   	the  greatest  enemy  of  colonialism,  until   	1946,  when  he  returned
			to  Morocco.    	After  a  few  months  the  French  came  to  t�iew  him  as  a  threat  and  banish-
			ed  him  to  Cairo  and   	the  eastern  Arab  world.    	Then  he  settled  in  Tangiers,  whieh  was
			under  the  aegis  of  international  government.    	From  Tangiers  he  arranged  the  affairs
			of  the  Istiqlal.  Party  until  1952,  when  he  set  out  over  all  areas  of  the  country,
			spreading  word  of  the  need  for  Moroccan  independence.    	He  attended  the  Bandung  Con-
		 	ference.    	After  the  protectorate  left  Morocco,   	he  returned  and  remained  as  a  leader
		 	of  the  nationalists  until  his  death.
		 	/guestion/  National  movements  in  the  Arab  world  are  opposition  movements,   	except  in
			Morocco,   	where  they  are  a  basic  part  of  the  loyal  majority.    	Is  there  a  discreiancy
		 	here,   	and  what  is  it?
		 	/Answer/  The  Moroccan  national  movement  differs  from  movements  in  the  Arab  east.
		 	It  has  a  national  rather  than  a  political  one.    	It  arose  to  combat  colonialism.    	We
		 	do  not  consider   	the  monarchy  a  chance  phenomenon.    	It  is   	the  spiritual  and  moral
		 	framework  of  the  Moroccan  nation.    	Since  Islam  came  to  Morocco,  we  have  been  linked
		 	to  the  monarch  and   	the  people  have  pledged  a  conditional  loyalty  to  it.    	Since  in-
		 	dependence,   	in  particular,  we  have  considered  the  monarchy  part  of  the  identity  of
		 	the  Moroccan  people.    	Our  struggle  in  the  Sahara  today  shows   	the  profound  solida-
		 	rity  between  the  people  and  the  king.    	The  march  we  held  uras  a  crystallization  of
 -			liberation  activity  which  the  people  carried  out  under  the  leadership  of  the  king.
		 	Thus  our  participation  is  not  political  but  one  of  destiny,   	a  matter  of  identity.
 -			When  we  were  in  opposition  between  1963  and  1977,  we  exercised  the  right  of  refusal
		 	or  veto  over  irresponsible  pxactices  on  the  part  of  administration  figures.
		 	The  Accomplishments  of  Democracy
		 	/suestion/  How  does   	the  Istiqlal  Party  appraise  the  current  democratic  experiment,
		 	in  terms  of  gains  and  weak  points  alike?
		 	/Answer/  The  experiment  is  a  new  one  in  any  event  and  springs  from  the  Moroccan
		 	people,  who  took  the  risk  of  formulating  the  democratic  vision.    	It  may  be  charac-
		  	terized  by  two  phenomena:
		  	1.    	That  of  achievements:    	We  have  paved  the  way  toward  freedom  and  organizations
		  	such  as  parliament,   	local  councils  and  a  party  life  aimed  at  training  and  enlight-
		  	ening  citizens,   	proposing  laws  and  discussing  government  programs.
		  	2.    	That  of  the  opposition:    	T'his  is  one  of  the  fundamental  freedoms,   	taking  for
		  	example  the  form  of  refusing  to  vote  for  plans  which  people  in  the  opposition  con-
		  	sider  are  devoid  of  harmony  and  effectiveness.    	The  democratic  experiment  in
		  	Morocco  is  o  success  in  spite  of  certain  slips  it  has  made,  which  may  be  ascribed
 -		 	to  its  immaturity.
		  	There  is  no  doubt   	that  the  Istiqlal  Party  has  taken  part  in  the  crystallization  of
		  	this  experiment.    	Our  struggle  has  been  going  on  since  1925,   	although  goals  and
		  	directions  have  changed.    	Today  we  are  engaged  in  combatting  backwardness,   	illiter-
		  	acy  and  religious  and  intellectual  deviation  and  are  striving  toward  socio-economic

			   	liberation,  basing  ourselves  on  an  ideology  which  springs  from  the  actual  situation
			   	of  M~rocco.    	We  also  present  solutions  which  are  inspired  by  the  Islamic  religion,
			   	and  of  course  we  benefit  from  the  experiences  of  others,  with  the  intention  of  drink-
			   	ing  directly  from  Arab  and  Islamic  springs.
			   	/guestion/  Does  that  mean  that  the  Istiqlal  Party  does  not  believe  in  socialism  or
			   	struggle  among  classes,  and,   	if  so,  don't  you  believe  that  there  is  a  class  struggle
			   	in  Morocco  which  you  are  trying  to  conceal  with  nationalist  religiou3  slogans?
			   	/Answer/  At  the  ~ifth  Istiqlal  Par~y  conference  which  met  in  early  1960,  we  set
			   	forth  the  theore~~iGal  foundations  of  Istiqlal  ideology.    	This  ideology  is  based  on
			    	liberalization,   	essentially,  expresses  the  state  of  Moroccan  society,  and  lays  out
			    	the  future  lines  of  development  of  this  society.    	Thus  we  do  not  believe  in  social-
			   	ism.    	We  propound  a  socioeconomic  credo  which  we  call  egalitarianism.
			   	/4uestion/  What  is  the  gist  of  this  egalitarianism?			.
			   	/Answer/  Egalitarianism  holds  that  it  is  necessary  to  restrict  the  difference  be-
			    	tween  classes  as  a  first  step  in  establishing  a  society  without  classes.    	This  con-
			   	dition  eliminates   	the  class  struggle  by  granting  citizens  equal  opportunities   	to
			   	struggle  to  improve  their  standard  of  living.    	In  the  context  of  egalitarianism,
			   	peasants  can  flourish  because  they  are  granted  access  to  expertise,   	loans,  equality,
			   	fair  wages,   	housing  and  medical  care.    	Egalitarianism  lays  emphasis  on  the  estab-
			    	lishment  of  an  economic  structure  which  benefits  from  capital,  directives,  national-
			   	ization  of  the  basic  sources  of  production  in  the  country,   	the  promotion  of  decen-
			    	tralization  and  encouragement  of  national  savings.
			    	/Question/  Why  do  the  people  in  Istiqlal  reject  the  principles  of  scientific  social-
			   	ism?
			    	/Answe~/  Socialist  theories  are  predictable,  and  they  have  given  birth  to  notions
			   	which  for  the  most  part  have  failed.    	In  addition,   	scientific  socialism  is  apostasy,
 -			  	:ohile  egalitarianism  believes  in  religion,   	religion  as  belief  and  conduct.    	It  is
			    	~orrect  Islamic  form,   	ir  inspires  intellectual,  palitical  and  economic  activity.
			   	Belief  in  God  liberates  man  fxom  superstition  and  links  him  to  the  fully-rounded
			   	ma3e1  of  the  upright  life  which  Islam  has  portrayed,   	in  terms  of  individual  and
			   	coliective  freedom  and  social  justice,  on  grounds  that  money  is  an  inexhaustible
			   	means   	to  free  mnn  from  capitalism,  usury,  human  daminance  and  greed.    	It  is  un-
			    	fortunate  that  the  slogan  of  socialism  is  generally  embraced  to  conceal  totalitar-
			    	ian  military  apparatuses,   	in  third  world  countries  especially.    	Today  there  are
			   	different  socialisms,  not  a  single  one,  whereas  there  is  a  single  Moroccan  egali-
			    	tarianism,  which  the  Istiqlal  Party  defends.
 -			  	/Question/  The  French  thinker  Henri  Febvre,   	in  his  book  "An  Introduction  to  the
  ~			  	New  Spirit,"  says  that  %the  term/  scientific  socialism  has  been  used  by  the  social-
			    	ist  regimes  established  according  to  the  criteria  of  some  people  in  Asia  and  Latin
			   	America  and  that  its  prime  objective  is  to  establish  a  society  without  classes.
			    	/Answer/  Whatever  the  diverse  fornns  of  socialism  might  be,   	they  entertain  a  materi-
			    	alistic  view  of  life  and  of  people  and  ignore  unknown  forces  and  spiritual  values.
			   	Et~en  the  society  liberated  from  classes  which  it  wants  to  build  presupposes  the

		 	among  people.    	That  does  not  mean  that  egalitarian  ideology  does  not  adhere  to  the

		  	the  principles  of  egalitarianism  in  actual  conditions?    	What  achievement  have  you

		  	program  ir_  order  to  avoid  "balkanizing  govertm?ent  action."    	Is  this  true?
		  	/Answer/  I  do  not  believe  that  the  Istiqlal  group  in  the  cabinet  has  made  basi~
		  	concessions   	concerning  the  programs  and  plans  it  presents  in  the  cabinet.    	The  road
		  	we  are  following  is   	that  of  struggling  to  support  our  principles  to  realize  maay  of
		  	our  ideas   	through  democratic  channels.The  ministries  the  IstiqlAl  people  occupy  are
		  	of  importance  in  the  current  lineup,   	since  we  are  able  to  fill  the  gap  among  class-
 -		 	es.    	For  example,   	the  minister  of  education  belongs  to  the  Istiqlal  and  he  is  work-
		  	ing  to  ensure  an  education  for  all  people  and  to  shift  courses  into  the  Arabic  lan-
		  	gnage.    	~hese  are  orientations  that  have  been  at  the  core  of  the  Istiqlal  program
		  	since  the  days  of  the  national  movement.    	Let  us  not  forget  the  importance  of  lan-
		  	guage  unification  in  drawing  ranks  together  on  the  national  level  and  making  the
 =		 	struggle  against  backwardness  effective.    	There  are  the  two  Ministries  of  Equipment
		  	and  Housing,  which  are  both  striving  to  raise  the  level  of  the  downtrodden  classes
		  	and  create  modern  public  structures  and  utilities.    	These  equations  lie  within  the
		  	framework  of  the  development  upsurge  which  all  Moroccans  are  benefitting  from.
		  	Unfair  Accusations
		   	/guestion/  There  is  unanimity  in  Moroccan  political  and  party  c~.rcles  that  the
		   	Istiqlal  Party  can  be  characterized  by  paralysis.    	Same  of  these  circles  criticize
		   	it  for  failing  to  develop  and  keep  abreast  of  the  pace  of  current  challenges  and
		   	hold  that  the  same  persons  are  in  decisionmaking  positions  and  are  geographically
		   	and  intellectually  characterized  by  a  conservative  attitude.    	It  is  stated,   	for
		   	instance,   	that  most  of  the  Istiqlal  leaders  are  from  the  city  of  Fez.    	What  about
		   	this?
		   	/Answer/  This  talk  is  part  of  the  unfair  charges   	that  are  directed  against  the
		   	Istiqlal  Party.    	Tradition  does  not  mean  that  we  are  living  in  another  time  and
		   	place,   	and   	the  preservation  of  intellectual  and  moral  principles  and  standards  does
		   	not  mean  that  we  have  became  petrified.    	I  believe  that  we  are  zealously  keeping  up
		   	with  the  pace  of  the  times  and  are  sparing  no  effort  in  developing  and  renewing
		   	our  party  staffs   	and  ideas.    	The  charge  of  introversion  has  become  an  old  one,   	es-

			   	[Text]    	The  mining  of  ores  should  develop  an  a  large  scale  in  the  Sudan  in  the
			   	next  few  years,   	in  view  of  the  ma.ny  contracts  in  embryonic  stages  at  the  present
			   	time  in  this   	field  and  of  the  important  research  in  progress.    	Chrome,  tnica  and
			   	gypsum,  and  gold  are  the  minerals  being  worked  at  this  time,  with  a  low,  but  con-
			   	stantly  increasing,   	*:ate  of  production,   	especially  for  chrome.    	In  1979,   	30,000
			   	tons  of  chrome  ore,   	2,000  tons  of  mica  and  about  15,000  tons  of  gypsum  were  pro-
			   	duced.
			   	In  this  field  of  research,  a  large  number  of  pro~ects  are  under  way:
			   	A  study  and  prospecting  campaign  in  the  Bayunda  desert  north  of  Khartoum  by  the
			   	geological  studies  department  of  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mine~,  with  Germa.n
			   	technical  assistance.    	This  campaign  made  it  possible  to  detect  traces  of  disthene.
			   	The  Kloeckner  company  is  studying,  at  this  stage,   	the  formation  of  a  joint  venture
			   	for  working  this  deposit.    	Another  research  and  exploration  phase  is  now  under  way
			   	in  the  Nuba  Mountains,  and  copper  deposits  have.apparently  been  discovered.
			   	Frospecting  for  uranium  by  the  Minex  company   	(United  States)  in  the  northern  part
  -			 	of  the  Nuba  Mountains  and  for  gold  in  the  western  part  of  the  Red  Sea  Hills  in  the
			   	Nubian  desert.
			   	A  search  for  uranium  and  copper  in  the  Hofrat  el  Nahaz   	(South  Darfour)  by  the
			   	Chevron  company   	(United  States).
			   	Prospecting  for  diamonds  by  a  United  Nations  team  (UNDP)   	in  the  south  of  the  coun-
			   	trq.															~
			   	A  search  for  gold  by  Belgian  technical  assistance  in  the  south.
			   	The  prospecting  phase  developed  several  years  ago  by  the  French  Geological  and
			   	Mineral  Prospecting  ~ffice   	(GMPO),  with  the  geological  studies  department  of  the
   	,				Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines,  made  it  possible  to  detect  the  presence  of  various

	 	,		   	GMPO  and  the  French  Petroleum  Company   	(FPC)   	are  expected  shortly  to  finalize  the

			 	RESTORATION  OF  WHITE  NILE  PUI~ING  STATIONS  REVIEWED
			 	Paris  MARCHES  TROPICAUX  ET  MEDITERRANEENS  in  French  15  May  81  p  1354
			 	[TextJ    	In  our  issue  of  last  3  April   	(p  938),  we  published  a  note  on  the  project
			 	for  the  restoration  of  the  Blue  Nile  pumping  stations,   	to  which  the  African  Devel-
			 	opment  Bank  and  the  World  Bank  group  are  making  their  contribution.    	A  similar
			 	project  is  under  way  for  the  White  Nile.
			 	The  project  for  the  restoration  of  the  White  Nile  pumping  stations  has  as  its
			 	goal  reviving,   	in  5  years,   	the  some  174  irrigated  farms  bordering  the  White  Nile
			 	south  of  Khartoum,  where  cotton,   	sor~hum  and  wheat  are  grown.    	The  result  of  this
  -		     	would  be  an  increase  in  productivity,   	a  rise  in  cotton  exports,   	increased  resources
			 	for  the  farmers  and  a  better  financial  balance  for  the  farms.    	The  receipts  ex-
			 	pected  for  the  public  sector  are  on  the  order  of  370  million  Sudanese  pounds,  and
			 	the  number  of  families  directly  concerned  is  28,000.
			 	To  achieve  these  objectives,   	the  following  means  will  be  made  available  to  the
			 	farms:    	agricultural  mechanization  and  equipment;   	financial  means;  worksh~ps  and
			 	facilities  for  fuel  starage;  vehicles  and  a  teleco~unications  network;   	the
			 	modernization  of  pumps  and  the  irrigation  network;   	the  construction  of  offices,
			 	stores  and  housing  for  the  training  personnel.    	In  addition,  measures  will  be
 -				taken  to  encourage  sound  management  and  administration  of  the  projects,  and
			 	studies  will  be  made  in  order  to  help  the  future  development  of  this  region.
			 	Among  the  most  serious  risks  that  could  hinder  the  realization  of  this  project,
			 	we  should  note  shortages  and  delays  in  implementation  of  local  means,   	failure
			 	to  achieve  anticipated  production,   	a  shortage  of  foreign  currency,  bad  management.
			 	Measures  have  already  been  taken  to  solve  these  problems.
			 	The  World  Bank  has  granted  a  sum  of  $35  million  to  finance  this  project.
