 CHINA:  DOMESTIC POLITICAL OVERVIEW
 Executive Summary
 The post-Mao era in Chinese politics has seen a
 major change in the way Chinese leaders handle their
 personal and political rivalries and the effect these
 political problems have on the country at large.
 Gone is the extreme polarization of the late 1960s and
 early 1970s when leftists, whose primary concern was
 political struggle, and rightists, whose preoccupation
 was the problem of nation building, clashed repeatedly.
 In this earlier period, policies were put into prac-
 tice with great fanfare and then suddenly shelved;
 political leaders wielded enormous power and then lost
 their jobs.
 Today, there are several leading officials who
 together form the decisionmaking core.  While they differ
 sharply over how to carry out some policies, they are
 in general agreement on the broad outlines of China's
 priorities and policies.  Consequently, a basic policy
 to embark on economic modernization remains fixed de-
 spite disputes over concrete measures to take.  Poli-
 cies have been scaled down, redirected, or otherwise
 modified but not reversed.  This is true of even such

 Introduction
 Political life in China has undergone a major trans-
 formation since the deaths in 1976 of China's two politi-
 cal giants, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.  Although the
 loss of these men was neither sudden nor surprising,
 Chinese political leaders were ill prepared for the
 consequences.  Zhou's death was followed by a marked
 upsurge in disruptive political maneuvering by the so-
 called Gang of Four, extremists headed by Mao's wife
 who had little interest in the nuts and bolts of running
 a country but enormous concern with the political re-
 liability of people in all walks of life.  Zhou's
 chosen successor as Premier, the abrasive but able and
 popular Deng Xiaoping, was ousted from the leadership
 in early 1976 and his many supporters were in danger
 This period of heightened political tension came
 to an abrupt end with Mao's death in September 1976 and
 the summary arrest a month later of the Gang of Four.
 The arrest brought to a close more than 10 years of
 extreme polarization in the leadership and was greeted
 with national euphoria.  It left the remaining leaders,
 however, somewhat uncertain about how to apportion power
 among themselves, what to do first to repair the damage
 of losing their political lives.

 been moved into position during Mao's lifetime, and his
 promotion was perhaps the easiest decision of the im-

 group not necessarily wedded to the tenets of Commu-
 nist ideology.  Deng seems to believe that only by con-
 demning the past can an atmosphere be created in which
 people will feel free to experiment boldly with new
 techniques and policies in order to further the primary
 goal of modernizing the economy.
 Deng's opponents, including but by no means re-
 stricted to Hua, fear the disruptive effects of so sharp
 a break with the past.  They put a premium on political
 stability now as the only hope for creating an environ-
 ment conducive to steady economic growth.  A purge of
 the few top officials and the many middle and lower
 level officials who were promoted during the. Cultural
 Revolution, they believe, would paralyze people with
 fear and prevent them from taking any initiatives in
 the economic sphere.  A denunciation of Mao and of the
 recent past would have a destabilizing effect, casting
 doubt on the legitimacy of all of the late Chairman's
 policies, including his selection of Hua as his suc-
 cessor, and creating confusion about the legitimacy of
 This group recognizes, as Deng does, the residual
 influence of the Cultural Revolution and all it repre-
 sented.  Unlike Deng, it wants to enlist the support
 of the true believers of the Cultural Revolution by
 allowing them another chance, by not calling into ques-
 tion everything they believe in, and indeed by acknowledcl-
 ing that some policies of that era were correct.
 The shifts in policy in the two years since Deng's
 return have occurred when one or the other group held
 sway.  Significantly, these were not the sharp twists
 and turns of the last decade, when leaders were in funda-
 mental disagreement over the direction of policies, but
 were modifications, adjustments, matters of degree.  The
 wisdom of trying to modernize the economy has not been
 at issue, nor has a greater involvement of the outside
 world in order to achieve modernization.  But even over
 the relatively narrow issue of how to implement a par-
 ticular policy, or how far to push it, the Chinese lead-
 ership, with its penchant for internecine struggle,
 has found much to argue over.  If this has not resulted
 in policy changes or the ouster of individual leaders,
 it has caused modifications of policies and the reduc-
 tion of the political power of several leaders.

 Deng on the March
 From the time of his return, Deng moved quickly to
 put his personal stamp on Chinese policies.  At no point
 was he without opposition,. but he advanced on so many
 fronts in ways that captured a good deal of public and
 official support that he enjoyed enormous success.  At
 the same time, however, the boldness of his initiatives
 and his refusal to accommodate even the slightest
 criticism of his policies sowed the seeds of stiffer,
 more successful opposition down the road.
 The economic modernization program is not Deng's
 alone and was in fact first announced by Zhou Enlai in
 1964.  Many of the specifics of the program,. however,.
 as outlined in 1977-78, were distinctively Deng's.
 These included turning to the outside world for help
 to a degree probably well beyond what Zhou Enlai had
 in mind.  Deng seemed willing to go much further than
 other Chinese officials in accepting foreign loans,
 entering into joint ventures and concessionary arrange-
 ments, inviting foreign technicians to train Chinese
 technicians in China, and sending thousands of scientists
 and students abroad to do research and to study.  Deng
 won the support of workers with a long-awaited pay raise
 and secured the loyalty of intellectuals when he stood
 Maoist orthodoxy on its head by proclaiming that intel-
 lectuals are part of the laboring class and therefore not
 politically suspect.  Scientists commanded Deng's par-
 ticular attention and were cheered by his personal pledge
 to allow them to do research unencumbered by party
 politics.
 Other policies even more basic to Deng's vision
 of a rapidly modernizing China drew less applause and
 in some cases sent shock waves throughout Chinese of-
 ficialdom.  A gradual effort to dismantle the Mao legacy
 took a dramatic step forward last March with a public
 denunciation of the last 18 years of Mao's life.  De-
 Maoization inevitably cast aspersions on Mao's chosen
 heir, Hua Guofeng, who came under more direct attack
 than at any time since he rose to the party chairman-
 ship.
 Deng's emphasis on discarding Maoist thinking and
 finding new solutions to new problems spawned opposi-
 tion among Mao's personal disciples, who feared that a

 wholesale denigration of Mao's precepts would undermine
 their political positions.  Public repudiations of
 specific incidents during the Cultural Revolution were
 discomfiting to survivors of that period and threatened
 to revive bitter feuds.  Deng launched a major campaign
 aimed clearly at removing from office some senior of-
 ficials with whom he had personal and policy differences
 in the past, while moving trusted lieutenants into key
 party, government, and military posts.  And he personally
 endorsed a relaxation of political controls on the popu-
 lace to encourage open discussion of China's policies
 and leaders and even its system of government.
 The Retrenchment
 Early this year, the political opposition engendered
 by Deng's programs, the apparent or prospective failure
 of some of them, and the unacceptable consequences of
 others combined to force Deng to retreat.  The excesses
 of the economic program were trimmed, Deng's reevaluation
 of the Maoist past came to a sudden stop, "democracy"
 was assailed as anarchic, and Deng's political oppo-
 nents became more active.  Deng's own political stand-
 ing reached its lowest point this spring when he was
 more heavily criticized than at any time since he re-
 The leadership, guided by senior economic special-
 ists, took a hard look at the specifics of the economic
 modernization program and concluded it was unrealistic.
 In its rush to buy foreign plants and technology, to
 send people abroad for training, to engage in capital
 construction at home, and to expose middle-level of-
 ficials to the Western world, China was spending more
 money than it could afford.  None of these programs
 have been scrapped, but they have all been scaled down
 and implemented more selectively.  Goals deemed un-
 realistically high were reset at levels still ambitious
 but more likely within reach; priorities were redirected
 away from heavy industry and back toward agriculture.
 Deng admitted that he was criticized for the mod-
 ernization program.  As he himself claimed, he was not
 the only leader to be blamed, but he unquestionably
 created a climate that allowed if not encouraged China
 to overextend itself.  His highly publicized trips to

 the United States and Japan, shown to a Chinese audience
 in part to enhance his political image, probably caused
 him additional problems.  The material benefits of these

 Deng's policies in the political and social arenas
 got him into even more hot water.  He was privately
 criticized for promoting de-Maoization; his emphasis
 on a flexible, pragmatic approach to problem solving
 and his concurrent deemphasis on the rote application
 of orthodox Communist solutions--summed up in the slogans
 these expectations.
 Perhaps most damaging for Deng, because it raised
 questions about his judgment, was the disintegration of
 the "democracy" movement into social disorder.  Chinese
 tolerance was stretched to the breaking point when
 people left their places of work to petition for a re-
 dress of personal grievances or disrupted production by
 striking for better living conditions.  Even more appall-
 ing for the straitlaced Chinese was the activity of

 behavior.  The calls for human rights and the direct

 embarrassing for the Chinese and more than anything
 else precipitated the crackdown on "democracy".  Ring-

 ficial publications.  Deng, who had unleashed the "dem-
 ocracy" movement, issued the call to rein it in.

 Deng's Counterattack
 In mid-May, Deng began to use the media to lash
 out at his critics and to reassert his favorite themes--
 the fallibility of Mao, the need for "democracy" as
 a prerequisite for economic modernization, and "seeking
 truth from facts" as an inviolate principle of Chinese
 Communism.  He attacked as "leftists" those who claimed
 that the "democracy" movement had gone too far or
 who had opposed "seeking truth from facts" because it
 Gradually, and probably somewhat grudgingly, these
 favorite themes of Deng's have won acceptance again in
 Chinese political life.  This has not been an unqualified
 victory for Deng, however.  He has had to temper his
 views to make them more acceptable to a broader range
 within the leadership.  The fallibility of Mao, discussed
 less often now, is not treated in terms of specific mis-
 takes he made and always includes an acknowledgment
 of his overall greatness.  The defense of democracy is
 coupled with a definition of and warnings against such
 "excesses" as actions and statements derogating socialism.

 of the Cultural Revolution.
 In the area of ideological reform, Deng has made no
 effort to tailor his views to suit a wider audience.
 He has mobilized an impressive array of influential
 officials to endorse publicly his pragmatic approach.
 The media readily admit, however, that ideological re-
 form is still being discussed nationwide, and not all
 propaganda outlets have supported Deng on this issue.
 Although Deng has repeatedly been thwarted in his
 efforts to remove from the leadership those officials
 with whom he has crossed swords in the past, and in
 particular those who are trying to preserve the Mao
 legacy intact, he continues to chip away at their insti-
 tutional bases of support.  They retain seats, but ap-
 parently without specific portfolios, in the ruling
 councils of the party and government.  At the National
 People's Congress, China's legislature that concluded
 a two-week session in early July, Deng's opponents were
 criticized for economic malfeasance as well as political
 error, but this criticism ultimately was muted and no
 specific steps were taken against the transgressors.

 The New Political Balance
 The events surrounding the National People's Congress
 typify a somewhat changed political situation and a
 new look for the Chinese leadership.  The congress
 focused on the revamped economic development program
 and gave pride of place to the economic specialists in
 the leadership.  These men, led by party Vice Chairman
 and new economic czar Chen Yun, have emerged as a new
 interest group that is committed to economic moderniza-
 tion at a more measured pace than that set by Deng
 Xiaoping.  The political power that has accrued to this
 group is evident in the new prominence of vice premier
 Li Xiannian, long the leadership's senior economic special-
 ist, who seems to have inherited some of Deng's func-   -
 tions; Li, for example, has often filled Deng's usual
 role as host to high-ranking delegations from the United
 There is clearly a greater diffusion of influence
 within the leadership.  In addition to the economic
 specialists, a number of newly rehabilitated victims
 of the Cultural Revolution played major roles at the
 congress and won important posts in the government.
 These men were senior political figures in the past and
 probably played a central role in current decision-
 Premier Hua Guofeng, too, is enjoying enhanced
 prominence.  He gave the major address to the congress,
 in which he took the middle ground between the extremist
 views of Deng and those of Deng's chief detractors.  The
 middle of the road, Hua's usual position, is also oc-
 cupied by other leaders, especially the economic special-
 ists.  Hua therefore appeared to be speaking for a majority
 in the leadership.  He cautiously embraced Deng's "seek-
 ing truth from facts" although he shied away from the
 bolder aspects of de-Maoization such as the fallibility
 of the man himself and a negative assessment of the Cul-
 tural Revolution.  He gave qualified approval to "demo-
 cratic" activity and emphasized the importance of "unity
 and stability" to the success of modernization, a notion

 The increasing prominence of other members of the
 leadership underscores Deng's own low profile.  He
 played no role at the congress, the only major event
 since his return two years ago in which he failed to
 participate.  He undoubtedly supported the congress's
 outline of a detailed legal code and procedures to give
 ordinary Chinese a greater sense of participation in
 their government.  He probably also supported the new
 personnel appointments, but his own closest associates
 were not named to government positions.
 There .apparently has been a deliberate effort to
 clip Deng's wings a bit to bring him more into line with
 the views of others in the leadership and to give other
 officials a more prominent role.  Deng apparently will
 do no more foreign traveling, at least in ari official
 capacity, a decision he revealed even as Hua's once-
 postponed trip to West Europe was rescheduled for this
 autumn.  He also appears to have relinquished his posi-
 tion as Army Chief of Staff.
 Deng probably will have some difficulty adjusting
 to his new role, one that takes him down a few pegs
 from the perch he used to enjoy but that still leaves
 him as one of the most influential members of the lead-
 ership.  He is not confronted with the bitter political
 rivals of the sort who overthrew him during the Cultural
 Revolution but with a group of men--many similar to him
 in age and experience--who share his basic policy con-
 cerns but do not necessarily approve of his methods.
 The adjustments to Deng's policies probably enhance
 the prospects for their survival.  It is clear now that
 the unbridled enthusiasm Deng generated last year would
 have led to economic disaster had not cooler heads pre-
 vailed.  Just as important, Deng's inclination to ride
 roughshod over his weaker opponents would have created
 rifts in the leadership as wide as those of the recent
 ~               past.                                                         25X1
 The compromises that China's leaders seem to have
 worked out in recent months do not eliminate the pos-
 sibility of either economic or political upheavals in
 the future.  Indeed turmoil seems very much in the cards
 when the current leaders, most of whom are in their
 seventies, pass from the scene.  But for now, the chances
 for orderly progress toward rational goals have markedly

 CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY:  AN OVERVIEW
 Executive Summary
 During the past two years, China has continued to
 refine its strategy of maintaining the international
 status quo by resisting the expansion of Soviet influ-
 ence.  This strategy resulted from China's ideological
 and military conflict with the USSR that started in the
 late 1950s.  It is based on China's sense of its own
 weakness and is consequently defensive, but this defen-
 siveness does not diminish China?s inherent sense of its
 own importance or its interest in projecting its influ-
 ence abroad.  A central aspect of this strategy is a
 political tilt toward the United States, Japan, and
 Europe designed to offset the Soviet threat to China
 while Beijing obtains Western credits, technology, apd
 arms for its long-term self-strengthening programs.
 The deterioration of relations with Vietnam has com-
 plicated Beijing's planning by imposing increased defense
 costs, causing large numbers of refugees to flee to China,
 and inviting a stronger Soviet presence in Southeast Asia.
 China's invasion of Vietnam in February raised Sino-Soviet
 tensions to their highest point in a decade.
 Shortly thereafter, Beijing denounced the long-dormant
 1950 Sino-Soviet Treaty.  To achieve the tactical expe-
 dient of reducing the dangerously high level of tension
 in Sino-Soviet relations, however, Beijing paired its

 Introduction
 Basic to understanding Chinese foreign policy is an
 awareness of China's perception of threats to its survival.
 The Chinese have faced threats from menacing and often
 technologically superior enemies to the north for thou-
 sands of years.  The Great Wall was the first, monumental
 effort to keep predatory nomads from swooping down on
 the agricultural population in the north China plain.
 In recent centuries the Chinese have also faced threats
 from the south and along the eastern coast.  The Chinese
 usually dealt with these threats by aligning with the
 In the aftermath of World War II and the subsequent
 civil war, Beijing's hold on the country was still chal-
 lenged by the Chinese Nationalists on Taiwan.  The United
 States, then indisputably the mightiest power in the
 world, was seen backing the Nationalists' threat to re-
 turn to the mainland.  At the same time, the Soviet Union,
 ruled by ideologically like-minded people, was willing
 to assist the Chinese Communists consolidate their power
 and modernize their industry and military.  Beijing there-

 The Sino-Soviet alliance, formalized in a 1950
 treaty, was China'?s insurance policy against the United
 States, Japan, and the Nationalists.  Its importance to
 Beijing grew when the Korean war erupted and the United
 States was perceived as preparing to move against China
 once the Korean Peninsula had been pacified.  The Sino-
 Soviet alliance grew increasingly strained, however, as
 the Chinese chafed under Soviet efforts to meddle in
 Chinese politics and to dictate the ideological line.
 The Sino-Soviet Rift
 By the late 1950s, the breach in Sino-Soviet rela-
 tions was widening rapidly.  The Soviets abruptly halted
 their assistance programs and demanded repayment despite

 the hard times in China following the failure of Mao's
 social experiments.  This bitter experience intensified
 Chinese resentment, reducing Sino-Soviet relations to
 near nonexistence.
 The foreign policy consequences of China's Great
 Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-69) were isolation
 and weakness.  Although the Sino-Soviet Treaty continued
 to exist on paper, the Soviets and--to a much lesser
 extent--the Chinese had rapidly built up their forces
 along the length of the Sino-Soviet frontier and in
 Mongolia.  By 1968, Beijing faced enemies to the north
 (the USSR), the south (the US forces in Viet-
 nam), and the east (Taiwan, which was united in a security
 treaty with the United States).  China's only trusted
 ally was remote, feckless Albania.
 At this point, some of China's leaders began to
 question this isolationism and to recognize the need for
 change.  One major spur toward a new policy was China's
 inability in 1968 to dissuade Vietnam from attending US-
 proposed peace talks in Paris.  The Vietnamese followed
 Soviet advice to go to Paris despite the dogmatic urgings
 of the Chinese, who for years had worked hard to assist
 Hanoi and build influence there.  The Soviet invasion of
 Czechoslovakia in August, and the subsequent iteration
 of the Brezhnev doctrine of "limited sovereignty" for
 "socialist" states convinced Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai
 that new policies were needed.  The Chinese also began
 to perceive that the United States was on its way out
 of Vietnam, and thus was a waning threat to China.
 The Turn to the United States
 Tentative signs began to appear in China of a de-
 sire to improve relations with the United States and to
 rebuild China's diplomatic apparatus.  The first major
 step came in late 1968 when the Chinese agreed that
 ambassadorial talks be resumed in Warsaw the following

 policy that would have put increased power into his
 hands as Defense Minister.  This unwillingness to make
 commitments to foreigners went beyond mere jockeying for
 power.  In a deeper sense, Lin appealed to a conservative
 tradition in Chinese thought that has appeared in every
 generation, one that is repelled by close relationships
 with outsiders and is deeply suspicious of introducing
 foreign ideas into China.
 In 1969-71, Mao and Zhou moved to isolate Lin Biao
 politically.  Their efforts were aided by the first
 major armed clash along the Sino-Soviet border in March
 1969, and an even more intense firefight on the border
 the following August.  These events demonstrated China's
 vulnerability to Soviet military pressure and the need
 for lines to other countries.  Anew call then went out
 for the Warsaw talks to begin, and anti-US commentary
 diminished in the Chinese media.  Zhou Enlai also moved
 diplomatically to manage Sino-Soviet tensions by agree-
 ing to meet Premier Kosygin at Beijing's airport in
 September 1969, and by setting up a framework for border
 talks which still continue sporadically.  Outmaneuvered,

 In the period 1971-73, China made rapid diplomatic
 gains, displacing Taiwan in the United Nations and open-

 essentially stopped putting its foreign dealings to an
 ideological test.  It showed a strong preference for the
 status quo, urging countries to form regional groupings
 to resist Soviet inroads.  There are variations on this
 theme, such as in southern Africa, where China supports
 change but opposes Soviet influence.  Beijing's primary
 concern was and still is that the influence of the
 Soviet Union be contained and not permitted to develop
 into an overwhelming preponderance of power--or "hege-
 monism."  A corollary of this Chinese view is that the

 Four in October 1976, the way was once again cleared for
 an activist foreign policy.  By mid-1977, Deng Xiaoping,
 who had fallen in early 1976, returned to power and
 immediately set about resto momentum to China's
 foreign policy.
 The "Theory of the Three Worlds"
 To justify this pragmatic strategy in ideological
 terms, Beijing published "Chairman Mao's Theory of the
 Three Worlds" in November 1977.  This document elabo-
 rated the policies initiated in 1969, arguing that the
 USSR constitutes the "main danger" to world peace and
 that a "united front" of countries opposed to the USSR
 was needed to counter this danger.  This "aritihegemonist
 united front" is to include the less developed countries
 of the "third world" and the developed countries of the
 "second world."  The role of the United States, as one of
 the "superpowers" in the "first world," remains ambiguous,
 suggesting that as long as it does not replace the USSR
 as the "main danger," it is welcome to join in resisting
 Until China acquires sufficient power and prestige
 to counter the USSR more directly, it is forced by cir-
 cumstances to rely on the United States as the main pil-
 lar of its strategy.  The Chinese recognize that, in
 order to make this strategy work, the United States and
 China must cooperate, at least to the point where Soviet
 defense planners become unsure to what degree the two
 countries would cooperate during a Soviet crisis with
 either of them.  Theoretically, each side in the triangle
 can attempt to improve relations with another in order to
 extract advantage from the third.  In late 1977, for ex-
 ample, China tried to demonstrate its maneuverability in
 the triangle by making small but conspicous gestures to
 the USSR.  In practice, however, China's vulnerability
 Chinese calculations, nevertheless, are based upon
 the assumption that the United States is a fairly reli-
 able partner with which it can cooperate in attempting
 to contain Soviet power and pressures.  Doubts on this
 issue led to strains in the nascent relationship in the
 1974-76 period.  Recent developments could renew such

 testimony in the US Senate pointing to relative US stra-
 tegic weaknesses in the early 1980s.  A recent commen-
 tary in the People's D, aily, moreover, underlined indica-
 tions of "disarray" in the US domestic and strategic
 position--an unprecedented characterization and one that
 Beijing avoided even in the summer of 1974.
 In addition to strategic inducements to improving
 Sino-US relations, American scientific, technical, and
 financial resources have also been major incentives.
 Beijing, having been stung by overreliance on a single
 benefactor in the 1950s, has an interest in diversifying
 its sources of technology, equipment, and trade.  But
 the US domination of high technology, particularly in
 weapons and deepwater oil drilling, makes American ctood-
 The United States constitutes the last and most
 important foreign support for Beijing's longtime rival,
 the government on Taiwan.  Beijing has viewed reducing
 the US-Taiwan connection less as a means of getting at
 Taiwan than as removing a stumblingblock in the way of
 will invaluable to China's modernization programs.
 Strategic Considerations
 Strategically, China's tilt toward the United
 States continues to be reflected in important state and
 party documents, such as the recent government work re-
 port by Party Chairman and Premier Hua Guofeng to the
 National People's Congress.  Beijing has taken a less
 obstructionist tack in its treatment of the recent SALT
 II agreement and has quietly supported the Egyptian-
 Israeli peace treaty.
 These decisions are sometimes difficult for Chinese
 leaders, who are sensitive to criticism from those who
 still apparently harbor antiforeign views in China and
 who oppose an exposed position in support of the "impe-
 rialist" West.  Cases in point were China's eager and
 visible assistance to Zaire last year after the Shaba
 incident and Chinese support for the Shah of Iran--both
 actions urged on China b  Washin ton.

 The Chinese also remain fundamentally resistant to
 enticements into disarmament negotiations.  Their posi-

 in agreements with militarily superior powers.  There-

 In order to "catch up," the Chinese continue nuclear
 testing, usually in the atmosphere.  They are somewhat
 sensitive to criticism of this practice, but we believe
 they lack the means at present to conduct their testing
 entirely underground.  In difference to the wishes of
 the United States and others, the Chinese have asked
 that their seat be reserved at the UN Disarmament Con-
 ference in Geneva, and observer delegations have been
 sent to the sessions.  Beijing remains unwilling, how-
 ever, to take an active part in the talks for fear of
 eroding its principled position concerning disarmament.
 Beijing is also very skeptical about the mutual and
 balanced force reduction talks in Vienna, emphasizing in
 its media the inability of the conference to resolve im-
 portant East-West differences.  The MBFR talks are a
 matter of concern for the Chinese because the possibil-

 The Chinese see the Soviets attempting to foster Euro-
 pean, Japanese, and US weakness by fomenting and taking
 advantage of political instability in southern Africa,
 the Horn of Africa, and th Middle East in hopes of gain-
 ing control of the major oil routes.  Beijing maintains

 heavily on the possibility the West will not meet the

 challenge.  The unspoken final portion of the Chinese
 argument is that, after Europe, the next Soviet target
 would most likely be China.  Thus, as China's leaders
 have stated privately, Beijing within its limited capa-
 bilities must do its part to counter the Soviets.  Mili-
 tary assistance to Egypt,. including warplanes and spare
 parts, is a recent example.
 Policy Toward Taiwan Since Normalization
 Normalization of US-China relations has reduced,
 but not eliminated the importance of the Taiwan as a
 divisive issue.  For Beijing the economic and strategic
 elements in Sino-US relations still take precedence over
 the recovery of Taiwan.  The evolution of closer rela-
 tions with Washington has been accompanied by a modera-
 tion of Beijing's rhetoric on the issue and a shift in
 emphasis to political and economic approaches to recov-
 ery of the islands which the Chinese consistently say will
 not come for some time.  Beijing has adopted a more open
 stance toward the government on Taiwan, which it now calls
 the "Taiwan authorities"  rather than the pejorative "Tai-
 wan clique."  China has called for talks and the opening
 of trade and postal and aviation services.  Some small but
 politically significant reductions in military strength

 New Links to Japan
 As China was making major gains in its relations
 with the United States, it also moved rapidly in 1978
 to achieve the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty.
 The treaty was a milestone on China's road to economic
 development and it established a political basis for
 relations, ending the theoretical state of war between
 the two countries.

 From the Chinese point of view, the treaty's inclu-
 sion of an "antihegemonism" plank, despite intense Soviet
 pressure on Tokyo, helped dissolve strong memories of
 the Japanese invasion and occupation of China.  In order

 to put off to "later generations" the thorny question of

 China's Vietnam Problem
 As China laid the ghosts of its former enemies, the
 United States and Japan, new specters arose.  Vietnam,
 traditionally suspicious of its northern neighbor and
 deeply antagonized by China's support of the PoI Pot
 regime in Kampuchea, demonstrated its unhappiness with
 Beijing early last year by kicking off a campaign to
 drive potentially disloyal ethnic Chinese out of Vietnam,
 starting the great Indochina exodus.  By May 1978, the
 Chinese were viewing the situation with alarm.
 The Refugee Problem
 The Chinese are still faced with enormous numbers
 of refugees entering the country from Vietnam.  By mid-
 1979, top Chinese officials claimed that more than
 250,000 refugees, mostly ethnic Chinese, had been proc-
 essed into China and that more than 10,000 per month
 were still crossing the border.  The economic burden

 created by this massive influx is obvious.  In addition,
 there are some signs that the dislocations caused by the
 heavy concentration of refugees in some parts of South
 China have created resentment and opposition among local
 altogether.
 Beijing has seized on the refugee issue as a means
 to bring international pressure on Hanoi.  From China's
 perspective, it is an example of Hanoi's oppressive
 internal programs and its expansionist foreign policies.
 China sees the refugee problem, not as a disease that
 can be treated externally, but as something only Hanoi
 can correct.  Beijing has tried to broaden the issue
 further by linking the USSR with Vietnam's treatment of
 ethnic minorities.  Thus, both Moscow and Hanoi are
 described as attempting to sow racial dissension and
 economic chaos in neighboring Southeast Asian countries
 by forcing ethnic Chinese onto these countries.  The
 Chinese are not sympathetic with proposals to facili-
 tate the relocation of larger numbers of refugees,
 arguing that it would only encourage Hanoi to continue
 expelling them.  Instead, they have sided with some
 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
 (ASEAN) in demanding that Hanoi halt the flow of refugees
 tance to get deeply involved in economic aid to Vietnam.
 While the Chinese express support for humanitarian
 proposals aimed at a speedy resettlement of the existing
 refugee population, these proposals clearly take a back
 seat in Beijing's view to steps that would bring pressure
 on Hanoi to end its persecution of ethnic Chinese.  The
 Chinese hope to achieve this objective by encouraging a
 unified anti-Vietnamese stance on the refugee issue among
 ASEAN countries, and a policy of no economic support on
 the part of Western countries and Japan.  Beijing, there-
 fore, has been pleased with the unwillingness of the
 United States to recognize Hanoi and by Japan's reluc-

 military pressure on Vietnam.  The Chinese, who had long
 looked to Kampuchea as a counter to the growth of Viet-
 namese influence in the region, found themselves reduced
 to making a last-ditch effort in December 1978 to aid the
 failing Kampucheans.  Despite escalating threats from
 China, and increasing numbers of Chinese forces on the
 Vietnamese border, the Vietnamese had pushed into Phnom
 Penh by early January and triggered China's decision to
 take direct action and invade.
 Chinese party documents published in December sug-
 gested that Beijing then believed that the normalization
 of Sino-US relations and the newly strengthened ties with
 Japan would strengthen China's hand against Vietnam and
 the Soviet Union.  Hanoi and Moscow had signed a Treaty
 of Friendship and Cooperation in November, and Beijing
 sought to convey the impression its new links would off-
 set this Vietnamese advantage.  Vice Premier Deng was a
 strong advocate of the invasion of Vietnam, and his trips
 to the United States and Japan in late January and Febru-
 ary were calculated, in part, to create the impression of
 US and Japanese support for China's pending action.
 Deng cautiously prepared for the invasion by ensuring
 a vast numerical superiority, evacuating civilians from
 wide stretches of Chinese territory bordering the Soviet
 Union in case of Soviet retaliation, and proclaiming lim-
 ited objectives.  He recognized that the invasion could
 not reverse the situation in Kampuchea, that it could not
 be prolonged without unacceptable damage to the eco-
 nomic modernization program, and that it was unlikely to
 reverse Vietnam's anti-China policies.  Deng rationalized
 nonetheless that it was necessary to do "something" lest
 the Vietnamese and Soviets think there would be no nega-
 tive consequences for their actions and the West w
 begin to think China does not "mean what it says.."
 In the event, these calculations appeared to be ap-
 proximately correct.  China invaded and then withdrew in
 what appeared to be a determined, orderly fashion.  The
 Soviet Union proved unwilling to retaliate directly.
 China then reinvigorated its broader anti-Vietnamese strat-
 egy of urging the ASEAN states to unite against the Vietnamese,
 imposing political and economic isolation on Hanoi, and
 periodically threatening a "second strike" against Vietnam.

 It has in fact withdrawn considerable forces from the
 immediate border area, but insists on impossible terms in
 the Sino-Vietnamese negotiations that began after the
 Chinese withdrawal, waiting for the Vietnamese to crick
 under the internal and external strains.
 Sharp Debate in Beijin
 Despite the appearance of a "diplomatic success" in
 the invasion, an intense internal debate erupted.  Even
 before the invasion, some in China were questioning the
 Army's capability to do the job or handle possible Soviet
 retaliation.  After the invasion, stories of high, almost
 Pyrrhic casualty rates circulated in China, and there were
 complaints about the quality and utility of the Army's
 equipment.  So intense was the argument that six weeks
 passed after the end of the invasion before the party was
 able to muster a leadership turnout to congratulate the
 heroes of the fighting.
 A second factor was the economic costs of the inva-
 sion.  Economic readjustment was already under way in
 China when the invasion was launched.  Overly ambitious
 programs were being scaled down and budgets were cut.  The
 Chinese recently revealed, however, that the defense budget
 for 1979 had to be increased 20 percent, in larcte part to
 pay the direct costs of the invasion.
 Third, the organizers of the invasion were vulnerable
 to charges that in the most important area of concern--
 that of the Soviet threat to China--they had strengthened
 the Soviet position.  While China's troops were still with-
 drawing from Vietnam, it was already becoming clear that
 relations between the Soviets and Vietnamese had become
 much clgser as a result of the attack.  Soviet military
 aircraft and warships for the first time enjoyed access
 to Vietnamese facilities and Vietnam had become more de-
 pendent than ever on Soviet assistance.
 The Call for Talks With the USSR
 Internal criticism of Beijing's Vietnam invasion
 arose at a crucial time for China's broader diplomatic
 strategy.  From early 1978, tensions between Moscow and
 Beijing had been rising steadily.  The Chinese turned
 aside a Soviet proposal in February 1978 for talks to

 normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.  President
 Brezhnev then made a conspicuous visit to the Soviet,Far
 East and witnessed a Soviet military exercise near the
 In this climate of heightened tension, Beijing was
 confronted with the need to devise a means to end the 1950
 Sino-Soviet Treaty.  According to the terms of the treaty,
 if Beijing did not "denounce" it by 11 April 1979, it
 would have automatically remained in force at least until
 1985.  Having earlier promised the Japanese that China
 would allow the treaty to die, failure to denounce it
 would have prompted fears in Tokyo and perhaps elsewhere
 that Beijing was backsliding on its commitment to moderni-
 zation and to anti-Soviet policies.  Yet, denunciation of?
 the treaty without something to soften the impact ran the
 Consideration of this question coincided with criti-
 cism within China of the Vietnam invasion, producing a
 sharp debate over the immediacy of the Soviet threat and
 China's domestic needs.  In the end, the Chinese decided
 to pair their denunciation of the treaty with a call far
 negotiations with the Soviets.  Beijing apparently rea-
 soned that the denunciation would reassure'Japan and the
 West about China's fundamental strategic orientation, but
 that the Soviets, after years of issuing their own calls
 for talks, would find the Chinese offer irresistible.
 Soviet willingness to talk in turn might prompt Vietnamese
 fears of a Soviet sellout of Hanoi's interests.  The
 proposal had the added advantage of portraying the Chinese
 as "reasonable" in the wake of the Vietnam invasion.  Most,

 The Chinese media have even argued that limited agree-

 acquisition of Soviet management and industrial technology,
 some of which is better suited to China's level of moderni-
 zation than the Western alternatives.  The terms of trade
 would be barter, permitting the Chinese to husband foreign
 exchange while providing what might be a ready market for
 China's expanding, production of light industrial and agri-

 Finally, the Chinese proposal was issued while a mod-
 est antiforeign reaction was taking place in response to
 the sudden influx into China of Western social values and
 behavior.  It also followed the passage of the Taiwan
 Omnibus legislation.  Beijing's more conservative leaders
 may have reasoned at that time that the call for talks
 might remind Washington that Beijing has some maneuver-
 ability in the strategic triangle.
 These are all essentially tactical considerations.
 There may have been other motives at play as well.  The
 relationship with the USSR has been a source of contro-
 versy in Chinese Communist politics almost since the party
 was formed.  Recent "rehabilitation" of long-purged former
 leaders--some of whom had fallen while advocating a less
 contentious relationship with Moscow could have somewhat
 changed the climate, and perhaps the terms, in which
 policy toward the Soviet Union was discussed.  In any
 event, we have long been aware of shadowy evidence sug-
 gesting that some Chinese military leaders believe that
 China's vulnerability to Soviet pressures might be re-
 duced by a less bellicose attitude toward Moscow.  Recent
 evidence points toward similar sentime~UNC

 ing the talks to go forward.  Room for Sino-Soviet accommo-
 dation--even of a very limited sort--has in any event been
 appreciably reduced by Hua Guofeng's statement at the re-
 cent National People's Congress that Moscow will have to
 embody its newfound opposition to "hegemonism" in deeds
 rather than words.  This suggests that the Chinese expect
 that the broad issues of the Soviet relationship to Mongo-
 lia and Vietnam--topics inappropriate for discussion in
 the narrow confines of the long-stalled Sino-Soviet border
 talks--to be major topics in the new forum.  Moscow is not

 likely to be accommodating on such issues.                   25X1
 Indeed, it is far from certain how successful Beijing's
 initiative will be.  The Soviet response has been extremely
 wary.  Moscow had been at pains to reassure the Vietnamese
 that their interests will not be sold out.  Moscow also
 suspects that China will still revert to the unacceptable

 Despite the indications that some middle-level offi-

 after Hua's demand for Soviet "deeds"--senior officials
 have persistently attempted to deflate these hopes as they
 pursue a long, drawnout exploratory course designed to
 yield nothing in advance of the talks.  In the larger con-
 text, Chinese officials remain adamantly opposed to the
 spread of Soviet influence and power.  The Chinese speak
 in terms of very long negotiations.  Without some hint of
 Chinese concessions to keep the Soviets interested, real
 progress is not likely.  Indeed, it may depend as much on

 CHINA:  THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
 Executive Summary
 This year, and in 1980-81 as well, China's post-Mao
 leadership will be concerned primarily with realigning its
 long-term program for economic modernization.  The leader-
 ship's reassessment of pace and priorities was summed up
 by Premier and Party Chairman Hua Guofeng at the National
 People's Congress (NPC) in late June:
 The work of recovery and development in
 the previous two years (1977-78) has yielded
 results far in excess of our expectations.
 But the grave effects of the sabotage by Lin
 Biao and the Gang of Four cannot be eliminated
 in a short period.  We did not take this into
 full account and some of the measures we adopted
 were not sufficiently prudent. [As a result, it
 is] absolutely necessary that we concentrate our
 efforts within these three years [1979-81] on
 readjusting, restructurin consolidatin and
 improving our. economy.   Emp asls a  e
 Aside from the forthright discussion of current dif-
 ficulties, Hua and other officials gave out an unprece-
 dented number of economic statistics that generally
 confirm their appraisal of economic recovery in 1977-
 78.  On the other hand, the new policies are forcing
 a slowdown this year in the rate of growth of industrial
 production and a sharp reduction in budgetary appropria-
 tions for capital investment projects.  For the first
 time in many years, China's managers have been directed
 to emphasize quality, product mix, and cost effective-
 ness rather than sheer output.
 This unclassified memorandum was prepared by the China Division of
 the Office of Economic Research, National Foreign Assessment Center,
 in response to a request from the National Security Council.  Ques-
 tions and comments may be addressed to

 The five major objectives under the slogan of
 readjustment center around:
 -- Praising growth rates for foodgrains and
 other farm products in relation to population
 and industry.
 -- Increasing the growth rate of consumer goods
 production, both for domestic consumption and
 to expand exports.
 -- Assigning higher priority to energy, trans-
 portation, and communications.
 -- Cutting back an "overextended" investment
 program so as to concentrate resources on
 completing vital projects.
 -- Raising the incomes of rural and urban workers.
 The new policies of restructurin  and consolidatin
 require an "overall reform o  t e structure o  economic
 management."  While efforts in this regard are still
 experimental, they apparently are expected to evolve into
 some uniquely Chinese model of market socialism in which
 local authorities are given greater powers over planning,
 investment, finance, material supply, and foreign trade.
 Policies in the improvement category are aimed at raising
 labor productivity and capital efficiency.
 Despite the revamping of economic strategy, China's
 leaders insist that their need for foreign equipment,
 technology, and capital remains large.  What is new is
 that their shopping list now is more practically focused,
 reflecting a better appreciation of the high costs of
 acquisition and the difficulties in absorbing foreign
 technology.
 The comprehensive character of all that Beijing is
 attempting to accomplish in 1979-81 has inevitably up-
 set the targets and timetable of the 10-year plan for
 1976-85 announced early last year by Chairman Hua.  That
 plan--or "draft outline" as Hua now calls it--has been de-
 clared overly ambitious and hastily conceived; neither it
 nor its first phase, the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1976-80),
 are given much mention at present.  The State Planning
 Commission, having revised the original version of the

 Approved For Release 2007/11/16 :CIA-RDP83R00184R002600620001-5
 annual plan for 1979, is currently reworking earlier plans
 for 1980 and 1981.  A draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (1981-85) will not be presented to the NPC until sometime
 in 1981.
 Finally, we believe that the policies of realignment
 and retrenchment may be in place longer than the three
 years now envisaged:
 -- Institutional changes proposed under the
 new policies seem too far reaching to be
 completed so quickly.
 -- Leadtimes required for bringing new invest-
 ment projects into production in bottleneck
 sectors are such as to make it unlikely that
 these constraints will be lifted by 1981.
 -- In a country as poor and populous as China,
 the problem of matching supplies to consumer
 demand will necessarily be around for a long
 time to come.
 Nevertheless, there are grounds for optimism.  In con-
 trast to the Maoist era, the present leadership seems
 pragmatic and relatively unconstrained by orthodox
 ideology in its policy choices.  And, perhaps most
 important of all, it has already demonstrated this year
 an ability to react quickly to adverse consequences of
 these policy choices.
 Economic Performance in 1976-79
 One of the milestones distinguishing the recent Na-
 tional People's Congress from all others since the late
 1950s is the public disclosure of major speeches and a
 large body of economic and social statistics.  Although
 most of the data cover only the years 1977 and 1978,
 enough information was provided to show the performance
 of key economic sectors in 1976 as well.  Some data also
 were released on planned targets for 1979.
 A comparison of the new figures with CIA estimates
 shows that our appraisal of recent economic trends in
 China has been close to the mark.  This is not surprising
 inasmuch as our estimates have been attempts to reconstruct
 official data from piecemeal claims of percentage increases
