 French Premier Gaillard's prospects of squeezing
 through the military budget debate in the National As-
 sembly appear to be improving, but new rightist demands
 for a strong stand on North Africa may again jeopardize
 his coalition.  Gaillard is counting on the approaching

 NEW SOVIET PROPOSALS ON SUMMIT MEETING .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page 6
 The Soviet Union's latest proposals for a heads-
 of-government meeting, particularly as outlined in the
 widely publicized letter of 1 March to French Foreign
 Minister Pinea+a, are intended to focus the present East-
 West exchange on the question of Western willingness to
 agree to such a meeting before its composition and agenda
 have been determined.  Kremlin leaders apparently calcu-
 late that their qualified acceptance of a foreign minis-
 ters' conference and minor changes in their position on
 proposed topics to be discussed at a summit conference
 will bring additional pressure on Western governments to
 accept Soviet terms on the timing, composition, and
 agenda of a top-level meeting.1                    -1
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 KHRUSHCHEV'S AGRICULTURAL REORGANIZATION MOVES AHEAD .  .  .  Page 1
 With  party  central   committee endorsement and publi-
 cation of his "theses," Khrushchev's proposal-for trans-
 ferring Soviet agricultural machinery from the machine
 tractor stations to the collective farms is well on its
 way toward final approval at the next Supreme Soviet meet-
 ing,  probably in April.  The "theses" stress that antic-
 ipated improvement in efficiency will enable the collec-
 tive farms to continue to make progress while buying the
 machinery and otherwise. adjusting to the change.  A Con-
 gress of Collective Farmers will be held in early 1959 to
 redefine the collectives' role in Soviet agriculture.

 PART II (continued)
 NORTH KOREA RELEASES PASSENGERS OF SOUTH KOREAN AIRLINER .  Page 2
 Pyongyang's release of the passengers of the South
 Korean airliner hijacked on 16 February was apparently
 prompted in large part by indications that the plane in-
 cident was detracting from Chinese Communist and North
 Korean "peace" moves.  The North Koreans may also have
 been influenced by Soviet leaders, who desire to improve
 f the pas-
 the atmosphere for summit talks.  The release o
 sengers will probably become another stock item in the
 propaganda citing alleged Communist initiatives to ef-
 fect a Korean settlement, such as the announcement of
 Chinese troop withdrawals from Korea by the end of 1958.
 THE LEBANESE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION .  .  . .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  Page
 The internal security of Lebanon is threatened by

 Chamoun may try to force a constitutional amendment to

 of his opponents have threatened civil war if he should
 do so.  The chamber is to elect the new president be-

 Internal pressures in Morocco have become so strong
 that the government of King Mohamed V seems to be re-
 considering the nature of its relations with the West.
 The King and Foreign Minister Balafrej feel they must
 puruse a new course or run the risk of being supplanted.
 As a first step Morocco may exchange ambassadors with
 the Soviet Union.

 The underground organization EOKA has instructed
 Greek Cypriots to prepare for "battle" against the
 British by economic boycott and passive resistance.
 Greek Cypriots remain divided, however, and tension
 between their left and right wings could lead to vio-
 lence at any time.  Any progress toward a settlement
 of the Cyprus issue will be delayed for the immediate
 future by the Greek Government crisis.

 GREEK GOVERNMENT CRISIS   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .              .
 The fall of the Greek Government of Prime Minister
 K.aramanlis was precipitated by a cabinet controversy
 over a new electoral law. Dissatisfaction among some
 cabinet ministers over Karamanlis' tendency to disre-
 gard the views of his cabinet on major issues had been
 growing for some time.  King Paul's decision to form
 a caretaker government and hold national elections in
 April was apparently taken in order to prevent a long
 period of political instability.

 PEIPING CHARTS BOLD ECONOMIC COURSE   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .     Page    9
 Communist China's 1958 plan and budget, while still
 strongly oriented toward rapid industrialization, provide
 for sharply increased spending on agriculture.  Most agri-
 cultural and industrial targets are ambitious, as Peiping
 strives to get the Second Five-Year Plan off with a "giant
 leap forward."  Attainment of these targets will require
 unusually good crop weather and a continuing high level of
 nationwide austerity.  Previous Soviet economic credits
 have apparently been exhausted and China's own net foreign
 payments are increasing.

 The adoption last week by the Polish Communist party
 of a resolution concerning a new economic program was
 another victory for Gomulka over his Stalinist opposition.
 Gomulka also engineered the expulsion of a leading Natolin
 from the central committee and the government for his at-
 tacks on Gomulka's political and economic policies.  Go-
 mulka's strength has also been enhanced by the Soviet sup-
 port implicit in Khrushchev's approval in January of his
 internal policies.

 BRITISH LABOR DEMANDING NEW MOVES ON DISARMAMENT .  .  .  .  .  Page 15
 The British Trades Union Congress is joining with
 the Labor party in a nationwide campaign to demand that
 the Macmillan government show more initiative in seek-
 ing international. agreement on disarmament and disengage-
 ment.  The government has already shown itself sensitive
 to public opinion on these questions, and its responsive-
 ness to new pressures will be affected by its showing in
 two pending by-elections.  The first of these elections
 is scheduled for 13 March in a marginal Glasgow constit-
 uency.
 PROSPECTS OF THE YDIGORAS REGIME IN GUATEMALA  .
 Page 15
 Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes, who was inaugurated for a
 six-year term on 2 March, will have difficulty restoring
 political stability in Guatemala.  His apparent intention
 to follow a middle-of-the-road political course will be
 bitterly resented by extreme rightists, who form the core
 of his political support.   It was apparent even before the
 inauguration that he would have difficulty  in controlling
 the C      ~r , in which his followers form a minority
 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN ARGENTINE OIL POLICY .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  Page 16
 The provisional Aramburu government apparently hopes
 to arrange limited foreign participation in Argentina?s oil
 industry before President-elect Frondizi takes office on 1
 May.   In view of the heavy drain of oil imports on Argen-
 tina?s limited foreign exchange, Frondizi probably approves
 of this moves although during the campaign he opposed any
 change in the country's nationalistic oil policy.
 USSR SUPREME SOVIET ELECTIONS   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Page  1
 The election of a single slate of candidates for the
 USSR Supreme Soviet will be held on 16 March and provides,
 as in the past, an occasion for widespread agitation to
 arouse support for the regime.  The nomination of candi-
 dates for deputies provides an indication of leadership
 changes throughout the country, the relative representa-
 tion in the Supreme Soviet of the various elements of So-
 viet society, and particularly the relative standing of
 party presidium members.  Khrushchev has received more
 than twice as many honorary nominations as President

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THERYUKYU ISLANDS
 outside the Naha urban area.
 Anti-American elements in the Ryukyu Islands, par-
 ticularly on Okinawa, have made election gains by ex-
 ploiting the discontent with American land acquisition and
 compensation policies and nationalistic sentiment for re-
 version of the islands to Japan.  Their activity has pro-
 moted increasing resentment among the native population
 toward the American administration.  Elections for the
 Ryukyuan legislature on 16 March probably will demonstrate

 EGYPTIAN SCHOOLTEACHERS IN AFRICA AND NEAR EAST  .  .  .  .  .             Page 10
 Egyptian schoolteachers have been major agents in the

 employed in more than a dozen countries in the area, with
 their ostensible role of teaching in many cases subordi-
 nated to a Cairo-directed program of preaching Nasir-type
 radical nationalism and promoting the Egyptian line among
 students and youth organizations.   Some host governments
 have objected to their obvious engagement in political and
 subversive action.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 A new round of trouble with
 Nasir is probably the basic rea-
 son for the change in the Iraqi
 cabinet, which after several
 false starts finally took place
 on 3 March.   Nuri Said's resump-
 tion of the premiership, with
 a cabinet of stalwart ultracon-
 servatives,  is an indication of
 the Iraqi Government's deter-
 mination to pursue a strong line
 and is a challenge to Nasir's
 radical nationalism, which views
 Nuri as the "imperialist agent"
 pax excellence.   The composition
 of the cabinet is also, however,
 an indication of the scarcity
 of Iraqi leadership, which Nuri
 himself has described as   "a
 small pack of cards which has
 to be shuffled often."
 The new Iraqi cabinet has
 created some dismay in Jordan,
 where Nuri is regarded as de-
 termined to assert Iraq's posi-
 tion as the dominant partner in
 the federation.   There is also
 a belief in Amman, supported
 by a statement by an Iraqi diplo-
 mat there, that Jordan's Deputy
 Prime Minister Rifai, who has
 been  the. actual director  of
 cabinet policy, is looked on
 with disfavor   by Nuri   and
 other      Iraqis.   Near  East
 press  speculation on a change
 in  the  Jordanian    cabinet
 has in fact followed on   the
 heels of the shift in   Iraq.
 THE TUNISIAN SITUATION
 Tunisian Presient Bour-
 guiba has begun a campaign to
 focus world attention on   the
 French proposal  to         seal the
 Algerian-Tunisian           border by
 creating a "no man's land" on
 the Algerian side of the border.
 Bourguiba's statements reflect
 his deep preoccupation with the
 problem of the Algerian refugees
 in Tunisia and are an effort to
 recoup popular support at home,
 where the   public   has   become
 restive as a result of his han-
 dling of the French-Tunisian
 crisis.
 In a radio address on 27
 February, Bourguiba  appealed
 for world support against Frances
 "scorched earth" policy along
 the Algerian frontier, and simul-
 taneously filed a new complaint
 with the UN Security  Council
 charging that France is forcibly
 evicting 250,000 inhabitants
 from the zone.   He has also sent
 letters to various chiefs of
 state pointing out the disas-
 trous consequences of such a
 French policy.   Tunisian offi-
 cials assert that 7,000 Algerian
 refugees have fled to Tunisia.

 with recent weeks and that their
 care, along with that of 60,000
 previous refugees, overtaxes
 local resources.   An Interna-
 tional Red Cross representative
 who visited the border area in
 Tunisia and interviewed some of
 the refugees is personally con-
 vinced of the "general authen-
 ticity, if exaggeration" of the
 reports of "barbarism" by French
 paratroopers, which is said to
 include random executions and
 wholesale destruction of prop-
 erty.
 French officials in Algeria
 state that only about 980 square
 miles of border area will be
 evacuated and that no more than
 5,000 families will be moved
 to nearby  fortified  towns.
 These officials foresee a line
 of strong points parallel to
 the Tunisian border and three
 to five miles from it with a
 "no man's land" between them
 and the border.
 The American ambassador in
 Tunis says Bourguiba's refusal
 to comment on the good-offices
 mission in his 27 February
 speech has created a public
 opinion problem with his peo-
 ple, who are used to being told
 how to react to important sit-
 uations.   The Tunisian populace
 is showing growing impatience
 and suspicion of the mission,
 according to the two most in-
 fluential French-language news-
 papers in Tunisia, one of which
 comments that the "silence,
 mystery, and slowness of Ameri-
 can secret diplomacy are lead-
 ing to confusion."
 The Tunisian Government is
 also concerned about the activ-
 ity of followers of Salah ben
 Youssef, exiled rival of Bour-
 guiba, who were discovered plot-
 ting the assassination of Bour-
 guibae   It has arrested some 41
 persons and strengthened the
 forces guarding the President.
 Tunis has vigorously protested
 the alleged Egyptian involve-
 ment in the assassination plot.
 In Paris,  the National As-
 sembly is reported in a "bad
 humor" over Premier Gaillard's
 North African policies and par-
 ticularly over the possibility
 that American-British good of-
 fices might "internationalize"
 the Algerian situation.   Gail-
 lard appears to have no program
 beyond avoiding any action
 which might endanger his govern-
 ment.
 A surprise French diplo-
 matic move may be foreshadowed
 in a "personal" suggestion made
 to Ambassador Lodge by France's
 UN Security Council representa-
 tive that NATO might be a bet-
 ter forum than the UN for "in-
 ternationalizing" the Algerian
 problem.   The French official
 envisioned the admission of
 Tunisia and Morocco to NATO as
 part of this solution.
 French Premier Gaillard's
 prospects of squeezing through
 the currently explosive mili-
 tary budget debate in the Na-
 tional Assembly appear to be
 improving, but new rightist de-
 mands for a strong stand on North
 Africa may again jeopardize his
 coalition.   Gaillard is counting
 on the approaching Easter recess,

 which begins 28 March, and on
 local elections scheduled for
 late April,  to discourage the
 political parties from precipi-
 tating a crisis.
 Rightists, who last week
 threatened to topple Gaillard
 unless he sent heavy reinforce-
 ments to Algeria, now appear
 willing to accept his promise
 to augment forces there by
 28,000 men, to be financed if
 possible by German troop sup-
 port payments but otherwise
 from further cuts in portions
 of the military budget not con-
 nected with Algeria.   They are
 expected to demand,  however,
 that the government take  a
 strong position toward Tunisia
 and to call for action against
 "defeatists" in France.
 This hardening of the
 rightist position is reflected
 in recent calls for an "effec-
 tive government" or the return
 of General de Gaulle by Sou-
 stelle and other   Gaullists,
 Dissident Radical leader Morice,
 and Independent leader Duchet.
 Popular Republican Bidault,
 who has  moved increasingly
 toward the right, has joined in
 this clamor.
 Any concession by Gaillard
 to the demands of the rightists
 can be expected to alienate his
 Socialist and Popular Republican
 support,  large elements of which
 are already uneasy over their as-
 sociation with his government.
 His chances of surviving these
 difficulties are enhanced, how-
 ever, by the approach of the
 Easter recess and the elections
 scheduled for the next two months.
 Moreover,  the threat of a crisis
 over constitutional reform, to
 be debated again next week, ap-
 pears reduced in view of com-
 promises reportedly reached by
 party representatives.
 Nevertheless,  the progres-
 sive general deterioration of
 Gaillard's coalition could still
 lead him to "choose to fall" on
 the constitutional reform issue.
 In any event the continuing at-
 trition of his coalition places
 him increasingly at the mercy
 of the 200 more or less consist-
 ent  opponents on any issue in
 the assembly.
 The Soviet Union's new pro- I         of a foreign ministers' con-
 posals for a heads-of-govern-
 ment meeting, particularly as
 outlined in the widely publi-
 cized letter of 1 March to
 French Foreign Minister Pineau,
 are intended to focus the pres-
 ent East-West exchange on the
 question of Western willingness
 to agree to such a meeting be-
 fore its composition and agenda

 leaders apparently calculate
 that their qualified acceptance

 pressure on Western governments

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Thompson on 28 February, was in-
 tended to appear responsive to
 President Eisenhower's letter
 of 15 February to Premier Bul-
 ganin.   Moscow agreed to such a
 meeting if it were "strictly
 limited" to organizing the pro-
 cedural details of a top-level
 meeting and if "firm agreement"
 were first reached on the date
 for a summit meeting.
 Gromyko urged immediate
 diplomatic exchanges to deter-
 mine the composition, date, and
 place of a foreign ministers'
 session and to establish the
 date for a heads-of-government
 meeting.   He proposed that the
 foreign ministers convene in
 April at Geneva and that the
 heads of government meet in
 June.
 The USSR appears to  be
 flexible, however, on the tim-
 ing and location of a summit
 conference.   Soviet Ambassador
 Smirnov in Bonn recently told
 a Western journalist that the
 Soviet leaders are ready to come
 to Geneva "at any time," men-
 tioning July as an acceptable
 date.
 The Soviet aide-memoire to
 the United States, extending
 Bulganin's earlier proposals
 for the composition of a summit
 meeting, called for either par-
 ticipation by all NATO coun-
 tries and Warsaw pact states,
 plus six neutral powers, or--
 in a more limited meeting--the
 United States, Britain, France,
 and Italy from the West,  the
 USSR, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 and Rumania from the Soviet
 bloc,  plus Yugoslavia,  Sweden,
 and Austria.  A Soviet Foreign
 Ministry official informed the
 Italian Erhbassy in Moscow on 3
 March that the Soviet Union
 wanted neutralist states repre-
 sented at summit talks, but be-
 lieved their participation at a
 foreign ministers' meeting was
 not essential.
 The note to France explis-
 itly,,  stated that the partici-
 pants of both a foreign minis-
 ters' and a summit conference
 should be on a "parity basis."
 This underscores the importance
 which Moscow attaches to equal
 representation of Soviet bloc
 and Western states,  particularly
 as a means of illustrating So-
 viet assertions that the "balance
 of world forces" has shifted
 away from the West, and of
 claiming Western recognition of
 the status quo in Eastern Eu-
 rope.
 The note to the United
 States repeated the nine-point
 agenda for summit talks put
 forth in Bulganin's January and
 February letters, and added a
 new item entitled "Conclusion
 of a German Peace Treaty."   The
 Soviet Government suggested
 that when the heads of govern-
 ment discuss this item, both
 East and West German represent-
 atives  should attend the con-
 ference.   The note stated, how-
 ever,  that these negotiations
 should not embrace the subject
 of German reunification, and it
 repeated the Soviet view that
 this issue could be dealt with
 only by the two German states.
 The aide-memoire also of-
 fered to discuss the use of
 outer space for peaceful pur-
 poses,                                                      as suggested in the Presi-
 dent's letters to Bulganin,  pro-
 vided the United States is will-
 ing to consider the "liquidation
 of foreign military bases." The
 Soviet position,  first laid down
 by Khrushchev at Minsk on 22
 January,  has been to link the
 question of the use of outer
 space with an agreement on ces-
 sation of nuclear tests and

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 KRHUSHCHEV'S AGRICULTURAL REORGANIZATION MOVES AHEAD
 Khrushchev's proposal for
 transferring Soviet agricultural
 machinery from the machine trac-
 tor stations  (MTS) to the col-
 lective farms is well on its
 way toward final approval.   The
 party central committee,  which
 convened on 25-26 February,  ap-
 parently endorsed the plan in
 short order and a full outline
 of the proposal--the Khrushchev
 "theses"--has been published in
 the Soviet press.   A nationwide
 discussion of the theses is now
 to take place,  after which they
 will be submitted to the next
 session of the Supreme Soviet--
 probably in April--for formal
 approval.
 The MTS reorganization,
 another major economic program
 sponsored by Khrushchev,  attests
 once again to his personal ini-
 tiative and pervasive authority
 over the Soviet scene.    Unlike
 his "new lands" program and his
 industrial reorganization, how-
 ever,          the MTS proposals have
 little chance of backfiring dur-
 ing their implementation and
 thus,  in comparison,  the pros-
 pects for future opposition on
 the MTS changes along are les-
 sened.
 Nevertheless, there were
 some suggestions of high-level
 disagreement over the proposal.
 Ambassador Thompson has received
 information from a source be-
 lieved to be reliable confirming
 that several members of the par-
 ty presidium were highly annoyed
 at Khrushchev for raising the
 MTS question in public before
 it had been discussed in the
 presidium.   The theses admit
 only that   some comrades,  chief-
 ly economists," had doubts about
 the change because they believed
 that state farms and not collec-
 tives should be emphasized during
 the transition to Communism.  In
 any case, central committee ap-
 proval probably gives Khrushchev
 a club against any rear-guard
 opponents.
 Khrushchev has given some
 principles concerning the "new
 look" in collective farming.
 Future sales of new machines to
 the collectives,  like other sales
 by industry,  will be priced to
 return profits to industry.
 Grain procured by the state,  in-
 cluding deliveries as payments
 in kind formerly made to MTS's
 by collectives,  will henceforth
 be greater because of improved
 efficiency of the collectives.
 These considerations portend
 no easy path for the collectives,
 especially since the former MTS
 system was subsidized,  but Khru-
 shchev expects that the greater
 efficiencies realized under the
 new system will enable the col-
 lectives to continue their pros-
 perous development.
 The collectives must pay
 for the machinery now held by
 the MST's with due allowance for
 depreciation,  and Khrushchev
 has given an estimate of the to-
 tal value.. I                                                               stut'-d: :hat the "in-
 divisibie funds" of the collec-
 tives,  which among other things
 finance investment,  have risen
 to a figure adequate to finance
 acquisition of present MTS ma-
 chinery.
 The MTS machinery will be
 paid for over a period of time
 and will be transferred in stages.
 Leading collective farms with
 substantial funds will obtain
 machinery this year, while others
 with less funds will phase into
 the new pattern within two or
 three years, or in some instances
 after a longer period.

 NORTH KOREA RELEASES PASSENGERS OF SOUTH KOREAN AIRLINER
 Pyongyang's release of the
 passengers of the South Korean
 airliner hijacked on 16 February
 was apparently prompted in large
 part by indications. that the
 plane incident was detracting
 from Communist "peace" moves.
 Propaganda broadcasts from Pei-
 ping and Pyongyang had earlier
 reflected Communist discomfiture
 at the unfavorable publicity
 generated by the kidnaping. The
 United States was charged with
 trying to exploit the incident
 "to escape from its embarrass-
 ment" over Communist China's
 "epochal" announcement of plans
 to withdraw Chinese troops from
 Korea.
 In releasing the passengers,
 the North Koreans may also have
 been influenced by Moscow, which
 transmitted the American and
 West German notes on the matter
 to Pyongyang.   The North Korean
 leaders are among Moscow's most
 loyal puppets, and would  have
 responded quickly to any Soviet
 advice urging a quick settlement
 in order to improve the atmos-
 phere for summit talks.
 The hostage value of the
 kidnaped passengers was rapidly
 reduced by the South Korean gov-
 ernment *s flat 'refusal to enter
 into "direct contacts" with
 Pyongyang.   The South Korean Red
 Cross official's action in sign-
 ing receipts for the 22 Koreans

 backing down on their demand
 for direct contacts, the North
 Koreans attempted to create the
 impression that the United States
 and West Germany agreed to a
 government-to-government ar-
 rangement on releasing the two
 American pilots and the two Ger-
 man nationals.   Pyongyang's For-
 eign Ministry statement on 1
 March specified that its deci-
 sion to release the passengers
 was made in response to the ini-
 tiative of the American and West
 German governments in their notes
 to Moscow on the plane incident.
 Both the United States and
 West Germany accepted Pyongyang's
 proposal. that government repre-
 sentatives be present at Panmun-
 jom when the passengers were
 freed.   Pyongyang is striving
 to keep alive the concept that
 contacts with officials of West-
 ern governments implies some
 sort of-recognition of North
 Korea as one of two legitimate
 Korean states.

 The release of the passen-
 gers will probably become another
 stock item in the propaganda
 citing alleged Communist initia-
 tives to effect a Korean settle-
 ment, such as the announcement
 on 19 February that Chinese Com-
 munist troops will be pulled out
 of North Korea by the end of
 1958.   Broadcasts from Peiping
 and Pyongyang are contrasting
 South Korean intransigence with
 Communist proposals for a peace-
 1959.                                                                     The second congress,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 THE LEBANESE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
 The internal security of
 Lebanon is threatened by Presi-
 dent Chamoun's desire to secure
 a second term.      To do so, he
 must have a constitutional
 clause which now forbids his
 succession amended during the
 forthcoming session of the Cham-
 ber of Deputies, which begins
 on 18 March and ends on 31 May.
 While a second term is not un-
 precedented--Chamoun's political
 enemy, former President al-Khuri,
 was re-elected in 1948--some of
 Chamoun's opponents have threat-
 ened civil war should he force
 through the admendment.
 Chamoun probably has the
 required two-thirds majority to
 pass such an admendment before
 the chamber's election of a
 president scheduled to take
 place between 23 July and 23
 August.   However, the mere in-
 troduction of the amendment
 probably would have immediate
 re ercussions
 a development m            t in
 the overthrow of the government
 in much the same way that Presi-
 dent al-Khuri was deposed in
 1952.   The accession to power
 of an anti-Western, pro-Egyptian
 government would probably follow.
 Chamoun actually began prep-
 arations for his re-election
 last June when he used his in-
 fluence to elect a Chamber of
 Deputies which would favor his
 candidacy.   By so doing,  he
 squeezed out many prominent po-
 litical opponents and upset the
 delicate balance of the religious
 communities, on which the polit-
 ical stability of Lebanon de-
 pends.
 The traditional balance
 between Moslems and Christians
 has been further upset by Cha-
 moun's outspoken pro-Western
 policy.   The Greek Orthodox
 Lebanese, with their traditional
 affinity for Russia, have suc-
 cumbed in part to the pro-Soviet
 policies of Egypt and Syria,
 while the Maronites are split
 because of a feud between Cha-
 moun and the influential Maronite
 Patriarch, a relative of ex-
 President al-Khuri.   The patri-
 arch has been making concilia-
 tory gestures and public state-
 ments to the Moslems which have
 put him in the position of op-
 posing the President in domestic
 as well as in international af-
 fairs.
 take this course.
 Chamoun might withdraw from
 the race and help secure the
 election of a successor who
 would be amenable to his poli-

 openly pro-Western.   There are
 several possibilities, including
 nonpolitical General Shihab, com-
 mander of the army,  and Jawad
 Bulus, an old political figure
 who has the advantage of not
 having taken sides in the quar-
 rels of the political clans but
 supports the government's for-

 INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 The belief is growing that
 the United States is financing
 and equipping a possible "colo-
 nialist" adventure in North Af-
 rica.  Considerable credence
 is given to Soviet and Cairo
 propaganda emphasizing French
 use of American equipment during
 the 8 February bombing of the
 Tunisian border village of
 Sakiet Sidi Youssef.   Last week
 the government requested the
 United States to prevent fur-
 ther use of American bases as
 entry points for French mate-
 riel.  Actually, American bases
 are increasingly considered a
 handicap to the government's
 freedom of action in foreign
 affairs.
 The government also resents
 what it believes to be Paris'
 control over American economic
 aid to Morocco, an impression
 confirmed in its eyes by the
 contrast between the apparent
 speed and quantity of American
 aid to France and the si"w prog-
 ress of the aid program in
 Morocco.   The American policy
 of supplementing rather than
 supplanting French economic aid
 to Morocco is not comprehended
 by a government which has only
 an American offer of $20,000,-
 000 to meet a $100,000,000 de-
 velopment budget because France
 failed to provide expected
 funds.
 As a result of these mount-
 ing anti-Western feelings, the
 King and Foreign Minister
 Balafrej, both of whom have
 opposed close relations with
 the USSR, are reported to be
 considering an early exchange
 of ambassadors with Moscow.
 Both the King and Balafrej may
 hope that the opening of a
 Soviet embassy in North Africa
 might jolt the West into more

 renewal of all-out terrorism,
 Grivas did not renounce entire-
 ly the use of armed force.          In
 line with this new policy, there
 have been mass resignations
 from office by Greek Cypriot
 village leaders.   These moves
 may be followed by a Greek
 Cypriot boycott of all British
 goods, refusal to pay taxes,
 and nonassociation with British
 nationals on Cyprus.
 Grivas apparently decided
 to emphasize a campaign of pas-
 sive resistance following a re-
 quest from Archbishop Makarios
 that violence not be renewed.
 Passive resistance would be in
 accord with the recommendations
 of many influential Greeks and
 Greek Cypriots who believe that
 only the Turks would benefit
 from renewed terrorist attacks
 by EOKA at this time.   They
 prefer to wait for a British
 Labor government, which they
 feel would be more sympathetic
 to Cypriot self-determination,
 to take office.
 GREEK GOVERNMENT
 Tension between left- and
 right-wing Greek Cypriots re-
 mains high, and further inter-
 necine violence could erupt at
 any time.   Left-wing leaders
 continue to demand a voice in
 island affairs through represen-
 tation on the Cypriot Ethnarchy
 Council.   Right-wing nationalists
 have replied with threats and
 at least one attempt on the       25X1
 life of a leftist leader.
 No significant advance
 on    a Cyprus issue is likely
 prior to the Greek national
 elections,  now expected in lat,
 April.
 The resignation of Greek
 Prime Minister Constantine
 Karamanlis on 2 March and the
 King's subsequent decision to
 call national elections fol-
 lowed a controversy within the
 cabinet over a new electoral
 law.   Dissatisfaction among
 cabinet ministers over Kara-
 manlis'  tendency to disregard
 the views of his cabinet on
 major issues,  however,   has
 been growing for some time and
 was probably a major cause of
 the resignations of   Minister
 of Trade and Industry Panagio-
 tis Papaligouras and Minister
 of Public Works George Rallis
 on 27 February, moves which
 precipitated the crisis.
 Following their resigna-
 tions,  Papaligouras and Rallis
 were joined by former   Deputy
 Premier Andreas Apostolides and
 12 other National Radical Union
 (ERE) deputies in presenting a
 statement withdrawing support
 from the prime minister.   Kara-
 manlis replied by expelling the
 15 dissidents from the   party,
 but,  since   his parliamentary
 support was reduced to a minor-
 ity in the 300-member Chamber
 of Deputies,   he simultaneously
 submitted his resignation to
 the King.
 King Paul,  in turn,  con-
 ferred with Karamanlis and the
 leaders of the opposition par-
 ties regarding the  selection
 of a new premier and the desira-
 bility of                                                                      holding immediate

 among leaders of the Liberals,
 second largest party in Greece,
 in favor of an interim govern-
 ment and elections in the fall,
 the King decided to appoint a
 caretaker  government and to
 hold national  elections as
 soon as practicable.  In this,
 he had the support of Karaman-
 lis, who again controls a ma-
 jority in the Chamber of Depu-
 ties following the return of
 two of the dissidents and the
 defection of a Liberal to the
 ERE on 4 March.
 Constantine Georgacopoulos,
 nonpolitical head of the Greek
 Red Cross, has been designated
 premier with the tasks  of
 steering Karamanlis' new elec-
 toral law through the Chamber
 of Deputies, dissolving that
 body, and holding national
 elections.  The new electoral
 law, providing for modified
 proportional representation,
 reportedly has the support of
 both the ERE and the Liberals
 and its passage appears likely,
 although possibly in amended
 form.   The constitution provides
 that elections must be held with-
 in 45                                                                 days from the date  the
 chamber is dissolved--indicat-
 ing elections in late April.
 Elections held under either
 the existing or any presently
 proposed electoral law will
 favor larger parties and will
 tend to force smaller ones into
 electoral coalitions.   Already
 intense political maneuvering
 has begun in Greece and  new
 parties or coalitions will prob-
 ably emerge.  The Communist-
 front United Democratic Left,
 to ensure representation in the
 new chamber and to secure greater
 respectability in Greece, will
 probably try to create an elec-
 toral front with center parties,
 similar to one formed for the
 elections of 1956.  During the
 electoral campaign, Communists,
 fellow travelers, neutralists,
 and political opportunists can
 be expected to exploit the two
 major foreign policy issues in
 Greece today--Cyprus and the in-
 bases in Greece.

 The budgets presented by
 the Indian and Pakistani finance
 ministers  for the fiscal year
 beginning 1 April indicate that
 India's economic development
 program will continue approxi-
 mately on schedule but that
 Pakistan will fail to implement
 its more modest program.   In-
 dia's defense expenditures are
 to reach $641,000,000, an in-
 crease of $29,000,000, and Pak-
 istan's are to reach $184,254,-
 000,   an  increase  of  only
 $3,700,000.
 Total Indian economic de-
 velopment expenditures for 1958
 are scheduled at $2.135 billion
 compared with actual expendi-
 tures of $1.407 billion and
 $1.775 billion during the first
 two years of the Second Five-
 Year Plan (1956-61).  Administra-
 tive difficulties probably will
 cause some shortfall in actual
 expenditures, but  the  latter
 should be sufficient to enable
 India to reach most of the goals
 of its five-year plan.  Most of
 the  increased  expenditures
 scheduled are to be financed by
 a $400,000,000 increase in for-
 eign aid, as the government de-
 cided to increase taxes by only
 $13,000,000 over last year's

 development expenditures from
 $337,491,000 during the current
 fiscal year to $303,030,000
 during the fiscal year begin-
 ning 1 April.   This is less
 than 60 percent of the amount
 called for during the coming
 fiscal year by the first Five-
 Year Plan (1955-60), and indi-
 cates that the plan will fall
 substantially short of its rel-
 atively  modest goals.
 Although the government
 did not accept the recommenda-
 tion of the Pakistani National.
 Economic Council that it in-
 crease taxes sharply to provide
 more funds for economic develop-
 ment,  the budget does call for
 a $21,000,000 rise in taxes to
 reduce deficit spending.   Even
 this small increase has provoked
 strong reactions in both Parlia-
 ment and the press, however, and
 the government may be forced to
 back down, as it did last year.
 The decline in development
 allocations will mean that no
 new major projects will be
 started, which will make it im-
 possible to bring expenditures
 in East Pakistan up to the level
 of those in West Pakistan, where
 most of the projects already
 under construction are located.
 This will add to the friction
 between the two parts of the
 country, and probably will fur-
 ther weaken the present coali-
 tion government, which depends
 on East Pakistan's support.
 Campaigning for Laos'  4
 May elections officially opened
 this week, with about 100 can-
 didates registered for the 21
 National Assembly seats at
 stake.   The elections,  held to
 expand the present assembly to
 59 seats, are the final step in
 the unification settlement with
 the Pathet Lao and will be the
 first test of the voter appeal
 of the Communist-front group.
 The campaign is of critical
 importance for the two conserv-
 ative  parties, which now dom-
 inate the royal government,
 and for the Pathet Lao, which
 has surrendered its territorial
 base and army in a switch to
 legal and semilegal political
 tactics.
 The two major conservative
 parties--the Nationalists and
 Independents,  which together
 now control over 70 percent of
 the seats in the legislature--
 have formed a "national front"
 for the campaign,   They have
 established a joint committee
 charged with allocating campaign
 support and reducing the present
 total of 53 conservative candi-
 dates to 21 in order to avoid
 splitting the vote.   Whether
 the committee will succeed in
 persuading all of the 32 weakest
 conservative candidates to drop
 out of the race is problematical,
 but the committee in any event
 will facilitate effective use
 of the resources available to
 the conservatives, which include
 the services of the army, police,
 provincial administration, and
 "civic action teams."
 Primary competition for the
 conservatives will come from the
 left-wing electoral front formed
 by the Laotian Patriotic Front--
 the Pathet Lao party--and the
 National Union party.   This
 front is presenting a single
 candidate for each of the 21
 seats and, therefore, is already
 assured that its support will
 not be split.   Thirteen of the
 candidates are former Pathet Lao
 leaders, including such top-
 level personalities as Prince

 Fasan; the remainder are Na-
 tional Union supporters.
 The small but well-en-
 trenched Democratic party has
 revealed that it has entered
 into an electoral alliance with
 the left-wing front.   Its co-
 operation is presumably some-
 what in the nature of a nonag-
 gression pact, since it is
 running an independent slate
 of five candidates.   This de-
 velopment is a setback for the
 conservatives, who were hopeful
 of winning Democratic support.
 An all-out struggle appears
 to be developing for the seats
 in the two former Pathet Lao-
 held provinces of Sam Neua and
 Phong Saly, with both sides
 sensitive to the symbolic im-
 pact of a victory there.   The
 Pathet Lao,  realizing that a
 defeat would be interpreted as
 a repudiation of three and a
 half years of Pathet administra-
 tion, reportedly has opened a
 headquarters of its front organ-
 ization in every village in Sam
 Neua Province and is threatening
 reprisals against individuals
 favorably disposed to the gov-
 ernment.   Despite the Laotian
 Army's occupation of the prov-
 ince since 19 January,  the
 civil administration remains
 predominantly in the hands of
 former Pathet functionaries.
 A strong left-wing showing
 in the elections probably would
 increase pressure on the govern-
 ment for adoption of a pro-Com-
 munist neutrality, allow the
 left to pose as the "wave of the
 future," possibly lead to in-
 creased Pathet representation in
 a new cabinet, and improve Pathet

 SOUTH KOREAN - JAPANESE RELATIONS
 Plans for resuming formal
 negotiations for a settlement
 of outstanding problems between
 Japan and South Korea have been
 snagged by Seoul's failure to
 return all Japanese fishermen.
 This obstacle will delay, but
 should not preclude, official
 talks, which are likely to be
 thorny and protracted.
 Tokyo on 27 February de-
 cided to postpone negotiations
 to normalize relations with
 Seoul scheduled for 1 March be-
 cause not all eligible Japanese
 fishermen held at Pusan had been
 returned.   The Japanese believe
 Seoul is holding 400 of some
 900 detainees as hostages to
 strengthen the South Korean
 bargaining position.
 Japanese suspension of the
 negotiations was accompanied by
 indications of increasing irri-
 tation over South Korean bad
 faith.   Tokyo, however, announced
 its willingness to begin negotia-
 tions if South Korea would give
 firm assurance that all Japanese
 fishermen eligible for repatriation
 would be returned soon.
 The Japanese, meanwhile, are
 continuing the repatriation of
 Korean illegal entrants.   They
 also hope that a compromise can
 be worked out permitting some
 90 Korean detainees who wish re-
 patriation to North Korea to be
 released in Japan.   Seoul has
 been insistent that these people
 be returned forcibly to South
 Korea.
 Seoul appears to have been
 considerably disturbed by Tokyo's
 action.   The Foreign Ministry
 realizes that failure to honor

 the Korean commitment to repa-
 triate all Japanese fishermen
 damaged the nation's prestige.
 Nevertheless, the Rhee govern-
 ment has not as yet indicated
 when all the remaining fisher-
 men will be returned, although
 some apparently are scheduled
 for repatriation in the near
 future.
 When formal negotiations
 are resumed, serious substan-
 tive disputes could cause a
 new  deadlock  at  any  time.
 While an apparent understanding
 has been reached between the
 two  countries on  property
 claims, the problems of the re-
 turn of Korean art treasures
 and the status of Korean resi-
 dents in Japan remain.
 The controversial "ghee
 line," which unilaterally es-
 tablishes South Korean terri-
 torial waters as much as 60
 miles offshore,  also will be
 a major obstacle to any settle-
 ment.   South Korea is continuing
 to seize Japanese fishing boats
 caught inside this line.   Japan
 is willing to conclude a fish-
 eries conservation agreement to
 settle the issue, but Korea has
 not as yet shown any willing-
 ness to accept such a compro-
 mise.
 Communist China's 1958
 plan and budget, recently made
 public, disclose a bold eco-
 nomic program still strongly
 oriented toward rapid indus._
 trialization.   They do provide,
 however, for sharply
 increased spending
 on agriculture, which
 the leadership feels
 needs a stimulant if
 ambitious investment
 plans are to be con--
 tinued.   The leader-
 ship aims to cut non-
 productive spending
 to the bone by re-
 ducing administrative
 overhead and by par-

 USSR SCIENTIST SUGGESTS PERMANENT
 At a meeting of the Special
 Committee of Antarctic Research
 of the International Council of
 Scientific Unions at The Hague
 on 3-5 February 1958, Soviet
 delegate M. M. Somov, suggested
 that an international effort
 be undertaken to construct ad-
 ditional  meteorological sta-
 tions in Antarctica for use
 after the end of the Interna-
 tional Geophysical Year (IGY)
 in December 1958..  Following
 this initiative, other delegates
 at the conference suggested a
 total of 12 new stations, of
 which seven were coastal and
 five in the interior, located
 to provido a more desirable
 meteorological  network.
 Somov, who is head of the
 staff of the Soviet   "Complex
 last year's $184,000,000.   Thus
 China's net foreign payments
 this year will amount to approx-
 imately 3.7 percent of its total
 budgetary outlay.
 The. apparent termination
 of Soviet economic credits,
 which in any case paid for only
 2.6 percent of total imports
 during the First Five-Year Plan,
 will   not  greatly  affect
 Peiping's economic or political
 orientation toward the bloc.
 China will remain heavily de-
 pendent on deliveries from the
 USSR for completion of the re-
 maining 99 of the 156 key

 Somov's remarks are an at-

 the Soviet intention to remain

 under cover of this expanded

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 Although there has been
 some improvement in living
 standards in 1957--largely
 through drawing on short-term
 foreign credits and using do-
 mestic goods reserves--Gomulka
 to date has made little head-
 way in solving the country's
 serious economic problems.
 The regime has repeatedly stat-
 ed. that there will be no wage
 increases in 1958, and that an
 effort will be made to balance
 Poland's unfavorable trade.po-
 sition.  Polish economic ex-
 perts take the view that the
 only feasible way to raise the
 living standard is through in-
 creased productivity.
 Higher worker productivity
 was    the aim behind politburo
 economic expert Jedrychowski's
 proposal, reiterated at the
 plenum, to dismiss superfluous
 workers in industry.   Approxi-
 mately 200,900  _ndustrial work-
 ers and administrative officers
 would lose their jobs in the
 reshuffle and an attempt would
 be made to channel the released
 manpower into other employment,
 such as that on state farms,
 and to other areas, particularly
 the thinly populated former
 German territories.   The rais-
 ing of the minimum old-age pen-
 sion will probably free addi
 tional jobs for the surplus
 labor force.   About 150,000
 pensioners supplement their
 present benefits by working.
 The prospect of increased
 unemployment   resulting  from
 the labor transfers and the
 raising of the extremely low
 rents on housing--which will
 spur popular unrest--touched
 off a bitter attack on Gomulka
 by Deputy Minister of Labor and
 Social Welfare Klosiewicz, who
 was promptly expelled from his
 government post and from the
 central committee.
 Trade union chief during
 Poland's Stalinist era, Klosie-
 wicz is a prominent member of
 the Natolin_. faction which
 challenged Gomulka's refusal
 to acknowledge at the central
 committee's May 1957 plenum
 the leading role of the Soviet
 party in bloc affairs.   He ap-
 parently took the opportunity
 last week to air the old griev-
 ance,, stating that Gomulka
 was reluctant to acknowledge
 at the November conference of
 bloc party leaders in Moscow,
 the leading role played by the
 Soviet party.   Klosiewicz also
 criticized Gomulka's "soft"
 treatment of revisionism in the
 party, accusing the first sec-
 retary of expelling a few
 "little fish''  while allowing
 the big ones to retain their
 party positions:.':
 The plenum approved, how-
 ever, the Polish delegation's
 role at the Moscow conference
 as being consistent with the
 party's political line.
 While a resurgence of
 antirevisionist propaganda has
 been evident in the Soviet Union,
 the latest Natolin challenge
 was probably not inspired by
 Moscow.   Khrushchev's confidence
 in Gomulka's efforts to improve
 the socialist economy as  ex-
 pressed in his January speech
 at Minsk and the initiative
 allowed Poland in promulgating
 the Rapacki plan indicate that
 some rapprochement has probably
 been reached between the two
 leaders.   While Gomulka's re-
 tention of his position still
 ultimately hinges on the out-
 come of his economic program,
 the prompt rebuff of Klosiewicz
 and the committee's backing of
 Gomulka's economic and political
 positions testify to Gomulka's
 continued strength in the party.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 BRITISH LABOR DEMANDING NEW MOVES ON DISARMAMENT
 The British Trades Union
 Congress     (TUC) is joining with
 the Labor party in a nationwide
 campaign to demand that the
 Macmillan government show more
 initiative in seeking interna-
 tional agreement on disarmament
 and disengagement.   The govern-
 ment has already shown itself
 sensitive to public opinion on
 these questions and its respon-
 siveness to new pressures will
 be affected by its showing in
 two pending by-elections.
 This is the first time the
 influential TUC has joined the
 Labor party in seeking public
 support on foreign policy is-
 sues.   The joint stand on for-
 eign policy appears essentially
 the same as that approved by the
 parliamentary Labor party,  after
 considerable debate,  last spring.
 The joint draft endorses the
 Gaitskell plan for a neutral
 zone in central Europe and calls
 for a unilateral British sus-
 pension of thermonuclear testing
 for a limited period and a dis-
 armament agreement in several
 stages beginning with an inter-
 national agreement on test sus-
 pension.
 Meanwhile,  some 70 Labor
 MP's are demanding that Britain
 unilaterally renounce the use
 and production of nuclear weap-
 ons and allow no missile bases
 on its territory.   No prominent
 party leaders are represented
 in the group, but it comprises
 about a quarter of the party's
 parliamentary representation
 and has received support from
 Labor's official press organ,
 the Daily Herald.
 In recent months the Mac-
 millan government has repeatedly
 tried to regain popularity by
 conciliatory gestures in foreign
 policy.   It will closely watch
 the results of the two forthcom-
 ing by-elections in judging how
 much it needs to yield to Labor
 demands.   In the first of these,
 on 13 March,  in the Glasgow con-
 stituency of Kelvingrove,  which
 it won by less than 3,000 votes
 in the 1955 general elections,
 the government will campaign
 under relatively favorable con-
 ditions--a strong Conservative
 candidate,  no Liberal party com-
 petition, and a Labor vote split
 by the candidacy of an independ-
 ent Labor Party member

 PROSPECTS OF THE YDIGORAS REGIME IN GUATEMALA
 Miguel Ydigoras Fuentes,
 who was inaugurated for a six-
 year term in the presidency on
 2 March,  will have difficulty
 restoring political stability
 in Guatemala.   His apparent in-
 tention to follow a middle-of-
 the-road political course will
 be ?bitterly resented by extreme
 rightists,  who form the core of
 his organized political support.
 It was apparent even before the
 inauguration that he would have
 difficulty controlling the Con-
 gress, in which his followers
 form a minority.
 The plurality Ydigoras won
 in the 19 January election re-
 sulted more from his personal
 appeal than from having a well-
 defined program or effective
 political machine.   His follow-
 ers range from extreme conserva-
 tives to moderate leftists.  He
 has gone to considerable lengths
 since the election to allay the
 fear of many that he might re-
 sort to repressive dictatorship.
 His cabinet appointments and
 his preinaugural statements sug-
 gest that he will attempt to a-
 dopt moderate political policies.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In rejecting the authori-
 tarian policies advocated by
 those who  'form''the   oldest,
 wealthiest, and most cohesive
 group of his supporters,   Ydi-
 goras stands to lose much of the
 organized support he has here-
 tofore enjoyed.   He clearly
 hopes to gain in its stead the
 backing of unorganized but po-
 tent forces from the middle and
 lower classes and of elements
 from the moderate and leftist
 parties which supported his op-
 ponents in the election.   His
 cabinet appointments were ob-
 viously calculated to accomplish
 this end.   Carlos Garcia Bauer,
 his foreign minister,  is a mod-
 erate lefts-,t.   One other minis-
 ter was a supporter of Ydigoras'
 moderate opponent in the elec-
 tion.
 A four-month-old dispute
 between the American-owned In-
 ternational Railways of Central
 America and the railway workers'
 union,  the strongest union in
 Guatemala, is expected to test
 Ydigoras' policy in the impor-
 tant field of labor relations.
 A crippling strike is a possi-
 bility.
 The Guatemalan Army, which
 lacks effective leadership and
 is not united,  is not expected
 to be an immediate threat to
 Ydigoras.   The President has
 many enemies among the officers,
 however,  and   any  marked   de-
 cline                                                                       in his  popular   support
 is  likely   to    result in mil-
 itary                                                                       plots to   oust   him.
 NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN ARGENTINE OIL POLICY
 The provisional Aramburu
 regime has reopened the politi-
 cally explosive question of for-
 eign participation in Argentina's
 largely state-owned oil industry
 and has hinted that it will try
 to implement   the   so-called
 Yadarola oil development plan
 before President-elect Frondizi
 takes office on 1 May. During
 the election campaign, Frondizi
 strongly opposed any change in
 the country's nationalistic oil
 policy, but he apparently ap-
 proves of the provisional gov-
 ernment's effort to reshape
 public opinion on the subject.

 said that the Argentine State
 Oil Fields Administration does
 not have the funds to undertake
 a development program adequate
 to meet Argentina's growing
 needs.   He said Argentina is
 "going broke" because of oil
 imports while it has "vast"
 proved reserves of its own. He
 also disclosed the details of
 the Yadarola plan, which was

 January by Argentina's ambas-

 Under the plan,
 the government would
 retain ownership of
 the oil but would
 contract with private
 foreign companies for     1300
 exploration and pro-
 duction.   The compa-
 nies would make an-
 nual payments for
 the privilege of ex-
 ploring and would be
 reimbursed only if
 they succeed in get-
 ting oil above ground.
 The most controver-
 sial part of the plan
 is a provision for
 the companies to be
 paid in oil,  since
 nationalist opinion
 strongly objects to

 any foreign company
 being allowed to dis-
 pose of Argentine re-
 sources.
 Frondizi's tacit
 approval of the plan
 apparently stems from
 his recognition of the
 role oil imports have
 played in Argentina's
 mounting trade deficit.
 The state oil fields,
 with a minor assist
 from private compa-
 nies operating tiny,
 pre-1935 concessions,
 supply over 35 per-
 cent of Argentina's
 needs, but supplemen-
 tary imports cost an estimated
 $270,000,000 in 1957 and ac-
 counted for nearly 80 percent
 of the country's trade deficit.
 To conserve dwindling dollar
 and sterling reserves,  Argen-
 tina has been seeking large
 quantities of Soviet bloc crude
 oil but has been unable to sign
 any contracts to date.
 Frondizi will probably be
 evasive in commenting publicly
 on the Yadarola plan until he

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 USSR SUPREME SOVIET ELECTIONS
 According to the Soviet
 constitution, the Supreme Soviet
 is the highest governmental body
 in the USSR.   The approximately
 1,380 Supreme Soviet seats are
 divided between two houses, both
 elected directly: the Soviet of
 the Union and the Soviet of Na-
 tionalities.                          Although both
 houses have the same powers,
 the    Soviet of  the Union,
 larger by  approximately 100
 deputies,  is  generally consid-
 ered to  carry more prestige.
 The Supreme Soviet is re-
 quired by law to meet twice a
 year, and the sessions normally
 last  a week  or so.   Between
 sessions, its affairs  are
 handled by   its Presidium. The
 chairman of  the Presidium,   at
 present K. E. Voroshilov,   is
 the titular head of state.
 In practice,  all important
 policy  decisions     in  the
 USSR  are made by the presidium
 of the  central  committee of
 the Communist   party  and by
 the Council of   Ministers, which
 is   nominally subordinate  to
 the  Supreme Soviet.
 The  Supreme Soviet
 and  its Presidium
 routinely ratif y
 these decisions.
 Election Mechanics
 Elections   to
 the  Supreme  Soviet
 are  held  every
 four years on a date
 designated  by   its
 Presidium, which this
 year falls on    16
 March. The  USSR
 was divided into 1,-
 364                election dis-
 tricts  by  the Su-
 preme  Soviet Pre-
 sidium  as announced
 on  5 January. Sep-
 arate  districts are
 established  for
 the   Soviet   of   the Union and
 the Soviet of Nationalities.
 A number of districts are
 to be established for Soviet
 military personnel outside the
 USSR on the basis of one dis-
 trict for every 100,000 serv-
 icemen.   In the 1954 election,
 eight of these districts were
 established,  and each elects
 two deputies:   one to the So-
 viet of the Union and one to the
 Soviet of Nationalities.
 From 1 to 9 February nomi-
 nation meetings were held by
 factories,  schools,  collective
 farms,  youth organizations,  and
 similar groups within each elec-
 tion district.  An individual from
 each district is designated through
 party channels before these meet-
 ings are held,  ensuring the unan-
 imous support of the regime's
 choice.   A general district meet-
 ing composed of delegates from
 the various preliminary meetings
 then formally nominates the
 unanimously supported candidate.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The procedure is complicat-
 ed by the multitudinous "honor-
 ary" nominations of top party
 leaders, at least one of whom
 is nominated in nearly every
 electoral district.   The elec-
 tion law provides that  a pros-
 pective  candidate may be nomi-
 nated in any number of districts
 but may be registered as a can-
 didate in only one.                  According-
 ly, on 8 February, by means of
 an open circular letter, each
 full and candidate member of
 the party presidium   (except
 Pervukhin who was not designated
 as a candidate) withdrew  from
 all but one of the election dis-
 tricts in which he had  been
 nominated and, as in 1954, sec-
 ond candidates were on hand to
 accept the nominations declined
 by the top leaders.   Consequent-
 ly, the Soviet elector will be
 presented with only one candi-
 date for each office when he
 votes on 16 March.
 The Election "Campaign"
 The two-month period pre-
 ceding the election is one of
 intense agitation to arouse the
 patriotism of the people and
 to "get out the vote" in order
 to display  monolithic  unity
 and enthusiasm for the regime
 and its policies.  The entire
 Soviet population is mobilized
 for the campaign by hundreds
 of thousands of citizens en-
 listed as agitators, or elected
 in late January to the district
 and precinct election commis-
 sions.   If the election runs
 true to form, something over
 99.9 percent of eligible voters
 will turn out to vote for the
 "Communist and nonparty bloc"
 candidates.
 The campaign is climaxed
 a week before the elections by
 meetings of candidates  with
 their constituents.   At this
 time the top leaders make well-
 publicized speeches.
 Political Weather Vane
 Apart from serving as a
 vehicle for the expression of
 policy statements by party lead-
 ers, the elections disclose per-
 sonnel changes and help to in-
 dicate the relative political
 importance of top  officials.
 While usually about half of the
 Supreme Soviet deputies are out-
 standing workers and peasants
 whose selection may be left to
 the discretion of local leaders
 supervised by regional party
 committees,   the  remaining 50
 percent of the deputies reads
 like a Soviet Who's Who.   The
 selection of these nominees
 and their election district is
 carefully regulated and coordi-
 nated by higher party bodies.
 Although knowledge of the actual
 behind-the-scenes  nomination
 procedure for the Supreme So-
 viet is limited,  it   appears
 to be carefully controlled by
 the secretariat of the party
 central committee.
 The "honorary" nominations
 of top party leaders, as reported
 by the Soviet press, reflect
 the political standing of party
 chieftains.   In March 1954, for
 example, a tabulation  of  the
 number of  nominations of top
 Soviet leaders revealed a dis-
 crepancy  with  the official
 hierarchical listings of  the
 time. Whereas Molotov was of-
 ficially listed second to Malen-
 kov, followed by Khrushchev in
 third place, a, listing based on
 the number of nominations pub-
 lished in the   press   showed
 Khrushchev second to Malenkov
 and ahead of Molotov. Subse-
 quent events revealed that in
 general these 1954 nomination
 listings reflected the power
 situation more accurately than
 did the official hierarchical
 listing.
 A similar compilation this
 year may be even more indicative,

 since all presidium members'
 names have been listed alpha-
 betically since mid-1954.
 Judging by the number of
 "honorary" nominations as re-
 ported in both the central and
 regional press, Khrushchev is
 clearly set apart from other
 resi.diumt members.   He received
 well over twice as many nomina-
 tions as Voroshilov,  his nearest
 competitor in this strictly con-
 trolled popularity contest.
 This performance compares well
 with that of Stalin in 1950,
 when the central press reported
 that he received twice as many
 nominations as Molotov,             who
 then stood next in line.

 Honors accorded Voroshilov
 reflect his position as chair-

 Presidium and his status as an
 "Old Bolshevik" rather than his
 actual political strength.
 Party presidium member Kirichen-
 ko, while slightly behind Voro-
 shilov,  fared extremely well,
 running nearly on a par with
 Mikoyan and ahead of Suslov.
 While the "honorary" nominations
 make it clear that there is at
 present no obvious successor
 to Khrushchev,  the showing of
 Kirichenko is noteworthy,  es-
 pecially in view of numerous re-

 Premier.Bulganin, who received
 the least number of honorary
 nominations of any full member
 of the party presidium and who
 was finally registered in the
 relatively little-known Maykop
 election district in the North
 Caucasus,  may portend his res-
 ignation as premier.   The ab-
 sence of Mikhail Pervukhin  from
 the nomination lists was an
 indication of a change in his
 job status and this was confirmed
 recently by his appointment as
 ambassador to East Germany.
 Party presidium members
 Kozlov and Belyayev stand at the
 bottom of the list with Bulganin.
 In Belyayev's case this probably
 indicates at least a temporary
 diminution of his party prestige
 as a result of his transfer from
 the post of secretary of the
 central committee to first secre-
 tary of Kazakhstan.   As for Koz-
 lov,  it suggests,  contrary to
 recent speculation,  that he is
 not being built up in prepara-
 tion for replacing Bulganin as
 premier.
 The registration lists of
 candidates, now being published,
 to date have not revealed any
 hitherto unannounced personnel
 changes among the secondary eche-
 lons of government and party
 leaders with the exception of
 the replacement of party first
 secretaries in Mari Oblast and
 the Komi Autonomous Republic.
 Some names are conspicuously
 absent from this year's roster
 of prospective deputies.   The
 Soviet press has announced that
 the denounced Malenkov,  Molotov,
 Kaganovich,  and Shepilov have
 "lost the support of the people"
 and hence will not be nominated.

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RYUKYU ISLANDS
 The United States' adminis-
 tration of the Ryukyu  Islands
 has been plagued by anti-Ameri-
 can elements who have made elec-
 tion gains by exploiting  the
 discontent  with American land
 acquisition and compensation
 policies and the nationalistic
 sentiment for reversion of the
 islands to Japan.  Their activ-
 ity has promoted increasing re-
 sentment among the Ryukyuans to-
 ward the American administration.
 Although the Ryukyus were
 governed as an integral part of
 Japan before 1945, they were
 treated as a separate territory
 in the Japanese peace treaty of
 1951, under which  the United
 States  exercises full control
 of  the Ryukyus but  recognizes
 Japan's residual sovereignty.
 The Amami island group immedi-
 ately north of Okinawa and tra-
 ditionally considered part of
 the prefecture of the southern
 Japanese home island of Kyushu,
 on 24 December 1953 reverted,
 by an American concession, to
 Japanese control.
 The administration of the
 Ryukyus is based on an execu-
 tive order of President Eisen-
 hower issued on 5 June 1957.
 The order includes a provision
 for a unicameral legislature of
 29 members directly elected
 every two years.   The legisla-
 ture's powers are nominal, how-
 ever, and the American high com-
 missioner exercises complete
 authority over the islands.   He
 can promulgate laws,  veto acts
 of the legislature, and remove
 any official.   The commissioner
 exercised his power in late No-
 vember  1957                                                               when  he  revised

 The Japanese Government
 officially accepts the present
 status of the Ryukyus while un-
 officially pressing, as a max-
 imum demand,for administrative
 control with America retention
 of base rights and, as a mini-
 mum, control of education.   To
 embarrass the government of
 Prime Minister Kishi, Japan's
 opposition Socialist party
 is publicly demanding return of
 the Ryukyus.   This in turn has
 forced Kishi to take a public
 position on major problems of
 Okinawan administration in op-
 position to American policies,
 and publicly to press for Jap-
 anese administrative rights.
 Economic Problems
 The economy of the Ryukyus,
 which is principally dependent
 on agriculture and the American
 bases, is beset by growing pop-
 ulation pressure on meager land
 resources.   The total land area
 of 921 square miles is smaller
 than the state of Rhode Island.
 With 1,200 persons per square
 mile, the Ryukyus are among the
 most densely populated areas in
 the world.   The requisition of
 20 percent of the arable land
 for military bases, housing,
 and other facilities has dis-
 possessed over 50,000 families,
 placing a strain on the local
 economy,  which is incapable of
 providing nonagricultural jobs
 for the displaced landowners.

 applicable to Ryukyuans employed
 on the military bases have been
 chronic problems of the American
 administration.
 The Ryukyuans' deep attach-
 ment for ancestral holdings and
 the prestige value of landown-
 ership in an agrarian economy
 attaches social and religious
 significance to the land requi-
 sitioning program.   This com-
 bination of factors has led to
 strenuous opposition to American
 proposals of lump-sum settle-
 ments for indefinite occupation
 of land held by the military.
 Instead, the Ryukyuans are de-
 manding payment of a yearly
 rental which would be periodi-
 cally renegotiated.   They main-
 tain that this procedure would
 more equitably compensate for
 the loss of the land without
 implying surrender of ownership
 rights.
 The labor problem, affect-
 ing over 51,000 Ryukyuan em-
 ployees at military bases, stems
 from dissatisfaction with wage

 rates, which are substantially
 below those prevailing in the
 local economy for comparable
 work.   The Ryukyuans resent as
 racial discrimination the wage
 differentials between Ryukyuan
 workers and the larger number
 foreign  workmen,   but  the
 Ryukyuan believes he has since
 gained in experience and train-
 ing.
 The income derived from
 military bases and expenditures
 by thousands of Americans sta-
 tioned on the islands have re-
 sulted in a new high level of
 living for the majority of the
 Ryukyuans.   However, an unfavor-
 able comparison with the stand-
 ard of American residents is
 frequently made.
 Political Situation
 Prior to the election of
 pro-Communist Senaga as mayor
 of Naha, the capital city of
 the Ryukyus, in 1956 the polit-
 ical    scene  was  relatively
 quiet, with the conservatives,
 who generally favor American
 administration of the islands,
 controlling most elective of-
 fices.   The growing leftist
 trend in local elections and
 increased agitation for a change
 in the administrative policy,
 however, has focused attention
 on the 16 March elections to
 the Ryukyuan legislature, which
 are expected to show the degree
 to which the strength of the
 conservatives has been eroded
 by the leftists.
 There are no basic differ-
 ences between the official plat-
 form and policies of the conserv-
 ative  Ryukyus Democratic party
 (RDP) and the moderate left-of-
 center Socialist Masses party
 (SMP).   Consequently, the abil-
 ity of either to maintain the
 support of its members is based

 er sincerity but less political
 acumen.   The death in October
 1956 of the US-appointed Ryu-,
 kyuan chief executive, Shuhei
 Higa, who was president of the
 "'IDP, left the party without ef-
 fective leadership and increased
 the internal factional struggle.
 The subsequent appointment of
 Jugo Thoma,  an independent, as
 chief executive presaged a de-
 cline in conservative strength.
 A new leftist political
 grouping, the Liaison Council
 for the Protection of Democracy
 (LCPD), which developed during
 the recent Naha election con-
 tests, has registered as a polit-
 ical party and will run candi-

 aloof instead of entering candi-

 recently developed strength.
 He will probably attempt to or-
 ganize the elected leftists
 after the voting.   Independents
 of various political coloration
 will run on local issues to cap-
 italize on personal loyalties,
 and are expected to hold the
 balance of power in the legisla-
 ture.
 The Ryukyuans consider them-
 selves Japanese as a result of
 their long history as an inte-
 gral part of Japan.   Continued
 cultural ties since World War
 II have made the eventual rever-
 sion to Japan a basic feature
 of Ryukyuan attitudes.   The is-
 lands have neither the economic
 base nor the nationalistic senti-
 ment necessary for creation of a
 separate state.
 The OPP won only one seat
 and obtained only 6 percent of
 the total vote in the 1956 leg-
 islative election.   The LCPD,
 however,  has demonstrated high-
 ly efficient electioneering tech-
 niques in the Naha area, where
 traditional political patterns
 have broken down, and the party
 probably will be able to expand
 its influence outside the urban
 area.

 against those in authority.
 Nevertheless, failure to satisfy
 Ryukyuan grievances and to min-

 could jeopardize relations with
 Japan and undermine American
 prestige in the Far East.

 in these countries, for which
 Egypt is the only qualified
 source.
 Some host governments have
 objected to their obvious engage-

 action;  in other countries,  they
 have found opportunities for pro-
 moting the Egyptian line among
 students and youth organizations,
 apparently with significant ef-

 Near East have assuredly  re-

 Egypt has long had an edu-

 stemming from the period when
 Britain controlled both coun-
 tries.   The high level of Egyp-
 tian influence in the Sudan
 during the Anglo-Egyptian con-
 dominium has diminished consid-
 erably since Sudanese independ-
 ence in 1956, but Egypt's assets
 there remain formidable.
 There are more than 20 Egyp-
 tian schools, with an enrollment
 of about 9,000, as well as a.
 branch of Cairo University in
 Khartoum, with approximately 800
 students.   In addition, hundreds
 of adults study at the "Popular
 University," which is sponsored
 by Egypt, and more than 1,000
 Sudanese are studying in Egypt
 on scholarships provided by the
 Nasir regime.   The American

 that there are well over 300
 Egyptian teachers in the Sudan.

 a new "good-will" approach,
 bolstered by Egypt's construc-
 tion of a new school and hospi-

 pletion in Mogadiscio before
 1960.
 Tunisia, Morocco, and Libya
 have also been penetration tar-

 ed an Egyptian offer of 400
 teachers made last November, the
 Tunisian ambassdor in Cairo
 stating that such teachers "gen-
 erally become involved in sub-
 versive activities."   In Morocco
 there are 14 Egyptian teachers
 on the staff of the Egyptian
 Lycde in Rabat, with another 66
 spread throughout the country,
 mostly in the major population
 centers.
 In Libya, schools during
 the 1956-57 academic year em-
 ployed about 400 Egyptians.   The
 Libyan Government,  fully aware
 of the propaganda, effort of these
 teachers, attempted to find re-
 placements in Lebanon during the
 summer of 1957.   However, Leba-
 nese qualified to teach are gen-
 erally able to find employment
 in more attractive or better-
 paying areas, and the Libyan ef-
 fort to replace the undesirable
 Egyptians was largely unsuccess-
 ful.
 Hundreds of Nasir's aca-

 Egyptian education mission to

 mer of 1957, probably with ex-
 aggeration,that 500 were sent
 to the kingdom during 1956-57,
 while another 600 were employed
 there under private contracts.
 He estimated that during 1957-
 58 the number would be increased
 by about 100 in each category.

 Iraq, aware of the danger
 from Egyptian teachers, refused
 to admit 120 replacements for
 those who finished their duties
 and were returning home in Octo-
 ber 1957.   Egyptian newspapers
 claimed the Iraqi reluctance
 to accept replacements was dic-
 tated by the United States
 through the Baghdad Pact.   There
 are at present about 185 Egyp-
 tians teaching in Iraq.
 In the Persian Gulf states
 of Kuwait and Bahrein, Egyptian
 teachers have been extremely
 active in radical-nationalist
 agitation.   Nearly 400 are em-
 ployed in Kuwait, in addition
 to a large number of former
 Palestinians who probably are
 sympathetic toward the Egyptian
 line.   Kuwait's total teacher
 population is about 1,500, but
 the American consul believes the
 influence of the Egyptians re-
 mains disproportionate to their
 numbers.
 Just prior to its union
 with Egypt on 1 February, Syria
 was employing over 500 Egyptian
 teachers, according to an offi-
 cial in the Ministry of Educa-
 tion, with the majority of them
 in secondary schools.   Syrian
 sentiment favoring the Egyptian
 cause has been most prevalent
 and overt among students, en-
 couraged by the teachings of the
 Egyptians.
 Lebanon, with its relative-
 ly high-level educational facil-
 ities, has not needed to rely
 heavily on Egyptian assistance.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 6 March 1958
 Egypt, however,  is financing the
 construction of a new university
 in Beirut which, as a Moslem in-
 stitution and a branch of the
 University of Cairo, will com-
 pete with the American Universi-
 ty and the French-sponsored Uni-
 versity of St. Joseph.
 In Jordan there are only a
 negligible number of Egyptians.
 The government has maintained
 tight restrictions since the
 Nasir-backed coup attempt in
 April 1957.
 Evaluation
 In such states as Jordan,
 where the government is openly
 hostile to Nasir, or where the
 need 42or assistance   is  not
 pressing,      as in Lebanon, the
 Egyptian educational offensive
 has  little potential.   However,
 other countries of Africa and
 the Near East, seeking the im-
 provement of their growing pop-
 ulations and lacking adequately
 trained nationals, must accept
 foreign instructors, and Egypt
 is at present the best-prepared
 and the most anxious provider.
 The magnitude of the Egyptian
 effort is largely reflected by
 the number of teachers employed,
 but this provides a. criterion
 of only questionable reliability.
 The teachers' influence may be
 greater in areas like Syria,
 where their numbers are small
 relative to the total teaching
 body  but where historical or
 present developments make their
 students especially receptive
 to their guidance.
 The attempts made by such
 governments as those of Libya,
 Iraq, Tunisia, and Jordan to
 forbid the entry of Egyptian
 teachers or to decrease their
 number indicates an official
 conviction that they do possess
 a   noteworthy subversive poten-
 tial as well as an official
 sense of helplessness to cope
 with the situation.   These teach-
 ers' presence throughout the
 area will undoubtedly continue
 to be used by Nasir as a foreign
 policy instrument fostering at-
 titudes favorable to Egypt and
 undermining the popular bases
 of those governments not pledg-
 ing allegiance to his objec-
 tives.
