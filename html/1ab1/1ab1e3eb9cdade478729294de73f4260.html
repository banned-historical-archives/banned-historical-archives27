 COMMUNIST CHINA'S DOMESTIC CRISIS: THE ROAD TO 1964
 This is a working paper of the DD/I Research Staff.
 It analyzes the erratic development of Chinese domestic
 policy in the past 15 years and tries to shed new light
 on this question and also on the Sino-Soviet relation-
 ship and the matter of disagreements among Chinese leaders.
 The paper attempts among other things to answer the
 question of what Mao Tse-tung and his favorites have
 learned from the failure of their "leap forward."  It con-
 cludes that they have learned some lessens, but that they
 have not learned the most important lesson--that the "leap
 forward" strategy is itself defective--and that they are
 therefore likely to undertake another "leap," perhaps in
 1966.

 INTRODUCTION
 A crucial question in assessing the future course
 of domestic policy in Communist China is the extent to
 which Mao Tse-tung and his lieutenants have learned the
 lessons of the .failure of their "leap forward" approach
 to economic development.   In undertaking to answer this
 question, this paper will attempt to reconstruct the pain-
 ful process of education experienced by the Chinese Com-
 munists in the economics of industrializing an overpopu-
 lated and underdeveloped country.
 Central to this process of education has been a
 continuing debate within the Chinese Communist leader-
 ship over economic and military policy, a debate in
 which the relevance of Soviet experience and the role
 of Soviet aid have been questions of great importance.
 This paper will attempt to shed further light on this
 debate by supplementing the findings of past POLO and
 ESAU papers with new insights gained from an intensive
 review of the record.   In this review, particular atten-
 tion has been given to clandestine reporting, which has
 added much to our understanding of the origins of the
 Sino-Soviet dispute, of the leadership crisis precipitated
 by the Peng Te-huai affair in mid-1959, and of the
 economic and political breakdown following the collapse
 of the "great leap forward" in 1960.
 This paper emphasizes throughout the views and
 policies advocated by Mao Tse-tung, who appears to
 'dominate his party and government much more than does
 Khrushchev in the Soviet Union.   We think that any as-
 sessment of national development policy in Communist China
 .must center on the personality and conceptions of the
 man who has assumed the role of a latter-day Lenin --
 Mao Tse-tung.

 C0Mi'IUNIST CHINA'S DOMESTIC CRISIS:   THE ROAD TO 1964
 Summary and Conclusions
 The Background of the "Leap Forward"
 There have been ambiguous and contradictory elements
 in Communist China's approach to economic development from
 the outset. On the one hand,1:there has been an awareness
 of inexperience in undertaking this new task and of the
 consequent need to rely on Soviet advice and assistance.
 On the other hand, there has been an intensely national
 and racial component in Chinese Communism (e.g. the claim
 advanced as early as 1946 that Mao Tse-tung had "created
 a Chinese or Asiatic form of Marxism'') which has served
 to discourage Soviet leaders (even Stalin) from supply-
 ing the very economic, scientific and technical and mili-
 tary assistance essential to China's modernization.   The
 component of Chinese chauvinism, combined with Mao Tse-
 tung's personal arrogance, has proved dominant:  Mao has
 repudiated the Soviet model of economic development and
 has sought his own solutions to the staggering problems
 of developing China's backward economy.
 In statements issued in late 1949 and early 1950,
 Mao Tse-tung expressed his strategic contempt for China's
 population problem and advanced a call for "three years
 of preparation" and "for ten years of construction to
 build our country into a modern socialist state."  As an
 early expression of Mao's revolutionary optimism and
 propensity to advance unrealistic -economic goals, these
 statements constituted a significant precursor of Commun-
 ist China's "leap forward" approach to economic develop-
 ment.
 As the result of a series of setbacks and disappoint-
 ments, Communist China's First Five Year Plan (1953-1957)
 was delayed in preparation and was not released until
 July 1955.   In contrast with Mao's earlier .predictions,

 the plan pictured industrialization and socialization
 of the economy as "a Herculean task requiring a compara
 tively long time" (that is, three five-year plans for
 basic achievement, and 40 to 50 years to attain the
 status of a highly industrialized great power), and it
 stressed that ''the road already traveled by the Soviet
 Union is the road we must follow today."  Within a matter
 of weeks, however, Chairman Mao would rise before a Con-
 ference of Provincial Party Secretaries on'31 July 1955
 to countermand this directive and to point imperiously
 to another road.
 Dissatisfied with the rate and method of advance
 provided by the Soviet model, Mao Tse-tung apparently
 decided at t1 is~ `time to devise a new approach to the
 special'problems of China's economic development.   As
 outlined in a series of speeches and articles in the
 ,latter half of 1955 and in early 1956, this new approach
 was essentially an attempt to apply the "mass line"--
 which had proved so successful in the political and
 military struggles of China's revolution--to the infinitely
 more complicated process of socialist construction.
 Faith in the power of ideology to guide and motivate,
 in the efficacy of political work, and in the "unlimited
 creative power" of the masses--these were the main ingre-
 dients of 'the "leap forward" approach to the socializa--
 t ion and construction of China's economy introduced by
 Mao Tse-tung in tentative and incomplete form at this
 time.
 As is well nno,,in, Mao'.s call in mid-3
 955 for an "u
 -
 .
 p
 surge" in the socialization of China's agriculture resulted
 in drastically foreshortening the original timetable from
 three five-year plans (1953-1967).to a little over one
 year.   Mao's rationale for stepping up socialization at
 this time is of fundamental importance for understanding
 the subsequent evolution of domestic policy in Communist
 China.  For the first time, China's special conditions
 (a huge population,. shortage.of?cultivated land, recurring

 natural calamities and backward methods of farming) were
 advanced to justify a distinctive Chinese approach to
 agricultural development.   Central to this now approach
 was Mao's view that manpower, properly organized and
 motivated (in the lower and higher level cooperatives and
 subsequently in the communes), could be substituted for
 tractors and other iuachinery in a program of rapid agri-
 cultural development.
 Elated b'y the successful speed-up of collectiviza-
 tion, Chairman Mar, called in December 1955 for a parallel
 "upsurge" in economic development.  Basing his call on
 an almost mystical belief in the "unlimited creative
 power" of the masses and stressing the principle that
 "political work is the lifeline of all economic work,"'-.the
 Chinese leader shortly thereafter launched China's Draft
 Twelve Year Program for Agriculture (containing the in-
 spiring if unrealistic target of doubling food production)
 and a companion Twelve Year Plan for Science and Techno-
 logy (containing the equally unrealistic target of achiev-
 ing advanced world levels in scientific research by 1967)
 And in order to fulfill Mao's prediction of a tremendous
 expansion of production following agricultural collecti-
 vization, a massive investment and construction program
 was carried out in the countryside which would subsequently
 be described as Communist China's first "leap forward"
 in economic development.
 It is instructive to compare this program with that
 advanced by Mao's future antagonist, Khrushchev, at the
 20th CPSU Congress held in February 1956.   Of first import-
 ancv was the contrast:, between Mao's emphasis on ideological
 and political work as the key to economic development and
 Khrushchev's dc--emphasis of theory in favor of "practical
 workk" and  'material incentives."  Moreover, since the Pei-
 ping regime would counterpose the concept of a "self-
 rel i ant and comprehensive industrial system" shortly there-
 after, there is reason to believe that Mao already opposed
 the degree': of bloc economic integration advocated by
 Khrushchev at this congress.   In retrospect,  it appears
 that major issues in the Sino-Soviet dispute over economic.
 policy and economic relations had already emerged by the
 spring df 1956.

 The second half of 1956 was a time of disillusion
 and alarm.  for the Peiping regime, disillusion over the
 failure (particularly in agriculture) of the first "leap
 forward" in economic development, and alarm over the reper-
 cussions of de-Stalinization within the Communist bloc.
 It was a time for reappraisal of domestic policies, a
 process in which Soviet views on economic development
 seemed to coincide with those of a moderate grouping of
 government administrators and economic specialists among
 the Chinese leadership to whom Mao Tse-tung apparently
 turned for advice and assistance in restoring order to
 China's disorganized economy.   As the most prominent mem-
 ber of this moderate grouping, Premier Chou En-lai set
 forth a number of these views in his Eighth Party Congress
 report on try' draft proposals for Communist China's Second
 rive Year Plan (1958-1962).
 Despite this moderate trend in domestic policy,'
 there were already signs in the fall of 1956 of mounting
 friction in the relations between Communist China and the
 USSR.    First,i:there were indications that Khrushchev had
 become incensed by Mao's pretensions to leadership of the
 underdeveloped areas of the world.  Of more immediate
 concern to Moscow was Communist China's intervention at
 this time in Eastern Europe, encouraging early Polish and
 Hungarian demands for greater independence and assigning
 much of the blame for disturbances there to Russian "great
 power chauvinism.    Although the Chinese in the winter
 of 1956-57 helped to contain the troubles in the bloc
 that they had helped to produce, the cumulative effect
 of Chinese declarations of economic independence, poli-
 tical independence (encouraging others as well), and
 doctrinal independence was apparently too much for Khru
 shchev to tolerate.   For it was at this point that the
 Soviets threatened for the first time to withdraw their
 experts and technicians from Communist China.
 The best evidence of Mao Tse-tung's more moderate
 approach to China's economic problems at this time is
 found in                             his February 1957 speech     25X1

 contradictions."  Taking as his text the "lessons" of
 the Hungarian revolt, the Chinese leader (1) cited the
 need to substitute methods of "persuasion" in China for
 the "repression" responsible for the Hungarian uprising;

 (2) warned that overemphasis on heavy industry adversely
 affected the public welfare and undermined popular sup-
 port of the party and government;  and (3) advocated a?
 program of birth control in order to ease the pressure
 of population on food supply.
 In short, Mao's speech revealed a now awareness of
 the obstacles confronting China's economic development,
 especially an awareness of the gravity of the population
 problem when,viewed from existing low levels of produc-
 tion.  Having identified the problems, however, Mao of-
 fered only general prescriptions for their solution.
 And in mid-1957, when China's intellectuals lunched a
 damaging "rightist attack" against the CCP, and the sys-
 tem of large-scale agricultural collectives established
 the. preceding year began to disintegrate, the period in
 which Mao Tse-tung appeared to rely on a moderate group-
 ing of "administrator-economists" in the Chinese leader-
 ship came to an abrupt halt.
 The "Great Leap Forward" and Great Retreat
 Dissatisfied with the results of moderate economic
 policies and shocked by the outcome of "liberal" politi-
 cal policies, Mao Tse-tung initiated a series of radical
 policy decisions in late 1957 and early 1958 which would
 culminate in the "great leap forward" and a serious crisis
 in Sino-Soviet relations.   Faced with a rapidly growing
 population, with relative stagnation in food production
 and dwindling food reserves, with a disaffected intellec-
 tual class and with mounting dissatisfaction among the
 peasants and rural cadres, Mao reacted by reviving and
 expanding the "leap forward", labor-intensive approach
 to China's economic development which he had advanced
 in tentative and incomplete form in the winter of 1955-
 1956.
 It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of this
 decisioi--to exploit the economic factor of labor power--:
 in the evolution of the "great leap forward" and commune
 programs.  The underlying premise was a simple one--that

 the solution to the problem o~' uconom:ic development (first
 of all,  agricultural development) lay in the massive and
 intensive application of China's abundant labor supply.
 This tremendously augmented labor effort would have to
 be secured without resort  to material  incentives;  the  incen-
 tive policy had 'Already'. been tried and fouhd wanting and
 in any case was ruled out in order to maximize savings
 and investment for future growth.  Given these conditions,
 it became imperative to devise a mechanism through which
 the party could effectively mobilize and control the rural
 labor-force and at the same time restrict consumption.
 This mechanism would in time appear as the people's com-
 mu>e.
 Following closely after the Chinese Communist cen-
 tral committee plenum, the proceedings of the Moscow
 conference of Communist parties in November 1957 (and
 the negotiations surrounding it) would also exercise strong
 influence over the evolution of China's domestic and
 foreign policies in 1958.  Of first importance was the
 Soviet agreement of October 1957 to assist China in the
 development of an advanced weapons program.   Although
 the contents of this agreement are not known, it very
 likely provided for Soviet assistance in the construction
 of Communist China's Shuang-cheng-tzu missile test range,
 of the Lan-thou gaseous diffusion plant,  and of the mis-
 silo research and development installation near Peiping.
 At the same. time, it is likely that the agreement also
 contained provisions  (either explicit or implied) for
 joint controls and other safeguards which were objection-
 able to Mao on political grouuds.even at the time.
 Communist China's trilogy of distinctive development
 programs--the "general line of socialist construction,"
 the "great leap forward," and the communes--were conceived
 and-developed in secret party conferences in the spring
 of 1958.   At the second session of the Eighth Party Con-
 gress meeting in May, Liu Shao-chi formally introduced
 China's own "general line of socialist construction" and
 epitomized the "great leap forward" spirit by describing
 the age as one when "twenty years are concentrated in a
 day."  It was this session which demonstrated the new.
 dominant role of a group of party-machine leaders who,

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/22 : CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010019-6
 25X1
 togother with Mao Tse-tung, would dominate and control
 the "great leap forward" and commune movements.   As the
 most, prominent member of this grouping, Liu Shao-chi
 provided the rationale for the party's arrogation of
 authority and control over China's economic development
 program when he asserted  "we  can produce: more grain, coal
 and iron by formulating and carrying out correct politi-
 cal lines...by raising the socialist consciousness of
 the workers and arousing the enthusiasm of the masses."
 With the appearance of the commune in July, Communist
 China's unorthodox trilogy of domestic development pro-
 grams was complete.  Representing a return to the "mass
 line" approach to socialist construction, they called for
 total mobilization of all available resources in order
 to break through the formidable barriers to China's
 economic and social development, in particular its huge
 population supported by a weak agricultural base.   Where-
 as X.hrushchev in mid-1959 was to stress that the lack of
 "necessary material conditions" had foredoomed the early
 Soviet experiment with communes, Chairman r.Iao in 195S
 arrived at just the opposite conclusion--that under the
 conditions of a have-not,  underdeveloped oriental economy,
 the commune itself would have to be the instrument to
 effect rapid economic development.
 Because the results are well known, Peiping's fren-
 zied efforts in succeeding months to achieve a "great
 leap forward" in all sectors of the economy will be. only
 briefly summarized.  The first objective was to realize
 a "leap forward" in agriculture by implementing eight
 basic rules of agricultural production (i.Iao Tse-tung's
 ''eight point charter"), with special emphasis on deep
 plowing and close planting as the means for achieving
 a technological break-through in production.   As imple-
 mented with fanatical determination by party enthusiasts,
 first agricultural planning, then agricultural statistics,
 and finally agricultural science were subordinated to
 political ends in the best Stalinist tradition.   The end
 result of this exercise in delusional thinking was Mao's
 claim in October that Communist China would double grain
 production not only in 1958 but also in 1959.

 Following large-scale agricultural construction and
 production,  ?.ie second objective of these programs was
 to promote a "leap forward" in industrial development by
 relying upon labor-intensive "native" technology performed
 by the "greatest labor army in the world."   Incited by
 liae's call in late August "to launch a great leap forward
 in iron and stool production by 15 Selo-,:ember," a gigantic
 peasant labor army in excess of 50 million was organized
 to construct hundreds of thousands of "backyard" iron and
 steel installations throughout rural China.  The third
 objective of China's frenetic speed-up of economic activity
 in 1958 was .to accelerate the mechanization and electri-?
 fication of agriculture.  Following short-lived experi-
 ments with locally-produced "baby" tractors,' the "native"
 production of, ball bearings, and commune construction of
 small hydroelectric power stations, the Chinese Communists
 claimed in September to have discovered in the towing
 cable machine a substitute for "those complicated big
 machines /i.e. tractors7 which are hard and expensive to
 produce" and thus "a short-cut to agricultural mechaniza-
 tion and electrification under the concrete conditions
 of our country."
 These then were the extravagant economic and ideolo-
 gical pretensions initially advanced for Communist China's
 commune and "great leap forward" programs in the summer
 and fall of 1958.   The realization in the maths that fol-
 lowed of the patent falsity of these pretensions was a
 traumatic experience from which the Chinese Communist party
 has yet to recover.  Responding to the pressure of events
 and to the rising tide of ' both Soviet and domestic criti-
 cism, the Chinese Communists initiated a period of "great
 retreat" at the Wuhan central committee plenum in December.
 To Western analysts of Chinese Communist politics, 25X1
 the period extending from the fall of 1958 through the
 summer of 1959 is in many respects the most interesting
 and revealing since the founding of the Chinese People's
 Republic.
 this was a period of active Soviet intervention     25X1
 in the policy deliberations of the Chinese Communist lead-
 ership, ranging from Khrushchev's direct representations
 to Mao Tse-tung, through threats and sanctions, to intrigue

 25X1
 with dissident elements in the Chinese party.   It was also
 a period when domestic opposition to Mao's policies as-
 sumed major proportions.  The convergence and-crystalliza-
 tion of these fords in Minister of National Defense Pen-'
 To-huai's attempt to persuade the CCP central committee
 to reverse course in mid-1959 would not only pose a serious
 challenge to Mao's leadership but also force fundamental
 decisions about China's relationship with the Soviet Union.
 Responding both to Soviet and domestic pressures,
 the Chinese Communist leadersh# was compelled to under-
 take a fundamental and humiliating retreat encompassing 25X1
 both the "great leap forward" and commune programs.
 Because political considerations were to perpetuate hope-
 lessly unrealistic "leap forward" goals until well into
 1959, the magnitude ,of Chinese Communist retreat was more
 readily revealed in the commune program p:>-oper.
 Apparently acting on this assumption, Moscow responded
 with a substantial increase in both military and economic
 assistance in 1959.   Another significant feature of this
 period of general retreat in domestic policy was the return
 to prominence of moderate elements within the Chinese Com-
 munist leadership who presumably favored closer Sino-
 Soviet economic and military cooperation.   Symbolizing
 this development was the re-emergence of Premier Chou En-
 lai as a' principal spokesman for the Chinese Communist
 regime, entrusted with making a conciliatory speech at
 the 21st CPSU Congress in February, with concluding the
 new Soviet economic aid agreement in Moscow, and with re-
 defining the "great leap fox-ward" in more modest terms
 at the April session of China's National People's Congress.

 In retrospect, it appears that this victory by Mao
 Tse-tung and the "party-machine", or "native radical"
 grouping at Lushan was a decisive turning-point in the
 development of Communist China's domestic and foreign
 policy, especially in the development of Sino-Soviet re-
 lations.   Reacting, to Soviet sanctions (in the sudden
 cancellation of the advanced weapons aid agreement) and

 25X1
 to Soviet subversion (in Khrushchev's intrigue with Pone
 To-huai),  the dominant leaders apparently decided at
 Lushan to subordinate the military and economic assets
 of the Soviet alliance to larger political and ideological
 ends.  Another consequence of the Lushan plenum was to
 seriously weaken the influence of more moderate elements
 within the CC?.   Although there would continue to be
 significant policy differences among the Chinese Comm;nis?t
 leadership, the limits of tolerable dissent would be
 sharply circumscribed after this decisive party confer-
 ence.
 The Continuous "Great Leap Forward" and Prolonged Retreat
 The latest completed cycle of advance and retreat
 in Communist China's domestic development program, the
 roughly three-year period extending from the'fall of
 1959 to mid-1962, opened with the defiant prediction of
 "a continuous leap forward throughout the whole decade
 of the sixties" and closed with the unprecedented admis-
 sion that the Chinese Communist party's central committee
 had "lost its way'.' in the charting of economic policy.
 The decisive turning point was, of course, the summer of
 1960 when the combined effects of successive bad harvests
 and Soviet withdrawal of technicians caused the "great
 leap forward" to collapse.   instead of the promised con-
 tinuous "leap forward", the experience of the Chinese
 people so far throughout the 1960's has been one of con-
 tinuous crisis.
 One of the most interesting conclusions emerging
 from a review of this period is that the Chinese Communist
 leadership, having identified and admitted a number of
 mistakes in the implementation of its "great leap forward"
 and commune programs in 1953, then proceeded almost will-
 fully and systematically to make ,the same mistakes in
 1959-1960.   The apparent explanation for this remarkable
 performance is that it was motivated in large part by
 political considerations, principally the need to uphold
 the prestige of Chairman Mao and' the party leadership
 against internal and increasingly vocal external (Soviet)
 attack.

 The immediate Chinese Communist response to the com-
 bined attack of the Russians and Peng Te-huai at Lushan
 Was to acclaim Mao Tse-tung  ,,the most outstanding contem-
 porary revolutionary, statesman and theoretician of Marx-
 ism-Leninism."   Of particular interest wore the nevi claims
 advanced at this time for Mao's creative development of
 the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist construction.
 For the first time, the Chinese leader was credited with
 discovering a number of principles underlying the "high-
 speed expansion of socialist construction," especially
 his "discovery" that the human factor ("subjective ini-
 tiative") outweighed the material. factor in the production
 process and that political. indoctrinat:on was more import-
 ant than material incentives In increasing production.
 The first step in reviving the "leap forward" approach
 to economic development in the fall of 1959 was to launch
 a nation-wide "socialist education" campaign designed to
 "activate the enthusiasm of the broad masses for labor."
 The next step was once again the subordination of statis-
 tics to political ends, a development revealed with sur-
 prising candor by the newly-appointed Director of the State
 Statistical Bureau in November when he asserted that
 statistics "must reflect and eulogize the great victory
 of the party's general line of socialist construction."
 The third step was revival of the "short cut" strategy
 to agricultural abundance, mechanization and industriali-
 zation which had been such a prominent feature of the
 "great leap forward" in 1958.
 To prepare for the upsurge in agricultural produc-
 tion, China's peasants were once again mobilized in a huge
 labor army totaling 70 million to undertake water conserv-
 ancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in the win-
 ter of 1959.   Still another indication of "leaping pro-    25X1
 gress" in agricultural development: at?::this time was a
 na~xona agricultural science research work confer-
 ence which hailed the "extraordinary results" achieved
 in the cross-fertilization of crop species (e.g. paddy-
 rice with corn) and the cross-breeding of livestock species
 (e.g. cows with pigs, cows with sheep and sheep with pigs).
 The new "short-cut" strategy in the related field of
 agricultural modernization was exemplified'by the announced

 invention of a rico-transplanting machine which could be
 manufactured by commune industrial units employing "native"
 iron and steel and which was to be rushed into operation
 on 70 percent of China's paddy rice fields in 1960.   Even
 more bizarre was the  "ultra-conics"  campaign  (a nation-
 wide drive to equip small steel smelters with ultra-sonic
 whistles) launched ii., the latter half of 1959 as a. desper-
 ation measure "Co improve the quality of steel production
 and sustain a continued "leap forward" in the iron and
 steel industry.
 Equally striking evidence of the purblindness of the
 Chinese Communist leadership was the decision to revive
 a number of the features and goat's of the original commune
 program.  First was a nation-wide drive to restore the
 commune mess-halls and thus control the distribution and
 consumption of foodstuffs in the countryside.   Even more
 objectionable to the peasants was the decision once again
 to coerce individual commune members into surrendering
 their "private plots."  Next was the revelation 'that the
 regime still adhered to the original time-table calling
 for all-people  (i.e. state) ownership over all the means
 of production and output of the communes within a period
 of three to six years.  The final example was the announce-
 ment in March 1960 that the Chinese Communist leadership
 intended to revive the urban communes which had proved
 so impractical  and unpopular in the initial period of
 experimentation in the tall of 1958.
 With the publication of the polemical Lenin Anniver-
 sary pronouncements in April 1960, the Chinese Communists
 issued an unmistakable challenge to Soviet ideological
 and political leadership of the international Communist
 movers nt.   As is now well known, the Soviets responded
 to this challenge at the Bucharest conference in June by
 circulating a long letter denouncing the Chinese and
 threatening to reduce aid unless the CC? backed down.
 When Khrushchev attacked ciao for being as vain and iso-
 lated from reality as Stalin had been and when the Chinese
 responded in kind, including a personal attack on Ihru
 shchev for having "betrayed" Marxism-Leninism, the moment
 of truth had arrived.   With the mass exodus of Soviet
 technicians in August, the Chinese Communists were left

 to cope unaided with perennially difficult economic prob-
 lems suddenly grown much larger.
 The immediate Chinese response to the Soviet with-
 drawal of technicians was one of defiant optimism.   In
 a key 16 August Ned Flag article and in other policy
 statements throughout October and early November, Com-
 munist China's leadership asserted an unshaken confidence
 in its ability to surmount the new economic difficulties.
 As a practical response to the mounting food shortage,
 the regime reduced the already inadequate level of grain
 rations by about 10 percent; halted all non-essential  25X1

 ograms to conserve human energy; and assigned
 increased priority to agriculture for manpower and mate-
 Although official optimism continued for some time,
 indications of alarm began to appear in published dis-
 cussions in early 1961.
 there was a domestic crisis in the winter and spring of
 1960-1961 which for a time appeared to imperil the very
 existence of the Peiping regime.                     25X1
 The basic cause for alarm was the sudden outbreak
 of large-scale dissidence in several calamity-stricken
 provinces in October and November 1960, particularly in
 Honan and Shantung.  The popular uprisings in Honan were
 especially serious, engulfing the entire province and
 far surpassing the ability of loyal militia units to
 maintain order.  Reflecting this, Minister of National
 Defense Lin Piao warned in January that "we ought to
 expect more political troubles and incidents in 1961,
 especially the first half, than in any previous year"
 and called for extraordinary measures "to ensure that
 the armed forces do not get out of hand."

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/22 CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010019-6
 The basic cause of these popular uprisings was,
 of course, the severe shortage of food--reaching famine
 proportions in the disaster areas of East and North
 Chin (a.
 When finally aware of the magnitude of the political
 and economic crisis confronting them, Communist China's
 leadership reacted promptly with a series of urgent cor-
 rective measures.   Of first importance was to ensure the
 continued loyalty of the People's Liberation Army during
 this time of national emergency.   Next were emergency
 actions to cope with the acute food shortage whicki would
 reach its most critical point in the spring of 1961.
 Internally, these included encouraging the cultivation
 of quick-growing catch crops on "private plots" wherever
 possible; exhausting national reserves of grain for emer
 gency distribution; and mobilizing medical personnel to
 go to the countryside to treat the most serious malnutri-
 tion cases.   Externally, all food exports were halted,
 and limited foreign exchange holdings were depleted to
 rush some two million, tons of food imports by May and
 June of 1961.
 Together with the inauguration of these urgent relief
 measures, the Peiping regime was equally concerned with
 devising a rationale for the disastrous results of Com-
 munist China's "great leap forward" in economic develop-
 ment.                               Since party policies were by definition correct,
 it followed that these policies (in the language of the
 Ninth Plenum communique of 20 January 1961) had been
 "sabotaged" by "bad elements, that is, landlord and
 bourgeois elements" among the party's rural cadres, and   25X1
 that accordingly these "bad elements" would have to be
 "purged" in a nation-wide "rectification campaign." E
 signaled the start of
 this announcement 25X1
 a fierce campaign of blood-letting

 in which many party cadres in disaster-stricken "rotten
 areas" were literally sacrificed as scapegoats, with
 the masses exho,_ted to direct their sense of vengeance
 against these "class enemies."
 In less seriously affected areas,  cadre responsi-
 bility took the less reprehensible form of errors and
 defects in the implementation of "correct" party policies.
 Perhaps the most serious of these cadre errors was the
 "empty boasting style" which was held. largely responsible
 for the failure of the "great leap forward."  The standard
 explanation, both then and later, was as follows:   over-
 zealous local cadres had reported false achievements
 (especially exaggerated harvest figures) to higher auth-
 orities, causing them to draw up unrealistic plans and
 (in the more extreme formulation which would be advanced
 by Chou En-lai  in mid-1962) causing the central committee
 "to lose its way."
 As a result of this new appreciation of the gravity
 of their domestic crisis, Communise China's leaders in
 the period of early 1961 apparently decided to adopt a
 policy df at least tactical accommodation toward the Soviet
 Union.   During protracted trade and aid negotiations ex-
 tending through April, the Peiping regime made a number
 of conciliatory gestures,  including the almost unprece-
 dented appearance of Mao Tse-tung and the entire stand-
 ing committee of the politburo at the Soviet embassy
 reception commemorating the Sino-Soviet treaty anniver-
 sary.   Most striking of all was the new importance at-
 tached to Soviet aid by Vice Premier Chen I in a March
 interview with Hungarian newsmen.  Whereas the preced-
 ing November he had publicly denigrated the value of
 Soviet aid, Chen now conceded that "although each of us
 does whatever he can, what is decisive for all of. us is
 naturally the help we receive from the Soviet Union."
 As is now well known,, the "help" which the Chinese
 had hoped to obtain in these negotiations was not forth-
 coming.   Shortly after the conclusion of a disappointing
 trade pact in early April, the Chinese Communists broke
 their four-month silence by granting a loan of $125,000,000
 to Albania as,a reward for its support in the Sino-Soviet

 it had ba un the preceding Aug; ;.lt3t,  Communist China's
 initial period of retreat in domestic policy ended in
 laid-1961 on a note of defiance.
 in contrast with the triumphant celebration of its
 thi~'tieth anniversary a decade earlier, the Chinese Com-
 munist party could find little to celebrate on the oc-
 casion of its fortieth anniver sag' y on 1 July 1961.   in
 a rare allusion to current policy, Liu Shao-chi revealed
 on this occasion that the much-vaunted people,'s commune
 (originally conceived as a comprehersive economic, poli-
 tical, military and social unit) had been redefined as
 an or;aniz'wtion "formed by agricultural cooperatives
 Joining together."  Even this more modest formulation
 would soora be outdated, for  it was just at this time
 that the rural co:urune almost completely disintegrated.
 Following the collapse of the commune messhalls, the re-
 appearance of supply and marketing, handicraf  and credit
 cooperatives signified that Communist China had reverted
 to the pre-commune pattern of inst. institutions in the country-
 side.   What is more, the retreat did not stop with the
 large-scale collective farm (averaging some 250, house-
 holds) which had irunediately preceded  the commune, but
 extended all the way back to the small-scale collective
 farm (averaging 100 households) which had characterized
 the early stages of China's cooperative movement.
 Together with the enforced retreat in rural policy,
 the regime began at this time to implement a series of
 drastic measures designed to rationalize ("readjust")
 China's badly crippled industrial sector.  These measures
 included closing down thousands of small, inefficient
 plants thrown up hastily during the "great leap forward"
 .and the wholesale transfer of surplus industrial labor
 back to rural areas, with the planned figure (including
 dependents and others engaged in supporting is a.des) ing to 30 million in the spring of 1932.   it was also at
 this time that the party leadership inaugurated a new
 policy of conciliating China's much-maligned intellectual
 --lass, especially scientists and .technicians, in an effort
 to speed"un development of an indigenous Chinese scientific
 and technological capability.

 These further retreats wera reflected in a series
 of interviews granted Western 'visitors by Chinese Coin-
 munist leaders in the fall of 1961,.   Of particular inter-
 est was a lengthy inter view granted to Viscount 1,2ongomery
 by Mao Tse-tung in which the Chinese leader admitted
 that economic decentralization in the period 1953-1960
 had produced waste and ine:Z iciency ("due to inexperience
 and bad organization on the lower echelons") and cited
 the conclusion of a government survey that,  instead of
 the normal population increase each year of fifteen mil-
 lion,                         an annual increase of ten million was "as much as
 could be safely handled" in Communist China.   Although
 somewhat vague on the specific means for ' effecting this
 50 percent reduction in annual population growth,  Mao
 revealed in this interview a new awareness of the critical
 nature of China's population problei;i and at the same time
 foreshadowed the extensive birth control campaign which
 would be initiated in 1963.
 It was at just this-:: time that Khrushchev, perhaps
 believing that three years of agricultural calamities
 had sapped Peiping's will to resist, decided to launch
 a new offensive against the Chinese Comniunists at the
 22nd CPSU Congress.  Although the campaign was ostensibly
 directed at tiny .Albania,  it soon became apparent that
 the real object-was ldao Tse-tung, the only significant:
 challenger to khrushchev's leadership of the interna-
 tional Communist movement.  The Soviet campaign against
 the Chinese leadership reached peak intensity in January
 1962, when, following a year of sustained economic pres-
 sures, the Soviet leadership threatened in quick succes-
 sion a "complete organizational break" with the Chinese
 party and renunciation oy the Sino-Soviet military alli-
 ance.   However,  instead of carrying out these ultimate
 threats, the Soviet party then decided to send a concilia-
 tory letter to the Chinese party on 22 February 1962.
 In an apparently related' development, there emerged
 at this time signs of controversy among the Chinese Com-
 munist leadership, and it seems fairly clear that one pur-
 pose of the Soviet inter-party letter dispatched on 22
 February was to furnish leverage--on the eve of both the,
 Chinese National  People's Congress and the conclusion
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/02/22 : CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010019-6
 25X1
 of Sino-Soviet trade talks--for mode:: ate elements in the
 CCP  to use to b:. -in- about changes in domestic and fore ign
 policy, especially a change in Chinese policy toward the
 Soviet Union.   It is also fairly certain that the Chinese
 decision in early 11:a:i?ch to postpone its congress session
 for three weeks was for the purpose of holding a high-
 level party meeting to consider this Soviet proposal and,
 of equal importance, to resolve the continuing controversy
 over domestic policy.
 The outcome of this high--level party conclave was
 a signal victory for moderation in domestic policy.   For
 the first time,  the Chinese Communist leadership felt
 constrained  to  admit that it had committed  "errors" (in-
 deed,  "grave errors") in its "great; leap forward" Program.
 This admission was first made indirectly in a curious 29
 March People's Daily editorial summarizing four years of
 water conservancy construction on the U,umchi River, an
 editorial clea.'ly intended as an  allegorical discussion
 of Communist China's "leap forwa::?d" e::perier_ce in social-
 ist construction.  The first- e.:pl is i t admission that the
 Chinese Communist regime had committed "mistatces" in its
 economic development program appeared shortly thereafter
 in the communiques issued by the Nat-ion al People's Congress
 and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 25X1
 (held concurrently).

 In contrast with this strategic retreat in domestic
 policy, the Chinese Communist response to the Soviet
 letter of 22 February was avowedly tactical and temporiz-
 ing in nature.   While continuing to berate the Soviet
 Union and Khrushchev                                    the Peiping  25X1
 regime called a halt ? o polemics and even made a number
 of conciliatory gestures ?n public toward the Soviet Union
 in the spring and summer of 1962.
 the deal reason was concern for
 national security at a time when hostile powers appeared
 to threaten Communist China on all sides.                  25X1
 This concern also helps to explain the ensuing "crisis
 of nerves" which afflicted the Chinese Communist leader-
 ship in early summer 1962.   Added to the threat of serious
 popular disturbances at a. time when the reliability of
 its armed forces was in doubt, there was (in Peiping's
 view) the even graver threat of an Airerican-supported
 Chinese Nationalist invasion at a time when it was not   25X1
 possible to count on Soviet military assistance.   Sug-
 gesting that the Peiping regime felt its very existence
 to be threatened,
 there occurred in quick
 succession a resurgence of Indian military activity along
 the Tibetan frontier,  a mass exodus of tens of thousands
 of Chinese refugees into both the USSR and Hong Kong, and
 an outbreak of rioting in several areas  (the best known
 instance occurring in Canton on .1 June) ,  it appeared that
 this combination of dangers posed perhaps the most serious
 foreign and domestic crisis which the Chinese Communist
 leadership had yet faced.

 It was a't this juncture in lato June that the
 United S?tr:'tos grave Gassurance , to Peiping through its
 yepre~;cnt alive  in Vi  saw that it would. not support
 Chinese Nationalist invasion of the I,Iainland "at this
 t ime. "  With in China there  wore evident the first signs
 of an iIiprovoMent  in economic  and social conditions.
 The mot,.. of Communist China's top leadership appeared
 suddenly to change.      Within a fortnight they assembled
 in high-level conclave to adopt a new "hard" line in
 domestic and foreign policy which has persisted to the
 present day.
 The Controlled Leap:     The "Great Stride Forward"
 The Tenth Plenum of the CCP Eighth Central Committee
 convened in Peiping in late Septe:m'ae~ 1962 to approve a
 series of decisions which have shaped the course of Chinese
 Communist policy development over since.   in ret_ ospect
 it has become increasingly clear that ',he three basic
 policy decisions approved by the Tenth Plenum--to launch
 an offensive against the  "mode= n revisionist,,  leadership
 of the Soviet U: ion; to organize a nation-wide "class
 struggle" campaign; and to initiate a new, independent
 program of economic dove lo-omont--were closely interrelated
 and interdependent.   ioreover, there is considerable
 evidence that the common strategy underlying these deci-
 sions was provided by Mao Tse-tung, who once again emerged
 after a period of relatively little public activity to
 dominate the proceedings of the Tenth Plenum and to assume
 a much more active role in public -l ife
 It. is still difficult to 'Lind an adequate explanation
 for Communist China's decision in the fall of 1962,  at
 a time of both political isolation and economic weakness,
 to launch an all-out struggle against the Soviet Union
 for leadership of the international Communist movement.
 That such . decision was ?ta?:en at this time, however,  is
 well documented                                                        25X1
 The Peiping r e;;_me apparently decided that further
 retreat and accommodation in the face of Soviet pressures
 was both unnecessary and, given the nature of Soviet pro-
 vocation,  intolerable.  Militarily, the threat of an

 /Itnerican-upportecl Chinese Nationalist invasion of the main-
 land had passed and with it the ncoci to conciliate Moscow
 in the hope of having available the Soviot nuclear shield.
 Economically, Communist China appeared to be emerging
 from the worst por:iod of crisis  and,  besides,  Soviet
 economic assistance during this critical period had been
 minimal.   Tactically, the Chinese leadership may have
 concluded that it would be better to seize the initiative
 rather than await passively a new Soviet onslaught.
 By the Nall of 1952, three years of privation and
 ignominious retreat from the original goals of the "great
 leap forward" and commune programs l'ad bred wide-spread
 apathy, disillusionment and dissatisfaction among all
 classes of Chinese society.  Even more alarming, a large
 proportion of the party rank-and-file had begun to dis-
 play the same symptoms of cynicism toward party programs.
 Since these developments had gravely damaged the Chinese
 Communist mystique of being an infallible force capable
 of building China into a powerful nation on the basis of
 Marxism-Leninism,  it was imperative that a new rationale
 be advanced to explain past failures and silence future
 criticism.   The new rationale,  as revealed by Chairman
 Mao to the Tenth Plenum, was to explain failures and
 criticism of party policies as largely the handiwork of
 "foreign and domestic class enemies" against whom it was
 now necessary to launch a nation-wide "class struggle"
 campaign.
 Although the "class struggle" campaign would not be
 initiated until the following year, there were already.
 a number of indications in the fall of 1962 that it would
 be protracted and comprehensive, encompassing all classes
 and groups within Chinese society.   As spelled out in a
 December Red Flag article, all elements of the population
 were server; notice that 41
 they were liable to attack and
 punishment, should they persist in any one of a number
 of "anti-socialist." activities as defined by the regime.
 By far the most important of these activities was
 the "spontaneous tendency to capitalism' ,..which had de-
 veloped to an alarming degree in China's countryside
 during the two-year period preceding the Tenth Plenum.

 V/ith national Survival  a;,  st        the  regime throughout
 this Period had been forced to mat  numerous concessions
 to the peasantry  in  the interests of       incr e as  nu  produc-

 private reclamation of wastola nd, private household pro-
 duction                    and private  rading on the  "free mar':et")  at the
 expense of the collective economy.   in addition to these
 well-publicized concessions) the regime had also been
 forced
 to Permit, the withdrawal of large numbers of peas-
 ants from the commune-collective system, the proportion
 reaching 20 percent in at least the one province of Anhwei.
 By a 'rough approximation it may be estimated that at the
 time of maximum retreat perhaps as much as 25 percent of
 agricultural production and rural trade was being carried
 on  outsidei:the  "socialist" system.   Thum;,  in the words
 of the com.-aunicue, the Chinese revolution had reached a
 decisive tur nin g-point in the  "struggle betwoen the soci-
 alist- road and t_r{e capitalist road."  As seen by the party
 leader ship, the struggle for control over China's rural
 economy was a life-and-death struggle in which victory
 was essential to preserving the raison d'?atre of the Chi-
 nese Communist revolution.
 The third basic policy decision. approved by the
 Tenth Plenum was a new  "gene  al  policy"  Of deVelo  in;ln- the

 ing an essentially expedient policy as a new i?ar rc i s t-
 Leninist law, the Chinese Communists were apparently at-
 tempting once again to convey a sense of purpose and direc-
 tion in economic policy which would generate confidence
 and enthusiasm for a new production upsurge on the part
 of the Chinese people.

 The first half of 1063 was to be an important test-
 ing period for the basic economic policy decisions of the
 Tenth Plenum (1) to re-establish socialist, collective
 controls over the economy (especially the rural economy);
 (2) to generate a new upsurge in production (especially
 agricultural production) ;  and (3) to draft a Third Five
 Year Plan which would be both dynamic (demonstrating Com-
 munist China's ability to achieve substantial progress
 on its own) and feasible  (avoiding the excesses and mis-
 takes of the "great leap forward" era). The compulsion
 to show a rapid,  if somewhat more realistic, rate of pro-
 gress would be well exemplified by the important East
 China regional party leader Teo Ching-ship in February
 1963 when he would exhort the Chinese people to achieve
 a "great stride forward" in socialist- production and con-
 struction.  By mid-1963, however,  it would become clear
 that this undertaking to force the pace had encountered
 serious obstacles both in the short run (a disappointing
 summer harvest) and in the long run (the failure of the
 State Planning Commission to come up with a viable Third
 Five Year Plan).
 The crisis of confidence experienced by Communist
 China's leaders in the spring of 1962 had expanded by
 the end of the year to encompass most of the Chinese peo-
 ple.   Confronted with wide-spread public and party apathy,
 the Peiping regime  initiated a long--term, intensive "so-
 cialisst education" campaign at the Tenth Plenum designed
 to restore popular confidence in party leadership and .' '
 faith in the efficacy of pa_ ty programs.  This was all
 the more essential since Communist China's hopes for
 rapid economic development in 1963 rested primarily on
 its ability once again to substitute political and ideo-
 logicalincentives for material reward as the major stimulus
 in production.
 The first step in the lengthy re-education process
 was  to reassert the  "greatness"  and  "correctness"  of  the
 Chinese Communist leadership, especially as personified
 by the "great contemporary Marxist-Leninist" Mao Tse-tung,
 who once again was depicted as a semi-divine being whose
 attributes included infallibility and scientific fore-
 sight. ' The next step in reviving popular confidence was

 a concur"?tecl of.?ort initiated at the Tenth Plenum to demon
 strate that the party's economic policies had already pro-
 duced  a  "now situation of Victory""  and,  "after efforts
 for a period of tine," would us' '.e:? in "a now period of

 cular interest to note that as this can-oz--n gained momentum
 in tho winter of 1932-1963 it be an to display, at least
 in agriculture, some of the characteristics of a modified
 "leap forward" campaign.
 The mood of buoyant optimism and the image of rapid
 progress which Peiping wished to convey both domas 6 i tally
 and abroad in e a, ly 1933 reached their peak on May Day.
 By the end of the month,  however,  references to an iruninent
 upsurge in the national economy had dropped out of sight
 and by August 1933 the line had reverted to the less ' extreme
 optimism of the Tenth Plenum--that "a certain period of
 time" was required before Communist China would enter a
 anew period  of  great upsurge" in economic development.
 The Tenth Plenum decision to re-establish socialist,
 collective controls over the rural economy -v as 'apparently
 based on the assumption th t agr icuitur al production had
 recovered to the point where it was possible once again
 to squeeze out the resources needed for economic growth.

 This effort to deprive t he,;m of hard-won gains,  1t was
 necessary to  generate  new  ideological  and political  pres-
 sures to overcome this resistance.   This motivation, per
 haps, more than any other, explains the genesis of the
 nation-;--wide "class struggle  campaign (a :d the allied
 "socialist education" and "five anti's" campaigns) initiated
 in the fall of 1962 and developed with increasing inten-
 sity up "Co the present time.
 It remains to note briefly the role of Lei Fong  "the
 ,
 extraordinary ordinary soldier'" in Cor'nist China's "so-

 major objective of this campaign to study and emulate the
 "revolutionary spirit"  and  "he:: oic self-sacrifice"          of Lei
 Feng was to provide an ideological and moral substitute

 entire  "socialist  education"  campaign  under way since the
 Tenth Plenum, should be viewed as a reaffirmation and re-
 e.npression of a basic and long-hold tenet of Mao Tse-tung--
 that political indoctr:ina"'.on, rather than material in-
 centive,  is the key to rapid development of Communist
 China's backward economy.
 Although tha decision at the Tenth Plenum to precipitate
 open political warfare with the Soviet Union undoubtedly
 appealed to many Chinese (on nationalistic if not racial
 grounds), there were indications in the spring of 1963
 that many others were uneasy about the, break with Moscow
 and its long-term effect on Communist China's aspirations
 to become a great world power.   It is now known that iChru.;-
 shchev, hoping perhaps to capitalize on these feelings
 of doubt and apprehension, made a bid for a truce by dis-
 patching several conciliatory letters to the CCP in the
 fall and winter of 1962-1963, including renewed offers
 of economic and technological assistance in exchange for
 a cessation of Chinese polemical attacks.   As is also
 well known, the Chinese Communist response was to advance
 its 14 June "Proposals for a General Line for the Inter-
 national Communist biove rents? which  in effect called upon
 Communists everywhere to switch. their allegiance from
 Moscow to Peiping.   It was ironic that Communist China
 should proclaim its right to lead the international Com-
 munist movement at just the point in time when failure
 to come up with a viable Third Year Plan had demonstrated
 its inability to chart an independent course of economic
 development.
 A new phase in Chinese Communist domes tic policy
 was initiated in late spring 1963,   hen Mao issued the
 -dictum:   "Class struggle, production struggle, and
 scientific experiment are three great revolutionary move-
 ments in building up a?powerful socialist country."   Of
 these "three great- revolutionary movements," the most
 important was "class struggle" conceived as the motivat-
 ing force "to drive the struggle for production and scien-
 tific experiment forward."  With this reassertion of the
 primacy of political and ideological work (the concept
 of "politics takes command"), the Chinese Communist, lead-
 orship revealed an important truth about this allegedly

 It was no longer possible in 1968, however, to sus-
 tain the image of leaping progress which Liu had expressed
 in 1958 in the slogan:   "hard work for a few years, I..ap-
 piness for a thousand.,'
 now prorr,.~.':am for China's socialist consLruction--that this
 progra':1 resembled in impo~tan;  r.:speCt:i  the  original  "gon-

 had announced in P,iay 1958 on the eve of the "great leap

 The Peiping re ime apparently decided by mid-1963
 that. stronger measures were required to secure compliance
 with its policies.   One of these was intensification ?of
 "class ; ';;rU~rule" against  "class  enemies" who were  "try--

 tone of pronouncements earlier in the year, the tone of
 policy statements at the National Day celebrations on 1
 October and tho National People's Congress session in
 Into Novembers was sober (if not somber)  and clearly do-
 fc:nsive in justifying China's policy of "national self-
 reliance ."   As :'urther evidence of uncertainty, an
 article in the 25 January 1964 people's Daily contained
 the explicit admission that Communist China was search-
 ing for new solutions to "several new problems without
 ready-made answers which have arisen in our socialist
 construct ion. 11
 F. crucial question in assessing the future course
 of domestic policy in Communist China is the ex tent to
 which Mao Tse-tung and his lieutenants have learned the
 lessons of failure of their "leap forv,urd" approach to
 economic development.  Lased on the -findings of this
 paper,  the  answer to this question must be  an equivocal
 "both yes and no."  On the one hand, there is an increas-
 ing body of evidence that Mao Tee-tung and the dominant
 leaders of the CCP still cling to the basic theories un-
 derlying the "leap forward" strategy of economic develop-
 ment.                       On the other hand, there is abundant evidence
 that the Chinese Communist leadership, well aware of
 serious errors in past efforts to translate these theories
 into practice,  is attempting to apply them now with more
 realism and practicality.  As a result of the conflict
 between these persistent theories of "leap forward" de-
 velopment and these memories of recent failure, there
 has been an ambivalent, almost schizoid quality about
 recent Chinese Communist pronouncements in the field of
 economic policy.
 Recent indications that the Peiping regime is engaged
 in a fairly protracted gearing-up process, preparatory
 to launching a new "leap forward"-like advance in 1966,
 help   to explain this ambivalence in current Chinese
 Communist policy discussion.   While intensifying political
 activity and strengthening its political control struc-
 ture, the Peiping regime, mindful of its "great leap for-
 ward'; failures,  at the same time is advocating caution
 and restraint and appears reluctant to make any radical
 changes in its present ad hoc pattern of economic and

 social con cols until solutions are :found to 'the many
 new problems" which have orison in China's socialist
 construct ion.
 Whatever these so'! utions may turn out . to be,  there
 is good reason to believe that they will be shaped pri-
 marily by political and ideolo2 ical factors : athcr than
 by considerations  of  economic :ratio nality.    Thus  jud'n      `'

 is  based  in par  on the  fact that during the course of
 the past 18 months  the Peipinregirne has not only not
 adopted the policies which appear best suited for Com-
 munist China's economic development but rns appeared in-
 creasingly to oppose them.
 As  this paper has attempted to demonstra;,e,  the
 character, Conceptions and patterns of thought of Mao
 Tse"`tun  also support  this  view concerning Communist
 China's future development policy.   Although the record
 shows  that Mao can be flexible when danger threatens,  i i
 shows  even  more  clearly a proc  tiv'+ty for sirlplified poli-
 tical and organizational solutions (the most recent being
 thee  es tabl ishmenL,       all departments of  the national
 economy of   a political  co missar system anode led after
 the People's Liberation A-_-my) to complex problems of
 economic development.
 Another basic source of t .e pars i stent strain of
 irrationality in Chinese Communist development policy is
 the fundamental contradiction between Peiping's grandiose
 ambition to rapidly become a great world power and the
 paucity of means at its disposal .   It is this funclam ntal:..
 incompatibility between ends and means which seems to
 compel the Chinese Communist leadensh: p to experiment with
 radical innovations in a continuing search for a short
 cut to indus t rial iz a:, ion and gr_ eat ~., power s%'-,at-us.   Although
 Mao Tse-,ung and the dominant leaders of the Chinese Com-
 munist party have undoubtedly learned some lessons from
 the  excesses and raor e  flag:: an;; mistakes  com_ ltted during
 the "great leap for:ziar d" era, 'hey do not appear to have
 learned the most important lesson o  all--that the "leap

 :forward" strategy itself is incapable of solving Com
 munist China's staggering problems of economic develop-
 ment.
 For all of these reasons--Peipi.ng's course in the
 past 1E months, Mao's abiding characteristics, and the
 basic incompatibility of ends and means--we think that
 it can be predicted with some assurance, at least while
 Mao continues as China's leader, that there Ol1 be yet
 another attempt to incite an "all-out advance" in
 economic development in the future, possibly as soon as'
 1966.

 in May 1958 on the eve of the "great leap powward."  The
 resembla-nee be tv/ en these two prog_?airs, separated by five
 years in time and by the '.:arrowing experience of economic
 disast,e_?, is so striking t::at it deserves further discus-
 sion.
 First, and foremost,  it baca:::e increasingly clear
 in the fall of 1953 ;;flat the "socialist education" and
 "five anti's" ::ova:, ne  :s (which toga the ' comprise the "class
 st: u gle " camp ai n)  were modeled closely after the "rec ti-
 f ication" and "^n t i-:.?igh-`,ist" .: o events of 1957-1953.
 Just,  :.s "sect if i  a t ion"  hhad sought**  to  in c i -a  a production
 upsurge "by -raising the socialist; corscio::s :ass of the
 workers and  aro+Using         a n'Whus:i.asi of  the  zm;:::,ses," the
 object ives of   "socialises   aduca ;ion" in 1963  ''a:: a  '"to  stimu-

 their zeal for production" and "to mobilize all the forces
 that can be mobilized and organize all the people who can
 be organized into the s ;_ ug;le for product-on."                As was
 ;,rue in the earlier period, it v.'as again held that the
 key to success in this mobilization offort lay in rectify-
 ing defects  in cadre  "work style,"  primarily cozrecting
 the dofect of "bureaucrat, ism" of China's rural cadres by
 having them "participate in collective, productive labor."
 As expounded in a %ey =0 Jc;ly Red Flag editorial,
 rural cadre par,icipa;,ior in collective, Te-ductive labor

 poasants, fostering industry                                       and  thrift,  and
 "st, i mul a - in  the labor enthusiasm of the masses."                       Of
 par's cu'iar interest was the claim that this method of
 overcorlin                       (in both rural and urban areas)
 would enable Communist China "to greatly increase the
 a mount  and  greatly accelerate the tempo of socialist
 capital accumulation," a requirement all the more urgent
 ,,as the editorial pointed out) now that Peiping could no
 longer look to "foreign countries for loans."  As Liu
 Shao-chi in 19 8 had called for the mobilization of China's
 peasants "to create limitless wealth and thus accumulate
 large amounts of f u :ds for national industrial construc-
 tion," so did Red :lag  n raid-1963 exhort "all of our
 cadres to be to y a ware of this way to increase accumula-
 -ion of socialist capi;,al by overcoming bureaucracy."
 Fina L-.y, cadre participation in collective, pro-
 ductive labor was essential for carrying out, the last oX
 the  "three great revolutionary movements,"  for  "launching
 a revolutionary movement of scientific experiments  in
 a planned way throughout the country."   In rural areas,
 this meant (according to an important September Red Flag
 article) "cultivating experimental plots" together with
 veteran peasants and scientific and technical personnel
 and thus "finding out the objective laws governing the
 struggle for agricultural production."   Again there was
 a clear precedent for this in Liu Shao-chi's 1955 report
 which had directed that "all party cadres must put them-
 selves to work on 'experimental plots"' in order to
 secure "necessary knowledge in science and technology to
 guide the work properly"--in other words, to become both
 "Red" and "expert."
 One difference (an important one) was that it was
 no longer possible in 1963 to sustain the image of leaping
 progress which Liu had expressed in 1958 in the slogan:

 Even more intriguing were the indications at this
 tine that opposition to this new mobilization effort
 ex-tended into the leadership as well.   Appearing in the
 10 July Red Flag editorial noted above and in a follow-
 up 25 Ju.y peop? e's Daily editorial, the charges leveled
 against- these lea~.c=s (identified only as  "some  comrades
 in load in- positions") were that they failed to realize
 that "cor= ect knowledge.. ..only comes from the three prac-
 tices of  class                  production struggle  and scienti-
 fic e}:par:I ent" and, more ominously, that "their world
 outlook.. . is still bourgeois or still has the remnants
 of bourgeois ideology."    In this latter characteriza-
 t i,c n, there was a strong suggestion that the dominant
 Chinese leaders ware once again contending with a body
 of opinion among the leadership counseling more moderate
 and pragmatic domestic policies.**
 T 1,c is a rezsonaole inference that these were the same
 "some comrades" who would be criticized in a September
 Red Flag article for fearing that "class struggle would
 affect production."
 ,**Since the identity of the "some comrades" mentioned
 here is admittedly vague, it is legitimate to question
 whether this opposition may not have arisen at the pro-
 vincial or even county levels of leadership rather than
 at the party center.   Although not conclusive, previous
 studies have shown a fairly consistent pattern in Chinese
 Communist usage of the term "some comrades"  in discussing
 opposition to party policies, a pattern indicating not
 only  '',hat  these "sore comrades" actually opposed policy
 measures but also that  these "some comrades" in most in-
 stances were situated at a fairly high level within the
