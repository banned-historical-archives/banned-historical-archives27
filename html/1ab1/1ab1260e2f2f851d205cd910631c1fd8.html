 VIETNAM
 Attacks on Marine units near the Demilitarized Zone,
 and rocket attacks on US and South Vietnamese Army
 positions north of Saigon interrupted the general
 lull in military activity in South Vietnam this week.
 In Saigon, the ground rules for the presidential cam-
 paign have been laid out.   Hanoi has been forced to
 seek administrative and technical manpower among its
 heretofore distrusted middle class.
 NEW COMMUNIST MILITARY PRESSURE IN LAOS
 The most serious attacks have occurred in southern
 Laos against government bases supporting increased
 intelligence and harassment operations into the vital
 infiltration corridor.
 PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC POLICY CHANGES IN BURMA
 Popular enthusiasm over the government's stand against
 Peking, even though subsiding somewhat, gives No Win
 a face-saving opportunity to make additional changes
 in the regime's doctrinaire and generally unsuccess-
 ful socialist economic policies.
 SINO-CAMBODIAN RELATIONS UNDER STRAIN
 Relations between China and Cambodia appear to be go-
 ing through a particularly difficult period, although
 both countries are probably anxious to avoid an open
 dispute.
 PEKING IN CONFLICT WITH REGIONAL COMMANDERS
 Maoist leaders are engaged in a major effort to bring
 recalcitrant military commanders into line.   The con-
 flict is far from resolved, and violent incidents con-
 tinue to erupt throughout the country.

 SOVIET MARSHAL STRESSES ROLE OF CONVENTIONAL GROUND FORCES
 A Red Star article, probably politically inspired, by
 the new Warsaw Pact chief, Marshal Yakubovsky, is the
 most explicit Soviet statement to date on the import-
 ance of ground forces in the USSR's defense planning.
 SOVIETS AGAIN PROMOTING WORLD COMMUNIST PARTY CONFERENCE
 They want to keep the idea alive but realize that such
 a meeting cannot be arranged anytime soon.
 POLITICAL TROUBLES IN POLISH MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
 There are signs that opposition to the regime's pro-
 Arab policies reached upper military echelons and led
 to the dismissal of at least three high-level officers.

 THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION
 Arab states are holding a foreign ministers' confer-

 from their humiliating defeat by Israel.   They--espe-

 stage for a summit conference.   In Israeli-annexed
 Jerusalem, Arab discontent is running high and an
 explosive situation is developing.   Soviet military
 aid to the Arabs is slowing down, and Soviet naval
 activity offshore continues.   Meanwhile, Britain is
 planning to sound out UN members about a Security
 Council resolution aimed at reopening the Suez Canal.

 FAR EAST
 Maoist leaders are engaged in a major effort
 to bring China's recalcitrant military commanders
 into line.   A Red Flag editorial admitted that
 the Wuhan commander's open defiance of Peking
 last week was "by no means an isolated phenom-
 enon."  Although attacks on the Wuhan leader
 are continuing, there are indications that the
 Maoists have been obliged to make concessions.
 Their failure to deal cleanly with the Wuhan
 authorities may reflect pressure from other
 key military leaders.   In an apparent effort
 to prevent further open defiance, Maoist lead-
 ers have been conferring with regional mili-
 tary officials in Peking.
 The South Vietnamese presidential campaign
 opened officially on 3 August amidst signs of
 friction between the supporters of Thieu and
 Ky.   Partisans in each camp have accused the
 other of undermining their joint campaign com-
 mittee.   The long-standing rivalry between the
 two men has been exacerbated by Thieu's sus-
 picion that Ky is trying to project himself as
 the real leader of the ticket.   These frictions,
 however, have not reached the point of jeopardiz-
 ing the ticket's prospects for victory on 3 Sep-
 tember.
 Communist forces in Laos are increasing
 pressure against government positions.   The most
 serious attacks have occurred in southern Laos
 against government bases supporting recently
 stepped-up intelligence and harassment opera-
 tions into the vital panhandle infiltration
 corridor.   This upsurge in Communist activity
 probably is also aimed at offsetting gains by
 government forces in the last six months.                   25X1

 VIETNAM
 Military activity continues
 at a slack pace in most of South
 Vietnam, although several sig-
 nificant engagements occurred
 during the past week.
 US Marines of Operation KING-
 FISHER suffered more than 200
 casualties when attacked several
 miles north of Con Thien while
 returning from a sweep into the
 southern half of the Demilitarized
 Zone  (DMZ).   This sweep had been
 the first major allied penetra-
 tion of the DMZ since last May,
 and its purpose was to locate
 and destroy enemy artillery, mor-
 tar, and rocket positions which
 have shelled allied field posi-
 tions in northern Quang Tri Prov-
 ince almost continuously.
 Page 2
 Throughout South Vietnam's
 III Corps, the activities of enemy
 forces reflected implementation
 of their rainy season offensive
 plans.   These plans include selec-
 lated areas, interdiction of vital
 supply routes, and attacks on
 friendly outposts and base areas
 all of which showed an increase
 last week.  Well-planned mortar
 and 122-mm. rocket attacks were
 directed at three US and South
 Vietnamese Army positions north
 and east of Saigon last weekend.
 The attacking force probably con-
 sisted of subordinate units of th
 Viet Cong 9th Light Infantry Di-
 vision, elements of which have
 previously participated in simi-
 lar rocket attacks in the same
 general area.
 To the south, the Communists
 are   suffering  heavy casualties
 as the result of allied operation
 in the Mekong Delta.   More than
 225 enemy soldiers were killed
 during a series of battles early
 this week near My Tho, in south-
 ern Dinh Tuong Province.

 Vietnamese troops in a combined

 operation nicknamed CORONADO II,
 are scouring the area along Na-
 tional Route 4 in search of sev-
 eral Viet Cong main force bat-
 talions--one of which, the 263rd,
 was identified in the combat this
 week.   These enemy units have re-
 cently intensified their harass-
 ment of traffic on Route 4, the
 vital ground link between the
 delta and Saigon.   During a ten-
 day period in late July, there
 were over 52 Viet Cong mining
 incidents and ambushes along a
 25-mile segment of this road.
 This recently intensified enemy
 activity in the eastern portion
 of Dinh Tuong Province may be
 a diversionary action to cover
 the movement of supplies and re-
 inforcing personnel into a large
 Viet Cong base area suspected to
 be in the western part of the
 province.
 Saigon Elections
 The presidential campaign of-
 ficially began on 3 August and
 will continue, under the super-
 vision of the newly formed Cen-
 tral Election Campaign Committee,
 until the day before the election
 on 3 September.   The committee,
 composed of two representatives
 of each ticket, outlined the ma-
 jor features of the campaign in
 late July.   These include arrange-
 ments for 24 joint public appear-
 ances by the candidates through-
 out the country and in Saigon be-
 tween 6 August and 1 September.
 There will also be two joint press
 conferences and three television
 appearances, during which each
 Page  4
 candidate may speak for five
 minutes.   A 15-minute radio talk
 during the first week of the cam-
 paign is also scheduled for each
 candidate.
 This schedule is not com-
 pulsory and the candidates are
 free, to a certain extent, to
 make their own arrangements.
 They may, for instance, hold in-
 dependent press conferences in
 private homes and restaurants,
 but not in public buildings or
 government offices.   They are
 also free to talk to individual
 journalists at any time.
 Little is known of the spe-
 cific campaign plans of the two
 major civilian candidates--Tran
 Van Huong and Phan Khac Suu--
 but both probably have the trap-
 pings of a campaign organization
 down to province level at least
 in the delta and around Saigon.
 According to press reports, both
 intend to do most of their per-
 sonal campaigning from Saigon
 and will send representatives
 on the government-arranged cam-
 paign tour.
 As for Chief of State Thieu
 and Premier Ky, there are grow-
 ing indications of friction and
 poor working relations within
 their campaign organization, al-
 though both appear to be gaining
 support as individuals, if not a
 a team.

 Although the joint campaign
 group may not be working well
 as a team,  supporters of either
 Thieu and Ky individually appear
 to be having some success in lin-
 ing up support for their own
 man--a development which may
 serve to improve the joint
 ticket's chances for victory.
 Hanoi Soliciting "Bourgeoisie"
 Hanoi has found it necessary
 to call upon the country's mis-
 Page   5
 trusted middle class for adminis-
 trative and technical manpower,
 according to a 9 July radiobroad-
 cast.   The North Vietnamese Govern-
 ment recently revised its employ-
 ment policy for "bourgeois" in-
 dividuals in an effort to assure
 them jobs commensurate with their
 capacities and training, and to
 guarantee them pay scales and
 other incentives comparable to
 those received by "workers" in
 state enterprises.   In the past
 Hanoi has discriminated against
 individuals who had worked in
 managerial and technically skilled
 positions under the French, pre-
 ferring to employ less experienced
 but more politically reliable
 young Communists trained in the
 more advanced bloc countries.
 Although there are few indi-
 cations that the war has imposed
 any general manpower shortage on
 Hanoi, the new incentives offered
 the "bourgeois" suggest that there
 is a shortage of certain skilled
 workers in critical areas.   This
 suggestion is reinforced by Hanoi's
 decision to step up its foreign
 training program.   Beginning in
 1967, the USSR and East European
 countries have
 agreements with
 than triple the

 NEW COMMUNIST MILITARY PRESSURE IN LAOS
 The Communists are increasing
 pressure against widely separated
 Laotian Government positions. The
 most serious attacks have occurred
 in southern Laos against govern-
 ment bases supporting increased
 intelligence and harassment opera-

 corridor.

 PROSPECTS FOR ECONOMIC POLICY CHANGES IN BURMA
 Further modifications of the
 "Burmese Way to Socialism" could
 occur despite the ruling Revolu-
 tionary Council's recent reaffir-
 mation of basic economic policies
 following an intensive review of
 the economy.
 The Burmese Government has
 been retreating, albeit cautiously
 and quietly, over the past several
 months from its drive toward state
 socialism.   A number of commodi-
 ties were restored to private
 wholesale and retail trade last
 September and several others have
 been decontrolled since then.
 The most significant step
 was taken on 23 June, when the
 government partially decontrolled
 the rice trade.   The failure of
 the state monopoly in rice trade
 to procure adequate supplies had
 resulted in an acute internal rice
 shortage and a further decline
 in rice exports, which account
 for an estimated 70 percent of
 Burma's foreign exchange earnings.
 The government may go even further
 if, as expected, the 23 June de-
 cision encourages farmers to
 market the stocks they have ac-
 cumulated because of the govern-
 ment's unrealistically low price.
 Burma's strained relations
 with Peking following the anti-
 Chinese disorders in Rangoon in
 late June have not only provided
 the Burmese Government with a
 face-saving opportunity to effect
 further economic changes but have
 brought the nation's economic
 plight into sharper focus.   The
 opportunity derives principally
 from a wave of unprecedented
 popular approbation ensuing from
 Peking's diatribes against the
 "fascist" Ne Win regime, although
 time may be running out since
 much of the enthusiasm generated
 in the early stages of the dis-
 pute probably is now waning.
 For its part, Peking is
 showing no disposition to relax
 its propaganda offensive.   The
 Chinese have recently increased
 their broadcasts to Burma and now
 are emphasizing Burma's economic
 difficulties.   These broadcasts
 could aggravate an already serious
 dissidence problem among Communist
 and tribal minority groups, es-
 pecially if Burma's downward
 economic spiral is not reversed.

 SINO-CAMBODIAN RELATIONS UNDER STRAIN
 Relations between Cambodia
 and Communist China appear to be
 going through a particularly dif-
 ficult period, although both
 25X1  countries are probably anxious
 to avoid an open dispute.
 The Yugoslav ambassador in
 Phnom Penh told a US official that
 anti-Chinese sentiment there is
 reaching serious proportions and
 could erupt in violent attacks
 against the Chinese community.
 He claimed that "patriotic" Cam-
 bodians are increasingly disturbed
 over Chinese domination of the
 economy and particularly the role
 the Chinese are playing in smug-
 gling to South Vietnam.   He stated
 that the situation was aggravated
 by the Chinese Communist Embassy's
 "heavy-handed" interference in
 the local Chinese school system,
 which he claims has included
 organization of Red Guard units.
 Although these statements
 may be somewhat overdrawn, there
 has been an upsurge in leftist
 activity in Cambodia in recent
 months.   Sihanouk has reacted
 by declaring that "Red Guard -
 type" activity will not be per-
 mitted in Cambodia, and by dis-
 couraging, apparently with some
 success, the display of Maoist
 badges and literature.
 At the same time, Sihanouk
 has made it clear he does not
 want the crackdown on the Cam-
 bodian left to result in a breach
 with Communist China.   He has
 taken pains in his public remarks
 to absolve Peking of responsibil-
 ity for the activities of over-
 zealous leftists.   He reacted
 mildly to the sacking of the of-
 fices of an anti-Chinese news-
 paper.   He also refrained from
 public comment on the offensive
 behavior of a Chinese military
 aid group which insisted the
 Cambodian pilots could not fly
 properly because they had been
 trained by "imperialists."
 The Chinese, for their part,
 appear equally reluctant to
 worsen relations.   Their reaction
 to Sihanouk's campaign against
 the left, which has included the
 deportation of the two leading
 pro-Peking businessmen, has been
 mild.   The Peking regime's public
 response to Cambodian press crit-
 icism of its propaganda activities
 has been couched in defensive and
 generally noninflammatory lan-
 guage.   Finally, Peking has in-
 vited the Cambodian foreign min-
 ister to visit China, probably to
 try to work out some of these
 problems.

 PEKING IN CONFLICT WITH REGIONAL COMMANDERS
 Maoist leaders are engaged
 in a major effort to bring China's
 recalcitrant military commanders
 into line.     The conflict is far
 from resolved, and violent inci-
 dents continue to erupt throughout
 the country.
 Peking broadcast revealed that
 the leaders of the "million-man
 army"--an anti-Maoist organization
 responsive to Wuhan Military Re-
 gion command--would also "be
 given a chance to redeem them-
 selves."
 Growing frictions between
 Maoists and military leaders
 culminated in an open act of de-
 fiance on 20 and 21 July when
 Chen Tsai-tao, commander of the
 Wuhan Military Region, arrested
 two important officials from
 Peking.   After the two were re-
 leased on 22 July, Peking mounted
 frenetic demonstrations in the
 capital and several regional
 cities against the commander for
 several days, and announced the
 beginning of a drive to purge
 military leaders.
 On 30 July, however, a Red
 Flag editorial said that pro-Mao
 revolutionaries" should exercise
 extreme caution in dealing with
 errant military leaders, suggest-
 ing that the Maoists were giving
 ground.   The editorial asserted
 that in some localities the con-
 flict between military and "revo-
 lutionary" forces is "only a mis-
 understanding."   In such areas,
 it said, pro-Mao forces should be
 lenient.
 Peking took another step
 backward on 1 August, when a
 Maoist leaders are probably
 under strong pressure from mili-
 tary leaders to moderate their
 policies.   For the past week
 Maoist leaders have been confer-
 ring with representatives from
 regional military commands in an
 extraordinary session in Peking.
 Three regional military officials
 appeared at a Peking rally on
 25 July.   Nine of them, repre-
 senting six of the ten major com-
 mands, showed up on 31 July for
 the rally celebrating the 40th
 anniversary of the founding of
 the army.
 This is the only time in
 recent years that so many out-of-
 town military men have gathered
 in the capital at one time.   They
 normally celebrate even major
 anniversaries in their own pro-
 vincial capitals.
 The event was not attended
 by either Mao Tse-tung or Defense
 Minister Lin Piao.   The signifi-
 cance of their absence is still
 unclear.   The keynote speech,

 on a broad scale, and little ap-
 parent action has been taken to
 prevent them.
 One major goal of the mili-
 tary leaders probably is the
 restoration of order.   They may
 have pressed Mao and Lin for a
 clear mandate to the military to
 impose order and bring to an end
 those Red Guard activities which
 have produced near anarchy.   This,
 however, would mean abandoning
 the main thrust of the Cultural
 Revolution to which both men are
 committed.
 There is no evidence as yet
 that Maoists have given up on
 this issue.   On the contrary,
 violent clashes and transport
 disruptions are still occurring
 The interruption of rail
 traffic may be causing signifi-
 cant delays in the distribution
 of foods and raw materials to
 urban areas.   There is no direct
 evidence to indicate extensive
 backlogs of materials, however.
 The effect on Soviet aid
 shipments for North Vietnam is   25X1
 uncertain.   These shipments
 probably receive special atten-
 tion in transiting China.

 All but the most urgent matters will be held in
 abeyance for the next few weeks as Europe's leaders
 close up shop for their traditional August vacations.
 All three of the Soviet Union's top leaders have left
 Moscow.
 Moscow, however, remains wrapped up in the Arab-
 Israeli problem.   The Soviets are also looking at the
 turmoil in China and this week made a provocative plea
 to the Chinese Army not to let Mao exploit it.   Pravda
 took an indirect shot at Castro's Latin American "sol-

 ever, for a television appearance to promote forth-

 SOVIET MARSHAL STRESSES ROLE OF CONVENTIONAL GROUND FORCES
 A top member of the USSR's
 high command has published the
 most explicit statement to date
 on the importance of ground forces
 in Soviet defense planning.
 The author was Marshal Ivan
 Yakubovsky, recently appointed
 commander in chief of the Warsaw
 Pact forces.  Writing in the
 21 July issue of Red Star, Yaku-
 bovsky was careful to acknowledge
 the great impact of nuclear weap-
 ons but noted a wide range of
 circumstances calling for ground
 forces employing only the "class-
 ical" means of warfare. He implied
 that the USSR is making substan-
 tial efforts to improve its
 capacity to conduct nonnuclear
 operations.
 The Soviet Army and Navy
 are large and reasonably well
 equipped for conventional warfare.
 The recently developed huge AN-22
 transport aircraft and Alligator-
 class landing ships will enhance
 the mobility of Soviet forces.
 Several new aircraft displayed in
 the recent Moscow air show are
 designed to improve air support
 to ground troops.
 The form and timing of
 Yakubovsky's article suggest it
 was inspired by the desire of
 the new high command to influence
 policy matters, particularly
 defense allocations.   Preliminary
 decisions regarding the 1968 plan
 probably are being taken now.
 To underscore the political as
 well as economic implications of
 the policy he was propounding,
 Yakubovsky cited the recent cen-
 tral committee theses stressing
 the importance of strengthening
 defenses.

 SOVIETS AGAIN PROMOTING WORLD COMMUNIST PARTY CONFERENCE
 The Soviet-sponsored idea of
 a conference of the world's Com-
 munist parties is in the air again.
 A Pravda editorial on 23 July,
 echoing an earlier statement by
 the East German party, said that
 bilateral and multilateral meet-
 ings of Communist parties are
 paving the way for a new inter-
 national conference.   Subsequent
 pronouncements have put the Bul-
 garian, Hungarian, Danish, Brazil-
 ian, and Uruguayan parties on
 record as advocates of such a
 conference, though with differing
 degrees of enthusiasm.
 The obstacles to a world Com-
 munist meeting are such that the
 Soviets are unlikely to try to
 arrange it before their 50th anni-
 versary celebrations in November.
 The Pravda editorial took note of
 these obstacles, mentioning
 "nationalist moods" and "internal
 difficulties" in the Communist
 movement.
 For one thing, Moscow is
 aware that Tito's participation in
 multilateral consultations on the
 Middle East does not mean that he
 has abandoned Yugoslavia's inde-
 pendence in the Communist move-
 ment.   A Soviet diplomat in Bel-
 grade recently conceded that the
 alliance with Belgrade over the
 Arab-Israeli crisis was only tem-
 porary.
 Moreover, Moscow will have
 noted the Rumanian's silence
 about Pravda's suggestion of a
 conference.   T ey ignored the op-
 portunity for comment provided by
 their well-publicized parliamen-
 tary session last week in which
 foreign policy discussions pre-
 dominated.
 The Soviets thus seem to be
 no closer to achieving a demon-
 stration of unity on the issue
 than they were in April, when
 several parties--notably Yugo-
 slavia's and Rumania's--boycotted
 the Karlovy Vary conference of
 European Communists.   Nevertheless,
 the Soviets hope to keep the sub-
 ject alive and look upon lesser
 bilateral or multilateral meet-
 ings--such as Karlovy Vary and the
 get-togethers on the Middle East--
 as serving that purpose.
 There are tenuous indications
 that some such gathering may be in
 the offing.
 If any such meeting were held
 before November, it would be a
 limited one intended to demonstrate
 to foot-draggers the momentum and
 inevitability of the move toward
 a full-scale international con-
 ference.

 POLITICAL TROUBLES IN POLISH MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT
 There are signs that opposi-
 tion to the Polish regime's pro-
 Arab policy reached upper mili-
 tary echelons and that, for a
 while after the Mid-East war, the
 regime was in doubt about the
 political reliability of some
 segments of the armed forces'
 leadership.
 In a widely publicized speech
 on 21 July, Defense Minister Spy-
 chalski-?-a close friend of party
 boss Gomulka--implied that the
 political attitudes of the mili-
 tary failed to pass the "acute
 test" of the Mid-East war and
 that this was reflected in Polish
 military performance during the
 period of crisis.   Spychalski also
 seemed to indicate that some of-
 ficers, fearing involvement in the
 war because of Warsaw's support
 of Moscow's policy, questioned
 the value of the alliance with
 the USSR,  as well as the worth
 of Soviet weapons, equipment,
 and training.
 The defense minister's
 stress on ideological attitudes
 as basic to combat readiness
 suggests that the military es-
 tablishment will be brought
 more closely under party con-
 trol in an effort to ensure its
 reliability in any future
 crisis.
 Spychalski's address is
 virtual confirmation of reports
 that the air defense commander
 and two of his deputies have
 been purged for refusing to
 prepare and circulate within
 the air force an evaluation of
 the Arab-Israeli conflict based
 on false and tendentious regime
 propaganda positions.   Since
 none of these officers is Jewish,
 their purge was not related to
 Gomulka's anti-Semitic policy
 statement of 19 June.
 Soviet Marshal  Yakubovsky--
 on his first official trip
 since his appointment as Warsaw
 Pact commander--made a protocol
 visit to Warsaw on 24 July, pos-
 sibly reflecting uneasiness on
 the part of Soviet leaders over
 the situation in the Polish
 armed services.
 Despite rumors in Warsaw
 that a wider cleansing--involv-
 ing foreign service and foreign
 trade personnel--is being pre-
 pared, it is not likely that
 military purges will be exten-
 sive.   There are good domestic
 reasons for avoiding a sweeping
 change, mainly that it would en-
 courage factionalism and pos-
 sibly threaten the political
 balance Gomulka has constructed
 between dogmatic and relatively
 liberal elements in I the regime.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Arab foreign ministers are conferring
 this week in an attempt to establish some unity
 between the radical and moderate regimes, but
 there is little prospect for any real achievement.
 They will also try to set the stage for a later
 summit conference--a forum which the radicals es-
 pecially are seeking.  Meanwhile, increasing Arab
 discontent in Israeli-annexed Jerusalem is creat-
 ing an explosive situation there.
 Elsewhere in the Middle East, both Jordan
 and Iraq have had cabinet reshuffles and some re-
 alignment seems to be in progress in Syria.   None
 of these regimes is expected to make any major
 policy changes, however.
 The Congress Party in India suffered another
 setback on 29 July when the Mishra government fell
 in Madhya Pradesh.   It was the third Congress state
 regime to collapse since March, and Congress now
 controls only seven of the 17 states in India.
 Events are moving slowly in Africa's current,
 top trouble spots--Congo and Nigeria.   The mer-
 cenaries in northeastern Congo have left their
 Punia stronghold and are on their way to Bukavu.
 The Belgian cabinet, meanwhile, decided on 28 July
 that its presence in the Congo and the amount of
 aid granted will depend on what guarantees of
 safety the Mobutu government can provide Belgian
 citizens there.   In any event, some cutback in aid
 is inevitable.
 in Nigeria, federal troops consolidated
 their successful seaborne invasion of Biafra's
 oil terminal and now control the secessionists'
 main outlet to the sea.   Other moves against
 Biafra's southwestern area are probably under
 way, and Nsukka in the northwest has again fallen

 THE ARAB-ISRAELI SITUATION
 The Arab foreign ministers'
 conference opened in Khartoum on
 1 August with a call for unity
 among Arab regimes.
 The agenda is apparently
 still under consideration in
 closed sessions.   Proposed points
 for discussion probably include
 calling for Israeli withdrawal
 from Arab territories, continu-
 ing the oil embargo, and the
 elimination of foreign military
 bases in Arab countries.
 Ahmad Shuqayri, head of the
 Palestine Liberation organization,
 told the press that the foreign
 ministers would also discuss
 such measures as severance of
 diplomatic relations with the US
 and UK and total boycott of trade.
 Such extreme measures would prob-
 ably touch off bitter debate be-
 tween radical and moderate Arab
 states, and the outcome is un-
 certain.
 Jerusalem and the West Bank
 Arab resistance to the Is-
 raeli occupation of Jerusalem and
 Jordan's West Bank is rapidly in-
 creasing to the point where seri-
 ous incidents are likely.  Apart
 from the mere fact of alien occu-
 pation, the opposition reflects
 the Arabs' resentment of inept
 and sometimes calculated Israeli
 moves against their economic and
 religious interests.
 Israeli interference in the
 religious rights of the Arab
 Christians and Muslims, especially
 the latter, is probably the touch-
 iest issue.   The application of
 Israeli religious laws to the Old
 City and especially, the placing
 of Christian and Muslim religious
 matters under the supervision of
 the Israeli Ministry of Religious
 Affairs headed by a rabbi has been
 regarded by the Arabs as adding
 insult to injury.   On 2 August
 the Israelis, in a probably futile
 attempt to assuage Arab indigna-
 tion, placed the supervision of
 Muslim religious activities under
 Defense Minister Dayan.
 Forced closure of all business
 establishments one day a week is
 bitterly resented.   Some Israeli
 tourists have offended Muslim and
 Christian sensibilities by their
 dress and actions in holy places.
 Latin ecclesiastical authorities
 have responded by closing their
 shrines, including the Holy Sepul-
 chre, when not being used for re-
 ligious services.   Israeli-imposed
 restrictions on both Muslim and
 Christian religious courts have
 aroused religious leaders.   Cen-
 sorship of Muslim sermons, another
 sore point, has ceased.
 A number of Old City judges
 and lawyers have signed a protest
 petition and have refused to act

 on cases.    Arab doctors are
 considering refusing to partici-
 pate in the Israeli health insur-
 ance scheme.   Other professions
 have joined the doctors' and law-
 yers' protests.   Teachers in Na-
 blus have threatened to strike if
 the school texts are replaced by
 Israeli ones, and many merchants
 have closed their stores.   The
 majority of the unemployed will
 not register at the Israeli labor
 exchange.
 The Old City council has re-
 fused to participate in an Is-
 raeli-amalgamated city-wide coun-
 cil protesting that this would be
 recognition of the annexation of
 the Old City by Israel, which they
 have denounced.   Half a dozen
 anti-Israel leaflets have been
 distributed warning Arab residents
 against cooperating with the Is-
 raeli authorities.   One leaflet
 originated with the Israeli Com-
 munist Party.  A boycott of Is-
 raelis is reportedly planned by
 the Old City Chamber of Commerce
 and Muslim leaders as part of a
 general civil disobedience cam-
 paign aimed at heading off meas-
 ures designed to detach Jerusalem
 from the West Bank.
 On 30 July the Israeli cabi-
 net spent considerable time dis-
 cussing the situation in Jerusalem
 and the West Bank.   Israeli of-
 ficials have now indicated that
 the "policy of moderation" toward
 the Arab population has not worked
 and that much sterner action is
 planned for the future.  An in-
 dication of this new policy was
 the 31 July arrest and exile to
 Israeli towns of four prominent
 West Bank political leaders, in-
 cluding the former governor of
 the Jerusalem district.
 Soviet Political Activity
 Soviet efforts to find a so-
 lution to Middle East problems
 have aroused resentment and anxi-
 ety among some of the Arabs.   So-
 viet Foreign Minister Gromyko in
 turn has given vent to his own
 frustrations at the UN.   His re-
 marks have almost certainly of-
 fended the sensitive Arabs, who
 are becoming more distrustful of
 Soviet intentions.
 At home the Soviets are try-
 ing to put the best possible face
 on their actions in the Middle
 East.   Various Soviet news articles
 have discussed the possibilities
 of a future role for the Communist
 parties in the Middle East as long
 as "objective conditions pertain
 for the development of the social-
 ist trend."   A recent Pravda arti-
 cle emphasized that the release of
 political prisoners in Egypt would
 enable the "cooperation of all
 genuinely progressive forces...
 which undoubtedly has broadened
 the revolution's social base," im-

 implying that the Soviet Govern-
 ment expects a more important role
 for Egyptian Communists.   In an
 earlier article, Pravda attributed
 Egyptian military failures to the
 bourgeois nonrevolutionary officer
 corps, with the implication that
 the fault did not lie with the
 chief beneficiary of Soviet aid,
 President Nasir himself.
 Soviet Military Aid
 Three additional Soviet arms
 carriers docked at Middle East
 ports in the past week.  With
 their arrival, about 42,000 tons
 of military equipment have now
 been delivered by 18 ships since
 5 June--when hostilities began.
 It would require some 80 addi-
 tional voyages, however, to get
 Arab military arms inventories
 near prewar levels.
 The Egyptian military dele-
 gation left Moscow on 29 July.
 An agreement on Soviet equipment
 to be provided as part of the
 resupply effort was probably con-
 cluded.
 Iraq's defense minister,
 who has been in Moscow since
 21 July, is also negotiating for
 additional military equipment.
 Soviet Naval Activity
 Soviet submarine and surface
 ship deployments in the Mediter-
 ranean remain at a high level.
 Several ships at sea since early
 June probably have been replaced
 by other units including two land-
 ing ships and four submarines.
 Three SAM-equipped combatants, a
 destroyer, and three landing ships
 are probably continuing to lend
 support to Nasir by remaining in
 or near the ports of Alexandria
 and Port Said.
 United Nations
 Britain, concerned about the
 effects of a prolonged closure of
 the Suez Canal, is planning to
 consult the USSR and the Middle
 East countries on a Security Coun-
 cil resolution aimed at reopening
 it.   London has in mind a resolu-
 tion much like that agreed upon
 privately between the US and the
 USSR toward the end of the special
 General Assembly session.   This
 resolution provided for withdrawal
 of troops and an end of belliger-
 ency.   The UK, however, would
 strengthen the provisions on free-
 dom of passage.   The UK also in-
 tends to propose to Secretary Gen-
 eral Thant that he pay a personal

 FEDERAL FORCES INCREASE PRESSURES IN NIGERIAN WAR
 The Nigerian federal gov-
 ernment continues to press its
 month-old military campaign
 against the seceded former East-
 ern region, Biafra.
 Troops of the landing force
 that seized Bonny last week are
 reportedly moving cautiously
 Western
 upriver toward Port Harcourt
 accompanied by two naval patrol
 boats.   The first federal goal
 is likely to be the refinery
 near Port Harcourt.

 there appears to remain fluid.
 Biafran Governor Ojukwu
 still appears confident of ulti-
 25X1       mate victory, and there does not
 seem to be any significant decline
 25X1  in morale.
 Additional problems may
 arise for Biafra after the fed-
 eral government gets delivery of
 25X1  six jet trainers it purchased
 from Czechoslovakia. Two of these
 transited Morocco last weekend
 on their way to Lagos.
 Biafra,  on the other hand,
 has received no heavy military
 Page 24
 equipment and probably is short
 of foreign exchange needed to
 purchase such equipment.
 The federal seizure of Bonny
 has apparently caused the oil
 companies--especially Shell-BP
 and SAFRAP, which have producing
 wells in the East--to have second
 thoughts about royalty payments
 to Ojukwu.
 In a further attempt to
 influence Shell-BP, Ojukwu is
 holding the company's manager
 hostage in Enugu and has asked
 the company to suspend all opera-
 tions.   He said Biafran security
 forces would guard the instal-,
 lations for safekeeping. Shell,-BP
 does not appear to be disturbed
 by Ojukwu's action, however, and
 is now maintaining that its
 original agreement with Lagos
 called for royalty payments only
 once a year.                           I

 TANZANIAN PRESIDENT TIGHTENS CONTROL
 President Nyerere has taken a
 still firmer grip on the Tanzanian
 Government in the face of increasing
 resistance to his socialist policy.
 The purge of such pro-Communist rad
 icals as Oscar Kambona, minister
 of regional administration and sec-
 retary general of the country's only
 party, may bring a slight lull in
 the regime's steady leftward drift,
 but will not significantly improve
 relations with the West.
 Kambona's flight to London last
 week removed Nyerere's most likely
 challenger and settled a long power
 struggle between the Kambona fac-
 tion and those party leaders allied
 with Vice President Kawawa. Kawawa's
 colleagues resented the ambitious
 Kambona, who was studying in England
 while they were building the party
 prior to independence, and have
 been maneuvering for years to oust
 him as secretary general.   In June
 Kambona resigned from both his
 cabinet and party positions after
 Nyerere assumed personal jurisdic-
 tion over the country's 17 regional
 commissioners and left Kambona with
 no real authority.
 Kambona's position had stead-
 ily eroded since 1963 when he was
 minister of both external affairs
 and defense and second only to
 Nyerere in political power. He lost
 the defense portfolio after the
 army mutiny in 1964 and external
 affairs in 1965.   Nyerere found
 Kambona to be an ineffective and
 undependable administrator of
 questionable loyalty, but had been
 reluctant to curb him openly.   His
 latent suspicions about Kambona's
 Page  25
 long-time Communist contacts may
 have been finally aroused by recent
 revelations about his foreign bank
 accounts and East German  financial
 support.   In the last two weeks,
 five of Kambona's followers have
 been arrested for subversive activity
 which included contacts with the
 army and efforts to form an opposi-
 tion party.
 During the past six months new
 resistance to Nyerere's socialist
 policies has come not only from con-
 servative businessmen but also from
 radical politicians who strongly
 object to his decree that they may
 not have outside income.   This op-
 position is fragmented and lacks
 any common bonds of doctrine or
 friendship, but is likely to accel-
 erate Nyerere's authoritarian trend.
 The government shake-up in June
 removed several other radicals from
 the cabinet and left more able, con-
 servative administrators in charge.
 Nyerere has no intention of abandon-
 ing his socialist ideals but the
 changes appear designed to restore
 investor confidence and prevent the
 radicals from forcing too fast a
 socialist pace.
 Despite the apparent swing to-
 ward moderation, Nyerere's fixation
 with "imperialists" and his mili-
 tant support for southern Africa's
 nationalists would seem to preclude
 any significant improvement in
 Tanzania's relations with the West.
 The government press remains viru-
 lently anti-American and those
 leaders who favor closer relations
 with Communist China are now in firm
 control.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 The Latin American Solidarity Organization
 (LASO) meeting in Havana this week has given Fidel
 Castro a forum to call for the creation of "many
 Vietnams" in the Western Hemisphere.   Speaking at
 the opening ceremonies on 31 July, Cuban President
 Dorticos lashed out at "Yankee imperialism" and
 stressed that armed struggle is the only way to
 achieve true liberation.   Dorticos implied that
 this doctrine of revolutionary violence is primar-
 ily a reaction to "imperialism's repressive meas-
 ures" in Latin America, a line apparently accepted
 by the pro-Moscow Communists at the conference.
 Revolutionary slogans and anti-US tirades can be
 expected to continue for the balance of the con-
 ference, which probably will culminate in a fiery
 closing speech by Castro on 8 August.
 Venezuela's interest in pressing the organi-
 zation of American States to meet soon and take up
 its complaint against Cuba took a back seat last
 week because of the devastating earthquake that
 rocked Venezuela and Colombia on 29 July.   The OAS
 is still trying to find an acceptable date for the
 meeting, with most governments now apparently favor-
 ing late September.
 In Peru, a dispute between the ruling and oppo-
 sition coalitions over the leadership of the Senate
 plunged the country into a serious constitutional
 crisis.   President Belaunde, however, is quietly
 seeking a negotiated compromise and the military,
 while it is following the dispute with interest, is
 following a hands-off policy.   Bolivia's hapless mil-
 itary forces reportedly suffered more casualties
 this week in new encounters with the guerrillas and,
 as the week closed, Brazil faced the possibility
 of new student disorders protesting the govern-
 ment's determination to keep an illegal extremist-
 led national student organization from meeting in
 Sao Paulo.   F7              I

 CUBA IMPROVES ITS DEFENSIVE MILITARY CAPABILITY
 The defensive capability of
 the Cuban armed forces has been
 improved by new equipment deliv-
 ered by the USSR over the past
 11 months.
 Since last September, Cuba
 has received 19 major military aid
 shipments,  and at least one more
 is en route.   Although these de-
 liveries appear intended primarily
 to replace materiel worn out or
 expended in training, some of the
 equipment is more modern and
 sophisticated than that being
 replaced.   For example,  the Cubans
 have received at least 23 MIG-21FL
 jet fighters, the Soviets'  standard
 export model with a limited all-
 weather capability.   These are
 replacements for an estimated 30
 to 40 earlier model MIGs.
 The newer SA-3 surface-to-air
 missile system, designed primarily
 for protection against low-flying
 aircraft, may be introduced
 shortly.   The SA-3 would comple-
 ment the SA-2 system which has
 been established throughout Cuba
 since 1962.   While no SA-3 mis-
 siles or related equipment have
 yet been seen in Cuba, aerial
 25X1    photography                showed what
 appeared to be an  A-   site under
 construction in a Havana suburb,
 less than three miles from air
 defense headquarters.   If the
 system is indeed to be deployed
 in Cuba,  it will be the first
 time outside the USSR.
 The Cuban Navy's force of
 12 Komar guided-missile patrol
 boats, Cuba's most potent weapons
 afloat, has been increased to 18.
 In addition, four SO-1-class
 submarine chasers have arrived in
 the last six months, bringing the
 total of this class to ten. These
 acquisitions considerably enhance
 the navy's ability to defend
 coastal waters and prevent illegal
 emigration.
 The Cuban ground forces ap-
 parently have received only one
 new type of equipment, the BMD-20.
 This 200-mm.,  truck-mounted rocket
 launcher was first displayed in
 the Soviet Union in 1954.   An es-
 timated 25 to 30 have arrived in
 Cuba since December.
 The Castro regime is contin-
 uing extensive construction of
 underground shelters for personnel
 and equipment

 Recurrent guerrilla suc-

 an insurgency that has become in-

 According to Bolivian press re-
 ports, the guerrillas met with
 little resistance and easily
 evaded army support units which
 arrived later on the scene.
 Moving southward, the band
 engaged army units in sporadic
 clashes from 27 to 31 July in
 the rugged Duran area--about 54
 miles north of Nacahuasu.   Gov-
 ernment forces are said to have
 suffered some dead and wounded
 without inflicting any confirmed
 guerrilla casualties.
 The army's recurrent demon-
 strations of its inability to
 cope with the guerrillas--who
 seem able to roam at will through
 the area--and increasing evidence
 that local garrisons lack aggres-
 siveness will further weaken the
 Barrientos government in the
 long run.   The present situation
 has spurred contingency planning
 by the governments of neighbor-
 ing Paraguay and Argentina to
 take action if the situation de-
 teriorates.
 PERU'S UNRESOLVED CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS
 Peru's most serious consti-
 tutional crisis in recent years
 remains unresolved, with Presi-
 dent Belaunde and Congress both
 seeking strong bargaining posi-
 tions.
 On 28 July the opposition-
 controlled Senate, allegedly
 using fraudulent tactics, voided
 the election of the government's
 candidate as presiding officer
 of the Senate.   The government
 senators, incensed at this tactic
 boycotted further meet-
 ings--thereby preventing any
 activity by either house of Con-
 gress.   Each side now is accusing
 the other of violating the consti-
 tution.
 An opposition party spokes-
 man met with Belaunde on 29 July
 to discuss the impasse.   Although
 no agreement was reached, both
 appeared eager for a compromise.
 Belaunde's relations with
 Congress, never warm, have been
 deteriorating steadily for
 months. Recent actions of Con-
 gress have challenged his govern-
 ment's handling of several im-
 portant issues.
 Belaunde is under consider-
 able pressure from hard-line
 elements within his own party
 to deal firmly with the opposi-
 tion parties.

 INVASION JITTERS HIT HAITI
 Haitian President Duvalier
 established a nationwide curfew
 on 29 July following reports of
 an imminent invasion of the north.
 Duvalier's action was ini-
 tiated in response to "invasion"
 reports reaching him from his
 representatives in Washington and
 Miami. He acted characteristically
 in tightening security controls
 while investigating activities
 which had aroused his suspicions.
 The US ambassador reports
 that Port-au-Prince is calm even
 though rumors of an invasion have
 been heightened by the curfew.
 Anti-Duvalier exiles are consid- 25X1
 ered to have little capability
 for mounting a serious invasion
 attempt at this time.
