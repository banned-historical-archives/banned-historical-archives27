Information available 
as of 10 July 1987 
was used In this report. 
China's Stake 
in the Iran-Iraq War 
Unless international pressure increases markedly, Beijing is unlikely to 
stop its highly lucrative arms sales to the Persian Gulf. We estimate 
Beijing's arms sales to Iran and Iraq add up to roughly $7.5 billion-75 
percent of China's total arms sales since 1981�and that the proceeds have 
been used to augment a defense budget constrained by economic modern-
ization priorities. Beijing's sales to Iraq were far greater than those to Iran 
through 1985, but China has become Iran's main supplier of weapons, and 
sales to both nations were over $1 billion in 1986. The Chinese decision in 
late 1985 to begin major sales to Iran was probably in large measure 
stimulated by the precipitate drop in Iraqi military purchasesn 1983 and 
1984 and possibly Iraq's inability to pay on contracts. 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping time and again reportedly has overruled 
opposition from the Foreign Ministry on arms sales and probably sees the 
Persian Gulf sales as contributing to Chinese national interests in several 
ways beyond financial gain: 
� Beijing probably perceives it has helped limit Soviet influence in the 
Persian Gulf by reducing Iraqi dependence on Soviet arms and providing 
politically isolated Iran with an alternative to Moscow. 
� Beijing has exploited the warming relations with Iran to open a new 
dialogue on Afghanistan that may lead to bilateral cooperation in support 
of the Afghan insurgents. 
� Iraq and Iran are, in effect, testing new Chinese weapons under actual 
battlefield conditions, providing Beijing invaluable information for future 
improvements in these systems. 
� China's use of Saudi Arabia as an intermediary for arms deliveries to 
Iraq has increased bilateral contacts despite  Riyadh's continued refusal 
to switch recognition from Taipei to Beijing 
Beijing is, however, extremely sensitive to international opinion, and the 
recent criticism of its HY-2 (Silkworm) missile sales to Iran has raised the 
stakes for Beijing of continued arms sales. Senior Chinese officials have 
responded to US criticism of Iranian sales with public statements of 
feigned surprise at the allegation, continued denials, and whispers that 
other nations�such as North Korea�have resold Chinese arms illegally 
to Iran. Beijing is also attempting to deflect the increased negative 
publicity by focusing world  attention on the "superpower buildup" and 
rivalry in the Persian Gulf.

In our judgment, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping may consider ending 
China's Iranian sales only if he is convinced that continued sales might 
have one or more of the following effects: 
� Severely Disrupt Chinese-US Relations. Beijing values the deepening 
relations with Washington both for the technological and economic 
benefits as well as for the political leverage they provide in Sino-Soviet 
negotiations. The Chinese are almost certainly deeply concerned about 
the dangers inherent should a Chinese-built missile strike a US naval 
combatant. 
� Ostracize Beijing From the Internatic ial Community. A 27 June 
commentary in People's Daily showed a concern in Beijing that US 
charges are convincing other nations that Beijing's arms sales are the 
source of the recent heightening of tensions in the Persian Gulf. To 
combat this, the Chinese are supporting the new UN Security Council 
resolution calling for a cease-fire--but have not agreed to link it to 
mandatory sanctions�and will take every opportunity to declare their 
support for an early end to the war. 
� Lead to an Iranian Victory. We believe Beijing wants no winner in the 
Persian Gulf war, and, if China is convinced that a particular weapon 
sale or continued sales are tipping the balance, it almost certainly will re-
ject new arms transfer agreements. 
� Expand Soviet Influence in the Gulf Kuwait's agreement to accept 
Soviet assistance is probably perceived in Beijing as a dangerous signal 
that the more moderate Arab states might be willing to allow the Soviets 
to play a security role in the Persian Gulf. If Deng sees this as an 
opportunity created for Moscow by Beijing's sales to Tehran, he may veto 
future sales as counterproductive to China's efforts to minimize Soviet 
influence in the region. 
We believe the Chinese may have leaked news  of an embargo on new arms

Ter Stet 
In our judgment, Chinese military sales at current levels have not given ei-
ther side a definitive advantage�although they certainly are of greater 
importance to Iran than Iraq�but have increased the danger to nonbellig-
erents. The Chinese claim antiship missiles, being installed on the Strait of 
Hormuz by Iran and delivered to Iraq for use from B-6D (TU-16) bombers, 
have a 70-percent chance of hitting an unprotected medium-to-large-size 
ship. In comparison with other antiship missiles used in the Gulf, the HY-2 
warhead is three times larger than the Exocet's and seven times larger than 
the Italian Sea Killer's, making it far more likely to sink a tanker. The 
HY-2 travels to its maximum range of 95 kilometers in five minutes. Ships 
protected by active or electronic defense systems may be able to defeat a 
single HY-2 but could have trouble defending against two or more 
approaching at once.

China's Stake 
in the Iran-Iraq War 
Beijing's Agenda 
China historically has been a minor actor in the 
Persian Gulf, but soon after the Iran-Iraq war erupted 
in September 1980 an officially neutral China began 
promoting its political, economic, and strategic inter-
ests in the Gulf by selling arms to both sides. China 
has obtained some $5.3 billion in contracts with Iraq 
and $2.2 billion in contracts with Iran, accounting for 
roughly 75 percent of China's total sales since 1981. 
Beijing's sales to Iraq were far greater than to Iran 
through 1986, but in the same year China also 
became Iran's main supplier of weapons and sales to 
both nations were over $1 billion 
The Chinese deliver a wide variety of conventional 
equipment to both sides, most of it dependable, 
durable, but dated hardware of 1950s design. In 1983, 
Beijing sold two batteries (eight launchers) of Silk-
worm antiship missiles to Iraq and has probably 
delivered five of 12 batteries of the same antiship 
missile to the Iranians since April 1986. In addition, 
Iraq has received four bomber aircraft equipped with 
C-601 missiles as well as fighters from China, while 
Iran has received surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) it 
uses to defend major cities. Long-range field guns and 
ammunition have gone to both warring states, and 
Iraq has received over 1,000 antiaircraft guns. Main 
battle tank sales to Iraq alone�over 2,500 tanks, 
have made China 
second only to the Soviet Union in tank exports in the 
1980s 
The Financial Gains 
The outbreak of the war coincided with Beijing's 
decision to enter the world arms market to finance 
defense modernization at a time of fiscal retrench-
ment 
China's leader Deng Xiaoping initiated China's arms 
sales policy in 1980, stating that, if Warsaw Pact and 
NATO countries could sell arms, there was no reason 
China could not sell them too. Defense spending had 
been hit particularly hard by economic retrench-
ments, and its share of the state budget allocated by

Beijing has been declining steadily from nearly 18 
percent in 1979 to only 8.3 percent in 1987. Accord-
ing to Chinese Government statistics�which we be-
lieve are accurate barometers of the trends but dis-
close only about half of actual levels of defense 
spending�since 1981 the defense budget has re-
mained fairly static 
Arms exports have become an important source of 
revenue for the military, because the military is 
allowed to retain a portion of the profits from sales 
abroad. We estimate last year's sales to Iran and Iraq, 
for example, are equal to 20 percent of the actual 
defense budget. Moreover, because each component 
retains a share of its own profits there is intense 
competition among the various elements of the de-
fense establishment. For example: 
� The Chinese General Staff is on of the principal 
beneficiaries of this windfall of hard currency earn-
ings. Baoli�known in English as Poly Technol-
ogies�a company owned and operated by the Gen-

Political Links 
Another�albeit secondary�factor in Chinese think-
ing on arms sales to Iran and Iraq has been Beijing's 
desire to expand Chinese and limit Soviet influence in 
Southwest Asia. The outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, 
coming as it did on the heels of the Islamic fundamen-
talist revolution in Iran against the anti-Soviet Shah 
in January 1979 and the Soviet invasion of Afghani-
stan in December 1979, heightened longstanding Chi-
nese concerns that Moscow would exploit regional 
insta extend Soviet influence in the region. 
TCS 3080/87 
We believe the Chinese calculated that Tehran's 
alienation of the West over the US Embassy hostages 
left the Iranians vulnerable to Soviet pressure when 
the Iran-Iraq war broke out. Chinese media reports in 
1980 warned that Moscow's "covetous eyes" were  
focused on Iran as well as Afghanistan  
 At the same time, the Chinese expanded rela-
tions with Baghdad by filling the gap in Iraqi arms 
supplies created by the Soviet embargo against  Iraq 
during the first year of the war, 
Battlefield Testing 
An added bonus for Beijing is the battlefield testing of 
new weapons, many developed with the funds provid-
ed by arms sales and some of which will ultimately be 
deployed with China's own forces. China's main 
battle tank was among the first weapon systems 
modified as a result of Iraqi combat experiences. The 
tank has been reconfigured with armored side skirts 
and standoff armor around the turrets�an Israeli 
innovation�to protect against light antitank weap-
ons. Additionally, the Type 531 armored personnel 
carrier, which was among the first pieces of Chinese 
equipment sold to Iraq, is now equipped with an air-
cooled engine to avoid overheating in the high tem-
peratures of the Gulf, and new variants have been 
developed as command vehicles and armored ambu-
lances

try objections, claiming that foreign exchange is 
needed to finance military procurements from the 
West and provide significant funds to revitalize the 
defense industries. The military probably points to 
such programs as the $1.6 billion purchase in 1984 of 
the production line and technology for Israel's Python 
III air-to-air heat-seeking missile as tangible payoff to 
China's defenses. Most recently, following Secretary 
of State Shultz's March visit to Beijing, Vice Chair-
man of the Central Military Commission Yang 
Shangkun and the president of Baoli ' met with Deng 
Xiaoping to discuss US demarches on arms sales to  
Iran./ 
 (b)(1) 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials' efforts to regain 
control over China's military exports have consistently 
failed because of the military's political clout and 
Deng's support for military exports 
'The Chinese General Staff has used Baoli to conclude over $3.2 
billion in arms sales and over $520 million in military purchases 
from abroad since 1984. In addition to Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law 
as president, the ompanys senior officials include Yan Shan 
kun's son-in-law.  
Impact of Demarches 
We believe US demarches may have helped the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its efforts to curb the 
military's arms sales policy. After Secretary of State 
Shultz visited Beijing in March and reiterated US 
displeasure with China's

The clearest impact of US demarches, however, has 
been to increase China's efforts to hide its arms 
deliveries to Iran, including the use of foreign flag 
carriers for particularly sensitive cargos, such as the 
Silkworms, and increased reliance on night loading of 
such cargos to thwart US reconnaissance capabilities 
(see inset). Since the Chinese delivery of antiship 
missiles to Iran became public in March of this year, 
Beijing has increased its public denials, attacking the 
charges as "futile slander." It has also embroidered 
these denials of arms sales with claims that Chinese 
equipment, particularly the Silkworm missile system, 
have not only been transferred, but also actually 
produced, by third countries, such as the Soviet  
Union, North Korea, and France  
Regional Relations 
-Ties-Norte4-
China's major arms sale role has not translated into 
great regional influence, but Beijing's goals are rela-
tively modest and China does not seek to exercise 
great power in the area. Beijing aims to expand 
bilateral ties to individual states, to build markets for 
military and nonmilitary Chinese goods and services,4 
and also to warn host governments of the Soviet threat 
to the region. Given its limited aims, we believe 
Beijing sees itself as having been successful in the 
region. 
Iraq: Smooth Sailing From the Start 
Beijing's willingness to supply arms has strengthened 
already warm Sino-Iraqi relations, which include 
party as well as diplomatic ties. In May 1981, Deng 
' China's nonmilitary trade with Iran and Iraq is minor and 
accounts for less than I percent of China's foreign trade. Sino-Iraqi 
annual two-way trade averaged some $120 million for the period 
1981 to 1986. Sino-Iranian t god about $140 million 
annually in the same period.

of North Korean middlemen and Hong Kong and  
Thai front companies.  
In public denials of a Chinese-Iranian arms connec-
tion. Beijing points to ryongyang as a potential 
source. North Korea may, in fact, be reselling some 
'Chinese small arms it receives as part of a military 
aid program but has not been involved in the major 
transfers of Chinese arms to Iran. 
The North Korean Connection 
China has been using North Korea as an intermedi-
ary for arms sales to Iran since the early 1980s. 
Defense Ministry�affiliated defense corporations, 
particularly North China Industries (NORINCO), 
and Premier Zhao Ziyang met in Beijing with Iraqi 
Deputy Prime Minister Ramadan�the most senior 
Iraqi visit to Beijing in two years�and signed two 
bilateral agreements on trade and technical coopera-
tion. In 1982 and 1983, respectively, the two sides 
convened the inaugural sessions of a permanent com-
mittee on economic and technical cooperation and a 
joint committee on trade and economic cooperation. 
As an example of their close relations, the manpower-
short Iraqis have contracted for Chinese labor for 
hydroelectric, irrigation, highway, petroleum, dam, 
housing, and agricultural projects. Estimates of the 
total number of Chinese workers sent to Iraq between 
1981 and 1986 run as high as 20,000, according to 
Top-Seesat-
7X7.5 3080/67 
Chinese media reports 
\however, the number of Chinese workers 
in Iraq�currently around 15,000�has been dropping 
since June 1986 in the face of Iraq's inability to repay 
its more than $100 million debt to China for these 
services 
A Common Cause With Riyadh 
We believe Beijing also has tried to exploit Iraqi arms 
sales to get its foot in the door in Saudi Arabia. China 
has long sought to persuade Riyadh to end its diplo-
matic recognition of Taipei and establish relations 
with Beijing. Although Riyadh continues to refuse to 
switch recognition from Taipei, Beijing apparently

has had some success at improving ties 
(b)(1) 
(b)(3) 
Despite the lack of diplomatic ties, Beijing has suc-
ceeded in expanding Sino-Saudi contacts. Chinese 
Premier Zhao and then Saudi Crown Prince Fand 
became the first leaders of the two countries to meet 
when they exchanged greetings at the 1981 Cancun 
summit. Foreign Minister Sa'ud's visit to Beijing in 
1982 as part of an Arab League delegation marked 
the first time a Saudi official had visited China. King 
Fand hosted a state banquet for Chinese Muslim 
pilgrims visiting Mecca in 1984; prior to that year 
Chinese pilgrims had only met with Saudi leaders in 
private. Two Saudi trade delegations visited China's 
Ningxia Muslim Autonomous Region to begin eco-
nomic cooperation in 1985, Chinese Vice Premier Yao 
Yilin and Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah met in Oman 
in November 1985, and Zhao received a delectation of 
Saudi entrepreneurs in November 1986.  
China's willingness to sell significant amounts of arms 
to Iran in 1983 created a new momentum in political, 
economic, cultural, scientific, and technical exchanges 
as the number of these exchanges totaled more in 
1983 than the previous four years combined. Most 
notably, Foreign Ministry adviser He Ying in early 
1983 made the highest level official Chinese visit to 
Iran since the Islamic revolution, and Iranian Foreign 
Minister Velayati in September 1983 signed a five-
year cultural, scienti iednical cooperation 
agreement in Beijing 
Iran: A Far More Turbulent Relationship 
Beijing was among the first to recognize the funda-
mentalist Khomeini government, but Beijing's rela-
tions with Iran since the revolution have seen dramat-
ic swings. Iran, initially, was not a readymade market 
for China's Soviet-style equipment, but, as sources of 
spare parts for Iran's Western hardware dried up, 
Tehran faced the choice of acquiring military supplies  
from either China or the Soviet Blo�

with Deng Xiaoping or Premier Zhao Ziyang directly; 
two days after his departure two senior Revolutionary 
Guard officials met in China with military officers

sive weapons" through middlemen. We believe Bei-
jing's change of heart was probably in large part 
stimulated by the precipitate drop in Iraqi military 
purchases in 1983 and  1984 and possibly Iraqi inabil-
ity to pay on contracts 
Beijing's dramatic policy shift involved not only the 
sale of major arms to Iran but also the shipment of 
weapons directly to Iranian harbors and the training 
of Iranian missile crews in China:

Not surprisingly, Beijing's willingness to engage in 
direct sales to Iran has led to a substantial deepening 
of relations. In addition to setting the stage for new 
arms sales, the visit of Iranian parliament Speaker 
Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Velayati was 
marked by meetings with Deng, Zhao, President Li 
Xiannian, and other senior Chinese leaders. The 
official press in both countries touted the visit, with

Beijing apparently sees itself as a bridge between 
Tehran and Washington on Afghanistan and has 
taken some pains to keep US officials discreetly 
informed on these exchang  
Beijing 
may hope that Washington might temper US de-
marches on Chinese arms sales if it perceives China 
exercising  a positive influence on Iran on the Afghani-
stan issue. 
Impact on the War 
In our judgment, Chinese military sales have not 
given either side a definitive advantage but certainly 
are of greater importance to Iran than Iraq�which 
buys large quantities of arms from the Soviet Union. 
Iran has been forced to fight an infantry war in order 
to minimize its equipment disadvantages relative to 
Iraq. Tehran has been unable to replace armor lost in 
the war and now has roughly one-sixth the number of 
operational vehicles that Iraq has. Without the consis-
tent supply of artillery, small arms, and large amounts 
of ammunition proffered by Beijing, the Iranians 
would have difficulty sustaining their ground attacks, 
although Tehran could increasingly turn to other 
suppliers such as North Korea or East European 
countries 
Beijing's supply of antiship missiles to both sides, 
however, has markedly increased the danger to non-
belligerents. The Chinese claim that the HY-2 mis-
siles being installed on the Strait of Hormuz have a 
9 
70-percent chance of hitting an unprotected medium-
to-large-size ship�although the Iraqis reportedly had 
only a 30-percent success rate using HY-2s against 
Iranian targets. In comparison with other antiship 
missiles in use in the Gulf, the HY-2 carries a 
warhead three times larger than the Exocet's and 
seven times larger than the Italian Sea Killer's, 
making it far more likely to sink a tanker. The HY-2 
has a range of 95 kilometers and travels this distance 
in five minutes. Ships protected by active or electronic 
defense systems may be able to defeat a single HY-2, 
but in our opinion would have trouble defending 
against two or more approaching at once 
Baghdad's acquisition of Chinese B-6D bombers and 
C-601 antiship missiles probably will improve Iraq's 
ability to launch standoff weapons at targets in the 
Persian Gulf. Most probably referring to Iraq's new 
bombers, the Iraqi Air Force Commander recently 
stated that Baghdad is prepared to hit economic and 
oil targets in Iran using new and stronger weapons. 
Even though the bombers have a 3,000-kilometer 
range, the limitations of their 1950s technology sug-
gest that their primary use will be in the upper 
reaches of the Gulf where they can be protected by 
Iraqi fighter cover and air defenses. The slow-moving 
B-6D lacks advanced electronic countermeasures to 
help protect it from ground-based air defenses and 
fighter aircraft. Moreover, the onboard radar of the 
B-6D has demonstrated poor performance in open 
water search and lacks sophisticated electronic 
counter-countermeasures and, consequently, is sus-
ceptible to jamming by opposing aircraft and ships. 
Looking Ahead 
Unless international pressure increases markedly, we 
see little chance that Beijing will stop its highly 
lucrative arms sales to Iran and Iraq. Beijing seems 
increasingly concerned, however, about the possible 
impact of its arms sales on US-China relations and 
about the potential damage to China's other foreign 
policy interests from the attention being given to 
Chinese-made Silkworm antiship missiles in the Gulf.

China wants to protect its image and does not want 
the issue to escalate to the point that it affects other 
areas of its relations with the United States. Senior 
Chinese officials have responded to US criticism of

"stream of lies" and argued that the United States is 
in no position to lecture anyone on arms sales to Iran. 
Beijing is also attempting to deflect the increased 
negative publicity by focusing world attention on the

Chino's C-8W ansisAfp missik 
We believe that any reversal of policy will have to 
come from Deng himself. In our judgment, Deng may 
consider ending Iranian sales only if he is convinced 
that continued sales might have one or more of the 
following effects: 
� Severely Disrupt Chinese-US Relations. Beijing 
values the deepening relations with Washington 
both for technological and economic benefits as well 
as the political leverage they provide in Sino-Soviet 
negotiations. The Chinese are almost certainly deep-
ly concerned about the dangers inherent should a 
Chinese-built missile strike a US naval combatant. 
� Ostracize Beijing from the International Communi-
ty. The 27 June commentary in People's Daily 
showed a concern in Beijing that US charges are 
convincing other nations that Beijing's arms sales 
are the source of the recent heightening of tensions 
in the Persian Gulf. To combat this, the Chinese are 
supporting the new UN Security Council resolution 
calling for a cease-fire�but have not agreed to link 
it to mandatory sanctions�and will take every 
opportunity to declare their support for an early end 
to the war. 
�T-op-Seeret-
ws 3080/87 
� Lead to an Iranian Victory. We believe Beijing 
wants no winner in the Persian Gulf war, and, if 
China is convinced that a particular weapon sale or 
continued sales are tipping the balance, it almost 
certainly will reject new arms transfer agreements. 
� Expand Soviet Influence in the Gulf. Kuwait's 
agreement to accept Soviet assistance is probably 
perceived in Beijing as a dangerous signal that the 
more moderate Arab states might be willing to 
allow the Soviets to play a security role in the 
Persian Gulf. If Deng sees this as an opportunity 
created for Moscow by Beijing's sales to Tehran, he 
may veto future sales as counterproductive to 
China's efforts to minimize Soviet influence in the 
region. 
With few other arms markets the size of the Gulf 
available to Beijing, however, anything short of these 
potential consequences is unlikely to lead Deng to 
forgo this extremely large source of revenue for 
military modernization
