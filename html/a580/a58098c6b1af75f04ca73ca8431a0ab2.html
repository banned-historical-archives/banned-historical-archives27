 SPAIN
 Political terrorism has subsided, at
 least temporarily, in Spain since the
 government's institution of stern security
 measures last week. Extremist groups of
 both the left and the right, however, have
 issued new threats of violence.
 On January 28, Prime Minister Suarez
 suspended portions of the constitution for
 one month, thereby enabling police to
 search homes without warrants and hold
 suspects indefinitely. The new measures,
 which still stopped short of an imposition
 of martial law, were announced after
 gunmen killed three policemen in the
 Madrid suburbs, bringing the death toll
 from political violence to ten for the week
 in the capital area.
 Earlier the same day, the government
 mobilized all police and civil guards, set
 up roadblocks around the capital, and
 sent special units to airports and railroad
 terminals in search of the suspected
 terrorists. Some 200 persons-most said
 to be known leftist extremists-were
 quickly detained for questioning about the
 incident, responsibility for which was
 claimed by a purportedly leftist group.
 The group, which was responsible for the
 kidnaping of a high political official in
 December and a senior general last week,
 announced it had killed the policemen in
 retaliation for the murder early last week
 of four Communist lawyers.
 The government is taking pains to re-
 main in close touch with leaders of the
 moderate political opposition, who con-
 tinue to give basic support to Suarez' ef-
 forts to curb terrorism. Some opposition
 parties, however, have voiced complaints
 that the police dragnet last weekend was
 unduly harsh on members of far-left par-
 ties and trade unions, By midweek, the
 government had released many of the
 leftist suspects.
 President Makarios (left) shakes hands with Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash
 The detention of so many leftists may
 in fact have been influenced by a desire on
 the part of the government to pacify
 rightist senior officers, who had been par-
 ticularly upset last week by the kidnaping
 of the general. On February 1, King Juan
 Carlos, who has played a key role in keep-
 ing the military loyal to the government
 and out of politics, was pictured
 prominently  in  Spanish  newspapers
 lunching with a hard-line Francoist
 general and his troops.
 At the same time, however, the govern-
 ment has deported several foreign
 right-wing extremists. In addition, the
 rightist subdirector of the naval war
 college was recently dismissed for in-
 subordination.
 Both terrorist organizations involved in
 the recent incidents have made new
 threats. The extreme leftist group said it
 would carry out further kidnapings of
 prominent officials if the approximately
 200 political prisoners remaining in
 Spanish jails are not released. The rightist
 Apostolic Anti-Communist Alliance,
 possibly incensed over police protection
 given last week to left-wing political
 leaders, threatened a group of Socialist
 union members with "execution" unless
 they cease political activities.
 Despite the threats, Prime Minister
 Suarez has reaffirmed his determination
 to resume talks with opposition leaders
 about a date and ground rules for the
 parliamentary election promised for this
 spring
 1      WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CYPRUS
 A meeting between Cypriot President
 Makarios and Turkish Cypriot leader
 Denktash in Nicosia on January 27
 appears to have set the stage for a
 resumption  of intercommunal
 negotiations, which have been stalled for a
 year. Each side has its own expectations
 and strategies for such talks, however,
 and it is by no means certain they would
 be more productive than earlier
 negotiations.
 The two leaders, who were meeting for
 the first time since Turkey invaded
 Cyprus in 1974, had a wide-ranging ex-
 change. Although it was inconclusive,
 both Makarios and Denktash clarified
 their positions on certain issues. Makarios
 indicated he could accept a bizonal
 federation, for example, provided the uni-
 ty of the state is safeguarded and all
 Cypriots are assured freedom of move-
 ment and the right to settle and own
 property throughout the island.
 Denktash indicated this might be possi-
 ble on a limited basis provided adequate
 security is established and most authority
 resides in the two regional governments.
 Moreover, he indicated more clearly than
 previously that the Turkish Cypriot claim
 to 32.8 percent of the island is negotiable.
 Makarios, who for some time has conced-
 ed 20 percent of the island to the Turkish
 Cypriots, is likely to yield more territory
 in a multizonal solution than in a bizonal
 one.

 The Turkish Cypriot leader's initiative
 to meet with Makarios and his con-
 ciliatory approach seem aimed at reviving
 a negotiating process and are part of a
 broader mainland Turkish strategy to
 appear as reasonable as possible to the
 new  US administration.  Denktash's
 moves and Turkey's recently announced
 withdrawal of another 1,000 troops from
 Cyprus seem intended in part to help
 secure  approval of the  US-Turkish
 defense cooperation agreement.
 Makarios is just as interested in pro-
 jecting a moderate image to the new
 US  administration.  He  hopes  for
 greater involvement by both the US and
 the European Community in the nego-
 tiating process.
 The two leaders agreed to meet again
 under the auspices of UN Secretary
 General Waldheim in Nicosia on
 February 12 and 13 to continue their dis-
 Political maneuvering has recently
 become more intense within the Christian
 Democratic Party and the Socialist Par-
 ty-the two groups that must cooperate if
 an Italian government not dependent on
 the Communists is to be formed.
 Prime Minister Andreotti's acceptance
 last week of a labor-management agree-
 ment that avoids any tampering with
 Italy's wage-indexation system, which ties
 wages  to the cost-of-living index,
 triggered criticism from a wide array of
 Christian Democratic leaders. Andreotti
 appears to have quieted his critics for now
 with a promise of further government ac-
 tion on labor costs. The promised govern-
 ment move, which was to be announced
 on February 4, is likely to combine an
 assumption of part of industry's social
 security expenses with some offsetting tax
 increases.
 Among the Socialists, former party
 secretary Mancini has been trying to un-
 dermine Bettino Craxi, the current party
 leader. Mancini failed last week to gain
 enough backing to oust Craxi, but further
 challenges are doubtless in store.
 These maneuvers seem likely to in-
 augurate a period of heightened political
 activity. Many Italians believe Andreot-
 ti's minority government will be lucky to
 survive the spring. The obstacles to major
 changes, however, are still formidable:
 ? Although the center of gravity
 among Christian Democrats may be
 moving to the right, party leaders
 know that ousting Andreotti would
 open a wide range of political and
 economic uncertainties.
 ? The Socialists, whose votes or
 abstentions would be critical in any ef-
 fort to freeze out the Communists, re-
 main a question mark. Craxi says he
 would like to move the party back
 toward the Christian Democrats, but
 he views this as a long-term operation.
 For now, the Socialists could not be
 counted on even to deliver a cohesive
 block of abstentions-much less
 positive  votes-if the Communists
 went into opposition.
 ? Finally,  the Communists are
 strongly opposed to a change of
 government. Believing the time is not
 ripe for further Communist political
 gains and reluctant to rejoin the op-
 position, they have let it be known that
 they regard the Andreotti government
 as the best available. Given Com-
 munist strength in parliament and in
 labor, the other parties will feel com-
 pelled to move carefully.
 Under these circumstances, a  full-
 fledged government crisis does not ap-
 pear imminent. Nevertheless, the po-
 litical maneuvering-with the risk of
 crisis at some point-seems likely to con-
 tinue into spring.
 ROMANIA
 President  Ceausescu  announced  on
 January 25 the most sweeping shakeup in
 the Romanian party and government in
 recent years. The country's economic
 problems seem to have prompted the
 changes,  which  follow a smaller
 reorganization only seven months ago.

 SECRET
 Ceausescu's apparent prescription for
 Romania's economic ills-which stem in
 large part from his ambitious develop-
 ment program-is to consolidate party
 control over the government's economic
 apparatus. He has advanced party ac-
 tivists from the provinces into the middle
 levels of those government sectors that are
 lagging.
 Cornet Burtica, a party secretary, and
 Ion Stanescu, a former interior minister,
 were named deputy premiers. Stanescu
 also became a party secretary and may
 assume responsibility for military and
 security affairs. It is unusual for two
 Romanian   party   secretaries
 simultaneously to serve as deputy
 premiers.
 New ministers were appointed for
 labor, electric power, and the mining and
 petroleum  industries,  and  new
 minister-state secretaries were selected for
 the troubled areas of foreign trade,
 agriculture, machine building, and the
 chemical industry. Ceausescu's concern
 about flagging popular enthusiasm and
 discipline led him also to choose new peo-
 ple for the posts of justice minister,
 general prosecutor, and chairman of the
 Supreme Court.
 Most of these ministerial appointees
 have strong party backgrounds. Seven are
 former county first secretaries.
 Ceausescu expanded the party's five--
 man Permanent Bureau by adding his
 wife Elena, Burtica, another party
 secretary, and a deputy premier.
 Ceausescu appears to use the bureau to
 resolve day-to-day operational questions.
 In the past, it has seemed to focus largely
 on economic matters, but Ceausescu may
 now intend to expand its role.
 The elevation of Elena Ceausescu to the
 bureau formalizes the considerable
 behind-the-scenes influence she reportedly
 has had in party affairs, especially in per-
 sonnel matters, for some time. A full
 member of the party's top-level Political
 Executive Committee,  she has now
 become a powerful force in her own right.
 She is widely disliked in Romania, and
 her new post may spur more charges of
 nepotism.
 President Tito (left) with party executive committee secretary Stane Dolanc
 YUGOSLAVIA
 The Yugoslav party presidium on
 January 31 gave key posts in the
 preparations for the party congress to be
 held in 1978 to two bitter rivals for Tito's
 mantle as party leader. The move will
 result in a test of strength that may well
 determine who succeeds Tito.
 Party executive committee secretary
 Stane Dolanc will be in charge of congress
 preparations and will head the highly im-
 portant subcommittee on cadre matters.
 This post will enable Dolanc to build a
 personal power  base in the party
 hierarchy.
 Another sensitive working group is to
 be headed by Jure Bilic, a nominal subor-
 dinate to Dolanc who in fact tries to un-
 dercut him at every opportunity. Bilic has
 responsibility for drafting both the new
 party statute and a document on party
 organizational matters. The latter assign-
 Page  3
 WEEKLY SUMMARY  4 Feb 77
 ment offers him a particularly good op-
 portunity to undermine his rival.
 The stage has thus been set for some
 stormy infighting before the congress
 meets next year.  Dolanc is clearly
 stronger than Bilic at this stage, but their
 new assignments might well force uncom-
 mitted party leaders to choose sides.
 Dolanc will be pressed to build a con-
 sensus behind himself or face political
 oblivion.
 The assignments appear to be a
 maneuver by Tito to force the party to set-
 tle on a successor without appearing to
 have made the choice himself. The
 84-year-old leader-who celebrates his
 40th year as head of the party this
 year-nevertheless still  is capable of
 engineering his own succession. He can
 now do so by standing back and merely
 resolving conflicts that occur over con-
 gress   pre arations.

 ECONOMY
 Sovii:t gross national product probably
 grew by about 4 percent in 1976, a mark-
 ed improvement over the 1975 rate of 2.3
 percent and equal to the average for the
 early I970s. Although the performance of
 Soviet _ndustry continued to be sluggish,
 agricultural output was up sharply over
 the previous year. Nevertheless, serious
 food shortages remained a feature of the
 USSR's economy and were surely a ma-
 jor concern to Soviet leaders.
 Analysis of statistics presented recently
 to the USSR Council of Ministers in-
 dicates i.hat farm output grew by almost 5
 percent last year, following a disastrous
 8.5-percent drop in 1975. A record grain
 crop of 224 million tons and a near-record
 cotton harvest of 8.3 million tons boosted
 crop production by over 20 percent and
 eased import demand. This was partly
 offset, however, by lower output of
 livestock products.
 Industrial output, on the other hand,
 apparently rose by less than 4 percent, the
 poorest showing by Soviet industry for the
 entire period since World War 11. A
 downturn in processed food production
 was the  principal cause,  although
 transportation tie-ups and fuel distribu-
 tion problems contributed.
 Despite a favorable performance in the
 energy  vectors, the growth rates in
 production of other industrial materials
 was a poor omen for acceleration of in-
 dustrial growth in the first half of this
 year. Metals, forest products, and con-
 struction materials grew at rates under 3
 percent, compared with averages of 4 to 5
 percent between 1971 and 1975.
 For the Soviet consumer, 1976 was the
 worst year for food shortages in more
 than a decade. Early in the year, meager
 food supplies were reported, principally in
 rural areas. By spring, shortages had
 spread to cities. The situation improved
 some during the summer, with the
 availability of fruits and vegetables, but
 meat supplies became tighter. Severe
 shortages of various food items are still
 common.
 A rapid expansion in exports, coupled
 with maintenance of the previous level of
 nongrain imports, allowed the USSR to
 cut its hard-currency trade deficit in 1976.
 Last year's deficit is estimated at nearly
 $5 billion, down from the record $6.4
 billion incurred in 1975.
 The Soviets were able to protect their
 hard-currency reserves only by rapidly in-
 creasing the country's debt. By the end of
 1976, net indebtedness rose to roughly $14
 billion, up $4 billion over the previous
 CANADA-BRAZIL
 Canadian Foreign Minister Jamieson's
 mid-January visit to Brazil appears to
 have laid a foundation for significantly ex-
 panded economic cooperation between
 the two countries. It also underscores the
 importance they both place on broadening
 their foreign contacts and thus reducing
 their dependence on the US.
 Major contracts were concluded es-
 tablishing joint ventures in the areas of
 transportation, petrochemicals, and
 minerals. A half-billion-dollar barter deal
 was also approved involving the exchange
 of Brazilian iron ore for Canadian coal.
 The two foreign ministers signed three
 major technical cooperation agreements
 covering a wide range of projects in-
 cluding  telecommunications,  data
 processing, education, agriculture, and
 science. One of the agreements calls for
 special "trilateral" arrangements
 providing technical assistance to third-
 party developing states, mostly in Africa
 and Latin America. Altogether, the two
 countries envisage increased cooperation
 in trade and technology amounting to

 had were mainly on economic subjects. In
 Lima, he signed six technical cooperation
 accords amounting to $10 million and an-
 nounced several new measures to promote
 bilateral  trade.
 ETHIOPIA-SUDAN
 Relations between Ethiopia and Sudan
 were jolted severely this week by
 Sudanese President Numayri's call on
 January 30 for all African states to sup-
 port  the  Eritrean  insurgents  fighting
 against Ethiopian rule. Sudan has long
 allowed its territory to be used to
 transport supplies sent: by other Arab
 donors to the Eritreans, but for some time
 Numayri had also tried to mediate the
 dispute.
 The change in Sudanese policy is
 probably due to a number of factors.
 Numayri wants good relations with
 several Arab nations that already support
 the insurgents. His relations with Ethiopia
 have been bad since last summer, in part
 because of his belief that Ethiopia's ruling
 military council, in league with Libya, is
 backing Sudanese dissidents.
 Many of these dissidents have been
 given refuge in Ethiopia, where they
 almost certainly continue to plot against
 Numayri. A strong anti-Sudanese speech
 by Ethiopian council chairman Teferi two
 days before Numayri's announcement
 was a clear indication that the Ethiopians
 have no intention of limiting the activities
 of the dissidents.
 Numayri also believes the Eritreans are
 likely to win their guerrilla war in the long
 run and may now see Sudanese support as
 a means of shortening the conflict, which
 has been going on for more than a decade.
 The council's position in Eritrea has, in
 fact, been eroding. Recent military set-
 backs have lowered morale and discipline
 among the central government's forces in
 the province; 'last month they sent a
 delegation to Addis Ababa demanding a
 negotiated settlement of the war. The
 government is again trying to begin talks
 with the insurgents, but the attempt is no
 more likely to succeed than previous ef-
 forts. The Eritreans still demand in-

 dependence as a  precondition to
 negotiations, and the council in Addis
 Ababa refuses to give in to this demand.
 Growing insurgency elsewhere in
 Ethiopia limits the council's ability to
 reinforce its troops in Eritrea. In Begem-
 dir Province-also adjoining Sudan-the
 government recently lost an important
 post to forces of the Ethiopian
 Democratic Union, which aims to
 overthrow the radical-dominated council
 and install a moderate government. The
 Union, whose leader visited Khartoum
 last month, apparently was aided by the
 Eritrean Liberation Front.
 In southeastern Ethiopia, insurgents
 supported by Somalia have seriously
 eroded the government's position in Bale
 Province and have been active in
 neighboring provinces as well.
 In Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian People's
 Revolutionary  Party,  an underground
 Marxist organization, is stepping up its
 activities. Last week, they included an at-
 tack on the USIS library. The party,
 which has support among students and
 workers, aims to oust the military and es-
 tablish   a   civilian   regime.

 Algerian-backed Polisario Front, which
 seeks independence for the former
 Spanish colony partitioned by Morocco
 and Mauritania last year. The Moroc-
 cans, faced with declining army morale,
 may have decided to sponsor guerrilla at-
 tacks of their own inside Algeria.
 SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa has completed a pilot
 uranium enrichment plant near Pretoria.
 The plant may now be operating and ap-
 proaching full capacity, after more than a
 year of technical difficulties.
 Statements by the South Africans have
 emphasized the effectiveness of a secret
 enrichment process they have developed.
 It is unclear, however, whether the
 statements reflect the actual technology of
 the pilot plant or instead represent South
 African expectations of future plant per-
 formance.
 If the claims are applicable to the pilot
 plant, the facility can be used to produce
 weapon-grade uranium. In continuous
 operation, the plant would be capable of
 enriching uranium far above the level re-
 quired for South Africa's nuclear power
 program. To reach weapon-grade enrich-
 ment levels, enriched uranium would be
 recycled through the plant. Enough
 weapon-grade uranium could probably be
 produced in a year to make several dozen
 nuclear devices.
 The enrichment plant may well be
 significantly less effective than the South
 African claims would indicate. It was
 built with emphasis on ease of construc-
 tion and minimal foreign involvement,
 using  unsophisticated  technology  and
 materials.
 As a result, the equipment installed
 may not be able to achieve enrichment
 levels comparable to those obtainable
 with laboratory equipment. In that case,
 the plant may be capable of producing
 only some 30 tons of slightly enriched
 uranium per year, enough to meet the
 refueling requirements of one large power
 reactor.
 South Africa plans to build a second
 enrichment plant with a much larger
 capacity, to be operational in the
 mid-1980s. It is seeking foreign invest-
 ment and more advanced technology for
 this project. If these plans are realized,
 South Africa will be able to supply up
 to 10 percent of reactor-grade uranium
 enrichment services expected to be sought
 by the noncommunist world by the mid-
 to-late 1980s

 CHINA
 Chinese leaders appear to be debating
 what portion of their budget to allocate to
 defense and how much to invest in
 developing the economy. The issue is a
 touchy one for recently installed Chair-
 man Hua Kuo-feng, who favors
 emphasizing economic development but
 cannot afford to offend many important
 military leaders.
 The question was moved to the fore in
 December with the publication of a 1956
 speech by Mao that emphatically called
 for gradually reducing "'military and ad-
 ministrative" costs and increasing invest-
 ment in economic development. Soon
 after the speech was published, the Can-
 ton Military Region explicitly agreed with
 the concept of giving first priority to
 economic development.. The other  10
 military regions have expressed general
 agreement with Mao's instruction but
 have yet to endorse it openly.
 On January 20, the National Defense
 Industry  Office-the principal body
 supervising  China's  defense  in-
 dustry-published an article that seems
 to agree with Mao's instruction. The ar-
 ticle also urges, however, that defense
 industry should be developed "as fast as
 possible."
 The article appears to be arguing that
 no rigid distinction should be drawn
 between rapid military modernization and
 economic development. Defense industry,
 it points out, stimulates economic
 development by making "new demands
 on other industries and on science and
 technology."
 There is also an important political
 message in the article. It implicitly ex-
 onerates  former vice premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping of leftist accusations that he
 took a "revisionist" line in implementing
 Chinese military policy during 1975.
 This is yet another indication that the
 way is being prepared for the rehabilita-
 tion of Teng a second time. With the
 allocation of resources probably becom-
 ing an increasingly difficult issue for the
 Chinese leadership, Teng's military con-
 nections and administrative talents may
 be needed by Hua and his supporters to
 strike a balance between military and
 nonmilitary spending.
 Some military leaders may be ap-
 prehensive that civilian planners will take
 Mao's 1956 dictum too literally and try to
 cut the military budget substantially.
 Moreover, the question of just where ad-
 justments should be made in defense spen-
 ding is bound to be a contentious issue
 within the military.
 INDIA
 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who
 appeared to be sailing toward a certain
 victory in the national election scheduled
 for next month, was abruptly confronted
 with a new, possibly serious complication
 this week. Several influential members of
 her Congress Party rebelled against her
 leadership and announced plans to form a
 new political grouping.
 Agriculture Minister Ram, a veteran
 cabinet member and the spokesman for
 India's "untouchables," resigned from
 both the party and the cabinet, charging
 that Gandhi is leading India toward
 despotism. Ram was joined by five others,
 including former chief ministers of the im-
 portant states of Uttar Pradesh and
 Orissa. A prominent member of the party
 in  West  Bengal reportedly  has also
 resigned. The rebels said they would
 coordinate efforts in the campaign with
 the existing noncommunist opposition
 parties.
 Gandhi, who survived a serious split in
 the party in 1969, enjoys substantial per-
 sonal  popularity  and  considerable
 political leverage as prime minister.
 Moreover, she retains control over a party
 organization that is active in almost every
 village. Still, the defections raise serious
 SECRET
 Page             7
 questions about Gandhi's chances in four
 states, including Uttar Pradesh, where
 she is from, and Bihar, Ram's home
 state. Together, the four states have
 about 40 percent of the seats in Par-
 liament.
 If Ram and the other defectors can re-
 tain the loyalty of their followers and if
 they can work out an election arrange-
 ment with the main opposition par-
 ties-most of which have joined together
 for the campaign-Congress Party can-
 didates will be threatened in many con-
 stituencies. In the past, Congress can-
 didates have frequently won elections with
 pluralities or small majorities.
 Gandhi apparently has already begun a
 strong counterattack against Ram,
 mobilizing a large number of leading
 members of the Congress Party to attack
 his decision. The committee that sets par-
 ty policy has unanimously criticized his
 resignation.
 NORTH KOREA-USSR
 North  Korean  Premier  Pak
 Song-chol's two-day visit to Moscow last
 week was the first by a high-ranking
 North Korean since 1972. There are no
 indications that he accomplished his
 probable main purpose-persuading the
 Soviets to increase their political,
 military, and economic support of North
 Korea.
 Soviet - North Korean relations have
 been cool in recent years. The USSR
 recognizes that Chinese influence is
 predominant in Pyongyang and sees its in-
 terests best served by maintaining the
 status quo on the Korean Peninsula.
 Soviet aid to North Korea has declined
 markedly since 1973.
 In speeches during Pak's visit, Premier
 Kosygin delivered pro forma reiterations
 of Soviet support for the withdrawal of all
 foreign troops from South Korea and for
 speeding "peaceful reunification" of the
 Koreas. He made no mention, however, of
 the recent proposal by Kim I1-song's
 regime for talks between the two Koreas

 or of its claim to be the only legitimate
 Korean government.
 No Soviet military personnel were iden-
 tified as taking part in the discussions
 with Pak's delegation, and it is unlikely
 that such new military aid was provided.
 The Soviets are probably aware that
 North Korea's armed forces already have
 a quantitative weapons advantage over
 those of the South and thus see no
 compelling  need  to  provide  Pyong-
 yang   with   additional              sophisticated
 equipment.
 Talks about economic and trade
 relations may have been somewhat more
 productive. A press release issued at the
 end of the visit said that the two sides had
 discus:;ed ways to expand economic and
 trade relations,  and a Soviet deputy
 minister was sent to Pyongyang for
 follow-up discussions shortly after Pak
 left Moscow. It is doubtful, however, that
 the USSR is offering North Korea any
 hard currency to help it with its current
 debt   problem  with  Western
 creditors-one of the  principal eco-
 nomic concerns of the North Koreans
 just now.
 The Pak visit failed to produce a Soviet
 invitation to North Korean President Kim
 II-song. Kim had been angling for a
 meeting with the Soviet leaders to balance
 his highly publicized trip to Peking in
 April 1975, but the Soviets put him off, in
 part be:ause of the negative impact such a
 visit wculd have on their relations with the
 US. In view of the passage of time, the
 Soviets  may calculate that the full
 protocol treatment given Premier Pak has
 reduced, if not eliminated, any need for a
 summit-level  meeting.
 AFGHANISTAN
 A constituent assembly chosen in a con-
 trolled election last month will soon ap-
 prove a new constitution for Afghanistan
 that wil formalize the concentration of
 power in President Daoud's hands. The
 assembly also will elect Daoud, who took
 over after a military coup in 1973, to a
 six-year term as president.
 The constitution establishes a strong
 executive, a weak legislature, a judiciary
 that may acquire limited independence,
 and a single political party headed by the
 president. The party will nominate all
 candidates for parliament and the
 presidency. Daoud is creating a "Party of
 National Revolution" that clearly will be
 responsive to him.
 Daoud will appoint the cabinet and one
 or more vice presidents and, during an in-
 itial transition period, will also have
 judicial and legislative powers. The parlia-
 ment, which is not to begin functioning
 until November 1979, will consider bills
 proposed by the government or the
 judiciary; whether it will be able to initiate
 legislation is unclear.
 Major decisions are to be ratified by the
 constituent assembly. The constitution es-
 tablishes the assembly as a permanent
 Page   8
 supreme  institution consisting of the
 parliament as well as senior government,
 military and party officials, provincial
 representatives, and persons appointed by
 the president.
 As long as Daoud remains in power, the
 legislative roles of both the parliament
 and the constituent assembly are likely to
 be limited to automatic approval of his
 decisions. The parliament will thus be
 even less influential than the elected
 legislatures brought into being by former
 King Zahir during the last years before he
 was overthrown by Daoud.
 The US embassy believes Daoud is
 nevertheless trying to create a framework
 in which the people could eventually have
 a greater voice in political affairs, but
 only when he decides the time is right. In
 the meantime, approval of the new con-
 stitution by the assembly will probably
 enhance the legitimacy of Daoud's rule in
 the  eyes  of  man    Af hans.

 Key developing nations are likely to seek an early test of
 US policy on North-South issues, and they may try to play on
 differences among the industrialized states to bring added
 pressure on the US.
 North-South Dialogue: New Strains Ahead
 The atmosphere of accommodation
 that eased  tensions in North-South
 relations after the Seventh Special Ses-
 sion of the UN in September 1975 is un-
 der serious challenge.
 Developments over the past several
 months have created political pressures
 within both camps that could lead to
 another round of confrontation. For the
 US, this could mean new strains in
 relations not only with key developing
 countries but also with West European
 allies and Japan. The developing coun-
 tries apparently intend to put US policy
 on North-South issues to an early test. A
 number of meetings that are scheduled
 this year will provide them with additional
 opportunities to put pressure on the US
 and its allies.
 Pressures fro nn the South
 The demands of developing countries
 have been specified many times since the
 first call for a "new international
 economic order" at the summit meeting
 of the nonaligned states in Algiers in
 September 1973. The demands cover vir-
 tually  all  aspects of international
 economic relations, but four areas of ma-
 jor contention with the industrialized
 countries are likely to be the focus of
 negotiations in 1977.
 The developing countries are demand-
 ing:
 . Establishment  of  formal
 mechanisms, under their control, that
 would guarantee and substantially in-
 crease the real prices of raw materials
 they export to the industrialized states.
 ? A greater say in review and recon-
 sideration of their official and com-
 mercial debt obligations. Some sup-
 port this objective reluctantly, but all
 support the demand that the debt
 burden of the poorest developing coun-
 tries be forgiven or delayed.
 ? Mandatory programs for the
 transfer of technology to them and im-
 proved access to  financing and
 markets in industrialized states for
 manufactured   goods   and   semi-
 processed raw materials.
 ? Allotment by the industrialized
 states of at least 0.7 percent of their
 gross national products for official
 development assistance by 1980.
 Last December, developing country
 participants in the Conference on Inter-
 national Economic Cooperation agreed to
 postpone  ministerial-level  negotiations
 until a new US administration had taken
 office. The review conference that had
 been scheduled to begin on December
 15 was to be an important test of prog-
 ress in the North-South dialogue be-
 tween the industrial and the develop-
 ing countries.
 Postponement of the review conference
 probably avoided a showdown over the
 developing countries' demands, especially
 their highly contentious insistence on
 debt relief. It also provided time for
 behind-the-scenes efforts to insulate
 CIEC from pressures by some members
 of the Organization of Petroleum Expor-
 ting Countries, notably Saudi Arabia, to
 link future oil price decisions, in part, to
 US concessions.
 Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, India,
 Indonesia, Zaire, and Zambia-all
 self-styled moderates in the North-South
 dialogue-have indicated that their sup-
 port for the postponement of the
 December conference was based, in part,
 on expectations that the new administra-
 tion will soften the US position on debt
 rescheduling and ask Congress for in-
 creased US contributions to the World
 Bank's soft loan facility.
 Such initiatives, these states argue, will
 be essential to the continuation of the
 CIEC and to the success of US diplomacy
 in the commodity consultations being
 carried out under the aegis of the UN
 Conference on Trade and Development.
 Progress in these areas will also affect
 such issues as law of the sea, the UN's in-
 ternational development strategy, reform
 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
 Trade, as well as discussions with key
 developing states such as Brazil and Iran
 on regulating the export of nuclear
 technology.
 The politically moderate developing
 countries in CIEC are under pressure to
 show other developing countries that
 negotiations with the industrial states can
 lead to the realization of at least some of
 their goals. Many of the countries that

 have tcted as moderating influences at
 CIEC and elsewhere may threaten to
 change their tactics if there are no early
 initiatives to break the impasse on the
 debt issue or to demonstrate "good faith"
 by  increasing official  development
 assistance  to  the  lending institutions
 preferr.d by developing countries.
 The developing countries will likely
 voice renewed skepticism about the US
 commitment to a North-South dialogue,
 and at least some will threaten to recon-
 sider their willingness to negotiate behind
 the setnes with the US and other in-
 dustria countries to reach compromises.
 At leas: initially, however, this is likely to
 be posturing aimed not at alienating the
 US or at breaking off the dialogue, but at
 getting the US more engaged in seeking
 mutually satisfactory compromises on
 North-South issues.
 Most developing countries-especially
 the more influential ones-believe that ac-
 tive US leadership is essential for progress
 on such key  issues as commodity
 agreements, debt relief, and the reform of
 international financial institutions, which
 will be high on the agenda of the
 North-South dialogue in 1977.
 Coming Meetings
 Calks will begin in Geneva on March 7
 on a proposed UNCTADfund to stabilize
 prices of* raw materials. The developing
 countries will view the initial stands of the
 industrialized states as a test of their
 willingness to negotiate. The UNCTAD
 talks cculd thus influence talks in the
 CIEC framework. At the same time, the
 scheduli.ig of the CIEC ministerial is cer-
 tain to depend on when the economic
 summit meeting of the major noncom-
 munist industrialized countries is held.
 A delay of the CIEC ministerial
 meeting until June would subject it to
 pressure from the OPEC oil ministers'
 conferen:e that will be held in early July.
 Additional pressures on US policy could
 also result if the UN General Assembly is
 called back into session. Delegates agreed
 last December not to adjourn as usual but
 to recess and then reconvene after the
 CIEC ministerial to evaluate progress in
 the North-South dialogue.
 An    unsatisfactory    CIEC
 ministerial-or its cancellation-would
 provide the poor countries with the oppor-
 tunity to raise North-South issues again
 in a highly politicized fashion in the UN
 General Assembly-a forum where the
 US and the industrialized states are at a
 distinct disadvantage.
 Pressures From the North
 (IS policy toward developing country
 demands will also be complicated by the
 likelihood of conflicting pressures in 1977
 from the West European states and Japan
 over how that policy is formulated and the
 shape it takes.
 These states are more dependent on the
 developing countries-as suppliers of raw
 materials and markets for exports-than
 is the US, and some groups in Europe and
 Japan argue that the US would have less
 to lose than they should a new confronta-
 tion between industrialized and develop-
 ing countries erupt. At the same time,
 however,  some  West German  and
 Japanese officials are concerned that the
 US may move too quickly to accept some
 of the  developing  country demands.
 They will exert pressure for close con-
 sultations.
 Many West Europeans argue that the
 industralized countries' policies must be
 developed cooperatively if their support is
 to he counted on, and they, as well as the
 Japanese, have been looking for early
 meetings with the new administration on
 these issues. The EC has been working on
 new positions for CIEC and the
 UN( FAD talks and will reportedly soon
 seek to involve the US in discussions on
 these proposals.
 Finding a common stand, however, is
 likely to he complicated by differences in
 regional and historic economic interests
 and relationships and by the differences in
 each of the industrialized states' percep-
 tions of its vulnerability to pressure from
 the developing countries.
 Some of the European states and the
 Japanese believe, I'or example, that they
 might face serious social and political dis-
 ruptions  should  a  new round  of
 North-South friction lead to uncertainties
 over raw materials supplies. The West
 Europeans face the additional burden of
 harmonizing policy among the nine
 members of the EC before they can begin
 to negotiate a common stand with the US
 and Japan.
 There are, however, many common
 points of'interest among the industrialized
 states; continued efforts to find a common
 response to developing country demands
 stem even more from this than from a
 recognition of the tactical disadvantages
 of disunity. Virtually all industrialized
 states agree that wholesale acceptance of
 the developing countries' demands would
 undermine the stability of existing
 economic and political systems.
 At the same time, most agree that to
 refuse to concede on any demands or to
 fail to put together a program ofaction on
 which most developing countries would
 find it possible to compromise could lead
 to a strong reaction by the developing
 countries and with it the possibility of ten-
 sion in relationships among the in-
 dustrialized states.
 Implications
 To date, most of the political tensions
 in  North-South  relations  have  been
 caused   by  the developing countries'
 search  for  bargaining leverage. Ever
 since the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo,
 the non-OPEC     developing  countries
 have  tried  unsuccessfully  to convert
 control  of raw  materials   into influ-
 ence over the industrial countries.
 Current indications are that a growing
 number of influential developing coun-
 tries believe their most potent leverage
 may now lie in exploiting the political
 divisions among the industrial countries
 on North-South issues. A key objective of
 this strategy  would be to intensify
 pressures from the industrialized states on
 the US to soften its opposition to some
 developing country demands.
 Unless tensions within both camps are
 checked, a new round of North-South
 confrontation  could  interfere  with
 attempts to address cooperatively such
 pressing global issues as energy shortages,
 food and population problems, and the
 performance of the world's economy.

 East Germany in recent weeks has hardened its attitude
 toward West Germany and the status of Berlin. The new stance,
 in part, reflects a belief by both the East Germans and their
 Soviet supporters that West German Chancellor Schmidt's ap-
 proach toward Ostpolitik is more negative than his
 predecessor's.
 East German sensitivity--and by exten-
 sion Soviet sensitivity as well-toward
 West Germany and Berlin has heightened
 recently. The East Germans have re-
 moved some of the few remaining sym-
 bols of the special status of East Berlin.
 Last week the Honecker regime struck out
 sharply against the West German govern-
 ment in a formal diplomatic note.
 Since the first of this year, the East
 Germans have taken several steps that in-
 dicate a hardening attitude. They include:
 ? Requiring entry visas to East
 Berlin for non-German third country
 nationals, excluding Allied personnel.
 ? Removal of border markers at the
 East Berlin - East German border,
 thus removing a symbolic reminder
 that East Berlin is not an integral part
 of East Germany.
 ? Temporarily turning back East
 German citizens attempting to visit the
 West German mission in East Berlin to
 obtain emigration visas.
 ? Occasionally refusing West Ger-
 mans and West Berliners entry into
 East Berlin.
 ? References in the party daily on
 January 13 to the formation of a ninth
 city district in East Berlin. This step
 could be used by East Germany as
 another  demonstration  of its
 "sovereignty" over East Berlin.
 ? Heightened polemics against
 West German leaders, including recent
 East Germany: A Harder Attitude
 personal criticism of Chancellor
 Schmidt and West Berlin Mayor
 Schuetz.
 On January 27, the East German
 government handed a toughly worded
 aide-memoire to the head of the West
 German permanent mission in East
 Berlin. The note criticized West Germany
 for presuming "to concern itself with the
 interests of East German citizens" and
 said East Germany expected Bonn to
 "desist immediately from any activity"
 interfering in East German domestic af-
 fairs. This is an implicit reference to the
 West German mission's counseling of
 East Germans who apply for exit visa
 applications.  The note added that
 cooperation could come only when West
 Germany recognizes that there are "two
 sovereign, mutually independent German
 states."

 NERVOUSNESS IN WEST GERMANY AND BERLIN
 Possible Motivations
 Several factors apparently  underlie
 these actions. Among them are concern
 about the impact on the populace of the
 emigration provisions of the        1975
 Iieliinki accords, and especially the re-
 cem surge in applications for exit visas.
 The regime is also unhappy over what it
 sees as a more negative attitude by the
 West German government toward East
 Gernany. This includes inertia in in-
 ter-German  movement  toward
 agreements, references by West German
 leadrs that could be interpreted as non-
 recognition  of East Germany's
 "sovereign" status, and the "meddling"
 role of the West German mission in East
 Berl: n.
 There are signs of Soviet concern about
 the unrest in East Germany, which the
 Soviets attribute in part to the impact of
 the Helsinki accords and in part to the ex-
 panded contacts between the two German
 states in recent years. These concerns may
 be behind Moscow's apparent approval of
 East German efforts to reduce visible
 signs of the special status of East Berlin.
 US embassy contacts in East Germany
 have hinted that the leadership is also an-
 noyed with West German Chancellor
 Schn- idt's failure to give clear-and
 tangible-signals that he wants better
 relations with East Germany.
 In removing some of the remaining
 overt signs of East Berlin's special status,
 the East Germans have been careful so far
 to nibble at gray areas of understandings
 on Berlin. Many of these measures are no
 doubt designed to impress the populace
 that the regime is indeed in sovereign con-
 trol over East Berlin. Nothing East Ger-
 many has done so far undermines the con-
 tinuing four-power status of the city.
 The Soviet Angle
 F as. German efforts to put pressure on
 West Ciermany almost certainly enjoy ac-
 tive support from the Soviets. For one
 thing, Moscow shares East Germany's
 Nerves are on edge in West Germany
 and West Berlin as a result of the re-
 cent series of unfriendly moves by the
 Soviet-supported East German
 regime of Erich Honecker. This week
 rumors were flying that action in-
 volving East German, and possibly
 even Soviet, troops might be pending.
 Feeding the rumors, in addition to
 the East German regime's crackdown
 on attempts by its civilians to
 emigrate and its recent efforts to
 erode the special status of East Berlin,
 was a call-up of some East German
 reservists. The call-up, in fact,
 appears to be a routine move un-
 related to any crisis situation,
 although it is being characterized as
 suspicion of the Schmidt government and
 believes that Schmidt lacks the commit-
 ment to Ostpolitik of his predecessor,
 Willy Brandt.
 The Soviets are suspicious, too, of West
 Germany's intentions toward West Berlin
 and the ideological inroads of the West in
 East Germany as a result of the expansion
 of contacts between the two Germanies.
 But Moscow is also concerned that the
 East Germans themselves have been mov-
 ing too close to the West Germans, par-
 ticularly in the economic sphere. For the
 Soviets, then, a period of some tension
 between the two Germanies might not be
 a had thing.
 The Soviets may, in addition, be using
 the East Germans to test the forbearance
 of the Western powers in a low-risk way.
 The evidence, however, suggests that the
 Soviets have not been the prime movers

 full-scale "mobilization" in some
 stories.
 Rumors about the purpose of the
 "mobilization" are varied. Some
 suggest that it has been necessitated
 by the prospect of serious disorder in
 East Germany, and others link it with
 possible action against Allied interests
 in West Berlin and particularly Allied
 access to the city.
 The "explanations" strain credibili-
 ty, although there is surely con-
 siderable unease in East Germany and
 some unofficial East German
 spokesmen have made threats about
 curtailing West German traffic
 present, the USSR has larger foreign
 policy objectives, so it seems likely that
 Moscow will want to keep the rising ten-
 sion between the two German states
 within bounds and to prevent another
 serious Berlin imbroglio.
 The Soviets would probably support the
 East Germans, however, in any steps they
 might take to keep contacts between the
 two Germanies under control. The op-
 tions available to the Honecker regime in-
 clude:
 ? Imposing some restrictions on
 travel to East Germany by West Ger-
 mans and West Berliners.
 ? Taking a tougher line toward East
 Germans desiring to emigrate.
 ? Pressing the Soviets for a stricter
 interpretation of the 1971 Quadripar-
 tite Agreement on Berlin.
 ? Increasing the mandatory curren-
 cy exchange rate for visitors to East
 Germany.
 ? Introducing visa requirements for
 West German citizens visiting East
 Berlin. This, however, would violate
 the 1972 East-West German transit
 agreement.

 The suppression over the years of black organizations that
 might have served as channels for peaceful pressure makes it
 virtually certain that rising black assertiveness will be expressed
 in increasingly violent action.
 South Africa: Continuing Racial Tensions
 The most extensive urban violence in
 South African history has subsided, but
 racial tensions remain appreciably higher
 than before the violence started last June
 in the black township of Soweto. Further-
 more, the day-to-day interaction between
 government authorities and urban blacks
 seems stuck in a pattern of confrontation
 that will be difficult to reverse.
 Indeed, the future seems sure to bring
 more, not less, violence: to South Africa,
 which  is increasingly exposed to the
 pressures of black nationalism. At least
 some of these pressures, and the black ac-
 tivism they have given rise to, might be
 finding a peaceful outlet had not the
 authorities, over the years, suppressed a
 wide range of organized activities among
 urban blacks that could have served to
 channel black action into nonviolence.
 Such suppressive tactics have radical-
 ized thousands of students and driven
 hundreds to take refuge abroad, where
 they may serve as recruits for foreign-
 based insurgent activities.
 For the first 15 years or so after the
 1948 electoral victory of the Afrikaners'
 National Party and its apartheid policy,
 active resistance to the system among
 blacks came mainly from communist-
 oriented organizations spawned by the
 white South African Communist Party,
 which was suppressed in 1950. The oldest
 of these, the African National Congress,
 has maintained ties through the years with
 the USSR. The Pan-Africanist Congress,
 which split off from the ANC in 1958, has
 looked primarily to China for support.
 In the early 1960s, the ANC, the PAC,
 and their covert action groups conducted
 set up offices in several African capitals.
 Each has received some support from the
 Organization of African Unity and main-
 tains guerrilla training bases in Tanzania.
 There is no evidence, however, that
 significant numbers of trained insurgents
 have returned to South Africa.
 As the police rooted out the com-
 munist-oriented organizations, students
 emerged as the most vocal opponents of
 the apartheid system. A separate national
 black student group came into existence
 in 1969, when a number of black student
 many small-scale acts of sabotage and
 violence. The PAC also took the lead in
 organizing mass violations of various
 apartheid rules, including the march in
 1960 that resulted in the "Sharpeville
 massacre"-the bloodiest single clash
 between police and blacks in South
 African history
 Groups Suppressed
 By the mid-sixties, both groups had
 been thoroughly suppressed inside South
 Africa, and their most active members
 were in either prison or exile. Both groups

 leaders  broke away  from  the
 predominantly white South African stu-
 dent union and founded the South African
 Students' Organization. Its leaders enun-
 ciated "black consciousness" as a non-
 violent  legal strategy for overcoming
 white supremacy.
 Organization Grows
 Within a few years, the South African
 Students' Organization  had  formed
 strong units at most of the universities for
 nonwhites and had also launched the
 South African Student Movement at the
 secondary level. Leaders of the student
 organizations were also instrumental in
 the formation of the Black  People's
 Convention, which is intended to develop
 solidarity among adult residents of the
 black townships.
 From its start, however, the "black
 consciousness" movement has reflected
 tension; between moderates, who have
 hoped i.o win a better deal for blacks by
 nonviolent action, and militants, who
 have tried to provoke police crackdowns
 that would radicalize the participants in
 protest actions.
 Police harassment has tended to tip the
 balance against the moderates. Although
 none of the "black consciousness" groups
 has  been  outlawed,  many  leading
 members have been arrested or "banned,"
 a system of personal restrictions amount-
 ing to virtual house arrest. By 1975, both
 the South African Students' Organization
 and the Black People's Convention had in
 effect gone underground.
 By early 1976, the only nonwhite urban
 organizations not subject to harassment
 were the authorized representative bodies
 of each nonwhite racial group-the urban
 Bantu council in each black township, the
 South African Indian Council in Durban,
 and the Colored Representative Council
 in Cape Town. Although these bodies
 have popularly elected as well as ap-
 pointed members, they can only submit
 recommendations to white administrative
 officials in the segregated residential
 areas.
 Page  14
 Since last June, sporadic urban rioting
 has occurred in the all-black residential
 areas outside Johannesburg,  Pretoria,
 Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and smaller
 cities, and in the colored (mixed blood)
 areas  near  Cape  Town.            By
 mid-September, after the outbreaks had
 subsided, the rioting had brought death to
 at least 300 blacks, 30 coloreds, and a few
 whites. Almost all of the rioting, arson,
 and other property damage was confined
 to the black or colored townships.
 Student Militancy
 The students who first clashed with
 police in Soweto last June were protesting
 the mandatory use of the Afrikaans
 language as a medium of instruction.
 Their march, like most of the subsequent
 student demonstrations, was intended to
 broaden participation in school boycotts.
 As the police increased their arrests of
 student militants and blacks suspected of
 encouraging the militants, demands for
 the release of the detainees became the
 basic motif of the protests. The students

 began calling for area-wide work stop-
 pages to show that all urban blacks sup-
 ported such demands and wanted basic
 changes  in  the government's  racial
 policies.
 The new tactic met with a measure of
 success, but also led to some violent
 clashes between students., who were trying
 to   impose  the work stoppages,  and
 migrant workers, who did not want their
 earnings interrupted. The most serious of
 these clashes, in Soweto last August,
 resulted in the worst bloodshed and most
 extensive property damage of the rioting
 period.
 The most successful work stoppage
 organized by the students occurred in the
 Johannesburg area in mid-September,
 when they sponsored a three-day strike in
 which at least 70 percent of the black in-
 dustrial workers in the metropolitan area
 participated. A call for a five-day general
 strike in early November, however, went
 largely unheeded after employers had
 made clear that all workers would be
 docked for absenteeism during the strike.
 Fresh Leadership
 Government spokesmen have asserted
 that the surge of student militancy was
 orchestrated by the foreign-based in-
 surgent organizations, presumably work-
 ing through the "black consciousness"
 groups inside South Africa.
 Emigre leaders of the African National
 Congress  and  the  Pan-Africanist
 Congress have made similar claims.
 Neither the authorities nor the emigres,
 however, have  presented convincing
 evidence of centralized direction or of
 significant support for the student
 militants  from  existing  black
 organizations.
 The protest actions that clearly re-
 quired concerted leadership-particularly
 the mid-September strike among black in-
 dustrial workers-have displayed the non-
 violent tactics of the "black con-
 sciousness" groups. It seems likely that
 the students who have played leading roles
 in such action since June had some earlier
 association with the student unions.
 The frequent skirmishing between
 students and police has shaped a new style
 of leadership-less cohesive than the stu-
 dent unions, but more flexible and
 resilient. The new leadership has
 demonstrated its existence, yet has largely
 evaded detection. The new student
 leadership may be more structured than it
 appears; it probably has organized sup-
 port within each black and colored
 township.
 Only one of the new local groups-the
 Soweto Students' Representative Coun-
 cil-has openly flaunted its militant
 leadership. Tsietsi Mashinini, the coun-
 cil's first president, told a journalist that
 he was on an "action committee" that
 organize  the protest against compulsory
 use of Afrikaans in June. By August,
 when Mashinini escaped to the UK, the
 council had emerged as the most promi-
 nent student group in Soweto.
 The council's elusive leadership, usually
 manifested through leaflets circulating in
 Soweto, appears to be taking setbacks in
 stride and asserting influence in whatever
 ways it can. Since August, the council has
 called for carefully prepared boycott ac-
 tions instead of mass demonstrations that
 draw police gunfire.
 The council's reputation as a "shadow
 Page         15
 government" came to a peak with the
 highly effective and largely nonviolent
 strike of black industrial workers in
 mid-September. The Soweto students had
 apparently not only mobilized their
 parents, but had also extended their in-
 fluence to other townships in the
 Johannesburg area.
 The negligible response to the council's
 strike call in November was a setback for
 the students. This was partially offset,
 however, by a positive response by
 Soweto residents to the council's calls for
 other boycotts. The government liquor
 stores   and   many   of   the
 "sheebeens"-illegal bars operated by
 blacks-have been closed since early
 November.  The near-total student
 boycott of year-end exams has also been
 attributed to the council.
 Police Crackdown
 Last June, the police arrested hundreds
 of participants in the first round of rioting
 in the Johannesburg area and began a
 roundup of activists in the "black con-
 sciousness" groups still at large. Through
 July, however, government leaders were
 receptive to prominent urban blacks who
 had stayed clear of dissident activity and
 were offering to mediate between the
 authorities and the thousands of newly
 militant students.
 In early July, an agreement to phase
 out Afrikaans as a language of instruction
 in the black schools was reached at a
 meeting between a cabinet minister and a
 delegation from the Soweto Bantu Coun-
 cil.
 The agreement seemed a psychological  25X1
 breakthrough and encouraged the forma-
 tion of such groups as the Black Parents'
 Association in Soweto, which sought a
 hearing for more grievances than the
 usually docile members of the Bantu
 council had seen fit to express.
 In early August, however, a second
 round of student demonstrations and
 rioting broke out in Soweto and spread to
 other localities. In response, government
 authorities not only broke off talks with
 the Soweto Bantu Council but also began
 arresting the leaders of the Black Parents'
 Association.

 Erom Soweto to other black townships
 across the country, the most extensive
 police roundups in South African history
 gathered momentum. In late August, the
 minister of justice and police acknowl-
 edged that some 800 "subversives" were
 under detention. The dragnet has been
 extended to teachers, social workers,
 clergymen, journalists,  and  others
 suspected of encouraging student militan-
 cy.
 Ever though the rioting has subsided
 since September, the silencing of actual or
 potential  agitators  continues.  In
 November, there was a marked increase
 in  orders prohibiting "banned"  in-
 dividuals from continuing activities that
 are lawful but disapproved of by the
 authorities.
 Among  the persons  "banned" in
 November, 27 were involved with black
 trade u lions. A few were union officials.
 [here io. no evidence that black unions had
 helped the student militants to stage the
 general strikes in the Johannesburg area.
 Others "banned" in November were
 whites engaged in such projects as a train-
 ing program for union officials in
 Johannesburg and a survey of wage
 scales.
 In early November, intensified police
 efforts to ferret out student militants in
 Soweto caused a sudden increase in the
 flow of black South African refugees to
 neighboring countries. By late November,
 at least 500 refugees from Soweto had
 arrived in Botswana and some 200 in
 Swaziland.
 Most of the refugees apparently had
 fled on the spur of the moment to evade
 police searches of their neighborhoods.
 Some told authorities in the host coun-
 tries  that they wanted to continue
 academic studies wherever they could find
 places, but many said they were deter-
 mined to get military training and return
 to South Africa as "freedom fighters."
 In Botswana, where authorities have
 allowed the rival South African insurgent
 organizations to conduct discreet
 recruiting, the African National Congress
 and the Pan-Africanist Congress are vy-
 ing for the allegiance of the newly arrived
 refugees. Each group reportedly has
 Page  16     WEEKLY SUMMARY 4 Feb 77
 recruited significant numbers of the
 refugees who claimed membership in one
 of the student unions.
 Outlook
 The flow of recruits for the foreign-
 based insurgent organizations will con-
 tinue as long as the South African govern-
 ment persists in its repressive tactics
 toward blacks striving for a nonviolent
 transformation of the apartheid system.
 Prime Minister Vorster has recently
 authorized some economic palliatives for
 black grievances, such as allowing
 residents of black townships to buy the
 homes they had been renting, but he has
 reasserted his determination to keep ur-
 ban blacks politically impotent.
 Many of the blacks who had been
 detained without trial for months were
 released in December. Some of them will
 surely go underground; others will join the
 refugees abroad.
 The increased flow of refugees may
 augment the foreign-trained guerrillas at
 the Tanzanian bases of the South African
 insurgent organizations, but it seems un-
 likely that the black states adjacent to
 South Africa will allow extensive cross-
 border  operations.  Even the militant
 leaders of Mozambique are wary of South
 Africa's superior economic leverage and
 military capabilities.
 As states farther north increase their
 backing of South African insurgency,
 however, mounting pan-African pressures
 will eventually compel the border states to
 permit passage of small guerrilla cadres.
 Even if incursions by guerrilla squads
 become frequent, it will be difficult for
 guerrillas to do serious damage to impor-
 tant military or industrial targets. On the
 other hand, even occasional instances of
 small-scale urban terrorism or sabotage
 would very likely trigger costly expan-
 sions of South Africa's economically
 burdensome security forces.
 Given the Afrikaner predisposition to
 lash out at any flicker of black revolt,
 small-scale insurgent strikes would be
 likely to draw sweeping repressive
 measures that would heighten already ex-
 plosive     racial     tensions.

 A debate among Argentines in and out of government over
 whether to reorder the structure of national authority mirrors
 their propensity for politics despite the junta's ban on political
 activity. The debate is likely to cause President Videla in-
 creasing problems.
 Argentines in and out of government
 are actively debating the question of
 whether the structure of national authori-
 ty should be altered; a number of substan-
 tive points on the matter have been raised
 in the press.
 To a large extent, the debate mirrors
 the irrepressible  tendency of the highly
 politicized Argentines to have their say
 despite government bans on political ac-
 tivity and discussion. There is, however,
 genuine concern that power should be
 wielded differently in succeeding phases of
 the "revolution." In addition, some see in
 the debate a chance to influence events in
 their own favor.
 The politics of Argentina, where formal
 institutions even in normal circumstances
 play only a secondary role, are generally
 played out in behind-the-scenes fashion.
 Thus, the debate is far from an irrelevant
 exercise, despite its lack of official sanc-
 tion. Many participants are military men
 or have contact with influential officers.
 Virtually all the current speculation
 presupposes the continuing existence of
 the three-man military junta, but it seems
 a foregone conclusion to most Argentines
 that the formal power structure will even-
 tually be modified. Debate centers on
 whether the presidency of Argentina, now
 held by army commander General Jorge
 Videla, should continue to be held by a
 member of the junta or should go to a
 fourth man.
 Many believe that the current structure,
 which has worked well during the period
 Argentina: Debate on Junta
 when the military was consolidating its
 authority, does not give the presidency the
 necessary power to direct longer term
 policies and plans. Some commentators
 have suggested that leaving the presidency
 within the junta actually worsens the
 potential  for crippling interservice
 rivalries.
 The particular facets of this administra-
 tion that are causing concern are its
 perceived lack of dynamism-at times
 outright clumsiness-and  President
 Videla's  mild,  some say indecisive,
 manner. To many, the junta seems to have
 "run out of steam." There has been no
 resolution of the most pressing political
 problem, the uncertain status of the
 powerful labor movement, despite fre-
 quent announcements that a new
 regulating law is about to be presented.
 Moreover, the statements of cabinet
 members have sometimes contradicted
 those of other top officials or have been at
 variance with subsequent policy. Hun-
 dreds of complicated, confusing directives
 are still being sorted out and interpreted.
 Because he eschews personal power and
 has advocated a relatively moderate line,
 President Videla seems to many inade-
 quate to the task of bringing order to this
 situation. The conciliatory approach he
 lieves is necessary to bring badly divided
 Argentines together is viewed by his de-
 tractors as weakness.
 All Argentine political sectors have a
 strong interest in the outcome of the
 debate, and politicians, journalists, un-
 ionists, and others are probably joining in
 Page  17
 as much to test and challenge the regime
 as to express real concern. The unions in
 particular see an opportunity to con-
 tribute to a weakening of the junta's
 power. Labor leaders, more than any
 other group, have been engaged in a test
 of wills with the junta and are seeking
 ways to demonstrate their strength.
 The debate is likely to cause increasing
 problems for Videla, chiefly because it
 appears to have the backing of at least
 some highly placed individuals in the
 government. Videla thus can hardly af-
 ford to continue ignoring the situation, as
 he has seemingly done so far.
 Within the regime, one of the men most
 likely to take a strong interest in effecting
 change is navy commander and junta
 member Admiral Massera. Another is
 Planning Minister General Diaz Bessone,
 who last year outmaneuvered Videla to
 engineer changes that gave him his
 cabinet post and placed him next in line
 for the presidency. Both are highly am-
 bitious and apparently regard Videla as
 politically vulnerable.
 The two will not necessarily be able
 easily to profit from the debate. Massera
 has tried in the past to unsettle the jun-
 ta-and Videla. The President, for all the
 complaints that are heard, continues to
 have substantial support in and out of the
 military. Moreover, any alliance between
 Massera and Diaz Bessone will be sorely
 tested by the inevitable rivalry between
 the two power-seekers.
 The debate and the machinations of
 men like the navy chief and planning

 minister will not necessarily undo the

 seems clear, however, that Videla will in-

 China: Oil Prospects
 C'iina's potential as an oil exporter has
 beer a subject of interest in noncom-
 munist industrialized countries since the
 Chinese made their first commercial sale
 of crude oil in 1973 during the Arab oil
 embargo. Some observers, assuming
 China has vast oil reserves and the finan-
 cial and technological means to exploit
 them, have seen it as a possible important
 source of crude. It is now clear that this is
 not ikely to be the case any time soon.
 Not even the Chinese know the size of
 their reserves. Scholars, oil companies,
 and the US Geological Survey generally
 agree that China's onshore oil reserves are
 comparable to the 39 billion barrels
 remaining in the US. It had been thought
 that China's continental shelf might be
 one of the world's largest oil and gas
 rose voirs, but this has not been borne out
 by tie offshore seismic studies conducted
 by Japanese and Western oil companies.
 The  most  optimistic estimates now
 suggest that China's offshore oil reserves
 are about the same as those on land.
 Beyond the question of reserves, there
 are severe financial and technological
 constraints that will limit the ability of the
 Chinese to increase their oil production
 and exports. For 26 years, the regime has
 force-fed the oil industry with funds and
 technical manpower. In response, produc-
 tion grew 20 percent or more annually un-
 til late 1975, much faster than the rest of
 Chinese industry.
 China will not be able to maintain such
 a growth rate. The most accessible
 reserves already are being exploited, and
 investment in other industries, especially
 coal and steel, can no longer be held back
 to free funds for oil. Trained manpower is
 spread thin just to operate existing in-
 dustry. Moreover, internal political con-
 flicts have discouraged the influx of
 foreign capital and technology needed for
 rapid development of offshore reserves.
 Production growth, in fact, already has
 slowed. According to an official an-
 nouncement, China's oil production in-
 creased 13 percent last year, down slightly
 from the I3.3-percent increase recorded in
 1975.  Domestic  oil consumption,
 meanwhile, has been growing rapidly, ac-
 counting for 23 percent of all primary
 energy consumed in 1976 compared with
 less than 10 percent 10 years ago.
 11' the Chinese were to succeed in
 boosting production growth to the earlier
 20-percent rate, the estimated reserves of
 20 billion barrels to 33 billion barrels in
 the north and northeast-the regions like-
 ly to supply the bulk of production in the
 short run-would be exhausted in  10
 years. If the growth rate were to drop to
 10 percent, expanding domestic demand
 might not be satisfied.
 Until mid-1975, the Chinese were plan-
 ning to export increasing amounts of oil.
 These  plans were nullified by buyer
 resistance from Japan-China's major
 customer-and domestic dissension over
 the policy of selling national resources to
 raise foreign exchange.
 At present, it appears that China
 probably will produce 2.4 million to 2.8
 million barrels per day by 1980. Most of
 this oil will be needed for domestic con-
 sumption; exports are likely to be only
 200,000 to 600,000 barrels per day. By the
 mid-1980s, domestic demand, which is ex-
 pected to expand steadily, will absorb
 total capacity unless possible deposits in
 western China or offshore are proved and
 exploited much more rapidly than ex-
 pected.
 Development of such reserves quickly
 may not be feasible without help from the
 international oil companies. Some foreign
 technology has been acquired through
 purchases of advanced equipment from
