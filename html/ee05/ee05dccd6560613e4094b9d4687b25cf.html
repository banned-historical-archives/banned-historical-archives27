 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM
 Communist China:   The Open Door Policy
 Introduction
 Viewed from almost any perspective, the sequence
 of events that began with Canada's recognition of Pe-
 king in mid-October and ended with last'week's vote
 on the China representation issue in the UN seems
 likely to prove a watershed in the development of
 Communist China's relations with the world at large.
 The successful conclusion of the long-drawn-out ne-
 gotiations in Stockholm was at once symbolic of a
 general trend and itself a powerful impetus toward
 further intensification of that trend. For unlike
 French recognition of Peking in 1964, Ottawa's re-
 cent move was clearly not an isolated act. Other
 states are already lining up at Peking's door. And
 that door now seems open, or at least ajar.  More-
 over, Canadian recognition of Peking, followed by
 that of Italy, almost certainly played a role in
 garnering for Communist China a plurality in the
 UN General Assembly in favor of the traditional "Al-
 banian" resolution calling for the admission of the
 mainland regime and the expulsion of the Nationalist
 Chinese from the world body.  Clearly Peking's for-
 mal position in the community of nations is under-
 going a change.   It is less clear, however, to what
 degree this formal change will be translated into
 real and fundamental changes in Communist China's
 foreign relationships or, indeed, to what extent
 these formal changes are the result of significant
 modifications that may have already occurred in Pe-
 king's foreign policy and to what extent the changes
 themselves are likely to induce modifications in
 the future.
 Note:   This memorandum was produced solely by CIA. It
 was prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence
 and coordinated with the Office of National Estimates.

 1.  Movement on the recognition issue alone
 is now occurring at a rate that would have seemed
 scarcely believable as recently as two years ago.
 Rome has followed Ottawa in concluding its extended
 negotiations on the question, and Italian diplomats
 indicated that the Canadian move made a rapid wind-up
 of the talks imperative. Austria has announced that
 it too expects to enter into negotiations leading
 to recognition, and the Belgian Government, which
 has toyed with the idea for some time, is obviously
 inclined to follow suit in short order. Luxembourg
 has indicated that it does not intend to be relegated
 to the end of the queue and will probably follow
 Belgium into talks with Peking. Although Belgium has
 some bilateral problems with mainland China, none of
 these nations has expressed any reservations concer-
 ning the recognition formula worked out with Ottawa,
 and as a result this series of talks, when they occur,
 should be relatively brief., In that case Portugal,
 Spain, Greece, Turkey, Ireland, and West Germany would
 be the only nations in Europe lacking formal diplomatic
 ties with Peking; of these West Germany is an impor-
 tant trading partner of Communist China.
 2.   In Africa, Equatorial Guinea's recognition
 of the mainland regime followed hard on the heels
 of that of Canada. Ethiopian probes on the possi-
 bility of establishing diplomatic relations have
 received a positive response from Peking, and nego-
 tiations should begin soon. It is hard to see how
 Libyan Premier Qaddafi, with his aspirations to
 play a major role among "progressive" Arab states,
 can expect to maintain relations with Taipei very
 much longer. Several other African states are likely
 to continue to recognize the Nationalist Chinese
 only if they are handsomely subsidized by Taiwan--and
 this must be balanced by the possibility that France
 may suggest to some of its former colonies that they
 move in the direction of Peking. In Latin America,
 Chilean Preside"c Allende has already announced that
 he plans to recognize Peking; when this occurs Peru

 SECRET
 and probably Bolivia might find it difficult not to
 follow suit. Should either or both recognize Communist
 China, still other South American countries could
 find themselves under pressure to move in the same
 direction. This list is by no means exclusive. In
 Lebanon the recognition question has again become
 a "hot" one in domestic politics; Mexico and perhaps
 some Caribbean states appear to be rethinking their
 China policy,
 In s ort,    a recogni.-
 ti.on snowball is rolling and may still be gaining
 momentum.
 3.   In the United Nations a similar situation
 prevails. The Important Question Resolution, requir-
 ing a two-thirds majority on the China representation
 was passed again this year, thus precluding an imme-
 diate substitution of Peking for Taipei in the world
 body. But the vote on this resolution was 66-52--down
 from last year's 71-48--and even this result was
 achieved only because a number of nations had made
 an early commitment to vote "yes." Several states
 are likely to be most reluctant to repeat this vote
 next year, since it appears to "frustrate the will of
 the majority"; some have already indicated that they
 expect to change their position. In fact, the use-
 fulness of the Important Question tactic is probably
 at an end. Moreover, as a result of the vote in favor
 of the Albanian resolution, psychological pressure
 for the admission of Communist China is almost certain
 to increase perceptibly in coming months. In fact,
 there is in New York virtually a universal feeling--
 shared by the US mission at the UN--that this is the
 last year that the present situation can be maintained.
 The Warming Trend
 4.  Moreover, the issue of China's "place in
 the world" is not confined simply to the twin ques-
 tions of "chirec" and "chirep," as the cable short-
 hand would have it. The bare announcement that Chou
 En-lai planned to visit Southern Yemen--at an un-
 specified date--led to the extraordinary spectacle

 earlier this autumn of a covey of nations in Europe
 and Africa all but lining up hat in hand in the hope
 that Chou would include their capitals in his itiner-
 ary.  Nor is this all. A wide array of states, most
 of which, while maintaining formal relations with
 Peking, have been to a greater or lesser degree
 estranged from Communist China in recent years, are
 now in the process of patching things up or cementing
 ties with the mainland regime. Relations with Hanoi,
 which had improved since the dark days after the
 start of the Paris talks, have clearly grown closer
 in the past six or seven months; those with Pyongyang,
 which certainly were very bad, have warmed remarkably
 in the past year. In Eastern Europe a parallel move-
 ment has taken place. All governments in the region
 except Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria have now received
 Chinese ambassadors after the hiatus of the Cultural
 Revolution, a steady stream of visitors from Romania
 continues to travel to Peking, and--most remarkably--
 Yugoslavia, long engaged in a violent slanging match
 with China, has not only exchanged ambassadors but
 is actively embarked on an effort to gain Peking the
 Chinese seat in the UN.
 5.  But the warming trend is not confined to
 socialist states. High-level delegations from Arab
 states--notably Sudan, Libya, and Southern Yemen--
 were so numerous in Peking last August that they
 were all but tripping over each other. Zambia, a
 terminus of the Chinese-engineered Tan Zam railroad,
 has improved its ties with Peking; Tanzania at the
 other end of the rail line, now relies exclusively
 on Chinese military advisers. France has dispatched
 two emissaries, one official and one unofficial, to
 Peking in the past few months, and President Pompidou
 is clearly exploring the possibilities of an active
 Far Eastern policy based on friendship with Communist
 China. Britain is repairing relations at a more
 cautious pace. A high-level foreign office official
 has just completed a visit to Peking--the first at
 this level in many years--and while no real break-
 through resulted, London did explore the possibility

 of mutually raising the level of diplomatic repre-
 sentation between the two countries to ambassadorial
 level. In addition, the Pope is planning a visit in
 early December to Hong Kong, where he is expected to
 make a conciliatory statement addressed to "all
 Chinese people."
 6.  Developments in South and Southeast Asia
 have been even more intriguing. Major movement in
 this area has focused on Burma. Ne Win has step by
 step fulfilled all Chinese "conditions" for improve-
 ment of relations between the two countries except
 for an unconditional public apology for the anti-
 Chinese riots of 1967, and has capped this pilgrimage
 to Canossa by dispatching an ambassador to Peking.
 Since taking office this autumn, Malaysian Premier
 Razak has made a number of conciliatory statements
 about the desirability of improving relations with
 China.
 India
 has discreetly explored the possity o                 restoring
 diplomatic representation between the two countries
 to the ambassadorial level.  The Philippines are
 apparently considering sending an "unofficial" trade
 delegation to China. Even the Thais have made some
 gestures toward Peking.                                                  25X1
 in ividual Thai ministers have sent persona  emis-
 saries to Peking to explore grounds for easing the
 present enmity between the two countries. Moreover,
 Foreign Minister Thanat has publicly expressed a
 desire for better relations with China. Of course,
 there is probably more smoke than fire in most of
 these gestures. The Indians and Thais, for example,
 can certainly have few illusions about the possibility
 of significant, early improvement of relations with
 China. The point is that each of these governments--
 and the Burmese as well--have felt it politic, and
 perhaps necessary, to make the gestures.

 Approved For Release 2008/02/12 : CIA-RDP85T00875RO01100090054-8
 7.  The causes of this warming trend, and of
 the changes on the recognition and representation
 issues, are not hard to find. Some are, of course,
 rooted in the immediate needs and concerns of indi-
 vidual governments, but four in particular have a wider
 application. The first is the generalized feeling that
 China, a "nation of over 700 million people" possess-
 ing an atomic capability, should be and indeed is
 entitled to play a significant role in the world
 community; artificially to exclude her from such a
 role is dangerous. This line of reasoning applies
 primarily to those states considering recognition
 or desirous of China's admission into the UN. This
 is a familiar argument, but it is not for that
 reason simply a rationalization. Indeed, it would
 be very hard to overestimate its weight in present
 circumstances, for it not only influences govern-
 ments themselves but is also persuasive to various
 pressure groups, particularly in Western Europe and
 Latin America, which in turn shape the environment
 in which governmental decisions are made. In fact,
 the sentiment that "China should be brought into the
 world community" has been in the process of crystal-
 lization for some time; the convulsions that accom-
 panied the Cultural Revolution in China blunted the
 feeling briefly but apparently it did no permanent
 damage, and as a semblance of order and tranquility
 has returned to the mainland a wide variety of govern-
 ments--the Burmese, the French, and the British, for
 example--have been quick to seize on signs of growing
 domestic stability as an indication that China was
 prepared to play a constructive role in world affairs.
 8.  A second factor is the familiar one that
 many want to climb on a bandwagon. Several states in
 Western Europe and to a lesser extent in Africa and
 Latin America believe that both the representation
 and recognition issues are on the verge of a consid-
 erable transformation, and none wants to be the last
 to "recognize realities."  Luxembourg is a case in
 point:  the government is afraid that it will soon

 SECRET
 be the only Benelux country that does not recognize
 Peking.  Of course this sentiment makes the likelihood
 of a breakthrough on these issues that much greater.
 A third factor is the desire of a good many states
 to make common cause with Communist China in dis-
 tancing themselves or fending off pressures from
 the superpowers--the United States or the Soviet
 Union or both.  This factor is clearly operative
 in the policies of North Korea, North Vietnam, the
 east European states, and France.  Finally, the
 countries of South and Southeast Asia are faced, as
 always, with the problem of dealing with their giant
 neighbor to the north.  The possibility at least exists
 that the US presence in the area will decline in the
 foreseeable future, and in these -ircumstances the
 possibility of some modus vivendi with Peking is an
 obvious one to explore.
 Chinese Initiatives
 9.  This general movement toward Peking is not
 taking place in a vacuum.   In most, but not in all,
 cases there have been reciprocal moves on the part of
 China, and in some instances it has been the Chinese
 themselves who have taken the first step.   Indeed, if
 states in Western Europe and elsewhere have exag-
 aerated the degree of domestic stability the mainland
 regime has achieved, they have been accurate in noting
 that changes are underway in Comm?inist China's foreign
 policies.  Some of these changes are obvious; some are
 more subtle.   In the first instance they seen designed
 to clear away the accumulated debris of past failures
 in Peking's foreign affairs, to put a, new face on
 things.  In this respect they frequently involve more
 a change in style than a mutation in the substance of
 policy.  With certain notable and significant excep-
 tions Peking is smiling at the world.   Indeed, this
 can literally be said to be true.  Mao Tse-tung's
 affability to foreign diplomats on the reviewing
 stand during the 1970 May Day parade set the foreign
 colony in Peking abuzz and caused raised eyebrows in
 chanceries around the world.

 10.  From the Chinese point of view, the first
 important step in creating a new international image
 has been to end the isolation, largely self-imposed,
 in which China found itself at the end of the Cultural
 Revolution. At the height of the "revolution" all
 but one of Peking's ambassadors stationed abroad
 were recalled and nearly all embassies largely denuded
 of lesser staff members. In the early summer of 1969
 diplomats began to return to the field. Some 28
 ambassadors are now in place, ad rumors circulating
 in Peking suggest that more will soon join them;
 junior diplomats are returning at a more rapid pace.
 Most of the emissaries being sent abroad are experi-
 enced diplomats with long tenure in the foreign
 ministry, and all have clearly been instructed to
 "circulate" and generally to appear amiable.
 have in fact engaged in fairly extensive convec.,;a-
 tions with such ostensible "enemies,' as Americans
 or Indians--occurrences that would have been incon-
 ceivable a few years ago--as well as with a spectrum
 of nationals in the host countries to which they are
 accredited. In addition, an impressive number of
 Chinese delegations--economic, cultural, and politi-
 cal--have travelled abroad in the past year, while
 China has played host to numerous foreign delegations,
 particularly from North Korea, North Vietnam, the
 Middle East, and Eastern Europe. A number of foreign
 political prisoners, particularly West European na-
 tionals, have recently been released in an obvious
 gesture of "good will."
 11.  This public posture has been complemented

 y the private remarks of Chinese officials

 nese nave stressed Peking's desire to have good
 relations with "everyone" and have taken pains to

 issues.  Occasionally the Chinese desire to emphasize
 the "open door" approach has been carried to re-
 markable lengths. The recent visit of the British

 initiative, but Chinese diplomats in Britain leaked
 to the press the suggestion that Peking had originally
 issued the invitation for the visit.
 12.  At the same time, Peking is pursuing an
 aspect of traditional, state-to-state diplomacy and
 economic aid on a scale greater than ever before.
 in addition to its major investment in the Tan-Zam
 railroad, China has since early summer extended aid
 to Pakistan, Sudan, Southern Yemen, and perhaps
 Congo  (Brazzaville). Thes3 commitments amount to
 more than half of all economic aid China has extended
 to less developed countries during the past 15 years.
 Additional aid agreements have also recently been
 signed with North Korea and North Vietnam, and Peking
 has in passing also doles: out small sums to Nepal,
 the Philippines, and Peru. The Peruvian and Philippine
 gestures, billed as earthquake relief and cyclone
 relief respectively, were made to countries with
 which China has no formal relations.
 13.   In keeping with this general approach,
 Chinese propaganda has for the most part been
 played in rather low key. Joint communiques marking
 the visits of foreign delegations, for example,
 have usually stressed coo0Aration and mutuality of
 interest, rather than revolutionary rhetoric. This
 relatively low-key propaganda line has been par-
 ticularly noticeable in connection with the Sino-
 Soviet dispute--recriminations against Moscow have
 been few and far between since the start of the
 talks in Peking--but other traditional whipping
 boys of the Chinese have also received relatively
 mild treatment in the past six months:  India is
 a case in point. In particular, attacks on national
 leaders such as Mrs. Gandhi, Burma's Ne Win, and
 Philippine president Marcos have virtually ceased.
 Although there have been exceptions to this rule--
 statements regarding Japan, the Middle East and the
 Indochina war, particularly in the wake of the US
 incursion into Cambodia, have remained bellicose--

 it seems clear that Peking wishes to avoid brandish-
 ing its revolutionary sword :;.n public too obstreper-
 ously.
 First Things First
 14.  All of these actions are, of course,
 primarily an effort to improve atmospherics. But
 even this effort has its limits. China does not
 appear anxious to clear away the rubble of past,
 outworn policies all at once. There are obvious
 shadings in this approach; some matters and some
 areas clearly have priority over others.   One
 high-priority item on the agenda is the campaign
 connected with China's seat in the UN; another area
 of obvious importance is the cementing of relations
 with the socialist states , both in Asia and in
 Eastern Europe. Improvement of relations with
 Western Europe also appears to rank relatively
 :sigh on the list; rel-itions with African and Mid-
 dle Eastern states may `ie of lesser importance.
 Closer to home, however, Peking seems prepared
 to move with great deliberation.
 15.  The case of Burma is instructive in this
 regard. As relations have gradually improved in the
 past seven months, the Burmese have consistently
 shown themselves to be eager for rapprochement, and
 the Chinese have equally consistently expressed
 reserve--but not complete disinterest. This policy
 has wrung the maximum conce ss4,ons from Ne Win:  re-
 lease of ethnic Chinese prisoners held by Burma, re-
 opening of trade with China at Burmese initiative,
 compensation of the victims of the anti-Chinese riots
 of 1967, and permission for the Chinese embassy to
 resume "cultural and organizational" activities among
 the Chinese population in Burma.   These are four out
 of the five long-standing Chinese "demands" or pre-
 conditions for improvement of relations; and Ne Win
 has partially fulfilled the fifth--public apology for
 the riots--with a statement that could be construed
 as a back-handed apology.  Nevertheless, Peking's
 eventual agreement to Burmese requests for an ex-
 change of ambassadors was merely verbal, rather than

 wr,' '-,ten , and in fact the Chinese have not reciprocated
 Rangoon's dispatch of an ambassador to China.  Nor have
 they given any sign that they would cease support for
 the Burmese Communist Party and other insurgent groups
 operating in Burma--No Win's cardinal aim in attempt-
 ing rapprochement.  The Chinese interest in all this
 was not only to extract from the Burmese whatever the
 traffic would bear but to make it crystal clear pub-
 licly that it was Rangoon that had moved toward
 China and not the reverse. Nevertheless, the Chinese
 have given something. Trade has been resumed, a new
 char&je of higher rank has arrived in Rangoon, and
 rumors are circulating that an ambassador will
 eventually be appointed,
 16.  This pattern is likely to be repeated at
 a still slower pace all along China's southern
 flank.  Tun Razak's public statements have not
 required a Chinese reply, and none has been forth-
 coming. Indian and Indonesian probes, which may
 well have been half-hearted in any event, have been
 fended off--both were apparently told "the time is
 not ripe"--but not rejected out of hand.   Thai ges-
 tures also require no reply, and movement in this
 area, if any, obviously depends on developments in
 Indochina. Indeed, this cautious approach has been
 used even further afield. Ethiopian overtures to the
 Chinese were initially parried, but after a hesitation
 of three months Chinese diplomats in Khartoum were
 instructed to begin negotiations leading to recognition.
 Peking clearly kept this particular card "in reserve,"
 to be played when advantageous to keep up momentum
 on the recognition question.
 17.  This cautious, fairly tough, but pragmatic
 and flexible line obviously costs Peking little and
 is generally in keeping with the more open, "reason-
 able" image the Chinese are attempting to create for
 themselves. Elsewhere in Asia, however, pragmatism
 has led in a somewhat different direction. Peking
 believes there is little chance the policies of the
 Japanese governments vis-a-vis China will change in

 the immediate future, and acting on this assumption
 the Chinese are conducting a propaganda campaign of
 vilification against the Sato government. China may
 hope that this campaign will marginally influence
 governments and peoples in Southeast Asia that are
 suspicious of Japanese motives and fearful of future
 Japanese expansionism. More to its purpose, however,
 Peking is clearly attempting to exploit such sus-
 picions and fears closer to home--specifically in
 North Korea. Indeed, the show of "solidarity" both
 countries have displayed in the past year has been
 largely constructed on an anti-Japanese--and anti-US---
 platform. Much the same is true with respect to
 Indochina. Here Chinese "revolutionary" militance,
 particularly in the wake of the US incursion into
 Cambodia, has emphasized common ground with North
 Vietnam. In both cases the gains have been immediate
 and real, and the costs have been minimal.
 18.   It should be recognized, however, that
 Peking is attempting to wean both Hanoi and Pyong-
 yang further from the Soviet Union and to draw them
 closer to China.   Insofar as this is possible, this
 aim has already been achieved; it is unlikely that
 the Chinese believe that either North Korea or North
 Vietnam is contemplating putting all its eggs in the
 Chinese basket.  Thus, in both cases this "hard-line"
 approach is unlikely to produce further significant
 gains.   Peking may well recognize this fact and may
 be tailoring its propaganda accordingly.  The volume
 of Chinese propaganda on the Indochina situation has
 dropped considerably in recent weeks; references to
 an Asian "anti-imperialist front"--a North Korean
 invention apparently adopted by Peking at Pyongyang's
 behest--have also become infrequent.  This is not to
 say that China is becoming dovish on these issues,
 particularly the Indochina war, but merely that
 these militant themes are no longer so prominent
 in the picture Peking paints of the world.   Indeed,
 there have always been light streaks in this somber
 picture. Trade with Japan has not been hampered by
 China's verbal posturing, and Japanese businessmen
 have had little difficulty circumventing Chou En-tai's

 "threat" of last spring that firms trading with Tai-
 wan could not trade with China. Moreover, statements
 by Chinese leaders suggest that Peking is far from
 willing to underwrite any North Korean "adventurism."
 Policy Changes
 19.   In many respects this rather mixed approach
 to the world--emphasis on bilateral relations with
 many nations, a cautious, tough but not wholly un-
 reasonable attitude toward outstanding differences
 with certain other states, militancy in areas where
 there is little prospect of accommodation--resembles
 Chinese foreign policy in the period preceding the
 Cultural Revolution. But the differences are even
 more striking than the similarities. The present
 shadowy "Asian anti-imperialist front" is a far
 cry from the "Peking-Pyongyang-Phnom Penh-Djakarta
 axis." Revolution in Africa and Latin America is in
 the back rather than the front seat. The dog fights
 with the Soviet Union in Communist front organizations
 have ceased. Accommodation has been mooted with a
 much wider range of nations, and the focus of this
 activity appears to have shifted to Europe from the
 third world. No attempt is being made to build a
 separate, exclusive UN of "anti-imperialist, pro-
 gressive" states.  In short, China no longer is
 trying to lead a "revolutionary," doctrinally pure
 world of its own, but seems bent on playing a part
 in the world as it exists.
 20.   In pursuing this end Peking has introduced
 into the mix of its foreign policies a number of
 specific changes quite separate from the general
 effort to improve atmospherics. The most obvious of
 -hese changes relates to its new attitude toward the
 UN. China now seems intent on assuming its "rightful
 place" in that body. The campaign to secure this place
 is being led by third parties--Algeria, Yugoslavia,
 and Romania--but it has been orchestrated from Peking.
 The Chinese have let it be known that they "really"
 want to enter the world body; they have also dis-
 creetly made it clear that the "preconditions" for

 UN entry enunciated by then foreign minister Chen I
 in 1965--revocation of the Korean War declarations
 condemning China, abolition of the UN Korean commis-
 sion, changes in the UN structure and the like--no
 longer apply.  Expulsion of the Nationalist Chinese
 remains the sole condition for entry.  Chinese in-
 ter:--at in the UN issue has been expressed in a va-
 rietyof concrete ways.  For example, the Chinese
 charge in London very recently informed foreign of-
 fice officials that in his "personal opinion" a
 negative British vote on the Important Question is-
 sue, coupled with a declaration on the Taiwan ques-
 tion paralleling the Canadian and Italian recognition
 formula (which is in itself a major retreat from the
 Chinese position taken at the start of negotiations
 with Ottawa and Rome in 1967) would permit diplomatic
 relations with London to be raised to the ambassadorial
 level--even if Britain failed to comply with long-
 standing Chinese demands to close its consulate on
 Taiwan.
 21.  A second area of change concerns China's
 relations with the Marxist-Leninist  splinter parties
 that sprang up around the world when the Sino-Soviet
 dispute surfaced. These squabbling, ineffective and
 often unreliable groups, particularly those in West-
 ern Europe and Latin America, are now being very
 lar ely written off by Peking. China
 has not renewe  its
 abortive attempt to capture international Communist
 front organizations from the Soviet Union.   For the
 most part this new policy is merely a cutting of
 losses. The attempt to establish Peking as the
 fourth Rome was quixotic at best; moreover, the
 "Marxist-Leninist" groups in Western Europe were
 frequently an embarrassment to  eking. But more
 importantly, the effort to draw a sharp international
 organizational line between Moscow and Peking led to

 SL,, C`121,'T`
 unno^cessary difficulties with the socialist states
 of Eastern Europe as well as with Hanoi and Pyongyang.
 22.  A third area of movement and charge is
 much more shadowy. This relates to the Chinese
 attitude toward possible negotiations in Laos. Pe-
 king has made no public statement regarding the
 Pathet Lao offer of talks with Prince Souvanna
 Phouma, but in private discussions with both West-
 ern diplomats and Laotians in Vientiane Chinese
 officials have indicated that Peking not only does
 not oppose such talks but actively looks with favor
 on them.  This, of course, is a far cry from the
 signs of public pique China displayed when the
 Paris talks first began.  This change of front
 may mean nothing more than that the Chinese are
 at this point more certain of attitudes and motives
 in Hanoi than they were in the summer of 1968, but
 it does raise questions regarding Peking's apparent
 commitment to the idea of "protracted war." For
 that matter, even the more bellicose Chinese state-
 ments on the subject of the war could be motivated
 by considerations apart from a simple desire to keep
 the fighting going.  For example, Chinese verbal
 militancy at the time of the Cambodian incursion
 may have been more related to tactics, that is, the
 problem of cementing relations with Hanoi, than with
 strategy, that is,  the Chinese reading of the overall
 situation in Indochina and in Southeast Asia in general.
 23.  Of course, even taken together these changes
 cannot be considered a radical reordering of Chinese
 foreign policy.  They do, however, represent a sig-
 nificant change of emphasis.  They are, moreover,
 substantive changes, something more than a welcoming
 smile.  Nevertheless, it might be noted that each of
 these changes has been made quietly:  none has re-
 quired a public statement by the Chinese--or indeed
 any major new commitment on their part.  Thus, should
 present policies fail or be abandoned, Peking can
 easily retreat without much loss of face. And perhaps
 equally important, Moscow would find   it   difficult to

 accuse the "anti-revisionists" of practicing a form
 of revision themselves.
 Peking's Motives
 24.  This sensitivity to the Soviet factor points
 to a major motive force in the shaping of current
 Chinese foreign policy. Indeed, the whole problem of
 relations with the Soviet Union appears to lie very
 near the center of Chinese thinking on questions of
 foreign policy at present. In this respect the
 clashes on the Ussuri River in the spring of 1969
 may have been something of a catalyst. They served to
 draw the attention of Chinese leaders in Peking from
 strictly domestic concerns to wider issues of foreign
 policy. The situation they confronted was not a re-
 assuring one.  Not only was China militarily inferior
 to the Soviet Union, but it was also diplomati(;ally
 isolated, partly as the result of the failure of the
 policies of the early 1960s and more importantly as
 a result of intense preoccupation with internal con-
 vulsions.   It was clear by the summer of 1969 that
 Moscow hoped not only to prolong that isolat, )n but
 if possible to deepen it through such device:  as
 Brezhnev's proposal for an "Asian collective security
 pact." The Chinese had set themselves the task of
 frustrating this aim.
 25.   Thus, the Chinese return to the interna-
 tional arena is designed, in the first instance, to
 counts Soviet attempts to perpetuate and if possible
 increase the self-imposed diplomatic isolation into
 which China had drifted during the Cultural Revolution.
 This relative isolation in itself made China vulnerable
 to Soviet pressures, and its termination was obviously
 to Peking's advantage. But in addition, more extensive
 and closer contacts abroad have probably allowed Pe-
 ki.ng to gain greater insight into Soviet intentions
 by assessing the views of third parties, while at the
 same time they have given China a wider forum in which
 to present its own case.

 26.  In most respects, then, Chinese policy is
 essentially defensive. In Africa and perhaps in Latin
 America Peking hopes to provide a counterweight to
 current or potential Soviet influence, and where
 possible to circumscribe it. In Western Europe the
 idea is to "build bridges," to gain a degree of
 leverage, and to demonstrate that China, as a great
 power, cannot be isolated. In South and Southeast
 Asia circumstances dictate a waiting game, but a
 diminution of Soviet influence and leverage in such
 countries as India is obviously a long-term goal.
 In Eastern Europe and the Middle East, however,
 Chinese policy, while strategically defensive, is
 tactically offensive. By cementing ties to the East
 European states Peking can demonstrate that Moscow
 cannot afford to concentrate on pressuring China
 while ignoring developments in its own back yard.
 The obvious mutuality of interest that exists be-
 tween China and certain of the East European states,
 particularly Romania and Yugoslavia, however, has in
 turn dictated some of the terms under which the duel
 with the Soviet Union is being conducted--at least
 insofar as cosmetics are concerned.  Thus, the dra-
 matic downplaying of polemics since the start of
 the Peking talks makes it easier for the East Euro-
 pean states--and for North Korea and North Vietnam--
 to seek common ground with Peking, since they are
 not being forced to choose one side or the other;
 as noted above, this factor was probably decisive
 in China's decision to set the Marxist-Leninist
 splinter "parties" adrift.
 27.  In t.'.ia Middle East Peking's aims are even
 more transparent:   to cause trouble for the Soviet
 Union (and secondarily for the United States) by
 outflanking Moscow on the left. In this area, as in
 Eastern Europe, the Soviets are,  from Peking's point
 of view, a status quo power. This fact has dictated
 China's tacti s, which have been to play on the fears
 of the fedayeen and the more radical Arab states
 that the Soviets might sell them out in the interests
 of accommodation with the US. This has required a

 hard propaganda line more reminiscent of Peking's
 fulminations against Japan and the Indochina war
 than the gentler approach used elsewhere, but in
 practice this hard line costs China little, since
 it is essentially an onlook::r in the Middle East.
 indeed, Chinese motives and tactics in this area
 are sometimes very graphically illustrated:   at the
 moment when Soviet diplomats were attempting to
 persuade Syria to accept the US-sponsored cease-fire
 early this autumn, Peking suddenly dispatched a
 delegation to Damascus, presumably to "buck up" the
 faltering Syrians.
 28.  The most dramatic event in this gradual
 process of reducing China's isolation, however, was
 the resumption of the Warsaw talks with the US last
 January. Although the Chinese were almost certainly
 interested in obtaining a reading on what the Nixon
 doctrine, with its implications for both Southeast
 Asia and Taiwan, would mean in practice, Peking's
 overriding concern in resuming the talks was un-
 questionably the effect that a renewal of the
 dialogue might 'lave on the triangular relationship
 between Moscow, Peking, and Washington. The Chinese
 hoped that the. Warsaw dialogues would heighten
 Moscow's nervousness and suspicion over the prospects
 of a China-US rapprochement, while, by appearing to
 hold out an olive branch, diminishing any desire in
 Washington to "gang up" with rloscow against China.
 Indeed, the idea of an understanding between the
 two "superpowers" regarding China seems  very real in
 Peking, if not elsewhere, and in fact some aspects
 of the relationship between the two--such as SALT--
 could be read as confirmation of Chinese fears.
 Nevertheless, the US incursion into Cambodia made
 it imperative, from the Chinese point of view, to
 suspend the highly visible talks--but not to break
 them off entirely. In fact, the immediate aftermath
 of the Cambodia operation produced a situation in
 which the Chinese saw the possibility of early and
 real gains, in terms of cementing relations with
 Hanoi and Pyongyang in an anti-American atmosphere,

 at the c pense of longer term and more problematic
 gains inherent in the Warsaw dialogue.
 29.  It has been, however, precisely since the
 suspension of the Warsaw talks that Peking has made
 the most rapid strides in improving its relations with
 other countries, not only with its Asian Communist
 neighbors but also in Europe. The oppressive sense
 of isolation obvious in Peking at the beginning of
 the year has consequently faded; and at the same time
 acri-aony between Washington and Moscow has appeared
 to increase, primarily over the Middle East problem,
 but also over a number of lesser issues. As a result
 a resumption of the talks probably has a lesser
 priority in Chinese eyes than it had last spring,
 when the discussions were suspended.  If it were
 possible, the Chinese leaders would probably prefer
 to keep both of the superpowers at arms length.
 Peking may therefore believe that it would be better
 to allow the talks in Warsaw to remain on ice while
 it pursues and consolidates further gains in Europe,
 Africa, and Latin America, thus placing China in a more
 advantageous position when the dialogue is resumed.
 Nevertheless, the strategic situation in which Peking
 finds itself vis-a-vis Moscow on the one hand and
 Washington on the other has not essentially changed,
 and the logic that led China to resume the talks in
 January is as valid as ever. Indeed, if it were to
 appear that Moscow could step up pressure on Peking
 as a result of easing tensions with the US in the
 Middle East or through progress in SALT,  the Chinese
 would probably be quite anxious to resume the Warsaw
 discussions.

 30.  If the Soviet problem remains at the cen-
 ter of Chinese foreign policy thinking, this need
 not mean that Peking does not see other benefits in
 pushing forward with its current "open door" campaign.
 As time goes on, these additional benefits may prove
 to be an end in themselves.  It is possible--even
 likely--that Peking has been somewhat startled by

 the range and depth of positive response to the
 relatively slight and frequently subtle changes in
 its foreign policy stance, but there can be no
 question that it sees in this response a means of
 asserting its long-standing claim to be a great power,
 with the privileges and prerogatives that go with this
 status. This cardinal aim of Chinese policy is of
 course of such importance to Peking that it hardly
 needs the goad of Soviet pressure to make it attractive.
 31.   In this respect the current movement on
 both the representation and recognition issues is
 mutually reinforcing. Canadian and Italian recogni-
 tion helped achieve a favorable vote on the "Albanian"
 resolution in the UN; that vote will probably increase
 the chances that additional states would consider
 recognizing Peking.   Given the number of states which
 are already considering this move, the Chinese prob-
 ably can, if they are willing to settle for the rec-
 ognition formula worked out with Rome and Ottawa,
 orchestrate and therefore reinforce the trend in this
 direction by maintaining a sense of momentum on the
 issue. This in turn, of course, makes a transformation
 of the representation issue  n the UN that much more
 likely, while at the same time it enhances the "legit-
 imacy" of the Peking regime at the expense of that
 on Taiwan.
 32.   In nurturing this trend Peking can be ex-
 pected to press very hard to counter widespread sen-
 timent for a "two Chinas" solution to the UN repre-
 sentation issue.   Its recent public and private
 statements suggest that it is extremely sensitive
 on this matter and that it may fei!r that some states
 presently supporting the "Albanian" resolution will
 line up in the future behind a resolution calling for
 the seating of both Peking and Taipei.   Indeed, not
 all nations favoring the admission of Peking to the
 UN necessarily wish to see Taipei expelled. A number
 of states now reconsidering their position on the
 .representation issue would probably favor a resolution
 adopting the principle of"universality"put forward
 at the Lusaka non-aligned conference last summer

 (which in practice would mean the admission of all
 the divided states, Germany, Vietnam and Korea, as
 well as both Chinas, with Peking represented in the
 Security Council)--particularly if the United States
 moves in this direction. Others might prefer to vote
 on the "Albanian" resolution clause by clause, voting
 up the admission of Peking but voting down expulsion
 of Taipei.
 33.   But any "solution" along these lines depends
 on the attitude of the two Chinese parties and, quite
 apart from Communist China's own adamant position on
 th,a question of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
 tLere are few if any indications that the government
 in Taipei would accept the "humiliatioi." of remaining
 in the UN along with the mainland regime. Indeed,
 should such a "solution" be adopted in the United
 Nations, Chiang Kai-shek might find the situation so
 distasteful that he would simply withdraw from the
 world body, thus paving the way for Peking's entry
 on its own terms; this in any event appears to be
 Chiang Kai-shek's present position. Yet, even if an
 impasse should develop on the "two Chinas" question,
 the present log-jam would have been broken, and
 pressures for the admission of Peking on the simple
 terms of the "Albanian" resolution--but without the
 cushioning effect of the Important Question motion--
 would hardly be likely to abate for long. Furthermore,
 "two Chinas" sentiment exists primarily among those
 states which either abstained or voted against the
 "Albanian" resolution this year, and this fact may
 help Peking protect its present plurality on the is-
 sue. In fact, no matter how this issue is approached,
 the moment when Peking will replace Taipei in all
 the organs of the UN may well be only a year or two
 away--barring the unlikely event of a drastic change
 in the policies of the Nationalist Chinese government.
 34.  Quite apart from the representation question,
 however, the ongoing series of recognitions of the
 mainland regime is bound to weaken and erode the
 international position of the government in Taipei.

 There is not a great deal the Nationalist Chinese
 can do about this, except to ask the US to apply the
 maximum pressure on governments considering recognition
 of Peking. Given the present momentum in the direction
 of Peking, this probably would not be overly effective,
 even if it were attempted. Nevertheless, this situation
 is not necessarily wholly favorable to Peking. As the
 rather frozen situation of the past 20 years thaws
 out, international sentiment has grown--and is likely
 to continue to grow--for a formal "two Chinas" solu-
 tion to the Taiwan problem.  Such a "solution" is
 hardly in Peking's interes':: the mainland regime is
 nearly as worried about the possibility of growth of
 the "Taiwan Independence Movement" as is the govern-
 ment in Taipei, and it is equally concerned about
 Japanese investment and interest in Taiwan. Nor does
 Peking appear to believe a "military solution" to the
 problem is possible; it is well aware that the US
 treaty with the Nationalists is still operative. In
 this sense, then, time is not necessarily on Peking's
 side.
 35.  Nevertheless, a "two Chinas" solution to
 the Taiwan issue is almost certain to founder on the
 opposition of the Nationalist government.  This op-
 position is not likely to fade even if Peking enters
 the UN and additional governments recognize the main-
 land regime . Indeed, the Nationalists claim to be the
 sole government of China provides the rationale by
 which the regime is able to maintain a monopoly of
 power on the island, and to relinquish that claim
 would be to invite the native Taiwanese to overturn
 or swamp the existing power structure.   In this
 respect, like that of the UN representative issue,
 then, the Nationalist government is in effect an
 ally of Peking:  its views on the "two Chinas" ap-
 proach to the Taiwan problem are indistinguishable
 from those of the mainland regime. For this reason the
 Chinese Communists probably do not believe it is
 necessary to press at once for a "solution" of the
 Taiwan issue. If time is not on their side, it is
 not wholly against them; and it may therefore be

 possible to allow the situation to "ripen" further
 as international support for the Nationalists slowly
 erodes.
 A New Bandung?
 36.  Although this may be a logical reading of
 the situation, it is nevertheless one fraught with
 dangers for Peking. From the mainland's point of
 view there are far too many imponderables involved:
 the US may apply great pressure on the Taipei gov-
 ernment to acquiesce to some sort of "two Chinas"
 formula; Chiang Kai-shek is now in his eighties, and
 when he dies his successors might possibly move away
 from the adamant positions he has staked out; either
 the US or Japan might encourage the Taiwan Independ-
 ence Movement even at the expense of the Nationalist
 government. In the UN overwhelming sentiment may
 develop for some kind of "two Chinas" formula, and
 the Nationalist government may not be so obliging
 as to withdraw at once. None of these possibilities
 can be entirely written off.  Moreover, Peking's re-
 cent political gains in the international arena, while
 going a long way to forestall Soviet attempts to iso-
 late Communist China, are by no means so spectacular
 that they neutralize the ever-present military threat
 from the north. Given these circumstances, it might
 seem fruitful deliberately to step up the pace of
 events, to stack the cards by making a series of
 highly visible conciliatory gestures that would
 "prove" Peking's reasonableness while further under-
 cutting opposition to the mainland regime. In other
 words, it might be useful, from Peking's point of
 view, to revive the "Bandung era" of the mid-1950s.
 37.  Although such a course may superficially
 seem quite attractive, it is almost certainly not
 in the cards. A great deal of water has gone under
 the bridge in the past 13 years, and a return to
 "Bandung" at this juncture would mean wholesale
 abandonment of a wide range of positions that China
 has staked out in the interim. Moreover, "Bandung
 diplomacy" was in part made possible by the alliance

 with Moscow, which of course was still operative in
 the mid-1950s. The military protection the Soviets
 supplied at that time gave Peking much more room to
 manuever than it has at present; in Mao Tse-tung's
 view China is now caught in a "nutcracker" between
 the Soviet Union and the US, and this makes the
 free-wheeling diplomacy of the "Bandung" period vir-
 tually impossible to duplicate.   Indeed, it, is all
 too obvious that a profession of amity to one and
 all--a hallmark of "Bandung diplomacy"--is simply
 a nonstarter while the threat from the north persists
 and the Indochina war drags on. Finally a full-
 fledged return to Bandung would imply at least a
 temporary end to Chinese support for "people's war."
 Although Peking has reduced the volume of its revo-
 lutionary rhetoric and continues to give relatively
 meager support to insurrectionary movements in South-
 east Asia (apart of course from the Indochina war.) ,
 much less in the Middle East or Africa, it has by no
 means abandoned such support entirely. in fact, the
 Chinese leaders probably view such aid as a means
 of keeping states on its southern border "honest"--
 either at present, in the case of Burma, or in the
 future, in the case of Thailand and perhaps Malaysia.
 38.  Indeed, as noted above, splashy public
 declarations of policy intent are precisely the sort
 of thing that Peking has avoided in the present
 diplomatic phase. This gives China a flexibility
 quite different from that of the Bandung era but
 perhaps just as useful:  relations with individual
 states can be improved or cemented fairly quietly
 and at a pace suitable to Peking, allowing the
 Chinese to extract the maximum possible advantage
 from any given situation. This careful attention to
 pace is another hallmark of Chinese policy at
 present; it permits Peking to defer difficult and
 sticky problems in bilateral relations until an
 advantageous moment while pushing forward in
 si -.:uati ons where the pickings are fairly easy.
 39.  The sticky problems remain, however, not
 only b!~!cause Peking hopes to deal with them when

 its leverage is greater, but also precisely because
 they are sticky. Such problems involve difficult
 ctioices, and these choices are probably the sort
 of thing the still unsettled leadership in Peking
 would prefer to avoid at present. What, for example,
 ought Poking to do if the Sato government in Japan
 shows signs of interest in exploring the possibility
 of establishing diplomatic relations? Should China
 discuss the border issue with India?  Is it worth-
 while exploring a settlement or easing of the Taiwan
 problem with the US? Above all, is any accommodation
 with the Soviet Union possible?  Some of these ques-
 tions may answer themselves if addressed, but as yet
 there is no sign that they have really been addressed
 in Peking.   Indeed, as the debris of past policy
 failures are finally cleared away, as China's in-
 ternational position becomes more "legitimized" and
 it gains at least some of the trappings of a "great
 power" it has so long desired, Peking will probably
 be faced with a set of problems it has been able to
 ignore while the log-;am of the past persisted.   In
 this respect, then, the more difficult decisions
 still lie ahead.
