 LEBANON: French Policy Concerns
 (Information as of 0100 EDT, 25 October 1983)
 President Mitterrand's trip to Beirut and statements by other
 French officials show resolve to keep French forces in Lebanon, but
 Paris will be reluctant to expand the scope or mission of its
 Multinational Force contingent.
 French Prime Minister Mauroy and Defense Minister Hernu have
 echoed Mitterrand's support for President Gemayel and his
 assurances that France will keep its peacekeeping force in Beirut.
 Only Foreign Minister Cheysson, who is often given to hasty and ill-
 considered remarks, has hinted that Paris might reconsider its policy.

 only political party calling for a pullout.
 of the terrorist attacks in Beirut.
 Both Italian Prime Minister Craxi and Defense Minister Spadolini
 have stated publicly that Rome will not withdraw its troops in the face
 in the proposed observation force in the Shuf region
 Spadolini did, however, indicate that Rome will await the results
 of the Lebanese reconciliation talks scheduled to begin next Monday
 before making a final decision on its long-term presence in Lebanon.
 The decision would include the possibility of participation with Greece
 Italian Foreign Minister Andreotti publicly cast doubt on Italian
 involvement in the truce observation force, saying that Italian troops
 should not be subjected to risks. According to press accounts, the
 Greek Government also indicated that it will reconsider its
 commi m n        observation force in light of the attacks Sunday.
 The UK, in a statement to the House of Commons by Foreign
 Secretary Howe, pledged to persevere in Lebanon. It is sending land
 forces commander General Kitson to Beirut for afirst-hand evaluation
 of the situation. The British have told the US Embassy in London that

 Comment: The French have followed a policy in Lebanon of

 Top Secret
 An expansion of the French force would undermine these goals,
 and increased French patrolling would not be likely to stop suicidal
 attacks. The French also are aware that the Syrians distrust them and
 would object to increased troop levels or operations outside the
 capital. For these reasons, the French would prefer to expand the role
 of the UN in the peacekeeping force rather than increase their own
 participation.
 Paris may conclude that the attack on its troops Sunday was not
 strictly related to Lebanon. If Iranian involvement is proved, the
 French are likely to interpret the bombing as retaliation for their
 increasingly overt support for Iraq. Paris also will hesitate to send
 more troops to Lebanon when French interests elsewhere, such as
 Iraq, are threatened
 Italy and the UK are unlikely to withdraw their contingents in the
 immediate future, because both countries would be sensitive to
 charges they have backed away from their commitments.
 Nevertheless, the Italian, British, and French Governments had
 previously been giving serious joint consideration to a reduction of
 their presence in Lebanon. Once the current crisis ebbs, they may
 begin again to discuss possible means-such as the introduction of a
 UN peacekeeping force-to extricate themselves from what they view
 as a hopeless situation.

 Jamaica's Manley Reacts
 The former Prime Minister of Jamaica and the leader of the
 opposition party there, Michael Manley, issued a strongly worded
 statement last week condemning the Grenadian Military Council. On
 behalf of his Socialist International-affiliated party, Manley severed
 relations with the Grenadian leadership's party and recommended
 that the Socialist International organization do so also.
 The Jamaican leader urged the international isolation of
 Grenada's new ruling regime, but warned against foreign intervention.
 According to Havana Radio, Manley has congratulated the Cub
 Government for its position of noninterference in the overthrow.
 Comment: Manley's tough stand against the Grenadian military
 regime reflects the personal revulsion of most regional leaders, but
 probably was designed also to increase his own image at home.
 Manley was closely aligned with Havana during his tenure as Prime
 Minister, and he is now attempting to play down his radical ties to
 improve his reelection prospects.

 Manley's close ties with President Castro suggest he may have
 consulted with the Cubans prior to his condemnation of the new
 Grenadian rulers. Although Havana has refrained from taking a
 similar position so far, Manley's stand probably will influence
 Havana's policy and make it more difficult for Cuba to come to
 Grenada's assistance.
 Soviet Statement
 The USSR charged yesterday that the US is "organizing broad
 armed interference in Grenadian affairs." A TASS commentator
 observer called this "an extremely dangerous venture" that menaced
 Latin American peace and could further worsen the international
 situation._The commentary said recent developments in Grenada
 were "strictly internal affairs." Moscow so far has avoided
 characterizing the new regime.

 USSR-EASTERN EUROPE: Nuclear Missile Deployments
 The Soviet Defense Ministry's announcement yesterday that
 preparations have begun for deploying "operational-tactical" missiles
 in East Germany and Czechoslovakia increases the probability that the
 Soviets plan to move SS-12/22 ballistic missiles, as well as SS-23s,
 into Eastern Europe as one response to the NATO INF deployments.
 The announcement, which was carried by TASS and Radio
 Moscow, said that an understanding had been reached with East
 Germany and Czechoslovakia and that work had started in those
 countries in preparation for the deployments. The East German
 National Defense Council and the Czechoslovak Government also
 made similar announcements. All of the announce            e
 measure as a response to the NATO preparations.
 Comment: Use of the term "operational-tactical" clearly
 indicates that the Soviets were referring to the SS-12/22 or the
 SS-23. The term would not apply to the SS-21-a "tactical" missile
 already fielded with more than half of the 19 Soviet divisions in East
 Germany.
 Deployment of the SS-23, which is designed to replace the
 Scud-Bs already in Eastern Europe, probably would not require the
 permission of the host country. Fielding the SS-12/22, however, might
 have required negotiation of a new agreement with East Germany and
 Czechoslovakia. This missile has an operational range of over 900
 kilometers and has never been deployed outside the USSR.
 A recent claim by sources in the Hungarian Foreign Ministry that
 their government persuaded the Soviets not to deploy new missiles
 on Hungarian soil as part of the countermeasures to NATO
 deployment also would be consistent with sending SS-12/22s to East
 Germany and Czechoslovakia, but not Hungary. Budapest is not likely
 to have objected to Moscow's already planned replacement of the
 short-range missiles with SS-21s or SS-23s, but it is plausible that
 Hungary persuaded the USSR not to field alonger-range system.
 Deployment of SS-12/22s in Eastern Europe would give the
 Soviets a program they could cancel as part of a settlement with the
 US. They could do so without affecting their future replacement of the
 Scud with the SS-23.

 PAKISTAN: Zia's Tough Stand
 Ton Secret
 President Zia reiterated on Saturday that he will not compromise
 with the opposition coalition which continues to sustain agitation in
 Zia, in a speech to the Federal Advisory Council, charged that the
 center-left Movement for the Restoration of Democracy is trying to
 seize the victory it cannot win at the polls and that the disturbances in
 Sind are the work of a small minority aided by foreign countries. Zia
 denied his talks with conservative and religious politicians are stalling
 The President also said he has not decided when to hold national
 elections or whether to permit the parties to participate. He added,
 however, that the concept of a ruling party and an opposition is
 contrary to Islam.
 Anti-Zia agitation remains centered in Sind, althou h no serious
 incidents have been re orted since Wednesda .
 Comment: Zia's hard line will be particularly disappointing to the
 Sindhis, and it almost certainly rules out an early end to the unrest.
 Although Zia has left open the possibility of compromise, his
 declaration that partisan politics is un-Islamic would appear to
 undercut negotiations. Even politicians on the right who seem more
 willing to compromise than those in the Movement for the Restoration
 of Democracv are likely to find the President's stance unacceptable.
 Zia's belief that India and the USSR are trying to exploit the
 unrest probably has increased his resolve not to give in to the
 opposition. Although educated Pakistanis will be skeptical of Zia's
 claim that outside forces are adding to the unrest, most Punjabis are
 likely to rally behind Zia in the face of Indian meddling.

 NETHERLANDS: Controversy Over Nuclear Weapons
 The Dutch cabinet continues to be split on how far to push NATO
 for a reduction in the Netherlands' nuclear roles, but Prime Minister
 Lubbers is trVinq to suppress dissent in the interest of Alliance unity.
 Defense Minister de Ruiter sought cabinet authority last week to
 make public his dissatisfaction with the report on nuclear reductions
 to be submitted to Alliance Defense Ministers tomorrow by the NATO,
 High-Level Group, according to the US Embassy. Lubbers overruled
 de Ruiter and noted that the report is a substantial move in the right
 direction.
 The report recommends that NATO reduce or eliminate atomic
 demolition munitions and the Nike-Hercules surface-to-air missile. In
 cabinet discussions earlier this year, Lubbers and Foreign Minister
 van den Broek had advocated the reduction of these two nuclear
 roles, and de Ruiter wanted these plus 8-inch nuclear artillery and
 nuclear depth charges to be eliminated for the Netherlands.
 Comment: Most Dutch politicians, including Lubbers, see
 reductions in nuclear tasks as a tradeoff for INF basing. De Ruiter has
 taken the strongest antinuclear stance within the cabinet, both on the
 reduction of Dutch nuclear roles and on INF. In p  li  h w v r h
 subordinates his views to the cabinet consensus.
 If de Ruiter comes to believe that the government is not seriously
 considering his opinions on what he sees as a "moral issue,"
 however, he might resign and become an active opponent of INF
 deployment. This could invite other Christian Democrats from the
 antinuclear left wing to defect from the coalition and jeopardize the
 prospects for final approval of INF basing.

 EC: Disagreement Over Industrial Policy
 West Germany's rejection of France's proposals for an EC-wide
 industrial policy that includes protectionist measures, indicates that
 future EC debate over this issue will become increasingly contentious.
 wan signs scan     emporary increases in   external tariffs on
 finished products, accompanied by greater constraints on using
 imported components in products assembled in the EC. The proposal
 reflects the emphasis in French policy on substantial government
 involvement in the development and direction of i
 acceptance of limited competition between firms.
 Chancellor Kohl expressed fears at the cabinet meeting that such
 attempts to close EC markets would aggravate current strains with
 the US over the Community's agricultural policy. Economics Minister
 Lambsdorff criticized the French plan as lust another way for Paris to
 get more money out of EC coffers.
 Comment: The West German cabinet debate reflects the growing
 interest in developing an industrial policy for the EC. Although it is
 rejecting the French proposal, Bonn has reacted more favorably to a
 British paper advocating a free market ao~roach to industrial policy
 and less reliance on EC funding
 The French believe that emerging West European high-
 technology industries-particularly their own-can compete only
 within a protected and regulated EC market sheltered from US and
 Japanese competition. Paris continues to push its EC partners to
 work out a common industrial policy, and it probably will intensify its
 efforts upon assuming the EC presidency in January 1984.

 CENTRAL AMERICA: Peace Negotiations
 Foreign Ministers of the Contadora nations-Mexico, Venezuela,
 Colombia, and Panama-have approved three draft treaties for
 submission to the Central American countries. Panamanian Foreign
 Minister Ortega says the ministers, during their meeting in Panama
 over the weekend, prepared preliminary versions of a general Central
 American pease treaty and of bilateral agreements between
 Nicaragua and Honduras and between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
 The Contadora Vice Foreign Ministers are to meet in Panama next
 week to revise the drafts based on Central American reactions and to
 work on three additional treaties on-reductions of arms, foreign
 military advisers, and military forces. The Contadora countries plan to
 call for a meeting with the Central Americans to take place next
 month during the OAS General Assembly session.
 Comment: Nicaragua probably will support the bilateral treaties,
 but it will insist that the additional agreements address the situation in
 EI Salvador. The other Central American countries are likely to resist
 bilateral agreements unless they are assured of verifiable multilateral
 arrangements to limit NlCaraQUa'S arms buildup and support for
 revolutionaries in the region.

 Special Analysis
 EUROPE: Prospects for Disarmament Conference
 Delegations from 35 European nations meet today in Helsinki to
 begin negotiations on procedure for the Conference on European
 Disarmament, which is scheduled to begin 17 January in Stockholm.
 As in the recently concluded CSCE meeting in Madrid, participants
 will negotiate as blocs-West, East, and neutral and nonaligned. None
 of the blocs evidently have coordinated positions on procedure. In
 addition, they have just begun to address seriously the confidence
 and security building measures, which are to be the basis of
 discussions in Stockholm. The Soviets and their allies almost certainly
 will exploit the Helsinki Conference to assail NATO's INF plans, and it
 may thus prove, difficult to settle ,procedural matters within the three-
 week deadline.
 CSCE participants agreed to hold the first phase of a European
 Disarmament Conference to negotiate confidence and security
 building measures that are "militarily significant, politically binding,
 and verifiable." Under this mandate, these measures would be
 applicable to the "whole of Europe"-as t               -including
 the portion of the USSR west of the Urals.
 No agreement was reached at the CSCE meeting on whether
 there would be a second stage that would address actual
 disarmament measures. The first phase presumably is to last until the
 next full CSCE review meeting in Vienna in November 1986.
 Each participant has general aims for the conference at
 Stockholm, but most have not yet developed specific objectives.
 According to the US Mission to NATO, the Allies have been meeting
 at all levels since late August. At the meeting last week of the North
 Atlantic Council, they again failed to agree on agenda, procedure, or
 public diplomacy strategy for Helsinki.
 NATO representatives met yesterday to try to resolve at least
 some outstanding differences. They just began to debate the US
 package of confidence and security building measures they will offer
 at Stockholm.
 Reports of neutral and nonaligned discussions show a similar lack
 of progress.

 Top Secret
 The Allies
 The Allies look to the US to take the lead in formulating the
 measures to serve as the basis of the West's position at Stockholm.
 At the same time, West Germany and particular)  France do not want
 the US to dominate Allied coordination.
 25X1
 Most of the Allies oppose any direct reference at Helsinki to the
 25X1
 measures the US recently presented for NATO discussion but would
 like the West to acknowledge that a second phase of the conference
 could lead to "disarmament negotiations." Moreover, the European
 Allies are working through the EC's framework for political
 cooperation to coordinate positions on the conference as they have
 coordinated policy on CSCE in the past.
 The smaller Allies also could be troublesome. Norway is attracted
 to measures on naval maneuvers that could complicate NATO
 activities.
 Greece is likely to voice its opposition to INF deployments. Turkey
 will demand that, if confidence and security building measures are
 extended to non-European territory of Turkey and the USSR, these
 measures also should cover sea and air areas. Both Athens and
 Ankara may use the conference to promote their positions on Cyprus.
 USSR and the East
 Given the imminence of NATO INF deployments, Moscow will try
 to exploit the nominally procedural Helsinki Conf
 West European public opinion on securit  issues.
 Soviet officials have told Western diplomats that Warsaw Pact
 initiatives contained in the Prague Communique of 5 January 1983-
 especially the proposal for a nonuse of force agreement with NATO-
 probably will be the basis of Eastern strategy in the European
 Disarmament Conference. The Prague initiatives included a proposal
 for the end of military alliances and a freeze on military budgets. In
 addition, Moscow might call for nondeplovment of nuclear weapons
 on the territories of nonnuclear states.

 Swedish Embassy officials in Moscow report that the Soviets plan
 to send a 40-man delegation to Helsinki-an unusually large group
 for procedural talks. The chief negotiator will be Oleg Grinevskiy, an
 "ambassador-at-large" with experience in the SALT talks and other
 arms negotiations.
 Grinevskiy's deputy will be Igor Andropov, the son of the Soviet
 leader. Other Soviet delegates have broad experience in SALT,
 MBFR, and other East-West arms talks.
 Neutral and Nonaligned Nations
 The conference offers the neutral and nonaligned nations their
 first opportunity to participate in a major arms control forum. Most
 want to foster detente and to serve as mediators between East and
 West.
 Many of these countries see the wisdom of limiting the conference
 to development of confidence and security building measures, but
 they also are drawn to Eastern declaratory measures-particularly
 those that would limit nuclear weapons. Sweden, for exa
 probably will push the idea of a Nordic nulcear-free zone.
 In addition, pro-Arab Yugoslavia may support measures to limit
 US use of European territory as a staging point for US troop
 movements toward the Middle East. Malta is likely to call for security
 measures covering the Mediterranean.
 Virtually all the Allied and neutral and nonaligned nations want to
 keep the Helsinki meeting as short as possible and confine it to
 procedural issues. Nonetheless, given the contending views of the
 participants on procedures and on the agenda, the preparatory
 conference will not have an easy time finishing its business in three
 weeks. Moreover, the level of East-West polemics is likely to be high
 as INF deployments approach and the Soviets threaten
 The size and composition of the Soviet delegation indicate that
 Moscow regards the Helsinki Conference as a valuable opportunity to
 appeal to West European public opinion on security issues. The
 Soviets and their allies probably will preview their substantive
 positions for Stockholm and will lobby neutral and nonaligned and
 other Western delegations to oppose US and NATO policies.
