DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
USSR: ahrushchev's final press conference on 18 May 
and the iThe being taken both publicly and privately by other 
Soviet spokesmen in Paris are designed to give the impres-
sion that while the Soviet premier, for the foreseeable future, 
will vigorously press his bitter anti-American campaign on 
the U-2 issue, he does not intend to make any sharp reversals 
In the other major lines of his foreign policy. Foreign Minis-
ter Gro:myko told British Foreign Secretary Lloyd 
0  that the USSR would take no action in the months im-
mediately ahead which would increase tensions or make trouble. 
*This point was echoed by Yuriy Zhukov, chairman of the 
State Committee for Foreign Cultural Relations, Khrushchev, 
Gromyko, and Zhukov all seemed to assume that negotiations 
on disarmament and a nuclear test ban would continue. Zhu-
kov indicated that Khrushchev had played "this one by ear," 
that even those in his own retinue did not know what he might 
do from one minute to the next, and that a central committee 
meeting and a subsequent bloc conference were virtual cer-
tainties (Page 1) 
*USSR: Mikoyan is slated for removal from the Soviet lead-
ership, according' to some of the rnmmliniRt enrrPsnondPnts  
now in Paris.  
 Mikoyan differed 
with Khrushchev over the latter's harsh reaction to the U-2 inci-
dent. An unconfirmed press report states that Mikoyan, who has 
not been identified in Moscow since 7 May, is "on holiday." The 
removal of the durable Armenian, who has played a large part in 
� the making of Soviet foreign policy--particularly in recent years 
would probably also mean the removal of a moderating influence 
on Khrushchev. (Page 3)

USSR-Iraq:araqi security services since 10 May have und r, 
taken intensive surveillance of the Soviet Embassy and homes of 
bloc diplomatic personnel] (While Moscow and Baghdad officially 
remain on good terms, the Iraqi ambassador to Moscow reportedly 
commented during a recent trip to Baghdad that the two countries 
are "not as close as they were a few months ago" and that Soviet 
it leaders are increasingly less well disposed toward Qasing These 
1 developments tend to substantiate the gradual decline in Iraqi-
Soviet relations marked by Qasim's refusal in February to license 
the orthodox Communist party, the failure of Mikoyan's April visit 
to produce significant results, and recent signs that Baghdad would 
like to improve relations with the West.

[I. ASIA-AFRICA 
India-USSR: [Nehru, en route home from the Commonwealth 
conference, on 16 May was reportedly considering a two-day visit 
to Moscow for talks with Khrushchev, probably around 26-27 May,  
before returning to India. Nehru  
had received letters from Khrushchev repeating an  
earlier invitation to come to Moscow as soon as possible and was 
awaiting further word before making final plans. Nehru, now in 
the UAR, probably has been badly shaken by developments at the 
summit. Any decision to go to Moscow now presumably, depends 
on his revised assessment of the situation and on whether he feels 
his personal intervention would help ease tensions:1  
Turkey: The prestige of Prime Minister Menderes is at an 
/ all-time low in Istanbul, and opposition elements there have gained 
a new sense of confidence. LTurkish security forces expect a large 
- demonstration in Ankara on 19 May, a Turkish youth and sports hol-
idayj Page 5) 
South Africa: The South African Government apparently intends 
to maintain its present authoritarian policy, despite mounting crit-
icism within the country's white community. In parliament on 16 
May, Justice Minister Erasmus refused to yield to .vociferous oppo-
sition demands that the seven-week-old state of emergency be lifted, 
stating that the emergency regulations must remain in force at least

British-controlled territories are returned to the Union. The 
American Embassy in Cape Town notes an increasing govern-

agitation. (Page 6) 
New Zealand:[Prime Minister Nash's 13 May statement 
that The' Commonwealth conference in London generally recog-
nized "the early need for Chinese participation in disarmament 
measures" suggests that he may be contemplating recognition o 
Communist China, partly to fulfill a pledge of the Labor party 
1957 platform, before the next elections in November. Nash, 
however, would presumably seek some prior consultation with 
New Zealand's principal allies, inasmuch as he considers recog-
nition a question of timing, and would seek to avoid any timing 
damaging to Western prestigej

South Vietnam: Ellie Diem regime, while outwardly ignoring 
the miiCE:Fth"ITEWed "manifesto" for democratic reforms issued 
� in Saigon recently by a group of former officials, is maneuvering 
to head off more serious criticism. The government is taking pains 
to retain the loyalty of student elements, and has instigated a smear

1Chrushchey's Post- urrilnit Policy 
[Khrushchev's 18 May press conference suggests that he 
will vigorously press his bitter anti-American campaign in 
an attempt to brand the United States as responsible for pre-
venting a summit meeting. Moscow has already requested an 
urgent meeting of the UN Security Council and will probably 
also keep the issue alive with the trial of the American pilot.] 
CHowever, Ithrushchey's extemporaneous remarks on 
other East-West issues  tncrethpr with thp linP takAn by For-
eign Minister Gromyko 
are designed to give the impression that 
Moscow does not intend to make any sharp reversals in the 
other major lines of its foreign policy. Both Khrushchev and 
Gromyko dealt with the disarmament and nuclear test ban con-
ferences in a manner which implied that they expected the nego-
tiations to continue. Khrushchev warned, however, that the 
USSR would resume nuclear testing if the United States did so 
and that Moscow would not tolerate "procrastination" on dis-
armamentp 
LIn response to Lloyd's questioning, Gromyko stated that 
the USSR intended no action to increase tensions or make 
trouble during the six- to eight-month interval proposed by 
Khrushchev before another summit. He avoided a direct an-
swer as to whether Khrushchev would sign a separate peace 
treaty during his visit to Berlin, and repeated the standard 
Soviet position that, if no agreement were reached, Moscow 
would be forced to sign a separate treaty. Khrushchev took 
a similar position in his press conference, but he warned that 
the USSR had almost reached the "limits" of its effort to con-
clude a treaty with both Germanys and that, when this point 
was reached, the treaty would be signed and announced to 
the world_03 
C..Yuriy Zhukov, Soviet cultural relations leader, con-
firmed the general line taken by Khrushchev and Gromykofy

Lon future Soviet policy, saying that "neither side would wish 
to push tension to a point which would make a later meeting 
impossible," and that the disarmament and test-ban confer-
ences and the cultural exchange program should "go forward6 
L:Zhukov said the�USSR had felt even before the U-2 inci-
dent that the Americans were reneging on "previously given 
assurances of a desire to achieve a mutually satisfactory 
Berlin settlement." fie maintained that in the U-2 incident 
the USSR had given the United States "several possible outs" 
but American statements closed these "escape batches" one 
by one!) 
Both Zhukov and a Pravda. correspondent expressed doubt 
that e USSR now would act unilaterally on Berlin, but Zhukov 
added, "I'm not a gypsy." Zhukov gave the impression that 
the USSR had been led to expect greater flexibility in the US 
position in Berlin.]

Mikoyares Status in Doubt 
Communist correspondents in Paris are saying that 
Mikoyan will be the "next man to leave the Communist hier-
archy in the SnviPt Urrinn " seenrcling tn a Weatprn npwa  
source.  
Mikoyan had criticized Khru-
shchev for overplaying the U-2 incident. 
  according to some information" ivnicoya.n 
told Khrushchev that the limits of exploitation of the inci-
denthad been reached� and that he should moderate his of-
fensive tone in order to preserve the fruits of the success.-
ful initial handling. "it 
is said" that Mikoyan had criticized 1Chrushchev's harsh ac-
tion in the affair. 
Mikoyan apparently was absent from Moscow during the 
week preceding the opening of the summit conference, prob-
ably the most critical period in the formulation of Soviet 
policy on the U-2 incident and the summit conference. He 
attended the Supreme Soviet session which ended on 7 May, 
but was not present at the 9 May celebration marking the 
anniversary of the defeat of Germany, nor, was he on hand 
for Khrushchev's departure for Paris on 14 May. All other 
full members of the party presidium were present for both 
events. One Western news service, in an unconfirmed dis-
patch datelined Moscow, 14 May, stated that Mikoyan was 
"on holiday." 
Mikoyan, who has been primarily concerned with Soviet 
foreign relations for several years, has long seemed to be 
the most "Western-oriented" member of the Soviet regime. 
His relationship with Khrushchev, which was especially 
close, was apparently based on mutual respect and similar-
ity of views. The removal of Mikoyan, heretofore one of the 
most durable of the Soviet leaders, would also remove one of  
the strong moderating influences on Khrushchev.

Soviet= Iraqi Relations  Continue Slow Decline  
[The USSR and Iraq are "not as close as they were a few 
months ago" and Soviet leaders are increasingly less well dis-
posed toward Qasim,  
  This 
conclusion is in line with growing signs that while Moscow and 
Baghdad remain officially on good terms an-a bloc aid programs 
have not been affected, relations have slowly declined as a re-
sult of the Qasim regime's moves against Iraq's Communists and 
indications that Baghdad would like to improve its ties with the 
West. The visit to Iraq of First Deputy Premier Mikoyan in 
early April failed to counter these trends. 
Moscow is particularly irritated over Qasim's efforts to split 
Communist ranks by his continued backing of a splinter group 
which was licensed in February as the "Communist party of Iraq." 
This group, which is having difficulty in developing even a rudi-
mentary political machine, was recently given a six-month ex-
tension to fulfill Iraqi legal requirements for calling a party con-
vention. The Qasim government has also continued to refuse to 
give recognition to the Moscow-backed Communists as a legal 
party. 
Soviet annoyance with Qasim has been reflected as 
in March when a quasi-official lecturer. in Moscow censured the 
Iraqi leader for "using" the Communists, but the Soviet press and 
radio have withheld open criticism. 
ion the Iraqi side, Qasim's growing suspicion of bloc activ-
ities is shown in intensive surveillance by Iraqi security service 
starting 10 May of the Soviet Embassy and the homes of bloc diplo-
matic personneD During the past few weeks Qasim has placed anti-
Communist officers in command of several air force squadrons, and 
the influence of the pro-Communist commander of the air force, 
Brig. Jalal al-Awqati, has been curtailed. Baghdad has also re-
cently allowed two anti-Communist papers, which had been previ-
ously closed down, to resume publication.  Both are strenuously 
attacking Communists.

Turkish Internal Situation 
The prestige of Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' regime 
is reported at an all-time low in Istanbul, and articulate opin-
ion now is described as "universally anti-Menderes." Opposi-
tion elements in the Republican People's party (RPP), the press, 
and the universities, according to the American consul general 
in Istanbul, are confident of their ability to resist and ultimate-
ly defeat the government. 
CA_ large-scale demonstration reportedly is planned for Ankara 
on 19 May, the Turkish youth and sports holiday, but otherwisej 
the country remains relatively quiet. The next move appears up 
to the government; the RPP continues its recently adopted posi-
tion of 'watchful waiting. 
Meanwhile, business is reported at a standstill in Istanbul, 
with businessmen uncertain about the future and general services 
totally dependent on continuation of martial law. The city's re-
turn to normal police control, the reopening of the universities, 
or the re-establishment of a relatively free press would result 
In new and probably more violent disorders, according to the 
consul general. 
The army on the surface is maintaining its traditional role 
of aloofness from internal politics, but there are increasingly 
frequent reports of intervention by senior army officers to 
restrain the police or government from excessively repressive 
measures. Many junior and middle-grade army officers, de-
scribed as economically dissatisfied. are believed sympathetic 
to the opposition.

The South African Government apparently intends to main-
tain its present authoritarian policy, despite mounting criticism 
within the country's white community. In parliament on 16 May, 
Justice Minister Erasmus refused to yield to vociferous opposi-
tion demands that the seven-week-old state of emergency be 
lifted. He said that 157 Communists were behind the recent dis-
turbances and that 20 of these leaders had escaped to neighboring 
British-controlled territories. He said that the emergency regu-
lations would remain in effect at least until the agitators were re-
turned to the Union for trial. 
Conservative members of the ruling Nationalist party have 
renewed their campaign to establish closer control over the op-
position press. A leading Nationalist member of parliament 
warned on 16 May that the government "will have to be prepared 
either to close down newspapers or at least summon those re-
sponsible for them and tell them what is expected of them?' This 
statement brought an immediate denial from Interior Minister 
Naude, a relatively moderate Nationalist. 
Although Prime Minister Verwoerd may move to moderate 
some of the harsher aspects of apartheid when he resumes lead-
ership of the government, the Nationalists have shown no indica-
tion of letting up in their drive to suppress the "agitators and 
gangsters" whom they consider responsible for the riots last 
March. Since conservative Nationalists usually characterize 
the opposition press and relatively liberal political parties as 
"agitators," pressure on these groups may be increased. In ad-
dition, the American Embassy in Cape Town notes an increasing 
tendency�typified by Erasmus' 16 May statement�to blame the 
recent disturbances on Communist agitation.

New Zealand Prime knister Possibly Considering Recognition  
Of Red China  
[New Zealand Prime Minister Nash's 13 May statement that 
the Commonwealth conference in London generally recognized 
the need for Communist China's participation in disarmament 
measures suggests that he may plan, before New Zealand's na-
tional election in November, to fulfill a pledge in the Labor 
party's 1957 platform to recognize the Peiping regime. He 
stated that the policy of keeping China "at arms length is one 
of diminishing returns and may not be in the best interests of 
our peace and security.... 
Nash may feel that such a move would lessen current East-
West tensions, at least in the disarmament field. During his 
visit to the USSR in April, Nash praised Khrushchev's disarma-
ment policies, and his generally laudatory comments on the 
Soviet internal situation raised considerable speculation in 
Wellington that he might follow up his trip with a policy shift 
toward ,Peiping:j 
/Although there is comparatively little opposition in New 
Zealand toward either recognition of Communist China or its 
admission to the UN, Nash has justified postponement of the 
move as a question of timing and in deference to the United 
States' position. Responsible New Zealand officials have re-
peatedly asserted that Nash would take no steps without prior 
consultation with New Zealand's principal allies, and the prime 
minister presumably wcluld be reluctant to take action damag-
ing Western prestige following upon the collapse of the summit 
conferencej

South Vi 20etnam vetnment Maneuvetts-Against Local Critics  
ahe Diem regime, despite a show of unconcern, realizes 
that the much-publicized "manifesto" for democratic reforms 
issued in Saigon last month by a group of former officials and 
civic leaders could lead to more serious criticism. The gov-
ernment accordingly is taking immediate steps to bolster its 
prestige, while seeking to stigmatize its critics before popu-
lar opinion. Thus far, however, the widespread public dis-
content over the government's authoritarian excesses has 
taken no organized forinj 
With the recent events in South Korea in mind, the govern-
ment is turning particular attention to student elements, and 
hat3 decided on an organizational program designed to assure 
their loyalty. At the same time, under the pretense of protect-
ing the public against hoodlums, authorities reportedly have 
already arrested a number of youths suspected of antigovern-
ment sentimentj 
CThe Vietnamese press, apparently at government instiga-
tion, is characterizing the small opposition group as "foreign 
inspired." Stressing that the group's press conference was 
held before "foreign journalists" in a "foreign hotel"--Air 
France's elegant Caravelle in Saigon--editorials in progovern-
ment papers have warned that this reliance on foreigners 
would lead to loss of Vietnamese sovereignty if the group had 
power.] 
L-The government apparently is considering more direct re-
pression of the group, which has just applied for registration 
as a legal opposition party. Ngo Dinh Nhu, President Diem's 
brother and political adviser, has described the group's pub-
lic criticism as illegal, and has stated that the government has 
little choice but to apply the law. Thus far, however, the gov-
ernment has maintained an official silence on the matter, with 
Diem taking stock of international reaction�particularly Ameri-
can- -before showing his hand. In a rare presidential press 
conference held recently, Diem stated that "critics are always 
acceptable provided they are fair and Impartial
