 USSR'S ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS REACH CLIMAX
 The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the So-
 viet Union was primarily a panegyric to past Soviet
 attainments, but the presentations also exuded great
 confidence in the future. Five missiles were un-
 veiled in the Moscow parade on 7 November.
 THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY:   THE NEXT PHASE
 The North Atlantic Council has given the green light
 to the US to negotiate a safeguards article for the
 treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but
 protracted negotiations are still in store.
 YUGOSLAV "EXPOSE" OF CIA REFLECTS PARTY DISSENSION
 Both supporters and opponents of Yugoslavia's eco-

 COUP IN YEMEN IMPROVES CHANCES FOR RECONCILIATION
 The bloodless coup that took place in republican

 FAR EAST
 Hanoi appears to be making a vigorous
 effort to counter the inauguration of the new
 South Vietnamese Government with a major show
 of strength.
 North Vietnamese propaganda is portray-
 ing last week's attacks at Loc Ninh as retalia-
 tion for intensified US air strikes in the
 Hanoi area and as the opening of a "winter-
 spring" campaign.   Repeated Communist assaults
 on Loc Ninh, at the cost of nearly 1,000 troops
 killed in action, suggest an attempt to es-
 tablish another "front"  in the northern III
 Corps area adjacent to Cambodia,  similar to the
 one in the Demilitarized Zone area, as well as
 to score a psychological victory.   Increased
 Communist military pressure in III Corps,  the
 Mekong Delta,  and the western highlands has
 been accompanied by a tough restatement of
 Hanoi's position on negotiations by North Viet-
 namese party first secretary Le Duan in Moscow.
 In China,  for the first time since the
 shift to a moderate course two months ago,  there
 are signs that militant Maoists in Peking are
 attempting to mount a counterattack.   Recent
 articles in party and army journals have praised
 Lin Piao, appealed for army loyalty to Mao's
 thought, and implied that the military has been
 treating Red Guards too harshly.   The extremists
 apparently are trying to capitalize on Red Guard
 resistance to army efforts to enforce orders to
 reopen schools and suppress violence.
 Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk has signaled
 his desire to maintain at least a facade of
 cordial relations with Peking despite his recent
 criticism of Chinese propaganda activities.   In
 response to a conciliatcry message from Premier
 Chou En-lai,  Sihanouk declared his willingness
 to terminate anti-Peking propaganda and accept
 a "complete reconciliation."   He hedged this
 position, however, by warning that such a re-
 conciliation will depend on a cessation of Com-
 munist activity in Cambodia.

 VIETNAM
 The much-heralded Communist
 "winter-spring" campaign is ap-
 parently under way in the III and
 IV Corps areas.   Moreover,  exten-
 sive enemy battle preparations in
 the western highlands indicate
 a new offensive may soon begin
 there.
 to the area south of the Demilitar-
 ized Zone  (DMZ).   The terrain, with
 its thick stands of rubber trees and
 dense jungle, is favorable to
 enemy operations. Furthermore,
 Cambodia, just a few miles to
 the north, offers a nearby sanc-
 tuary for rest and resupply.
 There are signs that ele-
 ments of the Communist B-3 Front--
 the over-all command authority
 in Kontum, Pleiku, and Darlac prov-
 inces--are preparing to attack
 US and South Vietnamese instal-
 lations throughout the area.   Sev-
 eral sharp skirmishes and enemy
 mortar attacks have already oc-
 curred in normally calm Darlac
 and in the Dak To area of Kontum.
 The Communists have at least
 four regiments in Kontum, in ad-
 dition to the headquarters and as-
 sociated support elements of the
 B-3 Front and the North Vietnamese
 1st Division.   A recent defector
 claimed a major attack was to have
 begun on 28 October--coincident
 with the Loc Ninh offensive--but
 a "failure in coordinated artil-
 lery"  forced postponement.   This
 "artillery" could include large-
 caliber rockets that may be used
 in a large-scale, well-coordinated
 assault on allied positions.
 The Communist offensive ac-
 tivity in northern III Corps has
 resulted in extensive enemy losses
 since the present
 phase
 began
 on
 28 October,
 with
 nearly
 1,000
 men
 reportedly
 killed
 thus
 far.
 it
 is possible, however, that the
 Communists hope to establish a
 "second front" in this sector,
 which is similar in many respects
 The Communist intention would
 be to draw in and tie down substan-
 tial allied forces in a long, in-
 conclusive campaign.  Already,
 five US Army battalions totaling
 some 4,000 men--in addition to
 South Vietnamese reinforcements--
 have been deployed to the Loc
 Ninh - Song Be area.
 This week's activity in the
 northern III Corps area included
 several large-scale enemy assaults
 on the recently reinforced allied
 defensive positions.   One encoun-
 ter between South Vietnamese and
 Communist forces near Song Be
 on 5 November resulted in high
 friendly casualties, caused in part
 by the enemy enjoying the tacti-
 cal advantage of prepared positions.
 In the battle,  96 South Vietnamese
 were killed,  36 were wounded,  and
 56 weapons were lost.
 Throughout the Mekong Delta
 provinces of IV Corps there has been
 a sharp increase in enemy attacks
 against friendly night defensive po-
 sitions as well as against lightly
 defended base camps and remote dis-
 trict towns.   The attacks inflicted
 heavy casualties on at least one
 ARVN unit and almost totally de-
 stroyed a Revolutionary Develop-
 ment team.   Such casualties have
 little effect on allied troop
 strength, but the psychological

 impact on the local populace is
 considerable because the enemy ac-
 Lions create doubt as to the abil-
 ity of allied forces to establish
 and maintain adequate security.
 South Vietnam's new govern-
 ment is getting under way slowly.
 The failure so far to appoint and
 announce the full cabinet may give
 rise to speculation that internal
 difficulties are already besetting
 the regime.   The lower house, in-
 active since its inauguration on
 31 October,  still has to complete
 the validation of the election of
 its members.   This process may
 be complicated by the disqualifi-
 cation of one winner in Kien
 Giang Province on charges of an
 election law violation.
 Even though the house has
 not met,  there is already talk
 of the formation of at least one
 political bloc.   A former asso-
 ciate of Vice President Ky is tak-
 ing credit for the election of
 some 31 members of the house and
 is referring to them as the "Demo-
 cratic Bloc."                       His one attempt to
 get some 28 of these members to
 commit themselves to a formal po-
 litical grouping was a failure,
 however,  largely because the rep-
 resentatives themselves probably
 have decided to wait and see how
 alliances shape up when the assem-
 bly convenes.
 Evidence continues to accumu-
 late indicating dissatisfaction in
 the ranks of the Buddhist church
 over the manner in which the lead-
 ers of the militant and moderate
 factions are handling the current
 crisis over the charter.   Senti-
 ment appears to be growing to by-
 pass both Thich Tri Quang and
 Thich Tam Chau in efforts to reach
 present split in the Buddhist
 church can be healed only if the
 extremists in both factions are
 bypassec. and more moderate ele-
 ments allowed to work out a solu-
 tion.
 OnE! possible indicator of a
 less rigid posture on the part
 of the militants is their reported
 order to the clergy to cease self-
 immolations,  to continue nonvio-
 lent struggle activities, and to
 protest directly to President
 Thieu about government interfer-
 ence in the internal affairs of
 the Buddhist church.
 The Soviet Anniversary
 Statements by Vietnamese Com-
 munist spokesmen in both Moscow
 and Hanoi on the 50th anniversary
 of the Soviet revolution have been
 replete with praise for the USSR
 and the importance of Soviet as-
 sistance to the Vietnamese revolu-
 tion.   ?arty First Secretary Le
 Duan,  s'2eaking before the Supreme
 Soviet on 3 November,  spelled out
 Hanoi's toughest terms for talks
 with the US and for a settlement
 of the gar.

 Ridiculing what he termed
 "profuse talk about false peace,"
 he restated Hanoi's demand that
 the "four points" and the program
 of the Liberation Front serve as
 the basis for settlement.   He
 added, moreover,  that if the US
 wants talks with the North Viet-
 namese it must "definitively and
 unconditionally" end the bombings
 of the DRV.
 Le Duan also provided Hanoi's
 major pronouncement on the anniver-
 sary in an article in the party
 daily urging socialist unity in
 the most specific language used
 recently by any Vietnamese Commu-
 nist spokesman.
 While the over-all thrust of
 the article was probably pleasing
 to the Soviets, Le Duan also
 stressed the necessity of revolu-
 tionary violence as an ingredient
 of national liberation movements.
 In keeping with Hanoi's continuing
 efforts to stay neutral in the
 Sino-Soviet dispute, Le Duan
 seemed mainly concerned with re-
 minding both Peking and Moscow        25X1
 that their differences must not
 be allowed to undermine the Com-
 munist effort in Vietnam.
 PEKING EXPERIENCES DIFFICULTIES IN RESTORING ORDER
 Although Peking's propaganda
 continues to stress the importance
 of getting students to return to
 the classroom, there are a number
 of indications that the central
 authorities are having trouble
 convincing militant Red Guards to
 abandon violence, return to their
 homes,  and unite with their more
 conservative,  locally oriented
 rivals.   Tensions between opposing
 Red Guard organizations remain
 high in many areas, and clashes
 between rival groups appear to
 have increased recently.   The
 level of violence, however,  is
 still far below that of last sum-
 mer.
 Passions aroused in the
 course of the Cultural Revolution
 have not yet cooled, and the mil-
 itants,  apparently fearful of be-
 ing "swallowed up" by their more
 conservative rivals, are probably
 attempting to retain some organi-
 zational autonomy.   Peking's con-
 tinued exhortations to the Red
 Guards to join in "revolutionary
 great alliances" and to return to
 school strongly suggest that the
 central authorities are having
 trouble in getting the young mili-
 tants to follow these instructions.
 The regime continues to pub-
 licize the opening of schools

 throughout the country, but scat-
 tered reports indicate that some
 schools, at least, will. not be
 open for awhile.   Moreover, clashes
 :between rival Red Guards have
 taken place within the newly
 opened schools.
 The army remains the princi-
 pal instrument of the Peking au-
 thorities in enforcing their will.
 Military patrols are continuing to
 keep order in most cities and in
 some places these patrols have
 recently been beefed up.
 much of the recent trouble
 probably results from local re-
 sistance to Peking's attempts to
 restrict and circumscribe militant
 Red Guard activity.   The militants
 have been steadily losing ground
 during the two months in which the
 trend toward moderation has domi-
 nated the Chinese political-land-
 scape, and they have been appeal-
 ing to Peking to reverse decisions
 detrimental to their position.
 There are now signs that the
 militant Maoists in Peking may be
 attempting to repair the damage
 done to their position by exploit-
 ing the unhappiness of the radical
 Red Guard in order to get the Cul-
 tural Revolution back in high gear.
 On 2 November, the army's acting
 chief of staff published a long ar-
 ticle that attacked his discred-
 ited predecessor, Lo Jui-ching,
 called on the army to be loyal to
 the thought of Mao Tse-tung, and
 lavishly lauded Lin Piao, Mao's
 radical heir.   Lo was first at-
 tacked by name in early August at
 the height of last summer's radi-
 cal campaign.
 A People's Daily editorial on
 7 November claimed that mass move-
 ments served to "inspire and edu-
 cate" the army, and called on the
 military not to "divorce itself
 from the masses."   This line   im-
 plies that the army has been treat-
 ing the Red. Guards too harshly--
 an, accusation that was frequently
 raised last. spring and summer when
 radical policies were in the as-
 cendancy.   Finally,  a Liberation
 Army Dail editorial of 6 November
 warned military personnel not to
 "blindly obey orders" when those
 orders conflict with the thought
 of Mao.   This line was also used
 to exhort. Red Guards last spring,

 Revolution activity during Feb-

 CAMBODIA'S RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST CHINA ARE EASING
 Prince Sihanouk has responded
 favorably to Peking's latest ef-
 fort to ease relations with Cam-
 bodia.
 Sihanouk announced on 1 No-
 vember that he had received a
 message from Premier Chou En-lai
 calling for "re-establishment of
 sincere friendship" between the
 two countries.   According to Si-
 hanouk, Chou acknowledged Siha-
 nouk's leadership of the Cambo-
 dian people and reaffirmed China's
 adherence to the "Bandung prin-
 ciple" of nonintervention in Cam-
 bodia's internal affairs.   Siha-
 nouk has charged repeatedly over
 the past several months that Chi-
 na's propaganda activities in
 Cambodia amounted to a repudiation
 of these "principles."
 The Chinese premier's mes-
 sage, which played effectively on
 Sihanouk's personal regard for
 Chou,  appears to be a more artful
 version of one Chou sent in mid-
 September which caused Sihanouk
 to reverse a decision to withdraw
 Cambodian diplomatic personnel
 from Peking.
 In response to the latest
 message, Sihanouk stated his
 willingness to terminate anti-
 Peking propaganda and accept a
 "complete reconciliation."   Sub-
 sequently, he also called off a
 referendum he had previously
 scheduled for early next year.
 The referendum was intended as
 a vote of confidence in Siha-
 nouk's government and, as such,
 would have been embarrassing for
 the pro-Peking leftists who have
 called for a change in Sihanouk's
 policies.
 dial relations.
 The Prince has also stated,
 however, that a real reconcilia-
 tion will depend entirely on a
 cessation of Communist activity
 in Cambodia.   Thus,  continued
 dissemination of Communist propa-
 ganda throughout the country,  and
 a reported renewal of small-
 scale Communist dissident activ-
 ity,  could prove to be persist-
 ent  irritants in his relations
 with China.   Nevertheless, al-
 though Sihanouk recently again
 voiced his suspicion that Peking
 will continue discreet support
 of Cambodia's pro-Communists,
 his response to Chou's letter
 underlines his desire to main-
 tain at least a facade of cor-

 PHILIPPINE: SENATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS NEAR
 The Philippine off-year elec-
 tion on 14 November is being
 viewed, particularly by President
 Marcos, as a barometer for the
 1969 presidential elections.   With
 this in mind, Marcos, who hopes
 to run again in 1969, has cam-
 paigned personally and vigorously
 for the Nacionalista Party candi-
 dates attempting to gain the eight
 out of 24 national senatorial
 seats that are being contested.
 In addition, all 63 provincial
 governorships and some 1,400 mu-
 nicipal and village posts are up
 for grabs.
 The Nacionalista Party ap-
 pears to have only a slight edge
 in the senatorial elections, but
 seems likely to improve its posi-
 tion in the provincial contests..
 Whatever the outcome,  Philippine-
 US relations will remain un-
 changed and President Marcos will
 continue to have serious diffi-
 culties in pushing his legislative
 programs.   Although the Nacion-
 alista Party is now in theoretical
 control of the Senate---it holds 12
 seats as compared with the nine
 held by the major opposition Lib-
 eral Party--party designations
 are virtually meaningless because
 Philippine politicians often cross
 party lines.   The Senate is in
 fact now controlled by a coalition
 of four Nacionalistas, nine Lib-
 erals, and three independents.
 In the current campaign,
 issues have varied from the per-
 formance of the Marcos adminis-
 tration--emphasized by the sena-
 torial candidates--to purely local
 matters highlighted in the prov-
 inces.   Opposition  to the Phil-
 ippines'   2,000-man noncombat force
 in Vietnam has been raised by Lib-
 eral Party candidates but appears
 to have elicited little interest.
 Local elections in the Phil-
 ippines traditionally inspire
 more violence than national ones,
 and the present campaign is no
 exception.   Although this is not
 the bloodiest in Philippine his-
 tory, 38 electioneering deaths had
 been recorded by late October.
 The pro-Communist Huks, who
 are attempting to broaden their
 political base in central Luzon,
 have accounted for some of the
 violence.   They have injected
 themselves into local campaigns
 with offers of support, threats
 of coercion, and--in some in-
 stances--open terrorism.   They
 are said to be supporting can-
 didates from the gubernatorial
 to the village level and, in
 their strongholds, to actually
 have selected local nominees.
 They support any candidates who
 offer them present protection
 and the prospect of increased
 influence in the local govern-
 ment.   Currently, increased Huk
 activity does not appear to
 reflect any significant increase
 in their still modest numeri-
 cal strength.

 EUROPE
 In Moscow and throughout the USSR,  the Soviet
 public had four days of holiday speech-making and
 festivities as the jubilee celebration reached a
 climax.   Not unexpectedly, the central motif of
 the official rites--capped by Brezhnev's keynote
 speech on 3 November and the Red Square parade
 on 7 November--was the USSR's defensive might
 and readiness.
 Yet for all the advance preparations and
 publicity,  the occasion turned out to be as flat
 and colorless as the "collective leadership"  it-
 self.   It remained for the Cubans, obviously put
 out by Moscow's none too subtle admonitions against
 Castro's revolutionary buccaneering,  to introduce
 a little interest by insulting the Soviets on
 their 50th birthday.
 While Polish party bigwigs were in Moscow,
 Foreign Minister Rapacki was again trying to drum
 up Western European interest in plans for a future
 European security system.   He brought up the sub-
 ject on a visit to Belgium from 2 to 5 November
 and will discuss it with Norway's foreign minister
 who is due in Warsaw this week.
 In Bonn, meanwhile,  it became clear that
 Foreign Minister Brandt has decided to press for
 an early resumption of diplomatic relations with
 Yugoslavia,  a decision that will be applauded in
 Belgrade.   The Yugoslavs, at the same time, have
 agreed to the opening of an East German consulate
 in Zagreb,  a reassuring gesture for Ulbricht that   25X1
 Belgrade still adheres to the doctrine of two

 USSR'S ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATIONS REACH CLIMAX
 For all of the preparation
 and foreign visitors,  the cele-
 bration of the 50th anniversary
 of the Soviet Union was primarily
 a panegyric to past Soviet at-
 tainments.   Although the presenta-
 tions exuded great confidence in
 the future, there was no indica-
 tion of how Moscow intends to
 deal with any of the domestic or
 foreign problems it faces.
 The top three Soviet leaders
 seemed to play a larger than
 usual role in the proceedings,
 and party General Secretary Brezh-?
 nev clearly was more prominent
 than Premier Kosygin or President
 Podgorny.   Brezhnev's formulations
 on the key domestic issues--in-
 cluding the question of division
 of investment resources between
 industry and agriculture--came
 down on middle ground.   His major
 speech was studded with references
 to the party's collective wisdom.
 east."   In renewing the Soviet
 pledge of support to the Vietnamese
 Communists, he repeated the Soviet
 claim that Peking's failure to co-
 operate with other Communist states
 in aiding the Vietnamese had hin-
 dered their war effort.   He also
 complained of the damage done to
 socialist unity by the "chauvin-
 istic and great-power course" of
 the Mao regime, at which point the
 two Chinese Embassy officials at-
 tending--Peking sent no delega-
 tion--walked out.
 Brezhnev aimed a less direct
 blow at such Communist mavericks
 as Yugoslavia,  Rumania,  and Cuba.
 All three of these states were prob-
 ably the intended targets of a
 remark critical of "nationalist
 insularity," but Cuba seemed singled
 out by his observation that "Marx-
 ist-Leninists have always under-
 stood that socialism cannot be
 transplanted from one country to
 another by means of armed force."
 The feeling of apprehension
 that something might occur to mar
 the celebration seemed to continue
 throughout the week.   Some pro-
 vocative act by China appeared to
 be in the forefront of Moscow's
 thinking.
 This preoccupation with the
 Chinese emerged clearly in Brezh-
 nev's keynote speech.   In a pas-
 sage on defense, Brezhnev claimed
 the USSR's armed forces were pre-
 pared to counter any threat "from

 Following the death last month

 properly eulogized--the Soviet press

 Bolivia seemed to typify.   The ar-

 low level of the Cuban delegation

 to have been the subsequent failure

 between Moscow and Havana have
 thus become more apparent, but
 have as yet had no visible effect
 on the patron-client relationship
 between the two.
 Another rift in Communist
 solidarity was also displayed when
 Brezhnev made a brief statement
 in support of a new international
 meeting of Communist parties,  a
 contentious issue of several
 year's standing.   Several key
 parties, and particularly the
 Chinese, view this as an unwel-
 come effort by the Soviet to as-
 sert their supremacy and as an
 essentially anti-Chinese move.
 Brezhnev was seconded by several
 party leaders attending the an-
 niversary celebrations, but regu-
 lar opponents--such as Yugoslavia
 and Rumania--remained silent.   A
 full-scale meeting does not appear
 imminent, but some further word
 on preparations--which the Soviets
 have previously said must be care-
 fully arranged--may emerge from
 the present gathering in Moscow.
 Brezhnev made few references
 to the US.   His harshest remark.
 came, predictably enough,  in con-
 nection with Vietnam, where he
 likened US military actions to
 those of "fascist monsters."   He
 also gave the ritual characteriza-
 tion of the US as the leader of
 Communism's imperialist foes, but
 nothing he said seemed to fore-
 shadow any change in the Soviet at-
 titude tcward matters of mutual
 Soviet-US interest.
 New Military Hardware
 Unveiled
 In the Moscow parade on 7 No-
 vember,  the Soviets unveiled five
 missiles including an ICBM that
 was probably the widely deployed
 S5-9.   A Soviet commentator said
 the ICBM missile used a "new and
 highly efficient" propellant, but
 gave no details.
 A naval missile in the parade
 was described by the Soviets as
 underwater launched.   It was too
 big to be launched from a submarine,
 however.   A two-stage,  solid-pro-
 pellant medium- or intermediate-
 range missile on a trailer may have
 been the missile carried in the
 Scamp mobile transporter-launcher,
 which it followed in the parade. A
 short-range missile that was shown
 possibly was the 450-mile-range
 SS-12.
 Ano-:her new system consisted
 of three antiaircraft missiles
 mounted on a tracked vehicle.   The
 missiles were described as being
 effective at extremely low alti-
 tudes and probably will be used in
 support of ground forces.   Other
 new equipment included a tracked
 combat vehicle carrying personnel
 and mounting an antitank missile
 and a conventional gun.

 THE NONPROLIFERATION TREATY:  THE NEXT PHASE
 The North Atlantic Council
 (NAC)  has given the green light
 to the US to negotiate a safe-
 guards article for the treaty to
 prevent the spread of nuclear
 weapons  (NPT), but protracted ne-
 gotiations are still in store be-
 fore the treaty is ready for sign-
 ing.
 At the NAC meeting on 31 Oc-
 tober, the allies agreed the US
 should work out a safeguards ar-
 ticle with the USSR which would
 take into account the principles
 drawn up by the EURATOM members,
 excluding France.   One of these
 principles is that safeguards
 shall apply only to the use of
 natural uranium and fissionable
 material.   Another is that EURATOM
 itself shall have a role in nego-
 tiating a safeguards arrangement
 with the International Atomic
 Energy Agency  (IAEA)  to cover
 EURATOM's members.   Finally, the
 IAEA shall only verify,  and not
 duplicate, EURATOM's safeguards
 system.
 While the West Europeans have
 been considering their position
 on safeguards, a number of other
 countries have raised problems
 and have proposed amendments to
 the treaty.   Although their objec-
 tions have focused mainly on the
 treaty's discrimination between
 states with nuclear weapons and
 those without, other issues that
 have been raised include the peace-
 ful uses of nuclear energy, the
 absence of disarmament obligations
 for the nuclear powers, and secu-
 rity assurances for nonnuclear
 states.
 Mexico, Brazil, Egypt, and
 Rumania have proposed amendments
 that reflect these concerns.
 The Mexican amendments would make
 it a duty of nuclear states to
 undertake disarmament measures
 and to contribute to the develop-
 ment of peaceful uses of nuclear
 energy in  nonnuclear countries.
 Brazil wants a treaty that will
 permit a  nonnuclear nation to
 conduct nuclear explosions for
 peaceful purposes.   Rumania's
 amendments are in the same vein
 and may have been put forth as
 much to make a point of Bucha-
 rest's independence of Moscow as
 for any other purpose.
 An Egyptian proposal would
 have the nuclear states pledge
 not to use nuclear weapons against
 countries that have no nuclear
 weapons deployed in their terri-
 tory.   India, reflecting its spe-
 cial concern with China, wants
 specific security assurances;  to
 meet these,  the US and USSR are
 beginning negotiations on an
 agreement separate from the NPT,
 possibly in the form of a UN res-
 olution.
 Given the numerous problems
 still to be dealt with,  it appears
 unlikely that the Geneva disarma-
 ment conference will be able to
 present an agreed draft treaty
 to the current session of the UN
 General Assembly.   The Geneva
 group, however, could forward the
 US-USSR draft along with the var-
 ious amendments for preliminary
 consideration by the assembly.

 YUGOSLAV "EXPOSE" OF CIA REFLECTS PARTY DISSENSION
 Both supporters and oppo-
 nents of Yugoslavia's economic
 and party reforms have used a
 press expose of alleged Central
 Intelligence Agency  (CIA)  ac-
 tivities as a device to con-
 tinue their quarrel over the
 future of the reform program.
 The expose, carried by the
 country's leading daily, Borba,
 was nominally instigated by
 secret police and party ele-
 ments, who professed to be em-
 barassed by the inability of
 the police to prevent the re-
 cent escape from Yugoslavia of
 a Nazi war criminal.   The real
 impetus for the series of arti-
 cles, however, came from oppo-
 nents of the economic reform
 who are attempting to brand it
 as harmful to national security
 and its backers as subversive.
 These hard liners have been
 gaining some influence in re-
 cent weeks by playing on Tito's
 professed fears of an "imperi-
 alist" threat to Yugoslavia.
 Before the first article
 appeared in print, however,
 proreform elements, which in-
 clude leading party and govern-
 ment officials,  succeeded in
 turning the bias of the series
 against their opponents.   The
 first article, appearing on 31
 October, was mild in its treat-
 ment of CIA and scathing in its
 attack on the antireform   ele-
 ments.   They were identified
 as supporters of ousted secu-
 rity boss and former party sec-
 retary Aleksandar Rankovic.
 Borba granted that foreign in-
 tel gence  services were active
 in Yugoslavia, but charged that
 their activities had been delib-
 erately exaggerated to discredit
 both the reforms and last year's
 curtailment of the secret police.
 The article, for example, de-
 nounced conservative-inspired
 rumors that the late Boris Kraj-
 ger, a primary architect of the
 economic reform, had grown rich
 on CIA money.
 Subsequent articles, appear-
 ing through 4 November, dealt
 blandly with alleged CIA informa-
 tion-gathering efforts, but com-
 plained about the activities of
 foreign military attaches and
 called for increased vigilance on
 the part of all Yugoslavs.
 In the final analysis, the
 effect of the expose may be to
 turn public and official opinion
 against the hard liners who ini-
 tiated it.   They are now accused
 in the press of creating dissen-
 sion and undermining public con-
 fidence in regime policies.   Tito
 himself apparently has grown con-
 cerned about their efforts to
 hamstring his reforms and may be
 preparing to act against them.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 Several perennial problems in the area have
 taken a new twist, but no real solution to them
 is in sight as yet.
 As expressed publicly by King Husayn,  the
 Arab attitude toward a peace settlement with Is-
 rael seems to have become somewhat more flexible.
 The Arabs now accept the concepts of "nonbel-
 ligerency" and freedom of navigation through the
 Suez Canal and the Straits of Tiran, and ac-
 knowledge Israel's right to exist.   They continue
 to insist, however, that this entails a reciprocal
 Israeli acceptance of responsibility for the refu-
 gees, involving either repatriation or compensa-
 tion.   Even if some proposal succeeds in the UN,
 implementation is likely to be a long drawn out
 process.
 The bloodless coup in Yemen probably improves
 the country's long-range chances  of putting an end
 to the civil war.   Although the new leaders are
 strongly republican and firmly opposed to the royal
 family, their own tribal affiliations may enable
 them to deal with tribes that form the bulk of
 royalist forces and thus pave the way for a general
 agreement.
 Schramme and his mercenaries have fled the
 Congo and are in the process of being evacuated
 from Rwanda.   Mobutu, however, is  lemanding their
 extradition to stand trial.   The mercenary thrust
 from Angola seems to have run out of steam.
 In the Nigerian civil war,  the federal army
 is making more thorough preparations before re-
 newing the offensive in the face of strong Biafran
 resistance.   Biafran leader Ojukwu may be taking
 advantage of the relative lull in the fighting
 to conclude deals for arms and mercenaries, whose
 arrival in Biafra could prolong the conflict.
 The prospects for peace talks under British auspices
 and for the arrival of the oft-postponed OAU mis-
 sion are now dimmer than ever.
 On 11 November the Ian Smith regime in Rhodesia
 will celebrate its second anniversary, happy in the
 fact that it has survived the imposition of sanc-
 tions.

 MERCENARIES LEAVE THE CONGO (KINSHASA)
 The mercenaries and Katangans
 led by Lt.   Colonel Jean Schramme,
 who had been in Bukavu since early
 August, have fled the city and are
 encamped under Rwandan Army guard
 a few miles inside Rwanda.
 The mercenaries had been un-
 der attack by the Congolese Na-
 tional Army  (ANC)  since 28 October.
 The ANC apparently kept up a steady
 barrage of fire and gradually
 whittled away at the mercenary
 force.   With their ranks depleted
 and their ammunition and supplies
 running low, the mercenaries left
 Bukavu to the "triumphant" ANC.

 Rwandan President Kayibanda
 is now faced with the problem of
 getting them out of his country.
 The International Red Cross an-
 nounced that several countries,
 including the US, Belgium, France,
 Canada, and Zambia, have agreed to
 supply planes for airlifting both
 the mercenaries and Katangans out
 of Rwanda.   The mercenaries are to
 be returned to their home countries--
 primarily Belgium and France;  the
 Katangans are to be flown to Zambia.
 Problems arose when Congolese au-
 thorities demanded that the merce-
 naries be extradited to the Congo
 to stand trial.   It seems probable,
 however, that if the mercenaries
 can be quickly removed from the
 scene, Congolese President Mobutu
 will bellow a bit, but will accept
 the inevitable.
 The mercenaries who invaded
 Katanga on 1 November seem to have
 disappeared and may have gone back
 to Angola.   The invasion apparently
 was only a small diversionary raid
 designed to create confusion and
 draw ANC troops toward Katanga.
 Several accounts report that mer-
 cenary leader Bob Denard is in
 charge of the operation, but his
 presence inside the Congolese bor-
 ders has not been confirmed.
 The ANC claims to have had
 several encounters with the mer-
 cenaries, the most recent being
 near Kisenga on 6 November.   At
 any rate,the rail line between Lu-

 COUP IN YEMEN
 IMPROVES CHANCES FOR RECONCILIATION
 The bloodless coup that took
 place in republican Yemen on 5
 November improves the country's
 long-range chances of achieving
 an end to the civil war.
 A group of exiled leaders--
 recently released from a year's
 detention in Cairo, where they
 had been held because of their
 anti-Egyptian policies--over-
 threw the regime of unpopular
 President Sallal, who was en
 route to Moscow.   The provisional
 head of state is now ex-premier
 al-Iryani,  chairman of a three-
 man presidential council that
 also-includes Ahmad Numan--a
 former prime minister dismissed
 by Sallal in 1965 for his anti-
 Egyptian tendencies--and Mu-
 hammad Ali Uthman, previously
 vice premier in Sallal's cabinet.
 The new prime minister of a 16-
 man cabinet is Muhsin al-Aini,
 a former Yemeni ambassador to
 the US..   The coup had almost
 unanimous support in the capital,
 and its leaders, unlike the
 Sallal regime,  enjoy wide tribal
 support.
 Five of the new Yemeni
 leaders are members of the Yemen
 Revolutionary Front  (YRF),  a
 group founded to work for the
 withdrawal of Egyptian armed
 forces from Yemen. Although ded-
 icated to the preservation of
 the republic, and firmly opposed
 to the royal family of Hamid al-
 Din,  the YRF aimed at the achieve-
 ment of national reconciliation
 with the royalists.
 The new regime has already
 announced its determination to
 seek an end to the five-year-old
 civil war.   It has emphasized,
 however, that the republicans and
 royalists should talk without any
 mediator--a reference to a three-
 nation peace committee established
 by the Khartoum summit conference
 to mediate the civil war.   Al-
 though initial statements by the
 new regime emphasized the debt
 of gratitude that Yemen owes to
 Egypt, the group can be expected
 to resist any form of Egyptian
 interference in Yemeni internal
 affairs.
 There is no indication that
 the Egyptians were informed of the
 plot in advance, but Egypt no longer
 has either troops or diplomatic
 representatives in the Yemeni cap-
 ital.                                                                    The authoritative Cairo
 newspaper, Al-Ahram, reports that
 Egypt considers the coup a purely
 domestic Yemeni affair,  and other
 Egyptian press commentary applauds
 the new cabinet as representative
 of all Yemeni republican groups.
 The new regime's tribal sup-
 port will give some cohesion to
 the disintegrating republic while
 Egyptian troops are being with-
 drawn.   In addition, this support
 may enable the regime to deal
 with the other branches of the
 same tribes who form the bulk of
 the royalists forces,  and thus
 pave the way for a national re-
 conciliation.

 EGYPT MOVES TO EASE CRITICAL PETROLEUM SHORTAGE
 Egypt is taking steps to re-
 place supplies of refined petro-
 leum products previously obtained
 from its Suez refineries.   An ar-
 rangement apparently is being con-
 cluded with the British Petroleum
 Company under which some Egyptian
 crude oil from the El   Murgan
 field--current production runs
 about 320,000 tons per month--
 will be shipped by tanker to the
 British refinery at Aden for
 processing and the products then
 returned to Egypt.
 Only relatively minor ad-
 justments are needed to enable
 the Aden refinery to handle the
 Egyptian crude oil.   Three tank-
 ers,                   including a 50,000-ton So-
 viet tanker, have already ar-
 rived at Aden with Egyptian crude
 and are only waiting for the nod
 from London to begin unloading.
 Egypt's supply problem will ex-
 tend at least to the first quarter
 of 1968.
 Domestic refining capacity
 now in operation consists only of
 a refinery at Alexandria, which
 can produce about 125,000 tons of
 refined products a month--about a
 quarter of Egypt's domestic con-
 sumption.   The refinery now oper-
 ates wholly on imported crude,
 with Soviet supplies--now averag-
 ing about: 70,000 tons a month--
 being supplemented by Algerian
 crude.

 SOUTH ARABIAN ARMY CHOOSES SIDES
 The South Arabian Army has
 declared its support for the Na-
 tional Liberation Front (NLF).
 Despite the overwhelming
 NFL sympathies of the army, it
 had acted up to now as a pacify-
 ing force in the bloody fighting
 between the NLF and its rival,
 the Front for the Liberation of
 Occupied South Yemen  (FLOSY).
 By not taking sides, the army
 had hoped to stave off a politi-
 cal split among its officers and
 to maintain the unity of the
 army as a force in South Arabian
 politics.

 Then last weekend the fierc-
 est fighting of the civil war
 broke out in Aden between the
 NLF and FLOSY,  developing into
 what one leader described as  "a
 war of total extermination."   It
 appeared that the NLF was winning
 the war by ruthless fighting and
 by the wholesale removal of an
 estimated 800 residents to deten-
 tion in the neighboring state.
 In five days of fighting, some
 100 Arabs were reported dead and
 over 300 wounded.
 At this point, the army
 announced that it was stepping

 requested that the NLF and the
 British negotiate for immediate
 independence.  The local command
 of the NLF has asked its leaders,
 who are negotiating the formation
 of a unified government with
 FLOSY in Cairo, to break off
 talks and come home.  The prepon-
 derance of support for the NLF,
 which now controls most of the
 towns of the hill states, the
 army, and the South Arabian po-
 lice, as well as the greater part
 of Aden, make it likely that the
 NLF will be able to achieve vic-
 tory and form a government before
 the British evacuation late this
 month.

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Elections are scheduled, or at least antici-
 pated, in several Latin American countries in the
 next 12 months,  and pre--election maneuvering is
 affecting present political activity.
 Peruvians are holding a by-election on 12
 November to fill the congressional seat from
 Lima Departnent, which has more than 40 percent
 of the total electorate.   The seat had been held
 by President Belaunde's Popular Action Party,
 but current reporting gives the opposition APRA
 a 50-50 chance of winning it this time.   The out-
 come of the vote should indicate the effect of
 continuing political and economic crises on the
 President's popularity.
 A similar by-election in Chile on 17 De-
 cember may produce a jolt for President Frei.
 At stake is a Senate seat formerly held by Frei's
 Christian Democratic Party.   If the leftists--
 Communists,  Socialists, Radicals, and Social
 Democrats--succeed in uniting behind one candi-
 date,  they could bring off a victory that would
 leave Frei's party with only 12 out of the 45 seats
 in the Senate.
 Accion Democratica,   the governing party in
 Venezuela,  is so split by rivalry among its po-
 tential presidential candidates for the election
 in December 1968 that one of the other parties
 may well win.
 In Panama, potential presidential candidates
 currently holding public office must resign by
 12 November if they are to run in next May's elec-
 tion.                                     This puts immediate pressure on Finance
 Minister Samudio, President Robles'  choice.  Second
 Vice President Arango, who is being backed by
 four dissident parties in the government coali-
 tion,  is not in the category requiring resignation
 six months prior to the election.
