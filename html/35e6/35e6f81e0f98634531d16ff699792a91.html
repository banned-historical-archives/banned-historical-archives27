 continuous auction market, its market must
 have adequate "depth," a need that is gen-
 erally recognized in listing and delisting
 standards. The depth of buying and selling,
 according to the report, is directly affected
 by the round-lot unit of trading; thus a re-
 duction in the round-lot trading unit (100
 shares) ? would tend to add to the flow of
 buy and sell orders conttiuing the depth of
 the market at any given time.  Accordingly,
 the study recommends a "Government-in-
 dustry study of the feasibility and desir-
 ability of reducing the round-lot unit for all
 or some securities."
 INSTITUTIONAL  PARTICIPATION AND BLOCK
 TRANSACTIONS
 The report emphasizes the growing im-
 portance of  institutions relative to  in-
 dividuals  as investors in stocks, although
 pointing out that the holdings and trading
 of stocks by institutions are still consider-
 ably less important than those of individuals.
 The report also notes the "special import-
 ance" of institutions to the trading markets
 resulting from their large unit holdings and
 the concentration of decision making power
 in relatively few investor units.
 Institutional transactions showed concen-
 trations inrissues listed on the NYSE. Trans-
 actions executed on the regional exchanges
 involve for the most part NYSE issues and
 most were by the open-end investment com-
 panies.                          While the NYSE is the most im-
 portant market  channel  for  institutional
 transactions in listed stocks, many institu-
 tions indicated that their use of the over-
 the-counter markets for listed stocks has
 been increasing in recent years.
 The report also states that while the in-
 vestment companies (mutual funds) have
 noticeably higher stock turnover rates than
 other institutions, the turnover of the in-
 stitutional portfolios as a whole was lower
 than the NYSE market.  The institutions
 lower turnover rates "raises questions con-
 cerning the consequences of possible further
 increase In institutionalization of the mar-
 kets for stocks," which may Include the pos-
 sible further "thinning of the markets in
 particular issues."
 Most institutions were found to have con-
 centrated their commission business among
 relatively few brokers: no more than 10
 firms tended to account for more than 20
 percent of the business of each institution.
 NYSE member firms received more than two-
 thirds of the  total institutional  commis-
 sion business for the period studied.
 PENSION FUNDS
 With respect to pension funds, the report
 observes that while they are one of the most
 important institutional-investor groups and
 are growing at the fastest rate, "they are
 notable for the dearth of information pub-
 Holy available on their holdings."  The re-
 port concludes the Commission should rec-
 ommend that the Federal Welfare and Pen-
 sion Plans Disclosures Act be amended to
 require  "periodic"  disclosures  by  pension
 funds of their holdings of individual corpo-
 rate securities.
 OVER-THE-COUNTER     MARKETS  IN    EXCHANGE-
 LISTED SECURITIES
 The special study reports that one of the
 most striking developments in the securities
 markets in recent years has been the growth
 of a market away from the floor of the stock
 exchanges for securities traded on the ex-
 changes.  Because of the market's unique
 character, combining elements of both the
 exchange markets and the over-the-counter
 markets, the study refers to it as "the third
 market."
 The size of this third market may be
 judged, according to the report, by the fact
 that in 1961 markets were made for 270 com-
 mon stocks traded on the NYSE.  The study
 points out that while the volume of this
 market is approximately only 14 percent of
 NYSE volume, it has more than doubled in
 the past 20 years and appears to be con-     The report points out that there has been

 A notable characteristic of the market is
 the stress on very large and very small trans-

 are hardly unexpected since the handling of
 block transactions by institutions has long
 been accepted as a prime function of the
 third market.  The study also found, how-
 ever, that the share volume transacted in

 shares, constituted about 73 percent of the
 transactions and 18 percent of share volume

 dual trading of securities of companies in its
 vicinity.
 The report discusses the factors which led
 to the decline of the regional exchanges an

 causes of the shift to multiple markets have
 included:  (1)  freedom from controls over
 issuers in the over-the-counter markets as
 compared with issuers of listed securities; (2)
 greater flexibility of trading, "merchandis-
 ing" and pricing practices in the over-the-
 counter markets; and (3) Improvements in

 ing the growth of the over-the-counter mar-
 largest customers in the off-board market
 being responsible for 62 percent of the dollar
 volume of the third market in 1961.
 INDIVIDUALS' ROLE SURPRISING
 The relatively high percent of trading by
 individuals in the third market, 38 percent
 of dollar volume in 1961, is described by the
 report as surprising.
 Off-board trading of listed securities takes
 place in many ways, according to the study,
 but the great bulk occurs in over-the-counter
 markets for listed securities "made" by brok-
 er-dealers specializing in such trading and re-
 ferred  to. by  the  study  as  the  "market
 makers."  Some 17 firms were making these
 markets in 1961, with the largest part of the
 volume being transacted by only 7 firms.
 The study reports that though off-board
 trading in listed stocks necessarily accounts
 for some diversion of volume from the pri-
 mary exchange market, this diversion is rela-
 tively low in more than 70 percent of the
 272 stocks traded in the third market in 1981.

 GENERAL  CONCLUSIONS
 The special study concludes its chapter on
 thQ interrelationships of -trading markets
 with recommendations that the commission
 improve its facilities for the continuous ac-
 cumulation of data relating to trading mar-
 kets and that the commission establish a
 permanent policy and planning unit with the
 responsibility of accumulating and analyzing
 data bearing on market patterns and prac-
 tices.-The growth of multiple trading of NYSE
 securities raises two competing considera-
 tions, according to the report.  One is the
 impairment of the depth of the primary mar-
 ket.  On the other hand there are the gen-
 eral public benefits of competition that may
 be provided by multiple markets.
 The study concludes, not that impairment
 of depth in the primary markets is irrelevant
 or inconsequential, but that, under present
 circumstances, the benefits of competition
 by and. large outweigh any detriment attrib.
 utable to that impairment.

 reforms  of  the  "odd  lot"  business.  The
 study questions whether trading In odd lots
 (orders  of  less than  100   shares), which
 represents the transactions of small Investors
 and comprises a significant amount of busi-
 ness on the listed exchanges, should be more
 costly  than  other transactions,  now  that
 automation is available.
 Its odd lot reforms and Its proposal com-
 pletely to eliminate floor traders are the
 most controversial of the study's recommen-
 dations.  The report regards floor traders as
 an  anachronism  in  the  present  market.
 According to Its evidence, floor traders are
 in a privileged position and often accentuate
 market fluctuations.
 These specific recommendations call for
 further study  and  debate.  The  report Is
 primarily motivated by the laudable desire
 of protecting the public; but the economy-
 and the public-is best served by a liquid
 and responsive market which requires a cer-
 tain  degree  of speculative activity                and a
 wide variety of competition.  On this score
 there is some question that the study takes
 full account of what makes the market tick.
 The detailed examination of the Institu-
 tions involved in the trading of securities
 reveals that neither the listed  exchanges
 nor the vast over-the-counter market, which
 has been pretty much of a mystery until
 now, has fully acknowledged Its responsi-
 bilitles.  Wall Street has the most to gain
 from reforms that will strengthen the mar-
 ketplace.  Its responsiveness to the need for
 change is the key to Increasing participation
 by the public.
 [From the New York Herald Tribune, July
 18, 19631
 THE SEC's BoMssHEI.L
 Yesterday's Securities and Exchange Com-
 mission report blistered the financial com-
 munity, which had not expected anything
 nearly so severe.     In essence, it holds that
 self-policing has not been as effective as it
 ought to be. It proposes some major tighten-
 ing, aimed at wiping out the vestiges of
 what it sees as the "private club" atmos-
 phere  of  the major  securities  exchanges,
 and hitting squarely at some well-estab-
 lished prerogatives.
 There is no question but that a number of
 insiders  in  the  securities  business have
 profited by their knowledge, by being in a
 position to "feel" the market and to take
 quick advantage of its movement.  But what
 the regulators have to weigh, primarily. Is
 the effect of the various practices on the
 over-all functioning of a free securities mar-
 ket.  Speculative  activity,  for                 example,
 widens the swings of the market, but also
 provides much of its vigor.
 Back in 1934 a lot of financial men bit-
 terly opposed the Securities Exchange Act,
 which they saw as a threat to market in-
 stitutions.                      But instead of destroying the
 market it laid the basis for restored public
 confidence.
 It's going to take time for the financial
 community  to weigh in  detail the  five-
 volume report, and it's going to take more
 time to debate its recommendations ade-
 quately.
 Meanwhile, it's worth bearing in mind
 SEC  Chairman  Cary's  observation  that,
 though certain "faults and defects" exist,
 these "do not call for public alarm as to the
 basic integrity" of the markets. The mar-
 kets not only have served the public well,
 but they have made possible the phenomenal
 growth of American Industry.  This is no
 mean  achievement.  Whatever  improve-
 ments may ultimately result from the SEC
 report will be improvements in a mechanism
 that already functions well.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, I point
 out that the study shows we have strong
 institutions for trading in securities and,
 on the whole, they are doing their job
 well, but there are a few weaknesses, as
 shown by the study, in trading in over-
 the-counter accounts and in activities of
 specialists and traders for their own ac-
 counts which will require consideration.
 Moreover, it must be remembered that
 the SEC endorses the "general sound-
 ness" of this part of the report but has
 not endorsed specifically each finding or
 proposal.
 I give this pledge to the securities in-
 dustry: the hearings before the Subcom-
 mittee on Securities, of which I am the
 senior Republican, of the Committee on
 Banking and Currency on the SEC's
 recommendations based on the first part
 of the study report, and the legislation
 which will be coming to the floor, reflect
 a remarkable degree of unanimity and a
 very prudent and balanced point of view
 on the part of both the industry and the
 Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Chairman Cary, in sending the second
 segment of the special study report to
 the Congress, states that the recom-
 mendations for a solution to the prob-
 lems described in this part of the report
 can  be  eeeted  without  legislation,
 through the medium of the rule-making
 power of the SEC, with the exception of
 controls over operators of "quotation bu-
 reaus," which handle price quotations of
 over-the-counter scientists. The secur-
 ities industry will have a chance to ex-
 press its views at hearings which the
 SEC is required to conduct prior to the
 adoption of new regulations.
 Some legislation may be required. I
 think I can make the same pledge that
 should such legislation be introduced, it
 will be handled temperately, and that all
 elements of the securities industry, as
 well as the Securities and Exchange
 Commission, will have an opportunity
 to be heard.
 I think the Securities and Exchange
 Commission and the study group have
 done a fine job.  That does not mean
 I have to agree with everything they have
 said in part II of the study.  The urgent

 MUNISM'S BASE IN LATIN AMER
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, I am
 somewhat sorry that the two distin-
 guished gentlemen from Brazil who were
 here a short time ago are not present to
 hear this address, because the subject I
 want to talk about today is Cuba as a
 Communist  base  in  Latin  America,
 which obviously involves Brazil as well as
 the other countries in South and Latin
 America.
 In the past few weeks on the floor of
 the Senate concrete plans have been of-
 fered by Senators ALLoTT, CURTIS, and
 MUNDT for American policy toward lib-
 eration of Cuba.  These have been con-
 structive, carefully documented propos-
 als designed to assist in the downfall of
 the Communist regime in Cuba without
 resort to war or invasion.  Unfortunate-
 ly, several people have asked publicly
 why we should do any of these things.
 They have said "communism will evolve
 peacefully," or "we cannot create crises
 for Khrushchev," or "any action is too
 dangerous and certainly Cuba does not
 menace the United States."  How naive
 can we get?  My purpose today, Mr.
 President, is to show why Cuba is a men-
 ace to us, to this hemisphere, and the
 degree of that menace.  This will be
 carefully documented and should be a
 complete answer to the recent adminis-
 tration trial balloons that tensions are
 easing and that Khrushchev and Castro
 are at heart nice people interested in
 maintaining peace and order in the same
 way as we are.
 The President said on September 4,
 1962:
 It continues to be the policy of the United
 States that the Castro regime will not be al-
 lowed to export Its aggressive purposes by
 force or the threat of force.  It will be pre-
 vented by whatever means may be necesssary
 from taking action against any part of the
 Western Hemisphere.
 He further declared on September 13,
 1962:
 If Cuba should ever attempt to export its
 aggressive purposes by force or the threat of
 force  against  any  nation  in  this  hemi-
 sphere ? ? * this country will do whatever
 must be done to protect its own security and
 that of Its allies.
 These are the words of the President
 of the United States, speaking in formal
 statements on American policy with re-
 spect to Cuba on September 4 and 13
 of last year.  Lest anyone think that
 President Kennedy changed his tune
 after passing through the awesome ex-
 perience of the October missiles crisis,
 let me quote from his policy statement
 of November 20:
 If Cuba is not used for the export of ag-
 gressive Communist purposes, there will be
 peace in the Caribbean.
 Put in plain English, therefore, Presi-
 dent  Kennedy  in  those  statements
 warned Castro and his cohorts that there
 can be no peace in the Caribbean if
 Cuba is "used for the export of aggres-
 sive Communist purposes."
 Mr. President, what is the meaning
 of these somber Presidential declara-
 tions of policy?  Admittedly, the phrase
 "export of aggressive Communist pur-
 poses" is somewhat vague, as diplomatic
 language characteristically is.  But the
 meaning of these warnings seem to have
 been clarified by the distinguished Sec-
 retary of State, Mr. Rusk, a man whose
 discretion and tact are the hallmarks of
 his performance as this Nation's chief
 diplomat.
 Listen to what he said, Mr. President:
 It    has been  made very clear that  the
 Armed Forces of the hemisphere, including
 our own, are made available to insure that
 arms that are now In Cuba not be used out-
 side of Cuba, either in terms of organized
 effort or through piecemeal Infiltration of
 those  arms  into  other  countries  of  the
 hemisphere.
 And again he said:
 President Kennedy has made It utterly
 clear ? ? ?  that we would not permit any
 arms that are In Cuba to be used outside
 of Cuba ? ? ? that if and attempt were
 made to launch forays against any other
 countries, that those would meet the armed
 forces of the hemisphere, including those
 of the United States.

 1963                     CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 These statements, made in March of
 this year are even stronger than those
 made earlier by President Kennedy.
 One would have thought, on the basis
 of such warnings as I have just quoted
 from the two key people in this coun-
 try, who hold responsible positions, that
 Castro and his cohorts might have read
 the message loud and clear, the United
 States will take all steps necessary to
 prevent them from engaging in forcible
 and violent attempts to overthrow the
 non-Communist governments of Latin
 American countries.  I would have sup-
 posed that Castro might have been de-
 terred by these ringing declarations,
 threatening the use of the awesome
 power of the United States to enforce
 their intent.
 Well, Mr. President, what has been
 happening since these warnings were
 uttered?
 Item: On June 5, after first notifying
 a Caracas newspaper that they would
 attack the U.S. military mission build-
 ing, a gang of eight gunman from the
 Armed Forces of National Liberation, or
 FALN, the Venezuelan Communist ter-
 rorist organization, invaded our mission
 at pistol point, overpowered four Vene-
 zuelan guards, forced six U.S. Army offi-
 cers to strip, and stole their uniforms and
 sidearms.  They then set fire to the
 building and left, chanting, "Down with
 Yanqui imperialism!  Cuba, si! Yanquis,
 no!" after trampling and burning an
 American flag.  Two days later, Ha-
 vana's CMQ radio hailed the attackers
 as "patriots."  Here is a clear example
 of the export from Cuba of "aggressive
 Communist purposes"-if these words
 really mean anything.  What did we do
 to redress this humiliating attack on
 official U.S. representatives and our flag?
 Nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
 Mr. CURTIS.      Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  I am glad to yield
 to the Senator from Nebraska.
 Mr. CURTIS.  I commend the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Colorado for
 what he is saying today. His statement
 continues with well documented facts.
 He has rendered outstanding public serv-
 ice. It seems to me that one of the great
 tragedies of the time would be to have
 the United States officially follow a pol-
 icy which pretended that the Cuban
 problem, the Communist problem on our
 doorstep, did not exist.
 The Senator has given time and ef-
 fort and devoted his great talent to
 bringing not only to this body, but also
 to the country, every reason to repudi-
 ate such an idea.  If our Government
 follows a policy of paying no attention
 to communism on our doorstep --and it
 matters not what the reason is, whether
 it is deliberate, or whether it is due to
 the greater amount of emphasis given
 to other problems, or whether it is goaded
 into such a procedure by Communist ir-
 ritations around the globe-the fact re-
 mains that to have the communism in
 Cuba  problem  go  without  attention
 would be a great tragedy.
 It has sometimes been said that com-
 mittee hearings and committee reports
 are fine, but that once they are made
 they are put on the shelf and 'forgotten,
 unless some researcher or historian digs  monies at the Roldan Theater publicly
 them out.  I come back again to the in-   lauding Venezuelan communism's insur-
 vestigation made by the Subcommittee                                                                     rectionary arm, the Armed Forces of Na-

 guished Senator from Colorado, and any
 colloquy that may appear hereafter, I
 may include in the RECORD an editorial

 Broadcasting Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   (Mr.
 BARTLETT in  the chair).  Without ob-
 jection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. DOMINICK.   Mr. President, I
 thank the Senator from Nebraska.        I am
 glad he brought up the report of the
 Preparedness Subcommittee, because it
 is one of the things I will specifically re-
 fer to in my remarks.                                                               One of the rea-
 sons why I have undertaken to make
 these remarks is to try to detail abundant
 evidence of the need for the positive ac-
 tion which has been recommended by the
 Senator from Nebraska, by my distin-
 guished colleague from Colorado [Mr.
 ALLOTTI and by the Senator from South
 Dakota [Mr. MUNDT].
 I was discussing the' items of Commu-
 nist aggression which have occurred out
 of Cuba, the export of Communist ag-
 gression, since these statements of policy
 were made, in order to show that we are
 not, in fact, doing what we said we would
 do.  I have already spoken about the
 first one, in Venezuela.  I should like to
 take up the next one.
 Item: The Minister of Interior of the
 Colombian Government recently charged
 that "Peasants' Leagues," similar to the
 militant Communist groups in north-
 eastern Brazil, are operating in two Prov-
 inces of his country and are being fi-
 nanced, armed, and staffed by Castro's
 Cuba.  Does this not constitute a clear
 case of the export from Cuba of "aggres-
 sive Communist purposes?"
 Item: Excelsior, a Mexico City news-
 a cache of arms by a member of the
 ,on the Yucatan Peninsula, the part of
 Mexico nearest Cuba and reportedly a
 depository for arms shipped clandes-
 tinely from Cuba.  The account of this
 incident did not describe its outcome, ex-
 cept to say that the patrolman left the
 scene when he saw that the cache was
 guarded by armed men "who spoke
 Spanish  with  a Cuban accent." -Lil.?-
 Washin ton D.C. rumors have circu-
 lm or some time that Similar arms
 cases have been located by           but

 of Communist aggression with nothing
 done about it despite our declarations of
 policy.
 the incident.  This is another clear ex-
 ample of the export from Cuba of
 "aggressive Communist purposes."
 Item: On May 1 at a labor congress in
 Prague, the Cuban delegate told the
 assemblage that Cuba was striving pri-
 marily "to stimulate support for the peo-
 ple of Venezuela, Colombia, and Nica-
 ragua-with the aim of overthrowing the
 governments  of  those  countries."  A
 plain, clear statement of intent and ac-
 tion to export from Cuba "aggressive
 Communist purposes."
 Item: On May 20, Communist youths
 attacked Puerto Maldonado in southeast
 Peru.  Several were arrested by the au-
 thorities who subsequent discovered that
 this attack was part of a Castro-Commu-
 nist plan to unleash guerrilla warfare,
 terror, and sabotage upon the area, and
 to initiate similar operations against
 Lima, the national capital, and the an-
 cient Inca center of Cuzco. The captured
 guerrillas were part of a group of 69
 young Peruvians who had received 6
 months of training in Cuba in guerrilla
 warfare and related violent activities un-
 der the direction of Maj. Ernesto "Che"
 Guevara, Castro's guerrilla expert. This
 is further proof of the export from Cuba
 of "aggressive Communist purposes."
 I need not remind Senators that
 Havana is not alone and unaided in
 engaging in such acts as I have just
 enumerated. Listen to this excerpt from
 a commentary beamed in Spanish to
 Latin America on June 16 by Radio
 Moscow:
 The presidency of Betancourt recalls the
 dictatorship of Perez Jimenez. Is it any won-
 der. that the people have again taken up
 arms?  For the patriots of Venezuela no other
 course has remained. They have been forced
 to rise up in defense of the freedoms which
 had already been won by the people and
 which President Betancourt has trampled
 upon.
 Not  only  do  the  Communists  struggle
 against the police regime of Venezuela. The
 National  Liberation Front created  in the
 country includes the movement of the Rev-
 olutionary Left,                                                                                                     the  Democratic Republic
 Union, and many progressive organizations.
 It is natural that the order to arrest all
 Communists  is an   additional  dictatorial
 measure against all democratic forces, among
 them the bourgeois parties of the left of the
 country.
 This is an impudent declaration of war
 against all Venezuelan people.  Betancourt,
 in defending the interests of Nelson Rocke-
 feller and company, as their loyal bulldog, is
 leading the country toward open dictator-
 ship.  History repeats itself, but it can only
 repeat itself until the end, and the puppet
 of the monopolists will have the same fate
 as his predecessor, who, for crimes against
 the people, is now passing his days behind
 bars in jail

 from Moscow as well, of "aggressive
 Communist Purposes."
 And so, I return to the warnings
 uttered by the high command of the
 Kennedy administration that I quoted
 earlier.  How does one account for the
 Castro-Communist forces' apparent In-
 difference to these warnings?
 I think that a clue to what was really
 meant by these statements can be de-
 rived from an impromptu remark by
 the President at his news conference on
 April 24, when he said:

 trol all such channels.

 to believe that they will not or cannot do so.
 when so doing serves their stated purpose of
 creating uprisings In Latin American coun-
 tries.
 Needless to say, this is a matter that we
 consider of most serious  concern and  we
 intensively trace every rumor that comes to
 us of the importation of arms from Cuba
 to Latin American countries.
 Cuban financing of subversive operations
 in Latin America is generally effected by
 couriers carrying cash.  A few examples of
 these operations are:
 A Venezuelan politician, Fabricto Ojeda.
 returning from Cuba in March of 1962, was
 seen by several witnesses to have large quan-
 tities of U.S. currency stuffed in a false-
 bottomed  compartment  of  his  suitcase.
 There is no law against bringing currency
 into Venezuela, so that authorities could
 not even determine how much he brought
 in.   Ojeda later was captured,  tried, and
 sentenced to prison for guerrilla activity.
 A Nicaraguan exile. Julio Cesar Mayorga
 Portocarrera, was flying from Mexico to Hon-
 duras In September 1961 when weather forced
 the plane to overfly Honduras and land in
 Nicaragua.   He was found to be carrying
 $3,600 in cash, which he admitted he was
 bringing from Cuba for Nicaraguan rebels
 in Honduras.
 Last April Ecuadoran troops raided a guer-
 rilla training camp in the mountains west
 of Quito and arrested some 48 members of
 the URJE (Union of Revolutionary Ecuadoran
 Youth).  The leaders of the group*admitted
 having received guerrilla training In Cuba.
 They also received Cuban funds to support
 their activities; one item involving 644.000
 reached the public press.
 There are also involved bank transfers by
 which  Cuban  money  eventually  reached
 Latin American front groups to pay for polit-
 ical and propaganda activity.
 The principle that guerrillas must be self-
 sustaining has obviously been applied to fin-
 ances as well.                  Communist guerrillas have
 staged numerous bank robberies in Vene-
 zuela, Peru, and Argentina.
 The most spectacular holdup, for instance,
 was that of a bank in a Lima suburb last
 year which netted almost $100,000.  From the
 participants who have been caught we know
 that the holdup was carried out by a com-
 bination of guerrillas and ordinary criminals,
 who divided the loot 50-50.
 Just last week a bank in an outlying Vene-
 zuelan town was robbed of $25,000 by men
 wearing FALN armbands.
 Since the October crisis, Fidel Castro has
 obviously been trying to straddle the rift be-
 tween Moscow and Peiping over global Com-
 munist strategy.  As Mr. Martin aptly put It
 yesterday, Castro's heart is In Peiping but
 his stomach is in Moscow.
 This same split between all-out militancy
 and a more cautious policy-call It coexist-
 ence or "two steps forward, one-step back"-
 is reflected on the extreme left in many Latin
 American countries.
 Thus Cuba at present not only seeks to
 serve two masters, but to choose among rival
 servants in its Latin American subversions.
 Castro's views on what is good for socialism
 and revolution in Latin America are more
 in line with those of the Chinese Communists
 than the Soviets.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 The largest contingents have come from
 Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, and
 Bolivia.
 Some of the courses are as short as 4
 weeks, designed to let it appear that the
 trainees  had  merely  attended some  con-
 ference or celebration and done a little sight-
 seeing.
 Other courses last as long as a year, and
 may include intensive training in such things
 as sabotage, espionage, or psychological war-
 fare.
 Again, part of his evidence in support
 of his conclusions and his statement:
 Three Cuban nationals were involved in
 the strike violence at La Oroya, Peru, last
 December, which culminated in some $4 mil-
 lion worth of damage to the smelter of the
 American-owned Cerro de Pasco Mining Co.
 One of these Cubans has also been direct-
 ing the armed invasions of big ranches in
 the Andean highlands by land-hungry In-
 dians.   Information  of  this  nature  con-
 tributed to the decision of the Peruvian junta
 to crack down on Communists in January.
 In Brazil, in fact, the complaint of guer-
 rillas in training camps there was that they
 had been recruited by a promise of Cuban
 instructors, but found there were none.  This
 came to light in the Brazilian press when the
 report of a Cuban intelligence agent, relaying
 their complaints to Havana, turned up in the
 wreckage of the Varig airliner which crashed
 in Peru in November.
 I could continue indefinitely to quote
 from his statement, but all of it will
 be printed in the RECORD, pursuant to my
 Tequest.
 Mr. President, what is being done by
 the American Republics, and principally
 the United States, to thwart this offen-.
 live mounted against them by Havana in
 cahoots with Moscow?  Obviously, we
 are not going to allow a direct conven-
 tional attack on any country by Cuba;
 but, as I already pointed out, no one
 seriously worries about such an attack.
 What measures, then, are being taken to
 defeat the Communists in the subter-
 ranean war that is being fought in the
 streets,  in the  fields,  on university
 campuses, and elsewhere by small bands
 of highly dedicated and well-trained
 Communists?
 Admittedly, the United States has a
 policy.   In the first place, according to
 the President and other administration
 spokesmen, we are trying to persuade all
 members of the OAS to adopt strict and
 uniform measures to sever all diplomatic
 and commercial contacts with Cuba and
 to curb and control the movement of
 Castro-Communist  personnel,  propa-
 ganda, and arms throughout the hemi-
 sphere and between each country and
 Cuba.  In addition, we are told, elements
 of the Armed Forces of the United States
 are conducting an intensive surveillance
 of the Caribbean to detect and prevent
 clandestine movements of arms  and
 persons from Cuba to- neighboring coun-
 tries.  Personally, I share the skepticism
 of the Senator from Kentucky  [Mr.
 MORTON]  voiced in his excellent state-
 ment in this Chamber on June 13, about
 the effectiveness of this imposing assign-
 ment given to our fleet and air units,
 especially in light of periodic reports of
 such clandestine movements that we are
 pledged  to  prevent.  The  difficulties
 involved in preventing any such move-
 ments from an island the size of Cuba
 can be seen in reverse perspective by the
 refugees who have conducted attacks
 on Cuban territory, or even more dramat-
 ically by the inability of the East Ger-
 mans and Russians to prevent escapes
 from East Berlin:
 As the President pointed out in his
 news conference of March 6, the control
 of the movement of persons to and from
 Cuba "is an action which must be taken
 by each of the countries in Latin Amer-
 ica." He said, further:
 This is the kind of thing which each coun-
 try finally has to do itself, because it is part
 of the element of sovereignty that the con-
 trol of movement is within the country of
 citizenship.                     ,
 Thus, as the President indicated, the
 effectiveness of more stringent control
 measures is predicated upon their imple-
 mentation and enforcement by all mem-
 ber states of the OAS, and particularly
 all Latin American states.
 Now, Mr. President, what are the pros-
 pects for success in this endeavor? Not
 very encouraging, in my opinion.  The
 President's hopes for the adoption of
 strengthened internal security measures
 by all OAS member states appear to have
 been. frustrated. The,report of the spe-
 cial OAS committee, from which I have
 been quoting, notes that "the nature,
 degree, and effectiveness of the control
 measures" designed to curb the flow of
 Communist arms, personnel, and, propa-
 ganda "vary from country to country."
 Since the release of this report, over a
 month ago, a further blow has been
 dealt to President Kennedy's hopes for
 mutual cooperation  among all OAS
 member states on this urgent problem.
 On July 4, the Council of the OAS,
 meeting in Washington, D.C., to consider
 the recommendations made by the spe-
 cial eight-nation OAS Committee in its
 report, displayed a serious lack of con-
 sensus or concert on these recommenda-
 tions.  While 14 members of the OAS
 Council voted for the recommendations,
 which is great, 1-Chile-voted against,
 and  4  abstained.  The  abstentions
 consisted of Mexico and Brazil-two
 of the largest countries in America and
 sites of considerable Communist activ-
 ity-Haiti, and ironically, Venezuela, the
 No. 1 target of the Castro-Communist
 insurrectionary offensive also abstained.
 Why this dissension within the OAS?
 Some observers attribute it to a distaste
 for harsh police measures which, it is
 feared, would abridge civil liberties.  I
 wish I could be charitable. In my opin-
 ion, Mr. President, this dissension is a
 direct reflection of the lack of effective
 'leadership by the United States.     Al-
 though the President has expressed his
 hopes for stronger internal      security
 measures by all OAS member states, he
 has not conveyed any real sense of ur-
 gency nor has he put any teeth in his
 expressions. In fact, Mr. President, de-
 spite the Department of State's denials,
 our Government has apparently told its
 OAS allies that is has decided to shelve
 some strong measures it had previously
 contemplated on the grounds that Castro
 has put the damper on some of his prop-
 aganda and subversive activities in re-
 cent months with the alleged result that
 tensions in the Caribbean have eased.
 This is fantastic, Mr. President. The
 barbudo-the bearded one-looks North
 and smiles at us, and we heave a great
 12179
 sigh of relief.  Hard as it is to believe,
 Mr. President, this appears to be the
 case.
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK. I yield.
 Mr. BENNETT.  I wonder if we are
 not going through the same experience
 in  Moscow  now.    Mr.  Khrushchev
 smiles at us, and we feel that all of our
 problems are solved. I wonder if we
 are not being given the same treatment,
 and that if in order not to take the smile
 off of Mr. Khrushchev's face we are very
 careful not to do anything that would
 upset the bearded one, and if under that
 situation we are not gradually putting
 ourselves into a position in which it will
 be more and more difficult for us to do
 anything,to help our Latin American
 friends.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  I am delighted that
 the distinguished Senator from Utah
 brought out that point. That is exactly
 the situation.  His point is highly per-
 tinent to the subject. I was so irritated
 the other day in seeing'a picture of our
 own special ambassador sitting and ap-
 parently having a series of good jokes
 with Mr. Khrushchev in Moscow that I
 almost decided I would try to rewrite my
 address and talk about what a complete
 terrorist Mr. Khrushchev has been dur-
 ing his lifetime of power.
 I appreciate the contribution of the
 Senator from Utah very much. He has
 described a part of the problem we are
 facing.
 The administration, which desperately
 appears to look for any sign of Commu-
 nist friendliness, has fallen for the co-
 existence line emanating from Havana.
 In this connection; Mr. President, I call
 my colleagues' attention to a dispatch
 appearing in the July 5 edition of the
 New York Times, entitled "United States
 Discards Plan on OAS Embargo Against
 Cuba Trade," which I ask unanimous
 consent to have printed in the RECORD
 at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 UNITED STATES DIS~ARDS PLAN ON OAS
 EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA TRADE
 (By Henry Raymont)
 WASHINGTON,  JULY 4.-The Kennedy ad-
 ministration has abandoned plans to ask
 the Organization of American States to de-
 clare an economic embargo against Cuba.
 This is the policy at least for the time
 being while the State Department searches
 for ways to press for the oplitical isolation
 of Cuba  and for  a sharper fight against
 Communist subversion of the hemisphere.
 U.S. officials said 2 months ago that a re-
 quest for an OAS trade ban on Cuba was
 "under active consideration" and would be
 submitted  "within  the  next  few  weeks."
 These officials now believe such a ban would
 serve no useful purpose.
 They also believe that no new measures
 will be taken against non-Communist ships
 .carrying cargoes to Cuba, even though this
 traffic has increased in recent months.
 LATIN OPPOSITION NOTED
 According to diplomatic quarters, one rea-
 son for the apparent shift in U.S. plans is the
 growing opposition of some important Latin
 American countries to Washington's policy
 in the Organization of American States.
 Diplomats  from, those countries believe
 that some U.S. requests for action against

 Cuba  were  designed  primarily  for their
 political and psychological effect and to ward
 off domestic critics of the Kennedy adminis-
 tration.
 That the mood     of  the Latin American
 governments for new measures against Cuba
 is far from unanimous was emphasized yes-
 terday.  The OAS Council was divided on a
 series of recommendations urging member
 countries to curb travel to the island and
 to establish closer security ties In the hemi-
 sphere.
 While 14 countries voted in favor of the
 recommendations, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela
 and Haiti abstained. Chile opposed the pro-
 posals on the ground that they threatened to
 establish  "police  practices"  that  would
 violate civil rights.
 One U.S. official said today that demands
 for action in the economic field at this time
 could  create difficulties within the Inter-
 American alliance far greater than the harm
 they would Inflict on Premier Fidel Castro's
 government.
 TRADE IS NOW MINIMAL
 Trade           between the  Latin-American  na-
 tions; and Cuba is minimal.  It is largely re-
 duced to shipments of Chilean garlic and
 beans in return for sugar. The administra-
 tion believed, however, that a ban on all
 trade would have dramatized Latin America's
 repudiation of the Cuban regime and height-
 ened the island's sense of isolation.
 An embargo on arms shipments to Cuba
 was adopted by the hemisphere foreign min-
 isters' conference at Punta Del Este, Uru-
 guay, in January, 1962.  The conference also
 excluded Cuba from  the activities of the
 inter-American system because of her ties
 to international Communism.
 Some Latin American diplomats link the
 decision not to press for a trade embargo to
 the administration's appraisal of Dr. Cas-
 tro's recent efforts to reduce tensions in his
 relations  with  the  United  States  and  a
 change in the atmosphere of Washington's
 relations with Moscow.
 State Department officials insist, however,
 that there has been no change in the policy
 to hasten the overthrow of Dr. Castro by all
 means short of war.  They also concede that
 his fall Is not in sight.
 RADIO SOFTENS ITS TONE
 U.S.          officials   who   have   been   anal-
 yzing Dr. Castro's offers to normalize rela-
 tions believe they are motivated by a genuine
 desire to relieve external pressures on his re-
 gime at a time when it must concentrate
 on solving pressing economic difficulties.
 They point out that Havana radio's re-
 cent broadcasts to the United States and
 Latin America have shown less aggressive-
 ness.
 Similar observations were made by Latin-
 American diplomats who recently returned
 from Cuba.    They said that Dr. Castro had
 personally assured the Governments of Braz-
 zil and Mexico that he would abandon his
 campaign  to  subvert the Latin American
 nations.
 These assurances, they said, stemmed from
 Dr. Castro's  belief that  foreign  pressures
 against him had decreased.     The diplomats
 also said Dr. Castro felt that his government
 had consolidated itself internally.
 Dr. Castro was also reported to have been
 releasing a growing number of political pri-
 soners in an effort to dispel the impression
 abroad that the island was governed by police
 terror.
 Diplomatic Informants said that an ap-
 praisal of the changing situation in Cuba was
 given to the OAS Council at a secret session
 June 28 by U. Alexis Johnson. Deputy Un-
 der Secretary of State for Political Affairs.
 According to these Informants, Mr. John-
 son said that there had been a "definite de-
 crease of tensions" in United States-Cuban
 relations.  He said Cuba no longer consti-
 tuted it military threat to the hemisphere.
 This assessment was felt by some Latin-
 American officials to differ widely from the
 report discussed yesterday by the Council.
 It suggested that Soviet and Cuban attempts
 at subversion were Increasing.
 This report was prepared by a special eight-
 nation  committee  headed  by  Ambassador
 Juan Bautista de Lavelle of Peru.  It rec-
 ommended that the hemisphere nations curb
 travel to Cuba, Increase vigilance over Com-
 munist-bloc diplomats and establish closer
 cooperation among security agencies.
 A   U.S.   official   said   the   discrepancy
 between the two reports might have been due
 to the fact that the report discussed yester-
 day was compiled In January and that "there
 may hive been some new developments since
 then."
 Mr. Johnson was also said to have told
 members of the Organization of American
 States of a "marked increase" in shipment
 to Cuba. mainly Involving vessels from Bri-
 tain, Greece. Lebanon and Norway.
 Mr. Johnson was quoted as having said
 that this  Increase was "discouraging" but
 that new action against the shippers would
 be "Ineffectual" because none of the vessels
 were  known  to  have  touched  U.S.  ports.
 Under present regulations, a vessel carrying
 goods to Cuba is barred from loading U.S.
 Government cargo.
 The Maritime Administration, in a report
 issued today. showed that 37 non-Commu-
 nist-bloc vessels arrived in Cuba in April,
 40 In May and 21 up to June 28.  In January,
 only 12 vessels made the trip.
 Mr. DOMINICK. In addition, recently
 in the July 22 edition of U.S. News &
 World Report there was published a di-
 rect quotation from an article which
 bears on what the Senator from Utah
 was saying.  The quotation is from an
 article entitled "Is a U.S. Deal With
 Russia Near?" On page 28 of the maga-
 zine there is the following quotation on
 Cuba:
 The United States for Its part Is not going
 to make strong demands about getting all the
 Russians out of Cuba. The existence of Cas-
 tro and the presence of Russians In Cuba
 are not welcomed by Mr. Kennedy, but are
 being accepted as facts of life.  Cuba in
 other words, Is not likely to upset a deal,
 provided Khrushchev keeps Russian action In
 the Island within bounds.
 I say to the senior Senator from Utah
 I Mr. BENNETTI and to all Senators that
 that is a typical example of the accom-
 modation with a most gripping and ter-
 rible menace our world has ever faced.
 Unless we point out the danger clearly
 in this country and take effective leader-
 ship against it, we will slowly but surely
 be nibbled to death as we continue In this
 overall war of attrition with the Com-
 munists.
 Mr. President, it should be self-evident
 from what I have said that the OAS can-
 not agree on stronger measures to com-
 bat the Castro-Communist offensive. It
 seems clear to me that it would do so if
 the United States were willing to show
 some urgency and back that up with
 warnings of suspension of American eco-
 nomic and other assistance pending a
 more favorable response to our wishes.
 But, Mr. President, this administration
 apparently is not willing to exercise such
 leadership. Rather, it appears willing to
 invoke the dissention within OAS as an
 excuse for not taking the lead.
 It seems clear that, at the very least,
 considerable time will pass before de-
 sirable and necessary control measures
 can be put Into effect by all the non-
 Communist states in Latin America.
 Meanwhile, insurrection will continue,
 and if the past few months offer any -
 guide, it is likely to intensify.  But we
 cannot afford a significant lapse of time.
 The challenge posed by the intensified
 Communist campaign of subversion is
 immediate and urgent.
 Where does this leave us now, Mr.
 President?  In the absence of a deter-
 mined effort to defeat the Communist
 campaign of subversion, we are falling
 back on the Alliance for Progress.  In
 fact, we are told, this is the program that
 ultimately will turn the tide in our
 favor-provided, I hasten to add, that
 the Communists throughout Latin Amer-
 lea cease their disruptive activities, roll
 over, and play dead.  This contention,
 that only the economic and social devel-
 opment of Latin America can defeat this
 campaign, is based on a number of ques-
 tionable premises.  These premises are
 myths to.me, and it is to these myths
 that I now turn.
 Throughout the continuing controvery
 over U.S. policy with respect to Cuba-
 most recently, right here on the floor of
 the Senate-facts have too often been
 submerged in a flood of myths.  And
 some myths die hard. I would not want
 to conclude my remarks today without
 countering one such long-lived myth-
 and one with special relevance to the
 question, of effective action to thwart the
 Communist offensive in this hemisphere
 against free and self-governing nations.
 There-is nothing mythical about this
 offensive, as I have already demon-
 strated.  It  is  underway,  no-holds-
 barred so far as the Communists are con-
 cerned. They are grimly determined to
 bury all free nations in this hemisphere
 by every possible means.  The peril is
 clear and the danger present.
 Nor Is there anything mythical about
 Castro's Cuba-the territorial and ideo-
 logical base of this massive Communist
 thrust.  I have offered abundant docu-
 mentation of this fact as well, documen-
 tation that can be neither -wished nor
 winked out of existence.  To blunt the
 Communist offensive, there is one utterly
 indispensable first step: this advance
 base of world communism must be elim-
 inated. Cuba must once more rejoin the
 community of free nations.
 Let us have no delusions on that
 score-unpleasant as the facts may be.
 But then the question arises: what Is
 the raw material on which this offensive
 feeds?  Why should the Republics of
 this hemisphere provide such ready tar-
 gets for the appeals of communism?
 What are the vulnerabilities open to
 Communist exploitation?  Why, specif-
 ically, did Cuba fall prey to the Castro
 dictatorship?
 And here is where the myths begin to
 take over from hard facts. And here are
 the premises on which our policy of pro-
 crastination is based. As a case in point,
 I cite the following remarks by the Sen-
 ator from Idaho LMr. CHURCH), delivered
 In this Chamber on June 17, when my
 senior colleague [Mr. ALLOTTI proposed
 that a provisional Government of Free
 Cuba be spurred into formation, to spear-
 .head ultimate Cuban liberation. This is

 what was said by the Senator from
 Idaho [Mr. CHURCH].
 I wish to make it very clear that I
 called the Senator from Idaho [Mr.
 CHURCH] before I came to the floor, to
 tell him I was going to make these re-
 marks.  I quote what the Senator from
 Idaho said:
 I am sure that had it not been for the
 dissatisfaction of the peons in Cuba, who
 worked on the great sugar plantations, it
 would never have been possible for Castro
 to have achieved the popular support-the
 grassroots support-that enabled  him to
 overthrow Batista.
 Let us examine this flat assertion of
 "fact" opinion-and identify the myths
 hidden away in it.
 Myth No. 1: That pre-Castro Cuba
 was a nation of oppressed and impover-
 ished peasants, on the brink of mass dis-
 content and latent revolt.  Now, this is
 a beguiling notion-but it simply is not
 true. Pre-Castro Cuba was no paradise,
 no promised land of social and economic
 democracy, but neither was it a sink of
 poverty and mass misery.  Indeed, it
 was not even a rural-based country;
 nearly 60 percent of the population lived
 in the towns and cities.  Its per capita
 income ranked fourth among all Latin
 American countries-much higher, for
 example, than that of postwar Japan and
 about on a par with postwar Italy.  In
 the words of a leading Cuban Commu-
 nist-a Communist source, let me stress:
 In reality, Cuba was not one of the coun-
 tries with the lowest standard of living of
 the masses in America but, on the contrary,
 one of those with the highest.
 And, as a recognized American au-
 thority.on this subject, Theodore Draper,
 has concluded:
 Cuba was one of the most middleclass
 countries in Latin America.
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. President; will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK. I am delighted to
 yield.
 Mr. BENNETT. The last statement,
 that Cuba was one of the leading middle-
 class countries in Latin America, may
 hold the key to the reason why the Com-
 munists chose to attack it, because one
 of the functions of the Communist rev-
 olution is to destroy the middle class.
 I think this may be a very significant
 factor in the situation.
 Mr. DOMINICK,  I agree with the
 Senator from Utah. There is no doubt
 that one of the main aims of communism
 is to knock out all middle-class person-
 nel and the economic system we have
 built up from the economic bases of this
 country.
 There is another myth hidden away
 in the statement made by the Senator
 from Idaho [Mr. CHURCH].
 -Myth No. 2: That the Castro revolu-
 tion depended upon an outpouring of
 grassroots  support-and  specifically,
 peasant  support.  Once  again,  this
 simply does not square with the facts.
 The Cuban revolution, led-or rather
 perverted-by Castro, was essentially a
 middle-class revolution, sparked. and
 manned by students, by young profes-
 sionals, and by artisans and urban work-
 ers, and taken over by Communists from
 within.  Quoting again from Theodore
 Draper:
 The peasantry never had in its hands any
 of the levers of command of the revolution,
 before or after the victory.  The revolution
 was made and always controlled by declassed
 sons and daughters of the middle class.
 It was apparent that the people who
 wished to overthrow the fascist dictator
 type, Batista, were used as a part of
 the Communist machinations to destroy
 themselves.
 Mr. BENNETT.   Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  I am glad to yield.
 Mr. BENNETT.   Did Castro come from
 the peasant class?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  He did not.
 Mr. BENNETT.   Was he a doctor of
 laws?
 Mr. DOMINICK. I think the Senator
 is correct.  He was a doctor of laws.
 There is no secret about these facts
 and, at this late date, no room for real
 disagreement or delusion. Authoritative
 documentation Is readily at hand. I in-
 vite the attention of my colleagues in this
 connection to the first chapter of Theo-
 dore Draper's excellent study, "Castro's
 Revolution: Myths and Realities," pub-
 lished in 1962 by Frederick Praeger.
 But both these myths, misleading as
 they are and however destructive of so-
 ber debate, are relatively minor when
 compared with myth No. 3; and that
 is that the appeal of communism is pri-
 marily economic, and that its road to
 power is paved with human misery, pov-
 erty, illiteracy, and mass discontent.
 This is the false idea of "stomach"
 communism.  It is, at best, a half-
 truth-it may help explain the avowed
 goals of communism, but never, in no
 single case, its dynamic origins.  We
 have in our hands the clear record of
 many years of systematic Communist
 subversion and militant political warfare.
 And what is incredible is the need still
 again to have to reiterate the facts and
 thus blow down the myth.
 But the need is urgent because the
 myth of "stomach" communism is not
 only enduring: but it is also influential.
 And influential at the very highest levels
 of the executive establishment.
 It is, I submit, the major premise un-
 derlying the Alliance for Progress-
 which, together with other aid pro-
 grams, the administration has so vastly
 and so dangerously oversold as the pana-
 cea for all the ills that now beset the free
 world, and, in particular, the third world
 of underdeveloped nations. Such prog-
 ress of mutual development-assuming
 they are ever effectively implemented-
 hold out great. long-term hope for basic
 economic growth and stability. But they
 must follow tougher and more urgent
 problems. They must supplement rather
 than supplant efforts to obtain our im-
 mediate goals: not only the removal of
 the Soviet presence from this hemisphere
 but also the liberation of Cuba from
 Communist tyranny.
 It is the myth of "stomach" commu-
 nism that beguiles us into believing that
 to counteract subversion, humanitarian
 sympathy will do the job; that wiping
 out illiteracy is the same as cutting off
 systematic infiltration by trained cadres
 of the Communist underground; that to
 eradicate poverty is to block Commu-
 nist penetration into every free republic
 in this hemisphere.  It is the myth, in
 brief, that half-measures can blunt the
 thrust of world Communist aggression.
 It is the illusion that massive expendi-
 tures can substitute for a militant will to
 win.  It is, I suggest, an invitation to
 disaster.
 And yet, Mr. President, it may easily
 be that it is this same type of myth dis-
 aster that this administration appears
 to be courting.  On July 9, during the
 colloquy . that  followed  the  brilliant
 speech by my senior colleague        [Mr.
 ALLOTT], I called attention to an Allen-
 Scott report which alleged that the ad-
 ministration was contemplating a major
 shift in policy toward Cuba whereby, in
 return for the withdrawal of Soviet
 troops from Cuba at a later date, the
 United States would gradually resume
 diplomatic  and  commercial relations
 with the Castro regime. The text of that
 report is on pages 11596 and 11597 of the
 July 9 edition of the RECORD.
 I commented- at the time that we
 should have a clear, unequivocal answer
 as to the veracity of this report, and I
 was joined in that view by the distin-
 guished Senator from Iowa [Mr. HICK-

 SHIFT IN U.S. POLICY ON CASTRO
 WASHINGTON.-President Kennedy is de-
 liberating a gradual shift in U.S. policy to-
 ward                                                                                                                                                                  Dictator Fidel  Castro's  Communist
 regime in Cuba.
 For more than a month, the President and
 his top foreign policy advisers have been
 discussing a plan under which the United
 States would resume                              contact with Castro
 on both an informal and formal basis.
 Under this backstage scheme, New York
 Attorney James Donovan, who negotiated the
 $53 million ransom of the ill-fated Bay of
 Pigs invasion prisoners, would fly to Havana
 and Moscow to seek the withdrawal of all
 Soviet combat forces from Cuba.
 In exchange for their removal, the United
 States would agree to a step-by-step nor-
 malization of diplomatic and trade relations
 with the Red-ruled Castro dictatorship over
 a 2-year period.
 As a first step, the United States would
 reopen its Embassy in Havana by sending a
 Charge d'Affaires there.  At present the Swiss
 Ambassador is handling U.S. affairs.
 An exchange of Ambassadors and lifting of
 the trade embargo against Castro would fol-
 low after sufficient time had elapsed to make
 such a drastic readjustment palatable to the
 people and Congress.
 This far-reaching shift in Cuban relations
 is part of President Kennedy's policy of seek-
 ing accommodations  with  Russia  and  its
 satellite bloc for the avowed purpose of re-
 ducing the risk of nuclear war by moderating
 tensions.
 White House  insiders  say the  proposed
 switch in  Cuba  policy fits squarely with
 strategy enunciated recently by the Presi-

 dent in a speech that "any plan of action
 in the Caribbean has to take Into account
 conditions and potential developments be-
 tween the United States and the U.S.S.R."
 THE NEGOTIATOR
 The President favors 47-year-old Donovan
 for this highly explosive diplomatic mission
 for two reasons:  his acceptability to Cas-
 tro and Khrushchev. and his close ties with
 key administration officials, notably Attorney
 General Robert Kennedy.
 After Donovan arranged the swap of So-
 viet Spy Abel for U-2 Pilot Francis Gary
 Powers, the President wrote him, "The type
 of negotiations you undertook, where diplo-
 matic  channels  had  been  unavailing,  Is
 unique, and you conducted it with the great-
 est skill and courage.'
 Castro's enthusiasm for Donovan Is about
 on a par with that of the President. In
 feelers through diplomatic channels to the
 State Department, the Cuban dictator has
 indicated he would accept Donovan as ne-
 gotiator.  Words to that effect have been
 conveyed on three separate occasions--March
 8. May 12, and May 18.
 A decision on this momentous scheme will
 not be made until after the President returns
 from his European trip.
 By that time the White House staff hopes
 to know whether the House Foreign Affairs
 Committee will undertake an Inquiry Into
 Donovan's previous Cuban negotiations.  Re-
 publican committeemen are vigorously press-
 ing for such an investigation.  They have
 strongly urged it in a joint letter to Repre-
 sentative  THOMAS  MORGAN,  Democrat,                       of
 Pennsylvania, chairman.
 CUBAN FLASHES
 Richard Goodwin, freewheeling Executive
 Secretary of the international Peace Corps,
 is still on the State Department's payroll.
 The  House Appropriations Committee has
 ascertained that Goodwin is drawing $19,-
 856 as Assistant Secretary of State for In-
 ter-American Affairs, although he left that
 post more than 4 months ago.  Meanwhile.
 Sterling Cotrell, who replaced Goodwin, is
 being paid by the Bureau of Far Eastern Af-
 fairs.  The House committee began checking
 Goodwin's pay as Congress voted down his
 request for $80.000 to set up the new Peace
 Corps organization.   At  a  meeting  with
 British officials. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., spe-
 cial               Assistant to the President, described
 U.S. policy on Cuba along these lines: The
 first objective is to clean up our own back-
 yard In Central and South America by vig-
 orous implementation of the Alliance for
 Progress.  The second objective Is to bring
 isolated Cuba back into the Organization of
 American States as a chastened. cooperating
 member.  (Nice tricks, if they can be pulled
 off.)
 Intelligence reports that around  100.000
 Cubans are in Castro's jails for refusing to
 accept communism.  Also that some 250,000
 Cubans have fled, and another 160,000 are
 awaiting  approval and  transportation   to
 leave. Senator JOHN STENNIS' Armed Serv-
 ices Preparedness Subcommittee Is preparing
 a new report on Castro-Communist subver-
 sion, sabotage, and guerrilla warfare against
 Latin American countries.  The report, slated
 for release next month, will warn that Castro
 has ordered an increase in these operations.
 Although  Castro has loudly  proclaimed
 fealty and devotion to Russia, a so-called
 Cuban "scientific delegation," beaded by a
 Capt. Antonio Nunez Jlminez, is en route to
 Red China, ostensibly for "study and obser-
 vation" purposes.  Beer bottles have become
 so scarce in Communist Cuba that the out-
 put of beer has been seriously affected.  Ap-
 parently there is no lack of beer, but there
 aren't enough bottles to hold it.  In an effort
 to overcome this shortage, the "Revolution-
 ary Taxicab Drivers Association" of Santiago
 has pleged to collect beer bottles free of
 charge.   Presumably  the  cab     drivers  will
 devote their spare time to rounding up
 empty bottles.  Russia. whose agriculture Is
 notoriously In difficulty, is sending around
 100 so-called farm "specialists" to help Cuba
 with Its mounting agricultural headaches-a
 clear-cut Instance of the Incompetent aiding
 the inadequate.
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Mr. President, I
 reiterate my call for an answer now.
 Just what is the role of James Donovan
 in our sub rasa contacts with the Castro
 regime? Is there any foundation to the
 report  of  the  administration's  major
 policy shift?  These questions demand
 and deserve clear, authoritative, and im-
 mediate answers.
 Cuba will never be liberated by a pro-
 gram of long-term investment In the
 economic development of Latin America.
 There has never been any country, once
 taken over by Communist aggression,
 which has ever been freed without out-
 side assistance.  As a supplementary
 and supporting measure, yes; but first
 must come the liberation of that op-
 pressed land from the grip of Commu-
 nist tyranny.    And until the day of
 Cuban liberation, the Communist offen-
 sive In this hemisphere will move for-
 ward-implacably and with mounting
 peril to hemispheric and U.S. security.
 Toward the goal of Cuban liberation,
 the proposal put forward by my distin-
 guished senior colleague [Mr. ALLoTT]
 is a major contribution. I commend him
 for his bold initiative and for his tough-
 minded penetration to the real target.
 I add my appeal to his: Let us debate this
 proposal and consider it on its merits.
 Let us also debate the proposals of the
 Senator from Nebraska [Mr. CURTIS] and
 the Senator from South Dakota [Mr.
 MUNDT].   If the administration has a
 better plan of action, well and good. But
 In either case, lot us get on with the
 urgent business at hand-to translate the
 hardened will of the American people
 into effective action, And to do it before
 the Inter-American defense system be-
 comes the  graveyard of free world
 security.
 Let us implement the President's state-
 ment that we will do whatever is neces-
 sary to prevent the export of Communist
 aggression. Heaven knows we are not
 doing it now, and we need to take action.
 Everyone knows there is only one way
 to do this-restoration of a free Cuba.
 Mr. ALLOTT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DOMINICK. I yield to my distin-
 guished colleague.
 Mr. ALLOTT.  I read to the Senator
 the President's statement:
 It continues to be the policy of the United
 States that the Castro regime will not be
 allowed to export its aggressive purposes by
 force or the threat of force.  It will be pre-
 vented by whatever means may be necessary
 from taking action against any part of the
 Western Hemisphere.
 Does the Senator Interpret that state-
 ment as meaning the President believes
 the present actions of Cuba do not con-
 stitute aggressive threats against this
 country and against this hemisphere?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  All I can say is that
 the lack of action of any kind by us
 would certainly seem to Indicate that the
 President does not think this is export
 of Communist aggression.  How he can
 come to that conclusion I cannot under-
 stand.  If he does not mean this, he
 must mean a shift in policy.
 Mr. ALLOTT.  My  colleague later
 quoted the President again when he
 said, In substance, that the armed forces
 of the hemisphere-and I refer to the
 quotation used by my colleague-includ-
 ing our own, are made available to in-
 sure that arms that are now in Cuba
 will not be shipped outside Cuba.
 Has the Senator any doubt that arms
 in Cuba, which originated from Czech-
 oslovakia and Russia, are being trans-
 ported, and that Implements of sabo-
 tage are now being transported, all over
 the Latin American part of this whole
 hemisphere?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  There is absolutely
 no doubt in my mind.  I would add to
 what my distinguished colleague has said
 that not only arms in conventional
 terms, physical weapons, but arms from
 the standpoint of Communist indoctri-
 nation, and persons trained in guerrilla
 warfare, people being brought in and
 shipped back, methods and promoting
 revolt, are being exported by Castro as
 rapidly as he can do It.
 Mr. ALLOTT.  The Senator is correct.
 There Is one thing most people have a
 harder time understanding, and that is
 the means of subversion that the Sen-
 ator has emphasized, but there can be
 no question In anybody's mind that hard
 arms are being exported throughout the
 hemisphere.
 I have another question, or perhaps
 two.  Can the Senator see any practical
 difference between the net end effect
 proposed in the statement of Blas Roca
 and the net end effect of conventional
 warfare?
 The thought in my mind-and I do not
 know whether It occurs to my colleague-
 is that, so far as the net end result in
 this hemisphere is concerned, such a
 statement would have exactly the same
 net end result as would conventional
 warfare.  Is there any question about
 this in the Senator's mind?
 Mr. DOMINICK.  Not only is the Sen-
 ator's statement absolutely correct, but
 I would say that such action has the
 probability of being more aggressive
 than  conventional warfare,  because
 Castro would be beaten in conventional
 warfare. As long as he can confine it at
 that level, he will never be beaten.
 Mr. ALLOTT.     If he instituted con-
 ventional warfare he would Immediately
 arouse the opposition of every country
 In Latin America, whereas this kind is
 warfare by attrition, day by day, week
 by week, and month by month.
 I congratulate my distinguished col-
 league for participating In this continu-
 ing debate upon Cuba.  So far the ad-
 ministration has seen fit to practically
 put Its head in the sand and ignore the
 fact of what exists in Cuba.
 It seems to me the real contribution
 of the Senator consists of two parts. The
 first is calling to the minds of Americans
 again the hard facts of what we are fac-
 ing and what exists In Cuba.  The sec-
 ond Is the. diabolical myth of "stomach"
 communism, which was pointed out so
 well in the second part of the Senator's
 speech.  He has rendered real service.
 I hope he will not cease in his efforts to
