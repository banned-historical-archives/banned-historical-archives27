 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 MMaTgh-.,,964
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 Moscow's effort to main-
 tain a conciliatory attitude
 prior to the summit was evident
 in its handling of the issue of
 passes for the Allied military
 liaison missions accredited to
 Soviet forces in East Germany.
 The announcement on 14 March,
 which rescinded the passes con-
 taining references to registra-
 tion with the "German Democratic
 Republic," appears designed to
 portray the move as a pre-sum-
 mit concession, in order not to
 "worsen the atmosphere between
 the great powers."
 Moscow probably considered
 that the highly publicized dis-
 pute had become counterproduc-
 tive, particularly in the light
 of Khrushchev's public statement
 of 5 March calling on all states
 to refrain from any action which
 could endanger the favorable
 pre-summit Atmosphere. The So-
 viet leadership probably con-
 cluded that the American an-
 nouncement that there would be
 no high-altitude flights to
 Berlin at this time and the
 Western statement on 12 March
 recalling Khrushchev's state-
 ment placed the USSR in an in-
 creasingly unfavorable position
 on this issue.
 Privately, Moscow has at-
 tempted to gain some advantage
 from the dispute by linking the
 duration of the validity of the
 original passes to the over-all
 solution of the questions at
 the summit. General Vorontsov
 informed the Western military
 officials of this on 14 March.
 Moscow apparently intends to
 retain this issue as an element
 of pressure on the West.
 Soviet efforts to appear
 conciliatory were also appar-
 ent in the prompt rescheduling
 of the Khrushchev visit to
 France in order to forestall
 speculation of a possible "dip-
 lomatic illness."  Khrushchev's
 illness appears to be genuine.
 Foreign Minister Gromyko in-
 formed a Western ambassador that
 the Soviet leader was indisposed,
 and a Soviet doctor told an-
 other member of the diplomatic
 corps that Khrushchev has had
 a severe case of the grippe.
 French Foreign Minister
 Couve de Murville feels that
 Germany and Berlin will be the
 main items in Khrushchev's talks
 with De Gaulle, He also believes
 that the Algerian question will
 be raised by Khrushchev and not
 the French, but that this will
 lead to a general discussion of
 Africa--particularly Guinea.
 Disarmament will also be on the
 agenda, according to the for-
 eign minister.
 Soviet bloc officials are
 also continuing their efforts
 privately to encourage Western
 apprehension over some definite
 Soviet action on a separate
 peace treaty after the summit
 conference.  An East German of-
 ficial spelled out the detailed
 "consequences of such action,"
 listing specifically road
 tolls and rail transit fees
 among the measures that East
 Germany would undertake to
 isolate West Berlin.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Zorin portrayed the Soviet plan
 as "a radical solution" which
 has gained world-wide support
 and a unanimous UN endorsement.
 While indicating that the Soviet
 Government would consider amend-
 ments to Khrushchev's plan as
 well as other proposals, Zorin's
 strong criticism of the Western
 plan suggests that Moscow will-
 reject it as the basis for nego-
 tiation on the grounds that it
 is an inadequate response to
 the conference's objective of
 negotiating a treaty for "gen-
 eral and complete disarmament."
 Zorin's call for "an under-
 standing, first of all, on the
 basic provisions of a general
 treaty" indicates that his im-
 mediate objective is to estab-
 lish the Soviet proposal as the
 first agenda item by obtaining
 Western agreement "in principle"
 to general and complete dis-
 armament as the main task.of
 the conference.   In his greeting
 to the conference, Khrushchev
 emphasized this approach by
 stressing the "earliest draft-
 ing" of practical methods for
 "total and universal disarma-
 ment" as the purpose for con-
 vening the conference.
 The Soviet delegate to the
 nuclear test talks last week
 hinted broadly that the USSR
 would accept the American pro-
 posal of 11 February for a lim-
 ited treaty if the United States
 would agree to a moratorium on
 small underground tests below
 the threshold set by the Ameri-
 can plan.   Such an arrangement
 in effect would result in the
 comprehensive treaty banning
 all tests which Moscow has long
 advocated.
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin
 sought to increase pressure on
 the United States to accept such
 a moratorium by attempting to
 demonstrate that a split exists
 between the two Western powers
 on this issue.   He observed that
 an agreement could be quickly
 reached if the United States
 would make it clear that the
 threshold proposal is designed
 only to bring about a gradual
 extension of control measures
 to cover all testing.   Tsarap-
 kin pressed the Western dele-
 gates either to confirm this
 interpretation of the American
 plan or to acknowledge that the
 plan was intended to legalize
 small underground tests.
 This question drew a state-
 ment from the British delegate
 reserving his position on what
 Britain's attitude would be to-
 ward tests below the threshold.
 In contrast, the American dele-
 gate declared there would be
 no legal prohibition on such
 tests.   A British delegation
 spokesman subsequently inter-
 preted Tsarapkin's statement
 as a hint that Moscow would
 accept a treaty based on the
 American threshold proposal if
 this were combined with a
 moratorium on tests below the
 threshold.
 The Soviet delegation pre-
 sumably will be encouraged to
 continue these tactics by the
 British delegate's statement
 in the 14 March meeting which
 described Tsarapkin's statement
 as "important, significant,
 and potentially encouraging."
 The Soviet leaders have
 been holding a proposal for a
 moratorium on small underground
 explosions in reserve for some

 Moscow may feel that, in
 view
 of a possible
 Easter re-
 cess,
 the time has
 come for
 some move to isolate the main
 issues at the conference and
 to set the stage for a com-
 Iraq
 promise proposal which Khru-
 shchev can press at the sum-
 mit. Any Soviet proposal would
 probably tie acceptance of the
 American plan, accompanied by

 pendulum continues to swing
 against the Iraqi Communists,
 albeit slowly.   There are in-
 dications that the Communist-
 front Republican party's ap-
 plication for legalization is
 running into difficulties with
 the anti-Communist Interior Min-
 istry.   No word has been forth-
 coming about the results of the
 orthodox Communists' appeal to
 Qasim for reconsideration of
 their application for status.
 Qasim may side-step this thorny
 problem by referring their case
 to the Court of Cassation,  Iraq's
 highest appeal court, which is
 unlikely to issue a verdict
 against Qasim's wishes.
 A new sign that the Qasim
 government is seeking a more
 truly neutral policy between
 the Soviet bloc and the West is
 a request sent to the American
 Embassy seeking assistance to
 fill 230 teaching positions at
 Baghdad University, as an al-
 ternative to hiring more Soviet
 bloc personnel.
 Jordan-UAR-Iraq
 With military tensions
 further relaxed between the UAR
 and Israel, attention in the
 area has been increasingly fo-
 cused on the acrimonious inter-
 Arab quarrel over the Palestine
 issue.  The UAR and Iraq have

 each made independent proposals
 for creation of a separate Pal-
 estinian ! 4tate."  Jordan -hta
 vigorously opposed these pro-
 posals because, by encouraging
 separatist tendencies, they
 tend to jeopardize Jordanian
 control of the Palestinian West
 Bank, which was annexed in 1950.
 King Husayn, as a means
 of undercutting the persistent
 UAR    and  Iraqi  -propaganda,
 now has anudnced willingness
 to hold a West Bank plebiscite.
 He would offer Jordan's Pales-
 tinians the choice of a separate
 Palestine state, affiliation
 with another Arab state, or
 continued association with Jor-
 dan.   According to his plan,
 a "large and representative"
 assembly of people from the
 West Bank is to be convened in
 Jerusalem.   If this assembly
 elects to have a plebiscite,
 Husayn has said he would call
 on the Arab League, and pos-
 sibly the UN, to conduct and
 supervise it.
 UAR Deputy Foreign Minis-
 ter Dhu al-'Figar Sabri began
 the first leg of his two-month
 good-will tour of Latin America
 with a stop in Havana last week.
 The Cuban visit ended on 15
 March with a press conference
 in which Sabri is reported to
 have proclaimed that Cairo is
 prepared to "discuss" the pos-
 sible dispatch of men and arms
 to Cuba in the event of a for-
 eign invasion.   In another re-
 mark calculated to curry Cuban
 favor, he announced that the
 UAR will vote for Cuba's nom-
 ination to a Security Council
 seat.   Cairo has already con-
 cluded a sizable cotton-sugar
 barter deal with Havana.
 The UAR Government has
 shown somewhat more restraint
 in other dealings with the
 Castro regime.   Cairo also ap-
 pears to be giving cautious
 treatment to Castro's plans for
 a highly publicized Havana con-
 ference of underdeveloped na-
 tions.
 Sabri's tour, which will
 include 14 countries, was pre-
 ceded by an intensive effort by
 Cairo to strengthen its diplo-
 matic representation in Latin
 America.  UAR missions have been
 established in nine countries,
 and eight more are under nego-
 tiation.                                                                 Cairo hopes to gain
 Latin American sympathy for its
 neutralist. policies and support
 in the various controversies in
 which it is involved in the
 United Nations.
 Cairo's Al Akhbar, respond-
 ing to a New York Times article
 expressing some concern over Sab-
 ri's trip, stated on 14 March
 that "there is nothing of an un-
 friendly nature directed against
 the United States or any other
 state in a rapprochement between
 the Arabs and Latin America."
 Most of the UAR's missions, how-
 ever, have leaned rather heavily
 on an anti-imperialist line,
 which has a spec al anti-US con-
 notation in Latin America.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 . 17, mjtroh ,1.960
 The official visit to Cairo of
 Panamanian Foreign Minister Mi-
 guel Moreno during his current
 ten-nation world tour: and
 the recent appointment-of 'a
 Panamanian: minister to the UAR
 are further indications 1.0f-
 ':in-creasingly close UAR-Panamanian
 ties.
 The UAR has made less not-
 able progress in courting other
 Latin American states, but there
 is no sign of a letup in its ef-
 forts.   Large Arab minorities
 throughout the area are a special
 target of UAR propaganda, and
 the various missions continue
 to expand cultural activities
 aimed at these groups.  Anti-
 Zionist propaganda is also a
 prominent weapon of the UAR dip-
 lomats. Sabri probably will also
 seek to encourage exchanges of
 high-level personages.
 COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN CUBA
 Cuba is becoming the cen-
 ter of Communist activity in
 Latin America.   A hemisphere
 peace conference under the
 auspices of the Communist-front
 World Peace Council is being
 planned for Havana in May or
 June, and the Communist hand is
 also evident in the "Friends
 of Cuba" societies being formed
 in most Latin American countries.
 Communist bloc propaganda con-
 tinues its active support of
 Castro,, and Cuba's economic,
 labor, and cultural contacts
 with the bloc are increasing.
 Representatives of seven
 Latin American affiliates of
 the Communist-front World Peace
 Council (WPC) met with Soviet
 and French WPC members in Ha-
 vana from 9 to 12 March to plan
 a hemispheric, peace conference
 there in May or June.   Such a
 conference would implement
 plans made by Latin American
 Communists meeting in Moscow at
 the time of the Soviet 21st
 party congress in early 1959
 to strengthen the "peace move-
 ment" and to promote a "peo-
 ples' congress."
 countries attended the plenary
 session of the Cuban Communist
 party (PSP) in early March.
 During the meeting, the PSP an-
 nounced its support for the
 "week of solidarity with the
 struggles of the Latin American
 peoples" which the Communist-
 infiltrated Cuban Labor Confed-
 eration has called for later
 this month.
 Cultural and propaganda
 activities by the "Friends of
 Cuba" societies being formed
 in most Latin American coun-
 tries are promoted through the
 Cuban Casa de las Americas, run
 by the pro-Communist wife of
 the minister of education.
 Castro's subsidized press agency,
 Prensa Latina, cooperates in
 these efforts.   The societies
 attract leftist, non-Communist
 groups who still see Castro as
 a hopeful example, but they
 are in effect Communist fronts.
 The Sino-Soviet bloc con-
 tinues its active support of
 Castro, particularly in the
 propaganda and economic fields.
 The New China News Agency, TASS,
 and other bloc news sources
 Communist leaders from                promptly report Castro's anti-
 several other Latin American SECRET charges, reflecting the close

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY 8MMARY
 17 March 1960
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 New terrorist bombings
 have contributed to the atmos-
 phere of unrest in Argentina
 prior to the 27 March elections
 for some municipal offices and
 one half of the Chamber of Dep-
 uties; these elections will be
 the first national vote on
 President Frondizi's policies.
 As on a number of other occa-
 sions since he took office in
 May 1958, Frondizi is faced
 with reports of plotting by
 several groups, vitriolic crit-
 icism by opposition political
 parties, and strong economic
 complaints by both business and
 labor.
 Emergency security measures
 subjecting saboteurs and ter-
 rorists to military tribunals
 were instituted on 14 March,
 immediately after a bomb de-
 stroyed an army intelligence
 officer's home, killing one
 child.   Within the week,  ter-
 rorists also killed a family of
 three living near an army arse-
 nal which was bombed; they also
 caused an eight-hour fire in the
 state gas company and damaged
 a major rail line.
 The President ordered the
 armed forces on alert on 15
 March and warned that military
 courts could impose a death sen-
 tence--a drastic step in the
 light of Argentina's strong op-
 position to capital punishment.
 An executive decree effective
 16 March declaring a "situation
 of serious emergency"formalized
 these steps, which were to be
 limited to terrorism and to ex-
 clude normal political and labor
 activities.
 The decree and extensive
 raids on Peronista strongholds
 also probably reflect extreme
 caution in view of reports of
 Peronista and Communist revo-
 lutionary plotting,  including
 possible attacks by Peronista
 "guerrillas" centered in north-
 western Argentina. There are
 only vague reports on the
 strength of the "guerrillas,"
 who are said to be mainly youths
 belonging to the "Peronista Na-
 tional Liberating Movement," but
 the recent rise in the theft of
 arms may have increased concern
 over this group.
 Peronista leaders have con-
 tinued to exploit labor. for
 political purposes and have
 stressed that the'"Justicia-
 lista party" is synonymous with
 the outlawed Peronista party
 and "recognizes the same chief."
 This defiance has resulted in
 constant military pressure on
 Frondizi to curtail Peronista
 activities, thus prejudicing ef-
 forts to attract the Peronistas
 into his Intransigent Radical
 party.
 The Peronistas and Commu-
 nists, reacting to Frondizi's
 call for proscription of their
 candidates, have been campaign-
 ing for a heavy protest blank
 vote to exceed the vote received
 by Frondizi's party.   Peronista
 strength has declined to about
 25 to 30 percent of the electo-
 rate since Peron was ousted.   The
 blank vote, however, is not en-
 tirely Peronista, since a few
 other parties have advocated
 this means of protest in some
 of the 1959 and 1960 provincial
 elections.
 Frondizi sees the blank
 vote as reducing competition for
 the 32 seats his party must win

 to retain control of the Chamber

 97 seats.   Frondizi admits a
 loss of popularity because of
 discontent, particularly over
 austerity measures under the
 US-backed stabilization pro-
 gram.  While the impact of the
 program has been more severe
 than Frondizi anticipated, he
 hopes its benefits will become
 evident before the Senate elec-
 tions next year.
 ALGERIAN CEASE-FIRE PROSPECTS
 The Algerian rebel attitude
 toward a cease-fire appears to
 have hardened in the wake of
 De Gaulle's implicit rejection
 of rebel peace proposals call-
 ing for joint French-rebel ad-
 ministration of an Algerian
 referendum.   The rebels will
 probably now step up their ef-
 forts to "internationalize"
 the war  and to improve their
 diplomatic contacts, including
 those with Communist China
 and the USSR. Despite their
 recent rebuff, the Algerians
 probably plan to make new ap-
 proaches to De Gaulle whenever
 they feel conditions are more
 favorable, perhaps after weigh-
 ing the results of the summit
 conference.
 Premier Ferhat Abbas, in
 a statement issued on 14 March,
 stated that De Gaulle's recent
 pronouncements had "closed the
 door to negotiations and peace
 in Algeria," and reiterated
 rebel demands that guarantees
 of the fair application of
 self-determination must pre-
 cede any cease-fire.  De Gaulle,
 in statements to the French
 Army between 3 and 5 March,
 called for continued pacifica-
 tion and endorsed Algeria's
 continued association with
 France.   Charging that De
 Gaulle "fears the popular ver-
 dict" in Algeria, Abbas pledged
 a continuation of the war "un-
 til the attainment of our in-
 dependence."
 The rebels probably view
 De Gaulle's recent public state
 ments as his reply to their
 overtures concerning a cease-
 fire made in late February.
 The rebels are believed to have
 proposed
 a     ere be an
 imme  a e cease-fire based on
 a withdrawal of rebel forces
 25X1
 25X1
 to areas near the Tunisian and
 Moroccan borders.  Within a
 year of the cease-fire, a
 referendum to determine Algeria's
 future relationship with France
 would be held, supervised by
 the French, the Algerians, and
 a third party to be designated.
 The rebels probably view
 this offer--which reportedly
 was acceptable to rebel mili-
 tary-commanders as well as
 political leaders--as the most
 reasonable which they could
 reconcile with their own in-
 terests.   In view of De Gaulle's
 continued refusal to discuss
 such terms, however, the rebels
 probably will renew their ef-
 forts to "internationalize"
 the war through anti-French
 resolutions in the United Na-
 tions and demonstrations of
 Arab unity such as the proposed
 Arab Legion of "volunteers" for
 the Algerian fighting.   Rebel
 spokesmen have also stated their
 intention of broadening diplo-
 matic contacts  and have in-
 dicated that the rebels were
 considering the appointment
 of an ambassador to Communist
 China, with which they desire
 the "closest possible relations."
 Peiping probably would

 DE GAULLE'S FARM PROBLEM
 In France, 300, ?00 peopl.o
 have demonstrated in recent
 months against the Debre gov-
 ernment's refusal to tie the
 price of farm products to a
 general cost-of-living index.
 The government's stand has
 sparked  a  demand by a majori-
 ty            of   the  deputies   in  the
 National Assembly for a special
 session.   President de Gaulle is
 opposed to this and may seek
 to delay convening parliament
 until its scheduled opening
 on 26 April, but his political
 opponents are trying to use
 the farm issue to embarrass
 the government on unrelated
 questions such as Algeria, the
 Khrushchev visit, and the role
 of parliament under the Fifth
 Republic.
 The aggressive National
 Federation of Farmers' Unions
 (FNSEA) has been increasingly
 effective in making French
 peasants aware of agricultural
 economics and in propagandizing
 farm woes.   Agricultural in-
 terests had secured in 1957 a
 system of guaranteed minimum
 prices for farm products based
 on the price of goods used in
 agriculture, on the cost of
 living,  and on general wage
 rates.   De Gaulle abolished this
 in December 1958.
 Since then industrial prices
 and urban prosperity have

 Debre has expressly ruled out
 any "general and automatic mech-
 anism" as inflationary, and De
 Gaulle told the farmers in
 February they must modernize
 their production and cut costs.
 The government's program is
 unsatisfactory to the FNSEA.
 The farm organizations also
 criticize the inadequacy of
 short-term credit facilities
 and the policy of importing
 goods to block price rises.
 Individual farm leaders,  exas-
 perated with Paris' delay in
 coming to grips with agricultur-
 al problems, have proposed a boy-
 cott of the purchase of farm
 machinery or even a general
 strike by the peasants. FNSEA,
 however, has been able to channel
 farm discontent into a demand for
 a special session of parliament
 and has secured the signatures of
 the majority of the deputies.
 If De Gaulle makes the farm
 issue a test of political loyal-
 ty, the outcome will be question-
 able,  inasmuch as there is much
 sympathy for the farmers' de-
 mands--particularly among the
 Independents and Popular Repub-
 licans, who draw much of their
 support from rural areas.   If,
 on the other hand,  the govern-
 ment makes concessions on farm
 prices, this will stimulate new
 wage demands by already restless
 labor groups.
 PRELIMINARY MOVES TOWARD URBAN COMMUNES IN CHINA
 When the Chinese Communist
 leaders decided in December
 1958 to postpone large-scale
 formation of urban communes,
 they made it plain that such
 communes in "suitable forms"
 would eventually come and that
 the search for the "suitable
 forms" would continue.   The
 search has intensified in re-
 cent weeks,  and has concentrated
 on the promotion of collective
 working and living arrangements.
 City housewives have been en-
 couraged to take jobs at neigh-
 boring workshops.
 Although these workshops
 do not add greatly to total
 production,  they do serve as a
 device to free women from house-
 hold tasks which are being as-
 sumed by a growing number of
 collective welfare facilities--
 mess halls,, tailor brigades,
 laundries, nurseries, and homes
 for the aged.   The Chinese press
 claims that personnel in these
 establishments are already "per-
 forming the functions of moth-
 ers."  Some 7U percent of the
 residents of Chungking reported-
 ly are taking their meals in
 mess halls. The regime wants to
 see more such facilities.   It
 also urges the "rearrangement"
 of housing to permit those who
 work together to live and study
 together.   Such arrangements,
 Peiping says, will promote a
 collective spirit and permit
 party officials to conduct po-
 litical education "expeditious-
 ly."  Workers at the Anshan steel-
 works and the Yangchuan coal-
 mining center  have already been
 relocated,  but Peiping, while
 approving their initiative,
 warns that relocation elsewhere
 should be "gradual."
 State control over financial
 and commercial organs is being
 used to regulate the "economic
 life" of urban dwellers.   In
 Chungking--a leader in the field--
 single distribution outlets have
 been formed on the basis of res-
 idential or factory areas, and
 these "manage" the residents'
 consumption of food, clothing,
 and other items.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The changes now being made,
 although apparently widespread
 in China's urban areas, have
 not been publicly linked with
 the promised coming of urban
 communes.   They do, however,
 appear well designed to fulfill
 many of the requirements set
 down in December 1958.   The
 party central committee said
 that urban communes would be-
 come "unified organizers" of
 production, exchange, and the
 people's livelihood; that they
 would combine industry, agri-
 culture, trade, education, and
 military affairs; and that they
 would integrate government, ad-
 ministration, and commune man-
 agement.
 The present efforts, .which
 extend into the nearby country-
 side, seem to be the first steps.
 The party journal Red Flag re-
 cently noted a gracTa`l-al
 for neighborhood offices, which
 formerly performed only admin-
 istrative functions, to become
 "basic-level, politico-economic
 organizations".which unify pro-
 duction, exchange, and welfare.
 Reluctance to employ the
 term "urban commune" may simply
 reflect a desire to avoid the
 alarm created In the cities
 during the 1958 attempt to set
 them up.   Urban communes are
 almost certainly still in the
 cards for China's cities, how-
 ever, and present efforts to
 popularize the collective life
 are clearly a step in this
 direction.

 SINO-SOVIET TRADE RISE BOOSTS TOTAL CHINESE TRADE
 Despite evidence of polit-
 ical friction, the USSR and
 Communist China are continuing:
 to expand their economic ties.
 A recent announcement by Soviet
 Minister of Foreign Trade
 Patolichev indicates that Sino-
 Soviet trade in 1959 rose 35
 percent, to more than $2 bil-
 lion--$250,000,000 more than
 originally planned.   About 50
 percent of China's foreign
 trade is now  with' the Soviet
 Union, and Peiping has replaced
 East Germany as the largest
 trading partner of the USSR.
 Chinese commercial activities
 in the free world declined in
 1959, but as a result of in-
 creased exchanges with the bloc,
 total Chinese trade probably
 rose from $3.8 billion to about
 $4 billion.
 Disruption of the Chinese
 economy during the "leap for-
 ward" campaign, and the politi-
 cal setbacks of the past year
 contributed to the greatly re-
 duced scale of Chinese economic
 activity in Asia.  While the
 decline is not uniform, major
 reductions in Chinese trade with
 Japan, Hong Kong, Malaya, and
 Singapore have reduced China's
 over-all trade with Asian coun-
 tries well below the 1957 and
 1958 levels.   The economic im-
 plications of these setbacks
 are relatively unimportant to
 China's development, but Pei-
 ping's failure--or at best un-
 willingness--to follow up its
 promising commercial achieve-
 ments in Asian markets has con-
 tributed to the decline in its
 influence in South and South-
 east Asia.
 In Western Europe, the
 Chinese have resumed placing

 coasting during most of 1959
 on the strength of the huge
 orders placed during the "leap
 forward."  While trade with
 the area has not returned to
 the high levels of late 1958,
 Peiping diligently seeks to
 preserve its commercial repu-
 tation and to maintain con-
 tacts for future exploitation.
 Chinese purchases of in-
 dustrial raw materials and semi-
 finished goods from Western  .
 Europe--particularly steel and
 fertilizers--are neither regular
 nor dependable, but they do play
 an important role in supple-
 menting shipment of machinery
 and equipment from the bloc.
 China still has a large import
 surplus with Western Europe, but
 the higher level of exports to
 that area 1kat year, plus re-
 duced purchases, helped lessen
 China's trade imbalance and
 eased  the pressure on foreign
 exchange reserves.
 The general increase in
 Chinese trade with the bloc
 during 1959 apparently was more
 than sufficient to offset the
 decline in free-world trade,
 and the bloc's share of China's
 total trade rose above the 62
 percent of 1958.   In 1960 the
 USSR expects to supply more
 machinery and equipment, in-
 cluding complete plants, to
 China than it has before.   In
 order to continue debt repay-
 ments, however, Peiping prob-
 ably  will maintain an export
 surplus in this trade.
 As China's economy moves
 forward, the commodity composi-
 tj.on.of Sino-Soviet trade is
 undergoing a gradual change.
 The main items exchanged remain
 chiefly Chinese agricultural
 products for Soviet capital
 equipment, but shipments of
 Chinese light industrial prod-
 ucts, particularly textiles,
 are becoming increasingly im-
 portant.   Trade negotiations
 being carried on in Moscow prob-
 ably will result in a long-term
 trade agreement similar to those
 Peiping has signed with all
 the East European satellites.

 over the long term for utilities,
 roads, and communal facilities.
 Furthermore, private housing
 is considered "of poor psychology
 for socialism," according to a
 member of the recent delegation
 of Soviet builders to the United
 States.   Western observers have
 noted the difference between
 the energetic work of private
 builders and the lackadaisical
 approach of some workers on
 state housing.
 On the other hand, the
 pressure of the severe housing
 shortage in recent years has
 required the regime to depend
 more and more on construction
 by private individuals, usually
 with government assistance.
 Between 1956 and 1960, the
 volume of such construction has
 increased more than threefold,
 and it is counted on for about
 a third of the total to be built
 in 1961-65.   Recently official
 efforts were made to reassure
 homeowners that the results of
 the housing census carried out
 this January would not be used
 for confiscatory action.   In
 view of the importance of
 private housing, it seems un-
 likely that Khrushchev could
 safely carry out his implied
 threat to curtail its construc-
 tion.
 The yearly pace of total
 construction--state and private--
 during the remaining years of
 the Seven-Year Plan (1959-65)
 is scheduled to remain almost
 constant through 1962 and then
 decline slightly from the volume
 of 101,000,000 square meters
 planned in 1960.   It is thus
 possible that the USSR could
 exceed the present plan for both
 state and private housing by a
 comfortable margin. Resources
 used in private construction
 differ from those used in state
 construction and could not be
 readily transferred to the
 state sector.   Hence state
 housing could not be increased

 BLOC INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AIR DEVELOPMENTS
 Since 1955, the USSR and
 several of the satellites have
 concluded civil air transport
 agreements with most of the
 countries of Western Europe.
 The bloc now is shifting empha-

 and other Middle Eastern coun-
 tries.
 Aeroflot, the Soviet civil
 airline, while primarily con-
 cerned with domestic expansion,
 is preparing for future major
 additions and extensions to
 its international network. Pos-
 sible Soviet agreements with
 the United States and Japan are

 appear to be slated for later,

 Moscow frequently encourages
 the satellites--particularly
 Czechoslovakia--to take the lead
 in establishing new routes. The
 Czechoslovak airline has re-

 range turboprop equipment and
 has announced it would like to
 use IL-18s on the new Prague-
 Rome route.  The new equipment
 already is being used on Czech
 nonscheduled  flights to Guinea,
 with which Prague apparently
 plans to conclude a bilateral
 agreement, perhaps hoping later
 to extend this route to Latin
 America.
 The USSR now has flights
 to India. and the Czechs hope to
 extend their Bombay flight to
 Peiping, via Rangoon and Djakarta.

 the larger towns,  however.
 The tacit cooperation of
 the local populace has been a
 factor in recent Communist guer-
 rilla successes.                    A persistent
 Communist campaign of subver-
 sion and intimidation over the
 past several years,  including
 the assassination of several
 hundred local officials, has
 undermined the confidence of the
 peasants in the government's
 ability to protect them. Present
 Communist tactics, particularly
 the attacks on security forces,
 appear aimed at accelerating
 this trend and lowering the mil-
 itary's morale.
 In addition, the
 arbitrary police-state
 measures of many pro-
 vincial authorities
 have strained the lop-
 alty Of the people.
 A case in point is the
 forced-draft approach
 by overzealous pro-

 plementing the govern-
 ment's new program in
 the southern provinces
 of regrouping farmers
 from outlying areas
 in centralized settle-
 ments, known as "agro-

 protection against
 terrorists.   This has
 engendered so much
 popular resentment
 that the government
 has ordered a slow-

 SECRET
 PART II                    NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Many highly placed offi-
 cials in Saigon acknowlege that
 political reforms are a prereq-
 uisite for real improvement in
 internal security.   Vice Presi-
 dent Tho, for example, years ago
 forecast the steady growth of
 Communist influence among the
 populace unless the government
 took steps to broaden its popu-
 lar support.  Tho reportedly now
 fears that the Communists. will
 have completed their subversive
 work "at the roots" within the
 next six months unless effective
 countermeasures are immediately
 taken.
 President Diem, however,
 apparently is still thinking
 more in terms of military con-
 solidation to meet the present
 emergency.   He is urging  a
 20,000-man increase in the pres-
 ent support level of 150,000 for
 the armed forces, the creation
 of an elite commando force of
 10,000 to 20,000 men, and addi-
 tional military equipment partic-
 ularly suited for waging counter-
 guerrilla operations.

 Unless security in the af-
 fected provinces is stabilized,
 the continued erosion of the
 people's confidence in the gov-

 cised by the Communists over
 broad areas of the countryside
 under French rule between 1946
 and 1954.
 AFRICAN STATES INCREASE PRESSURE ON SOUTH AFRICA
 South Africa may face a
 campaign by other African states
 to bring the question of its
 administration of South-West
 Africa before the International
 Courtof Justice (ICJ). Since
 the native riots in Windhoek
 last December, may independent
 African states have shown in-
 creasing interest in South-West
 Africa, which was made a man-
 date of the Union of South Af-
 rica by the League of Nations
 in 1920.
 Liberia may bring a test
 case before the ICJ, charging
 that the introduction of apart-
 hbid  policies into the terri-
 tory violates the spirit of
 the mandate.   Since South Af-
 rica previously had committed
 itself to accept ICJ jurisdic-
 tion, the Liberians could ask
 the court to require compliance
 with its decision.   Continued
 South African intransigence
 could lead to an African ap-
 peal to the UN Security Coun-
 cil.

 In 1950 the ICJ delivered
 an advisory opinion, which is

 ever,  South African Nationalists
 have shown no inclination to
 bow to external pressure in
 the implementation of their
 racial policies.  The Nation-
 alists' determination to imple-

 cently been stiffened by Brit-
 ish Prime Minister Macmillan's
 criticism of apartheid, by the
 Union's growing isolation in
 the General Assembly, and by the
 highly publicized international
 consumer boycott of South African
 products. The South-West Africa
 issue will serve to keep the

 increasingly articulate states
 of Black Africa.
 EUROPEAN LABOR UNREST
 The varied labor difficul-
 ties which have recently devel-
 oped in five northern European
 countries have important polit-
 ical implications.
 In Belgium and the Nether-
 lands, strikes and threats of
 strikes continue to mount pres-
 sure on conservative coalitions
 susceptible to splitting on
 economic issues. Opposition to
 the accelerated program of clos-
 ing coal mines in the Borinage
 area of Belgium has resulted
 in a strike of a thousand miners,
 supported by middle-class ele-
 ments dependent on the coal in-
 dustry.   The Eyskens government
 is striving with some success
 to stave off a recurrence of the
 major stoppage and disturbances
 which occurred last year, but it
 appears ill equipped to placate
 the more general labor unrest.
 In the Netherlands, the
 biggest strike since World War
 II--a walkout of construction
 workers--threatens the govern-
 ment's prestige, for it involves
 major aspects of the "free wage"
 policy on which Prime Minister
 De Quay has staked his reputa-
 tion.
 In Iceland the Communists,
 because of their control over
 the Federation of Labor (IFL)
 as well as a number of key lo-
 cals, are in a strong position
 to obstruct implementation of
 the economic reform program
 recently enacted by the Con-
 servative - Social Democratic
 government. At a party congress
 opening on 18 March, the Commu-
 nists are expected to reveal
 their strategy regarding the
 government's program. If suffi-
 cient rank-and-file support
 materializes, a general strike
 may be called; otherwise, they
 will probably focus for the
 present on strikes in selected
 industries.
 In Finland, the Communists
 recently joined with dissident
 Social Democrats in a working
 coalition that puts them in
 position for an eventual take-
 over, or at least a disruption
 of the Finnish Federation of
 Labor.
 In West Germany and West
 Berlin, the possibility of a
 paralyzing strike of public
 utility and transport workers
 apparently hinges on the outcome
 of talks which resumed on 15
 March between the union and
 employers. Should negotiations
 break down--as they did earlier
 this year--a strike vote would
 follow.  A protracted stoppage
 could have serious consequences
 in West Berlin, as the East
 Germans have announced they
 would halt all service on the
 elevated railway to West Berlin
 as a gesture of solidarity--as
 they did during a one-day strike
 of transport workers a year ago.
 Mayor Brandt hopes that in the
 event of a nationwide walkout,
 the West Berliners would be con-
 tent with a symbolic 24-hour
 "demonstration."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 17 March 1960
 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 During a press conference
 at the National Press Club in
 Washington last September,
 Khrushchev was asked why he
 was going to Peiping after his
 visit to the United States. The
 Soviet premier, who had been re-
 laxed and in full command of
 the situation up to that point,
 said without apparent considera-
 tion that this "was the most
 complicated question there can
 be'."  Then,  flustered, he ad-
 dressed the assembled newsmen
 as "comrades."  After a clumsy
 attempt to explain this error,
 he tried to.joke the question
 away, noting that newsmen must
 read as well as write and there-
 fore should know that 1 October
 was the tenth anniversary of
 the "winning of power by the
 American...", caught himself,
 and with another long aside to
 rationalize this slip,  finished,
 "by the'Chinese working class."
 Developing Differences
 Khrushchev's fumbling on
 this question reflected the
 gradually increasing difficul-
 ties which had been developing
 in Sino-Soviet relations and
 which had become more acute
 .during 1958 and 1959.   Khru-
 shchev's visit to the.land of
 an ally, which he had made
 light of, was to prove more
 difficult than the visit to
 the United States.  The Chi-
 nese had made no elaborate ar-
 rangements to greet him; no
 bands played and no cannon
 roared; no efforts were made
 to publicize his trip or his
 every move; and, despite many
 hours of announced private con-
 versations with Mao Tse-tung
 and other Chinese leaders, no
 apparent agreement was reached
 and no communique was issued.
 Instead, throughout his
 stay, the Chinese continued to
 POLICY DIFFERENCES
 assert their own position on
 ideological questions, refused
 to follow the Soviet lead on
 "peaceful coexistence" and West-
 ern intentions, and treated the
 Soviet leader with, at best,
 cool formality.   On his return
 to the Soviet Union, Khrushchev
 could claim with some validity
 that his trip to the United
 States had been a success, but
 he drew a mantle of silence over
 his apparent failure in Peiping.
 Khrushchev's experiences
 in Peiping apparently convinced
 him that Mao and China's lead-
 ers were not going to meet So-
 viet policies more than half way.
 In his speech there, he had
 warned the Chinese Communists
 against "testing the stability
 of the capitalist system by
 force" and, on departing, said
 pointedly,  "We Communists of
 the Soviet Union consider it our
 sacred duty" to end the cold
 A decision apparently was
 made to inform bloc audiences
 that Moscow disapproved of Pei-
 ping's attitude and to exhort
 the Chinese to fall into'line.
 In major speeches on 31 October
 at the Supreme Soviet in Moscow
 and on 1 December before the
 Hungarian party congress, Khru-
 shchev made oblique attacks on
 some Chinese positions.   On at
 least two occasions Soviet lec-
 turers sharply criticized the
 Chinese by name, attacking the
 commune program, Chinese be-
 havior in the Sino-Indian. bor-
 der dispute, and the "cold and
 incorrect reception" given Khru-
 shchev in Peiping.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 17 March 1960
 In the address on 31 Octo-
 ber, Khrushchev defended his
 policy of detente by stressing
 the Leninist thesis of flexibil-
 ity and,  in what appeared to be
 a clear reference to the Chi-
 nese leadership, attacked the
 heretical Trotskyist concept of
 "neither peace nor war."   On
 1 December,  Khrushchev noted
 that imperialists were striving
 to disrupt bloc unity, and he
 called on all Communist coun-
 tries to "synchronize our
 watches."  "If the leadership
 of this or that country becomes
 conceited," he warned, "this
 can only play into the hands
 of the enemy."   The Chinese
 used the anniversary of Stalin's
 birth on 21 December to counter
 with praise for Stalin's un-
 compromising enmity to imperi-
 alism and his "relentless strug-
 gle for peace."
 Until Khrushchev accepted
 President Eisenhower's invita-
 tion to visit the United States,
 and thus set into motion the
 latest stage of his policy of,
 detente, Chinese Communist for-
 eign policy showed little vari-
 ance from that of the Soviet
 Union.   To force Western par-
 ticipation in a summit meeting
 on Soviet terms, Moscow had de-
 veloped an atmosphere of pres-
 sure and threats during 1958 and
 early 1959.   Charges of alleged
 flights by nuclear-armed Amer-
 ican bombers toward Soviet
 frontiers were followed by the
 attempt to discredit US policy
 toward the revolutionary Iraqi
 regime and the subsequent land-
 ing of American forces in Leb-
 anon.
 Moscow gave vigorous sup-
 port to the Chinese Communists
 in their offensive in the Tai-
 wan Strait in September and
 October 1958.   This period cul-
 rainated in the precipitation of
 a new Berlin crisis in Novem-
 ber.   Khrushchev apparently re-
 garded his actions as tactical
 maneuvers designed to attain a
 limited end--top-level talks on
 his own terms.
 Foreign Policy Aims
 Khrushchev's immediate
 foreign policy objectives re-
 main Western acceptance of the
 status quo in Eastern Europe,
 recognition of the East German
 regime, and the freezing of the
 partition of Germany.   While
 retaining in the background the
 threat of unilateral Soviet ac-
 tion to sign a separate peace
 treaty with East Germany, Khru-
 shchev now is concentrating on
 drawing the West into protracted
 negotiations which,  in his view,
 will enable the USSR to exploit
 what Moscow believes is a major
 shift in the balance of power
 in favor of the Soviet bloc.
 The Chinese Communists had
 no difficulty with Khrushchev's
 foreign policy during the period
 when it depended on harsh de-
 nunciations of the United States
 and combined threat and bluster
 with propaganda blasts, but
 Peiping strongly opposed Khru-
 shchev's shift to a concilia-
 tory posture which followed
 President Eisenhower's proposal
 for an exchange of visits.
 The Chinese are not in-
 terested in attaining a status
 quo arrangement with the United
 States, because the existing
 cold-war boundaries in the Far
 East--particularly in the Tai-
 wan Strait--are not acceptable
 to them.   The Chinese leaders,
 apparently convinced that the
 United States will not change
 its policy of nonrecognition
 of their regime and support for
 Taipei, intend to maintain
 their hostility toward the US
 while they press on toward their
 goals of international recogni-
 tion of their regime, admission
 to the UN,  and an eventual take-
 over of Taiwan by "whatever
 means necessary."
 To maintain an atmosphere
 in which talks with Western
 leaders are assured, and in
 hopes of playing these leaders
 off against each other, Moscow
 finds it desirable to subordinate

 some longer term objectives to
 more immediate tactics.   Thus
 Khrushchev considered it more
 important to give qualified
 support to De Gaulle's Algerian
 proposals than all-out support
 to the Algerian provisional
 government, thereby forcing the
 French Communist party into a
 sudden shift in its position.
 The Chinese, whose policies are
 in the main concerned with Asia
 and who see little gain in talks
 from which they are excluded,
 condemned De Gaulle's proposals
 as a sop.
 Underlying Factors
 The wino-Soviet divergences
 on foreign policy tactics re-
 flect different interests and
 aims which flow,  in turn,  from
 certain ideological and polit-
 ical differences and from the
 difference in phase and pace
 of the economic and social de-
 velopment in the two countries.
 The Soviet Union is in a phase
 of economic development which
 makes it possible to assure its
 people that they can enrich
 their personal lives without
 a constant fear of war or threat
 of attack.   The Soviet Union,
 with a highly industrialized
 economy and full international
 recognition,  can now afford the
 luxury of easing internal pres-
 sures and can take a more prag-
 matic approach to foreign pol-
 icy problems.
 The Chinese Communists,
 on the other hand,  with an
 agrarian country and an embry-
 onic industry, rely heavily on
 doctrinal extremism and a tense
 internal atmosphere in their
 headlong drive for economic de-
 velopment and social transforma-
 tion.   While probably as unwill-
 ing as the Soviet Union to pro-
 voke a major war,  Chinese lead-
 ers feel the need for an atmos-
 phere of "struggle" to force
 their people to the efforts
 necessary to achieve the goals
 of the "great leap."  While
 Khrushchev sees clear advan-
 tages in a relaxation of East-
 West tensions, Mao feels an ur-
 gent need to maintain an active
 ly hostile attitude toward the
 SECRET
 non-Communist world, the United
 States in particular.
 The Chinese apparently
 feel that the world balance has
 already shifted so drastically
 in favor of the bloc that Mos-
 cow's present tactics are un-
 necessary and that constant
 pressure on the West will force
 concessions.   They certainly
 believe that political power
 and control grow out of military
 power--as Mao put it long ago,
 "Political power grows out of
 the barrel of a gun; anything
 can grow out of the barrel of
 a gun.
 The Chinese may feel that
 the Soviet Union is misjudging
 the world situation now, just
 as Stalin misjudged the situa-
 tion in China during the 1940s
 when Mao, by disregarding
 Stalin's advice to bide his
 time and seek a period of "peace-
 ful coexistence" with Chiang Kai-
 shek,  led his Communist forces
 to victory.
 Present Positions
 Out of these differences
 has grown China's disagreement
 with Khrushchev's detente pol-
 icies.                                                                        In the past few months
 its strictures against the West
 have become, if anything, more
 violent.   Even while proclaim-
 ing the undying unity of the
 bloc on the occasion of the
 tenth anniversary of the Sino-
 Soviet Treaty of Peace and
 Friendship on 14 February, Pei-
 ping spokesmen reiterated that
 President Eisenhower merely
 wears "the mask of an envoy of
 peace," whereas Pravda was de-
 veloping a mildly favorable
 impression of the President.
 China's position was pre-
 sented in capsule form on 4 Feb-
 ruary by politburo member Kang
 Sheng, its representative to
 the Warsaw Pact.Political Con-
 sultative Committee meeting in
 Moscow.  The declaration issued
 after the meeting set forth
 Khrushchev's current foreign
 policy tactics, mixing threats
 of signing a separate peace
 treaty with East Germany with

 blandishments designed to dem-
 onstrate the Communist world's
 determination to facilitate
 the coming talks.
 Except for the unyielding
 position on Germany and some
 innocuous generalities concern-
 ing peace and bloc unity, Kang
 Sheng could find nothing that
 pleased him in the declaration.
 While it welcomed the improve-
 ment in Soviet-American rela-
 tions and expressed the hope
 that President Eisenhower's
 visit to Russia would mark a
 further improvement and pro-
 vide "an important guarantee
 of the inviolability of peace
 throughout the world," Kang
 Sheng flatly stated, "The ac-
 tions of the United States
 fully prove that its imperial-
 ist nature cannot be changed."
 While the declaration saw
 an increasing possibility of a
 disarmament agreement, Kang
 Sheng asserted, "The United
 States' moves prove that it
 will not give up the policy of
 the arms race," and noted that
 Peiping would not be bound by
 any international agreement to
 which it was not a party. Where
 the declaration hailed Moscow's
 unilateral reduction of troop
 strength and called on other
 nations to follow suit, Kang
 Sheng noted that China cannot
 now afford to reduce its mil-
 itary power.
 China's Disputes
 The Chinese, through their
 aggressive pursuit of their
 country's national interests
 in its disputes with India and
 Indonesia, have demonstrated
 they are not willing to sub-
 ordinate these interests to
 the Soviet Union's foreign
 policy.   When,  in the course
 of Chinese Communist suppres-
 sion of the Tibetan revolt,
 India decided to pay more at-
 tention to its lengthy frontiers
 with China, China reacted sharp-
 ly and immediately to maintain
 the positions in this area
 that it had been gradually de-
 veloping over many years with
 SECRET
 no previous opposition from
 India.   Khrushchev, however,
 unwilling to jeopardize either
 Moscow's relations with New
 Delhi or his renewed policy of
 detente, took the unprecedented
 step of remaining neutral in a
 dispute between a Communist
 and non-Communist nation.
 In sharp contrast to So-
 viet support of Chinese aggres-
 sive action in the Taiwan Strait
 in 1958, when such support ac-
 corded with Soviet tactics,
 Khrushchev refuses to back
 China in the dispute with India.
 On 31 October he said, "We
 should be glad if the inci-
 dents on the Sino-Indian fron-
 tier were not repeated."   In
 an arranged press interview, a
 Soviet newsman told correspond-
 ents in Geneva that Chinese ac-
 tion on the border dispute would
 have been foolish at any time,
 but was particularly foolish at
 this time.   Through these means

 IRAQ'S ECONOMY UNDER QASIM
 Twenty months after the
 revolution that brought Prime
 Minister Qasim to power, Iraq's
 economy,  long one of the strong-
 est in the Middle East, re-
 mains basically sound, prin-
 cipally because of a rapid in-
 crease in oil revenues to a
 record $242,360,000 in 1959.
 Qasim's policies, however,
 have led to severe economic
 dislocations, especially in
 agriculture.   The virtual a-
 bandonment of the development
 program of former regimes has
 also made substantial funds
 available.   Thus,  although
 rasim has been able to main-
 tain or perhaps even raise
 slightly the public's consump-
 tion levels, there are signs of
 growing discontent with the
 government's failure to make
 good on unrealistic economic
 promises.
 Qasim's Economic Inheritance
 On the eve of the July
 1958 revolution,  Iraq had a
 relatively sound economy based
 on substantial and generally
 increasing oil revenues and a
 modest agricultural export
 trade.   The royal regime was
 carrying out a development plan
 aimed at providing a sound
 basis for developing the econ-
 omy rapidly.  This program was
 financed by a statutory 70-
 percent share of the govern-
 ment's annual oil revenues.
 About 60 percent of total expend-
 itures were allocated for irri-
 gating and reclaiming land and
 for building roads and bridges.
 Industry accounted for less
 than 7 percent of total ex-
 penditures, and projects with
 an immediate impact for the
 urban centers received even
 less.
 Thus,  with most develop-
 ment activity taking place far
 from cities and towns and with
 a poor government public rela-
 tions program, many Iraqis
 knew little about the progress
 of the development program and
 were easily taken in by charges
 that the government was siphon-
 ing off development funds.
 Nevertheless, progress was con-
 siderable.  A lack of techni-
 cians, however, plagued the
 Development Board, and expendi-
 tures lagged substantially be-
 hind plans.   By March 1959,
 after eight years of operation,
 development expenditures totaled
 $644,000,000, although the board's
 revenues amounted to $879,200,-
 000.

 been reached with Burma merely
 accords with what Peiping has
 been offering for years. There
 will probably be little soften-
 ing of Sino-Soviet differences
 in policy toward the United
 States until the tactics the
 USSR pursues serve what the
 Chinese believe to be their own
 national interests.

 Iraq's Western-run oil in-
 dustry is still operating nor-
 mally after an initial period
 of uncertainty.       Although often
 harassed by the Qasim govern-
 ment since the revolution,  tho
 Iraq Petroleum Company now is
 carrying on its business with
 little interference.   Govern-
 ment officials seem to be keenly
 aware that disruption of oil
 production probably would un-
 dermine the economy.                      Thus,
 despite the confusion in othei,
 sectors of ;the .economy, oil pro-
 duction last year rose 14 per-
 cent over 1958--reaching a
 record average of 830,000 bar-
 rels a day (b/d).  A major ex-
 pansion program now is well
 under way,  and export capacity
 is expected to be nearly dou-
 bled by the end of 1962.  At
 today's prices, revenues could
 reach between $400,600,000 and
 $450,000,000 in 1963.
 The regime will probably
 make a serious effort to mar-
 ket some of its own crude oil
 in 1960.   Under the concession
 terms, the government is en-
 titled to about 116,000 b/d
 this year.   Marketing will be
 especially difficult, however,

 is
 oversupply  of crude oil, and
 because of the small chance for
 marketing a significant quan-
 tity of this oil in the Sino-
 Soviet bloc countries.
 Agriculture
 The major agricultural dif-
 ficulties last year resulted
 from the regime's agrarian re-
 form law of September 1958 and
 to some extent from inadequate
 rainfall.   Iraq normally ex-
 ports about 250,000 tons of
 barley annually.   Last year
 Baghdad halted barley exports,
 however, because the crop was
 officially estimated to be
 300,000 tons below normal. The
 wheat crop also suffered heavy
 losses.  Wheat imports averaged
 about 50, 000 tons annually from 1956
 to 1958, Last year's imports,
 however, soared to between
 450,000 and 500,000 tons.
 The loss of earnings from
 barley exports and payments for
 wheat imports probably will cost
 Iraq about $55,000,000 in for-
 eign exchange.   While some
 wheat has been imported from
 Turkey, most of it has come
 from the USSR. Some of this
 has already deteriorated, be-
 cause Iraq is not equipped to
 store and handle large grain
 imports.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 17 March 1960
 Prospects for the 1960
 harvest are poor.   Early re-
 ports suggest that only a lit-
 tle more than 50 percent of the
 normal acreage has been planted.
 The lack of planting stems
 largely from the refusal of
 landlords to provide their for-
 mer peasants with seed, tools,
 or irrigation for land in ex-
 cess of the 620
 acres the landlords
 legally retain under
 the Agrarian Reform
 Program.   In an ef-
 fort to fill the gap
 created by the land-
 lords' refusal to
 perform their tradi-
 tional functions
 without assurance of
 receiving a share of
 the crop, the gov-
 ernment granted loans
 of 110 pounds of seed
 and $56 in cash to
 many peasants. This
 program was a fail-
 ure and has been dis-
 continued.   Many
 240
 220
 200
 150
 160
 peasants spent the cash on
 "frivolous luxuries" and ate
 or sold the seed.
 The Agrarian Reform Pro-
 gram has failed dismally, and
 thus far--of the 4,000,000
 acres seized--only about
 12,000 acres have been re-
 distributed.  This failure
 was largely the fault of pro-
 Communist Minister of Agrarian
 Reform Dr. Ibrahim Kubba, who
 met strong opposition both in-
 side and outside the govern-
 ment in his efforts to re-
 place the landowners with a
 Communist-type organization.
 Kubba has been discharged,
 however, and anti-Communist
 Minister of Interior Brigadier
 Yahya has taken his place.
 Economic Development
 The elimination of most
 Western technicians and con-
 tractors--the backbone of the
 previous projects--has virtually
 stopped new development work.
 Many Western technicians were
 initially replaced by Soviet and
 other Communist bloc personnel,
 and now these groups have been
 reduced.  As a result, economic
 activity has declined, unemploy-
 ment has increased, and workers
 on development projects near=

 announced a massive $1.12 bil-

 ample, the plan calls for spend-

 penditures probably could not
 exceed $140,000,000.

 betterments.   Such promises,
 however, far exceed the re-
 gime's ability to deliver, and
 public disillusionment is cer-
 tain to develop in coming
 months.
 Largely as a result of the
 regime's recent recognition
 that the country's standard of
 living cannot be raised with-
 out foreign assistance,  the
 government's attitudes toward
 Western contractors and busi-
 nessmen have gradually changed.
 There has been a re-evaluation,
 in both the private and public
 sectoi of the role of the Com-
 munist bloc and especially of
 the Soviet Union.   Awareness
 is growing that the bloc's role
 will necessarily be secondary
 and that Iraq must look to the
 West for much of its economic
 development.
 Unlike most underdeveloped
 countries,  Iraq has sufficient
 revenues to finance an ambi
 tious development program, and
 Soviet-bloc, barter-type cred-
 its are not especially attrac-
 tive.   Much of the economic
 activity directed toward the
 Communist world in recent
 months reflects a reaction to
 "Western imperialists," the ef-
 fects of rampant nationalism,
 and a rejection of all those
 connected with the hated Nuri
 regimes.   Many of the trade
 agreements with the bloc in
 past months were made in an
 effort to sell the country's
 date crop.  Qasim has been
 propagandizing this accomplish-
 ment heavily,                 for more than
 30 percent of Iraqi farmers
 depend on dates for some of
 their income.   Basically, how-
 ever, there are not economic
 pressures for increasing trade
 with the Communist bloc.
 The Soviet Union is imple-
 menting its $137,500,000 line
 of credit in accordance with
 the general terms of the aid
 agreement. Under the agreement,
 the USSR is committed during
 1959-60 to complete research
 and planning on the first 25
 projects listed under the agree-
 ment.   Most of the 300 Soviet
 technicians in Iraq are doing
 survey work.   Research and
 planning have begun on about
 18 of these 25 projects.
 Construction work on most
 of the projects, however,  has
 not begun, and for the most
 part the delivery of materials
 is not scheduled before 1961.
 On some projects, construction
 is not scheduled to begin until
 1962 or later.   Because the
 Soviet aid agreement has pro-
 gramed most projects over a
 number of years,  Iraq cannot
 expect for some time to get
 tangible benefits from the So-
 viet credit.
 Under the terms of the
 agreement, the USSR is to pro-
 vide technical assistance for
 another 18 projects, to be fi-
 nanced outside the $137,500,000
 credit.   The Soviet Union is
 to be reimbursed for this as-
 sistance--~ under the credit
 itself--with Iraqi exports or
 with convertible currency.
 Thus far contracts have been
 concluded for about half of
 these projects,  including a
 shipyard at Basra, improvement
 of radio and broadcasting fa-
 cilities throughout the country,
 and some hydroelectric power
 and irrigation   projects involv-
 ing the Tigris and Euphrates
 river system.
 Prospects
 Iraq's long-term economic
 prospects remain the brightest
 of any Middle Eastern country,
 but difficulties are likely to
 plague the Qasim regime in
 coming months.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Despite increasing oil rev-
 enues and the Soviet aid pro-
 gram, economic conditions are
 not likely to improve markedly
 over the next several months.
 Most Soviet-sponsored develop-
 ment, projects will not yield
 benefits for at least two years.
 Even if the present trend of
 improved relations with Western
 contractors continues and leads
 to a substantial renewal of
 Western development activities,
 the benefits of any projects
 would be slow in having their
 effect.
 Qasim has raised Iraqi
 anticipation of short-run eco-
 nomic improvements unrealistical-
 ly high, and widespread disil-
 lusionment will necessarily set
 in.   There are already reports
 that the revolutionary regime's
 economic "achievements" are be-
 ing compared unfavorably with
 the former royal government.
 Widespread dissatisfaction
 could upset Qasim's policy of
 carefully balancing pro- and
 anti-Communist factions within
 the country.   Economic disloca-
 tion and unemployment are like-
 ly to be exploited by antiregime
 elements--Communists and nation-*
 alists--to stir up trouble among
 the urban masses, landowners
 and peasants, tribesmen, and the
 volatile politically conscious
 white-collar intelligentsia.
 This dissension, accompanying
 present disgruntlement in army
 officer circles, could provide
 the atmosphere suitable for a
 coup against the Qasim regime.

 Prepared jointly with   25X1
 Disturbed by the growth
 of nationalist and anti-imperi-
 alist sentiment in the Arab
 world,    Britain is seeking new
 relationships with the littoral
 states of the Arabian peninsula
 in the hope of maintaining its
 influence there and ensuring
 continued access to Middle East
 oil. A policy of disengagement
 both from inter-Arab quarrels
 and from close alignment with
 particular states was decided
 on last summer.  The British are
 rapidly relinquishing various
 prerogatives in the key state
 of Kuwait--the source of about
 42 percent of their crude-oil
 imports in 1959 but have con-

 Rationale for Policy
 London's purpose originally
 in assuming responsibility for
 the defense and foreign affairs
 of these states was to secure
 its routes to India and the Far
 East.   This has become a less
 important factor,  however,  and
 events of recent years have con-
 vinced London that its continued
 access to oil would be helped
 by some revision of old relation-
 ships.   While the policy stated
 as a warning to Khrushchev in
 early 1956--that Britain would
 fight to defend Kuwait--remains
 the official position, London
 is concentrating on modifying
 its political ties with these
 littoral states.   The adverse
 propaganda repercussions oc-

 1956, the campaigns against the
 Omani rebels, and the sending

 This carrier, operating

 are scheduled for completion

 Kuwait
 London is giving up many
 prerogatives in response to
 the Ruler's request, and is
 encouraging Kuwait to exercise
 more of the incidental attri-
 butes of sovereignty in the
 belief that this is the best
 means in the long run of keep-
 ing Kuwait free of foreign
 domination.
 On 25 February, the British
 began a progressive elimination
 of their special legal juris-
 diction over all resident for-
 eigners except Arabs,  Iranians,
 and Indonesians.   Kuwaiti au-
 thority over traffic, labor,
 port rules, and foreign resi-
 dence has been established, and
 London has signified its will-
 ingness to cede jurisdiction in
 other fields as soon as Kuwait
 has promulgated the modern legal
 codes now being drafted.  F
 Kuwait now has its own post-
 al system and will shortly have
 its own currency.   It is also
 being encouraged to join inter-
 national organizations open to
 territories not fully self-gov-
 erning and, on these matters,
 to deal directly with the parties
 concerned rather than through
 the British political agent.
 Despite recommendations from
 its.field officials, London is
 reluctant, however, to authorize
 foreign consulates other than
 the American.
 In return, the British have
 been accorded more cordial co-
 operation, especially in mili-
 tary matters, than they have
 received for many years.  Kuwait
 last July purchased 16 tanks
 and 12 armored cars from the
 British.  The Kuwaitis remain
 sensitive about any publicity
 on their military cooperation
 with Britain, but nevertheless
 are developing close military
 liaison.  They have sent tank
 crews for training in Britain,
 and there are some British train-
 ing personnel in Kuwait.  These
 arrangements have been negotiated
 with the heir apparent, Abdulla
 Mubarrak, whom the British have
 cultivated.
 Aden-Yemen
 London's relations with
 Yemen have become relatively
 cordial after years of dissen-
 sion and border warfare.  The
 British have managed with some
 success to reassure Yemen of
 their good intentions, thus
 obtaining a period of relative
 quiet on the frontiers in which

 Problem of Saudi Arabia
 Discussions through various
 intermediaries--at present UN
 Secretary General Hammarskjold--
 have brought only slight progress
 toward the restoration of dip-
 lomatic relations with Saudi
 Arabia and the amelioration of
 feuds which hamper Britain's
 relations elsewhere in the penin-
 Saudi Arabia's reply to
 Hammarskjold's suggestions for
 an accommodation with London
 in effect reiterated its long-
 standing position that agree.-
 ment must first be reached on
 procedures for settlement of
 the problem of Buraimi, the
 oasis claimed by both the Saudis
 and British-protected states but
 occupied by British-supported
 forces of Abu Dhabi and Muscat
 since 1955.   London has insisted
 that Saudi Arabia restore dip-
 lomatic relations before dis-
 cussing Buraimiin view of the
 complications of the problem
 Abu Dhabi and claimed also by
 Qatar provides another obstacle
 to agreement, with the Saudis
 insisting that the British
 force Abu Dhabi to withdraw.
 A Foreign office official said
 on 19 February that London
 would try to be flexible but
 that giving up BUraimi might
 result in a "crisis of confi-
 dence" among British-protected
 states, particularly Kuwait.
 The Sultan of Muscat re-
 fuses even to discuss negoti-
 ating the Buraimi issue and
 other problems with the Saudis
 or to strengthen his own author-
 ity, and London feels obliged
 to continue its support of him.
 Britain is trying both
 to intimidate the rebels and
 improve the capability of the
 Sultan's forces by periodically
 sending in small contingents
 of special British troops for
 joint exercises.   Because of
 Muscati apathy, Britain's
 small economic development
 program in the sultanate is
 proceeding slowly.
 Ultimately, the British
 may try to negotiate a politi-
 cal settlement with the rebels,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Brussels'      past policies
 in the Belgian Congo have left
 both the Belgians and the col-
 ony itself ill equipped for
 the establishment of an inde-
 pendent Congolese state in
 mid-1960.  The recent Belgian-
 Congolese round-table confer-
 ence left most problems unre-
 solved, including the new
 state's political and economic
 relations with Brussels.
 For about half a century
 Belgian colonial policy was
 best characterized as '7enlight-
 ened paternalism."  Both the
 Africans and the European set-
 tlers were deprived of all po-
 litical expression, while great
 stress was laid on economic
 development and social wel-
 fare.  A network of roads,
 housing, schools, and the im-
 provement of medical services
 made the Congo seem far ahead
 of the rest of Africa. Social-
 ly, Belgian attention was
 focused on integrating the Af-
 ricans into an expanding econ-
 omy, easing racial segraga-
 tion, and restricting European
 immigration to avoid a sizable
 white-settler problem.
 Political Developments
 The :.political  turning
 point for the Congo came in
 1957.   Outside events such as
 Gh'ana's independence and French
 African elections resulted in
 the emergence of politically
 conscious Congolese groups
 with a timetable for complete
 emancipation.  The Congo's
 most urbanized tribal group
 called for immediate independ-
 ence.   Political tensions
 mounted in 1957-58,and seri-
 ous anti-European disorders
 occurred in Leopoldville and
 Elizabethville.
 These pressures led the
 government to introduce popu-
 larly elected municipal coun-
 cils in the European and Afri-
 BELGIUM'S FUTURE IN THE CONGO
 can sectors of the Congolese
 cities and to admit Africans to
 the civil service on equal
 terms with Belgians.   Recog-
 niting the need for training
 future political leaders, more-
 over, the government estab
 lished state schools and founded
 two universities to supplement
 the Christian missionary
 schools which had been mainly
 on the primary and technical
 level.
 Opinion in Brussels was
 slow in evolving, but by 1958
 a high-level study group was
 appointed to make recommenda-
 tions for the political fu-
 ture of the Congo.   The impact
 of the All-African People's
 Conference at Accra in Decem-
 ber 1958, however, and the po-
 litical tensions which culmi-
 nated in the Leopoldville riots
 of early January 1959 influ-
 enced Brussels to offer even-
 tual independence and to call
 municipal and territorial coun-
 cil elections for December
 1959.  There was to be full
 equality between Belgians and
 Congolese.
 Neither the settlers nor
 the Congolese were satisfied
 with the proposals.   New Con-
 golese political groups began
 to demand the immediate estab-
 lishment of a Congolese govern-
 ment and a constituent assem-
 bly.   Fearing the December
 local elections would be boy-
 cotted,  Belgium offered a defi-
 nite timetable for independence
 and the establishment of a
 semiautonomous, national govern-
 ment with two legislative as-
 semblies in 1960.   King Baudouin,
 a popular figure with the Con-
 golese, paid a hurried visit
 during the December election
 period in an attempt to de-
 crease the tension.

 ever, demanded independence

 at $750,000,000.   The Union
 Miniere du Haut Katanga, the
 country's principal mining
 establishment, contributes 42
 percent of the Congo's revenue
 by exploiting such minerals as
 copper and uranium.   Other im-
 portant enterprises include
 Forminiere (diamonds), OTRACO
 (transport), and Lever Broth-
 ers (palm products).
 While these firms did not
 actively seek to influence the
 course of political develop-
 ments '.in.?.. 1958-09, - Union.
 Miniere's director recently
 indicated his support for a
 federation that would preserve
 the economic unity of the
 Congo but give the Katanga con-
 siderable autonomy.   This move
 suggests that the company and
 other Belgian interests in the
 Katanga--which are suspected
 of separatist tendencies--may
 become increasingly involved
 in Congo politics in order to
 preserve their privileged eco-
 nomic position.
 In 1959, for the first
 time, the Belgian Government
 had to give budgetary support
 to the Congo, some $20,000,-
 000.   It plans to make annual
 contributions to the second
 Development Plan, which calls
 for about $1 billion in new
 investments from both internal
 and external sources during
 the ten-year period starting
 in 1960.   The principal goal
 of the plan is to accelerate
 the change from a subsistence
 to a monetary economy, with
 greater emphasis on the de-
 velopment of farming by Afri-
 cans.  The plan also seeks
 capital from other Western
 sources, although little for-
 eign money has thus far been
 attracted to the Congo because
 of the Belgian monopoly over
 investments there.
 Brussels has announced
 plans for the development of
 the Inga Rapids on the Lower
 Congo River, where the poten-
 tial hydroelectric output is
 estimated at 25,000,000 kilo-
 watts--the greatest in the
 world.  Development of this
 huge potential is visualized
 over a period of 26 years, the
 first stage providing 1,500,-
 000 kilowatts of power capac-
 ity:  within four years at a
 total cost of $316,000,000.
 The ,Round- TXble Conference
 The Brussels conference
 had to take account of consid-
 erable separatist sentiment in
 Leopoldville and the mineral-
 rich KatangaProvince.   It was
 decided that the Congo's mines
 would be controlled by the
 central government, although
 the provinces would have exten-
 sive rights in the granting of
 concessions.   General agreement
 was reached on the structure
 of the unitary Congo state,
 which on 30 June is to assume
 responsibility for foreign af-
 fairs and defense as well as
 national policy, currency, cus-
 toms, transportation, and com-
 munications.
 The Belgians succeeded in
 maintaining amicable relations
 with the Congolese at the con-
 ference by granting concessions
 on most points, even where
 there is a good likelihood of
 serious difficulty in imple-
 menting the round-table deci-
 sions.   Several major problems,
 moreover, were left entirely
 unresolved:   for example, the
 future of the Europeans in the
 new Congolese state, and the
 political ties between Belgium
 and the Congo.   It is not
 clear yet whether the King of
 Belgium, who has been the
 traditional link between the
 Congo and Brussels, will have
 any role.
 Agreement is still to be
 reached also on the disposition
 of Belgium's investments in
 Congo companies, and on the
 status of the army-air bases
 at Kamina and Kitona  and  the

 naval base at Banana.         While
 it has been agreed that the
 Congolese constitution will
 guarantee the right of persons
 and properties, whether na-
 tionals, Belgians, or foreign-
 ers, there is much concern
 among the Belgians as to the
 ability of the Congolese gov-
 ernment to assure these rights.
 Congolese leaders, who are
 aware of their dependence on
 Belgian forces to maintain in-
 ternal security, are expected
 to welcome continuation of
 this  service  to  the Congo
 state.
 Out look
 Solutions to these prob-
 lems will be complicated as
 the long-standing feuds between
 the Congolese tribes and the
 rivalries of the numerous po-
 litical aspirants become aggra-
 vated.   Other difficulties in-
 clude the paucity of trained
 Congolese administrators to re-
 place the 10,000 or more Bel-
 gians in the civil service,
 the disparity in the distribu-
 tion of the Congo's wealth, and
 the strong separatist senti-
 ment in the rich  Katang%Prov-
 ince.   There will also probably
 be a sharp increase in external
 influences ranging from inter-
 national Communism to the pan-
 African movement.
 SECRET
 Congolese candidates for
 legislative office  have  re-
 cently sought financial as-,
 sistance from both Communist
 and non-Communist sources
 abroad.  The resulting  con-
 filets will present a constant
 threat to order and a tempta-
 tion to the Belgians to inter-
 vene, despite their contention
 that responsibility for suc-
 cessful political advances
 rests on the Congolese them-
 selves.
 Still another unresolved
 problem is to assure the flow
 of new investment capital re-
 quired for the  Congo's  eco-
 nomic development. The Congo-
 lese want to retain Belgium's
 economic "presence" since they
 recognize the importance of
 its technical assistance and
 the commercial and investment
 advantages available through
 Belgium's membership in the
 European Common Market.   it
 is far less  clear   whether
 Belgian financial interests
 have  sufficient  confidence
 in the new order to go through
 with the investment program
 envisaged  in  the  ten-year
 Development Plan.   Further
 light will be shed on this
 question by the joint eco-
 nomic conference which is to
 be held in Brussels in mid-
 April.
