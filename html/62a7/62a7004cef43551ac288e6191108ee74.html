PREFACE 
This report is the third in a series of 
in-depth biographic studies of Communist China's 
top leaders. The series will fill a gap in our 
biographic coverage of China's senior leadership 
and is launched in anticipation of future leader-
ship changes. 
The additional length of these reports over 
our conventional product is primarily attributable 
to the inclusion of more background information 
and speculative comment than is our usual custom. 
Information in this report is current as of 
15 July 1971. 
This report was prepared by the Central Reference 
Service and was coordinated within IA zs appro-

BIOGRAPHIC BRIEF 
Ch'en Po-ta's rise to fourth place in the 
Chinese Communist hierarchy resulted from his 
close personal relationship with Mao Tse-tung, 
whom he has served as personal secretary, ghost-
writer and troubleshooter. Ch'en is a prolific 
writer, a Communist ideologist and a major figure 
in the propaganda apparatus. Be has no indivi-
dual authority or power base, however. .Prom July 
1966 through at least 1969 Ch'en was head of the 
Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Commit-
tee, with full responsibility for implementing 
Mao's directives on the Cultural Revolution. 
Ch'en has not appeared in public since 
August 1970. His absence could be due to a heavy 
workload or illness* or he could be the object 
of official criticism for involvement with the 
extremist-oriented "May 16 Group." The Politburo 
supposedly censured Ch'en in 1970 for endorsing 
radical tactics during the Cultural Revolution, 
but he has not been criticized publicly in offi-
cial Chinese news media, and he has not submitted 
a self-criticism to the Politburo.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 
Member, Standing Committee, 
Politburo, Chinese Communist 
Party Central Committee 
Ch'en Po-ta, longtime 
personal secretary and polit-
ical agent of Mao Tse-tung, 
ranks fourth in the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP) hier-
archy, although his status 
and political future are 
presently clouded. Ch'en 
has been a full member of 
the Politburo of the Central 
Committee (CCP-CC) since 
August 1966 and a member of 
the Politburo Standing Com-
mittee since October of 
that year. 
A prolific writer, a 
Communist ideologist and a 
major figure in the propa-
ganda apparatus, Ch'en is, 
next to Mao, the leading 
philosopher and theoretician 
of the CCP. He has devoted 
his career to bolstering and 
praising Mao, who has in turn 
called on Ch'en frequently during the past 30 years to help 
him develop his revolutionary society. In July 1966 Mao 
selected Ch'en to head the Cultural Revolution Group (CRG) 
of the CCP-CC, a position of great responsibility. As CRG 
head Ch'en was the chief administrative officer of the 
Cultural Revolution, Mao's attempt to eradicate all opposi-
tion to his will--both real and imagined--in the CCP and 
Chinese society. 
CH'EN Po-ta 
(7115/0130/6671) 
Without Mao's support Ch'en would have little prom_ 
nence. He has no individual authority or power base.

Current Status  
Ch'en has not appeared in public since August 
1970. The New China News Agency (NCNA) press 
release on the 1 October 1970 National Day rally 
barely noted his absence. After the 1971 May Day 
rally in Peking, NCNA commented that there were 
members of the Politburo (unnamed) who were not in 
attendance because of "work or illness." 
Some observers feel that Ch'en's absence may 
be due to his involvement in the selection of slates 
of candidates for the new provincial Party commit-
tees that have been formed since December 1970. 
Others believe he may be ill. Still others feel 
that he has declined politically because of a long-
standing dispute within the Politburo over power 
and policy. 
Recent reports state that Ch'en was involved 
with the "May 16 Group," an organization formed in 
1966 by high-level, Peking-based dissident radicals. 
The group has been associated with political attacks 
on Chou En-lai, members of the State Council, and 
several military figures who are now on the Polit-
buro. It was also accused of directing a destructive 
attack against the British Embassy in Peking in 1967. 
In late 1967 the group was denounced for espousing 
extreme, violent tactics. 
A yearlong investigation of the "May 16 Group" 
by the Politburo appears to have been completed in 
the spring of 1971. Official Chinese news media 
then initiated a major political campaign on the 
anniversary of the group's founding by denouncing 
"sham Marxists" and the group's leaders who were 
originally criticized in 1967. Private study com-
mittees in China are now reviewing the report, which 
apparently includes criticism of Ch'en Po-ta. As 
yet, however, Ch'en has not been named publicly as 
the target of this campaign. 
At several unpublicized Politburo meetings in 
late 1970, both Ch'en Po-ta and fellow Standing 
Committee Member K'ang Sheng were supposedly cen-
sured for espousing extremism during the Cultural

Revolution. K'ang submitted a self-criticism to 
the Politburo, but to date Ch'en is not known to 
have offered an official explanation of his actions 
or a self-criticism. 
Early Life  
Chien Po-ta was born about 1905 in Huian hsien, 
Fukien Province, to a poor peasant family and was 
originally named Ch'en Shang-yu (7115/1424/0671). 
He received some education at a village school near 
Amoy established by the overseas Chinese leader Tan 
Kah Kee (7115/0857/1649). Ch'en then joined the 
army of the local warlord Chang Chen (1728/6966), 
but he worked only as a clerk and secretary. 
In 1927, shortly after joining the CCP, Ch'en 
enrolled in the Labor University in Wusung. He 
participated in Party work in nearby Shanghai, was 
arrested by police authorities, and was briefly 
imprisoned. 
Released from prison in 1927, Ch'en went to 
Moscow, where for 3 years he studied Communist 
ideology and propaganda tactics at the Sun Yat-
sen University. While there, Ch'en remained 
aloof from the "28 Bolsheviks," a group of Chinese 
students who later returned to China and followed 
Comintern policies. Because of his attitude, the 
group ostracized Chien, and in 1930 one of its 
members, Ch'in Pang-hsien (4440/6721/2009), offi-
cially criticized him for practicing "factionalism." 
Teacher and Writer  
Returning to China in 1930, Ch'en, using the 
alias Ch'en Chih-mei (7115/1807/2734), became a 
history lecturer at Peking's China University. 
This school had the largest number of underground 
Communist Party members of any college or univer-
sity in Peking. Ch'en actively supported the CCP 
during political demonstrations that occupied the 
student community in Peking during the mid-1930's. 
Also, along with a number of others, he carried on 
underground Party work in nearby Tientsin. 
While teaching in Peking, Ch'en, under the 
name Po-ta, wrote a series of articles advocating

a new enlightenment movement for China. When 
war with Japan appeared imminent he supported the 
Chinese Communist call for a united front with 
the Chinese Nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek. 
He urged Chinese intellectuals and students to 
resist all foreign aggression, and he vigorously 
rejected all attempts to revive Confucianism. 
Chten's articles were generally read by the young 
Chinese leftist intelligentsia and gained him his 
first claim to fame. 
The Propagandist 
After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War 
in 1937, Ch'en went to Yenan, the remote Communist 
headquarters Mao had established in Shensi Province. 
He was assigned as an instructor in the CCP Party 
School and as director of the research section of 
the CCP Propaganda Department. He has not been 
identified in the latter post for a long time but 
is probably still the Politburo member who exer-
cises the most influence over the research section's 
operation. 
Ch'en's literary output during the 1930's was 
mainly confined to rewriting and interpreting party 
doctrine on a wide variety of topics. The subject 
matter of his articles included Chinese classical 
philosophy, 19th century Chinese history (an Ameri-
can scholar describes Chien as a competent historian 
of this period), and attacks on various Chinese 
warlords and nationalist leaders of the 20th century. 
After his arrival in Yenan, Ch'en wrote 
commentaries focused on Communist Party topics. 
These included articles on the Chinese Civil War 
of 1927-36; notes on Mao's Hunan peasant report; 
critiques of the land tax in China; and several 
works commenting on and praising Mao Tse-tung. 
Mao's "Brain Trust"  
When Mao arrived in Yenan in late 1936, he was 
not regarded as a serious Communist theorist. He 
- 4 - 
SECRET

was criticized by influential and powerful Moscow-
trained Party members, who tended to demean him as 
a "local Communist" who did not really understand 
Marxism-Leninism. Mao therefore enlisted a number 
of intellectuals and writers to aid him in develop-
ing a reputation as a theoretician, to formulate 
doctrine, and to serve as his spokesmen on ideo-
logical subjects. These men were all trained 
propagandists. 
Initially, Mao ignored Ch'en Po-ta because he 
was a poor public speaker and an introvert. Upon 
reading some of Ch'en's works, however, he became 
impressed by the latter's intellect, fervor and 
writing style and added him to his inner group of 
theoreticians. Ch'en soon became one of Mao's 
political secretaries. 
Soon after the organization of his "brain 
trust" a prolific production of political articles 
by Mao began. The relative proportion of these 
works drafted by his team and by Mao himself is 
unknown, but all are indelibly stamped with Mao's 
imprimatur and are part of his theoretical arsenal. 
All members of the "brain trust" benefited person-
ally from their close association with Mao, 
receiving various promotions and important Party 
assignments. (All but Ch'en have now either died 
or been purged.) 
Ch'en remained in Yenan until 1942, when he 
was sent to Chungking to become an editor of the 
local CCP journal, Hsin-hua Jih-pao, and to work 
at the Shenghuo Bookstore. While there, Ch'en was 
presumably under the direction of Chou En-lai, 
then the principal CCP representative in China's 
wartime capital. By 1943 Ch'en was back in Yenan, 
where he resumed his duties with the CCP Propaganda 
Department. 
Late 1940's--Early 1950's  
After World War II Ch'en produced several 
polemical works attacking the political and economic 
leaders of the Chinese Nationalists. His 1948-49 
critiques of Chiang Kai-shek's China's Destiny were 
bitter, effective and widely read.

As a representative of the social sciences, 
Ch'en attended the united front Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), which 
met in September 1949 to establish the People's 
Republic of China on 1 October. (He was also 
elected a delegate to the Second, Third and Fourth 
CPPCCs, in 1954, 1959 and 1964, respectively.) 
Ch'en's activities in the early 1950's were 
focused primarily on propaganda. He shared 
responsibility for writing many of the important 
editorials in the Party's central daily newspaper, 
Jen-min Jih-pao. He also published several pro-
Stalin and pro-Mao articles; one important article--
"Mao Tse-tung's Theory of the Chinese Revolution 
is the Combination of Marxism-Leninism with the 
Chinese Revolution"--appeared on the 30th anniver-
sary of the CCP, in 1951. Other articles criticized 
Chang Wen-t'ien, Ch'en Shao-yil and Li Li-san, all 
members of the CCP-CC and former leaders of the 
Party. The attack against Ch'en Shao-yil (Wang Ming) 
was the most extreme the CCP had published to that 
point. 
In 1953 Ch'en Po-ta retired into an unexplained 
2-year period of relative seclusion from public 
affairs. 
Agricultural Spokesman--The Collective, the Commune  
and Hung Ch'i  
In March 1955 Ch'en reemerged into public view 
as deputy director of the Rural Work Department of 
the CCP-CC. He was not entering an unfamiliar 
area, for in the past 20 years he had steeped him-
self in Mao's concepts of the Chinese peasant and 
land system. Chien was given the task of promoting 
agricultural collectivization, under Mao's direction. 
In October 1955, before the Sixth Plenum of the CCP-
CC, he delivered an "Explanation on the Draft 
Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation. 
This speech was part of a bitter debate within the CC. 
Mao's forces eventually won, and collectivization 
was adopted as a Party policy.

In 1958 Mao proposed the commune as a new 
organizational form for agriculture. Again, 
debate on his new idea within and outside the 
party was intense. In a move to insure that his 
views on the commune and other topics would be 
heard, Mao created a new Party journal, Hung 
Ch'i, and appointed Ch'en Po-ta as its editor. 
(The journal replaced Hs17eh-hsi as the major 
theoretical periodical of the CCP.) 
Ch'en now had a vehicle through which he 
could express himself, and he wrote articles in 
the first several issues of the journal. Ch'en 
has kept himself directly involved in the publica-
tion of Hung Ch'i since 1958, but when he is 
working on other projects for Mao, his associates 
direct the journal's activities. He has not 
always had complete control of Hung Ch '1. For 
instance, during the early stages of the Cultural 
Revolution, reports indicated that he was unable 
to persuade all the Hung Ch '1 editors to support 
the goals of Mao's campaign. Only after the 
recalcitrant editors were reprimanded did the 
journal join in publicizing the Cultural 
Revolution. 
The Cultural Revolution  
In 1965, as he had so often done before, 
Mao called on Ch'en Po-ta to aid him in waging 
political and ideological war. Ch'en was one 
of Mao's most trusted confidants from the 
beginning of the Cultural Revolution. In the 
preplanning phases of the campaign and through-
out the violent twistings and turnings of the 
revolution, Ch'en remained loyally committed 
to Mao. 
By early 1366 Mao had decided that P'eng 
Chen (1756/4176), the first chief executive of 
the Cultural Revolution, was unfit and should 
be replaced. In July Mao named Ch'en head of 
the reorganized CRG. Ch'en's main associates 
in this body were K'ang Sheng, adviser; Chiang 
Ch'ing, Mao's wife and first deputy to Ch'en; 
Chang Ch'un-ch'iao and Yao Wen-yilan, leaders 
from Shanghai who espoused radical solutions;

and last, but probably most important, Chou En-lai, 
who, although not a member of the CRG, appeared 
with its leaders before large groups and was its 
most effective spokesman. 
Some lower-ranking members of the CRG became 
identified with certain excesses of the campaign 
and were eventually criticized and dropped from 
CRG membership. These people endangered the repu-
tation but not the overall authority of the CRG. 
The CRG supposedly selected victims for purge 
and/or criticism, initially formed the Red Guards, 
and in stages approved slates of candidates for 
local, provincial and national office of practically 
every organization in China from mid-1966 through 
1969. 
Following the August 1966 Plenum of the CCP-CC, 
the Red Guards were given a free hand to purge 
anti-Party and antisocialist bourgeois national and 
provincial leaders who did not give wholehearted 
allegiance to the Cultural Revolution.

As the purge movement spread through the 
provinces, the CRG lost control. For a period 
during the summer of 1967, the nation was close 
to anarchy. The country's leaders were forced 
to move rapidly toward restoring order, and this 
task was largely carried out by regional military 
commanders, many of whom had been under fire from 
militant Red Guard factions responsive to the CRG. 
This brought about the purge within the lower 
echelons of the CRG, but its top leaders, such as 
Ch'en Po-ta, sought to disassociate themselves 
from events of the period. 
The CRG itself has not been mentioned since 
late 1969, and with the winding down of the Cultural 
Revolution, its authority has undoubtedly been 
circumscribed. 
Scientific and Economic Planning Positions  
Ch'en Po-ta has represented Mao on several 
important planning committees. He was named to the 
ad hoc Scientific Planning Committee when it was 
organized in 1956 to formulate a long-range plan 
for the social and natural sciences. 
In November 1962 Ch'en became one of seven 
new vice chairmen of the State Planning Commission 
(responsible for long-range economic planning) of 
the State Council. The organization soon began 
work in earnest on development of the Third Five 
Year Plan. Ch'en has not been identified with the 
commission since 1965, and it is not known whether 
he is still active in its affairs. 
When the Chinese Academy of Sciences was 
restructured in October 1949 Ch'en was appointed a 
vice president. This was an honorary position, and 
he did not participate actively in internal adminis-
trative discussions within the academy. Chou En-lai, 
with Mao's approval, named Ch'en honorary head of a 
revolutionary committee of the Academy of Sciences 
in July 1967. Not much is known of the activities 
of this committee or of Ch'en's role in it. 
Other scholarly positions that Ch'en has held 
since 1949 include those of vice president of the

Marxism-Leninism Institute, member of the Associ-
ation for Reforming the Chinese Written Language, 
and member of the academy's Department of Philo-
sophy and Social Sciences. 
Central Committee Membership  
Ch'en was elected an alternate member of the 
CCP-CC in April 1945, at the Seventh Party Congress. 
He was elevated to full voting membership in 1946, 
after the deaths of several CCP-CC members. He was 
reelected a CC member at the Eighth and Ninth Party 
Congresses, in 1956 and 1969, respectively. 
MAO, LIN, CHOU, CHIEN AND KIANG VOTING AT 
NINTH PARTY CONGRESS, 969 
Ch'en was first placed on the Politburo in 
September 1956 as an alternate member. He was pro-
moted to full member in August 1966 and to member 
of the Politburo Standing Committee by October 
1966. 
Travel and Honorific Positions  
Ch'en has traveled abroad only to the Soviet 
Union. In addition to his stay there in the 1920's, 
he accompanied Mao when the latter was negotiating 
the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance

during December 1949-February 1950 and when the 
celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the 
October Revolution took place in 1957. 
Ch'en represented Shanghai at the Second 
National People's Congress (NPC) in 1958 and was 
elected a deputy to the Third NPC in 1964. 
Personal Data  
Ch'en is married. His wife was supposedly a 
classmate and friend of Nieh Yilan-tzu (5119/0337/ 
2737), the radical firebrand of Peking University 
during the Cultural Revolution.
