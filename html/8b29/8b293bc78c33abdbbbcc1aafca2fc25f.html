 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 USSR.  Soviet representative offers proposal for armament census:  In
 an approach to a member of the US delegation to the UN General Assembly,
 Soviet delegate Tsarapkin suggested a US-Soviet meeting on outstanding
 issues. Specifically, he maintained that the Soviet Union was prepared
 for an international armament census and inspection of arms production.
 Alleging that real international inspection was meant, Tsarapkin said
 it must be "based on abolition of the use of atomic weapons in warfare
 and on a limitation of conventional armaments."  (S Paris US DELGA?70,
 7 Nov 51)
 Commentm  Tsarapkin's remarks probably foreshadow a new Soviet pro-
 posal regarding armaments and atomic weapons in this session of the
 General Assembly.
 The USSR in 1948 rejected a Western proposal for an arms census.
 Soviet acceptance of inspection appears conditioned on prior agree-
 ment to abolition of the use of atomic weapons and to arms limitation.
 The USSR's attitude toward inspection in the atomic energy negotiations
 has been that it should be periodic and limited to announced facilities.
 Tsarapkin's proposal does not appear to provide for atomic energy con-
 trol.
 2.         Comment on Bolshevik Revolution Anniversary speech:  Politburo
 member L. P. Beriya's keynote address on the occasion of the 34th
 Anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution appears designed to emphasize
 to the world the USSR's increased economic and military strength in
 comparison with the rearming West while claiming the continued ex-
 istence of a "basis for agreement" with the West.
 However, Beriya warned Western leaders not to construe the USSR's
 desires for peace as a sign of weakness, repeatedly recalled the Nazi
 invaders' defeat by the Soviet Union at a time when it was much less
 prepared than at present, and stated that another world war would re-
 sult in the destruction of capitalism.
 To emphasize Soviet strength in basic war industries, Beriya gave
 absolute figures rather than percentages for the 1951 increases in
 steel, coal and oil production, and total steel production was hailed
 as roughly equal to that of Great Britain, France, Belgium and Sweden

 Beriya who reputedly heads the Soviet atomic energy program,
 did not  mention the  recent atomic  explosions in the  USSR, but
 he drew particularly marked applause when he stated that the army and
 navy "possess all modern types of weapons."
 Treatment of the Korean war, which received significantly little
 attention in comparison to Bulganin's address on this occasion last
 year, seemed to indicate the Kremlin's desire to disassociate itself
 from this conflict if not to achieve an actual ceasefire.  While Bulganin
 had drawn a parallel between the situation at that time and the early
 reverses of the Bolsheviks iii the civil war period, Beriya, without
 mentioning Chinese assistance, was simply "convinced that the brave
 Korean people will find a worthy way out of the bloody conflict."
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  Organization formed to implement new defense training
 program  In order to facilitate implementation of the new defense act,
 the Union for Cooperation with the Army has been established.  The Union
 consists of a central committee and regional committees.  The Red Cross,
 amateur flyers, Sokols and the People's Militia have already affiliated
 with the Union for the purpose of activating a new program for defense

 education and training of the populace.  Training units will be formed
 in these organizations.  According to Defense Minister Cepicka, the
 army will furnish instructors, training cadre, and materials.  Cepicka
 stated that the new Union must have the widest possible popular partici-
 pation.  (R FBID) 5, 6 Nov 51)
 Comment:  The nature of the defense training is not yet known.
 However, the Union is similar to DOSAAF,the USSR All-Union Society for
 Cooperation with the Army, Air Force, and Navy.  The latter organiza-
 tion has concentrated on building up a reserve of skills which would
 be militarily useful, such as swimming, shooting, driving, and communi-
 cations.                     The Union for Cooperation with the Army thus represents another
 social organization generally conforming to a Soviet model.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1.   IRAN.  Iranian Parliament concerned over increased Tudeh activities:
 The US Embassy in Tehran reports that the Parliamentary session of 4
 November was taken up almost entirely with a discussion of increased
 Tudeh activities.  The deputies stated that the Tudeh was much stronger
 now than it had been at any time since it was outlawed following the
 attempted assassination of the Shah.  Opposition deputy Emami accused
 the government of "establishing a rule by demonstration which it was unable
 to control." (R Tehran 1691, 5 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Both the Communists and the opposition have benefited
 by Mossad?q's policy of permitting free speech and assemblage as long
 as there is no breach of peace.  Opposition criticism of the government's
 policy came to a head recently with the closing of the university after
 Communist-led students had held the president prisoner for eight and
 a half hours.   If Mossadeq, who has reportedly ordered the reopening of
 the university, continues his present policy, he may be faced with
 increased opposition from all sides upon his return from Washington.
 2.  AFGHANISTAN.  Kabul cinemas may use films  r m USSR:  Mohammad Hashim
 Karimi, director of the cinema operated by the Kabul municipality,
 has reported to the US Embassy in Kabul that Pakistan's deliberate
 delay in allowing the transit of Indian films to Afghanistan may force
 Kabul's two cinemas to import films from the USSR.  The Embassy feels
 this is a definite possibility.  The Russians are quite willing to supply
 the films, which they have been prevented from showing until recently.
 On 5 November, a US Embassy officer saw a Soviet diplomat in the office
 of the main Kabul cinema where a Soviet propaganda film was being shown.
 (C Kabul 224, 5 Nov 51)
 Comment.:  The regular showing of Soviet films would afford a good
 new opening for Communist propaganda activities in Afghanistan.
 3.  PAKISTAN.  Sinkiang border ndtrolaenetrates Pakistan;  On 24 July
 a reconnaissance patrol of Sinkiang troops penetrated "2OOO yards into
 the Gilgit area of northernmost Pakistan at 36-37 N, 75-25 E. according
 25X1                                                   Shots were exchanged with a
 Pakistani patrol but no casualties were reported on either side.
 Pakistani military sources stated that this was just one of
 several patrols which had entered Pakistan recently and that the event

 Comment: Little is known of activities along the poorly defined bor-
 der between Sinkiang and Pakistan.  The Chinese have been actively patrol-
 ling and crossing the borders of Gilgit and Kashmir since the Communist
 seizure of Sinkiang.  Pakistan has taken the position it cannot afford to
 antagonize China in such matters.
 4.
 INDIA.  Political developments in Kashmir:  On 1 November, Ghulam Saddiq
 was elected permanent President of the newly-convened Kashmir Constituent
 Assembly.  (U New Delhi 1552, 1 Nov; U New Delhi 1563, 2 Nov 51)
 Comme n :  Ghulam Saddiq is reputedly one of the leading Communists
 in Kashmir.  Long an important adviser in Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah's
 government, Saddiq is now in a favorable position to increase his power
 and influence.
 Under Saddiq's guidance, the Constituent Assembly may be expected to
 uphold Sheikh Abdullah's recent statement that, except in foreign affairs,
 the people of Kashmir have full freedom to draft a Constitution according
 to their own desires.  The Assembly may act on the Sheikh's suggestion that
 Kashmir cooperate with India but retain its sovereignty as a state.
 India has publicly advocated the establishment of the Assembly and
 has championed the right of the Kashmiris to decide their own fate, which
 India confidently expects to be accession to India.  Pending a final so-
 lution of the problem by the United Nations, India might experience some
 embarrassment if it prevented the Kashmiris from assuming a considerable
 degree of autonomy.
 If the Abdullah government continues its Communist-tinged policies
 and if Kashmir becomes a semi-autonomous state, Communist capabilities
 for obtaining control of the Himalayan borderlands adjacent to India and
 Pakistan will be materially improved.
 MALAYA.  Br powers for militar ,,,hinted:  A recent announcement by the
 government of the Federation of Malaya with regard to the powers of the
 Director of Operations (against the "bandits") implies, in the opinion of
 the US Consulate General, the granting of still more sweeping powers to
 General Lockhart, the new Director who arrives this month.  The Consulate
 does not believe that martial law will be declared.  (S Singapore Weeka 44,
 3 Nov 51)

 interned in Indochina, to set up "French language study groups" among
 his men suggests that recent reports that he has been collaborating with
 the French authorities in organizing a trans-border intelligence network
 may have some basis.  (S Saigon Weeks 44, 4 Nov 51)
 Comments  The Chinese Nationalist authorities have been attempting
 for some time to foist their services on the French.  The French, fearful
 of antagonizing the Chinese Communists, have reacted cautiously to these
 overtures.
 7.   CHINA.  Chinese Communist fames exhorted to emulate Soviet Army:  The
 Peiping radio, commenting on the recent en bloc enrollment of Chinese
 Communist forces in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, has informed
 the troops that their participation in the SSFA will instruct them in
 "patriotism and internationalism" and in the "advanced military science"
 of the USSR, and will further strengthen the Sino-Soviet alliance.  The
 troops have been told that their work in the SSFA will consist of studying
 Communist theory and practice, learning Soviet military science, and
 spreading propaganda to the "masses.`  The broadcast also advised the
 troops that "the Soviet Union of today is the China of tomorrow,"' that
 the Soviet Army is the "long-range" model for-Chinese Communist forces,
 and that the USSR is the "best friend of the Chinese people."  (R FBID
 Peiping, 6 Nov 51)
 Cgmmento:  The CCF''s enrollment by fiat in the SSFA was announced a
 month ago.  At the time, Peiping gave the figure of 5,000,000 for the
 CCF, almost 1,400,000 in excess of the accepted figure for field forces,
 military district troops and naval and air forces; the 6 November broad-
 cast gives no figures.  Indoctrination on Stalinist lines has been con-
 ducted throughout the CCF for some years, and the activity of the
 political apparatus in the CCF has been directed toward Stalinist goals.
 The planned intensification of such indoctrination and activity in the
 CCF will tighten the Soviet grip on the armed forces of the Peiping
 regime and will further reduce Peiping's capabilities for pursuing an
 independent line if the desire should ever arise.
 8.        Mao feliei ate Stalin orthe anniversary of the 0ctober Reyglutip :
 Mao Tse-tung's message to Stalin on 7 November, the 34th anniversary of
 the October Revolution, extends "heartfelt greetings," offers congratula-
 tions on various alleged Soviet achievements and salutes the "unshakeable
 and great friendship" between the USSR and Communist China.  Sino-Soviet
 friendship,"which grows ever closer," is said to be the "most reliable
 guarantee" of victory for the Soviet cause.  (R FBID flimsy, 6 Nov 51)
 Commen.ta  Mao's message corresponds roughly to Stalin's "friendly

 greetings" to Mao on 1 October, the second anniversary of the founding of
 the Peiping regime, which expressed a wish for further Chinese Communist
 successes and for consolidation of the Sino-Soviet alliance.  As usual,
 Mao's tone in this message to Stalin is deferential but not obsequious.
 9?            Kao Kang and Lin Piao move up in Revolutionary Military Council:
 Peiping radio has announced the appointment of Kao Kang and Lin Piao as
 Vice-Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Council. (R FBID
 Peiping, 6 Nov 51)
 Comment:  Kao is Chairman of the Northeast (Manchuria) People's
 Governmenommanding officer and political commissioner of the North-
 east Military District, and Secretary of the Party's regional bureau.
 Lin is Chairman of the Central-South China Military and Political Com-
 mittee, commanding officer of the Fourth Field Army, and Secretary of the
 regional. bureau.  The. Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council,
 which controls the armed forces of the Peiping regime, is Mao Tse-tung,
 and four of the five present Vice-Chairmen are also members of the party's
 Central Committee.  The elevation of Kao and Lin will add two more
 Stalinists to the leadership of the Military Council.
 10.           Peiping comments on significance of October Revolution:  People's
 China, a publication of the Peiping regime, observes the   November `-a"~rixi3.
 versary of the October Revolution by informing its readers that current
 events have exposed with unprecedented clarity the contrast between the
 Soviet bloc and the West.  The former represents "peace, democracy and
 progress," the latter "retrogression, war and terror."  The USSR is
 "politically and economically stronger than ever before" and counts as
 its "great ally" the People's Republic of China.  The people of Asia can
 see the "path to the future of all mankind" charted by the October Revolu-
 tion of 1917, and can see also the Chinese revolution as the "prototype"
 for colonial and semi-colonial countries.  (R FBID, 6 Nov 51)_
 Comment:  Chinese Communist spokesmen have made all of these points,
 usually a somewhat less gaudy rhetoric, on other occasions.  Interna-
 tional Communist propaganda characterizes the October Revolution as the
 greatest event in history, and the ascendancy of the Chinese Communists
 as next in importance.
 Communist currency depreciates sharply in Hong Kong:  The value
 of Communist  China's currency has declined sharply in the Hong. Kong mar-
 ket.  On 6 November a Hong Kong dollar exchanged for 5,882. Chinese notes.
 The ratio a week earlier had been 5,150 to one.  These figures compare
 with Peiping's official rate of 3,880 to one.  (U. Far East Trader, 31 Oct;

 AP Morsecast Hong Kong, 7 Nov 51)
 Comments  The wide difference between the official and open market
 rates is    recent development and reflects the declining confidence in
 the Communist currency.  Large military expenditures are forcing the
 regime to increase the amount of money in circulation and are creating
 strong inflationary pressures.  Although the Communists have thus far
 managed fairly well in keeping these pressures under control, prices are
 beginning to move upward.
 12.           Communist donation campaign passes 100 million dollar mark:  Hong
 Kong press accounts report that Peiping has received donations from the
 people and from business concerns amounting to about 100 million dollars.
 These donations, which are made for the declared purpose of enabling the
 Communists to buy airplanes and heavy equipment, come to about 59 per-
 cent of the total amount pledged for the period from July through
 December 1951.  (S Hong Kong 1550, 26 Oct 51)
 Comments The amount which the Chinese people have been forced to
 contribute-71n the donation campaign already exceeds the amount which the
 Communists were able to exact in last year's Victory Bond Campaign.
 Both drives were effective in withdrawing money from circulation and
 countering inflationary pressures.  These pressures, nevertheless, continue
 strong and prices are beginning to rise.
 Communists report on economic progress:  Chinese Communist Vice-
 Premier Men Yun, in a long S:Eatement to the People's Political Consulta-
 tive Conference, reported on agriculture, industry and commerce, and
 finance.    His main points were:
 (1)  Harvests have been generally good, and agricultural output
 will definitely surpass last year's levels.

 iron production in 1951 will be 131 percent of the 1950 figure.
 Comparable percentages"for other items are 11.2 for steel ingots,
 178 for finished steel, 118 for coal, and 122 for electricity.
 (3)  Government expenditures have risen, but the people's patriotism
 in paying taxes promptly has "facilitated the country's finan-
 cial adjustments."  Although the regime has issued more paper
 money, financial stability has not been disturbed.  The country's
 finances are adequate for the needs of national defense.  (R

 Comments  The Communists are probably lowering the price on certain
 imported commodities more as a propaganda gesture than as a reflection of
 improved supply.  The sale of oil products in Shanghai has been closely
 controlled since the UN embargo of July 1950, and on 15 August (after the
 first price cut) the gasoline ration for private automobiles was cut from
 about 25 to 15 gallons a month.

 17.   JAPAN.  Tripartite fishing conference opens in Tokyo:  A tripartite fish-

 Tokyo.  This is the first-of a series of negotiations aimed at conclusion
 of bilateral or multilateral fishing agreements which Japan will undertake
 in compliance with Article 9 of the peace treaty.  (U FBIf Tokyo Jiji, 6
 Nov 51)
 Coinents  Since this is the first important postwar international
 conference at which Japan will sit as an equal negotiator, the conference
 has created unusual interest in Japan.  In the current negotiations, Japan
 hopes to establish a precedent by which freedom of fisheries on the high
 seas will be recognized, thus weakening the expected attempts of other
 nations in future negotiations to exclude the Japanese from certain high
 seas fishing areas.

 SECTION 3  (WESTERN)
 1.   AUSTRIA.   Schismatic socialists call for unity    h-Gommunists:      its
 Nov
 first national congress in Vienna on 3 and 4
 Socialist /orker's Party of Erwin Scharf passed a resolution calling
 for a continuation and strengthening of the "combat union" of leftist
 socialists and the Communists.  Member of Parliament Scharf was
 redesignated party chairman.  Left-wing Italian Socialist Pietro Nenni
 visited the congress while he was in Vienna attending the World Peace
 Council meeting, and Austrian Communists proffered felicitations
 ?~reiehiseheZeitun,6Jov51)
 to the Socialists.  (R FBIS
 Comment:  Erwin Scharf defected from the Austrian Socialist Party
 in 1948 and was expelled for his advocacy of all-out cooperation with
 the Communists.  The party which he subsequently formed has attracted
 very little support, and, as a "socialist" front for various Communist
 schemes, has been of limited effectiveness.
 The congress of the Austrian Communist Party, which likewise
 convened in Vienna last week, also strongly emphasized the unity theme.
 2.  BELGIUM.  Belgians reportedly to go slow at the European Defense Forces
 talks:  Accoraing L
 conference at Paris, the Belgian Ambassador to France has again warned
 the chiefs of the delegations that his government might not permit the
 work at the conference to continue on the basis of the proposed supra-
 national institutions.  The Belgians object, among other things, to a
 common budget and prefer instead a voluntary contribution from each
 member nation to meet certain common expenses. As a result, the
 Belgian delegation is expected to play a more passive role in the talks
 and "take a general reservation" on past and future conference decisions.
 (S Paris 2602, 2 Nov '51)
 Comment:  Shortly after the Benelux Ministers' conference of
 25 October, the Belgian Foreign Minister informed US Embassy officials
 in Brussels that Belgian representatives on the technical committees
 had been instructed to withhold additional views until ministers of
 the member countries at the Paris conference could arranngeoo oar change
 views."  He added that the technical committees hadtg prove embarrassing
 to without           directives,                      them with a fait accompli.

 In view of the recent expression of Dutch opposition to the trend
 of the conference talks, the Benelux countries may withdraw from the
 conference unless their demands are met.

 ITALY.  Liberal Party enlarges its following:  Unification with the
 Liberal Party of progressive-minded individuals and groups who have
 remained out of or seceded from the party is practically complete.  The
 unified party will oppose alliances with the neo-fascists and monarchists
 and support government policy in general..
 The US Embassy in Rome comments that the party, though small, will
 have a healthy influence since it offers a democratic alternative in the
 next national elections for conservative voters disappointed in the
 policy of the Christian Democrat-dominated government.
 The Embassy adds that it is not yet known whether the Liberals will
 return to the government or remain out until after the next national
 elections.  (R FBIS, Rome Radio, 6 Nov 51; S Rome Joint Weeka 43,
 26 Oct 51)
 Comment:  The conservative Liberal Party, which has consistently
 rejected Premier de Gasperi's offer to return to the Cabinet, showed
 an increase in strength in the May-June local elections.  With this
 new addition of "progressive" groups, it should offer an even greater
 appeal in the next national elections to conservatives who, while
 favoring democratic processes, oppose many of the government's domestic
 policies and might otherwise give their support to the neo-fascists.
 The party could draw from the Christian Democratic right wing, although
 the Liberals' anti-clerical position would reduce their appeal to
 this group.  An increase in the Liberals' parliamentary representation
 would enable groups with vested interests to block the government's
 program of socio-economic reform even more effectively than they have
 done heretofore.
 4.    SPAIN.  First step taken to simplify foreign trade controls:  In what
 he has informed the US Embassy is designed as the first move toward
 simplification of Spain's complicated multiple exchange rate system,
 Minister of Commerce Arburua has reduced the number of export exchange
 rates.  (Under the multiple rate system, which has long been a major
 handicap to Spanish foreign trade expansion, each import and export
 commodity is assigned a special exchange rate.)  At the same time he
 abolished compensation and combined accounts.  (These barter trade
 "accounts" have been utilized by Spanish industry, especially the
 textile industry, as its principal means of importing essential goods
 for which the government would not grant foreign exchange.)
 Arburua believes that these measures will appreciably reduce
 black market foreign exchange transactions and will soon be followed
 by simplification of import exchange rates.  He pointed out that,
 because of the complexity of Spain's exchange and economic controls,

 TOP SECRET
 he must proceed cautiously toward a less rigid system.  (U Madrid 447,
 2 Nov 51; C Madrid 448, 2 Nov 51)
 Comment:   The Minister of Commerce evidently feels that US dollar
 aid and Spain's recently improved export trade will make it possible
 for him to remove these restraints on foreign trade, to attack currency
 speculation, and to stabilize prices.  His recent action, although it
 does indicate an intention to normalize trade, does not represent
 any drastic step toward removal of rigid governmental trade controls.
 Furthermore, recent reports indicate that his decision to abolish
 compensation and combined accounts was influenced by a desire to prevent
 a scandal over cotton speculations and the possible bankruptcy of a
 number of important textile firms.
 5.  PORTUGAL.  Unification of Army and Navy air arms reportedly a
 22 October Premier Salazar approved the Portuguese Defense minister's
 plan for the unification of the Army and Navy air arms.  According to
 I                   lunification would give the Air Force an equal status
 with the Army and Navy and place it under direct control of the
 Minister of Defense.  (S Lisbon Joint Weeka 43, 24 Oct 51)
 Comment:  Unification would appear to conform with the Portuguese
 Government's intention of strengthening the Air Force's capabilities
 to fulfill its obligations under NATO.  There have been several
 indications that the Defense Minister is grooming Brigadier Anselmo
 Vilardebo, a protege of President Craveiro Lopes, for the post of
 chief of the new combined air arms.  Vilardebo is more internationally
 minded and reputedly more capable than the present Commanding General
 of the Portuguese Army Air Force.
 6.  MOROCCO.  French press in Morocco campaigns to discredit US representa-
 tives:  The French-language press in Morocco is continuing its campaign
 to make scapegoats of American representatives there.  The Resident
 General's remarks that US diplomatic representatives should be instructed
 to be "neutral" have been widely featured.  US diplomats in North Africa
 are openly accused of cooperating with extremists and the Resident
 General is requested to exact guarantees of non-assistance.  (C Casablanca
 29, 6 Nov 51)
 Comment:  French interests in Morocco bitterly resent the
 continuance of US extraterritorial privileges.  Much of the French
 press in the area has also been frequently critical of the US.  The
 current campaign, however, has concentrated its attack upon American
 representatives rather than upon the more generalized aspects of
 American "imperialism."

 Comment:  Opposition elements, including some members of the
 armed forces, may attempt an uprising against Peron, but it is unlikely
 that they can attract sufficient army support to stage a successful
 revolt.  While the possibility that key army generals might turn against
 Peron cannot be completely discounted, it is more likely that they
 will continue their policy of support and watchful waiting through next
 Sunday's elections.  There are indications that the army would prefer
 to have Peron remain in power subject to its terms.
 8.                Senora de Peron undergoes major o eration:  On 6 November
 Senora de Peron was operated on by a team of surgeons, including a
 US cancer specialist.   (U NY Times, 7 Nov 51)
 Comment: Information indicates that Senora de Peron may have been
 suffering from cancer for some time, although government bulletins have
 avoided mentioning the nature of her illness.  If she is seriously
 incapacitated, her extensive political influence, which has been one
 of the army's strongest objections to Peron's administration, will be
 sharply curtailed.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 GREECE.   No Russian protest over Greek NATO membership received as_,yet:
 A Greek Foreign Office spokesman, in response to a query from the Turkish
 Ambassador in Athens, said that no note has yet been received from the
 USSR protesting Greece's contemplated accession to NATO.  The Government
 has decided, however, that if such a protest is received it will be
 "firmly rejected and the accusations turned back against the Soviets."
 The spokesman also informed the US Embassy in Athh,ens that while Greece did
 not expect a Soviet note at this time it was thought advisable to indicate
 to the Turks that the Greek attitude toward the Soviets "remained firm and
 unyielding."  (S S/S Athens 2112, 6 Nov 51)
 Comment: A Soviet protest to Greece may be anticipated.  On 31
 October the USSR delivered a note to Turkey warning the latter against
 membership in NATO, and unconfirmed press reports state that Rumania and
 Bulgaria sent notes to Turkey on 6 November.
