 There are growing indica-
 tions that Moscow is about to
 end its self-imposed moratorium
 on polemics with Peiping and to
 renew efforts to convene a world
 Communist conference to condemn
 the Chinese.   These plans ap-
 parently were discussed at the
 Soviet central committee plenum
 last month, at which Khrushchev
 denounced the "newly baked Trot-
 skyites" who, while making "high
 -sounding revolutionary phrases,"
 are undermining the Communist
 movement with their "splitting
 activities."
 Immediately after the So-
 viet plenum ended on 15 February,
 the Soviets apparently outlined
 their plans for dealing with the
 Chinese to foreign Communist
 parties.   They received Bulgar-
 ian, Hungarian, and Italian party
 delegations in Moscow.  Khru-
 shchevmet with the Yugoslav am-
 bassador on 27 February and the
 Soviet ambassador called Tito
 on the 24th.
 These consultations appear
 to have revived fears among for-
 eign parties of the consequences
 of an explosive showdown and
 stimulated efforts to forestall
 such a development.   According
 to                                  the
 US Embassy in  Moscow, the re-
 sumption of  Soviet public po-
 lemics was postponed, primarily
 at the instigation of the Ital-
 ian party, to permit a final
 appeal to Peiping to accept a
 moratorium on polemics.
 At this point, the Rumanian
 party announced on 26 February
 that it had accepted a Chinese
 invitation to hold top-level talks
 in Peiping to discuss the unity
 of the world Communist movement,
 as well as bilateral relations.
 Bucharest may have acted in out-
 right defiance of Soviet wishes.
 It is more likely, however,  that
 the Rumanians, possibly acting
 as spokesmen for other parties
 which share their fears of a
 showdown, discussed the visit
 with the Soviets, who had no
 choice but to acquiesce. Pravda's
 treatment of the visit appears
 designed to show lack of concern,
 if not actual approval.  On the
 other hand, the Soviet ambassador
 at a diplomatic reception in
 Bucharest reportedly expressed
 extreme irritation at Rumania's
 "presumptuous" action.
 Whatever the origin of this
 mission, the Soviet leaders prob-
 ably believe there is little
 chance of a favorable Chinese
 response.   They may calculate
 that the failure of this "final
 effort" will help them overcome
 the reluctance of important for-
 eign parties, such as the Ital-
 ian Communists,  to begin prepara-
 tions for a conference to condemn
 the Chinese.

 Moscow may also attempt to
 portray tLe current Sino-Soviet
 border talks in Peiping as fur-
 ther proof that it is trying to
 resolve differences and create
 favorable conditions for a world
 Communist conference.
 ese talks will be confined to
 technical questions, such as
 border markings and the location
 of river channels, in limited
 stretches of the border. Although
 little territory is involved,
 the alignment of the Amur became
 a major item in dispute last
 fall when Moscow complained of
 illegal Chinese occupation of
 disputed islands in the river
 and warned that the continuation
 of such border violations "would
 be tantamount to embarking on a
 very dangerous path."
 The apparent Soviet decision
 to resume a public offensive
 probably was based on the belief
 that recent Chinese actions not
 only required a vigorous response
 but created an opportune moment
 for which Moscow has been waiting
 since last October.  Peiping-'s
 4 February Red Flag - People's
 Daily article contemptuously re-
 jected Khrushchev's appeal for a
 cessation of polemics and pictured
 it as evidence of weakness on
 the part of the CPSU.  Khrushchev
 obviously has a strong incentive
 to disprove Peiping's scornful
 charge that the Soviet warning
 last September of a "most reso-
 lute rebuff" from the CPSU was
 nothing but bluff.  He may feel
 that recent Chinese efforts to
 split pro-Soviet foreign parties
 and to establish ideological
 sanction for a bid to replace
 Moscow as the leader of the world
 Communist movement will strengthen
 The Communist World
 the Soviet case that an unequiv-
 ocal denunciation of Peiping's
 activities can no longer be post-
 poned.
 The first step in a new
 Soviet offensive presumably will
 be the publication of the CPSU
 letter to the Chinese and speeches
 and documents on the Sino-Soviet
 conflict presented at the Soviet
 party plenum last month.  Moscow
 probably will take this action as
 soon as the outcome of the Ru-
 manian mission becomes known.
 Peiping has clearly been
 delighted by the Rumanian move.
 The delegation was met at the
 airport on 2 March by Liu Shao-
 chi and party secretary general
 Teng Hsiao-ping and has since
 been impressively entertained.
 Chinese coverage of the visit
 has been designed to maximize
 the gain in prestige already
 conferred by the Rumanian pil-
 grimage--the first such visit
 since Khrushchev's trip to
 Peiping in October 1959.
 The Chinese show no incli-
 nation to back off in their
 battle with Moscow and on 1 March
 broadcast a scathing denunciation
 of anti-Chinese material published
 in the Soviet Union.  Peiping
 will probably not cut the Ru-
 manian overture off cold, however.
 Rather, it seems likely to take
 a line calculated to stave off
 any Russian move to force a show-
 down at this point and to encour-
 age intervention by other mem-
 bers of the bloc, thus increasing
 the division of opinion inside
 Moscow's camp.
 During talks with the Ru-
 manians,the Chinese will prob-
 ably attempt to play on Rumanian

 desires for greater independence
 and press for a communique which
 pays lip service to bloc unity
 but at the same time stresses
 "equality" between Communist
 states and the importance of
 greater freedom in economic
 development within the bloc.
 Although the Chinese are unlikely
 to give up any substantive posi-
 tion they have taken in the con-
 flict with Moscow, they will
 probably reiterate that they are
 always ready to engage in bilat-
 eral party talks with the Soviets
 or other parties.   This would
 offer   support to those parties
 seeking an alternative to an
 international conference that
 would formally split the Com-
 munist world.
 SOVIET LEADERS WORK ON ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 Events in the Soviet Union
 this past week showed the lead-
 ership concerned to a high de-
 gree with working out solutions
 to current economic problems and
 with charting the future course
 of economic development.   Con-
 sideration apparently is being
 given to some new policies--
 possibly concerning greater ma-
 terial incentives.
 Top-Level Meeting
 On 28 February an unusual
 top-level meeting was convened
 in Moscow ostensibly.to find
 ways of implementing the de-
 cisions of the central committee
 plenum on agriculture which had
 ended two weeks earlier.   Party
 presidium members, party secre-
 taries, deputy chairmen of the
 USSR Council of Ministers, as
 well as various republic-level
 and local officials heard Khru-
 shchev once again castigate
 Stalin's neglect of agriculture
 .and reaffirm the new fertilizer
 and irrigation programs.
 The brief press summary of
 Khrushchev's report gives no
 clues as to how the regime may
 intend to improve farm incentives,
 although this was evidently an
 important topic both at last
 week's meeting and at the agri-
 cultural plenum.   The main thrust
 of Khrushchev's remarks at both
 meetings seemed to hinge on se-
 lective increases in wages for
 those who make the greatest con-
 tribution to production--pre-
 sumably without large over-all
 increases in the farm wage bill.
 Khrushchev also discussed
 at last week's meeting the per-
 ennial problem of scattering
 resources among too many build-
 ing projects.   He again called
 for greater central control,
 particularly to ensure adequate
 equipment and machinery for
 chemical projects.
 The importance of the as-
 semblage at last week's meeting
 contrasted sharply with the com-
 plete lack of novelty in the
 issues summarized in the press
 release.   This could mean that
 the regime this year feels com-
 pelled to work more closely on
 economic details connected with
 the chemical and farm programs;
 it could also mean that the

 meeting was called to consider
 how to deal with resistance to
 the present course of action.
 Khrushchev spoke of bureaucratic
 foot-dragging at the plenum last
 month.  The meeting may also have
 been told of some new policy de-
 cision concerning Sino-Soviet
 affairs (see preceding article).
 Arzumanyan Article
 Probably also related to
 Moscow's current concern with
 economic matters was the wide-
 ranging article by the well-known
 economist A. Arzumanyan which
 appeared in Pravda of 24 and 25
 February. Invoking Lenin at fre-
 quent intervals, Arzumanyan set
 out an elaborate defense of the
 current Khrushchev economic pro-
 gram.   He then leveled a compre-
 hensive attack on "Stalinist"
 adherence to heavy industry for
 its sake alone and on economic
 planning which does not favor
 those branches that support tech-
 nological advance but, rather,
 programs all industries to de-
 velop "arithmetically" with no
 regard to their economic contri-
 bution.
 Neither of these oversim-
 plifications is new---Khruschchev
 has often used them in dicuss-
 ing the need for greater re-
 sources for agriculture and the
 consumer goods program.   Arzuman-
 yan, however, extended his argu-
 ments well beyond any point to
 which Khrushchev has publicly
 committed himself.
 According to Arzumanyan,
 the unconditional development
 of heavy industry (group "A" in
 Soviet jargon) is not necessarily
 a requisite of rapid growth dur-
 ing all phases of economic his-
 tory.   Citing the US as an ex-
 ample, he attempted to show that
 there can be rapid technological
 development even though the out-
 put of consumer goods (group
 "B") is rising much more rapidly
 then that of heavy industry.
 Policy concerning the
 planned growth rates of "A" in-

 in recent years, symbolizing the

 said that
 in the future light and heavy
 industry would develop at the
 same rate.  However, the formula
 adopted later that year by the
 22nd party congress held that
 the growth rate of "B" would
 only gradually approach that of
 "A," although heavy industry
 would give increasing support
 to the consumer goods program
 --for example, providing machin-
 ery and equipment for light and
 food industry plants.
 Khrushchev probably is not
 satisfied with this formula.   At
 last month's plenum, he affirmed
 party support for the develop-
 ment of heavy industry but
 strongly asserted that the out-
 put of consumer goods must grow
 more rapidly in the future.

 In Soviet economic terminology, "A" designates mainly heavy industry
 (producer goods) and " B" stands for light industry and food production
 (consumer goods). This distinction involves certain irregularities--refrig-
 erator manufacturers, for example, are grouped under "A". The figures

 If the Arzumanyan article
 is a sign of new efforts to in-
 crease the output of consumer
 goods,it would seem to reflect
 a belated recognition on the part
 of Soviet leaders that an im-
 portant key to economic growth
 is technological advancement
 backed by an incentive-motivated
 work force.. However, judging
 by past performance, the Arzu-
 manyan article probably should
 be treated with reserve.   Since
 the 22nd congress, the consumer
 goods industry has made no head-
 way in catching up.   In fact, in
 1963 the gap between the growth
 rates of "A" and "B" industries
 was wider than it had been for
 several years (see chart).  Like-
 wise, heavy industrial production
 and investment plans have gen-
 erally been overfulfilled while
 those for the consumer goods in-
 dustries are frequently not met.
 In terms of immediate ben-
 efits to the consumer, any new
 program would have to be very
 large to make an appreciable
 change in the balance now so
 strongly favoring heavy industry.
 However, in terms of resources,
 even an attempt to equalize growth
 rates could mean further strain
 on an already overcommitted econ-
 omy.                It is possibly in antici-
 pation of resistance to any ef-
 fort to change the ratio of "A"
 and "B" that Arzumanyan used so
 much of his article debating with
 unnamed "economists and workers"
 who fail to understand the need
 to drop Stalin's approach to eco-
 nomic questions.   It is possible
 that Arzumanyan is also arguing
 against resistance which has al-
 ready developed, not over the fu-
 ture course of "A" versus "B"but,
 rather, over the growing share of
 "A" that-is already being devoted
 to agriculture and the consumer
 industries.  Khrushchev, at the
 recent plenum, appeared to be
 responding to dissent in the al-
 most strident manner in which he
 pointed to the prominent role
 his chemical program will play
 in heavy industrial development.
 However, the fact is probably
 not lost on critics of this pro-
 gram that ultimately it is the
 consumer industries which will
 benefit heavily from "chemical-
 ization of the economy."
 Tighter Labor Controls Proposed
 Some action was suggested
 last week in another area of con-
 cern to the regime with the ap-
 pearance of a letter in Izvestia
 urging that the worker's labor
 record become a principal docu-
 ment of identification, replacing
 the internal passport.  A worker
 presumably would be deterred from
 frequent job-changing by embar-
 rassment at having this made a
 matter of  important record.   In
 turn, the labor card could be
 the basis for preferential treat-
 ment and reward for longevity.
 This proposal is obviously
 intended to reinstate some control
 over what has become a relatively
 "free" labor market and encourage
 workers--particularly in agr.cul-
 ture--to stay in the specialties
 for which they were trained.  How-
 ever, such a rule, which could
 reduce labor turnover somewhat,
 would still be far milder than
 the Draconian labor laws of Sta-
 lin's time which virtually froze    25X1
 a worker to a particular job at
 the discretion of the regime.

 The Communist World
 STILL NO SOVIET CHEMICAL PLANT DEAL IN
 The USSR is moving slowly on
 equipment purchases for its ex-
 panded chemicals production pro-
 gram.   Financial considerations
 are the chief concern,  and Moscow
 apparently hopes its first major
 deal will establish credit prece-
 dents for subsequent negotiations.
 It also wants to make sure it gets
 the most advanced technology avail-
 able for its money.
 After two months of negotia-
 tions in the UK, a purchase mis-
 sion led by the head of the Soviet
 chemical machinery import corpora-
 tion and accompanied by two Soviet
 bankers recently returned to Mos-
 cow without buying anything.   Even
 though the British Government guar-
 antees credits up td 15 years, Brit-
 ish lenders may be reluctant to put
 up funds for that period at the low
 rates of interest the USSR is will-
 ing to pay.   Eventually, however,
 these negotiations are expected to
 result in some contracts.
 Soviet purchasing activity not
 directly connected with the chemical
 plant program continues.   Moscow has,
 for example, just purchased three
 Danish refrigerator ships worth over
 $6 million, partially fulfilling its
 stated intention to order 19 Danish
 vessels during the next five years.
 BLOC'S FRIENDSHIP OIL PIPELINE ONE YEAR BEHIND SCHEDULE
 Although Communist Europe
 has heralded the opening of its
 Friendship crude-oil pipeline, the
 main 40-inch section will not be
 completed until late 1964, almost
 one year behind the original sched-
 ule. (see map).
 The delay is due largely to
 a shift in priority to construc-
 tion of gas pipelines.   Most of
 the 40-inch pipeline available
 in 1963 was used to complete on
 schedule the gas line from the
 Gazli field in Soviet Uzbekistan
 to Chelyabinsk in the Urals.   In
 addition, some of the USSR's new
 40-inch-pipe   mills   apparently
 failed to attain the expected rate
 of production.  NATO's agreement
 not to sell large-diameter (partic-
 ularly 40-inch) pipe to the USSR
 indirectly helped delay construc-
 tion, but the USSR probably could
 have obtained pipe from the UK if
 completion of the Friendship line
 had been considered urgent.
 About 500 miles of 40-inch oil
 pipe are yet to be installed be-
 tween Penza and Unecha.   Work also
 is under way on two major offshoots
 of the Friendship Pipeline.  The
 first, the Unecha-Polotsk-Ventspils
 route, will carry crude oil to a
 large refinery being constructed at
 Polotsk and to the Baltic port of
 Ventspils for export to Northern
 Europe.   Secondly,  in Czechoslo-
 vakia, the central system is be-
 ing extended beyond Bratislava
 to the refinery-petrochemical com-
 plex at Zaluzi.
 Demand for oil is increasing
 rapidly in Eastern Europe, which
 has a major refinery construction
 progran under way.   By 1970, when
 the refineries reach their maximum
 capacities, the Friendship Pipe-
 line will not be adequate to handle
 the quantities of crude oil needed,
 and additional carrying capacity
 may have to be     it

 Communist military activity
 in South Vietnam continues at
 a comparatively low rate.  Ter-
 rorism directed against hamlets
 and stepped-up harassment of
 communications routes and power
 lines account for the majority
 of new incidents.   The Viet Cong
 have also been ambushing convoys
 and patrols, and harassing areas
 close  to  main administrative
 centers.    Although no large-
 scale Viet Cong attacks occurred
 during the past week,  two sepa-
 rate government operations south
 and west of Saigon resulted in
 heavy fighting, apparently with
 regular Viet Cong battalions.
 The Communists continue to press
 their propaganda activities.
 The increase of Viet Cong
 harassment activity in the north-
 ern provinces suggests that the
 Viet Cong may intend to inten-
 sify military operations in this
 area in the coming weeks.
 Viet
 Cong propaganda leaflets in
 Kontum Province have proclaimed
 that the latter province would
 be "liberated" in 1964.
 Signs of discontent are
 still prevalent in the upper
 echelons of the Khanh govern-
 ment and among the military.
 Khanh continues to reshuf-
 fle top military commanders in
 an effort to block any coup  lot-
 ting
 He has charged--but without sub-
 stantiation--that the French are
 trying to oust him and were plot-

 Saigon.
 The Khanh regime evidently is
 continuing efforts to gain the sup-
 port of the important religious
 sects, and to win more adherents
 in the countryside.  A Cao Dai
 general has been appointed prov-
 ince chief in Tay Ninh Province,
 where the sect is prominent, and

 Communist forces have
 followed up their recent gains
 in central Laos with moves
 against non-Communist units,
 principally Meo, located east
 of the Plaine des Jarres.  On
 25-26 February, Meo and neutral-
 ist positions on Phou Khe, the
 dominant height between Xieng
 Khouang and the Plaine, were
 overrun by a mixed force of
 Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese
 troops.
 fit appears
 that the Communists still con-
 trol the key ridge overlooking
 Route 4, their supply artery
 from the Plaine to Xieng Khouang.
 Communist forces have also
 stepped up pressure against Meo
 irregulars in the mountains east
 of Xieng Khouang.
 The loss of Phou Khe to the
 Communists has dimmed hopes for
 an early meeting of the faction
 leaders.   Preparatory talks for
 such a "summit" meeting broke
 down, at least temporarily,
 when the rightist representative
 failed to show up for scheduled
 discussions.  Rightist leader
 General Phoumi Nosavan has
 charged that the Phou Khe attack
 "compromised" the talks.
 Phoumi, meanwhile, is tak-
 ing steps to strengthen his
 position in south-central Laos.
 IHe has ordered
 General Siho to mount an opera-
 tion east of Savannakhet to
 clear enemy forces from the
 important rice-growing lowland
 areas.   Siho has moved his
 three paratroop battalions--
 normally located near Vientiane--
 to participate in this action.
 This move will sharply
 reduce the rightist strength
 assigned to the defense of the
 capital, and will also have the
 effect of tipping the power
 balance in Vientiane in favor
 of General Kouprasith Abhay,
 who supports the rightist sub-
 faction led by the Sananikone
 family.

 LEBANON AGAIN FACES PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSION ISSUE
 After over five years of
 relative calm, Lebanon is ap-
 proaching another presidential
 election which could revive the
 religious and political faction-
 alism that led to the civil war
 of 1958.  The paramount issue is
 whether President Shihab, the
 moderate Maronite Christian whose
 election terminated the 1958
 crisis, will seek re-election.
 As it now stands, the constitu-
 tion prohibits a second term for
 the president, but many Lebanese
 believe that Shihab is the only
 leader who can save the country
 from another period of political
 violence.
 Shihab so far has appeared
 reluctant to succeed himself.
 However, the strong sentiment
 favoring a second term for him
 may induce him to change his
 mind--presumably after the,con-
 stitution has been changed.
 New parliamentary elections, to
 be held from 5 April through
 3 May, may be followed by some
 definitive announcement by Shi-
 hab regarding his intentions.
 The new parliament will
 elect the president, probably
 in August.  According to a 21-
 year-old unwritten agreement
 between leaders of the Muslim
 and Christian communities, the
 president is a Maronite and
 the prime minister a Sunni
 Muslim, while other top state
 offices are distributed among
 the less important religious
 groups.
 Ex-President Shamun's at-
 tempt to succeed himself started
 the troubles of 1958.  An effort
 by Shihab to follow suit would
 be opposed by some elements, in-
 cluding Shamun and Maronite Pa-
 triarch Maushi, both of whom
 have long been at odds with him.
 Shihab's popularity among both
 Muslims and Christians generally,
 however, probably would prevent
 sentiment against him from ap-
 proaching the intensity of that
 against Shamun in 1958. Moreover,
 the UAR, which at that time was
 deeply involved in supporting
 Muslim opposition to Shamun, is
 unlikely to intervene against
 Shihab.
 The army also strongly sup-
 ports Shihab, who was its com-
 mander before he became president.

 The 4 March Security Coun-
 cil resolution on Cyprus should
 reduce some of the tension which
 has developed in the eastern
 Mediterranean since mid-Decem-
 ber.                     On 5 March, for the first
 time in several weeks, the Greek
 Cypriot press took a fairly be-
 nevolent attitude toward the US.
 In Athens, Premier Papandreou
 said that adoption of the reso-
 lution would re-establish
 Greece's traditionally good re-
 lations with Britain and the US.
 Public statements in recent
 days by both Greek and Turkish
 leaders have been conciliatory.
 Both present and potential
 problems remain, however.   The
 Greek military are still nerv-
 ous over the continued Turkish
 naval build-up.   Recent joint
 Turkish-US fleet exercises in
 the Aegean caused a violent re-
 action in the Greek press and
 were used to promote the anti-
 American, anti-NATO demonstra-
 tions in Athens.
 UN Secretary General Thant
 is moving swiftly to create the
 international force  called for
 in the Security Council resolu-
 tion.   The size and composition
 are to be determined by him in
 consultation with Cyprus, Greece,
 Turkey, and Britain.   Problems
 could arise over the composition.
 Thant now is seeking one
 battalion of troops each from
 Sweden, Finland, and Ireland,
 and has sounded out other coun-
 ties--including Canada and
 Brazil--for possible contribu-
 tions.   Sweden appears to be
 the key country in this effort,
 with the other nations waiting
 for a decision from Stockholm,
 probably on 6 March.
 The Greek Cypriots insist
 that the international force
 be limited to 7,000--approxi-
 mately the size of the British
 peace-keeping force now on the
 island.   Both the British and
 the UN observer on Cyprus pre-
 viously had recommended a min-
 imum of 10,000.   Thant apparentl,
 has accepted 7,000 as the num-
 ber and favors using 3,000 of
 the British troops already on
 the island, with the rest to
 come from other countries.
 The British have agreed to
 having the UN observer, Indian
 General Gyani, appointed as com-
 mander of the international
 force.    The present British
 commander would become deputy
 commander and chief of staff.

 Problems may also arise
 between the UN force commander
 and the Cypriot Government.
 While Britain, Turkey, and the
 Turkish Cypriots probably fore-
 see the major task of the peace-
 keeping force as re-establishing
 a climate of security for mem-
 bers of both communities on
 Cyprus, the Greek Cypriots ap-
 parently view the primary job
 of this force as assisting the
 government in its efforts to
 enforce its authority through-
 out the island.
 Selection of a mediator
 to attempt to work out a solu-
 tion to the political problems
 on Cyprus may also be a diffi-
 cult task.   U Thant must select
 this individual   in consultation
 with the four governments con-
 cerned.   The mediator,  in turn,
 will find that the demands of
 the Greek Cypriots for a unitary
 state, under majority rule but
 with guarantees for minorities,
 are in such direct opposition
 to Turkish Cypriot insistence
 on partition or a federal state
 that a compromise will be ex-
 tremely difficult or impossible.
 Aside from these difficul-
 ties, a new crisis could develop
 at the end of the three-month
 period set for the presence of
 UN forces on Cyprus by the Secu-
 rity Council resolution.   The
 Greek Cypriots have already in-
 dicated they will insist on the
 withdrawal of the force after
 that time whether or not a po-
 litical solution has been
 achieved.
 On Cyprus,  the Greek Cyp-
 riots are continuing to improve
 the capabilities of their irregu-
 lar and police forces.

 Opposition to Gabonese
 President Leon Mba has grown
 steadily during a week marked
 by antigovernment demonstra-
 tions and a general strike in
 the capital, Libreville.
 Anti-Mba and anti-French
 sentiment has developed rapidly,
 particularly since French troops
 and Gabonese gendarmes forcibly
 dispersed an orderly youth dem-
 onstration on 1 March.   The
 general strike was called the
 following day, and mobs began
 appearing in the streets of
 Libreville demanding Mba's
 resignation and the withdrawal
 of the French from Gabon.  The
 French troops--about 300 strong
 --have so far been able to con-
 tain the demonstrators, but the
 obviousness of Mba's dependence
 on French support further re-
 duces his longer term prospects.
 Mba reacted to the demon-
 strations by arresting his
 principal political rival, Jean
 Aubame, and another opponent on
 2 March.
 Somalia and Ethiopia are
 both taking pains to o serve the
 cease-fire along their frontier.
 Officials in the Somali capital,
 however, appear nervous over a
 spate of reports, apparently
 exaggerated, of Ethiopian troop
 buildups "all along the border."
 They seem convinced that Ameri-
 can personnel and equipment are
 involved,  and the US Embassy
 feels that they would construe
 the arrival of any further US
 The French, who had appeared
 to be urging Mba to compromise
 with his opponents, now seem will-
 ing to back him in such punitive
 measures.  This turn of events
 makes it difficult for the French
 to maintain their position that
 the coup against Mba was merely a
 military mutiny without popular
 support.   They nonetheless con-
 tinue to play down the signifi-
 cance of the demonstrations and
 the role of French troops.   A        25X1
 Foreign Ministry official has
 claimed that the purpose of con-
 tinued French activity in Gabon is
 to allow Mba to carry out his
 investigation of the coup and to
 hold elections as scheduled in
 April.   Efforts are being made by
 French officials both in Paris
 and in Africa to implicate the
 in the effort to oust Mba.

 believes that Emperor Haile

 EEC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING
 The outcome of last week's
 meeting of the European Eco-
 nomic Community's Council of
 Ministers has underlined once
 more the member states' con-
 tinuing readiness to proceed
 with economic integration,
 despite their persistent dis-
 agreements over the broad lines
 of political unity.
 The Council of Ministers
 adopted in principle a time-
 table for accomplishing the
 merger of the executives of the
 EEC, Euratom, and the Coal-Steel
 Community.  The ministers
 accepted a French proposal call-
 ing for approval and ratifica-
 tion of a new single treaty
 fusing all three organizations
 by 1 January 1967, if a common
 executive is established by
 the target date of 1 January
 1965.
 An important step toward
 further liberalization of intra-
 community commerce was the
 adoption by the council of six
 directives which abolish some
 of the restrictions on the move-
 ment of trade personnel among
 member states.  These rulings,
 which apply to persons engaged
 in commercial activities, com-
 plement regulations adopted
 earlier in February advancing
 the free movement of industrial
 wage earners within the com-
 munity.
 The council also discussed
 the possibility of another
 acceleration in the reduction
 of internal tariffs, which have
 twice already been accelerated
 beyond the original schedule.
 Commissioner Hallstein is urg-
 ing a virtual elimination of
 internal tariffs by January
 1966 and a concurrent final
 institution of the common ex-
 ternal tariff.  As with the
 earlier tariff reductions, a
 commitment now to another ac-
 celerated move would be a po-
 litical act of confidence in
 the Common Market, quite apart
 from its economic effects.
 Statements made by national
 representatives revealed inter-
 est in coming to grips with
 some of the economic and social
 policies which are a necessary
 counterpart to the customs
 union aspect of the EEC.   Such
 issues as economic planning,
 harmonization of fiscal policies,
 and coordinating ways of han-
 dling business cycles are al-
 ready in various stages of study
 within the community, but the
 favorable Council of Ministers'
 discussion suggests that con-
 crete moves toward cooperation
 in these difficult matters may
 be taken soon.
 In his recent talks with
 Italian President Segni, De Gaulle
 favored such moves, along with
 fusion of the European executives,  25X1
 as the means of proceeding from
 economic to political coopera-
 tion.

 ITALY'S ANTI-INFLATION PROGRAM UNDER ATTACK
 The Italian Government is
 expected to get parliamentary ap-
 proval of its new program to cope
 with economic difficulties, de-
 spite the serious disagreements
 within the governing coalition.
 However, if the measures now pro-
 posed prove inadequate, an effort
 to enact a more stringent program
 could bring on a cabinet crisis.
 The objective of the present
 program is to limit consumer de-
 mand, brake the rise in living
 costs, and contain Italy's grave
 balance-of-payments deficit.   In
 addition to restraints on install-
 ment buying, for example, the
 government is proposing selective
 tax hikes designed to discourage
 semiluxury buying and produce ad-
 ditional tax revenue.
 The most controversial meas-
 ure revises taxation of dividend
 income by amending a 1962 law
 which obliged Italian taxpayers
 for the first time to disclose
 their security holdings.   This
 1962 measure was enacted only af-
 ter many years of effort and was
 considered a major accomplishment
 of the Socialist-supported Fan-
 fani government.   The present law
 would exempt shareholders from
 the requirement of disclosing
 these holdings, provided they pay
 a 30-percent withholding tax on
 dividends.   The rate of those who
 do register would be reduced to
 5 percent--from a flat 15 percent
 under the old law.
 The US Embassy comments that
 the proposed legislation repre-
 sents a serious effort to deal
 with current economic problems.
 Moreover, given the strong op-
 position to certain measures by
 some of the forces within the
 coalition, the program probably
 is the best possible compromise
 that could be reached.  Despite
 the Socialist Party's formal
 endorsement, there is some evi-
 dence that the strong disap-
 proval of certain measures--
 particularly the withholding
 tax revision--by some of its
 leaders severely strained the
 coalition.   The Socialists
 acknowledge the need for giv-
 ing priority to restoring eco-
 nomic stability, and have con-
 sequently agreed to postpone
 until 1965 budget allocations
 for structural economic re-
 forms agreed upon in the pro-
 gram establishing the coali-
 tion.   However, many Socialists
 believe the burden of the new
 laws weigh disproportionately
 on lower income groups.
 The Conservative Liberal
 Party and large industrial in-
 terests endorse the changes in
 the withholding tax law, but
 scathingly criticize most other
 measures.   Their current pres-
 sures on Premier Moro are partly
 aimed at discrediting his gov-
 ernment in an effort to bloc en-
 actment of the government's
 basic reform program.
 Probably the most serious
 immediate threat to the govern-
 ment's anti-inflation efforts,
 however, comes from the Commu-
 nist Party, which dominates the
 country's largest labor confed-
 eration.   The party is threat-
 ening further pressure for large-
 scale wage increases, which
 would negate the stabilizing
 effect of the new laws.

 The talks on independ-
 ence for the Maltese Islands
 which resumed in London last
 month were temporarily recessed
 on 28 February in apparent dead-
 lock on constitutional questions.
 As a result London may not be
 able to carry out its intention
 to grant this Mediterranean
 colony its independence by 31
 May.   Moreover,  the internal
 security situation there is
 causing increasing concern.
 The questions at issue
 are whether the constitution
 should provide for a system of
 proportional representation,
 whether a referendum on inde-
 pendence should be held, and
 whether elections should precede
 or follow independence.   The
 basic difficulty,  however,  is
 that the Maltese political
 leaders are in disagreement
 over the future status of the
 Roman Catholic Church on the
 islands.
 Dom Mintoff, leader of
 the opposition Labor Party and
 probably Malta's strongest po-
 litical figure, is inflexibly
 opposed to the political influ-
 ence of the church.   He had de-
 manded that any draft constitu-
 tion contain ironclad guaran-
 tees to prevent church inter-
 vention in elections and to
 restrict church prerogatives--
 for example, by instituting
 civil marriage.   Prior to his
 departure for the London talks,
 Mintoff told a meeting of Mal-
 tese workers that he was pre-
 pared to resort to strikes and
 other forms of civil disobedi-
 ence to reinforce his demands.
 Some senior British mili-
 tary and political officials
 in Malta are inclined to take
 Mintoff's threats seriously,
 and there is increasing pres-
 sure on Colonial Secretary
 Sandys to take another look at
 the entire independence idea.
 The overpopulated islands' eco-
 nomic viability is uncertain,
 and some minor Maltese party
 leaders have been insisting
 that the Maltese do not want
 independence.   Some of Sandys'
 cabinet colleagues reportedly
 have suggested that he defer
 action until after the British
 general elections.
 Nevertheless, Sandys seems
 to feel bound by his commitment
 of last August to proceed with
 independence.   Should Maltese
 leaders continue deadlocked
 when the talks resume later
 this month,  Sandys is likely
 to ask the Maltese to decide
 by referendum whether they ac-
 cept independence with the
 present draft constitution or
 wish to postpone independence
 pending further negotiations.

 PRO-COMMUNIST LATIN AMERICAN YOUTH CONGRESS TO CONVENE
 The second Latin American
 Youth Congress (LAYC) is sched-
 uled to meet in Santiago, Chile,
 from 9 to 13 March.   Cuba and
 the Moscow-directed World Federa-
 tion of Democratic Youth and In-
 ternational Union of students
 are providing organizational
 direction and financial backing.
 The organizers of the conference
 claim it will attract 500 dele-
 gates from Latin American coun-
 tries.
 A special preparatory meet-
 ing was held in Havana in late
 January to complete plans for
 the LAYC.   The basic themes
 "world peace and peaceful
 coexistence," and the role youth
 is to play in the "fight against
 imperialism."  Efforts will be
 made to avoid the question of
 Sino-Soviet polemics,   It seems
 doubtful,  however,  that the con-
 ference's leaders could alto-
 gether muzzle the more militantly
 inclined delegates who may push
 for a pro-Chinese resolution.
 The surfacing of the Sino-Soviet
 dispute would be highly disrup-
 tive and could cause the confer-
 ence to fail completely.
 The Chilean Government has
 adopted a policy of mild harass-
 ment toward the LAYC which could
 handicap it severely.   Chilean
 embassies have apparently been
 instructed not to issue visas
 to prospective LAYC delegates.
 This action cannot legally bar
 delegates from attending the
 conference since visitors to
 Chile can travel on their iden-
 tity cards,but it may be suf-
 ficient to discourage some would-
 be representatives.
 This conference will be
 useful to its Castro-Communist
 organizers if ideological rifts
 can be smoothed over.   It will
 provide a forum for the dis-
 semination of pro-Castro propa-
 ganda throughout Latin America
 Moreover, the LAYC may strengthen
 the determination of those who
 participate to discredit their
 home governments and to promote
 anti-US sentiment.
 OPPORTUNISM AND CORRUPTION IN DOMINICAN GOVERNMENT
 Increasing political op-
 portunism and corruption within
 the Dominican regime are further
 diminishing the already slim
 chances for a prompt return to
 democratic government,   Trium-
 virate President Donald Reid
 Cabral, a political independent,
 is becoming increasingly iso-
 lated in his efforts to curb
 abuse of official privileges
 by several political groups
 seeking to enhance their pros-
 pects for the series of elec-
 tions tentatively scheduled
 to begin this fall.

 Reid is maneuvering.to
 eliminate from the cabinet rep-
 resentatives of the tiny Rev-
 olutionary Vanguard Party  (VRD),
 who have been using their of-
 ficial position to secure gov-
 ernment jobs and political kick-
 backs for the party.   VRD lead-
 ers and at least some leaders
 of the other party in the gov-
 ernment, the National Civic
 Union (UCN), are said to hope
 that the election processes can
 be manipulated to their advan-
 tage, another maneuver which
 Reid opposes.
 Reid's most recent pro-
 posal, a political amnesty for
 some jailed Castro Communists
 and various personalities of the
 Trujillo era, brought a strong
 negative reaction from the other
 triumvirs, who are increasingly
 under the influence of Rafael
 Bonnelly, who was president of
 the former ruling Council of
 State, and of Luis Amiama and
 Antonio Imbert, the two surviv-
 ing assassins of Trujillo. Be-
 sides taking a "hard line"
 against extreme leftists, these
 men want to prevent the return
 to the country of former Presi-
 dent Joaquin Balaguer, who is
 being increasingly mentioned as
 a presidential possibility f

 turn recently aroused consider-
 able tension in Santo Domingo.
 Brig. General Belisario
 Peguero, chief of the oversized
 national police force, also ap-
 pears to be maneuvering to de-
 feat Reid's purposes.   There are
 signs that Imbert and others
 close to Peguero have secured
 "assistance" from police per-
 sonnel in efforts to discredit
 former President Juan Bosch's
 Dominican Revolutionary Party
 (PRD) and to build up Amiama's
 new Liberal Evolutionist Party
 (PLE).   The 1964 budget for the
 ministry which handles police
 expenditures is nearly triple
 that of 1963 and now equals
 that of the army, navy  and air
 force combined.
 These developments will
 hardly encourage the PRD and
 other non-Communist leftists,
 who received two thirds of
 the vote in the 1962 elec-
 tion, to believe that the
 current regime will hold
 fair elections or that the
 armed forces will uphold the
 result regardless of the out-
 come.   The Revolutionary So-
 cial Christian Party  (PRSC) ,
 the only non-Communist party
 with strong affiliates among
 students and labor, has at
 least temporarily come under
 new  "leftist revolutionary"
 leadership, and other nor-
 mally moderate elements may
 become more militant unless
 genuine political freedom is
 in evidence soon.

 VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT-ELECT SET TO LOSE COALITION PARTNER
 Party maneuvering in Vene-
 zuela in advance of the inaugu-
 ration of President-elect Leoni
 on 11 March suggests that his
 chances of securing a stable
 majority in Congress have de-
 creased.   The Christian Demo-
 cractic Party (COPEI), which
 has participated in outgoing
 President Betancourt's coali-
 tion, announced on 29 February
 that it will not join Leoni's
 government.
 COPEI emerged from the De-
 cember 1963 elections as the
 second strongest party in Vene-
 zuela, followed closely by the
 Democratic Republican Union
 (URD).   COPEI's political views
 are closer to those of the Demo-
 cratic Action party (AD) of
 Betancourt and Leoni than to
 any other.   Unless Leoni is
 successful in a further effort
 to reach agreement with COPEI,
 his legislative position will
 be weaker than Betancourt's
 has been, and the stability of
 his government may be adversely
 affected.
 The specific reasons for
 COPEI's break are not entirely
 clear, but its increasing size
 and influence appear to have
 aroused the fears of AD leaders.
 Relations between the two par-
 ties are likely to be strained
 for some time.
 The defection of COPEI
 has impelled Leoni to reach an
 agreement with the URD and the
 independents on the distribu-
 tion of the congressional of-
 fices, and he is presently ne-
 gotiating with them on cabinet
 posts.
 The effect of these devel-
 opments on the attitude of the
 military is not yet clear.
 Armed forces leaders willingly
 backed the AD-COPEI partnership
 but may not be as tolerant of
 whatever arrangement Leoni
 proposes to replace it.
 Meanwhile, the Venezuelan
 Communist Party (PCV) and its
 Castro-directed ally, the FALN,
 have continued their terrorist
 activities, but at a reduced
 pace.  Two serious attacks on
 US-owned oil company property
 occurred during the past two
 weeks.
 The Betancourt government
 appears to be trying to ensure
 an orderly transition to the
 new government by continuing its
 crackdown on terrorists and guer-
 rillas.   On 25 February, the
 government announced the capture
 of three major terrorist  lead-
 ers.   1adiobroadcasts indicate
 that the antiguerrilla campaign
 is continuing in rural areas.

 Parties opposed to the Na-
 tional Front arrangement which
 has been crucial to government
 stability in Colombia since
 1958.may make gains in congres-
 sional and regional elections
 scheduled for 15 March.   It is
 unlikely, however, that the re-
 sults will give these parties
 the capability to disrupt  leg-
 islation or to jeopardize the
 basic settlement between the
 two major groups of Conserva-
 tives and Liberals.
 Under the National Front
 government, all elective and
 appointive seats are shared
 equally between Liberals and
 Conservatives.  Within this
 party   arrangement, however,
 two political subgroupings com-
 pete for the Conservative seats
 and two for Liberal seats.
 The so-called Official Lib-
 erals and Official Conservatives
 are the mainstays of the Na-
 tional Front government.   The
 Official Liberals formed the
 country's largest single politi-
 cal group in the 1962 elections,
 and its leader, Carlos Lleras
 Restrepo, is expected to suc-
 ceed Leon Valencia, the present
 Conservative incumbent, as Colom-
 bia's president in 1966.   It now
 holds 37 of the 49 liberal seats
 in the Senate and 59 of the 92
 in the House of Representatives.
 The rest of the Liberal
 seats are held by the Liberal
 Revolutionary Movement (MRL),
 which has been the main opposi-
 tion group within the congress
 and which has recently split
 into a "soft"- and "hard"-line
 faction.   It is a serious con-
 tender for more Liberal seats
 in the next congress and forms
 a sizable threat to the National
 Front.   In the MRL's ranks are
 many Communist and leftist ex-
 tremists and, indeed, the Com-
 munists and other extreme left-
 ist groups usually vote for candi-
 dates on the MRL ticket.
 On the Conservative side,
 the "Official" group, made up
 of various factions headed by
 ex-presidents and other promi-
 nent Conservatives, now holds
 47 of the Conservative seats
 in the Senate and 86 of those in
 the House.   It faces a serious
 threat to its unity by the emer-
 gence of a radical right wing.
 The rest of the Conserva-
 tive seats are held by ex-dicta-
 tor Rojas Pinilla's National Popu-
 lar Alliance (ANP), which as yet
 forms no sizable threat to the
 government but is not averse to
 cooperating with the MRL in the
 opposition.
 Increasing apathy among
 the voting population, particu-
 larly among the followers of
 the traditional Liberal and
 Conservative parties, is likely
 to benefit the opposition
 parties during the March elec-
 tions.
