 The Russian-led occupation of Czechoslovakia was militarily a smooth
 operation. What remains wholly unclear is what the Russians are going to do
 about establishing a workable political arrangement for ruling Czechoslo-
 vakia. (See immediately following article)
 The reactions of European Communist states and parties to the occupa-
 tion were as expected. The Eastern European participants in the military
 move echoed the Soviet rationale for intervention.
 In Rumania, a joint session of party and government officials and
 representatives of mass organizations issued a communique on 21 August
 which expressed full solidarity with the Czechoslovak people and the Czech-
 oslovak party. Later, party and state chief Nicolae Ceausescu appealed to the
 populace to be calm and firm but vigilant, and ready "at any moment to
 defend our socialist fatherland, Rumania."
 In Yugoslavia, Tito spoke more softly than Ceausescu, probably be-
 cause of concern that unrest might be sparked in Yugoslavia by the Russian
 action. Tito merely expressed " concern" over the violation of Czechoslo-
 vakia's sovereignty.
 The Italian and French Communist parties also lost no time in denounc-
 ing the invasion.

 USSR RESORTS TO INVASION IN CZECHOSLOVAK CRISIS
 Soviet and East European
 forces began moving into Czech-
 oslovakia late on 20 August and
 by early morning on the next day
 had occupied Prague and other
 major cities.   The movement of
 forces was implemented suddenly
 and apparently caught the Czech-
 oslovak leadership off guard.
 A large portion of the 20-
 odd Soviet divisions ringing
 Czechoslovakia apparently have
 moved into the country along
 with East German, Polish, Hun-
 garian, and Bulgarian units.
 There are no indications
 that any Czechoslovak military
 units resisted the intervention.
 Despite the smoothness of
 the military operation, the So-
 viet political actions which pre-
 ceded it suggest that the decision
 to intervene militarily came at
 a fairly late date.  Among these
 were the reported convening of
 the Central Committee when the
 top leaders were on vacation,
 the flimsiness of the legal base
 for Soviet action, and the fail-
 ure to surface quickly an alter-
 native leadership in Prague.   It
 would appear that Soviet inter-
 vention did not flow naturally
 from the Cierna meeting but re-
 presented instead a scrapping of
 the position agreed to there.
 The most likely explanation
 of this reversal appears to be
 that under the impact of internal
 pressures within the leadership
 and importuning from its anxious
 allies in Eastern Europe, the
 fragile balance in the politburo
 was upset in favor of those who
 may all along have wanted the
 toughest kind of policy and who
 ,have made use of the time and
 developments since Cierna to undo
 the agreement.
 Soviet troops quickly rounded
 up the leading liberals in the
 Czecn administration, including
 party chief Dubcek, Prime Minis-
 ter Cernik, National Assembly
 chairman Smrkovsky, and Party
 Secretary Cisar.   At the same
 time the occupation forces per-
 mitted leading Czechoslovak
 political bodies to meet and is-
 sue proclamations and allowed
 the press and radio to operate
 through most of the 21st.
 By evening, however, many of
 the regular radio and television
 stations had ceased transmitting
 and Soviet troops had occupied
 the news agency headquarters.
 Numerous loyalist transmitters,
 nevertheless, continued to broad-
 cast in support of the Dubcek
 regime. As the Soviets arrived
 in other localities, many unit
 commanders agreed with local au-
 thorities to limit their presence

 in the cities and towns in ex-
 change for assurances that the
 local populations would be re-
 strained from provocative activi-
 ties.
 Czech party and government
 authorities ordered that there
 be no military resistance to the
 intervening forces and, later,
 urged the Czech people to avoid
 active resistance.   Sporadic
 resistance, however, was offered
 in a few localities; a total of
 six killed and about 200 wounded
 was reported during the first 24
 hours.  The people also manifested
 their support for Dubcek in a
 series of parades, demonstrations
 and wildcat strikes.   The Czech-
 oslovak military refused to co-
 operate with the occupying forces,
 and Defense Minister Dzur, who
 was later arrested, instructed
 the army to obey only those orders
 issued by President Svoboda.   A
 progovernment radio station sug-
 gested to signal units of the
 army and amateur radio operators
 that they jam the signals of the
 occupying forces.   The National
 Assembly held out the prospect
 of a general strike as a last re-
 sort to counter the intervention.
 The Soviets apparently did
 not have a puppet government
 ready to take power, but by 22
 August it was evident that they
 were working with a group of the
 more conservative members of the
 regime in an effort to establish
 a more malleable government.   On
 the 22nd, Pravda for the first
 time condemned Dubcek by name,
 accusing him of leading a minority
 faction which supported counter-
 revolution and had treacherously
 betrayed Communist ideals.  A
 Moscow radiobroadcast cited ap-
 provingly an anonymous address
 by certain regime members who
 claimed that the intervention
 had safeguarded Czechoslovakia's
 past, present and future.
 Czechoslovak radio stations
 loyal to Dubcek claimed that a
 group of central committee mem-
 bers--including presidium members
 Bilak, Barbirek Svestka and Kolder,
 and secretariat member Indra--had
 met with the Soviets on 21 August
 and planned other meetings.  These
 men are likely candidates to form
 the nucleus of a new regime.
 Radio Prague reported that
 according to "military circles"
 of the Soviet Army, Moscow ap-
 parently hoped to impose a new
 government on Czechoslovakia on
 22 August.   The radio added that
 a list of those legally-elected
 Czechoslovak representatives to
 be arrested has been prepared.
 An earlier broadcast had stated
 that members of the Czechoslovak
 security forces, in cooperation
 with Soviet military police, are
 "taking action" against the lawful
 Czechoslovak representatives.
 This does not, however, appear
 to be true in all cases.
 Czechoslovak party loyalists
 apparently still hoped on 22 August

 would not accept a government and
 party leadership imposed from
 Moscow.   A loyal radio station
 has appealed to delegates to the
 Congress to go to factories in
 the Prague area to prepare for

 told them not to go the Hotel
 Praha or to district party head-

 people and the Czechoslovak Com-

 bluntly stated that "nothing

 described as a "flagrant viola-

 Rumanian party and state chief
 Nicolae Ceausescu made a highly

 the action of the Warsaw Pact
 five.   Ceausescu appealed to the

 YUGOSLAV STUDENTS AND PARTY ON COLLISION COURSE
 Yugoslav students left
 school in June in a triumphant
 mood, after Tito's conciliatory
 address on television, but they
 will return next month disillu-
 sioned by the events of the sum-
 mer.   Protests and disorders may
 recur, unless the regime presents
 a university reform program which
 meets the demands the students
 set forth last June.
 During the summer the regime
 became increasingly critical of
 the student movement and backed
 away from the idea of university
 autonomy and a greater voice for
 the students in university af-
 fairs which it had accepted in
 June.
 During July virtually every
 major party organization in Serbia
 launched attacks on certain in-
 dividuals and party organizations
 at Belgrade University.  A ses-
 sion of the Belgrade city party
 conference developed into a major
 indictment of "liberal elements"
 at the university, and Belgrade's
 party chief made it clear that
 the necessary steps would be taken
 to eliminate these elements.   The
 session dissolved the party or-
 ganizations within the departments
 of philosophy and sociology for
 their antiregime behavior during
 the student riots.
 In Croatia, the faculties of
 philosophy and political science
 at Zagreb University have been
 the subject of a succession of
 stormy party meetings with re-
 criminations and threats of disci-
 plinary action against professors
 and students.  Dissident professors
 within these faculties still have
 significant influence within the
 university's basic party organi-
 zation, however, and Croatian
 party -officials have not been
 able to regain complete control
 over them.   The crusade to expel
 them is likely to become even more
 intense.
 Several liberal publications
 also appear to be in jeopardy.
 A defamatory  campaign against
 Praxis, the controversial philo-
 soop ical journal published in
 Zagreb, and the probable with-
 drawal of its financial subsidy
 are expected to force its closure.
 Selected issues of Belgrade and
 Zagreb universities' student re-
 views have been banned and con-
 tinued pressure to close down the
 publications or shake up their
 editorial staffs will heighten
 student-party tensions.
 Shortly after classes begin
 in September an extraordinary
 conference of Belgrade Univer-
 sity's Student Federation will
 discuss the party guidelines pub-
 lished last June as well as future
 student activities.   These ac-
 tivities may lead to disorder,
 especially if the regime incor-
 porates additional hard-line
 measures into the university re-
 form .

 Increased enemy military activity in South Vietnam this week may
 be the preliminary to large-scale offensive operations in areas of major
 strategic significance.
 The widely scattered rocket and mortar attacks and ground probes
 have had relatively little impact thus far on allied positions, but the
 Communists have not yet committed a significant portion of the attack
 forces they have been readying for action over the past several weeks.
 Communist propagandists so far have treated the new round of
 attacks in a relatively low key and have not publicized them as the
 "third phase" of the general offensive.

 y gives every indication,
 however, of being content to bide his time, waiting until Thieu either
 feels compelled to give him a larger role in the government or makes a
 major blunder which would give the vice president an opening to move
 against him.
 Indications continue to mount that a major new turning point in
 the Chinese Cultural Revolution may have been reached. Peking has
 officially declared that the Red Guards are no longer the "vanguard" of
 the Cultural Revolution. It has delegated new authority to the army to
 impose order on warring factions, and is pushing ahead with the
 formation of provincial governments dominated by the military after
 several months of indecision.
 Laotian Government forces last week recaptured Muong Phalane, an
 important post in southern Laos lost to Pathet Lao and North Vietnam-
 ese forces in June. Close air support apparently inflicted heavy casual-
 ties on the Communists, who left behind large quantities of weapons,
 ammunition, and other equipment.                                   25X1

 VIETNAM
 Communist forces throughout
 South Vietnam continue to com-
 plete preparations for large-
 scale offensive operations in
 areas of major strategic impor-
 tance.  They are also increasing
 pressure on secondary targets
 in several parts of the country.
 The Communists staged sev-
 eral well-coordinated attacks in
 II,   III, and IV Corps this week.
 The capital of Tay Ninh Province
 bore the brunt of the attacks,
 which included extensive mortar
 bombardment and ground assaults
 in many instances.
 The first enemy attacks oc-
 curred northwest of Saigon early
 on 18 August in Tay Ninh Province
 and adjacent Binh Long Province
 against Special Forces camps,
 allied artillery bases, base
 camps, and remote South Vietnamese
 outposts.   In the western high-
 lands, the Dak Seang Special
 Forces camp was hit by a heavy
 mortar barrage and an unsuccess-
 ful ground assault.   Several
 other allied positions in Kontum
 Province were also struck during
 this initial wave of attacks.
 to the delta provinces.   The re-
 cent attacks there were mounted
 mainly by local force and guer-
 rilla units while Viet Cong main
 force units there reportedly were
 maneuvering into attack positions
 near strategic targets.  Most of
 the attacks were of a hit-and-run
 nature.   Unlike the Tet offensive,
 the Viet Cong in the recent at-
 tacks have in some cases with-
 drawn from target areas without
 much of an attempt to hold their
 positions.   One tactical objec-
 tive of the delta attacks may
 have been to keep allied troops
 pinned down in the static defense
 of cities and towns, rather than
 allow them to pursue Viet Cong
 forces and upset enemy logistical
 systems.
 The current posture of Com-
 munist forces in the northern
 provinces is such that large-
 scale offensives there could be-
 gin anytime.   Communist main
 force units have moved into areas
 near vital targets along the coast
 and have completed battle prepara-
 tions just south of the Demili-
 tarized Zone.
 On 19 and 20 August, Commu-
 nist forces maintained pressure
 in Tay Ninh and Binh Long prov-
 inces  by shelling remote posi-
 tions.   Enemy rocket shellings
 of Saigon resumed on 22 August
 after a two-month hiatus.   Other
 military bases in III Corps,  in-
 cluding the Bien Hoa Airfield,
 were also struck by enemy fire
 later in the week.
 By mid-week, the focus of
 enemy offensive activity spread
 Communist propaganda treat-
 ment: of this week's military ac-
 tion, generally has been low key.
 There has been no effort to pub-
 licize the attacks as the "third
 phase" of the general offensive.
 The Viet Cong's Liberation Radio
 on 20 August said that the Tay
 Ninh action "repudiated" US con-
 tentions that there is "a lull in
 the fighting" and that Communist
 forces are not in a position to
 carry out large-scale attacks.

 Political Developments
 in the South
 The Communists this week an-
 nounced a full-fledged formal
 program for their National Alli-
 ance.   The program is little dif-
 ferent from the shorter and more
 general platform announced last
 April when the Alliance was first
 formed.   As outlined in the new
 program, the goals of the Alliance
 differ little from those of the
 Liberation Front, but the Alliance
 advertises itself, rather than the
 Front, as the proper authority to
 negotiate an end to the war with
 the US and to arrange a postwar
 political settlement.   This gen-
 eral downplaying of the importance
 of the Front further confuses the
 issue of which organization the
 Communists intend to use to speak
 for them at the peace table or
 represent them in a postwar gov-
 ernment.   It reveals little of
 Communist intentions and appears
 mainly to be another effort to
 publicize and enhance the status
 of the Alliance.
 The militant Buddhists con-
 cluded a three-day Congress on
 20 August, according to press re-
 ports by demanding that the gov-
 ernment-rescind recognition of
 the charter of the rival moder-
 ate faction, which has in effect
 made it the official Buddhist
 church of South Vietnam.   In ad-
 dition, the militants reportedly
 called for the return of the mod-
 erates' National Shrine to their
 control, the release of Buddhists
 still in custody since the 1966
 "struggle movement," and compen-
 sation by the government for
 damage caused to pagodas during
 the fighting this year.
 The militants suffered a
 series of setbacks beginning in
 the spring of 1966.  The govern-
 ment then put down their struggle
 movement, recognized the moder-
 ates' charter in July 1967, and
 imprisoned Thich Tri Quang for
 four months after the Tet offen-
 sive began.   Since 1966 pressure
 grew among the militants for a
 retreat from the faction's usual
 extremism.   Several leaders of
 the faction even hoped to have
 the militants abandon all politi-
 cal activity and concentrate on
 ecclesiastical matters.  Tri
 Quang's release and return to a
 leadership position, however, may
 have persuaded militants to use
 extreme methods to wrest control
 from the church moderates.
 Meanwhile, the private en-
 mity between Vice President Ky
 and President Thieu apparently
 will continue to be papered over
 by acts of public unity.
 Ky said he recognizes the
 importance of maintaining national
 unity, although he feels that Tfiieu
 is seeking his neutralization not
 his cooperation.   The vice presi-
 dent said, however, he would be
 on his guard not to associate him-
 self with some of the very unpop-
 ular moves which he believed Ttiieu
 is almost sure to make.

 TURMOIL PERSISTS IN PEKING'S MISSILE MINISTRY
 The factional struggles of
 the Cultural Revolution have
 again brought Chou En-lai's per-
 sonal intervention in an attempt
 to restore order in the 7th Min-
 istry of Machine Building, re-
 sponsible for China's strategic
 missile program.
 According to a recent Red
 Guard magazine, Chou received a
 report on 1 June on the ministries
 of machine building which carry
 out military production.   Hearing
 that production was at a "complete
 standstill" in the 7th Ministry,
 Chou conveyed his displeasure to
 one of the factional groups there.
 Chou had received a delega-
 tion from this faction in January,
 along with representatives of
 other defense organizations, and
 had accused groups in the 7th
 Ministry of fighting for a year
 and a half and damaging equipment
 and finished products.   He re-
 emphasized the theme that "taking
 firm hold of revolution and stimu-
 lating production" was vital for
 defense industries and research
 organizations.
 Chou's June remarks indicate
 that his January exhortations had
 little effect.   Since his expres-
 sion of displeasure in June, Pe-
 king has taken some steps to re-
 verse the militant course of the
 Cultural Revolution.   Whether
 these moves have any effect on
 the rivalry in the 7th Ministry
 is not yet apparent, but, through

 at least mid-July, posters attack-
 ing Minister Wang Ping-chang and
 his boss--chairman of the National
 Defense Scientific and Technolog-
 ical Commission Nieh Jung-Chen--
 were still prominent in Peking.
 Both have survived previous at-
 tacks, however, and still appear
 at military conferences.
 Political infighting in the
 ministry began in the fall of 1966
 and by early 1967 management and
 production were severely disrupted.
 Many key administrators have been
 temporarily removed or continu-
 ally harassed.   Even if open com-
 petition is curbed, the effects
 of the two-year struggle for po-
 litical control of the ministry
 will probably persist.
 The impact of two years' dis-
 ruption on China's missile pro-
 grams is difficult to measure.
 These programs are still in a
 Some of the apparent slowdown in
 the missile field probably results
 from technical problems or deci-
 sions unrelated to the political
 struggle, but the Cultural Revo-
 lution is at least partly responsi-
 ble.

 OKINAWAN CONSERVATIVES FACE STIFF TEST FROM LEFTISTS
 The conservative Liberal
 Democratic Party in Okinawa will
 apparently face a stiff contest
 from  the leftist opposition in
 the elections this November for
 chief executive and the legisla-
 ture.
 Last week,  the opposition
 coalition set back the conserva-
 tives by upsetting the Liberal
 Democratic candidate in a mayor-
 alty race in northern Okinawa.
 In this first direct confronta-
 tion between the entrenched con-
 servatives and the coalition's
 newly formed political machine,
 the opposition demonstrated its
 ability to make inroads into the
 conservatives' rural strongholds.
 The leftist victory, however,
 may have a salutary effect on
 the conservatives and inspire
 more determined campaigning for
 the coming elections.
 Even prior to last week's
 mayoralty contest the Liberal Demo-
 crats' electoral position had been
 weakened.   The presence of US
 B-52s in Okinawa since February
 and the alleged radioactive contam-
 ination of Naha harbor by US
 nuclear submarines have hurt the
 Liberal Democrats, who are identi-
 fied with the US administration in
 Okinawa.   Scandals involving gov-
 ernment officials have also become
 political liabilities.   The left
 apparently exploited these issues
 successfully in the recent
 mayoralty election.
 The leftist coalition, however,
 has problems of its own.   There
 are signs of rifts within the
 tripartite coalition, which is
 made up of disparate elements
 ranging from moderate Socialists to
 Communists.   One indication of the
 infighting  within the coalition
 has been the reported wrangling
 among the parties over the nomina-
 tion of common candidates in cer-
 tain electoral districts.   Liberal
 Democratic candidates, however,
 still appear to have only an
 even chance of winning the race
 for chief executive and of main-
 taining their slim ma'orit   in
 the legislature.

 CHINESE CULTURAL REVOLUTION LOSING STEAM
 The trend away from mili-
 tancy is becoming more evident
 in Communist China.   Peking has
 officially declared that the
 era of Red Guard politics is
 over, has delegated new author-
 ity to the army to impose order
 on fighting factionalists, and
 has renewed the formation of
 provincial governments dominated
 by the military after several
 months of indecision.   The es-
 tablishment of "revolutionary
 committees" in Yunnan on 13 Au-
 gust and Fukien on 19 August
 leaves only three areas without
 formal governments:   Kwangsi,
 Sinkiang and Tibet.
 On 15 and 18 August edito-
 rialsin Peking's major newspa-
 pers revealed Mao Tse-tung's
 "latest instruction" declaring
 that the "vanguard" role played
 by Red Guards is ended and that
 they must now subordinate them-
 selves to the working class.
 The editorials criticized univer-
 sity students, saying that some
 "look down upon workers and
 peasants"  and must be disciplined
 for this.   Such statements will
 further strengthen the hand of
 the army-supported "worker-
 peasant teams" which have been
 trying for several weeks to im-
 pose discipline on students in
 China's large universities.
 In the provinces, Peking's
 efforts to form "revolutionary"
 governments are again gathering
 momentum.   Long-awaited "revolu-
 tionary committees" were formed
 in rapid succession for troubled
 Yunnan and Fukien on 13 and 19
 Page  15
 August.   These were the first
 such announcements since the
 formation of the Szechwan govern-
 ment on 31 May.   Peking media
 have underscored the need to com-
 plete this process  "as soon as
 possible" in remaining areas.
 Following the pattern of
 other provincial governing bodies
 formed earlier this year, Yunnan
 and Fukien are dominated by
 senior military officers, some
 of whom have been openly opposed
 by radical Maoist forces in Pe-
 king.   The Yunnan chairman, Tan
 Fu-jen, concurrently named po-
 litical commissar of the Kunming
 Military Region, had been in
 semiretirement in Peking as chief
 of the army supreme court.
 The new Fukien governor,
 Han Hsien-chu, who is also the
 military region commander, has
 been bitterly opposed by radical
 forces.   In both provinces, the
 top deputies are military region
 officers or old-line party or
 security officials.   Representa-
 tives of "revolutionary mass"
 organizations, theoretically a
 major component of Maoist govern-
 ment, are conspicuously absent
 from top positions.
 Developments in Yunnan and
 Fukien may indicate that solu-
 tions are being reached in Kwangsi,
 Tibet,  and Sinkiang.   In Sinkiang,
 at least, the recent reassign-
 ment of the commander of the
 Hunan Military District to a
 leading position in the province
 is, the first sign that the im-
 passe regarding Sinkiang's

 long-time party and military
 chief, Wang En-mao, has been
 broken.   Peking's action in ap-
 parently demoting the controver-
 sial Wang could mark a face-sav-
 ing compromise in the interest of
 reaching a quick decision on
 Sinkiang.   It would not necessarily
 mean a victory for Wang's radical
 opponents, however, since his re-
 placement has an equally strong
 record in Hunan   Province of sup-
 porting "conservative" forces.
 Previous turning points in
 the Cultural Revolution were
 marked by purges of high-level
 officials.   There is no indica-
 tion that political casualties
 have occurred this time although
 a report that the army has in-
 creased patrolling of Peking's
 streets may be a sign of in-
 creased tension within the lead-
 ership.  The last time the army
 was this active in the capital
 was in the period preceding the
 purge of the acting chief of
 staff and the Peking 9arrison
 commander last March.

 The Greek junta, although somewhat shaken by the recent assassination

 special efforts have been made to detain all supporters of Andreas Papan-

 In the Nigerian civil war, elements of federal forces deployed along the

 Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie's continuiing efforts to arrange some agree-

 war's civilian victims.
 The summit meeting in Algiers next month of the Organization for
 African Unity is shaping up to be the most potentially divisive of OAU

 additional military equipment
 over the next year or so to its

 SYRIA IMPOSES TRADE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ARAB NEIGHBORS
 25X1
 The Baathist military regime
 in Damascus, fearful of new coup
 attempts, has entered into dis-
 putes with its Arab neighbors in
 the form of economic warfare.
 Damascus recently imposed
 harsh trade and travel restric-
 tions on Lebanon in an effort to
 force the Lebanese Government to
 curtail the subversive activities
 of Syrian exiles.   Beirut has not
 responded to the Syrians' demands,
 and instead has countered by im-
 posing its own, more limited re-
 strictions against trade with
 Syria.   The Lebanese, however,
 hope to be able to solve the
 problem without resorting  to
 measures which might incite Syria
 to greater countermoves.
 The Syrians are obviously
 becoming frantic over the activi-
 ties of exiled Syrian politicians
 in Beirut and in Baghdad.   Sev-
 eral leading members of the "mod-
 erate" Baathist regime ousted
 in February 1966 have gone to
 Baghdad to confer with the new
 Baathist government there, and
 press reports of mass defections
 in the Syrian officer corps are
 indicative of the basic unrest
 in the country.
 The present lashing out at
 all real or imaginary enemies
 probably reflects the narrowly
 based Syrian regime's concern
 about its own fragility.  No op-
 position group presently seems cap-
 able of overthrowing the govern-
 ment, but personal and factional
 rivalries have long presented the
 opportunity for some new combina-
 tion of forces to undermine the re-
 gime and take over the government.

 TURKISH SERVICE CHIEFS REPLACED
 25X1
 The replacement of the com-
 manders of the Turkish Army, Navy,
 and Air Force, announced for 30
 August, is not likely to provoke
 any open reaction from their sup-
 porters nor does it herald any
 shift in the generally pro-West,
 pro-NATO line followed by the
 Turkish military establishment.
 The departure of two of the
 departing chiefs, General Tansel
 of the air force and Admiral Uran
 of the navy, had been rumored for
 a trio of professionally compe-
 tent and apparently apolitical
 officers clearly acceptable to
 Tural, may usher in an era of
 more harmonious working relation-
 ships between the Turkish General
 Staff and the services.
 Tural's strength, already
 great, is likely to be enhanced
 by the shift, and he may move
 even more aggressively against
 those officers in all services
 whom he suspects of opposing his
 own political views.   The degree
 of his success in any extreme
 antileftist campaign would almost
 certainly benefit the present
 rightist government of Prime Min-
 ister Demirel, which has always
 been nervous about alleged left-
 ist opposition in the officer
 corps.
 Tural's "removal" of the re-
 tiring service chiefs is sure to
 be resented by some of their fol-
 lowers, especially in the air
 force.   Nevertheless, he now has
 the power, as well as the temper-
 ament, to ride roughshod over
 their objections.  Assuming that
 he can count on the cooperation
 of the new service chiefs, and
 helped by the network of inform-
 ants he has  had time to develop,
 Tural should be able to identify
 and neutralize any serious oppo-
 sition to him that develops in
 the military.

 CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE) POWER STRUGGLE CONTINUES
 A coalition of army elements
 and civilian leftist-extremists
 headed by the currently dominant
 military figure  acquired  a
 commanding position during the
 past week.   There are indications,
 however, that the month-old power
 struggle  involving  personal,
 tribal, and ideological rivalries
 is not yet over.
 The recently installed army
 commander, Captain Ngouabi, a
 northerner who presently has
 emerged as the Congo's new strong
 man, has placed his extremist al-
 lies in most of the key positions
 on the directorate of the newly
 formed National Council of the
 Revolution (CNR).  Ngouabi has
 announced that the directorate,
 which he heads, is to exercise
 all political and governmental
 power until the country's insti-
 tutions can be overhauled and new
 elections held.  A "fundamental
 act" approved by the CNR to re-
 place the scrapped constitution
 gives the directorate a veto
 power over any action of the pres-
 ident,   the power to appoint a
 premier, and complete control
 over the cabinet.   The latter is
 now composed mainly of technicians
 and supporters of   President
 Massamba-Debat, a relative moder-
 ate who had reduced the extremists'
 influence in recent months.
 Although Massamba-Debat pres-
 ently appears eclipsed by Ngouabi
 and the extremists, he has sur-
 vived numerous intrigues during
 his five years as president,
 largely because of his ability to
 play regional and tribal groups
 against each other.   He is said
 to be assessing his strength within
 the  divided  armed   forces and
 may yet be able to recoup his
 position.  The president is be-
 lieved to have the support of
 moderate army elements as well
 as important southern tribal
 groups.
 He continues to as-
 sert that he has widespread pub-
 lic support and refuses to bless
 any deviation from his newly pro-
 claimed devotion to an "African
 approach to socialism."  Massamba-:
 Debat has also continued to call
 publicly for a moderation of the
 Congo's foreign policies.

 Preparations for the visit of Pope Paul VI to Colombia from 22 to 24
 August dominated events in the hemisphere this week.
 It is the first time in history that a Pope has visited Latin America, and
 the Colombians are going all out to make it a memorable occasion. The Pope
 is not expected to make any momentous pronouncements during his stay.
 In the Dominican Republic, relations between President Balaguer and
 Juan Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party have eased following a meeting
 between the President and moderate leaders of the country's major opposi-
 tion party. The President's pledge to allow the party's radiobroadcasts to
 resume has contributed to the lessening of frictions.
 Jamaica appears to be less prepared to reach an early decision on
 joining the Organization of American States than appeared to be the case
 some weeks ago. A final decision will probably be delayed at least until
 Prime Minister Shearer sounds out the Canadian position on OAS member-
 ship during his visit to Ottawa next month.
 In Argentina, General Alsogaray is still the commander in chief of the
 army despite widespread rumors that he was retiring.
 Reaction to the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, both official and
 public, was prompt and unanimous in its condemnation of the Soviet Union
 for its actions. In Venezuela, the President's press secretary expressed his
 personal opinion that the Soviet action represents an "invitation to the US
 to move against Cuba." Other Venezuelans, including the minister of inte-
 rior, have also linked the Czech crisis to the Cuban problem. Fidel Castro
 may actuall  be fearful that the US might be considering such a course.

 PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT-ELECT PUSHES ELECTORAL COUNTERFRAUD
 With little over a month re-
 maining before his inauguration on
 1 October, president-elect Arias
 is trying to dictate the winners
 of National Assembly seats and
 thus assure his National Union
 (NU)  coalition at least a two
 thirds majority in the unicameral
 legislature.   Arias is using his
 majority on the Electoral Tribunal
 to annul the elections of govern-
 ment deputies and replace them
 with his own followers prior to
 completion of the final ballot
 count.
 These machinations, which
 have delayed settlement of the
 assembly elections for more than
 three months, are encountering
 sharp opposition from National
 Guard Commandant Vallarino.   The
 guard chief presumably wants to
 retain some support in the legis-
 lature as leverage against any
 arbitrary actions by the new presi-
 dent once he is in office.
 Arias' growing impatience
 with what he considers Vallarino's
 interference in the electoral
 process, however, may worsen rela-
 tions with the National Guard.
 Arias has already told US offi-
 cials that Vallarino has to go and
 that the general's pro forma res-
 ignation will be accepted when it
 is submitted on 1 October.  I
 Vallarino, who appears to
 have the loyalty of his officers,
 does not seem inclined to step
 aside quite so easily, however.
 Although the two men appear to
 be on a collision course, at pres-
 ent they are motivated primarily
 by self-interest and an accommoda-
 tion of some sort cannot be ruled
 out.   If Arias proceeds recklessly,
 however,  an open rupture with the
 guard may be unavoidable.

 ATTEMPTED COUP
 An attempt by dissident mem-
 bers of the military and opposition
 political activists to overthrow
 the Barrientos government has
 failed.   If President Barrientos
 rides out this challenge, however,
 he is likely to be faced with prob-
 lems that could prove to be even
 more dangerous.
 The President announced on 21
 August that several persons had
 been arrested in connection with
 a coup attempt early that morning.
 He said that the attempt had been
 led by the recently dismissed army
 chief of staff, whom he described
 as "ex-General" Marcos Vasquez
 Sempertegui, and that members of
 the opposition political parties
 had been involved.  Although Gen-
 eral Vasquez is not among those
 who have been arrested, he has lit-
 tle chance of success now that he
 has lost momentum and the element
 of surprise.  25X1
 His
 announcement over La Paz radio on
 25X120 August that he was in open re-
 volt against the Barrientos govern-
 ment was apparently intended as a
 belated signal for his followers
 to make their move.  When they tried
 to take a military arsenal, however,
 arrests were made and the main
 thrust of the dissidents was stopped.
 The public call to revolt by
 General Vasquez was answered by
 armed forces commander General
 FAILS IN BOLIVIA
 Ovando, who denounced General Vas
 quez, stated that the army would
 prevent anarchy, and hinted that the
 armed forces would take a more ac-
 tive role in the government.
 The government seems to have
 this threat under control but is
 still faced with a rising tide of
 student violence that has recently,
 received encouragement and support
 from some labor and political groups.
 In a clash with La Paz police on            =25X1
 20 August, students extensively dam-
 aged the Bolivian-American binational
 Adding fuel to the student dis-
 orders and general public unrest has
 been the return to Bolivia of Antonio
 Arguedas, the former minister of
 government, who has admitted giv-
 ing the Guevara diary to the Cubans.
 His anti-American statements and
 charges of US involvement in Bolivian
 affairs have found an attentive ai--
 dience in Bolivia.   It is likely that
 he will furnish the opposition with
 popular nationalistic issues to rally
 sentiment against the government
 when he goes on trial for treason.
 This continuing unrest and the
 prospect of further public disorders
 will probably encourage the army to
 take a stronger role in the govern-
 ment and could lead to circumstanOes
 in which General Ovando would feel
 that he had sufficient support among
 the military and the public to take
 over the government himself, a move
 which many observers have predicted
 would eventually come.

 HAITI EXPLOITING TRIALS FOR PROPAGANDA PURPOSES
 President Duvalier is ex-
 ploiting the trials of persons
 allegedly involved in the inva-
 sion on 20 May for propaganda
 attacks against "enemies"
 abroad, including the US.
 Last week Duvalier commuted
 death sentences imposed on ten
 Haitian defendants to imprison-
 ment for an indefinite period
 on grounds that they were duped
 by "professional instigators
 of international piracy."  During
 the trial, his government had
 attempted to establish a link
 between persons in Haiti and the
 Haitian Coalition,  an exile
 organization based in New York
 and the Bahamas.   Haiti continues
 to charge that the invasion could
 not have been staged without
 US and British complicity.
 The current trial of David
 Knox is also providing a wealth
 of propaganda.   Knox,  a British
 government official in the Bahamas,
 was arrested on 1 June shortly
 after he arrived in Haiti.   He
 is accused of espionage activities
 related to the invasion.   Duvalier
 has long been irritated by the
 failure of foreign governments
 to monitor the activities of
 Haitian exiles.  Although the
 charges against Knox have not
 been substantiated, the Haitian
 Government is attempting to
 portray Haiti as the innocent
 victim of an international racist
 conspiracy.
