				 	i,ngly,   	some  hesiCatingly  and  some  unwillingly.    	With  respecC  Co  Che  "dai-
				 	k~ku"  ties,   	Che  political  circles  would  assume  a  unique  flexibility  with
				 	T~ngka's  participation.    	Perhnps   	they  are  fearful  of  repercussions  when
				 	spealcing  about  "Tanaka,"  his  name  being  deeply  imbedded  in  the  conscious-
				 	ness  of  politicians.    	Mr  Ohira  himself,  a  party  to  the  "daikaku"  team,
				 	had  to  speak  falteringly.
				  	During  the  1  December  1978  press  interview  following  his  formal  selec-			  	~
				  	tlon  as  the  new  Liberal  Democratic  Party   	(LDP)   	president,  Ohira,   	in  a
			   	,     	reply  to  another  quesC3on,   	said:   	"I  feel,   	expect  and  am  confident  that  you
				 	members  of  the  Tanaka  faction,  as  a  respectable  body,  will  r.gke  prudent
		-			  	actions  henceforth.    	This  is  no  change  in  my  personal  relations  with  Mr
     	'			  	Tanaka.    	However,   	I  understand  and  he  too  is  aware  that  I  musC  be  moderate
				  	in  our   	Cies  as  a  public  official."												  	`
				  	Thus,  Ohira  stated  in  somewhat  honorific  terms  his  intent  to  separate  his
				  	public  and  private  lives.    	He  seemed  to  have  deeply  pondered  over  the
				  	matter,  including  the  choice  of  words--whether  to  use  the  word  "prudence,"
				  	"self-restraint"  or  others.    	An  elder  LDP  Dietman,   	upon  hearing  Ohira's
				  	statement,  was  deeply  impressed:												     	-
				  	"Such  an  expression  is  the  best  he  can  do  and  is  as  far  as  he  can  go.    	In		   	_
		-			  	Ohira's  current  position,  he  can  only  assume  a  toCal  partisan  posture."
				  	A  Tale  of  Government  Takeover  After  4  Ye.ars
				  	Just  when  did  such  strange  terms  as  "daikaku,"  "daifuku"(Ohira  and  Fukuda),
				  	"kakufuku"   	(Tanaka  and Fukuda),   	"fukuchu"   	(Fukuda  and  Nakasone)   	and  "san-
				  	puku"   	(Miki  and  Fukuda)   	become  popular  within  political  circles?    	There
				  	was  no  such  term  as  "ikesa  war"  in  the  eras  of  Hayato  Ikeda  and  Eisaku
				   	Sato.    	IC  seems  it  all  started  about  6  years  ago  in  the  wake  of  the
		~			   	"kakufuku  war."																     	=
				   	Moreover,   	in  "sankaku  daifuku"   	(Miki,  Tanaka,  Ohira  and  Fukuda),   	it  was
				   	only  in  Tanaka's  case  that   	the  character  "kaku"  from  his  given  name  was				-
				   	used.    	Perhaps  this  was   	the  secre~  of  the  popularity  of  the  condensed
     	-			   	Eorms.    	"Denfuku"   	(Tanaka  and  Fukuda)   	and  "Ohta"   	(Ohira  and  Tanaka~  may		     	-
				   	not  have  sounded  correct.    	It  can  be  stated,   	though  far-fetched,   	that  some-
				   	thing  fatalist~c  pervades  "kaku,"  alien  to  "sandaifuku"   	(Miki,  Ohira  and
				   	rukuda)   	but  still  essential.    	In  a  political  world  "without  kaku,"  mono-
				   	tony  would  prevail.															     	_
				   	A  government  of  "daikaku"  was  formed  after  a  period  of  4  years.    	When			  	-
				   	Tanaka  forcibly  wrested  power  from  Sato  in  July  1972,  he  envisioned  a
				   	long-term  government  with  Ohira  as  successor.    	However,   	the  government

				    	was  then  a  young  33-year-old  Dietman.												-
				    	Kenji  Manabe  (one-term  member  of   	the  Upper  House;   	aged  43),   	Ohira's  secre-
				    	tary  for  20  years  or  more  unCil  2  years  ago,   	looked  back  on  those  days:
				    	"Mr  Kaku  came  to  Shikoku  to  provide  supporC,  but   	it  was  not  ~usr  an
				    	ordinary  support.    	He  would  cover  every  corner  of  the  elector~l  district
				    	and  deliver  street  speeches.    	He  spent  more  time  in  the  secorid  Kagawa  dis-	    	-
				    	trict  than  in  his  own.    	After  Ohira  was  elected,   	the  two  had  offices
				    	next  door  to  each  other  in  the  old  Dietmen's  Hall.    	I  remem,ber  that  they
				    	always  called  upon  each  other,  as  both  were  then  without  portfolio.			   	-
				     	"Mr  Kaku  would  appear  suddenly  in  my  old  man's  office.    	He  would  talk  con-
     	-					stantly  for  55  minutes  out  of  an  hour,  with  the  old  man,   	a  good  listener,
				    	summing  up  Mr  Kaku's  conversation  during  the  remaining  5  minutes.    	They
				    	discussed  noC  only  politics  but  also  literature  and  many  other  sub3ects.		 	-
				    	They  were  of  congenial  disposition."
				    	Fiowever,   	it  was  not  simply  congenial  disposition  on  the  part  of  Tanaka.
				    	According  to  elder  statesman  Zentaro  Kosaka  (ex-foreign  minister;   	13-term
				    	member  of  the  Lower  House:  aged  66):
				     	"As  Pir  Tanaka  is  a  politician  good  in  reading  the  future,  he  would  draw
				    	up  a  list  of  pramisiceg  individuals  in  each  ministry  as  a  youth  and  extend
				    	his  support  to  them  during  elections.    	Mr  Ohira  probably  was  included
     	_					among  them.    	As  a  newcomer,  Mr  Ohira  was  elated  over  the  support.    	It
				    	seems  that   	their  friendship  grew  from  there  on."

				  	kaku"  was  to  develop  around  Hayato  Ikeda,   	the  direce  discipLe  of  Shigeru
	 	'			 	Yosh3da  and  tutor  to  Ohira.    	Kosaka,  who  wae  foreign  minisCer  in  the
				  	firsC  Ikeda  Cabinet,   	cor_rA.n~.,ed  to  comment:										   	-
				   	"At   	the  time  of  Yoshida's  retiiremenr,  Yr~shida's  13-man  group  met  at  the
				  	home  of  Jo~i  Hayashi  to  discuss   	the  formation  of  the  Liberal.Democratic
				  	Party,   	bue  Mr  Sato,   	~long  wiCh  Mr  Yoshida,   	did  noC  3o3n  the  new,  conserva-
	 	-			 	tive  coalition  party.    	However,   	as  Mr  Tanaka  i~ined  the  party  together
				  	with  Ikeda,  Masutani   	(Hi~e~i)   	and  Hayashi,   	any  distinction  between  Che
				   	Ikeda  and  Sato  factions  was  not  yet  posaible.    	Tanaka  and  Ohira  were
	 	~			 	atill  inconspicuous  in  the  days  of  the  Yoshida  Cabinet.
				   	"With  Sato  and  Tanaka  as  members,  Mr  Ikeda  established  the   	'Heikokai'   	at
				   	the  present  site  of  Ohira's  off ice   	(5th  floor,  Nippon  Shoztwave  Broad-			  	_
	  	~			 	casting  Ha11,   	1-chome,  Akasaka,  Minato-ku,  Tokyo).    	After  SaCo  formed
				   	his   	facCion,   	Ikeda  renamed  it   	'Ko~toikek~i.'�    	In  brief,  Tanaka  initially
				   	teamed  up  with  the  Ik.eda  facCion,  but  later  changed  to  the  Sato  faction.
				   	After  Ikeda  came  to  be  regarded  as  a  prominent  figure,  Tanaka,  havi.ng
				   	aspirations,  apparently  decided  to  get  closer  to  him.
				   	"I  do  not  know  for  sure,  but  it  seems  ~hat  Tanaka  used  Ohira,  who  en3oyed
	 	-			  	the  trusC  of  Sato,   	to  get  to  know  the  latter,   	saying  that  he  (Tanaka)  was
				   	a  relative  of  Ohira's.    	I  recall  Ikeda  as  saying  that   	'Tanaka  was  a  funny		   	`
				   	fellow.																				-
	 	=			  	Tanaka  was  very  shrewd.     	After  a  change  of  government  from  Yoshida  to
	     	.		    	Hatoyamo  and  to  Kishi  and  the  advent  of  a  period  of  confrontation  between
				   	Ikeda  and  Sato,  Tanaka  formed  ties  with  not  one  but  with  both  of  them.
				   	IC  was  Ohira  who  prevented  Tanaka  from  siding  with  the  Ikeda  faction.
				   	Raizo  Matsun~   	(ex-minister  of  agriculture;   	12-Cerm  member  of  the  Lower  House;
				   	aged  61),   	fornxer  Sato  faction  staff  inember,  had  this  to  say:
				   	"Tanaka  and  Ohira  became  very  close  after  Ik~~da,   	following  a  struggle  with
				   	Sato,  was  chosen  as  party  president.    	Both  Tanaka  and Ohira  attempted  to
	 	-			  	support  Ikeda,  but  as  Tanaka  belonged  to  the  Sato  faction,   	the  latter
				   	tried,   	rather,   	to  prevent  the  rivalry  between  Sato  and  Ikeda."
				   	The  Security  Treaty  turbulence  led  to  the  downfall  of  the  Kishi  Cabinet
				   	and   	in  July  1960  an  LDP  convention  was  convened  to  pick  a  successor.
				   	Ohira  was  placed  in  full  charge  to  drum  up  support  for  Ikeda,  but  he  was
				   	still  not  fully  expexienced,  having  only  8  years  of  experience  as  a  Diet
				   	member  under  Ikeda.
				   	"Truthfully  spe~king,   	I  was  bewildered  and  did  not  know  where  to  begin,
				   	as   	it  was  my  first  experience  in  Caking  charge  of  a  presidential  election.

						The  Tanaka  notes  contained  a  paissage  suggesting  a  financi~?11y  influenced
					 	presidential  election,   	causing  ~[keda's  displeasure.    	Twelve  years  later,

					 	support  for  Ikeda  canstituCed  the  initial  aCCempt  of  "daikaku"  to  take  over
					 	the  country .
					 	Two  y ears  hence,  Tanaka  would  mal~:e  his  move  when  Ikeda  came  up  for  re-
	 	-					election.    	Tanaka,  with  experience  as  minister  of  posts  and  telecommunica-	    	_
					 	tions   	in  the  first  Kishi  Cabinet,   	then  held  the  important  position  of  LDP's
					 	Policy  Affairs  Research  Council  cYaairman  at  a  young  age  of  43.    	Tanaka  per-
					 	formed  the  ro~e  of  inediator,  depen~3ing  on  whether  Sato  would  attempt  ro
					 	thwart  Ikeds's  re-elecCion.    	Ultims~tely,  however,  Sato  decided  not  to  run.
					 	According  to  the  book  "The  Life  and  Death  of  Hayato  Ikeda,"  by  Masaya  Ito,
					 	Ikeda's  noted  secretary,   	"Kakuei  Tanaka  argued  with  Shigeru  Hori  from  the
					 	same  Saro  facti.on  who  championed  the  idea  to  fight  it  out.    	t~nd  Tanaka
					 	held   	Sato  by  the  collar,   	trying  to  talk  him  out  of  running.    	What  Tanaka		 	_
					 	had  in  mind  is  unc?.ear,  but  my  feeling  was  that  he  did  the  right  thing
					 	and   	I  secretly  admired  him  for  his   	efforts."
	 	:				 	It   	is  unknown  whether  the  collar  grabbing  episode  actually  occurred,  but
					  	there  ~s  no  question  that  Tanaka  had  been  contributing  funds  to  Sato  from
					 	around  this  time  and  thus  wielded  a  strong  influence.
					  	Nayato  Ikeda's  "Kakuei  Concept"
					  	Not   	so  long  aga,  Tanaka,   	in  an  address  castigating  the  bureaucrats,  com-
					  	mented,   	"Even  Sato  is  really  disgusting.    	Before  coming  into  power,  he
					 	would  listen  quietly,  out  after  assuming  power,  he  would  not  speak  to  you
					  	for  about  half  a  year.    	I  cared  for  him,  nonetheless.    	That  is  why  his
					  	Cabinet  lasted  nearly  8  years."
					  	When  viewed   	in  this  light,   	the  collar  grabbing  incident  may  not  be  an
					  	exaggeration.    	Evidently  for  his  efforts  in  the  re-election,  Tanaka  was
					  	rewarded  with  the  post  of  Minister  of  Finance  in  the  second  Ikeda  Cabinet.

				 	calculation  would  invariably  create  confusion.    	I   	felt  that  Ohira  ignored

				 	to  push.  Tanaka  despite  criticisms  leveled at  him  (Ohira)   	remains  a+mystery.

				 	group  endorsing  ~ukuda.    	A,stand  of  'opposition  to  Ohirg'  at  the  final

				 	~unds  5quandered  During  Presidential  ~lection									  	-
				 	From  around  the  time  of  formation  of  the  Ohira  facCion,  rumors  persisted
				 	on  the  retirement  of  Sato,  whoae  government  had  lasted  too  long.    	"Daikaku"
				 	xctivity  over  his  successor  gradually  grew  intense.    	For  "daikaku,"  this
				 	was  the  first  mnjor  hurdle.
				 	The  impression  gained  by  Shun  Hasegawa  (ex-labor  minister;  eight-term
				 	member  of  the  Lower  House;  aged  66),  member  of  the  former  Ishii  faction
				 	which  had  been  maintaining  some  distance  from  "daikaku,"  was:
				 	"I  am  not  sure  whether  the  purse  is  the  same,  but  the  friendship  between
    	-			   	the  two,   	going  back  to  the  days  o:'  the  Ikeda  Cabiner,  clearly  surfaced
				 	during  [he   	'kakufuku  war,'  becoming  decisive  during  the  Japan-China
				 	iesue."
				 	Thus,   	the  "kakufuku"  struggle  was  in  fact  a  confrontation  between  "daikaku"	     	-
				 	and  "fuku,"  which  recently  flared  up  anew.
				 	The  names  of  four  figures--"~lnkaku  daifuku"--surfaced  at  the  5  July  1972
				 	presidential  election  held  at  Hibiya  Auditorium,  with  "daikaku"  voWing				_

				 	viewe  thnt  "daiknku"  is  linked  finaneiglly.
				 	With  rAspect   	to  the  finHncial  conduit,   	zentero  Kosaka,   	former  chairman  of
				 	LUP'g  ~in~ncigl  Affairs  Committee,   	commented:
				 	"I  think  their  conduits  differ.    	Ohira,   	as  Ikeda's  secret~ry,  used  to
				 	handle  funda,   	later  aesuming  responsibility  for  Ikeda's  financial  conduit.
		-				'fhnC  was  one  reasnn  for  his  dispute  with  Maeo.    	In  any  .event,  Ohira  has
				 	an  orthodox  �action  conduiC  which  he  inheriCed  from  Ikeda;   	in  oCher  words,
				 	l~e  gets  hia  funds  from  the  mainstream  of  financial  circles.    	Tanaka  seems
				 	to  be  collecting  on  a  broader  scale,  but  boCh  appenr  Co  be  collecCing
				 	from  major  businegs  circles..."
					Yet,  some  storiea  carry  a  different  nuance.    	Returning  to  the  comments  of
				 	Shunichi  ~ukuiye:
				 	"Since  the  days  of  the  Ikeda  Cabinet,  only  Tanaka  and  Ohira  had  control
				 	of  Ikeda's  conduit  with  financial  circles.    	In  the  collection  of  funds,			  	_
				 	Tanaka's  method  was  wild  and  involved  vested  interests.    	Ohira,   	on  Che
				 	other  hgnd,   	preserved  Che  conduit  with  financial  circles  to  which  he  had
				 	succeeded.    	These  are  some  of  the  differences,  but  I  feel  only  Tanaka's
				 	wild  and  indiscriminate  meChods  have  risen  to  the  surface  in  Che  Lockheed
				 	incident."
				 	Masayoshi  Ohira's  Bewilderment
				 	Because  of  such  funds,  Tanaka  shortened  the  life  of  his  government  and
				 	greatly  disrupted  the  "daikaku"  strategy.    	Toward  the  end  of  1974  when
				 	Tanaka  retired  from  public  life,   	no  longer  able  to  resist  criticisms  of
					monetary  outlays,  Ohira  made  the  following  c~omment  to  reporters:
				 	"~or  us,   	it  is  a  case  of  money  receiving,  but  for  Tanaka,   	it  is  money
					making.    	Thnt  is  the  point  of  difference.    	Perhaps  I  can  be  said  to  repre-		   	_
				 	sent  n  bit  of  the  establishment."												    	.
				 	It   	is  an  Ohira-style  expression  containing  many  English  words,  but  which
		-			 	discloses  his  true  thoughts.    	He  pointed  to  the  difference  between  a
				 	recipient  who  gets  his   	funds  automatically  via  the  thick  conduit  linked
				 	to  the  financial  mainstream,  with  the  self-procuring  type  who  makes  coun-
				 	terfeit  money  frantically  and  takes  risks.    	What  Ohira  wanted  to  say  was

				  	But  dark  days  were  to  bef~ll  Tanaka  soon  after.    	Vehemently  criticized
				  	for  his  monetary  outlays,   	Tanaka's  Cabinet  fell  after  2  years  and  5
    	_			    	months   	(December  1974).    	Two  years  later,   	he  was   	to  be  arrested  as  a

				  	"daikaku"  a  criminal,   	the  alliance  was  in  a  state  of  virtual  dissolution.

			     	orgnnized  last  year  end,   	expreesed  his  candid  views  as  follows:
			     	"Ohira  seemed  to  have  had  no  part  in  Tanaka's  moneeary  outlays;   	he  ob-
			     	served  rhe  siCuation  carefully.    	It  was  the  sgme  in  tha  Locki~zed  incident.
			     	He  neither  meddled  in  or  instigaeed  it.    	It  is  h~rd  for  Ohira  and  his  fac-
			     	tion  to  act  forcefully  because  many  of  Chem  were  former  government  offi-
			     	cials.    	Evidently,   	the  art  of  self-proCection  which  they  learned  while  in
			     	governmenC   	Cook  precedence.    	In  rhose  days,   	it  was  Rokusuke  Tanaka  who
			     	served  as  a  conduit  linked  Co  T~naka."
			     	Tanaka  (Itokusuke),  now  thaC  Ohira  is  in  power,   	chose  his  words  carefully.
			     	IC  was  c1~ar  Chat  he  was  standing  up  for  Ohira.
			     	"Ohira  was  astounded  at  the  Cime.    	Such  a  problem  occurred  because  Tanaka
			     	tried  to  influence  the  peopl'e  with  money  and  ob~ects.    	In  contrast,  Ohira
			     	was  assured  of  funds  through  connections  established  during  his  days  at
			     	!iitotsubashi  University  and  bequesCs  from  Ikeda.    	At  least,   	Ohira  has  no
			  	.   	vested  interests.    	This  point  differs   	from  Tanaka.
			     	"The  reason  that  Ohira  did  not  say  a  word  during  the  monetary  outlay  isaue		   	-
    	-				was  not  to  cover  up  for  Tanaka.    	Ohira  did  not  Calk  in  keeping  with  his			  	-
			     	duty  to  protect  secrets.    	H~  was  in  no  position  to  say  anyChing  during
			     	the  Lockheed  incident."
			     	Ohira  was  the  finance  miniater  during  both  incidents.    	Watanabe's  view-
			     	poinC  about  the  art  of  self-protection  may  be  close  to  the  truth,  but  it
			     	is  not  that  simple.    	The  reason  that  Ohira  chose  to  remain  silenC  was
			     	because  of  the  dual  aspects  of  fear  and  hope  in  Tanaka's  youth  and  power.
			     	Thus,   	for  Ohira,   	"leaving  Tanaka"  posed  a  risky  ~udgment.
			     	"MoneyaTanaka;  Power=0hira"
			     	In  such  a  manner,   	the  "daikaku"  alliance  continued,  paving  th~  way  for  the
			     	birth  of  the  Ohira  government.    	But  Ohira's  destiny  was  ~o  drag  "Tanaka's
			     	shadow"  with  him.
			     	In  the  midst  of  last  year's  presideatial  election,  Tanaka's  support  organi-		  	-

			    	(1  November  1978  issue)   	carried  a  special  feature  titled,   	"Tanaka  Faction
			     	Moves  Toward  Full  Support--Mr  Ohira  Coming  Up  Fast."    	A  passage  reads:
			     	"Then  Chief  Ca~inet  Secretary  Ohira's  friendship  toward  Mr  Tanaka  did
			     	not  change  even  after  the  latter  left  the  government  and  encountered  hard-		   	_
			     	ships.    	While  many  people  changed  attitudes  abruptly,  Mr  Ohira  continued
			     	to  remain  on  friendly  terms  as  before.    	That  attests  to  the  solidity  of
			     	their  friendship  and  the  deep  loyalty  of  the  chief  secretary."

				   	I~erhaps  th~s  articLe,  most  likely  reviewed  by  Tanaka  prior  to  publica-

				   	However,  Kazuo  5hioya  is   	inclined  Co  believe  thaC  Ohira  was  the  one  who
				   	suffered  as  a  result  of  Tanaka's  influence-buying  practices:
				   	"If  the  rerm  influence-buying  ia  applied  to  both  Ohira  and  Tanaka,   	it
				   	would  be:  money=Tanaka,   	and  power~Ohira.    	A1so,  when  Chiiiking  in  terms			  	-
				   	of  "daikaku"  ties,   	some  questions  come  Co  mind.    	In  other  wcrds,  wiCh
				   	what  sorC  of  power  did  Ohira  condone  Tanaka's  actious?    	When  viewing  past
				   	incidents  in  this  light,   	their  relationship  may  become  samewhat  clearer.
	    	~		     	"For  insCance,  at   	the  Cime  of  the  Kim  Dae  Jung  incident,   	there  was   	talk
				   	o�   	'some  500  million  yen'   	involving  Tanaka.    	Tanaka  at  the  time  was  prim~
				   	minister  and  Ohira  was  foreign  minister.    	If  the  rumors  were  tru~,   	did
				   	Ohira,   	siCting  atop  the  diplomatic  window,   	c:ondone  it  or  was  he  really
				   	un~ware  of  Che  situation?    	This  is  an  interesCing  point.
				    	"Where  there  is  smoke,   	it  usually  is  around  Tanaka,  not  around  Ohira.    	On
				   	a  stage,   	it  is  difficult  to  differenCiate   	'daikaku,'   	the  star  performer,
				    	from  the  black-cloChed  assisCanCs.    	In  my  opinion,  Tanaka  appears  to  be
				   	on  the  losing  end.    	I  Chink  Ohira  is  the  perpetrator  of  the  intellectual
				   	crime."
				    	The  Shioya  theory  strikes  at  the  heart  of   	"daikaku"  relationship,  but  may
				    	not  tell  the  whole  picture.    	There  may  be  some  unique  relationship  of
				    	mutual  aid  wherein  debts  and  credits,   	losses  and  profits  are  considered,
				    	and  "differences  of  position"  are  recognized.    	It  may  be  called  a  division
				    	of  roles.
				    	3.    	Analysis  of  Their  Nature
				    	Finally,  Ohira  ascended  to  the  summit,  but  behind  the  timetable  of   	take-
				    	over  that  Ohira  had  formulated  at  the  time  his  faction  was  organized.    	But
				    	when  viewing  only  the  events  that  transpired  just  before  he  attained  the
	 	-			   	goal,   	it  seems  that  he  took  over  without  much  difficulty.    	In  either
	 	_			   	ca~e,   	the  "kaku"  influence  prevailed.											  	_
				    	The  souring  of  Fukuda's  reelection  plans  and  Ohira's  unexpected  victory
				    	have  been  analyzed  and  discussed  in  detail,  but  thel~y  point  remains  un-
				    	known.    	This  is  because  the  real  nature  of  the  mammoth  group  of  155  mil-
				    	lion  LDP  members  and  friends  is  vague  and  obsc~re.    	What  is  clear,  however,
				    	is  thut  it  was  not  a  victory  by  "dai"  over  "fuku,"  but  through  the  com-
				    	bined  efforts  of  "daikaku."

					facCion,   	cenCered  around  Nishimura  (Eiichi)   	and  Nikaido  (Susuemu),   	thrust
					its  full  support.    	Nishimura  issued  most  of  the  insCrucCions.    	He  would
					ask,   	'How  many  votes  can  your  side  garner?,'   	and  ag~in  toward  the  end,
					"You're  sure  of  x  number  of  votes?'    	We  did  not  hear  from  Tanaka.    	He
					probably  passed  instructions  down  to  Nishimura.
					"The  Tanaka  facCion  felt  that  sho~ld  Ohira  come  in  second  in  the  large			     	_
					voCing  diatricts  of  Tokyo,   	5aitama  and  Hokkaido,   	iC  would  consCitute  an
	 	_		     	upset  victory.    	If  he  did  noe,   	Ohira  would  sCill  come  in  second  by  a  mar-
					gin  of   	from  50  to  100  votes.    	ElecCions  require  legwork  and  sweaC.    	Eu-			   	_
					phoria  over  media  forecasCs  and  neglect  of  election  campaigns  wili  naturally
	 	-		     	end  in  defeat."
					Tanaka  maintained  his  command  posts  at  his  private  residence  at  1-chome,
					Me~irodai,  Bunkyo-ku  and  at  his  office  in  Itopia  Hirakawa-cho  building
					at  2-chome,  tiirakawa-cho,   	Chiyoda-ku.    	He  may  have  lefC  everything  up  Co
					Gotoda,   	but  ie  said  to  have  made  constant  phone  calls   	from  early  mnrning.
					Tanaka  prepared  detailed  notes  similar  to  those  he  gave  Co  Ohira  about  20
					years  ag~	 	support  of  Ikeda.    	They  contained  the  secrets  of  Che  king
	 	'		     	maker.
					He  summoned  the  staff  inembers  of   	~he  Ohira  faction  one  by  one  and  encour-
					aged  them.    	According  to  Rokus~uke  Tanaka:												~
					"This  is  what  he  told  me.     	'In  an  election,   	it  is  to  slash  or  be  slashed.
					The  enemy  and  the  friendly  forces  should  be  differentiated.    	The  Ohira
					faction  seems  to  lack  a  sense  of  seriousness.    	Tell  Zenko  Suzuki  of  this
					right  away.'    	After  I  told  Mr  Suzuki  about  it,   	Suzuki  immediately  went  to				_
					see  Tanaka.    	Mr  Kuniyostii  Saito  also  called  on  Tanaka  on  several  occasiens."
					At  any  rate,   	the  'Panaka  faction  moved  desperately.    	For  the  opposition
		_				camp,   	it  was  strange  and  ominous.
					Four  Similarities																     	-
					The  reaction  of  Fukuda's  faction's  Shunichi  Fukuiye  was:
					"Tanaka  allegedly  intended  to  pursue  the  abdication  line.    	In  other  words,		    	_
					Fukuda  would  run  things  until  the  Tokyo  summit,   	at  which  time  Ohira  would
					take  over.    	At  the  parley  with  Kishi  (Shinsuke),  Tanaka  reportedly  responded,
				 	'I  understand.'    	Fukuda  would  come  in  first  and  Ohira  second,  with  the
					latter  garnering  enough  votes  to  befit  a  succeeding  president.

				   	oE  the  l~rge  number  of  bites,  Tanaka  gained  fu11  confidence."
				   	This  view  did  not  miss  the  mark,   	for  during  the  climax  of   	the  primttry  elec-
				   	tion,   	even  those  within  the  Tanaka  faction,   	such  as  Shin  Kanamaru,~who
				   	opposed  any  "daifuku"  conflict,   	began   	to  harbur  susp3cions  of  Tanaka's
     	_			   	behavior.    	Kanamaru  sounded  a  biCter  note;
				   	"T.andka  has  changed.    	I  don't  know  why.    	He  becomes  wild  and  loses  a  sense

				   	see  someone  appear  who  can  do  ~ust  that..."
				   	Whether  or  not  the  story  of  Basedow's  disease  is   	true,   	it  is  too  si~ple
     	-			    	to  pin  the  birth  of  the  Ohira  Cabinet  on  that  alone.
		-			   	Why  was  Tanaka  so  active?    	Many  stories  say  that  Tanaka  was  motivated  by
     	_			   	his  sense  of  gambling.    	That  may  be  partly  true,  but  he  also  made  deep
				   	financial  considerations.    	The  analysis  by  Kazuo  Shioya  on  the  nature  of
				   	"dnikaku"  furnishes  much  insight.    	In  comparing  "daikaku,"  many  points
				   	have  been  cited,  but  according  to  Shioya,   	the  similarities  are:
     	-			    	a.    	Have  endured  hardships  and  excel  in  grasping  the  mass  psychology.
				   	b.    	Highly  calculative,  without  running  toward  ideology  or  principles.			 	-
				   	c.    	Possess  a  clear  vision.
				   	d.    	Covet  power.
				   	"The  two  are  resolved  not  to  fire  empty  shots.    	Ohira  looks  far  beyond  be-
				   	fore  taking  a  move,  while  Tanaka  fires  round  after  round  like  a  shotgun
				   	without  wasting  a  shot.    	That  is  why   	'daikaku,'  despite  a  varying  view  on
				   	many  issues,   	reach  the  same  opinion  and  conclusion  in  many  cases.
				   	"Ti~ey  both  possess  a  clear  vision.    	Tanaka  is  inclined  to  take  a  risk,  while
				   	Ohira  is  more  cautious.    	In  other  words,  Tanaka  feels   	'there  is  nothing
				   	to  lose  by  taking  a  risk,'  while  Ohira  feels   	'failure  is  natural.'    	They

				 	ba~ed  on  such  qualiCies  to  cope  in  ehe  polirical  world.
				 	If  Tnnaka,  with  his  sense  of  "nothing   	Co  lose  by  taking  a  risk,"  an~

	 	-		     	the  recent    	siCuation,  Fukuda,  with  his  optimistic  outlook,  would  not					-
				 	have  stood  n  chance.    	The  mystery  of  Tanaka's  reckless  moves  would  have
	 	_		     	b een  unraveled.
				 	4.    	Will  Kakuei  Tanaka  Be  Restored  to  Power?
				 	The  final  topic  evolves  around  the  issue  of  Kakuei  Tanaka's  resCoration
				 	to  power.    	In   	Chis   	case,   	iC  may  be  better.  to  separately  consider  Che  ques-		     	:
				 	tion  of  his  poliCical  comeback  and  about  "resCorati.~n  of  power"  blooming
				 	into  a  Tanaka  governmenC.
				 	Some  of  the  things  Tanaka  has  been  saying  to  LDP  members  visiting  his
	 	=		     	Me~irodai  home  have  come  to  be  taken  as  recent  Tanaka  quotations.    	For
				 	example:
				 	"I  wi11  not~become  a  politically-affiliated  businessman.    	I  wish  to  retiurn
				 	to  politics.    	I  will  make  a  frontal  attack  toward  that  end."    	"I  shall
	 	_		     	settle  the  Lockheed  incident  with  my  own  power.    	Two  more  years...I  am			     	`
				 	confident    	Chat  I  will  be  r~cquitted.    	At  the  mosC,   	a  violation  of   	the
				 	Foreign  Exchange  Law."
				 	On  the  longevity  of  the  Ohira  government,  he  said,   	"probably  3  or  4  years."
				 	He  has  become  more  talkative  than  before.    	This  change  was  noted  last  year		     	_
				 	around  the  Cime  the  presidential  election  b ecame  overheated.
	 	_		     	It  is  unclear  whether  he  is  seeking  a  mere  comeback  or  is  aiming  at  a  take-
				 	over,  but   	there  are  strong  indications  that  he  is  giving  serious  thought
				 	to  succeeding   	"dai."    	His  declarations  about  a  frontal  atCack  suggest  this.
				 	Takeo  Kimura,   	an  elder  member  of  the  Tanaka  faction,  was  more  explicit:
				 	"There  being  no  one  to  succeed  Ohira,   	there  can  only  be  restoration  of
				 	power  for  Tanaka.    	Though  Miyazawa,  Nakason~  and  Komoto  have  been  men-
				 	tioned,   	they  are  all  minors  and  lackthe    	qualities  o`  a  prime  minister/
				 	president.    	Tanaka  is  currently  working  for  an  acquittal  in  the  Lockheed
				 	trial,  but  to  a  politician,   	the  outcome  is  unimportant.    	The  essence  is
				 	the  power  relationship.    	It  would  end  with  the  reinstatement  of  Tanaka
				 	into  the  LDP."
				 	The  views  of  Kimura,   	however,   	represent  a  minority  opinion,  with  most
				 	being  skeptical.    	They  are,   	rather,  disinclined  to  assume  any  definite
				 	stand.    	Some  reactions  on  the  possibility  of  a  Tanaka  government  with
					Ohira  government  as  a  springboard  are  described  below.

		_			     	revolves  1round  making  Ohira  a  springboard..."    	(Rokusuke  'fanaka)				 	`
				     	Ttie  phrase,   	"making  a  springboard"  as  used  in  the  queQtioti  seemed  to  bother
				     	everyone.    	I~owever,  how  the  "daikaku"  relationship  wiLl  proceed  hereafter
				     	can  only  be  discussed   	in  rerms  of  Tanaka's    	rei.nstitution,  with  Che  Ohira			-
     	~			     	government  as  springboard.    	And  the  immediate  interest  would  be  how  Ohira
				     	would  reACt.
				     	Or~ly  Isa;}i  Tannka  clearly  expressed  his  v;   	~s  on  Ohira:
				     	"Ohira  will  not  ~ump  at  such  a  story.    	Without  question,   	there  is   	friend-
				     	ship  ~2tween  the  two,   	but  that  and  politics  are  disCinct  matters.    	Ohira			~
				     	is   	tu11y  aware  of  personal  and  pubiic  interests.    	Ohira  does  not  have   	to
				     	take  instructions  from  or  consulC  Tanaka.    	If   	something  did  come  down  f rom
				     	Tanaka,   	Ohira  would  probably  consider  it  but  wi11  make  his  own  judgment.
				     	Ohira  is  the  type  of  person  who  could  do  so  without  worry."
				     	That,   	according  to  Tanaka  (Isa~i),   	is  because  he  is  a  confident,  dauntless
				     	individual.    	At  a  public  event,  Ohira  called   	for  "prudence"  on  the  part  of
				     	Tanaka  and  his  faction.    	But  what  is  the  ob~ect  of  prudence?    	Said  Gotoda:
				     	"It  is  a  fact  that  the  Tanaka  faction  felt  some  displeasure  over  the  naming
				     	of  cabinet  ministers  last  year.    	However,   	the  prevailing  feeling  at  th e
				     	top  is   	that  they  should  sit  back  for  now.    	It   	is  a  wait-and-see  attitude
				     	~ust  now."
				     	It   	is   	true  that  the  Tanaka  faction,  usually  quite  fussy  on  personnel
				    	matters,  has  recently  assumed  a  moderate  stand.    	P~rhaps,   	in  response   	to
				    	Ohira's  de~ires,  Tanaka  is  now  trying    	to  lessen  the  "kakuei"  impact.
				    	tiowever,  should  Ohira  decide  to  "leave  kaku,"  wou13  Tanaka  sit  idly  by?
				    	While  there  have  been  many  arguments  over  "leaving  kaku,"  mo~t  felt  that
				    	Ohira  would  not.    	Only  Watanabe  stated:

				 	Ct~inn  is   	trying  to  ~usCify  the  milit~ry  aasault  by  calling  iC  a"self-
				 	defensive  counterattack."    	BuC  it  is  crygtal  clear  ehgC  China  ieself  is
				 	tl~c  aggregsor  who  ha~  launched  gn  invasion  by  throwing  a  large  number  of

				 	border.    	Ttiis  hag  been  confirmed  by  Che  correspondenC  of  AKAHATA,  nur  party's
				 	official  paper.    	China  is  using  precisely  the  same  aggressive  Caceic  of
				 	refusing  to  hold  a  dialog  and  resorting  to  arms  to  setCle  disputes  as  the		    	_
				 	defunct  Pol  PoC  regime  used  itt  attacking  Vietnam  with  Chinese  support.
				 	~urthermore,   	the  Chinese  argument  abouC  "punishment"---as  our  parCy  previously
				 	firmly  poinCed  out  while  commenting  on  Deng  Xiaoping's  staCement  in  Tol:yo--
     	_			  	is  ~  t~egemonist  utterance  made  on  the  assumption  that  China  is  judge  o~  the

				 	tl~e  sovcreignty  of  various  nations.    	It  reveals   	the  aggressive  and  hegemonist
				 	natur~  ~f.  Cl~inn  which  is  bent  upon  resorting  to  arms  to  subjugate  other
				 	nations.    	Such  an  utterance  clearly  contradicts   	the  pledge,   	in  the  Japan-
				 	Ctiina  peace  and  friendship  treaty,  of  each  country  "not  seeking  hegemony."
				 	Tl~e  latest  Chinese  attack  on  socialisC  Vietnam  not  only  threatens  peace  in
				 	Asia  and  the  world  but  also  undermines  the  prestige  of  socialism.    	In  fact
				 	it  hns  notliing  to  do  with  socialism.    	In  the  name  of  world  peace  and  the
				 	people's  right  to  self-determination,  and  in  the  name  of  the  cause  of
					socialism,  our  party  sternly  condemns  this  act  of  aggression  which  tramples
					upon  all  principles  of  international  law,   	including  the  UN  Charter.

				    	Our  parCy's  principled  stand  dominated  the  Diet  debaCe  on  the  Japan-China
				    	Peace  and  Friendship  Tregty.    	It  is  an  undeniable  fact  that  our  party			 	-

				    	tory  and  ceremonious  manner  and  channeled  it  in  the  direction  of  probing
				    	the  real  issues  in  Sino-Japanese  relations.    	Thus  we  made  the  government

				   	China's  reEusal  to  admit  Japan  Communist  I'arty   	[J~P]   	officials  as  members
				   	oE  municipal  and  other  oCficial  delegations  to  China  constituted  acts  of
				   	interEerence  contradicting  Che  five  principles  of  peace.    	Only  after  we
				   	obtained  ~  government  assurance  Chat  similar  acts  would  not  recur  once  the
				   	Japan-China  Treaty  went  into  effect  did  our  party  conditionally  support
				   	the  treaty.    	When  an  upper  house  delegation  visited  China  some  time  ago,
				   	JCP  Dietman  Hashimoto  was  included  in  the  delegation.    	He  was  the  first
				   	JCP  official  to  visit  China,  and  his  visiC  was  an  ouCcome  of  the  universal			-

				 	The  biggesC  political  problem  the  Carter  adminisrraCion  now  faces   	is  how
				 	to  tame  inflation.    	The  proposed  inflaCion-taming  sCeps  include  posCponement

				 	curb  inflation  this  year  because  nf  Che  presidential  election  coming  up
				 	next  year.    	In  order  to  win  public  support   	for  the  admittistration's  poli-
	 	(				cies,  President  Carter  may  find  it  necessary  to  strongly  urge  Japan  and
				 	West  Germany  to  reduce  their  surpluses  in  trade  with  the  U.S.
				 	In  addition,   	Che  U.S.   	Congreas  is  to  formulate  legislation  in  line  with

			    	United  States  diplomacy  bypassed  Japan  with  the  U5  president's  China  visit
    	_		     	in  1972.    	Seeing  that  the  United  States  r,ould  change   	to  such  a  degr2e,  Japan
			    	began  moving  toward  embracing  the  new  historical   	trend.							    	-
			    	First  of  all,   	an  economic  cooperation  agreement  on  the  yen  and  yuan  was  made
			    	between  the  Bank  of  Japan  and  the  Dank  of  China,   	China's  bank  specializing
			    	in  foreign  exchange,   	in  order  to  mutually  avoid  the  risk  of  an  exchange

			    	ment  currency  for  Japan-China  trade  until   	that  time.    	Afterwards,   	it  was  ex-
     	-		     	panded  to  28  Japanese  banks  (13  city  banks,  3  long-term  credit  banks,  6  reg-
			    	ional   	b~nks   	and  6  trust  banks).													    	-
				,    	On  July  7  of  that  year,   	Kakuei  Tanaka's   	administration  began.    	Prime  Minister
			    	Tanaka  as   	influenced  by  the  advice  "we  must  normalize  formal   	diplomatic  re-
			    	lations  with  the  People's   	Republic  of  China  with  a  formal   	visit  to  Pekina
			    	at  an  early  stage."    	That  advice  resulted  from  a  previous  visit  by  a  party
			    	headed  by  Yoshikatsu  Takeiri   	of  the   	Komei   	Party  and  Ikko  Kasuga  of  the
			    	Democratic  Socialist  Party.
			    	As  soon  as  Tanaka  assumed  palitical   	power,   	he  made  an  announcement,   	implying		  	-
     	'		     	a   	leanin~  toward  positive  attitudes   	toward  China.    	On  China's  side,  Premier

			    	effort  at  normalizing  Jupan-China  diplomatic  relations."    	Along  with  Ohira,

			     	The  pRC's  Premier  Chou  ~n-l~i   	proclaimed  a  new  line  for  building  China's		     	-
			     	economy  in  January   	1975  at  the  Fourth  National   	People's  Congress,  which  had
					finally  op~ned.    	At  its  Core  are  th~se  two  points:    	"Ouring  a   	ten  ye~r  p~riod
   	-			  	beginning  frdm  1975,  we  wi11   	establish  a  national   	economic  system  and  in-

			     	put  Cnina's  people's  economy  in  the  front   	ranks  of  the  world's  economies."
			     	This  new  line   	for  building  the  economy  was  stagnated  temporarily  by  the
			     	pnwer  of  the  so-called  "gang  of  four",  but,   	upon  the  successive  deaths  of

				    	Nay,   	it  is  mnr~  corr~ct  to  say  that  K~wamoto  wrestled  with   	the  crude  oil

				    	of  Prime  Ministers  Miki   	and  ~ukuda,   	there  were  time$  when   	the  job  of  MITI
				   	minister  was  given  to  Tatsun  ?aneka,  who  kept  "the  LnP's   	treasury."    	gut

				   	At  the  same  time  that  being  a"businessman"   	resulted   	in  strengths  for  Kawa-
				   	moto,   	it  also  resulted   	in  shortcomings  for  him.    	He  was  able  to  find  a  posi-
				   	tive  plan  for  coping  with  economic  problems   	that  could  be  clearly  seen  as
				   	imninent  with  much  greater  speed  than  could  a  bureaucrat.    	However,   	he  would	   	-
				   	not  show  any   	interest  in  projecting  a   	vision  of  the  future---a  future  he
				   	would  not  see  with  his  own  eyes.
				   	Perhaps  he  lost  the  desire  to  look  at  the  future  from  past  history  at  the
				   	same  time  that  the  road  for  Kawamoto  to  become  an  historian  suffered  its
		-			   	setback  at  Himeji  High  School.    	When  one  looks  at  Kawamoto  up  to  this   	time,
				   	?~is  historical   	outlook  stops  completely  at  reading  the  present  from  the
				   	past.    	Ne   	is   	not  the  type  of  person  who  attracts  people  with  the  kind  of
				   	statesmanship  that  confronts  the   	future,  as  does  a   	politician.
				   	7he  point  must  be  acknowledged  that  he  differs  greatly  from  Tatsunosuke  Ta-
				   	kazaki,  also  associated  with  the  same  business  world,  who   	likewise  served
				   	as  n?inister  of  MI7I.
				   	Nowever,   	just  as  he  had  studied  the  crude  oil   	problem  as  president  of  Sanko
				   	Steamship  Company,   	Kawamoto  knew  the  existing  economy  and  was   	thrilled  with
				   	assuring  the  security  of  energy  sources   	(concerning  which  P1ITI  officials
     	~			   	cried  out  hysterically  after  the  fourth  Middle  East  war)   	by  spreading  out		  	-
				  	crude  oil   	import  sources.
				   	In   	the  November   	1975  meeting  between  Kawamoto  and  Li   	Hsien-nien,   	China  made

					So~iety  vi~iting  China  under  the  leadership  nf  Inayama  had  explained  Japan's

     	~				At  that  time,
							   	Chin~'s   	ViC~-premier  Ku  Mu  explained  to  th~  Inayama  group  that:
					"Our  country  has  decided  to  advance  a  positive  plan  for  our  econor~y.    	Impnrts
					of  China's   	shortage  commodities  and  the  purchase  of  technology  will   	increas~

					8ut  in  the  China  of  1976,   	Chou  En-1ai   	died.    	In  February,  wa11   	posters  began
					to  appear,   	critic3zing  the  "running  capitalist"   	faction.    	On  April   	1,  Fang
					Yi's  treatise,   	"criticism  of  philosophy  as  the  handmaiden  of  the  west,"
					was  printed  in  1'HE  RED  FLAG,  China's  Communist  Party  organ.    	So,   	it  was  dif-
					ficult  to  predict  what  would  happen  to  Chou's   	line  in  that  time  of  violent
					shocks.
					After  experiencing  another  period  of  violent  disturbances,   	such  as  the  7ien
					An  Men  incident  and  the  purge  of  the  "gang  of  four,"   	the  engines  started  up
					again  for  the  "Chou  line  without  Chou."
					A  delegation  of  the  Federation  of  Economic  Organizations  visited  Peking   	in
					March  1977.    	The  leaders  of  Japan's  financial   	circles  held  talks  with  the
					Minister  of  Foreign  Trade,   	Li  Chiang.    	They  reached  a  fundamental   	mutual			 	_
					agreement  on  exporting  oil   	and  coal   	to  Japan  on  a  long-term  basis.    	This
					materialized  the  following  year  in  the  Japan-China  long-term  trade  agr~ement.
					The  Japan-China  long-term  trade  agreement  was  backed  up  from  the  political
					perspective  as  well  with  the  signing  of  the  Japan-China  peace  and  frienship
					treaty   	(which  had  continued  through  long  and  difficult  negotiations)   	in
		-				Peking  in  August  of  the  following  year.    	Foreign  Minister  Sunao  Sonoda,
		.		     	who  had  gone  to  Peking  and  brought  the  difficult  negotiations   	to  completion,
					made  this  proposal   	to  Chin~:    	"Since  economic  relations  will  welcome  in  a
					new  era,   	I  would  like  to  have  MITI  Minister  Kawamoto  t~  visit  China."
					Kawamoto  made  his   	second  visit  to  China,   	lasting  five  days   	from  September
					11.    	Shiro  Miyamoto,   	director  of  MITI's  new  International   	Trade  Policy

				  	Just  before  his  Chin~  visit,   	Kawamoto  made  a  swing  through  Thailand  and
				  	the  Pi~ilippin~s  on  a  second  visit  within  the  same  year  to  the  m~mber  nations
				 	of  A5~AN   	(Alli~nce  of  Southeast  Asia  Nations).    	Then  he  flew  to  Seoul   	for
				 	a  Japan-South  Korea  conference.     	Immediately  upon   	his   	return  from  South
				  	Korea,   	he  wc~nt  to  Peking---a  hard  schedule!    	However,   	Kawamotn,  who  neither
				 	drinks  nor  smokes,   	did  not  touch  any  liquor  even  at  the  formal   	banquets  and
				 	dinner  parties   	in  Peking.    	Rather,  he  kept  asking  the  Chinese  waiter  for
    	_			   	"cha"   	(green  tea)   	ins~ead  of  liquor.    	With  that,   	he  was  able  to  survive
				 	his  "forced  mar~ch"   	(hard  schedule).
				 	Shiro  Miyamoto,   	director  of  the   	International   	Trade  Policy  Qureau,  who  trav-
				 	eled  along  from  the  ASEAN  nations  to  South  Korea  and  China,   	became  exhausted
				 	and  experienced  some  stomach  trouble.    	As  soon  as   	he  returned  home,   	he  was
				 	in  such  a  condition  that  he  had  to  be  hospitalized.    	Qut  Kawamoto,  who  had
    	_			   	hardened  his  body  while  working  as  a   	lonqshoreman  during  his  younger  days,
				 	was   	in  perfect  health,   	even  after  managing  such  a  difficult  schedule.
				 	Listed  below  is  a  su~narization  of  the  problem  points  which,   	in  Kawamoto's		 	-
				 	opinion,  ought  to  be  examined  in  the  long-term  trade  agreement  made  during
    	_			   	his  second  China   	visit  and   	in  the  financing  of  trade  and  resources  develop-
    	_			   	ment.
				 	There   	is  a  unanimity  of  opinion  with  China  on  this   	point:    	"In  order  to  ex-
				 	tend  the  Japan-China   	long-term  trade  agreement,   	it  will   	be  necessary  to
				 	cram  in  as  m~ach  trade  as  possible  during  the  sixth   	through  eighth  years   	of
				 	the   	1918-1985  authorized  period.    	We  were  able  to  have  a  fundamental   	agree-
				 	ment  on  extendinq  the  long-term  trade  aqreement,   	scheduled  to  end  in   	1985,
				 	until   	1990.   	Given  the  increase  in  the  number  of  people  involved  from  Japan,
				 	the  Japan-China  Economic  Society,  with  the  society's.president  Ir.ayar~a  as
    	-			   	t~ie  key  person,  will   	hold  discussions  ?vith  China  to  decide  on  the  substance
					of  the  extension.    	Because  the  trade  volume  will   	rapidly  increase,   	the  gov-

				  	in   	the  value  of  the  bureaucracy  became  a   	reality.    	Because  of  such  an  en-

				  	from  official   	life  part-way  through  their  terms.    	There  was  a  remarkable

				  	When  the  Japan-China  long-term  trade  agreement  was  singed  in  Peking,  7oshi-
				  	hiko  Yano,  director  of  the  International   	Trade  Policy  Bureau  at  th~t  time,

					and  the  "know-how"  of  economic  and   	industrial   	policies.

			     	of  management  and  planning.    	On  November  1,  Yuan,4/h0  WdS  visiting  with  MITI

			     	It  is  difficult  to  guess  how  much  is   	in  China's  purse,  but  ~dreign  specialists
			    	on  Chin~'s  ~conomy  have  observed  that,   	at  ~he  ~nd  of  1978,   	the  balance  far
     	_		     	short-term  debts  was   	367  million  dollars,   	and  the  balanc~  for  th~  cost  of
			     	importing  industrial   	plants  was   	1.402  billion  dollars   	(that  tot~l   	includ~s
    	_		     	both  principal   	and  in~~r~~t).
			    	Of  this,   	the  limits   	for  payment  and  repayment  came  du~  th~  same  year---for
			     	the  short-t~rm  dpbt,   	33~  million  dollars;   	fnr  the  Cost  of  impnrted  plants,		    	-
			    	422  million  dnllars   	(including  principal   	and   	inter~st).    	It  was  expected  that			-
			     	the  amounC  would  total   	755  million  dollars.     	It  is  tentatively  calculated
			     	that  the   	1979  sWort-term  debt  and  the  total   	required  repayment  amount  on  the
			    	cost  of  imported  plants  will   	be  655  million  dollars,  and  6G8  million  dollars
			     	in   	1980.
			    	Nevertheless,  while  China's  gnverning  body   	is  explaining  to  Japar~  that  China's
			    	foreign  currency  provisions  are  "only  some  20  billion  dollars,"   	they  are  ex-
			    	pecting  to  import  a  huge  volume  of  products,   	including  weapons  from  the  Unit-
			    	ed  States,   	in  addition  to  Japan,  West  Germany,  Great  Britain  and  France.
			    	On  account  of  this  reference  to  foreign  currency,   	they  have  diversed  in  a
     	-		     	subtle  way  from  their  previous  fundamental   	policy  of  "accepting  no  assistance
			    	from  foreign  countries."    	They  are  supposed  to  be  discussing  in  Peking  whe-
			    	ther  it  is  right  or  w rong  to  borrow  resources  development  funds   	for  their
			    	crude  oil   	and  long-term  economic  cooppration   	funds  from  foreign  governments
			    	for  the  construction  of  hydroelectric  power  plants.
			    	After  the  Nua-Teng  regime  came  into  power,   	they  suddenly  advanced  counter-
			    	measures   	for  the  ethnic  Chinese  abroad.    	When  Teng  Hsiao-ping,  who  had  vis-
			    	ited  Japan,   	visited  Thailand  and  Malaysia,   	he  extended  his  ~rip  to  Singa-
			    	pore,  with  which  China  has  no  diplomatic  relations.    	Was  that  trip  made  be-
			    	cause  it  is  necessary   	for  China  to  bring  in  the  dollars  that  had  been  asleep
			    	on  Singapore's  Asia   	Dollar  Market,  due  to  the  sluggish  growth  of  Southeast
			    	Asian  nations.
			    	China's  current  regime,  which  has  staked  its   	reputation  on  the  achievement
			    	of  the  "Chou  line  without  Chou,"  began  working  on  getting  money  from  the
			    	ethnic  Chinese,  who  are  scattered  throughout  the  warld,   	in  order  to  pull   	to-
			    	gether  funds   	for  economic  modernization.
			    	In  connection  with  gathering  togethe~~  this  money,   	it  has  been  indicated  that
     	.		     	"besides   	personal  banking  accounts,   	loans  and  trade  financing,  now,   	invest-
			    	ments   	in  bonds,   	real   	estate  and  securities,   	participation  in  transactions
			    	on  the  gold  market  and  entry  into  consumer  financing  have  been  recognized
			    	by  the  thirteen  PRC  connected  banks  of  Hong  Kong,   	such  as  the  Barik  of  China,
			    	Transportation  Bank,   	Central   	Sout~  Sea  Bank,   	Natior,al   	China  Commercial   	Bank,		  	-

				    	The  FAR  EASTERN  ECONOMIC  REVIEW  offered  the  same   	kind  of  description   	in  an

				    	agencies---all   	received  a  directive  "contribute  to  China  by  increasing  your
				    	profit  margins!"    	It   	is   	generally  observed  that  the  ethnic  Chinese  in  Hong
				    	Kong  are  now  remitting  500-600  million  dollars  annually  to  Peking,
				    	China's  new  regirne  has  begun  aiming  for  a  high-level   	growth,   	clearly  modeled
				    	on  Japan  of  the  1960's,    	With   	that,   	they  seem  to  be  trying  to  equip  their
				    	economy  with  current   	technology,   	developed  in  the   	latter  half  of  the   	1960's,
				    	and  to  build  plants   	that  will   	operate  with  a  great  profit.    	However,   	do				-
				    	MITI  officials,  who  ran  to   	the  PRC  mark~fi,  really  think  they  can  eulogize
				    	the  "new  Japan-China   	era"  without  any  possibility  of  future  friction   	for
				    	Japan,   	once  China  has  made  progress?
				    	Japan---"Mansion  B~iilt  on  Oil"
				    	Trips   	back  and  forth  by  key  figures  and  technocrats   	from  both  countries
	 	-			   	flourished.    	Now,   	ten  months  after  the  signing    	of  the  Japan-China  long-term
				    	trade  agreement,   	the   	eyes  with  which  MITI  officials  see  China  are  hulging
	 	_			  	at  the  complexity  of  the  situation.    	Perhaps   	they  ran  out  of  breat~~  because
				    	they  were  too  enthusiastic  at  first.
				    	Now  MITI  officials  are  eager  to  throw  celd  water  on  the  Japan-China  economic
				    	boom.    	This  attitude  was   	preceded  by  a  mood  symbolized  in  the  spirited  state-
				   	ment  of  Toshinobu  Wa~a,   	former  vice-minister,   	on   	the  day  the  Japan-China
				    	long-term  trade  agreement  was  signed.    	"Japan's   	economy,  which  passed  a
				   	milestone  30  years  after  the  war  and   	100  years  after  Meiji,   	is  now  at  an

				   	Some  MITI   	officials  5tarted  making  these  statements:    	"When  one  looks   	at   	the
				   	political   	changes   	in   	China   	from  the  time  when  Teng  Hsiao-ping  was  again  re-
				   	instated  in  the  summer  of  1977  up  until   	recent  times,   	it  is  felt  that  the
				   	tempo  of  change  has  been   	too  fast.    	Japan  has  to  make  up  its  mind  that  with	     	-
				   	such  a   	situation,   	there  may  be  a   	reaction  against  the  Teng  line,  which  is
				   	the   	'Chou  line  without  Chou'.    	It   	is  dangerous  to  frolic  about  with  the  idea
	 	_			  	there   	is  a  PRC  market  out  there  with  one  billion  people,   	and  that  market   	is			-

				   	c~Eru  Konno,   	present  vice-minister  of  MITi,   	says:    	"If  that   	is   	so,   	Japanese

				    	for  a  political   	price,  Japanese  light   	industries  would  suddenly  have   	to
				   	close  up  shop  and  ?~vduld  have  to  change  their  products  substantially,   	because	   	-
				   	their  products  can  not  cope  with  the  inexpensive  Chinese  ma~e  products."
				   	For  the  nations  of  A~ia,  excluding  Japan,   	the  import  surplus   	fr~om  China,   	in
				   	the  amount  of  $1,701,900,000  dollars   	in   	1976,  and  in  the  amount  of  1,677,900,	  	-
				   	000  in   	1977,  v~ill   	grow  even  more.    	This  will   	precipitate  even  mo re  anti-
     	_			   	Japanese  feelings   	in  Asia.    	"We  have  had  to  suffer  hardships  because  Japan

     	_			   	improved  Japan-China   	relations  as  a  Japan-China  conspiracy,  cannot  help
				   	but  rise,  even   	if  unwillinqly.
				   	Dut,   	it  has  already  been  mentioned  before   	that  the  growth  of  imports   	of  in-
				   	dustrial   	plants  and  the  like  to  China   	is  greater  than  the  growth  of  China's
				   	export  of  oil   	and  the   	like.    	In  addition  to  this,  China  negotiated   	imports
				   	fror,~  Japan  of  plants   	in  excess  of  10  billion   	dollars   	for  19~8  alone,   	the

				   	China  has  payments   	for  deferred  payment   	imports  and  for  past  debts.    	That

			     	Howev~r,   	~~ctual   	Japan-China  trade  has  had  no  su~h   	luck.
			     	During  thE~  period  from  1975  to  1977,  Japan's  export  of  plants  was  stagnated
			     	by  th~  de~~th  of  Pr~mier  Chou  and  party  Chairman  Mao  Tse-tung,  the  Hopei   	pro-
			     	vince  earl:hquake,  and  the  incident  of  the  purge  of  the  "gang  of  four,"    	When
			     	Japan-Chiria  tra~e  statistics   	for   	1977  are  checked,   	there   	is  hardly  any  men-
			     	tion  of  plant  exports  among  the  list  of  machinery  and  other  products.
			     	Accordingly,   	ther~  would  be  no  problem  if  there  were  a  balance   	(substracting
			     	crude  oil   	and  coal)   	between  the  amount  nf  Chinese  exports  to  Japan  and  the
			     	amnunt  of  Japanese  exports   	to  China  in  1977.
			     	However,   	~iapanese  expor~s  of  China  in   	1977  were   	1.938  billion  dollars;
			     	Chines~  e>;ports  to  Japan  were  820  million  dollars,   	after  crude  oil   	and
			     	coal   	are  s.ubstracted  from  the  total   	of  1.547  billion  dollars.    	That  is   	to
			     	say,   	even   	in   	1977,  when  Japan's  export  of  industrial   	plants  almost  stopped,
			     	there  was  an  export  surp'lus   	in  Japan-China  trade  for  Japan,  amounting  to
			     	almost  1.~.20  billion  dollars.
			     	Granted  th~ere  was  a  balance  just   	in  the  long-term  trade,   	in  accordance  with
     	~		     	the  Ja~,an-~China  long-term  trade  agreement,   	linking  Japanzse  export  of  plants
			     	with  ChinE~se  export  of  crudp  oil   	and  coal,  but  if  there  are  transactions   	in
			     	items  othE~r  than  plants,  crude  oil   	and  coal   	at  th~  same  pace  as  in   	1977,
			     	the  Chine~;e  deficit  from  Japanese  trade  will   	grow  fat   	in  the  same  way  a
			     	snowman  t~ikes  shape.
			     	Therefore,.   	if  Japan  tries   	to  balance  Japan-China  trade  even  slightly  whjle
			     	supplying  capital   	goods,   	such  as   	industrial   	plants   	China  wants,   	there  are
			     	only  two  w~ays---either  China  would  not  purchase  anything  from  Japan  but			   	-
			     	industrial   	plants,  or  Japan  would  greatly  increase  the   	import  of  Chinese
			     	products  c~ther  than  crude  oil   	or  coal.
			     	As   	for  pur~chasing  items  other  than  crude  oil   	and  coal   	from  China,  there  are
			     	such  things  as  processed  foods,   	textiles  and  miscellaneous  goods.    	These
			     	products  have  a  general   	similarity  to  the  products  which  both  Japan's  nation-

		-			   	political   	d~monstration  against  its  own  nation~l   	opposition   	factions.
     	_			   	Dealing  With  P~C  Market  Not  ~asy
     	-			    	International   	public  opinion  basically  agrees  with  some  relief  on  export  of
				   	technology  to  China,   	since  the  United  States  has  a  strategy  against  the  USSR.
				   	f3ut  at  most,   	this  talk   	is  within  the   	framework  of    	politico-economic  arith-
				  	metic,   	such  as   	"raising  China's   	l~vel   	to  the  level   	of  autonomous  technology
				   	of  the  U5SR/Eastern   	Europe  bloc  would  provide  a  balance  between  the  USSR
				  	and  the  PRC;   	there  would  not  have  to  be  any  prediction  of  an   	"emergency"
				   	situation  between  the  USSR  and  the  PRC,"  or  "even  though  that  level   	of  tech-
				  	nology   	is  sold  to  China,   	it  would  be  no  loss  to  western  governments,"
				   	If  the  judgment   	is  made  that  there  is   	the  possibility  of  having   	the  effect
				  	of  some  loss   	for  the  west,   	the  United  States  tvould  immediately  ask  for  an
				  	explanation,   	through  diplomatic  channels   	in  Tokyo  and  Washington,  as   	it  did
				  	when   	the  resources  development  export  funds   	from  the  Export-import  Bank
				  	were  ~ffered  to  China.
				  	P~evertheless,   	there  is  much  ultra-modern  technology  that  COCOM  has  prohibited
				  	among  the  technology  that  China  would  buy  from  Japan,   	such  as  Nippon  Steel
				  	Corporation's  automatic  regulators  for  steel   	manufacturing,  which  include
				  	large-scale  electronic  computers,   	and  efficient  high-level   	integrated  cir-
				  	cuit  equipment,   	used  for  manufacturing,   	from  Hitachi,   	Ltd.   	and  others.
				  	Even  though   	it  is  said  that  "with  the  arrival   	of  the  US-China   	rapprochement
				  	era,   	the  United  States   	is   	trying  to  strengthen  China's  power  as  a  strategy
				  	toward  the  USSR,"  the  US  posture  toward  China  is  that   	"even  though  it  will
				  	sell   	various  products,   	it  will   	not  sell   	the  newest  technology,"   	the  same  as
			.		  	its  posture  toward  other  socialist  countries.    	Therefore,  Washington  is   	keep-	  	-
				  	ing  a  sharp  watch  on  the  exports  of  Japan  and  others,   	together  with   	keeping
				  	a  sharp  watch  on  the  export  of  US  made  computers  and  computer  terminal   	equip-

			   	One  of  the  people  in  P1ITI's  ~dministration  expressed  the  opinion  that  "there
			   	seems  to  be  an  overindulgence  in  technology"  on  the  part  of  Peking,  who  is
			   	frantic  about  getting  the  most  modern  technology.    	Perhaps  this  means  that
			   	their  hunt  for  technology  has  gone  too  far.
			   	The  crotvds  of  people  from  Peking  visiting  Japan  continued  unabated.    	From
			   	them,   	MITI  officials  came  to  know  that  China   	is   	planning  to  reverse-export
			   	to  Japan  certain  products  produced  in  the  plants   	introduced  from  Japan,   	in
			   	order  to  alleviate  the  Japan-China  trade  imbalance.
			   	This  point  is   	very  clear---that  China  is   	trying  to  substitute  in  place  of
			   	cash  payments   	for  the  cost  of  foundries  and  color  television  plants  a
    	-		    	production  share  formula   	(PS  formula),  whereby  they  send  back  to  Japan   	iron/
			   	steel   	products,   	color  televisions  and  color  television  parts  produced  in
			   	those  same  plants.
			   	China  came  out  with  this  method  of  in-kind  payment  because,  after  all,   	it
			  	was  difficult  to  get  access  to  foreign  currency.
			  	However,  Japan  cannot  take  back,  with  a  simple  yes,   	the  industrial   	products
			  	made  by  a  country  whose  level   	of  technology  is  such  that  they  have  had  to   	~		    	-
			  	send  a  mission  to  study  quality  control   	technology  in  Japan  because  they
			  	have  so  many  many  problems  with  their  quality.
			  	Certain  products  have  remained  in  Japan  because  of  the  US  export  regulations
			  	on  color  televisions  and  other  products.    	It  is  a  fact  that  with  regards   	to
			  	iron  and  steel   	products,  Japan  has  curtailed  operations  at  its  national
			  	blast  furnances.    	The  sources  of  the  headaches  for  MITI  officials,  who  ran
			  	off  to  China,   	have  continued  to  increase  of  late.
			  	Bleak  Future  for  the  1980's
			  	MITI  officials  think  that  their  economic  relations  with  such  advanced  coun-
			  	tries  as  Europe  and  the  United  States  will   	become  quite  bleak  in  the   	1980's.		   	_
			  	The  Society  for  Research  on   	Internaitonal   	Trade  and   	Industry  Policy  for  the

				  	directors  and  vice-directors  of  both  countries  met  together.    	Urgent  econo-

				  	term  trade  agreement,   	discussed  during  Kawamoto's  China  visit,   	financial

				  	to  China.    	Even  at  this  conference,   	Japan  was   	impressed  with  the  fact  that
				  	Japan-China  trade  is  not  "rosey-red"   	by  any  means.
				  	One  of  MITI's  present  executives,  who  participated   	in  constructing   	the
				  	scenario  for  the  high-level   	growth  of  the   	1960's,   	has   	been  looking  at  giving
				  	up  on   	the  "Chou  line  without  Chou"  from  China,  which  wants  to  haphazardly
				  	imitate  the  Japan  of  the  1960's.    	He  said:    	"I   	can  not  think  that  the  high-
				  	level   	of  growth  of   	'Japan,   	Inc.'   	is  possible  for  them,   	because  China's   	soci-

					such  abrupt  changes  in  Chinese  society.    	With  reference  to  Japan's  economy
					and  industry,   	China   	is  a  partner  who  cannot  deal  with  the  impetuosity  peculiar
					to  the  Japanese.    	To  rush  to  the  Prc  market  and  expect  much  is  difficult.
					Isn't  is  just  the  ministers  of  some  ministries  and  the  economic  news  report-

			   	ment  situation.
			   	The  minigtry's  ann~~l  surv~y  said  business  recovery  was  reflected  in  wages
			   	and  working  houra.
			   	LagC  year's  average  monChly  c~sh  pay  for  a  worker  was  235,375  yen,   	up  7.1
			   	percent  over  the  previous  year,   	the  survey  said.
			    	It  was  a  3.3  percent  increase  in  real  wages  over  the  previous  year  against
			   	only  a  1.1  percent  rise  in  real  wages  in  1977  over  Che  previous  year.
			   	The  rise  in  cash  pay  was  remarkable  in  construction  and  real  estaLe  indus-
			   	tries  apparenCly  because  of  effects  of  the  government's  public  works  pro-
			   	jects.
			   	Actual  working  hours  last  year  totaled  172.5  hours  a  month,  up  0.3  percent
			   	over  the  previous  year,   	the  survey  said.
			   	Above  all,   	overtime  working  hours  increased  by  2.9  percent  last  year  over
			   	the  prevfous  year  and  by  5.4  percent  in  manufacturing  industry,   	the  survey
			   	said.
			   	The  ministry  report  said  last  year's  overtime  working  hours  in  manufacturing		 	_
			   	industry  reached  80  percent  of  thosF  in  1973  before  the  so-called  "oil
			   	shock"  t~gainst  the  ministry's  yardstick  of  business  recovery  at  87  percent
			   	of  the  1973  level.
			   	However,   	the  regular  employment  index  last  year  stood  at  96.7  against  the
			   	Uase  of  100  in  1975,  down  1.2  points  from  the  previous  year.
			   	The  minisCry  attributed  the  stagnant  employment  situation  to  the  policy
			   	of  having  employees  work  overtime  to  cope  with  increased  work  rather  than
			   	employing  new  recruits.

				  	The  government  is  paying  considerable  aCtention  to  Saudi  Arabia,   	the
				  	world's   	largest  oil  exporting  country.    	Saudi  Arabia  increased  oil  output		     	-

				  	usual  output  of  8,500,000  barrels.    	However,   	it  has  imposed  a  new  ceiling
				  	of  9,500,000  barrels  a   	d ay,  according  to  recent  reports  confirmed  by  the

				  	The  government  hns  so  far  failed  to  take  drastic  measures   	to  save  oil,
				  	parCly  because  it  war.ted  to  avoid  disturbances  like  those  seen  in  the  1973
				  	oil  crisis.    	The  sources  said  the  government  plans  to  accurately  assess  the
