SMEARY 
A determined effort was apparent to stress gains from the anticorruption drive 
minimize the lo-see, hut evidences of dislocations in the economy still existed, --
State trading companies went out of their way to place ordere, with private firms 
revive busineas," workers were urged to.put increased production above tiger-hunting, 
and inefficiency of newly promoted workers was admitted. An engineer trained in 
America, depending on textbook theories and overlooking facts,, was pictured as the 
symbol of reaction, while an old worker was the progressive element, insisting that 
superior Soviet methods he adopted. All industrial gains were represented as 
synonomous with workers 2 direction of business, and aeceptaaee of this by the owners. 
One revealing broadeast told of a worker-manager agreement allowing factory operatiras 
to resume, with the workers promising to get to work on time, stay on the job, and ' 
not "hang around the front office talking and reading newspapers," which might give 
an accurate picture of conditions that have existed in many business houses. 
Boasts of reduced costs and lower prices mentioned a cut of 11 percent in flour 
prices and of 21 in Szechwan charcoal. The Shangh i market quotations showed no 
such reductions, while Chungking quoted actual rises in flour, rice, yellow beans, 
millet, and eggs, with pork and wheat reduced and charcoal unehanged. Lower wheat 
and higher flour prices indicate that the farmer rather than the consumer might be 
feeling the effects of lower prices. Northeast officials demanded improvement in 
transport, though a Peking broadcast credited Soviet technicians on the Chinese-
Changchun Railway with building a model for all China in transport operations; 
fishermen had to be supplied with food and funds before they could proceed with 
operations; State trading companies were asked to reduce prices for famine 
, sufferers; and warehouse losses through defective management were reported.

Kiangsi complaints said cadres gave too much attention to spring farming, allowing 
landlords to cause trouble, while from Yunnan cadres were criticized for placing 
land reform ahead of spring farming ignoring shortages of food, seed, and tools. 
The confused farmers, condemned by cadres for indifference toward land reform, 
were represented as becoming even less enthusiastic. Sian complained that in the 
old revolutionary bases the antidrought fight had lagged because of poor leadership, 
while East China reported considerable concern over the combined menace of drought 
and insects.

ately and handed over 100 ounces of gold. Wuhan added (Apr. 26) that the exposure 
of corrupt merchants by the Chinese Volunteers and Korean soldiers during their 
promotion of the anticorruption drive in Central and South China led one clerk to 
accuse a merchant of embezzling 400 million yuan; that their visit to the Pinghsiang 
Colliery resulted in new production records; and that their presence in Huangpei 
caused power plant workers to adopt progressive Soviet techniques. 
Kunming announced (Apr. 23) that the second training course for 280 shop employees, 
including !senior clerks and accountants, had been completed with organization of new 
tiger-hunting teams to take part in the five-anti's drive. The clerks, as a result

between clerks and employers, and agreed to "push the anticorruption drive to a 
victorious finish." Kunming said (Apr. 25) that workers in the Minchung Ironworks 
and the Hungfu Cigarette Factory enthusiastically welcomed the Kunming Austerity

rally, when Chiang Chin-shan and Chao Chi-ko confessed and were pardoned, while Chao

Merchant Fen Tzu-tan had been arrested Apr. 11 on charges of making 5 billion yuan in 
illegal profits and defrauding the People's Liberation Army on processing contracts. 
Peking in numeral code (Apr. 21) transmitted an article by Chang Chia-chi, "Shanghai 
Speculators Who Fear that the World Will Not Be in Confusion." Shanghai was described 
as the former bastion of bureaucratic capitalists and imperialists, where a speculator 
with nothing bat a telephone line could "snatch millions of jen min piao in one 
night," and where, even after the Liberation 220,000, persons relied on speculation 
for a living. These speculators utilized every wild rumor to cause gyrations in the 
market, manipulating a jump in rice prices in 1950 because floods disrupted transporta-
tion on the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway, and spreading rumors of a third World War in 
October 1950 to cause anthracite coal prices to jump from 410,000 to 800,000 yuan a 
ton. Part of the time people could not even buy coal. State trading companies, 
welcomed by the masses because they stabilize prices, have been "bitterly opposed" 
by the Shanghai speculators, who infiltrated these companies to undermine thenl, at 
the same time crying that they had destroyed their freedom of business, Nine State-
awned eowpanies discovered that their main business departments had been usurped or 
undermined by Shanghai speculators. 
When American imperialists declared a blockade of the China coast in 1950 the speculators 
raised prices on hardware and drugs, and when American-Chiang planes bombed Shanghai 
they hoarded kerosene, candles, lamps, and even sand, so that adequate protection 
against enemy aircraft could not be provided. 
In the Shanghai Coal Company and Shanghai Mining Equipment Company 51 cadres were 
found to be agents of Lita, Chenye, and other private coal dealers. The live hog 
section of the East China office of the China Native Products Company was found to 
have been completely usurped by Chientahsin, Chengta, and Yangshunho hog firms, who 
set up six buying stations close to the State company's one in northern Kiangsu, 
making it impossible for the State company to buy hogs. Then pork prices were 
raised to 16,000 yuan a catty, while the State price was only 7,800 yuan. These 
speculators have received hard blows in the past 2 years, but the speculative 
nature of the capitalist class of Shanghai is very stubborn," Among the criminal 
merchants were Tsou Shao-lin of the Hsintai Yarn Company;, Cheng Shun-kang and Chi 
Mei-chuan of the Shanghai Food Guild; Weng Min-ju of the Shanghai Hardware Guild; 
and Hsia Ying-kuei of the Tachunghua Electric Appliance Company, the "tungsten wire 
king," arrested recently for hoarding 3 million meters of tungsten wire with no 
book accounts. Much of the speculative capital had gone underground, as was

demonstrated when a checkup showed the Yungcheng Hardware Shop, a small store, had 
3 billion yuan worth of supplies hidden in a secret warehouse. 
Rules for Emighatnl. Peking reported in numeral code (Apr. 21) that the Central 
Government Administrative Council had approved the following schedule of punishment 
for corruption g Corruption of 100 million yuan or more, 10 years or more in 
prison, death if the crime was of a serious nature; 50-100 million yuan, prison term 
of 5-10 years; 10-50 million yuan, prison term of 1-4 years, penal servitude 1-4 
years, or surveillance of 1-2 years; and under 10 million yuan, penal servitude or 
surveillance of one year, administrative punishment, or warning. Money and articles 
obtained illegally should be reclaimed, and a person's property should be subject to 
confiscation in whole or in part if the crime was of a serious nature. Heavier 
punishment might be imposed in special cases, such as the stealing of economic 
intelligence, group corruption, incomplete confession, or attempt to hide evidence by 
destruction of Government property. Lighter punishment might be assessed if there 
was complete confession, sepentance, return of funds, and "achievement of merit 
through accusation." Confiscation of property, in whole or in part, was approved when 
bribery of Government officials was involved. Payment of commissions in business 
deals because of "bad social custom" should not be considered as bribery if the act 
was committed in the past, but in the future should be considered as bribery. 
Anshan (Apr. 24) asserted that workers had expressed their "enthusiastic support" of 
the Central Government regulations, and cited them as another example "of the 
brilliant leadership of the Communist Party." Some quotes from the regulations 
Callon 
Chairman Mao has said in the past g "Be lenient toward the 
past, but severe toward the future; be predominantly lenient 
and seldom severe; grant leniency to confessors, but treat 
nonconfessors with severity; be lenient with non-Government 
officials except in cases of flagrant violation, but severe 
with Government officials." These are the summations made by 
Chairman Mao from a study of collected cases of the Three-
antius and Five-antivs drive Therefore this directive can-
not but contain n great deal of leeway. This leeway means that 
the small group of flagrant violators, obstructionists, and those 
"refusing to recant unto death," or those guilty of corruption 
or theft during or after the three-antigs or five-anti's drive, 
must be handled with severity, or even extreme severity .... In 
minor cases of bribery there should be no fines or prison sentences; 
a warning is enough. But after this violators will be severely 
punished .... Our principle is to overlook the past and punish 
future violations with severity. (Peking, numeral code, Apr. 21) 
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY 
Lains frmAILLgormin112112stm: Shanghai asserted (Apr. 21) that the economy of 
Shantung Province had been greatly strengthened by the anticorruption drive. Bank 
deposits in January showed an increase of 2,28 percent, in February 6.85 percent, 
and in March 36.25 percent. In 10 Tsingtao companies retail sales increased 52 
percent in March over February. Huainan claimed (Apr. 27) that as a result of the 
anticorruption drive workers in the Hu inan mines increased their political con-
sciousness to the extent of accepting the idea of division of labor, with a marked 
increase in production. 
Peking stated in numeral code (Apr. 24) that in the Yaohua Glass Works of Chinhuangtao, 
Hopei, the making of glass from mountain sand rather than sea sand increased produc-
tion to an index of 157 for 1949, taking 1948 as 100. However, with the elimination 
of graft and bureaucracy through the anticorruption drive, the index now stood at 
297. Chief Engineer Wang En-ming of the melting and refining section, who was 
trained in Arkerica, and engineer Wang Hsing-i, refused to listen to old worker Chou

Chen-ming when he advised calling in Soviet experts. This attitude was corrected 
by the drive, Soviet technicians were asked to help solve production difficulties, 
and plant engineers now work closely with the workers rather than depending upon 
theories from books. Peking claimed in numeral code (Apr. 25) that the increased 
political consciousness of workers on the Chengtu-Chungking Railway construction 
project during the anticorruption drive led to the replacement of outmoded bridge 
construction techniques with progressive Soviet methods at a saving of 7,600 yan per 
cubic meter under the old figure of 33,600. Adoption of the Soviet Kovalev technique 
increased production of nuts from 240 per hour to 670, and instead of wasting 
material the workers now collect and reclaim waste during their spare time. 
Engineers no longer depend upon textbook theories, but consult the workers, who 
already have helped them repair a collapsed roadbed and enlarge a wharf. 
Peking asserted in numeral code (Apr, 23) that workers in Wuhan ironworks have 
participated in implementation of Government contracts since the anticorruption drive, 
with the result that the Government has saved 13.3 percent, and not one of the 100,000 
items made for the Chinchiang flood control project was below standard. Workers now 
go to work early and stay late, so that between Mar. 10 - Apr. 20 the 800 ironworks 
of Wuhan produced 105,234 units of tools and parts of standard quality. "During the 
3 years since the Liberation this is the first time such an achievement was reported." 
When the Jih Shun Chi Ironworks made 30 substandard hoes the case immediately was 
reported by a worker, and the Ho Sheng Chang team helped employers buy angle iron 
for 4,000 yuan a catty instead of the contract price of 12,000, permitting a revision 
of the contract that saved the Government 65 million yuan. 
Peking claimed in numeral code (Apr. 24) that the Sian Federation of Labor discovered 
through the anticorruption drive that cadres in the law-level unions were weak in 
their class ideology, corrupt, or agents of capitalists. Most cadres in the workers 
union of the Chienhua Transportation Company were agents of capitalists, and in the 
Teheng Canvas Factory the head of the factory union and other cadres became capitalist 
agents when Manager Liu Kuei-yuan promoted them to administrative positions. With 
the success of the anticorruption drive these elements were purged and the unions 
reorganized with an increase in membership. Peking stated in numeral code (Apr. 27) 
that the same capitalist dominance had been discovered among low-level unions in 
Shanghai private industries, especially in the Hua Hain Educational Supply Company, 
the Nanyang Electric Cord Factory, the Hua Fu Fu Dyeing and Weaving Company, and the 
Cheng Chung Rubberworks. In a certain rubber factory on North Szechuan Road the 
union deputy head, Huang Wen-yuan, a capitalist agent, used his position to prepare 
a list of progressive elements in the union for dismissal, and "helped the manage-
ment in buying over senior workers." As a result of the anticorruption drive 
Huang was dismissed and the union reorganized. 
Other claims that the anticorruption drive increased production and improved working 
conditions through increasing the political consciousness of the workers, eliminating 
corrupt cadres, and promoting "progressive elements" were monitored from Anshan 
(Apr, 24), Chinchow (Apr. 21, 23), Dairen (Apr. 22), Tsinan (Apr. 21), Shanghai 
(Apr, 21, 23), Hangchow (Apr. 26), Wuhsi (Apr. 22), Hofei (Apr. 24), Wuhan (Apr. 22, 
23), and Chungking (Apr. 25). 
Prableingsg.nfi. Anshan reported (Apr. 24) that the local Austerity 
Committee had met with workers to urge that they cooperate with manufacturers to 
increase production and cut costs in fulfillment of processing contracts by private 
businessmen. Chinchow said (Apr. 23) that the Chinchow Austerity Committee had 
urged workers to pay attention both to tiger-hunting and production. Tsinan stated 
(Apr. 27) that 45 cadres in the Tsinan Industrial Company had been promoted, while 
"progressive elements" of the anticorruption drive had been promoted to responsible 
positions in Tsingtao State trading enterprises. 
Hangchow announced (Apr. 26) that the Chekiang Government had organized a committee 
of 11 persons with Shi Chi-yuan as chairman to supervise all Government orders with 
private firms, fixing wages, prices, and processing contract terms, and that 
contracts already had been let with silk, colth, daily necessity and food manufacturers.

? Yangchow reported (Apr. 21) that the Yangchow branch of the North Kiangsu General 
Merchandise Company had called a meeting to discuss normal business operations and 
instructed cadres to carry on normal buying and selling during the anticorruption 
drive. Nantung stated (Apr. 24) that cooperatives recently placed large orders for 
goods and banks increased their production loans "to strengthen the people's economy 
and revive industry," and that State trading companies had lowered retail prices 
and increased the number of processing orders with private businessmen. 
Hofei announced (Apr. 24) that clerks in local native herbs shops had called a meeting 
to promote the anticorruption drive and "revive production." Clerks agreed to make 
investigations of shops to eliminate fake drugs, while worker-employer consultative 
conferences would be organized to "find ways of conducting normal business operations 
Wei said (Apr. 27) that after the owner of the Chingpu Drug Company had been induced 
by his clerks to confess his tax evasions and make restitution he received lenient 
treatment, and in appreciation added 41 million yuan to his wcrking capital and 
produced 22 million yuan worth of hidden goods "to reopen his business." Huainan 
admitted (Apr. 27) that in the Chiulung Colliery many workers holding technical 
positions were found deficient in their knowledge of the work required, and failed 
to produce the desired results. "In some cases workers using new techniques did 
not equal the production records of the regular old-time workers." 
Wuhan announced (Apr. 26) that workers and managers in 10 private firma which had 
been given Government processing contracts were holding meetings "to resume normal 
business operations." Under this arrangement the Chienkang Factory had taken a new 
lease on life with an increase in capital investment, and the Chungho Factory had 
proposed changes which would reduce the cost to the Government. Sian reported 
(Apr. 23) that local shop clerks held a rally Apr. 19 when Party Secretary Ma Han-san 
advised them "to return to their places and engage in production," as this was the 
best way to gain from the anticorruption drive. 
Peking stated in numeral code (Apr. 25) that workers in the privately-owned Hsinglung 
Ironworks persuaded its owners to confess their corruption and gain leniency, through 
worker-manager consultations "were able to overcome the defeatist attitude of the 
management toward production," and urged that capital investment be increased "so 
?that,vrkers would not stand around idle." Workers agreed to arrive and leave at 
designated hours; not to be absent without cause or leave their jobs daring working 
hos; to inform the management on personal circumstances; and not to hang around the 
front office and talk or read newspapers without good reason for doing so. As a 
result of these agreements the factory fulfilled a contract with the Mukden office 
of the China Equipment Company at a reduction of 18 percent in cost and with no 
defects among the 30 items processed. 
Reduced Costs and Prices. Shanghai asserted

Tsinan stated (Apr. 27) that as a result of the anticorruption drive the Shantung 
Department of Commerce had ordered a reduction in flour prices averaging 10.16 
percent, and had cut Pa-i brand flour from 14,000 to 11,000 yuan a bag in Tainan, and 
from 18,500 to 15,500 yuan in Tsingtao. Wuhan announced (Apr. 26) that all depart-
ment stores in Wuhan had offered a 5 percent discount on sales for 4 days starting 
Apr. 27. Chungking stated (Apr. 23) that in eastern Szechwan the drive had brought 
charcoal prices down 21 percent, leading to a drop in other prices. Chungking said 
(Apr. 24) that the China Medicine Company, Southwest branch, had cut prices on 230

ment Administrative Council Apr. 19 that the "impact of the three-anti's and five-
anti's drives on the Nation will have a lasting affect," and stated that not only 
had the Nation's price structure been stabilized, but it also had started a downward 
trend. Peking stated (Apr. 23) that all China General Merchandise stores had been

, on National defense and industrial projects in 1952, with 20,000 laborers to be 
enlisted by the Northeast Government and 120,000 by local construction offices. 
Peking in numeral code (Apr. 25) quoted Kao Kang as telling the Northeast Conference 
the 140,000 laborers would be divided into three groups, to work on National defense 
and heavy industry projects; on light industry projects; and on all other types of 
projects. He called upon workers and administrators to make the work "fast, good, 
and cheap," to eliminate graft and shoddy work, and to cut costs on all projects 
10-15 percent. He also urged careful planning an all projects and attacked the

Shanghai announced (Apr. 23) that Mao Shang-chi and Mao Hsi-seng of Kuanglu Hsiang, 
Paoan Chu, Hsiaoshan Hsien, Chekiang, were arrested for setting mountain fires 
Apr, 17 which burned over 10 IODU of timberland, destroying 23,000 trees worth 300 
million yuan. Shanghai reported (Apr, 27) that\1,000 fishing boats left Shenchiamen 
to bring in the annual catch after economic organizations had helped the fishermen 
tide over their difficulties by advancing 30,000 catties of rice, salt, and money. 
Yangchow revealed (Apr. 23) that in the Nantung Textile Factory a shortage of 
materials had held up production, so substitutes were used in the making of canvas 
belts. 
Peking said in numeral code (Apr. 23) that the bureaucratic attitude of warehouse 
cadres caused considerable loss last year, so steps had been taken this year by the 
Chungking branches of the China Grain Company and the China General Merchandise 
Company to clean the warehouses of weevils, air the grain, and organize special sales 
forces to move perishable goods. Wuhsi announced (Apr, 23) that in the Changchou, 
Kiangsu, branch of the China Food Company a "protect the grain" movement had been 
launched, with grain now aired 8-9 times a month instead of the former 5-6. Chungking 
reported (Apr. 27) that warehouse cadres in Chengtu and Huayang Hsien, Szechwan, and 
Yaan Hsien, Sikang, had been charged with gross negligence in care of Government 
property when grain in four Szechwan warehouses was found rat-infested, mildewed, and 
full of weevils, while wheat, rice, and barley in Yaan was badly infested and 
germinating. 
AGRICULTURAL PROBLEM 
aLag.211...4_ouction_, Shanghai asserted (Apr. 22) that cadres in Maehang Chu, Ssuyang 
Hsien, Klangsu, were dissatisfied with their farm production quota of 4.8 million 
catties, had it raised to 10 million, and then to 38 million when a check disclosed 
bumper crop conditions. Wuhan announced (Apr. 27) that 27,000 men of the conservancy 
and civilian labor corps had been mobilized to push conservancy work in Hunan Province, 
where they were organized into work teams and were challenging each other. 
Chungking announced (Apr'. 21) that the Sikang Party Committee had issued a directive 
calling upon the people of all nationalities to promote the spring farming program 
by repairing irrigation systems, expanding acreage, and increasing flocks and 
herds. Chungking reported (Apr. 23) that the Production and Drought Fighting Office 
of southern Szechwan was planning a Production and Drought Fighting Day, when 
2,500 teachers and students would assist the peasants. Peasants 1n Wanhsien, 
Szechwan, were reported busy carrying out the preferential treatment program by 
doing farm work for dependents of Armymen. Chungking said (Apr. 25) that a special 
program would be broadcast Apr. 26 by the Southwest Production and Drought Control 
Office, with Government officials discussing irrigation, work relief, and spring 
production. Farmers in Sikang had been instructed to carry out the preferential 
treatment program on the farms, with local Government offices instructed to 
implement and check the program. 
Land Reform. Nanchang reported (Apr. 22) that cadres in Kuangfeng Hsien, Kiangsi, 
had "lapsed into indifference" after land reform, with two Militia leaders resign-
ing and liberated peasants falling under the sway of the landlords, who continued 
their activities against the people. In Linchuan Hsien cadres relaxed their 
vigilance and spent too much time promoting spring farming, with the result that 
landlords refused to farm the land, and damaged Government property by destroying 
trees and waterwheels. Nanchang said (Apr. 27) that in Tungchin Hsiang, Yunkan 
Hsien, Kiangei, landlords still were trying to sabotage production, and had put 
fertilizer in peasants drinking water to make them sick. 
Chungking reported (Apr. 25) that in eastern Szechwan hsien many peasants had 
solved their spring production problems by selling the assets received from land 
reform to buy farm equipment and fertilizer, but that some had used these assets 
for wining and dining, a practice the cadres should stop. Peking reported in

Kueichu Helen, Kweichow, assisted Miao tribesmen in Mao Tsao Tsun with gifts of 
clothing, tools, oxen, and 24 million yuan which they obtained from confiscated 
assets, and helped them to plow and irrigate their land. 
Kunming asserted (Apr. 22) that in Yuchi Hsien, Yunnan, the landlords had been 
exterminated and the confiscated assets used by the peasants to buy oxen and 
implements for spring farming. Kunming added (Apr. 25) that the Yuchi Hsien Party 
Committee had organized an indoctrination class for women so that they might under-
stand the importance of land reform and hear talks on mutual aid teams, the People's 
Militia, and the marriage law. After indoctrination 183 progressive women joined 
rural work programs. In Luliang and Lunen Helen, Yunnan, new cadres were not sure 
of their position and failed to completely liquidate the landlords, who continued 
to prey upon the ignorance of the peasants and say the land distribution was unjust. 
As a result the leadership had to be strengthened so the landlords could be extermi-
nated and their assets confiscated. 
  ChInchow reported (Apr. 23) that peasants in Ihsien Helen, 
Liaosi were 400 mou short in their cotton planting, while those in Heishan Helen 
were 86 moi short. Therefore cadres were ordered to strengthen their leadership and 
"overcome the indifference of the farmers." Yangchow announced (Apr. 24) that in 
one hsiang of Huaian Hsien, Kiangsu, the Party Committee mobilized 800 peasants to 
catch locusts which were damaging farm crops. Yangchow said (Apr. 27) that rural 
cadres in northern Kiangsu had been ordered to take more positive steps in directing 
the farm program, as "farmers are doing very much as they please and not promoting 
the farm production program." 
Wuhsi ennouneed (Apr. 24) that cadres in Chiangyin Hsien, Kiangsu, had been . 
instructed to fight the plague of red spiders, which had attaeked 21,165 mou of 
wheatland. Shanghai said (Apr. 27) that the wheat crop in 11 hsien of East China 
was endangered by the red spider attack, and quoted the CHIEH FANG JTH PAO as warn-
ing that "East China's double catastrophe of drought and inseet plague have greatly 
endangered this year's crops, and emergency measures must be taken at once to save 
the situation." Serious drought conditions had been reported from Tungyang, Sheng, 
and Linhai Helen, Chekiang, with farmlands rapidly drying up and crops withering, 
and 70 percent of the farmland in 52 hsiang of Sheng Hsien without water, half of 
it already eaked. 
Nanchang reported (Apr. 24) that in Tuanhuang Hsiang, Yingkan Chu, Yuchiang Hsien, 
Kiangsi, farmers had been urged to lend grain to "destitute and hired peasants to 
help them tide over the spring famine." Dependents of martyrs and military 
personrel also had been criticized "for not endeavoring to rescue themselves and 
for awaiting Government relief." A farmer named Wang Shui-feng was singled out as 
a typical example of the complacency "representative of the backward thoughts of 
petty agricultural producers," who emphasized production and neglected the study 
of politics, minded his awn personal interests and neglected the integral benefits 
of the State, and made cadres realize the necessity of continuing the class struggle 
in rural areas. Nanchang said (Apr. 27) that the Kanchou Distriet Commissioner, 
Kiangei, had ordered rural cadres to improve their construction and inspection of 
conservancy projects, as a checkup in Tsuncheng Chu, Tayu Helen, and in Hsinfeng 
Helen, had shown a large number of projects destroyed by spring rains. 
Sian complained (Apr. 23) that in the old revolutionary bases the work of increas-
ing production and fighting drought had not been carried out successfully because 
of poor leadership? Sian said (Apr. 26) that the Northwest Department of 
Agriculture and Forestry had called upon rural cadres to train peasants in the use 
of insect sprayers, as farmers in Sanyuan Hsien, Shensi, were reported to have 
discarded their sprayers because they were damaged and never repaired. Chungking 
reported (Apr. 25) that cadres in Pan, Yinchiang, and Tushan Hsien, Kweichow, had 
been ordered to "correct their erroneous attitude of concentrating on the struggle 
against feudalism at the expense of the spring production drive." Chungking said

(Apr. 27) that in southern Szechwan various hsien Governments were distributing relief 
grain and People's Banks were making food loans, as hailstorms had destroyed rice 
seedlings and brought on spring famine. 
Kunming stated (Apr. 22) that in Huihsi Hsien, Yunnan, cadres had sent 1,000 families 
to engage in supplementary production "instead of distributing relief food," but were 
overcoming their indifference to spring production and famine relief. Kunming said 
(Apr. 23) that in Kuchiu Hsien, Yunnan, cadres had been ordered to correct their 
thinking, as they had placed land reform above production, stopping farmers who were 
busy on their farms and accusing them of backwardness for not paying sufficient 
attention to land reform. In Hsiang No. 1, Liushun Hsien, and in Yuchi Hsien, cadres 
neglected the "basic concept of production" and the necessary coordination of land 
reform with production. They paid no attention to peasants' difficulties, such as 
shortage of food, seed, and tools, with the result that "the struggle against the 
landlords achieved only preliminary results because of the peasants low enthusiasm 
for fighting the landlord class."
