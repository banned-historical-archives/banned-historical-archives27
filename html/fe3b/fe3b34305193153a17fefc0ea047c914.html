HIGHLIGHTS 
? In a week during which no major changes occurred 
in the situations most directly affecting US security, 
even the East-West conflict was marked by nothing 
more startling than Premier Stalin's 70th birthday, an 
event Soviet propagandists used largely as an excuse 
for further outpourings on the now jaded Soviet peace 
offensive. 
Meanwhile, the difficulties confronting the United 
Nations were emphasized both by the obstacles to 
implementation of the UN resolution on internation-
ization of Jerusalem in the face of Israeli-Jordan peace 
negotiations (see page 8), and by the complexity of the 
problems plaguing the UN Commissioner entrusted 
with sppervising the establishment of an independent 
Libya (see page 1),

WESTERN EUROPE 
FRANCE 
Communist Purge The Kremlin's dissatisfaction with 
the failure of the French Commu-
nist Party to aggravate social unrest, coupled with the 
menace of Titoism within the Party, is leading to an in-
tensification of Party efforts to liquidate Titoists, petty 
bourgeois elements, and all those suspected of disloyalty 
to the Kremlin. This increasing reliance on "hard-core 
Stalinists will reduce the numerical strength of the 
French Communist Party as well as its political influence. 
There is, however, no prospect of a disintegration of the 
Party. It will become even more vigilant in the pursuit 
of its political objectives and will remain on the alert to 
take advantage of growing labor unrest caused by the 
current increase in prices. 
AUSTRIA 
Labor Unrest The postwar peaceful era in Austrian 
labor-management relations appears 
to be ending. The steady rise in prices Which has inten-
sified the disparity between wages and prices is primarily 
responsible for the current trend toward abandonment 
of wage settlements on a national basis and a return to 
bargaining between individual unions and their employes. 
Such a trend will result not only in an increase in strikes 
but in strengthening the Communist potential for foment-
ing labor unrest.

GERMANY 
East-West Relations The USSR, by transferring to 
the German Democratic Repub-
lic an increasing measure of jurisdiction over technical 
questions affecting relations with West Germany, may 
be attempting to force the Western Powers to grant 
de facto recognition to the Eastern regime. This action, 
however' does not suggest that the Kremlin is making 
immediate plans for using the German Democratic Re-
public to threaten seriously Western access to Berlin. 
Since the formation of the German Democratic Republic 
and the transformation of the Soviet Military Administra-
tion into the Soviet Control Commission, Soviet authorities 
have avoided direct contact with the Western Powers on 
interzonal questions of a technical nature, referring them 
either directly to German officials or through Allied Con-
trol Authority (ACA) liaison channels to the Soviet Control 
Commission. This careful disassociation of the Soviet 
Control Commission from the direct contact with Western 
representatives formerly maintained by the Soviet Military 
Administration may be in preparation for abandonment of 
the ACA liaison channel, in an attempt to force the West-
ern Powers to deal directly with the German Democratic 
Republic on interzonal questions. 
East Zone Regime In its continuing efforts to trans-
form the German Democratic 
Republic into an ostensibly independent regime which 
will be a reliable instrument for maintaining Soviet con-
trol, the USSR has effected several changes in the rela-
tionship between Soviet and German authorities, as well 
as between reliable Communist and fellow-traveling 
German officials. Instead of exercising direct control

through the Soviet Military Administration, the USSR now 
controls Eastern Germany indirectly, though just as effec-
tively, through the Soviet Control Commission, which has 
"supervisory" powers over the policies and actions of - 
the German Democratic Republic. This supervisory power 
is sufficient to insure Soviet control because reliable Com-
munists occupy all important government positions and 
these officials are fully aware that they can retain their 
positions only as long as they carry out Soviet policies. 
Meanwhile, although the USSR is ttking steps to further 
diminish the role in the new Republic of fellow travelers 
such as former Socialists and Soviet sympathizers in the 
Christian Democratic Union and the Liberal Democratic 
Party, these non-Communist parties will probably be 
allowed to continue their shadowy existence for some time. 
Despite these changes, however, the USSR has not yet suc-
ceeded in achieving its goal of transforming the German 
Democratic Republic into a control mechanism which no 
longer needs to depend in the final analysis upon the pre-
sence of Soviet troops.

EASTERN EUROPE 
BULGARIA 
Soviet Problems The liquidation of Traicho Kostov, fol-
lowing a full-fledged propaganda trial 
designed to impress on the Bulgarian people the danger of 
defying Soviet directives, has not solved all the Kremlin's 
problems with regard to Bulgaria, Kostov's denial of his 
guilt and his declaration that he had been trying to protect 
the economic interests of his country found a receptive 
Bulgarian audience and may encourage other nationalists 
within the Bulgarian Communist Party to a passive defense 
against Soviet encroachment, Meanwhile, the Government 
has been forced to admit that the first year of its current 
Five Year Plan has been a failure. With a breakdown al-
ready apparent in the goals for rail and auto transportation 
and electric power production, the Government is now taking 
steps to reorganize its entire agrarian administrative ma-
chinery in an attempt to correct weakness in the planning 
and implementation of its agrarian program. -These economic 
difficulties, coupled with continuing nationalist tendencies 
in the Bulgarian Communist Party, will probably result 
in more direct and widespread Soviet control over the Bul-
garian Government. The number of Soviet personnel in the 
Ministries of Transportation and Electric Power Produc-
tion has already increased and is now being augmented in 
the Ministries of Interior and Commerce.

HUNGARY 
Power Shift A shift in Hungary's Communist Party 
leadership and a tightening of direct 
Soviet control may be foreshadowed by a recent govern-
mental reorganization, which greatly increased the 
power of the State Control Commission and placed it 
under the Peoples' Economic Council instead of the 
Prime Ministry. This important instrument of control 
has thus been taken from Deputy Prime Minister Rakosi 
and given to his principal contender for leadership of 
the Communist Party, Erno Gero. Gero now has a conven-
-lent instrument, if he chooses to use it, for eliminating 
Rakosi's following as a preliminary to the liquidation of 
Rakosi himself. 
GREECE 
Papagos' Plans The possibility that Field Marshal 
Papagos might enter the political 
arena is currently causing new flurries of uneasiness 
among established party leaders. Hitherto concerned 
lest the highly popular Commander in Chief be drafted 
to head an interim "service government" before nation-
al elections, the regular political leadership is now fearful 
that Papagos might actually run for parliament next 
springna move which, in view of his great prestige, 
might well make him an overwhelming choice for an ex-
tended term as premier. These fears have been stimu-
lated by indications that the King and other close friends 
of Papagos are urging him to run in order to assure 
Greece of having a strong, stable post-election govern-
ment.

0  That Papagos will run is still far from certain; 
approaching the age for retirement, not in the best of? 
health, and lacking in zest for the hurly-burly of politics, 
fl he personally would probably like to return to the posi-
tion of Grand Marshal in the royal court now that his 
military career has been crowned with such outstanding 
success. Until his intentions become clear, however, the 
major parties will tend to close ranks against him, while 
the smaller parties will be haunted by fear of being on the 
Li wrong bandwagon.

NEAR EAST - AFRICA 
Israeli-Jordan Talks Israel and Jordan, in their com-
mon opposition to the UN resolu-
tion favoring the internationalization of Jerusalem, may 
possibly conclude a "peace treaty." Israel has agreed 
in principle to give Jordan full sovereignty over a corri-
dor to the Mediterranean and free transit along the 
Jerusalem-Bethlehem road. For its part, Jordan is 
apparently prepared in principle to grant Israel access 
to the potash works at the northern end of the Dead Sea, 
to the Rutenburg hydroelectric plant east of the Jordan, 
and to the Mt. Scopus area in Jerusalem. 
In Jewish-Arab relations, however, there is a 
great difference between agreement in principle and 
settlement in detail. The problem of agreeing on the 
frontier between Israel and Jordan in Jerusalem alone 
has confounded Jewish and Arab negotiators for many 
months. The issue of compensation for Arab properties 
now held by Israel is also extremely complicated and 
probably cannot be settled quickly. Furthermore, neither 
country is likely to commit itself on definitive frontiers 
until it knows the attitude of the UK toward extending 
to Arab Palestine its obligations under the UK-Jordan 
Mutual Defense Treaty, Finally, Jordan may still be 
hesitant to exchange diplomatic representatives with 
Israel so long as the attitude of the other Arab states 
toward Israel remains so antagonistic. 
Notwithstanding these problems of detail, which 
may well be pigeonholed as "unfinished business," sev-
eral factors favor the conclusion of an Israeli-Jordan 
treaty. Both countries recognize that a treaty would

serve their interests by providing the UN with formal 
grounds for modifying its present position on Jerusalem. 
Even now, the Trusteeship Council is faced with the 
dilemma of whether to expend its energies working on 
a theoretically ideal plan which cannot be implemented 
or whether to recommend a watered-down version of 
internationalization acceptable to both Israel and Jordan. 
A treaty, even if it leaves many problems unresolved, 
might also lay the groundwork for a general improve-
ment in Israeli-Arab relations, a development which 
both Israel and Jordan appear sincerely to desire. 
LIBYA 
Administrative Problems The wisdom of Solomon 
and the patience of Job 
will be required of the newly appointed UN Commis-
sioner for Libya. In his task of supervising the estab-
lishment of an "independent and sovereign" Libyan 
state within two years, he must not only reconcile the 
diversities of interest among the Libyans themselves 
but must also cope with the complicated administra-
tive machinery which has been set up. Concerning the 
day-to-day business of government, he will have to deal 
with three different administrations, each with its own 
currency: those of the British in Cyrenaica and Tri-
politania and that of the French in the Fezzan. In setting 
up central government functions, he must cope not only 
with a native National Assembly but with an Advisory 
? Council on which France, Italy, Egypt, Pakistan, the UK, 
and the US--as well as Libyans--are represented.

LIBYA 
There is little doubt that the Arab penchant for 
intrigue, Italian hopes of regaining a new foothold in Tri-
politania, the British desire for a treaty with Cyrenaica, 
the French lack of enthusiasm for the whole idea of inde-
pendence, and the minorities' fears of being overlooked 
will all be refledted in that unwieldy body of advisors to 
the advisor. These factors, together with the open hostility 
of the present administrators to interference with their 
authority, will do little to assist the Commissioner in 
accomplishing his work, especially in a country which is 
economically undeveloped and politically immature and in 
which the population, ethnically and culturally diverse, 
is in agreement on little more than the vague goal of 
? "independence." 
SYRIA 
Army Revolt The recent Syrian Army revolt against 
Chief of Staff Hitmawi, leader of a previous 
army uprising last August, a.pparently had both military 
and political origins. In part, the coup, led by Colonel 
Adeb Shishakli, grew out of the factionalism which has 
rent the army since General Zaim's seizure of power last 
March. Of apparently equal importance, however, was the 
opposition of the Shishakli group to the Syro-Iraqi union 
scheme, which Hinnawi was suspected of trying to force 
on the government. In fact, the immediate cause of the 
coup was evidently the fear that the Syrian Constituent 
Assembly, in refusing last Sunday to include a pledge of 
loyalty to the republican form of government as part of the 
Chief of States oath of office, was moving toward Syrian 
adherence to the Kingdom of Iraq. Although Shishakli has

not intervened directly in civilian affairs, his action 
re-emphasizes the role of the military as a disturbing,

Even if the situation now quiets down, the coup re-

to re-establish civilian controls and to restore political 
stability in Syria.

FAR EAST 
CHINA 
Mao in Moscow One result of Mao Tse-Tung's visit 
to Moscow will probably be the con-
clusion of a Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Friendship 
between the USSR and the Chinese Communist Govern-
ment This treaty, augmenting the Sino-Soviet Pact of 
1945 to which the Chinese Communists have already given 
their stamp of approval, will probably provide for: 
(1) economic and technical assistance by the USSR along 
lines already developing in China, as well as an expan-
sion of cultural relations; and (2) secret military pro-
tocols providing for cooperation between the armed 
forces of the two countries and the joint use and devel-
opment of Chinese military facilities, particularly air 
bases. The presence of outstanding Politl3uro members 
Molotov, Malenkov, and Bulganin at the meeting between 
Stalin and Mao suggests that other important matters 
were discussed. In all likelihood, both Stalin and Mao 
saw in this visit an opportunity to re-examine questions 
likely to become increasingly urgent in the near future, 
such as: (1) Western diplomatic recognition and trade; 
(2) the Japanese peace treaty; (3) further Communist 
penetration of Central and Southeast Asia; and (4) the 
extent of Soviet-Chinese cooperation in Manchuria, Sin-
kiang, and possibly China proper. 
Treaty Policy Although the Chinese Communists have 
stated that they will examine Nationalist 
treaties individually and then repudiate or accept each 
according to its merits, there is little likelihood that 
they will actually take a rational view of the merits of

treaties with the West. The Chinese Communist regime 
is severely restricted in its interpretation of treaties 
by the necessity of accepting special agreements with 
the USSR, while at the same time condemning similar 
agreements made by the Nationalists with Western powers. 
Moreover, recent information from Peking indicates that 
the Communists are probably ignorant of a large part of 
their inherited treaty obligations, and are apparently 
convinced that all Nationalist treaties contain provisions 
betraying Chinese interests. Even if such clauses do 
not appear in the text of the treaties, the Communists 
will probably still believe that the suspected "betrayals" 
are contained in secret protocols.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE 
CHILE 
Communist Plotting Reported Communist plans to 
celebrate a "bloody Christmas" 
by extensive rioting have caused concern to Chilean 
authorities but are not believed to be an immediate 
threat to the stability of the Chilean Government. Re-
cent disturbances and open Communist threats do in-
dicate, however, that the Communists still have the 
ability to exploit favorable opportunities to create 
trouble. Popular discontent over economic conditions 
in Chile and the increased prices resulting from a new 
Government foreign exchange policy have provided a 
situation increasingly favorable to Communist-inspired 
disturbances. It appears, however, that although the 
well-advertised plans for holiday disturbances may 
develop on a relatively minor scale, the government 
will probably not be in any real danger for several 
months.

THE BRITISH ECONOMIC POSITION 
The Labor Government apparently now intends to 
"coast through" the coming pre-election months in the hope 
that, with the immediate drain of gold and dollar reserves 
reversed, moderate measures will keep economic forces 
under control. Although there is? reasonable justification 
for the Government's hope for the next few months, the 
long-term prospects remain uncertain, and another finan-
cial crisis will probably occur by mid-summer of 1950 
unless additional preventive measures are taken. 
With the exception of the continuing visible gap 
between dollar sales and dollar purchases, the general 
trade and production position of Britain is improved some
Sales to the US and to Canada rose sharply during 
October and November, but the net yield in dollars to the 
UK has shown little change largely because of the reduced 
dollar yield per unit of sale. The total value of imports 
through October and November increased at a slightly 
slower pace than exports, however, leaving the adverse 
visible balance of trade at 35.1 million pounds; this is 
the lowest point since March of 1949. The September 
index of over-all industrial production, which was 6.4 
percent above September 1948, reflects increased produc-
tivity since there has been no appreciable gain in the labor 
force during the past year. 
British gold and dollar reserves have continued 
to rise since the initial $84 million inflow between deval-
uation on 18 September and the end of that month when they 
totalled $1,404 million. Food and raw material stocks in-
creased by 100 million pounds during the six months ending 
30 September, reducing import needs for the near term.

The General Council of the Trades Union Congress 
called upon all affiliated unions to hold wage rates at pre-
sent levels until January 1951, provided the retail price 
index stays between 106 and 118. However, the retail 
price index, which remained at the September level of 112 
during October, may-rise above 118 by mid-summer of 
1950. The wholesales price index rose 2.8 percent during 
October and another 1.3 during November. 
Attention in the coming months will continue to 
be focused upon the degree of success attained in building 
up gold and dollar reserves and in narrowing the gap between 
dollar sales and dollar purchases. Any increase in dollar 
exports may not show up for several months. Import prices 
adversely affecting the domestic cost of living will continue 
to cause concern. Anxiety over losses of dollar earnings 
to third countries will grow as long as "transferable 
sterling discount rates continue to widen. The problem 
of the sterling balances will be widely discussed and the 
Government will be urged to re-examine its policy of re-
leases against them. The Government, in the hope of 
reversing the recently increased rate of withdrawals from 
national savings, will continue to exhort;the British people 
to increase their savings.

COMMUNIST DESIGNS ON TIBET 
The announced intention of the Chinese Commu-
nists to assume control over Tibet, coupled with growing 
Soviet propaganda interest in that country, suggests that 
this strongly anti-Communist area, the last on the Chinese 
mainland, will be subjected to intensified Communist pres-
sures, possibly culminating in a military expedition to 
Lhasa in mid-1950. 
Though nominally part of China since the eighth 
century, Tibet has enjoyed virtual independence during 
most of the intervening years. The Tibetans, opposed to 
foreign domination, have seized the opportunity offered 
them by the disintegration of Nationalist China to seek 
again complete independence from China; they also realize 
that their theocratic government cannot survive under 
Communist control. The Chinese Communists appear 
anxious to control Tibet, because the establishment of 
an independent non-Communist state there would be dam-
aging to the prestige of the new Communist regime in 
China. A Communist Tibet would provide additional, 
though limited, opportunities for Communist infiltration 
into India and the border states of Nepal and Bhutan, while 
neutralizing Tibet as a potential base for anti-Commiutist 
activities. Tibet would, however, contribute little to the 
economic or military potential of either China or the USSR. 
The Tibetans, acutely aware of the Communist threat, 
have announced their intention to resist a Communist in-
vasion, requested extensive US aid, and urged the US and 
UK to support their bid for UN membership. India, mean-
while, recognizes the dangers of Communist expansion 
in this direction, but is in no position to offer Tibet any

significant military or economic assistance, and fears 
that the extension of aid might simply result in an ac-
celeration of a Chinese Communist advance into Tibet. 
Although the UK retains its concern about Tibet, it too 
Is unable to offer substantial aid. 
Initially, the Chinese Communists will probably 
confine their anti-Tibetan activity to political penetra-
tion and subversion, concentrating primarily on exploit-
ing the pro-Chinese Panchen Lama, now in Communist 
hands, and on wooing those peripheral monasteries which 
resent the pro-British leanings of the Lhasa authorities. 
By mid-1950, however, the Coinmunists may feel im-
pelled to attempt the military occupation of Lhasa. Al-
though a military expedition could probably reach this 
center of Lamaism and establish Communist control in 
Tibet, such an operation would involve immense logistic 
problems deriving from the country's poverty and inac-
cessibility. Tibetan troops, however, now numbering 
approximately 10,000, are inadequately supplied and 
lack knowledge in the use of modern demolition materials 
and techniques for mountain warfare; therefore, they are 
considered capable of little more than guerrilla resistance.
