 OPEN LETTER TO FRATERNAL SOLDIERS OF THE WHITE ARMY ON THE FORCED OCCUPATION
 OF MANCHURIA BY JAPANESE IMPERIALISM
 25 September 1931
 [Text] Fraternal soldiers!
 Did not warlords of the Kuomintang often tell you that your duty is to "pro-
 tect our country and defend our people?"  But look, troops of Japanese
 imperialism have occupied by force all of the major cities in Manchuria,
 massacred with guns and bombs the toiling masses of workers and peasants
 and soldiers in Manchuria, and consider Manchuria wholly as a colony of
 theirs.  May I ask you: How are warlords of the Kuomintang performing their
 duty to "protect our country and defend our people?"  What are they saying
 to you now?
 As far as Japanese imperialist brutality is concerned, warlords of the
 Kuomintang order you to "offer no resistance," to "receive adverse circum-
 stances with acquiescence," to stretch out the neck so as to allow the
 Japanese imperialist bandits to massacre you.  They order you to become
 "colonial slaves" of Japanese imperialism peaceably.  From here you can see
 that warlords of the Kuomintang can only pay court and yield to imperialism,
 they can only act as running dogs of imperialism, they not only cannot "pro-
 tect our country," but also cannot "defend our people!"
 Nevertheless, the Kuomintang warlords, for the purpose of struggling for
 positions and extending their areas of exploitation and wholesale slaughter
 of the Chinese people, they have staged wild battles among themselves year
 after year.  For the sake of these warlords' wars, they have very courageously
 driven you to the battlefield to kill your own brothers and destroy the life
 and property of the people.  They are exacting exorbitant taxes and miscel-
 laneous levies, impressing men and horses for military coolie-service, and
 sucking dry the last drop of blood of the toiling people.  They are massacring
 the revolutionary workers and peasants; they are compelling people to cultivate
 opium so as to infect the masses; they are creating all over the country
 calamities (flood, drought, famine), the like of which has never been seen
 before.  In exploiting and massacring the people, they all have shown con-
 siderable resoluteness and fearlessness!

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Above all others, at a time when the masses of workers and peasants in our
 Soviet areas, standing up voluntarily, have driven out all imperialists,
 toppled the rule of the Kuomintang, confiscated all land of the landlord
 class, carried out the 8-hour work system, created their own armed forces in
 the Workers and Peasants' Red Army, and established the Workers and Peasants'
 Soviet Government, all warlords of the Kuomintang are fighting desperately
 for their lives and demonstrating their determination and bravery, have re-
 lied upon help from the imperialists to attack us, not once or twice, but
 three times.  They have used planes, bombs, poison gas, artillery, and
 machine guns to slaughter the people in the Soviet areas.  All their attacks
 have been smashed fearlessly by us and by the people, but if we do not root
 them out completely, they will never ease up on us.  In attacking the Soviet
 Government of the people and the Red Army of the people, they also are ex-
 tremely brave!
 Fraternal soldiers!  Have you not suffered enough from the deceit and oppres-
 sion of these warlords?  Think about it: After all, why are you risking your
 life for these warlords?  It may be that you are doing it so as to support
 your family.  As a matter of fact, you yourselves often do not receive a
 cent in wages.  You yourselves do not have enough to eat or enough to wear,
 then how can you support your family?  Your superior officers take you as
 their oxen and horses, as cannon fodder, and want you to risk your life in
 killing your own fraternal worker and peasant brothers so that they may be
 promoted in rank and become wealthy!
 Fraternal soldiers!  You have got to think of a way out!  There is a way out
 for you.   It is revolution!  Now what you have in your hands are guns.  First
 of all, you kill your reactionary superior officers.  Then join efforts with
 the workers, peasants, and all other toiling people in your locality to topple
 the government of the Kuomintang, confiscate the land of the landlord class
 and distribute it among the poor peasants, seize the grain and dwellings of
 the rich and portion them out for the poor to live and to eat.  Make it so
 that workers labor for only 8 hours a day, and organize yourselves so that
 you manage your own affairs.  In this way you will have created a workers,
 peasants, and soldiers' government--i.e., a Soviet Government--and you all
 will have become a workers and peasants' armed force--a workers and peasants'
 Red Army.   If there is already a Soviet Government or a Red Army near your
 garrison, then you either catch your reactionary superior officers alive or
 kill them and go there and join the Red Army.  Only the Soviet Government,
 only the Red Army, can safeguard the interests of workers, peasants, and
 soldiers, overthrow the Kuomintang, overthrow imperialism, and truly protect
 our country and defend our people!
 Fraternal soldiers!  Unite!  Turn round your guns and fight so as to over-
 throw imperialism and the Kuomintang, which are exploiting, oppressing, and
 massacring the toiling masses of China, and establish a Soviet Government
 and a Red Army of the workers, peasants, and soldiers!  Several hundred
 thousand fraternal soldiers of the Red Army welcome you to join our ranks!

 RESOLUTION ON PROMULGATION OF PROVISIONAL TAX LAW--ADOPTED AT THE FIRST SESSION
 OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 [Text]   1.  Tax yields are a most important source of state revenue and ex-
 penditure.                           In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Central
 Government has abolished all land tax, poll tax, exorbitant taxes, miscellaneous
 levies, likin tax, etc. of the Kuomintang warlords and put into effect a
 single progressive tax.
 2.  To any sector, a single progressive tax means that only one category of
 tax shall be levied.  The fundamental rule of tax collection is that apart
 from placing the burden of paying taxes on the exploiting class, the matter
 shall be resolved according to the principle of class.  The exploited class
 and people from the poorest strata shall be exempt from taxes.
 3.  At the present time, due to the revolutionary war, the Soviet areas all
 over the country are not contiguous to one another.  Because of this and many
 other special circumstances, agricultural tax can only be levied with the
 tax on staple products as a standard.  For the time being, the tax on all
 subsidiary products will not be imposed.  Also, agricultural tax is levied
 only from persons who produce more than enough to meet their necessary living
 expenses on a progressive scale.  All those who do not reach that standard
 will be exempt from taxes.  Taxes to be imposed on rich peasants will be
 comparatively heavy.  For them the standard for taxation will be lower by one-
 half than that for poor peasants.                   This fundamental rule is prescribed to
 enable the various provincial governments to determine the agricultural tax
 rates according to local actual conditions.
 4.   With a view to developing the economy in the Soviet areas at present,
 commercial export and import duty and industrial production tax will be dis-
 pensed with for the time being.
 5.   This Tax Law will be put into effect on 1 December 1931.

 RESOLUTION ON THE MARRIAGE LAW--ADOPTED AT THE FIRST SESSION OF CENTRAL
 EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 [Text]  Under the feudal rule the marriage system was so barbaric as to be
 inhuman. The oppression and distress suffered by women were even worse than
 those by men.  Only when the workers' and peasants' revolution is won and
 men and women have attained primary emancipation economically will marriages
 unavoidably undergo changes and marriages based on freedom of choice be rea-
 lized.                    At present, marriages have acquired a foundation of freedom.  We
 should really establish a marriage system based on freedom of choice and
 abolish the feudal marriage system based on arbitrary and compulsory arrange-
 ments and on pecuniary considerations.
 However, women who have just been emancipated from feudal oppression, have
 not yet recovered from the many serious injuries (e.g., bound feet) to their
 bodies or achieved complete independence economically.  Hence, in the question
 of divorce, emphasis for the time being should be placed on the protection
 of the interests of women, leaving most of the obligations and responsibilities
 arising out of the divorce for the men to undertake.
 Children are the masters of the new society.  Particularly in the old society,
 it was the custom not to pay heed to the caring of children.  Therefore, special
 stipulations are made for the protection of the interests of children.
 This Law will be promulgated on 1 December 1931 and come into force immediately.

 The establishment of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese
 Soviet Republic has been proclaimed.  From this day on, there are within
 Chinese territory two states that are diametrically opposite to each other.
 One is the so-called Republic of China.  It is a tool of imperialism and a
 state being used by warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, and the bourgeoisie to
 oppress workers, peasants, soldiers, and other toiling people, and the National
 Government of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Ching-wei is the counterrevolutionary
 organ of political power of this state.  The other is the Chinese Soviet
 Republic, a state of the broad masses of exploited and oppressed workers,
 peasants, soldiers, and other toiling people.  Its banner is to down with
 imperialism, exterminate the landlord class, overthrow the Kuomintang warlord
 government, and set up a Soviet Government throughout the country, so as to
 strive for the interests of the several hundred million oppressed and ex-
 ploited workers, peasants, soldiers, and other oppressed people, and for
 genuine peace and unity all over the country.  Its foundation is built upon
 the hopes and support of the several hundred million oppressed and exploited
 workers, peasants, soldiers, and poverty-stricken people in the Soviet areas
 and non-Soviet areas.  It possesses vast influence to deal a heavy blow to

 the Kuomintang. warlord government, such that it has caused the latter to step
 onto the road from disintegration to dissolution.  It must quickly score a
 victory in the revolution all over the country.
 The Chinese Soviet Republic and the Central Executive Committee, accepting
 the trust of the National Congress, ought to spare no efforts to implement
 the political platform, Constitution, Labor Law, Land Law,. and all other
 ordinances and resolutions drawn up by the Congress, establish a consoli-
 dated and extensive revolutionary base, create a massive Red Army, and organize
 a large-scale revolutionary war, so as to gain an initial victory in the
 revolution in one or several provinces until a nation-wide victory is won.
 At a time when the Government is setting about its work, this notice is
 specially sent to workers, peasants, soldiers, poverty-stricken people, and
 all oppressed people throughout the country for their information.

 LAND LAW OF THE CHINESE SOVIET REPUBLIC--ADOPTED AT THE FIRST NATIONAL
 CONGRESS OF THE CHINESE WORKER-PEASANT-SOLDIER SOVIET
 1 December 1931
 [Text] With each passing day the peasants' struggle led by the proletariat
 is continuing to develop and grow stronger.  The soviet movement is cresting
 and continuing to expand despite the frenzied opposition of the imperialist
 warlords.  It is bringing about the self-arming of the Chinese peasants, the
 organization of the Red A-rmy, and the liberation of peasants, in one county
 after another, from the several-thousand-year-long oppression of the feudal
 landlords.  The land owned by these oppressors is being confiscated and dis-
 tributed, the feudal system is being smashed, and the political power of the
 Kuomintang is being destroyed to establish the political power of the worker-
 peasant-soldier soviet.   This is the political power that can overthrow the
 imperialists and bring about agrarian revolution.
 The first national congress of the Chinese worker-peasant-soldier soviet
 approved the confiscation of land held by landlords and other big private
 landowners and, in order to formulate a unified system of confiscation and
 distribution, it has proceeded from the basis of serving the basic interests
 of the peasant masses and the future of the revolution's development to adopt
 the following land law as the best guaranty for solving the land question.
 Regardless of whether they are leased out or self-farmed, land belonging to
 all feudal landlords, evil gentry, warlords, bureaucrats, and big, private
 landowners are to be confiscated with no compensation.  The confiscated land
 will be distributed by the poor and middle peasants through the soviet, and
 the original owners will have no right to participate in the distribution.
 Hired help, coolies, laborers and farmers, regardless of sex, all have juris-
 diction over land distribution.  With the approval of the peasant masses, the
 unemployed independent laborers in the townships and villages will also have
 similar right to distribution. The aged and the feeble, the lame, and the
 widows who are unable to engage in labor and who have no family members to
 provide them with support should be given social assistance by the government
 of the soviet or handled separately after the distribution of the land.

 The Red Army members, are, advanced. f:ighter;c who support the political power
 u.I,' thy: ;soviet arid. the overthrow of :imperialism, and land must be distributed
 to them, regardless of whether a soviet has been established in their base
 areas or whether their areas are still under reactionary rule.  And the
 soviet government will seek means to have this land farmed on their behalf.
 Article 3.
 As the rich peasants of China have the characteristics of semi-landlords or
 usurers, their land should also be confiscated, whereas the land of the mid-
 dle peasant class will not be confiscated.  The rich peasants can be given
 some comparatively poor "land distributed for labor."  However, there is one.
 condition, and that is this land must be farmed by their own labor.
 Article 4.
 Confiscate the land and assets of all organizers of counterrevolution, organ-
 izers of armed columns of the White army, and active participants of counter-
 revolution.  However, exceptions may be made of poor and middle peasants who
 oppose the soviet not of their own volition but by being lured into it, and
 found by the local soviet to be exemptable from prosecution, but their leaders
 will be prosecuted unconditionally in accordance with the law.
 Article 5.
 The first national congress found that the most thorough of all measures to
 be taken to wipe out all vestiges of feudalism and slavery and to get away
 from the private ownership rights of landlords is the equitable distribution
 of all land.  However, under no circumstances should the local soviet govern-
 ment implement this through force or by fiat.  This measure must be explained
 to the peasants in a comprehensive manner, and it can be carried out only on
 the foundation of willingness from the basic peasantry and with their direct
 support.  When the majority of the middle peasants is unwilling, they may
 abstain from participation in the equal distribution of land.
 The soviet government must assiduously strive to turn over to the peasants
 all shrines, temples, and other public land unconditionally.  But, at the
 time of implementation and handling, the willing support of the peasantry
 must be obtained on the general principle of not interferring with their
 religious sentiments.
 Should the more opulent farmers attempt to distribute confiscated land on the

 been found by the Fir?t Congre:;:; to be deliberate attempts to enrich them-
 selves and impede the development of agrarian revolution.   In accordance
 with the local conditions in the villages, the local soviet will select a
 principle that will serve the best interests of the poor and middle peasants
 and base the distribution of land on it, or on the basis of availability or
 scarcity of labor in each family and the size of the family, or, again, dis-
 tribute equally in accordance with the population count of middle and poor
 peasants and tenant farmers.  Distribution to rich peasants will be made on
 the basis of available labor units (i.e., in the areas where land is dis-
 tributed equally on the basis of population distributed land received by
 rich peasants with available labor should be equal to the land received by
 each individual under the principle of equal, distribution in accordance with
 populace) with population as a supporting factor.  In distributing land, not
 only is the area of the land but, also, the quality (especially in the form
 of yields) to be considered.  Agrarian reform should also be carried out by
 all means possible and suitably at the time of land distribution as a step
 toward whiping out all vestiges of feudalism such as narrow mindedness, one-
 sidedness, and large (ownership of?) farm lands.
 Estates and liquid assets of all feudal lords, warlords, landlords, and evil
 gentry, their houses, storehouses, livestock, and farm implements are to be
 confiscated.  After the land has been distributed to the rich peasants, re-
 maining houses, farm implements, livestock, water pumps, and oil extracting
 machines are to be confiscated.  The confiscated houses are to be distributed
 on the basis of the interests of middle and poor peasants and through the
 local soviets, to the poor and middle peasants and through the local soviets,
 to the poor and middle peasants who are homeless for residential purposes,
 and some of these houses are to be allocated for use as schools and clubs,
 by the committees of local soviets, of the party, and of the youth league,
 and by the red trade unions, poor peasants groups, and various organizations
 and agencies.  Livestock and agricultural implements may be distributed to
 each family or to groups of poor and middle peasants.   In accordance with the
 wishes of the peasantry, the various confiscated agricultural tools can be
 utilized as the preliminary step to forming cooperatives, or through the sug-
 gestion of the peasantry, and with the concurrance of the soviet, they can be
 used to establish a livestock-agricultural implement administrative office to
 provide the poor and middle peasants with these things for use in their farm-
 ing work.   The administrative office should be managed by the local soviet,
 the peasants should pay rentals at a fixed rate, and all repairs of agricul-
 tural tools and implements and the subsidizing of the administrative office's
 workers, as well as the procurement of new tools and livestock should be
 reimbursed by the peasants at a certain percentage of the expenditures.
 Article 9.
 While the assets and the land of landlords and evil gentry are being confis-
 cated, all verbal and written agreements on tenancy rents must be wiped out,

 erasing all obligations and debts to these assets and land, and also proclaim
 null and void all debts and usury (debts).  All agreements between former
 landlords and peasants for voluntary return and reimbursement should be
 strictly prohibited by revolutionary law, and the peasants should not be
 allowed to return in part the land once owned by the landlords and evil
 gentry or partially reimburse the debts owed them.
 All water conservancy works, rivers, lakes, streams, timberland, pastures,
 and large, wooded mountains are to be managed by the soviet and construction
 carried out which will facilitate public use of these resources by poor and
 middle peasants.  In accordance with the wishes of the local peasantry, mul-
 berry groves, bamboo groves, tea hills, and fish ponds are to be allocated
 to them for use in the same way as paddy or wheat fields.
 For the concrete and thorough realization of the benefits of agrarian reform,
 the First National Congress of the Chinese Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet has
 proclaimed the tenant farmers' union, the manual laborer's union, the poor
 peasants group, are necessary groups, and viewed these organizations as the
 pillars of the soviet implementation of agrarian revolution.
 The First National Congress of the Chinese Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet holds
 that under the political rule of the Soviet the nationalization of land and
 water conservancy works is a necessary step toward the thorough elimination
 of all feudal relationships in the rural areas, which is, in fact, to bring
 about a surging, rapid development of the rural economy.  However, the actual
 implementation of this measure will be possible only under the condition that
 the agrarian revolution is victorious in the crucial areas of China, and there
 is basic support of nationalization by the peasant masses.  At this stage of
 the revolution, the soviet government should explain to the peasants the
 benefits to be derived from the nationalization of land and water conservancy
 works.  But, at present, the buying and selling of land, and the leasing of
 it are not prohibited.   However, the soviet government should, at the same
 time, strictly prohibit speculative activities of the rich peasants in buying
 back their original land from the land owner.
 Article 13.
 If the situation is favorable, the local soviet is to operate the following
 enterprises:   1.   land reclamation;  2.   handling of population relocation;
 3.  building new and improvign existing drainage and irrigation systems;
 4.  planting forests;  5. speeding up construction of roads and enterprises
 to impel the development of the rural economy.

 [Text]  For the development of agrarian revolution and anti-imperialism, and
 for the consolidation of the revolutionary union of workers and peasants, the
 First National Congress of the Chinese Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet sets
 forth the following articles as the basis of the current economic policy of
 the soviet.
 I.  Industry
 1.  To ensure a completely independent  overnment of the soviet, all economic
 life lines in the hands of imperialism  such as concessions, customs, banks,
 railroads, navigation, mines, and factories) are to be nationalized.  Lend-
 lease contracts will be re-negotiated on some foreign business enterprises
 currently being allowed to operate and production will continue.  However,
 they must abide by all the laws of the soviet, implement an 8-hour work day
 system and carry out various other regulations.   Should the owners of these
 enterprises contravene these conditions, engage in work slow-downs, shut down
 the enterprise, or interfere in the domestic affairs of the soviet government
 and support the counterrevolution, then the enterprises are to be immediately
 confiscated and nationalized.
 2.  With regard to business enterprises and handicraft industries run by
 Chinese capitalists, the soviet will not nationalize them, but allow them
 to remain in the hands of their original owners.  However, they will be
 operated under the supervision of workers, the factory committee and the
 trade union.   But, should the owners of these business enterprises slow
 down production, sabotage the laws of the soviet, or participate in such
 counterrevolutionary activities as deliberately sabotaging or slowing down
 production, these business enterprises will be confiscated immediately and,
 in accordance with concrete conditions, handed over to the workers labor
 cooperative or the soviet government to manage.
 3.   Strive strenuously to further the development of industry.   The soviet
 government pays special attention to ensuring the development of all business
 enterprises that supply the Red Army (factories, workshops, handicraft indus-
 tries, home enterprises, etc.).

 1.   The soviet should guarantee freedom of commerce.   It should not inter-
 fere with the routine workings of the commodity market.  But the soviet
 must strictly prohibit such speculative activities by businessmen as the
 raising of prices.  It should disband chambers of commerce and prohibit big
 and small merchants from monopolizing prices in the name of the chamber of
 commerce.  Should it discover sabotage or economic blockage by businessmen,
 thereby endangering the supply of basic daily necessities needed by the
 masses, or because of Red Army needs, the soviet government should set price
 ceilings on basic commodities.  These measures are to be taken only when they
 are necessary, and, when it becomes possible, freedom of commerce. is to be
 restored.
 2.  In trade with non-soviet areas, "monopoly of foreign trade" absolutely
 cannot be. implemented as yet, but, at the same time, the soviet government
 should supervise such trade in order to ensure a supply of basic necessity
 commodities to the soviet area.   The outflow of currency must have the per-
 mission of the soviet.
 3.  For the trade of the entire soviet area and to ensure the interests of
 the working poor and to improve the supply of necessary commodities to the
 masses, the soviet must extend all-out assistance to the organization and
 development of consumer cooperatives.  The soviet should give financial aid
 and grant tax exemptions to cooperatives, and it should turn over in part
 some of the buildings and shops that were confiscated for the use of the
 cooperatives.  Moreover, in order to guarantee supply to the laboring masses,
 the government should promote public warehouses to store food grains so as to
 be able to give aid to the masses or sell the grains to them at a low price.
 1.  Wipe out the entire tax system of the warlord government of the Kuomintang
 and its unlawful levies, the soviet will promulgate a unified progressive tax
 so that the burden will fall, instead, on the capitalists.  The soviet govern-
 ment should exempt from taxation the Red Army, workers, and families of the
 poor in urban and rural areas.   In cases of unforeseen disasters, taxes should
 either be remitted or reduced.
 2.  Negate all past verbal and written agreements of slavery and usury, void
 all usurious obligations of peasants and the poor of the cities, prohibit
 anticipatory taxation or debtor's bondage.  The revolutionary laws should be
 applied so as to strictly guard against, and also prevent, all attempts to
 restore relations between usury and slavery.  All items pawned by the urban
 and rural poor are to be returned to their original owners without compensa-
 tion, and the pawnshops are to be turned over to the soviet.
 3.   Old currency notes, for the present, are to be permitted to circulate in
 the soviet areas, but market differences must be eliminated.  However, these
 old currency notes must be given scrutiny and verification to facilitate

 supervision. The soviet should issue its own currency notes and exchange
 them for the old, and, at first, the old currency notes may be kept in
 circulation with the addition of a stamped marking.  All currency notes
 from other areas must be exchanged for the soviet notes or the stamped
 currency notes.
 4.  As a step toward helping all the working poor and to implement a uniform
 currency system, the soviet should establish a Worker-Peasant Bank and open
 branches in the various areas of the soviet.  This bank has the special
 authority to print currency.  It will process loans to people engaged in
 peasant family enterprises, and to cooperatives and small businessmen for
 economic development.  It shall carry out currency exchange, and its branches
 will, in addition, act as the taxing agency.
 5.  The soviet should dispatch representatives to keep an eye on the activi-
 ties of this bank and all other big, privately owned banks and money changers,
 and prohibit them from issuing any kind of currency.   The soviet shall strictly
 prohibit all attempts by bankers to utilize local banks and engage in counter-
 revolutionary activities.
 IV.  Municipal Administration
 1.   Necessary adjustments should be made by the soviet to lighten the rent
 burden of the urban poor.  The houses and assets of landlords, despotic gentry,
 warlords, bureaucrats and politicians are to be confiscated, the houses are to
 be turned over to workers, laborers, and apprentices for residential purposes,
 and the assets are to be divided by the urban poor or applied to public enter-
 prises by the soviet.   The urban soviet should utilize all means to improve
 the housing conditions of the poor.

 CIRCULAR FOR THE ARREST OF KU SHUN-CHANG, TRAITOR TO THE REVOLUTION
 Unnumbered directive of the People's Committee of the Provisional Soviet
 Central Government.
 10 December 1931
 [Text] To the various levels of soviet government in the provinces, counties,
 districts  and villages of the soviet areas and the Red Guards units of the
 Red Army and the broad working masses of workers and peasants:
 To the workers and peasants in the areas under White rule and all oppressed
 masses:
 When he was arrested by the counterrevolutionary investigative units of the
 Kuomintang in Hankow on 25 April 1931, the renegade Ku Shun-chang (also known
 as Li Ming [2746 24941, originally called Ku Feng-ming [7357 7364 7686] and
 has gone under the aliases of Hua Kuang Chi Ni Shu Shih [0553 1684 1142 778
 5880 15971.  About 27 or 28, native of Wu Sung [0702 26461, Shanghai; short
 in build with bulging eyes and prominent nose) immediately capitulated to the
 reactionary regime and revealed the existence of the multi-county soviet
 government of western Kwangtung Province a communication complex of the Chinese
 Communist Party located in Wuhan office of the Red Second Army Corps.  This
 resulted in a sweep and the caputre of a dozen or so revolutionary fighters who
 were all murdered out of hand by the Wuhan reactionary government later.  He
 even revealed a worker on a steamship plying the river who was sympathetic to
 the revolution and of whose existence he alone knew, thereby sending the worker
 into the prisons of the counterrevolutionaries.  With such a bloody price and
 the assurance it brought him to back him up he repeatedly cabled Nanking re-
 questi rig a personal meeting with Chiang Kai-shek, and upon arrival in Nanking,
 he not only secretly reported to the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries about
 the organizational set-ups and activities of the Chinese Communist Party, the
 soviet government, the Red Army, and all revolutionary groups of worker-peasant
 masses, he also identified Yun Tai-ying [1926 0108 53911, a member of the
 Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and a national leader of rev-
 olutionary youths, who had already been sentenced to prison. by the Nanking gov-
 ernment with other comrades.  All of them were immediately shot by the counter-
 revolutionaries.  At the same time he disclosed the five residential locations

 of Chou En-lai, Chu Chiu-pai [4234 4428 4101], Li Wei-han [2621 4850 3352]
 and other members and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Com-
 mittee, whom he had come to know while he was in Shanghai, to the counter-
 revolutionaries.   Orders were immediately cabled to the Shanghai Bureau of
 Public Safety and, in coordination with imperialist police, raids were car-
 ried out at the residences of each of the individuals.  Fortunately, these
 comrades had already left Shanghai at that time and escaped harm.  Following
 this, he repeatedly sent relatives. and household members to Shanghai and,
 using what knowledge he had, investigated the whereabouts of the Chinese
 Communist Party organization and revolutionary groups and their leaders.
 Unfortunately, it was in this net that he had spread that Comrade Hsiang
 Chung-fa [0686 1813 40991, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party,
 was taken and killed.  This became the greatest contribution made by Ku Shun-
 chang in his betrayal of the revolution and capitulation to counterrevolution.
 Thenceforth, Ku Shun-chang gradually became an important official in the K K
 assassination organization of Chiang Kai-shek. He became an assassin for
 Chiang Kai-shek in the company of such counterrevolutionary criminals as Chen
 Kuo-fu [7115 2654 11331, Ch'en Li-fu [7115 4539 11331, Hsu En [1176 1869], and
 Tseng Chang-fu [2582 2254 5706].
 In spite of the fact that the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary
 mass organizations are under extremely difficult conditions of White terror,
 their organizations have become even more consolidated and tightly knit with
 the help of the support given by the revolutionary masses, the recent victor-
 ies won by the Red Army in the soviet areas, the founding of the Provisional
 Soviet Central Government, and the upsurge of the anti-Kuomintang, anti-
 imperialist struggle waged by the worker-peasant working masses in White dom-
 inated areas.   They are even more determinedly leading the worker-peasant
 masses to rally around the soviet banners and carry on the struggle.  There-
 fore, the venomous plans of renegade Ku Shun-chang to wipe out the revolution-
 ary organizations and revolutionary leaders were not successful.  This, there-
 fore, lead to changes in tactics, and baldfaced charges were made to slander
 our revolutionary comrade leaders and the Chinese Communist Party Central Com-
 mittee and make them out as murderers in an attempt to use this vicious strat-
 agem to destroy the trust the masses have in the Chinese Communist Party and
 its leaders.  In an even more despicable move, Ku Shun-chang himself published
 notices in the newspapers calling for the arrest of Comrade Chou En-lai and
 other leading members of the Chinese Communist Party.  He also declared that
 he had never harmed anyone in the Communist Party, and he had been sequestered
 in scholarly pursuits in his home.   Such shameless denials can never cover up
 the bloody havoc wrought upon the revolution by his viciously cruel and poison-
 ous hands.  This is obvious to everyone in the revolutionary masses.  As for
 arrest warrants, it is not necessary to wait for renegade Ku Shun-chang's
 notices in the newspapers.  Every revolutionary fighter and the worker peasant
 masses will have their names on the wanted list of the counterrevolutionaries
 when they physically take part in the revolution, and their lives are forfeit
 if captured.

 Class animosity has reached the stage of struggle to the death, because
 those that the Kuomintang wanted the counterrevolutionaries to arrest are
 those the broad working masses of workers and peasants want to support.
 Anyway, such cruel and fiendish renegades as Ku Shun-chang are abetted by
 the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries, and they are precisely the ones the
 working masses of workers and peasants want to wipe out.  Landlords, bour-
 geoisie, Kuomintang warlords, and bureaucrats are the kind of people the
 counterrevolutionaries are dependent upon, and they are now at the end of
 their tether.  Whereas those who take part in the revolution, and those who
 support it, are the extremely broad masses of workers, peasants, the poor of
 the urban areas, and all oppressed people.  And the victorious government of
 the soviet and the Chinese Communist Party are leading them to wrest nation-
 wide victory for the revolution.  The high tide of revolution is continuing
 to crest, and the 200,000 to 300,000 soldiers of the Kuomintang have been
 defeated time and again by the worker peasant Red Army, with the Red Army
 .encountering very little resistance from them.   So how can one Ku Shun-chang
 and the Chiang Kai-shek killer organization, the K K group, destroy the rev-
 olution?  On the contrary, they will be drowned in the huge waves of the
 revolutions
 For this purpose, the Provisional Soviet Central Government issues a special
 order to the various levels of soviet government, the Red Army, and the Red
 Guards of various areas, and also proclaims to the working masses of workers
 and peasants throughout the country to be on special alert against the devious
 machinations of the Kuomintang counterrevolutionaries and, with one mind,
 endeavor to capture this renegade, Ku Shun-chang.   If this renegade is found
 in the soviet areas, he is to be captured and handed over to a revolutionary
 court to stand trial.   If he should be encountered in areas under White rule,
 every revolutionary fighter, every worker, peasant, or the poor has the duty
 to eliminate him.  The capture and destruction of this renegade Ku Shun-chang
 is a conscious and glorious duty of every revolutionary fighter and of the
 worker-peasant masses.  Such methods as rewards and bribery used by landlords,
 capitalists, and running dogs of counterrevolution cannot be used to insult us,
 the exploited and oppressed masses.  The broad worker peasant masses!
 Consolidate your fronts and strive with one accord for the capture of Ku Shun-
 chang!
 Spread the revolutionary struggle and thoroughly eradicate Chiang Kai-shek's
 killer organization, the K K!

 OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON THE BETRAYAL OF CHINESE
 NATIONAL INTERESTS BY THE KUOMINTANG REACTIONARY GOVERNMENT
 11 December 1931
 [Text]  Dear Beloved workers, peasants, soldiers and revolutionary students'.
 The Kuomintang reactionary government is once more engaging in new secret
 deals to betray China, the Chinese national interests, and the Chinese people.
 According to the news in the papers:  The Kuomintang government has reorgan-
 ized the setting up of a neutral zone in Chin-chou, has proposed the organiz-
 ing of international control of Tientsin and has recognized all previous
 secret treaties betraying the country and the national interests.
 Brothers and sisters!  Do you all understand what this means?  It means that
 tens of thousands of li of territory in Manchuria and several tens of millions
 of people are irrevocably lost to Japanese imperialism and for them to trample
 upon:  It means that Chin-chou and Tienstsin are to be presented on a platter
 to international imperialism and for them to despoil, and it is to put heavy
 chains and shackles on the 400 million people of China so that generation upon
 generation of our children will be forever subjugated to the oppression and
 exploitation of Japanese and International imperialism and become slaves with-
 out a county!   Brothers and sisters!   This is unprecedented and shocking-news
 of plotting to betray the nation, but the reactionary ruling class is clamor-
 ing such lies as "revolutionary diplomacy," final preparations," and "march
 north to recover lost territory."  This is truly the most shameless plot ever
 hatched under the sun!
 Brothers!   Sisters!  Can we allow the reactionary rule to connive freely with
 imperialism to carve us up like sheep?  Can we watch our land being forcefully
 taken away by Japanese imperialism?  Can we endure the cruelest kind of oppres-
 sion, slaughter, and humiliation suffered by slaves in the colonies?  Can we
 silently watch our own brothers being whipped, killed, and slaughtered?  Can
 we unfeelingly watch our sisters being molested, insulted, and raped?  No:  No:
 Ten thousand times no!  We must rise in unison to oppose, oppose the aggression
 of Japanese and international imperialism, oppose the shameless capitulation
 of the Kuomintang rulers, to imperialism, and its betrayal of China: Go on

 strike, boycott classes, and stop work!  Seize the weapons of the reaction-
 aries to arm ourselves and let us all strive to drive out Japanese imperial-
 ism and overthrow the running dogs of imperialism--the Kuomintang!
 Brothers!   Sisters!   Can we still have any illusions and hopes for the
 Kuomintang rule?  The Kuomintang rule has brought year after year of famine
 without end, caused tens of millions of the working masses to live a life of
 suffering, homeless, destitute, hungry, and cold, turned millions of jobless
 workers in the streets with no means of livelihood, fomented endless wars of
 the warlords which resulted in the death of tens of thousands of soldiers,
 whose bones lie scattered in the wilderness, made orphans and widows homeless,
 manufactured countless tragic incidents and secret treaties undermining
 national interests and humiliating the nation, and caused China to fall under
 the iron heel of imperialism with no hope of emancipation.  Can we have one
 more minute of patience with the reactionary rule whose crimes stink to high
 heavens?  No, no, ten thousand times no!  What should we do, then?  We should
 all rise as one and topple this reactionary rule of the Kuomintang!  Organize
 and unite, prepare our forces and weapons, and carry out armed uprisings to
 overthrow the Kuomintang rule and establish a people's own government'. Carry
 out a war of anti-imperialism and national liberation under the leadership of
 our own political political power!
 Brothers!  Sisters!  Can we be victorious over Japanese and international
 imperialisms after we overthrow the reactionary rule and organized our own
 political power to fight a revolutionary war?  Can we smash the well-trained
 and well-supported troops of imperialism?  Yes, yes, ten thousand times yes!
 After 4 years of massive war, the bone-weary worker and peasant masses of
 Russia relied on their own power and the leadership of the Bolsheviks to
 smash the allied army of 14 nations.  And so can we.   The unity of tens of
 millions of people is a force that is superior than all the planes and artil-
 lery of the imperialists, and, what is more, we have the proletariat of the
 world, the oppressed slaves of the colonies, and the USSR, which occupies one-
 sixth of the world, on our side.   Rise up, overthrow the reactionary rule of
 the Kuomintang, establish our own government, and wage a bloody war to the
 death with imperialism:
 Brothers'  Sisters'  The Provisional Central Soviet Government announces to
 you:  The soviet government is the only revolutionary government that opposes
 imperialism to the end.  With the objective to achieve the complete independ-
 ence and.l:iberation of the Chinese nation, we oppose all open and secret
 unequal treaties between the reactionary government of China and imperialism;
 we oppose secret diplomacy; we propose the ousting of all land, sea, and air
 forces of imperialism from China; we propose the confiscation of all banks,

 IMPORTANT DIRECTIVE ON CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET
 15 December 1931
 [Text] In the past, the organization of the various levels of the soviet
 has been poorly structured.  First, administrative areas were too large to
 facilitate administration; second, too many levels of government slowed the
 flow of directives and caused poor liaison; and, third, of special importance
 is the fact that election procedures were not comprehensive.  The election of
 various levels of government was done either by simply calling mass meetings
 or by convening representatives meetings or joint conferences of chairmen
 without passing through the various stages of the election process.  Especial-
 ly the basic organization of the soviet--the urban and rural soviets--had not
 been truly established.  Fourth, the division of labor.and the work procedures
 within the various levels of government were, on the whole, unsuitable.  All
 of the above contradicted the constitution of the soviet and the laws and
 regulation of the central government.
 The provisional central government now announces that the county government
 in the various areas must begin anew to delimit administrative areas and
 reorganize the various levels of government in accordance with the constitu-
 tion and the provisional laws and regulations proclaimed by the central gov-
 ernment.   First in importance is the re-demarcation of (administrative) areas
 and villages (abolishing hamlets and small units) in accordance with the pro-
 visional regulations governing the delimiting of administrative areas.  Next
 is the election of village and town soviets (these are the basic organizations
 of the soviet) in accordance with the election process, and then, in accordance
 with the provisional laws and regulations governing the organization of local
 governments, reconstruct the entire structure of the soviet from the village
 and town levels to the provincial soviet.   This is a task of the utmost impor-
 tance and every level of local government must, with the greatest determination
 and with all its power, carefully and meticulously carry it out.   Only by so
 doing will we be able to avoid having the re-delimited administrative areas
 become as full of faults and riddled with imperfections as the former ones
 were, and only thus can the various newly reorganized levels of government
 avoid becoming like the old.   If such weaknesses are to be eliminated the
 various provincial governments must exert their greatest efforts in directing
 this movement to construct the local soviets.   Besides giving instructions
 the issuance of various notices with detailed specifics, conferences of

 persons with principal responsibilities in the two levels of county and
 administrative area governments are to be convened at local sites and pro-
 vincial locations. Then, select a suitable [deletion] to call a meeting of
 persons with principal responsibilities in the various village. governments,
 with the provincial and county governments dispatching personnel to direct
 these meetings and discuss clearly and in detail the significance of.the
 soviet construction movement and the practical ways to carry it out.  More-
 over, the leadership must. dispatch personnel to various counties to inspect
 when the actual. delimiting of administrative areas and reelection of govern-
 ments are in. progress in order to resolve difficulties and problems and cor-
 rect'errors as they arise.  The direction of administrative areas by county,
 and village by administrative area,.should follow this procedure.  It is
 imperative to achieve excellent results in this current..movement of soviet
 construction..
 The two provinces of Kiangsi and Fukien, and the affiliated county of Jui-
 ching, have . set .the period beginning from 20 December 1931 to 31 March 1932
 as the period for the movement of. constructing soviets in accordance with
 the new laws.   The.soviets of these two provinces and of Jui-thing county,
 should immediately draw up suitable work schedule during this set period to
 enable the re-delimiting of administrative areas and election of various
 level soviets'to, be accomplished in a planned and successful manner within
 period of 100 .days (the delimiting and election of the first level of village
 will consume'_a::major'portion of the effort and time), as well as keeping the
 central government constantly informed' of what has transpired so that it can
 give timely 'directions.  The other provinces are to implement as of date of

 to pay the social insurance premiums.   The congress of trade unions will
 elect a control committee for social insurance organizations.  Furthermore,
 with the approval of the government and under the supervision of the trade
 union and the Ministry of Labor, this committee will manage the collection
 of social insurance funds and its application.

 PRACTICAL MEASURES FOR CARRYING OUT REGULATIONS GOVERNING PREFERENTIAL
 TREATMENT FOR RED ARMY MEMBERS
 Directive No 9 of the Executive Committee
 1 February 1932
 [Text]  The First National Congress of the Chinese Worker-Peasant-Soldier
 Congress passed the regulations governing preferential treatment for Red
 Army members.  These regulations on preferential treatment have set forth
 many superior privileges for the Red Army members.  Why so many superior
 conditions have to be regulated for the Red Army members?  Because, in the
 past several years of struggle, the Red Army has been the main force in the
 resolute implementation of agrarian revolution, the determined opposition
 against imperialism, and against the Kuomintang warlords, and it is a power-
 ful defender of the soviet government.   In the past history of the revolution-
 ary struggles of China it has a glorious record of heroic struggles.   Presently,
 the Chinese revolution is in an environment of savage revolutionary warfare
 and it is in a period of actively carrying out this revolutionary warfare, to
 wage even more ferocious warfare against the imperialist Kuomintang warlords.
 To first achieve victory in one or several provinces, and then victory through-
 out the nation, there must be a massive Red Army.   The Red Army fights for the
 liberation of workers, peasants, and all oppressed people.  They are fighters
 who do battle for the soviet political power, struggle for the liberation and
 the interests of workers and peasants and all oppressed people with the great-
 est spirit of sacrifice.  Therefore, the soviet government and the worker-
 peasant masses should naturally give special preferential treatment to the
 Red Army members so that these fighters will feel assured and will not worry
 about their families, thereby enabling them to concentrate wholly on fighting
 bravely.   For this reason the First National Congress specially set forth-these
 regulations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members.
 In the past, the various local soviets have certainly set forth certain regu-
 lations governing the preferential treatment of Red Army members and their
 families.  However, in their actual implementation, there was a lack of
 attention and care, and, in some areas, outright neglect or no implementation
 at all.  That was tantamount to sabotaging the Red Army and created a great
 obstacle to the expansion of the Red Army and the strengthening of its combat

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 effectiveness.  This is a major error.  From now on all levels of soviet
 government should strictly rectify the errors of the past, and absolutely
 ensure the carrying out of the regulations passed by the All Soviets Congress
 on preferential treatment of Red Army members.  Henceforth, should there again
 be neglect in giving preferential treatment to the Red Army members, or there
 is a dragging of feet in the implementation of regulations governing the pref-
 erential treatment of Red Army members, it will be punished in a similar man-
 ner as for counterrevolution.  Therefore, the following practical measures for
 the implementation of the regulations governing preferential treatment of Red
 Army members are set forth to facilitate p.rtt.ing them into effect.
 1.  With the areas as the unit, immediately investigate who have become mem-
 bers of the Red Army, the number of people in the families of these members,
 how much land they have, how many labor effectives they possess, who lack, or
 have inadequate, labor, total them up and make two copies, retaining one for
 reference and one to be turned over to the county soviet for record.  This
 task is to be completed as of 1 March.
 2.  The political departments and political commissars of the various armies
 of the Red Army and its independent divisions, as well as local armed forces
 divorced from production, will be responsible for detailed registration of
 all commanders, fighters, and workers by name, age, domicile, and family
 situation, and report them to the revolutionary military commission or the
 local soviet government.  This task is also deadlined for completion before
 1 March.
 3.   The local government and the political department and commissars of the
 Red Army will investigate to the best of their ability those fighters of the
 Red Army already sacrificed, and report to the revolutionary military com-
 mittee or the local soviet government so as to have the county governments
 take action.
 4.   The responsible persons of various armies and local armed force units
 will investigate and differentiate by class composition, or by the principal
 or support roles played by those in the Red Army or local armed forces who
 have, in the past, participated in counterrevolutionary organizations regard-
 less of whether they are those who have been sentenced or who have confessed,
 reformed, and remained in the units, and report them to higher echelon organ-
 izations so that decisions could be made on whether their land should, or
 .should riot be, confiscated arid these decisions turned over to the various
 local governments for implementation after decisions have been reached in
 these cases.
 5.  Except for Rod Army fighters with foreign domicile, the registration
 ledgers of the various armies are to be forwarded by the Central Government
 to the various area governments.   They, in turn, will compare the name lists
 of the various army units with their own and report the result to their own
 higher level of government for record.   If there are discrepancies, they are
 still required to be examined carefully and reported to the higher level gov-
 ernment for review so as to avoid omissions or errors.

 6.  The current important problem on the implementation of the regulations
 governing preferential treatment is the mobilizing of the masses to help
 the families of Red Army members cultivate their land and to farm public
 land half for the Red Army.   This should be done by the area and village
 government in accordance with the compiled name lists, totalling up the
 number of Red Army member families with no labor or have inadequate labor
 force, and calculate the amount of voluntary labor needed.  Then total how
 much labor force is available in the various villages of the entire area
 and, accordingly; allocate the worker-peasant masses of a certain area to
 help the families of that area in farming their land and to cultivate the
 public land of the Red Army.   The village soviets are assigned this respon-
 sibility and practical allocations are to be made and cultivation carried
 out by them.
 7.  After receipt of notice from the area soviet, the various village soviets
 are to immediately call a meeting of the village soviet and decide upon the
 method of implementation.   Then call.the families of Red Army members and the
 entire populace of the village to a meeting to discuss and publicize the sig-
 nificance of assisting families of Red Army members in farming their land and
 the cultivation of public land of the Red Army, and the number of voluntary
 labor force the village is obligated to provide.  After the masses have
 approved, allocate the number of days of voluntary labor and the schedule in
 a practical manner.  At the same time, the village soviet should also, do
 their best to convene a meeting of responsible persons of poor peasant groups
 and tenant farmer union and request their help in mobilizing the masses to
 carry out the cultivation of public lands held by the Red Army and extend
 assistance to families of Red Army members in the farming of their land.   The
 village soviet will be responsible for the supervision at cultivation and
 harvesting periods and, at the same time, it must guard against giving coerc-
 ive orders (the rich peasants are exceptions).
 8.   At the time of cultivation and at harvesting period the village soviet
 will apply the methods of propaganda and encouragement to mobilize the broad
 masses before they take place and assist the Red Army and the families of Red
 Army members in these tasks based the voluntary labor force assigned, thereby
 completing the cultivation and the harvesting of Red Army fields somewhat
 ahead of the others.
 9.   Regarding measures for retaining public land for Red Army fighters of
 foreign domicile, they should be in accordance with how much land has been
 distributed to each person in that area and the stipulated quota of public
 land :;et aside.   This quota will be large or small in accordance with the
 land distributed.   For example, the method set up by Kiangsi Province is to
 allocate public paddies for three to five people in villages where the per
 person distribution is 5 tan, and more for those villages with distribution
 exceeding 5 tan.   Those villages distributing less than 5 tan per person
 should also allocate public paddies for at least two persons.  The other
 soviet areas may allocate in a manner similar to Kiangsi's method.  Besides

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 the necessity for old soviet areas to take measures for allocating public
 paddies, all newly developed areas must give their special attention to
 setting aside of public paddies when land is distributed.
 10.  With the administrative area as a unit all public paddies in the area
 are to be totalled and reported to the county and then to the provincial.
 governments.  A report on the total amount of public paddies in the entire
 province is then made to the Central Government.  The General Political
 Department of the Red Army will then distribute the public paddies available
 in the various counties in accordance with the number of persons with foreign
 domiciles in the Red Army.  While reporting this, on the one hand, to the
 Central Government for forwarding to local governments for announcement to
 the masses, on the other hand announcements will also be made to the fighters
 of various army units on how much public land have been newly allocated and
 their locations.  The fighters of the various units will then elect repre-
 sentatives to inspect the allocated paddies at these locations.
 11.  Special markings should be set up by the area government on the public
 paddies in various areas with the notation that it is the public paddies of
 fighters of a certain army unit.   Regarding such items as seeds and ferti-
 lizers, they will be mainly supplied by mobilizing the masses, and, when
 possible, the government will provide additional support.
 12.  After the harvest each year the area soviet will be responsible for
 selling the harvested products and changing them into currency.   This will
 then be forwarded to the county government, and the provincial government
 will hand the currency over to the Red Army for distribution to the person
 enjoying the privilege of the public paddies.
 13.  The names, domiciles, and families of Red Army fighters with foreign
 domicile who have sacrificed their lives should be registered so that when
 the revolution developed to that area at a future date the Central Government
 will issue orders to the local government to investigate and certify in accord-
 ance with the addresses and give preferential treatment to their families in
 accordance with these regulations.
 14.   If, after the death of a Red Army fighter, his family has inadequate
 means, or no means at all, to maintain a livelihood, the government should
 give a financial subsidy in accordance with the living expense needs of the
 area until his children become self-supporting, or until the death of parents
 and spouse where there are no issues.
 15.   The children of Red Army members have the right to free tuition in areas
 where schools have been established.  The village and area soviets will be
 responsible for carrying this out.
 16.   Red Army fighters and their families enjoy special privileges in communi-
 cations, and this will be implemented in accordance with Directive No 1 of
 the People's Committee.

 1'(.  With regard to disabled Red Army fighters, they will be handled by the
 Red Army Relief and Comfort Committee of the (central) military committee
 and the Disabled Veterans Hospital in accordance with the regulations govern-
 ing preferential treatment.
 18.   For the purpose of carrying out the aforementioned measures and all the
 stipulations set forth in the regulations governing preferential treatment
 of Red Army members, a committee has been set up under the military affairs
 department of the various county governments, and it will be responsible for
 the management of matters concerning the preferential treatment of Red Army
 members.  A provincial committee has been set up under the provincial govern-
 ment with the responsibility to oversee and direct the various county commit-
 tees for the preferential treatment of Red Army members.
 19.  In order to supervise the thorough implementation of regulations govern-
 ing the preferential treatment of Red Army members by the various levels of
 government, the Worker-Peasant Inspection Department of the various levels
 of government will be responsible for dispatching personnel at any time to
 inspect, and if it is discovered that the regulations are not being imple-
 mented or charges had been brought by Red Army fighters or their families,
 the department will launch speedy investigations and take quick measures to
 rectify the situation.   The courts may prosecute such cases and punishment
 will be meted out in accordance with the offense.
 Spring is now here and spring cultivation is imminent.   The various levels
 of governments and the political organizations of the Red Army must immed-
 iately discuss practical items of implementation and carry them out in
 accordance with the regulations governing the preferential treatment of
 Red Army members and the measures delineated in this directive.   The progress
 of implementation is to be reported to higher echelon at all times up to the
 Central Government for review.           It is of vital importance that there must be
 no negligence nor dragging of feet.

 RESOLUTION ON THE CONVICTION OF IMPORTANT MILITARY CRIMINALS OF THE REFORMED
 FACTION OF THE AB GROUP BY THE PROVISIONAL SUPREME COURT
 February 1932
 ffext7  the text of the three court rulings should be approved in its en-
 tirety.  However, a revision must be made of the following points:
 1.  Ts'ao Shu-hsiang was originally sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment, but
 this Executive Committee meeting considers this sentence to be too light.
 This is because she was commissar of the Fourth Branch Hospital of the Red
 Army Hospital and blatantly joined the AB Group to sabotage the Soviet regime
 and the Red Army, thus violating the trust of the Communist Party and the
 Soviet Government.  Moreover, Ts'ao Shu-hsiang had studied in the Soviet
 Union for 3 years.  During the time of her study in the Soviet Union, she
 sided politically with all bad elements.  After her return to the homeland,
 she came to the soviet area to work and joined the AB Group.   Thus it is
 obvious that her joining a counterrevolutionary organization was not acci-
 dental.  Hence, her imprisonment must be increased by 2 years and 3 months.
 Altogether, she should be imprisoned for 3 years and 3 months.  The period
 of time during which she is stripped of her right to vote will still be
 according to the original ruling.
 2.  K'ung Fan-shu should have served 3 years' imprisonment according to the
 decision.  But because he had performed considerable work during the revolu-
 tionary war and had been wounded and become disabled, the court reduced his
 sentence by 1 year and 6 months.  However, in the AB Group the duties he had
 assumed were those of general commander.  Although he had performed consider-
 able revolutionary work in the past, the penalty that has been laid on him
 is still too light.  The imprisonment should be increased by 3 months.  Al-
 together, he will be imprisoned for 1 year and 9 months.  However, the period
 of time during which he is stripped of his right to vote will still be accord-
 ing to the original ruling.
 3.  Li Hsin-ch'eng was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment, according to the
 decision.  Because he had been brave in every battle and wounded several
 times, his sentence should be reduced by 6 months.  As a result, he will be
 imprisoned for 1 year and 6 months.  The period of time during which he is
 stripped of his right to vote will still be according to the original ruling.

 4.  Wei Pai-kang should serve 5 years' imprisonment, according to the court
 ruling.  But according to the facts of the case, it is unavoidable that the
 punishment meted out is a little too heavy.  Hence, it should be reduced by
 6 months and the imprisonment is for 4 years and 6 months.  However, the
 period of time during which he is stripped of his right to vote will still
 be according to the original ruling.

 fully aware of this resolution on the reduction and increase of their re-

 LETTER FROM MAO TSE-TUNG TO YUAN KUO-PIING
 6 March 1932
 [Text?  Comrade Yuan Kuo-ping:
 1.  Your first letter from Chiang-k'ou has been received here.  Since the
 masses in San-tu are like what you wrote in your letter, such places as
 Ku-lung-kang ought to be even better than San-tu.  We should exert ourselves
 even more to win them over and not slacken our efforts and keep back because
 of mass awareness.
 2.  Attention should be paid at all times to all tactics and methods used in
 this work.  We should not let this work deviate from the general task of
 "winning over the masses to create a soviet area."' It is not good to lower
 our political slogans to meet the demands of the political consciousness of
 the backward masses.  Now and then, with the intent of winning over the
 masses, we of course can divide our work into a certain number of steps, but
 this should be done in a way that it will not deviate from our fundamental
 task, but will attain our general task of "winning over the masses to create
 a soviet area  in an even more realistic manner.  On the whole, the tactics
 and methods of work indicated in Issue No 3 of the Bulletin of the General
 Political Department are correct, but all of you should apply them flexibly
 and not follow the methods in the booklet stupidly.  Because our previous
 evaluation of the masses of the seven subdivisions of San-tu differs some-
 what from what is said in your letter this time, the application of work
 tactics and methods cannot be carried out mechanically.  For instance,
 judging from present conditions in San-tu, if we follow too mechanically
 the method of attacking the big landlords first and the small landlords later--
 this by no means is a tactical line--we will be stepping onto the road of oppor-
 tunism.  Furthermore, the process of transforming peasants associations into
 Soviets and poor peasants associations must not last a long time.  First of
 all, we should make considerable efforts to arouse the masses of poor peasants,
 tenant farmers, and middle peasants to quickly rise and struggle.  In the
 struggle, the fight against big landlords should be quickly developed into a
 fight against small landlords and rich peasants.   (Goods should be distributed,
 fields distributed, and debts abolished.)  As soon as a comparative majority

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 of poverty-stricken people have risen, that bunch of profiteering small
 landlords and rich peasants remaining in the peasants associations should
 be expelled completely, and organs of political power of the masses--the
 soviets--and class organizations of the masses--the poor peasants associa-
 tions--should be established immediately.  In a word, tactics and methods of
 work depend upon actual conditions.  You should acquaint yourselves with
 local conditions in a very practical way and decide on even more practical
 tactics and methods in accordance with the sentiments and requirements of the
 local populace about struggle before you can achieve still greater practical
 results.
 When the Red masses first enter a White village, reprisals and rash acts
 will necessarily occur.  You should also take note of similar incidents hap-
 pening in other places.                    As to discipline in the army forces,. you cannot
 relax in the slightest.  If the masses want to fight, you should organize
 them into small guerrilla units to distribute the property of the evil gentry
 among the masses.  In order to organize small guerrilla units, you should
 organize elementary mass organizations--peasants associations.  In order to
 organize small guerrilla units, you should even go so far as to organize pro-
 visional organs of political power--revolutionary committees.  In order to
 organize small guerrilla units, you should attack the local tyrants whom the
 masses fear.  Why do I say this?  It is because in such conditions as pre-
 vailing in the seven subdivisions of San-tu (not to speak of places where
 conditions are even worse than in the seven subdivisions of San-tu, like
 Yung-feng where the Third Army is working at present, the vicinity of Nan-feng
 where the 58th Army is working, An-yuan-szu where the Fourth Army is working,
 and the area bordering upon Shih-ch'eng and Ning-hua where the 12th Army is
 working), there is no security for the different organizations such as public
 bodies and organs of political power, and diverse benefits, such as the dis-
 tribution of fields and abolition of debts.   Once the Red Army is withdrawn,
 the landlords will arm themselves and return, and all organizations will
 collapse and all benefits will be in vain.  At this time, only the organized
 small guerrilla units, which have been trained by us and fought against the
 local bullies and distributed their property, and which have reached the point
 where they live in mortal enmity with the evil gentry and landlords, can re-
 treat with the Red Army to the Red border and wait for an occasion to launch
 another @ttack.   These are things that can be preserved.  This is the method
 to be used if your work this time is not to be in vain.   Let us not talk about
 incidents farther back.   Let us talk only about what happened after the battle
 for Chang-sha.  Did not the first stage of work in the P'ing-chiang--Li-ling--
 Yu-hsien area, the first stage of work in the Yuan-shui valley, and the first
 stage of work in the Wu-chiang valley teach us that we had not grasped the
 heart of our work--organizing small guerrilla units that were diverted from
 production?  Was not the work of the comrades who went through untold hard-
 ships to distribute fields and abolish debts, set up soviets, and organize
 Red Guard units (which were not removed from production) the same as having
 been done in vain?  Since in your four letters you did not mention organizing
 guerrilla units, I've expressed myself on the subject at length in this let-
 ter.  However, this is not to say that you should not have a plan to establish

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 a consolidated regime in the seven subdivisions of San-tu.  The conditions
 in the seven subdivisions of San-tu today are vastly different from those in
 present-day Ung-feng, Nan-feng, and An-yuan-szu.  There can be no doubt that
 you should make plans for the establishment of a consolidated government.
 You should plan to arouse the entire masses fully, destroy the armed forces
 of the landlords thoroughly, organize class organizations of the masses and
 class organs of political power, and carry out land distribution.  But you
 should reckon with such conditions as the enemy can still advance rapidly,
 the Red Army must concentrate its forces, and the armed forces of the land-
 lords have not yet been destroyed.  If you have reckoned with these condi-
 tions, then you would have realized that organization of local small guerrilla
 units which are removed from production and fight local bullies is really the
 central task of all your work.  To make organizing guerrilla units the central
 task not only will not ease your other work, on the contrary, will mesh closely
 with your other work.  In the past, the political departments of the various
 armies and the overwhelming majority of comrades engaged in political work did
 not understand this central task of organizing guerrilla units in special cir-
 cumstances.  What they did was work that did not fit in with the environmental
 conditions. Therefore, they always expended much effort and got very little
 results.  For this reason, what is contained in this letter not only are in-
 structions concerning the work of your units in the seven subdivisions of
 San-tu, but also is something which all armies on the entire front and the
 various independent divisions and local guerrilla units should likewise take
 note of and absolutely do the same.

 LETTER TO WEST FUKIEN ON THE WORK AT SHANG-HANG AND WU-PIING
 9 March 1932
 ffext7 West Fukien Soviet Government
 Executive Committee
 Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing have been occupied completely within a few days by
 the 12th Army of our Red Army in coordination with the broad masses of work-
 ers and peasants.  Regimental bandit Chung Shao-k'uei and his forces were
 routed completely and fled to Kwangtung Province.  Winning this great vic-
 tory at the start of expansion of the democratic revolutionary war will bear
 great significance on the development and success of the soviets throughout
 the country.  Especially at a time that the Red Army is besieging Kan-chou,
 the seizure of the two counties of Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing will not only
 menace the warlords in Kwangtung, but also be of great help to the capture
 of Kan-chou.
 The capture of Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing counties not only will expand and
 strengthen the West Fukien Soviet Area, but also will strengthen even more
 firmly the link between Fukien and Kiangsi.  Particularly the. capture of the
 city of Shang-hang, as it is one of the bigger key cities in West Fukien and
 holds an important position politically, economically, and militarily.  There-
 fore, the occupation of Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing is not of a temporary nature,
 and they will be consolidated into a secure Red area in West Fukien and the
 city of Shang-hang will be turned into a Red metropolis.   This is your great
 task.   You must make every effort to accomplish it.
 The People's Council has the following instructions concerning the work in
 Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing:
 1.  Implement correctly the Land Law, Labor Law, and economic policy of the
 All-Soviet Congress.  This is a principal condition and basis for consoli-
 dating the Red regime in the two counties of Shang-hang and Wu-ping.  Under
 this condition, arouse the broad masses of workers and coolies in the cities,
 tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants in the rural areas, and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100020001-5
 laboring people to take an active part in the agrarian revolutionary struggle
 and in the soviet regime.  They will have to gain some real benefits before
 they can be made to support the soviet regime enthusiastically.  You will
 have to have the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other laboring people
 as the base before you can consolidate the Red regime in the two counties.
 2.  To arouse the masses of workers in the cities, you will have to implement
 practically the 8-hour work rule in the Labor Law, raise wages, set down a
 minimum wage standard, improve treatment, and enforce the conclusion of col-
 lective agreement and labor contract at the lowest limit.  The government
 must take?its stand with protecting the interests of workers and bring these
 minimum benefits to fruition immediately.  At the same time, it should actively
 render assistance to workers in organizing unions physically and in the course
 of work.  However, there are several points which we must make clear here and
 which we must guard against, as mistakes have frequently occurred in our work
 in the past:  a)  Concerning the implementation of the Labor Law and the pro-
 tection of workers' interests, we have seen only official announcements that
 are void of content.  The government has not actually put the law into effect
 and has not taken any concrete steps to implement it.  Whether the worker has
 in fact received any benefits, the government has not made any inquiry or in-
 vestigation.                           If the government only issues a notice and an order and then
 brings the matter to a close, it is passivity so far as upholding workers'
 interests is concerned;  b)  In safeguarding workers' interests, the govern-
 ment for the most part did not check over facts and the conditions of mass
 struggle.  It simply used government orders to force the capitalists to
 comply and did not put emphasis on arousing the masses to rise in struggle.
 On the contrary, it caused misunderstanding in this way among the masses, who
 for a time assumed a passive attitude toward struggle; and c)  In implementing
 the Labor Law, we invariably did not investigate the local economic situation
 and the actual conditions and requirements of the workers' livelihood and did
 not set forth properly practical measures of implementation.  Instead, we
 overstepped the limitations imposed by actual economic conditions in the lo-
 cality and enforced the law by coercion.  The result was that many capitalists
 were unable to bear their responsibilities and closed their businesses, there-
 by undermining the current economic policy of the soviet and affecting to a
 very great extent the economy in the soviet areas.  This caused a big increase
 in the number of unemployed and raised doubts among many workers, who became
 passive toward struggle and even went so far as to make secret compromise
 with and concessions to the capitalists.  In the end, it curtailed the en-
 thusiasm of the workers in struggle and weakened their class consciousness.
 This is very harmful.  At the same time, we should oppose even more resolutely
 restraining the struggle of the workers and begin passive in safeguarding
 workers' interests under the pretext of propping up the economy in a soviet
 area and carrying out its economic policy.  In a word, the Labor law must be
 put into effect under the conditions of resolutely safeguarding the workers'
 benefits and not violating the economic policy of the government, and in par-
 ticular, intensifying the enthusiasm of the workers in class struggle and
 building up their support of the Soviet regime.

 3.  As to confiscation of land and distribution of land in the rural areas,
 it is imperative that the Land Law be implemented fully.  The most important
 thing to do is line up with a clear-cut class line and never again allow the
 rich peasants to steal even for a moment the fruits of the agrarian revolu-
 tion.  There is a mistaken conception of land distribution in the past which
 must be rectified.  It is believed that at the start of an agrarian revolu-
 tion it is unavoidable that rich peasants will steal land once, so it is
 necessary to distribute land a second time, or a third time, before the mat-
 ter is finally settled.  For this reason, when people start out to distribute
 land they do it carelessly.  This is utterly wrong.  We can only say that in
 an agrarian revolution rich peasants will inevitably endeavor to steal the
 benefits of the agrarian revolution and precisely because of this, we should
 be even more resolute in arousing the masses to deal a heavy blow at the
 attempts of rich peasants and with a clear-cut class line, not let the bene-
 fits of an agrarian revolution be stolen by rich peasants.  This mistake has
 happened again and again in the newly developed areas of Kiangsi Province.
 The main reason for this is that when land is distributed, emphasis is not
 given to arousing the masses and distribution is carried out by orders instead
 of by the masses.  In this way, rich peasants naturally make use of the oppor-
 tunity to steal.  Of course,  the speedy distribution of land in a newly
 developed area is for the purpose of quickly mobilizing and winning over the
 basic sections of the masses in the countryside so as to consolidate this
 area, but to allow rich peasants to steal the benefits of land distribution,
 this cannot consolidate a new area solidly.  As for rapid distribution, only
 by mobilizing the basic sections of the masses in the countryside to take an
 active part in the land distribution struggle can distribution be carried out
 rapidly and the attempts of rich peasants be dealt a crushing blow so that
 the benefits of agrarian revolution will not be stolen by them.  Before a new
 area.can be consolidated firmly it must have as its base the broad masses of
 tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants who are taking an active
 part in struggle.  Therefore, when land is distributed it is necessary to
 hold a mass meeting and promulgate the Land Law of the Central Government in
 order to mobilize the masses.  The committee on land distribution should draw
 many tenant farmers, poor peasants, and middle peasants as well, into taking
 part in its affairs.  All members of the committee must be elected by the
 masses.  The composition of members of the land committee must be announced
 and investigated at a mass meeting.  Decisions made at every land distribution
 must be reported to the masses in a rally and only after the mass meeting con-
 curs in these decisions will actual distribution be carried out.  The most im-
 portant thing is that when the Land Law is promulgated and the land distribution
 committee members are elected, it must be announced specifically that rich pea-
 sants can only share run-down fields and that they cannot join the land com-
 mittee so as to draw the attention of the masses to them and bring about a
 struggle to deal a blow to their attempts and eject them or prevent them from
 sneaking into the land committee and usurping the authority to distribute
 land.  In the past, when land was distributed in new areas, it was done en-
 tirely through the Red Army.  Most of the time, the Soviet governments did
 not send anyone to give guidance and in the worst cases, just ignored the
 whole thing and let the Red Army bear the responsibility alone.  In this way,
 on the one hand, it hindered the Red Army from performing its other duties.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 At the same time, because of its other duties, the Red Army could not con-
 centrate on distributing land.  Naturally, carelessness in distribution set
 in.  Without question, formalism was very serious in the past within the
 Red Army in the distribution of land. But the local governments had to
 bear the main blame for this state of affairs, because they had relinquished
 their responsibilities and not exercised their leadership in the matter.
 This time, when land is confiscated and distributed in the two counties of
 Shang-hang and Wu-ping, the West Fukien Government must exercise positive
 leadership and perform the task correctly according to the above instructions
 and your own experiences gained in past land distributions.
 4.  You should pay serious attention to the question of middle peasants.  In
 the past, instances of exclusion of middle peasants and assault on them under
 the pretext of carrying out attacks on rich peasants have occurred in many
 places.   This is nothing short of undermining the coalition with middle pea-
 sants and inflicting the greatest harm on the future of the consolidation of
 the Soviet regime and the success of the revolution.   In your work in Shang-hang
 and Wu-p'ing this time you absolutely must not recycle those mistakes of the
 past.  Firstly, on the land question, in carrying out equal distribution, you
 absolutely must abide by the principle governing middle peasants outlined in
 Article 5 of the Land Law (...this can be carried out only with concurrence and
 direct support of the basic sections of the peasant masses.  If the majority
 of middle peasants do not concur, they may not take part in equal distribution)
 and implement it correctly.  Secondly, in the matter of fund raising, you ab-
 solutely should not harass middle peasants.  In newly developed areas it is
 the easiest to start trouble over fund raising.  Funds that we intend to raise
 should not come from middle peasants. Thirdly,, you must actively draw activ-
 ists among the middle peasants into taking part in land distribution and par-
 ticularly in the regime, and strictly prevent the occurrence of such phenomena
 as excluding middle peasants from participating in elections and in the regime.
 In a word, strengthening of the coalition with middle peasants is one of the
 principal bases for success of the agrarian revolution and the Soviet regime.
 You must absolutely oppose encroaching upon middle peasants and even go so
 far as to make concessions to them to a certain degree (like letting them
 take part in equal distribution of land).
 5.   In your work in the cities of Shang-hang and Wu-ping, apart from the
 question of workers and performing your duties in the light of the many fun-
 damental rules and measures contained in the letter from the General Political
 Department on the work at Kan-thou, you must:
 Firstly, act correctly in accordance with the economic policy laid down at
 the National Soviet Congress and the tariff, investment regulations, and loan
 regulations promulgated by the Provisional Central Government, and apply the
 experiences gained at T'ing-chou in this work.  Also render the above docu-
 ments into notices for publication;

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Secondly, make every effort to prop up commerce and do not disrupt it by
 fund raising.  As to fund raising, the targets should be graded and money
 should not be collected from small capitalists and a portion of the middle
 capitalists.  All shops operated by reactionary headmen should be confiscated
 and the crimes of these headmen and the reasons for confiscation of their
 property should be published in detail.  Such proclamations should deal pri-
 marily with confiscation of the property of reactionaries and not with con-
 fiscation of the stores so as to expose any attempt of the reactionaries to
 spread rumors;
 Thirdly, declare formally as confiscated all premises of reactionary organs
 and make them the property of the Soviet government for distribution to
 various government organs and mass organizations for use.  There need not
 occur such anarchical acts of various organs and organizations occupying
 these premises at will.  The houses and property of reactionaries should all
 be declared confiscated by the government.  A number of the houses confiscated
 may be distributed to workers to be used as dormitories and a number leased
 at reduced rent to poor people as residential quarters.  Aside from cash
 which goes to the government, part of the confiscated property may be used
 to aid the Red Army and the masses in disaster areas, and the remainder dis-
 tributed as much as possible among poverty-stricken people in the cities.
 You should oppose any move to transfer all things confiscated to the old
 soviet areas and not to distribute them among the local populace.  You should
 oppose even more firmly such anarchical manifestations as various government
 organs and mass organizations going their own way to confiscate and dispose
 of the property of the reactionaries;
 Fourthly, preserve absolutely such things as schools and culture.  At the
 worst, send people around to supervise their safekeeping and prohibit van-
 dalism; and
 Fifthly, compel shops in Shang-hang to convert immediately the small notes
 and paper money they have issued into cash and withdraw them for destruction.
 In case of necessity, the government should send people around to exercise
 supervision.  Henceforth, all shops should be prohibited from issuing paper
 money.  You should pay attention to the cash money in circulation so as to
 prevent reactionaries and merchants from smuggling it out in quantity, there-
 by affecting the economy in the soviet area.
 6.  Fund raising should be centralized and concentrated in one organ to be
 set up by representatives from the West Fukien Government and the Political
 Department of the 12th Army.  The different organizations and organs should
 be strictly prohibited from dealing blows to local tyrants.  Set up a unified
 base for finance.  Of the money collected, the greater part should be used
 to help the Red Army in expanding the revolutionary war.   Strictly prohibit
 all waste and extravagance on account of a wider source of income.  If waste
 does occur, harsh punishment should be meted out.

 7.  The work of suppressing counterrevolutionaries must be carried out cor-
 rectly in accordance with Directive No 6 of the Central Government governing
 the establishment of committees for the suppression of counterrevolutionaries
 and all fundamental rules concerning the suppression of counterrevolution.
 You should be prepared to set up a judicial department and a political
 security bureau to maintain revolutionary order and carry out judicial work
 relative to the economy.
 8.  The setting up of a provisional regime is very important.  Immediately
 upon its establishment, the revolutionary committee will put into effect all
 the decrees of the National Soviet Congress and the Central Government so as
 to carry out the agrarian revolution and the political platform, suppress
 the activities of counterrevolutionaries, mobilize the broad masses of work-
 ers and peasants, and set up a formal regime.   These are the main tasks of
 a revolutionary committee.  Every revolutionary committee must be elected at
 a mass rally.  The West Fukien Government should make every effort to lead
 and direct the work of the revolutionary committees in various places.   It
 should be resolved by the West Fukien Government that Shang-hang become a
 municipal soviet directly under its authority. When the work of land confis-
 cation and distribution and suppression of counterrevolutionaries has been
 carried out to a certain extent, you should energetically proceed with work
 for the establishment of a formal regime.  First and foremost, the urban and
 rural soviets should accomplish the aim of setting up a genuine representative
 system so as to lay a strong foundation for the soviet organization in the
 two counties of Shang-.hang and Wu-ping.   The establishment of all formal
 regimes must be completely in accordance with the regulations and directives
 promulgated by the Central Government.  Revolutionary committees must become
 organs to lead mass struggle, guard against the development of formalism, and
 prevent rich peasants and reactionaries from sneaking in.
 9.  The creation of regional armed forces must be carried out according to
 plan.  You should discuss with the military district headquarters about the
 methods in doing it so as to build up the military might of the masses to
 defend the soviet area of Shang-hang and Wu-ping.
 10. As to areas newly developed by the Red Army, the West Fukien Government
 has heretofore relied upon the Red Army to carry on the work there, while it
 itself does not exercise active leadership or make any effort to build up
 and consolidate the areas.  For example:   Lien-ch'eng and Ning-hua have been
 occupied by the 12th Army for a long time.  The West Fukien Government has
 not paid any heed to exercising leadership there, with the result that the
 newly developed areas cannot be consolidated.   In the worst case, as soon as
 the Red Army leaves a place, reactionaries will reoccupy it and the place is
 lost to us.   This is an extremely serious mistake.   In the work at Shang-hang
 and Wu-ping, we absolutely cannot permit past mistakes to be perpetuated.
 You should muster and mobilize a large number of working personnel in the old
 soviet areas to go and work in the two counties, and responsible comrades of
 the West Fukien Government should go in person to Shang-hang to direct all
 kinds of work there.  Now you must consolidate Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing with
 all strength.  This is a most practical and most important task at present.

 No other work is as important as this one.  Therefore, we have decided that
 in order to consolidate Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing, the Fukien Congress of
 Representatives of Peasants be postponed.  We hope that you will immediately
 notify the different levels of government of this postponement and take
 advantage of it to step up lower-level elections and remolding work.
 In order to strengthen the work at Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing, the working com-
 rades previously sent by the West Fukien Government to the Central Government
 for training can be sent back to you right away for reassignment to Shang-hang
 and Wu-p'ing to help in the work there.
 Comrades!  The consolidation of Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing is your most central
 task at the present time.   You should accomplish this task with all strength
 and turn the two counties of Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing into the most secure
 soviet territory and the city of Shang-hang into a Red metropolis.
 Lastly, we hope that you will reproduce this letter for distribution to the
 Political Department of the 12th Army and working comrades at Shang-hang and
 Wu-p'ing.
 Please report to the Central Government at any time on recent conditions in
 Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing and on the work there from now on.

 DIRECTIVE FROM PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO FIRST WORKER-PEASANT-SOLDIER
 SOVIET CONGRESS IN FUKIEN PROVINCE
 March 1932
 [Tex-t  Comrade representatives to the First Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet
 Congress
 Your All-Fukien Soviet Congress was inaugurated on the first most glorious
 anniversary of the world proletarian revolution--the anniversary of the
 Paris Commune.  At a time when the situation of the Chinese revolution has
 developed to a very crucial moment all over the world, and particularly in
 the midst of expanding the revolutionary war at present, the 12th Army of
 the Red Army scored a great victory in successively capturing Shang-hang
 and Wu-ping, the holding of your congress is of great significance.  At the
 same time, it demonstrates that the revolutionary task being shouldered by
 your congress this time is the greatest in history.  Apart from sending re-
 presentatives to attend your congress and help in guiding its work, the
 Central Executive Committee specially sends you this written directive.
 1.   Both in the world and in China, the current revolutionary situation has
 entered a most critical new period.  This tense new situation is being
 symbolized by the consolidation and flourishing of Soviet Socialism, sudden
 decline of world capitalism, contradictions between the two systems of
 Socialism and capitalism reaching an extremely acute degree, and stepping
 up of attempts by imperialism to attack the Soviet Union.   The tension
 symbolized by the inner contradictions of imperialism has deepened the crisis
 of outbreak of imperialist war.   Simultaneously, the crisis of world revolu-
 tion has gradually ripened with each passing day.  Owing to the sharp devel-
 opment of these crises, it suddenly happened in September last year that
 Japanese imperialism employed force to occupy first China's three Northeast
 Provinces and then Shanghai.  This was not only a crisis symbolized by
 Japanese imperialism partitioning China and suppressing the Chinese revolu-
 tion in order to save itself, but also an outbreak of the acute contradictions
 of imperialism striving to partition China and redivide the world.  Hence,

 since the outbreak of this incident the conflict between Japan and the United
 States in particular has become extremely tense.  All imperialist countries
 have mobilized and made other preparations for war.  With all this saber
 rattling, the situation has developed to an explosive point.  Nevertheless,
 the imperialists have not forgotten about attacking the Soviet Union.  There-
 fore, they are attempting to turn this war at any time into a war against the
 Soviet Union.
 In China, since their defeat in the third offensive against the revolution,
 the reactionary Kuomintang and its government have been symbolized by diver-
 gence and disintegration and the daily deepening collapse of their reaction-
 ary rule.  After the outbreak of the incident of the Northeast Provinces,
 they have become increasingly more brazen in betraying China, taking the
 place of the imperialists in trampling on the anti-imperialist movement.
 The rule of the reactionary Kuomintang throughout the country has become
 even more bankrupt and the authority of this reactionary rule has been
 crushed to almost nothing in the revolutionary struggles of the masses.  To-
 day, after selling the Northeast Provinces, the Kuomintang and its government
 continue to sell Shanghai.  Recently they have been trying to provoke a war
 among the imperialists and prompt them to settle without delay the question
 of the partition of China so as to sell the whole of China and sacrifice
 countless workers, peasants, and other toiling people under the planes and
 artillery shells of the imperialists in a war.  Nobody knows how many people
 in the Northeast Provinces and Shanghai have sacrificed their lives under
 the places and guns of Japanese imperialism, but the Kuomintang and its
 government have fled toward Loyang preparatory to turning over the coastal
 area along the Yangtze River to the imperialists to be used as a battleground.
 The Kuomintang warlords still hang on to the coattails of various imperialist
 countries, however.  When the great war breaks out, there can be no doubt
 that they will become the tools of the imperialists to contest for China and
 massacre the masses. At the same time, even if under the circumstances the
 Kuomintang and its government should become bankrupt, it is certain that they
 will be sent to their graves by a worker-peasant revolution.
 In the national revolutionary movement, since the great victory of the third
 revolutionary war and the establishment of the Provisional Central Government
 of the Chinese Soviet Republic, the soviets and the Red Army in various
 places have continued to gain great victories and progress.  The high tide
 of anti-imperialism all over the country came about as a result of the inva-
 sion of China and massacre of the Chinese people by Japanese imperialism,
 but it has surged like roaring waves under the bold-faced attempt of the
 Kuomintang to betray China.  At present, this anti-imperialist movement has
 developed to the point where the masses in many places armed themselves
 voluntarily and fought against Japanese imperialism directly, Party head-
 quarters and government organs of the Kucmintang were demolished, and down-
 with-the-Kuomintang slogans were shouted openly.  Especially in Shanghai
 recently, soldiers of the White army stood up voluntarily and acting con-
 trary to Kuomintang orders, resisted the Japanese army directly at the front.
 The development of the workers' struggle throughout the country will gradually
 secure for us the leadership of the anti-imperialist movement.  The sudden

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100020001-5
 revolutionization of soldiers of the White army means that not only in the
 midst of the anti-imperialist movement they will fight against Japan vol-
 untarily, but also they will mutiny and stage uprisings and enter the Red
 Army.  All this shows that the Chinese revolutionary movement and the anti-
 imperialist national revolutionary movement in particular are forging ahead.
 Prospects are that they will inevitably converge under the Soviet banner
 and in a national revolutionary war, will drive out imperialism, overthrow
 the Kuomintang rule, and strive for victory of the Soviet all over the
 country.
 2.   This is a new period in history, a time for revolution and war.   Hence,
 our task is to develop the revolutionary war actively.  We will lead the
 Chinese national revolutionary struggle with the revolutionary war, oppose
 the invasion of China and massacre of the Chinese people by Japanese impe-
 rialism with a national revolutionary war, destroy the reactionary Kuomintang
 rule with the revolutionary war, and stamp out an imperialist world war with
 a national revolutionary war.  This is a most critical time in the develop-
 ment of the revolution, a time most favorable to the development of the
 Soviet revolution.  Just as we began to expand the revolutionary war on a
 large scale, we have scored great new victories and made considerable pro-
 gress.  Our specific task for the time being is to keep up these victories
 by working even harder to mobilize tens of millions of workers, peasants,
 and other people to participate in the revolutionary war and proceed with
 the expansion of this war on a large scale to contest for major cities in
 neighboring areas and strive for a Soviet victory first in one province and
 then in several provinces.  This is also the most important central task to
 be shouldered by your congress this time.
 3.  In order to carry out this task, all the work at your congress will
 center around the expansion of the revolutionary war.   First of all, you
 should discuss all kinds of specific policies concerning the realistic
 mobilization of the masses.  This work of mobilization is primarily to pro-
 mote struggle and plunge into the heat of struggle.   To heighten the enthu-
 siasm of the masses of workers and peasants in struggle, it is necessary
 to enforce effectively the Labor Law and Land Law. The congress must set
 up a formula in a very specific form for implementation of the Labor Law
 and Land Law.   Only through actual contacts in struggle can we arouse the
 hundreds of thousands of workers, peasants, and other people of Fukien
 Province to join enthusiastically in the revolutionary war.
 +.   To develop the revolutionary war, it is necessary to expand and strengthen
 the Red Army.   This is the main strength to develop the revolutionary war.
 The congress must discuss in a very concrete way practical measures for carry-
 ing out the expansion of the Red Army and implementation of the preferential
 treatment of the Red Army.   It must repudiate the previous local concept in
 West Fukien of expanding only the regional armed forces and not caring about
 expanding the Red Army, because this is very harmful to strengthening the
 force to carry out the revolutionary war and developing the actual tasks of
 revolutionary war.

 5.  To develop the revolutionary war and strive for a Soviet victory first
 in Kiangsi Province, it is necessary to adopt an offensive strategy aimed
 at expanding outward actively.  This offensive strategy is by no means
 adventurism in that it entails no venturesome advance and no abandonment
 of the consolidation of bases.  On the contrary, it is to consolidate our
 successes and forge ahead.  The congress must also set the direction of ex-
 pansion.  Essentially it will be northward.  This will coordinate with the
 over-all expansion plan of the Central Government to strive actually for
 Kiangsi and several of its neighboring provinces as an initial victory.  But
 in other respects, it is likewise necessary to expand the Soviet area out-
 ward.  And to accomplish the task of expanding northward, the most central
 task at present is to consolidate Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing.  The congress
 must discuss concrete measures to mobilize a great number of cadres and
 carry out the work that should be done as pointed out in the letter from
 the Central Government to the West Fukien Government.  The consolidation of
 Shang-hang and Wu-p'ing will not only cement the link between Kwangtu ng and
 Kiangsi Provinces, but also strengthen the force and consolidate the founda-
 tion for expanding outward and carrying on the revolutionary war.  We must
 be firmly against a venturesome advance that does not seek consolidation of
 the bases.   Similarly, conservatism that seeks only consolidation and not
 outward expansion is extremely detrimental to the current task of carrying
 on, the revolutionary war to expand outward on a large scale.   The congress
 should struggle resolutely against any such tendency.
 6.  To strengthen the force for expanding the revolutionary war, it is neces-
 sary to consolidate the economic strength for expanding the revolutionary
 war.   The congress must discuss in detail a formula for developing the economy
 in the Soviet area and increasing the rate of production and concrete measures
 for implementing the economic policy.  As. to the fiscal question, the congress
 should draw up very specific measures to unify finance in accordance with the
 financial regulations promulgated by the Central Government.  The question as
 to how to practice frugality in expenditures in order to help expand the re-
 volutionary war should be discussed even more realistically.                         The congress
 should resolutely oppose serious manifestations of willful extravagance at
 the different levels of government in the past and set forth measures of
 punishment for such acts in the future.
 7.   To strengthen the force of expansion in the revolutionary war, it is neces-
 sary to strengthen the organization and training of the regional armed forces
 and enhance their practical role in the revolutionary war.   In the past, al-
 though the regional armed forces of West Fukien were unsound, they absolutely
 were not like what people generally say, that "the West Fukien regional armed
 forces are useless" or "the people of West Fukien cannot fight."   Such mis-
 taken concepts must be firmly opposed by the congress.   The regional armed
 forces and the masses of workers and peasants of West Fukien not only have
 engaged in prolonged struggle against the enemy, but also have created an
 extensive Soviet area.   They possess great strength for waging revolutionary
 struggle.   The main reason why earlier regional armed forces were not strong
 was that the line was mistaken.   During the period of adventurism West Fukien
 suffered a great defeat.   Later, in the first, second, and third revolutionary
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 wars, it committed errors of conservatism militarily and did not know how
 to apply guerrilla warfare tactics.   Sometimes it did not correctly estimate
 the balance of enemy strength and adopted the method of stubborn attack (as
 in the several offensives against K'an-shih and Hu-lei), with the result
 that partial military losses were sustained, the morale of the troops was
 lowered, and fighting power was depleted.  At the same time, inattention to
 leadership and to the military and political training of the regional armed
 forces was also an important reason.  The congress must meticulously discuss
 measures to reorganize the regional armed forces and strengthen political
 and military work and put guerrilla warfare tactics to use, so as to enhance
 the role of the regional armed forces in the revolutionary war.
 8.  To strengthen the leadership for expanding the revolutionary war, it is
 necessary to set up a strong and capable Soviet government at different
 levels.  The congress should realistically discuss measures to establish
 soviets in accordance with the regulations and resolutions promulgated by
 the Central Government.  Here, we wish especially to draw your attention to
 the establishment of a Soviet representative system in the cities and country-
 side.   This system is the basis of the Soviet organization and the most
 powerful basic organization in a Soviet to lead the masses and mobilize
 the masses.  The congress must oppose earlier manifestations of Soviet for-
 malism and disengagement from the masses.  These are all tasks for setting
 up a strong and capable Soviet.   In case there are serious obstructions,
 the congress must draw up concrete measures to carry out inspection of work
 at the different levels of the Soviet.
 9.   In the past several years the West Fukien Soviet has achieved great suc-
 cess and victories in engaging the enemy in a great struggle, carrying out
 resolutely the tasks of agrarian revolution, creating an extensive soviet
 area, and implementing the land program of the government.  At the same time,
 it has also committed many mistakes and displayed many shortcomings.   The
 congress must make a review of its past work.   Only in this way can valuable
 experiences in earlier struggles be summed up and all mistakes and short-
 comings be rectified.
 10.  In the past, through errors of the adventurist line, West Fukien suf-
 fered plenty of defeats. Later, it turned around from the adventurist line.
 This was immediately followed by the first, second, and third offensive of
 the enemy, and because West Fukien committed mistakes in military tactics,
 many regions were sacked and a part of the soviet area was occupied by the
 enemy and still has not been recovered.  In addition, due to errors in leader-
 ship of the regional armed forces, some border regions were ravaged by
 brigands.  Nevertheless, due to an incorrect understanding of the causes of
 these phenomena and as a result of past mistakes in lines for work, a great
 number of working personnel of the Soviet have even overlooked the current
 favorable situation in the development of the revolution and have taken a
 pessimistic view and developed a feeling of despair.  This is a very serious
 mistake.  We must understand that the current revolutionary situation is
 extremely favorable to the development of the revolution.  At the same time
 when we are leading the masses in expanding the revolutionary war outward,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 these sentiments are extremely harmful and we should not allow them to exist
 and grow.  The congress must struggle mercilessly against such sentiments.
 Here, the need is even greater for the congress to carry out a transformation
 of work strictly in accordance with the lines for work prescribed by the
 National Soviet Congress and the Central Government.  It is certain that the
 work in the entire province of Funkien will have rapid development and bring
 even greater progress and success to the Fukien Soviet Area.
 The above instructions are provided for your discussion of all problems in
 the congress.  The Central Executive Committee holds a firm belief that this
 congress will certainly meet with complete success in the end and accomplish
 the critical tasks of the revolution at the present time.  Lastly, we hail:
 Long live the success of the First Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet Congress in
 Fukien Province'.
 Long live the victory of the Soviet!
 Long live the Chinese Soviet Republic!

 ORDER OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON MOBILIZATION AND DECLARATION
 OF WAR AGAINST JAPAN
 15 April 1932
 1T-ex-t7  Since the invasion of China's three northeast provinces and the
 attack against Shanghai by Japanese imperialism, the Soviet Central Govern-
 ment in its communiques has repeatedly pointed out that Japanese imperialism
 aims at the complete colonization of the three northeast provinces, that the
 Shanghai incident will become a concrete manifestation of the partition of
 China by the imperialist gangsters, and that the Kuomintang government and
 its warlords of different factions will even more brazenly capitulate to the
 imperialists, betray China, and suppress the anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist
 movement of the Chinese people nation-wide, and will absolutely not make any
 anti-Japanese move that really seeks national independence and liberation.
 Present developments of the situation prove completely that the appraisal of
 the Soviet Central Government is correct.  A Manchurian puppet government has
 been set up in the northeast provinces.   This is the most faithful and
 obidient running dog of Japanese imperialism.   The peace negotiations being
 held in Shanghai and the League of Nations investigation mission are nothing
 but a spoils conference and a spoils setup for the imperialist gangsters to
 carry out the partition of Shanghai and China.  Certain Kuomintang warlords,
 who had been compelled to assume an appearance of being anti-Japanese due to
 the bravery of those soldiers who fought against the Japanese voluntarily,
 have now shown their true colors.  Ma Chan-shan has become war minister in
 the Manchurian government, and warlords Chiang and Tsai have participated in
 the peace negotiations of the imperialists to partition Shanghai.  The
 Kuomintang government stands ready at any time to accept the order of the
 League of Nations to carve up the Chinese nation.   Its propaganda about so-
 called "protracted resistance" is meant to deceive the anti-Japanese people
 throughout the country on the one hand, and on the other hand, to seek aid
 from another bloc of imperialist countries (American imperialism in particu-
 lar) and provoke a world war so that the imperialist gangsters may resolve
 the question of the partition of China in that war.   In the past several
 months, the Kuomintang government and its warlords of different factions,
 adhering to the will of the imperialists, have made the greatest efforts to
 dissolve anti-Japanese organizations all over the country, suppress anti-
 Japanese strikes, massacre anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist masses, shoot
 down with machineguns the brave soldiers who had resisted the Japanese

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 voluntarily, and prohibit the activities of the people's volunteers.  In
 particular, they have employed the greatest military force to deal with their
 offensive against the soviet area and the Red Army.  All this shows that the
 Kuomintang government and its warlords of different factions are entirely
 tools of imperialism to suppress directly the Chinese national revolutionary
 movement.   They not only will never wage a national revolutionary war against
 Japanese imperialism, but also will become the ultimate obstacle to the pro-
 secution of a national revolutionary war'.
 Only the toiling masses, the workers and peasants, all over the country
 represent a genuine anti-imperialist force.   Only the Soviet and the Red
 Army can really conduct a national revolutionary war against Japanese impe-
 rialism.  Today, being trampled under the iron heels of Japanese imperialism,
 the oppressed Chinese people are unwilling to accept the insults of the
 Kuomintang, and in high indignation, have risen to engage in revolutionary
 struggle against Japan and the Kuomintang.  With the aim of leading the toil-
 ing masses, the workers and peasants, all over the country in carrying through
 the revolutionary task of driving Japanese imperialism out of China, the
 Soviet Provisional Central Government hereby formally declares war against
 Japan.  The Soviet Provisional Central Government, wishes to point out to the
 oppressed people throughout the country that the soviet area has long since
 extricated itself from the fetters of imperialism, but the Kuomintang war-
 lords, under the leadership and direction of imperialism, will on no account
 ease up their offensive against the soviet area and the Red Army.  Had not
 for the offensive of the Kuomintang warlords, the toiling masses, the work-
 ers and peasants, and the Red Army would have long stood on the side of the
 courageous soldiers and volunteers fighting against the Japanese directly.
 Therefore, the Soviet Provisional Central Government is at present leading
 the Chinese Workers and Peasants' Red Army and the broad masses of workers,
 peasants, and other toiling people of the soviet area in actively carrying
 out a revolutionary war to seize major cities beyond the border of the soviet
 area and destroy the Kuomintang rule.   Precisely, the realistic prosecution
 of a national revolutionary war is an indispensable prerequisite to a direct
 war against Japan.  The Soviet Central Government calls on workers, peasants,
 soldiers, and all other toiling people throughout the country to arise and
 take an active part in carrying out the revolutionary war under the Soviet
 red banner.   Those people in areas under White rule should voluntarily arm
 themselves, organize people's anti-Japanese volunteers, seize the arms of
 the Kuomintang, landlords, and bourgeoisie, and fight against Japan directly,
 setting up revolutionary military committees to direct this latter move.
 Soldiers of the White Army should rise in revolt, overthrow their reactionary
 officers, do battle against Japan voluntarily, organize workers and peasants'
 red armies to overthrow the Kuomintang rule all over the country, and establish
 a Soviet regime of the people throughout China.   In this way, they will drive
 Japanese imperialism out of China with a national revolutionary war, opposing
 the partition of China by the imperialists, and striving for the independence
 and liberation of the Chinese nation.

 Hence, apart from making public through a circular telegram this advocacy of
 declaration of war against Japan and an action program, the Soviet Provisional
 Central Government issues the following instructions to the Workers and
 Peasants' Red Army all over the country and the Soviet Government at various
 levels throughout the Soviet areas:
 1.  The Central Revolutionary Military Council, military committees in va-
 rious Soviet areas, military district headquarters in various places, and
 Red Guard units (i.e., military affairs departments) in various counties
 should carry out mobilization of all Red warriors for the declaration of war
 against Japan so as to make every Red warrior understand that active expansion
 of the revolutionary war, annihilation of the forces of Kuomintang warlords
 attacking the Soviet areas, seizure of major cities beyond the border of the
 Soviet areas, and overthrow of the Kuomintang rule are precisely the indispens-
 able prerequisite to the waging of a national revolutionary war against Japan.
 The more the civil revolutionary war is expanded, the more disintegrated the
 Kuomintang warlords will become, and the closer the occasion approaches of
 direct war against Japan.   So the Red warriors throughout the Soviet Area
 should be ready for the arrival of national revolutionary war on an even
 larger scale.  Mobilization for the declaration of war against Japan should
 absolutely not wait for direct war with Japanese imperialism to begin before
 being carried out.   Moreover, the courageous soldiers and people's volunteers
 in coastal areas under White rule have long refused to place themselves under
 the command of Kuomintang warlords and have fought against the Japanese
 voluntarily.   They are in urgent need of guidance and assistance from the
 Soviet Area and the Red Army.  Therefore, mobilization for the declaration
 of war against Japan and active outward expansion of the revolutionary war
 absolutely cannot be split apart.  Mobilization for the expansion of the
 revolutionary war should be considered as a blow to Japanese imperialism and
 as stout support of the anti-Japanese masses and brave soldiers in the White
 areas.  Military mobilization should be carried out to the extent that every
 Red warrior cannot leave his unit unless she is wounded or sick, those who
 desert will be subjected to punishment and public ridicule, regional armed
 forces will observe the same discipline as the Red Army, Red Guard units
 that are not diverted from production will step up military training,
 military affairs committees will proclaim and enforce Red martial law
 throughout the Soviet areas, production in arsenals will be increased, grain
 stations and transportation stations will be set up along all major communica-
 tion lines, a portion of the spiked millet crop will be stored up in prepara-
 tion for a rice shortage, expenditures will be kept down in preparation for
 a protracted war, precautionary fortifications facing outward will be built
 along the borders of newly developed regions, and armed units for fund raising
 will stand ready to move (a major portion of the taxes to be collected by the
 government will naturally be furnished to the Red Army so as to enable this
 main military force to continue performing its fighting task).  Moreover,
 guerrilla units will be organized in great numbers to expand outward along
 the border of the Soviet Area, because they may be able to lead the people
 in places close to major cities or within the imperialist sphere of influence
 in organizing anti-Japanese volunteers to conduct guerrilla action.

 2.  The General Political Department of the Workers and Peasants' Red Army
 and political departments at different levels of the Red Army should carry
 out political mobilization within the Red Army and regional armed forces.
 They should conduct extensive propaganda on the declaration of war against
 Japan among the Red warriors and bring to light on a regular basis in HUNG-
 HSING PAO fTed Star Journal and other Red Army publications such facts as
 the invasion and partition of China by Japan and other imperialist countries,
 and their massacre and oppression of the Chinese people, and the betrayal
 of China and insulting of the Chinese nation by the Kuomintang, so as to
 stimulate the enthusiasm and courage of the entire Red warriors in the
 declaration of war against Japan and heighten their determination to expand
 the revolutionary war outward and liquidate the Kuomintang warlords and
 their rule.  Furthermore, they should compile and print all sorts of pam-
 phlets and pictorials, raise slogans of propaganda and provocation having
 a bearing on practical actions at the present time.  Above all others, they
 should pay attention to the political work of the Red Army in newly developed
 regions, and particularly those places close to major cities.
 3.  When the Workers and Peasants' Red Army progresses toward the sphere of
 influence of Japanese imperialism, the combat task of the Red Army will be
 to annihilate the Kuomintang forces which are in league with the imperialists.
 If we let go those Kuomintang forces which are attacking the Red Army without
 wiping them out, we will be giving them a very good opportunity to exterminate
 the Red Army in coordination with imperialist forces.  This is a step that
 will bring confusion to the anti-Japanese national. revolutionary war and not
 really drive Japanese imperialism out of China.  When Red guerri lla armies in
 their outward expansion approach the Japanese imperialist sphere of influence,
 they should lead the people in organizing anti-Japanese volunteers, arming
 themselves voluntarily, conducting guerrilla action, and fighting against
 Japan directly.   They also should draw soldiers of the White army into fight-
 ing against Japan voluntarily and together with them, and organize revolution-
 ary military councils to direct this action so as to divide and overthrow
 the control of the Kuomintang warlords.
 4.   The different levels of the Soviet government in the various soviet areas
 should immediately conduct a mass mobilization for the declaration of war
 against Japan.  In the first place, they should step up mobilizing the toil-
 ing masses, the workers and peasants, to join the Red Army voluntarily, ex-
 pand the revolutionary war outward, and be ready to fight against Japanese
 imperialism directly.  They should mobilize the entire toiling masses to
 undertake voluntarily rear echelon services in the revolutionary war, first
 by joining the Red Guard and Young Pioneers, which are not diverted from
 production.  They should cause the toiling masses throughout the Soviet areas,
 whether male or female, to clamor enthusistically for military training in
 order to prepare themselves for war agains' Japan.   They should strive to
 mobilize the people to perform the work of consolidating the bases of the
 Soviet areas, step up enforcing Red martial law and regional self-defense,
 save on expenses and food to help the Red Army, and store up public grain to
 supply to the Red Army.   They should mobilize the masses to redouble their

 efforts in farming so as to have a bumper harvest this year, consolidate the
 Red postal service, and make a sustained effort to repair bridges and roads
 so as to strengthen communication in the Soviet areas.  They should imme-
 diately levy a progressive tax on commerce and be prepared to collect a land
 tax so as to increase the revenues of the government.   They should mobilize
 the toiling masses, the workers and peasants, to raise the production of sup-
 plies for the Red Army (such as clothing, bedding, shoes, headgear, and
 ordinance), organize stretcher bearer teams, transport teams, laundry teams,
 and comforting teams to assist the Red Army in battle, follow the regulations
 governing the preferential treatment of the Red Army, help family dependents
 of the Red Army in tilling the fields, and cultivate the public fields of the
 Red Army.
 5.   This order is issued all the way down to the subordinate-level units of
 the Workers and Peasants' Red Army and regional armed forces and to all
 Soviets in the cities and countryside.       They should draw up their respective
 mobilization plans in accordance with this order.  The Central Revolutionary
 Military Council all the more should make public its own plan of mobilization.

 CIRCULAR TELEGRAM AGAINST THE KUOMINTANG SIGNING AN AGREEMENT TO SELL
 WOOSUNG-SHANGHAI
 9 May 1932
 Jex7  The capitulation of the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang government
 before imperialism and its betrayal of the national interests are being
 carried on even more unabashedly and openly.  On 5 May, the Kuomintang
 government signed a so-called cease-fire agreement with Japan and all other
 imperialist countries.  This agreement is the outright selling of Shanghai,
 center of the proletariat of China.  In the agreement, Japan is allowed to
 amass great numbers of its naval, army, and air forces in Shanghai on a
 long-term basis, while Chinese troops can never be stationed in the sur-
 rounding areas of Shanghai.  In actual fact, this is an unlimited expansion
 of the area of Shanghai's International Settlement and a concrete step to
 bring about the conversion of Shanghai into a free city under international
 control.
 This kind of shameless capitulation and overt act of betrayal show up even
 more clearly the Kuomintang government as traitors in the partition of China
 by imperialist countries and as "trail blazers" in the invasion of China by
 the imperialists.  And yet, at the same time, the Kuomintang government,
 under the direction of the imperialists, has concentrated all its strength
 to attack the Soviet Area, which has long gained liberation and extricated
 itself from the fetters of the imperialists, and try preventing the Workers
 and Peasants' Red Army from carrying on its anti-imperialist national re-
 volutionary war.   In the course of the Shanghai negotiations and signing of
 the agreement, it has been exposed even more thoroughly that the League of
 Nations is the organizer of the partition of China and that all imperialist
 countries alike are cooperators of Japanese imperialism and proponents of
 the partition of China.
 The Soviet Provisional Central Government hereby proclaims before the.toil-
 ing masses of China that as representative of the toiling masses all over
 the country:   it renounces the negotiations and secret agreements entered
 into by the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang government with Japan and all
 other imperialist countries and the May 5th cease-fire agreement signed by
 the traitorous Kuomintang government; it calls upon the toiling masses

 throughout the country to rise resolutely to wage a revolutionary national
 war against Japanese imperialism and all other imperialist countries, and
 oppose the running dogs and "trail blazers" of the imperialists--the
 Kuomintang government--in order to maintain China's territorial integrity
 and seek the complete independence and liberation of China.
 The Soviet Provisional Central Government calls upon the toiling masses all
 over the country to rise in struggle, arm themselves, and support the vic-
 torious assaults of the Chinese Workers and Peasants' Red Army to overthrow
 the counterrevolutionary government of the Kuomintang, and under the Soviet
 banner, carry out resolutely and thoroughly a national revolutionary war.

 TELEGRAM FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO THE HUNAN-KIANGSI PROVINCIAL WORKER-
 PEASANT-SOLDIER CONGRESS
 9 June 1932
 [Tex7  Hunan-Kiangsi Provincial Soviet for transmittal to the Provincial
 Worker-Peasant-Soldier Congress
 Comrade Representatives!
 Due to transportation problems, the Soviet Provisional Central Government
 could not send representatives to attend your congress.  It can only send
 you a brief directive telegram.
 1.   Today, at a time when imperialist countries are frantically carrying on
 a war against the Soviet Union and the partition of China, and the revolu-
 tion in China is making progress, as evidenced in particular by the several
 unprecedented victories of the Soviet Red Army, the imperialist countries
 have turned from secret intervention to direct armed suppression of the
 Chinese revolution.
 2.  The rule of the Kuomintang is disintegrating.  But to continue betraying
 China and act as "trail blazers" for the imperialists, and save itself from
 demise, it is conducting new frenzied attacks on Soviet areas and the Red
 Army all over the country.   Now the time has arrived for revolution and
 counterrevolution to engage in a struggle to the death, now the stage has
 been reached for the civil war in China to turn into an all-out war against
 imperialism.
 3.   The balance of class strength has been altered and is now even more
 favorable to the development of Soviet revolution.  At present, the Soviets
 are adopting a positive course of liquidating the offensive of the imperial-
 ists and Kuomintang with a series of revolutionary attacks.   It is to
 mobilize and arm the masses to the maximuni and implement completely the
 Central Government's mobilization order on the occasion of the declaration
 of war against Japan to win an initial victory by capturing Kiangsi and its
 neighboring provinces.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100020001-5
 4.   Your congress should carry on all its work under this task, set an even
 more concrete course of action to mobilize and prepare the masses to join
 Red fighters in the struggle against imperialism and to overthrow the
 Kuomintang rule, draw up an even more specific plan to Sovietize the western
 bank of the Kan River and capture Kan-chou, Chi-an, and Nan-ch'ang in co-
 ordination with the Red Army and the Kiangsi Provincial Soviet.
 5.  The congress should arrive at a very concrete decision regarding making
 a bid to expand the Red Army and implement regulations for the preferential
 treatment of the Red Army, and should sufficiently discuss the building up
 of regional armed forces and the development of guerrilla warfare, extending
 the Soviet areas, and reinforcing the leadership in all work and struggles
 in the White areas.
 6.   To enhance the enthusiasm in struggle of the toiling masses, the workers
 and peasants, it is imperative to implement thoroughly the Soviet government
 program.  The congress should enforce the Labor Law in its entirety and
 carry out land inspection to see whether or not the land Law is being im-
 plemented in full.  It should carry out agrarian construction and raise
 production in a planned way.
 7.  Consolidate urban and rural congresses, bring about a genuine democratic
 system, and draw the masses of workers and peasants into taking part in the
 government and its work.
 8.  On the question of suppression of counterrevolutionaries, apart from
 implementing correctly Order No 6, the congress should prevent the mistake
 of another abandonment of the suppression of counterrevolutionaries.   But
 the handling of workers and peasants who unconsciously joined all sorts of
 covert and fraudulent organizations (such as opium-smoking clubs and lovers'
 societies) should not be put on a par with the handling of elements who
 consciously or knowlingly joined the AB Group.  There should be a difference.
 We should not judge the former category of people guilty of having formally
 joined a counterrevolutionary organization.   Only in this way can we win over
 the masses who have been deceived into unconsciously joining covert organiza-
 tions and prevent counterrevolutionaries from intimidating them into falling
 into their schemes.
 9.  It is necessary to take stringent measures to rectify past mistakes of
 inciting the masses to go and grab rice from the White areas.  These things
 have impaired faith in the soviets and increased the antipathy of the masses
 in the White areas, and have been made capital of by the counterrevolutionaries.
 The grain and rice of landlords in the White areas for the most part should
 be distributed among the masses of workers and peasants locally.  Only a part
 of it should be used to aid the Red Army and a part to aid people in Soviet
 areas who have been trampled underfoot and suffer from a shortage of rice.
 But this should still be publicized among the masses in the White areas.

 10.  The Provincial Soviet in the past classified opposition against rich
 peasants into pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary.  This is extremely
 erroneous. The congress must repudiate this kind of theory.  That the masses
 did not take an active part in production in the past was essentially the
 evil consequence of exacting fines and levying contributions impermissibly
 without regard to classes, and not of opposing exploitation by rich peasants.
 11.  Implement the economic policy correctly so as to enlarge the financial
 resources and establish an economic base for expanding the revolutionary war.
 Develop the economy, improve tax collection, and organize guerrilla units to
 raise funds in the White areas on the one hand, and on the other hand, present
 ways and means to "cut down expenses to provide for war expenditures," punish
 severely corruption and wasteful acts, and put into effect a truly unified
 financial system so as to relieve the Red Army gradually of its official fund-
 raising task and enable it to concentrate solely on carrying on the revolu-
 tionary war.
 12.   To carry out thoroughly all this work, it is necessary to enforce a
 work inspection system so as to eradicate bureaucratism, corruption and de-
 generation, passivity and sabotage.  It was wrong that the Provincial Soviet
 did not set up a worker-peasant inspection department in the past.  The dif-
 ferent levels of government must now establish such a department in accord-
 ance with the regulations to be promulgated at this congress, elect veteran
 Communist Party members who have had a long history of struggle and are
 activists to serve in it, and call upon the broad masses of workers and
 peasants and mass organizations to take part in this work.
 13.  The congress must thoroughly review the past work of the Provincial
 Soviet and of the government at different levels.   It must mercilessly bring
 to light all mistakes made in the work before it can implement correctly all
 resolutions and orders of the National Soviet Congress and the Central
 Government and accomplish what should be its tasks.  Finally, we wish suc-
 cess to your congress.

 PROVISIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL OUTLINE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 --Adopted at the 16th Regular Session of the People's Council
 a
 20 June 1932
 Jext7  1.  In the Central Government the Department of Internal Affairs is
 attached to the People's Council and is known as the Department of People's
 Commissioners of Internal Affairs.  It is known as the Department of Internal
 Affairs in counties and provinces under the direction of the Presidium of
 the Executive Committee.  No department of internal affairs is set up in
 districts.
 2.  Administratively, the different levels of the department of internal
 affairs are placed under the direct authority of the department of internal
 affairs of a higher level, thus establishing a direct systematic relation-
 ship, and absolutely act under the order of that department.   However, at
 the same time, they are subjected to the guidance of the presidium of the
 government of the same level, thus creating a lateral relationship. A de-
 partment of internal affairs may organize a committee on internal affairs to
 be composed of three to nine members.
 3.  After the election of the director of a lower-level department of in-
 ternal affairs by the Soviet congress of the same level, his name must be
 submitted to the department of internal affairs of a higher level for
 approval.
 4.  For the time being, the department of internal affairs has charge of
 municipal administration, people's police, criminal cases, criminal investi-
 gation, public health, communication, post and telecommunications, food,
 so(:ial security, census, registration of births and deaths, and of marriages,
 etc.   Under the Department of People's Commissioners of Internal Affairs are
 established tentatively the following:
 (a)  Directorate of Municipal Administration;
 (b)  Administrative Bureau;
 (c)  Directorate of Public Health:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 (d)  Directorate of Communication;
 (e)  Directorate of Social Security; and
 (f)  Directorate of Posts and Telecommunications.
 (Note 1)  The directorates of public health, communication, post and tele
 communications, social security, and food are provisional organs to be set
 up prior to the establishment of the departments of public health, communi-
 cation, posts and telecommunications, etc., whose work is being administered
 by the department of internal affairs on a temporary basis.
 (Note 2)  For the time being, the department (division) of public health will
 not be established in the municipal Soviets, districts, counties, and pro-
 vinces.                        Under the department of internal affairs, a division of public
 health will be set up temporarily, and in a district it will be the respon-
 sibility of the presidium of that district.  A department (division) of
 food must be set up in all municipal Soviets, districts, counties, and pro-
 vinces, subjected to the guidance of the Department of People's Commissioners
 of Internal Affairs in the Central Government.
 5.  The department of internal affairs in a county or province will set up
 only these divisions:  administrative, municipal administration, communica-
 tion, public health, and social security.  A municipal Soviet will establish
 an administrative division to administer the people's police and concurrently
 handle criminal investigation.  Bigger cities will set up a division of
 municipal administration and an administrative division to have charge of
 city administration, people's police, and criminal investigation.
 6.   In the Department of Internal Affairs in the Central Government, apart
 from the director and deputy director, there is a head for each of the six
 directorates, and in the provinces a head for each of the five divisions,
 namely:  administrative, municipal administration, communication, public
 health, and social security.  In the county there is a head for each of the
 two divisions, and in the municipalities there is only the head of the ad-
 ministrative division.
 (Note)  In a small county the director of the department can act concur-
 rently as the head of one of the two divisions, leaving only one divisional
 head to be added.
 7.  Aside from the responsible working personnel listed in Item 6, considera-
 tion may be given to the employment of technicians to undertake technical
 work.   Such personnel will be appointed by order of the director.
 8.  The business to be handled by each of the directorates (divisions) are
 as follows:
 (a)  The directorate of municipal administration is to administer the city's
 construction affairs, such as highways, streets, streetcar lines, electric
 lights, and water supply, and to construct and manage other city enterprises.

 (b)  The administrative bureau of administrative division is:   (a) to admin-
 ister the people's police, train and educate the people's police, conduct
 census, keep registers of births and deaths and of marriages, set up street
 lights, oversee and direct the people's police in maintaining order in the
 city and cleanliness in the streets and upholding the prohibition of opium-
 smoking and gambling; and (b) to direct criminal investigation, train criminal
 investigation personnel, and investigate and arrest all kinds of criminal
 offenders (such as thieves, robbers, murderers, etc.).
 (c)  The directorate (division) of public health is to administer hospitals,
 take precautions against epidemics and infectious diseases and keep them in
 check, pay attention to public health, inspect land and water conveyances,
 community mess halls, and people's homes for. cleanliness, test and supervise
 doctors and pharmacists, and inspect the drug and medicinal herb business.
 (d)  The directorate (division) of communication is to plan, construct, and
 inspect roads and bridges, and supervise their repair and improvement, ad-
 minister shipping, dredge navigable channels, and set up beacons, and admin-
 ister overland transportation (such as railroads, highways, and air navigation)
 and its improvement, and all other matters concerning communication.
 (e)  The directorate (division) of social security is to administer relief to
 the poverty-stricken in society and relief in case of flood, drought, and
 other kinds of calamities.
 (f)  The directorate of posts and telecommunications is to develop and ad-
 minister the postal, telegraph, radiogram, and long-distance telephone ser-
 vices.
 (Note)  Posts and telecommunications are under centralized management,
 therefore the directorate of post and telecommunications is set up only under
 the Department of People's Commissioners of Internal Affairs in the Central
 Government and not below the provincial level.
 9.   In case of necessity, the various directorates or divisions may set up
 committees and appoint experts as members.   The head of the directorate or
 division will serve as chairman and committee members will range from three
 to five in number.
 10.   The organizational outlines of the department of food and the depart-
 ment of public health in the local government and detailed regulations
 governing their work will be formulated and promulgated separately.
 11.   A number of advisors may be appointed to supervise the conduct of
 departmental business and guide the work of subordinates.
 12.   Detailed regulations governing the office work of the department of
 internal affairs will be formulated separately.

 13.  The provisional organizational outline may be revised or abolished at
 any time by the People's Council.
 14.  This provisional organizational outline takes effect from the day of
 promulgation in the two provinces of Fukien and Kiangsi and in Jui-chin
 county directly under the central authority.   However, in soviet areas
 which are not contiguous to the Central Soviet Area, it takes effect from
 the day of its arrival.

 ON CONTINUING THE REFORM OF LOCAL SOVIET GOVERNMENTS
 Directive No 15 of the Central Executive Committee
 20 September 1932
 Text?  At a time when the current revolutionary war is developing sharply,
 the central task of the soviets is to lead and expand the revolutionary war
 and every kind of work should center around the war.  All sacrifices made
 will be for winning total victory in the war and to improve and consolidate
 the leadership of the soviets is a basic condition for winning total victory
 in the war.   The local soviets have gone through a complete reform and they
 have made partial progress in their work.   However, it has come to light
 that in the central task of leading and expanding the revolutionary war,
 the leadership of the local soviets is weak and that many mistakes have been
 committed.  First of all, they have not centered their work around the war.
 For this reason, in many places they have not actively proceeded with ex-
 panding the Red Army and mobilizing the masses to go to the front and join
 in the fighting.  Some have not resolutely carried out attacks against the
 enemy in their leadership of the regional armed forces.  Take, for example,
 the Lung-yai Revolutionary Military Committee and the Ch'ang-t'ing County
 Soviet.  Both not only did not tenaciously lead the masses in engaging the
 enemy in resolute struggle, but they shrank back and fled, with the result
 that the soviet areas suffered considerable losses.  They did not pay heed
 to the political leadership of guerrilla units, creating serious manifesta-
 tions of Red-White antagonism.  They did not even take a firm step to expand
 the soviet areas and consolidate newly won soviet areas.  Such facts as
 these fully show that the soviet governments in some places are not sound
 and that they do not perform their tasks determinedly.  This is exceedingly
 detrimental to the development and victory of the revolutionary war.
 Looking at the soviet governments themselves, we have noticed that there
 still are alien class elements hidden in some of them and that other
 governments are still displaying a non-class line to the fullest.   This
 non-class line has frequently been manifested in questions concerning land
 and protection for workers.  Manifestations of bureaucratic degeneration
 are developing in a number of local soviet government.  Manifestations of
 corruption are still very serious.  Their methods of work often are divorced

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 from the masses.  Mostly, they adopt the method of issuing an order and
 compeling the masses to carry it out.   They have not fully implemented the
 regulations governing the preferential treatment of the Red Army, thereby
 impeding the work of expanding the Red Army.   They have disregarded women's
 rights and unrealistically implemented the marriage regulations, thereby
 obstructing women from participating in revolutionary work.  Lower-level
 governments do not pay attention to orders from a higher-level government
 and merely perform their work perfunctorily.   Regular congresses of urban
 and rural soviets have not been set up.  In the worst cases, some rural
 soviets close their doors and do no work.   In all the work, the majority of
 them only have the name, but not the work.  All these manifestations and mis-
 takes show that the local soviets are not sound and cannot have the strength
 to undertake the task of leading the revolutionary war.
 In order to strengthen the leadership of the soviet governments in the
 revolutionary war and eliminate all mistakes and shortcomings in the work
 of the soviets, it has been resolved to continue to re-elect and reform the
 local soviet governments.  Through re-elections we will clear the soviets
 of non-class alien elements and all other elements who are passive saboteurs
 of revolutionary war work, drive corrupt and degenerate bureaucratic elements
 out of the soviets, admit activists as new cadres, and set up strong and
 capable soviet governments to carry out realistically the task and work of
 leading the revolutionary war.
 The election procedure this time is not to conduct elections at the different
 levels of government in the Fukin and Kiangsi provincial soviets simulta-
 neously, but to hold separate elections with the counties as a unit.   This is
 because now is the time to expand the revolutionary war and if elections are
 carried out simultaneously in all places, the governments will devote all
 their energy to the work of conducting re-elections and this will necessarily
 cause the work of expanding the revolutionary war to come to a standstill and
 thus will be of no advantage to the revolutionary war.  As to the main cri-
 terion of re-election, how a government performs its work in leading the
 revolutionary war will decide whether the re-election of the government will
 be a complete one or partial.  Below are two lists of names of counties, one
 calling for a complete re-election and the other for a partial re-election:
 1.   Complete re-election:   In Kiangsi--Nan-kuang, Shih-ch'eng, Hui-ch'ang,
 Hsun-wu, An-yuan, Yu-tu, and Yung-feng.   In Fukien--Chang-t'ing, Ning-hua,
 Hsin-ch'uan, and Wu-ping.   In Lung-yai a county soviet government will be
 set up formally.
 2.   Partial re-election:   In Kiangsi--Hsing-kuo, Sheng-li, Ning-tu, Kung-lueh,
 Kan-hsien, Lo-an, and Wan-t'ai.   In Fukien--Yung-ting, Shang-hang, and
 Jui-chin counties directly under the central authority.
 In this re-election, we should mobilize the masses to participate in the
 re-election campaign and review and criticize the work of the soviets
 through developing the revolutionary war.  We.should make the re-election

 campaign serve as an actual mobilization to arouse the masses to expand the
 Red Army and take part in frontline work so as to set right past peaceful
 re-elections and election campaigns that were removed from the war.
 In this re-election, the different levels of the government should pay special
 attention to drawing activists among the workers into joining county con-
 gresses and district and county executive committees so as to reinforce the
 worker composition of the different levels of the soviets.
 Upon receipt of this directive, the different levels of the soviet government
 should immediately make preparations for re-election.  The period of re-
 election shall be determined by the Soviets of the two provinces of Kiangsi
 and Fukien and the Presidium of the Soviet of Jui-chin county directly under
 the central authority.  The re-election formalities will still be in accord-
 ance with the provisions of the election by-laws.

 ON COMMEMORATION OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
 Order No 9 of the Central Executive Committee
 24 September 1932
 Jex.  November 7 this year is the first anniversary of the establishment
 of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic and at
 the same time, the 15th anniversary of the victory of the October Revolution
 of the Soviet Union.   In the past year, internationally the revolutionary
 situation in China has made the greatest progress and socialist construction
 in the Soviet Union has gained great success, intensifying all the more the
 collapse of the capitalist world and the development of world revolution.
 In this past year, the imperialist war against the Soviet Union and the par-
 tition of China have reached an unprecedented critical state.  Since the
 establishment of a nation-wide unified organ of leadership--the Provisional
 Central Government--the Chinese soviet movement has achieved unprecedented
 success and growth.  Under the leadership of the Central Government, the
 Workers and Peasants' Red Army throughout the country has continued to score
 unprecedented victories in the revolutionary war by annihilating between
 10 and 20 divisions of the Kuomintang army, expanding the most extensive
 soviet areas, and unfolding a new phase in the national revolutionary war
 all over the country.  The Soviet has become a banner of liberation to the
 toiling masses, the workers and peasants, nation-wide.
 On the occasion of this great anniversary, the imperialist Kuomintang, in
 the course of its fourth "encirclement campaign" against the soviets and
 the Workers and Peasants' Red Army, for which it had concentrated all
 strength in a bid to save its moribund rule, has suffered the most serious
 defeat at the hands of the courageous Red Army, which is fighting on all
 fronts to hasten its collapse and annihilation.   The Soviet Central Government
 calls upon the toiling masses, the workers and peasants, and the Red Army to
 smash thoroughly the fourth encirclement campaign of the imperialist Kuomintang
 and strive for an initial victory in Kiangsi Province through courageous action
 so as to carry out direct war with Japan to commemorate this great anniversary.
 At the same time, the masses are called upon to take part in strengthening
 and leading the revolutionary war and on this anniversary, carry out a re-
 view of the work of the different levels of government.  The Central Executive

 TELEGRAM AGAINST THE REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL INVESTIGATION DELEGATION
 6 October 1932
 [Text]   All Chinese workers, peasants and soldiers and all oppressed masses!
 The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic has long
 since proclaimed to the masses of all China that the League of Nations is a
 bandits' alliance of the imperialist countries to dismember China, and that
 the main purpose for which it has sent Lytton's investigation delegation
 to China is.to plan for the dismemberment of China and the suppression of all
 revolutionary activity under the banner of the Chinese Soviets.
 Now the report of the imperialist bandit alliance's investigation delegation--
 the Lytton Commission--concerning the dismemberment of China has been published.
 It is a tragic whitewash of the dismemberment of China presented to the Chinese
 masses by imperialism--and those traitors who disgrace their country, the
 Kuomintang and their government, entirely agree with and accept it!
 The Lytton Commission report has publicly and quite shamelessly proclaimed
 a new plan for the dismemberment of China:   it openly declares that Japan
 and all the imperialists should not only occupy Manchuria but should dismember
 the whole of China, and it clearly declares that Japanese imperialism's
 occupation of Manchuria and its bloodbath in Shanghai were justified.   It
 calls for all imperialists to unite to dismember China and destroy the Chinese
 revolutionary movement, starting with an even crueller attack upon the country-
 wide national revolutionary war and local revolutionary movements led by the
 Chinese Soviet Government, upon the anti-Japanese war of the Manchurian
 volunteers, and upon anti-Japanese, anti-imperialist and goods boycott move-
 ments.   It shamelessly advocates the status of "autonomous nation" for
 Manchuria, the setting up of an international gendarmerie to make it a base
 for international imperialism's attack upon the Soviet Union, for active
 attack on the Soviet Union.   At the same time, it uses phrases such as
 "suzerainty rests with China" in the hopes of relieving the Chinese masses
 of their anti-imperialist armor and benumbing them. Finally, it repeatedly
 orders the Kuomintang to more actively attack the Red Army, to surrender more
 faithfully to imperialism  and sell out national interests, to strive even
 harder to suppress the anti-imperialist movement and the goods boycott
 movement, and to cruelly butcher the Chinese masses!

 The Lytton Commission's report is a certification of imperialist enslavement
 of the Chinese people.   The Soviet Government calls upon the masses of the
 entire country to arm themselves and, under the leadership of the Soviet
 Government, tear the Lytton report to shreds with a revolutionary national
 war, and to oppose all of the imperialists' new schemes to dismember China,
 to attack the Soviet areas, to suppress the Chinese revolution and to attack
 the Soviet Union!  Drive the Japanese and all imperialists out of China and
 gain complete liberation and independence for the Chinese people!  Protect
 the Soviet Union by force of arms and establish a social alliance between
 China's laboring masses and the Soviet Union.
 The Soviet Government declares to workers, peasants and soldiers throughout
 the country and to all oppressed masses that to truly carry on a national
 revolutionary war and to oppose imperialists dismemberment of China, we must
 begin by overthrowing the scavengers of imperialist dismemberment of China
 and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, which represses the nationalist
 war.   The Kuomintang and its government have, with complete loyalty, accepted
 the imperialists' report on the dismemberment of China, have accepted it as
 a basis for discussion, and all discussions and studies of it by Kuomintang
 factions and the government, as well as verbal expressions of dissatisfaction
 with certain points in the report are without exception a smokescreen to cover
 up their betrayal of China and a trick to deceive the masses.  The Kuomintang
 is willing to give the Three Eastern Provinces, Shanghair, and the rest of
 China to the imperialists and mobilize a hugL? army, with the direction and
 help of the imperialists, to attack the worker and peasant army which is truly
 leading the revolutionary masses of the entire country in a revolutionary
 nationalist war, hoping in this way to destroy the Soviet Government of the
 true anti-imperialist masses and prevent the Red Army and the heroic anti-
 imperialist fighters and volunteers from standing together to make war
 directly upon the imperialists.  At the same time, it assists the imperialists
 by slaughtering and betraying the Manchurian volunteers, repressing the
 nationwide  anti-imperialist movement, restraining the goods boycott movement
 and the workers' strikes, and slaughtering the workers and peasants and the
 laboring masses in order to prove its loyalty to imperialism.   Only by
 overthrowing the Kuomintang rule which has sold out our national interests
 can we prosecute the national revolutionary war in a workable manner.   The
 Soviet Government is now leading the Worker and Peasant Red Army of the
 entire nation and the broad range of laboring masses in the Soviet zones in
 a bitter war against the imperialist Kuomintang to victoriously smash the
 Kuomintang's fourth campaign and is destroying the reactionary rule of the
 Kuomintang with revolutionary war!  Masses of the entire nation, arm  yourselves!
 Oppose the Kuomintang's fourth campaign on the Soviet zones, overthrow the
 rule of the Kuomintang, the lackeys of imperialism, and support the Red Army
 and Soviet power!   Only the Soviet Government can truly lead a nationwide
 revolutionary war, fight directly against Japan and oppose the imperialists'
 dismemberment of China!  Only the Worker and Peasant Red Army is truly arming
 the masses for a nationalist war!  Fighters of the Worker and Peasant Red Army
 throughout the country, and laboring worker-peasant masses in the Soviet zones!
 Actively carry on revolutionary war against the imperialist Kuomintang and
 resolutely attack and smash the fourth "encirclement and suppression campaigns!"

 ON EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION FOR WAR
 Order No 12 of Central Executive Committee
 13 October 1932
 [Text]   The revolution is becoming daily more intense throughout the country,
 and the Soviets and the Red Army in particular have won unprecedentedly great
 victories and more unprecedented progress throughout the country, so that
 the imperialist Kuomintang's fourth encirclement campaign in O-Hsiang-Yuan,
 Hsiang-o-hsi, Hsiang-tung-pei and Hsiang-o-chiang has met with crushing defeat
 after defeat.  Most notably, the Red Army in the Central District rolled
 victoriously northward, and as a result the Kuomintang warlords, under the
 strict supervision of the imperialists, are now devoting their full strength
 to deployments for a large-scale attack against the Central District, and
 intensifying their attacks on Kau-tung-pei, Hsiang-ok-kan and Ho-hsi; this
 is because in view of the revolution's victories and the reactionary ruling
 class is planning to put all its strength into a final effort which represents
 a critical point of decisive struggle between revolution and counterrevolution.
 This class war will be more intense and graver than any previous war and
 accordingly we must mobilize all our workers. and peasants and laboring masses
 to arm themselves and quickly become a powerful Red Army force, and to prepare
 with all their strength, all their economic resources and all their sacrifice
 for a war to smash the enemy's large-scale campaign in the course of the
 victory in this.war, we shall take the urban centers of Chi, Hsiang, Fu, and
 Nan, and realize our initial victory in Kiangsi and the several neighboring
 provinces.   In order to lead the worker-peasant masses and armed organizations
 of the entire country in smashing the imperialist Kuomintang's all-out attack
 on the central region the fourth encirclement campaign throughout the country,
 the Central Government is carrying out an emergency general wartime mobiliza-
 tion, in particular with reference to the Worker and Peasant Red Army units
 and all worker-peasant laboring masses in Soviet areas throughout the country,
 to carry out a resolute attack, with the most positive and rapid action and
 the broadest and most thorough military mobilization, in order to guarantee
 the complete success of this war.  Accordingly, governments at all levels,
 all Red Army units, and all military districts must resolutely and rapidly
 carry out the following mobilization work:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100020001-5
 1.   Urgently mobilize all worker-peasant laboring masses to struggle
 energetically for victory with the most positive revolutionary enthusiasm and
 practical activity; to this end, the governments at all levels shall carry
 out a thorough political mobilization of the worker-peasant masses in all
 Soviet areas so that every worker-peasant element understands the significance
 of this campaign for his own future and that it is a decisive movement for
 the country-wide victory of the Soviets, and recognizes that the fundamental
 conditions for the victory of our class war are the swelling of the struggle
 against counterrevolution by all revolutionary forces in the country, so as
 to stimulate the worker-peasant masses' fighting enthusiasm and class
 determination and make them actively prepare for and participate in all
 practical work of the campaign, in the front lines and the rear areas, and
 struggle to smash the enemy's large-scale attack.   Accordingly:
 (a)  All personnel of the provincial and Soviet area governments are to go
 immediately to the lower levels and convene assemblies there, in particular
 the urban and rural representative assemblies and electoral assemblies to
 undertake political mobilization, so that all working personnel and all worker
 and peasant comrades will understand the significance of this war, and will
 all be mobilized to take part in all mobilization activities of the war.
 (b)  In all Red Army units, their highest leadership organs shall convene
 soldiers' meetings in accordance with their particular situation, to carry out
 a general mobilization of all fighters.
 (c)  In all local armed associations, the military district military departments,
 and those at all other levels, shall hold meetings of their Red Guards,,
 guerrillas, and Young Pioneers groups.
 (d)  All mass groups shall, under this general mobilization order, respectively
 hold plenary meetings and make agitation reports.
 2.  All Red Army units shall, in accordance with established policy and mounting
 the most positive and adroit attacks, first defeat the enemy's attacks and
 smash the enemy's all-out attack with victorious attacks of their own, so as
 to seize control of urban centers and realize the initial victory in Kiangsi;
 in particular, the Red Army units throughout the country must act in coordination.
 3.   An intensive expansion of the Red Army strengthens the main force of the
 revolutionary war, and this is a main condition for smashing the enemy's all-
 out assault.   In October, governments at all levels must, with the greatest
 energy and rapidity, mobilize the broadest range of worker and peasant activist
 elements to swell the Red Army's numbers and improve its quality.   They must
 resolutely carry out the Central Committee's Directive No 15 and must also
 more than double the prescribed numbers, and thereafter must continually carry
 on activities to expand the Red Army, constantly replenishing the front lines
 on a large-scale and setting up regular Red Army reserve units.   In addition,
 governments at all levels are charged with mobilizing and urging soldiers who
 have been demobilized and have returned home to all return to their units
 during October, and with initiating an extremely broad return-to-the-units
 movement among the masses.

 4.   Persevere in carrying out Directive No 15 and quickly mobilize all able-
 bodied men between 18 and 40 years of age in all Soviet areas to volunteer
 to join the Red Guards, each man must provide himself with a weapon, prepare
 sights for local weapons and artillery and ready a sufficient supply of
 ammunition (in addition, the Young Pioneers must be set up extensively);
 they must be organized and set up as units in accordance with regulations;
 this work must be completed before the revolutionary holiday in October.
 Political education and combat training must be especially intensified.
 Governments at all levels, and all military districts and all military
 departments, must painstakingly undertake the implementation of this
 Directive so that the Red Guards will truly be able to shoulder the task of
 protecting their localities and coordinating with the Red Army in destroying
 and striking back at the attacking enemy; model camps and model Young Pioneers
 groups must be ready at all times to move out and to assemble for combat.
 5.   Set up powerful guerrilla units.  All existing guerrilla units must be
 subjected to strict investigation and bad elements among their personnel must
 immediately be purged and guerrilla units' leadership must be strengthened or
 replaced.  During October each guerrilla unit must take a week's training
 in rotation and strengthen its political and military education, so that
 every member of the unit knows the work and missions he is charged with.
 Each country must have at least one or two crack guerrilla units to go into
 neighboring White areas and the enemy's rear and carry on the broadest kind
 of guerrilla war, whipping up mass struggle and extending the Soviet areas;
 they will be the Soviet areas' armed organizers and propagandizers.  They
 will become an extremely critical force in the revolutionary war, able to
 coordinate with the Red Army in applying pressure and attacking the enemy;
 they will resolutely erase all serious phenomena of guerrilla units.  Each
 county must have them thoroughly organized and put in order during October
 so that they can all go into action according to the directives and missions
 which have been planned by the Military Service Committee.
 6.   In order to facilitate the destruction of the enemy and to win the initial
 victory in Kiangsi, we must actively develop the surrounding Soviet areas, in
 particular those in the north and east, as well as those in the northeast.
 This is a critical prerequisite for winning a victory and for realizing the
 initial victory in Kiangsi.   Governments at all levels and armed units in
 all localities must immediately mobilize personnel to go to these fronts and
 develop the Soviet areas to win over the broad worker-peasant masses,  to
 create an even more extensive Soviet area, to surround every urban center and
 the environs of any urban center that serve the enemy as a strong point; to
 establish close relationships with Northeast Kiangsi and Ho-hsi, and with
 more thorough planning, to go and carry on work among the soldiers of the
 White armies surrounding the Soviet areas, so as to shatter the enemy's
 armies, win over the revolutionary masses of the soldiers, and set up activities
 in the neighboring urban centers.   All provincial and county governments
 must, in October, transfer large numbers of cadres to these new areas in
 order to establish political power and carry out the land revolution, so as
 to carry on work in the White areas and with the White army soldiers, and
 at the same time, must deepen the class struggle in all the border areas,
 consolidate and expand them.

 7.  We must immediately collect the land tax, the business tax and the house
 rents so as to develop our financial resources, and must thoroughly ready
 our economic and food resources for warfare, along with all military
 necessities, and prepare for a protracted struggle with the enemy, so that
 Red Army and all worker-peasant masses will not be troubled by being
 bottled up by the enemy and short on provisions; even more, we must continue
 to save on expenses and food, in order to make ample war preparations.  This
 is of critical importance to our victory or defeat in the decisive war.
 8.  Mobilize all worker-peasant masses to store food and salt and to cut
 waste of food, to make an effort in the growing of miscellaneous grains and
 vegetables and to prepare to supply the Red Army during wartime.  The
 enthusiasm for revolutionary war and support for the Red' Army of the worker-
 peasant masses in all the soviet areas should be encouraged politically, and
 preparation and storage of economic resources and food should be thoroughly
 carried out, in order to gain victory in war and to be prepared at any time
 to lend or contribute to the Red Army.
 9.  We must persist in destroying the advancing enemy so that our soviet areas
 will not be overrun.   If the enemy is able to enter and harass soviet areas,
 we must persevere in leading the worker-peasant masses and arming them in
 hitting the enemy and destroying him.  We must cut off his food supplies and
 communications, harass him day and night, strengthen our bulwarks and leave
 nothing outside them, so that the enemy cannot continue for a moment in the
 Soviet areas.   All local governments must lead the local armed organizations
 and worker-peasant masses in active execution of all kinds of preparations,
 making use of our experience of the past three campaigns, so that we will
 attain a more thorough.and effective achievement and will be victorious.
 10. All Soviet areas must institute the strictest sort of Red martial law,
 and all sentries shall be the responsibility of the Red Guards.  They must
 be set up within 10 days so as to stringently guard against penetration by
 enemy reconnaissance, and must scrupulously check all travelers and all
 materials brought with them.  Any suspicious cases must be brought to the
 government organs for thorough investigation.   The governments at all levels
 shall issue travel permits only after detailed investigation and certification.
 They must not issue them carelessly.   The previous practice of stamping a mark
 on the hand is to be abandoned.  All mass organizations must obtain travel
 passes from the government, and only the government and military organs of
 the government can issue them.   Travel permits for travel through the white
 areas must be issued by the county or district governments.  A house-to-house
 check of all Soviet areas must immediately be carried out, and in particular
 all suspicious elements in the urban areas must be subjected to intensive
 investigation and surveillance.   For this work, government at all levels shall
 have the particupation and assistance of the labor unions, Young Pioneers and
 all mass organizations.
 11. Intensify the purge of counterrevolutionaries.   The National Security
 Office is charged with instructing its branch units at all levels to make
 painstaking plans to carry out this work, and at the same time government at
 all levels must deal severely with all counterrevolutionary activities, in
 particular the counties of Shih Ch'eng  [4258 1004], Ning-tu [1337 6757],
 Kuang-ch'ang [1639 2490], I-huang [1355 7806], Ning-hua [1337 0553], Hui-ch'ang

 Hsin-feng [0207 0023], and Lung-yen [7893 1484].  We must quickly and
 thoroughly wipe out the power of the evil gentry and landlords and lead the
 worker-peasant masses to carry out surveillance activities against all
 landlords, rich peasants and all suspected counterrevolutionaries.  In the
 combat zones these elements must be arrested.  In order to set up a more
 consolidated rear area we must thoroughly purge all counterrevolutionary
 factions and suppress all counterrevolutionary activities.
 12. We must actively revamp our main communication lines to make them more
 conducive to military transport and troop movements.  We must institute
 strong logistics depot activities and logistics depot transportation, and
 all governmental units within 30 li of the depots in either direction will
 be charged with transport and protection reponsibility.   The Red Guards along
 the line shall become armed units for protection and escort.  As to means
 of transportation, we shall change the past designation of the various
 organizations and unite them under the Red Guards.  We have resolved that
 every member of Red Guard unit shall have a weapon and a carrying pole; one
 stretcher for every five men so that if combat occurs they may all attack
 the enemy with weapons and if the front lines or logistics depots need
 stretcher bearers or transportation teams, all Red Guards can become
 transportation teams or stretcher bearers; only with such a rapid mobiliza-
 tion can we adapt to the intense needs of combat.
 13. The relevant government units shall mobilize the broad masses during
 October to completely pull down all works built by the enemy in the soviet
 areas during the three campaigns and not yet destroyed, and the city walls
 of all cities.
 14. During wartime, government at all levels must persevere in leading the
 masses and the armed units in resolutely doing battle with the enemy, and if
 there are those who are faint-hearted and flee and do not persistenly lead
 the masses in combat, they must be dealt with according to military discipline.
 In addition, in order to intensify the combat leadership strength of the
 various governments, all the working personnel of the various governments
 shall receive military training, and the district and township government
 personnel shall participate in the Red Guards with leadership responsibility;
 at the province and county levels they must, in coordination with the working
 ?     personnel of the various organs and organizations at the same level, set up
 a Red Guards organization to regularly carry out military training, so
 that all life and activity shall be militarized.   This will more practically
 strengthen the leadership of the governments at various levels over the
 combat activities of the local armed units.
 The situation of the war is becoming daily more urgent, and we must use our
 full strength in mobilizing the worker-peasant masses of all soviet areas,
 and must, with the greatest rapidity, thoroughly prepare for all combat
 activities and prepare to make every sacrifice to gain a military victory,
 subordinating all activities to the war.   This time, victory will assuredly
 belong to us.   It is so ordered.

 ON THE SECOND ISSUE OF REVOLUTIONARY WAR BONDS
 Directive No 17 of Central Executive Committee
 21 October 1932
 [Text]   Because the revolution is developing particularly because of the
 victorious development of the Soviets and the Red Army, the enemy is now
 devoting his entire energy to an intensified deployment for a large-scale
 assault against the Central District.  In addition to issuing an order for
 emergency wartime mobilization in order to lead the worker-peasant masses
 of all Soviet areas in thoroughly smashing the enemy's large-scale attack
 and realizing the initial victory in Kiangsi, the Central Government, in
 order to facilitate the thorough guaranteeing of a complete victory in this
 war and thorough preparation of economic resources for war, and in particular
 to mobilize all worker-peasant masses to complete this preparation more
 quickly, is taking the step of issuing a second series of revolutionary war
 bonds in the amount of 1,200,000 yuan, for the specific purpose of meeting
 the costs of the war.  On receipt of this directive, governments at all
 levels must, on the basis of previous experience, immediately discuss the
 method of selling them and put it into practice within a short time.  For this

 be used. But rich peasants and large and middle merchants can be designated
 in advance, and ordered to buy them.
 (b)  The areas, cities and hsiang should convene the township representatives
 assemblies to make a report and discussion.  As to the methods of sale and of
 encouraging the masses, the urban and rural governments and representatives
 should convene mass meeting, of the electorate and report on the significance
 of the government's bond issue and the duties of citizens.   It is important
 that they should agitate them politically about participating in the
 revolutionary war so that the masses will take the initiative in buying them.
 (c)  Use of revolutionary emulation.   County will compete with county
 district with district, township with township, village with village, and
 group with group, and the one that sells the most the quickest wins.  The
 government at the next higher level should award a pennant and a prize.

 (d)   It shall be the responsibility of the village or city representative
 and the urban and rural governments to turn over the collected funds to the
 higher level.
 (e)   Governments at all levels shall, in accordance. with the above,
 determine the concrete methods of implementation, i.e., methods of distribution,
 agitation, and collection.   To sum up, the bond issue can be completely carried
 out according to the above regulations, but it depends most importantly upon how
 we decide upon our work of mobilizing and agitating the masses; whoever can
 actively mobilize the masses will be able to accomplish his mission.  We must
 stringently correct the past erroneous procedures of not mobilizing the
 masses and relying exclusively on orders.  The second bond issue is entirely
 for the needs of the war to thoroughly smash the enemy's large-scale attack.
 After the autumn harvest, the worker-peasant laboring masses and the
 inhabitants are economically more active, and following the first bond issue
 in particular the credit of the bond certificates had an easier time gaining
 the support of the masses.   So, governments at all levels should, on the basis
 of past experience, make a great effort to agitate the masses, and resolutely
 correct the past erroneous method of giving orders and designating people
 without going through any propaganda and agitation.   Each locality must at all
 costs sell the bonds on time and deliver the receipts by the deadline, in
 order to fulfil their revolutionary task.  If half-hearted workers and
 sabotours are discovered again as they were last time, they shall be punished
 according to revolutionary discipline.
 This is most expressly ordered!

 ORGANIZE LABOR TEAMS WITH RICH PEASANTS
 Order No 35
 25 November 1932
 [Text]  At this period of tension in the revolutionary war, pressing tasks
 are many in order to lessen the burden of the combat tasks of the worker-
 peasant masses, we have decided to organize the rich peasants into work
 teams under. the surveillance of the Red Guard to take on various types of
 labor service in the Soviet areas,  such as tearing down city walls and
 works, repairing roads and internal transportation; these labor teams are
 to be made up out by compulsory levy of rich peasants.  Overall treatment
 of them shall also differ from ordinary teams, as follows:
 1.   The various local governments must form all rich peasants able to work
 into labor teams, and at work time dispatch the Red Guards to oversee them
 (one Red Guard overseer per 5 workers).   They must be sent immediately to
 tear down the city walls and earthworks and destroy the works which were
 previously put up in the Soviet areas by the enemy, and to repair the roads
 and bridges.  Within the Soviet areas, the transportation along logistics
 depot routes and part of the moving of heavy objects shall be assigned to
 them.
 2.   As to the support of the labor teams, they must provide their own
 utensils and food, but if they are engaged in transportation work on trips
 lasting more than 2 days, the government may provide them with rice, but
 they themselves must carry money for vegetables.   It is imperative that
 each government unit shall immediately implement the above resolutions.
 It is so ordered.

 CULTIVATE MORE GRAIN AND PROHIBIT OPIUM CULTIVATION--NOTICE NO 13 OF
 PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
 [Text] At present, in order to continue the victorious pursuit of the
 revolutionary war and the protracted struggle,  so as to thoroughly smash
 the enemy's large-scale offensive, and to win even greater victories, we
 need to make thorough preparations in which food is particularly critical,
 not only affecting the provisioning of the Red Army but also directly
 influencing the daily life of the worker-peasant masses.  Accordingly,
 the Provisional Central Government,  in order to bolster the food supply
 and to keep the broad worker-peasant masses and Red Army in the Soviets
 from suffering any hardship with respect to food, has made the following
 decisions:
 1.   Plant more miscellaneous grain and vegetables; now is the time for
 planting miscellaneous grains, and the worker-peasant masses in all localities
 should do their utmost to plant miscellaneous grains and vegetables to make
 up cereal shortages.
 2.   Forbid the cultivation of opium.   Opium is a most pernicious poison, and
 a tool used by the evil gentry and landlords to benumb the workers and
 peasants.   In our Soviet areas we must absolutely forbid it.   Furthermore,
 since the cultivation hinders the cultivation of miscellaneous grains and
 the next year's spring planting and so decreases the source of grain and
 harms the revolutionary war, in all our Soviet areas this year we absolutely
 forbid further cultivation of opium.   It must be replaced by miscellaneous
 grains.
 The above decision is entirely in the interest of the revolutionary war and
 of the worker-peasant masses.   It must be strictly followed by everyone.
 Recently we have heard that rich peasants are subverting from within,
 intentionally inciting the masses to plant opium, to decrease the food
 production in the Soviet areas and bring about grevious harm to the worker-
 peasant masses.   This is indeed intentional subversion of the revolution,
 and accordingly is absolutely prohibited by the Soviet areas.   All local

 governments and all revolutionary bodies and all the worker-peasant masses
 must painstakingly investigate peasants who encourage the masses to grow
 opium; rich peasants who intentionally subvert the revolution must be
 strictly investigated and given harsh punishment.  This is most earnestly
 communicated, and it is expected that governments at all levels, all mass
 organizations and all the worker-peasant masses will be informed of it
 and will obey it implicitly.   It is so required.

 ON MOBILIZATION FOR WAR AND THE STYLE OF WORK--URGENT RESOLUTION OF
 CENTRAL PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE
 [Text]   The results of a recent investigation of the implementation of the
 emergency mobilization in the various localities have been quite unsatisfactory.
 Beyond the brief comments made by the War Service Committee in a letter
 addressed to the localities, the People's Committee points out more gravely
 that the primary factor in this state of affairs is errors in political
 understanding:
 1.   The gravity of the enemy's large-scale assault has in general been taken
 too lightly, this reflects the extremely backward peace-at-any-price attitude
 among the masses which holds that while the enemy is not here it is business
 as usual, and which naturally makes them unable to carry out urgent tasks.
 2.   In the border areas which have been subject to enemy invasion and
 harassment, there has been panic and disorganization.   This results from
 failing to understand the current situation, which is favorable to revolution,
 a lack of confidence in the revolution, and defeatist mood, and it hinders
 the carrying out of mobilization work.
 3.   There is incorrect understanding of the attack policy; people consider
 it to be solely the task of the Red Army, while they themselves sit by
 and hope for a Red Army victory.   In the border regions there is even more
 an attitude of depending on the Red Army and taking no active measures
 oneself to attack the enemy outside.  With this idea of waiting, it is
 impossible to carry out a policy of attack from all sides, and it results
 in the complete neglect of all emergency mobilization work.
 The People's Committee calls upon governments at all levels and the local
 military leadership organs to carry on a resolute and ruthless struggle
 against these political errors, to oppose all under-rating of the enemy's
 large-scale offensive and particularly the backward consciousness of peace-
 at-any-price that considers that the enemy is still far off, to resolutely
 oppose panic and disorganization in the face of enemy assaults and the
 conservative idea of waiting, for these things are the most dangerous to
 the implementation of the emergency mobilization to smash the enemy's
 large-scale attacks.

 The People's Committee gravely calls upon governments at all levels and
 the local military leadership organs to arrive at a profound understanding
 of the enemy's current active building of motor roads, organization of
 military outposts and transport, organization and expansion of armed
 landlords, development of anti-communist groups and communist eradication
 militia all around the Soviet areas, enforced collection of large sums for
 the army,  and transfers of large numbers of troops.  Of particular
 importance, he has stepped up his attacks on Kan-Tung-Pei, Hsiang-o-Kan,
 and the Hsiang-Kan Soviet area.; this is an indication of the enemy's ever
 more thorough deployment of his large-scale attack on the central Soviet
 and his preparations for a protracted effort.  We must reach a profound
 understanding that this attack to smash the enemy's large-scale assault
 will be a prolonged, hard and bitter struggle, a critical juncture in the
 class struggle.   We must devote all our strength to the struggle for
 victory in this war.
 We must also point out that although this enemy attack has the direct
 assistance of imperialism and has increased its armed strength, politically
 and internally they are much weaker than in the third campaign, and the
 troops with which the enemy is attacking the Soviet areas are ripe with
 disaffection and indecisiveness.   The development of the nationwide
 revolution and the concurrent expansion and growth in strength of the
 Soviet Red Army are conditions especially beneficial to us; if we can
 mobilize all our forces to make sacrifices for the war we can win a
 complete victory and realize our initial victory in Kiangsi.
 In investigating mobilization work we discovered another grave state of
 affairs, namely a failure to mobilize the masses politically or move them
 organizationally, adopting instead a work style which is divorced from the
 masses and involves coercing them and ordering them around.   Furthermore
 the development of this work style is closely connected with the above-
 mentioned political errors:
 1.   Having failed to understand the gravity of the enemy's large-scale
 assault, they naturally cannot understand the importance of mobilizing
 the whole range of the worker-peasant masses,  and they do not proceed to
 the broad mobilization work on a foundation of mass mobilization.
 2.   Leadership organs at all levels, in dealing with subordinate officials,
 adopt a leadership style of simply issuing an order or sending down a
 resolution or a plan, with no indication or investigation of any of the,
 concrete methods of carrying it out, or of the methods of mobilizing the
 masses.   On occasion, they even simply order that it be done, perhaps making
 use of threats or punishments.   This in turn causes the subordinates to
 coerce the masses even more, and cases of ordering the masses around are
 appearing everywhere.

 3.   If people have a. haphazard and disorganized work style and do not make
 use of mass meetings of the electorate, representative assemblies, and all
 the various mass groups to mobilize the masses and strengthen mobilization
 of the masses, they will inevitably end up coercing the masses and ordering
 them around.
 4.   Because people have a bureaucratic work style, they are inevitably
 unable to take pains with the mobilization of the masses, but in an effort
 to find the easy way they resort to coercion and issuing orders instead.
 These phenomena have appeared quite frequently in the emergency mobilization.
 It is quite clear that in responding to the Central Government's emergency
 mobilization order, they have not convened congresses of the electorate,
 representative assemblies, and mass meetings of the Red Guards and the
 Young Pioneers and the various mass groups to make detailed reports and
 explanations and carry out thorough political agitation efforts; even now
 a majority of the masses do not understand about the enemy's large-scale
 assault, which naturally means that all the mobilization work is unable to
 stand on a foundation of mass activism and achieve full realization.   In
 expanding the Red Army, for example, we will not be able to fulfill the
 prescribed plans, will not be able to induce able-bodied man and women of
 the worker-peasant masses eagerly and spontaneously to join the Red Guards
 and the Young Pioneers, but rather will resort to threat of punishment to
 compel them to go to the drill field.   Of particular importance,  in collecting
 the land tax and in issuing bonds, we did not do thorough political
 propagandizing in advance, to assure that all worker-peasant elements under-
 stood why they should pay the land tax and buy bonds.  When we were collecting
 the tax and issuing the bonds we also failed to convene the various kinds of
 meetings and make use of the urban and rural representative assemblies to
 agitate the masses,  so that they would pay the tax and buy large numbers of
 bonds of their own accord; and when doubts arose among the masses we did not
 give them detailed explanations, but rather resorted to compelling the rich
 pea.sa.nts and capitalists, and then extended it to the worker-peasant masses.
 This brought about a grave situation of being divorced from the masses, and
 it actually increased the difficulties of collecting the land tax and issuing
 the bonds.   This in turn affected all other aspects of the mobilization work.
 This is a. grave problem indeed.
 In this practice of coercing people and ordering them around has not only
 appeared in the emergency mobilization but is also common in all types of
 work in the Soviets.   This kind of work style has been fostered by the fact
 that the various leadership organs have,  in their leadership, fallen into
 ?     a grave kind of bureaucra.tism, and in their acceptance and implementation
 of orders from their superiors, they either pass them along routinely or
 even unopened,  and do not call a meeting to discuss concrete methods of
 implementing them in accordance with the local situation,  so as to direct
 their subordinates' work.   As to the results of their implementation, they
 never investigate them or a.sk how they have turned out, but simply try to
 let things drift.   All of their execution of orders depends simply upon

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 giving orders,  and all work at all times is simply done routinely with the
 holding of routine meetings.   This is out-and-out bureaucratism.
 Burea.ucratism alienates the masses and destroys the connection between the
 Soviets and the masses.   It does the greatest harm to the cause of the
 Soviet's victory and progress.   Doing work in a perfunctory way, using
 coercion and commands,  is an important expression of bureaucratism, and
 it absolutely must not be allowed to exist in the Soviet government.   Such
 bureaucratism has crept into the Soviet governments:
 1.   By infection of China's semi-feudal society and Kuomintang bureaucratism.
 2.   Because the peasants are trapped in disorganization and lack the
 organization and discipline of the proletariat.
 3.   Because there is a lack of the spirit of hard struggle and people simply
 try to devise short-term solutions so that bureaucratism creeps into the
 Soviet organs and expands daily.
 The People's Committee calls upon Soviet organs at all levels and the broad
 masses of workers and peasants to wage a determined struggle in common
 against bureaucratism and to expunge it from the Soviet organs, driving
 out all incorrigible decadent bureaucratic elements so as to consolidate
 the power of the worker-peasant Soviets and also create a new work style
 in the Soviets.   To this end, they must:
 1.   Build in all their work upon mobilization of the masses, for anyone who
 neglects mass mobilization work becomes divorced from the masses.
 2.   In carrying out decrees and resolutions, do not simply resort to commands,
 but rely heavily upon a raising of the masses' class consciousness and
 enthusiasm to support the carrying out of decrees.
 3.   In mobilizing the masses, make use of thorough political propaganda and
 agitation work.
 4.   In mobilizing the masses, utilize all organizations in the Soviets and
 all mass groups to mobilize .the masses; the urban and rural representative
 assemblies and mass meetings of the electorate are tools for direct mobiliza-
 tion of the masses,  and the labor unions are the cornerstone of mass
 mobilization.
 5.   In carrying out every decision,  adhere to practical possibilities, opposing
 every impractical and non-concrete resolution as well as all unprepared and
 fruitless routine meetings.
 6.   In carrying out orders, give full attention to the methods of mobilizing
 the masses and also to the opinions of the masses as reference material in
 determining methods of carrying them out.

 7.   When receiving an order or a resolution from superiors, immediately hold
 a meeting and conduct a detailed discussion to determine the concrete methods
 for carrying it out.
 8.   In carrying out orders, constantly investigate the work to see whether
 it is successful or not and see whether there are any errors or unsound parts.
 9.   In all work, divide up labor in a way consonant with the conditions of
 the work, not only among the departments and the working comrades, but also
 in directing subordinates.
 10.  In directing subordinates, be practical and concrete and issue workable
 instructions liberally.
 11.   Refrain from constantly issuing documents, but make inspection tours
 and give guidance.  These tours should not be junkets, and they should not
 stand on the sidelines and criticize, but should responsibly investigate
 the work and help subordinates in resolving work difficulties.
 12.   Organize working groups to give direct assistance to the subordinates.
 The responsibility of the working groups is to get the work done well where
 they are, not to engage in idle criticism of others and do no work themselves.
 The work style of the-working groups should be to concentrate forces and do
 the work well at one place before proceeding to another.  They should divide
 up the labor so that each person does one part, and they should do their
 work well in every place they go to.
 13.   Refrain from holding disorganized meetings.   Meetings should be prepared
 for,  should have results,  and should be conducted in a practical way.
 14.   In holding mass meetings, make thorough preparations in advance.   All
 political agitation should conform to the demands of the masses and be
 connected with the masses' own interests.   Speeches should be simple and
 clear and effective as agitation.
 The work style of the Soviets should have a mass nature, be practical,
 organized, disciplined and characterized by a firm determination for bitter
 struggle; all approaches divorced from the masses are bureaucratic work style.
 The People's Committee calls upon Soviet organs at all levels to mobilize
 urgently and oppose all erroneous understanding and slack behavior relative
 to the enemy's large-scale assault, to eradicate bureaucratism in the Soviet
 organs, and to struggle to create a Soviet working style and quickly complete
 all work under the emergency mobilization order.

 ON INVESTIGATION OF ELECTION MOVEMENTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS--RESOLUTION OF
 CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 [Text] It is almost 2 months since the Central Government proclaimed on
 20 September that the governments at the various levels should individually
 carry out replacement elections for the governments,  in accordance with
 election regulations.   On investigating the results of these elections,  it
 appears:
 1.   That not a single county has completed.the elections in accordance with
 Directive No 16.
 2.   That the election movements at all levels have been peaceful and the
 masses have not been mobilized through struggle to participate in the
 elections.
 3.   The election movement has been entirely separated from the urgent tasks
 of the current war, and either all war mobilization work has been neglected
 because of the election or the elections have been put off on account of
 the press of mobilization work.   (Wan-t'ai [8001 3141],  for instance, had
 to hold the elections after the issue of bonds.)
 4.   Election regulations were not adhered to, the electing was not done by
 the electorate, the designation of representatives was done perfunctorily,
 and alien or newly reformed elements were even selected as representatives.
 (For example the Hui-ch'ang [2585 2490] county congress.)
 5.   At the provincial and county levels, the election movement showed signs
 of perfunctoriness and passivity.
 On the basis of the above circumstances, this election has achieved nothing,
 which clearly indicates that the governments at the various levels have not
 understood politically that the replacement elections and the reinforcing of
 the local Soviet governments are a basic foundation for leading the worker-
 peasant masses in smashing the enemy's large-scale attack.   It also reveals
 starkly the bureaucratism in the implementation of the directive by Soviets
 at all  levels.

 The Central Executive Committee believes that reinforcing the local Soviet
 governments will create a powerful lever in the current effort to lead the
 worker-peasant masses in thoroughly smashing the enemy's large-scale attack.
 Furthermore, if we examine the past three campaigns, there were alien
 elements concealed in the Soviet organs which led to countercurrents and
 other grave occurrences, and accordingly we have decided to carry out a
 strict investigation of this election movement.   In all cases which fail
 according to the following conditions, they will be declared invalid and
 new elections will have to be held.
 1.   Elections where the broad mass of the electorate has not been mobilized
 to hold mass electoral meetings.
 2.   When those elected have not been elected with the agreement and support
 of the majority of the electorate.   (As recently in several locations where
 a list of names has been presented or even promulgated by the higher levels
 and presented to the electoral meetings.   This is a form of monopolizing
 the proceedings which is at variance with the electoral spirit.)
 3.   When those elected are 'not resolute revolutionaries and active workers
 from among the worker-peasant masses.   (Those who go AWOL, who join all
 kinds of activities in peacetime but are not active [in wartime].)
 As for the new elections and the regulations in Directive No 16, those
 places which were to have held replacement elections and.have not held them
 must immediately hold them, and this replacement election movement should
 in particular be made into an extensive movement of the leadership organs
 to mobilize the masses in order to implement the emergency war mobilization
 and to resolutely smash the enemy's large-scale attack.   Accordingly,  in
 the election the following work should be done:
 1.    In rural and urban elections extensive political mobilization work
 should be done among the masses,  including:
 (a)   Calling upon the masses all to actively come and participate in
 the election movement and set up a powerful government which can truly
 carry out all decrees in order to secure the thorough realization of the
 labor law and the land law.
 (b)   Make the worker-peasant masses understand that the Soviet government
 is their government and if bad men are elected to do the work they will not
 be able to consider everybody's interests.
 (c)   The right to vote is a right of the workers and peasants and those
 who have it can obtain a great deal of power; the right to vote has been
 seized from the rich peasants,  landlords and capitalists,  so that the
 landlords have received no land, the rich peasants have received bad land,
 the capitalists hold no positions, and accordingly everyone should not give
 up their power.

 2.   The political mobilization should be begun by an announcement to the
 masses in every village and on every street that the labor unions and poor
 peasants' associations and all groups should come to a meeting to discuss
 election questions,  so that all the masses will know that a replacement
 election is being held in that town or township, will all understand the
 importance of the election; and so that when the time comes everybody will
 go vote of their own accord.
 3.   Investigation of voting rights should be used to mobilize the masses
 to struggle against hidden rich peasants and all alien elements and
 participate actively in the election.
 4.   At election time, the election should not only be carried out according
 to the procedures defined in the detailed election regulations, by means of
 investigation work, particularly regarding all decrees and regarding the
 protection of the interests of the worker-peasant masses, the masses should
 be mobilized to criticize the work of their past representatives and govern-
 ment, to oppose bureaucratism, and to seriously support those they want
 elected.
 5.   The election movement and the mass election meetings should be used to
 report on and discuss the Center's emergency mobilization order, to stimulate
 mass activism, and to carry on the war mobilization.
 6.   As regards [23 characters deleted], the masses should be led to an
 understanding that the enemy's large-scale attack is to oppose the Soviets
 and to recover the landlords' and capitalists' power to oppress the workers
 and peasants; the political consciousness of the masses and their determina-
 tion to struggle against the enemy should be raised,  so that they will
 resolutely struggle to the end to preserve the interests of the land
 revolution and support Soviet power.
 7.   The holding of congresses at the district and county levels should be
 based on a successful carrying out of urban and rural electoral movements,
 and in the district and county congresses all formalism should be stamped
 out, and investigation of past work and discussing the carrying out of the
 emergency war mobilization and of all decrees should be made part of the
 meeting.   The items for resolution should not be long, but should be
 practical and concrete.
 8.   The election of committees should not be carried out in a haphazard
 way.   Many workers, farm laborers and toilers, and women and poor and
 middle peasant cadres should be elected.   Furthermore, a purely formal
 treatment of class membership should be corrected, and no attention should
 be given to the further consideration of work capacity or mass beliefs in
 the matter of class membership.

 9.   After the district and county elections,  strict investigation should be
 made of class memberships and occupation of all other working personnel.
 Alien and shiftless elements should immediately be replaced.
 The Center enjoins the province and county governments to carry out the
 above resolutions strictly.   All inspection personnel and work groups have
 the responsibility for investigating all local election movements; they
 should treat the election movement and the reinforcement of local Soviets
 as an inseparable aspect of the emergency mobilization order.

 IN COMMEMORATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE CANTON AND NING-TU RIOTS--
 ORDER NO 36 OF CENTRAL PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE
 [ Text] The 11th of December will be the fifth anniversary of the Canton riots,
 which opened a new stage in the Soviet revolutionary movement -- that of the
 first Chinese Soviet.   The 14th is the anniversary of the Ning-tu  [1337 675]
 riots, China's first solders' riots.  They shook the reactionary rule of the
 imperialist Kuomintang, and even more importantly, hastened the collaspe of
 the Kuomintang warlords, and launched new Soviet victories.   Because that day
 is close to the anniversary of the Canton riots, the People's Committee has
 decided that 11 December will be a holiday and the anniversary of the Ning-tu
 riots will be commemorated along with the Canton riots.  Huge commemoration
 demonstrations and mass meetings will be held, and the implementation of the
 war mobilization movement will be intensified.  Of special importance, during
 the commemoration maximum strength should be devoted to instituting work in the
 White areas and White armies, so as to win over the revolutionary soldiers in
 the White armies surrounding the Soviets and disintegrate the armies of the
 enemy's large-scale assault, in order to thoroughly destroy the imperialist
 Kuomintang's large-scale assault and realize the Soviets' initial victory in
 Kiangsi and neighboring provinces and regions.   It is so ordered.

 as sabotaging the financial unification.
 2. All independent local guerrilla units' and all local armed associations' ex-
 penses must be on a self-supporting basis; but funds raised by local armed or-
 ganizations also shall be paid over to the military organs for planned allocation.
 3. If some local armed associations by reason of temporary difficulties cannot
 support themselves, they must make a budget and report it to the military dis-
 trict
 to receive a disbursement,  They cannot under any circumstances take it
 upon themselves to draw from the branch treasuries.
 4. Financial departments at all levels must direct and supervise their subor-
 dinate organizations in an even more planned way, intensify the collection of
 all revenues, and develop financial sources.  They may not, because of the
 availability of disbursements from above, relax in the matter of collecting re-
 venues.   Violations will be considered sabotage.

 ON STRICT CONTROL OF DEPARTING PERSONS--ORDER NO 37.OF CENTRAL PEOPLE'S
 COMMITTEE
 [Text]  We are now in the tense period in which the imperialist Kuomintang is
 mounting large-scale attaks on the Central Soviet, and we must naturally take
 extra care concerning people'departing from the Soviet.   They must be subjected
 to close examination and not allowed to leave the area at will.  This is to pre-
 vent oppressive gentry, landlords and all counterrevolutionary elements from
 departing freely from the area and engaging in counterrevolutionary activities.
 In order to consolidate the Soviets and protect the interests of the worker-
 peasant masses,  the Provisional Central Government has laid down regulations
 for people departing from the Soviet areas as follows:
 1. All persons departing from the Soviet areas must have an exit visa from the
 State Political Security Office and a travel pass from the government before
 they are allowed to go.   If they have only the visa and not the travel pass,
 or especially if they have only the travel pass and not the visa, they shall
 not be allowed to go.
 2. The State Political Security  Office and its provincial and county branches
 (the district special sepresentatives have no power to issue visas) must sub-
 ject all persons requesting to depart to close examination, and only those who
 are determined to have a need to go outside the area may be issued exit visas.
 The route by which they are to depart must be specified on the visa.
 3. Provincial, county and district governments (the township governments have
 no power to issue travel passes) should issue travel passes to leave the area
 to people with only State Political Security Office visas who request them only
 in accordance with the route specified on the visa, and not otherwise.   The dis-
 trict governments in particular, when drawing up exit passes, must investigate
 thoroughly to assure that the persons are really transients or departing persons
 from that district whose route must pass through that district, and are not
 people who have purposely fled to that district from other districts to obtain
 travel passes, before they issue them.  All local governments, security offices
 at all levels, all military organs and all investigative organs are charged

 ON STARTING SPRING PLANTING EARLY IN ORDER TO CONCENTRATE FORCES TO SMASH
 ENEMY LARGE-SCALE ATTACKS--DIRECTIVE NO 18 OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 [Text]  The revolutionary war has reached an extremely tense crisis, and the
 imperialist Kuomintang is mounting a large-scale attack on the Central Soviet
 with all its strength.   Because it is trying to save its moribund   rule, this
 bitter class struggle is now undergoing a sharp development.  This campaign
 is a do-or-die struggle for the enemy, much more violent than the first, second
 or third campaign, and in order to thoroughly smash the enemy's attack and win
 an even greater victory we must mobilize the broad masses of workers and peasants
 and use all our strength to wage a resolute, bitter, protracted struggle against
 the enemy.   However, spring planting is not far off, and the spring planting
 period is likely to the most intense period of the war.  Accordingly, in order
 to allow the broad masses of workers and peasants to do their planting safely
 and to quickly finish their spring planting work and concentrate all their
 forces without any distracting concerns to destroy the enemy attacks, the Central
 Government has determined that within all the Soviet areas.all spring planting
 shall be begun early.  Measures should be taken to increase production and speed
 up the work as much as possible, since we expect in a short time to greatly in-
 crease the food harvest in the Soviet areas, in order to secure the provisioning
 of the Red Army, improve the daily life of the worker-peasant masses, and guarantee
 the complete victory of the revolutionary war.  Accordingly this decision is of
 especially great importance, and governments  at all levels must work with all
 mass organizations, such as the Rural Laborers' Unions, the Poor Peasants' Assoc-
 iations to make the greatest efforts at mobilizing all the masses to fully imple-
 ment the following measures:
 2.   Sowing and setting of rice seedlings must be done one month earlier than
 last year.
 3.   Each family must ready enough fertilizer and select its best seeds,  so
 that it will not only be able to greatly increase production but can facilitate
 rapid sowing and setting of rice seedlings

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 4.  The masses everywhere must institute mutual aid in planting, and assist
 each other with labor, seeds, draft animals and tools,  so as to quickly carry
 out the spring planting work.
 5.  The masses must be mobilized to plant the Red Army's public fields and
 the land belonging to Red Army families at the earliest possible moment.   Not
 an inch must be left unattended.
 Governments at all levels must devise more concrete methods of convening the
 Rural Laborers' Unions, Poor Peasants' Associations and electoral mass meetings
 for extensive propaganda and agitation,  setting up revolutionary emulation
 and offering prized according to their specific situations.  The hsiangs and
 persons whose land is plowed first, and whose dikes are repaired first,
 whose fertilizer and seeds are readied first, who complete their sowing
 and setting of seedlings first,  shall be awarded prizes by the county district
 governments.   It is especially important that the localities where land
 determination has not been fully completed should immediately complete the
 distribution, to avoid hindering spring planting. It is so ordered.

 RENAME NING-TU HSIEN PO-SHENG COUNTY AND CONVENE A MEMORIAL MEETING TO
 COMMEMORATE COMRADE CHAO PO-SHENG--ORDER NO 15 OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
 [Text] Comrade Chao Po-sheng [6392 0590 3932], Deputy General Commander of
 the 5th Corps and leader of the 13th Army, was a leader in the Ning-tu
 [1337 6757] soldiers' riots and the creator of the 5th Corps of the Chinese
 Workers-Peasant Red Army.   At this time, our Red Army has won successive
 great victories at Nan-fu [0589 2329] and Chin-hsi [6855 3005], destroying
 and routing main force units of the enemy's large-scale attack on the Central
 Soviet--the reorganized warlord 90th division and warlord Chiang's 14th
 and 27th divisions had moved close to Fu-nan [2329 0589] city--and so began
 this year's great victories by smashing the enemy's large-scale attack.
 Unfortunately,  Comrade Chao Po-sheng sacrificed his life in the Nan-ch'eng
 [0589 1004] campaign,  in which he led all of his fighters in a heroic and
 determined hand-to-hand battle with the enemy, and with numerically inferior
 forces put to flight a full division of warlord Chiang Kai-shek's main
 units--the 14th Division--thereby completing the complete victory of our
 main-force army in the environs of Fu-chou [2329 1558].   In order to
 commemorate Chao Po-sheng's glorious feats of leading the Ning-chou riots
 and heroically sacrificing his life for the revolution, the Provisional
 Central Government has decided to change the name of Ning-tu Hsien to
 Po-sheng Hsien.    In addition,  in the course of this year's Li Lu [2621 4151]
 commemoration (the 21st)  all Soviets will hold a memorial service and proclaim
 the establishment of Po-sheng County.   It is so ordered.

 DECLARATION OF THE REVOLUTIONARY MILITARY COMMISSION OF THE WORKER-PEASANT
 RED ARMY OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
 17 January 1933
 [Text] Masses of all China!  With the open assistance of the English and
 French imperialists and the League of Nations, the Japanese imperialists
 have begun the invasion of North China.  This is a further extension of the
 imperialist bandits' aggression aimed at complete dismemberment and enslave-
 ment of all China.  It has resulted in the massacre of large numbers of.peace-
 ful inhabitants, the destruction of cities and villages, and an increase in
 suffering and famine..  The tragedy of Shanghai and Manchuria is being
 repeated with extreme cruelty on a large part of China's soil.
 Because of failure to resist and surrender on the part of the Kuomintang
 warlords Chiang Kai-shek and Chang Hsueh-liang, because of their repression,
 dispersion and massacre of soldiers resisting the Japanese, large numbers
 of Chinese soldiers have died under the guns of the imperialists.   The
 Kuomintang warlords have assisted the Japanese and the other imperialists
 in their further aggression and their massacres, while using all their
 strength to suppress the anti-imperialist struggle, the goods boycott and
 the organized armed militia.
 The Kuomintang government and its politicians offer as one explanation of
 their evil deeds and treasonous collaboration the idea that the existence
 of the Chinese soviets makes them unable to mobilize all their forces for
 national defense, so that Chiang Kai-shek is unwilling to fight the
 Japanese warlords while he uses an army of almost a million men to attack
 the Chinese workers and peasants who have already set up their soviet
 government.
 But the Chinese masses want to defend themselves, and many units and many
 hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang troops have opposed the massacre of
 their own brothers and sisters and supported armed resistance to Japanese
 imperialism.

 They are beginning to understand that only a national revolutionary struggle
 of the armed masses can victoriously resist the aggression of the Japanese
 imperialists.   The Chinese soviet government and the revolutionary military
 committee denounce the Kuomintang's explanation as a stupid lie by which
 they hope to conceal their treasonous activities from China's masses.
 The Chinese Soviet Government and the revolutionary. military committee
 once more remind the Chinese masses that last April we called upon China's
 masses to wage an armed struggle in common with us against Japanese
 imperialism, and that Chiang Kai-shek's response to this call was to
 mobilize all his troops to attack the Chinese. worker-peasant government and
 the Worker-Peasant Red Army rather than to attack Japanese imperialism.
 The Chinese soviet government and the Worker and Peasant Red Army military
 commission declare before the Chinese masses that the Chinese Worker-
 Peasant Red Army is prepared to conclude a wartime agreement with any armed
 unit to oppose the invasion of the Japanese imperialists under the follow-
 ing conditions.
 1.  That it immediately stop attacking the Chinese soviet areas.
 2.  That it immediately guarantee the democratic rights of the masses (those
 of assembly, association, speech, strike and publication).
 3.  That it immediately arm the masses and form armed militia to protect
 China and win.Chinese independence, unification and territorial integrity.
 We request that the Chinese masses and soldiers support this call and wage
 a united national revolutionary struggle to gain China's independence, unity
 and territorial integrity, coordinate the struggle against Japan and all
 imperialists with the struggle against the treason and surrender of the
 imperialists' running dogs the KMT warlords, and extend the armed national
 revolutionary struggle against Japan and all imperialists.

 ON THE LENDING OF GRAIN TO THE RED ARMY BY THE REVOLUTIONARY MASSES
 Directive No 20 of the Central Executive Committee
 1 March 1933
 [Text] From government reports from many localities in the two provinces
 of Kiangsi and Fukien and numerous requests from revolutionary groups every-
 where, the Central Government has concluded that the imperialist KMT is
 now conducting large-scale attacks and engaging in large-scale burning,
 slaughter, and pillage against the masses in the soviet areas.   Lung-yen
 county in Fukien has been totally devastated, with incalculable losses to
 the masses.  Hsi-nan District in Yung-ting has lost more than 20,000 tan
 of.grain taken away by the White armies.  In Kiangsi, during the last 3
 campaigns, the White troops killed several thousand people, burned tens
 of thousands of houses and pillaged tens of thousands of tan of grain and
 several tens of thousands of head of livestock.  At present, several hundred
 thousand White troops under Chiang Kai-shek and Ch'en Chi-t'ang have begun
 to storm into the soviet areas, burning, massacring and. plundering.   Our
 heroic Red Army is now engaged in bitter combat with the White troops every-
 where, but it is short on grain and only if the revolutionary masses every-
 where are willing to undertake to limit their grain consumption and lend
 grain to the Red Army so as to completely destroy the vicious White armies
 and thoroughly smash the imperialist KMT's large-scale attack, can we pre-
 vent the masses in the soviet areas from being crushed.
 On the basis of the above-mentioned opinion of the masses, the Central
 Government has decided to accept this request of the masses, and it has
 determined that the revolutionary masses shall of their own accord lend
 grain in the following manner:
 1.   Grain is something that every peasant household has, so lending grain
 is much easier than lending money, especially when the masses are resisting
 the brutality of the White armies and revolutionary fervor is at a high
 pitch.   The governments of all localities should work together with all
 the mass organizations to carry out this movement, and within 3 months each
 county must complete the lending of grain by the masses, because during
 this time the warfare will become much more intense.

 2.   The carrying out of this grain lending movement must be based on excel-
 lent agitation and propaganda work.   The phrasing of the propaganda must
 be highly colloquial and every method must be used, such as performing new
 plays, making speeches in costume, putting up slogans, and issuing illus-
 trated flyers, etc., to make all those masses who have not yet requested to
 lend grain understand, and so that it will become a large-scale spontaneous
 movement of all the masses to lend grain.  As to those masses who have not
 yet spontaneously made their request, it is absolutely forbidden to subject
 them to such command-ist methods as forced-loan confrontations instead of
 propagandizing them.   If forced-loan confrontation methods are used not.
 only will the Soviet government become divorced from the masses, but less
 grain will surely be obtained than if propaganda were used.
 3.   Allocation of quotas for grain lending must be determined in accordance
 with each locality's actual situation and the capacity of the masses to
 lend grain.   It cannot be a uniform quota throughout.   In the old soviet
 areas, quotas should be allocated on the basis of rice production, with
 rich producing areas lending more, and comparatively smaller producing
 areas lending less.   In the new soviet areas, account should be taken of
 the masses' understanding of the revolution and whether or not struggle
 has penetrated deeply.  The areas where the struggle has gone deep should
 lend more than those where it has not.   As to border areas, determination
 should be made on the basis of whether or not they have been subject to
 counterrevolutionary devastation and plunder.  Those areas that have been
 severely devastated need not lend; those who have suffered less should lend
 a suitable amount according to their circumstances.   Only in this way can
 we make the masses understand that lending grain to the government truly
 serves to protect their own interests, make them eagerly give it, and avoid
 the occurrence of difficulties and bad influences in doing the work.
 4.   On receipt of this directive, governments at all levels must immediately
 and in accordance with the methods outlined summon the chairmen of all
 townships to a joint meeting to plan allocation of quotas and must send
 persons to all districts and townships to hold congresses and meetings of
 poor peasants associations, agricultural laborers associations and the
 electorate, and to propagandize and explain to the people of those locali-
 ties the eagerness of the masses elsewhere to lend grain and their methods
 of doing it, as well as organizing emulation so that everyone will lend
 grain eagerly.
 5.   The grain that is lent shall be handled as follows in the various areas:
 a.   In Kiangsi
 1.   Po-sheng, Shih-ch'eng, Yu-tu, hui-ch'ang, Jui-chin, Sheng-li
 and Hsing-kuo counties and southern Yun-feng shall all collect it at the
 district government headquarters, and apart from a portion that shall be
 given to the local hospital, government, [army] units and other state organs
 for their expenses, the rest should be saved and handled according to
 future orders of the central government.

 2.   Kung-lueh, Wan-t'ai, and northern Yung-feng, Kan-hsien, I-huang,
 Lo-an Nan-kuang, An-yuan, Hsun-wu:  apart from a portion which shall be taken
 out for the operating expenses of the local Red Army (paid for by the
 government) government hospitals and various organs by the county govern-
 ments after discussion of their needs and for assistance to the mass organi-
 zations, the remainder may be sold at current market price.
 1.   In Ch'ang-t'ing and Ning-hua it shall be collected at the
 district government headquarters and kept to be disposed of in accordance
 with future orders of the central government; but in Shang-hang Hsin-ch'uan
 and Wu-p'ing some shall be used to provision the local Red Army and govern-
 ment organs and subsidize the mass organizations (given out according to
 price) and the rest sold at the going price.
 2.   Proceeds from all grain sold at an estimated price must be
 handed over to the treasury branch and a 5-copy receipt obtained from the
 treasury branch as proof.  No government at any level may appropriate the
 .slightest amount, and if there is any unauthorized use of these funds or
 if the price of the sale is reported as lower than it actually was, those
 guilty of corruption and misconduct will be dealt with severely.
 6.   All local governments, hospitals and units and revolutionary mass
 organizations which eat rice shall sell off these grains as quickly as
 possible, but they must do it for cash and not on credit.
 7.   After the financial units at all levels have received grain borrowing
 receipts from the central government financial department, they must set
 up special grain borrowing accounts showing item by item the amount of
 grain received from the masses, number of grain receipts issued to the
 masses, amounts of grain issued to various organs, and amount of grain sold
 and the price, in order to aid in keeping correct accounts.  Money from the
 grain sales handed over to the branch departments shall be put by the
 treasury branches into a separate account named the "Masses' Grain Lending
 Account" and must not be mixed in with special income or the Red Army's
 public grain account.
 8.   All masses who lend grain shall receive a grain lending receipt issued
 by the central government's Financial People's Committee as proof.
 9.   Anyone who receives a grain lending receipt shall be allowed in the
 second half of 1933 to submit it as part of his land tax.   Those which are
 obtained after the tax or are left over after paying the tax shall be
 redeemed for cash by the district government leadership at the proper
 time.

 10.   The grain loan receipts must bear the seal of the township soviet
 chairman and may only be used to pay taxes in that district.   Those that
 do not bear this seal or are not from the district in question shall be
 considered as void extra receipts.
 11.   The receipts shall be distributed by the county government depart-
 ments in accordance with the situation of the masses and the grain in each
 district.  The districts in turn shall allocate them after discussion of
 the situations of the various townships.   The government leadership at every
 level shall keep a record of all receipts issued, and if they hold receipts
 for which grain has not been handed in these must be handed over; there
 cannot be any discrepancies.
 12.   When the masses lend their grain they shall be given receipts in
 return, and anyone who lends grain and does not receive one may complain
 to the higher level governments and request strict enforcement.   The grain
 from the "three sheng of rice" movement collected in the various localities
 since January of this year may be included in the amount of grain lent,
 and receipts must be issued for it.
 13.   If rich peasants have had to make forced contributions they shall not
 be made to lend grain.

 OPPOSE JAPANESE IMPERIALISTS' OCCUPATION OF JEHOL AND ATTACK ON PEKING
 AND TIENTSIN
 Proclamation of Provisional Central Government
 3 March 1933
 [Text] To the masses of all China!
 The 75mm artillery and great numbers of fighters and bombers of the Japanese
 imperialists are now carrying out inhumane bombardment massacres in the
 Jehol area!  Eight Japanese imperialist divisions and two brigades, with
 the support of several hundred aircraft, are now attacking Ch'eng-te
 from three directions!  The KMT generals continue to follow their shame-
 less policy of non-resistance and retreat step by step, giving up K'ai-lu,
 Pei-p'iao and Ch'ao-yang, and have abandoned hundreds of thousands of
 peaceful inhabitants and anti-Japanese soldiers to be trodden under the
 iron hoofs of Japanese imperialism, crushed and massacred!
 Masses of all China!  More than half of Jehol has already fallen into the
 hands of the Japanese imperialists, and all of North China is at a life-
 or-death crisis, and the tragic fate of colonial slavery directly threatens
 the toiling masses of all China!
 Masses of all China!  The imperialists' bandit war to invade and enslave
 all of China is now being frenziedly waged, and only one road lies before
 us:  to arm ourselves and wage a revolutionary national liberation war.  Only
 the armed strength of the millions of the masses can defeat the bandit war
 of the Japanese and all imperialists to invade and enslave China and can
 gain independence, liberation and territorial integrity for the Chinese
 people!  The provisional Chinese soviet government has repeatedly called
 upon the masses of all China to arise and wage a victorious national
 revolutionary war together with the Worker-Peasant Red Army and the toiling
 masses of the soviets.  In its most recent declaration it clearly declared
 before the masses of China that the Chinese Worker-Peasant Red Army is
 willing to conclude a conditional wartime agreement with all true anti-
 Japanese units.  But the KMT warlords and politicians have most shamelessly
 knelt before the imperialists and betrayed China, practicing non-resistance

 and surrender, have cut off the Three Eastern Provinces and sold out Shanghai
 and massacred anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist worker-peasant masses and
 revolutionary fighters, and forbidden the organization of all goods boycotts
 and anti-Japanese militia.  Now, at the very moment when the Japanese
 imperialists are attacking Jehol with all their strength,. they even more
 openly advocate abandoning Jehol and Peking and Tientsin; they protest
 that this is a strategic necessity, while at the same time they attack the
 Chinese worker-peasant masses and the worker-peasant government and Red
 Army with dozens of divisions!  The Soviet Government declares that it is
 willing to draw up a wartime agreement with all truly anti-Japanese armies.
 The KMT response to this declaration is to retreat step by step before the
 iron hoofs of the Japanese imperialists, without dispatching a single
 soldier to Jehol to resist the Japanese, but to dispatch the greater part
 of its military force to Kiangsi and under the personal leadership of the
 counterrevolutionary chieftain Chiang Kai-shek to wildly attack the soviet
 areas!  It is precisely because the soviet areas have called upon and
 organized the anti-imperialist, anti-Japanese movement throughout the country
 that the traitorous KMT government has, with increased ferocity, resorted
 more and more to burning, slaughter and pillage, military adventurism and
 economic blockade, with the aim of hindering the development of the soviet
 movement, in order to break the main force of anti-imperialism and resistance
 to Japan!
 The KMT warlords and politicians plan to treat the soviet government's declara-
 tion that it is willing to draw up a wartime treaty with all anti-Japanese
 units as an expression of the Soviet government' and Worker-Peasant Red
 Army's weakness; but this actually expresses their own obtuseness and
 stupidity.   The warfare of the last 2 days has taught these traitorous war-
 lords a stern lesson:   the 52nd and 59th divisions have been entirely
 disarmed, and their commanders and staff officers have all been captured,
 so that the 5th Army is a shambles.  The soviet movement has gained the
 support of millions of the masses, while the KMT warlords' military adven-
 turism and economic blockade have only served to further stir up the
 resistance of the toiling masses of.the entire country, and in addition
 have created favorable conditions for the further advancement of the
 soviet movement!
 The Chinese Soviet Government is preparing to wage war directly against the
 troops of the Japanese imperialists and to drive them out of China.  Accord-
 ingly, we must eliminate all reactionary armies and armed groups which
 hinder us in doing battle with Japan!   The Soviet Government and the
 Worker-Peasant Red Army once more declare that they are willing to enter
 into a wartime agreement with all truly anti-Japanese military forces, but
 they will strike the gravest blows at all armies and armed groups which
 encroach upon the soviet areas, to the point of completely destroying them!
 We call upon our brothers among the fighters of the White armies!   Rise and
 oppose your treasonous officers, turn the guns around, join up with the
 Red Army to oppose the bandit invasion of the Japanese imperialists and
 drive them out of China!

 ON THE MATTER OF GRAIN REDISTRIBUTION AMONG THE PEOPLE TO KEEP UP THE
 PROVISIONING OF THE ARMED FORCES
 Order No 39 Of the People's Committee of the Provisional Central Government
 4 March 1933
 [Text] According to reports from various localities in various counties
 in the soviet areas, a good many localities have recently forbidden the
 transport of cereals and rice, and county A and county B have drawn a
 boundary line between them; in many localities there has been a grain
 famine, and prices have soared or grain cannot be bought at any price.
 This is an extremely grave circumstance.  Investigation indicates that in
 the soviet areas the food situation is uneven, with surpluses in some
 areas and shortages in others.   In the border areas, where the enemy are
 plundering and pillaging, there are rice famines.   In the areas where the
 Red Army is stationed and near hospitals food is even more in shortage.
 Readjustment between the districts and the counties affects not only the
 daily food of the ordinary masses, but is an extremely critical matter
 affecting the provisioning of the Red Army and its hospitals and rear
 area.  It is therefore an absolutely indispensible condition for the
 smashing of the enemy's fourth attack and accordingly is extremely criti-
 cal.
 The reasons that grain circulation has been hindered boil down to three:
 1.  The masses who are short on food are afraid that much will flow out
 of their area, and in May and June they will have to eat high-priced
 rice.
 2.  Those who have excess food wish to keep it for later, so as to get
 high prices.
 3.  Rich peasants and traitorous merchants are manipulating and trying to
 get profits, or even intentionally making trouble in order to subvert the
 revolutionary war, and the governments of the various areas are not
 investigating them.   So as it turns out, people are afraid that in May

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 and June they will be eating high-priced rice, while in other places it
 has come to that much earlier, and they are already eating rice at a high
 price. In Yung-ting you can get 3 1/2 sheng for a yuan, whereas in Shang-
 hang you can get 4 sheng for a yuan, in Ting-chou 7 sheng, and in Jui-
 chin it is as high as 8, but in other rice-poor areas it gets more expen-
 sive day by day.   The workers in the cities have no land to farm but
 make a living by selling their labor, and a whole family with young and
 old, with that little bit of income from their labor, eats rice that
 keeps getting more and more expensive.   The entire Red Army is now on the
 front line fighting a life-and-death struggle with the enemy, and relies
 upon the rear area to keep sending up military provisions.   The governments
 of all areas must explain this fact to the masses in their areas:  we
 certainly want the whole soviet area to have food to eat, but we especially
 want the Red Army to have food to eat, and only by joining forces with a
 common purpose to smash the enemy can we move ahead.   They must tell those
 people who have extra grain not to.keep thinking of high prices when
 people in other places are suffering hunger and the front lines are short
 on military provisions; people can't stand by and watch without heeding.
 They must know that it is bad for everybody, and if the Red Army doesn't
 win, you can't achieve your own aims.  As to the rich peasants and merchants,
 they were unhappy when the government collected military provisions and
 when the cooperatives redistributed the people's food, and they either
 intentionally stored it away or secretly engaged in manipulation, or even
 disseminated rumors on a large scale to stir up the masses.   This is counter-
 revolutionary activity and governments at all levels in all localities
 must lead the revolutionary masses in dealing severely with these people.
 They must know that the interests the whole and the interests of the war
 take first place among all interests.  The local governments and the masses
 must understand this profoundly.
 The central government has decided on a plan for grain distribution and
 has set up a grain distribution office.   All local governments must lead
 the masses to quickly organize food cooperatives, and with the leadership
 and assistance of the food redistribution offices they must strive to
 carry out the redistribution.  In addition to rice, they must ration salt
 in order to prevent the rich peasants and traitorous merchants from
 storing it away and manipulating the market; in order to guard against
 the KMT's grave economic blockade, to regulate the people's food in
 all areas, and to continue the provisioning of the front line.  All local
 governments must know that the central soviet's harvests were not rich
 last year, and this year's spring famine problems will inevitably be
 more serious.   Leading the masses to.resolve this grave problem is a
 major task for the soviet governments; from the provincial--level soviets
 down to the urban and rural representative assemblies, all must conduct
 detailed discussions, plan meticulously, propagandize broadly and carry
 it out with great effort if we are to complete this task.   This is an
 extremely pressing question for the masses.   It is the main key to smashing
 the enemy's fourth encirclement campaign.   In order to make the Soviet
 Government into.a government which truly represents the masses' interests

 and-which powerfully leads the war, we must avoid the slightest neglect
 of this problem.
 .The Central Government's Ministry of Interior shall not only issue this
 report, but shall notify all local governments at all levels to earnestly
 implement it. It is so ordered.

 declared before the masses of China that the Chinese Worker-Peasant Red
 Army is willing to conclude a wartime agreement, under the simplest and
 most essential conditions, with all true anti-Japanese armies.  But the
 KMT warlords and politicians have most shamelessly knelt before the
 imperialists and betrayed China, practicing non-resistance and surrender.
 (Hiatus)   It is precisely because the soviet areas have called upon and
 organized the anti-imperialist anti-Japanese movement throughout the coun-
 try that the traitorous KMT government has, with increased ferocity,
 resorted more and more to burning, slaughter and pillage, military adven-
 turism and economic blockade, with the aim of hindering the development

 the Soviet Government's declaration that it is willing to draw up a war-

 Government and Worker-Peasant Red Army's weakness; but this actually
 expresses their own obtuseness and stupidity.  The warfare of the last 2
 months has taught these traitorous warlords a stern lesson:  The 52nd
 and 59th Divisions have been entirely disarmed and their commanders and
 staff officers have all been captured, so that the 5th Army is a shambles.
 The soviet movement has gained the support of millions of the masses, while
 the KMT warlords' military adventurism and economic blockade have only
 served to further stir up the resistance of the toiling masses of the
 entire country.
 The Chinese Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army are preparing
 to wage war directly against the troops of the Japanese imperialists and
 to drive them out of China.  Accordingly we must disarm all reactionary
 armies which hinder us in doing battle with Japan.   The Soviet Government
 and the Worker-Peasant Red Army once more declare that they are willing
 to enter into a wartime agreement with all truly anti-Japanese armies.
 As to all armies and armed groups invading the soviet areas, we call upon
 our brothers among the fighters of the White armies to rise and oppose
 your treasonous officers, turn the guns around, join up with the Red Army
 to oppose the bandit invasion of the Japanese imperialists and drive

 ON THE QUESTION OF SUPPRESSING INTERNAL COUNTERREVOLUTION
 Directive No 21 of the Central Executive Committee of the Provisional
 Central Government
 [Text] At a time when the imperialist KMT warlords have carried out four
 encirclement campaigns against the soviet areas throughout the country and
 are now carrying out a large-scale attack against the Central Soviet
 area, and when the struggle between revolution and counterrevolution has
 arrived at the point of life-and-death struggle, the enemy is not only
 applying military force but is also organizing counterrevolutionary activi-
 ties in the soviet areas in a planned way, using the landlords, rich
 peasants and merchants in the soviet areas to organize all sorts of
 counterrevolutionary groups (the AB Group, the Social Democratic Party,
 the Trotskyite Party and feudal superstitious groups like the I-hsin Hui
 [0001 1800 2585] and Lan-tzu Hui [2036 1311 2585]), deceiving a minority
 of backward masses, seizing opportunities to stir up trouble, and at the
 same time sending scouts to penetrate the Soviet areas to ferret out
 military intelligence.   On the basis of recently discovered facts, such
 as the people who shouted counterrevolutionary slogans at the mass meeting
 in Ting-chou and the smashing and capture of a KMT county party branch
 organ in Ting-thou, the discovery of similar reactionary posters in the
 three localities of Jui-chin, Ting-chou and Ho't'.ien, the secreting
 away of four rifles in the household of the Shih-ch'eng propaganda depart-
 ment chief, the organization by the enemy of anti-revolutionary activities
 in Nan-kuang [0589 1639] county which hindered all mass work and wartime
 mobilization work, the plans of traitorous merchants in the Hui-ch'ang
 area to carry on activities to subvert the soviet currency, the planned
 money conversion by traitorous merchants in Jui-chin and Ting-chou,
 the manipulation of commodity prices everywhere by traitorous merchants,
 along with large-scale transfer of cash, and even the discovery of counter-
 revolutionary subversive actions in certain of the local armed organiza-
 tions, all of these recently discovered facts prove clearly that the enemy
 is organizing counterrevolution in the soviet areas, and politically and
 economically and in all ways he is carrying out pernicious plans to destroy
 the Soviet and the revolution.

 But our soviet governments in all areas are completely lacking in vigilance
 and still are paying insufficient attention to this grave counterrevolu-
 tionary activity, and are even permitting it.   The central government is
 now gravely calling it to the attention of governments and their organs
 for suppressing counterrevolutionaries at all levels that this past atti-
 tude.of paying no attention to and permitting counterrevolutionary activi-
 ties is totally impermissible, all governments and their organs for
 purging counterrevolutionaries must immediately rectify these errors and
 must immediately take steps to deal with counterrevolution in accordance
 with the actual situation in their localities.  In the districts and town-
 ships and in particular in all the cities, whenever lurking counterrevolu-
 tionary elements or their activities are encountered, resolute and rapid
 measures must be taken to repress them severely, and when the situation
 is pressing they must proclaim a temporary state of martial law and the
 ?       soviet governments and all revolutionary organs must institute an armed
 and mass-style defense.   In order to sternly put down counterrevolution,
 important counterrevolutionary elements must rapidly and unhesitatingly
 be apprehended and punished and the nature of their crimes must be broadly
 propagandized among the local masses.  Governments in all localities
 and at all levels and especially the urban and district and township govern-
 ments, must propagandize the fact of the coordination of counterrevolution
 activities within the soviet areas with the White armies outside, and
 mobilize all the revolutionary masses to carry out the most stringent
 oversight and surveillance over merchants, rich peasants and landlord
 elements and to seek in all quarters for clues of counterrevolutionary
 organization and activity.   The soviet government organs for suppressing
 counterrevolution must set up close relationships with the labor unions,
 agricultural laborers' associations, poor peasant associations and other
 revolutionary groups, because only if the broad masses under the leader-
 ship of the government set to work enthusiastically can counterrevolutionary
 organizations and activities be thoroughly extirpated.   The judicial depart-
 ments in all counties in the border areas must quickly deal with all
 criminals already apprehended; and all elements whose crimes have been
 clearly proven, starting with the alien class elements among them, must
 immediately be put to death.   The death sentences need not be carried out
 according to.Article 26 of the Judicial Department's Temporary Regulations
 on Organization and Judicial Activities, which requires permission from
 the higher levels; the death sentences may be carried out first and the
 cases reported to superiors afterward.  As to the central districts,
 accumulated cases must also be quickly dispatched and must not be allowed
 to pile up again, nor must there be any delay of the speedy suppression
 of counterrevolutionaries.   In the central areas, in times of particular
 distress death sentences may also be carried out and the superior authori-
 ties informed afterwards.  This is a measure which it is necessary for us
 to take while the enemy are carrying out large-scale attacks, and it cannot
 be regularly adopted in ordinary times.
 Landlords and rich peasants in areas under attack by the enemy and border
 areas must be dealt with separately.  When they have actually engaged in

 counterrevolutionary activities, they must immediately be apprehended and
 severely punished, and not given leeway for the slightest bit of activity.
 As to the other landlord and rich peasant elements about which nothing
 counterrevolutionary has been discovered, the government in the locale
 must stir up the masses to keep strict surveillance on their activities.
 They should not all be apprehended, except if they exercise an unwholesome
 influence or if it makes dealing with them later more difficult.  The
 central government confidently believes that in this attack of internal
 and external counterrevolution on the revolution, we possess the conditions
 to entirely smash them and win an all-round victory.  We have the broad
 masses of the people and the powerful Red Army, we have strong and con-
 solidated government organs and we must use these powerful government organs
 (central and local) to lead the millions of worker-peasant masses and the
 Red Army to strike mortal blows against our internal and external enemies.
 We have the precious experience of the past purges of counterrevolutionaries
 and we must use these experiences to subject counterrevolutionary elements
 within the soviet areas to stern repression and thorough extirpation.
 Governments at all levels upon receiving this directive must immediately
 and in the light of the concrete situation in their locality decide upon
 the methods of implementing it, and must report on methods of implementation
 through channels.  It is so ordered.

 ON MOBILIZING THE MASSES TO HELP GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL IN THEIR FARMING
 WORK SO TO RELIEVE THE FAMILY DISTRESS OF GOVERNMENT WORK-PERSONNEL AND
 INCREASE. GOVERNMENT WORK EFFICIENCY
 Order No 18 of the Central Executive Committee, Provisional Central Govern-
 ment
 14 April 1933
 [Text]   In the current period of bitter struggle in the civil war, the
 workers of the Soviet Government have been unable to pay out wages accord-
 ing to individual labor, so that people's families have no economic assis-
 tance.                        This spirit of bitter sacrifice on the part of workers in the
 Soviet Government deserves praise.  The situation everywhere tells us that
 there are many poverty-stricken worker-peasant elements who are active
 and have work ability, but since they are the main workers in their
 families' production and have been bound by family labor and cannot come
 to work in the government, so that the governments in some areas lack
 such good work personnel and have chosen some not very active people, who
 are lacking in work ability, for government work.   The reason is that only
 these people are not the main laborers in family production and are not
 bound by the family labor, and accordingly they have been selected for
 government work.   In this way, the standard for selecting personnel has
 departed from revolutionary activism and work ability and only depends on
 the family being at leisure, a circumstance which is impermissible.   There
 is another, even more impermissible circumstance;   in some localities at
 election time the good elements, because of the press of their family liveli-
 hood, are unwilling to be elected, and so bad elements come out, rich
 peasants and vagabonds, and thus bore into the soviet organs.   This is
 going on in some localities.  As to people from good class origins, active
 in the revolution and capable in their work, they have taken on government
 work, but because of family labor problems which. are unresolvable they
 cannot work with an easy mind, a situation which is extremely widespread
 (particularly at the district and township levels).

 The central executive committee, on the basis of the above circumstances,
 and in order to make the soviet government into an active and able govern-
 ment, able to lead the broad masses of the people, under circumstances of
 bitter struggle, to win a revolutionary victory, has resolved:
 For all workers in the soviet governments at all levels, who want to
 participate but whose families truly have no labor force or not enough,
 after it is so determined, the local government must mobilize the masses
 to do their families' farming for them or help their families do it,
 (families whose labor force is sufficient are excluded), to the extent
 that their family livelihood will not fall short of what it would be if
 they themselves were present and working.  For a 'concrete method, Point 4
 of the Red Army "Good Treatment" points may be used ("For those with no
 labor force, people shall be sent to help with all planting, irrigation,
 and harvesting work; for those with insufficient labor force, supplemental
 assistance according to their needs shall be given.").  These people's
 domestic worries should be alleviated so that they can do their government
 work with their minds at ease.   The use of this aid measure is aimed at
 bringing large numbers of the people with good class background, revolu-
 tionary activism and good work ability into the soviet governments at
 all levels and strengthening the governments' work abilities.   This is
 made known with the expectation that governments at all levels will comply
 and implement it.   It is so ordered.

 PROCLAMATION OF THE PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY AFFAIRS
 COMMISSION OF THE WORKER-PEASANT RED ARMY
 15 April 1933
 [Text] Masses of all China!
 On 1 May we shall solemnly convey our revolutionary greetings to the toiling
 masses of all China, to the workers and peasants and urban poor groaning
 under the blood-stained leadership of the KMT, to the fighters who were
 oppressed into opposing the Chinese workers and peasants, to the revolu-
 tionary students and youth participating in the anti-imperialist struggle,
 and to the hundreds and thousands of revolutionary prisoners incarcerated
 and oppressed in KMT prisons!
 The continuing attacks of Japanese imperialism, the unprecedented buildup
 of a crisis threatening the. total dismemberment of China, and the profun-
 dity of the crisis of the whole people impels us to make a further declara-
 tion to all people fighting for the interests of China and to the toiling
 masses.  The characteristic of the present situation is the totally unchecked
 rush of the Japanese imperialists into Peking and Hankow.  At the same time
 the British imperialists are attacking in Sinkiang and are preparing, through
 their puppets in Tibet and elsewhere, to occupy western China.   In the
 secret talks now being held by the Japanese and the KMT, Chiang Kai-shek
 has made yet another deal with the imperialist bandits.  The secretariat of
 the Central Political Committee of the KMT, with powers to represent the
 Nanking government and Chiang Kai-shek, are holding secret talks with the
 Japanese representative Yoshizawa in Shanghai.  Chiang Kai-shek--the
 executioner of the Chinese workers and peasants and the chief criminal
 who in 1929 asked the Japanese to occupy Shantung and in 1932 secretly_
 massacred the defenders of Shanghai-has now abandoned the northern front
 and is once again promoting the traitor Yang Yu-tin who opened the road
 for the Japanese invasion of Jehol.  When Chiang Kai-shek went to the
 north, he waged no war against Japanese imperialism, but recognized the
 handiwork of his friend, the traitor Chang Hsueh-liang.

 The southwest government and the Fukien warlords alike have failed to
 oppose Japan or any other imperialists; their recent propaganda about
 "opposing Japan in the North" has been nothing but falsehoods designed to
 deceive the masses.   They are really intent upon expanding their own lands
 and attacking the soviets and the Red Army.
 Why does Chiang Kai-shek want to return to Kiangsi?  Why has he abandoned
 the northern armies, leaving them empty-handed against the Japanese
 artillery and aircraft?  Why have the KMT and their government concentrated
 large numbers of units, all their aircraft and military equipment to oppose
 the workers and peasants of Kiangsi?  Because they are now bargaining with
 Japan and all the imperialists to make China into their private possession
 and betray it utterly.  Because they hope that the Japanese and the other
 imperialists will allow them to become puppet rulers of a few provinces,
 as they did in the case of "Manchukuo."  Because they want to massacre the.
 Chinese masses in order to support imperialism and the rule of the Chinese
 landlord bourgeoisie.
 In order to cover up their surrender and treason, the KMT have fabricated
 the myth that Japanese imperialism is helping,the Red Army with money and
 ammunition, spreading the slander that the Chinese Soviet Government is
 holding talks with warlords.   This base and shameless rumor has already
 been shattered by many ironclad facts.
 The Chinese Soviet Government and the Worker-Peasant Red Army are the only
 mass political power and armed force opposing all imperialist invasions,
 and in repeated heroic combats, the Chinese Soviet Red Army has been
 shown to be constant in its stance to all imperialists; we are inseparably
 connected with the Japanese workers and peasants because they too are
 carrying on a heroic struggle in opposition to Japanese imperialism, and
 they too have been plundered, oppressed and massacred by the ruling class.
 But the Japanese imperialists and warlords are our common enemy.
 We are engaged in a struggle for the interests of the toiling masses of all
 China and for Chinese independence, unification and territorial integrity.
 At present we must wage war against Japan and the other imperialists, and
 we will overthrow anyone who opposes that war.
 We have complete faith that the struggle of the Chinese worker-peasant
 fighters and the heroic defense of the Red Army will be able to prevent
 imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek and the bankrupt KMT from realizing their
 plan to dismember China.
 In the last 3 months the workers and peasants of Kiangsi and their Red
 Army have smashed more than nine enemy divisions.   In several. battles
 they captured more than 30,000 men and weapons along with large amounts of
 military supplies and innumerable weapons.   About 10,000 troops from the
 KMT armies have already joined the Kiangsi Red Army of their own free will.

 The Red Army in Hunan, Hupeh, Honan and Szechwan have also been growing
 rapidly. From the proclamations of the commander of the 52nd division
 and the commander and staff of the 59th Division, recently captured in
 Kiangsi, it can be clearly seen how profound the disintegration of the KMT
 army is; they denounce the KMT and Chiang Kai-shek, express penitence for
 their own past crimes in opposing the Chinese workers and peasants and
 ask the fighters and officers of the White armies to stop their attacks
 on the Soviet areas, turn the guns around and attack the KMT traitors who
 are selling out our motherland.   In view of the recent great victories of
 the Red Army and the waverings of their front-line troops, as well as the
 hatred of the masses of the entire country, the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek
 and Wang Ching-wei now hope, by means of such arbitrary propaganda as
 "exterminating the communists is resisting the Japanese" and "no discussion
 of resisting the Japanese until the communists are wiped out" to hinder the
 revolutionization of the broad masses of fighters and to cover up their own
 treason and surrender.   But such deceit and threats cannot succeed.   Quite
 the opposite:   they only serve to further expose their wickedness.
 In view of the current situation and our victory it behooves us once again
 to transmit the proposal we made in January to smash the slander of the
 KMT regarding hindrance by the Red Army and the workers and peasants in
 the Soviets of an effective resistance to the Japanese.  We believe that if
 only we can actively oppose the invasion of the Japanese imperialists as
 we proposed before, it will immediately be possible, and accordingly we
 once again declare our proposal to the entire nation.  Under the following
 conditions the Chinese Red Army is prepared to conclude a wartime agreement
 with any armed units to oppose the Japanese imperialist attack:
 1.   That it immediately stop the attacks on the Chinese Soviet areas;
 2.   That it immediately guarantee the democratic rights of the masses
 (assembly, association, speech, publication, and demonstration, and the
 release of political prisoners);
 3.   That it immediately arm the masses and form armed militia units to
 guard China and win China's independence, unification and territorial
 integrity.  Every worker, peasant and fighter can understand that without
 the above conditions a victorious war against the imperialists is impossible.
 The KMT policy is bankrupt.   It is leading to the dismemberment of China
 and the further enslavement of China's masses, and it continues to increase
 the suffering, hunger and massacre of the masses.
 We call on all workers and fighters among the broad masses of the people,
 in the army and the militia, to intensify their work to make them accept
 our policy of national revolution.  We call upon all toiling masses to
 support us in defending China and the power of the people.

 LETTER TO RESPONSIBLE PERSONS IN SOVIETS AT ALL LEVELS ON THE SUMMER PLANTING
 22 April 1933
 [Text] To presidiums of the provincial county and district soviets, heads
 of land departments, chairmen of township soviets and all representatives:
 The spring planting is over.  Although good results have been obtained in
 some places, the results have been extremely bad in others.  A grave cir-
 cumstance is that the government presidiums. have neglected the spring
 planting, the land departments have shirked it, and especially in the means
 of mobilization we have become divorced from the masses.   Now it is already
 time for summer planting, and soon it will be time for the autumn harvest;
 if you fail again to make an effort and do not immediately change from
 your errors of the spring planting and assume a spirit of struggle to
 approach the summer planting, then the plan to increase harvest by 20
 percent in the interest of the masses and of the revolutionary war will be
 most gravely affected.  Accordingly, the central land department has
 printed an outline of the summer planting movement ("How To Lead the Summer
 Planting Movement," published by Red China) to distribute to you.   In this
 outline, the critical significance of the summer planting, its aims, its
 central tasks and the means of mobilizing the masses for it are pointed
 out.   In particular the concrete examples of Jui-chin and Wu-yang district
 are singled out--there they carried out a true "organized mobilization" and
 stimulated the peasant masses to an unprecedentedly high level of labor
 enthusiasm, achieving great results in the spring planting.  When you
 receive this outline, you should immediately convene all necessary meetings
 (the chairman of the county soviet and the head of the land department
 should convene a meeting of district chairmen and heads of land departments,
 the district soviet and its land department should hold a meeting of town-
 ship soviet chairmen and chairmen of poor peasant associations, the town-
 ship soviets should convene meetings of their respective assemblies, poor
 peasants and women's congresses, Red Guards and Young Pioneers and the
 youth groups and village masses) to explain the main points of the outline
 and discuss the ways of carrying it out in the locality.   The summer
 planting struggle of the revolution should immediately be spread to all
 red farm villages.   The provincial soviet need not convene meetings of
 the county soviets, but it should provide concrete and active leadership

 on the basis of this outline.   At least once a month the province should
 investigate the work of its counties and the county of its districts.
 The district should oversee its townships twice a month.   The central
 land department should during May send people to all the counties for
 preliminary investigation of your achievements in summer planting.
 Performance of the tasks of summer planting depends primarily on your
 correct and energetic leadership.  Comrades, all struggle for an all-
 around victory in summer planting!

 DIRECTIVE ON THE SETTING UP OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMY MINISTRY
 Directive No 10 of People's Committee of the Provisional Central Government
 28 April 1933
 [Text] To increase production in all trades in the soviet areas, to expand
 internal and external trade, to develop the national economy in the soviet
 areas and to smash the enemy's economic blockade, all of these are of the
 first significance amid the current acute development of the civil war.
 Accordingly the central Executive Committee has published its 19th order
 and has added a Ministry of National Economy to the central government
 and National Economy Departments at the provincial and county levels.
 Governments at all levels must reform their past errors of neglecting
 economic construction and must quickly launch the attack on the economic
 front.   Since the imperialist KMT carried out its fourth encirclement
 campaign against the soviets and the Red Army, and at the same time carried
 out a cruel economic blockade, owing to the correct leadership of the
 Communist Party and the soviets and the active attack of the Red Army and
 the masses, we have already gained an extremely great victory, but govern-
 ments at all levels must understand that our war with the imperialist KMT
 is a protracted and bitter struggle, and even if we entirely smash the
 fourth encirclement campaign and win initial victories in one or several
 provinces, we shall still need to devote an immense amount of effort to it.
 Winning a victory in economic construction, so as to improve the liveli-
 hood of the worker.-peasant masses, to whip up an even greater revolutionary
 fervor among the masses, and also to protect the needs of the Red Army
 in coordination with the entire war mobilization, all this has decisive
 significance for the victorious struggle.   Based on the above principles,
 governments at all levels must grasp several central tasks of current
 economic construction, such as the development of industrial and agricul
 tural production, grain redistribution, expansion of cooperatives, the
 setting up of an external trade office and the development of state-owned
 enterprises, and make them an actuality.   To carry on these activities,
 the people's committee has determined that the National Economy Departments
 at all levels shall carry out a provisional organizational guideline in
 which is specified the setting up of the most important organs of the
 National Economy Department, the planning office and the investigation and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 statistical office.   In addition, it is specified that before the various
 special administrative organs--agricultural department, industrial depart-
 ment, communications department, internal and external trade department--
 have been set up, their functions shall be performed wholly or in part
 by the Department of National Economy.  When the governments at all
 levels receive this directive and guideline, they must immediately set up
 the various organs as specified.  Some functions that were performed
 formerly under the control of the finance departments such as the office
 of grain redistribution, the cooperatives, the external. trade office, etc.,
 shall be relegated to the control of the Department of National Economy.
 The State Printing Plant which formerly was under the control of the
 Department of Education is also provisionally relegated to the Department
 of National Economy.   The Labor Reform Institutions, which were formerly
 under the control of the Department of Justice and the provincial and
 county judicial departments, shall now have their manufacture and instruc-
 tion sections relegated to the control of the Department of National
 Economy.   But the Communications Administration under the control of the
 Ministry of Interior shall only have its Transport Department relegated
 to the Department of National Economy, while its post, telegraphic and
 highway functions shall remain unchanged under its control.   The former
 provincial and county food departments shall be absorbed into the food
 section of the office of national economy.  Within the Department of
 National Economy at the various levels, people's economy committees shall
 be set up as planning and reconstruction organs.   The setting up of the
 organs of the national economy department at the provincial and county
 levels, and the duties of the personnel must quickly be reported to the
 central ministry of national economy.
 As to the regional authorities' programs for concrete leadership, these
 must be drawn up by an early date, and it is expected that the Ministry
 of National Economy will examine and approve them for execution.   It is
 so ordered.

 ON LIMITING SPECIAL DELIVERY LETTERS
 Order No 8 of the People's Committee,
 11 May 1933
 [Text]   In order to limit special delivery letters, the People's Committee
 of the Interior Department of the Central Government issued an order that:
 "Public and private letters which do not have a serious time sensitivity
 may not be sent special delivery."  Recent investigations of certain
 party organs and Red units have continued to turn up many cases of
 frivolous use of special delivery, as the case in the 5th subdistrict
 where a comrade had lost a fountain pen and sent a special delivery
 letter to investigate, also requesting his correspondent to answer by
 special delivery; and the comrade in the military department of the
 I-huang county soviet who asked for repayment of a private debt from a
 comrade in the Fukien military district, also by special delivery letter.
 A letter from a Ta-hsi-pa district committee member to a Huang-po district
 committee representative asking him to send him money was also sent special
 delivery.   This sort of frivolous use of special delivery hinders the
 work of the post office, hinders the true emergency work of special
 delivery, and especially hinders the delivery of military intelligence,
 wastes public funds; this sort of situation will not be allowed to con-
 tinue.  The People's Committee once again sternly circulates its order
 to all organs and all units to quickly forbid these practices among their
 personnel and it also lays down limitations as follows:
 1.   Special delivery letters of military organs are limited to reporting
 emergency information on the enemy and delivering urgent orders and
 communications.   No other messages may be sent special delivery.   They
 must bear the chop of the competent commander on the letter.
 2.   Among party departments, governments and mass organizations, they are
 limited as follows;
 a.   Hsien level organizations may send special delivery letters, but
 those at the district and township levels may not.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 b. The contents of special delivery letters must be strictly time
 sensitive, that is, the nature of the letter must be such that if it
 does not arrive in an extremely short time there will be an extremely
 bad effect upon all types of work.
 c. Special delivery letters shall be stamped on the outside by the
 party secretary for party departments, and the chairman for the governments
 (department heads may do so in the central government and chairmen or
 committee chairmen may do so for mass organizations).
 3.    The Security Office shall have the responsibility for investigation,
 and if it discovers disobedience to the above regulations, it shall change
 the letter in question to an ordinary letter and in addition shall report
 the sender to the cognizant apparatus at the next higher level for fitting
 punishment.
 We hope that organs at all levels and military units will strictly observe
 the above regulations and not again fail to adhere to them.  It is so
 ordered.

 have now been thoroughly been carried out by the KMT Nanking government.
 The content of the so-called "peace talks" is:
 1.   The Chinese armies are to retreat south of Peking-Tientsin, and south
 of Ch'ang-ch'eng shall be designated a buffer zone (i.e., a so-called
 "neutral zone"),
 2.   The Chinese side recognizes "Manchukuo" and "Mengkukuo
 3.   All militia activity and the development of all anti-Manchukuo forces
 shall be stopped and the militia and all anti-Japanese forces shall be
 disarmed at an opportune time,
 4.   The Chinese side undertakes to stop all anti,-Japanese activity.
 The "peace talks" have already succeeded.  In Peking, the representatives
 of Japanese imperialism, the top Chinese traitors such as Huang Ju and Ho
 Ying-k'an and the British imperialist mediator (Lambertson) are now
 celebrating their victory at a banquet.   Outside Peking, in Manchuria,
 Jehol, Chahar and Peking-Tientsin, the Japanese imperialists are continuing
 to use their artillery and aircraft to bombard and massacre the anti-
 Japanese militia, revolutionary fighters, and thousands upon thousands of
 peaceful inhabitants, in order to bring about "peace and order" of the
 colonial slaves under the rule of Japanese imperialism.

 Masses of all China!  Mongolia and Peking-Tientsin have finally been
 sold out by the landlord bourgeoisis KMT.  This is the content of the
 KMT's "protracted resistance," and the true nature of the KMT's "resisting
 and negotiating at the same time."  This is the KMT central government's
 "fixed policy."  The evil KMT with Chiang Kai-shek as its head criminal
 has thus shamelessly and brazenly offered up Manchuria and Peking-Tientsin
 with their tens of millions of square li of territory and their tens of.
 millions of people, to Japanese imperialism.   And it is even now preparing
 to recompense the British imperialists for their mediation with the vast
 regions of Tibet, Sikang and Sinkiang!
 Masses of all China!  We are the champion of the Chinese people and we
 will absolutely not permit the Japanese imperialists and all the other
 imperialists to invade a single inch of our territory; we will not allow
 the imperialists' running dogs the KMT to thus shamelessly and brazenly
 sell out China!  We shall assuredly unite, arm ourselves and expand the
 national revolutionary war.  With the force of the masses, 400 million
 strong, we will bring down imperialism and the imperialists' running
 dogs the KMT warlords, and first among them the KMT Nanking Government
 with Chiang Kai-shek as its chief criminal; only by a bloody struggle by
 the people of all China can we regain the land we have already lost and
 gain independence, liberation and territorial integrity for the Chinese
 people!
 The Central Government and Revolutionary Military Affairs Committee of
 the Chinese Soviet Republic have repeatedly proposed to the armed units
 who are attacking the soviet areas throughout China to draw up a wartime
 cooperation agreement under the following three conditions in order to
 oppose the invasion of Japanese imperialism:
 1.   Immediately stop the attacks on the Soviet areas;
 2.   Immediately guarantee the people's democratic rights;
 3.   Immediately arm the masses and set up armed militia to protect China
 and to win China's independence, unification and territorial integrity.
 But the KMT's answer to this call of the Chinese Soviet Government has
 been to make new surrenders and betrayals to the Japanese imperialism, to
 force the anti-Japanese fighters in the Northeast to retreat, to disarm
 the militia in the Northeast, and so suppress all anti-Japanese and
 anti-imperialist movements of the masses of all China, to organize new
 forces to attack our soviet areas, and to send large numbers of aircraft
 to bomb the toiling masses and the peaceful inhabitants within the soviet
 areas.
 Now every peasant, every worker, every fighter, every student and every
 revolutionary can see with his own eyes who are the traitors, who are the
 running dogs of imperialism!   If the KMT is not overthrown, China can only

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 perish, and the Chinese masses will sink into eternal slavery to imperialism!
 The Central Committee of the Chinese Soviet Republic calls upon the masses,
 of all China, the militia in the northeast, the anti-Japanese fighters in
 the northeast, all Chinese revolutionary students and intellectuals,
 independent tradesmen and all revolutionaries to join together and arm
 themselves, to reject all repression and massacre by imperialist police
 and KMT gendarmes, to struggle against Japanese imperialism's attack on
 China, to oppose the KMT government's sellout of China and to win libera-
 tion for the Chinese people.  The Central Government of the Chinese Soviet
 Republic is now engaged in a bloody war to completely smash the fourth
 encirclement campaign of imperialism and the KMT against the Soviet areas,
 is setting up extensive Chinese revolutionary bases and creating an iron
 Worker-Peasant Red Army a million strong.   It is preparing to collect its
 forces on the Yangtze to wage warfare directly against all imperialists.
 The Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic and its Worker-
 Peasant Red Army have already proved to the masses of all China in a
 protracted anti-imperialist and anti-KMT war, that only it is the anti-
 imperialist anti-KMT masses' own political power and only it can lead the
 masses of all China to overthrow Japanese imperialism and all imperialism
 and to overthrow the KMT government headed by Chiang Kai-shek which sold
 out China and all traitorous KMT warlords.
 Masses of all China!  Unite, arm yourselves, and together with the Central
 Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic expand the national revolutionary
 war and struggle to win back the lost territory in the Northeast, to defend
 China and to win complete liberation for the Chinese people.

 CARRY OUT AN EXTENSIVE AND PROFOUND LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
 Directive No 11 of People's Committee of the Provisional Central Govern-
 ment
 1 June 1933
 [Text]   There are now a large number of districts in the various soviet
 areas and especially in the central soviet area which have not thoroughly
 resolved the land question.   In the central soviet, these areas make up
 almost 80 percent of the area, with a population of more than 2 million,
 such as Jui-chin (excluding the Wu-yang district), Hui-ch'ang, Hsun-wu,
 An-yuan, Hsin-feng, Yu-tu (excluding Hsin P'o district), Lo-an, I-huang,
 Kuang-ch'ang, Shih-sh'eng, Chien-ning, Li-ch'uan, Ning-hua, Ch'ang-t'ing,
 and Wu-p'ing--in all 15 entire counties.  Large parts of Po-sheng, Sheng-
 li and Yung-feng and parts of Kung-lueh, Wan-t'ai, Shang-hang, Yung-ting
 and Hsin-ch'uan, as well as the districts of Chun-ts'un and Huang-t'ang
 in Hsing-kuo, all are places which have not thoroughly resolved the land
 question.   The peasant masses in these areas have not been extensively
 mobilized, and the remnants of feudal power have not been finally over-
 come; and in the soviet organs the mass organizations and the local armed
 units there are still a good many alien class elements engaging in hidden
 activity, and there are still a good many secret counterrevolutionary
 organizations in the localities engaging in activities subversive to the
 revolution.   For this reason, wartime mobilization and cultural and
 economic construction in these areas have fallen behind those in the
 progressive areas (almost all of Hsing-kuo, part of Sheng-li, Kan-hsien,
 Wan-t'ai, Kung-lueh, Yung-feng and Shang-hang; Huang-p'o and An-fu dis-
 tricts in Po-sheng; Hu-yang district in Jui-chin, and Hsi-nan district
 in Yung-ting).   The carrying out of a universal and profound land inves-
 tigation movement in these extensive areas, the development of an extremely
 high level of class struggle among the more than 2 million masses, and the
 final assault on and thorough destruction of feudal power are tasks which
 in the various soviets will not brook a moment's delay.   As for the
 concrete details of the carrying out of the land investigation movement,
 the People's Committee has determined as follows:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 1.   The governmental chairmen at the various levels are charged with
 using the greatest attention in leading the entire land investigation
 movement.
 2.   The land departments, the worker-peasant investigation departments,
 the judicial departments and the state political security offices and
 their agents at all levels are charged with devoting all their energies
 to directing the movement and thoroughly resolving land problems, reforming
 local soviets and wiping out counterrevolution in the countryside.   The
 people's committees of the central land department, the worker-peasant
 investigation department, the judicial committees, the state political
 security office, must devote their whole energy to directing the various
 subordinate organs in the thorough performance of the task.
 3.   The people's committee of the central financial department is charged
 with-directing financial departments at various levels in attacking feudal
 and.semi-feudal power by fining landlords and exacting contributions from
 rich peasants, and at the same time increasing state revenues.   The
 central people's military committee is charged with directing the military
 departments at the various levels in the land investigation movement,
 overhauling and expanding the local armed organizations, and mobilizing
 the masses to serve in the Red Army.   The central people's economic com-
 mittee is charged with directing the economic committees at the various
 levels in carrying out recovery and development of agricultural and handi-
 craft production, the development of cooperatives and the distribution of
 products and commodities within the development of the land investigation
 movement.   The central education people's committee is charged with
 directing the education committees at the various levels in supplying all
 sorts of simple and colloquial textbooks and booklets to all cadres and
 masses investigating land in order to develop the land investigation move-
 ment and expanding mass cultural education as the land investigation move-
 ment expands.
 4.  Governments at the provincial and county levels should summon cadres
 from the areas being investigated and from all progressive and relatively
 progressive areas to run brief land-investigation movement training
 classes.   The county soviets should convene a meeting of the district
 soviet responsible persons every month and the district soviet should
 convene a meeting of the township soviet chairmen and poor peasant
 association chairmen every 10 days to investigate the experience of land
 investigation.
 5.  Meetings of main responsible persons in the soviets at the district
 level and above in eight counties of Juirchin, Hui-ch'ang, Po-sheng, Yu-
 tu, Sheng-li, Shih-ch'eng, Ning-hua and Ch'ang-ning and meetings of poor
 peasant associations and electoral congresses in eight counties should be
 held at the central government to stimulate the land investigation move-
 ment in them.

 6.   Tn the course of the movement the class line should be persistently
 adhered to, taking the proletariat in the countryside as the leader and
 relying upon the poor peasants, resolutely uniting with the middle pea-
 sants to stage resolute attacks against feudal and semi-feudal power and
 ferret out all landlords and rich peasants masquerading as middle peasants
 or poor peasants, to confiscate all land and property of the landlord
 class and confiscate the land and excess draft animals, farm implements
 and dwellings of the rich peasants, and distribute them to workers, poor
 and middle peasants who previously did not receive enough land or received
 none at all; the rich peasants should be given relatively poor land to
 work.
 7.  In the land investigation movement thorough attention should be paid
 to mobilizing the majority of the masses to arise and struggle with the
 remnants of feudalism.  First, by means of extensive propaganda and
 agitation, a thorough investigation of people of landlord and rich-peasant
 origin should be made, and their land and property should be confiscated.
 This should be done with the agreement and participation of as large a
 majority as possible, and the confiscated property should all, with the
 exception of money, be given out to the poorest of the masses.   Special
 attention should be paid to giving it out to poor Red Army dependents
 and a larger share of it should be given out to the masses in the villages
 from whence the property came.
 8.   The poor peasants association is an extremely important mass organiza-
 tion in the land investigation movement, and the district and township
 soviets should strive to lead the poor peasants association in purging
 bad elements from within it and attracting large numbers of active ele-
 ments to join it.   The worker team within the poor peasant association
 should be the active leader of the poor peasant association.
 9.   In the land investigation movement, energetic attention should be
 concentrated on all backward districts, townships and villages, and
 especially in the most backward of them.   In developing the land investi-
 gation movement in backward districts and townships and particularly in
 large villages attention should be paid to mobilizing the impoverished
 masses to arise of themselves and struggle against the landlords and rich
 peasants of the village.   The utmost effort should be directed toward
 avoiding all incorrect activity involving struggles in areas with a single
 lineage.
 10.   In the land investigation movement all secret counterrevolutionary
 organs and activities should be purged and rumor-mongering and subversion
 by landlords and rich peasants should be prevented and exposed.
 11.   In-the course of the movement the local soviets should be reformed
 and all alien class elements and other bad elements should be cleaned out
 of them and large numbers of revolutionary activist elements should be
 attracted into the soviets.

 12.   All people in the soviets at all levels who directly or indirectly
 hinder the land investigation movement should receive severe or the
 severest punishment.
 Only by persistently implementing the above decisions can we broadly
 and profoundly develop class struggle in the countryside and whip up the
 activism of the broadest range of the masses, thoroughly destroy all
 feudal and semi-feudal power in the countryside and complete the task
 of the land investigation movement.  It is so ordered.

 their activities.  If the chairman or manager of the poor peasants'

 the township congress or poor peasants' league to form a "land investigation
 movement propaganda team."  After the poor-peasants' league delegates have
 left for the congress, the propaganda team will proceed separately to the
 villages and hamlets, call mass meetings, and explain to the masses that the
 Central Government, for the purpose of launching a mass movement to investi-
 gate land and the classes, is holding the Congress of the Poor Peasants'
 Leagues of the Eight Counties, that the township has elected so and so to,
 attend the congress, that all districts and townships of the county are
 sending delegates, that the masses must be prepared and pay attention to the
 landowners and rich peasants who misrepresented themselves as middle or
 poor peasants and received land allocations, that a vigorous investigation
 will begin when the delegate returns from the congress, and that the feudal
 power must be completely eliminated before the impoverished masses can gain
 their maximum interest. They must also explain that land investigation is
 not land redivision, that the masses must perform the investigation themselves
 and uncover the landowner and rich peasant elements misrepresenting themselves
 as middle or poor peasants, that only wher they are uncovered and knocked
 down will the impoverished masses gain liberation, and that our farm
 laborers and poor peasants must ally with all true middle peasants and the
 soviet will fully protect the interests of the middle peasants.   Such
 propaganda is to inform the masses that the congress of the poor peasants'

 leagues attended by the delegates of all districts and townships, including
 their own township, is for the purpose of launching a mass movement to
 investigate the classes in the 900 or more hsiangs of the eight counties,
 and to create a strong atmosphere of class investigation before the delegates'
 return.  Village and hamlet mass meetings may be held after sundown, and the
 township chairman must be responsible for their guidance.
 Responsible comrades of the county, district, and township soviets of the
 eight counties of Jui-chin, Hui-ch'ang, Yu-tu, Sheng-li, Po-sheng, Shih-ch'eng,
 Ning-hua, and Ch'ang-t'ing:  Attention must be given the following points
 for the complete success of the two meetings:   (i) The participants must
 all bring with them truthful reports.   (ii)  All the poor peasants' league
 delegates must be positive revolutionary elements, not negative compromising
 elements.   (iii)  All those required to attend must attend and arrive
 promptly on the specified day.   (iv)  General propaganda on the land investi-
 gation movement must be performed in all the hsiangs.  You must devote a
 great effort to these four points.  If they are not followed, the meetings
 will not be completely successful, and you must share the blame.  It is so
 announced.

 APPEAL TO THE MASSES OF JUI-CHIN, HUI-CH'ANG, PO-SHENG, AND SHIH-CH'ENG
 COUNTIES FOR 50,000 TAN OF GRAIN TO SELL TO THE RED ARMY
 [Text]   (1) During the fourth revolutionary war, after Chiang Kai-shek's
 White army in the North suffered several tragic defeats and the Red Army won
 several great victories, the Kuomintang warlords are mustering their remnant
 troops and preparing a new attack.  Meanwhile, Kwangtung's warlord Ch'en
 Chi-t'ang, Fukien's warlord Ts'ai Ting-k'ai, and Hunan's warlord Ho Chien
 are starting out together and moving their troops against the soviet areas.
 The Red Army is fighting bloody battles against the enemies and aiming at
 smashing the enemy encirclement campaign.  In another aspect, the Kuomintang
 conspired with Japanese imperialism to occupy Peking and Tientsin, and the
 Red Army is preparing to confront imperialism directly and knock down the
 imperialist Kuomintang at the same time.  However, in the Red Army at this
 time, a serious grain problem has arisen.  Some of the Red Army troops live
 on rice congee, and some of the Central Government organs must also have
 half of their meals in congee.   The price of rice is high, and it cannot be
 bought.  It is truly a difficult problem.  In addition, a part.of the
 extremely impoverished masses, especially the families of Red Army soldiers,
 have nothing to eat.  The situation is very serious.
 (2)  Is there no grain in the soviet areas?  No, the soviet areas have
 considerable amounts of grain.   Leaving aside Kung-lueh and Wan-t'ai,
 where grain is abundant, and taking, for instance, the counties of Jui-chin,
 Hui-ch'ang, Po-sheng, and Shih-ch'eng, we find that there is a surplus
 every year.   Though the harvest last year was inferior, there was still a
 large surplus.   Why is it that the Red Army cannot buy grain in these
 areas?  Primarily, it is due to the manipulation of the rich peasants and
 unscrupulous merchants.   They hide the grain, or raise the price much above
 the market, and deliberately make it difficult for the Red Army.  Next,
 the people with more grain still fail to understand the difficulties of
 the Red Army and want to wait for higher prices in the future.  Even those
 who have an average amount of grain do not understand the difficulties of
 the Red Army; therefore, they have not saved a part of their grain to sell
 to the Red Army.  With these two reasons, grain has become unavailable on

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020601-5
 the market.  Comrades, you do not understand the difficulties of the Red
 Army because the soviets of the various areas have never explained them to
 you.  Now the Central Government wishes to purchase 50,000 tan of grain
 from the counties of Jui-chin, Hui-ch'ang, Po-sheng, and Shih-ch'eng to
 supply the Red Army at the front.  It wishes to place the responsibility
 on the county, district, and township soviets and the 1 million people of
 the four counties.  The distribution is 16,000 tan from Jui-chin, 15,000
 tan from Hui-ch'ang, 12,000 tan from Po-sheng, and 10,000 tan from
 Shih-ch'eng.  However, this time it is not borrowing, but purchasing.
 According to our grain borrowing experiences of the past, the masses
 voluntarily loaned much grain to the Red Army, and many of them even
 returned to us the grain borrowing notes.  It indicated the tremendous
 revolutionary fervor of the masses.  It indicated that the masses regarded
 the life of the Red Army as their own and, the moment they heard of the
 need, they lent their grain.  But comrades, the Red Army has exhausted
 the grain borrowed in the past and the Central Government now wishes to buy
 grain.  The amount is 50,000 tan, at market price.  It is to be delivered in
 batches during the month of June.  In regard to the method, those with surplus
 grain will surrender the surplus and an additional amount saved by them.  Those
 without surplus will save some grain and surrender it.   Only those who do
 not have enough to eat and must depend on their relatives and friends for
 help do not have to sell to the government.  Comrades, we all hope that
 the Red Army will win.  Now that the Red Army fighting on.the front does
 not have enough to eat, can we set our mind at ease?  We must all eat more
 sundry grain and vegetables and save a part of the grain to sell to the Red
 Army.  As many driblets become a river, we believe that it should not be
 hard for the million population of the four counties to save 40,000 or
 50,000 tan of grain.  Comrades, as long as the Red Army on the front has
 enough to eat and wins battles, even if our masses in the rear eat a little
 less, it will be glorious and joyful!
 (3)  Another aspect of the grain problem also requires the attention of
 our broad masses.   It is the problem of the grain shortage of the extremely
 impoverished masses.  The majority of us must not allow them, especially the
 families of the Red Army soldiers, to go hungry.  Their difficulty must
 be solved by us all.  The method of solution is mutual help among the masses,
 first by selling grain at reduced prices, and next by borrowing in summer
 and repaying in the fall.   For the interest of the class, we must not
 consider ourselves only and ignore the others.   Those townships with more
 grain must help those with less grain.   Those villages with more grain
 must help those with less grain.   In a village, those households with.more
 grain must help those with less grain.   Besides selling 50,000 tan of grain
 to the Red Army, we must help the extremely impoverished masses.  Only thus
 are true class friendship and true class mutual help!
 Arise, all 1 million of the masses of the four counties!
 Sell 50,000 tan of grain to the Red Army!
 Help the impoverished masses by "price reduction" and "grain loans!"

 OPEN CABLE NEGATING THE TREASONABLE AGREEMENT SIGNED BY KUOMINTANG
 10 June 1933
 [Text]  Revolutionary People of the Whole Nation!
 On 31 May the Kuomintang government signed a North China cease-fire agreement
 with Japanese imperialism.   By this agreement, the vast area of North China
 and tens of millions of people are sold to imperialism, but it is only a
 part of the treasonable secret treaty published by the Kuomintang.  Though
 Wang Ching-wei and other traitorous ringleaders shamelessly claim that the
 agreement is only limited to military affairs and involves no politics,
 actually, what is even more serious is the unpublished large-scale
 treasonable secret treaty of the Kuomintang government.  According to
 information obtained by this government, the contents of the secret treaty are
 roughly as follows:   (1)  The Chinese army will retreat to the south of
 Peking and Tientsin and the area south of the Great Wall is designated as a
 buffer zone.   (2)  China recognizes "Manchukuo" and "the Nation of Mongolia."
 (3)  All activities of the Volunteer Army will be stopped and the Volunteer
 Army and all troops resisting Japan will be disarmed according to the circum-
 stances.   (4)   China  guarantees the cessation of all anti-Japan movements.
 The Soviet Provisional Central Government, representing the people of the
 whole of China, absolutely refuses to recognize the secret treaty and the
 North China cease-fire agreement, because they completely sell out the vast
 land of Manchuria, Mongolia, and North China and the national interest to
 Japanese imperialism and, doubtlessly, the Kuomintang will likewise concede
 to the demands of British and American imperialism, sell out the territory
 and rights of Tibet, Hsi-k'ang, and the Yangtze and Pearl river valleys,
 and follow its traitorous line of "equal opportunity" and "sharing of
 interests."  The Soviet Provisional Central Government of China appeals to
 the people of the entire China to rise together and resist the treasonable
 secret treaty and treasonable agreement of the Kuomintang and, by means of
 revolutionary struggles, including work strikes, school strikes, market
 strikes, mass demonstrations, and the people's own armed forces, oppose and
 block the implementation of any article of the secret treaty and agreement.
 The people of the entire nation must realize that, if the secret treaty and
 agreement are not resisted, the 400 million people will become forever the
 slaves of imperialism.   They must realize that only by arming themselves,

 knocking down the traitorous Kuomintang government, fighting imperialism
 directly, and ousting Japan and all imperialists before they can liberate
 themselves and avert the fate of slavery.  The Soviet Provisional Central
 Government declares that it is prepared to devote all its strengths, its
 spiritual, material, and armed strengths, to help the people of the entire
 nation resist Japanese imperialism and the traitorous Kuomintang, and it
 reiterates to all the armed units of the Kuomintang government that, under
 the condition of (1) immediate cessation of attacks on the soviet areas;
 (2) guarantee of the people's freedoms of assembly, association, speech,
 and publication; and (3) immediate arming of the people and creation of a
 volunteer army, the Soviet Central Government is willing to form a combat
 agreement with any armed unit of the Kuomintang and fight Japanese imperialism.
 Meanwhile, the Soviet Central Government wishes to point out that, while
 loudly clamoring against Japan and the cease-fire agreement, the traitorous
 Kuomintang warlords such as Feng Yu-hsiang, Ts'ai Ting-k'ai, and Ch'en
 Chi-t'ang are only trying to hoodwink the people.  Actually, some of them
 have already joined  Chiang Kai-shek for a desperate attack on the Red Army
 and the soviet, while others have become running dogs of Japanese imperialism.
 Their vociferous clamor against Japan and the cease-fire agreement is only
 a means for them to deceive the people and proceed with their treachery.
 Besides associating with imperialism to suppress the revolutionary people
 and revolutionary soldiers and vigorously attacking the soviet areas and the
 Red Army, they.have no other goal.  Revolutionary people and revolutionary
 soldiers of the entire nation:  Only the union of the people's own armed
 strength and the anti-Japanese soldiers with the people will we implement a
 true national revolutionary war and knock down Japan and all imperialists,
 and overthrowing the traitorous Kuomintang is the prerequisite to the
 victory of this war.  The Soviet Central Government of China appeals to the
 people of the whole nation and the revolutionary soldiers to rally under the
 banner of the soviet, unite with the Red Army, jointly overthrow the regime
 of the Kuomintang, the traitorous ringleader, defend the independence and
 territorial integrity of China, and strive for the thorough liberation of
 the nation!

 ON SOLVING THE GRAIN PROBLEM OF THE MASSES
 Order No 42 of Central People's Committee
 16 June 1933
 [Text]  Recently, grain supply has been short, and the price of rice rises
 every day.  In some individual areas, rice is not available even with money.
 Therefore, some of the people have no rice to eat, but live on vegetables
 and sundry grains, or even tree leaves and grass roots.  This has truly
 become a serious situation.  The reason is the hoarding by the rich peasants
 and the manipulation by the merchants; they deliberately make it difficult
 for the toiling worker-peasant masses.  The people with a grain surplus still
 follow the old concept of each one for himself, wait for higher prices
 before selling, and are completely indifferent to the hunger of the toiling
 worker-peasant masses.  This is entirely because they do not understand
 the momentous significance of class mutual help.  The people who have no
 surplus have not saved a part of their grain to sell to the toiling masses
 who are short of grain, especially the families of the Red Army soldiers,
 or to lend the grain to them according to the method of borrowing in the
 summer and repaying in the fall.   It is still more than a month before
 the new grain comes to the market.  During this long period, large volumes
 of grain are needed to relieve the people and the Red Army families.  To
 solve this problem, we want the governments of all levels to devote their
 full effort to the following work:
 1.   The government of the provincial level must promptly call all types of
 meetings, conduct enthusiastic and detailed discussions and, according to
 the actual situations of the counties, formulate its particular, systematic,
 and concrete plans for discussion and implementation by the lower level.
 2.   The county government must, according to the resolutions of the provincial
 soviet and the experiences of fending grain and saving grain to sell to the
 Red Army, call district and township delegates' meetings.   (Such meetings
 may be held in two locations if the distances are too great and the
 delegates too numerous).  Such meetings must include the chairman and the
 delegates of the poor peasants' league, labor union, and women's organization

 on the township level, and class mutual help must be explained to the
 delegates and active elements, so that they will make extensive and
 enthusiastic propaganda and stimulation when they return to their own
 districts and townships.  By so doing, we will activate the masses and raise
 their spirit of class friendship and mutual help to solve the current grain
 difficulty.  In areas suffering the greatest grain difficulty, we may use
 huang-chin, huang-ch'iu vegetable, t'ung-hao, hemp leaves, creeper bean,
 and bracken as food supplements.
 3.   The district and township governments must thoroughly implement the
 resolutions of the province and county on this issue, and guide the
 townships with more grain to help those with less, grain.  The villages with
 more grain must help those with less grain, and the households with more
 grain must help those with less grain, so that the soviet masses, under the
 significance of class mutual help, will break down the manipulation of the
 rich peasants and rice merchants and solve the difficulty of shortage
 between the green crops and the yellow harvest.
 It is hoped that the governments of all levels, upon receipt of this order,
 will strive to perform the task without neglect.  It is so ordered.

 REPORT AT THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT RALLY OF RESPONSIBLE PERSONS OF
 SOVIETS OF THE CH'U LEVEL AND ABOVE OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES
 [Text]   I.   The Land Investigation Movement Is the Momentous Central Task
 of a Vast Area
 As shown by all past experiences, only when the land issue is correctly
 solved and the flame of the rural class struggle raised to the maximum
 height under the firm class slogans will the broad peasant masses become
 activated and, under the leadership of the proletariat, join the revolutionary
 war and the soviet constructions of all aspects, build a firm revolutionary
 base, add a greater strength to the soviet movement, and strive for larger
 developments and victories.
 According to the experiences of the progress of the land revolution, the
 development of the rural class struggle has its corresponding stages.  The
 land struggle includes (1) the stage of confiscating and distributing
 land, (2) the stage of land investigation, and (3) the stage of land construc-
 tion.  According  to the three stages of the land struggle, three types of
 areas exist in any soviet region:   (1) area of intensive struggle, (2) area
 where the struggle lags  behind, and (3) newly developed area.
 In the newly developed areas, the land struggle is still in the stage of
 confiscation and distribution.  The central issue here is to overthrow the
 political power of the landlord class by force, build a revolutionary
 provisional political regime (the revolutionary committee), local worker-
 peasant militia, and revolutionary mass organizations, confiscate the land
 and assets of the landlord class and the land of the rich peasants, distribute
 the land to the farm laborers and poor and middle peasants, allocate the
 inferior land to the rich peasants, cancel the debts and burn the land
 deeds and loan agreements.  The struggle in this stage includes the entire
 period from the time when the revolution and the counterrevolution begin to
 join in battle to the time of the disposal of the land and assets of the
 counterrevolutionaries after the revolution has overcome the counterrevolu-
 tion.

 In areas where the struggle is intensive, a consolidated soviet political
 regime has been established, the local militia and the revolutionary mass
 organizations have been extensively developed, the feudal.and semi-feudal
 forces of the landlords and rick peasants have been completely subjugated,
 the land has been thoroughly distributed, and the struggle of the peasant
 masses on the land issue has progressed to the stage of land improvement
 and production development.  Therefore, the central issue here is land
 construction.
 In areas where the struggle has dropped behind, the development stage is                      A
 situated between the two stages discussed above.  The.period of provisional
 political power has progressed to the period of formal political power, but
 not yet completely consolidated.  The counterrevolutionary struggles of the
 landlords and rich peasants have been defeated by the revolutionary masses
 in the first period.  From that time on, many among them, with one shake of
 the body, took down their counterrevolutionary masks and donned the revolu-
 tionary masks, also supporting the revolution and land division and calling
 themselves impoverished peasants entitled to land allocation.  They were
 very active and relied on their historical superiorities, "articulate and
 literate."  Therefore, they stole the fruits of the land revolution during
 the first period.  The innumerable facts prove that they usurped the pro-
 visional political power, infiltrated the local militia, manipulated the
 revolutionary organizations, and acquired more and better land than the
 impoverished peasants.  By the time of the second period, as a result of
 supervision of the higher level government and the development of the mass
 struggle, the revolutionary committee was reorganized into the soviet, and
 the mass organizations and local militia were also initially reformed and
 developed.  A part of the spurious revolutionary elements were purged.   In
 many areas, the land was divided a second time, or even a third or fourth
 time.  A part of the land stolen by the landlords and rich peasants was
 repossessed.  Nevertheless, many class deviationists still remain hidden
 in the soviet mass organizations and local militia where they "hang out the
 red belt and address each other as comrades," where they create rumors and
 hold secret meetings, and where they revile the masses as "leftwing
 opportunism," "hitting the local tyrants indiscriminately," and "using the
 public to repay a private grudge."  Or, they "are most enthusiastic in
 expressing their opinions at meetings but do nothing afterward."  When
 the struggle is violent, they organize counterrevolutionary secret organiza-
 tions, such as the Kuomintang, the Social Democratic Party, the AB League,
 the New Communist Party, and all types of things, for the purpose of
 sabotaging the revolution and injuring the positive revolutionary elements.
 In general, the landlord and rich peasant class uses all kinds of means to
 suppress the mass struggle, protect their privileges in political power and
 in land and property, and defend their remnant feudal force.  In such areas,
 the revolutionary masses and the landowners and rich peasants are waging
 a severe struggle, except that, unlike the open struggle between the Red
 and White banners in the first period, it is a struggle between the revolu-
 tionary peasant masses and the landlord and rich peasant elements covered

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 by false masks.   Such struggle has its special difficulties.  The hidden
 counterrevolutionaries are unlike the open counterrevolutionaries whom the
 peasant masses can see at one glance. With the many types of deep-rooted
 rural feudal relations, such as the national relations, it is not an easy
 matter to raise the class awareness of the peasant masses and make them
 realize the necessity of the final destruction of the feudal remnants.
 Therefore, it is necessary for the Communist Party and the Soviet Government
 to explain patiently to the peasants, perform much arduous work, and follow
 the correct class line and mass work method.  Here, the central issue is
 land investigation and class investigation.  If this issue is not solved,
 the revolutionary positivity of the peasant masses cannot be developed to
 its maximum, the remnant feudal forces cannot be completely destroyed, the
 soviet cannot obtain its maximum consolidation, and such important tasks
 as expanding the Red Army, raising funds for it, enlarging the local
 militia, undertaking land and economic constructions, and developing culture
 and education', cannot attain the maximum success.  Therefore, the land
 investigation movement is the most central and most important task of these
 areas.
 Take the central soviet areas as an example:  The struggle is relatively
 behind in a large part of such areas.  The land issue has not been solved
 in the entire 13 counties of Hui-ch'ang, Hsun-wu, An-yuan, Hsin-feng, Lo-an,
 I-huang, Kuang-ch'ang, Shih-ch'eng, Chien-ning, Li-ch'uan, Ning-hua, Ch'ang-
 t'ing, and Wu-p'ing, the greater portion of the counties of Jui-chin, Yu-tu,
 Po-sheng, Sheng-li, and Yung-feng, a portion of the counties of Kung-lueh,
 Wan-t'ai, Kan-hsien, Shang-hang, Yung-ting, and Hsin-ch'uan, and even the
 districts of Chun-ts'un and Huang-t'ang in Hsing-kuo.
 The peasant masses of such areas have not been most extensively activated,
 and the feudal forces have not been finally overcome.  Many class devia-
 tionists are hidden and active in the soviet political regime, mass organiza-
 tions, and local militia, and many counterrevolutionary secret organizations
 pursue surreptitious activities in all areas to sabotage the revolution.
 For this reason, the war mobilization and economic and cultural construction
 of such areas lag far behind the advanced areas (almost the entire county
 of Hsing-kuo; a part of Sheng-li, Kan-hsien, Wan-t'ai, Kung-lueh, Yung-feng,
 and Shang-hang; Huang-p'o District of Po'sheng, Wu-yang District of Jui-chin,
 Hsin-p'o District of Yu'tu, and Ch'i-nan District of Yung-ting).  These
 backward areas constitute almost 80 percent of the central region and their
 masses number 2 million or more.   To launch a general and intensive land
 investigation movement in such vast areas, ignite the flame of the class
 struggle among the 2 million masses for a final battle with the faudal
 forces, and knock them down completely constitute the urgent task of the
 Communist Party and the Soviet Government.
 II.   The First Step of the Land Investigation Movement--Large-scale
 Organizational Mobilization
 How do we proceed with the land investigation movement?  First of all, it
 requires organizational mobilization.  As indicated by the experiences in
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 leading mass struggles in soviet areas, only when the Communist Party, the
 soviet, and the mass organizations take concerted action  under party
 guidance will we attain success in all our struggle tasks.  The land
 investigation movement is a cruel and violent class struggle, a great
 revolutionary mass movement, the fundamental improvement of the mass organiza-
 tion work of the party and the soviet, and the most important link in the
 current work.  Only when the entire party and the entire soviet labor union
 mobilize all their forces to join this movement will we activate, launch,
 and complete it.   In regard to the mobilization of the party, the Central
 Bureau has already issued a correct directive.  In regard to the mobilization
 of the soviet, the past error of considering. the land investigation the
 exclusive function of the land department must first be rectified.  Not only
 the finance, military affairs, national economy, and education departments
 considered themselves unrelated to the movement, but the worker-peasant
 procurators' department, the judicial department, and the political security
 bureau also thought that they did not have much to do with it, and even
 the presidiums paid no attention to it.  This is completely wrong.  We must
 understand that no part of the soviet may divorce itself from the movement.
 First, the government presidiums of all levels must devote their maximum
 attention to leading the movement.  Next, the land, worker-peasant procurators',
 and judicial departments and the national security bureaus of all levels
 and their special representatives must serve as the main leading and work
 units in the movement.  To thoroughly solve the land issue in the movement,
 reform the soviet of the township, district, and county, and purge the rural
 counterrevolution, the above-named government units must exert their
 maximum effort.  The finance department must attack the remnant feudal
 forces by fining the landlords and assessing donations from the rich
 peasants while increasing the state revenue.  The military affairs department
 must give attention to the rectification and expansion of the local militia
 in the land investigation movement and mobilize the positive elements
 among the masses to join the Red Army.  The national economy department
 must give attention to the recovery and development of agricultural and
 handicraft production, the growth of the cooperative, and the balancing of
 production and consumption in the development of the land investigation
 movement.  The education department is not without its duties.  It must, for
 the purpose of deploying the land investigation movement, supply some simple
 and popular texts and pamphlets to the land investigation cadres and the
 masses.  With the development of the movement, it must promote the culture
 and education of the masses.  As the largest majority of labor union members
 in the soviet areas are in the rural village and closely linked with the
 land, and as the land investigation movement is a great and violent class
 struggle, the proletariat must serve as the staunchest. leader.  Therefore,
 be they agricultural, handicraft, or other labor unions, they must, under
 the leadership of the National General Labor Union Executive Bureau,
 mobilize their best cadres and all rural members to participate in the land
 investigation movement.  The most important thing is to produce a motivating
 and encouraging effect in the poor peasants' leagues and make firm proposals
 on land investigation, class. investigation, and government reform.  In
 general, the land investigation movement is not a commonplace trivial task,
 and it cannot be thoroughly completed in a month, or even 6 months.  Therefore,
 the party, the league, the government, and the labor union must coordinate
 for a large-scale mobilization.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Here we will discuss the issue of educating the cadres.   First, a meeting
 of lower level responsible persons must be called and full explanations
 of the several major issues in the land investigation movement given them.
 So far, most of the soviet personnel of the various levels do not realize
 that the land investigation movement is an urgent task; they do not know
 how to distinguish the class classifications; they fail to understand the
 lines and methods of winning the masses and launching the struggles.
 Therefore, they have not been able to launch the movement.  Next, such
 education must also be conducted on the cadres transferred from the local
 lower level and from all advanced areas.  Short-term land investigation
 movement training classes must be held.  The provincial and county govern-
 ments must hold such training classes many times for the land investigation
 movement, lasting 1 to 2 weeks, and teaching specially the several major
 issues in the movement.  The land department, worker-peasant procurators'
 department, and political security bureau of the provincial, county, and
 district governments must each organize a group of work personnel (most of
 those of the district will remain on their jobs) and give them full education
 on land investigation work.  Thirdly, one type of education is conducted
 in action.   In other words, the provincial and county governments must send
 men out to inspect the work, and the district level must call a meeting of its
 own land investigation work personnel and township soviet and poor peasants'
 league chairmen every 5 to 7 days and inspect their work, because just the
 first two methods of education alone will not produce the maximum result.
 .III.   Launch the Land Investigation Movement according to the Development
 Situation of the Rural Class Struggle
 We mentioned in the first chapter that there are three types of areas in
 the soviet regions:
 (1)  Areas of intensive struggle;
 (2)  Areas where the struggle lags behind;
 (3)  Newly developed areas.
 Not just in the provinces, but some outlying counties have the same
 situation.  Yung-feng, for instance, has all three types of areas existing
 at the same time.   In the majority of the outlying counties, there exist
 the relatively backward and the newly developed areas.  As for the interior,
 generally the counties are entirely backward, but relatively advanced are
 also found.  Most of the districts in Hui-ch'ang, for instance, are backward,
 but Hsi-chiang District is relatively advanced.  The situation in Jui-chin
 is different.  Wu-yang District may be considered an area of intensive
 struggle; T'ao-huang, Huang-po, Sha-hsin, Jui-lin, Chiu-pao, Yun-chi,
 Tu-t'ou, and Ch'eng-shih, a total of eight districts are relatively advanced;
 the remaining six districts are lagging behind.  Nevertheless, regardless
 of which district in which county, as long as its soviet has been established
 and it has gone through the stage of land confiscation and division,
 usually relatively advanced and relatively backward villages are found.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Is there the situation of unbalanced development in a village?  It exists
 in many areas.  In many areas, the small villages (small hamlets) are
 advanced and the large villages (large hamlets) are backward.  In other
 areas, due to the difference in historical background, one may find that
 some individual large villages are advanced, while some individual small
 villages are backward.  Such a situation determines our work direction.
 When launching the land investigation movement in each of the counties,
 districts, townships, and even villages,-we must concentrate our maximum
 attention on the backward portions and devote our maximum effort to them.
 Equal treatment and equal effort are incorrect.  It is even more incorrect
 to shift the work direction to the areas which are easy to develop and
 ignore the difficult areas because of the difficulties of winning the
 masses and launching the struggle in the backward areas on ground that
 "it is impossible to fight one's way in."  In regard to the steps of the
 work, when it comes to a township, naturally we must start with the villages
 and hamlets which are easy to activate, but the center of our work plan
 must still remain with the backward villages and hamlets.  To eliminate
 the specially backward situation of a certain village or hamlet (temporarily
 "impossible to fight one's way in"), it is perfectly proper to start with
 the villages and hamlets which are easy to handle, thereby influencing the
 backward villages or hamlets, and activating immediately thereafter their
 struggles.  But when it comes to a county or district, it is different.
 When planning the land investigation movement of a county or district, we
 must vigorously attack the backward districts and townships to begin with
 and devote our secondary effort to the relatively advanced ch'us and hsiangs.
 The situation of unbalanced development produces another method, i.e.,
 mobilizing the cadres from the advanced areas to lead the land investigation
 movement in the backward areas.  While it is important to mobilize the
 cadres from Hsing-kuo and other most advanced areas to the backward areas,
 it is just as urgent to mobilize those of relatively advanced areas to the
 backward areas.  All advanced and relatively advanced areas must take the
 responsibility of guiding the backward areas, and all backward areas must
 emulate the advanced areas.  Only thus will the land investigation movement
 be rapidly deployed.

 CONCLUSIONS OF THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT RALLY OF RESPONSIBLE
 PERSONS OF SOVIETS OF THE DISTRICT LEVEL AND ABOVE OF THE EIGHT COUNTIES
 [Text]  After hearing the report of Comrade Mao Tse-tung, chairman of the
 Central Government, on the land investigation movement and 5 days of
 detailed discussions, the Land Investigation Movement Rally of Responsible
 Persons of Soviets of the District Level and Above of the Counties of
 Jui-chin, Hui-ch'ang, Yu-tu, Sheng-li, Po-sheng, Shih-ch'eng, Ning-hua, and
 Ch'ang-t'ing called by the Central Government from 17 to 21 June 1933, has
 profoundly understood the importance of the movement.  It feels that, in the
 great victories of the soviet movement, as the tens of millions of the
 masses in the soviet areas have established their own political power,
 confiscated the land of the landlord class for distribution to the peasant
 masses, and restricted the exploitation of the workers by the capitalists,
 and as the broad masses have aroused their positivity in the revolutionary
 victories, great achievements in the revolutionary war and the soviet
 construction have been made, innumerable enemy attacks repelled, the soviet
 areas expanded, and the vigorous development of the.soviet movement
 promoted.  All these have been a result of the correct leadership of the
 Communist Party and the Soviet Government and the positive support of such
 leaderhsip shown by the broad masses.  However, it does not mean that no
 serious problem exists in the soviet areas.  Precisely because of the
 vigorous development of the soviet movement that the class enemies within
 and without the soviet areas are insanely waging their desperate struggle
 and resistance.  Outside the soviet areas, the enemies resort to military
 attacks.   Inside, they follow another pattern.  The landlords, rich
 peasants, and class deviationists conceal their true counterrevolutionary
 nature and utilize the opportunities in many soviet areas where the land
 issue has not been completely solved.  Many among them still possess certain
 economic bases, such as the many landowner elements whose land and assets
 have not been completely confiscated and the many rich peasant elements who
 have been allocated good land.  Many of them also have infiltrated the soviet
 organs, mass organizations, and the local militia.  They abuse the prestige
 of the soviet, suppress the development of the mass struggle, deceive,
 bribe, and threaten a part of the masses, spread rumors, organize secret

 societies, falsely accuse and injure the positive work personnel of the
 soviet, and pursue all types of conspiratorial and disorderly activities.
 Such a situation is actually discovered frequently in many.areas of the
 central soviet regions.  The Rally of the Eight Counties feels that this is
 a serious problem.  To destroy finally the remnant feudal forces, thoroughly
 solve the land issue, and consolidate the soviet political power, an exten-
 sive and intensive land investigation movement must be launched.  The
 Rally of the Eight Counties feels that the land investigation movement is
 actually a cruel and violent class struggle, a great mass revolutionary
 movement, and the most important link in the current work.  Therefore, the
 land investigation movement requires a large-scale organizational mobiliza-
 tion, firm implementation of the class line, and patient and.complete mass
 work.  The Rally unanimously supports the order of the Central Government
 on the land investigation movement and fully subscribes to the following
 conclusions.
 I.  Organizational Mobilization
 1.  All units of the government must take concerted actions.  Not only the
 land, worker-peasant procurators', and judicial departments, and the
 political security bureau must shoulder the main responsibility of the land
 investigation movement, but the finance, military affairs, national economy,
 and education departments must also perform all items of necessary work in
 the movement, while the government chairman and the presidium must serve as
 the leaders of the entire movement.  To feel that it is only the function of
 the land department is wrong.
 2.  The county, district, and township levels must all organize land investi-
 gation committees, under the governments of the various levels and in charge
 of the general leadership responsibilities of the movement.  In addition to
 the responsible persons of the government, the committee members must also
 include the personnel of mass organizations.
 3.  The county soviet must immediately formulate a countywide land investi-
 gation movement plan for July.  Thereafter, the land investigation movement
 plan for the following month must be formulated at the end of each month.
 4.  The district soviet must call a meeting of the chairmen of township
 soviets and poor peasants' leagues and formulate a plan for the work of the
 first 7 days.  Thereafter, there must be plan formulation and work inspection
 every 7 days.  Nevertheless, for those townships which are too far away,
 the parties concerned may attend the meetings at the district soviet every
 14 days.  For those townships which are not too far away, the parties
 concerned must attend the meetings every 7 days, in order to promote the
 rapid development of the land investigation movement.   .
 5.  In regard to the mobilization pattern of the township level, attention
 must be given to the following:   (1) the township congress, (2) the labor

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 union, (3) the poor peasants' league, (4) the women's congress, (5) the
 Red Guard and Young Pioneers, (6) other revolutionary organizations, and
 (7) village and hamlet mass meetings.  Only through such organs, organiza-
 tions, and mass meetings will the maximum strengths be mobilized into
 the land investigation movement.  Any method tending to reduce. the sphere,
 seeking convenience without regard to the majority of the masses, is
 incorrect.
 6.  The county soviet must hold a land investigation movement training
 class which will include one person from every township and continue for
 10 days.  Then a second training class must be held, also including one
 person from every township.  The most positive elements among the township
 soviet congress, poor peasants' league, and labor union will be selected
 for training and afterward returned to their original townships to lead the
 J    movement.  However, those from the advanced districts and townships must
 be sent to the backward districts and townships to work.  There must be two
 classes every month during the 3 months of July, August, and September.
 The provincial soviet must select the positive elements from the advanced
 counties and districts to hold a land investigation movement training
 class and send the graduates to lead the movement in the backward counties
 and districts.
 7.  For the success of the land investigation movement, the organization
 of the government departments must be immediately made sound, mainly by
 eliminating double-duty and the habit of frequent transfers and adding the
 required work personnel.
 8.  The township level must organize a confiscation division committee,
 elected by the poor peasants' league and serving under the township soviet,
 and in charge of confiscating the land and assets of the landlords and rich
 peasants.
 II.   Implementation of the Correct Class Line in the Land Investigation
 Movement
 1.    Relying on the poor peasants, allying with the middle peasants, and
 enabling the farm laborers to produce a leadership effect in order to
 completely eliminate the landlord class, block the rich peasants from
 stealing the land benefits of the revolution, and weaken their economic
 hold constitute the correct class line and struggle strategy which must
 be firmly followed in the land investigation movement.  In regard to allying
 ?    with the middle peasants, it must be started from respecting the interests
 of the middle peasants.  Without the consent of the parties concerned, the
 land of the middle peasants (including the well-to-do middle peasants)
 must not be divided.  At the beginning of the land investigation, the
 policy of allying with and respecting the interests of the middle peasants
 must be generally propagandized.  In the process of land investigation, the
 borderline cases between middle and rich peasants must be determined
 carefully, without any mistake.  In dividing the confiscated land and assets,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 attention must be given to the middle peasants and the individual
 impoverished elements among them must not be left out.  In regard to enabling
 the farm laborers to produce a leadership effect, mainly it is by urging
 them to join the poor peasants' league and form a farm laborers' cell, in
 order to rally the positive poor peasant elements through them, develop
 the poor peasants' league, and hasten the progress of the land investigation
 movement.  When dividing the confiscated land and assets, the farm laborers
 must be given priority.
 2.  Correctly analyzing the class classifications from the actual social
 relations is an important part of implementing the class line.  The errors
 on this issue committed in the past must be promptly rectified.  All actual
 class classification problems must be solved according to the criteria set
 forth in "How To Analyze the Classes."  The criteria must be widely
 explained among the masses, primarily the cadres.
 3.. The goal of land investigation is "class investigation," not land
 redivision.  The idea that land investigation requires "staking" is incorrect.
 Only after the conclusion of the cruel struggle of class investigation and
 when the majority of the masses demand the redivision of certain individual
 parcels will redivision be permitted.  Such strict distinction is not only
 for the purpose of stabilizing the land ownership of the peasants, so that
 they will not be alarmed over the "uncertain land division," but also for
 the success of the "class investigation" struggle when we must concentrate
 our entire force (especially allying with the middle peasants) against the
 resistance of the landlords and rich peasants.  At this time, there must
 not be any dissension in the peasants' own ranks.
 4.  All possible clan and local disputes must be avoided, and all forces
 united to deploy the struggle against the landlords and rich peasants.
 Therefore, activating the impoverished masses of the particular village and
 the particular clan to clarify the landlords and rich peasants of the said
 village and the said clan is an important strategy of the land investigation
 movement.  Similarly, the struggle to break down superstition (though proper)
 must be subordinated to the "class investigation" struggle.
 III Mass Work
 First of all, we must rectify the neglect of winning the majority of the
 masses in many areas and the bureaucraticist and commandist work pattern.
 We must understand that only by patient and arduous work to activate and win
 the masses will we gain the support of the majority, bring out their
 maximum positivity, and attain the goal of the complete destruction of the
 feudal remnants.   Such mass work is the only guarantee %to the implementation
 of the class line and must be manifested in the following practical actions
 in the land investigation movement.
 1.  The start of the land investigation movement must be widely propagan-
 dized in all the villages and hamlets, and the necessity of the movement
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 explained to the masses.  Land investigation is class investigation, not
 land redivision; class investigation is not an encroachment on the middle
 peasants.  It is especially important to explain the distinctions among
 the landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants to the masses.  Village
 and hamlet mass meetings must be held more than once.  The most backward
 villages and hamlets, especially, must hold more meetings, so that our
 land investigation movement propaganda will reach every member of the
 revolutionary masses.  To attain this goal, we must first explain the
 movement clearly to the positive elements of the township congress, labor
 union, poor peasants' league, laboring women's congress, and other mass
 organizations and generally and intensively propagandize to the broad masses
 through them.
 2.  After collecting the reports on the classifications of the landlords
 and rich peasants, the actual investigation must not be performed by only the
 few persons of the land investigation committee.  The positive elements of
 the township congress, poor peasants' league, and labor union must be
 activated to investigate from all sides, uncover and prove to the masses
 the many complex exploitations and evil activities of the landlords and
 rich peasants, and disprove the erroneous reports involving the middle
 peasants.
 3.  After the poor peasants' league has passed on the classifications of
 the investigated landowners and rich peasants, they must be passed on by
 the township soviet and approved by the district soviet.  During the process,
 attention must be given to all the interference and resistance of the landlord
 and rich peasant elements hidden in the poor peasants' league and the soviet.
 In regard to them, they must be severely attacked.  Meanwhile, attention
 must be given to the erroneous classification of the middle peasants.  Before
 confiscation, mass meetings must be held in the village and hamlet of the
 party concerned and the consent of the masses obtained after detailed
 explanation.  In the past, for the sake of convenience, many areas overlooked
 such procedure at mass meetings and caused the dissatisfaction of the
 masses, or even serious clan or local disputes.   Such error must not be
 repeated hereafter.
 4.  In regard to the confiscated property, except cash or its equivalent
 (such as gold and silver jewelry) which must be surrendered to the finance
 department, all items must be distributed to the impoverished masses.  The
 erroneous practice of delivering all confiscated property to the government
 found in many areas in the past must be thoroughly rectified.  When
 distributing property, a larger portion must be given to the masses in the
 village where it is located, in order to win their satisfaction.  The
 grain confiscated at the time of fall harvesting or not long thereafter
 may, with the consent of the masses, be temporarily stored for distribution
 to the impoverished masses in the following spring and summer. However,
 when the masses demand distribution, it must be immediately distributed.
 In regard to the confiscated land, besides reserving the public enterprise
 field and the Red Army public field, it must all be distributed to those who

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 have been allocated no, or inadequate, land.  The distribution or property
 and land must be prompt; there must not be a long delay after confiscation.
 Mass meetings must be held when distributing land and property and lists
 posted so that everyone will be informed.
 5.   Winning the backward villages and hamlets, especially the large
 villages, is the important task of many areas.  Therefore, attention must
 be given the following points:  (1)  The impoverished masses of the particular
 village must be activated and its landlords and rich peasants clearly
 investigated.   (2)  Many mass meetings to "discuss the classes" must be held.
 (3)  The positive elements must be located and trained properly, even if there
 is only one of them; the local masses must be contacted through them in order
 to develop the poor peasants' league and launch the local class struggle.
 (4)  In areas where the situation is specially serious, the reactionary
 elements blocking the struggle must first be arrested, tried at public
 trial mass meetings, and, with the approval of the masses, executed by
 shooting, and the mass struggle immediately launched thereafter.   (5)  In
 areas where there have been clan wars, "unity agreements" must be signed at
 the meetings of representatives of the two clans, which must mutually
 admit their past errors and agree to replace the clan war with the class
 struggle.  All the foregoing are the necessary methods to win the backward
 villages and hamlets, especially the large villages.  Here, we must oppose
 the capitulation of the large villages out of fear, the commandist method
 of severance from the masses, the opportunist laissez-faire toward the
 reactionary elements, and the clan, border, and local disputes.  Only thus
 will we win over the revolutionary masses of all the backward villages and
 eliminate the feudal remnants in such villages.
 6.  The poor peasants' league is an organization which produces a great
 effect in the land investigation movement.   In some areas where the league
 is in name only, without substance, it must be organized immediately.   In
 areas where it has been organized, its positive elements must be immediately
 rallied, its backward elements won over, and the class deviationists and
 other evil elements which have infiltrated it firmly purged.  Dissolving
 and reorganizing the entire league must be avoided as much as possible.
 Such a commandist method of dissolving the league just because a meeting
 cannot be convened after one or two attempts is completely incorrect.
 Superior propaganda and stimulation must be used to attract the positive
 elements to the meetings.   Even when only a minority comes, a meeting must
 be held, in order to develop the membership.  The league must include all
 the rural worker masses who are willing to join, and a worker cell must
 be formed in the league. to produce a motivating and leadership effect.  The
 middle peasants must not join the poor peasants' league, but they may be
 invited to the meetings as observers, especially when passing on the class
 classifications.  The three-member managers' committee of the poor peasants'
 league must be changed to a five-member committee, a chairman elected among
 them, and small groups formed below them, consisting of 5 to 15 persons
 according to their residences.  In regard to poor peasants' league meetings,
 when the land investigation movement is tense, a meeting may be held once
 every few days; after the conclusion of the movement, meetings may be held
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 according to the regular schedule.  Nevertheless, when it comes to frequent
 meetings, consideration must be given to the feelings of the membership
 masses, and any coercion is detrimental.  Before each meeting, the township
 soviet chairman must direct the poor peasants' league committee to make full
 preparations of the agenda.  Unprepared meetings are the worst habit.
 During the land investigation movement, the district soviet must call a
 meeting of the poor peasants' league chairmen every 7 or 14 days to discuss
 such issues as how to make sound the organization of the league and how to
 lead the struggle.  When necessary, a provisional districtwide poor
 peasants' league congress may be called.
 IV.  Reform of the Soviet
 1.  Reforming the unsound soviet organs in the land investigation movement and
 turning them into soviets representing the interests of the workers and
 peasants and possessing full working capacities constitute an important
 task at the present time.
 2.  Reforming the local soviet organ includes two aspects:  Purging the
 undersirable elements and attracting the positive revolutionary elements.
 On purging the undesirable elements, the worker-peasant procurators'
 departments of the county and district must shoulder the main responsibility.
 In regard to the method, with the development of the "class investigation"
 struggle, a prosecution committee is organized on the township level to
 embark upon prosecution.  The township prosecution committee must include
 two members of the labor union, five of the poor peasants' league, two of
 the women's congress, one of the youth league light riders' team, and one
 from the Young Pioneers.  The committee elects two chairmen among themselves
 and serves directly under the worker-peasant procurators' department.  The
 target of prosecution consists mainly of the class deviationists infiltrating
 the township congress and elements which are completely severed from the
 worker-peasant interests and have capitulated to or compromised with the
 landlords and rich peasants.  The method of prosecution is as follows:
 First, the names .and crimes of such elements are listed and posted for the
 opinions of the masses of the entire township.  Next, after collecting the
 opinions of the masses, the committee reaches a conclusion.  Thirdly, the
 conclusion is submitted to the township soviet congress for discussion and
 for approval of dismissal.  Fourthly, after reporting to the district
 soviet worker-peasant procurators' department and with the approval of the
 district soviet presidium, the dismissals are announced to the masses of
 the entire township in the name of the worker-peasant procurators' depart-
 ment.,y:w the prosecution movement, the shock troops of the worker-peasant
 procurators,=Oopartment, the correspondents, and the accusation box must be
 put in full action.  Those with the most serious crimes must also be tried
 at mass trials and delivered to the judicial department for handling
 according to law.  The significance of prosecution and public trial is
 that, while purging the undesirables in the soviet, the broad masses
 receive an education so that they will understand the necessity of purging
 the undesirables from the soviet and supervise and support the soviet.  As
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 a result, no such undesirable elements will continue to be found in the
 soviet. Prosecutions and public trials must not be expanded to include, as
 in the past, those who are not very positive or those who have only made
 minor errors.   In regard to such elements, mainly we must win them over by
 criticism and stimulation.  Before a public trial, full propaganda must be
 made to the masses, explaining the crimes of the culprit, in order to
 prevent him from deceiving a part of the backward elements and causing
 trouble at the meeting ground before the trial.   In areas where there are
 clan, house boundary, or village boundary disputes, public trials must not
 be held lightly.  Only when all such nonclass struggles are cleared away
 and the masses find it necessary will a public trial be held.
 The prosecution of the undesirables in the district and county soviets must,
 under the gudiance of the worker-peasant procurators' department of the same
 level, be performed by means of a prosecution committee organized by
 representatives elected by the mass organizations and the medium and lower
 level work comrades (from section chiefs down to cooks) of the same level.
 The procedure and contents of prosecution are roughly the same as those of
 the township discussed above.  In regard to the soviet prosecution movement
 launched along with the development of the land investigation movement, the
 higher level government presidium and worker-peasant procurators' department
 must guide the lower level with plans, inspect its work from time to time,
 promptly correct the errors, and collect the concrete experiences for the
 education of the lower level government presidiums, worker-peasant procurators'
 departments, and their prosecution committees.
 3.  In regard to attracting the positive elements into the soviet, the town-
 ship level must first call a voters' mass meeting to elect the bravest and
 staunchest elements in the land investigation struggle to the township
 congress and fill the vacancies of the purged undesirables.  Advance
 preparations must be made for such elections.  Several to a dozen or more
 substitute representatives may be elected, and it is especially necessary
 in areas where many new positive elements are emerging, in order to gradually
 replace the backward representatives who are not completely satisfactory.
 The next point is to absorb large groups of new positive elements into the
 various committees under the jurisdiction of the township soviet, such as
 the land construction, forestry, water conservation, and education committees,
 in order to make such committees truly stabilized and functioning.  The
 third point is to make it possible for the majority of the positive elements
 in the land investigation struggle to be elected into the township soviet
 in the general election of the entire soviet area in the fall this year.
 On the district level, in the soviets where there are only a few undesirables
 in the district executive committee, the functions of the purged members may
 be taken over by the good elements, and the positive elements in the township
 soviets must be promoted to the district soviet.  In individual areas where
 the undesirables constitute a large portion of the district executive
 committee, the county soviet must send men to hold a districtwide provisional
 congress during the land investigation movement and reelect the district
 soviet.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 In regard to the substitute personnel of the county level, there are the
 methods of replacing the bad with the good in county executive committee
 and selecting and promoting the good elements in the district and township
 soviets to work on the county level.
 V.  Elimination of the Counterrevolution
 1.  The government organs of all levels and the entire system of the state
 political security bureau must pay serious attention to all the activities
 of the counterrevolutionary organizations of the hidden landlords and rich
 peasants and the individual elements of all areas and fundamentally eliminate
 them in the land investigation movement.  The political security bureau of
 the provincial, county, and district levels and its special representatives
 must especially mobilize all their strengths to perform the work of eliminating
 the counterrevolution, and the error of overlooking counterrevolutionary
 activities in many areas in the past must be rectified.
 2.   Eliminating the counterrevolution in the land investigation movement is
 mainly  by guiding the masses to submit information in conjunction with the
 class investigation mass struggle, following the thread of the counter-
 revolution, and arresting the counterrevolutionary elements.  During the
 period of the land investigation movement, the special representatives of
 the district security bureau have the authority to make arrests.  After
 pretrial questioning by the special representatives, the culprits are
 delivered for trial at the district judicial department.  In case of important
 culprits, mobile courts must be organized in the hsiang and village of their
 residences for public trial in the presence of the masses and on-site
 execution with their approval.  This will stimulate the hatred and vigilance
 against the counterrevolution.  The practice of arresting the culprits and
 delivering them to the county soviet followed in some areas in the past,
 thereby ignoring the wrath of the masses against the counterrevolution and
 failing to take the opportunity to educate the masses to exercise continuous
 vigilance against the counterrevolution, is undesirable.  To attain the goal
 of eliminating the counterrevolution, the techniques of detection, arrest,
 trial, and imprisonment must be greatly improved.
 VI.  Attacking the Landlords and Rich Peasants With Fines and Donations
 To fundamentally eliminate all the economic bases of the landlords class
 and weaken the economic hold of the rich peasants, it is very necessary to
 attack them by means of imposing fines on the landlords and assessing
 donations from the rich peasants.  In view of the fact that the majority,
 or the greater majority, of, the landlords and rich peasants of many areas
 in the eight counties have not been uncovered, we should be able to raise
 800,000 yuan in the months of July, August, and September.  The county and
 district finance departments must devote their maximum effort to this matter.
 The main method is to direct the township soviet to mobilize the farm
 laborers' unions, poor peasants' leagues, and other mass organizations,
 which will make surveys of the assets of the landlords and rich peasants,
 -   Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 decide on the suitable amounts of fines or donations, and strongly urge them
 to pay. Here, the middle peasants must not be involved.  As for the rich
 peasants and landlords, a distinction must be made.  In other words, the
 landlords must be eliminated, while the rich peasants are weakened.
 VII.  The Relationship Among the Land Investigation Movement, War Mobiliza-
 tion, and Economic and Cultural Construction
 1.  In the success of the land investigation movement, it is entirely
 feasible to raise 80,000 Red Army troops in the eight counties.  It will
 not take long either.  It is only necessary to launch an extensive and
 intensive land investigation movement in July, August, and September.  When
 the broadest masses of the eight counties are all activated, it is entirely
 feasible to mobilize 80,000 new soldiers to the frontline from the eight
 counties in 6 to 10 months.  Therefore, the task hinges mainly on the
 development and intensification of the land investigation movement.  If
 our effort is not devoted to the land investigation movement, but only to
 the expansion of the Red Army, then we will not succeed, because it was the
 fundamental reason for the inadequate achievement of the eight counties in
 the past when expanding the Red Army.  We must have a profound understanding
 of this point.
 2.  In the success of the land investigation movement, one of the important
 tasks at the present time is for the eight counties to generally develop
 cooperatives, mainly those of consumer goods, grain balancing, necessary
 production tools (mainly farm tools), and loans to the impoverished masses,
 in order to resist the cruel exploitation of the broad masses by the specula-
 tive merchants. and develop the economy of the entire soviet area against
 the enemy blockade.  The great organizational strengths of the soviet and
 the masses and large sums of capital are needed to wage this battle on the
 economic front rapidly and extensively.  Therefore, a suggestion has been
 made to the Central Government to issue 3 million yuan of public bonds to
 be paid in grain, in order to perform the work promptly.  The completion
 of this work likewise hinges on the success of the land investigation
 movement.  If a great effort is not devoted to the land investigation
 movement and the great majority activated to join the economic construction,
 it will be impossible to fulfill the task.
 3.   Fall harvesting and fall cultivation, the two major undertakings, are
 close at hand.  They constitute the fundamental crux of the people's living
 and the revolutionary war.  Therefore, we must, in the land investigation
 movement, strive for their complete success this year.
 4.   The extensive development of the culture and education movement also
 can only be realized in the success of the land investigation movement.  In
 regard to instances such as one club per 1,000 population, one elementary
 school per 500 population, one night school per 100 population, and the
 great majority of those 16 years of age and above enrolled in the literacy
 classes, when the great majority of the masses have become positive, it is
 not difficult at all to accomplish.  Currently, Hsing-kuo has almost generally
 reached.such a standard.  It is an excellent example.

 VIII.  Enemy Attack
 In the enemies' fourth "encirclement and suppression" of our central soviet
 areas, though our courageous Red Army has basically defeated Chiang Kai-shek's
 main force on the northern front, the enemies are still attacking us.  While
 their disintegration intensifies day by day and they have innumerable other
 difficulties, they never forget to attack us.  Currently, the enemies in
 Kwangtung have advanced to Hsun-wu and An-yuan, and those in Fukien still
 maintain a strong position in Shang-hang, Lien-ch'eng, and Ch'ing-liu. These
 constitute a great threat to the eight counties-and their vicinities.  To
 eliminate fundamentally such enemy forces and expel their remnant. troops,
 besides the courageous Red Army, we must mainly rely on a broad mass
 warfare, and there is still the urgent fighting task of the land investiga-
 tion movement.  In face of the enemies pressing in on us, not only must
 we not relax on the land investigation movement, but we must double our
 effort to deploy it.  We must, in the movement, strive to make positive
 and arm millions of the masses, eliminate the remnant forces of the landlords
 and rich peasants serving as the enemies' fifth columnists, and build an
 ironclad soviet.  Then, our victory over the enemies will be fully assured.
 IX.  Supporting the Second All-Soviet Congress With the Success of the Land
 Investigation Movement
 The land investigation movement must be thoroughly completed before the
 Second All-Soviet Congress on 11 December.  Therefore, the work in July,
 August, and September must be intensified.  An inspection mass meeting of
 the land investigation movement of the eight counties must be held in
 October.  When the Central sends men to the various counties for mobile
 inspection in August, concrete achievements must be manifested.  To hasten
 the progress of the movement, the eight counties have voluntarily formed
 land investigation movement competition agreements and are struggling for
 their full performance.
 V.   Severely Punishing Those Sabotaging and Resisting the Land Investigation
 Movement
 In the cruel struggle of the land investigation movement, the class
 deviationists and other most evil elements infiltrating the soviet will
 inevitably sabotage or resist it.  Such elements must be severely punished
 according to the order of the Central Government on the land investigation
 movement.  At the rally this time, which is under the direct leadership of
 the Central Government, when all those attending the rally unanimously
 supported the policy of the Central Government on the movement and enthusi-
 astically discussed the work, land department chief Huang Yen-p'an of
 Ho-k'ou ch'u, Ning-hua, actually expressed his fundamental opposition to
 the movement.  He was severely criticized and attacked by the small group
 meeting and the rally.  But from beginning to end, he refused to admit his
 mistake.  The rally felt that he took the standpoint of the class enemies to
 resist the land investigation struggle of the broad masses and completely

 desecrated the functions of the soviet.  :It suggested to the Central
 Government to dismiss him from his post as land department chief and deliver
 him to the Ning-hua county soviet to have his activities supervised.  Only
 when such most evil elements are purged will the revolutionary ranks be
 rectified, the sabotage and resistance of all class enemies overcome, and
 the great revolutionary task of the land investigation movement completed.

 HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE THE CLASSES
 June 1933
 [Text]  1.  What Is a Landlord?
 A landlord is a person who possesses land (regardless of the amount), performs
 no, or only incidental, labor, and relies solely on exploitation for his
 living.
 The pattern of exploitation practiced by the landlords is mainly the exploita-
 tion of peasants by means of land rent (including school rent).  In addition,
 they may lend money, hire help, or engage in industry or commerce.  But
 collecting land rent from the peasants is the main form of their exploita-
 tion.  Managing the public hall is also one form of land rent exploitation.
 The exploitation by the small landlords among them is more cruel.  Though
 some landlords have gone bankrupt, they still perform no labor after
 bankruptcy, but depend on fraud, plunder, and the help of their relatives
 and friends; therefore, they are still considered landlords.
 The warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry are the political
 representatives of the landlord class and they are especially vicious
 among the landlords.
 The landlord class is the main enemy of the revolution.  The policy of the
 soviet on the landlord is to confiscate all their property and eliminate
 the landlord class.
 All those helping landlords collect rent and manage the household and
 relying on the landlords' exploitation of the peasants for a living must
 be included in the same category as landlords.
 Those who rely solely, or mostly, on high interest loans  for their living
 are called usurers.  Though they are not landlords, usury is a feudal
 exploitation, and all the assets of the usurers must be confiscated and the
 usurers eliminated.

 Generally, the rich peasants possess land, but there are also those who
 possess a part of the land and rent a part from others, or who possess no
 land, but rent all their land from others (tie latter two categories are
 of a minority).  The rich. peasants generally own relatively superior
 production tools and liquid capital and perform their own labor.  Nevertheless,
 they usually rely on exploitation for a part, or the greater part in some
 cases, of their living.
 The rich peasants' pattern of exploitation is mainly exploiting hired labor
 (hiring permanent help).  In addition, they may rent a part of their land to
 others and practice exploitation by collecting rent.  Or, they lend money
 on the side, or engage in business or small industry.  Most of them also
 manage the public hall.  Some of China's rich peasants perform their own
 labor, without hiring help, but exploit the peasants by means of land rents
 and loan interests.  Rich peasants regularly practice exploitation, it
 being the major practice for many of them.
 The policy of the soviet on the rich peasants is to confiscate their land
 and only the surplus part of their draft animals, farm tools, and buildings,
 and allocate land of relatively inferior quality to them.
 Many of the middle peasants possess land; some possess a part of the land
 and rent a part from others; some have no land at all, but rent all their
 land from others.  All of them have a fair amount of tools and rely entirely,
 or mostly, on their own labor.  Generally they do not exploit others, and
 many of them are exploited through land rents and loan interests.  The
 middle peasants, in general, do not sell their labor.  Some of them
 (including the well-to-do middle peasants) practice partial exploitation,
 but it is not regular or major.  All those are middle peasants.
 The policy of the.soviet on the middle peasants is to ally firmly with them.
 Without their consent, their land cannot be divided.  Those without adequate
 land must receive allocations the same as the poor peasants and farm laborers.
 Some of the poor peasants possess a little land and odd tools, while others
 have no land at all and only a few odd tools.  Generally, they must rent
 land from others to cultivate and are exploited through the payment of
 land rents, loan interests, and hiring out (generally the poor-peasants must
 sell a portion of their labor).  All those in this category are poor peasants.
 In land distribution, the poor peasants must receive the same benefits as
 the middle peasants and farm laborers.  Their existing land and tools are
 not confiscated.

 5.  What Is a Worker?
 A worker (including farm laborers) is someone  ho has no land or tools,
 or a very small amount of land and a few tools, and depends completely, or
 mainly, on selling his labor for a living.
 In the land revolution, the rural workers must receive the same land
 allocations as the poor and middle peasants, and the very small amount of
 land and tools owned by some of them must not be confiscated.  As for some
 households which have someone working in the city, that particular person
 is considered a worker.  If his family in the village rents land out or
 lends money, but does not rely on the rent as the main source of its living,
 his land is not confiscated, and he will receive land allocation the same
 as the peasants in general.  But if his family relies on collecting rent or
 making loans as the main source of its living, his land is confiscated, but
 his wife and children will receive land allocations, while he, himself, will
 not receive land allocation as he is in the city.

 ON PROMOTING GRAIN COOPERATIVES
 Announcement No 21 of the Central People's Committee
 4 July 1933
 [Text]  The central soviet areas were originally large rice producing areas,
 but there is the situation of partial summer famine this year.  Some of the
 worker-peasant masses do not have enough rice and they suffer great diffi-
 culties.  This deserves our serious attention.  The reason is because the
 imperialist Kuomintang's reactionary regime, in its desperate struggle,
 resorts not only to all political and military measures, but also the policy
 of economic blockade.  As a result, the supply of industrial products is
 reduced and prices are high.  To obtain the necessary industrial articles, the
 masses are forced to sell their new grain at a very cheap price.  Thus,
 the unscrupulous merchants and rich peasants take the opportunity to
 manipulate the market and suppress the price of new grain to an alarming
 extent.  They buy large volumes of grain at the cheapest price, either
 hoarding it for future profit or surreptitiously shipping it out, and the
 masses do not have enough rice to tide them over between spring planting
 and fall harvesting and have to buy it at a high price.  The unscrupulous
 merchants and rich peasants again make use of the opportunity to manipulate
 and raise the price.  In some areas, grain is not available even at a high
 price.  This is the main reason for the summer famine this year.  Other
 factors such as the natural disaster last year resulting in a bad harvest,
 the plunder and destruction of the White army and league bandits in outlying
 areas, the lack of attention on planned storage on the part of the govern-
 ment, and permitting the export of grain without restriction have all helped
 create the grain shortage this year.  To remedy the situation, the govern-
 ment has formed many measures, such as establishing grain balancing bureaus
 and trade bureaus in the various areas and preparing to store large volumes
 of grain for the emergency need of the masses.  Nevertheless, the main
 method to solve the grain supply problem of the worker-peasant masses is
 still the grain cooperative.  The toiling worker-peasant masses will solicit
 capital among themselves.  The shares may be paid for in cash or grain
 (converted into cash).  After the fall harvest when the members need money,
 they may sell their grain to the cooperative at a price higher than the
 market.  After purchasing the grain, the cooperative may store a small part

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 for the emergency needs of its members next year.between spring planting and
 fall harvesting and ship the greater part to areas where the price is high
 or as export.  This continuous purchasing and selling will not only expand
 the capital of the cooperative, but also enable the members to receive much
 surplus. By this means, we can stabilize the'market, prevent extremes in
 grain prices throughout the year in the soviet areas, safeguard the peasants
 from difficulties of grain shortage,-avoid the cruel exploitation of the
 unscrupulous merchants and rich peasants, and attain maximum improvement of
 the life of the workers and peasants.  The toiling worker-peasant masses
 must immediately mobilize and urge one another to join the grain cooperative.
 The many revolutionary mass organizations must devote their maximum effort to
 help perform this work.  The responsible comrades of the government of all
 levels must make the most extensive and intensive propaganda of the significance
 and effect of the grain cooperative, lead the masses, help the masses, and
 form at least one grain cooperative in every hsiang.  We must begin now with
 registration and recording and elect the responsible personnel according to
 the grain cooperative bylaw issued by the Central Government while building
 granaries and performing all preparatory work before fall harvest, so that
 the work can be immediately started when the new grain comes to the market.
 This is an important task to assure the grain supply of the masses,
 consolidate the soviet political power, and enable the revolutionary war
 to develop rapidly and successfully; therefore, it must not be overlooked in
 the slightest.  It is so announced.

 RESOLUTION ON "1 AUGUST" COMMEMORATION MOVEMENT
 11 July 1933
 [Text]  The 1st of August is the commemorative day of the worldwide anti-
 imperialist war.  It is also the commemorative day of the Nanchang Uprising
 in China.   The Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was born with the
 Nanchang Uprising and grew progressively in the course of the struggle.  This
 year's "1 August" comes at a time when the danger of the new imperialist'bandit
 war and anti-Soviet war    tremendously intensified, when Japanese imperialism
 is committing aggression against China on a broad scale, when the Kuomintang
 is openly selling out the three northeastern provinces, Jehol and North China,
 it comes at the same time when the high tide of the anti-imperialist and anti-
 Kuomintang movement is surging throughout the country, and when the Soviet
 movement and the revolutionary war are winning unparalleled great victories.
 Therefore, this year's "1 August" has a very great meaning for the revolu-
 tionary struggle.  With a view to commemorating the establishment of the
 Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and giving encouragement and preferential
 treatment to the fighters of the Red Army, it is resolved by the Central
 Executive Committee:
 (1)   to approve the proposal of the Central Revolutionary Military Commission
 by designating "1 August" of each year as the commemorative day of the
 Chinese workers' and peasants' Red Army.  It is further resolved that on
 this year's "1 August" commemorative day war banners be conferred on various
 contingents of the Red Army and at the same time medals be awarded to responsi-
 ble comrades who led the Nanchang Uprising and to commanders and fighters with
 distinguished services of achievement in the Red Army.
 (2)   to charge the Interior Department and People's Commissar Department with
 the production of preferential treatment cards for Red Army families and their
 issuance to all members of families of the fighters of the Red Army.
 (3)   to organize Red Army Public Land Control Committees under the Land
 Department of district soviets and under township soviets for the purpose of
 managing the production and harvest of Red Army public lands and the custody
 of harvested crops.  Under the joint jurisdiction.of the Land Department and

 OPEN CABLE MESSAGE AGAINST THE TREASONABLE DARIEN CONFERENCE RECENTLY HELD
 July 19 33
 [Text]  Revolutionary people of the whole country!
 A week ago, the landlord-bourgeoisie Kuomintang government, the eternally
 faithful running dog of imperialism, in a more sinister and shameless manner
 than ever before, held a conference in Darien.  On the afternoon of 5 July,
 a new agreement was concluded at the Japanese Gendarme Headquarters in
 Darien.   This agreement contains more concrete and more shameless terms than
 the North China Truce Agreement signed on 30 May!
 Amid the din of congratulations from the Deputy Commander of the imperialist
 Japanese Kwantung Army and near the end of the banquet celebrating their
 accomplishment of treason, Lei Shou-yun and company, the traitor representa-
 tive of the Kuomintang government, raised their champagne glasses and shook
 hands with the representatives of Manchukuo, which the Kuomintang once seem-
 ingly called a "puppet," on the one hand greeting the establishment of their
 newborn ally and on the other hand putting their final signatures on the irre-
 vocable agreement by which they sold out the national interests of China.
 The main contents of this new treasonable agreement are:   (1)   the Kuomintang
 government formally recognize Manchukuo and nominally regroup and reorganize
 the contingents of Manchukuo troops stationed along the Luanchow-Linyu area;
 (2) Japan is allowed to establish surveillance troops in such counties as
 Mi-yun and Luan-chou in North China; and (3) the Lu-Yu section of Peking-
 Lianong Railway is placed under joint control.
 Under the above agreement the Kuomintang has in fact not only formally recog-
 nized Manchukuo but even more shamelessly concluded an alliance with that
 puppet state, thereby swearing allegiance to their common master, imperialist
 Japan.  Recent facts tell us that the Kuomintang government has yielded to
 the demand of Manchukuo by permitting within a short time the resumption of
 postal remittances to and from Manchukuo and altering the existing arrangement
 of routing Europe-bound mail in transit through Vladivo stock and Siberia.
 These hard facts give lie to the Kuomintang allegation before the people that
 Manchukuo is a so-called "puppet."  This is a completely shameless deceptive
 propaganda.  As a matter of fact, the Kuomintang itself is a loyal puppet of
 Japanese imperialism; they and Manchukuo are both brothers of running dogs.

 Revolutionary people of the whole country!
 Only the Soviets can save China!  Only the anti-Japanese Red Army which is
 accelerating the pace of smashing the fourth "encirclement and suppression"
 campaign of the imperialist-Kuomintang is the arm of the revolutionary people
 of the whole country!  With a view to striving for the national independence
 and liberation as well as the territorial integrity of China, the Provisional
 Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic calls on the revolutionary
 people of the whole country and the revolutionary soldiers in the White army
 to unite under the Soviet banner and launch their revolutionary national war,
 knock down the imperialist-Kuomintang and bury them in the grave of history!

 Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic
 Hsiang Ying, Chang Kno-t'ao, Vice Chairmen
 The Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic, represent-
 ing the people of the whole country, is resolutely against the shameless
 treasonable agreement concluded by the Kuomintang at the Darien Conference
 and absolutely denies in toto the terms of this treasonable agreement.  It
 calls on the workers, peasants, soldiers and all revolutionaries of the whole
 nation to rise in unity against the recent treasonable Darien Conference and
 urges them to engage in persistent revolutionary struggle by going on strikes,
 closing shops, not attending classes, and abandoning sentry posts, and organize
 themselves into holding mass demonstrations and forming armed units in order
 to oppose and prevent the execution of the Darien Agreement.  The people of
 the whole country must clearly recognize that under the puppet alliance be-
 tween the Kuomintang and Manchukuo the Japanese imperialist robbers will
 inevitably expand their acts of aggression on an even larger scale by active-
 ly carrying out attacks against Chahar and Suiyuan and seizing the coastal
 provinces in southeast China with a view to participating with international
 imperialism in the joint dismemberment of China!  At the same time the Japanese
 robbers, the oriental gendarme of international imperialism, will keep up
 their recent frenzied acts of provocation against the Soviet Union and will
 certainly embark upon military adventures of open armed intervention against
 the Soviet Union the fraternal ally of the Chinese people!

 LETTER TO SOVIET GOVERNMENT OF HUANG-PO DISTRICT OF JUI-CHIN COUNTY ON THE
 LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
 13 July 19 33
 [Text]   Comrades of Huang-po Ch'u:
 With the help of the working group of the Central Land Department, you have
 mobilized the broad masses of workers and peasants in 12 townships of Huang-
 po District and enthusiastically initiated the movement to investigate land
 and classes.   In the course of this intense class struggle you have found out
 270 or more families of landlords and rich peasants.  They had hitherto been
 treated as middle and poor peasants.  Some landlords who had been treated as
 rich peasants were given land and even good farm land.  Compared with 122
 cases of landlords and rich peasants which had been disposed of by the soviet
 government of this district during the past 3 years, this number makes up
 70 percent of the total number of cases handled during that period.  In the
 course of this struggle of the investigation of land ownership and classes,
 you have confiscated a great amount of land and property which were distributed
 to poor peasants, suppressed the activities of the reactionaries, heightened
 the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in the entire soviet sector, purged
 a number of alien elements and other elements of the worst type who had sneaked
 into the soviet sector, absorbed a great many activist workers and peasants
 into our midst, held new elections of district and township soviets, and thus
 greatly consolidated the soviet political power.  This is a great victory
 in the land ownership investigation movement of Huang-po district.  However,
 the movement has not been brought to its completion.  There are still rem-
 nants of feudal forces at work and certain reactionary activities going on.
 This is particularly true in townships of Shang-tuan, Hsin-chuang and Lan-t'ien
 where some alien and bad elements are covertly or overtly active in deceiving
 and inciting some of the masses and some of these elements are bent on re-
 versing verdicts on past cases.  You must pay utmost attention to such condi-
 tions and you must mobilize the masses on the broadest scale in these town-
 ships to expose the intrigue of these reactionary elements, continue to in-
 vestigate the remnant components of landlords and rich peasants, suppress the
 reactionary elements in Shang-tuan and other townships, prevent their attempt
 to counterattack and reverse prior verdicts, and tirelessly and unflinchingly
 lead the masses in their struggle in order to win the final victory in the
 land investigation movement.

 Having carefully examined the investigation forms on which you have determined
 the composition of class elements, we find that most of your decisions on class
 elements were correct but a few of them were incorrect.  For example, several
 families should have been determined as landlords but you had decided them to
 be rich peasants or even middle peasants.  Your decision on one family was
 that he was a usurer but he should have been a rich peasant.  In still another
 case labor power was not filled out clearly; we hope you will reinvestigate
 and then decide:  Now with a view to drawing your careful and clear focus
 on determining the class elements, we enumerate the errors of your decisions
 on the class elements of 10 families as follows:
 (1)  Chou Tsung-jen (a native of Shang-tuan township)  This family has three
 persons.  They are not engaged in labor (20 years ago he had been a long-term
 laborer for 12 years).  He owns land of 50 tan which is completely rented out
 to others.   Each year he collects a land rent of 25 tan of rice and has been
 collecting it for 7 years.  He also has 2 strips of hilly land which yields
 him a few hundred mao a year.  He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 4 tan
 from which he deducts 400 yuan.   (You decided him to be a middle peasant)
 (2)  Hsieh Ming-szu (a native of Shang-tuan) with himself as the sole member
 of the family.  He does not engage in labor.  He owns land of 39 tan which is
 completely rented out and on which he collects land rent of 16 tan of rice
 a year; he has been collecting it for 20 years.  He owns a house which is rented
 for 1 tan of rice a year and he has been collecting it for 20 or more years.
 He lends money totalling 1,040 mao.  In the past he had oppressed people in
 the rural area and forced the masses to attack the Red Army.   (You decided
 him to be a rich peasant)
 (3)  Chu Te-meng (a native of Hsin-chuang township)  The family has two per-
 sons.  They are not engaged in labor.  He owns a land of 41 tan which is com-
 Oletely rented out to others.  He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 6
 tan. He has also been a lender of 30 yuan for 8 or 9 years.    (You decided
 him to be a rich peasant)
 (4)  Chung Tung-chi (a native of Shan-ho township)   The family has two per-
 sons.  They are not engaged in labor.  He owns a land of 85.1/2 tan.  He regularly
 hires long-term as well as odd laborers to till 46! tan and rents out 39 tan
 of his land.  He is a lender of 1 tan of new rice.  He manages two pieces of
 communal land.   (You decided him to be a rich peasant)
 (5)  Liu Fang-lo (a native of Fu-ch'i township)   The family has three persons.
 They do not engage in labor.   He owns a land of 54 tan and rents from others
 another 10 tan on which he pays a land rent of 2 tan, 90 catties.  Each year
 he collects land rent of 14 tan on his land of 35 tan which he rents out to
 others.  He has been collecting it for 8 years.   He hires long-term and short-
 term laborers to till 29 tan of his land.  He owes a debt of 1,590 mao.  He
 has been managing 1 piece of communal land for 8 years.  In the past he was
 influential in the rural area and had oppressed people.  (You decided him to
 be a rich peasant)

 Based on the conditions filled out on the investigation forms and viewed from
 their land relations and relations of exploitation, the above five families
 are not middle or rich peasants but are all landlords (small landlords).  In
 the families of Chou Tsung-jen, Hsieh Ming-szu and Chu Te-ming, no one is
 engaged in labor.  They rent out all of their land and are wholly dependent
 on rents for their living.  They are typical specimen of landlords.  Thus
 your decision of Chou Tsung-jen as a middle peasant and your decision of
 Hsieh Ming-szu and Chu Te-meng as rich peasants are all wrong.  As for Chung
 T'ung-chi and Liu Fang-lo, no member of these families is engaged in labor
 and all are totally dependent on exploitation.  The difference between them
 and the other three families is that they rented out a portion of their land
 and hired long-term laborers to till the other portion of their land at home.
 But they are just the same landlords and not rich peasants.  This is because
 the price of labor power in the rural areas of China is extremely cheap and
 many of the landlord class have utilized a part of their land and their old
 farm implements by hiring laborers to till them at their home.  They have
 most cruelly exploited these laborers in various forms of feudal servitude
 while at the same time they rent out another part of their land to peasants
 to be exploited by them.  Here these landlords differ from rich peasants in
 that they are not engaged in labor themselves whereas rich peasants are so
 engaged in person.  Because you have overlooked this point, you have erred
 in your decision.
 (6)  Hsiao Hsu-chiao (a native of Yuan-k'eng township)  This family has four
 persons.  He himself engaged in labor to a small extent (he was killed during
 the revolution).  He owned a land of 62 tan of which 38 tan were tilled by his
 long-term laborers (he had hired long-term laborers for two generations up
 to the time of the revolution).  He rented out 24 tan of his land (for 36
 years).  He owned three strips of catalpa tree hilly hand yielding 42 tan of
 catalpa wood a year.  He lent money amounting to 210 mao.  He managed two
 pieces of communal land which earned him a land rent of 20 tan of rice a year.
 He had been collecting it for 35 years.  He had oppressed people in the past.
 (You decided him to be a rich peasant)
 (7)  Liu Chi-ho (a native of Hu-ling township)  This family has three persons.
 He engages in labor himself to a small extent., He owns a land of 65 tan of
 which he hires long-term laborers to till 32 tan and rents out the remainder
 of 33 tan on which he collects land rent of 15 tan of rice.  He owns three
 strips of hilly land which yields him over 30 yuan a year.  He has a pond
 which yields him 20 or more yuan a year.  He rents out six houses collecting
 rent in kind of 6 tan of rice a year.  He rents out a privy collecting rent
 in kind of 30 catties of rice a year.  He manages four pieces of communal
 land on which he collects rent in kind of 89 tan 29 catties of rice a year.
 He was quite influential in the rural area.   (You decided him to be a rich
 peasant)
 Both of the above two families rent out a part of their land but at the same
 time hire long-term and short-term laborers to till another part of their land.
 They live almost entirely by exploitation.   These facts are identical with

 those of the families of Chung T'ung-chi and Liu Fang-lo.  The difference
 lies in that they themselves engage in labor to a small extent but only to a
 small extent.  Thus they should still be determined as landlords but you were
 wrong in deciding them to be rich peasants.  This is because rich peasants
 are actually engaged in production on their land.  Those who engage in light
 labor to a small extent cannot be said to be rich peasants.  The number of such
 small landlords who engage in labor to a very small extent but live mostly
 by exploitation is not inconsiderable in China.
 (8)  Ch'en Tse-hung (a native Yuan-k'eng township)  The family has five
 persons.  Only one person is engaged in labor.  He owns land of 62 tan and
 rents from others another of 10 tan on which he pays land rent of 3 tan of
 rice.  The land is tilled by himself and by a long-term laborer.  He owns two
 strips of catalpa tree hilly land which yields him 40 tan of catalpa wood a
 year.  Each year he hires a long-term laborer as he has done for the last 10
 years.  He has been a lender of mortgaged land rent of 3 1/2 tan of rice for
 3 years.  He has been a money lender totalling 500 mao for 20 or more years.
 He rents out a room for 4 mao a year for the 34 years.  In the past he had
 oppressed people in the rural area.   (You decided him to be a middle peasant)
 Ch'en Tse-hung regularly hires long-term laborers. At the same time he is
 also a usurer and administrator of communal land.  He relies on exploitation
 as the main source of his livelihood, but he is actually engaged in production
 on his land.  This is a typical specimen of a rich peasant in China.  You were
 wrong in deciding him to be a middle peasant.
 (9)  Chung Kuo-fang (a native of Pai-ti township)  This family has nine persons,
 three of whom are engaged in labor.  He owns a land of 112 tan and three strips
 of catalpa tree and bamboo hilly land.  He has been lending money totalling
 3,200 mao for over .10 years.  He rents out two rooms for 2 yuan a year.  As
 rent has not been paid, it has accumulated with compound interest to a total
 of 7,000 or more mao.   (You decided him to be a usurer)
 A usurer is one who depends for his livelihood exclusively or mainly on ex-
 ploitation by lending money at high interest.   The soviet policy on usurers
 is total confiscation. and their elimination.  Chung Kuo-fang owns a land of
 120 tan which is completely tilled by himself and makes up the main source
 of income for his livelihood.  We must not determine him to be a usurer and
 adopt the policy of eliminating him because he also lends money at high interest.
 It is incorrect to take this kind of excessively left point of view by ignoring
 his own labor.  The correct decision should be to make him a rich peasant,
 confiscate his land, his surplus draft animals, farm implements and house, but
 he should still be given some relatively poor land to be tilled by his own
 labor.  Why can't he be called a well-to-do middle peasant?  Because his ex-
 ploitation by usury has reached the figure of 10,000 mao and it has been a
 regular exploitation.  Some rich peasants engage in this kind of exploitation
 to some extent but this is not regularly done and the amount is certainly not
 large..

 (10)  Liu Ch'i-ch'ang (a native of Pai-ti township)  This family has four per-
 sons.            He himself engages in farming to some extent and is also a pig broker.
 He owns land of 36 tan and rents from others another of 44 tan on which he pays
 15 tan of rice as land rent.  He has two strips of hilly land which yield him
 20 tan of catalpa wood and peaches a year.  He has been hiring long-term
 laborers for 18 years.  He is a lender of mortgaged land rent of 2 tan and 1
 lo of new rice.  He manages a communal land which yields him 15 tan of rice
 a year.   (You decided him to be a landlord)
 We have some doubt whether this man should be a landlord.  According to the
 investigation form, his family has tilled their rice field of 80 tan and two
 strips of hilly land.  If he hires only one long-term laborer to till them,
 it would not be enough so the amount of his own labor is probably quite sub-
 stantial.                        If the amount of his own labor is relatively substantial, then he
 should be determined as a rich peasant.  You should not adopt the policy of
 eliminating him but should treat him according to the elements of a ric4
 peasant.  Moreover, some landlords rent land to be tilled by long-term
 laborers, but this is in the minority and the majority of landlords to not
 rent land from others.  Now this man has rented the greater part of the land
 from others; such is frequently the case with rich peasants.  It is, therefore,
 necessary for you to find out the condition of his own labor before reaching
 a correct decision whether he should be a landlord or a rich peasant.  If you
 have clearly established that the amount of his own labor is incidental and
 quite small,. then your decision is a correct one.

 ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONAL PROGRAM OF POOR-PEASANT GROUPS
 13 July 1933
 [Text] Generally speaking, Poor-peasant Groups have played an important role
 in the land revolution.  By uniting the broad masses of hired farm laborers
 and poor peasants and aligning with middle peasants around them, and under
 the leadership of the Communist Party and the soviets, they have exerted their
 overwhelming revolutionary strength in overthrowing the feudal and semi-feudal
 forces in the rural areas and seized from the landlord class land on which they
 have actively promoted production.  Moreover, they have also played a great
 part in the important work of war mobilization, economic mobilization and
 cultural construction.  Such-great revolutionary achievements of the Poor-
 peasant Groups fully deserve to be commended.  However, viewed from present
 conditions such achievements have not been made by Poor-peasant Groups in all
 areas.  Then, too, in the light of these achievements we cannot ignore a num-
 ber of shortcomings and errors which exist in their organization and in the
 execution of their program.  On the contrary, only by viewing their past
 achievements and at the same time detecting their shortcomings and errors
 or the inadequacies of their achievements in certain respects can they strive
 to correct these organizational and operational shortcomings and errors and win
 still greater victories in the future and fulfil their assigned responsibilities
 in the soviet movement.
 Based on materials from many sources, the Poor-peasant Groups have shown many
 weaknesses from the organizational and operational standpoint and in some areas
 they exist in name only and have no actual work at all.  Summing up these
 materials, we can divide them into two situations:   (1) In some localities
 a Poor-peasant Group does not exist in a township but only in a village where
 the Poor-peasant Group has a sub-group under it.   In some other localities
 there is no Poor-peasant Group in a village but only in a township where the
 Poor-peasant Group has a sub-group under it.   In still other localities a
 Poor-peasant Group exists both in a township and in a village; a village Poor-
 peasant Group has a sub-group under it.  Under a township or a village Poor-
 peasant Group there is an executive committee comprised of three operational
 sections: chairman, organization and propaganda and all sub-groups are directed
 by the executive committee.  Meetings are held regularly:  in some cases full
 executive meetings are held once every 10 days, and sub-group meetings once

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 every 5 days; in other cases full executive committee meets once a week and
 sub-groups meet once every 5 days.  Any one who wishes to join a Poor-peasant,
 Group, regardless of whether he is a hired farm laborer or a toil-and-moil
 poor peasant, must be introduced by 3 persons or he cannot become a member.
 Thus many of these farm laborers and peasants are being excluded from the
 door of the Poor-peasant Group, thereby retarding the development of members
 and reducing the effectiveness of the Poor-peasant Group.
 (2)  Even worse than the above is another kind of situation:  in some locali-
 ties it was summarily declared that except landlords, rich peasants and middle
 peasants, all others were made members of a Poor-peasant Group with someone
 appointed as its chairman by a Communist Party branch or a township soviet.
 With this done a township is deemed to have organized its Poor-peasant Group.
 Now this chairman does not know how many members there are, or what kind of
 work is expected to be done, and no meeting has been held in 3 or 4 months,
 or even in 6 months or a year.  This kind of Poor-peasant group hanging up an
 empty name is in reality nothing at all.  Its tasks and the role it is destined
 to play in the rural area cannot remotely be expected to be accomplished.
 Among Poor-peasant group under the first situation, a few have taken over the
 functions of a government.  For example, such conditions exist in Poor-peasant
 Group in Lung-kang township, Wu-yang district and in Hsin-chuang and Pai-ts'un
 townships, Jui-chin County.  The Poor-peasant Group under the second situation
 described above has no regular work schedule and is disorganized and ineffectual.
 Both of these phenomena are not good.  However, in many localities of the soviet
 sector the Poor-peasant Group are organizationally and operationally healthy.
 and well-developed.  The majority of the members, inbued with an intense spirit
 for struggle, are capable of actively discussing various issues of revolutionary
 struggle and yet do not encroach upon the functions of their township administra-
 tion.  They are not only radically different from the Poor-peasant Group of the
 second type (hanging up an empty name) but also more advanced than those of the
 first type (with errors).  They are truly a model of Poor-peasant Group in the
 soviet sector and deserve to be emulated by Poor-peasant Group in all areas.
 With a view to summing up the past experience of struggle of Poor-peasant
 Group, unifying their organization, extensively establishing their regular
 operations, and thus fulfilling their important tasks in the present stage of
 the revolution, the Central Government, based on its experience in the develop-
 ment of the land struggle and acting on the proposal of the Poor-peasant
 Group People's Congress of eight counties of Jui-chin, Hui-ch'ang, Yu-tu,
 Sheng-li, Po-sheng, Shih-ch'eng, Ning-hua and Ch'ang-ting, promulgates this
 Organization and Operational Program of the Poor-Peasant Groups and it is hoped
 that the broad masses of poor peasants in rural areas of the whole country
 will be united in solidarity and in action under this Program:
 .(1)  A Poor-peasant Group is not purely an organization of one single class
 but one embracing the broad masses of poor peasants under the jurisdiction
 of the township soviets.  At the same time farm laborers must take part and
 form themselves into workers' sub-groups in order to assume the role of posi-
 tive leadership inside the organization and unite the poor peasants to become
 the most reliable pillar of the soviet political power under the leadership
 of the proletariat.

 (2)  The function of a Poor-peasant Group is to assist the government in
 implementing all its laws and decrees but it does not substitute for the work
 of the government.  It should express its own views on various questions con-
 cerning the interests and rights of the workers and peasants and present pro-
 posals to the government.
 (3)  A Poor-peasant Group should pay particular attention to the interests
 and rights of middle peasants, thus enabling them to center around the Poor-
 peasant group, form a solid alliance between them and become a strong link
 in the coalition between the proletariat and the middle peasants, thereby
 facilitating the struggle to eliminate the landlords and oppose the rich
 peasants.
 (4)  Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and the soviets can the
 Poor-peasant Group correctly accomplish all their tasks without being trammeled
 by such backward peasant ideologies as absolute equalitarianism and localism.
 In localities where no Poor-peasant Groups have been set up, they can be pro-
 moted by farm labor unions and activist elements among poor peasants.  Farm
 laborer and handicraft workers' unions must generally accomplish their parti-
 cipation en masse in Poor-peasant Groups in order to realize the constant leader-
 ship of the proletariat in Poor-peasant groups.
 (5)  Activist elements among poor peasants should be absorbed into Poor-peasant
 Groups during the initial period of its formation in order that it will gradual-
 ly become an organization of all poor peasants.  With a view to attracting the
 latter to participate in Poor-peasant Groups (those bad elements who sabotaged
 the land revolution and protected landlords and rich peasants naturally cannot
 join even if they are poor peasants), old members of Poor-peasant Groups should
 constantly be responsible for carrying out extensive propaganda work and active-
 ly looking for poor peasants and farm laborers to join without the formality
 of introduction but opening the door wide and leading them into Poor-peasant
 Groups.  Participation in Poor-peasant groups should be based on the principle
 of one's own free will.  All farm laborers and poor peasants, men and women,
 old and young, may enroll and join.  It is wrong to use the method of deputiz-
 ing people from each household.  With a view to strictly preventing landlords
 and rich peasants from sneaking into Poor-peasant Groups, all new members,
 whether they were found by old members or voluntarily enrolled themselves,
 must be scrutinized according to the criteria of analyzing classes and they
 should be immediately expelled if they were discovered to be incorrect elements.
 This will protect the Poor-peasant groups from being infiltrated by landlords
 and rich peasants.
 (6)  During the period when land struggle is being launched or land ownership
 investigation movement is being carried out, if Poor-peasant Group has produced
 a contrary effect because it was loosely organized and ineffectual in the past
 or because it was dominated by a small minority of landlords and rich peasants,
 it would be totally incorrect to adopt the method of commandism by dissolving
 and reorganizing the Poor-peasant Group for this would be departing from the
 masses.  The proper measure to take at such time is to unite the activist
 elements among poor peasants and intensify their education so that they will

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 initiate vigorous struggle within the Poor-peasant Group to expose the swindles
 of landlords and rich peasants, strive to keep the members from being influenced
 by them, and resolutely purge them as well as those bad elements who can no
 longer be individually re-educated from the Poor-peasant Group, thereby strength-
 ening the fighting power of the Poor-peasant Group and seizing total victory
 of the land struggle and land ownership investigation movement.   If the Poor-
 peasant Group has middle peasants as members, it is impossible to treat them
 as landlords and rich peasants and consider the job.done once they are purged.
 It is necessary to go through a process of clear explanation by telling them
 why they need not take part in the Poor-peasant Group and that after leaving
 the Poor-peasant Group they can still attend its meetings as-observers and all
 middle peasants are welcome to attend and listen.
 (7)  As the Poor-peasant Group is not purely an organization of one single
 class, it does not require a strict organizational form of a trade union, nor
 does it need definite bylaws or payment of membership dues (when money is needed,
 members may be asked to make temporary contributions at general meetings).
 Still less does it need a structural system at a provincial, county or dis-
 trict level.  It is only necessary to organize the Poor-peasant Group at a
 township level.  A township Poor-peasant Group has sub-groups under it.  A
 sub-group takes one house (one tiny hamlet) as a unit with members of each
 house forming a sub-group.  If, however, a house has very few families and thus
 very few members, then 2 or 3 neighboring houses can form themselves into a
 sub-group.  On the other hand, if one house contains a score or more of families
 and thus a great number of members, it can be organized into several sub-groups.
 (8)  To facilitate the work of the Poor-peasant Group, the people's congress
 should nominate 3 persons (most activist elements) to form a committee.  The
 Poor-peasant Group in a larger township or with many members may nominate 5
 persons to 7 persons to form a committee.  A chairman is nominated by the com-
 mittee to take charge of over-all work and no other working section will be
 established.  Poor-peasant Groups should practice a liberal system of revolu-
 tionary democracy.  Important questions must be discussed by the people's con-
 gress called for that purpose; only ordinary questions are discussed by the
 committee alone or with the participation of sub-group chiefs at its request.
 (9)  Meetings of Poor-peasant Group people's congress, committees and sub-
 groups should not be mechanically scheduled at fixed time to avoid formalism.
 and diminish the interests'of the members.  A meeting should be called prompt-
 ly when important questions arise.  During the period when class struggle be-
 comes particularly intense in rural areas such as during land distribution
 and land ownership investigations, membership meetings should be held once
 every 3 or 4 days or 5 or 6 days, and committee and sub-group meetings once
 every 2 or 3 days.
 (10)  The work of the Poor-peasant Group should be focused on the interests of
 workers, poor peasants and middle peasants at all times and undertaken to
 strive for the consolidation and development of the soviet political power.
 The important items of the work of Poor-peasant Groups are enumerated as
 follows:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 (a)  On the question of confiscating and distributing land, houses, farm
 implements and other property of local tyrants, evil gentry and landlords
 and the land, surplus draft animals, farm implements and houses of rich peas-
 ants, discussion of this question should be centered on how to deal with the
 resistance of landlords and rich peasants and how to let the benefits of the
 land revolution fall into the hands of workers, poor peasants and middle
 peasants.  Here special attention must be paid not to harm the interests of
 middle peasants but to effect a close alignment with them.  Attention must
 be drawn to the total elimination of feudal influence in rural areas, without
 letting landlords and rich peasants pretend themselves to be middle peasants
 and poor peasants in order to steal their land benefits and no effort should
 be spared to the extent that not a single landlord shall be allowed to keep
 1 ts'un of land and not a single rich peasant shall be allowed to steal one
 strip of good land.
 (b)  Discussion of questions of farm production such as how to carry out
 the movements of spring planting, summer planting, autumn harvest and autumn
 planting, how to increase manpower and fertilizer, improve seeds, develop
 conservancy works, redistribute draft animals, buy farm implements., eradicate
 pests, reclaim barren land, plant trees, and protect mountains and forests.
 (c)  Discussion of questions. of economic mobilization.   In addition to the
 development of farm production as described above, the main question to be
 discussed is how to develop cooperatives such as cooperatives of food-grains,
 consumers, credit, production and farm cattle in order to promote the large-
 scale development of the national economy to resist the cruel exploitation of
 merchants and smash the economic blockade of the enemy, thereby further im-
 proving the livelihood of the masses and substantially reinforcing the power-
 ful strength of the revolutionary war.
 (d)  Discussion of questions of relief to famine and starvation such as how to
 render mutual help in food, seeds, farming cattle and farm implements during
 periods of famine and how to devise ways and means of giving relief to victims
 in areas harassed by enemy disturbances.
 (e)  Discussion of questions of public health of the masses such as initiating
 universal health campaigns, talking about sweep-out and clean-up campaigns
 to combat sickness and pestilence and protect the health and living of the
 masses.
 (f)  Discussion of questions of preferential treatment of Red Army personnel
 such as the cultivation, harvest and conservation of Red Army public land,
 helping Red Army families till their land and carrying out the regulations
 governing the preferential treatment of Red Army personnel.
 (g)  Discussion of questions of war mobilization.  Here the first question is
 the expansion of the Red Army, the second is the raising of funds to help
 the Red Army, the third is to comfort the Red Army, and the fourth is
 to expand the Red Guard contingents and the Red Guard Young Pioneers units.

 These are all extremely important questions of war mobilization.
 (h)   Discussion of questions of participation in soviet election and accusa-
 tion campaigns such as to insure the election of activist elements among workers
 and poor peasants during elections and attract the best elements of middle
 peasants to take part in soviet work.  When alien class elements are found to
 have sneaked into the soviet ranks or when corrupt, passive and sabotaging
 elements are discovered, participate in accusation campaigns called by the
 workers' and peasants' investigatory department and initiate self-criticism
 by soviet workers in order to insure the absolute health of soviet work.
 (i)   Discussion of questions of how to completely carry out all soviet laws,
 decrees, resolutions and orders in all local townships.
 (j)   Discussion of any major questions which arise at any time.  Poor-peasant
 Groups must constantly discuss all of the above questions, actively present
 proposals to the government, and resolutely participate in all struggles on
 the revolutionary front under the leadership of the government for the complete
 fulfilment of various revolutionary tasks.  Only thus can they constantly have
 their own work and truly earn benefits for workers, poor peasants and middle
 peasants without becoming an empty organization which exists in name only.
 (11)  With a view to further strengthening the proletarian leadership of the
 peasant masses in rural areas, Poor-peasant Group committees (a few activist
 poor peasants may be elected to go along) may propose to hold joint meetings
 with the leading bodies of farm labor unions and handicraft workers' unions.
 Such joint meetings should be called by labor unions.  They may be held to dis-
 cuss, for example, the organization of Support the Red Army Committee, Anti-
 imperialism and Support Soviet League, Revolutionary Mutual Help Society, and
 certain commemorative and demonstration mass meetings and to strive for their
 realization by common effort and with unanimous consent.

 DECISION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON THE REDEMARCATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE
 AREAS
 21 July 1933
 [Text]  The demarcation of the soviet administrative areas is absolutely
 different in principle from the demarcation of those of the old reactionary
 government.  The scope of administrative areas of the old reactionary government
 was very extensive because they were bureaucratic organs far removed from the
 masses and their aim was only to weaken and oppress the people.  The principle
 upon which the demarcation of the soviet administrative areas is based is in
 complete contrast because they must be as close to the people as possible and
 work for the benefit of the masses.  Thus the range of a town, district, county
 and province must not be too large.  The central soviet areas have undergone
 not a few changes in demarcation, but they have, generally speaking, kept
 their old boundaries without any fundamental alterations.  This has greatly
 hampered the work of war mobilization and economic and cultural construction.
 Therefore, it is resolved by the Central Executive Committee to redemarcate
 the administrative areas of the Central soviet sector and stipulates the
 standards of their demarcation at various levels as follows:
 (A)   City:  Apart from its own area, a city may govern portions of a town
 and village within its environs but their area should not exceed 5 li.
 (B)   Township:
 (1)   Township of 1st class.   In a densely populated area on the plain, each
 township should as a standard rule govern a population of 2,000.  If a village
 or several villages in the vicinity have a population of more than 2,000, a
 township soviet may govern a larger population but it must not exceed the
 maximum of 2,500 people.  At the same time if for reasons of topography (such
 as rivers and streams) it is desirable to divide one township into two, there-
 by reducing the population of one township to less than 2,500, then that town-
 ship soviet may govern a smaller population.
 (2)  Township of 2d class.   In a locality intermixed with plains and hills
 where the population is not as dense as that of a township of 1st class and
 where the area is wider, a township may as a standard rule govern a population
 of 1,500.  If for reasons of topography it is desirable for a township soviet
 to cover a wider or smaller area, the population of such a township may be more

 (3)  Township of 3rd class.  In a hilly locality with a sparse population,
 each township as a standard rule may govern a population of 1,000.  If for
 reasons of topography it is desirable for certain villages and hamlets to be
 governed by one township, then the population of such a township may exceed
 1,000 but its area must not be too extensive or it would run counter to the
 soviet principle of being close to the masses.  At the same time if for topo-
 graphic reasons it is not desirable for a township soviet to govern a larger
 population, then its population may be less than 1,000.  In a locality sur-
 rounded by big mountains where the area is exceptionally extensive and the
 population exceptionally sparse, the population of such a township may be as
 small as 400 but not less than 250 as a minimum..
 (C)  District:  Each district should as a standard rule govern seven townships.
 In a locality on the plain with an unusually dense population, such a district
 may govern nine townships.  In a hilly and expansive locality with an unusually
 sparse population, the number of townships governed by a district may be re-
 duced to five townships.
 (D)  County and Province:  The demarcation of administrative areas of a county
 and a province shall be entrusted to the People's Committee and shall be gov-
 erned by decree based on the principle of being close to the masses.
 All soviet districts outside the Central Soviet sector should re-examine their
 administrative areas in accordance with the principle enunciated in this de-
 cision and any district whose area is too extensive should be redemarcated in
 conformity with this principle.
 Upon publication of this decision, "the Provisional Regulations Governing the
 Demarcation of Administrative Areas in the Chinese Soviet Republic" promul-
 gated in December 1931 shall be declared null and void.

 DECISION OF CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ON THE ISSUANCE OF ECONOMIC CONSTRUC-
 TION BONDS
 22 July 1933
 [Text]  Drastic developments of the revolutionary war require the soviets to
 mobilize all forces to carry out economic construction in a planned way.
 From the standpoint of such economic construction, the masses should be or-
 ganized into broadly developing cooperatives, coordinating the production and
 marketing of foodgrains and all products, and promoting external trade to
 smash the enemy's economic blockade and the ruthless exploitation of traitor
 merchants, thereby further improving the livelihood of the masses and enabling
 the revolutionary war to gain more substantial material strength.  This then
 is the major fighting task at the present time.  With a view to vigorously
 carrying out the work of economic construction, the Central Executive Committee
 has approved the proposal at the workers' mass meeting of the Land Ownership
 Investigation Movement and the Poor Peasant Group People's Congress of eight
 county soviets of Jui-chin, Hui-ch'ang, Yu-tu, Sheng-li, Po-sheng, Shih-ch'eng,
 Ning-hua and Ch'ent-t'ing for the issuance of Economic Construction Bonds in
 the amount of 3,000,000 yuan and permits the purchasers of these bonds to make
 payment freely either by foodgrains or in money.  Apart from using a part of
 the proceeds for present military expenses, the main portion of the proceeds
 will be spent in developing cooperatives, redistributing foodgrains and ex-
 panding external trade.  For the purpose of ascertaining the use of these bonds
 and the procedure of payment of their principal and interest, the Central
 Executive Committee hereby enacts the Regulations Governing the Issuance of
 Economic Construction Bonds.   It charges the People's Committee with the
 responsibility of urging the People's Finance Department and the People's
 National Economy Department to direct local governments to issue and dis-
 tribute these bonds correctly and promptly in accordance with this decision
 and these regulations and at the same time to make broad publicity and ex-
 planation to workers and peasants as well as all residents who abide by soviet
 laws and decrees so that economic construction can be speedily launched through-
 out the soviet areas.  Any anti-revolutionary elements attempting to sabotage
 the faith and credit of the bonds and any economic measures will be severely
 suppressed by necessary measures to be adopted by the National Political Defense
 Bureau in order to insure the satisfactory implementation of the work of economic
 construction.

 July 1933
 [Text]  Relying on the correct offensive line of the Party and the positive
 leadership of the soviets, relying on the heroic combat and enthusiastic support
 of the Worker-Peasant Red Army and the masses, and relying on the daily strug-
 gle of the working and peasant masses in the White sector and the unprecedented
 vigorous advance of the anti-imperialist and anti-Kuomintang mass movement,
 we have in the wake of the battle of Tung-huang-p'i essentially smashed the ene-
 my's fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaign.  In the unparalleled
 great glorious victory of the battle of Tung-huang-p'i, the heroic Red Army
 has dealt a most fatal blow to the Kuomintang warlord chieftain Chiang Kai-shek,
 the most formidable pillar of the landlord-bourgeoisie!  In his tearful "hand-
 written order" and other correspondence, he mournfully admitted that this is
 their "secret sorrow since the day of birth."  (Chiang Kai-shek's letter to
 Chen Cheng)  This is an unprecedented grievous defeat and collapse of their
 army!  Consequently after they had suffered this grievous defeat, even though.
 they attempted to launch counterattacks on several occasions, they. were found
 powerless to do so in the end!
 The reasons why the Kuomintang warlords have suffered this grievous defeat
 and why they have not been able to counterattack are:  First, it is due to the
 stout prowess and heroic combat skill of the Worker-Peasant Red Army.  In the
 great victory of Tung-huang-p'i, they received enormous reinforcements to
 strengthen themselves.  The soviet sector has also gained tremendous con-
 solidation and development.  The majority of the Kuomintang soldiers were funda-
 mentally shaken and unwilling to attack the Red Army.                     Even the reactionary
 Kuomintang army officers were mostly scared to death and when they spoke of
 the Red Army, they were like "speaking of the tiger making them pale."  Thus
 despite the repeated attempts of Chiang Kai-shek to launch counterattacks, he
 has been powerless to do so in the end.   Second, it is due to the deepening
 and continuing aggravation of the national crisis in China.  At a time when
 Japanese imperialism had occupied Jehol and Luan-tung and were closing in on
 Peking and Tientsin and when the Kuomintang continued to surrender without
 shame, the anti-imperialist and anti-Kuomintang revolutionary storm has surged
 to a new height.  This has made it inevitable for the Kuomintang on the one
 hand to conclude the agreement of surrender with Japanese imperialism finaliz-
 ing the sell-out of Peking, Tientsin and North China and on the other hand

 carry out an unparalleled White reign of terror to suppress the anti-imperial-
 ist and anti-Kuomintang roaring revolutionary masses.  Third, it is due to the
 general collapse of the national economy which has subjected hundreds of
 millions of workers and peasants to an unprecedented catastrophe from a sub-
 human enslaved standard of living to the bitter sea of starvation, death and
 homeless destitution.  As a result, workers' strikes and peasant uprisings
 erupted throughout the country on a tremendous scale, turning their struggle
 for daily living into a political struggle against imperialism and the Kuomintang.
 These revolutionary struggles have obstructed our enemy and forced them into
 a state of shock and helplessness.  Meanwhile the diminished receipts of
 customs revenue of the Kuomintang government and the exodus of workers and
 peasants into soviet areas thereby escaping from the range of their exploitation
 have brought the finances of the Kuomintang government to the verge of bank-
 ruptcy!
 Confronted with such a grave defeat and hopeless circumstances, the only
 "strategem" of the Kuomintang warlords is to surrender themselves even more
 .vilely and shamelessly to imperialism.  From the hands of international im-
 perialism they sought and received large batches of loans and munitions which
 enabled them to mount their fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign
 against the soviet areas and the Red Army.  The signing of the North China
 Truce Agreement and the travels of Sung Tsu-wen [T.V. Soong] to Europe and
 America are precisely aimed at implementing their intrigue.  Now a new bar-
 gain has been struck between the Kuomintang and imperialism.  The Kuomintang
 has given away 4,000,000 or more square li of China's territory and many secret
 and unannounced gifts for which they received several hundred million yuan
 of loans and large supplies of arms and munitions.  Utilizing these loans and
 supplies of arms and munitions, the Kuomintang, under the direct command and
 organization of various imperialist countries, has been deploying their troops
 in North China and elsewhere, training many new contingents in the making of
 poisonous gas bombs, and concentrating all their forces to organize their
 fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign and launch their frenzied but
 futile attack against the Red Army in the soviet areas which will certainly be
 doomed to defeat!
 Thus we are now confronted with a new revolutionary situation.  In the face
 of such a new situation, our task is to mobilize all our forces and concen-
 trate them to smash the imperialist-Kuomintang's fifth "encirclement and sup-
 pression" campaign!   This is a great historical turning point.                       Two types of
 political power:   the soviet political power of workers, peasants and soldiers
 and the Kuomintang regime of the landlord-bourgeoisie, will in the course of
 the impending war on a broader scale unfold this kind of the future--our soviet
 political power will advance with more victories and their Kuomintang regime
 will collapse with more death and destruction."
 With a view to striving for total victory in the smashing of the enemy's
 "encirclement and suppression" campaign, we must first and foremost increase
 and concentrate all our forces to heighten our confidence in victory and offer
 our all to the war!   In this connection we must above all else insure the
 steady increase of the numbers of the Red Army and expand it to 50,000 during
 August, September, and October this year.  At the same time we must vastly
 raise the political education and military skill of the Red Army fighters

 and enlarge and strengthen the organization of the Red Guards 2nd Young
 Pioneers. Next we must insure ample supplies of provisions for the Red Army
 and daily necessities for the living of the masses.  Here we must broadly
 unfold the land investigation movement, deepen the class struggle in the cities
 and rural areas, absolutely consolidate the soviet political power, develop
 the national economy in a planned way, widely establish cooperatives of the
 masses, issue economic construction bonds, redistribute foodgrains, expand
 external trade, break the enemy's economic blockade, and seize material
 conditions of the revolutionary war.   These are our important fighting tasks
 at the present time!!
 Finally, with a view to successfully carrying out war emergency mobilization
 and totally smashing the enemy's fifth "encirclement and suppression" cam-
 paign, we must oppose the inadequacies of the assessment of the present new
 revolutionary situation, oppose all psychological fatigue of the war, in
 particular oppose those opportunists who have shown alarm and helplessness
 and wanted to beat a retreat in the face of the enemy's fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" campaign!  At the same time we must also oppose those "left"
 determinists of empty talk,and victory!   These "left" and rightist opportunists
 are the fiercest enemies of war mobilization and they actually help our class
 enemies!
 Workers, peasants and Red soldiers of the whole soviet sector!  Now we are
 confronted with a new revolutionary situation.  We must sacrifice our all and
 assume our great historical mission!   Comrades! We are now in the face of
 the more cruel and devastating battle of the war!  We are now in the face of
 totally smashing the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign and we are
 also in the face of the first victory in the revolution of Kiangsi and several
 other neighboring provinces!.

 PROCLAMATION OF PROVISIONAL CENTRAL GOVERNMENT ON CONVENING THE SECOND
 NATIONAL SOVIET CONGRESS
 1 August 1933
 [Text]   It has been 2 full years now since the convening of the First
 National Soviet Congress.  These 2 years have been the years in which
 imperialism has frantically intensified its attacks against the Soviet Union
 and the Chinese revolution, the imperialist Kuomintang has carried out its
 most barbarous massacre and encircling attacks against the soviet areas of the
 whole country, and the Kuomintang has sold out China by shamelessly surrendering
 to Japanese and all other imperialisms.  But these have also been the 2 years
 in which under the correct leadership of the Central Soviet Government the
 Worker-Peasant Red Army has won great glorious victories through arduous
 struggle.  During the struggle of these 2 years we have expanded and consoli-
 dated our soviet political power and we have gained infinitely rich and in-
 valuable experience.  With a view to focusing our leadership of China's
 national soviet movement, further developing and consolidating the soviet
 political power, and summing up the soviet experience of the past 2 years,
 the Central Soviet Government decides to convene the Second National Soviet
 Congress in the Red capital of Jui-chin on the 6th anniversary of the Canton
 Uprising (11 December 1933).
 During the past 2 years, China's national crisis has worsened.  The intensified
 aggression of imperialism and the selling out by the Kuomintang have brought
 several million li of Ohinese territory in the three northeastern Provinces,
 Jehol, Peking and Tientsin and tens of millions of Chinese people under the
 iron yoke of Japanese imperialism.  Because of the consistent surrender and
 selling out by the Kuomintang, the imperialist dismemberment of China has
 advanced rapidly.  The tragic fate of the complete colonization of China has
 been hanging over the heads of the Chinese people in the whole country.
 During the past 2 years the total collapse of the Chinese national economy has
 become ever more acute.   The wholesale bankruptcies of national industries,
 the ultimate collapse of the rural economy, and the widespread incidence of
 floods, drought and famine all over the land have driven the overwhelming
 majority of workers and peasants to the road of joblessness, starvation and
 death.  Yet the Kuomintang warlords just keep on exploiting the people without
 any letup.   In Szechwan Province they have already levied land rents in ad-
 vance to the year 1971, and the number and variety of exorbitant taxes and

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 taxes and miscellaneous contributions have reached a total of 1,700 or more.
 Throughout the country landlords and evil gentry have exploited the peasants
 more ruthlessly than ever.  Capitalists have also intensified their attack
 against the workers.  Conflicts and internecine wars between and among the
 warlords have further quickened the pace of the collapse of China's national
 economy.  The pain and suffering of the workers and peasants in the whole coun-
 try have truly reached indescribable proportions!
 Dear comrades!  The workers and peasants of China cannot and will not tolerate
 such a state of affairs.  The fires of the revolutionary torches are burning
 all over the country and the heroic struggle against imperialism and the
 Kuomintang is unfolding itself--from demonstrations, strikes, riots to geurilla
 warfare and large-scale revolutionary war.  Furthermore, during the past' 2
 years the great victories of the Chinese soviet workers and peasants and the
 Red Army, the tremendous developments of the soviet areas, and the vigorous
 expansion of the heroic Red Army from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands
 constitute the most powerful lever in the development of the revolutionary
 situation in China.
 Now two roads lie ahead of the Chinese people:  the imperialist-Kuomintang
 road and the soviet road!  Under the rule of the imperialist-Kuomintang, China
 can only become completely the colony of imperialism whereas under the soviet
 political power imperialism has already been totally overthrown.  Representing
 the revolutionary masses of the whole country, the Central Soviet Government
 has formally declared war against Japan.  It has on the one hand led the heroic
 Red Army in vigorously launching the national revolutionary war and defeating
 the Kuomintang warlords who had prevented the Red Army from advancing north to
 resist Japan and on the other hand several times called on the White armed
 forces of the whole country to cease attacking the soviet areas and conclude
 with the Red Army an agreement of war against Japan. Under the rule of the
 imperialist-Kuomintang, the workers, peasants and soldiers have been suffering
 from the ruthless exploitation and suppression of the evil gentry, landlord-
 bourgeoisie and Kuomintang warlords and driven into bankruptcy and jobless-
 ness, even death and starvation.  Under the soviet political power, feudal and.
 semi-feudal exploitation by the evil gentry and landlords has been completely
 eliminated.  Here laboring peasants and Red fighters have been awarded land,
 the working class has received the protection of labor laws, the soviet economic
 construction is surging vigorously ahead, and the livelihood of the workers
 and peasants has been greatly improved.  Under the rule of the imperialist-
 Kuomintang, workers and peasants have been frequently subjected to arrest,
 imprisonment and slaughter.  All freedom of speech, assembly, conscience, and
 in particular the freedom to resist Japan and oppose imperialism has been
 denied, and the organs of political power are completely in the hands of a
 small minority of landlords and capitalists.  On the other hand, under the soviet
 political power workers and. peasants have gained their complete political
 freedom and the exploiting class (capitalists, landlords, rich peasants, etc.)
 has been deprived of its political rights.   For the first time in the history
 of China workers and peasants govern their own country and become its ruling
 class with the working class as its leading force.   It cannot be pointed out

 more clearly by all this that the only road to save China is the soviet road
 and that the victory of the soviet revolution is the victory of the people of
 the whole country against imperialism and the landlord-bourgeosie.  It is pre-
 cisely for this reason that the Kuomintang and all counterrevolutionary cliques,
 under the direct command and organization of imperialism, have mobilized all
 their.forces to mount futile attacks against the soviet sector and the
 Red Army.  Although the enemy's 1st, 2d, 3rd and 4th "encirclement and sup-
 pression" campaigns have been totally smashed by the iron fists of the heroic
 Red Army, the imperialist-Kuomintang, with a view to making its last stand, is
 actively preparing to launch even more cruelly its fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" major campaign which is aimed at the complete destruction of the
 soviets and the Red Army.  This "encirclement and suppression" campaign of the
 imperialist-Kuomintang is a necessary and major step on the way to the seizure
 of China as a colony.  All people of China should concentrate all their forces
 to smash this "encirclement and suppression" campaign and fight for the victory
 of Soviet China.
 The Central Government of Soviet China calls on the toiling masses of the
 workers and peasants and the revolutionary soldiers to rise against the
 imperialist aggression and selling out by the Kuomintang, against the
 imperialist-Kuomintang's fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign against
 the Soviet Red Army, to smash this campaign, overthrow the Kuomintang rule
 of the landlord-bourgeoisie, support the Second National Soviet Congress, and
 elect delegates to this Congress fighting for the future of Soviet China.  Re-
 lying on the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for their revolutionary struggle,
 relying on the invincibility of our heroic Worker-Peasant Red Army and relying
 on the correct leadership of the staunch proletariat of China and their
 vanguard the Communist Party, the victory will surely be ours!
 People of all China, rise enthusiastically to struggle for a new Soviet China!
 Long live the Second National Soviet Congress!

 CABLE OF GREETINGS FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TO RED ARMY IN EASTERN AREA FOR
 ITS GREAT VICTORY
 8 August 1933
 [Text]  Political Commissar of General Command Headquarters of the fighting
 Red Army in Eastern Area for transmittal to all commanders and combat comrades:
 You heroes have beaten the enemy's recalcitrant 19th Route Army on the
 eastern. front like fallen flowers in a flowing stream.  This victory demon-
 strates the growing strength and increasing invincibility of the Worker-Peasant
 Red Army.  It presents the imperialist-Kuomintang which is preparing for its
 fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign with a grave threat and also
 constitutes an initial victory in the smashing of the enemy's threat and also
 constitutes an initial victory in the smashing of the enemy's fifth "encircle-
 ment and suppression" campaign.  We are very happy to learn of this victory.
 During the present period of the historical turning point in the decisive
 victory or defeat between the revolution and the counterrevolution, the Central
 Soviet Government is organizing and leading the Red Army and hundreds of
 millions of the toiling masses of workers and peasants in smashing the enemy's
 fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign and fighting for the cause of
 Soviet China.  We believe you heroes will surely bring to your task even more
 courage by advancing and destroying more enemies and winning still greater and
 more glorious victories.

 CENTRAL GOVERNMENT CABLE CONGRATULATING THE INAUGURATION OF THE
 INTERNATIONAL ANTI-IMPERIALIST AND ANTI-WAR CONGRESS
 August 1933
 [Text]  Delegates to the International Anti-imperialist and Anti-war
 Congress:
 On behalf of the toiling worker-peasant masses of the entire China, the
 Provisional Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China extends its
 proletarian salute to all the delegates to the Congress!   Courageous van-
 guard on the anti-imperialist front. You disregard the White terror of the
 imperialist Kuomintang and the threats of fascists and police and detectives,
 and resolutely call a world anti-imperialist and anti-war congress in
 Shanghai which is under the joint control of international imperialism and
 laid waste by the cannons of Japan.  We wish to express our unlimited
 admiration-and eager hopes!   The inauguration of the congress is an
 unprecedented success won by the international worker class and all the
 toiling masses on the united front under the anti-imperialist international.
 We firmly believe that the congress will be able to lead the anti-imperialist
 warriors of the whole world to resist, by concrete measures, the undeclared
 Far East war for the purpose of entirely colonizing China and the imminent
 and urgent international imperialist war against Soviet Russia.
 The toiling masses of the entire China completely and profoundly understand
 the sharp opposition between the (Lytton) inquiry group and the international
 anti-imperialist and anti-war delegation.   Our political experience tells
 us that the former is the planner and organizer of the bandit international
 imperialism to divide up China, while the latter, which is you--you are the
 most effective helper of the people of the entire China in resisting the
 imperialist bandit aggression and striving for China's independence and
 freedom and liberation.  We hope you will reveal the truth of all the
 imperialist inhuman conduct, crimes, and conspiracies in China to our
 worker-peasant brothers of the whole world.  Meanwhile, we enthusiastically
 welcome you to come and inspect the soviet areas, contrast the revolutionary
 fervor of the workers and peasants in the soviet areas, the improvement in
 their living, and all the constructions of the soviet government against

 the hunger, death, unemployment, and famine which you see in the imperialist
 Kuomintang controlled areas, spread it among the workers, peasants, and
 soldiers of the world, and arouse their excitement and sympathy!
 Currently, China is in the midst of a violent war between the two paths--the
 colonial and the soviet paths.   The fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 against the soviet Red Army launched recklessly by the imperialist Kuomintang
 is to make China follow completely the colonial path, while we are concen-
 trating all forces to smash the enemy's desperate attack, block the
 imperialist colonial path, and struggle for the road of an.independent and
 free soviet China. We believe that the congress is in complete sympathy
 with us.   Therefore, the success of the congress is our success; the victory
 of the congress is our victory.  Leading the workers and peasants of the
 entire China and the Red Army, we unanimously support the congress in its
 successful progress, and we wish to express our sincere congratulations for
 its great advance!

 Cable from the Central Government to the International Anti-imperialist
 and Anti-war Congress, 30 August 1933
 [Text] Delegates to the International Anti-imperialist and Anti-war
 Congress, and Proletariat, Toiling Masses, and All Revolutionaries of
 the Whole World!
 PROLETARIAT AND OPPRESSED NATIONS OF THE WHOLE WORLD, UNITE;
 The intensification of the panic of world capitalism and the end of the
 temporary stabilization of postwar capitalism have caused the imperialist
 bourgeoisie to launch more reckless attacks on the proletariat and toiling
 masses of their own nations, to place all the burdens of the economic
 crisis on them, and to handle the organizations of the worker class and all
 revolutionary actions with the most cruel fascist bloody means.  In Germany,
 in Italy, in Japan, and in all the capitalist nations in the world, the mad
 tide of fascism is waging a death struggle against the revolutionary
 movement of the worker, class and toiling masses of the whole world.
 Towards the outside, the imperialist nations are preparing to launch an
 imperialist war in order to find a way out of the economic crisis.   Their
 attack on Soviet Russia and their plunder of the colonies have been
 reenforced.   By means of a bandit war, Japanese imperialism first occupied
 the vast areas of China's Manchuria, Jehol, Chahar, and Lo-tung and placed
 50 million toiling masses under its heel.   British imperialism is using
 Tibetan troops in western China to occupy our provinces of Hsi-k'ang and
 Szechwan and is preparing to make all of western China a British colony.
 Others such as French and American imperialism are also competing to
 divide up China's territory.  Waging a violent imperialist war, they wish
 to divide anew their market in China!
 The loathsome imperialist bourgeoisie is the common enemy of the proletariat
 and toiling masses of the world.  In China, they ally with the Kuomintang--the
 loathsome White terror--and arm over 1 million Kuomintang troops with guns,
 cannons, airplanes, and poison gas bombs at a cost of hundreds of millions
 of dollars to attack China's revolutionary base and its soviet areas,
 attempting to extinguish its revolutionary movement with bloody massacres.

 They wish to turn China completely into an imperialist colony in order to
 maintain their control and,to continue their exploitation and enslavement
 of their domestic proletariat.   This is the fifth time that the Kuomintang
 government, with the aid of imperialism, has launched large-scale attacks
 on China's soviet areas.
 The Provisional Central Covernment of the Soviet Republic of China declares
 to the proletariat and toiling.masses of the whole world:  The Provisional
 Central Government of the Soviet Republic of China is the representative
 of the oppressed people of the entire China.
 The Soviet Republic of China was consolidated and developed in the anti-
 imperialist war in the past; now it will deal a fatal blow to the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression" of the soviet areas launched by imperialism
 through the Kuomintang.  It negates all secret treaties. between the
 imperialist powers and China's Kuomintang government.   It is in the process
 of appealing to, mobilizing, and arming the people of the entire China.
 It will resist the imperialist attempt to divide China with the war of
 national revolution, fundamentally overthrow the imperialist control in
 China, and establish a soviet political power of the entire China, in
 order to preserve its independence and unity and its territorial integrity.
 It is a staunch partner to the proletariat and toiling masses of the whole
 world in their struggle against imperialism.
 Proletariat and toiling masses and all revolutionaries of the whole world!
 On behalf of the oppressed people of China, the Provisional Central
 Government of the Soviet Republic of China appeals to you to line up with
 us and overthrow the common enemy of the workers, toiling masses, and all
 revolutionaries of the whole world--the world imperialist bourgeoisie'.
 We request that you adopt all means to block the imperialist nations from
 sending guns and cannons, airplanes, and poison gas bombs to China and
 slaughtering the people of China.  We appeal to the soldiers of your nations
 to resist imperialist aggression of colonies and refuse to slaughter
 China's masses in the interest of the imperialist bourgeoisie:
 The proletariat and oppressed nations of the whole world, unite!
 Resist imperialist wars!   Resist imperialist division of China!   Down
 with world imperialism!

 Directive of the Central People's Committee, 28 August 1933
 [Text]   Three million yuan of economic construction bonds have begun to be
 issued in the various areas in Jui-chin.  According to the most recent
 experiences of Jui-chin, though Yun-chi District and other areas adopted
 the correct method and made a great achievement, several other districts
 committed grave errors.   The main manifestation was that the district
 soviet presidium did not closely tackle bond selling and place it on its
 daily agenda for discussion and inspection, but considered it the function
 of the finance department.   It did not activate the mass organizations of
 the district level for unanimous mobilization.  As a result, the extremely
 serious situation of equal distribution appeared in many townships.
 Without going through the discussion and recognition by the labor unions,
 poor peasants' leagues, women's delegates' association, and other mass
 organizations, without making reports at the township soviet delegates'
 meeting, and without holding mass meetings to explain clearly the signifi-
 cance of the bonds, the bonds were issued to the township soviet, which,
 in turn, divided them evenly among the township delegates, who, in turn,
 divided them evenly among the masses.  Whether the masses understood or not,
 the bonds were evenly divided.   Some individual areas forced the middle
 peasants to buy bonds.  If they refused, they were called rich peasants.
 Consequently,_the masses in many areas were dissatisfied, and the sale of
 bonds was hampered.  However, it was entirely different in Yun-chi District.
 Because the Yun-chi District soviet adopted the correct method of mobili-
 zation toward the townships and gave detailed explanations to the cadres
 of the township level, and the cadres, in turn, propagandized to the masses,
 it made a great achievement.  The district pledged to sell 40,700 yuan of
 bonds.   In less than 3 weeks, it had sold 25,500 yuan's worth of bonds.
 Yang-ch'i township was the best.   It had sold all 4,600 yuan of bonds
 undertaken by it.   The glorious examples of Yun-chi District and Yang-ch'i
 township are worthy of emulation by all the soviet areas.   For the satis-
 factory result of bond selling this time, the Central Government specifies
 the following points on the method of mobilization.   The governments of all
 levels must implement them completely.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 1.   The provincial soviet must give close attention to the work of bond
 issuance in the province and discuss, motivate, and inspect it.  It must
 gather the experiences of bond selling in the county where it is located
 and compile the good and bad examples of the mobilization into a document
 for the guidance of all the counties in the province.
 2.   The county  soviet must give close attention to the work of bond
 issuance in the county and discuss, motivate, and inspect it.  It must
 gather the experiences of bond selling in the several counties near the
 county soviet and compile the good and bad examples into a document for
 the guidance of the districts.
 The county soviet must, for the purpose of selling bonds, summon all the
 district chairmen and finance department chiefs for a meeting.    Even in
 counties where the bonds have not been received, such meetings must be
 called, so that the districts will embark upon the mobilization work
 without delay.   They must not wait until the bonds have arrived before
 holding a meeting and discussing.  After the bonds have been issued, they
 must again call a meeting of the district chairmen to inspect the work and
 rectify the errors.
 3.  The district soviet is the pivot to sell bonds and mobilize the masses.
 It must call a meeting of the township soviet chairmen, poor peasants'
 league chairmen, and the responsible persons of other mass organizations
 and explain to them in detail the significance of bond issuance and the
 method of mobilizing the masses.  Meanwhile, it must send men to the
 various townships and help the township soviets call meetings of township
 delegates, poor peasants' leagues, labor unions, and other mass organi-
 zations and make detailed explanations to them.  Village and hamlet mass
 meetings must be held through the cadres of the township level and the
 significance of the economic construction bonds explained in detail to the
 masses.   If the masses cannot understand after one meeting, another meeting
 must be held again.   When necessary, there may be a third meeting in areas
 where it is required.   The masses must be made to understand that buying
 bonds is in their own interest and for the victory of the war, so that they
 will eagerly buy them.
 4.   The government presidiums of all levels and the township soviet chairmen
 must strictly prevent the error of even distribution'.   They must understand
 that even distribution is thorough bureaucraticism and an extremely erroneous
 method which will block the sale of bonds.   On the other hand, it will make
 .it easy for the counterrevolutionaries to create rumors and deceive the
 people; on the other hand, it will not arouse the revolutionary fervor of
 the worker-peasant masses.   If even distribution is again discovered in the
 future, the higher level government must rectify it immediately.   If the
 error is not corrected after rectification, punishment must be dealt out.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 5.  Prohibition of even distribution is for the purpose of encouraging the
 masses to buy bonds voluntarily.  The names of those who buy more bonds and
 the amounts bought by them must be posted at the gate of the township soviet
 to serve as models.  But absolutely no one must be forced to buy bonds.  If
 a person refuses to buy, the representatives of the township soviet and
 women's delegates' association, and the members of the labor union and poor
 peasants' league must persuade and encourage him to buy bonds.  Those who
 have bought bonds may be asked to persuade those who have not.  Those who
 have bought more bonds in a village may be organized into a propaganda team
 to promote the sale of bonds.
 6.   Concerning propaganda work, the Central Government has already made an
 announcement.  Upon receipt of the announcement, the township government
 must immediately post it in the villages and hamlets.   The Central Govern-
 ment has also issued a propaganda outline on the economic construction
 bonds.   The work personnel and propaganda teams of the district and town-
 ship soviets must follow the articles in the outline and perform propaganda
 and encouragement work toward the masses.
 7.   The masses may pay for the bonds in cash or grain.  The district soviet
 will set. the price of grain according to the local market value and notify
 the townships.
 8.   The district soviets must guide the townships to form bond selling
 competition agreements.   Besides the figures, the agreement must provide
 that no bureaucraticist method, such as coercive distribution, is allowed.
 The time limit must not be set too short (naturally nor too long either),
 because it will make full mobilization impossible.
 Attention must be given to all the eight points above.  The provincial and
 county soviets must send men to the counties and districts to inspect and
 determine whether they are implementing fully this directive of the Central
 Government.   The county soviets must make a simple summary of the district
 in their own counties which was most successful in selling bonds and mail
 it to "RED CHINA" for publication, in order to encourage all the soviet
 areas.  It is so ordered.

 [Text]  At a time when the Red Army is victorious, the soviet areas are
 expanding, and the revolutionary movement is vigorously progressing, the
 principle of the soviet financial policy must be:   (1) Place the burden on
 the exploiting class in both soviet and White areas, mainly by imposing
 fines on the landlords, assessing donations from the rich peasants, and
 levying appropriate taxes from the merchants, provided such taxes do not
 damage the economic growth of the soviet areas.   (2)  Vigorously promote
 economic construction and, by developing the national economy, breaking
 down the enemy blockade, and restricting exploitation by the merchants,
 increase the revenue of the soviet.   (3)   Rely on the revolutionary fervor
 of the laboring peasant masses to collect suitable land taxes for the
 treasury of the state.   These constitute the fundamental principle of the
 soviet financial policy.
 Under this principle, the soviet financial organ must, by revolutionary
 means, sound organization, and careful planning, expand the revenue and
 make it compatible with the development of the revolutionary war.  All
 conservative concepts and disorderly conditions apart from the political
 tasks are extremely detrimental.
 So far, the work of the soviet financial organ, under the supervision of the
 People's Committee, has shown considerable achievements in supplying the
 war needs and building an accounting system, but it has not adhered to the
 correct policy in regard to the principle of the financial policy.   Instead
 of devoting the maximum effort to raise funds from the exploiters and
 increase revenue by developing the national economy, it has concentrated on
 tax revenues and paper currency bonds.  Meanwhile, its assessment of the
 development of the revolution is inadequate, resulting in a lack of
 financial planning.   This constitutes a hindrance to large-scale financial
 administration.   In leadership pattern, if, instead of relying on the urban
 and rural soviets and the worker-peasant mass organizations and mobilizing
 the broad masses through them in fund raising, one depends on the small
 number of work personnel of the district level and above, the task cannot

 .be completely fulfilled.   Such bureaucratic leadership'pattern exists to a
 large extent in the soviet financial organ.  On the issue of cadres,
 attention is not given to training and promoting large groups of financial
 administration work personnel, nor to criticizing and weeding out some of
 the corrupt and decadent elements.  All these are the result of failing
 to implement the correct class line and of making opportunist assessments
 of the revolutionary situation, and Comrade Teng Tzu-hui [6772 1311 1863],
 people's finance commissioner, must be mainly responsible.
 The People's Committee feels that this situation must not be allowed to
 continue; it commands the new chief of the people's finance department,
 Comrade Lin Po?-chlu [2651 0130 3255], to rectify it fundamentally.
 Self-criticism in the entire financial system must be launched in order to
 rectify the erroneous understanding of the financial policy, formulate
 financial plans compatible with the development of the war, change the
 leadership pattern, promote and train large groups of financial work
 personnel, and eliminate the partial corruption and decadence in the
 financial system, so that the entire soviet financial system will rapidly
 become sound and the soviet financial administration will become compatible
 with the, development of the revolution, furnishing the full financial
 condition to the revolutionary war and thoroughly smashing the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression" of the imperialist Kuomintang.   It is so
 ordered.

 PRELIMINARY SUMMARY OF THE LAND INVESTIGATION MOVEMENT
 August 1933
 [Text]   I.  A Great Success
 The land investigation movement, under the appeal of the Party and the
 Central Government, has been extensively launched.  If the movement in the
 past was considered as an initial stage only, then the work in the 1 month
 of July, after the eight-county land investigation mass meeting in June,
 surpassed the achievement of more than half year since last winter.  Generally
 speaking, in the eight counties included in the mass meeting, the movement
 has reached a new stage and become an extensive mass movement.  The
 achievements of Jui-chin and Po-sheng were the greatest, uncovering a total
 of two thousand and several hundred landlords and rich peasants.  Initial
 achievements were made in the counties of Sheng-li, Yu-tu, Hui-ch'ang,
 Ting-tung, Ch'ang-t'ing, Shih-ch'eng, and Ning-hua.  In all the districts
 and townships where achievements were made, extensive mass struggles have
 started.   In soviet work and party work, there was much. stagnation in the
 past, but now the work has become lively.  Many of the undesirable
 elements in the soviet were purged, and the counterrevolutionaries hidden
 in the rural villages encountered severe suppression.  In other words, the
 remnant feudal forces suffered a tragic defeat at the hands of the broad
 masses.   On this foundation, all kinds of work developed even more.   In
 areas where the land investigation movement had made achievements, great
 successes were also made in the.expansion of the Red Army and the local
 militia,. the sale of economic construction bonds, the development of the
 cooperative, fall harvesting and fall plowing, the launching of labor
 mutual aid associations, and such cultural undertakings as clubs, night
 schools, and elementary schools.   All items of work became more successful.
 On the foundation of mass activeness, large groups of positive elements
 made themselves into cadres for all types of work, and many among the workers
 and peasants joined the party and enlisted in soviet work.   The best
 example was Jen-t'ien District in Jui-chin.  With the help of the work
 group of the Central Government, Jen-t'ien District, in its land investigation
 movement, activated the masses of the entire district in 55 days, thoroughly
 eliminated the feudal remnants, uncovered over 300 landlords and rich

 peasants, executed by shooting 12 counterrevolutionaries known as "big
 tigers" by the people, and suppressed counterrevolutionary activities.
 Certain elements among the soviet work personnel committing serious errors
 were accused at mass meetings, and certain class deviationists infiltrating
 the soviet were purged.  Some 27,000 tan of land were ascertained in the
 entire district, and the more than 20,000 toiling masses received an
 additional 1 tan 2 ton of land per capita.  Large quantities of money and
 things belonging to the rich gentry and landlords were distributed to the
 masses.  Due to the unprecedented height of mass positivity, over 700 new
 Red Army soldiers, were recruited into the Jui-chin Model Division in
 55 days, without even one desertion.  The amount of grain saved and sold
 to the Red Army reached 1,900 tan or more, an accomplishment which no
 other district in the entire county could match.  Under the demand of the
 townships, the district undertook to sell 40,000 yuan of economic construc-
 tion bonds; 7,500 yuan were collected from landlord fines and rich peasant
 donations; the district promised to continue to raise 10,000 yuan.
 Cooperatives developed rapidly, and cultural and educational constructions,
 such as clubs, literacy classes, and night schools, also increased.   The
 number of party members expanded; the Party's leadership strengthened;
 labor union work improved.  A new atmosphere emerged in the district.  From
 the backward district of Jui-chin, it reversed itself in 55 days and became
 a first class district similar to Wu-yang.  Why did Jen-t'ien District make
 such great achievements?  We must point out that it was because they
 realized the importance of the task of land investigation and because they
 firmly followed the correct directives of the Central Bureau and the Central
 Government in their mobilization pattern, class line, and mass work and
 performed true Bolshevik work.  In regard to understanding the tasks, they
 understood the close links between the land investigation movement and the
 revolutionary war; therefore, they performed the work conscientiously,
 closely tackled the leadership of the movement, and arranged the work of the
 local area with plans.   In regard to the mobilization pattern, they tightly
 tackled the work of the seven townships which were most, or relatively,
 backward among the 11 townships in the district, activated the party, the
 league, the township soviet, the labor union, the poor peasants' league,
 and other mass organizations of the  seven townships, and mobilized the
 broad masses through them.  In regard to the class line, they firmly
 followed the strategy of relying on the farm laborers and poor peasants
 and allying with the middle peasants, and extensively developed the poor
 peasants' league.  They explained that land investigation was not land
 division and that class investigation did not include the middle peasants,
 poor peasants, and farm laborers.  Their work on "discussing the classes"
 was adequately performed.  When the landlords and rich peasants of 0-feng
 township frightened the middle peasants and caused alarm in some of them,
 our comrades held individual conversations with several middle peasants
 who spread our ideas to other middle peasants.  The middle peasants of 0-feng
 township immediately settled down and actively supported the land
 investigation policy of the soviet.   Instead of continuing to be defrauded
 by the landlords and rich peasants, they joined the poor peasants and
 workers and attacked the landlords and rich peasants together.  The comrades
 of Jen-t'ien District did make mistakes on the classification of several

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 households, but they remedied them promptly.   In regard to guiding the
 mass struggles, they first made extensive propaganda.  Instead of holding
 meetings of the entire district and township, they held village and hamlet
 meetings, contacted broader masses, and propagandized to and encouraged them
 many times.  Therefore, the masses of the entire district understood that
 land and class investigations were their responsibilities and in their
 interest.  Next, they investigated the class components and activated many
 people to perform the task.  Material evidence on the various components
 was carefully collected and shown to the masses; therefore, there was no
 incident of dissatisfaction among the masses.   Subsequently, through the
 class classifications, the land investigation committee first made an
 analysis and decision which were handed to  the poor peasants' organization
 for discussion and passage and then submitted to the district soviet for
 approval.  Thereafter, they proceeded to the village where the party whose
 property was to be confiscated resided and called a village mass meeting.
 Only after a clear explanation of the case and the raising of hands to
 show support was the property confiscated.  In regard to the distribution
 of money and  things and land, the work personnel all understood that they,
 themselves, must serve as the models and refrain from taking anything.
 They distributed everything to the masses, a larger amount to the village
 where the property was found and a smaller amount to other villages, and
 won the satisfaction of the masses.  Land was also promptly divided.   The
 situation of prolonged delays in other areas was not found in Jen-t'ien
 district.  Therefore, the masses were rapidly activated.  The way they
 attacked the backward big villages was also correct.  They were not afraid
 of the big villages, but nor did they use brute force.  What they did was
 to concentrate their forces, make more propaganda, try to win over the
 local positive elements, rallying and educating them, and activate the
 remainder of the masses through them.  They were very patient in performing
 such village work which appeared to be slow but actually very fast.  In 55
 days, they  activated all the backward big villages in the district and
 eliminated their backwardness within a short time.  When they were unable to
 enter a village in Po-k'eng township because of the two well-known "big
 tigers" there, they adopted a different means.   The two rascals were
 arrested and tried in the local mobile court and, with the enthusiastic
 support of the masses, executed by shooting.  The mass struggle in this
 village spread like wildfire.  They held 10 mass trial meetings and mobile
 court meetings, all via a very extensive mass line.  Most of the people
 of the township attended while all the villages of other townships sent
 delegates, 10 or more from the small townships, and 40 or 50 from the large
 townships.   Therefore, the results of each public trial and judgment were
 immediately spread to all the townships and villages of the district.
 Besides realizing the justice of punishing or killing the culprit, the
 masses of all the townships and villages immediately-thought of similar
 evil elements in their own areas who also should be punished.  The land
 investigation movement of Jen-t'ien District is truly a model for the
 entire soviet area!   Chiu-pao District of Jui-chin also was very successful.
 They first closely tackled three townships, summoned the members of their
 land investigation committees to the district soviet for a 3-day training
 class, and explained the mobilization method, the class line, and the
 means to win the masses.   On the issue of distributing the confiscated

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 property, they created a good method.  When a landlord's household was to
 be confiscated, they would ask the masses of the village and the household
 to gather together, elect a confiscation distribution committee, proceed
 with the confiscation under the supervision of the masses, pile the things
 confiscated in an open space, and distribute them to those entitled with
 the approval of  the masses.  The edibles were handled in a different
 manner.  They slaughtered hogs and cooked rice for a big meal for the
 masses.  This  method produced a great effect in Chiu-pao District.  Their
 confiscation distribution committee was not a regular organization, but a
 temporary one, thus creating a closer association with the masses.   (As
 for the distribution of confiscated land, it was still handled by the
 regular land committee).  The confiscated things were not taken to the
 township soviet, nor did they wait until several households were
 confiscated before distribution; therefore, delay and theft were avoided.
 Chiu-pao District was just as correct on other lines and methods; therefore,
 they could activate the broad masses for class investigation.  They were so
 successful that no landlord or rich peasant appeared at the township soviet
 to object to the classification, which was completely contrary to the condition
 of land investigation in the past.   In the past, there were always many
 investigated landlords and rich peasants who appeared at the soviet to
 object, claiming that the classification was wrong.  Not just themselves,
 but even the responsible persons of the township representing the poor
 peasants' organization would come forward and argue for them.   This time,
 naturally, it was not because the landlords and rich peasants did not want
 to object, but they could not do so.  No one of their clan or among their
 relatives supported them. They were incapacitated, and it was impossible
 for them to object.  It showed that Chiu-pao District performed adequate
 work in activating the masses, for otherwise they could not have attained
 this stage.
 All such glorious exemplary instances (not scarce in other areas) constituted
 a Bolshevik response to the appeal of the Party and the Central Government
 and proved the absolute accuracy of the directives of the Central Bureau
 and the Central Government.  Anywhere where such directives were completely
 implemented, great successes were immediately made.  Anywhere where they
 were violated or overlooked, errors were committed in the work, and little
 or no achievement was made.  Let me prove this point by the facts.
 II.  Some Areas Relinquished the Leadership of the Land Investigation
 Movement.
 In regard to the fighting task of the land investigation movement, after
 the promulgation of the decision of the Central Bureau, the issuance of
 the. directive of the Central Government, and the mass meeting of the eight
 counties, the development of the movement did not reach all areas.   The
 land investigation achievement of the entire province of Fukien, for instance,
 was only equivalent to that of the county of Po-sheng; the achievement of
 Sheng-li, Yu-tu, Hui-ch'ang, or Shih-ch'eng could only match that of the
 best one or two districts of Jui-chin.  The land investigation committees
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 of many areas had not even held one meeting, and even the county land
 investigation committees of several counties failed to tackle the land
 investigation work of the county (Hui-ch'ang, Yu-tu, Shih--ch'eng, and
 Ning-hua).   In many districts and townships land investigation committees,
 the district and township chairmen did not serve as the committee chairmen.
 On grounds of being busy in other matters, they relinquished the task of
 land investigation.  In regard to Party leadership of land investigation,
 in all areas where land investigation was successful, the effect of the
 Party's firm leadership was clearly demonstrated, and the majority of the
 Party membership masses, under the guidance of the Party branch and district
 committee, performed much courageous Bolshevik fighting work.   On the other
 hand, wherever land investigation achieved little, or nothing, the Party
 unit's neglect of the movement was apparent.  Almost 2 months after the
 promulgation of the land investigation decision of the Central Bureau, the
 Hui-ch'ang county committee, for instance, never once discussed land
 investigation work.  Not until the end of July did they hold a meeting on
 the matter.   In one period, the Pu-hsiao district committee paid no attention
 to the land investigation movement at all.  Though the urban committee of
 Jui-chin held one meeting for land investigation, it did not activate the
 suburban branch committees to give attention to the leadership of land
 investigation, and none of the branches ever held a meeting for the
 movement.   In other areas, such as the county committees of Yu-tu, Sheng-li,
 Shih-ch'eng, and Ning-hua and many district committees, they also failed
 to pay close attention to the work of land investigation.   The party and
 the Central Government said:  "The land investigation movement has become
 an effective means to activate the masses for intensive rural class struggle,
 thoroughly solve the land issue, and eliminate feudalism or semi-feudalism"
 (decision of the Central Bureau); "the land investigation movement is an
 urgent task of the soviets of all areas" (directive of the Central Government);
 "the land investigation movement is the most important link in the current
 work" (summary of the eight-county mass meeting).  Meanwhile, many of our
 comrades said:   "Too busy; no time to look after the land investigation
 movement."  The Party resolution stated:   "The superficial attitude of
 handling the land investigation movement with bureaucraticism and formalism
 is most detrimental."  Yet these comrades still handled the land investigation
 with bureaucraticism.
 III.   Some Areas Actually Capitulated to the Rich Peasants.
 In areas where the land investigation was launched, there still appeared
 many individual serious errors.   One often came across individual comrades
 in the local Party unit or soviet who, in face of the violent class struggle
 of the land investigation movement, indicated their opportunist vacillations.
 This was mainly because, during the  vigorous development of the movement,
 they were unable to abandon their clan o- local relationships but sheltered
 the landlords and rich peasants of their own clan or village.   Or they
 erroneously analyzed the class components, considering the landlords as
 rich peasants and the rich peasants as middle peasants.   Some work comrades
 of the judicial department, by their extreme negligence, accepted the false
 accusations of the positive elements in the land investigation by the land-
 lords and rich peasants in the name of the people.   In another aspect,

 some of our security bureau and judicial department comrades failed to keep
 pace with the development of the  mass class investigation struggle and
 actively suppress the counterrevolution, and they even turned down the demands
 of the masses to arrest and execute the landlord and rich peasant elements
 who resisted the land investigation.  The judicial department of Jui-chin
 was an example of making all those mistakes.
 IV.   The Tendency to Encroach Upon the Middle Peasants Is the Most
 Serious Danger.
 The "leftwing" opportunist tendency, in the July land investigation,
 appeared .in many areas.  Here, the tendency to encroach upon the middle
 peasants must be emphatically pointed out.  The Central Bureau clearly
 indicated in its resolution:   "Special attention must be given to the
 alliance with the middle peasant masses.   They are the broadest basic masses
 in the soviet village after the revolution; therefore, we must win their
 approval and support in all our measures and strategies.   Every decision
 made by a poor peasant organization or the soviet must acquire the support
 of the middle peasant masses at the village or hamlet mass meetings, and
 all appeals of the middle peasant masses must be heeded.  Any attempt to
 encroach upon their interest must be severely discouraged."   It was pointed
 out at the conclusion of the eight-county mass meeting:  "The goal of land
 investigation is class investigation, not redivision of land....  Allying
 with the middle peasants must start from not encroaching upon their interest....
 At,the beginning of the land investigation, we must generally propagandize
 the soviet policy of allying with the middle peasants and guard against
 encroaching upon their interest.   In the process of land investigation, we
 must carefully decide on the borderline cases between the middle and rich
 peasants and avoid mistakes."  However, the comrades of many areas did not
 pay attention to such instructions.  In the land investigation of the Jui-
 chin urban area, they began the investigation by the households and farms.
 Some middle peasants were so alarmed that they came to the soviet and asked
 to have their classification changed into poor peasants.  They said:   "It is
 very dangerous to be a middle peasant, because it is only one step removed
 from the rich peasant.  A poor peasant will be further removed from the rich
 peasant."  Do such painful appeals not deserve our attention?  The comrades
 of Yang-ku township, Huang-po District, announced to the masses:   "Class
 investigation is only the investigation of the middle peasants, rich
 peasants, and landlords."  The comrades of T'ao-ching District put down
 stakes and forced the investigation, and some of the middle peasants were
 so terrified that they fled into the mountains to hide.   Some townships in
 Po-sheng county also put down stakes and made a general investigation, and
 the middle peasants there were similarly terrified.   It was stated at the
 eight-county mass meeting that "the idea that land investigation requires
 staking is not correct,"  Nevertheless, the comrades paid no attention.
 General investigation by staking happened in every county.   It was an
 unusually serious situation.   They confused land investigation and land
 division.   True, land division would require staking, but the land figures
 must first be clarified before division.   If the method of staking was used
 in the land investigation movement, it would confuse the rural struggle goal.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 We pointed out in the past;   "Land investigation and land division must be
 strictly distinguished.  Such distinction is not only for the purpose of
 stabilizing the peasants' land ownership so that they will not be alarmed
 over the uncertainty of land division, but also for the victory of the class
 investigation struggle.  We must concentrate our forces, especially by
 allying with the middle peasants, to handle the resistance of the landlords
 and rich peasants.  At this time, there must not be any confusion or dis-
 turbance within the peasants' own ranks" (conclusion of the eight-county
 mass meeting).  It was one of our most important strategies in guiding the
 land investigation struggle; yet it was neglected by many comrades.   Such
 neglect cannot be tolerated for another moment.   In regard to those who,
 after being given guidance, continue with such mistakes, the local higher
 level soviet must punish them severely.   Ideological struggles must be
 launched inside the Party and the league, and any Party or league member,
 in his thinking or action, encroaching upon the interest of the middle
 peasants and violating the strategy of allying with them, must be opposed.
 In regard to the mistakes already made, the soviet personnel must openly
 admit their mistakes to the local middle peasant masses and return the land
 and property to the wronged parties.  Last year, Hsing-kuo returned land to
 many middle peasants and won the satisfaction of the middle peasant masses.
 It was a valuable lesson.
 V.  The Closed-door-ism of the Poor Peasants' League and the Neglect of
 the Leadership Effect of the Farm Laborers Are Wrong.
 "The poor peasant masses are the props of the Party, the proletariat in the
 rural village, and the staunch supporters of the land revolution."  "Relying
 on the poor peasants" is one of our important strategies in the land
 investigation movement and all land struggles, and the poor peasants'
 league is an organization with a great effect in the land investigation
 movement.   The eight-county poor peasants' league delegates mass meeting
 already pointed out that the closed-door tendency of the poor peasants'
 league was wrong, that the sponsor system must be abolished and the gates
 opened wide to the poor peasant workers, and that all poor peasant workers,
 men and women, old and young, could join.   But many places still followed
 the old method without change and still required sponsoring.   In T'ao-ching
 District, Jui-chin, when the poor peasant masses not belonging to the league
 came to its meeting, the responsible persons refused them. admittance.  In
 Chu-chaff-chi District, Po-sheng, not one new member was admitted to the
 poor peasants' league in the entire month of July.   In all the districts
 and townships where land investigation was successful, the poor peasants'
 league developed extensively, while in all the districts and townships with
 little or no success, the one manifestation was the  closed-door situation
 of the poor peasants' league.   Similarly, many comrades failed to recognize
 the great leadership effect of the farm laborers in the land investigation
 movement.   The party resolution stated:   "The farm laborer masses are the
 rural brothers of the urban proletariat and the vanguard of the land
 revolution; therefore; the work personnel of the soviets must establish a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 close connection with the labor union, develop and organize the positivity
 of the worker masses through it, and turn them into the vanguard of the
 land investigation movement."  Not many of our comrades followed this
 instruction.  Here, the main means is to make the rural workers join the
 poor peasants' league and form separate workers' cells within it.  Through
 such workers' cells, the positive elements among the poor peasants are
 rallied to develop the poor peasants' league and promote the progress of
 the land investigation movement.   The experiences of Shan-ho township,
 Huang-po District, are valuable.   When our comrades failed twice to call a
 poor peasants' league meeting, they held a joint mass meeting of the
 agricultural and handicraft labor unions and activated several dozen workers.
 Each worker brought a poor peasant to the poor peasants' league.  The next
 day, a poor peasants' league meeting was held and the land investigation
 movement was launched in Shan-ho township.   This experience must be
 introduced in all the rural villages.  The higher level leading organ of the
 labor union must render positive guidance to the lower level labor union
 and consider land investigation one of the important tasks of the labor
 union.
 VI.   Incorrect Concepts of the Rich Peasant Issue.
 Our general strategy in the rural struggle is to rely on the poor peasants,
 firmly ally with the middle peasants, make the farm laborers produce a
 vanguard effect, and rally all revolutionary forces, in order to eliminate
 the landlord class and resist the rich peasants.   On the rich peasant issue,
 the party has stated correctly:   "The landlords and rich peasants must be
 clearly distinguished.  In the struggle to eliminate ruthlessly the landlord
 remnants, there must not be any attempt to eliminate the rich peasants."
 In the land investigation in July, though there was no theory openly advocating
 the elimination of the rich peasants, instances of considering them as
 landlords and confiscating all their assets were discovered in many areas.
 The source of the error was a result of obliterating the labor force of the
 rich peasants.   When we said that "those who perform no labor, or only
 incidental labor, but practice exploitation, such as collecting land rent,
 are landlords," some areas considered those who used considerable number
 of labor elements as "performing only incidental labor" and classified them
 as landlords.   Other areas considered the rich peasants who also exploited
 by high interest loans as "usurers" and handled them according to the
 method of "eliminating usurers."  There were also areas which reckoned old
 accounts, going back a certain number of years before the revolution.   If
 a person hired permanent help 5 or 6 years, or even 10 or more years, before
 the revolution, he was considered a rich peasant.  Or, the well-to-do middle
 peasants who once hired permanent help for 1 or 2 years but had not done
 so since then were classified as rich peasants.  The even more serious
 instances occurred in a certain area in Hsing-kuo.   They distinguished the
 landlords and rich peasants by the number of exploitations.  Those guilty
 of three kinds of exploitations were called landlords, and those guilty of
 two kinds, rich peasants.   For instance, if a peasant hired permanent help,
 collected rent, and lent out money, he was considered a landlord regardless

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 of the number of family members who labored.   Then, the problem of
 "reactionary rich peasants" was very confused in many areas.   One rich
 peasant in Wu-yang District who was also a merchant had 17 mouths to feed
 In the fam!l.y.   Because One member of his family joined the AB League 2
 years ago and was killed, the comrades there insisted on confiscating his
 entire family assets.   Similar instances were many in other areas.   In
 regard to the rich peasants who were not guilty of very serious counter-
 revolutionary conduct before the uprising, such as "collecting 30 percent
 grain as rent" (Jui-chin), and who did not perform any counterrevolutionary
 activity in the several years since the uprising, the majority of the masses
 did not want to  punish them; yet some of our comrades insisted on
 confiscating their assets.   Actually, in regard to this kind of people we
 must use different strategies for consolidated areas and uncosolidated
 outlying areas.  In the outlying areas, doubtlessly we must adopt a strict
 method and suppress all counterrevolutionary elements, including the rich
 peasants.  In central areas, we must decide according to the situation.  In
 regard to those who indulged in serious conterrevolutionary conduct before
 the uprising, or who continued in their counterrevolutionary activities after
 the uprising, naturally we must confiscate their assets, but otherwise we.
 must not do so.   For some households, we should confiscate only the assets
 belonging to the  guilty party himself and those directly connected with his
 counterrevolutionary conduct, and leave the assets of the rest of the family
 intact.  This is the only way to handle it correctly.
 VII.   The Worker-Peasant Procurators' Department Failed To Discharge
 Its Duties and Made Mistakes.
 Many of our comrades in the worker-peasant procurators' department did not
 realize that the land investigation movement was the best opportunity to
 launch the ideological struggle, resist bureaucraticism, oppose corruption,
 decadence, and negative slowdown, and expel the class deviationists from
 the soviet, and they were very inadequate in performing such work.  Many of
 them, in face of the violent class struggle, manifested their negative
 vacillation, bureaucraticism, and formalism.  The chief of the Jui-chin
 city soviet worker-peasant procurators' section sheltered the chief of the
 city soviet judicial section who was guilty of grave corruption (appropri-
 ating over 1,000 yuan of public funds).   The chief of Tu-t'ou District
 worker-peasant procurators' section failed to criticize or prosecute the
 district soviet chairman who neglected land investigation.   In some areas,
 the worker-peasant procurators' department followed another erroneous
 directions in its prosecution movement. They considered love as decadence
 and taking things belonging to the landlords as corruption and prosecuted,
 or even tried in public, the culprits.   Some areas dismissed those making
 minor mistakes from their posts.  Instead of systematically launching
 self-criticism and ideological struggle, which involved strenuous work,
 they resorted to punishment in their place.  Needless to say, those among
 the soviet work personnel committing long-term and serious errors must be
 firmly purged, but dismissing and punishing those making lesser errors were
 excessive.   In regard to the class deviationists, generally only the classi-
 fication was taken into consideration, not the work.   As long as their
 background was bad, regardless of their long struggle history, or their

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 correct implementation of the Party and soviet lines and policies in the
 past or at present, they were considered class deviationists and dismissed.
 True, we.must firmly purge the class deviationists.  Those with undesirable
 classifications and inferior work performances (including landlords, rich
 peasants, negative slowdown, corruption, etc.) must doubtlessly be purged,
 but it would be excessive to handle the lesser ones likewise.
 VIII.  The Leadership Technique of the Land Investigation Struggle.
 If we understand the task and the line, but do not have the Bolshevik
 technique of leading the mass struggle, the land investigation movement
 still cannot develop.  At the beginning of this article we discussed the
 many good examples of leading the struggle in Jen-t'ien District and other
 areas, but in many other areas, numerous mistakes were made on this point.
 In some areas, they did not know how to employ all kinds of means to
 activate the struggle in the backward big villages where the landlords and
 rich peasants corgregated.  In some bi_g villages, only by first arresting
 the evil gentry and landlord elements, known to the masses as "big tigers,"
 before the struggle could be launched, but our comrades failed to do so.
 In regard to distributing the confiscated goods to activate a mass struggle,
 which is an excellent method, many areas did not resort to it.   In Wa-tzu
 township, T'ao-ching District, Jui-chin, the confiscated things were only
 distributed to the land investigation cadres and poor peasants' league
 members, not to anyone else, on ground that those who were not positive
 were not entitled.  Some areas were very slow in distributing the confiscated
 .things, holding them for as long as a month or more.   The distribution of
 confiscated land was even slower.  The comrades of many areas did not know
 that they must produce a nucleus leadership effect in the mass organizations
 and villages by mobilizing the departments of the soviet, the mass organi-
 zations, and the Party and league members.  When the work could not be
 started, they would say that there was nothing one could do in this area
 anyway.   In some areas, after the class investigation mass struggle had been
 started and many people came to report on the landlords and rich peasants
 and request investigation and confiscation, our comrades were unable to
 utilize the mass fervor, lead the struggle, and spread the class investigation
 work to the various villages.   In some areas, after some investigation, the
 struggle fervor of the masses could not continue to rise and a situation of
 stagnation appeared.   Our comrades were unable to stimulate the masses by
 all kinds of means in order to raise their enthusiasm until all feudal
 remnants were eliminated.   In other areas, after the land investigation
 movement, when the struggle fervor of the masses flourished, our comrades
 .were unable to organize and shift the fervor to another front.   For instance,
 after the people received things or land, they should have, at the mass
 meetings or other favorable occasions, encouraged them to enlist in the
 Red Army, sell bonds, join the cooperative, devote their effort to fall
 harvesting and fall plowing, establish clubs and literacy classes, or
 develop night and elementary schools.   They missed the best opportunities.
 When the higher level ordered such work to be done, they would then begin
 to propagandize and encourage.   Such tailism leadership, dropping behind
 the struggle fervor of the masses, is most detrimental to revolutionary
 work.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 In another aspect, there was, in many areas, the undesirable situation of a
 few persons working with brute force.  We once stressed that we must oppose
 the indifference of the majority of the masses and the commandist work
 pattern, and that only by patient and arduous work to activate the masses
 and win them before we could get the support of the majority and attain the
 goal of eliminating the feudal remnants.  Such mass work is the only
 safeguard to implementing the  class line.  At the beginning of the land
 investigation movement, we  must propagandize extensively in all the
 villages, explaining to the masses that the land investigation movement was
 necessary, that land investigation was not land division, and that class
 investigation was not an investigation of the middle peasant, poor peasant,
 and farm laborer classes, and clarifying to them especially the distinctions
 among the landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants.  Village mass
 meetings must be held more than once, especially in the backward villages.
 Our propaganda must reach everyone of the revolutionary masses.   To attain
 this goal, we must first explain clearly at the township soviet delegates
 meetings, labor unions, poor peasants' leagues, women laborers' and farm
 women delegates' meetings, and other mass organizations, and to all.the
 positive elements, and propagandize through them to the masses.   Class
 investigation must not be performed by only a few individuals, but by the
 majority.   In regard to class classification, it must be passed not only
 at the poor peasants' league, the township soviet, and the district soviet,
 but also at the mass meetings of the village and hamlet of the party whose
 assets are to be confiscated, and the confiscation can only be carried out
 with the approval of the masses.  When distributing things to the masses
 of the particular village and hamlet, it must be to the satisfaction of such
 masses.   All these measures are for the purpose of winning the majority of
 the masses.  The work personnel of the Party and the soviet must never
 forget the majority of the masses in any task at any time.  We must turn
 toward the masses, which means the majority of the masses.. Our work must
 penetrate the masses, which means penetrating the masses of the large and
 small villages, large and small towns.  We must severely oppose the erroneous
 means of closed-door-ism and commandism with only a few individuals
 performing the work.  Yet, our comrades in many areas did not do so.   In
 many districts and townships in Jui-chin, they never even once discussed
 the classes (never analyzed the distinctions among landlords, rich pea-
 sants, and middle peasants) to the masses.   In many areas in Jui-chin
 and other counties, they started investigating without propaganda.  As a
 result, the landlords and rich peasants created rumors and deceived the
 middle peasants.  They claimed that there were many landowners and rich
 peasants in the township or that several hundred landlords and rich
 peasants were to be investigated (Jui-chin); yet our comrades failed to
 use the means of "discussing classes" to break down the rumor.  A landlord
 in Kuang--ch'ang said:   "The land investigation movement means that the
 Central Government wants the debtors to repay their debts to the Central;"
 yet our comrades did not immediately expose such falsehood.  In several
 townships in T'ao-thing District, besides not propagandizing, class
 investigation was performed only by the several members of the land investi-
 gation committee, and                       class classification did not go through the mass

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 meetings, nor the poor peasants' league.  They said:  "The masses are not
 reliable. They don't know how to analyze the classes.   To pass the class
 classifications at the mass meeting will lead to disputes.  It is more
 reliable for the land investigation committee to handle it."  This theory
 is truly amazing!  In several areas, confiscation of the property of
 landlords was done at night, not during day time, on the sole ground that
 the landlord might run away.   In one area, for the mass meeting, they used
 the method of "mass meeting of the entire district."  Less than 200 people
 showed up.  Three men lectured in turns from morning to afternoon, not
 permitting the masses to rest or eat, on the grounds that they might run
 away.  This barbarous method can be considered another amazing thing!
 IX.    Launch the Struggle between the Two Lines, Overcome One's Own Errors,
 and Strive for the Complete Success of the Land Investigation Movement.
 Doubtlessly, land investigation has been launched extensively.  Nevertheless,
 when the movement is progressing, and when we have made a correct assessment
 of the achievements and laid a foundation for its development, we must be
 alert and give attention to the obstacles in the movement.  Only by launching
 the struggle between the two lines to eliminate such obstacles will we
 promote the faster progress of the movement.  Launching anti-rightwing
 ideological struggles and opposing under-estimation of the serious signifi-
 cance of the movement, compromise with and capitulation to the landlords and
 rich peasants, and the tailist leadership of the mass struggle are the
 responsibilities of each and every communist party member.  Meanwhile, all
 the Party members must be alerted to the danger of encroaching upon the
 middle peasants; we must "severely hit any attempt to encroach upon the
 interest of the middle peasants," because this is an extremely serious
 danger which has clearly manifested itself in the current land investigation
 work.  The incorrect concepts concerning the rich peasants will also doubt-
 lessly affect the middle peasants.  All the commadist ways of brute force
 are most harmful to the alliance with the middle peasants.   By sweeping aside
 all obstacles on the road of the land investigation movement with the
 firepower of the struggle between the two lines, the movement will advance
 in big strides, and its complete success will be fully guaranteed.

 SMASHING THE FIFTH 1ENCIRCLEMENT AND SUPPRESSION' AND FULFILL SOVIET
 ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION TASKS
 Report at the Economic Construction Rally of the 17 Southern Counties,
 12 August 1933
 [Text]  Comrades:  This time we are holding two economic construction
 rallies--the 17 southern counties and the 11 northern counties.  We have
 never before held a rally for economic construction.  Today is the first
 time.  The current situation is:  The fourth enemy "encirclement and
 suppression" has been completely smashed by us, and the fifth "encirclement"
 is imminent.  The great storm of world revolution and war is pressing in on
 us.  The imperialist world war and the war against the Soviet Union are under
 insane preparation.  Imperialism recklessly oppresses China.  Having
 occupied four and a half of China's provinces, Japan is extending its bandit
 war toward Inner Mongolia. After the total failure of the fourth "encircle-
 ment and suppression," the Kuomintang is in the process of preparing a
 fifth one.  The revolutionary struggles and revolutionary war of the whole
 of China are developing forcefully under a new situation.   That we hold an
 economic construction rally at this time indicates what we wish to discuss
 and the purpose of our economic construction.   This is the point which I
 wish to explain in my report today.  This report is divided into two parts.
 I.   Smashing of the Fourth "Encirclement and Suppression" and the New Fifth
 "Encirclement and Suppression"
 1.   I will first discuss the victories won by us in smashing the fourth
 "encirclement and suppression."
 We wish to say that:
 First, it was a large destruction of enemy troops.
 The fourth "encirclement and suppression" was completely smashed.  The Red
 Army in the central area, Hupeh-Honan-Anhwei, Szechwan, Hunan-west Hupeh,
 Hunan-Kiangsi, Hunan-Hupeh-Kiangsi, and Fukien-Chekiang-Kiangsi soviet
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 areas wiped out a total of over 15 divisions of enemy troops in the past
 year, a greater victory than the smashing of the enemy's third "encirclement
 and suppression."  The armed forces of the enemy suffered a most severe
 setback. All the middle and lower echelon officers of the enemy army are
 in mortal fear of the Red Army and are afraid to fight it.  Meanwhile, the
 vacillation of the soldiers of the White army and their sympathy for the
 revolution continue to grow.
 Second, it is the strengthening and expansion of the Red Army.
 The Red Army has become an invincible ironclad force.  The change in its
 organization, the improvement in its military technique, and the  stability
 in its politics have all made great progresses.  In regard to its expansion,.
 it has doubled from the past.  We have built a  large-scale combat army.
 Third, it is the consolidation of the soviet areas.
 During the fourth "encirclement and suppression" the class awareness of the
 worker-peasant masses and their fervor in supporting the revolutionary war
 were raised even higher.   The intensification of the land investigation
 movement and the development of the workers' struggles have constituted
 serious blows on the remnant feudal forces in the soviet areas.  The culture
 and education mass movement has made a further development.  A new situation
 has unfolded in the economic construction movement.   The work of the soviet
 has improved even more and its prestige in the masses has risen even higher.
 The soviet banner is reflected in the minds and eyes of the toiling masses
 in the entire nation.
 The fourth is the expansion of soviet territory.
 This includes the establishment of the central area and the provinces of
 Fukien and Kiangsi, and the opening of several hundred li of new soviet
 areas in Szechwan.  Comrade Ho Lung [6320 7893] of Hunan-Hupeh-Szechwan
 has developed a large soviet area there.
 The fifth is the great development of the revolutionary movement in areas
 controlled by the Kuomintang.
 As Japanese imperialism forcefully occupied four and one-half provinces
 belonging to China and the Kuomintang surrendered to capitalism and formed
 a traitorous agreement with Japan, the movement of the broad masses against
 imperialism and the Kuomintang has spread on a  large scale.  As a result
 of the oppression and massacre practiced by the Kuomintang, the bankruptcy
 of agriculture, industry, and commerce, and the aggravated cruel exploitation
 of workers and peasants by the capitalists and landlords, the strikes of the
 workers, the struggles of the peasants, and the resistance of the calamity
 stricken masses against taxes and levies, and the rural riots and guerrilla
 warfare have greatly expanded.

 2.  Comrades, we have won great victories, but how were such victories won?
 I feel that you all know that they were won because of (1) the courage and
 skill of the Red Army, (2) the revolutionary positivity of the broad worker-
 peasant masses in the soviet and White areas, and (3) the leadership of the
 communist party's correct line.  Only with these three important factors did
 we smash the enemy's fourth "encirclement and suppression" and win the great
 victories discussed above.  These victories constituted a tremendous blow
 to the imperialist Kuomintang.  On the one hand, the revolutionary strengths
 have increased even more, advancing powerfully like an iron torrent.  On
 the other hand, the counterrevolutionary strengths have weakened more than
 ever before.  Feeling the pressure of imminent destruction, the enemies have
 no choice but to prepare an attack of an even larger scale than before,
 attempting to salvage their dying control.
 3.   Therefore, the enemies are insanely planning their fifth "encirclment
 and suppression"
 To arrange for the "encirclement and suppression" this time, the Kuomintang
 has to submit even further to imperialism.  After selling out Manchuria,
 Jehol, and North China, Chiang Kai-shek entered into secret treaties contain-
 ing many traitorous provisions with the imperialist countries of America,
 England, France, Italy and Germany, and borrowed large quantities of money
 and arms.  Moving the troops, training the  recruits, and approaching the
 factional warlords (but the conflicts and wars among the warlords are
 inevitable), he is actively preparing the fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 of the soviet and the Red Army.
 II.   Smashing of the Fifth "Encirclement and Suppression" and the Soviet
 Economic Construction Tasks
 1.  Seize all favorable factors to smash the enemies' fifth "encirclement
 and suppression"
 China's revolution is now at a critical point.  In other words, will
 imperialism destroy China?  Or will the revolutionary war destroy the
 Kuomintang, expel imperialism, and turn the nation into a soviet China?
 The imperialist Kuomintang selected the path of destroying China.  They
 have already adopted the method of a fifth "encirclement and suppression."
 They wish to divide China up like a melon or place it under joint control
 by means of the fifth "encirclement and suppression," turning China's
 millions into slaves of imperialism, into Indians and Koreans, and China
 itself into an imperialist colony.   This is a great danger.   It hangs over
 our head and threatens us.   Comrades, can we permit them to do so?  No, we
 must fight for the way out through revolution.   Our way out is to subjugate
 the imperialist Kuomintang, sever China trom its control, and make it into
 a new free and independent worker-peasant-soldier soviet republic.   The
 critical point is to thoroughly smash their fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 and strive for victory.  We must still rely on the Red Army, on the masses,
 and on the firm implementation of the communist party's line of attack.

 Nevertheless, we must concentrate our effort to seize all factors even more
 favorable than ever before in order to smash the fifth "encirclement and
 suppression" and win even greater victories.
 To gain victory this time, we must perform much work.  We must vigorously
 expand the Red Army and train 200,000 new soldiers for the front line in
 6 to 10 months in the central and the several soviet areas nearby, so that
 the Red Army groups on all fronts are even stronger and able to perform the
 task of hitting Chiang Kai-shek's several hundred thousand White troops.
 We must launch an extensive and intensive land investigation movement and
 vigorously develop the rural class struggle, in order to thoroughly solve
 the land issue, eliminate the remnant feudal forces, and increase the eager-
 ness and joy of the broad peasant masses in joining the revolutionary war.
 We must generally introduce the labor law, expand the struggles of the
 w     workers, and further raise the positivity of the worker masses toward the
 revolutionary war.  We must, through the election movement this year, reelect
 the soviet of all levels, from the township to the  central, so that the
 entire soviet political power will be strong like iron and able to shoulder
 the great mission of organizing and directing the revolutionary more
 successfully.  We must give attention to the work on the frontier and in
 the newly developed areas and make the revolutionary war progress rapidly
 toward the pivotal cities.  We must launch mass cultural movements and
 improve the cultural and political levels of the masses, so that the revo-
 lutionary war will gain an effective spiritual tool.  Besides the foregoing,
 there is yet another extremely important task which we wish to stress in
 our present discussions--the work in the economic construction aspect.  We
 must vigorously launch the economic construction movement and consider
 economic construction one of the most fundamental factors to smash the fifth
 "encirclement and suppression"--an indispensable material factor in the
 revolutionary war.   The holding of the economic construction rally this time
 is for this purpose.
 2.   The great economic construction tasks are spread before us!
 The intensive development of the revolutionary war makes it necessary for
 the soviet to mobilize the masses, immediately launch a movement on the
 economic front, and proceed with the required economic construction tasks.
 Why?  For winning the victory of the revolutionary war, for acquiring the
 material factors to guarantee the supplies of  the Red Army, for improving
 the life of the masses in order to stimulate even higher their positivity
 in joining the revolutionary war, for organizing the broad masses on the
 economic front and educating them in order to gain new mass strengths for
 the war,'for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance by means of economic
 construction, stabilizing the soviet political power under the worker-
 peasant dictatorship, reenforcing the proletarial leadership, and striving
 for the thorough victory of the entire revolutionary war, primarily the
 smashing of the fifth "encirclement and suppression," the economic
 construction work has to be undertaken.   Each and every soviet work
 personnel must immediately realize this point.   In the past, some comrades
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 felt that, as the revolutionary war alone had kept them busy, how would they
 have the spare time to perform economic construction work?  Anyone discussing
 economic construction was condemened as rightwing.  Moreover, they also felt
 that it was impossible to undertake economic construction in the environment
 of the revolutionary war, that it must be postponed until the final victory
 of the war, that it could only be promoted in an evironment of peace and
 tranquillity, and  that it was out of the question at the present time.
 Comrades, are such opinions correct?  No.  Those comrades making such
 statements failed to realize that if economic construction is not undertaken,
 there will be no complete assurance of the material factors of the war and
 we will be weary in a long-term war.  The enemies are enforcing an economic
 blockade, and the unconscionable reactionary merchants are sabotaging our
 currency and commerce.  If we do not overcome such difficulties, will the
 revolutionary war not suffer a great damage?  The blockade by the enemies
 and the manipulations by the  unconscionable merchants have greatly hindered
 our trade with the outside.  The cost of salt is very high, and sometimes
 not even available.  Grain is cheap in the fall, but soars in the spring
 and summer.   Such conditions produce an immediate impact on the life of the
 workers and peasants and block the further improvement of their living
 standards.  Will this situation not affect the basic line of the worker-
 peasant alliance?  If the workers and peasants are dissatisfied with their
 life, will it not affect our effort to expand the Red Army and mobilize the
 masses to join the revolutionary war?  Therefore, the idea that the soviet
 economic construction should not be undertaken in a revolutionary environment
 is extremely fallacious.  Those holding this view often express their desire
 to subordinate everything to the war, not realizing that blotting out
 economic construction actually weakens and affects the war, not subordinating
 it to the war.   Precisely for the purpose of subordinating economic
 construction to the war, we must undertake all kinds of necessary economic
 construction work, because it is an extremely necessary and indispensable
 factor of the revolutionary war.   Only when the work on the economic front
 is launched and the economy of the soviet areas developed will the
 revolutionary war acquire an appropriate material foundation, making it
 possible for us to launch more successful military attacks and deal effective
 blows on the enemy "encirclement and suppression."  Only then will we have
 the strength to expand 1 million Red troops and extend our front several
 thousand li away.   Only then will the iron troops of our Red Army be able
 to hit Nan-ch'ang and Chiu-chiang without a backward glance.  Only then
 will our Red Army soldiers be relieved of the chore of foraging for their
 own provisons and concentrate on fighting the enemies.   Only then will our
 broad masses be appropriately satisfied with their living and become more
 eager to serve in the Red Army and perform all kinds of revolutionary work.
 Only by so doing can it be called subordination to the war; otherwise, it
 will not be subordination to the war, but the absence of the one determining
 factor of the war.   This opportunist vievpoint is completely wrong.  Among
 the soviet work personnel in all areas, many still do not understand the
 importance of economic construction in the revolutionary war.   They have not
 truly placed the economic construction tasks on their shoulders.  Therefore,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 they have not devoted all their energy to implement the appeal of the Central
 Government or exerted a hundred-fold effort to develop the movement on the
 economic front.  Take the following instances:  Many government presidiums
 do not stress the discussion of economic construction.  The organization of
 the national economy department is still not sound.  Some of them have  not
 even found a department chief, or they assign the unqualified to perform
 the work of the national economy department.  The development of the cooper-
 ative is still in the initial stage.  The work of balancing grain supplies
 is only performed in a part of the areas.  The various areas have not
 propagandized the task of economic construction to the broad masses.   This
 is extremely important.   The fervor to struggle for economic construction
 has not been created in the masses. All such conditions are the result of
 failing to recognize the importance of economic construction.  At our rally
 this time, we  must first severely oppose the erroneous viewpoints; we must
 eliminate the erroneous opportunist viewpoint of overlooking economic
 construction.  Through discussion of the comrades at the rally and their
 transmission to the people when they return to their homes, we want to
 create a fervor among the entire soviet work personnel and the broad worker-
 peasant masses, and clarify to them the position of economic construction
 in the revolutionary war, so that they will devote their unanimous effort
 to selling 3 to 6 million yuan of economic construction bonds.  We want to
 develop the cooperative movement and recruit 1 million people to join the
 cooperatives, half for the  consumer cooperatives and the other half for
 the grain cooperatives.  We want to build granaries generally and establish
 famine preparation storehouses.   Every county seat must organize a grain
 balancing branch bureau, and crucial areas and markets must organize grain
 balancing sub-bureaus, so that, on the one hand, the shortages and surpluses
 in the soviet areas are balanced and the prices made more uniform and, on
 the other hand, the surplus grain of soviet areas is shipped out according
 to plans (not unrestricted) and sold at a high price, without the intermediate
 exploitation of the unconscionable merchants.  With the cash acquired from
 the White areas, we can purchase the necessities.  We want to vigorously
 develop agricultural and handicraft production, so that the harvest next year
 will be even greater and such special products as tungsten, lumber, camphor,
 paper, tobacco, summer cloth, mushrooms, and peppermint oil will resume their
 past output and be shipped out to the White areas in volume.  Tungsten, for
 instance, is an industry with a good future, because it is needed by the
 military industry of imperialism.  The export of tungsten has great prospects.
 We must have several thousand or tens of thousands of people to mine tungsten.
 For the development of agricultural production, the manufacture of farm
 tools and lime is extremely necessary.   In regard to the volumes of import
 and export trade, the largest export from the soviet areas is grain.   The
 central soviet area exports approximately 3 million tan of grain a year.
 With our 3 million people, the export of 1 tan of grain per capita to exchange
 for necessities is about the minimum.   Who is handling the transactions?
 They are exclusively handled by the merchants.   The merchants indulge in
 extremely cruel exploitations.   Last year, the peasants of Wan-t'ai sold
 the grain to the merchants at 0.50 yuan per tan, and the latter sold it
 in Kan-chou at 4.00 yuan, an 8-fold profit.   Take another instance:
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Our 3 million people consume almost 9 million yuan of salt and 6 million
 yuan of fabric per year.   Needless to say, the import of the 15 million
 yuan's worth of salt and fabric, so far, has been monopolized by the
 merchants, and our soviet has never interfered.  The merchants' exploitation
 is unbelievable.   They buy salt in Chia-ying-chou, for instance, at
 7 catties per yuan, bring it into the soviet area and sell at 12 ounces
 per yuan.  Isn't such exploitation alarming?  The soviet can no longer
 remain on the sideline.  We must take action from now on.  Our foreign trade
 bureau must devote a great effort in this aspect.  How do we plan to spend
 the proceeds of the 3 million economic construction bonds? We plan to use
 the money in the following way:  1 million to be allocated to the Red Army
 for its war expenditures; 2 million to be loaned to the cooperatives, grain
 balancing bureaus, and foreign trade bureaus as their capital.  A small part
 will be used to develop production and a large part to develop import and
 export trade.  In addition to developing production, our goal is to sell
 our export high while buying salt and fabric low from the White areas for
 distribution to the masses of the soviet areas.  We will thus break down
 the enemy blockade, resist exploitation by the merchants, develop the
 economy of the soviet areas daily, greatly improve the life of the masses,
 greatly increase the revenue of the soviet, and solidly build the material
 foundation of the revolutionary war.  However, we inquire whether such
 economic construction work can be performed in a violent environment of
 war?  I think only the opportunists will say that it is impossible.  We are
 not saying that we want to build a railway to Lung-yen, or a highway to
 Kan-chou; we are not saying that grain export or the 15 million yuan salt
 and fabric import will be exclusively handled by the government.  We do not
 say so, nor do we do so.  What we say and do is that we will temporarily
 use the 2 million capital, plus stocks of the people, to develop
 .agricultural and handicraft production, export grain and tungsten, and
 import salt and fabric.   Are these things which should not, or cannot, be
 done?  We have already begun to do the  ork and made some achievement.  The
 fall harvest this year shows an increase of 20 to 25 percent over last year,
 surpassing our estimate of a 20 percent increase.  In handicraft industry,
 the production of farm tools and lime is in the process of recovery.  The
 production of tungsten has begun to recover.  The production of tobacco, paper,
 and lumber is showing some life.  Much achievement has been made in grain
 balancing.   Some work has been done on the import of salt.   Such initial
 achievements constitute the foundation of our belief in the future.  The
 opportunists say that economic construction can only be undertaken after
 the conclusion of the war and that it is impossible now.   Are they not
 apparently wrong?
 Therefore, it is clear that, at the present stage, economic construction
 revolves around the central task of the revolutionary war.   The revo-
 lutionary war is the current central task, and economic construction is
 for its purpose, revolves around it, is subservient to it, and not a
 center in itself.   The idea that economic construction is the central
 task among all current tasks is likewise an opportunist viewpoint.   The
 revolutionary war requires that the soviet undertake the necessary economic
 construction.  To pursue economic construction apart from the revolutionary

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 war is erroneous.  Only after the conclusion of the domestic war can, and
 should, economic construction be  considered the center of all tasks.  To do
 economic construction work which should be undertaken in peacetime in the
 future and not at present, and which is feasible in a future environment
 and infeasible under the present environment during the domestic war, is
 blind thinking.  The work today consists of items urgently needed by the
 war, and each item is for the war, not a peacetime undertaking apart from
 the war.  Any comrade entertaining such an erroneous view must be
 immediately corrected.
 3.   The issue of the leadership pattern in economic construction.
 Without a correct leadership style and work method, it will be impossible
 to launch rapidly the movement on the economic front.  This is also an
 important problem and must be solved at this rally, because the comrades,
 upon returning to their homes, must immediately take action and direct the
 many personnel of the provincial, county, and area soviets to work together,
 especially the comrades of the basic level and town soviets, and the cooper-
 atives, grain bureaus, trade bureaus, and purchasing offices.  They are in
 charge of the practical work, and they must personally mobilize the masses
 to organize cooperatives, balance and transport grain, and manage the
 import and export trade.   If their leadership pattern is incorrect, and if
 they cannot adopt all kinds of correct and effective methods in their work,
 it will immediately affect the result of the work and make it impossible for
 us to gain the support of the broad masses of our slogans and tasks and to
 complete the entire economic construction plan of the Central Government
 in the fall and winter of this year and the spring and summer of next year.
 Therefore, I wish to clarify the following points to the comrades:
 The first is to mobilize the masses organizationally.  Here, the presidiums
 of all levels of. the government and the comrades of the national economy
 and.finance departments must place the issuance of bonds, development of
 cooperatives, balancing of grain, promotion of production, and expansion of
 trade on the daily agenda for discussion, solution, supervision, and inspec-
 tion.   Next, mass organizations must be activated, mainly labor unions and
 poor peasants' leagues.   The labor union must be made to mobilize its
 membership masses to join the economic front.   The poor peasants' league
 is an effective organization for mobilizing the masses to develop
 cooperatives and buy bonds.   The distinct and township soviets must
 vigorously render them guidance.  Next, propaganda of economic construction
 must be done through mass meetings with the villages or hamlets as the
 units.   In the propaganda, the relationship between the revolutionary war
 and economic construction must be made very clear, and improving the
 people's life and increasing the struggle strength explained in a very
 practical manner.  Appeals must be made to the masses to buy 3 million yuan
 of bonds, develop cooperatives of 1 million people, balance the grain supply,
 stabilize the money market, and promote trade.   They must be urged to
 struggle for these slogans, and their fervor must be raised.  If we do not
 thus organizationally mobilize and propagandize to the masses, i.e., if the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 presidiums and the national economy and finance departments do not devote
 their effort to the discussion and examination of economic construction work,
 give a tention to activating the mass organizations, and propagandize by
 means of mass meetings, it will be impossible to attain our goal..
 Second, the pattern of mobilizing the masses must not be bureaucratic.  The
 bureaucratic leadership pattern must not exist in any kind of revolutionary
 work, and this applies to economic construction.  The bureaucratic
 leadership pattern, a most undesirable thing, must be thrown onto the trash
 pile.  No comrade likes it.  What the comrades prefer should be the Bolshevik
 work pattern, i.e., the mass pattern--a pattern which leads to the closest
 association with the masses and is welcomed by the workers and peasants.
 The manifestations of bureaucraticism are as follows:  One is the indifferent
 or superficial opportunist negative slowdown, which is the worst phenomenon.
 We must wage a strict struggle against it.  Another is commandism.   On the
 surface, there is no slowdown, and there is a semblance of great effort in
 the work.   Actually, developing the cooperative by commandism will not
 succeed.  Temporarily there may be  a development in form, but it cannot
 be consolidated.   Confidence in the cooperative will be lost and its
 development blocked.  Selling bonds by commandirm is another instance.
 Regardless of whether the masses have understood or whether they can buy
 that much, bonds are sold arbitrarily according to the desired figures.  As
 a result, the masses are displeased, and the bonds cannot be sold successfully.
 We must never follow commandism.  We must propagandize vigorously and
 convince the masses by persuation. We must develop the cooperative, sell
 bonds, and perform all economic mobilization work according to the concrete
 circumstances and the concrete manifestations of the sentiment of the masses.
 Third, the economic construction movement requires large numbers of working
 cadres.   It is not an undertaking of tens or hundreds of people, but
 thousands and tens of thousands.  They must be organized, trained, and
 sent to the battlefield of economic construction.  They are the commanders
 on the economic front, while the broad masses are the soldiers.  The
 opportunist often laments the lack of cadres.  Comrades, is there really
 lack of cadres?  Innumerable cadres have emerged from the masses tempered
 in the land struggle, economic struggle, and revolutionary war involving
 millions in the soviet areas.  How can one say there is a lack of cadres?
 If the opportunist viewpoint is discarded, one will see the cadres standing
 in front of him.
 Finally, I wish to say that economic construction is not only inseparable
 from the general task of war, but also from other tasks.   Only by an
 intensive land investigation movement will the rural class struggle be
 further developed, the positivity of the peasants increased, and the broad
 peasants rapidly led to the battlefield of economic construction.   Only
 by firmly implementing the labor law will the life of the worker-peasant
 masses be improved, the worker masses rapidly recruited for economic
 construction enterprises, and their leadership effect on the peasants

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100020001-5
 strengthened.   Only by the correct guidance of the election movement and the
 prosecution movement, which is launched with the land investigation movement,
 will the soviet organs become even sounder and the soviet even more effective
 in guiding the revolutionary war, the work of all aspects, and economic work.
 Improving the political and cultural levels of the masses is also of extreme
 importance in developing the national economy.  There is no need for me to
 stress the fact that the work of expanding the Red Army cannot be ignored
 even for one day.  You all know that, without the victories of the Red Army,
 the economic blockade would  have been even more severe.  On the other hand,
 the development of the national economy and the improvement of the people's
 life will doubtlessly help expand the Red Army, so that the broad masses
 will march to the frontline in large groups.   In general, if we acquire all
 the factors discussed above, and if we also acquire the new and extremely
 important factor of economic construction, and  subordinate all the factors
 to war, then, the victory of the fifth "encirclement and suppression"
 campaign will doubtlessly be ours.   (Enthusiastic applause).
