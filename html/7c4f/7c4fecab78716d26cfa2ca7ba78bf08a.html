 FYO'T' tt,e desk Of
 Soliloquy for Supervisors *
 (With apologies to Hamlet and Shakespeare.)
 To train or not to train,
 That is no problem.  Surely 'tis wiser in a Chief
 To spot well in advance his training needs,
 And by a prudent plan fulfill them.
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
 Fall not by chance alone: they land the most
 Upon the heads of those who close their eyes
 And say, "We have no time to train-
 We have too much to dol" "Too much to do,"-
 Aye, there's the rub, for while the poor souls struggle hard
 To do their daily work, they fall behind,
 Their errors mount, their frantic efforts fail,
 And soon they are immersed up to their ears,
 Within n very ePn of wna.

 SPECIAL LECTURE SERIES:                                                10 OCTOBER TO
 IN THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD                                    1Ma 1957
 All CIA personnel interested in improving their language proficiency and
 area knowledge are invited to attend  a   series of foreign language lectures
 (see lecture Schedule below) presented Wednesdays at 3,5   hours, in room 1016.
 Recreation and Service Building.  Information regarding the series may be ob-
 25X1A9a              tained by calling                     extension 2381 or 3629.  You will, of course,
 obtain authorization from your supervisor prior to attendance at any one of the
 lectures.
 Recognizing the need for increased knowledge in the language and area
 fields, the Office of Training is offering this series of lectures to be
 given in the major languages of the world by CIA personnel. Topics of par-
 ticular interest, both to analysts and personnel in operations, have been
 selected.  The purpose is twofold:  To advance your knowledge of foreign
 languages; to increase your insight into the understanding of foreign
 peoples -  their patterns of thought and behavior.
 A special feature of the program is the amount of attention devoted to the
 theme "Understanding and Dealing With Foreign Peoples."  Individual lecturers
 will speak on how to understand and deal with the Russians, the Japanese, the
 Latin Americana, etc.  In this way, much of the "know-how" gained by our per-
 sonnel through years of experience will be transmitted to you.  As a result, it
 is hoped that in your contacts with the different nationalities, both here and
 abroad, you will be able to establish more effective rapport and attain better
 results.
 Summaries of the lectures, in English, will be provided in the "Understand-
 ing and Dealing With Foreign People" talks, and also in a few other instances.
 The lecture in Arabic, due to the very limited number of Agency personnel able
 to understand this language, will be given in English with a brief summary fol-
 lowing in Arabic.

 SELECTION Or AGENCY CANDIDATES TO ATTEND
 SENIOR DEFENSE COLLEGES AND OTHER QUOTA SCHOOLS
 (By Chief, Plans and Policy Staff,
 Office of Training, Extension 3531)
 The CIA Career Council has recently modified the procedures for the
 selection of Agency representatives to attend the senior colleges and
 schools of the Department of Defense and the Advanced Management Course
 at Harvard University.  The revised procedures are being employed this
 fall for the first time in making nominations to the Director of Central
 Intelligence of candidates for the next year's sessions.  Devised to
 insure that the best qualified persons are selected as representatives
 of the Director of Central Intelligence, the new procedures require that
 Heads of the Career Services review the qualifications of all eligible
 Career Staff members under their jurisdiction before recommending candi-
 dates.  Previously, only those individuals who applied were considered
 for the courses..  Now, individuals may apply for consideration as candi-
 dates, but they will be in competition zrith those who are identified by
 Career Boards as eligible.
 SELECTION PROCEDURES
 The eligibility of Career Staff employees will be reviewed annually
 by Career Service Boards.  Heads of Career Services will recommend to
 the Deputy Director concerned those Career Staff employees who are eli-
 gible for any one of the instructional programs.  The recommendations of
 Heads of Career Services may or may not include those individuals who
 have applied to their Career Service Boards.  Each Deputy Director will
 recommend to the CIA Career Council (prior to December of each year)
 two candidates for each position allocated to the Agency by each school.
 Principal and alternate candidates for each of the student positions will
 be recommended to the Director of Central Intelligence by the CIA Career
 Council in December.  The Director of Central Intelligence will make his
 nominations to the schools from this group.
 ELIGIBILITY REQUIRLfi?'tNTS
 only members of the CIA Career Staff will be considered for selec-
 tion to attend these schools.  Career Staff members who apply or are
 nominated must be qualified to meet the entrance requirements of the
 institution involved and be judged capable of achieving the objectives
 of the training pro,rram.  Further, attendance by the persons selected in
 these programs of instruction must be shown to benefit the Agency in
 their current assignments or assignments proposed for them by their
 Career Service Boards on completion of the instruction.  Qualifications
 required by the schools and colleges are detailed in the OTR Catalog.
