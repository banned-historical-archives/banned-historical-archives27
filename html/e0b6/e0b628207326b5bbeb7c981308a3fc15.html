 The Colombo powers' decision to include Communist
 China and North Vietnam among the 25 Asian and African
 states invited to a conference in Indonesia on 15 April
 has posed a dilemma for most of the non-Communist in-
 vitees.   Peiping,  on the other hand,  has hailed the
 conference as a historic opportunity to "expand the
 peace area" and marshal anticolonial sentiment against
 the West.
 PEIPING'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE BURMA INCREASING .  .  . Page 8
 As a result of Premier Nu's state visit to Com-
 munist China,  Peiping has obtained advantages it can
 exploit to expand its influence among the Burmese.
 Nevertheless, the underlying factor governing
 Rangoon's attitude toward Peiping is apprehension,
 and Burmese leaders desire to maintain their present
 policy of neutrality.
 PARIS ACCORDS MAY HINGE ON ARMS PRODUCTION POOL .  .  . Page 10
 Final French ratification of the Paris accords
 may hinge on success of negotiations,  scheduled to
 start on 17 January,  for an arms production pool
 within the projected Western European Union.   Unless
 an agreement assuring stronger controls over West
 German rearmament is in the offing by late February,
 the French Council of the Republic may throw the Paris
 accords back to the National Assembly, where approval
 on a second reading would face serious difficulties.
 CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CONTROL OF ARMY TIGHTENED .    Page 12
 Peiping has modernized and centralized the army's
 command structure, has retired several military leaders
 from active commands,  and has made the armed forces sub-
 ordinate to other state organs.   The aim clearly is to
 create an army fully responsive to the central leadership
 and to eliminate regional and personal loyalties.

 Soviet propaganda media, apparently in response to moves
 to rearm Western Germany and statements made by Western
 spokesmen, continue to warn of the terrible consequences of
 nuclear warfare and to make charges of American aggressive-
 ness.   A Red Star article, broadcast on 8 January to Western
 Europe, pointed to the danger of nuclear warfare to small,
 thickly populated countries.   One broadcast threatened Great
 Britain that in the event of another war,"all the consequences
 of atomic warfare will come crashing down on the British
 Isles," and another predicted that a war provoked by aggres-
 sive circles "will sweep onto the American continent as wol.l."
 Peiping seized upon the statements made by Admiral
 Radford in Seoul to comment that he "should have a look at
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  .  .while pressing for Japanese
 rearmament.   This, perhaps, would give him some impression of
 what would become of America if it starts atomic war."
 Moscow is also enlisting religion in its efforts to
 exploit fear and anxiety in the non-Communist world.   A
 series of statements by the leaders of the Orthodox, Old
 Believers, Baptist, Soviet Moslem, and Jewish religious
 orders in the Soviet Union has been publicized in support of
 the Moscow conference declaration and against the Paris
 agreements.   Concurrently, the French Communist spokesman,
 Courtade, seems to be calling for the extension of unity-of-
 action to Catholic working groups who, he says, "do not con-
 fuse religion with the temporal policy of the Vatican."
 This is not the first time the Kremlin has adopted a
 humanitarian pose to dissipate fears of Soviet aggression and to
 create doubts about the wisdom of proceeding with western
 policies.   The present campaign, however, places more
 emphasis than heretofore on Soviet retaliatory capabilities--
 underlining the assertion that the USSR fights for peace
 from a position of strength.

 ASIAN-AFRICAN CONFERENCE POSES DILEMMA FOR
 NON-COMMUNIST ASIAN POWERS
 The Colombo powers' decision to include Communist China
 and North Vietnam among the 25 Asian and African states in-
 vited to a conference In Indonesia on 15 April has posed a
 dilemma for most of the non-Communist invitees.*   They are
 reluctant to meet with Communist representatives,  but find it
 difficult to abstain from a meeting attended by a substantial
 number of their fellow Asians and Africans.   Peiping,  on the
 other hand, has hailed the conference as a:  historic opportuni-
 ty,  to "expand the peace area" and marshal anticolonial senti-
 ment against the West.
 While the non-Communist states can be expected to resist
 Nehru's or Chou En-lai's efforts to mold the conference,  anti-
 Communist personalities attending the meeting will have to
 consult closely if they are to seize the initiative.
 Seventeen countries approached by Indonesia before the
 Colombo powers' meeting at Bogor from 23 to 30 December ap-
 parently agreed informally to attend.   But at least the Arab
 League states  (Egypt,  Iraq,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Libya,  Saudi
 Arabia, Syria,  and Yemen)  seem to have been led to believe
 that Peiping would not be invited and made the Communists' ab-
 sence a condition of attendance.   These states,  as well as
 those closer to the West--Japan, Turkey,  Iran,  Thailand,  the
 Philippines,  Ethiopia,  the Central African Federation,  the
 Gold Coast and,  presumably,   Liberia--are generally conscious
 of the difficulties they court in attending a meeting with
 the Communists and are either awaiting or have sought Western
 advice.   The initial reactions of the Arab states,  however,
 indicate that they will be present.
 The purposes of the conference,  as set forth in the spon-
 soring prime ministers' communiqud of 29 December, are to pro-
 mote good will and co-operation; to consider social, economic
 and cultural problems;  to consider other problems of "special
 interest" to Asians and Africans,  such as national sovereignty,
 *S nsors are Burma,  Ceylon, India,  Pakistan and Indonesia.
 Invited are Afghanistan, Cambodia, the Central African
 Federation,  China, Egypt, Ethiopia,  the Gold Coast,  Iran,  Iraq,
 Japan, Jordan,  Laos,  Lebanon,  Liberia,  Libya,  Nepal, the Phil-
 ippines, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey,
 North Vietnam,  South Vietnam,   Yemen.

 racialism and colonialism; and to "view the position" of Asia
 and Africa and the contribution they can make to world peace
 and co-operation.
 These purposes are deliberately vague; the five sponsors
 themselves have found it best to stick to noncontroversial
 subjects in their own meetings.   What even Nehru has called
 the "odd assortment" of nations invited to Indonesia is likely
 to find that its clearest common denominator is only that
 these countries' differences from the European world are some-
 what more obvious than their differences from each other.
 The prime ministers of India, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma
 originally entertained the idea of such a conference as a sop
 to the prestige-seeking Indonesians.   India and Burma became
 actively interested in promoting it only in mid-December after
 Prime Minister U Nu had returned from his visit to Peiping,
 and it is fairly clear that U Nu and Nehru, with the Indone-
 sians in tow, now conceive of the conference primarily as a
 means for promoting the idea of "peaceful coexistence," par-
 ticularly between Communist China and the West.
 No non-Communist invitee except India's satellite Nepal
 has yet reacted favorably to this conception.   It is a view
 opposed by Pakistan and Ceylon, whose leaders prevented Nehru
 from citing his "five principles" of mutual noninterference
 and coexistence in their communiqud.   Nations allied with the
 West--Turkey, Thailand, the Philippines--also have clearly
 indicated. their intention to attack neutralism in any form,
 The aims of others are more disparate.  The attraction
 of the conference for the Arab states and Afghanistan is the
 opportunity to propagandize on behalf of special causes like
 the Palestinian refugee problem and Pushtoonistan,  The
 Japanese are attracted by the chance to renew their Asian
 contacts and by the opportunity of displaying an "independent"
 foreign policy.  Fear of renewing old antagonisms, however,
 will probably keep them from seeking a position of leadership,
 In contrast to the hesitation and mixed counsels of the
 non-Communist world, Peiping, echoed by widespread Orbit prop-
 aganda, has enthusiamtioally greeted the proposed meeting,
 The Chinese Communists will almost certainly go to the confer-
 ence with a definite and carefully thought-out program.  Pei-
 ping broadcasts claim that the main issue of the conference
 will be colonialism and that its main purpose is the expansion
 of the "peace area,"  Peiping has already hinted that it favors
 participation of North Korea in the conference.

 Chou En-lai will probably attend in person,  and is likely
 to try to attune his approach closely to those of India and
 Burma rather than present his program independently.   The
 Chinese are presumably aware that an attempt to dominate the
 proceedings openly would probably turn Nehru against them and
 increase the hostility of the other non-Communists.  The only
 anomaly in the over-all Communist attitude thus far has been
 the absence of comment from North Vietnam,
 As yet,  only Egypt has suggested even a somewhat hazy pro-
 gram for minimizing the Communists' chances for a diplomatic
 victory.   However,. none of the Arab states possesses the lead-
 ership necessary to make such a program effective,  and other
 actual or potential anti-Communist countries suffer either
 from this disability or from close identification with the
 Western alliance systems.   Pakistan's prime minister, Mohammad
 All,  has expressed buoyant confidence that if all the anti-
 Communists attend the conference,  they can "clobber" Peiping's
 representatives,  but this statesman's past promises have ex-
 ceeded his performance.
 Unless,  therefore,  there is considerable unity of view
 and planning among the most vigorously anti-Communist leaders
 before the conference opens,  Peiping may succeed in associat-
 ing the conference  result with its own objectives.

 PEIPING'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE BURMA INCREASING
 Sino-Burmese relations are closer than at any time in
 recent years as a result of Premier Nu's state visit to Commu-
 nist China.   In return for a pledge not to interfere in Burma's
 internal affairs and a promise to purchase a substantial quan-
 tity of rice, Peiping has obtained commercial and political
 advantages it can exploit to expand its influence among the
 Burmese.
 Peiping's efforts to overcome Burmese suspicions first
 became obvious last spring with the signing of a Sino-Burmese
 trade agreement and Nu's adherence in June to Chou's "five
 principles" of coexistence.   These efforts reached a climax
 during Nu's trip in December when the Chinese reaffirmed their
 adherence to the "five principles" of coexistence and agreed
 to purchase from 150,000 to 200,000 tons of rice annually
 during the next three years.
 Despite his previous reservations regarding Chinese Commu-
 nist intentions,  Nu was obviously impressed.   He returned to
 Rangoon extolling the virtues of the Mao regime and claiming
 that the assurances received constituted a triumph for Burma's
 neutral foreign policy.  At the meeting of the Colombo powers
 in Indonesia in late December,  Nu took the position that Burma's
 participation in the Asian-African conference was contingent
 on an invitation being issued to Peiping.
 During his trip,  Nu reiterated Burma's willingness to
 accept Chinese and Orbit goods in payment for rice.   The
 Communists thus are presented with an opportunity to develop
 an important toehold in the Burmese economy.   It is, moreover,
 a toehold that can be expanded if the Communists exploit Nu's
 agreement to the inauguration of air service, restoration of
 highway traffic,  and development of other means of communica-
 tions.
 Peiping also stands to gain politically and economically
 from a Burmese promise to allow the establishment of a consu-
 late general in Lashio in northern Burma.   Not only is Lashio
 the southern terminus of the Burma Road, but it is located in
 the border area where the Chinese Communists have been attempt-
 ing to increase their influence among various ethnic minority
 groups.

 For its part, Peiping has made no commitment on any matter
 the Burmese regard as sensitive.  When pressed on such problems
 as the status of Overseas Chinese, border demarcations, and the
 disavowal of Burmese Communist insurgents, the Chinese either
 stalled or gave evasive answers.
 Despite the increased cordiality in Sino-Burmese relations,
 the underlying factor governing the Burmese attitude toward
 Peiping is apprehension.   After Nu's return a cabinet officer
 stated that since Geneva,  his government had felt that it must
 "play safe" with its powerful neighbor.   Moreover,  it is fairly
 apparent that the Burmese hope Peiping's public denials of
 aggressive designs will serve as a safeguard to their independ-
 ence.
 There is little doubt that Burmese leaders want to main-
 tain their present policy of neutrality.   In this connection,
 U Nu has indicated a keen desire to visit the United States,
 apparently in the hope of effecting a rapprochement between
 the United States and Communist China.
 In the meantime, the premier's trip has evoked an extremely
 favorable public response in Burma.   A number of local editors
 fear Nu is leading the country "down a garden path" and that
 it will be difficult to counter the pro-Peiping sentiment his
 trip has generated.   Peiping, by judicious exploitation of
 Burmese anxiety and its enhanced prestige in Burma, may be
 able gradually to restrict Rangoon's freedom of action in
 both domestic and foreign affairs.

 PARIS ACCORDS MAY HINGE ON ARMS PRODUCTION POOL
 Final French ratification of the Paris accords may
 hinge on success of the negotiations, scheduled to start
 on 17 January, for an arms production pool within the pro-
 jected Western European Union.   Unless an agreement as-
 suring stronger controls over West German rearmament is
 in the offing by late February--an uncertain prospect at
 present--the French Council of the Republic may throw the
 Paris accords back to the National Assembly, where approval
 on a second reading would. face serious difficulties.
 The current French proposal for an "Armament Agency"
 contains features objectionable to other WEU countries.   It
 calls for an initial two-year period of voluntary participa-
 tion in a pool covering both arms standardization and pro-
 duction;  on 1 January 1957 the arms production programs of
 all WEU members would be co-ordinated under supranational
 control.   This proposal is much closer to a similar proj-
 ect  tentatively rejected at the London talks in October
 than France's partners had been led to expect.   It calls, for
 example, for full British participation in the arms pool,
 despite Britain's firm stand against this in October.   The
 French seem to be seeking to obtain EDC's advantages without
 its drawbacks.
 Other aspects of the French plan involve the United
 States directly.   Despite Washington's repeated rejection
 of the proposal, Mendes-France is pressing for American
 consent to funnel military aid to WEU countries through
 WEU machinery.   All the other WEU countries are expected to
 oppose such a change in the present bilateral set-up.
 Mendes-France is also eager to prevent West Germany from
 getting control of atomic weapons.   This may be an important
 element in the French position.
 In view of strong reservations voiced by the Low
 Countries, particularly the Netherlands, France is prepared
 to start out with Italy and West Germany, and any Benelux
 countries willing to join.   Current negotiations between
 Mendes-France and Premier Scelba appear to assure Italian
 participation.   The West German government has its own plans
 for a pool project using the Coal-Steel Community as the
 instrument of control,  and Mendes-France hopes to reach an
 understanding with Chancellor Adenauer in their negotiations
 beginning 14 January.

 The biggest stumbling blocks are expected to be
 Britain's refusal to sacrifice sovereignty and Dutch fears
 that the interests of small WEU members will be inadequately
 protected.   A Dutch official has also expressed the view that
 Mendes-France's arms-pool proposals are mainly an attempt to
 provide an alibi in the event France fails eventually to ratify
 the accords.   The British Foreign Office has indicated that
 though it considers the French proposal unworkable,  it will
 take a constructive attitude toward working-group discussions
 and has urged the Dutch to do the same.   The extent of Brit-
 ish participation may determine the type of controls over
 arms production which will be accepted by the continental WEU
 nations.
 The idea of stronger controls over West German rearmament
 is politically popular in France, and all non-Communist dep-
 uties                       favor the arms-pool concept as the surest way to con-
 trol German arms production.   The Paris accords provide only
 negative controls through an "Agency for the Control of Arma-
 ments" endowed with watchdog     functions over levels of forces
 and the manufacture of certain prohibited arms.   The current
 proposal implies the creation of a separate "Armament Agency,"
 but Mendes-France has indicated that he hopes to consolidate
 both watchdog  functions and positive controls in a single
 organization.
 Since the National Assembly reluctantly accepted'the
 Paris accords in December, Mendes-France has emphasized the
 necessity for some progress toward arms production control
 as well as toward East-West talks before the Council of the
 Republic votes on German rearmament.   The council will prob-
 ably                              object, however,  to the fact that the present proposal
 envisages an initial period of two years without controls,
 The control plan will also be vulnerable on the ground that
 after the two-year initial period France will be deprived
 of its veto in the WEU.   Furthermore, no amount of controls
 will eliminate the basic French fear that a rearmed and re-
 surgent West Germany will eventually supplant France as the
 dominant military as well as economic and political power in
 Western Europe.
 Though enough progress will probably be made by the WEU
 working group to convince the members of the French Council
 that further delay is unwarranted, time is running against the
 Paris accords as well as against Mendes-France's tenure in
 office.   Until the decision is taken the danger remains that
 the accords may be thrown back to the assembly for a second
 reading, in which event ratification would face considerable
 difficulties.

 *M-'        SECRET
 Peiping has modernized and centralized the army's command
 structure, has retired several military leaders from active
 commands, and has made the armod forces subordinate to other
 state organs (see chart, V. 14).   The aim clearly is to create
 an army fully responsive to the central leadership and to
 eliminate regional and personal loyalties.
 Politburo member Liu Shao-chi's remarks in February 1954
 about "independent kingdoms" enjoyed by the military presaged
 the retirement of certain leading army figures.   Subsequently,
 the abolition of the six regional administrations reduced the
 power of those military leaders who had exercised civil as well
 as military authority in their administrations.   The appointment
 of commanders of field armies and military areas to the regime's
 top military body further centralized power by requiring these
 officials to spend considerable time in Peiping, away from
 their command areas.
 When Peiping's new government organization went into
 effect last September, many military leaders were assigned to
 the State Council and to the National Defense Council while a
 group of younger and lesser-known officers took over many
 command posts.  Despite their retirement from active command,
 Communist China's old military heroes still appear to be in
 good standing with Mao and occupy positions of respect, if not
 of great authority, in the new government.
 Recent speeches by military figures have stressed the need
 for further modernization of the People's Liberation Army and
 training along Soviet lines.   This program has already resulted
 in reorganized and improved ground forces,  and clearly aims to
 develop stronger naval and air arms.
 The old concept of the Chinese Communist field army--as a
 semi-independent body occupying a particular area of China
 from which it recruited its manpower--appears to have been
 discarded.   There were no deputies elected from field armies
 to the National People's Congress last September, whereas the
 "volunteers" in Korea and the six regional military commands

 sent representatives.  However, there are indications that the
 functions of the regional military commands may have been
 changed.  These commands may henceforth recruit and train man-
 power and then transfer their trainees to tactical units
 operating elsewhere in China.
 Under Peiping's new constitution, military affairs have
 been subordinated in the government administration.  The
 function of the old People's Revolutionary Military Committee
 has been divided between the newly formed Ministry of National
 Defense under the State Council and the National Defense
 Council headed by Mao Tse-tung.
 Responsibility for building up the armed forces is
 invested in the State Council, which is defined as "the
 Central People's Government."  This is carried out through
 the Ministry of National Defense, headed by Peng Teh-huai,
 who apparently is also commander of the armed forces.   Thus
 the command functions as well as the administration of
 China's armed forces would seem to be under the Defense
 Ministry.
 The general staff is now subordinate to the army
 rather than to the National Defense Council, indicating
 that responsibility for direct military planning is also
 under the State Council.   Since the Ministry of Public
 Security falls under the jurisdiction of the State Council
 as well, all elements of the armed forces seem to be under
 the administrative organ of the state.
 The National Defense Council, on the other hand,
 seems to be an extragovernmental advisory body and is
 responsible primarily to Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-chi.
 In sum, it appears that considerable progress has
 been made in the past year toward establishing the armed
 forces in a subordinate position to the political apparatus.
 As older members of the military hierarchy die or become
 less active, personal and regional ties will be broken
 down and the new relationship between the armed forces and
 the government will become more binding.

 COMMUNISTS PUSH THE NATIONAL FRONT
 POLICY IN EASTERN EUROPE
 The National Fronts which have been developed in several
 of the Satellites during the past year as a major political
 aspect of the new course represent an attempt to gain greater
 popular support for the various Satellite regimes and parties.
 They are founded on a contradiction, however, which can be
 expected to stunt their growth.   The Satellite regimes are by
 definition regimes of total control,  and they cannot make
 enough real concessions to stimulate the initiative and support
 which they seek.
 The idea of the Front policy being followed in Eastern
 Europe is an adaptation of the successful tactics originally
 developed during the late 1930's in the countries of Western
 Europe.   The present policy in Eastern Europe calls for two
 organizations;   the National Front and the Communist Party.
 To enhance the Front concept, most of the Communist parties
 are called workers' parties.
 Side by side with this emphasis on the Front there has
 been an increasing concern with some of the tactical caveats
 concerning the Front policy, laid down in 1935.  Party leaders
 have warned in various ways against left sectarianism, over-
 estimating the degree to which the masses have been revolution-
 ized, underestimating the importance of youth organizations,
 and adopting a disparaging attitude toward national inde-
 pendence.
 The present objective of the Front is best illustrated
 in Hungary, where it has been touted as the social mechanism
 to achieve national unity and effective action through mass
 initiative.   This differs from that of the immediate postwar
 National Fronts, which were successfully used to eliminate
 non-Communist opposition.
 Last year Czechoslovakia,  Poland, and Hungary launched a
 concerted effort to revive the organizations of their moribund,
 postwar National Fronts in order to broaden minority support
 for the established regimes.   The Czech,,Polish and Hungarian
 Fronts were prominently employed in national elections last
 autumn, and have been used to bolster major aspects of Orbit
 foreign policy,   Czechoslovakia is exploiting religious
 leaders in Front activities more broadly than at any time in
 the past few years.   Unlike those in the other Satellites,  the
 Bulgarian Front continued to function, but at the moment lacks
 a clear direction.   In Rumania,  the Front concept has so far
 been ignored, but there is some evidence that it may be re-
 juvenated there,

 Approved F 4F Release 2001R"Eg1A-RDP79-OO   A000400140001-4
 Within the Communist parties themselves the Communists
 also face the problem of injecting some enthusiasm into the
 left Social Democrats whom they assimilated in 1948.  Since
 the party congresses last spring, disgraced politicians have
 been restored to minor public positions in Hungary and Rumania,
 and two assimilated left Social Democrats still in the Czech
 government have been promoted to the highest government and
 party levels.
 Concurrently with this re-emphasis, the sharp distinction
 between left and right Social Democrats was redrawn in the
 Rumanian party statutes drafted last August, and widely pub-
 licized in Czechoslovakia by the treason trial of several
 right Social Democrats last autumn.  The general treatment so
 far suggests a reapplication of the old Communist dictum that
 as Communists establish closer relations with left Social Demo-
 crats,  they must increase the vigor of their attacks on the
 right.
 There has been a noticeable tendency to soften the ex-
 treme demands for revolutionary vigilance which caused so many
 Communists heads to roll in the period from 1949 to 1952.
 Party officials imprisoned or disgraced at that time have re-
 appeared in small numbers in the Satellites.  At the party
 congresses, both Rakosi in Hungary and Chervenkov in Bulgaria
 tried to assess the vigilance concept more realistically by
 divorcing it from simple suspicion.  The Polish and Hungarian
 attacks on malpractices of the security services are related
 to this shift.   The Hungarian party has publicly expressed its
 concern about the effects of false arrest on party members
 and demanded that they be socially rehabilitated.
 The Front is based on an underlying assumption that the
 Communists although in firm control remain a minority group
 in a fundamentally unsympathetic environment and that they"
 must broaden their support,   Like the economic concessions of
 the new course, the political concessions are limited; there
 is little attempt to disguise the ultimate goal of total
 Communization,

 THE MOUNTING INSTABILITY IN CENTRAL AMERICA
 The outbreak of fighting at Villa Quesada in Costa Rica
 on 11 January came as the climax of Nicaragua's and Venezuela's
 nine-month-old "War of nerves" against the administration of
 Costa Rican president Figueres.   The Costa Rican developments
 coincide with increasing signs of domestic instability in
 Nicaragua,  El Salvador, Honduras,  Guatemala,  and Panama.*
 The rebel force now in action in Costa Rica is believed
 to consist of Costa Rican oppositionists and mercenaries, but
 the strategy and material support for the movement probably
 come from the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan governments.  Despite
 Nicaraguan denials of involvement,  the Organization of Ameri-
 can States (OAS) voted unanimously on 11 January to send a
 special OAS investigating committee to Costa Rica and
 Nicaragua.
 Nicaraguan president Somoza claims to have evidence that
 Figueres was implicated in last April's plot to assassinate
 him and seems intent on harassing Figueres out of office.
 Somoza told a Costa Rican emissary in mid-December that he
 would never enter into a rapprochement with Figueres.  The
 authoritarian government of Venezuela,  which hates Figueres
 for his close association with exiled Venezuelan oppositionists,
 is just as anxious to see Figueres fall.   Other rightist
 regimes in the Caribbean area,  including Guatemala and the
 Dominican Republic,  are generally aligned with Nicaragua
 and Venezuela.
 The arrival in Nicaragua on 2 January of Venezuelan
 military personnel and the flight on 6 January of seven
 Venezuelan C-47's to Nicaragua,  possibly carrying arms to
 Costa Rican revolutionaries,  immediately preceded the out-
 break of fighting in Costa Rica.   The Venezuelan foreign
 minister was extremely evasive about the planes in discussing
 the situation with Ambassador Warren on 8 January and re-
 marked that Venezuela would recognize "within two hours"
 any new government following the overthrow of Figueres.

 Five more Venezuelan C-47's were reported to have arrived
 in Nicaragua on 10 January.  On the same day Somoza told
 Ambassador Whelan in Managua that he believed a Costa Rican
 revolt "by. 100 percent Costa Ricans" will occur prior to
 15 January.   Somoza had previously promised the ambassador
 that he would warn him prior to any move against Figueres.
 Internal Tension in Nicaragua
 Since mid-December Somoza has repeatedly claimed knowl-
 edge of an assassination plot against him similar in nature
 to the April 1954 attempt on his life.  He accuses die-hard
 members of the opposition Conservative Party who strongly
 oppose his plans to have himself re-elected in 1956,  with
 assisting Figueres' agents.   On 3 January Somoza stated
 that he had recently arrested 27 persons who had been sent
 from Costa Rica to assassinate him.
 There may be some substance to Somoza's fears,       since
 in early December a Costa Rican official visiting Panama
 commented that Somoza would soon be. too "busy with his own
 back yard" to harass Costa Rica.   On 3 January a prominent
 member of the Nicaraguan opposition Conservative Party de-
 clared that his party "is definitely planning a new revolu-
 tion."   Somoza has increased his security precautions and
 a vague uneasiness has become apparent in Managua.   The
 National Guard,  Nicaragua's only armed force,  is believed
 loyal to the president and could probably suppress any
 attempted revolt.
 Panamanian Stability Undermined
 .Despite rumors to the contrary,  there is no evidence that
 any neighboring government was involved in the assassination
 of President Remon on 2 Januar.

 In any event Guizado lacks the personal following of
 his strong and popular predecessor.   While the situation
 for the present seems quiet,  differences between Guizado
 and some of Remon's adherents are already evident, and there
 is a possiblity that the government coalition may eventually
 dissolve into personal factions.   Rivalry may also be develop-
 ing between the top commandants of the National Guard,
 Stability in Honduras Still Precarious
 The political honeymoon in Honduras which has prevailed
 during the month since Julic Lozano assumed full powers of state
 with the collapse of constitutional order on 6 December
 may now be drawing to a close.   Reportedly,  Lozano has already
 angered important politico-military figures,  including
 ex-dictator and Nationalist Party chief Carias and former
 Reformist Party presidential candidate Williams,  by denying
 them the political patronage they felt entitled to.
 Among the Liberal Party members named to important
 posts, Lozano has included  members of the conservative faction
 of the party hostile to the dominant radical group led by
 Ramon Villeda Morales, who received a plurality in the Octo-
 ber presidential election.                           The.Liberals,  who are especially
 strong in labor,  gave their initial support to Lozano with
 some misgivings and many are bitter over the employment of
 force and fraud against their candidates during and after the
 October elections.   In Lozano's favor is the apparent strong
 support being given him by the majority of key army officers.
 The Lozano regime is also harassed by critical labor and
 economic problems in the vital north coast area, which was
 crippled by a ten-week general strike last spring and by
 disastrous floods in the autumn.   The area's largest employer,
 the United Fruit Company, has been forced to cut back its labor
 force radically.  This has been a serious blow to the new
 and insecure anti-Communist labor organization which is
 under incessant attack from Communist labor elements.
 Political Instability Growing in El Salvador
 Recent indications suggest that an intense behind-
 the-scenes political struggle may be developing in El
 Salvador over the choice of a successor to President Oscar

 Osorio, whose term ends in September 1956.   Osorio is
 reportedly insisting that the official presidential candi-
 date be Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, his minister of education.
 As a civilian and a leftist, Galindo is anathema to
 leaders-of the  oliticall  important army.
 Osor o appears to be
 osing the confidence of other key army leaders, though
 still enjoying wide popular support.
 Certain army leaders are also becoming apprehensive
 over what they consider the growing influence of leftists
 in the government.   Although Osorio has followed a strong
 anti-Communist policy in the past, at least one and proba-
 bly more Communists or pro-Communists remain on the govern-
 ment payroll.
 The Osorio administration is further weakened by its
 virtual isolation from other Central American governments.
 Osorio is strongly distrusted by Presidents Castillo Armas
 of Guatemala and Somoza of Nicaragua, who feel he was
 sympathetic to the former pro-Communist government in
 Guatemala and is being influenced by Communists at this time.
