SUBJECT 
D/DCl/NI  
: Comment on CIA Guest Speaker Program 
1. Action required: None; the following is the comment 
you requested. 
2. So far as they are known to me the list of prospective 
speakers is excellent. I assume that everyone would have names 
he (or she) would like to add. My own nominees, with brief 
justifications, are as follows: 
3. First, in a class by himself, a virtually unique observer 
of the European scene from the West German perspective: 
Theo Sommer, editor, Die Zeit, Hamburg; suggested 
subject, "The Two Germanys in Tomorrow's Europe." 
Sommer speaks perfect English, has a fine analytic mind, and knows 
European politics as well as any one man can. He visits the U.S. 
frequently. 
A very close second (I am not quite as confident of his 
(:::" 
speak' ability and his English is not quite perfect): 
1r Pierre Hassner, Centre d'etudes politiques, Paris; 
suggested subject, "Europe and the Gaullist Heritage." 
A second-place tie: 
Hedley Bull, Montague Burton Professor of International 
Relations, University of Oxford; suggested subject: 
"The future of Arms Control by International 
Agreement." 
Bull has been thinking constructively about arms control and 
disarmament longer than most of us. An Aust alian h has always

spoken his mind freely and superbly. 
4. Of knowledgeable and known Americans, I suggest the 
following obvious additions to the list: .41 
atv-01 
William Buckley, "A Conservative's Perspective on thet4J. 
United States in World Affairs." 
J. Kenneth Galbraith, "Does Capitalism Have a Future?"tii, 
Henry Kissinger, "Reflections on Intelligence and Foreign 
Policy." 
S. Finally, from Newport I can strongly recommend the 
following younger scholars, both acute analysts and first-class 
speakers whose audiences, even if small, will be enthusiastic: 
John Lewis Gaddis, Professor of History at the University 
of Ohio, author of United States Foreign Policy and the  
Cold War. Suggested subject, "National Strategy and 
Foreign Policy." 
Richard Ned Lebow, Associate Professor of Political 
Science at the City University of New York (on leave 
of absence), author of White Britain and Black Ireland:  
Stereotypes and the Anglo-Irish Colonial Relationship. 
Suggested subject, "On Ireland: Will the Troubles Never 
Cease?"

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 
VIA: 
2 SEP 19 
-1777W-
John F. Blake 
Acting Deputy Director of Central 
Intelligence 
FROM: Michael J. Malanick 
Acting Deputy Director for Administration 
SUBJECT: CIA Guest Speaker Program 
REFERENCE: Memo to DCI from John F. Blake, DDA, 
dated 11 August 1976, Same Subject 
(ER 76-8898) 
1. Action Requested: Your approval is requested of 
the attached list of proposed CIA Guest Speakers and tentative 
topics and the proposed (somewhat revised) operating procedures 
governing the program. 
-2. Background: The CIA Guest Speaker Program was 
inaugurated in October 1973 to provide intellectual stimulus 
to Agency employees through contact with the thinking of 
scholars, officials, and other experts outside the Agency. 
The program is held about six times a year in the CIA 
auditorium on the second Tuesday of the month, from 1500 to 
1630. All employees are invited to the lectutes, which are 
unclassified and off the record, and tickets are distributed 
through the Intelligence Community Staff to other agencies 
of the Intelligence Community. Since October 1973, there 
have been 31 guest speakers, including Zbigniew Brzezinski 
and Michael Blumenthal, both at the time in private capacity. 
(We carry them in the attached list also because of the 
desirability of hearing from them at some future time in 
their official capacities.) Other speakers have included 
Kelly Johnson, father of the U-2; Ambassador-at-Large 
Ellsworth Bunker; Joseph J. Sisco, President of American 
University; John K. Fairbank, China scholar of Harvard 
University; and John Kenneth Galbraith, the well-known 
economist and former Ambassador to India. As you know, the 
auditorium address of Senator Daniel K. Inouye, on 17 June 
1977, was under the aegis of the CIA Guest Speaker Program.

, Approved For Release 2004/02/19 : CIA-RDP80M00165P401200140007-0 
SUBJECT: CIA Guest Speaker Program 
Although the program has varied widely in attendance 
and content, we regard it as a success. Attendance for the 
1976-77 program ranged from 175 to 600 (an overflow). 
Average attendance has been about 370. The program has been 
conducted as a voluntary activity, with no effort to drum up 
audiences. The Intelligence Community attendance for the 
best-known speakers has been good. It is clear that the 
size of the audience has depended upon the renown of the 
speaker, not the value of the topic. 
3. Proposed Operating Procedures: 
a. Criteria for Selection. The following criteria 
for selection will govern the program: 
(1) The subject matter to be covered should 
have a significant bearing on the intelligence 
profession or on international affairs. 
(2) The subject matter should affect, or be 
of concern, to a broad cross section of Agency 
personnel--or to at least several Agency components--
in order to warrant inviting a large audience. 
(3) The person making the presentation 
should be well known and genuinely knowledgeable 
about the subject matter. In general, we seek the 
kind of speaker who is at the forefront of his 
subject. 
(4) The speaker should be'eff6ctive in 
communicating with a large audience representing 
disparate backgrounds. 
b. Categories of Speakers. The speakers will be 
drawn from the academic world, foundations, the business 
community, the media, Congress, and the executive 
departments of government. 
c. Numbers of Programs. Six per year, but this 
number may be exceeded if circumstances warrant. 
d. Time. Second Tuesday of the month, 1500-1630. 
e. Place. CIA Headquarters Auditorium.

subsequent speaker lists or invitations submitted to 
you. Approval will be limited by any qualifying statements 
you may affix to the attached list or otherwise provide. 
i. Invitations to Speakers. Official invitations 
will be extended by letter from you or your designated 
representative. In advance of a letter, the Special 
Programs Officer of the Office of Training is authorized 
to extend a telephonic invitation in your name, but in 
the sensitive cases described in paragraph k, below, 
only if they are first cleared with you. 
j. Security Approvals. Not required, but each 
proposed speaker will undergo an internal indices check 
by the Office of Security before being invited. 
k. Special Approvals of Sensitive Cases. Members 
of Congress, representatives of the media, and politically 
sensitive cases will be submitted to you for specific 
approval at the time of invitation. 
1. Distribution of Tickets. Via component 
Training Officers to each Directorate and the DCI area; 
via the Intelligence Community Staff to the Intelligence 
Community; via OTR to the Foreign Service Institute and 
Defense schools and colleges. Seats will be held for 
ticket holders until five minutes prior to the scheduled 
lecture, at which time non-ticket holders will be 
admitted to the extent space is available. 
m. Visits in Advance of the Lecture. You will 
be given an opportunity to meet with the speaker in

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence 
FROM John F. Blake 
Deputy Director for Administration 
SUBJECT CIA Guest Speaker Program 
_ 
1. Purpose: The purpose of this memorandum is to 
obtain your approval of a list of proposed CIA Guest Speakers 
and tentative topics, and to solicit your recommendations as 
to additions to the list and your comments or qualifying 
statements with respect to any individual candidate or 
category of candidates. .The list, which is attached, has 
been screened within each of the Directorates and by 
Mr. Falkiewicz. Our purpose is also to seek your approval 
of the operating procedures governing the program. 
2.. Background: The CIA Guest Speaker Program was 
inaugurated in October 1973 to provide iatelLe..cIual_stimuLus 
to Agency employees through contact with the thinking of 
scholars, officials, and other experts outside the Agency. 
The Program has been held nine times a year (with a few 
exceptions) in the CIA Auditorium on the second :Tuesday of 
each month, from 3 to 5 p.m. All employees have been invited 
to the lectures, which are unclassified, and tickets have 
been distributed through the Intelligence Community Staff to 
other agencies of the Intelligence Community. 
Since October 1973, there have been 24 Guest 
Speakers, including, for example, Zbigniew Brzezinski, 
Director of the Research Institute on Communist Affairs of 
Columbia University; Ambassador-at-Large Ellsworth Bunker; 
Wernher von Braun, Director of the George C. Marshall Space 
Flight Center in Huntsville; and Kelly Johnson, father of 
the U-2. The goal has been to have well-known speakers in 
the forefront of their fields, speaking on topics of relevance 
to intelligence. 
We regard the program as a success. Attendance 
has ranged from 200 to over 500, with an average attendance 
of over 300. Attendance by representatives of the Intelligence

STAT 
AllkINISTitAil.L.: ? 
!lie lease 2004/02/19 : CI -

Community has been consistently good. Employee comments 
have been favorable. Although we are well satisfied with 
the program, we have found it difficult to sustain the high 
level through nine programs a year and are proposing below 
that it be limited to six. We are also proposing a broadening 
of the categories of those invited to speak. 
Our procedure in the past has been to have lists 
of proposed Guest Speakers, together with tentative topics 
approved in advance by the Director of Central Intelligence, 
in whose name invitations are ektended. DCI approval of a 
list has been an indication of policy approval only. A 
security approval has also been obtained before the extension 
of an invitation. We have been working from three approved 
lists, the last one approved on 20 March 1975. 
? 3. Criteria for Selection: The following criteria 
for selection. govern the program: 
a. The subject matter to be covered should have 
a significant bearing on the work of the Agency, the 
Intelligence Community, or high-level intelligence 
customers; 
b. The subject matter should affect or be of 
concern to a cross section of Agency personnel or to at 
least several Agency components in order to warrant 
inviting a large audience; 
c. The person making the presentation should be 
well-known .and genuinely knowledgeable about the subject 
matter. In general we seek the kind of speaker who is 
at the forefront of his subject; and 
d. He or she should be effective in communicating 
with a large audience representing disparate backgrounds. 
4. Categories of Speakers: Most of our speakers in 
the past three years have come?Yrom the academic world with 
only a few from the executive departments of the U.S. Government 
the business community, and the media. We have had no 
representatives from Congress. In the attached list we have 
included the latter as well as additional representatives of 
the other categories. A few critics of the Agency are on 
the list. In our view all have contributions to make to 
this Agency in enlarging our appreciation of the place of 
intelligence in a democratic society. Because of the sensi-
tivity of inviting members of the media and of Congress, we

?ropose to treat these two categories as ones requiring 
t.:.itional clearance at the time of invitation. Similarly, 
we would not invite anyone involved in an election campaign 
with these are over and, even afterward, would seek specific 
approval before extending an ,invitation. 
Mr. Falkiewicz has suggested the inclusion also of 
Robert McNamara, President of the World Bank, and the 
Ambassadors to the United States of Great Britain and West 
Germany. He suggests that we let these (and perhaps other) 
foreign nationals and officials of international organizations 
decide for themselves the appropriateness of speaking to 
CIA. I have no doubt of the value to us of such presentations 
and am listing their names in the attachment, out of alpha-
betical order, as a special category. In these cases we 
would seek your specific approval and also initiate any 
action through you. 
5. Operating Procedures 
a. Number of Programs(14_pe_el three in 
the fall and three in the spring. (This represents a 
change from the nine programs of past years.) 
b. . Time - second Tuesday of the month, 3-5 p.m. 
c. Place - CIA Headquarters Auditorium. 
d. Fee - $500 honorarium plus round-trip transpor-
tation (the fee we now offer). Of course, U.S. Government 
employees do not receive a fee. 
e. Management of the program, including selection 
of speakers from the approved list by the Office of 
Training (Special Programs Officer), subject to the 
restrictions indicated below. 
f. Policy Approval - via :this memorandum and any 
subsequent speaker lists submitted to you. Approval 
will be limited by any qualifying statements you may 
affix to the attached list or otherwise provide. 
g. Special Approvals - Members of Congress, 
representatives of the media, and politically sensitive 
cases will be submitted for your additional approval on 
a case-by-case basis. Any action on the names in the 
special category will be initiated through you.

h. Security Approvals - where not already available, 
will be obtained after policy approval and in advance 
of the invitation to speak. 
i. Distribution of Tickets - via component training 
officers, to each Directorate and the DCI area; and, via the 
Intelligence Community Staff, to the Intelligence Community. 
j. Invitations to Speakers - by the Office of Training 
in the name of the Director of Central Intelligence (unless 
we receive a prior indication from you or we ourselves 
conclude that a personal invitation from you or another 
officer is more appropriate). As indicated, the special 
category will be invited only through you. 
In the past it has been customary for the Director, 
when convenient, to visit for a few moments with the CIA 
Guest Speaker in advance of the ecture. We believe that 
this practice pays dividends in good will for the Agency and 
would hope it could continue.
