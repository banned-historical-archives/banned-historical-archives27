 Tokyo.  This makes it apparent that the USSR plans
 to continue stalling on a settlement.  The Kremlin
 probably hopes in this way eventually to resume re-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1955
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Soviet Attitude
 Toward Great-Power Talks
 The Soviet position on the
 possibility of great-power
 talks has not moved beyond
 Bulganin's cautious statement
 of 26 March that the USSR takes
 "a positive view" of such talks.
 The Soviet leaders probably
 intend to avoid any further
 commitments until they have
 tested Western intentions in
 the forthcoming negotiations
 with Austrian leaders in Moscow.
 A Pravda editorial on 2
 April asserted that the USSR is
 still advocating great-power
 talks which would ease inter-
 national tension and cited in
 particular Moscow's proposal.
 for a four-power conference on
 Austria.  The editorial also
 suggested that it is still
 possible to "retard the course
 of events" and "bar the road to
 war" but added the warning that
 "the more time is allowed to
 elapse, the more difficult this
 will be."
 Voroshilov warned on 3
 April that the peoples of the
 Soviet Union and the "People's
 Democracies" would respond to
 the increased dangers of a new
 war brought about by ratifica-
 tion of the Paris agreements
 by mobilizing their forces
 "for increasing the economic
 strength and'defensive capacity
 of their countries."
 Moscow continues to draw
 a distinction between a four-
 power conference on German re-
 unification--which it would be
 willing to attend only if the
 Paris accords are renounced--
 and a conference of four or more
 powers on other questions such
 as Austria, reduction of ten-
 sions, European security, dis-
 armament and Asian questions.
 Some hint as to the pos
 sible agenda of a great-power
 conference which in the Soviet
 view "might contribute to less-
 ening international tension"
 was contained in a recent New
 Times article.   The article
 re erred to the "many unsettled
 questions in international re-
 lations which urgently demand
 the attention of the great
 powers, beginning with the
 Austrian state treaty and ending
 with the problems of rearmament
 and an atomic and hydrogen
 weapons ban."
 The official organ of the
 Soviet High Commission in East
 Germany also pointed out re-
 cently that "other tension-pro-
 ducing problems besides Germany
 exist," and mentioned atomic
 energy and Asia in particular.
 Soviet-Austrian Talks
 No further Soviet moves
 on Austria are likely before
 the Austrian delegation,'s
 arrival in Moscow on 11 April,
 but there has been a new hint
 of Soviet terms for a state
 treaty.   Soviet officials in
 Vienna have been circulating
 rumors that after the conclusion
 of a treaty the USSR would be
 willing to reduce its troops
 to a small number to be sta-
 tioned in one place.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 April 1955
 The USSR is probably
 sounding out Austrian reaction
 to a demand--foreshadowed in
 its latest note--to maintain
 troops in Austria for a long
 time after a treaty is signed.
 Last fall Austrian leaders re-
 buffed similar Soviet feelers
 on keeping troops at a few
 bases for a long period.
 Moscow may also insist on
 the right to send troops back
 into Austria in case it sees
 a serious threat of an An-
 schluss,
 Top-level Austrian offi-
 cials assert that the Austrian
 delegation to Moscow will make
 no commitments and will merely
 attempt to explore the nature
 of neutralization and anti-
 Anschluss guarantees desired
 by the USSR.  Most Austrian
 leaders appear willing to in-
 sert a neutrality declaration
 in the treaty, and they are
 Japan-USSR Negotiations
 Moscow rejected on 4 April
 Tokyo's proposal of 23 February
 that delegations of the two
 countries meet in New York to
 discuss resumption of diplomatic
 relations.  The USSR stated that
 "under present conditions, it
 seems expedient to choose either
 Tokyo or Moscow,"
 Soviet leaders apparently
 are stalling on the negotiations
 in an attempt to take advantage
 of Hatoyama's eagerness to re-
 sume relations.  The Soviet
 government probably feels t yat
 the longer it waits, the less
 Tokyo will demand as precon-
 ditions.
 Moscow's earlier implied
 willingness to accept New York
 as the site for negotiations
 was probably a temporary tactic
 designed to encourage Japanese
 political leaders to commit
 themselves during the Japanese
 convinced that some form of
 four-power guarantee of Austrian
 neutrality will be necessary.
 According to Ambassador
 Thompson in Vienna, Chancellor
 Raab believes that if he does
 not achieve a treaty "on this
 round," Austria will probably
 be partitioned.  'Raab is re-
 ported to have become more pes-
 simistic concerning the success
 of the Moscow trip.
 election campaign in favor of
 closer relations with the Sino-
 Soviet bloc,  thus weakening
 Japan's bargaining position.
 The Soviet Union's pref-
 erence for negotiations in
 Tokyo, as an alternative to
 Moscow, probably reflects a
 hope of obtaining recognition
 for its unofficial mission in
 the Japanese capital.  Moscow
 has utilized the mission chief,
 Domnitsky, and ignored the
 United Nations as a channel for
 its communications on the pro-
 posed negotiations.
 This probably foreshadows
 a Soviet effort to raise the
 mission in Tokyo to diplomatic
 status.   Moscow may feel that
 its stalling tactics will finally
 force Hatoyama to accept such
 a solution.   Stalling would have
 the additional advantage of
 making a flat Soviet denial of

 Tokyo's territorial hopes un-
 necessary at this time,  leav-
 ing the fulfillment of these
 hopes as a possible--though
 unlikely--prize for closer
 Japanese co-operation with the
 USSR in the future.
 In by-passing the UN and
 presenting its note of 4 April
 through its unofficial mission
 in Japan,  the USSR upset Japa-
 nese strategy.
 This strategy apparently
 was to publicize New York as
 the site of the negotiations in
 an effort to conduct prelimi-
 nary talks there between Japa-
 nese and Soviet representatives
 at the UN, and avoid further
 contacts with the Soviet repre-
 sentatives in Tokyo.
 East German Truck Tax
 Harasses West Berlin
 The exorbitant tax imposed
 by the East German government
 on West German trucks traveling
 to and from Berlin is a. delib-
 erate harassment designed to
 point up the vulnerability of
 West Berlin.
 Imposition of the tax fol-
 lows earlier Soviet threats of
 retaliation in the event of
 West German ratification of the
 Paris agreements, and tests
 West German { -+.erminatior. to
 proceed with rearmament.   It is
 clearly an effort to assert
 East Germany's claim to sover-
 eignty and develop a, bargain-
 ing lever for obtaining all-
 German negotiations.
 The tax may be followed by
 other measures of harassment,
 but a full-scale blockade would
 be inconsistent with the USSR's
 claim that it seeks a, reduction
 of international tension,  and
 in particular with the Soviet
 desire to improve relations
 with West Germany.
 In any case, use of mili-
 tary force to impose a, blockade
 is unlikely, since the Western
 powers have made it clear that
 they are determined to hold
 Berlin.
 The extent of additional
 measures will probably depend
 upon Western reaction to the
 truck tax.   Because of West
 German subsidies granted for
 the period through 21 April,
 the tax has not resulted in a
 cessation or diminution of the
 truck traffic.

 While conflicting East
 German press statements have
 left doubt as to East Germany's
 willingness to negotiate the
 question of taxes on trucking
 between West Germany and Berlin,
 the East German government prob-
 ably  will eventually be pre-
 pare,. to lower the tax to a
 reasonable level in return for
 West German concessions.
 By attributing the increase
 to strictly economic rather
 than political reasons, East
 Germany has left itself free to
 reduce the tolls in return for
 adequate economic concessions.
 Official West German and
 West Berlin reaction has been
 one of restraint and
 careful appraisal.
 As a preliminary
 measure',  the Bundestag
 passed a.resolution
 which denounced the
 new road tax as a po-
 litical move and called
 on the Bonn govern-
 ment to issue an of-
 ficial protest and
 take  necessary
 countermeasures.
 Bonn's most ef-
 fective means of re-
 taliation is in the
 field of interzonal
 trade, or which nego-
 tiations were in prog-
 ress when the new
 trucking tax was an-
 nounced.   The West
 Germans temporarily
 withdrew from the ne-
 gotiations, but of-
 ficials have since
 resumed the trade
 talks, probably in
 the hope of resolving
 the trucking tax issue
 on that level.
 Bonn officials
 want to threaten the termination
 of Western deliveries of key
 products such as Ruhr coke and
 steel to East Germany in order
 to force the Communists to re-
 lax the levies on trucking.
 This threat, they say,
 should take the form of a
 Bundestag proposal for an ex-
 orbitant tax on exports to East
 Germany.   The tax would be set
 so high that Western exporters
 could not pay unless the costs
 were absorbed by the East
 German government.   The pro-
 ceeds of the tax would then be
 placed in a special fund to
 pay the East German truck taxes.

 Satellite Agricultural
 Outlook
 The European Satellites
 are entering the spring plant-
 ing season with a less than
 even chance to achieve acreage
 increases envisaged in their
 agricultural plans.
 Good agricultural yields
 are needed this year to pre-
 vent repetition of the diffi-
 culties of the last two years
 when generally poor harvests
 forced several Satellites to
 expend scarce foreign currencies
 to, import large quantities of
 bread grains and other agri-
 cultural products.
 Most Satellites needed a
 mild winter or an early spring
 to catch up on plowing and seed-
 ing programs left unfinished
 last fall because of late har-
 vesting and peasant apathy.
 Late winter plowing was
 prevented by frozen soil in
 East Germany, Poland, and
 Czechoslovakia, and by above
 normal precipitation in the
 southern Satellites.
 Intensive press and radio
 campaigns to recruit industrial
 workers for field labor are
 being waged in East Germany
 and Czechoslovakia, and
 propaganda programs designed
 to accelerate spring planting
 are under way throughout
 the whole of Eastern Europe.
 Spring weather is al-
 ready three to four weeks
 late, increasing the prcb-
 ability  that plowing and
 planting schedules will not
 be met.

 Chinese Communist Party
 Conference
 The Chinese Communist Party
 conference of 21-31 March con-
 firmed the fall of politburo
 member Kao Kang and organization
 chief Jao Shu-shih, both of
 whom had once been high in Mao
 Tse-tung's favor.   This is the
 first known expulsion of a
 Chinese Communist party member
 at this level since 1938.
 Both Kao and Jao were
 found guilty of resisting the
 authority of the rest of the
 party leadership under Mao
 Tse-tung.   Their fall climaxes
 a drive for "unity" among the
 leadership which began in
 early 1954, when Kao and Jao
 dropped out of the news.
 The charge against both
 men may well be true, as both
 had excellent opportunities
 for building "independent
 kingdoms," the explicit target
 of the "unity" drive.
 they were proteg?s of deposed
 Soviet leaders.
 There is no evidence to
 indicate which, if any, of the
 possibilities involving the
 Soviet Union is true.   Forth-
 coming party pronouncements
 may illuminate this question.
 Neither Kao nor Jao re-
 pented, according to Peiping.
 Kao is said to have committed
 suicide as an "expression of
 his ultimate betrayal of the
 party," while Jao "persists in
 an attitude of attacking the
 party."
 The party took unspecified
 disciplinary action against
 seven lesser officials, six of
 whom were Kao's lieutenants in
 Manchuria.   Action may be taken
 against onetime subordinates of
 Jao in East China, or against
 associates of both in Peiping.
 Kao and Jao were the party
 bosses of Manchuria and East
 China, respectively, until 1953.
 Kao then became chairman of the
 state planning commission and
 Jao became the party's person-
 nel director for all of China.
 There is speculation
 that the fall of both men re-
 sulted in part from their
 relationships with Soviet
 leaders.   For example, either
 could have appealed for Soviet
 backing against Peiping at the
 regional or national level.
 On the other hand, either could
 have resisted Soviet in 1n'ence
 with the regime.   Conceivably,
 The central committee has
 elected Teng Hsiao-ping and
 Lin Piao, both vice premiers
 under Chou En-lai, to the
 party's politburo.   Teng has
 risen rapidly in the party, and
 was considered a logical choice.
 The appointment of Lin,
 who commanded the Chinese Commu-
 nist forces in Korea until. early
 1951 and has since been reported
 "sick," brings a third top
 military leader -to the policy-
 making politburo.

 There is substantial evi-

 effort--supported  by the Com-

 to the "five principles" of co-

 Manila pact and the Formosa

 current cabinet was set up
 solely for the purpose of organ-
 izing elections.   The Democrats
 are reluctant, however, to chal-
 lenge the authority of the crown.
 Although the left wing of the
 Democratic Party includes anti-
 monarchists and perhaps Commu-
 nists, some of its most influen-
 tial members
 pro-Western.
 Nehru's criticism of the
 West in the Indian parliament
 on 31 March is indicative of
 the feelings among Asian na-
 tionalist leaders which might
 erupt at Bandung, although
 Nehru himself may be more cir-
 cumspect in "mixed company."
 Meanwhile, Peiping has
 launched a large-scale propa-
 ganda campaign on the confer-
 ence.   The main themes of the
 campaign are Asian-African sol-
 idarity, coexistence, and Amer-
 ican malevolence.   Peiping's
 propaganda has also attempted
 to link the "five principles"
 to the Formosan issue by as-
 serting that they imply the
 right to resist "aggressive
 acts" by others--meaning by the
 United States.
 It is obvious from this
 that the Communists are adopt-
 ing a position parallel to that
 of the neutralists as a means
 of expressing their views while
 avoiding the appearance of be-
 ing unduly aggressive.

 Arab Middle East Defense Plans
 The announcement on
 4 April that Pakistan intends
 to join the Turkish-Iraqi pact
 is unlikely to have any
 immediate effect on the atti-
 tudes of the Arab states which
 oppose the "northern tier" de-
 fense concept.
 Pakistan's action, follow-

 Syrian prime minister Azm,

 developments in Syria may

 Iraqi-Syrian union, even though
 the idea must be "shelved for
 the time being."
 Iraq is unlikely to take
 definite steps toward union
 unless it has assurances of
 foreign acquiescence, and it is
 unlikely to secure such as-
 surances at the present time.
 if, however, the Syrian situa-
 tion deteriorates further and
 the Iraqis develop firm plans,
 Turkey and Britain probably
 could be expected to give
 passive approval to such an
 Iraqi move.
 Bashayan has declared that
 the present Syrian government
 will not last long, and ex-
 pressed fear on 2 April that a
 new government will be more
 leftist than Asali's cabinet.
 He believes that rightist forces

 JAPAN'S TERRITORIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE USSR
 Japan will undoubtedly use
 historical and geographical
 arguments in pressing the Soviet
 Union for the return of the
 Habomais, Shikotan, and the
 southern Kurils in the forth-
 coming negotiations.  Russia's
 anticipated refusal to return
 these islands will be a
 serious and continuing irritant
 to Soviet-Japanese relations.
 The islands total some
 4,000 square miles in area and
 had a prewar Japanese popula-
 tion of about 15,000, all but
 200 of whom inhabited the
 portions claimed by Japan.
 The chief economic asset
 of the area is its fishing
 grounds, which provided 40 per-
 cent of Hokkaido's fish catch,
 worth about $9,000,000 annually,
 before the war.  Russian
 occupation has seriously
 harassed Japanese fishing
 operations in these waters and
 caused severe local unemploy-
 ment.
 Soviet enforcement of the
 12-mile limit around the islands
 also creates navigation diffi-
 culties for shipping between
 the Sea of Okhotsk and the
 Pacific Ocean.   Kunashiri and
 the southernmost Habomai island
 of Suisho are only 12 miles and
 4.5 miles respectively from
 the Japanese mainland.
 Russian proximity to Hok-
 kaido has aggravated Japan's
 security problems by facilitat-
 ing Communist espionage and
 subversion on Hokkaido.
 Finally, the dense fogs
 in the Kuril region have
 caused Japanese vessels to stray
 into Soviet territory and have
 resulted in frequent seizures
 of Japanese vessels.
 Tokyo will probably argue
 that the Habomais and Shikotan
 e not part of the Kurils but
 ae merely an extension of the
 Hanasaki Peninsula on Hokkaido.
 They are south of the main
 Kuril chain and were originally
 administered separately.  The
 United States has publicly
 supported Japan's claims to
 the Habomais.
 There is a historical
 basis for the Japanese desire
 for separate consideration of
 at least the two southern
 Kuril islands of Kunashiri and
 Etorofu.   These islands were
 never under Russian jurisdic-
 tion, and Russia explicity
 recognized Japan's claim to
 them in 1855, when the two
 countries agreed to draw their
 boundary between Etorofu and
 Uruppu.
 The Russo-Japanese treaty
 of St. Petersburg in 1875 gave
 Japan the northern Kurils as
 well, in exchange for southern
 Sakhalin.   Consequently, Japan
 maintains that the Kurils were
 not territories acquired in
 "violence and greed," which
 the Cairo Declaration said
 would be taken from Japan.
 Tokyo further  emphasizes that
 it has never recognized the
 Yalta decision handing over
 the Kurils to the Soviet Union.
 Japanese officials bolster
 their position with the asser-
 tion that although Japan re-
 nounced its rights and claims
 to the Kurils at San Francisco,
 the treaty does not specify
 the beneficiary.  Moreover,
 Moscow cannot claim the bene-
 fits of the treaty unless the
 USSR signs it.   The treaty is
 open to signature only until
 27 April.
 The Japanese Foreign
 Ministry is privately pessimis-
 tic over Japan's chances of
 regaining its lost territories.

 Communist colonization and
 development of the islands and
 the USSR reaffirmed its claims
 to the Habomais and Shikotan
 as recently as 30 December 1954.
 Japan's failure to achieve
 its goals in the negotiations
 presumably could cool popular
 ardor for close ties with the
 Sino-Soviet bloc and revive
 suspicions concerning Russia's
 good faith.  Friction over
 fishing rights in the Kuril
 area and continuing seizures of
 Japanese fishing vessels would
 keep irredentist feelings alive.
 The Hatoyama
 government would be
 vulnerable to
 charges it had
 failed to protect
 the national in-
 terest.
 Hatoyama has
 already implied
 that the government
 would not try very
 hard for the return
 of southern Sakhalin
 and the Kurils
 "because of the
 San Francisco
 treaty."
 He seems to be
 preparing to equate
 the Ryukyus and
 Bonins with the
 Habomais and
 Shikotan as the only
 territories Japan can justifi-
 ably seek from the United States
 and the USSR.
 Nevertheless, the emotional
 reactions stirred up by questions
 of territorial sovereignty--for
 example, the controversy with
 South Korea over the barren
 Liancourt Rocks--serves as a
 reminder that in the coming ne-
 gotiations the question of the
 Kurils could be Prime Minister
 Hatoyama's Achilles''heel;and a
 strong arguin  point for his
 opposition.
 THE PROBLEM OF SUDANESE INDEPENDENCE
 The growing pro-Western
 independence movement in the
 Sudan is increasingly likely to
 clash with Egypt's efforts to
 achieve union of the two coun-
 tries.

 i?a?heeting mounting opposition
 as a result of its unionist
 policy and may be forced to
 modify its Position to remain
 in power.
 Cairo, however, has indi-
 cated that it intends:,to obtain
 union with the Sudan at all
 costs and probably will step
 up its covert activities and
 manipulations.
 The Sudan is expected to
 decide on its future status
 either late this year or early
 in 1956.   Under the terms of
 the 1953 Anglo-Egyptian agree-
 ment on Sudanese self-govern-
 ment and self-determination,
 the Sudanese parliament is to
 pass a resolution calling for
 the election of a constituent
 assembly.  This assembly will
 decide whether the Sudan is to
 be completely independent, or
 whether there will be some
 form of union with Egypt.
 The Sudanese government re-
 portedly intends to call an
 extraordinary session of par-
 liament in August as the first
 step toward setting up a con-
 stituent assembly.
 Geography and Economy
 Administered by the British
 as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium
 from 1899 until the inauguration
 of self-government in January
 1954, the Sudan--with an esti-
 mated:population of more than,
 8,000,000--is sharply divided
 culturally, ethnically and
 geographically along approxi-
 mately the twelfth parallel.
 Some 5,000,000 Arabic-
 speaking Moslems live in the
 northern portion.   The tropi-
 cal southern region, where
 over 32 different languages
 are spoken, is inhabited by
 primitive tribes.   As a result
 of Moslem exploitation, these
 largely pagan people are deep-
 ly antagonistic toward the
 Moslem north, and toward Egypt.
 The Sudan has a total crop
 area of roughly 2,500,000 acres,
 most of which is in cotton.
 Cotton accounts for 70 to
 80 percent of the Sudan's
 total exports and for approxi-
 mately 60 percent of the govern-
 ment's revenue.   No development
 survey has ever been conducted
 in the area.
 Internal Politics
 Organized political activi-
 ty in the Sudan is based on two
 Islamic religious sects, the
 Ansar and the Khatmia.
 Sayyid Abdul Rahman al-
 Mahdi, as leader of the anti-
 Egyptian Ansar, commands the
 absolute obedience of some
 1,400,000 followers, largely
 among the tribesmen of the

 central and northwestern Sudan.
 He also controls the pro-
 independence Umma Party, which
 is, in effect,-the political
 counterpart of the sect.         The
 Mahdi has in the past been
 closely identified with British
 interests in the Sudan.
 Sayyid All Mirghani, who
 heads the Khatmia, is believed
 to hold the key to the Sudan's
 future.   Salah Salim, Egyptian
 minister of state for Sudanese
 affairs, boasts that Egypt
 "owns" Mirghani, but Mirghani
 is believed to be sufficiently
 agile to straddle the issue of
 independence vs. union until
 the outcome is clear and then
 take the winning side.
 The Khatmia's strength is
 concentrated in the north and
 northeast.  A large proportion
 of its 1,500,000 members are
 urban merchants and traders
 and the sect is considered no
 match for the warrior tribes-
 men of the Mahdi in the event
 of an outbreak of civil dis-
 orders.
 Mirghani does not have
 the personal authority over his
 followers which the Mahdi
 maintains.   A life-long oppo-
 nent of the Mahdi, Mirghani has
 in the past tended to align
 himself with Egypt. in an effort
 to counter British support for
 his rival.   It was Khatmia
 support for the Egyptian-
 sponsored National Unionist
 Party that was responsible for
 its victory in the November 1953
 elections of the first Sudanese
 self-governing parliament.
 The Khatmia is now seri-
 ously split, however,. with an
 important element favoring in-
 dependence rather than any
 form of union.   In what direc-
 tion Mirghani will ultimately
 throw his influence is unknown.
 Salah Salim, who directs
 Cairo's activities in the Sudan,
 has expressed his disgust for
 Mirghani's "indecisiveness" and
 "failure to take leadership."
 Egyptian Policies
 Egypt has pursued a pol-
 icy of "buy and rule" in the
 Sudan in an effort to assure
 union of the two countries.
 Salah Salim has bluntly
 stated that he can buy any
 Sudanese politician and has
 declared with probable exagger-
 ation that Egypt is spending
 "millions of pounds" to achieve
 its objectives in the Sudan.
 During the past six
 months, however, there has been
 a considerable increase in the
 number of Sudanese favoring
 complete independence.  Many
 Sudanese who originally sup-
 ported Egypt largely as a
 means of ridding the country
 of Britain's rule are not
 anxious to substitute that of
 Egypt.
 The virtual liquidation
 of the British administration
 during the past year and the
 accompanying "Sudanization"
 of the government services has
 had a marked effect on the in-
 dependence movement.
 The cabinet crisis of
 December 1954, which resulted
 in the resignation of three
 prominent Khatmia ministers,
 brought the conflict between
 the pro-independence elements
 in the Khatmia and the
 Egyptian-subsidized politicians
 to the fore.
 The Independence Movement
 The Khatrnia ministers
 subsequently started a new
 party--the Independence Repub-
 lican Party--and appealed for
 the support of all groups
 favoring Sudanese independence,
 While Mirghani is reported to
 have granted the party his
 "patronage," he has continued
 to lend support to the National
 Unionist Party.
 The Independence Republi-
 can Party has refused to co-
 operate-with the new independence

 front in parliament, apparently
 because it does not want to
 bring about the fall of the
 Azhari government at this time.
 The front, which emerged during
 the current session, is made up
 of the Umma Party and other pro-
 independence groups, including
 the one Communist deputy.   It
 has attacked the Azhari govern-
 ment in the last month for its
 pro-Egyptian policy, but lacks
 by a small margin the votes
 necessary to pass its resolu-
 tions.
 In the face of growing
 popular sentiment for inde-
 pendence, Prime Minister Azhari
 has tended to modify his posi-
 tion on union with Egypt.   In
 a conversation with the American
 liaison officer in Khartoum on
 5 March, Azhari stated that in
 view of the overwhelming senti-
 ment for independence, his
 government has given up any idea
 of a formal union with Egypt.
 He indicated, however, that an
 advisory council to discuss
 matters of mutual concern, such
 as the Nile waters and foreign
 affairs, was desirable.
 The Khartoum radio an-
 nounced on 31 March that the
 parliamentary group of the
 National Unionist Party had
 decided that the future link
 with Egypt should not affect
 Sudanese "independence and
 full sovereignty."
 Such a limited form of
 "union" is unlikely to satisfy
 Cairo's ambitions, and if Az -
 hari continues his apparent
 drift in favor of Sudanese in-
 dependence, Cairo may attempt
 to bring about the fall of his
 government.
 In that case, the pro-
 independence Umma Party and
 the Ansar sect, unalterably op-
 posed to Egyptian domination,
 may resort to civil disorders
 to prevent union.  The with-
 drawal of British and Egyptian
 military forces from the Sudan,
 to be accomplished three months
 after adoption of a resolution
 providing for self-determina-
 tion, could be the signal for
 an outbreak of civil strife.

 YUGOSLAV TRADE WITH THE SOVIET BLOC
 An agreement signed by
 Yugoslavia and Rumania on 24
 March brings Yugoslav trade
 with the Soviet bloc to a sched-
 uled annual total of $45,500,-
 000 each way.  This is approxi-
 mately 15 percent of Yugoslava's
 total foreign trade.
 The agreement is the sixth
 on the government level which
 Yugoslavia has signed with a
 member of the Soviet bloc since
 5 January, when the preliminary
 "unofficial" Yugoslav-Soviet
 trade agreement was succeeded
 by a formal one.
 With East Germany, Yugo-
 slavia has only an "unofficial"
 agreement calling for the small-
 scale trade of $2,000,000 each
 way.  The agreement was signed
 in August 1954 to be valid un-
 til 30 June 1955.  Belgrade
 has no trade agreement with
 Albania, and no trade has yet
 been reported between Yugoslavia
 and Communist China.
 In general, in its trade
 with the Soviet bloc, Yugoslavia
 will export agricultural prod-
 ucts and ores in return for oil
 from the USSR and Rumania, coal

 Despite Belgrade's conten-
 tion that trade with the Orbit
 will not lower the level of its
 trade with the West, its tight
 foreign exchange position is
 likely to encourage the govern-
 ment to save Western currency
 by cutting imports from the
 West of commodities readily
 available from the Soviet bloc.
 The American embassy in
 Belgrade has stated that the
 Czech-Yugoslav agreement, if
 fulfilled, would put Czechoslo-
 vakia in competition with West
 Germany and Italy as a supplier
 of machinery and steel.
 Ease of payments, coupled
 with geographic proximity, could
 foster a gradual expansion of
 trade with the Soviet bloc to
 one quarter of Yugoslovia's
 total foreign trade, the level
 of Yugoslav prewar trade with
 that region.  This per'entage
 would, however, still `be well
 below the volume of 1945-1948,
 when Yugoslav-Soviet bloc trade
 reached a peak of more than 50
 percent.
 The level which this trade
 eventually reaches will depend
 in large part on the ability
 and willingness of bloc coun-
 tries to implement the existing
 agreements.   Evidence available
 on the "unofficial" agreements
 of 1954 shows that the Satel-
 lites did not consistently ful-
 fill their export commitments
 to Yugoslavia.
 The current agreements do
 not suggest that Belgrade is
 becoming largely dependent on
 the bloc for vital commodities,
 except possibly petroleum prod-
 ucts.  Approximately 40 percent
 of Yugoslavia's annual POL re-
 quirements---nearly 200,000 tons
 of oil and gasoline--is to be
 imported from the USSR and
 Rumania.
 While there is no evidence
 of outright breaches of Western
 strategic trade controls, by
 which Yugoslavia abides in gen-
 eral,.the Yugoslav export lists
 do contain some questionable
 items.  Supplies scheduled for
 Rumania, for example, include
 rolled wire of unspecified ma-
 terial, and American officials
 have brought to Belgrade's at-
 tention the fact that its agree-
 ment to refine Bulgarian blister
 copper may constitute a viola-
 tion of the Battle Act.
