 CHINA'S PROSPECTING TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES

 Industry), published by the Asia News Service, Tokyo, No. 71, 1 July
 1966, pages 1-6.
 Advances in Aerial Surveying
 It is well known that China is a country of vast size, varied
 geography and topography, and a complex variety of minerals and geo-
 logical conditions.  Since the liberation, geological investigation
 has continued on a large scale, and prospecting methods and techniques
 based on geophysics and geochemistry have now been generally adopted.
 Systematic aerial magnetic measurements have been carried out over the
 entire country in order to obtain basic geophysical data.
 Significant aerial prospecting activity began in 1953 and al-
 ready measurements have been made of five million square kilometers,
 or almost half the area of China.  Although China was reputedly poor in
 petroleum, with the discovery of the Ta-ch'ing oil fields through aerial
 prospecting methods, China became self-sufficient at one swoop.  Since
 aerial prospecting is done with magnetic measurements, radioactivity
 measurements and other geophysical exploration methods from aircraft,
 underground ores are prospected for with very sensitive measuring instru-
 ments.  Compared to ground prospecting, aerial prospecting has many ad-
 vantages, and it goes without saying that aerial prospecting has demon-
 strated great effectiveness in mountainous and desert areas where ground
 prospecting is bent with difficulties.  Considering the small expense,
 the efficiency of aerial prospecting is very high, and requires little
 time.  That is because it is possible to ascertain easily the ore dis-
 tribution over a broad area and provide an over-all basis for planned
 exploitation.  The amount of measurement work done in one year by one
 aircraft is equivalent to the total of that of thirty ground measure-
 ment teams.

 After the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1958, because
 of the rise in national demands on the ore resources, China's aerial
 prospecting strength has been expanded.  On the evidence of several years'
 records, the technological level has also rise quite a bit.  In order to
 rapidly discover underground ores, aerial measurement personnel are di-
 vided in two groups, one in the air and one on the ground.                     When the ex-
 pected situation is discovered by aerial measurements, it is immediately
 investigated by ,ground personnel, and if the results are favorable, geo-
 logical studies are made.  Under this method, it often takes no more than
 a few months from the beginning of aerial measurements until boring, and
 in the case of one large iron ore deposit, it is said to have taken no
 more than two months from the start of aerial measurement to the ascer-
 taining of its value.
 The greatest problem in aerial exploration is the guiding of the
 aircraft's flight, but even here remarkable progress has been made in
 these few years.  At first, the method of setting up markers on the ground
 was used.  This meant laying out a straight line on the ground by theo-
 dolite and putting up a large flag marker every kilometer.  Since mea-
 surements are fast in aerial exploration, it was necessary for the peo-
 ple and cars which set up the signals to do so before the flight, which
 meant a loss of manpower and time.  It is obvious that this method would
 not adequately answer the needs as aerial exploration came to be used
 more and more.  For several years radio-fix and derivational apparatus
 were tested and are now in actual use.  The machine could find its own
 position accurately based on radio signals received over any area and
 adjust the course.  By using this new technique, measurement results
 and geographical location were more accurately related.  The laborious
 work of the ground crews was eliminated, and more rapid measurement was
 made possible.
 Construction of Latest Magnetometer
 With the development of geological research activity, a more ac-
 curate measuring device was required for prospecting--particularly for
 aerial magnetic exploration--and China had great success here also.  The
 young professors of Changchun Geogogical Science Academy's Physical
 Prospecting Devices Laboratory had repeated successes from 1958 to the
 present with aerial core-driven magnetometers, semi-conducting core-
 driven magnetometers, and pump magnetometers in research and tests.                       The
 first two magnetometers are already in production, and the fact that
 these devices have appeared is very noteworthy in that it puts an end to
 the backward situation in China, where, up to now, high-accuracy magne-
 tometers were imported from abroad.
 The professors and students of the Changchun Academy of Geology,
 Department of Physical Prospecting discovered that several area of China
 are magnetically weak and cannot be measured without a high-accuracy
 magnetometer, and they began study and trial manufacture of three types
 of magnetometers in 1958.  At that time aerial saturation-type magneto-
 meters imported from abroad were used in China, and the supply of these
 from the Soviet Union was cut off when relations worsened.

 Many difficulties were encountered in trial manufacturer but in
 the spirit of working out one's problems by one's own power, these were
 overcome.     In the study of the aerial core-driven magnetometer, the re-
 cording device, which is the point of this measuring instrument, consists
 of either conduction-typewriter types or punched-c rd types in those used
 abroad, but as many deficiencies are found in the conduction-typewriter
 type, an electric numeral substitution recorder was designed.  The pro-
 blem of automation was resolved, and after a year's efforts, success
 was obtained with the core-driven magnetometer and the semi-conducor
 core-driven magnetometer.
 Research and trial manufacture of the pump magnetometer was an
 even more important task.  These measurement devices are made in several
 countries abroad, but technical data were unavailable.  They had had
 no contact with pump technology.  On the detection head of this meter
 there are four large points, three of which were designed and manu-
 factured by the Chinese themselves.  By dint of great effort and study
 and after more than one thousand experiments in fifty odd days, they
 finally succeeded in making the fourth part--an infra-red polarizer.
 This trial manufacture and research were successfully completed with
 four months of the first plan due to their efforts.
 The Physical Prospecting Instruments Training and Research Com-
 mittee obtained a great deal of assistance from everywhere in the study
 and trial manufacture of this meter.  More than forty research organiza-
 tions, schools and factories worked for the birth of this meter.  Within
 the school the abilities of a large variety of professors and student
 teams were called upon.
 Approximately forty professors and students participated in re-
 search and designing of the aerial core-driven magnetometer, and based
 on the requirements for the parts and the general design of the meter,
 various methods were sought out.  After the successful completion of
 the general design, the various concrete problems in parts and parts
 manufacturing were gradually resolved by means of mass discussions.
 In the design of the auto recording device, seven types were proposed
 after an analysis of the recording devices of physical prospecting
 instruments and medical instruments.  When comparative studies were
 made on these seven plans, there were a number of developments and the
 .electric recording method emerged, signifying a breakthrough in tech-
 nological obstacles in meter design.
 In the course of the research and testing, the Physical Pros-
 pecting Instruments Training and Research Committee fostered the deve-
 lopment of men of talent.  At first there was a scientific group com-
 posed of five young professors in the Committee which was weak, with an
 average age of less than twenty-four, but now the number of professors
 on the Committee is sixteen, all of whom have attained a command of
 UHF, high vacuum, infrared and pump techniques and acquired quite com-
 plete experience in the construction of magnetometers.
 Research on Prospecting and Geological Facilities

 instruments for use in prospecting, but the latest report of facilities
 for prospecting and geological investigation must include the double-
 beam autorecording infrared spectrophotometer successfully tested re-
 cently by the Peking Scientific Instrument Factory.  This infrared spec-
 trophotometer is an extremely high precision meter applying the prin-
 ciples of optics, precision mechanics, and electronic engineering, and
 which uses the infrared absorptivity of the material to determine the
 composition and nature of a substance, measure its purity, and make a
 qualitative and quantitative analysis of its elements and compounds.
 This method of analysis is very fast compared to usual chemical analysis
 methods, is very sensitive, and has the strong point of allowing analysis
 to be conducted when the sample is very small and without breaking the
 external form of the sample.  Thus it has broad applications in indus-
 trial and scientific research fields--in petroleum, synthetic rubber
 and textiles, prospecting, pharmacentics, etc.  The Peking Scientific
 Instrument Factory, under poor technical conditions and with rough
 facilities, carried on the success of the scientific research of related
 units of the Academy of Sciences of China, and with the assistance of
 more than ten factories. it went on to manufacture special facilities
 and instruments, and subsequently suceeded in trial-manufacture of a
 spectrophotometer in only a little over four months' time.
 Furthermore, the Nanking Earth Measurement Instrument Factory
 is mass-producing earth measuring instruments, which are important and
 necessary not only in geological exploration, but also in soil improve-
 ment, water-conservancy construction, etc.  At present, the number of
 earth measurement devices supplied by the Nanking Earth Measurement
 Instruments Factory number more than forty, and these can produce re-
 liable data on soil, temperature, humidity, viscosity penetration and
 saturation power, etc.  The soil hardness meter recently successfully
 tested by this factory is simple in construction, small in size and
 only 6.3 kg in total weight.  This meter is capable of automatic re-
 cording and is designed for multiple point recording.  When using it,
 by turning the meter handle, a metal drill is put 200 mm into the earth
 and the data on soil hardness are automatically recorded on recording
 paper.  Eighty hardness coefficients can be recorded before changing
 the paper.
 Studies on the Geological Age of Granite in South China
 Even on the basis of the above fragmentary reports, it can be
 seen that in the decade or so since the liberation prospecting techna-
 logy has made great strides forward in China.  In fact, great dis-
 coveries have been made which provide now knowledge and stimulate the
 advance of prospecting activity.  The most characteristic discoveries
 have been made in research by professors and students of Nanking Uni-
 versity's Department of Granite Geology on the geological period of
 granite in the South China area.
 Granite is widely distributed in South China area, particularly
 in the provinces of the Southeast.  It occupies roughly one quarter of

 Approved For Release 2003/12/19 : CIA-RDP78-04546A003200020005-2
 the total area.  Over the past forty years this granite has generally
 come to be regarded as having been formed in the geological age called
 the Yen-shan period, more than one hundred million years ago.  With the
 large-scale advances of measurement and general geological investigations
 since the liberation, the following problems have been frequently en-
 countered.  In some granite there is ore and in some granite,                            there
 is none; in some granite there is one kind of ore and in other granite,
 there is another kind of ore.  If all the granite was formed in the
 same period, why are these differences produced?
 The professors and students of the Department of Geology of Nanldrg
 University did not blindly accept the conclusions of their predecessors,
 but on a basis of respect for the results of their predecessors' studies
 they began field investigations and initiated research on the problem
 of why theory and evidence were somewhat contradictory.  In the fall of
 1957 Professor Hsu K'o-ch'in (1776 0344 0530) Department of Geology
 led a number of students in discovering granite from the Caledonian
 period, approximately 200 million years earlier than the Yen-shan period,
 with exact proof from geological boring in southern Kiangsi Province.
 They attached very great significance to this discovery and they decided
 to take up the topic very seriously and continue their research in depth.
 After 1958 the number of individuals participating in the research was
 more than eighty professors from six training and research committees
 and more than one hundred advanced students.  They made comprehensive
 studies of the granite of the South China area from the fields of local
 geology, structural geology, petrology, mineralogy, geochemistry, ore
 deposits and isotope geology.
 Over a period of eight years they have made geological measure-
 ments of an area of approximately 50,000 square kilometers where granite
 is concentrated, and have observed more than two hundred granite bodies,
 studied them, and collected several tens of tons of granite and ore
 samples. In the laboratory they have performed a large number of analy-
 ses, evaluations and experiments.  Chromatography was carried out more
 than eight thousand times for a large number of the granite samples col-
 lected, and more than six thousand thin sections of granite were evalua-
 ted.  Furthermore, for a large number of rock specimens, various precise
 analysis and determination of absolute age. From a large quantity of
 scientific data a series of important principles were found.
 The professors and students arrived at the following conclusions
 through repeated study and investigation of evidence over a period of
 eight years. The granite of the South China region is not of a single
 age but belongs to four geological periods.  These four periods are:
 Hsueh-teng      ca.  600-800 million years ago
 Caledonian      ca.  380-480 million years ago
 Indonesian      ca.  180-230 million years ago
 Yen-shan              90-230 million years ago
 It is also clear that within the same period some granite is earlier
 and some later.
 Rough relationships were found between the granite of each era
 and the ore deposits therein.  For example, gold ore is associated

 primarily with the hsueh-feng and Caledonian eras, and tin is associated
 chiefly with the Indonesian and Yen-shan periods, while tungsten is re-
 lated with granite of the Yen-shan era, some particularly with the late
 Yen-shan period.
 Furthermore, referring to material related to the era of produc-
 tion, the regularity of geographical distribution of granite in dif-
 ferent periods is related with local geography.  According to this
 principle, it became possible to predict what types of ore should be
 found in any given locality, and comparatively effective prospecting
 was carried out in certain areas in connection with other geological
 conditions.  Thus a great deal of the hit-and-miss factor in mining
 exploration has been eliminated.
 Furthermore, based on the characteristics of history and local
 geology of granite formation in the south China area, a new concept of
 the nature of the land structure of the South China area emerged, and
 elementary investigation has been carried out on theoretical problems
 of the relationship of. geological structure and the formation of dif-
 ferent types of ores granites.  This is thought to be something which
 will provide still more advantages in the development of geological
 theory and guidance of prospecting activity.

 PRODUCTION OF PRECISION SCALES IN CHINA
 One-ten millionth of one Gram Super Precision Scales
 Peoe:ntly China has been achieving considerable success in producing
 precision scales, which are thus far manufactured in only a few countries
 of the world.    The most noteworthy one among them is the vacuum-quartz
 small-quantity heat scales, whose production, in small numbers, was begun
 this year at the Shenyang City Glass Laboratory.  It is a super-precision
 balance which has a minimum sensitivity of one-ten millionth of one gram.
 Test production of these scales was achieved by the Metal Laboratory of
 the Chinese Academy of Science, and the Shenyang City Glass;began their
 manufacture.
 In a scientific laboratory test, the variation of mass must be observed
 often under the condition of vacuum and/or of high heat.  Such variation
 is extremely small and is difficult to measure without the help of a highly
 elaborate balance.  The precision small-quantity scales hitherto produced
 by China had had a minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram.
 Although -t;his balance was so elaborate as to weigh even a piece of cotton
 fiber or an ink spot on a piece of paper, it was unable to meet neces-
 sities adequately.
 The smallest weight used for the newly-produced quartz small-quantity
 heat balance, which has a minimum sensitivity of one-ten millionth of one
 gram, weighs 0.01 mg. and is finer than human down; and during the opera-
 tion it could be blown away unless the operator stops his breath.  This
 balance is composed of three parts, namely, vacuum, heat, and balance.
 The parts of the balance are set in the vacuum system, are resistent to
 high temperature and corrosion, and are made of quartz glass which has a
 very small factor of expansion.  The balance can measure metal or high
 temperature test material which is heated to 1,000 degrees centigrade,
 and the sensitivity and accuracy of the balance are not at all affected
 even by carbondioxide or steam.
 One-millionth of one Gram Precision Scales
 Produced by the Peking Optical Instrument Manufactory
 Although the above points out an epochmaking achievement in the
 recent meter industry in China, the precision small-quantity scales with
 minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram are produced at the
 Peking Optical Instrument Manufactory and the Shanghai Scales Manufactory.
 According to the Jenmin Chipao of January 24, 1966, the Peking Optical
 Instrument Manufactory succeeded prior to this spring (January of the lunar
 calendar) [sic] in the test production of high-precision balance which has
 a maximum weighing capacity of 20 grams.  According to the report, the
 production of this high-precision balance was said to have been possible
 only after the ideological struggle of whether or not to tackle the heavy
 burden of revolution and achieve a high technological standard.  Half a

 year prior to this, the National Meter Bureau requested this factory to
 present a test product of a super high-precision scales.  Then there were
 a variety of opinions:  some supported the request; some were skeptical
 about its success; others argued that such a high-precision balance was
 produced only in a few countries of the world and that their factory was
 not equipped with the necessary means to produce such scales; and still
 others maintained that the precision scales hitherto produced in China
 reached barely the third-class standard, and a high technological standard
 should be achieved step by step; hence second- and the first-class test
 products should precede the super-class test product.  However, it is said
 that meanwhile a movement to study the thought of Mao Tse-tung was launched
 and the spirit to overcome difficulties to produce this super-class pre-
 cision balance was generated.  Thus the key engineers began to review the
 up-to-date experiences of the test production of precision small-quantity
 scales; and by making the best use of the valuable results of experiences,
 they finally succeeded in designing a 'blueprint for the high-precision
 balance.  The craftsmen are reported to have succeeded after a series of
 trials in the test production of all the 400-odd parts needed to make a
 high-precision balance in approximately half a year.
 One-millionth of one Gram Scales Produced by the
 Shanghai Scales Manufactory
 According to a telegram dispatahec. by the New China [News] Agency
 from Shangtai on October 17, 1965, the Shanghai Scales Manufactory also
 succeeded in producing a precision small-quantity balance which has a
 minimum sensitivity of one-millionth of one gram and a maximum weighing
 capacity of 2 grams.
 The weight used for this precision small-quantity scales is smaller
 than a grain of white confectioners' sugar crystal and can be blown away
 even by a single careless breath.  The balance has a very keen sensitivity,
 and when i  is approached by a hand, it is able to sense even so slight
 a variation of weight as is caused by the body temperature of man.  Con-
 sequently, the balance is kept in a controlled-temperature room with a
 separator attached outside.  Both the materials to be weighed and the
 weights to be used are carried in through two "windows" by the revolving
 pan of the scales.  The windows are always closed and the switch is con-
 trolled completely from the outside.  This precision balance is used by
 a national meter certification authority for the measurement of standard
 weight; apart from this, it is necessary for the laboratories and test
 rooms of scientific research organizaticns, universities, and professional
 schools when they measure the mass of a matter.
 The Shanghai Scales Manufactory which produced this balance also
 manufactured in 1960 a small-quantity balance which was capable of weighing
 one-two hundred thousandth of one gram.  Subsequently, in early 1963, it
 received a mission for test production of one-millionth of one gram pre-
 cision small-quantity balance and succeeded in its test production in late
 1964.  According to the above mentioned source, in foreign countries, copper

 and aluminium are used for the beam of a precision balance, but the engin-
 eers of the factory have made the beam using a more ideal material.  This
 material is said to be relatively light and to have a high degree of mech-
 anical proof, and the effect of heat upon this material to be relatively
 small.    lie manufacture has a margin of error of about one graduation (one-
 millionth of one gram), and this index is a considerably advanced one even
 by intern.atjonal standards.
 In the course of the test production, both the engineers and the workers
 made great efforts to overcome the difficulties associated with revisional
 test.  The test, of course, must be ccnduoted in a controlled-temperature
 room, whose temperature must be fairly hi;h.  Since there was no temperature-
 control facility in the factory, they built a simple such facility through
 their own efforts.  As a result of their experiments, they also discovered
 a comprehensive method of testing a precision small-quantity scales, and
 thus prepared the necessary condition for the formal production of this
 manufacture henceforth.
 Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory and Shenyang
 Teko Scales Manufactory
 Amon_.; other factories which have been promoting the production of high
 precision scales are Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory and Shenyang Take
 Scales Manufactory.
 Early last year the Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory manufactured
 three kinds of high precision standard scales with a large weighing capacity,
 each having a load capacity of 1 kg, 5 kg, and 20 kg.  These standard scales
 are the precision gauges necessary for the mining industry, scientific
 research organizations, and the laboratories of universities and profes-
 sional schools; their respective graduation units are 0.5 mg, 2.5 mg., and
 10 mg; and each of them has the precision of one-two millionth of its full
 scale.  For example, when a 1 kg material is weighed by the 1 kg scales,
 even the additional weight of 1.6 cm-long hair is immediately indicated on
 the scales.
 It is the Teko Scales Manufactory of the Shenyang City which succeeded
 in producing China's first second-class 5 kg balance and first-class 1 kg
 balance, having been enlightened by Shanghai Linung Scales Manufactory
 which is a sister factory of the former.  Although the Shenyang factory is
 one of the factories in China which started to produce scales relatively
 early, it could, until 1965, produce only fifth-class scales of compara-
 tively low accuracy.  Hence early last year, on the occasion of reviewing
 the perfo:smanee of the factory, various questions were raised and answers
 were sought on its inability to produce high-precision scales above the
 fourth class.
 Tzaditionally, the scales produced by this factory were an imitation
 of foreign products; and because of their complicated structure, much
 material was wasted and not only was the cost of production high, but also
 the quality of the products was relatively inferior.  Within the last few
 years, the factory carried out a number of improvements, yet was unable
 to achieve a significant breakthrough.  Some people thought that it was no

 mistake to imitate foreigners because the latter had several decades of
 experience in scales production, ?rhereas they themselves were still young,
 inexperienced, and lacked in expertise and suitable facilities.  Against
 such spiritual state, however, the factory branch of the Chinese Communist
 Party organized the employees of the factory so that they should learn the
 relevant writings of Chairman Mao; and thus by liberating their thoughts
 and elevating their recognition, it succeeded in producing, with a single
 leap a fourth-class 5 kg balance.  Then some leading members of its
 mana?"emeYLt who were satisfied at this result, took a strong pride in their
 achievement.
 Before long, however, a group of the "union of the three" -- the
 leading members of management headed by the vice chief of the factory,
 Chang Chime-Fu, technicians, and laborers -- visited Shanghai Linung
 Scales Manufactory, which had been a long-time competitor of the Shenyang
 Teko Scales Manufactory, for an observational study.  They were very sur-
 prised al: learning that the Shanghai factory was producing third-class
 5 kg scales.  Upon returning to their factory, they rallied all their vigor
 in order to produce second and first-class scales by leaping over the bar-
 riers of producing third-class scales, and commenced the engineering and
 test-production activities for second-class 5 kg and first-class 1 kg
 scales, organizing a small team of the "union of the three" for the test
 production of new manufactures.  Owir4, to the herioc ambition of the
 employees to overtake and bypass the advanced plants and to their clear
 understanding of the significance of catching up at a bound even the seem-
 ingly insolvable problems confronted in the course of engineering and test
 production were smoothly solved and the two kinds of high-precision scales,
 which until then China had never been able to produce, and which were
 urgently needed for scientific research organizations and the department
 of weights and measures, were produced in only three months.
