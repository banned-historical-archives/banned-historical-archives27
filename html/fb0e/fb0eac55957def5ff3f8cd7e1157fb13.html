 THE ORIENT
 Sir;
 Thanks for your article in the
 October issue on how Malaya is
 turning bad characters into good
 citizens ...  As  a  staunch  be-
 liever in democracy, it is, indeed,
 encouraging to know that justice
 is not denied those who go astray
 ... Undoubtedly,  many   innocent
 persons because of their associa-
 tions, direct and indirect, become
 branded for life as undesireables
 and are never given a chance to
 prove their good citizenship ...
 The example set by Malaya should
 be followed by other states...
 S. K. LEE

 Sir;
 ...International   Burlesque is
 the most disgusting movie I have
 ever seen screened in Hong Kong
 .I understand that after being
 shown for a few days, the authori-
 ties concerned re-censored it, but
 in its re-censored form, it is still
 a  disgusting  film ...It  should
 never have  been  allowed to be
 shown in the Colony.. .and I am
 shocked by the fact that one of
 the leading cinema houses deemed
 it a fit film to be   screened...
 Strangely, in the correspondence
 columns of the daily newspapers
 there was no comment not even
 from  any of  the local Catholic
 bodies... The Reform  Club  of
 Hong Kong and the Chinese Re-
 form Association were also silent
 ... Maybe I cannot appreciate art.
 K. L. LI

 Sir;
 Allow me , to congratulate you
 on all the interesting and informa-
 tive articles... Would it be pos-
 sible ... whenever   any   Chinese
 names ... are  quoted ... to insert
 the Chinese characters...
 In "Mirror of Opinion" readers
 are no doubt presented with a
 pageant of views of others. What
 about the views of The Orient?...

 Sir;
 ..glad to see the appearance
 of The Orient.  . is a timely and
 well-edited publication...,
 The summary of events in the
 Far East is excellent, but most
 welcome of all to overseas Chinese
 nationals  are  the  articles  on
 Chinese drama and Chinese civi-
 lisation ... Many of us have never
 been back to our homeland and
 the articles mentioned are indeed
 an education to us about our own
 country...
 . hope you will give us more
 information about China, ancient
 and modern and also of other
 Asiatic nat'ons...By  doing  so,
 your magazine would contribute
 considerably to the unification of
 Asiatic - states and mutual under-
 standing...

 Sir;
 May I ask  how  is  the
 US$5.000,000,000-plan. to raise
 the living standards of the masses
 going to help combat the spread
 of Communism in the East?  So
 much is for technical ass'stance,
 so much is for economic develop-
 ment, but nothing has been men-
 tioned  of  social  welfare                                                                                                and
 education-the two most pressing
 and most important problems of
 today ...
 In Asia today, the  potential
 supporters of   Communism -
 those who have nothing to lose or
 to ga'n under the heels of the
 Kremlin - overwhelmingly out-
 number those who have their roots
 in democracy.
 By all means let us have tech-
 nical aid and help for economic
 development.  Asia is badly in
 need  of  such  assistance. But
 what immediate results can such
 help achieve in the fight aganst
 the spread of Communism?  Un-
 doubtedly, in the long run it will
 achieve what is desired.  But in
 the East today, there is immediate
 need for. short range as well as
 long range plans to defeat Com-
 munism.
 Leaders in Asia should give
 more attention than they have in
 the past to the masses-the work-
 ers                                                                                                who  toil  but  reap barely
 enough to make ends meet, and
 have, nothing . to spare for, setting

 aside for a rainy day.  While pro-
 viding technical and economic as-
 sistance, there should at the same
 time be carried out schemes that
 will make the masses fully appre-
 ciate what their lot would be un-
 der Communist rule ...
 In the East today  there still
 many industrialists and employers
 of  labour  whose  treatment  of
 their employees contributes to the
 .spread of Communism... Govern-
 ments in Asia should give this
 -deep study and introduce laws to
 promote extensive social welfare
 schemes with the co-operation of
 employers  of -labour throughout
 Asia...

 Sir;
 ?if you plarr- to make book
 reviews a regular feature in your
 excellent magazine, may I suggest
 that  you  engage a 'less biased
 reviewer ... the  review  of  Jack
 Belden's China Shakes the World
 to my mind is just a superficial
 condensation of certain portions
 of the book... It is unfair both to
 the reading public and the author
 of the  book ...It falls  in  the
 Communist propaganda category...
 LOCAL BOY
 Jordan Road,

 Sir;
 .I was shocked by the in-
 clusion                 in  your good, readable
 publication (October  issue)  of
 that review of Jack Belden's China
 Shakes the World.  There is only
 one place for such reviews and
 such books ? and that is the waste-
 paper basket... The review i$ a
 very poor, amateur effort; and
 worst of all it is biased-com-
 pletely, in favour of Jack Belden's
 grossly exaggerated fairy tales..
 Your reviewer must surely have
 been aware that China Shakes the
 World has been discredited in the
 United States by some of the lead-
 ing                 world  experts on  Chinese
 affairs and China generally... No
 doubt some of the events describ-
 ed.in the book are?authentic but
 they'.bave been, overshadowed by
 the imagination of the-author...

 I am by no means a supporter
 of Chiang Kai-shek's regime-in
 fact I am all in, favour of writing

 but I cannot stand injustice, no
 matter  what  political  party  or
 what type of person is involved...

 Nathan Road,  .
 Kowloon.
 Sir;
 ...I read your magazine with a
 great deal of interest, because it
 is informative and instructive...
 I enjoyed most in it was its im-
 partiality... it seemed to me that
 your review of Jack Belden's new
 book China  Shakes the  World,
 showed  the reviewer's  bias in
 favour  of  the  Chinese  Com-
 munists.
 Mr. da Cruz selected passages
 in the book which showed' Mr.
 Belden at his worst, and also went
 out of his way to criticise the
 United States.  Since reading the
 review  I  have  bought  "China
 Shakes the World," and I admit
 that the review is a fine piece of
 summary.
 ... reviewers are permitted to
 air their own opinions ... Mr. da
 Cruz in his final passages about
 the United States quoted himself
 and  not  Mr.  Belden.   Mr.  da
 Cruz's article piqued my curiosity
 to such an extent that I had to
 buy the book in question.     Re-
 views are always justified, I think,
 when they produce this reaction
 .looking forward to further re-
 views...

 HEALTHIEST YEAR
 HEALTHIEST
 FOR, MALAYA
 Last year was the healthiest on
 record in Malaya,  according to
 Dr. R. B. MacGregor, Director of
 Medical  Services in the Federa-
 tion                                                                                         of Malaya, in his annual
 report.
 The  death  rate   at  14.2  per
 thousand was lower than ever be-
 fore as was the rate of infant
 mortality which showed 81 deaths
 in every 1,000 births.
 The birth rate itself remained
 high-43.8 per 1,000-and there
 was a record number of births.
 Dr. MacGregor analysed in his
 Report the reason for the con-
 siderable improvement in the in-
 fantile mortality rates.  This im-
 provement extended to all races,
 with the rate for Malaya dropping
 below the 100 mark for the first
 time.
 He stated that the reduction in
 the incidence of malaria and im-
 provements in nutrition resulting
 from a better balanced diet for
 mothers were likely to  be the
 most important factors. But un-
 doubtedly the greatest contribut-
 ing cause, he added, was the rais-
 ing of the standard of mother-
 craft  because  of  the                                                                                               teaching
 given by public health nurses at
 welfare centres and in homes all
 over the Federation.
 The Report said that among
 developments of special interest
 during the year were the success-
 ful ? results obtained in the treat-
 ment                                                                                         of typhoid  fever  with
 chloramphenicol and aureomycin.
 NO-.NONSENSE FROM
 MEN ANYMORE
 For   centuries . women have
 tolerated the behaviour of men,
 but "no more will we tolerate it,"
 declared Mrs. Shirin Fozdar, Pre-
 sident of the Women's Progres-
 sive Group in India, when she
 addressed Singapore Rotarians.
 Mrs. Fozdar spoke on "the new
 world order" which she said was
 originated.  by . Bahaullah, A he
 founder of the Bahai faith.
 World progress, she said, de
 pended upon the "complete libera-
 tion" of women.
 Under the. Bahai  New World
 Order, there will be no customg,
 no tariffs and no passports.

 RED SONG BOOKS
 (Straits Times, Singapore)
 Lately a close watch has been
 kept   on                                            printed  matter  coming
 into Singapore from China, and a
 variety of Communist publications
 have been banned.  In reporting
 these activities the Straits Times
 thinks that it is doing its civic
 duty, but it got quite  a  shock
 when it received the following let-
 ter from a reader in Bugis Street:
 "Reference to the Straits Times
 of today's date  (September 9),
 Page 7 Column Two, `19     Song.-
 Books Banned', could you please
 inform me what are the names of
 the 19 Song-Books and where I
 may be able to.see them".
 Like the fig leaves which Adam
 and Eve donned to cover their
 primal nakedness,-the veil dropped
 by the Special Branch over -these
 song-books has merely had the
 effect of arousing curiosity where
 there was none before, at least in
 this youngster's case  (for we as-
 sume that he is a youngster). He
 evidently doesn't realise that he
 is asking rather a lot.
 However,  it is good to know
 that in times when the producers
 of  these  song-books  are  doing
 their best to poison the minds of
 youth, it is still possible to find a
 youngster as innocent as the one
 who wrote this naive letter.
 There is one thing the  Com-
 munist Party of Ceylon provides
 in unfailing               abundance-amuse-
 ment for the masses.
 Jaded citizens who weary of the
 histrionics   at   the   Maradana
 theatres  and              extravanganzas at
 the cinemas, occasionally attend
 Communist Party meetings and
 get, free of charge, exhibitions of
 blood and thunder.
 Grown men shrieking death and
 damnation to all and sundry are
 funny in a way that they them-
 selves cannot understand.
 Now it seems the damned are
 not merely those outside-the Com-
 munist Party.  A group of mem-
 bers have been labelled "American
 spies"  and put  outside the red
 pale.   We may look forward to
 livid denunciations of these fallen
 tovarich,  in the grand  Russian
 manner.
 Hatred is a speciality of the
 Communist Party and they take it
 to such lengths that they hate
 leftists more than capitalists, and
 their "reformist" comrades more
 than anybody else.
 The public would welcome more
 information  on  what particular
 brand of spying the pro-Americans
 in the Communist Party have been
 up to.  Have  they  been  seen
 wearing zoot  suits in Bambala-
 pitiya, and passing on news of the
 proletariat to the synthetic Yanks
 of the eating houses?
 Have they been seen in whis-
 pered conversation with officials at
 the library of the American Em-
 bassy?  Have they been _ noticed
 by Communist Party spies, laugh-
 ing                                                                                              at the  antics  of  American
 slapstickers like Abbott   and
 Costello?  We do not know.
 All this spy talk is great fun.
 It reminds us of the days we play-
 ed spy games ourselves.                                                                                              Readers
 will see a close resemblance to.
 their awn  childhood when they
 played games like  "hora police"
 and "I spy".
 But we must not take this huge
 joke too much at its face value.
 It has its serious side.  The Com-
 munist Party has branded some of
 its own fanatics as spies for ' a
 foreign  government,  merely'be-
 cause they, refused always to be-
 have as automatons.            .
 MARXIST HAND
 (United National Party Journal, Colombo)
 The attempted sabotage of the
 Hydro-Electric Scheme at Norton
 Bridge,  on the very eve of its
 completion, is the work of one of
 the frantic Left-Wing Parties in
 Ceylon.   Why  should'  Marxists
 want to sabotage this great' na-
 tional undertaking?  The reason
 is simple.
 The completion . of the, ;Scheme
 will mean the beginning of a new
 chapter in -the economic develop-

 ment of Ceylon.  All the efforts
 of the Government to increase the
 national wealth of this country, to
 develop cottage and light indus-
 tries which, in turn,; will raise the
 income levels of tliT people, thus
 creating a widespread rehabilita-
 tion of the peasant and the work-
 ing classes, will stand in the way
 of the concentrated efforts of all
 Marxist Parties to create discon-
 tent and disruption in the Island.
 Napoleon  said that  an army
 marched on its stomach; a revolu-
 tion springs first in the stomachs
 of men.  So far the Government
 has been energetic enough to pre-
 vent the destruction of the pro-
 cess of unloading food cargoes in
 Colombo Harbour. Attempts have
 also been made to  use  middle-
 class public servants as pawns in
 the game to paralyse the adminis-
 tration, to delay the Government's
 six-year plan and in every possible
 way to hamper the upliftment of
 the people.
 The  Marxists  appear  in  the
 guise of agitators for the improve-
 ment of living conditions of the
 people but that is only a mask.
 They are not interested' in "Re-
 formism"-that is the word they
 have for housing schemes,  etc.
 They are interested in perpetuat-
 ing bad living conditions and un-
 employment in order to drive peo-
 ple to a point when they will re-
 volt.
 The scheme at North Bridge is
 a key project which would enable
 the Government to implement the
 many schemes which it has for in-
 dustrialisation,  for the' develop-
 ment of cottage industries, for the
 manufacture of textiles, and for
 the use of electricity  in  tile-
 making, brick-making, the produc-
 tion of fertilisers and a whole host
 of planned projects which are be-
 ing held up owing to the lack of
 motive-power and fuel sources in
 Ceylon ...
 The  hand  of  the  Communist
 strikes everywhere, and no appeals
 to patriotism, decency, justice or
 truth will stay that hand.
 The military situation in Indo-
 China                             is  becoming graver than
 ever.      It is reported in the press
 that the French      authorities may
 appeal to the UN Security Council
 for assistance  in  stemming the
 tide of the Communist onslaught.
 Will the appeal be given the con-
 sideration which it should deserve?
 .TklE. ORIENT
 Indo-China  today  is  as  im-
 portant to  South East Asia as
 Korea is to North    East  Asia.
 Unless we were to engage in hair-
 splitting arguments, there should
 be little practical difference be-
 tween the invasion of the Korean
 Communists and the invasion of
 the  Vietminh  Communists.   In
 both cases the democratic people
 are being subjected to the evil
 forces of Communism.  If Korea
 deserved the defence by the UN
 forces, Indo-China should not be
 treated otherwise.
 It may be frankly pointed ? out
 that Indo-China is no longer of
 vital interest to France except
 perhaps as a reminder  of  the
 glory of yester-years. France does
 not aspire to continue as a world
 imperialist   empire,  and Indo-
 China is accordingly a relic of un-
 certain value.  But to the Anglo-
 American Powers this assortment
 of three small states may provide
 the key to South East Asian de-
 fence from the mainland.
 If it should fall into the hands
 of the Communists, it may he
 turned into a two-horned spear-
 head-one  to  Thailand,  Burma
 and  Malaya,  and  the  other to
 Hong Kong and the Philippines. It
 would be easier and cheaper to
 defend it now than to try to re-
 cover it when  future military
 necessity should so demand.
 Since the American impe-
 rialists mobilised all "their land,
 sea and air forces in the Pacific
 for the  adventurous landing at
 Inchon   on  October 1.5, it was
 obvious  that the  war in Korea
 would become a long one.
 The people  of Korea are de-
 termined to support their Army
 to the bitter end. The reply to
 the American challenge is an un-
 shakable one.
 Nevertheless, in order to pre-
 vent the aggressors from  carry-
 ing out their plot to extend the
 war in Korea, to protect peace in
 Asia and the world, and to ac-
 celerate the march of the Korean
 people to unity and independence,
 we feel that a proper way should
 be devised for the peaceful solu-
 tion of Korean situation...
 What may be specially point-
 ed out is that the solution of the
 Korean impasse must be under-
 taken with the immediate cessa-
 tion                                                                     of  hostilities,   and   the
 evacuation  of  foreign              troops
 from  that             country.   The   Ko-
 rean   Government  has  already
 made repeated appeals to  the
 Nations on this point, and China,
 the Soviet Union and other peo-
 ple's   democracies have voiced
 their support for this appeal. But
 the United Nations, controlled by
 American imperialism, seems un-
 perturbed and allows America to
 carry on  its aggression un-
 checked.
 In the second place, there must
 be held in Korea nation-wide elec-
 tions on the basis of the free will
 of the people, if an independent
 and really  united  Korea  is  to
 emerge...
 While world attention is focus-
 sed on  Korea,                                                                                                   the situation in
 Vietnam  has        suddenly grown
 tense. This    was  expected,  as
 Korea constitutes only a link in
 the Far Eastern chain of events,
 and the Communists will    spread
 fire wherever and whenever they
 feel the need and have the op-
 portunity...
 The  Vietnam  situation  is the
 product of seed  sown                        by the
 Soviet Union five years ago. With
 the past misrule of the French,
 and the inefficiency of Bao Dai,
 supplemented now by the suces-
 ses of the Chinese Communists
 on the continent,  the  Vietnam
 situation has naturally grown in
 seriousness...
 American aid to Vietnam today
 remains within the scope of mili-
 tary supplies.  This aid will not
 prove  adequate.  The  Vietnam
 situation is not the same as that
 of Korea and the French appeal
 to the United Nations for action
 appears also not practical...
 From our point of view, the
 whole situation  in  the Far East
 revolves on China, and once the
 China problem is settled, the re-
 maining problems will present no
 difficulties. Otherwise, Korea may
 be settled today, and Vietnam the
 next, but still further problems
 will arise, and the situation will
 remain basically unsettled.
 The French  are  reported  to
 have evacuated many important
 points which incidentally are on
 the   Vietnam-Chinese  borders.
 The Chinese Communists now are
 enabled to realise their plan to
 link up China and Vietnam...
 It is time for the democratic
 nations to review the Far East as
 a whole...

 It was expected; but the French
 authorities  under-estimated  the
 strength  of  the Communist-led
 Vietminh forces.   On October 6,
 Ho Chi-minh ordered a general
 offensive against  the    French.
 Since  then,  the  French 'were
 forced to give ground.   Vietminh
 guerillas demolished a water-pipe,
 20 miles North of Haiphong, and
 severed the city's regular fresh
 water source.  They also shelled
 oil installations a few miles South
 East of Saigon.  Elsewhere: they
 harrassed the French.
 Bigger operations were carried
 out near the China border by re-
 gulars                   of the Vietminh             army.
 The  French  officially  admitted
 that some 3,500 French, Foreign
 Legion  and  Moroccan      troops
 trapped near the Chinese frontier,
 were annihilated  in  a  five-day
 battle.
 The  biggest frontier fortress,
 Langson,  was captured by the
 Vietminh forces. All that remain-
 ed intact along the entire border
 with   China  were  Laokay  and
 Moncay, on    the   Western and
 Eastern ends of the French de-
 fence line.
 Hanoi  was  also. threatened.
 Outposts, North of the city, were
 abandoned in the face of Vietminh
 onslaughts.   Everywhere,  Viet-
 minh  forces  held the initiative
 while the French  withdrew    to
 shorten their defence  lines and
 appeal for more and faster Ameri-
 can military aid.                                                            French  with-
 drawals left more than 200 miles
 of frontier unguarded. If ' China
 was sending military supplies to
 the  Vietminh forces there was
 nothing the French could do to
 stop it.
 French Deny
 Because of their  serious  re-
 verses, the French were said to
 have. put out feelers for a com-
 promise with Ho Chi-mink to end
 the hostilities.  The French, how-
 ever, officially denied the report
 and described it as "fantastic".
 The United States State Depart-
 ment also refuted a report that
 the  American     Government had
 advised the  French to  come to
 terms with Ho.
 France sought US$170,000,000
 from the United States in dollars
 and arms  to  bring the French
 Army to full strength next year
 in  addition  to financial aid to
 arm 18 new battalions of Viet-
 nam                                                             troops  in  Indo-China  and
 40,000  irregulars.  The   United
 States Government  was  expect
 ed to  grant  US$2,400,000 for
 both France and Indo-China.
 The Vietnam  Premier,  Tran
 Van Huu appealed for American
 backing  to  recruit a Vietnam
 National Army of 400,000 troops
 to save  Indo-China from Com-
 munism.                                                                                                  His  appeal   was  ex--
 pected to go unheeded.

 J.N. Intervention
 Meanwhile, from  Hong Kong
 the Vietnam Renovation League
 appealed to the United Nations to
 intervene.  Headed              by   Crown
 Prince Cuong De (uncle of Bao
 Dai now in Japan), the' League
 insisted on the withdrawal of the
 French from Indo-China and sug-
 gested the sending of a United
 Nations Good Offices Commission,
 to  solve the  problems of Indo-
 China, and pave the way for com-
 plete independence of the nation.
 Communism was alien  to        the
 Vietnam people, added   the de-
 claration.                          It   was      present    in
 Vietnam   because of           French
 colonialism.
 United    Nations       forces  swept
 across the 38th Parallel, drove the
 Communist-led  North          Koreans
 Northwards,  and        occupied  the
 North  Korean  capital town of
 Pyongyang. It was believed that
 the North Korean leader, Kim 11
 Sung, and other Communist lead-
 ers who engineered and led the
 attack on South Korea on June 25
 had fled into China's Manchuria.
 The big question was will the
 United Nations forces drive up to
 the Manchurian  border in their
 pursuit of the retreating North
 Koreans.  Peking,  Moscow  and
 New  Delhi  repeatedly  warned
 against United Nations forces ad-
 vancing beyond the 38th Parallel.
 One report claimed that China
 had militarily occupied a strip of
 North Korea adjoining the Man-
 churian  frontier  to  provide                      a
 haven for the North Korean gov-
 ernment.  Such a move on the
 part of China would have   two
 main effects: 1. To provide at
 least a token fulfillment of the
 October 1 pledge by Premier Chou
 En-lai  that  Communist  China
 would   "not  stand aside" if the
 United  States invaded   North
 Korea, and 2. To thrust upon the
 United Nations-and  chiefly the
 United  States-the  decision of
 extending the invasion of North
 Korea to any territory occupied
 by the Chinese Communists.
 The  future  of  Korea  looked
 gloomy, politically. The United
 Nations Interim Committee's pro-
 posals for North Korea confined
 Syngman Rhee's   South  Korean
 Government authority to South of
 the 38th Parallel,  and  provided
 that when fully liberated, North
 Korea should come under United
 Nations control pending free elec-
 tions throughout the country to
 enact a unified government.
 The proposals, in fact, reflected
 the Committee's non-confidence in
 the capacity and ability of the
 South  Korean  Government  to
 unite the country and set up a
 single national administration.
 Premier Syngman Rhee opposed
 the idea of a new general election
 for the whole country. He said
 elections  should be confined to
 North Korea to fill the seats left
 vacant for representatives from
 areas North of the 38th Parallel.
 Later, he announced that his
 government  would  accept  any
 directives from  the United Na-
 tions.  But,                                                           he hoped  that the
 United Nations would observe and
 advise elections for North Korea
 rather than conduct them. Elec-
 tions may be held before Christ-
 mas.
 The  Philippines    Government
 started arming civilian defence f or-
 ces in an all-out campaign to wipe
 out the Communist-led Huks in the
 Republic on an
 executive order
 by President El-
 pidio Quirino.
 1i  1217  '   The President
 ' - - '          emphasised that
 the Barrangays would not con-
 stitute a citizen or civilian army
 but would be purely community
 civic organisations for the promo-
 tion of public welfare and security
 under government supervision.
 "Ideals hostile to our heritage
 of freedom have found lodgement
 in our midst, seeking to under-
 mine and destroy society and gov-
 ernment", said President Quirino.
 He added:  "The  Barangays  of
 old as organised family units best
 represented  the soldarity, co-
 operation and loyalty most needed
 to protect and preserve the free
 institutions our people have come
 to value and cherish."
 Under the President's executive
 order, each Barangay organisation
 will have a head chosen for a 12-
 month term and each organisation
 will be under the supervision of
 the city or town Mayor.  The or-
 ganisation of Barangays had pre-
 viously be strongly opposed by the
 Nacionalista Party who believed
 the idea would not work.
 The duties of the Barangays
 would  be:  1.  Post  guards  or
 send residents on patrol when the
 safety of the community requires;
 2. Prepare family registers and
 keep track of transients in the
 community;  3.  Provide for mu-
 tual protection of members and
 their families and  co-operate in
 the maintenance of peace in the
 locality;   4. Help in emergency
 relief work and organise co-opera-
 tives; and 5.                                                                                             Extend all possible
 assistance when requested by the
 military or police authorities.
 In the campaign against Com-
 munists and other subversive ele-
 mements, the Philippines authori-
 ties were also seeking  the  co-
 operation of the         Bangkok  and
 Singapore governments in the hunt
 for members of the Soviet espion-
 age system believed to be operat-
 ing in the three countries.
 One hundred and five persons,
 including the six-member general
 secretariat of the Philippines Com-
 munist Party, were being detained
 by military intelligence officers of
 the Philippines Army as a result
 of a series of raids.
 Charges of "inciting to rebel-
 lion" will be filed against the six
 members of the Communist Party
 general  secretariat.  Other  sus-
 pects were being screened to de-
 termine if they have connections
 with either the Hukbalahaps or the
 Communist Party.

 The day after Indonesia was
 admitted as the 60th member of
 the United Nations Organisation,
 the  government's armed  forces
 began   mili-
 tary                                        operations
 established in
 Amboina,  be-
 tween  the  Celebes                                 and  New
 Guinea.
 The so-called Republic's islands
 of Bra and Cerma had previously
 been occupied.   Amboina   was
 surrounded by Indonesian Army,
 Navy and Air Force units.
 The Republic of South Moluccas
 was proclaimed in April last. It
 is the only area which was still
 resisting incorporation into the In-
 donsian state.
 Replying  to  the Netherlands
 Prime Minister's cable expressing
 great  anxiety  over Indonesia's
 action,  Dr.  Mohammed Natsir,
 Indonesia's new Premier said:
 "For the protection of the peo-
 ple of Ambon in particular, and
 to secure interests of the people
 of Indonesia in general, the gov-
 ernment, to its regret, finds itself
 compelled to  take  positive mea-
 sures, but with the conviction that
 these measures will restore peace
 and freedom for the people of the
 South Moluccas islands.
 "The government has left no
 stone unturned to find a peaceful
 settlement of the South Moluccas
 problem.
 "The government expresses the
 hope that the difficulties which
 are being overcome in the South
 Moluccas will constitute the last
 of a series of difficulties which
 cannot be dissociated from the
 withdrawal of the Netherlands in-
 strument  of  power  from  In-
 donesia. .
 "The Indonesia government re-
 gards the problems it  faces in
 the South Moluccas as part of the
 difficulties which always arise in
 a period of great changes such as
 the Indonesian and Netherlands
 societies are now going through
 following  the  transfer  of so-
 vereignty.
 "A small gang of armed per-
 sons who were under the respon-
 sibility of the Netherlands gov-
 ernment after  the  transfer  of
 sovereignty continually attempts
 to resist and withdraw from the
 course  of history, now taking
 place in Indonesia."
 Halt Operations
 The United Nations Commission
 for Indonesia urged Indonesia to
 halt the operations.. Indonesia re-
 plied that it was unable to com-
 ply.  Left-wing members of the
 Indonesian  Parliament  accused
 the Dutch of meddling in internal
 Indonesia affairs  by  asking the
 United Nations to intervene.
 The self-proclaimed South Moluc-
 can Republic appealed to Austra-
 lia for support in its "struggle for
 freedom."
 The   South   Moluccan   Sec-
 retariat in Djakarta, in a message
 to the Australian Parliament on
 behalf of the "Moluccan people
 in Java," appealed to the "Aus-
 On the Double Tenth, General-
 issimo Chiang Kai-shek appealed to
 all freedom-loving Chinese to sup-
 port his government in the fight
 to regain China's independence.
 The  General--
 issimo charged
 that today the-
 Russians were
 in  control of China's  airports,
 railways  and  mines-even     the
 Chinese  Communist Party.      He
 also  charged that the   Russians
 were trying to enslave the 460,-
 000,000 Chinese people in order
 to conquer Asia and eventually
 the whole world.
 The Nationalist regime in For-
 mosa announced the smashing of
 another Communist underground
 organisation.   The Political De-
 partment said that Hung Kuo-shih,
 and more than 400 of his subor-
 dinates confessed their subversive
 underground activities.
 The Peking regime also arrest-
 ed  subversive elements.  Peking
 officially  announced'  that since
 January last     year, a total of
 28,000 persons were arrested for
 spying for the United States and
 the Nationalist Government.
 While Nationalist China man-
 aged to retain her seat in the
 United  Nations,  the  world  or-
 ganisation officially invited Peking
 to send a representative to Lake
 Success to attend the debate on
 Peking's   complaint   of   armed
 American   invasion  of Formosa.
 The  representatives,   however,.
 would not be entitled to vote.
 For the protection
 tralian  people  and  especially
 those   who  fought  with us on
 Ambonia against the Japanese to
 aid the Amboinese in their fight
 for freedom".
 Internal Affair
 The South Moluccan students
 corps  appealed  to   American
 students to send aid to Amboina.
 The       South  Moluccan Secre-
 tariat informed the United Nations
 Commission   of  the explosive
 situation . in   Amboinese army
 camps in Java.
 It said Amboinese members of
 the former Netherlands Army in
 Soerabaja  were  prepared  for
 early action unless a cease-fire
 order is proclaimed on Amboina.
 Indonesia rejected a UN appeal
 for a cease-fire, contending the
 Moluccan situation was their own
 internal affair.  They claimed the
 Moluccas as part of the Republic
 of Indonesia.
 Dead Silence
 The biggest movie attraction on
 the China mainland was "Chinese
 People's Victory". In technicolor,
 the film tells in two hours the
 story of more than 20 years of
 Chinese Communist development
 -from the  Long March to the
 days of Yenan, then the Man-
 churian war and the final series of
 victories Southward from Chang-
 chun and Mukden down to Peking,
 Tientsin  and  Shanhaikwan, on-
 ward to Tsinan, then Hsuchow,
 through   the  Hwai  River,  and
 Yangtze Crossing, down to Nan-
 king, Shanghai and finally Canton.
 Appearances of Mao Tse-tung
 on the screen brought polite and
 brief  applause.  But -there was
 dead silence when Chiang Kai-
 shek, Sun Yat-sen and Stalin ap-
 peared from time to time in the
 picture.

 Japan wants a peace treaty with
 the United States and other ?war-
 time allied nations as soon as pos-
 sible.  Chikao  Honda,                        President
 of the Mainichi
 newspapers, ex-
 plained,                                             how-
 ever,  that the
 desire for  an
 -early  peace  treaty , was  not
 motivated by any wish to get com-
 pletely rid of America. He said
 that the Japanese certainly wanted
 independence in home administra-
 tion and  freedom in                         economic
 affairs. They, however, fully ap-
 preciate                          that for security they
 must look to the United States
 .and the United Nations.
 Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshi-
 da                      believed   that    the   fast
 turning tide in Korea improved
 .Japan's  chances for   apeace
 treaty.  "We, Japanese," he said,
 "should  make   every effort pos-
 sible                 in        co-operating  with   the
 United Nations for settlement of
 the  disturbance  in    Korea.  By
 doing so, we shall for the first
 time be able to obtain a security
 guarantee for Japan.
 "This also will clarify the pro-
 spects                         of  a  peace    treaty for
 Japan.  Conditions at home     and
 abroad  indicate  that  a    peace
 treaty conference  for  Japan   is
 near."
 HONG KONG'
 It was a unique month, unpre-
 cedented in the                         history  of the
 British  Crown Colony:     China's
 National Day was commemorated
 on two differ-
 ent days. The
 non - Chinese
 communities
 who  formerly
 joined    the
 celebrations
 kept aloof; so
 also  did  the majority of   the
 Chinese population.
 Because Britain recognised the
 new People's Central Government
 of - China, the leading  Chinese
 commercial  and    industrial in-
 stitutions  and                          certain    leftist
 trade unions complied with Pe-
 king's decree  that                       China's Na-
 tional Day shall be celebrated on
 October 1, instead of October 10,
 better  known as  the     Double
 Tenth.
 As in the case last year, the
 Chinese   General  Chamber    of
 Commerce sponsored the celebra-
 tions.                         Last year, the  occasion
 was  commemorated  on    October
 10.  At that time, a squabble oc-
 curred between pro-Chiang Kai-
 shek and pro-Mao Tse-tung ele-
 ments over the flags that were to
 be hung up.  To solve the ques-
 tion,                                                     no  flags  were  displayed.
 Only a huge portrait of Dr. Sun
 Yat-sen adorned the meeting hall.
 This year, the  Chamber flew
 the red five-star alongside the
 Union Jack and  displayed two
 portraits-Mao Tse-tung and Sun
 Yat-sen. The  pro-Kuomintang
 section of the community com-
 memorated the National Day on
 October  10,  displayed Kuomin-
 tang  flags  and                                                             Sun Yat-sen's
 photos.
 Pleasant Surprise
 Hong     Kong's     two pro-Com-
 munist                                                              vernacular  dailies,  "Ta
 Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Pao"
 gave the Colony a pleasant sur-
 prise on October 1.  On the front
 pages of the special National Day
 issues,  there was   no  sign   of
 Stalin's photograph.  Apparently
 acting on a directive,   the two
 newspapers adorned    their front
 pages with the photographs of
 Mao Tse-tung and for the first
 time, that of Sun Yat-sen.
 In Chinese political circles this
 was interpreted as semi-official re-
 cognition of Sun Yat-sen as the
 founder  of  the  Chinese  Re-
 volution, not                                                              Mao  Tse-tung  as
 formerly   publicised by   the
 Chinese Communist Party. Until
 now Sun Yat-sen had always been
 left  in the background.  Both
 photographs were supplied by the
 new  government's New    China
 News Agency.
 To some Chinese it was a good
 sign-a sign of nationalism.
 Death Penalty
 Crime                               was  increasing. Two
 senior British police officers and a
 Chinese constable were shot and
 killed by armed bandits within a
 week.
 Heavy terms of imprisonment
 were of no avail.  Armed hold-
 ups big and small, continued. The
 authorities  decided on  sterner
 measures.
 The  Legislative   Council   ap-
 proved an additional Emergency,
 Regulation to cope with the situa-
 tion.  It made the death penalty
 mandatory in the case of    con-
 victions on indictment for unlaw-
 ful possession of bombs or hand-
 grenades and for unlawful use of
 arms.
 Thailand signed an agreement
 with the United States for mili-
 tary assistance to the extent of
 US$30,000,000. The United States
 undertook  to
 supply   arms
 and equipment
 j      for the armed
 land  for de-
 fence                                                                                                                     pur-
 poses.
 In return, Thailand undertook
 to provide facilities for the pur-
 chase of certain materials for the
 use of the United States. A num-
 ber of officers and technicians for
 demonstration and training pur-
 poses would also be supplied by
 the United States.
 Prime Minister Phibun  Song-
 gram said that the arms would be
 sufficient to equip nine battalions.
 In addition, 70 combat aircraft of
 all types and amphibious equip-
 ment would be provided for the
 Thai Air Force.

 One of Britain's foremost "Iron
 Curtain" broadcasters arrived in
 Malaya to conduct a psychological
 warfare   campaign  against  the
 bandits.   Mr.
 Carleton Greene,
 brother of the
 novelist, Graham
 Greene,    was
 studying the
 country and making observations
 before launching the campaign.
 The bulk re-settlement of squat-
 ters throughout                          the Federation
 was going on.  It would help to
 beat the bandits, said Lieutenant
 General Harold Briggs,  Director
 of Operations in Malaya.
 Sir Harold Briggs added that
 the same would happen to Com-
 munist terrorism in Malaya as had
 happened in other countries in-
 cluding Burma-the Communists
 would begin to default when they
 found that they were getting no
 food and no money.
 Thousands  of  Chinese  squat-
 ters have been rounded up and
 sent to resettlement areas because
 the  guerillas depended on them
 for food and information.
 Most of the squatters who in-
 creased greatly during the Japan-
 ese occupation, are semi-nomadic.
 The    "Briggs  Plan" is aimed at
 settling  them  permanently and
 giving them a stake in the land
 with ample protection.
 Apart  from  "weekend terror-
 ists" the hard care of guerillas in
 the jungle still numbered between
 3,000  and  5,000,  Sir  Harold
 Briggs said.
 Burma set up a Six-Man: Com-
 mittee to work with the United
 States Special Technical-Economic
 Mission in   implementing   the
 economic,''  co -
 operative,   and
 air agreement
 between Burma
 and the United
 States.
 The govern-
 ment  made  it
 plan and report its findings to the
 National Economic Council, which
 work closely with the government
 on policy questions.
 Intense fighting broke out in--
 side the South coast town of Paan,
 40  miles from the Thai-Burma
 border,  following  rebel  Karen
 penetration. Some 50 Karens were
 killed for the loss of eight gov-
 ernment men with loyal troops
 retaining possession of the town.
 Naval units were cleaning up
 Karen villages in the Paan area.
 India would not take any war-
 like action in regard to Kashmir
 "unless we are attacked or further
 aggression takes place", said Prime
 Minister Pandit
 Nehru.   India
 had  suggested
 L to Pakistan an
 appointment of
 a joint tribunal
 consisting of two  judges  each
 from India and Pakistan to settle
 other   disputes   like evacuee
 property  and  canal waters.  A
 reply  from    Pakistan     was  still
 awaited.
 The Working Committee of the
 Indian  National Congress  laid
 down an economic charter for the
 Indian people.  It resolved to es-
 tablish a welfare state.                                                        The en-
 visaged welfare state would have
 economic democracy and a nation-
 al minimum standard in respect of
 essentials of physical  and social
 well-being; a rise in the standard
 of living of the people; and pro-
 gressive narrowing down of the
 disparities in income and wealth
 so that there may be equality' of
 opportunity to all for self-develop-
 ment and growth of the person-
 ality.
 To achieve the objective, the
 Working Committee outlined the
 following six-point programme:
 (1) Development of basic and
 essential industries, such as power
 and irrigation and prior allocation
 of  available  resources  for this
 purpose.
 (2) Early realisation of self-
 sufficiency in food.
 (3) Adequate supply of essen-
 tial raw materials for industry.
 (4) Orderly  and  progressive
 reduction in the general level of
 prices.
 (5) Full and efficient utilisation
 of installed capacity in industries,
 reducing costs of production to a
 reasonable level and, at the same
 time, providing conditions in which
 workers can put forth their best
 efforts.
 (6) Expansion of opportunities
 for gainful employment by plan-
 ned development of villages and
 small-scale industries on co-opera-
 tive lines as far as possible and on
 the basis of the highest attainable
 technical efficiency.

 Nehru,  on  the  treatment  of
 minorities in both countries, Mr.
 Mandal said:
 "Nothing has been settled. On
 the contrary, communal propagan-
 da and anti-Indian propaganda by
 Pakistan,  both  at  home  and
 abroad, is   continuing  in full
 swing."
 Premier Liaquat Ali Khan told
 parliament that relations between
 Pakistan  and  neighbouring Af-
 ghanistan have grown worse.                                                                                                      He

 miles inside Pakistan.
 The Moslem League-the gov-

 TIBET
 Tibet jumped  again  into  the
 headlines.  From Hong Kong and
 London, the news agencies quoted
 an official Communist report that
 __r_      Chinese troops
 had    invaded
 Northern  Ti-
 bet. There was
 no  such  re-
 port.
 The      only
 ^=        official report
 ;~_     p-   issued at the
 time  was  one  in which    Wang
 Chen, Secretary of the Sinkiang
 Branch of the Chinese Communist
 Party, reporting on last year's
 (not this year) developments, said
 "the  People's  troops   brought
 liberation to Sinkiang and also
 entered 'Northern Tibet."
 Later in the month, the official
 New China  News  Agency     said
 that the Chinese were building a
 motor  road from Chinghai     to
 Northern Tibet
 India's Concern
 India continued  to      express
 anxiety regarding the future of
 Tibet. Meanwhile the     Tibetan
 delegates . met Peking's  Ambas-
 sador in New Delhi.                    The       dele-
 gates were told to go to Peking
 to discuss and  conclude a pact
 there with the  People's Central
 Government.
 The delegation, which includ-
 ed the Dalai Lama's brother-in-
 law,                      was  awaiting   word   from
 Lhasa whether it  should  return
 there or remain in India awaiting
 the  additional   members    who
 would accompany it to Peking.
 CEYLON
 Ceylon refused to grant entry
 visas to Trade Union leaders from
 the  Soviet Union,  other   East

 Now is the time when snakes
 begin to hibernate; now is also
 the season when men begin to eat
 snakes.
 Five-snake  dishes, three-snake
 dishes, snake soups, snake entrees,
 special snake chefs, special snake
 killers all this is prominently ad-
 vertised in the Chinese Press.
 This is the season when costly
 banquets are not  featured  by
 sharks fins-but by a variety of
 snake dishes.
 In Kiangsu and Chekiang areas,
 the snake is looked upon as some-
 thing dreadful.  Why is it con-
 sidered such a delicacy in South
 China?  An old chef with many
 years of experience  says  there
 is nothing unusual about a snake.
 Without such ingredients as chick-
 en, meat, abalone, and soup, snake
 meat is less palatable than pork.
 And is it true that snake meat has
 medicinal values capable of restor-
 ing vigour and strength?
 OWN AGENTS
 Snakes served in  Hong Kong
 restaurants come principally from
 the   New  Territories,  Wuchow,
 Kwangchowwan,  and       Mowming
 (Kochow).  Some are brought to
 the   buyers,   but  the  bigger
 restaurants send their own agents
 to the producing areas to pick the
 choicest specimens.
 There are a few establishments
 which specialise, in selecting and
 stocking   snakes   for  sale  to
 restaurants   and  other clients.
 Only three in the Colony have
 established business premises, and
 two of them  claim the title of
 "Snake Kings".  The wire cages
 which greet a visitor to any one
 of these shops  are  filled  with
 snakes of all colours and sizes.
 The "Snake King", or any mem-
 ber of his staff puts his hands into
 a. cage and takes out a snake as
 easily as lifting a rope, and allows
 it to coil round h`s arms.  As this
 is the  hibernation  period, ? the
 snakes do not have to be fed, and
 are left in their boxes to await
 buyers. They come in boxes and
 baskets, just. as any other com-
 modity.
 The gall of a snake is very valu-
 able, and sometimes accounts for
 80  per cent of the price of a
 snake.  It is said to be useful for
 the improvement of eyesight, and
 the  blood  circulating   system.
 Some snake-eating patrons go to a
 snake  shop, buy  the  gall,  and
 swallow it with wine on the spot.
 THE ORIENT
 In Kiangsu and Cheking provinces, only the
 poor eat snakes.  But in Hong Kong and elsewhere
 outside China only the well-to-do can afford to
 indulge in a banquet of snake dishes.

 In preparing snake dishes, the
 flesh  is first  torn  into  shreds.
 Abalone,   sea- -food    delicacies,
 shrimps, chicken, pork and other
 food must be used as essential in-
 gredients to produce a variety of
 dishes.
 Sometimes, the flesh of more
 than one type of snake is mixed
 to produce "three-snake soups" or
 "five-snake  soups".   Of  course,
 nobody   ever   tries  to   verify
 whether  three  or five  different
 kinds of snake actually went into
 the soup; the word of the chef
 has to be taken.
 A snake dinner is quite expen-
 sive, often costing more than $200
 a  table  of  10  diners.  Snake
 snacks are also available at the
 rate of from $6 to $8 a person.
 A snake dinner usually begins
 with "snake skin soup", with the
 portions of the skin included.
 Lam, the Snake King of Hong
 Kong,  is  dead.   One  of  the
 Colony's most fascinating person-
 alities,                        Lam was widely known
 not only in Hong Kong but in
 Canton, Singapore, and all the big
 Chinatowns  in  the world.  His
 snake shop at 82, Jervois Street,
 is still one of the main tourist at-
 tractions in the British Colony.
 His real name was Lo Tai-lam
 and his life approaches a legend.
 He was a self-made man.  When a
 boy of 15, he arrived in  Hong
 Kong with two baskets of snakes.
 He died recently at the age of 67.
 A native of Sunwui he lost his
 parents at the age of 10 years and
 had to earn his living, and give up
 his schooling.  He became inter-
 ested in snakes, and he apprentic-
 ed himself to a travelling snake-
 catcher and snake medicine ven-
 dor.
 At 15, he left his village to seek
 his fortune in Hong Kong.  In
 the first few years, he travelled
 between Hong Kong and his native
 village buying snakes in China and
 selling  them  in  Hong Kong.
 Later, he opened his own shop to
 engage .in  the  manufacture of
 snake products, including snake-
 gall treated orange peels.
 Twenty years of business ac-
 tivity found him fully established
 in the snake market.
 His partner for some 60 years.
 Mak Khuen, himself an old man
 now, referred  to  the  secret of
 Lam's  success  as  thrift,  per-
 serverance, and capacity to bear
 hardship.
 Lam is survived by five sons and
 three daughters who are carrying
 on  his  lucrative  business   in
 JerVois Street.

 Bans export of cultural objects
 Provisional regulations for protecting China's
 cultural heritage-revolutionary documents, paint-
 ings, prehistoric relics, etc.
 These Regulations, have  been
 formulated for the protection of
 China's cultural heritage, and the
 prevention of the export abroad
 of valuable cultural objects and
 books connected with'the Revolu-
 tion, China's history, culture and
 art.

 THE ORIENT
 The Veil of Modesty Disappears
 The women of South Sinkiang
 have for centuries been deprived
 of  freedom  of marriage,  and
 education.   Early marriage and
 polygamy     were the  order. A
 young girl of 12, scarcely matur-
 ed, would be married, and by 14
 or 15, would be a mother of,, two
 or three children.
 .  It was also common to find a
 young girl in her teens given in
 marriage to a man of 60.  The
 rich  and  the  powerful treated
 women as playthings, taking them
 in marriage today and abandoning
 them the next.
 As a glaring example, take the
 case of Subihochia, a big landlord
 and religious leader in Kashghar,
 who exploited his' special rights.
 Only 30 years old, he has married
 at least 150 times.  He exploited
 his caste privileges to get what-
 ever  girl  he                        fancied  and C the
 women he subsequently discarded
 could find no new husbands. '
 Some women were locked in
 dark rooms to prevent them from
 seeing men over 12 years of age.
 They waited on their husbands at
 meals  and  took the left-overs
 from the table.  They could not
 walk  shoulder to  shoulder  with
 their men but had to follow in the
 rear.
 ALL RACES
 Very few girls indeed had the
 chance of an education.  In the
 Kashghar district, there are 126.-
 450 women and girls, but only'j 130
 are enrolled in middle schools,;and
 3,938 in the primary schools. This
 is in Kashghar, the so-called cul-
 tural centre of South Sinkiang.
 Conditions in  other  areas 'are
 worse.
 The Administrative Policy re-
 cently promulgated by the Sin-
 kiang  Provincial   Government,
 specially stipulates that  women
 shall  enjoy the  same rights as
 men, and that there shall be free-
 dom of marriage.
 Feudal customs which made women the slaves
 of men are being steadily eliminated in Southern
 Sinkiang province, reports a correspondent from
 Tihwa.  Women, he adds, are being "liberated".
 MUSLIM WOMEN
 Reluctantly falling
 Under the leadership of the new
 Government, the women  of all
 races and all classes have organis-
 ed their own Federation of Demo-
 cratic Women to struggle for the
 rights of women in the province.
 The traditional veil of modesty
 is  reluctantly  falling from the
 faces of Muslim women in South-
 ern Sinkiang province in North
 West China.
 This is a result of a resolution
 adopted by an Assembly of Re-
 presentatives of all racial groups
 in the region.  It was passed at
 a conference held in Kashgar.
 "Discard  the  veil and enjoy
 freedom  of  marriage" was the
 slogan  of  the  Assembly.  The
 movement has spread to remote
 parts of Southern Sinkiang, but
 the removal of veils is not univer-
 sal.
 Most of the women are reluc-
 tant to abandon  the  tradition,
 which  is so  deep-rooted among
 Mohammedans.
 Ru' na's Rot/alt y hit t j 11i yk Viola y Costs
 Burma's  ageing  princes  and
 princesses, hard hit by high living
 costs in the Republic of Burma,
 want increased pensions.
 These descendants of King Min-
 don, who ruled Burma before? the
 British, formed the Burmese Royal
 Family Association and decided to
 approach  the  Burmese  Govern-
 ment for "sympathetic considera-
 tion" because they are unable to
 earn a livelihood.
 The pensions paid members of
 the Burmese Royal family in the
 British  era were maintained by
 the Burmese Government after in-
 pendence.
 But when bankruptcy threaten-
 ed the country, the pensions were
 trimmed.
 A sub-committee of six is to pre-
 sent the case for more money. As
 a softener-up,  it has urged all
 branches of the Royal family to
 co-operate with the Government in
 ..unifying the country.

 Poriugal'i gem in Asia
 By
 Alberto da Cruz
 In a swirl of the Pearl River,
 washed        by mud which yellows
 the blue green of the China Sea,
 lies Macao. The  eddies which
 race . across the bay lash at a
 peninsula heavy with history. For
 Macao is the scene of China's first
 contact with the West.
 Macao, about 40 miles South of
 Hong. Kong, is the oldest foreign
 settlement  in  this part of the
 world.  But it is not the oldest
 foreign colony in China.
 It has been a place of residence
 for Portuguese and other Euro-
 pean traders since the 16th cen-
 tury, but its outright transferance
 to Portugal as -a colony was not
 finalised by the  Chinese  until
 1887.
 Drooping alabaster and the sad
 lament of a dead Praya reflect
 Macao's faded glory.  Its utility
 has long been usurped by Hong
 Kong, but the city retains its im-
 portance as a spot where history
 lurks in every corner. .
 Many years ago Sir John Bow-
 ring, a Governor of Hong Kong,
 described Macao as a gem of the
 Orient.  A gem it has been to this
 day.
 The peculiar charm of Macao
 lies in its quiet, old-world atmos-
 phere; there are wide avenidas
 lined with banyans, narrow cobble_
 stoned  streets,  and  old  forts
 brisling culverins and   demicul-
 verins.   Hundreds  of                            clanging
 church clocks "sprinkle the quar-
 ter-hours o'er the market plac'e,"
 and a drowsy tinkling fills the air.
 There are spots in Macao where
 it is easy to picture the past, and
 sense the adventurous spirit of
 Europe's  early  relations   with
 China.  Located at the month of
 the Pearl River, it was for cen-
 turies the residence of all Euro-
 pean merchants trading in China.
 Its natural beauty is enhanced
 by buildings which proclaim a La-
 tin influence. Its climate, the com-
 parat'vely moderate cost of living,
 and its tranquillity and languor
 combine to make it .one of the
 most charming spots in Asia.
 This is a brief history of the Portuguese Colony
 of Macao.  The author hopes its cultural mission
 will go on forever like Tennyson's brook.
 Macao is  entrancing at first
 glance; it juts out of' the penin-
 sula unobtrusively. Penha Church,
 crowning the hill, is visib'e four
 miles away. There is a little bay
 and a waterfront of old houses.
 Though in the tropics and on to
 the other side of the globe, a
 traveller might imagine he is en-
 tering an Iberian port, for the
 white buildings shining in the sun
 are in the Spanish baroque of the
 16th century.
 They form a crescent along the
 edge of the yellow, muddy sea,
 and merge into a promenade called.
 the Praya  Grande.  Behind, the
 ground  r'ses  gradually, and  in
 places the streets  are  stepped.
 Towers of churches and monas-
 teries are sprinkled over tha neiTh-
 bourhood.                                                                 The hil's are studded
 with forts whose cannon are now
 used only for saluting.
 The Portuguese have been in
 Macao for over 400 years.  They
 lived there under the Ming for
 100 years and by 1830-when the
 Brit'sh encroachment on China be-
 gan-had                                                              been  for  186     years
 under the Ch'ing.
 Up till 1685, when K'ang Hsi
 opened  Canton to all Western
 ships, Portuguese traders in Macao
 had  a  monopoly of the China
 trade.  The  breaking  of  this
 monopoly completed their ruin,
 already well advanced by the de-
 cline in                                                           Europe of Portuguese
 power.
 When Hong Kong slipped into
 history Macao was already an old
 European settlement, top heavy
 with a stultifying tradition.
 Portugal led the way for, the
 Western maritime powers to open
 direct relations with China, and
 Macao was the venue.
 In 1498 Vasco da Gains doubled
 the' Cape of Good Hope and found
 the way to India. In 1511 Afonso
 d'Albuquerque captured? Malacca;
 in 1513 Jorge Alvares voyaged to
 China; and in 1517 Fernao Perez
 de Andrade came to  the Pearl
 River.
 According to one version of his-
 tory, the Portuguese were per-
 mitted by the Chinese to settle in
 Macao  for trade purposes as a
 reward for having helped the Im-
 perial                                                                                                 Chinese  Navy to combat
 piracy in the South China Seas.
 .However, for over 300 years the
 Chinese refused to formal se this
 settlement which they conceded.
 The Imperial Government main-
 tained in Macao its own officials,
 and until 1887 the Portuguese did
 not enjoy undivided control of the
 city.  In the 300 years of their
 tenure of Macao  under  leas,;
 Portuguese merchants were not
 allowed to enter China.
 The settlement was founded in
 1557.  As the harbour of the s??te
 chosen was called Amagau, mean-
 ing Queen of the Ama, the Portu-
 guese called the place Macao.
 As the years went by the port
 became   the   headquarters  of
 Christian missionary endeavour in
 the Far East; it also assumed the
 role of the principal en`repot for
 European trade with China and
 Japan.  Manv colleges and con-
 vents were built, and the Catholic
 faith flourished.
 Fleets of ships were built and
 fortunes made. As the population
 grew  in  wealth  and. numbers,
 churches and forts sprang up all
 over the city.  Among these was
 the famous Church of St. Paul,
 whose eerie ruins may still be
 seen.
 From its earliest days Macao
 was a centre    of religious and
 humanitarian work.  The Jesuits
 built their hostel there in 1562,
 and it developed into the College
 of St. Paul, a university which
 sent  scholars  to  many  other
 Portuguese missions in the Far
 East.
 In 1569 the Santa  Casa      da
 Misericordia-the. Holy House of
 Mercy-was established. It is a
 charitable institution which sur-
 vives  to  the  present day and
 which set up, as long ago as.1569,
 the Hospital of Ht. Raphael.

 PORTUGUESE COLONY OF MACAO
 THE ORIENT
 -sible to see, in Macao, the build-
 ings which were occupied by the
 Dutch   and   Swedish   officials.
 Those occupied by the French and
 other traders cannot be traced.
 Little by little relations between
 the Dutch and the Portuguese im-
 proved. The Dutch were ultimate-
 ly allowed to come to Macao when
 the "season" closed in Canton and
 they had to vacate their "factory"
 there.
 At this time the Chinese Im-
 perial authorities encouraged the
 emergence of Macao as a "step-
 ping stone" to China. All traders
 were compelled by them to. go to
 Macao first and  wait there  for
 permission to proceed to Canton.
 When the first officially appointed
 British  envoy to  China,   Lord
 Napier, tried to bypass this re-
 gulation, his mission collapsed and
 in the end he went to Macao to
 die, a sad and broken man.
 With the arrival of these for-
 eign traders and the establishment
 of their "off-season" residences,
 Protestantism asserted itself. The
 Portuguese, despite then Catholic-
 ism, did not baulk at this.
 After 1840 and the Opium War
 between   England  and  China,
 Captain Elliott forced the Bogue
 and wrested Hong Kong and the
 treaty ports from the Emperor at
 Peking.  Hong Kong took a long
 time to realise its true mission in
 the world,  but when that was
 achieved,  it  quickly  surpassed
 Macao,                       -
 The English element % transfer-

 and,many Portuguese subjects-.fol-
 lowed 'them, to -staff the British
 .Macao-  thus  prides  itself. on
 possessing a hospital which is al-
 most 400 years old, where West-
 ern medical science and surgery
 were practised on the coast of
 China and where the Chinese be-
 came? familiar with the gradual
 development of medicine through
 the years.
 -COVETOUS EYES
 In  the  early  days  Macao's
 population increased  so. rapidly
 that by the end of the 16th; cen-
 tury more- than 20,000 inhabitants,
 -mostly   Chinese, had  gathered
 Twice a year in Canton great
 "markets" were held, and Portu-
 guese merchants'stayed for many
 months in the Chinese city to buy
 goods   which  they subsequently
 sent to India, Malaya, and Japan.
 Every year; in true Latin. style.
 the King of Portugal gave one of
 his current favourites the' mono-
 poly to conduct the trade between
 Macao and Japan.  This expedi-
 tion, made with one ship only, was
 always so profitable that the for-
 tunate merchant could count'on a
 profit of at least, 200,aOO golden
 ducats.
 When news of Macao's riches
 reached the Dutch, jealousy, en-
 'sued.-   The. Dutch,  looking up
 from their own East Indies, cast.
 covetous eyes on the Portuguese-
 settlement; "and , made many- at-
 temptstowrest it from the Portu-'
 guese crdwn:   '
 When Pprtugalwas under Spam-
 -from 1580 to 1641,,the Senate im
 Macao`refpser};'to accept Sanish
 rule, 'and`the Portuguese flag' was
 kept flying from the tower.G  For'
 this act the Senate came to be
 known as the Leal Senado (Loyal
 Senate) and retains this name to
 the present time.
 The Dutch used the refusal of
 Macao to submit to Spanish rule
 -as an excuse for attacking the
 Portuguese  settlement.  In  the
 17th  century,  they launched
 several attacks on Macao, all of
 which failed.
 On  St.- John's Day, 1662, a
 -large  Dutch force succeeded in
 landing, while the  Dutch Fleet
 bombarded the place from the sea.
 The defeat of the Dutch on this
 occasion, is ;one of the most con-
 spicuous events in the .history of
 Macao, ..and  on June 24, every
 year, the colony remembers - the
 victory. . An old monument stands
 in the place where the Dutch-were
 routed.   The  invaders,  nothing
 daunted, then established a fort
 on Formosa from which they way-
 laid Portuguese ships plying the
 Japan route.
 The ships of other nations also
 began to visit  Macao,  seeking
 trade  with  China.    However,
 many years were to pass before
 the volume of trade was great
 enough to arouse the interest of
 Europe as a whole.
 BROKEN MAN
 This did not take place until
 the middle of the 18th century,
 when  the  English  East ;India
 Company obtained permission to
 set up residences in Macao for its
 officials.     Personnel  of .the  East
 India companies of `other nations'
 f"allowed: suit and it is still pos-

 banks, emporiums, and commercial
 establishment  which  were  then
 slowly rising.
 OLD LUSTRE
 With the growth of the new
 Colony, ties were established be-
 tween the two ports, which persist
 to this day.
 It was at Macao that the first
 treaty between the United States
 and China was signed. The events
 leading  to the  signing of this
 treaty make it clear  that  the
 Chinese officials were anxious that
 the American envoy should not
 land on Chinese soil.
 The Temple of the Queen of
 Heaven, known among the Chinese
 as Kwan Yin Tong, was chosen as
 the venue for the meeting.  The
 table on which the signing, took
 place may still be seen.    The date
 was July 3, 1844.
 From then on, until 1860 when
 China allowed foreign envoys to
 live in Peking,  Macao      remained
 the residence  of the American
 Minister to China.  An American
 naval hospital and office were also
 set up in Macao during this time.
 Commodore Perry assembled his
 squadron in Macao waters before
 proceeding to Japan to "open up"
 that country in the middle of the
 19th century.
 After 1840 Macao assumed some
 importance  as  a  reminder  of
 Portugal's  mediaeval grandeur,
 but as an entrepot its significance
 diminished as Hong  Kong   pro-
 gressed.
 In its role as a haven for re-
 fugees, however,                     the     old lustre
 was unfailingly maintained.
 In its long history it has cons's-
 tently preserved a tradition for
 giving shelter and refuge to thou-
 sands of men, women and children
 in distress.
 Whether these refugees were
 Christians fleeing from persecu-
 tion                  or lepers cast out of their
 homes, Macao did not deny them
 sanctuary.
 In the 18th and 19th centuries
 it was the assembly point for all
 missionaries  preparing to  enter
 Asia to spread word of the gospel.
 And, everytime a persecution oc-
 curred in the Far East, the vic-
 tims descended on Macao and were
 admitted.
 At one time Macao was also Dr.
 Sun Yat-sen's second home. When
 the Father of the Republic was
 required to flee the long arm of
 the law in China for plots against,
 the Manchu Government, it was at
 Macao that he found refuge.
 The Boxer Uprising in North
 China made conditions for for-
 eigners in South China somewhat
 dif?i.cult, and among the schools
 THE ORIENT
 which left Canton at that time
 was the then :newly established
 Lingnan University.  This--institu-
 tion set up its colleges in Macao,
 and remained  there  until  the
 trouble in China ended.
 At no time, however, did Macao
 prove its worth more than in the
 years after China was invaded by
 the Japanese in 1937. From ? all
 over the mainland people flocked
 to Macao, and here the wounded
 were treated, the 'weary rested,
 and the needy were relieved of
 their distress, while thousands of
 children were given homes in or-
 phanages.  Chinese schools found
 accommodation, too, in this little
 Portuguese colony.
 Macao was  seen at its best
 when the Japanese extended their
 hostilities to attack Allied posses-
 sions in, the Far East in 1941.
 The Portuguese colony remained
 the only spot in the whole of the
 China coast which was not oc-
 cupied by the Japanese. They did
 hold the city in economic sub-
 jection, however.
 The city's reputation for charity
 and hospitality was never shown
 to better advantage than in the
 troubled years of war when its
 normal population of 200,000 rose
 to over 500,000 people.
 After Hong Kong was overrun
 by the Japanese, more refugees
 entered Macao, and the meagre
 food supply of the colony was
 taxed to the limit.
 li4
 When the war ended it was to
 Macao  that  the  Hong Kong
 authorities looked for personnel
 for the junior services, and even
 some of the senior services; to re-
 habilitate the British colony.                                                                                         For
 food, too, Hong Kong looked to
 Macao for help and large quanti-
 ties                                                                                         of  cereals were sent over,
 which resulted in the contraction
 of  supplies for the Portuguese
 colony itself.
 The Chinese civil war and the
 advance of the Communists to the
 borders of Macao posed a serious
 problem for the Portuguese au-
 thorities.  For a time last year
 there were fears  that  Macao's
 tranouillity would be disturbed, as
 the colony is fundamentally op-
 posed to the philosophy expound-
 ed by Marx.
 Its  borders,  however,    were
 respected by the People's Libera-
 tion                                                                                              Army,  and no  serious in-
 cidens have arisen as a result of
 the new situation.
 There exists today in Macao a
 widespread belief that peace will
 prevail for a long time to come,
 and the city will be allowed to
 pursue its quite, unobtrusive pace
 across  the  tides of a confused
 world.
 Macao  does  not  enjoy  the
 world-wide commercial eminence
 of Hong Kong, but it has some
 commerce and industry. The gold
 policy of its Government has en-
 abled it to concentrate on the bulk
 purchase and sale of this metal
 as the principal source of revenue,
 with the result that the income
 derived from gambling-once of
 tremendous  importance - is  no
 longer significant.
 OF ILL-FAME
 Gambling  houses  are being
 liquidated by a process of denial
 of license, and it is predicted that
 by the end of next year, Macao's
 famous reputation as the "Monte
 Carlo of the East" will be without
 any basis in fact.
 This toleration of gambling and
 opium smoking is one of the con-
 tradictions which  abound in the
 history of the place.  There has
 always existed in Macao a blend-
 ing of, morality with  practical
 commonsense  which     sometimes
 borders on the verge of comedy.
 For centuries the Portuguese
 claimed sovereignty    over the
 place, but Chinese officials from
 Canton  often  arrived without
 warning in the city, and with a
 great flourish of trumpets affixed
 proclamations on Municipal boards,
 which the local Portuguese hasten-
 ed to accept.

 THE 10th, 11th and 12th Chinese
 moons contain - no colourful
 festivals, so I will devote a little
 time to the Chinese Calendar and
 Almanac.  The Calendar is that
 part which may be said to contain
 astronomical information and the
 Almanac that part which deals
 with all the astrological aspects.
 Although a great many combina-
 tions can be made with all' the
 symbols  used, when reduced to
 simple details, there is little that
 cannot be mastered by the ordin-
 ary man.
 The book which combines the
 Calendar and Almanac is called
 Tung Shing.  The real name of
 the book is Tung Shue, Book on
 General Matters. The word Shue
 for "book" has the same pronun-
 ciation as the word for "defeat".
 To avoid the bad luck that might
 be implied in the use of such a
 sound, Shue (defeat) was changed
 to Shing (victory).
 Lucky Days
 T HE Tung Shing in use today
 derives ;ts astronomical section
 from a work called the Wan Nien
 Shu-10,000 Years Book-which
 is an abridged version of a work
 covering 397 years from 1624-
 2020,  compiled  by  the  Jesuit
 Father J. H. Schaal in the reign
 of the  Ching dynasty Emperor
 Shun Chili  (1644-1662)  and by
 Father F. Verbiest in the reign of
 Emperor Kang Hsi (1662-1723).
 The Imperial Government also
 issued annually an Almanac con-
 taining a fund of details relating
 to astrology and lucky days.  So
 much importance was attached to
 this book that any person repro-
 eucing it was liable to a severe
 punishment and the penalty for
 falsifying its contents was death.
 The Tung Shing can be bought
 from about  the  11th  Chinese
 Moon for from $1 to ;$4 a copy.
 according to s'ze. Let us take a
 glance through  the  contents of
 th's interesting book.
 On  the  very first page I's a
 symbolic picture of a man-boy

 beast, under a bamboo.   The' pic-

 ture is the same every year, ex-
 cept for certain details. This year
 (1950) the boy has a moustache.
 In the sky is a brilliant sun.  This
 is the Spring Cow and the Spirit
 of Vegetation. A little verse dis-
 posed on either side tells us for
 the year Keng Yin (1950):
 "Misfortune  arrives      before
 Ken Yin (1950) disappears.
 "Between Liang (N. China)

 "Fortunately hemp and wheat
 crops flourish in season.
 "But we fear that rice shoots
 suffer heavy damage.
 "In agriculture  beware lest
 glutinous rice gives small
 grains.
 "The price of cocoons will be
 like gold.
 "Many  go  carefree  hoping
 that Heaven will protect.
 "Peace may possibly comfort
 men's minds."
 T HEN follows information as to
 when persons aged one to a
 hundred were born  in  Chinese
 style. Your age is reckoned as
 being one on the day you are
 born and then two on the Lunar
 New Year following your birth.
 Thus if your age is 25 in Novem-
 ber,                                                             according to   European
 reckoning  you  were      born  in
 November,  1925.   On  Chinese
 reckoning  you  will be 26      on.
 Chinese  New Year,  1950.  The
 table shows you to have been born
 in the 14th year of the Republic.
 A hundred year old man was born
 in the 1st year of Hs'n Feng.
 Then comes a mass of astro-
 logical information,  followed by
 charms of the Taoist Pope, Chang
 Tin Sze.  One charm you can put
 in your shoes, others in your belt,
 or on the kitchen wall, or in a
 haunted spot,, or on your. door, or
 at your well.
 There are then 26 barriers, each
 with a picture, showing the dan-
 gers you are subject to as a ch9d
 if born at a certain time in a cer-
 tain month, and how to avoid such
 dangers.
 Next there is information about
 birth,  including  charms to  be
 burnt and the ashes mixed with
 water, which the expectant mother
 will drink in case she should have
 offended the Spirit of Birth. Such
 offence  might  complicate   the
 labour by turning the child the
 wrong way.
 Twitching Eyes
 T HEN we have with pictures the
 meaning  of     a  twitching eye,
 noise in the ear, hot ears, hot face,
 sudden itch, sudden start, sneeze,
 clothes  catching  in  something,
 caldron hiss-ng, fire jumping out
 of stove, dog barking and magpie
 calling.
 For instance if your left eye
 twitches any time between 5 and
 7 a.m. you may expect to have a
 visit from some important person.
 The 28 constellations which fol-
 low play a big role in the system
 of good or bad luck.  They are
 shown with pictures, being repre-
 sented by men or women.
 .  When you have waded through
 the information on the stars, we
 reach a chapter on palmistry, then
 a method of finding out what your
 luck is by  juggling with coins.
 Next comes a work purporting to
 be handed down from the Duke of
 Chow  (XIIth century B.C.)  on
 dreams. Drawing at random from
 this, you may note that if you
 dream that snow falls on you it
 means success in everything, or if
 you go to a well and draw c'ean
 water  your  luck is good, but
 muddy  water  means  bad  luck.
 Should you dream that a devil is
 beating you, why then your mis-
 fortune will be very great.

 Following after a few pages of
 Chinese surnames we land on a
 discourse  concerning  Confucius
 and children.  This discourse is
 accompanied by the. names of all
 the disciples of the master. The
 tale is that Confucious was' wan-
 dering with his disciple and came
 upon some children playing', but
 one little fellow was not playing.
 The picture attached shows the.
 Master getting out of his carriage
 and  addressing  this  little  boy,
 "Why are you not playing?"
 To which.the little prig replied:
 "Playing is no use.    Clothes are
 not easy to mend when torn, and
 I should be disrespectful to my
 parents and setting a bad example
 to  others.   I  should  certainly
 squabble and expend energy with-
 out profit, so how can playing be
 good.  That's why I don't play."
 Confucius asks him many ques-
 tions but could not stump . him.
 However the little prig stumped
 and snubbed Confucius.   Which
 from a Taoist viewpoint was quite
 a desirable thing to do.
 Then  there  are -examples of
 filial  piety.  followed   by the
 Chinese telephone  code.   Then
 that  work called the Thousand
 Character Classic, because it has
 1,016 characters, all of which are
 different.
 This is followed by a little work
 by the great Sung scholar, Chu
 Hsi. It is called, "Pattern fcr
 Running a Home."  Chu tells you
 to get up at dawn, sprinkle and
 sweep the house and court. When
 ypu lock up at night, be sure to go
 ,over it  your; elf. Among  some
 of the pearls of wisdom contained
 therein, Chu Hsi tells you not to
 wait until you are thirsty before
 digging a well.  He also tells you
 that when a person wants others
 to see his goodness, then it is not
 real goodness.   And that when a
 man is afraid that his wrong doing
 will be known, then it is very
 wrong indeed. .
 Gold Turns
 N OT satisfied with this chapter
 of  teaching,  the  Almanac
 adds another on Chinese proverbs.
 Amongst these we may read, "The
 world is full of acoua=rtances. but
 fr'ends are few."  "When good
 luck departs, gold turns into iron;
 when the throe for rood luck ar-
 rives, iron is like gold" "You can
 draw a tiger's skin, but it is diffi-
 cult to draw his bones; you may
 know a man's fae..P_ but not his
 heart."  "In the hies are straight
 trees. in the world are no straight
 men."         "What a hundred years is
 lnsuffic, 'nt to build,  one  day  is.
 more  than  enough to destroy."
 "Walls   have  cracks,  partitions
 have ears." "A good man is de-
 ceived by men; a good horse is
 ridden by men." "Without illegal
 profits  a  man cannot be rich;
 without wild grass a horse cannot
 get fat."   "Good and evil will
 finally be requited, the only doubt
 being as to whether it will be
 sooner or later."
 The Almanac then ; has sections
 to teach English, Cantonese and
 Malayan.  This is followed by the
 etiquette for marriages and how
 to send out greeting cards.
 Then surrounding a table giv-
 ing Lunar Months for years from
 Kuan Hsu, 17th year-1891, to
 Republic 51st year-1962, is a lot
 of information about the 10 celes-
 tial stems and the 12 terrestrial
 branches.

 To the 12 branches there are

 tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse,
 sheep, monkey, cock, dog, pig. If
 1950 is Keng Yin, then the branch
 Yin corresponds to Tiger, and this
 year is Tiger Year.
 The 10 stems correspond to the

 metal, earth.  So that every hour,

 to give a cycle of 60.  This cycle
 commenced in 2637 B.C.  Thps
 1950, cyclic letters Keng Yin, is
 the 27th year. of the 77th cycle.
 The 12 branches correspond to
 the  times  of  day  divided into

 applies to years.  Every lunar

 given in the table of years just
 mentioned above., Also every day
 has its cyclic number.  It is pos-
 every  day,  every  month,  every
 year corresponds to thesa stems
 and branches.
 The actual Calendar occupies 48
 pages out of 300 of the Tung
 Shing.
 If we consider the 10th Moon,
 we observe that in the centre of
 the  column is Lunar  Calendar,
 while at the top is Solar Calendar,
 11th Moon.  That is November.
 The  1st of the  10th Moon   is
 November 10th and the last day,
 the  29th of the 10th Moon, is
 December 8th.
 At the head of the 10th Moon
 section are the days devoted to
 various deit'es and spirits.  We
 cannot call these birthdays, as one
 spirit. may have more than one
 day, in the year, or even in a.
 month.

 be husband of 20th daughter
 of heavenly mother.  This is the
 Emperor's star.
 However we do not have to
 enter into the genealogies of the
 Chinese fairies, as there would be
 no end to it.  All these are minor
 spirits, which for some reason or
 other a person may favour. How-
 ever it is unlikely that anyone
 would  come    into  contact  with
 such a spirit unless there should
 be a local temple which has a'con-
 nection with such.
 Below  the  days  special. to

 It may be noted at this stage
 that each of the 28 constellations
 has a special character and these
 come. round in turn  both  for
 months and days.  That   means
 that as well as using a cycle of
 60 days, there are also periods of
 28  days,  exactly four weeks.
 Therefore the constellations come
 round on the. same days of the
 week, each day having four j con-
 tellations corresponding. .
 The 1st of the 10th Moon is
 under the constellation Lou. : Lou
 always belongs to the Western

 what constellation a day belongs
 to, you can tell at once what is the
 Western day of the week.       And
 this holds good however far, back
 you  may  go.  In problems of
 chronology, it is an interesting
 fact to remember that in the West
 the  Calendar  was  altered     in
 various  centuries  for  different
 countries in order to bring the
 year into agreement with the sun.
 For England 'this occurred in the
 XVIIIth    century   by   shifting
 Calendar forward 11 days.
 Not Altered
 BUT the days of the week were
 not altered, and a direct seven
 day period goes back to the most
 ancient history. Thus an addition-
 al                                                      connection between the solar

 through the 28 constellations.

 (Continued from page 19)
 For centuries, also, Macao was
 the centre of Catholicism in the Far
 East, but more gambling went on
 there than in any other foreign
 possession.   There  were  always
 more churches in Macao than any-
 where else in China, but morality
 -in terms of houses of ill-fame
 which  flourished  in   a  special
 street called Felicity Road-was
 never too high.
 The Portuguese, treated to a
 system of tactful balancing  by.
 the Chinese, replied in turn with
 a balance of their own in Macao,
 with the result that moral laxity
 and  Christian  intolerance lived
 side by side, and convenient ac-
 commodations  were  so  natural
 that people simply ? ceased to
 bother about incongruities.
 The colony today is lazy with
 the accumulated relics and tradi-
 tons of its past. The pace is slow
 and  the  atmosphere distinctly
 drowsy, but half a million people
 must live, and trade and industry
 exists to provide for them.
 For its size, the volume of trade
 is satisfactory.  The principal in-
 dustry is Fisheries, and a recent
 estimate lists 20.000 people as em-
 ployed in it.  The fishing trade
 reaches a value of $5,000,000 a
 year.
 The manufacture of firecrackers
 is another important industry, and
 thousands of poor find part-time
 employment in their homes pre-
 paring the empty shills which are
 then taken to the factories to be
 filled before being exported to all
 parts of the world,  valued   at
 about $2,000,000 in some years.
 Joss sticks provide employment
 for many people.  To make them
 is a thriving industry valued at
 over $1,500..000 per annum.  The
 match  factories  give  work  to
 many hundreds of hands, with a
 turnover running into . well over
 several million dollars ayear.
 Macao shifted from the old to
 the modern with the introduction
 of electricity in 1912, and in the
 postwar years daylight-type street-
 lighting has given impetus to the
 city's nocturnal beauty-at once
 a mixture of the very old and the
 relatively new.
 Shipping at Macao, too, has im-
 proved in recent years, and effec-
 tive dredging work has enhanced
 the port greatly. with the result
 that vessels drawing up to 17 feet
 have been able to enter and dis-
 charge their cargoes.
 COLOURFUL NAMES
 Macao's trade with South China
 has not. declined, despite the ad-
 vent                            of  Communism.  On  the
 other hand its trade with Hong
 Kong has increased    by  a great
 margin.  In December last. year,
 Macao bought more from Hong
 for transhipment elsewhere than
 any other part of the. world, in-
 cluding the United States.
 When China is at peace, Macao
 serves as the distributing centre
 for the district of  Chung Shan
 (Heung Shan), and for such parts
 of China as are brought in touch
 with the district by the new motor
 highways which the Chinese au-
 thorities are building.
 Culturally its mission has not
 ended.   Out of its repository of
 European  traditions,  many  in-
 fluences continue to spread which
 keep its ideal of universality alive.
 Macao's existence has given rise
 to a new type of people, the China-
 born Portuguese, who combine in
 themselves many elements of two
 races. Their colourful names, the
 lingua franca which they use, the
 intense  Catholicism which they
 exhibit, detract from the occasion-
 al  Oriental  condition  of. their
 demeanour, so that the argument
 of the   Portuguese  Consul  in
 Hong Kong, Dr. Eduardo Brazao,
 that they will not be "absorbed"
 by China may. well prove to be
 true.
 . But what is their future,' and
 the future of Macao?  A lot de-
 pends on the future of Europe,
 and the future of the Free World.
 The  people  of  Macao  cling
 strongly  to  the  promptings of
 their religion, and are taught to
 believe that the "miracles" which
 have always saved the colony in
 the past will operate in perpepuity
 to preserve Portuguese control. A
 story is repeated dogmatically that
 when the Dutch  launched  their
 most serious attacks in the 17th
 Century, the Virgin Mary appear-
 ed over the city and spread her
 mantle to receive all the Dutch
 gunfire.
 Macao is deeply religious. Most
 of the inhabitants go to church on
 Sundays, and very little beef is
 eaten on Fridays. Whenever there
 is a religious procession business
 stops and the city is almost en
 fete.
 Catholicism is so strongly en-
 trenched  that  any  Communism
 which denies freedom of religion
 will find little scope for advance-
 ment there.
 ? LIVING HISTORY
 Outside of religion, there is the
 Portuguese approach to democracy
 -which forbids trade unionism
 and a too liberal interpretation of
 the freedom  of  speech.  Little
 evidence  of planned repression
 exists, but by a common accord
 there  is no  precipitate injection
 of leftist tendencies.
 The small Portuguese garrison
 provides no 'protection, and the,
 Barrier Gate which  divides Por-
 tuguese territory from China is a
 symbol, not a stratagem.
 But the colony pursues its busi-
 ness with no misgivings. Over .the
 atmosphere broods a quiet convic-
 tion of inalienable right acquired
 by four centuries of possession.
 The mental attitude is conditioned
 by a widespread assumption that
 to  ruffle  Macao's composure is
 simply to destroy a good thing.
 Therefore why ruffle?
 Its peaceful avenues, its great
 leafy trees, its nostalgic charm
 and its dignity impart to Macao a
 temperament incapable of duplica-
 tion  elsewhere.   The  place is
 unique, singularly intense.
 To some, its contribution to his-
 tory                                                                                         has  ?been  achieved.  They
 feel that as long as China main-
 tains                                                                                         her  connection with    the
 West, Macao will be remembered
 as the anvil on which the original
 links were forged. But to her own
 people the colony, as a part of
 their lives, remains a living his-
 tory.   Like  Tennyson's                                                                                                  brook,
 they hope  that it will "go on
 forever."

 tive                                                                                               of the Manila     department
 store, Aguinaldo's Avenida, warned
 recently  that forced  liquidation
 of Chinese capital in the Philip-
 pines   would likely  scare                                                                                                other
 .foreign capital, including Ameri-
 can, from entering the Philippine
 investment field.
 The store executive, who was
 speaking on "what the Chinese
 .community can do to help our
 national  economy"  at  the  Y's
 Men's club meeting at the UNO,
 urged  Chinese  businessmen  to
 branch out  from  the  importing
 and   distribution  fields to the
 broader fields of production and
 manufacturing.
 He said that greater production
 necessitates huge capital invest-
 ment and that it was vital for
 the Philippines to create a favour-
 able climate for outside investors.
 "If we have been unsuccessful so
 far in enticing desirable ,foreign
 capitals," he said, "it is precisely
 because, among other things, we
 are  doing  everything  to  scare
 away even those that are already
 established in this country."
 "Surely,"   he  warned,   "forced
 liquidation of Chinese capital cur-
 rently invested will result in a
 most embarrassing question from
 prospective  investors  who might
 well ask:    `Who is going to be
 next?"'
 Mr. Aguinaldo further urged the
 Chinese community to encourage
 the idea of assimilation and to
 mix freely with Filipinos.  "Point
 to the numerous prominent Fili-
 pinos of today who are                                                                                                   descen-
 dants of unknown Chinese immi-
 grants of yesteryears.  They are
 great examples that you can point
 to  with pride,  living  proof that
 the Chinese can become desirable
 Filipinos," he said.

 Whatever little else the outside
 world may know of the Chinese
 theatre, the fact that men play
 women's roles has long been com-
 mon knowledge to  be repeated
 ad infinitum.  Female impersona-
 tion is no new thing in dramatic
 history, Eastern or Western, but
 it is an art which the Chinese
 stage has made peculiarly its own.
 The female impersonator Was a
 necessity dictated by the complete
 ban on actresses in China.  Dur-
 ing the reign of Chien Lung an
 imperial edict was issued forbid-
 ding women  to  perform.                           Th s
 rule was rigidly enforced and it
 was not until the years before the
 Revolution of 1911 that there be-
 gan to take place a revival of ac-
 tresses appearing on the profes-
 sional stage.
 THE TABOO
 Even so, for many years men
 and women were not seen acting
 together, and  special  theatres
 for women players were establish-
 ed.                       It is only within recent de-
 cades that the complete emancipa-
 tion of women on the stage has
 taken place.
 The actors who played female
 parts had to undergo severe train-
 ing and attain a prodigious skill.
 Here was  no  burlesque  but a
 highly  specialised   branch   of
 dramatic technique,   played   by
 men who were very often supreme
 artists. How supreme     can only
 be realised by those who have
 seen actors like Mei Lan Fang in
 Shanghai or Chang Chun Ch'iu in
 present day Hong Kong.
 With  the  complete disappear-
 ance  of the taboo on actresses
 there is no longer the same neces-
 sity for the female impersonator.
 THE ORIENT
 THE CHINESE ACTOR'S ROLES
 Mr. Scott, in 'his fourth article, describes the
 different roles of the Chinese actor and the costumes
 worn when on the stage.   These  articles and
 accompanying drawings are strictly copyright.
 The highly developed technique of
 the latter has been adopted by
 actresses  many of whom  have
 studied under the famous imper-
 sonators.                                                                  They  carry  on the
 tradition with a true competence
 and delicate skill.
 There is little doubt that in the
 past the great impersonators at-
 tained                                                               heights  in  their per-
 formances never reached by the
 actress. It is as though having
 to concentrate on the essentials
 of  women's  characteristics they
 manage to express the essence of
 femininity in a manner which is
 indescribable in so many words.
 Everyone  must concede  that
 here is genuine art.  On the other
 hand, in the writer's opinion, there
 is no question at all that in gen-
 eral  the  first  rate . actress, of
 whom there are many, is every bit
 as  effective. There  is  nothing
 more depressing than a mediocre
 female impersonator.
 A favourite pastime of Chinese
 theatre goers when taking for-
 eigners to a dramatic performance
 has been to ask 'them to guess
 whether it is man or woman play-
 ing the female role.  I have often
 been such a victim but in gen-
 eral passed the test because of
 one thing, the hands of the actor.
 The male hand has a character-
 istic shape besides     being  larger
 generally than the female hand,
 and however skilful the actor,
 close observation will often enable
 one to detect the difference. How-
 ever, it is not an infallible rule.
 The hands of Mei Lan Fang for
 example  are  quite indistinguish-
 able from those of a woman on
 the stage.
 It must be confessed that the
 great impersonators appear bless-
 ed with  physical  characteristics
 most necessary for their art. The
 suppleness of the Chinese hand
 is notable.
 Chinese, on the whole male and
 female, are born with small and
 naturally graceful hands and the
 rigid  physical  training  of  the
 actor develops this advantage to
 the utmost.  It casts no reflection
 on the art of the impersonator to
 note that the heavy make-up and
 concealing costume of the female
 roles are factors in his favour in
 a way no feminine costume could
 ever be in the West.
 It is probable that the tradition
 of the female impersonator will
 die. hard upon the Chinese stage,
 but it would  appear  inevitable
 that  the actress, who has now
 come to  stay,  will  eventually
 usurp the boards completely.  On
 the other hand we have the ac-
 tresses who play male parts, quite
 common within recent    decades,
 and possibly a legacy from the
 times when they were still not
 allowed to perform . in company
 with actors.
 OF WOMEN
 Some  of  these actresses are
 equally adept in male or female
 roles and their versatility and skill
 is quite astonishing.  Two  well
 known artistes may..be named in
 the personalities of Miss Tung
 Chili Ling of Peking, and Miss Li
 Hui Fang of Shanghai,-the draw-
 ing of the Lao Sheng                                                                                                  in  the
 second article in this series was
 done from a sketch made at a
 performance by the latter actress.
 Many of the smaller touring
 companies possess actresses who
 specialise in male parts.  In the

 Nanking-Shanghai area it is com-
 mon to find companies, playing the
 more localised Shao-Hsing drama,
 composed solely of women.
 All  feminine  parts  on  the
 Chinese stage are classed under a
 broad heading  known as Tan.
 This heading is subdivided into
 various types of Tan according to
 the  different  kinds of women
 portrayed. One of the most im-
 portant  of  these  types is the
 Ch'ing tan or Ch'ing-i.  This is
 the part which represents charac-
 ters such as the virtuous wife or
 faithful lover.  The Ch'ing-i  is
 demure and  reserved in move-
 ment, the hands are kept in a
 graceful or dignified position and
 much play is given to the "rip-
 pling water sleeve", the long false
 white silk sleeve attached to the
 cuffs of the jacket.
 Short mincing steps characterise
 the walk, the feet are kept close
 to the ground and there is an air
 of fluttering tremulousness about
 the. whole part. A very important
 feature is the singing.  No actor
 or actress can hope to obtain suc-
 cess in this role without an excel-
 lent singing voice.
 The most famous Ch'ing-i parts
 are noted for long arias, plain-
 tive in tone,  their  drawn  out,
 trembling note of sorrow is one
 of the very characteristic sounds
 of the Northern stage. A typical
 costume worn in the role consists
 of a three quarter length black
 satin jacket with a high collar and
 "rippling  water sleeves."   The
 whole  jacket  is edged with a
 broad border of blue silk with
 narrow white piping on the edges.
 Beneath this is worn a long white
 skirt pleated at either side, the
 feet are hidden from view except
 for the occasional peeping through
 of the tasselled pom pom on the
 toe of the brocaded flat soled shoe.
 A white sash is often worn
 round the waist and a turquoise
 blue sash bound round  the  head
 which is set with plain silver orna-
 ments. Sometimes a second pleat-
 ed skirt is fastened high round the
 waist, the ends attached by a small
 ring to the little  finger of each
 hand.  A series of delicate'move-
 ments                        representing sorrow  and
 anguish  are     performed in this
 costume.
 The hair is dressed in a style
 known as "Nu Fa Liu" and based
 on  an   ancient  coiffure.  It is
 characterised by a long narrow
 "bun" at the back and 'a loose tail
 of hair hanging down at the side
 of - the face-.  The brow , is set
 round with seven small flat' coils
 of hair kept in place with fixatif
 and two long sidepieces curved to
 fit round either cheek.
 This hairdo, which is a com-
 plicated process that takes one
 hour to complete in the green-
 room, is the basic hair style for a
 large proportion of other feminine
 roles, variations being obtained by
 56e#-/ ' /6   /ID
 adding artificial flowers, elaborate
 pins, slides and brilliants.
 Tan parts are often dressed in
 costume which is more or less a
 replica of the old Manchu ladies
 costume of pre-1911 days.  The
 elaborate headdress and coiffure
 known as the "Liang Pa T'ou",
 the long collarless Manchu robe

 and the curious stilt like shoes,
 are reminiscent of such well loved
 plays  as "Ssu  Lang T'an  Mu,
 (How Yang Yen Hui visited his
 mother), which was recently seen
 in Hong Kong with Chang Chun
 Ch'iu as the Iron Princess.
 The Manchu costume has only
 been used on the stage since its
 disappearance in real life. Ssu
 Lang T'an Mu, for instance, is a
 play about the Sung dynasty and
 is a good example of the little im-
 portance  attached  to                        historical
 accuracy   in   Chinese  stage
 technique. The  Cantonese  ap-
 pear to have a strong penchant
 for  Manchu style costumes  in
 their own contemporary drama.
 A make-up common to all Tan
 parts on the Peking stage is as
 follows.  First a dead white back-
 ground is smeared over all the
 face and the cheeks are then pow-
 dered in with pale magenta, grad-
 ed off towards the mouth and chin
 which,  with  the  nose, are ! left
 white. The lips are painted and the
 surroundings of the eyes powder-
 ed a deep crimson.                     Eyebrows are
 pencilled and elongated in black.
 The eyes are drawn up from the
 outside corners by a tape which
 has previously been tightly drawn
 round  the  temples  under  the
 foundation of the coiffure, this
 gives the "almond-eye" appearance
 so characteristic on the stage.
 Other important Tan parts are
 the Hua Tan, Wu Tan and Lao
 Tan.   The  Hua  Tan  portrays
 characters such as the courtesan
 or  the  amourous maidservant.
 The Hua Tan relies more on skill
 in acting than singing, although
 the latter too is often necessary.
 The Hua Tan is full of charm and
 seduction, she invariably holds a
 large silk handkerchief, and the
 fluttering eyes and coquettish by-
 play behind this when a famous
 Hua Tan comes on is one of, the
 high lights of the Chinese stage.
 The costumes of the Hua Tan
 are characterised  by  their rich
 colour and embroidery, they are
 indeed often garments of great
 beauty.  The headdress is gener-
 ally adorned with a profusion of
 flowers and gay brilliants which
 catch the light in every direction.
 A common costume of the Hua
 Tan playing maid servant is that
 of the jacket and wide trousers,
 often boldly patterned with flow-
 ers.  Sometimes a short apron is
 worn over this tied at the back
 with a bow. It is in the Hua Tan
 parts that the Tz'u Ch'iao are
 seen, the special footwear consist-
 ing of small wooden false feet
 which are bound to the actors own
 feet, to simulate the bound feet of
 former times.  A remarkable fea-
 ture of stage technique they are
 less seen today and will probably
 evenutally die out.
 In the past some of the most
 famous Hua Tans have been male
 impersonators,  a  never  failing
 source of delight to their audien-
 ces.                                                      A Chinese writer quotes the
 anecdote of the celebrated imper-
 A Nanking Actress
 (Ching-I head-dress)
 sonator who, when embarking on
 one of his stage flirtations, called
 up to the gallery "Pull down the
 blinds quickly, can't you see what
 I'm about".
 The Wu-tan represents a mili-
 tary maiden, a martial princess or
 female bandit.  The feminine vir-
 tues are very often combined with
 those of more forceful character.
 They are skilled in acrobatics and
 stage fighting. They make great
 play with swords and lances and
 their cosutmes are often charac-
 terised by long sweeping pheasant
 feathers in their headdress.
 The Lao-Tan represents the old
 woman of the stage. The costume
 is unvarying.  A grey wig is worn
 done in a tight knot or bun above
 the crown.  A bandeau is worn
 round the brow.  The face is not
 made  up.   The  three  quarter
 length tunic and skirt are gener-
 ally in sombre                                                             colours, ochres,
 whites, greys and black.  Always
 a heavy staff is carried in the
 right hand.  The Lao Tan walks
 with bent back and faltering step.
 It is a singing role and requires
 an individual vocal tchnique. Good
 actors of this part are said to be
 rare.
 The most famous Lao Tans have
 been men. One of the best known
 was an actor named Kung Yun-fu,
 who  was  celebrated in Peking
 30 years  ago for the innova-
 tions he introduced in the part.
 founding a school cons-dered to be
 the best of its kind.  In the play
 "Hsu Mu Ma Ts'ao"      (Hsu Shu's
 Mother reviling Ts'ao Ts'ao") the
 Lao Tan plays the part of a scold-
 ing old woman pouring invective
 on the traitorous prime Minister's
 head. The interpretation of an old
 lady's anger by a skilled Lao Tan
 always receives keen appreciation
 by a critical audience.
 Sheng is the heading used to
 describe all  male  parts.  It  is
 again   subdivided  into  various
 types of Sheng to portray differ-
 ent kinds of men.                                                                                        In general the
 Sheng characters    wear  beards,
 except the  Hsiao          Sheng, who
 plays parts   such as the youth-
 ful                                                                                             scholar      or  young  lover.
 The  Hsiao  Sheng          speaks  and
 sings falsetto, a peculiarity of the
 role, and always carries a   fan.
 Flirting with  the fan is a not-
 able part of his stage technique.
 A  typical  costume consists of
 scarlet silk trousers tucked into
 the  high    "Kuan  Hsieh", boots
 made of black satin with th'ck
 white soles about 3" high.   Over
 these  is  worn the "Ch'en-i" a
 long,  decoratively  embroidered,
 silk or satin robe with cut away
 neck beneath which a white stock
 shows. Favourite colours are pale
 blue, pink and lilac.  The hat is
 an ornate affair known as "Wen
 Sheng Chin", it has a long silken
 tassel hanging down at either side
 over  the  shoulder.   The facial
 make-up is "`pink and white" with
 eyes bound back, as described in
 the Ch'ing-i make-up, to represent
 a youthful countenance.
 Two  other       important Sheng
 types  are  Wu  Sheng and Lao
 Sheng. The former plays military
 heroes and high ranking generals,
 is majestic in bearing and must be
 skilled in  gymnastics  and the
 highly developed  technique  of
 stage  fighting.  The Wu  Sheng
 often wears a full beard of black,
 grey or white.    Costume consists
 of the "K'ai", the ornate military
 costume representing armour on
 the Chinese stage. Four decorative

 flags are strapped over the back of
 the  shoulders.   Heavy  swords,
 lances and pikes are wielded in
 vigorous fashion.
 Perhaps one of the most famous
 of Sheng roles is Lao Sheng, the
 middle-aged scholar or statesman.
 Characteristic dress is the hard
 double crowned hat with two stiff
 "wings" protruding at the sides.
 A long robe, richly embroidered, is
 worn over the scarlet trousers and
 high boots also common to the
 Hsiao Sheng.  Round the waist,
 hanging  loose is a large  stiff
 girdle decorated  with brilliants
 and known as the "Yu Tai" or
 jade girdle. A long beard, gener-
 ally  black,                     dividing into three
 parts is always worn by the Lao
 Sheng.
 A good actor must be a singer
 of high order, his action, subtle
 in character, must be in accord
 with the music and the emotion
 of the part down to the glance of
 an eye and the slight bend of the
 body.  A first class Lao Sheng
 performance is very   often  con-
 sidered  the  peak of theatrical
 entertainment by      a   Chinese
 audience.
 The stately stride, subtle pos-
 turing and individual singing of
 the Lao Sheng,  long  after  per-
 formances have receded into the
 past, linger in the memory as the
 essence of all that characterises
 the Chinese stage.  One of    the
 most  popular actors  of    Sheng 3
 roles in Peking in the old days
 was Ma Lien Liang, who still on
 occasion  can  be  seen in per--
 formances in Hong Kong.
 A third role which stands apart,
 unique in the Classical, theatre, is
 the  Ching,  or Painted Face, so
 called from   the  variety of in-
 tricate and startling patterns with
 which the faces of these actors are
 painted in brilliant colours.
 .  Representing warriors, brigands
 and adventurers they roar their
 way across the stage in a fury of
 sound, colour and vigorous action.
 The face designs are symbolical,
 and indicative of the character of
 the personality portrayed, various
 colours  are  used to implement
 these meanings.  Red symbolises
 fidelity, blue  fierceness,   white
 treachery and so on.
 The designs, some of which are
 extremely complicated,  are  ap-
 plied by the                          actors   themselves
 with a brush.   They are executed
 with scrupulous care and atten-
 tion to accuracy of detail.  There
 are several hundred different de-
 signs,  although  some are more
 commonly used than  others and
 the actor who plays painted face
 parts must be well versed in the
 many variations.
 The painted face actor is bold
 and swaggering in movement. His
 voice is full and raucous, rising
 to  protracted  enunciation  of
 tremendous  volume.  It has an
 aural quality which is quite as-
 tounding.  Wearing a full beard
 with often two tufts of hair stand-
 Ma Lien Liang
 (in costume)
 ink up above the ears like devils
 horns, he rolls his eyes and twirls
 his whiskers in a fine frenzy, until
 the air vibrates with the force of
 his personality.
 A famous painted face charac-
 ter is the brigand named Tou Erb
 Tun in the play "Stealing the Em-
 peror's Horse".  His long beard
 is red and his face is blue lined
 with red black and white, above
 his eyes two hooked swords are
 painted to show his dexterity with
 these  weapons.   He  wears  a
 scarlet lined coat of brilliant blue
 and presents a figure magnificent
 in its savage appeal.
 Lastly we have the Ch'ou, the
 comedian  or  clown,  the jester
 beloved of all drama through the
 ages.  The Ch'ou speaks in collo-
 quial idiom and improvises as he
 goes along.   Often his allusions
 are topical.  He  takes  the au-
 dience into his confidence with his
 sly leer, ribald jest and crocodile
 tears.  He plays the part of ser-
 vant, waiter, priest, go between,
 stupid minister or foolish general.
 His face is always painted with a
 white patch.around the nose and
 eyes and lips thickened with the
 same colour. Sometimes he wears
 ridiculous  dangling whiskers or
 protruding moustaches.   His eyes
 are  black   crosses  or  oblique
 squares, he bats them continuously
 as he shuffles along with buffoon's
 gait.  He is one with the universal
 brotherhood of the fool.
 The characters of the Chinese
 drama pass across the stage in a
 kaleidoscope of rich humanity. In
 an essay such as this it is only
 possible to touch upon them in all
 their  variety  in  the  briefest
 fashion. The proverb runs "There
 is nothing so vast as a stage, a
 world  can be seen  within    its
 limits".

 the wisdom of the Chinese people,
 and was a great master of rites,
 music,  archery,  chariot-driving,
 caligraphy, arithmetic and other
 honoured arts.
 As a sage he practised the five
 human virtues; love, righteousness,

 and the learned.

 a tour in the United States and is
 living among his people to bear
 witness to the very blood and
 flesh of this great sage, who has
 achieved the real unification of
 China.  He is commonly referred
 to as the Su-wang or "Uncrowned
 Emperor".
 The importance of Confucius in
 the development of Chinese cul-
 ture  cannot  be  underestimated.
 But historical research in recent
 years has revealed the fact that
 Confucius was but  a  school
 teacher whose life was a failure
 in every sense of the word. The
 colour of his success, the glory of
 his deeds and the light of his
 virtues were mostly the invention
 and fabrication of later centuries.
 It  brings  forward  a  most
 puzzling riddle in Chinese history,
 "How could a plain and common
 schoolteacher become the greatest
 hero of the world's oldest and
 largest state?"  No one can really
 understand China without under-
 standing how the people came to
 worship Confucius.
 Very Poor
 Confucius was born into the
 family  of  a  common.  working
 man.   The date of his birth has
 been  lost  in the  mist of  his
 childhood days.  In the past, it
 was officially fixed on the 27th
 day of the 8th moon, but in recent
 years the Nationalist Government
 considers it more convenient to
 observe August 27 in the new
 calendar.
 The K'ung family was said to
 have come from a noble house
 of the Shang dynasty (1766?-1122
 B.C.), which ruled over the North
 China  Plain  in  the . dawn  of
 Chinese history and was respon-
 sible for the building of Chinese
 culture. The Shang people were
 conquered by the Chou people in
 1122 B.C., and Confucius' ances-
 tors were obliged to stay in exile
 in the State of Sung, which was
 located in modern Eastern Honan.
 The family lived there for almost
 600 years.
 Some time in the sixth century
 B.C., Father Su-liang Ho found
 life in Sung unbearable for him.
 He took his family with him to
 take up a job in a royal house-
 hold in the State of Lu, in modern
 Shantung.  They were very poor
 and young K'ung too, was engaged
 to work for their royal master,
 sometimes as a granary keeper
 and sometimes as a cattle tender.
 Associations  with  the  royal
 household gave young K'ung the
 opportunity to  educate himself.
 You probably know that in the
 early and middle parts of the
 Chou   dynasty  (1122-221  B.C.)
 there existed two cultural centres
 in China: one in the City of Chou,
 the Imperial Capital, in modern
 Lo-yang; and the other in the
 City of Lu, in modern Ch'u-fu.
 The Royal House of the Lu
 State  belonged  to  the  Chou
 imperial family. The hereditary
 nobility maintained the cultural
 standard of the day, and their
 courts displayed all the grace and
 splendour of ancient rituals and
 ceremonies.   Young  Kung  was
 greatly impressed by these aged
 old traditions and began to study
 them with great enthusiasm.
 He was diligent and industrious,
 and in a few years he mastered
 the six classics and all the court
 etiquette,  state  ceremonies  and
 the proper conduct of individuals,
 which  had  been  handed      down
 from bygone ages in the royal
 household.  After this he managed
 to take a trip to continue his
 study  in  the  Imperial Capital.

 When he returned from the Chou
 capital, he was indeed a learned
 man.  He started a school in his
 home for the elucidation of the
 classics and the transmission of
 the moral principles of conduct.
 He taught any one who       could
 afford to pay tuition fee.
 His Exile
 It was  a  period of  political
 unrest and social disorder.  Con-
 fucius took, as his platform, social
 and political stability through the
 maintenance         of the established
 order, and advocated esteem for
 age over youth, for the past over
 the present and established, au-
 thority  over  innovation.                             The
 golden age of the bygone past
 became his Utopia.  Confucius was
 a returned student from abroad
 and many students came to him
 from all walks of life.
 When he was 35 years old, a
 revolution broke out in the State
 of Lu.  King  Chao-kung  was
 expelled by his three ministers
 and was obliged to seek refuge in
 the  State of Ch'i,  in modern
 Northern Shantung.   The re-
 bellious behavior of the ministers
 greatly annoyed the school-teacher
 and he volunteered to accompany
 the king in his exile.
 The political theories and social
 conducts advocated by the school
 teacher attracted the admiration
 of the royal houses of Ch'i and
 Lu.  So when he returned to his
 native state, several years later,
 he was appointed to the minister-
 ship of Ta-ssu-k'u.  His service
 in the government gave Confucius
 a chance of plotting the destruc-
 tion  of  the   three  rebellious
 ministers. The conspiracy, unfor-
 tunately, was revealed, and the
 scholar-minister was  obliged to
 leave the country  once more.
 With a handful of his disciples
 he wandered from state to state
 advocating his ideals and seeking
 appointment to other offices.
 It is most interesting to note
 that he visited only some of the
 small feudal states, namely Wei,
 Ch'en,  Ts'ai,  Sung  and  Cheng.
 Sometime in the 7th century B.C.,
 the State of Wei was overrun by
 a nomadic horde, the Northern Ti,
 and the Duke of Ch'i, being the
 leader of the feudal states at that
 time,  was  obliged to  give  the
 unfortunate people a new home
 further South, where his army
 could guarantee their safety.'
 History records that it was an
 easy job for the Duke, because the
 whole population of Wei state,
 young and old, rich and poor,
 amounted to only 3,79 individuals.
 One can readily see how small
 these states were.
 Wherever he went, Confucius
 preached his political theories. He
 believed only in achieving social
 stability   by   maintaining   the
 established order. His active poli-
 tical  tour  proved  a                                                             complete
 failure. Several  feudal  lords
 listened to him but no one cared
 to accept his counsel.
 His Failure
 In this time of political expan-
 sion  what  they needed was                                                              a
 strong  army to  protect  their
 borders. So, after many years of
 fruitless wandering, Confucius re-
 turned to his native home in Lu,
 disappointed and exhausted.  He
 was already an old man of 68 and
 had no alternative but to resume
 his teaching activities as before.
 The remaining years of his life
 were uneventful and rather miser-
 able.  Confucius died at the age
 of  73 with  a  handful  of  his
 favorite disciples around him. He
 passed away as a common school
 teacher.
 There is    no  doubt  that Con-
 fucius was a learned man.                                                                  He
 knew the classics well.  He was
 sincere in what he was preaching
 and stubborn in his way of think-
 ing and belief.  The chief cause
 of his failure might be attributed
 to the political and social changes
 that were dominating the main
 current of his time, and these,
 the  school teacher  refused  to
 acknowledge and to understand.
 It may be worthwhile to point
 out that Chinese society before
 the time of Confucius was or-
 ganised  under       two                                                           institutions:
 the family system, established by
 the Shang people and the feudal
 system, first introduced by Chou
 Kung, one of the founders of the
 Chou dynasty. The family was
 the social unit and the responsible
 element in the political life of a
 feudal state.
 The feudal lords, chiefly mem-
 bers of the imperial family, were
 appointed by the imperial court,
 and they went out to their respec-
 tive states to rule over the land
 and population of their localities.
 The  filial  piety  and  obedience
 developed in the family, became
 the basis of loyalty and dutiful-
 ness                                                       to  the  feudal  lord.         The
 family was a microcosm, a state
 in miniature.
 The power pattern in these two
 systems agreed with each other,
 though not on the same      scale.
 The father was a supreme auto-
 crat in the family with full control
 over the use of all property, and
 all members, including his wife
 and children.  The feudal lord
 exercised the same supreme auto-
 cracy in his state and over his
 people.
 This was the established order,
 pure  and  simple,  and  it  kept
 the country peaceful and stable
 for   almost  600   years.   This
 was. what Confucius had learned
 from the classics and he would
 have liked to adhere to it.  But
 since the beginning of the 7th
 century  B.C.,  a  new political
 system had been coming on the
 scene.  Some of the large feudal
 states, especially Ch'i, Chin, Ch'in
 and Ch'u, began their programme
 of expansion.
 Merely Thieves
 The Imperial House of Chou
 existed only in name. Large-scale
 military operations and territorial
 annexations gave rise to a political
 organisation far larger and more
 complicated than the old feudal
 system.   Relations  between  the
 lords and their subjects became
 indirect, and  governing   relied
 more on the enforcement of laws
 and regulations than on personal
 adjustment and compromise. More-
 over, trade and industry increased
 and stimulated the concentration
 of people in commercial and in-
 dustrial centres, which were fast
 developing into large cities.
 The simple ways and stable life
 were  replaced  by  war   and
 struggle.  Confucius could not see
 any good in this new development
 and he set out bravely to hold
 the tide.  This was why he found
 no place for himself in the large
 states.  He failed in his political
 mission because he was a reaction-
 ary and could not adjust himself
 to this new environment.
 To Confucius  the world  was
 simply chaotic. People were not
 behaving according to the prin-
 ciples described in the classics.
 Kings were unkingly and ministers
 rebellious; fathers were unfatherly
 and sons merely thieves.  He set
 out to save the age-old tradition
 and social order, but he was a
 common person and had no way
 of obtaining political power and
 position except  by talking  and
 preaching.  This was something
 unheard of before.  So in the eyes
 of his contemporaries Confucius
 and his disciples were a school of
 very queer fish. Their behaviour
 was not only new but strange to
 them.
 After some careful observation
 of Confucius, Yen Ying, the well-
 known minister and diplomat of
 Ch'i remarked:
 "As to this group of Confucian
 scholars, they are polished and
 cunning, living beyond the law.
 They  are  proud  and  self-
 confident and cannot be em-
 ployed as subordinates.                                                                                                     They
 advocate  the  importance    of
 death, mourning and grief, and
 insist on spending the family
 fortune on a pompous funeral;
 how can one introduce such a
 custom!   They wander about,
 `talking and preaching, begging
 and borrowing; how can they
 run a state!"  (Shih-chi, Shih-
 chia ch. 17, P. 5.)

 Chiian.g  Tzu's story  of  Con-
 fucius' visit to the Captain of a
 robber band was most dramatic:
 "Robber Che  had     just en-
 camped to the South of T'ai-
 shan,                         and  was  engaged      in
 devouring  a dish  of    minced
 human liver. Confucius alighted
 from his chariot, and advancing
 addressed  the  door-keeper  as
 follows:
 Like Stars
 'I am Confucius of the Lu State.
 I have heard of the high char-
 acter of your captain.'
 He  then  twice  respectfully
 saluted the  door-keeper  who
 went in to announce his arrival.
 When Robber Che heard who
 Emperor
 it was, he was furious.  His
 eyes glared like stars.  His hair
 (stood on ends and) raised his
 cap from his head as he cried
 out, 'What! that crafty scoundrel
 Confucius of Lu?  Go tell him
 from  me  that  he is    a  mere
 word-mongerer.  That he talks
 nonsense about Wen Wang and
 Wu Wang.  That he wears an
 extravagant cap, with a thong
 from the side of a dead ox.
 That what he says is mostly
 rhodomontade.   That he con-
 sumes where he does not sow
 and wears clothes he does not
 weave.  That his lips patter and
 his  tongue  wags,    That  his
 rights and wrongs are of his
 own coining, whereby he throws
 dust in the eyes of rulers and
 prevents  the  scholars  of  the
 empire from reverting to the
 original  source  of all things.
 That  he  makes    a  great stir
 about filial piety and brotherly
 love, glad enough     himself to
 secure some fat fief or post of
 power.    Tell   him  that    he
 deserves the worst, and that if
 he does not take himself off,
 his liver shall be in my morning
 stew'."   (Giles    translation,
 p.388-9).
 The  Lun-yii  or  "Analects   of
 Confucius"  records  another   in-
 teresting story:
 "Once when Tzu-lu (one of
 Confucius' favourite  disciples)
 was following (the master) he
 fell behind and met an old man
 carrying a basket slung over his
 staff.  Tzu-lu asked him, saying,
 'Sir, have you seen my master?'
 The old man said, 'You mean
 the one who does not toil with
 his four limbs and cannot dis-
 tinguish the five grains (millet,
 hempseed, wheat, rice and pea)
 to be your master?'  And with
 that he planted his staff in the
 ground  and  began    weeding,
 while Tzu-lu stood by with his
 hands pressed together." (ch.4,
 p.7:  cf.  Waley's  translation,
 P-220).
 Contemporary  criticisms  like
 those quoted above can easily be
 multiplied, It is most interesting
 to find how different was the
 picture of Confucius before the
 Han dynasty, from what we have
 in later centuries.  His contem-
 poraries had not indeed a very
 high opinion of the school teacher.
 The behaviour of Confucius has
 been  summarised     by  Ssu-ma
 Ch'ien, the Herodotus of China,
 who wrote in the second century
 B.C.:
 "When he was in his native
 village, he bore himself with
 simplicity, as if he had no gifts
 of speech.  But when in the
 ancestral temple or at court, he
 expressed himself readily and
 clearly, yet with a measure of
 reserve.  At court, when con-
 versing with the higher great.
 officials, he spoke respectfully.
 When conversing with the lower
 officials, he spoke out boldly..
 When  he  entered  the  palace
 gate, he  appeared  to  stoop.
 When he hastened forward, if
 was with a respectful appear-
 ance.                                                                                                 When the 'prince sum-
 moned him to receive a visitor,,
 his expression seemed to change..
 When his prince commanded his
 presence, he did not wait for
 the carriage to be yoked, but
 went off on foot.  He would not
 taste anything that were not
 properly cut,  as if they were
 something like rotten  fish or
 spoiled meat, and could not sit

 on  his  mat  unless  it ' was
 properly placed." (op. cit, p.25;
 cf. Bodde's translation quoted in
 Fairbank's  The  United  States
 and China, p.63-4).
 Queer Habits
 This  sounds  as  if  that  the
 wandering school teacher    had
 several sets of faces in dealing
 with people and had all sorts of
 queer habits. Nothing could be
 more appropriate than this passage
 to describe the old roguishness of
 a highly polished official of our
 own days.
 Some lovers of Confucius may
 say that these criticisms of Con-
 fucius are totally unfair.  This
 wise man from Lu,  they may
 maintain,  wrote  six books to
 transmit his doctrine and these
 have been handed down to us as
 our classical canon. Nothing in
 Chinese history is more mislead-
 ing  than                       this  statement. The
 Chinese  Classics   were  not'' the
 work of Confucius. The scholar
 himself confessed that he could
 only talk and converse and had
 never written anything in his' life.
 Recent   historical research  and
 textural criticism have led us to
 the conclusions that the Book of
 Changes was the record of the
 official diviners;  the  Book  of
 History, a selection of historical
 documents of ancient dynasties;
 the Book of Odes, an anthology of
 folk poems and hymns used in the
 ancestral temples;  the  Books of
 Rites and Music a collection of
 programmes  of  ceremonies    and
 regulations for     proper conduct
 which may have been laid down
 by Chou Kung, in the beginning
 of the  Chou dynasty;  and the
 Spring  and   Autumn      Annals,
 chronicles of the State of Lu.
 Confucius did not take part in
 any of these compositions.
 Many of them were in existence
 before him.  In fact, he educated
 himself in these  ancient works
 and used these books as texts in
 his courses of instruction.  Lovers
 of Confucius have over-estimated
 They may, however, insist that
 Confucius achieved at least one
 thing.  He maintained the largest
 school of his time with an enrol-
 ment                          of  3,000  students,  and
 72  of  them  mastered  the, six
 classics. Any one with a little
 common sense will see that'; the
 figure has been greatly exagge-
 rated.                          How could the State of
 Lu, which had a a population no
 larger than a small hsien city of
 modern  times,  accommodate  a
 school three times the size of the
 University of Hong Kong with
 only one professor, not to mention
 that the humble home of Con-
 fucius itself was supposed to have
 housed the students.
 The glaring fact was that Con-
 fucius  failed  miserably  in  his
 profession.  He  could not find
 jobs  for    his students.  Not a
 single one of them achieved any-
 thing worth-mentioning.  The best
 and most clever of them all was
 Yen Hui.     He was so miserably
 poor, for lack of finding something
 to do, that he had to be contented
 with a ladleful of thin soup and
 a dish of plain rice a day.
 Some doctors presume that this
 favourite  disciple  of Confucius
 suffered  from  malnutrition  and
 was  destroyed  by  tuberculosis.
 But it seems more reasonable to
 suggest that he died of starvation.
 The  facts do not    allow us to
 over-estimate either the number
 or the ability of Confucius' dis-
 ciples.
 A Job
 I- have gone into considerable
 detail to urge that the ability of
 Confucius and his disciples shall
 not be over-estimated, but I do not
 mean   to     under-estimate   the
 achievements  of  the          Confucian
 School,   which   did          in   later
 centuries become  the  core            of
 Chinese civilisation,. and it was
 quite natural and appropriate that
 the founder of the school should
 be enthroned as the "'Uncrowned
 Emperor".
 In the very out-set we must
 agree that Confucius was the first
 educationalist that China has ever
 produced.  Before him, knowledge
 was a sign of nobility and learning
 was  a   monopoly  of  the  royal
 household.
 Confucius was not only one of
 the first of the common people to
 have a chance of receiving such an
 education, but also the first to
 bring this education to the general
 public.  He created a job. for him-
 self  and  started  the  teaching
 profession in China.  He taught
 any one regardless of his class and
 profession, provided he could pay
 a tuition fee. He invented this
 new system without' realising that
 it was revolutionary in nature.
 He took the classics from the royal
 household to teach the common
 people.
 Education gave them knowledge
 and opened their eyes.  To use
 an up-to-date expression, this was
 indeed a great liberation for the
 people.
 Confucius,  however,   had  his
 own plan to carry out.  He was
 a man of ambition who set out to
 hold the current of his time. He
 was himself a common man with
 no backing of any kind, so by
 opening  a  school  he  aimed to
 produce a group of followers to
 assist him in case he had a chance
 of attaining power and position.
 This he did, and his ? students
 actually followed   him   in  his
 political tours.  He had, indeed,
 introduced a brand new way of
 achieving  power  and  position,
 characterised by as much travel-
 ling and speech-making as the
 American   politicians use    in
 modern times.  What an ingenious
 device!
 Confucius never  realised that
 his  new  profession  helped  to
 accelerate the great  social and
 political change that had captured
 his time and that he refused to
 accept.   He had    unconsciously
 created a new class of people.
 From the beginning of Chinese
 history in the time of the Shang
 and Chou dynasties, there existed
 a  marked  stratification in the
 social and political set-up of the
 country.   On the  top  was  the
 nobility   who  ruled  over  the
 common people below.    The latter
 were classified into four groups
 according  to  their  professions,
 namely, the soldier, the farmer,
 the artisan, and the merchant.
 Chief Aim
 Confucius' school  produced  a
 new group of people who had
 their roots in the lower stratum
 but received an education funda-
 mentally in the aristocratic tradi-
 tion.  Their job was only to read
 the classics and when they had
 mastered  them  they        had  two
 professions opened for them. They
 could  either  become  teachers
 themselves and teach those who
 could pay tuition fee or receive
 an appointment  in  the govern-
 ment and become officials.                                                                                                The
 latter would  give them  wealth
 and honour.   This was a calling
 of double profession, the scholar-
 official.
 Confucius himself did not profit
 much  by  this  new institution.
 But the system became the foun-
 dation ? of Chinese education.                                                                                              For
 more than 24 centuries schools
 and  colleges  developed  in  the
 country and they remained funda-
 mentally   Confucian                                                                                                           in prin-
 ciple and in practice. The Classics
 have always been used as text-
 books and to become an official
 has  been the  chief       aim. An
 alternative profession has always
 been very handy; one could revert
 to teaching when one failed in
 officialdom.
 It is important to note that the
 work  of a  scholar-official is  a
 very simple and easy job.  In the
 Han   dynasty,  any  one       who
 mastered one classic would be-
 come a po-ssu or "learned scholar",
 and a candidate for many im-
 portant posts in the government.
 In later centuries any one capable
 of  writing  a  simple,  straight-
 forward essay would be considered
 a man of learning and fit for
 appointment.  There was no need
 for any other training.

 In the last hundred years, many
 new subjects  have  been intro-
 duced into the modern school, but
 the teaching of the classics and
 the aim and function of the school
 or university have remained un-
 changed.  After four years in the
 university, a student will receive
 the bachelor's degree, and he will
 then consider himself a man of
 learning, and many will refuse to
 take up any other job than teach-
 ing                 or    becoming  an  official.
 Physically and mentally,  he  is
 developed   in ? the Confucian
 pattern.                   ,
 After a few years in official
 service, he will behave in the
 same fashion as did Confucius two
 millenia  ago.   There  will  be
 nothing  to  prevent  him   from
 worshipping the teacher as the
 "Master of All Ages".
 The success of the Confucian
 School in the imperial govern-
 ment has been far -more spectacu-
 lar than it has been in education.
 It is one of the strangest facts
 in Chinese history that the Con-
 fucian school, destined to become
 the most powerful political group
 in the Far East, did not have a
 .single  influential man  in ? the
 government when Emperor Kao-
 tsu of Han unified China again
 in 206 B.C. after the fall of the
 Ch'in dynasty.
 Any      man   living in the  3rd
 century  B.C.  who  ventured   to
 predict  that  the  school  would
 become, in time, the dominating
 power in China would have been
 considered slightly crazy.
 Political Power
 The country had been suffering
 from wars and disorder through-
 out                 the      last  300  years.    The
 Confucian,   the   Mo   Ti,   the
 Yang Chu, the Tao-chia, the Fa-
 chia and a dozen of other schools
 had  been  advocating   means  of
 bringing social order out of the
 chaos of the late Chou period.
 The  competition  among them
 was keen.  The political power
 finally went into the hands of the
 Fa-chia or "Legalists" who were
 the  champions of violent  dicta-
 torial methods and cherished a
 philosophy of absolutism.    They
 succeeded in helping the rulers of
 the Ch'in State to swallow all the
 other   states and unified    the
 country under the Ch'in dynasty.
 In 221 B.C. the Legalist minister,
 Li Ssu, in a. sweeping gesture of
 authority, issued a. proclamation
 that all books and histories other
 than those of the Legalist should
 be destroyed by fire.   The Con-
 fucian scholars were left without
 any books to teach their students.
 A  few  years  later,  Emperor
 Shih-huang"-ti of Ch'iri visited Lu,
 the centre of the Confucian school.

 scholars was most unpleasant, and
 in his fury, he buried many of
 them alive.
 Emperor Kao-tsu of Han was
 famous for his contempt of the
 Confucianists,  and  one  day he
 actually threw one of their hats
 on the ground and contaminated
 it with his own bodily refuse.
 Very few people. had any high
 opinion of these scholars.
 Emueror  Kao-tsu  although  a
 rascal, was shrewd and ambitious.
 ,After years of hard struggle, he
 conquered the whole nation and
 brought the gigantic empire under
 his heel. But he found himself
 immediately confronted with the
 problem of governing.  Hecon-
 quered the empire on horse-back,
 but he could not rule his people
 from the back of the animal. The
 world had been  in  a  state of
 chaos and disorder for more than
 300 years; peace and order were
 essential to his people if he was
 to keep the throne.
 The decentralised feudalism of
 ancient China had already given
 away to an imperial government.
 Emperor  Kao-tsu  tried  to  re-
 introduce the feudal system but
 it proved to be a great handicap
 to his imperial reign.
 Emperor  Kao-tsu  could: not
 adopt the gospel of Mo Ti and
 practise the principles of Chien-ai
 or "Universal. Love" and Shang-
 hsien or "sharing the empire with
 saintly sages".  It was impossible
 for a rascal to sacrifice his own
 interest and abdicate for the good
 of his people.
 On the other hand, being the
 owner of a huge empire, Emperor
 Kao-tsu  could  not be  as  self-
 centred as the Yang Chu philo-
 sophers                           advocated.   How   could
 such a wealthy figure refuse to
 pluck a hair for the benefit of his
 subjects?  That would be hope-
 lessly selfish and too low a taste
 for an emperor.
 The Legalists
 Taoism was  also  out  of  the
 question.  Kao-tsu was a man of
 action and he could not allow his
 people to retire to the state of
 passivity        as  expressed in the
 philosophy in Wu-wei or "Effort-
 lessness".                             Neither could he adopt
 the theory that all things were
 created  equal. ' That        was  an
 outrageous idea and it would lead
 his country into anarchy.
 The emperor *as in favour of
 the Legalists. Their philosophy of
 absolutism  and their  dictatorial
 methods were very much to his
 taste.  But history gave him a
 clear-cut warning.  The Legalists
 had landed the Ch'in Empire upon
 the rocks and that had happened
 only 15 years earlier.  He could
 not give his people another dose
 of tyranny.
 The  principles  of   Confucian
 government seemed to be most
 appealing after. all. Emperor Kao-
 tsu was wise enough to ignore the
 queerness of these scholars whom
 he used to despise and he brought
 their  philosophy  into  practice.
 Confucianism was then still in its
 theoretical  stage, and  it  took
 several      decades  to  formulate a
 practical programme of govern-
 ment.
 The        principles of Confucian
 government were based primarily
 on the concept of the Mandate of
 Heaven.  As the Son of Heaven
 an emperor received the Mandate
 from above to rule over all the
 people under the sun.  Literally,
 he stood between Heaven above
 and the people below.
 He maintained peace and order
 by doing the right thing at the
 right time for the people.  On the
 other hand, bad conduct on his
 part would destroy the sanction
 and Heaven would readily give its
 Mandate to another man.
 The Book of History told how
 the  wickedness  and  tyranny  of
 the last ruler of the Shang dynasty
 caused Heaven to give its Mandate
 to one of his subordinates, the
 King of Chou, who destroyed the
 Shang ruler and established the
 Chou dynasty.  This ancient idea
 was  later  amplified  into  the
 famous theory of the right of
 rebellion.  It was here that the
 Confucian school played its lead-
 ing role.
 The moral principles of conduct
 and princely rule were the main
 subjects  of  Confucian  studies.
 They emphasised court etiquette,
 state ceremonies and proper be-
 haviour according to status as in
 the good feudal days of old. They
 knew the rules of right conduct
 and  could  properly  advise  the
 emperor in his cosmic role.    On
 this basis the Confucian scholars
 were invited to take part in the
 formulation of a stable govern-
 ment and they did establish them-
 selves as an essential part of it.
 Feudal Times
 The Confucian scholars of the
 Han dynasty centralised the poli-
 tical  authority  in  the  Son  of
 Heaven. The administration of
 state affairs was exercised on his
 behalf by his chief ministers, who
 stood  at the  top  of     a graded
 bureaucracy and were responsible
 to him for the success or failure
 of their administration.  On the
 advice of his ministers, the em-
 peror                                                                                                  exercised  the  power  of
 appointment  to   office. As the
 government was organised on the
 Confucian principles and ideology,
 Confucian scholars began to fill
 this gigantic graded bureacracy.
 Finally, in the reign of Emperor
 Wu-ti  (140-87 B.C.), they suc-
 ceeded in dominating the govern-
 ment and putting a ban on the
 many   other  ancient  schools  of
 philosophy.
 In the administration the em-
 peror relied upon them not only
 in government routine but also in
 the supervision of public works,
 dykes  and   ditches,  walls  and
 palaces, cities and granaries, in
 drafting. peasant labour, in collect-
 ing taxes and in performing court
 ceremonies.  On many occasions,
 they were given authority to take
 charge of military affairs.  This
 group   of   "Jack-of-all-trades"
 supplanted the hereditary nobility
 of feudal times and became the
 backbone of the imperial regime.
 In education, they made Con-
 fucian ideology the chief subject
 of study and this became the most
 successful of all systems of thought
 control.  Hitler had much to learn
 from the Confucian school.  More-
 over, the philosophy of status and
 obedience according to status pro-
 vided one of the great historic
 answers to the problem of social
 stability.
 This was indeed a great inven-
 tion, and unifiers of China have
 been irresistibly attracted to it.
 For  fully  2,000  years  these
 Confucian scholar-officials played
 the leading role in the imperial
 government, held   the  key  to
 Chinese     education and set the
 foundation for social stability.
 A  glance  on  the list  of pro-
 minent                                                                                                       government officials in
 the                     Nationalists' regime will
 readily show how the Confucian
 School, until very recently, was
 still playing its important role in
 our life.   The leader of the party,
 though      Christian  by faith, has
 been advocating a new life, which,
 in fact, has a history of several
 thousand    years.     In  his book,
 China's Destiny, Chiang Kai-shek
 proclaimed:
 "To cultivate the- moral quali-
 ties necessary to our national
 salvation-we must revive and
 extend our traditional ethical
 principles.  The most important
 task is to develop our people's

 .sense of propriety, righteousness,
 integrity and honour.   These
 qualities  are based  upon the
 Four  Cardinal  Principles  and
 the Eight Virtues which in turn
 are based on Loyalty and Filial
 Piety." (Fairbank's translation,
 op. cit., p.60).
 It is an  open  secret  that the
 book was prepared for him by
 one of his close councillors who
 is an outstanding scholar-official.
 Among. this. group of modern
 Chinese leaders, how many have
 come  from  the  teaching  pro-
 fessorial class, who could readily
 return to their respective colleges
 or universities when they should
 fall out of favour.  They include
 many celebrated scholars like Dr.
 Hu Shih of Peita and many en-
 lightened educators like President
 Chang Po-ling of Nankai.  Many
 of  them  were  not necessarily
 Confucianists, but their lives were
 prescribed by the formula which
 has governed the lives of Chinese
 scholars in the past.
 And  again,  how  many  of  our
 very modern leaders who have
 had  years  of  scientific  training
 abroad,  would     readily  advocate
 the reciting of the classics for
 school children, and would gravely
 send their sisters and 'daughters
 to the inner household because
 they consider it their duty to pay
 tribute to the sages and to uphold
 the old social order?  Countless
 Chinese  scholar-officials before
 them have done the same not only
 in the capital but also, in every
 village in the country-side.
 Therefore, the imperial dynas-
 ties might come and go, and the
 Son of Heaven- might change from
 a royal personage to  a rascal,
 from a monk to a war-lord, from
 a shrewd woman to a helpless
 infant, or from aroaming robber
 to a "foreign devil", but the Con-
 fucian bureaucracy of the scholar-
 officials stayed on forever.  They
 were  teachers  and  officials by
 profession and were the real ruling
 class in China. They have mono-
 polised the Chinese society, educa-
 tion and government .throughout
 the dynasties.
 History tells us that Emperor
 Shih-huang-ti of Ch'in was the
 first to create the great Chinese
 Empire,  but  histoty  also bears
 witness that it was Confucius who
 really united this country.  He
 put the whole population under
 one  rule,. politically, socially as
 well as culturally.  He has been
 the Uncrowned Emperor of China
 for more than 2,000 years.
 Bitter jungle war
 The bitter jungle war in Malaya
 against the bandit groups is con-
 tinuing unabated.
 Although progress is bound to
 be slow owing to the nature of
 the country, there are signs that
 the Briggs Plan is producing de-
 finite results.
 One feature of the authorities'
 new measures has  been  the in-
 stallation of a Post Office Box,
 No   500,   to   which   informa-
 tion of bandit movements may be
 sent anonymously by those people
 who are afraid to  reveal   their
 identites for fear of retaliation.
 This move has met with success
 and a number  of  bandits have
 been eliminated as a result of in-
 formation given by people whom
 they were terrorising.
 In order to counter this move
 on the part of the Authorities,
 WONG KONG
 guerrillas have  been  forced  to
 resort to ruthless and wholesale
 murder of entire families where
 there were the  slightest suspi-
 cions that information might have
 been given to the Authorities.
 Well  over  100  bandits have
 been executed on charges of nav-
 ing been caught with arms in their
 hands or in the act of exhorting
 funds for  the  bandits  from
 villagers.
 The story of Wong Kong, (see
 out), the 106th bandit to be hang-
 ed, follows:-
 He                                                            approached   a  Chinese
 labourer-on arubber estate this
 year and. demanded a subscription
 of Straits $5 monthly to be paid
 to "the people in the jungle."  If
 would remain in peace, Wong said,
 the labourer paid the money he
 otherwise he would be forced to
 leave the area. The labourer said
 that he had no money, but would
 pay him later.
 Some days later Wong demand-
 ed the money saying that he had
 already paid it over to the "jungle
 people",  and  that  other  people
 were giving him food as well. He
 repeated his threats.  The labour-
 er then informed hsi employer and
 the police with the result that
 Wong Kong was  captured in a
 coffee shop in the act of taking
 over marked notes.
 Wong was convicted in Johore
 under the Emergency Regulations
 and sentenced to death.  He was
 hanged on September 9, after his
 appeal had been heard and dis-
 missed.
 Johore's Elections
 The principal of racial repre-
 sentation is emphatically rejected
 in a report on popular elections
 in.the State of Johore.
 The report which was drawn up
 by a Select Committee of six,
 working under the chairmanship
 of the British Adviser in Johore,
 Mr. J. D. Hodgkinson,  said  that
 it would be a grave mistake to
 allow the idea to be introduced
 into  elections  for  the  Johore
 Council of State.
 The Committee also considered
 that if it is necessary to create-by
 some means a balance  on      the
 Council it would be far better to
 do so by retaining a provision for
 nominating unofficial members. '
 The   "Singapore   Standard'.'
 described the Committee's rehom-
 mendation as "revolutionary" and
 notes with approval that the Com-
 mittee has quoted a sentence from
 the  Soulbury Report on    Ceylon
 which reads:  "We therefore re-
 ject any propsal calculated to rep-
 inforce the  communal' basis                                                                                                    of
 election and we prefer to' develop
 the territorial method."
 The newspaper added that it is
 particularly encouraging that this
 vote   against  communal   repre-
 sentation should have come from
 a. Committee    having          a  Malay
 majority  since the  Malays had
 previously been the most, ardent
 exponents   of  communal ,repre-
 sentation.

 THE ORIENT
 Chinese investments in - Philippines
 Retail business in the Philip-
 pines is predominated by Chinese
 merchants.  Because of their firm
 entrenchment in this branch of
 trade, they are generally identi-
 fied with the distribution end of
 private enterprise rather than with
 the production side. This is, how-
 ever, a wrong conception.
 Even before a flight of capital
 to the Philippines from the China
 mainland as a result of the col-
 lapse of the Chinese Nationalist
 Government and the ascendancy
 to power of the People's Central
 Government,  Chinese  merchants
 have played an important role in
 the Philippines' manufacturing in-
 dustries.
 For some time Chinese traders
 have also held a predominating
 position in the import and export
 field. However, due to creditand
 exchange  restrictions,  they are
 today the most affected by these
 control.
 A number of old established
 import-export  firms  owne&i by
 Chinese  nationals  are  closing
 down or reducing their scope of
 operations.    Their  traditional
 adaptability and resiliency, how-
 going out of existence.
 MANILA. RUINS
 There is little room for further
 investment in the import-export
 trade in the Philippines.  There-
 fore,                          Chinese  capital from the
 China   mainland     and elsewhere
 from the Asiatic continent will
 have to be channelled into the
 manufacturing industries
 Here, again like in the retail
 field, Chinese initiative and enter-
 prise may eventually predominate.
 The Chinese were among the
 first to replace Manila's ruins with
 new  buildings.   Chinatown I; was
 among the first areas to be re-
 built.  In other ways, by their re-
 sourcefulness and enterprise, they
 have contibuted immensely to the
 rehabilitation of Manila after the
 end of the war.
 . Many. Chinese  manufacturers
 and exporters have also played an
 important part in saving and earn-
 ing hard currency. for the Philip-
 pines.  One of the biggest cocoa-
 nut oil industries, the Lu Yu and
 Lu Du Company, is owned by a
 Chinese. industrialist, and the Sun
 Ripe Cocoanut Products Company,
 which produces and exports' de-
 Capital from Asiatic mainland is now being
 channelled  into  the  manufacturing industries;
 exchange restrictions adversely affect import-export
 business.
 siccated cocoanut is also owned
 and operated by Chinese national.
 There  are  also  the Central
 Vegetable Oil Company and the
 International Oil Factory  which
 produce cocoanut oil for export
 and for the making of lard for
 domestic consumption and export.
 Mr. Peter Lim operates one of
 the oldest established and biggest
 tobacco factories which turns out
 cigarettes and cigars.  In recogni-
 tion of his enterprise and leader-
 ship in the tobacco manufacturing
 field he had been selected as "The
 Tobacco Manufacturer of 1949"
 by   the  Philippines   Business
 Writers Association.
 Mr. Henry Wong, Hong owns
 the Manila-Cosmos Aerated Water
 Factory.  He has also established
 a branch of his bottling industry
 in  Hong  Kong.   The  Avenue
 Aerated   Water factory is also
 owned by a Chinese national.
 In   the  sawmill and  general
 lumber field there are also Chinese
 companies. They include Dee C.
 Chuan  and  Sons, Dy Pac and
 Sons, the Go Tau Company and
 Vincente Gotamco G Hermanos.
 One   of   Manila's   biggest
 foundries is owned and operated
 by the President of, the Philip-
 pines Chinese General Chamber of
 Commerce, Mr. Sy En, and in the
 distillery field there are the La
 Tondefia Company, Lim Tua Com-
 pany, the Gonzalo G. Hoc Com-
 pany and the La Verdad  Com-
 pany, all owned by Chinese.
 Chinese traders control an es-
 timated 90 per cent of Manila's
 rattan and wood furniture mak-
 ing business.  They also operate
 some  of  the leading confection-
 ery, cake and biscuit  factories.
 There is M. Y. San Factory with
 branches in Hong Kong.
 At    the  time- of  writing, a
 Chinese factory is being organised
 for the manufacture of aluminum
 products.
 In addition to these big indus-
 tries,                                                             Chinese nationals are also
 concerned in home or cottage in-
 dustries  such as  foundry  and
 machinery tools, umbrellas, rattan.
 furniture,  shirts, handbags, bed-
 ding and mattresses.
 Chinese  capital  continues to
 lead in new partnership firms. In
 1948,_162 of the business partner-
 ships                                                                                                    registered  were  Chinese
 owned  with  a  total  paid     up
 capital of P10,545,850; 107 were
 Filipino companies with a com-
 bined capital of P3,400,638; and
 nine were American with a total
 capital of only P335,500.
 In 1949, 116 additional Chinese
 partnership firms were registered
 with a combined paid up capital
 of P8,650,470; Filipino firms in-
 creased by 105 with a combined
 capital of P3,566,530; and Ameri-
 can companies by 10 with a total
 capital of P1,287,500.
 Mr.  B.  Ronquillo,  a  Manila
 economic writer commenting on
 Chinese businessmen said:   "The
 Chinese who have come to Manila
 to set up  manufacturing  enter-
 prises or who have gone into pro-
 duction are here to stay.                                                                                                    Their
 forefathers had  been here long
 before the Americans or even the
 Spaniards set foot on Philippine
 soil.
 "Many of them have        raised
 their  families  here with some
 marrying   into  Filipino families.
 They have considered the Philip-
 pines as their home and in their
 own way have contributed to the
 building of its economy.
 "A powerful factor in Chinese
 business and a potent influence in
 the local business community as
 a whole is the Chinese Chamber
 of Commerce.  It has probably a
 larger membership in Manila than
 any other trade body.
 "It has dedicated  itself pri-
 marily to the promotion of Philip-
 pine-Chinese                                                                                                         relationship   and
 hopes   to   play  the  role  of
 strengthening the bonds    among

 THE CONTROL 0'F' THOUGHT IN CHINA
 By Y. C. Wang, B.Sc. (Econ.) 'Cond.
 There are always fundamental
 assumptions underlying any kind
 of political system.  In a demo-
 cracy, the chief assumption is the
 right to -disagree. This is clearly
 illustrated   when    an   eminent
 statesman said: "I do not believe
 a word of what you said, but I
 will fight to death for your right
 of saying it."
 In a totalitarian regime, the
 assumption is that one and only
 one creed is correct and all others
 are. heresies, which,. if allowed to
 develop, would gravely endanger
 the existence of the state.  On
 this,  and  on this only, can in-
 tolerance be justified.  Thus the
 difference between democracy and
 totalitarianism  is  clear-cut and
 belies easily those who accept the
 creed but refuse the name.
 It follows also that the main-
 tenance of a totalitarian regime
 depends fundamentally       on  the
 control  thought.  If the official
 creed is seriously challenged there
 will be no raison d'etre for the
 regime and it is bound to fall
 sooner   or  later.   Compared to
 this, material weapons of what-
 ever nature  are  less important,
 for they can  kill  but  cannot
 change people's minds. This being
 so,  the   question of     how the
 thought is controlled is well worth
 the attention of either friends or
 foes.
 Despite their professed material-
 ism, the communists have always
 fully grasped the significance of
 this problem.  Party-members are
 being  incessantly  indoctrinated
 even  at  the  hey-day of their
 political fortune, and the public
 of the `liberated' areas are being
 taken.   They  have  spared  no
 effort-by words and by promises
 -to lure back the large number
 of rich and . influential Chinese
 now in voluntary exile in Hong
 Kong, Macao, and other regions
 outside China, for it is on the
 conversion of the people that the
 stability of the new regime de-
 pends.  I  shall,  however,  deal
 more with the party-members and
 their followers  as  the methods
 used are more thorough and only
 different in degree  from those
 used for the public.
 To begin with, membership of
 the  party. is  very. strict. The
 official stipulations are:    .
 1.  Manual   labourers,   city-
 destitute,  poor  and                                                                  employee-
 farmers, soldiers of the rank of
 privates. Memberships for these
 people will be granted at the end
 of 6 months' probational period if
 the applicants are: a) recommend-
 ed                                                    by  two party-members; b)
 agreed to at the plenary session
 of local party-members; c)  ap-
 proved by district commissars.
 2. Middle-class peasants, white-
 collared                                                        class, people  of know-
 ledge and/or of free profession.
 Memberships will be granted at
 the end of one year's probational
 period if they are: a) recommend-
 ed by two members, one of whom
 must at least have been in the
 party for one year; b) agreed to
 at the plenary  session  of local
 members; c) approved by district
 commissars.
 3. People other than the above.
 Memberships will be granted at
 the end of two years' probational
 period if they are: a) recommend-
 ed by two members, one of whom
 must at least have been in the
 party for three years; b) agreed
 to at the plenary session of local
 members; c) approved by Hsien
 or municipal commissars.
 4.  Ex-members of other po-
 litical parties.  Memberships will
 be  granted  at the end of two
 years'  probational period    if
 they are: a) recommended      by
 two   members   one  of     whom
 must at least have been in the
 party for 'three  (five in  case
 of applicants who were responsible
 members of other political parties)
 years; b) agreed to at the plenary
 session of the. local members; c)
 approved by provincial  (central
 in case of applicants who were im-
 portant responsible  members                                                             of
 other parties) commissars.
 5.  Members recommending an
 applicant are required to submit
 a detailed and truthful report on
 his  political  thought, personal
 quality, and previous experiences.
 Commissars are required to con-
 duct a thorough investigation be-
 fore they give their approval.
 6.  The aim of the probational
 period is to enable the prospective
 member  to.  accept  elementary
 party education and to enable the
 party   machine   to  factually
 examine his -political quality.
 7.  Promotion to full member-
 ship at the end of the probational
 period has to be sanctioned anew
 by the plenary session  and the
 commissars in charge.  The latter
 are empowered  to  extend'  or
 shorten the probational period, or
 to cancel the probational member-
 ship if so deemed fit.
 It will be readily seen that the
 conditions are not only strict but
 discriminative.  Poverity is a vir-
 tue, for best chance is given to
 the destitute. This is attributable
 less  to  the  class-feeling of the
 party than to the salient fact that
 poverty in money means poverty
 in knowledge (at least in a coun-
 try where there is no free and
 compulsory  education)  and  the
 least instructed minds are the best
 targets for indoctrination.
 They can offer no resistance and
 roots well planted certainly stay.
 This  accounts for the  absolute
 obedience and the fanatic belief
 which distinguish sharply the com-
 munists from members of other
 creeds. The member-list is a top
 secret but it was authoritatively
 stated not long ago that the total
 number  is  only  a little  over
 4,000,000. The figure is small in
 the circumstances and does not
 constitute an index  of     their
 strength. By keeping the    mem-
 bership difficult, the  party                                                                                              also
 achieves a secondary purpose of
 giving  it  high vanity - value.
 Neither vanity nor hero-worship is
 wiped  out  among  the. ardent
 materialists.
 There is 'a number of auxiliary
 organisations  attached  to  the
 party. The most notable is the
 New Democratic Principle's Youth
 Corps. Admittance  to  these or-
 ganisations                                                                                                is  less     strict  and
 serves as a consolation prize or a
 stepping-stone to the membership
 of the party.
 EASILY CHECKED
 From the above it is clear that
 the rank and file of the Liberation
 Army are mostly not party-mem-
 bers.                                                                                           However intensity of in-
 doctrination is the same for them
 all. As soon as a person joins
 the Army, he has no more liberty
 of his own. He must first submit
 a list of his personal belongings
 so that any future addition result-
 ing  from  corruption  could be
 easily checked.
 Boarding, lodging,   clothing,
 etc., - are `provided for but no

 salary is paid.  No  one  should
 live on another; therefore there is
 no  question of family   burden.
 Henceforth he will live a com-
 pletely communal life, and nearly
 all his time will be spent in study-
 ing-groups, meetings, and confer-
 ences.
 The particular purpose of the
 studying-groups  is  to  acquaint
 the disciples with the theories of
 Marx-Lenin,  teachings   of  Mao
 Tse-tung, policies of the govern-
 ment, official utterances of 'great
 and minor leaders of the party,
 newspapers' editorials, etc. There
 is a great volume   of textbooks
 ranging  in  standard  from  the
 three-worded  sentences  to  the
 advanced new version of Marxist
 doctrine translated from the Rus-
 sian language.
 The thesis in the main runs as
 follows:  The great majority of
 the world population belongs to
 the  proletariat.   Capitalism  in
 placing the control of vital fac-
 tors of production in the hands
 of a few is necessarily the evil
 and is doomed to fiasco in accor-
 dance with Marx's analysis and
 forecast.  In the meanwhile, peo-
 ple are great and their interest
 must  come first in  all matters.
 Communist Party is the vanguard
 of the people, for them and by
 them.
 Since every person in his senses
 must bow to the will of the peo-
 ple, he therefore owes allegiance
 and absolute  obedience  to  the
 party.  The governments of Bri-
 tain, and the United States are in
 the hands of capitalists and there-
 fore imperialistic.  Stalin is the
 only leader of mankind.  There-
 fore we must obey him and be
 deadly against  the  Ather  two
 nations with their puppet-satelites,
 such as the Philippines, India, In-
 donesia, etc.
 The  whole  argument     sounds
 logical and cuts  deep into the
 minds of the unsophisticated. In
 newly `liberated' cities, the army
 men are  often    asked awkward
 questions and told some uuhappy
 truth, but to no avail. Anything
 contrary to this thesis must be a
 downright lie!
 The meetings and conferences
 are of more various nature. They
 are convened to hear lectures of
 party leaders, to discuss how to
 carry out in practice orders from
 above, to pronounce and to hear
 frank repentances of past crimes,
 to  criticise or self-criticise mis-
 demeanors, to state and discuss
 mental and physical sufferences in
 the Army, etc.
 The      last two. are  deemed  ex-
 tremely important, for the one is
 THE ORIENT
 a sign of real democracy and the
 other  by  giving  ventilation  to
 sufferences either ends  in   con-
 solidation of belief through per-
 suasion, or serves as  a                                                                    danger
 sign to the authorities.  In latter
 cases, which are few in number,
 the  members  concerned ' could
 always be transferred-sometimes
 to  unknown    destinations.  Each
 and every one is encouraged to be
 active.  Silence is considered to
 be a sign of shaken  belief and
 speech-delivering is compulsory at
 times.
 The "Ta Kung Pao" in Tientsin
 once revealed that as a result of
 statistics  taken,  a certain  per-
 son was found to have attended
 21  meetings in  10   days.     The
 Communists seem to       accomplish
 marvels with their time, for the
 meetings are   always  very   long!
 Apart from      the above,  there
 are also training centres, Revolu-
 tion Universities, and Military &
 Political  Universities. The  first
 two are chiefly for ex-civil ser-
 vants under                                                                    KMT regime.   The
 training is of the most rigorous
 kind.  Students- sent in are re-
 quired to do hard-labour-picking
 of firewood, fertilising of farms,
 carrying of water-buckets, etc.
 Besides these, they are required
 to get into the  habit  of  self-
 critising and publicly repenting
 their past mistakes.    While such
 institutions are generally referred
 to as  `concentration   camps' by
 foreign observers, the students do
 graduate after a few months bar-
 ring recalcitrance on their part.
 The Military & Political Univer-
 sities are institutes for advanced
 Army workers.
 The  party-members  are  cau-
 tioned against numerous specific
 mistakes-dogmatism, empiricism,
 unitarism, cliquism, etc. Evident-
 ly the only right course lies in
 obedience to the central organ. A
 public repentance generally suffi-
 ces to erase mistakes of no con-
 sequences.  In  other  cases,                                                                 the
 member concerned will be sent to
 industrial plants, battle fronts, or
 unknown places to `learn anew.'
 A well-known writer was con-
 demned in this way for the unpar-
 donable mistake of attacking Rus-
 sia's  policy  in  Manchuria.  To
 avoid such tendencies, disciplinary
 movement is launched from time
 to time, which means rescrutiny
 of all the members and followers.
 Amusements of the Army per-
 sonnel  are  provided  by  the
 Literary-Group  in  each  Army
 Corps. There    are theatrical
 operatic and musical performan-
 ces,  all  based                                                            on  compositions
 specially written for the purpose
 of indoctrination.  Wall-gazettes,
 folk songs  and  dance  are  the
 other convenient means of com-
 bining   amusement   with                                                                                                      ex-
 pediency.   Questions of heart can
 be discussed but marriage before
 revolution seems to be a mistake
 of order.
 For a betrothed to carry out
 his intention, he has to pass the
 standard  of  `Two - Five - Eight-
 Regiment', which, translated into
 King's    English,    means   25
 years  of  age,   eight   years'
 standing with the Army, and the
 rank of regimental    commander.
 Only under such conditions can be
 marry with tranquility, for the
 people as represented in the party
 will then pay for the up-keep of
 the family.
 One of the main teachings of
 the party is that the Army is to
 save the people  and the  world;
 but  not to  benefit themselves.
 Hence all appointments must come
 from above and no personal soli-
 citude can be entertained.                                                                                                    Any-
 body who makes a complaint of
 his work is liable to get into dis-
 favour, since it is a definite sign
 of his weakened devotion to the
 cause of the people.
 On the other hand, those who
 are  obedient  and  diligent  are
 often  conferred  the  titles  of
 `heroes'.   It seems a great honour
 for Mao Tse-tung himself, who is
 worshipped like a God and dis-
 played  as  an  all-round genius
 second to Stalin, is only the No.
 2 hero of the world.  Denial of
 the embellishments of life, is in-
 deed useful to drive men along
 their destiny.
 The contents of the communist
 newspapers can be divided into 4
 categories: 1) official speeches, 2)
 minutes of official  meetings,  3)
 stories purported to be written by
 workers and peasants to describe
 how they suffered under the reac-
 tionaries and how happy and com-
 fortable they are now, 4) eulogies
 of  Russia,  introductions  of  its
 new accomplishments, and grate-
 ful remarks of its help to China.
 Even the military successes of
 the communists are reported only
 belatedly as news of secondary
 importance.   What  a  difference
 between  these  newspapers    and
 their counterparts in Hong Kong
 where  competition has changed
 the whole picture?
 Under the circumstances it is a
 great   compliment  to  the  com-
 munist authorities that short-wave
 listening-in is still allowed. Per-
 haps the generosity will remain as
 long as the party is on its upward
 trend.
