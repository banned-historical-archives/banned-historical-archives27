 VIETNAM
 Intense fighting and high enemy losses in three allied
 operations highlighted the military situation this week
 in South Vietnam.  Although Communist-initiated activity
 was down somewhat, there are indications of continued
 infiltration and Viet Cong plans for large-scale actions.
 Premier Ky, with the full support of the military
 Directorate, removed I Corps commander Thi, potentially
 one of Ky's strongest rivals for power.  There is
 evidence this week both of increased numbers of fighter
 aircraft in North Vietnam and of greater aggressiveness
 on the part of DRV fighter pilots.  Hanoi has admitted
 that manpower allocation problems are affecting food
 production.
 PROLONGED ABSENCE OF MAO TSE-TUNG
 The Chinese Communist Party leader's unprecedented five-
 month absence from public view has been accompanied by
 idolatrous propaganda possibly intended to prepare the

 Intense fighting and high
 enemy losses in three allied op-
 erations highlighted the military
 situation this week in South
 Vietnam.   Although Communist-in-
 itiated activity declined some-
 what,  there are indications of
 continued infiltration as well
 as Viet Cong planning for future
 large-scale action.
 Intelligence obtained during
 a South Vietnamese operation)
 led to a larger alli
 on
 ed
 area,  led to allied follow-up op-
 erations which are continuing in
 the general vicinity.
 A Viet Cong battalion-size
 attack against elements of a
 South Vietnamese regiment in Bien
 Hoa Province and a multibattal-
 ion attack against the A Shau
 Special Forces camp near the Lao-
 tian border in Thua Thien Prov-
 ince were the most significant
 enemy actions reported during
 the week.   Two enemy soldiers
 who surrendered before the as-
 sault on the Special Forces gar-
 rison in Thua Thien provided
 some warning of the impending at-
 tack.   The soldiers claimed to
 be members of a North Vietnamese
 regiment which infiltrated last
 month and was located about six
 miles northeast of the special
 camp.
 opera ion the next day several
 miles northwest of the provincial
 capital, where the main force of
 a suspected North Vietnamese
 regiment was trapped.   Fighting
 continued                     and re-
 sulted in nearly 600 enemy dead
 as against allied losses of 113
 killed (83 US)  and 324 wounded
 (205 US).
 Farther south in Phu Yen
 Province,  elements of the US
 101st Airborne Division conduct-
 ing Operation HARRISON engaged
 a Viet Cong force in a day-long
 battle on 4 March,  raising enemy
 losses there to nearly 200 killed
 since 26 February.
 US forces sweeping an area
 in Binh Duong Province about 30
 miles northeast of Saigon also made
 contact with the emeny on 4 and
 5 March and, with close air sup-
 port,  killed nearly 200 Viet Cong.

 reported by a guerrilla unit lo-
 cated in the northern section of
 the Laotian infiltration corri-
 dor.   Large numbers of Communist
 trucks--perhaps as many as 400--
 moved south during the period
 16-23 February.   The trucks moved
 nightly in two or three convoys
 of 20-25 trucks each.   This re-
 port marks the first time in over
 a year that sizable numbers of
 Communist troops have been ob-
 served moving south in trucks
 through the Laotian infiltration
 corridor.
 There is no evidence as to
 the destination of these troops,
 and a second team located far-
 ther south on the same route did
 not confirm a movement of this
 size.   Normally,  infiltrating
 troops destined for South Viet-
 nam enter Laos just north of the
 Demilitarized Zone and move into
 the southern panhandle on foot
 trails.
 I Corps Commander Dismissed
 Premier Ky, who has recently
 been concerned with the independ-
 ence of his military corps com-
 manders,  yesterday received the
 unanimous support of the ruling
 military Directorate when he
 called for the removal of the
 strongest of them,  I Corps com-
 mander General Thi.   Thi ac-
 cepted the Directorate's deci-
 sion and reportedly agreed to
 submit a letter of resignation
 for medical reasons.   However,
 he is said to have agreed only
 reluctantly to leave for the
 United States sometime next week,
 and a certain amount of uneasi-
 ness will probably characterize
 the Saigon political atmosphere
 until he actually departs.
 The ousting of General Thi,
 long considered Premier Ky's
 strongest potential rival,  will
 probably serve to strengthen Ky's
 position in relation to the other
 corps commanders,  at least two
 of whom have also exhibited con-
 siderable independence.   In par-
 ticular,  there are indications
 that IV Corps commander General
 Quang will be next to go.

 major airfields is continuing. A
 large number of revetments have
 been constructed or are in the
 process of being constructed at
 Phuc Yen and Kep airfields while
 a major runway extension has ap-
 parently been completed at Hanoi/
 Gia Lam.
 Concurrent with the increas-
 ing number of aircraft appearing
 in North Vietnam is a noticeable
 increase in the aggressiveness
 of Vietnamese fighter pilots.
 On 4 March,  DRV fighters
 unsuc-
 cessfully a temp e   to intercept
 a flight of F4C Phantoms.
 Food Production Problems in DRV
 Problems of food production
 continue to plague the North
 Vietnamese regime. In the past
 month,  official spokesmen have
 expressed concern about the pro-
 duction of both rice and pork.
 Although pork constitutes a small
 part of the North Vietnamese :diet,
 it is the largest meat component
 besides poultry.
 Spokesmen for the Ministry
 of Agriculture have admitted in
 the past few months that a sig-
 nificant amount of acreage de-
 voted to the spring rice crop
 had not been planted.   A vice
 minister said in December that
 manpower shortages contributed
 to production problems and esti-
 mated that the remaining agri-
 cultural workers would have to
 increase their workdays 25-50
 percent in order to make up for
 the loss of manpower to the war
 effort.   The amount of land
 which the spokesman said had not
 been properly planted could nor-
 mally yield about eight percent
 of North Vietnam's total annual
 rice production.   Although such
 a decline in production would
 contribute to food problems,  any
 rice shortage could be overcome
 by substituting other foods or
 increasing imports.
 The admission of manpower
 shortages in agricultural pro-
 duction,  however,  is the first
 official suggestion that the mo-
 bilization requirements of the
 war have seriously cut into the
 country's large unskilled agri-
 cultural labor force.   In re-
 sponse to the air strikes,  North
 Vietnam has mobilized large seg-
 ments of the population for mil-
 itary service or related construc-
 tion work.   Although the manpower
 reserves are substantial,  the
 regime is apparently experiencing
 serious allocation problems.  Con-
 tinuation of these problems could
 interfere with production of the
 mare important fall rice crop.

 Mao Tse-tung,  72-year-old
 chairman of the Chinese Communist
 Party, may be nearing the end of
 the road.   He now has been out
 of public view for five months,
 exceeding his longest recorded
 previous absence in the winter
 of 1956-57 when he is believed
 to have suffered a stroke.
 After his last public ap-
 pearance in Peking on 10 October,
 Mao continued to receive an oc-
 casional foreign visitor at an
 undisclosed location--probably
 his villain the East China resort
 city of Hangchow--but his activ-
 ities have gone unreported since
 a meeting with a Cambodian del-
 egation on 26 November.
 His current absence has
 been accompanied by an unprece-
 dented and still growing out-
 pouring of emotional and idola-
 trous propaganda,  suggesting
 concern in top party ranks.
 Hyperbole on the value of study-
 ing Mao's works is the order of
 the day.   Mao's thoughts are ac-
 claimed as the "Red sun in our
 hearts," the "very heart and soul
 of all work," and the "apex of
 contemporary Marxist-Leninist
 thought."   Each of Mao's words
 is said to be worth 10,000 words
 of other men.   The epochs of
 Marx and Engels and of Lenin
 and Stalin are proclaimed to have
 been succeeded by the "epoch of
 Mao Tse-tung" during which
 "capitalism and imperialism...
 will be sent to their tombs."
 Adding to the aura of mys-
 tery surrounding Mao's whereabouts
 is the unusual absence of public
 activity by other leaders during
 the last three months.   The party's
 number two leader,  Liu Shao-chi,
 showed up only once in 11 weeks
 from late November to early Feb-
 ruary.   Lo Jui-ching, army chief
 of staff and the Chinese equiv-
 alent of chief of secret police,
 has been out of view as long as
 Mao.   In an apparently unprec-
 edented   wholesale  absence,  not
 one of the 150-odd top central
 party or government figures
 made public appearances during
 a nine-day period at the end of
 January.
 This gap in leadership ap-
 pearances was followed in early
 February by the issuance of di-
 rectives throughout China order-
 ing middle and senior level
 party and military officials to
 study Mao's works and emulate
 Maoist folk heroes.   These offi-
 cials were told to spend four
 days a month and one month a
 year,  in rotation, in full-time
 seminars studying Mao's writings.
 This extraordinary atten-
 tion to Mao Tse-tung seems to
 exceed what would be useful for
 indoctrination purposes,  and
 could be an effort to prepare
 the way psychologically for a
 transfer of loyalties to a suc-
 cessor regime.   Mao's charisma
 is one of the regime's few do-
 mestic political assets,  and any
 successor--especially the color-
 less Liu Shao-chi--probably would
 try to exploit Mao's name by
 representing himself as an ultra-
 loyal Maoist.

 East Germany's sudden will-
 ingness to conclude a reasonable
 short-term Berlin pass agreement
 on 7 March was probably prompted
 in large part by its desire to
 adopt a moderate and humanitarian
 pose while petitioning for UN
 membership.   The East Germans
 derive other political advantages
 from limited pass agreements,
 moreover,  and will probably agree
 to more in the future.
 East German negotiator
 Michael Kohl originally took an
 extremely rigid position when
 the pass talks began in January.
 He rejected West Berlin's propos-
 al  for                         a year-long agreement and
 offered instead a draft contain-
 ing several unacceptable provi-
 sions.   The East German position
 at that time appeared so harsh
 that Mayor Willy Brandt publicly
 warned West Berliners not to ex-
 pect any agreement.
 The day before East Germany's
 petition for UN membership was
 presented in New York,  however,
 Kohl informed his West Berlin
 Senat counterpart, Horst Kerber,
 of his government's willingness
 to conclude a short-term agree-
 ment almost identical to the one
 at Christmas and New Year's.
 Despite their earlier hopes for
 an agreement of longer duration,
 the Senat and West German Govern-
 ment accepted the East German
 offer.
 The new agreement provides
 West Berliners the opportunity
 to make one visit to relatives
 in East Berlin over the Easter
 (7 to 20 April)  and Pentecost
 (23 May to 15 June)  holidays.   It
 also extends the arrangement for
 issuance of emergency hardship
 passes from 31 March to 30 June.
 One reason for concluding
 a short-term agreement appears
 to be a desire on the East Ger-
 mans part to keep the Senat
 negotiating.   By doing this,  they
 can claim that their theory on
 the existence of three German
 "states"  is supported by West
 Berlin.   Pass agreements also
 imply recognition of the Berlin
 Wall as a legal boundary..   In
 addition, the East Germans de-
 rive a fairly large amount of
 needed hard currency from their
 requirement that each visitor
 exchange five West German marks
 for five East German marks.

 Serious factional differences
 have come to light within Albania's
 top leadership.   Opposition ele-
 ments, reportedly led by Defense
 Minister Balluku,  apparently were
 disturbed by lack of economic prog-
 ress and Albania's international
 isolation.   At least for the time
 being,  party boss Enver Hoxha has
 retained his authority through
 adroit maneuvering and some con-
 cessions.
 Hoxha, in an effort to save
 his neck,  is adopting the opposi-
 tion's criticism as his own.   As
 a result he has been compelled to
 subscribe in principle to some de-
 centralization of the economic
 planning apparatus and the state
 administrative authority and to
 limited moves to end Albania's iso-
 lation.   He also appears prepared
 to make a scapegoat of his  long-
 time colleague and governmental
 chief, Premier Shehu.
 Hoxha has also instituted
 measures to reassert his own and
 the party's authority over the
 army.   He undoubtedly recalled the
 abortive coup attempt in 1960 led
 by senior naval officers and in-
 cluding several senior army offi-
 cers.
 The struggle within the lead-
 ership is revealed in an unusual
 open letter to the population--the
 full text of which is not yet
 available--from the party central
 committee.   Broadcast on 6 March,
 the letter admitted party errors,
 strongly attacked the government
 bureaucracy,  and recommended re-
 forms.   The letter called for a
 "determined struggle against ap-
 pearances of warped methods of giv-
 ing orders" and, unprecedentedly for
 Albania,  indicted the "very cen-
 tralized form of leadership."   It
 recommended a reorganization of
 the "system of leadership" in which
 lower party-state bodies would have
 greater authority.
 Following the open letter, the
 regime issued a decree on 7 March
 reinstating in all military units
 and institutions the political com-
 missar system abolished in 1955.
 Another decree abolishes as of 1
 May the rank system in the armed
 forces and the secret police.
 These steps were influenced by
 changes in 1965 in the Chinese Com-
 munist armed forces intended to
 strengthen party control over the
 military.
 Previous reports of friction
 between Defense Minister Beqir
 Balluku and Interior Minister Kadri
 Hazbiu suggest that the army spear-
 headed the Albanian opposition.
 This friction apparently derived
 in some part from long-standing in-
 terservice rivalry.   Also involved,
 however, were serious differences
 between those with rigid pro-Chi-
 nese views,  probably represented
 by Hazbiu,  and Balluku and his ad-
 herents,  who wanted to reduce Al-
 bania's dependence on the Chinese
 and its isolation from the rest
 of the world,  and to resume partic-
 ipation in the Warsaw Pact.

 INDONESIAN STUDENT AGITATION CONTINUES
 Indonesia's non-Communist
 students remain alone in openly
 opposing Foreign Minister Suban-
 drio and other leftist cabinet
 ministers and indirectly criti-
 cizing President Sukarno.   Al-
 though the army refuses to let
 them demonstrate against the pal-
 ace,                  it has been relatively leni-
 ent about activities directed
 against Subandrio and the crypto-
 Communist Minister of Basic Educa-
 tion,  Sumardjo.   The students ex-
 tended their activity on 9 and
 10 March to Chinese Communist
 targets--the consulate general,
 the trade office,  and the news
 agency.
 Sukarno's ban on demonstra-
 tions by students,                        announced on
 26 February,  applied only to those
 from universities..   The burden
 of present activity is being
 carried by high school youth,
 although the more advanced stu-
 dents are reported to be still
 participating.   Despite the gov-
 ernment order closing the Uni-
 versity of Indonesia in Djakarta,
 students apparently continue to
 use its buildings as a general
 headquarters.   A student radio
 which recently has begun broad-
 casting apparently operates from
 Bandung,  75 miles from the capi-
 tal,.
 Army officers. at various
 levels are said to be discuss-
 ing a variety of possible plans
 against Sukarno and those who
 support him.   The army appears
 to be pleased with the students'
 action but at the same time will
 not support them openly and ap-
 parently wishes to avoid serious
 disorder or violence specifically
 directed against Sukarno.
 The President is engaged in
 a series of meetings with civil-
 ian and military leaders.   The
 sessions are scheduled to con-
 clude on 12 March and may pro-
 duce new initiatives against the
 students and the army.   He and
 Subandrio apparently directed
 their own followers to take to
 the streets on 8 March.   The US
 Embassy experienced a small but
 violent demonstration by about
 300 leftist youth.
 Also, at Sukarno's orders,
 a number of leftists and pro-
 Communists who had been dis-
 missed from the various govern-
 ment departments after the 1
 October coup attempt are being
 reinstated.   The President has
 transferred trials of civilians
 involved in the coup attempt
 from the army to the attorne
 eral,
 Communist forces continue to
 exert pressure against government
 positions in northern Laos.
 In the Plaine des Jarres area,

 Ghana's new anti-Communist
 army and police rulers are rapidly
 dismantling key features of
 Nkrumah's power structure and
 pressing ahead with reconstruc-
 tion measures amid further signs
 of popular approval of the re-
 cent coup.   Their intra-African
 relations will be complicated,
 however,  by the more radical Af-
 rican regimes'  emotional opposi-
 tion to Nkrumah's ouster.
 On 7 March the ruling Na-
 tional Liberation Council  (NLC)
 abolished the Ghana Young Pio-
 neers,  a Communist-supported or-
 ganization established in 1960
 to indoctrinate youth in a variant
 of Marxism.   The coup leaders had
 earlier closed down the Ideolog-
 ical Institute at Winneba,  near
 Accra, where successive groups of
 adult cadres of Nkrumah's now
 dissolved party had been exposed
 to foreign Communist instructors.
 Nkrumah favorites who headed uni-
 versities have been replaced by
 respected nonpolitical figures.
 The new regime is evidently
 encouraging the early re-emer-
 gence of a free,  Western-style
 labor movement within the frame-
 work of the Ghana Trades Union
 Congress  (GTUC).   Nkrumah had
 long ago converted this important
 mass organization into a docile
 appendage of his party and also
 opened it wide to Communist pene-
 tration.   Now, under a newly in-
 stalled anti-Communist leader,
 who seems to have rank and file
 support,  a basic reorganization
 is about to be launched through
 a series of union elections.  The
 GTUC's extensive ties with the
 Communist world are apparently
 being severed.   According to the
 new GTUC chief,  this will include
 withdrawal from the Communist-
 backed All-African Trade Union
 Federation,  a primary instrument
 of Nkrumah's African subversion
 program.
 The evacuation of the ex-
 pelled Chinese advisers--evidently
 some 175 were in Ghana--was sub-
 stantially completed by 3 March.
 The Soviet exodus,  involving ap-
 proximately 500 technicians and
 their families, will probably
 continue for about another week.
 Both Communist powers are being
 restricted to 18-man embassies.
 The new regime has already
 resumed diplomatic relations with
 Britain, which Nkrumah had severed
 last December over Rhodesia.  It
 appears determined to press
 ahead with economic reforms keyed
 to earlier recommendations of the
 World Bank and International
 Monetary Fund.
 Although the NLC continues
 to fear that Nkrumah may soon try
 to return to Ghana,  the ousted
 leader now appears to have ac-
 cepted his present inability to
 reverse the coup.   He is still in
 Guinea but may move on soon to
 Cairo.   Despite the large number
 of African states which have recog-
 nized the new Ghana regime,  Nasir
 now appears inclined to play a
 leading role in organizing fur-
 ther African expressions of dis-
 approval of the coup.   Zambia has
 moved formally to terminate ac-
 tive relations with Accra, while
 the NLC has itself initiated a
 rupture with Guinea.

 Ivory Coast, which has been
 markedly stable since 1963, may
 be heading into a period of do-
 mestic agitation.   President
 Houphouet-Boigny, reportedly un-
 nerved by the recent rash of
 coups in neighboring West Afri-
 can countries,  has attempted to
 head off his critics in a manner
 which may instead encourage them
 to make further demands,
 Ivory Coast's prosperity is
 unmatched in black Africa.   This
 has somewhat obscured the exist-
 ence of  impoverished  rural areas,
 tribal hostilities,  and large
 numbers of frustrated and rest-
 less young Ivorians who crave
 positions of power.   By mid-1965
 there were indications that the
 rate of economic growth was slow-
 ing and that the country's cash
 crops, coffee and cocoa,  faced
 serious marketing problems. These
 factors, combined with the coups
 in Dahomey and Upper Volta, which
 had extremely close ties with the
 Ivory Coast Government,  apparently
 prompted Houphouet-Boigny to face
 up to several issues which threat-
 ened to undermine his regime.
 A major cabinet shake-up on
 21 January epitomized the new
 approach.   Portfolios were shifted
 and total membership was enlarged
 to bring in several younger men
 not closely identified with past
 policies.   To reduce the risk of
 subversion,  no one with a base
 of local support was dismissed.
 Several days later, a new minor
 post was created to permit a
 large and occasionally dissident
 tribe to be represented.
 By far the most  important
 ministerial change was the dis-
 missal of Raphael Sailer,  the
 French national who,    as minister
 of finance since 1960,  had be-
 come the symbol of the govern-
 ment's encouragement of French
 domination of the economy.   Al-
 though Houphouct-Boigny always
 paid lip service to the princi-
 ple of opening economic oppor-
 tunities to Ivorians,  Saller's
 policies in effect negated these
 promises.
 The President has also con-
 ceded to public opinion by finally
 burying his proposal to establish
 dual nationality for citizens of
 the states adhering to the Entente
 which Ivory Coast concluded with
 several of its neighbors in 1959.
 Many Ivorians had feared that
 this would permit natives of Da-
 homey, who are particularly hated,
 and of Upper Volta,  Niger,  and
 Togo to compete on equal terms
 for choice government jobs and
 other positions.
 Houphouet-Boigny apparently
 was taken aback when he belatedly
 learned of the intensity of  Ivorian
 feeling on some of these issues.
 Ile is responding in various ways.
 He has decreed clemency measures
 for political prisoners,  reportedly
 is planning to revive an armed
 party militia,  and is in the
 process of opening new channels
 for controlled political expres-
 sion.   These steps,  instead of
 protecting his regime against
 dissidence, may actually encourage
 his critics to press for even
 more concessions.

 The delegations from moder-
 ate states managed to keep the
 Organization for African Unity
 (OAU) together at the Sixth Ses-
 sion of the OAU Ministers' Coun-
 cil in Addis Ababa last week,
 despite the divisiveness of Gha-
 naian and Rhodesian issues.
 The session was almost
 scuttled by the refusal of the
 delegations from the Brazzaville
 Congo,  Guinea, Mali, Tanzania,
 and Egypt to sit with the repre-
 sentatives of the new Ghanaian
 regime.   Algeria and Somalia
 withdrew in protest over the ac-
 ceptance of a moderate resolu-
 tion on Rhodesia.   However,  all
 eight departing delegations em-
 phasized that they were leaving
 only this meeting and not with-
 drawing from the OAU.
 In its resolutions the
 council called on Britain to ap-
 ply "effective measures,  includ-
 ing the use of force" to oust
 the Smith regime in Rhodesia.
 The question of relaxing the De-
 cember resolution under which
 nine African states broke rela-
 tions with Britain was raised by
 Tunisia, but not approved in the
 plenary session. African nations
 were called upon to work for UN
 Security Council examination of
 the situation in Rhodesia under
 Chapter VII of the UN Charter,
 and a five-nation Committee of
 Solidarity With Zambia was set
 up to seek economic and technical
 relief for the nation which would
 bear the brunt of any complete
 break with Rhodesia.
 The council avoided action
 on the rival Rhodesian national-
 ist organizations by recommend-
 ing that aid be given only to Af-
 ricans who become actively en-
 gaged in fighting inside Rhodesia.
 The OAU's  radical secretary
 general,Diallo Telli of Guinea,
 was shorn of some of his power.
 The council reduced the secretar-
 iat's budget from a requested
 $2.3 million--which was only half
 of last year's expenditure--to
 $1.7 million.   Many of the dele-
 gates resented Telli's freewheel-
 ing use of his office for personal
 gain, and his attempts to exclude
 the delegates from Accra.
 The council is not scheduled
 to meet again until just before
 the annual African summit confer-
 ence in November. Before then,  how-
 ever,  the dissident factions are
 likely to get together to plan
 their next move.   There are indi-
 cations that these nations and
 certain other nonaligned states

 British and Rhodesian atten-
 tion is focused on rumors of the
 imminent arrival in Portuguese
 Mozambique of a tanker with oil
 for Rhodesia.   Salisbury is mak-
 ing arrangements at the port of
 Beira to bypass British-owned
 facilities,  and has ordered the
 pipeline company to be ready to
 pump oil from Beira to the Umtali
 refinery in Rhodesia.
 London, on the other hand,
 is pressing the Portuguese Gov-
 ernment and the private companies
 involved in the complex Beira-
 Umtali link to prevent delivery
 of the oil to Rhodesia.   It also
 hopes to mount an air and sea
 surveillance intended to intimi-
 date suspect tankers and deter
 their docking at Beira.
 A taAker full of oil would
 tremendously boost the will of white
 Rhodesians to hold out.   It also
 would increase conflicting pres-
 sures on Britain's Prime Minis-
 ter Wilson--domestic pressure to
 negotiate with the Rhodesian re-
 gime,  and demands from Africans
 that he take more militant action
 against it.
 A break in the oil embargo
 also would increase pressures
 on Zambia's President Kaunda to
 impose a boycott of Rhodesian
 goods or sanction use of Afri-
 can troops or guerrillas against
 Rhodesia.   Any move in this di-
 rection would exacerbate internal
 racial friction and might result
 in the flight from Zambia of
 skilled white workers essential
 to the country's economy.
 Labor tension with racial
 overtones, which had been in-
 creased last week by a confron-
 tation between white miners and
 the government over mineworkers'
 demands for large increases in
 wages and allowances,  has at
 least temporarily eased.   The
 government and the few local
 union groups involved backed
 away from their earlier antago-

 Paris has directly challenged
 the extensive US military struc-
 ture in France.   Eight basic
 agreements now govern the US pres-
 ence there.   Five of these are
 bilateral,  covering lines of com-
 munication,  air bases,  pipelines,
 and headquarters for the commander
 of US forces in Europe.   The US
 also is party to three multilat-
 eral agreements:   The North At-
 lantic Treaty (NAT),  a status-
 of-forces agreement,     and an agree-
 ment concerning the juridical as-
 pects of NATO,  its staff,  and
 representatives from member states.
 To terminate the bilateral
 agreements before 1969 without
 ending its participation in the
 NAT, France may seek legal. jus-
 tification in the doctrine of
 international law (rebus sic
 stantibus) which provides that
 a change in the conditions pre-
 vailing at the time an agreement
 was signed voids the agreement.
 De Gaulle has consistently held
 that changed conditions neces-
 sitate a change in France's role
 in the formation and implementa-
 tion of Western political and
 military policies.   Even if France
 does not unilaterally withdraw
 from the NAT or the bilateral
 agreements,  it could legally end
 the status-of-forces agreement
 after one year's notice and
 thereby raise practical difficul-
 ties for the continued presence
 of US forces.
 France also intends to with-
 draw its forces and personnel
 from NATO's integrated command
 structure.   This will be the
 final step in a process which
 began in 1959 when the French
 Mediterranean fleet was placed
 under national command.   Since
 that time,  Paris has excluded
 most of French territory from
 NATO's integrated air defense,
 has refused to restore to NATO
 control three divisions removed
 from Europe for use in Algeria,
 has withdrawn the bulk of France's
 Atlantic fleet from NATO,  has
 withdrawn French representation
 on the NATO naval Channel Com-
 mand and three subordinate naval
 commands,  and since 1965 has
 made clear that French forces
 will not participate in any NATO
 exercises which do not conform
 to French strategic views.
 France may intend,  however,  to
 maintain its representation on
 the North Atlantic Council and,
 though this is less likely,   in
 the Standing Group.
 France probably intends that
 the 65,000 French troops now in
 Germany under NATO remain there
 under. French control through a
 bilateral agreement with Bonn.
 The US Embassy in Bonn believes
 as a "theoretical possibility."
 there is a legal basis for such
 an arrangement, deriving originally
 from occupation rights and then
 from the 1954 Convention on Re-
 lations.   Chancellor Erhard has
 acknowledged such an arrangement

 NATO INTEREST IN SOVIET PROPOSAL TO TRADE MILITARY OBSERVERS
 The Soviet proposal late
 last year for NATO - Warsaw Pact
 or US-Soviet exchanges of ob-
 servers at military maneuvers
 has generated some interest in
 NATO.   UK and West German plans
 for bilateral exchanges with the
 USSR have been outlined in recent
 NATO and US discussions of the
 proposal.   The British and West
 Germans are interested in pro-
 moting such exchanges as a means
 of improving relations with the
 Soviets in an area which need
 not receive great publicity.
 The question of exchanging
 military maneuver observers was
 raised with the US Army attache
 in Moscow last October by Soviet
 First Deputy Minister of Defense
 and Warsaw Pact chief Grechko
 and has been subsequently refer-
 red to by other Soviet Ministry
 of Defense officers.   Grechko
 suggested that qualified US and
 NATO military personnel attend
 large bloc military exercises.
 He said that the purpose of these
 exercises was to let the West
 know that the Warsaw Pact forces
 were combat ready and well  equipped,
 and   suggested   that   the ex-
 change would serve to prevent
 Western underestimation of Eas-
 tern strength and consequent mis-
 calculation.   Grechko stated
 that exchanges would be accept-
 able either between NATO and the
 Warsaw Pact or between the US and
 the USSR.   In the latter case,
 he said that it was important for
 both sides to have a sober appre-
 ciation of the "capabilities of
 the possible enemy." Subsequent
 NATO Council discussions have
 ruled out a Warsaw Pact - NATO
 exchange because of the problem
 posed by East German membership
 in the pact.
 The UK revealed in NATO
 Council meetings in mid-February
 that it has issued invitations
 to "Warsaw Pact countries" to
 send observers to a military exer-
 cise in the UK in April.   Those
 governments which accept will
 guarantee reciprocity.   The Brit-
 ish  emphasized  that such ex-
 changes offered the political ad-
 vantage of "chipping away at the
 Soviet closed society" and that
 the Soviet initiative in this
 area should not be rebuffed.
 West Germany has as yet
 made no approach to the Soviets.
 The West German response in NATO
 was probably sparked by earlier
 discussion of the possibility of
 a bilateral US-Soviet exchange
 of observers on German soil as
 one of several alternatives. The
 West Germans have opposed this
 alternative since it would appear
 that the US and the USSR were
 cooperating without regard to
 Bonn's interests and ignoring
 the hostile Soviet attitude to-
 ward West Germany.   Nevertheless,
 the West Germans believe that
 it might eventually be possible
 to work out an exchange of their
 observers with the Soviets in
 pursuit of the "normalization"
 of their relations with the USSR.

 FINLAND'S NATIONAL ELECTIONS
 National elections on 20 and
 21 March may result in a fundamental
 shift in power relationships on the
 Finnish political scene.   Most
 deeply affected will probably be the
 relative strengths of the two prin-
 cipal contending non-Communist par-
 ties--the long-dominant Center  (Agra-
 rian) Party of President Kekkonen
 and the Social Democrats,  who for
 almost eight years have endured po-
 litical isolation imposed by Kek-
 konen with Soviet support.
 This period in opposition is
 redounding to the advantage of the
 Social Democrats,  as the party is
 now riding a groundswell of dis-
 satisfaction with the pro-farmer eco-
 nomic policies of the succession of
 Center-dominated cabinets which have
 governed Finland in recent years.
 The campaign is centering on domes-
 tic issues,  particularly the unpopu-
 larity of continued heavy subsidiza-
 tion of marginal agriculture,  the
 need to industrialize more rapidly,
 and the government's seeming inabil-
 ity or unwillingness to face the
 wide range of economic problems.
 The Center and the Communists
 have sought to divert public atten-
 tion from these issues by reviving
 the old canard that the Social Demo-
 cratic leadership does not fully
 support Finland's official policy of
 friendly relations with Moscow,  but
 these charges do not appear to have
 been given much credence by the pub-
 lic.   Many observers predict that
 the Social Democrats will gain a
 minimum of seven and perhaps up to
 16 additional seats in the 200-mem-
 ber parliament.   These gains are ex-
 pected to be made principally at the
 expense of the Center and its coali-

 tion partners--the three so-called
 "bourgeois" parties--but there is
 a good chance that the Communists
 too will slip somewhat,                                                                     reflecting
 the dissension that has plagued
 their party for the past year or so.
 No responsible political party
 leader   has   ventured   to                                                                suggest
 what   the   political   complexion
 of Finland's postelection govern-
 ment will be.   A logical result of
 extensive Social Democratic gains
 would be a resumption of cabinet co-
 operation between the Center and
 the Social Democrats which was the
 basis for almost every Finnish gov-
 ernment in the postwar years up to
 1958.   However,  this would require
 considerable compromise by the two
 parties on an economic program.
 It is uncertain whether Mos-
 cow would choose to try to pre-
 vent the Social Democrats from
 gaining cabinet representation.
 Aside from the usual press attacks
 against the Socialist leadership,
 the Soviets have thus far taken a
 relatively restrained attitude to-

 MALTA TO ELECT NEW PARLIAMENT
 The campaign for Malta's 26
 March election centers on Prime
 Minister Borg Olivier's handling
 of economic ills since independence
 and the related question of whether
 Malta is getting adequate return
 for allowing NATO forces on its
 soil.   Borg Olivier set the elec-
 tion for March to get it over with
 before the Maltese learn from the
 April budget that Britain is end-
 ing its budgetary support.   London
 is impatient with Borg Olivier's
 failure to use aid already granted,
 and his unwillingness to help solve
 Malta's economic problems by,  for
 instance,  increasing or even en-
 forcing the income tax.
 In addition to attacking this
 record,  opposition leader Dom Min-
 toff is accusing Borg Olivier of
 failing to get an economic or de-
 fense agreement from NATO commen-
 surate with Maltese sovereignty.
 Mintoff used to denounce the pres-
 ence of Western forces in the is-
 lands but, with the prospect of re-
 gaining power,  recognizes their
 economic value and apparently has
 no desire to kick NATO out.   He
 nevertheless wants to increase
 Malta's ties with Communist and Af-
 ro-Asian countries,  to increase his
 bargaining power with NATO,  and to
 make Malta appear neutral.
 Mintoff,  who is playing down
 his politically costly quarrel with
 the Roman Catholic hierarchy in
 Malta,  is expected to take some of
 Borg Olivier's 25 seats in the 50-
 seat Parliament, but probably will
 not win an absolute majority.  Borg
 Olivier would probably have a bet-
 ter chance than he of forminga
 shaky coalition government.
 AUSTRIAN ELECTION UPSETS COALITION BALANCE
 Austria's elections on 6 March
 upset the equilibrium which has
 prevailed between its two major
 parties since the end of the Al-
 lied occupation in 1955.   The cen-
 trist People's Party's gain of two
 seats from the Socialists and two
 seats from the right-wing Liberal
 Party gives it an absolute majority.
 Political leaders are "shocked"
 by this upset of  the tradition of
 equilibrium between the two par-
 ties, according to the American
 Embassy in Vienna.   The voters
 have previously tended to swing
 votes to the weaker party to main-
 tain the balance regarded as an es-
 sential shield against a renewal of
 the civil disorders of the 1930s.
 Reaction against Communist support
 for the Socialists and internal
 party dissension appear to have
 been the major causes of Socialist
 losses.   These losses mostly bene-
 fited ex-Socialist Olah,  who never-
 theless won no seats for his new
 party.

 coalition with the Socialists.
 Klaus may require them to forfeit
 some cabinet and subcabinet posts
 as well as to allow much greater
 parliamentary initiative and deci-
 sion--conditions which may prove
 too stiff for acceptance.   In any
 event,  the election results will
 --at least in the short term--af-
 feet domestic far more than foreign
 policy.
 A lessening of tensions be-
 tween the Dominican military and
 Provisional President Garcia Godoy
 has been largely responsible for
 a calmer political atmosphere in
 the past ten days.   The Provisional
 President publicly has praised
 what he calls the "changed mental-
 ity" of the new service chiefs and
 even has endorsed the military's
 contention that unknown plotters
 are seeking to implicate the armed
 forces in whatever sporadic vio-
 lence occurs.   In return,  Minister
 of Defense Perez y Perez has threat-
 ened to discipline or discharge
 any member of the armed forces who
 disregards the strictures against
 partisan political activity.
 Garcia Godoy has appealed for
 "moderation" during the political
 campaign and has~continued to re-
 place some of Juan Bosch's adher-
 ents in municipal and provincial
 government posts--generally with
 backers of Joaquin Balaguer or in-
 dependents--in order to establish
 some measure of parity among the
 parties.   Registration of voters
 eligible to cast ballots in the 1
 June election has begun throughout
 the country.
 Several incidents have marred
 the calm.   Troops of the  Inter-Amer-
 ican Peace Force have been involved
 in several scraps with gangs of
 juvenile toughs,  and one of Bosch's
 bodyguards was killed by a police-
 man during what appears to have
 been a personal quarrel on 6 March.
 After learning of the shooting,  a
 group of Bosch's bodyguards as-
 saulted several police in downtown
 Santo Domingo.   Such incidents un-
 derscore the lack of effective po-
 lice measures,  the prevalence of
 weapons among the populace,  and
 the bitter enmities left by the
 revolution.
 Bosch seized on the recent
 shootings to reiterate his charge
 that the country is not ready for
 elections--a claim seconded by
 militant Social Christians.  Bosch
 alleges that "hundreds" of members
 of his Dominican Revolutionary
 Party  (PRD) have been murdered and
 that the Dominican military are
 otherwise intimidating his follow-
 ers.                                                                              While there has been some
 right-wing terrorism directed
 against Bosch's followers,  the
 PRD leader has exaggerated the
 danger,  apparently in order to
 build a position from which he can 25x1
 boycott the elections if he de-
 cides the PRD cannot win.

 A confrontation could be in
 the offing between Guatemalan
 Chief of Government Peralta and
 restive conservatives who are
 fearful of a new government headed
 by Julio Cesar Mendez Montenegro.
 As of late morning on 10 March,
 Peralta was to meet with his top
 military commanders,  following a
 reported ultimatum that he step
 down in favor of a new junta or
 be deposed.
 Mendez,  of the left-of-cen-
 ter Revolutionary Party  (PR), was
 the front runner for the presi-
 dency in Guatemala's 6 March elec-
 tions.   Although the full tally is
 not in, it is evident that none of
 the three candidates won the ma-
 jority necessary for direct elec-
 tion.   Returns so far indicate,
 however,  that the PR has captured
 a majority--perhaps 29--of the 55
 congressional seats.   Because the
 "second-level" election entails
 selection of the president by the
 legislature after it meets on 5
 May,  the PR's candidate seems
 likely to be the eventual victor.
 Since the election,  Peralta
 has continued to maintain that
 the army will keep its word and
 deliver power to the elected party.
 Mendez has made a concerted effort
 to convince military leaders of
 his own and his party's anti-
 Communist bent and to assure them
 he has no plans to interfere with
 the command structure of the armed
 forces.   Which appeal--that of the
 conservatives or that of Peralta
 and the PR--will prove effective
 with the military high command
 remains in doubt.   Should Peralta
 resign,  his successor would be
 chosen by the military command-
 ers,  according to the operative
 "laws" of the present regime.
 There is still danger that
 both sides will harden in their
 determinations and bring a di-
 rect clash between the bitterly

 Elections for congressmen
 and departmental and municipal
 representatives are to take place
 in Colombia on 20 March.   Presi-
 dential elections will be held
 on 1 May.
 Under Colombia's unique Na-
 tional Front system, which pro-
 vides for a 16-year coalition of
 the two principal parties,  half
 of all elective offices are
 awarded to the Conservative Party
 and half to the Liberal Party,
 and the presidency is alternated.
 There are no issues,  therefore,
 between the two parties,  but only
 among contending factions within
 them.   Ideology and policy are
 subordinate to group and personal
 interests.
 The major factions competing
 for votes in the coming elections
 are the Official Liberals and
 the Ospinista Conservatives, which
 make up the government coalition,
 and the National Popular Alliance
 (ANAPO),  the Liberal Revolutionary
 Movement,  and the Lauro-Alzatista
 Conservatives,  which are expected
 to join after the congressional
 elections to oppose the government
 coalition.   The Ospinistas and
 Lauro-Alzatistas are so designated
 after their founders:   Mariano
 Ospina Perez,  Laureano Gomez,  and
 Gilberto Alzate Avendano.
 The Liberal Party is up for
 the presidency this time,  and
 the Official Liberals and the
 Ospinistas have already launched
 the candidacy of that party's
 Carlos Lleras Restrepo.   One or
 more candidates representing op-
 position interests will be
 selected in the light of the re-
 sults of the congressional elec-
 tions and the political maneuver-
 ing that follows them.
 The National Front govern-
 ment must command two thirds of
 the votes in-the congress to pass
 most important legislation,  and
 there is some doubt among observ-
 ers that it will be able to mus-
 ter even a majority after the
 elections.   This would force the
 government to rule by decree and
 perhaps lead to a radical modifi-
 cation of the National Front sys-
 tem.   ANAPO,                                                                            the Conservative fac-
 tion of rabble-rousing former
 president Gustavo Rojas Pinilla,
 is expected to make the greatest
 gain and is considered the most
 serious threat to continuation
 of the National Front system.
 Although the government has ef-
 fected some basic reforms,  their
 impact has not yet been widely
 felt by the people,  and Rojas
 has based his campaign on the
 charge that the National Front
 government is responsible for
 the significant increase in the
 cost of living.
 Considerable voter apathy
 will probably be reflected in
 large-scale abstention from the
 polls.   The prevailing mood among
 the Colombian voters seems to
 favor orderly,  legal political
 processes, rather than violent
 change,  and no serious violence
 during the elections is antici-
 pated.                                                                                Electoral fraud is not
 expected to be a significant fac-

 ECUADOREAN POLITICIANS RESISTING JUNTA'S REFORM PLANS
 Ecuador's military junta an-
 nounced its long-awaited consti-
 tutional reforms on 2 March and,
 by the weekend,  resistance from
 the politicians had combined with
 adverse economic developments,
 labor and student unrest,  and a
 spate of plots to produce tension
 and widespread uneasiness.
 The decree banned presiden-
 tial re-election and consecutive
 congressional re-election,  in-
 creased the powers of the National
 Security Council,  and reduced
 the powers of congress.   It made
 insurgents subject to military
 justice,  thus  bypassing the
 courts,  whose unwillingness to
 prosecute subversives has been
 notorious.   Elections were post-
 poned from 5 June to 3 July in
 order to complete lagging voter
 registration.
 Leading politicians,  who ac-
 cording to the US ambassador have
 a "blind and almost fanatical
 devotion" to ousting the military
 junta,  responded by forming a
 new front,   a characteristic Ecua-
 dorean tactic,  aimed at assem-
 bling most parties and forces,
 including Communists,  for a sin-
 gle objective.   The front reas-
 serted the politicians'  persist-
 ent demands for a constituent as-
 sembly--which implicitly they
 would control--to handle the
 transition to constitutional
 rule.   Such assemblies are in
 harmony with Ecuadorean history,
 but have been chaotically inept,
 and the junta fears that reform
 programs would be lost in the
 shuffle.
 to cooperate in the elections
 have now vowed intransigence.
 Some observers believe that the
 junta's program will thus become
 unworkable and leave it only two
 choices:  yielding to a constitu-
 ent assembly,  or imposing a true
 military dictatorship.
 Concurrently there have been
 several adverse economic develop-
 ments.   Foreign exchange reserves
 continued to fall,  and imports
 to rise.   A serious budget defi-
 cit threatens,  and the usually
 stable currency has fallen.   As
 a remedy the junta decreed an in-
 crease in import duties which,
 if vigorously implemented,  could
 bring the budget under control.
 A storm of protest has come from
 foreign trade interests which
 last year fomented major disor-
 ders to resist tariff reforms.
 The populace seems to fear that
 the cost of living, which has
 been inching upward, will break
 away.
 These circumstances--and
 greater unity--improve the poli-
 ticians'  prospects and present
 the junta with a severe challenge.
 On the hopeful side are failure
 of planned weekend demonstrations,
 a slight diminution of labor
 problems,  and continuance of the
 military unity on which stability
 depends.
 If the junta vacillates,  its
 plans for transition will fail,
 and changes in the executive may
 result;  if it acts firmly,  it may
 achieve an orderly return to ci-
 vilian rule, with a new president
 taking office on 1 September.
 Parties which had indicated
 present or ultimate willingness
