 PALESTINIANS-SYRIA: Cease-Fire Prospects
 Arab mediators are continuing their efforts to arrange a permanent
 cease-fire between PLO chief Arafat and Fatah dissidents.
 Arafat yesterday announced his agreement to a cease-fire and
 said the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister had told him the dissidents also
 have accepted. There has been no independent confirmation thus far
 from the rebel side.
 The Kuwaiti official is a member of the delegation from the Gulf
 Cooperation Council that held talks on Tuesday with Syrian and PLO
 leaders in Damascus in an attempt to end the conflict. The mediators
 have scheduled further talks to strengthen the reported cease-fire
 and arrange peace talks.
 Comment: The cease-fire, if it takes hold, will be fragile at best.
 Arafat will be willing to risk further fighting in hopes that Arab leaders
 will succeed in preventing his opponents from forcing him to
 surrender.
 The dissidents and Syria, however, are unlikely to accept less
 than Arafat's capitulation. The rebels will use the lull to prepare to
 resume attacks if Arafat fails to reach an early agreement acceptable
 to them and Damascus.

 USSR-PALESTINIANS: Policy on Arafat
 The Soviets are avoiding public support for embattled PLO chief
 Arafat for fear of alienating Syrian President Assad, but an emphatic
 East German endorsement of Arafat suggests Moscow wants to avoid
 appearing to desert him.
 Palestinian news media have reported exchanges between Soviet
 leaders and Arafat during the current assaults by Syrian-backed
 rebels against his strongholds in northern Lebanon. Moscow
 yesterday acknowledged receipt of Arafat's congratulations on the
 anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, but it has not offered
 direct support in response to Arafat's thinly veiled public plea in
 mid-October for assistance against the rebels. The Soviet media's
 limited factual coverage of the dispute has avoided explicit support
 for Arafat's leadership.
 The official East German news service on Tuesday carried a
 Foreign Ministry declaration strongly endorsing Arafat and
 condemning the escalation of fighting among Palestinians. The
 statement appealed for a political dialogue and affirmed East German
 solidarity with Arafat.
 Comment: The renewed offensive against Arafat's forces
 apparently has not altered the USSR's hands-off policy toward the
 dispute. Moscow's refusal to respond to Arafat's plea for aid and its
 near silence on the recent fighting reflect an unwillingness to alienate
 Assad.
 The East German declaration probably was approved in Moscow
 and probably reflects Soviet misgivings about the dissidents' action.
 The Soviet leaders may privately voice their concerns to Syria's
 Foreign Minister, who is to arrive in Moscow today, but they are
 unlikely to press Assad very hard.
 The USSR probably is ambivalent about the radical domination of
 the PLO that would result from the dissidents' victory. Moscow almost
 certainly would welcome the radicals' resistance to participation in US
 peace initiatives.
 On the other hand, the radicals have not supported the
 international peace conference with Soviet participation that Moscow
 favors and have emphasized a strategy of military confrontation with
 Israel that the Soviets believe hurts the Palestinian cause. The Soviets
 would be concerned about PLO subordination to Syria and might
 take some cautious measures to help the organization remain
 independent.

 CHINA: Attack on "Spiritual Pollution"
 Beijing's developing campaign against the spread of Western
 influences in China will affect the coming party purge and may
 represent a challenge to General Secretary Hu Yaobang.
 Speeches by Politburo Standing Committee members Deng
 Xiaoping and Chen Yun at the party plenum last month-convened to
 begin a three-year "rectification" of the membership-prompted a
 nationwide drive to criticize the spread of "bourgeois liberalism" in
 China. Deng proposed a crackdown on Western philosophical ideas
 and popular culture, which he claimed cause "spiritual pollution,"
 especially among young Chinese. Several secondary leaders in
 cultural work already have undergone public self-criticism for
 publishing articles that depart from Marxist orthodoxy.
 Comment: The drive against "bourgeois" and "rightist"
 influences has distorted the once clearly antileftist focus of party
 rectification efforts and may slow the process. Media commentary in
 the provinces shows confusion over how to balance competing items
 on the political agenda. Leftist targets of the purge may be able to use
 Beijing's strong attack on liberalizing influences to counterattack.
 After years of sustained criticism directed at China's leftists, the
 immediate cause and the broader ramifications of Beijing's new
 initiative are unclear. Deng apparently shares the concerns of some
 party conservatives that political and economic reforms he has
 promoted have caused side effects that eventually could jeopardize
 the party's authority.
 Viewed against recent rumors that Hu's standing as Deng's
 political successor is in decline, the campaign may be an attempt to
 undermine him. Hu has not made a major pronouncement on
 "spiritual pollution."
 Hu is a strong proponent of party supremacy, but some party
 elders view many of his opinions as too liberal. Some of the first
 targets of criticism in the new campaign have previously backed Hu
 on ideological questions.

 USSR: Rumors About Recovery of Black Box
 A Soviet scientist                               says the
 Soviets have unreleased recordings of cockpit conversations and
 communications between the pilots of the South Korean airliner and
 ground stations. The scientist believes the Soviets have recovered the
 airliner's "black boxes" and that the information supports claims that
 the plane was on a spy mission.
 Comment: The Soviets are still searching in the Sea of Japan,
 suggesting that the flight and cockpit voice recorders have not been
 recovered. The source apparently believes the information he is
 passing, but he could have heard about communications that, in fact,
 are the same as those already released by the US. The USSR may be
 using Soviets with contacts in the West to circulate rumors justifying
 the shootdown. Moscow could be preparing to make a statement
 strengthening its claim about US involvement in the incident, hoping
 to embarrass the President during his visit to the Far East.
 JORDAN: Reaction to Attacks on Personnel
 Many Jordanian military officers are seeking retribution against
 the Syrian-sponsored Abu Nidal organization, Black June, the prime
 suspect in the recent terrorist attacks against Jordanian diplomatic
 personnel in three countries. The killing of one security guard and the
 wounding of another at the Jordanian Embassy in Athens on Monday
 occurred less than two weeks after assassinatio
 Jordanian Ambassadors in New Delhi and Rome
 Comment: The Jordanian officers hold the Syrians to be as
 responsible as Nidal for what they see as efforts to intimidate and
 humiliate the Jordanian Government. Although they would like to
 erase any impression that Jordan is sitting by helplessly in the face of
 such attacks, they probably have only limited capability to take
 retaliatory action. Moreover, senior government and military officials
 are unlikely to countenance such action, given Syria's unquestioned
 military superiority and its new boldness in the region.

 USSR: Trends in Foreign Trade
 Recently released Soviet data show a growing shift in trade
 toward other Communist countries, particularly in Eastern Europe.
 Trade increased by 7 percent in the first half of this year compared to
 the same period in 1982, with almost all of the improvement occurring
 in trade with Communist nations. Moscow's hard currency position
 has changed little compared with last year, although incomplete
 Western trade data indicate a 30-percent increase in spending for
 Western machinery. This growth was offset, however, by a decline in
 purchases of agricultural products, particularly US grain, which
 dropped by about 50 percent.
 Comment: The USSR had stated its intention to increase trade.
 with other Communist states. Much of the increased value of the
 Soviets' exports to their Communist partners is caused by higher
 Soviet oil prices, which in turn forced Eastern Europe to provide a
 greater volume of exports to the USSR. The rise in machinery
 purchases from Western countries largely reflects Soviet
 requirements for the gas export pipeline, as well as a rebound to
 levels recorded before hard currency shortages in 1981 forced
 spending cutbacks.

 NICARAGUA-COSTA RICA-US: Concern About Projects
 Nicaragua is likely to criticize several new civilian construction
 projects in northern Costa Rica, which are being built with the help of
 US military engineers. In late September Costa Rican President
 Monge proposed US help in several development projects, which
 include roadbuilding, improvement of an airstrip in the north, and
 medical treatment for refugees in UN camps. Panama also has agreed
 to provide assistance, and San Jose is seeking the support of some
 South American nations as well.
 Comment: The development plans will benefit the economy but
 will also improve security by providing access to remote regions.
 The projects' similarity to US-assisted efforts in Honduras will
 increase anxiety in Nicaragua over what the Sandinistas regard as
 US-sponsored military operations on their northern and southern
 flanks. Managua already has charged that the activities contradict
 Monge's neutrality policy. The Costa Rican request for assistance
 from other Latin American countries probably is an attempt to
 counter such accusations by regionalizing the effort.
 The EC Commission has announced its intention to give
 Nicaragua 4,000 tons of wheat as part of the EC's worldwide food
 aid program. The grant, valued at $628,000, will be distributed in the
 first half of 1984. In addition, the Commission last month allocated
 Nicaragua 7,200 tons of cereals as emergency relief for drought
 conditions. Last year Managua received only token amounts of wheat
 as food aid from the Community.
 Comment: EC food aid is granted for humanitarian reasons,
 and Nicaragua's inclusion this year does not reflect greater West
 European political support for the Sandinista regime. The Ten,
 however, are taking a more active interest in Latin American
 developments and may be increasing food aid to step up EC political
 and economic involvement in the region. The food aid also helps the
 Community reduce its growing stockpile of agricultural products,
 especially grains and dairy goods. Bolivia, Grenada, Guyana, and
 Honduras also are receiving allocations under the current EC
 programs.

 PAKISTAN: Opposition Trying To Regroup
 Antigovernment violence is declining, with President Zia
 apparently winning the first round against the opposition. The political
 parties remain divided but will have new opportunities to foment
 agitation as Zia takes a series of measures to reestablish civilian rule.
 Additional serious violence would make it difficult for him to achieve
 his objective of becoming the civilian president.
 Pakistani officials believe law and order is bein restored in rural                                                                                       25X1

 The US Consulate General in Karachi reports                                                                                       25X1
 only scattered demonstrations since late last month.
 Opposition to Zia has remained limited elsewhere. Only a few
 politicians have courted arrest in Baluchistan and North-West
 Frontier Provinces, and there have been no large demonstrations. In
 crucial Punjab Province, protests by lawyers and leftist labor
 elements have been easily contained, and most Punjabis have
 remained passive observers.
 Zia's Tactics
 The Pakistani President has stood firm in rural Sind by deploying
 Army and paramilitary units to reinforce local police. US diplomats
 report that at least 20 towns have been searched for arms and
 ammunition, and 4,000 political activists and party workers-mostly
 from the center-left Pakistan People's Party-have been arrested,
 substantially reducing the ranks of those available to organize further
 protests. Zia has avoided a serious incident that might have polarized
 sentiment outside Sind against him.
 The President also has moved to isolate the People's Party-the
 largest party in the loosely knit Movement for the Restoration of
 Democracy-branding it subversive and a tool of foreign interests.
 This characterization is aimed in part at capitalizing on popular
 resentment of "Indian interference." Remarks by Prime Minister
 Gandhi that she was concerned over the level of violence in Sind
 strengthened Zia in Punjab.
 In an apparent effort to divide his opponents, Zia has been
 holding talks with leaders of some conservative parties. The most
 powerful People's Party leader in Sind, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi,
 believes the disturbances have had their maximum impact, and he is

 however, the Movement has shown little inclination to negotiate.
 Zia's tactics appear to have allayed the concern of some senior
 Army officers that his Sind policy was too lenient, while satisfying
 other advisers who had recommended he negotiate with th
 politicians.
 Opposition Divided
 The opposition is divided and regrouping, but it is not cowed.
 People's Party leaders reportedly are unhappy with the uneven results
 of the civil disobedience campaign.
 Conservative and religious politicians are not prepared to make
 common cause with the People's Party. They fear it will suppress
 them if returned to power and that it will reverse the steps Zia has
 taken to Islamacize the nation. Zia has played to these fears by
 emphasizing his commitment to Islamization.
 Provincial elections are to be held next year, possibly as early as
 March. Zia's decision on who will be eligible to be candidates-which
 could come in December-is likely to provide the opposition its next
 issue for nationwide demonstrations.
 Most Pakistanis believe that Zia intends to exclude the parties.

 Zia has not ruled out an accommodation with some of the parties,
 but anything less than full participation will not satisfy most of the
 center-left opposition. The opposition would probably interpret any
 offer from the President as a sign of weakness. On the right, Zia must
 be careful not to appear to be conceding too much to the left or to be
 weakening his Islamization program.
 If, as is likely, Zia does not compromise with the politicians in the
 Sind and move to redress the separate political and economic
 grievances there, discontent will persist and renewed violence is
 likely. The unrest could be aggravated by Soviet and Indian
 involvement.
 If violence erupts again, Americans may become targets. The
 Embassy reports that US support increasingly is seen as crucial to
 Zia's survival,
 Protracted violence would threaten Zia's image as a strong "law
 and order" leader. In addition, the US Consulate in Karachi predicts
 that renewed violence in Sind will lead to more disruption and
 sabotage of the vital road and rail links between Karachi and the
 Punjab. Economic disruption in the Punjab would particularly
 undermine Zia's authority and the military's confidence in his ability to
 lead Pakistan.
