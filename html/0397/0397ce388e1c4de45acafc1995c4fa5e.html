 Obstruction of the anticorruption drive and refusal to confess, apparently considered
 more serious crimes than :orrnption itself, resulted in the death sentence for at
 least one cadre.  However, not the drive itself, b.*t the results, now are stressed,,
 with the obvious aim of convincing the Chinese people that the campaign. was a huge
 success.  Commerce and industry now have more enthusiastic and politically,  conscious
 workers, with management relegated to a secondary position.  The result:    increased,
 production of better goods at lower cost, 'with higher living standards near at, hand.
 Now that private business has learned its place, as obedient servant of.the!'workers_
 and State enterprises, workers "no longer come and go as they please, but work.
 according to schedule," which illustrates agRin why the drive led to closedfac'trries
 and hungry people.  Considirable doubt of the reality of this improved econc  '' arises
 from reports of State company moves to revive private business and open new markats
 for farm and village products; reports of factories still closed and workers
 depending upon relief; and reports of special steps required to train newly prombtgd
 workers.  A novel way was found to solve the problem of the East Chins hog market'
 collapse.  The Commanisto did not destroy surplus pigs, or even feed them'to.famiine
 victims; they killed 65,000 and sent them -co Russia.
 Inadequate cadre leadership is responsible for most. farm shortcomings,'including the
 serious insect plagues.  The farmers themselves are blamed, however,'for wasting their
 surplus on extravagant living, following superstitious practices, preferring public
 relief to Ccrttmunist leadership, and working their oxen to death.
 As the anticorruption drive disclosed appalling political indifference among workers,
 special indoctrination groups now will go right-into the factories to teach the sTaepel
 of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung, while "model informers'' and similar talented
 Personnel will be enrolled in special classes.  Other indoctrination moves. focused'
 attention on the teacher shortage an4 the plight of. grammar -school teachers, with,
 announcement of a small salary raise for~the teachers.  Obediently following Peki:ag'e
 _ead,,',regional'broadcasting stations repeated the Enoch-Quinn confessions and
 'attempted to revive the bacteriological warfare scare through reports of protest.
 meetings r'nd resolutions, climaxed by accounts of heroic Volunteers leaving for.
 Korea: buoyed by the tearful praise of their loved ones.
