 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUM
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 EAST-WEST RELATIONS
 Moscow promptly responded
 to President Kennedy's state-
 ment of 13 September to neutral
 leaders with a Foreign Ministry
 announcement that Gromyko would
 enter into an "exchange of
 opinions" on Berlin with Sec-
 retary Rusk during the UN
 General Assembly session.   This
 suggests that Moscow has not
 foreclosed the possibility
 of negotiating a settlement
 rather than proceeding with an
 East German peace treaty by the
 end of the year, and is in line
 with the increased Soviet stress
 on negotiations following
 Khrushchev's speech of 10 Sep-
 tember in Stalingrad.
 The Foreign Ministry
 statement noted that both the
 President and the British Gov-
 ernment had made statements
 expressing readiness for
 "serious talks" on Germany
 and other problems.   This line
 was apparently intended to
 mean that the President's
 statement had overcome Khru-
 shchev's doubts of US willing-
 ness to conduct "businesslike
 negotiations."  The Soviet
 statement also sought to imply
 a tacit assumption that Soviet
 terms--a peace treaty and a
 settlement on Berlin in that
 context--would be the basis
 for the talks.
 Soviet propaganda has
 given wide publicity to the
 Rusk-Gromyko talks but has
 maintained an ambivalent line
 on the possibility for a success-
 ful outcome.   Moscow noted that,
 while President Kennedy in his
 letters to Presidents Sukarno
 and Keita had expressed a
 21 Sept 61
 willingness to find a way out
 of the impasse over Berlin, the
 US still held to "old, unrealis-
 tic positions."  The communique
 of the Western foreign ministers
 meeting in Washington was criti-
 cized as "vague" and "failing
 to answer the main question" of
 whether the West was willing to
 seek a "peaceful solution to the
 German and Berlin problems through
 negotiations."
 On the other hand, a Polish
 diplomat told an American ob-
 server that he was convinced
 that the negotiations during
 the UN session could lead to a
 solution which would safeguard
 the   prestige of all concerned,
 The US Embassy in Moscow reports
 that according to contacts with
 the Foreign Ministry and information
 from other diplomats,  it is
 clear the Soviets are deliberate-
 ly taking the line that   the
 Berlin question will be resolved
 peacefully.   Gromyko told the
 Danish foreign minister during
 a stopover in Copenhagen that
 the USSR was receptive to nego-
 tiations, presumably referring to
 formal East-West talks.
 In anticipation of the
 talks in New York, Moscow has
 sought to exhibit a flexible
 approach to possible alternative
 solutions for Berlin.   In his
 conversations with former French
 Premier Paul Reynaud, Khrushchev
 agreed that'a settlement based
 on the status quo was a sensible
 policy and that the USSR sought
 only a "Juridical" basis for the
 status quo.   He went on to add
 that such a settlement need not
 involve de jure recognition of
 East Germany.   As for access to

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Berlin, Khrushchev told Reynaud
 that after a peace treaty it
 would be handled "practically"
 as it is now but on a different
 basis--that is, no longer on
 the basis of occupation rights.
 He also made it clear that
 access arrangements would have
 to be worked out with the East
 Germans.   Khrushchev said that
 all forms of access could be
 guaranteed by an "international
 agreement" which would be de-
 posited at the UN,  implying
 that the Soviets would partici-
 pate in guarantees.
 Khrushchev also used a
 message to the Interparliamentary
 Union to stress the possibility
 of adequate guarantees for Ber-
 lin.                 Although he was vague as
 to the form and procedure for
 implementing any guarantees,
 his message of 13 September
 asserted that "full freedom'
 of communications for
 the free city of West Berlin
 will be guaranteed by agree-
 ment with the German Democratic
 Republic and through active
 guarantees."  While denouncing
 "warlike circles" in the West
 for resorting to threats and
 provocations, Khrushchev claimed
 that the Soviet Union would
 "spare no effort to have the
 question of Germany resolved
 on the basis of agreement."
 He added that the Soviet Govern-
 ment was ready to negotiate
 "with leaders of the Western
 powers," provided that the
 talks would not be used to delay
 the signing of a peace treaty.
 In the week preceding the
 opening of the UN General
 Assembly, Moscow raised the
 possibility of a UN role in the
 German problem.   In reply
 to a question by Reynaud, Khru-
 shchev said he would favor
 transferring the UN headquarters
 to West Berlin.   He pointed out
 21 Sept 61
 to Reynaud that the USSR had
 offered to have the security
 of West Berlin guaranteed by
 either the UN, neutral states,
 or the three Western powers plus
 the Soviet Union.   Izvestia
 picked up this idea of a transfer
 of the UN in its editorial on
 the opening of the General
 Assembly session.   It stated
 that such a plan would deserve
 serious consideration and that
 transferring the UN to West
 Berlin was an example of the
 "favorable opportunities" which
 the creation of a free city
 would provide for West Berlin.
 Both Izvestia and Pravda
 stresse     at the admission
 of both German states would
 "benefit the cause of peace."
 Pravda also asserted that in
 view of the tense international
 situation,  "new and even greater
 efforts" are demanded from the
 statesmen attending the UN session.
 The more conciliatory Soviet
 line on Germany has been balanced,
 as in the past months, by pro-
 nouncements on Soviet military
 preparations in connection with
 the heightened tensions over
 Berlin.   In a series of articles,
 Marshals Malinovsky, Vershinin,
 and Moskalenko have stressed the
 quality of Soviet armaments and
 the continued preparations to
 strengthen Soviet defenses.
 Malinovsky stated that "we must
 prepare our armed forces for a
 strenuous, heavy, and excep-
 tionally fierce war."  Moskalenko
 boasted that Soviet forces pos-
 sessed powerful strategic rockets
 which made it possible "to at-
 tain the strategic goals of a
 war within a short period of
 time."
 Moscow apparently hopes to
 exploit the disarmament issue

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE .'WEEKLY SUMMARY
 in an effort to influence the
 Western positions on negotiations
 over Berlin.  The Soviet repre-
 sentative in the bilateral US-
 Soviet disarmament talks in
 New York virtually accepted a US.
 declaration on principles to
 govern a future disarmament con-
 ference.   He stressed the import.
 tance of a joint statement "at
 this juncture" as a means of
 lessening international tension
 and claimed that the USSR was
 compromising for the sake of
 "major political considerations."
 The switch in the Soviet
 attitude toward the US position;:
 suggests that the Soviet leaders
 hope to use an agreement on
 disarmament principles as a
 sign of their interest in con-
 structive negotiation with the
 US.  The Soviet leader may also
 see an agreement on disarmament
 principles as a useful gesture
 to improve the general atmosphere
 for the talks with Secretary
 Rusk.
 The Soviet reaction to
 the US resumption of nuclear
 testing followed the line fore-
 shadowed in Moscow's justifi-
 cation"of its own test.   Bloc
 propaganda charged that the US
 tests proved that preparations
 had been under way for some time,
 and that US haste in resuming
 tests exposed the "hypocrisy"
 of the Geneva negotiations on a
 test ban.
 On 14 September two West
 German F-84 fighters, en route
 to a West German base on a
 training flight from France,
 strayed into the Soviet Zone
 21 Sept 61
 and, when the pilots radioed that
 they had less than 20 minutes'
 fuel, were directed by West
 Berlin's air traffic control to
 land at Tegel airfield in the
 city's French .rector.  The Soviet
 controller . at`'-'the Berlin Air
 Safety Center (BASC) requested the
 French to detain the aircraft
 and pilots, and in a formal
 statement the Soviet section of
 the BASC warned that other air-
 craft in the corridors would
 suffer if the violators were
 released.
 The Soviets and East
 Germans lodged vigorous protests,
 denounced.the Western power`s
 for complicity in staging a
 provocation to torpedo negotia-
 tions between the USSR and the
 US, and sought to assert East
 German responsibility for air
 traffic.   On 17 September the
 East Germans delivered a note
 to the French headquarters re-
 questing the French authorities
 to surrender the two pilots "for
 a limited period of time for the
 purpose of conducting an in-
 vestigation.'"  The Soviet con-
 troller at BASC notified the
 French that if the fighters
 flew out without Soviet permis-
 sion, it would cause the most
 serious consequences.   Simultane-
 ously the USSR sent protests
 to the three Western powers
 and Bonn warning that in "similar
 cases" of violations by fighters,
 the aircraft would be destroyed
 if they refused a request to land.
 On 19 September the Soviet repre-
 sentative in BASC supported the
 demarche of the East Germans
 for participation in a  investi-
 gation of the incident.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SUCCESSOR TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL
 The UN faces a long period
 of turmoil over constitutional
 problems arising from the search
 for a new secretary general
 who will be acceptable to both
 the USSR and the West.   Soviet
 delegates continue to insist
 on their "troika" concept, but
 Afro-Asian pressure may lead
 to eventual appointment of a
 single successor.   Selection
 of so authoritative a figure as
 was Hammarskjold, however,  is
 unlikely.
 Burma, the UAR, Sudan, Morocco,
 and Iraq.   Under this plan the
 General Assembly would designate
 either the president of the
 current session--Mongi Slim of
 Tunisia--or outgoing president
 Boland of Ireland as interim
 secretary general.   The pro-
 cedure was designed to avoid,
 for the present,  expected
 Soviet vetoes in the Security
 Council of any nominee for
 the ? 'poS.i,t'i(>n  ' of~ Secretary
 general.
 Hammarskjold's death brought
 to a head the fight between East
 and West over the 1960 Soviet
 proposal for replacing the sec-
 retary general with a triumvirate
 representing the West, the Soviet
 bloc, and the neutrals.   The ttroi
 ka~  idea was not well received
 by the Afro-Asian members, many
 of whom recognized that such a
 reorganization would paralyze
 the Secretariat.   However,  it
 is possible that, in order to
 avoid a Soviet veto, UN members
 might agree to some version of
 the troika in the lower echelons
 of the Office of the Secretary
 General.
 The appointment of a new.
 secretary general is subject
 to the concurrence of the five
 permanent members of the council
 plus endorsement by a majority
 of the 99-member General As-
 sembly.   The assembly can, how-
 ever, decide that the choice of
 a new secretary general is an
 "important question" requiring
 a two-thirds majority vote.
 As a stopgap measure,  the
 concept of having the president
 of the General Assembly tem-
 porarily handle the duties of
 the secretary general was ap-
 parently well received by sev-
 eral UN members, including
 Boland told the US delega-
 tion on 18 September his canvass
 of UN members showed that the
 procedure would not be easy to-
 put across.   He reported that
 opposition came from "well-
 intentioned" delegations which
 believe that one man could not
 handle both jobs.   Other oppo-
 sition came from countries
 which are promoting specific
 candidates for the post and
 from the Soviet bloc, which is
 sticking to its troika proposal.
 Prior to Hammarskjold's
 death, most UN members were
 agreed that the next secretary
 general would come from Asia
 or Africa.   Mongi Slim, U"Thaint
 of Burma,  and C. V.  Narasimhan
 and Krishna Menon of India
 have been mentioned as possi-
 bilities.
 In the meantime,  the ad-
 ministrative duties of the
 ,;Secretary General's Office have
 been assumed by Narasimhan,
 recently appointed chef de cab-
 inet in that office; Andrew
 Cordier of the United States,
 under secretary for General
 Assembly affairs; and another
 American, Ralph Bunche, under
 secretary for political affairs.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 EAST GERMANY
 The repressive.:policies
 pursued by the Ulbri.t ht, . regime
 since sealing off West Berlin
 on 13 August appear to have
 evoked widespread opposition
 among the East German populace.,
 judging from continued reports
 in East German publications of
 arrests and trials of antire-
 gime elements, particularly
 youths.  However, legislation
 of 20 September gives Ulbricht
 legal means to invoke a state
 of emergency, suspend constitu-
 tional guarantees of individual
 rights, regiment the population,
 seize property, and change over-
 all state planning..  Typical of
 the., steps : possible under.:   .
 these sweeping emergency powers
 is the eviction of unreliable
 elements from homes along the
 Berlin sector and zonal border
 and probably the East - West
 German frontier areas.
 There are indications that
 opposition elements in the pop-
 ulation boycotted the local
 elections of 17 ' September ; an
 East German newspaper admits
 that Protestant pastors did
 not vote.. The general attitude
 of the population, nevertheless,
 appears to be one ofhopeless-
 ness.  The regime claims that
 "almost 98 percent" of eligible
 voters-cast ballots, that 99.96
 percent of valid votes approved
 the regime's single:slate,, andtt
 that only 322 of 215,000 .candi=
 dates were not elected.
 The forced recruiting of
 young men for the armed forces
 and security forces apparently
 has been one of the major causes
 of public resentment.   Letters
 from most East German areas con-
 firm that the regime has used a
 variety of pressures, including
 imprisonment in labor camps, to
 induce young persons--both men
 and women--to "volunteer."
 The regime claims to have
 enlisted more than 174,000 youths
 in this manner. Prior to the re-
 cruitment drive, over-all GDR
 mi.,litary 'strength.., iticludingj;security
 for ces, "was.;:'?e$ti sated at 143, 500.
 The defense bill of 20 Sep-
 tember further increases Ulbricht's
 already great powers as chairman
 of the State Council and of the
 National Defense Council.  Keyed
 to the alleged threat of "inten-
 sifi.ed war preparations by the
 West German militarists," the
 measure specifies that service
 in the armed. forces, as well as
 in civil defense, is "an honorable
 national duty of the citizens"

 The regime's move to im-
 prove security in East - West
 German border areas has been
 building up since 13 August.
 The regime is concentrat-
 ing a variety of pressures on
 the church, which still has a
 potential for rallying opposi-
 tion.` Evangelical Church
 leaders, such as Scharf, who
 are identified with the group
 supporting continued ties with
 West Germany are being publicly
 charged with "fascism" and
 other crimes, especially cur-
 rency manipulations. On 7 Sep-
 tember, Neues Deutschland bit-
 terly attar ed  c ar , reviving
 old charges that he had engaged
 in unlawful currency trans-
 actions and noting that legal
 proceedings had been instituted
 against him in 1957 for this
 offense and still stood on the
 books.
 Other churchmen are being
 similarly blackmailed in an
 effort to induce them to make
 public endorsements of the re-
 gime's "two Germanys" policies.
 For example, Bishop Krummacher
 of Greifswald was recently
 warned by the state secretary
 for church affairs that unless
 he ,would sign a declaration of
 support for the+:regime, "facts"
 about his sympathies for Nazism
 would be published.
 -The Catholic Church is also
 being subjected to special pres-
 sures in an effort.to induce
 churchmen to support the re-
 gime.  Many of these pressures
 are directed against newly 'con-
 secrated Bishop Bengsch of Ber-
 lin, an East Berliner. Bengsch
 is to meet with Ulbricht on 30
 September.  Another Catholic
 prelate-the bishop of Meissen
 --was warned on 30 August that
 he would have to take a "posi-
 tive position" concerning the
 13 August events, including
 an expression of political
 loyalty to the regime as the
 sole temporal authority to
 which he is answerable.

 Moise Tshombe and Mahmound
 Khiari, the Tunisian head of
 the UN's civil operations in
 the Congo, reached agreement
 late on 20 September for a pro-
 visional cease-fire in Katanga.
 This will provide an opportu-..
 nity for substantive negotia-
 tions concerning Katanga's re-
 integration with the Congo.
 Tshombe probably believes
 that the stipulated "freeze" on
 the movement of troops and sup-
 plies will permit him to main-
 tain his military superiority
 and to drive a  hard bargain in
 the negotiations.  UN officials
 in Leopoldville indicated on 20
 September that he was continuing
 to demand major concessions from
 the UN.  Earlceer he. had insisted
 that the UN not only forego any
 reinforcements but that its
 forces retire to their Katanga
 bases in return for a cease-
 fire.
 The UN's military position
 had been deteriorating.   A
 besieged Irish unit at Jadot-
 ville was overcome early this
 week, and UN officials in New
 York told American represent-
 atives  that the 3,000 Katangans
 who had been engaged in the
 operation were being organized
 by Interior Minister Munongo
 for a move to Elisabethville.
 The tJN garrison at Kamina was
 under attack from 1,000 well-
 armed tribesmen with Belgian
 officers.
 A planned UN airlift of
 one Indian and one or two
 Ethiopian battalions into Katanga
 had been halted by a combinition
 of Katangan air activity and.
 the inadequacy of night-flying
 aids.
 The flight to Elisabethville
 of three Ethiopian F-86 jets,
 which the UN had counted on to
 end Katangan air superiority,
 was held up pending UN as-
 surances that adequate naviga-
 tional  aids, fuel, and spare
 parts were available.. According
 to information received by the
 American delegation in New York,
 UN chief representative Linner
 had told his headquarters that
 unless the airlift could be
 resumed, "we seriously risk the
 defeat of UN forces."
 Brigadier Inder Jit Rikhye,
 --an Indian who was Hammarskjold's
 military adviser and who, with
 Under Secretary Ralph Bunche,
 seems to have assumed direction
 of the Congo operation--on 18
 September gave American officials
 his analysis of the difficulties
 encountered by-the UN forces in
 Katanga.  According to Rikhye,
 the original UN plan had had the
 limited objective of closing
 down the Elisabethville radio
 station.  However, the action
 triggered the return to their
 units of many of the European
 mercenaries who were in the proc-
 ess of repatriation, and fight-
 ing spread unexpectedly. The
 UN then found that the Katangans,
 in addition to their overwhelming
 numerical superiority, often
 were better armed than the UN
 troops.
 Rikhye added that the
 limited UN airlift capability--
 no aircraft larger than a DC-4
 is available--has prevented the
 use of either support artillery
 or transport in adequate quantity.
 He criticized the organization.'s
 intelligence staff, which he
 said frequently depended on re-
 ports from diplomatic posts in
 the Congo, and he stated that
 the Swedish and Irish troops had
 been trained mainly in police func-
 tions and thus were ineffective
 in combat.

 resolution favoring military
 action, and General Lundula,
 Gizenga's former military
 commander, has offered to
 place his troops at the dis-
 posal of the government for
 an operation against Katanga.
 Adoula, in a conversation
 on 18 September,  indicated to
 Ambassador Gullion that he
 realized such intervention
 probably would lead to civil
 war and stated that he hoped
 to head off pressure for mil-
 itary action through a series
 of delaying tactics.   Bunche
 told American officials on
 the same day, however,  that
 the Adoula government had
 asked the UN to put its troops
 in a position to fight on
 equal terms with the Katangans
 within 24 hours.   Leopoldville
 added that if the UN could not
 continue the fight, the Congo-
 lese Government would under-
 take operations of its own
 and would ask friendly coun-
 tries for assistance.
 On 19 September, Adoula
 informed the UN that his
 government would not give
 its approval to negotiations
 for a cease-fire and would not
 consider itself in any way
 bound by one.  Aware that his
 army is not equipped at this
 time for an operation against
 Katanga, Adoula probably took
 this step to appease the ele-
 ments seeking strong action
 against "Katanga.
 Anti-American sentiment

 even

 that

 bitterly resent UN accusations
 that the Belgian military
 are responsible for the fight-
 ing in Katanga, with the im
 plication that Tshomb6's
 mercenaries are under the
 control of the government of
 Belgium.   The American ambas-
 sador in Brussels  believes
 that   Belgian resentment can
 easily lead to  a rapid in-
 crease in neutralism in a
 country where fatalism and

 Ambassador Harriman, re-
 porting on his talks with Sou-
 vanna Phouma in Rangoon from
 15 to 17  September, stated
 that the discussions were more
 satisfactory than expected.
 Sotvanna, he said, showed a
 realistic awareness of the
 threat posed by the Pathet Lao
 to the future independence of
 Laos.   Discussing the elections
 to be held after a coalition
 government is established, Sou-
 vanna said that if the Pathet
 Lao forces emerged in control
 of the government there would
 be no recourse but to fight,
 as he and his followers were
 unwilling to see the country
 go  Communist.   He expressed
 his loyalty to the monarchy and
 his belief that demobilization
 of surplus forces of both sides
 must precede national elections.
 The question of the com-
 position of a neutralist center
 group in the proposed coalition
 cabinet remains unresolved.
 Souvanna persisted in his op-
 position to the admission of
 Vientiane moderates to the cen-
 ter group, contending that the
 Vientiane candidates were not
 "good material" and lacked pop-
 ular support.   He held  that in
 the formation of a unified army,
 integration should be by indi-
 viduals rather than by units;
 he recalled unsatisfactory past
 experience with unit integration.
 Talks at Ban Namone  be-
 tween the representatives of the
 Vientiane government, the Sou-
 vanna group, and the Neo Lao Hak
 Sat, suspended since August, were
 resumed on 20 September, but no
 progress was made.   Souvanna's
 proposal to meet with Boun Oum
 and Souphannouvong has been ac-
 cepted in principle by the royal
 government;  time,  place,  and
 other details are to be arranged
 by the representatives at Ban
 Namone.   Vientiane, however,
 continues to question Souvanna's
 suitability as premier.   General
 Phoumi, fearing a negotiated
 settlement and a resultant Sou-
 vanna-led coalition government
 but hoping to avoid the onus of
 breaking off the talks, may seek
 to prevent the meeting by impos-
 ing conditions unacceptable to
 the Souvanna and Pathet Lao
 groups.
 The military situation is
 marked by occasional skirmishing
 and artillery exchanges in north-
 ern Luang Prabang Province, where
 each side continues to consolidate
 its position in anticipation of
 possible renewed fighting at the
 conclusion of the rainy season
 next month.   Meo units continue
 to harass the enemy in Xieng
 Khouang Province.   Enemy efforts
 to eliminate the numerous Meo
 pockets have been notably un-
 successful in this area.   Al-
 though forced on occasion to
 withdraw to fall-back positions,
 the Meo units have maintained
 their capability for effective
 guerrilla-type action.
 At Geneva the Soviet dele-
 gation continues to indicate its
 desire for an early agreement,
 even in the absence of a pro-
 visional Laotian government.
 Discussions are being held on
 the procedure for dealing with
 a number of questions  over
 which there remains a wide diver-
 gence between the Western and
 Communist delegations.   While
 the UK and Soviet representa-
 tives,  as co-chairmen of the
 conference, have agreed to dis-
 pose of routine matters in pri-
 vate meetings, there is no in-
 dication that a speedy agreement
 can be reached on the more dif-
 ficult questions, which will
 continue to be discussed'in re-
 stricted session by the various
 delegations.

 French security officials
 are increasingly concerned over
 the covert rightist and military
 opposition to De Gaulle; other
 officials fear he is not taking
 sufficient steps necessary to
 retain the backing of politically
 important elements.   De Gaulle
 reportedly ignored pleas by
 cabinet ministers to call off
 his 21-24 September speaking
 tour of south-central depart-
 ments.
 A well-placed Interior
 Ministry official feels that
 unless De Gaulle creates a
 more solid popular basis for
 the regime as opposed to his
 person, "the days of the Fi'fth's
 Republic are numbered."  This
 official said Interior Minister
 Frey has been advised that

 their ability to maintain order
 in event of assassination.

 as demanded by restive farmers,
 and by announcing his intention
 to relinquish at the end of the,
 month the special powers which
 he assumed in April.   These
 powers have particularly aroused
 parliamentary ire.
 Despite the continuing
 large number of arrests of sus-
 pected members of the Secret
 Army Organization ' (OAS) --of-
 ficially blamed for the 8 Sep-
 tember assassination attempt--
 security officials admit that
 the OAS network has not been
 seriously damaged, even in
 metropolitan France, where it
 is much weaker than in Algeria.
 Security officers assigned to
 ferret out the OAS are only
 halfheartedly complying with
 orders, and it is questionable
 whether they would back De Gaulle
 or turn against him in a crisis.
 Minister for Algerian Af-
 fairs Joxe remarked to a US
 Embassy officer on 13 September
 that De Gaulle creates many
 difficulties for himself by
 his highhanded manner,  and
 that he hoped De Gaulle would
 soon explain to the French
 people in detail "exactly what
 is happening" with reference to
 Algeria.   Joxe commented to
 another US observer, however,
 that even though no coup is
 expected in Paris,  another one
 is sure to take place in Algeria.

 days to reduce some of the oppo

 GOVERNMENT AND PARTY CHANGES IN HUNGARY
 The changes among Hungar-
 ian party and government offi-
 cials announced on 13 September
 appear to be in the general
 pattern of steps recently taken
 in other satellite regimes.
 They are probably designed to
 facilitate the satellites' de-
 velopment along the economic
 and social lines called for by
 the Soviet bloc's blueprint
 for the achievement of social-
 ism.   The measures taken in
 East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
 and Rumania also involved re-
 organization of the government
 structure, so far not forthcom-
 ing in Hungary.
 Party First Secretary
 Janos Kadar, who assumed the
 additional position of premier,
 now is the titular as well as
 the actual head of government.
 Four newly appointed deputy
 premiers form an inner cabinet
 composed of politburo members
 who had been and presumably
 continue to be responsible for
 propaganda (Gyula Kallai), se-
 curity (Bela Biszku), interna-
 tional economic relations
 (Antal Apro), and domestic
 economic planning (Jeno Fock).
 The concentration of these
 talents at the head of the gov-
 ernment implies that there will
 be much more extensive efforts
 made to achieve planned eco-
 nomic and social goals.   The
 greater emphasis to be placed
 on the achievement of economic
 goals is also suggested by the
 reorganization of the national
 economic planning function. The
 former chief of the National
 Planning Office, Arpad Kiss,
 now heads a new committee con-
 cerned with long-range planning;
 his replacement in the old job
 is the former deputy, Miklos
 Ajtai,
 The complementary func-
 tions of persuasion and control
 will be administered respective-
 ly by Pal Ilku, the new minis-
 ter of culture and education,
 and by Janos Papp, the new min-
 ister of interiors   Ilku was
 chief of the political direc-
 torate of the Defense Ministry
 in 1956 and number-two man in
 the Culture Ministry until this
 appointment.   Papp is a rela-
 tively unknown party secretary
 from Veszprem County who pre-
 sumably will continue to work
 under the supervision of Biszku.
 The post of foreign minister,
 left vacant by the retirement
 of elderly Endre Sik, goes to
 the former deputy, Janos Peter,
 one-time delegate to the United
 Nations and a Protestant "peace"
 bishop.   The retiring premier,
 75-year-old Ferenc Muennich,
 was given the honorary post of
 minister of state.
 The gaps left by party
 leaders moving into government
 posts were filled by capable
 men already active in the party
 apparatus under Kadar's leader-
 ship.   Politburo members Dezso
 Nemes and Sandor Gaspar joined
 the party secretariat, left un-
 derstaffed by the departure of
 Karoly Kiss for an undesignated
 government post and Fock for

 ranking members of the party
 moved into the chief editorial
 posts of the party's theoret-
 ical journal and daily vacated
 by politburo members Nemes and
 Kallai.
 Along with the announce-
 ment of the new appointments,
 the party published revised es-
 timates for the second Five-
 Year Plan, to be approved at a
 forthcoming National Assembly
 meeting.   The plan directives,
 which supersede those issued at
 the time of the seventh party
 congress in September 1959,
 take a more conservative view
 of the prospects for developing
 the economy from 1961 to 1965.
 Investment targets  have been
 reduced.   The plan directives,
 emphasizing the need to meet
 international commitments and
 to strengthen national defense
 expenditures, appear to preclude
 any improvement in living stand-
 ards.
 Kadar also announced that
 the assembly will consider edu-
 cational reforms emphasizing
 technological training.  A terri-
 torial reorganization to estab-
 lish new economic regions and
 simplify administrative pro-
 cedures may also be promulgated.
 The party campaign against the
 church, a recently rumored
 tightening of control over the
 intellectuals, and a drive for
 more effective party activity
 all contribute to an atmosphere
 of pressure on the Hungarian
 people to accept the goal of a
 socialist state and societ .

 NORTH KOREAN PARTY CONGRESS
 Treading carefully the
 tightrope of Sino-Soviet com-

 party on 11 September. Flanked
 by his two chief guests--Frol
 Kozlov, secretary of the Soviet
 party central committee, and
 Teng Hsiao-ping, secretary gen-
 eral of the Chinese party--Kim
 ranged for six hours across a
 wide spectrum of North Korea's
 political and economic ambi-
 tions, always balancing his
 gratitude for Soviet assistance
 with similar expressions of ap-
 preciation for Chinese support.
 Both of the major antag-
 onists in last year's ideolog-
 ical controversy showed their
 competitive interest in North
 Korean party matters by the
 level of their delegations.,
 They avoided open polemics,
 however; like their Korean hosts,
 the Chinese and Soviet delegates

 the Soviet party draft program,
 for which the Chinese show some

 grudgingly offered Peiping's
 first comment on the Soviet
 program, citing it along with
 Soviet space achievements as
 proof of the socialist Sys-
 tem's superiority, but care-
 fully limiting its applicabil-

 lov provided the most tenden-

 Korean congress that the USSR
 was ready for a "great leap in
 its forward movement" because
 it had the necessary material
 standards--an implicit crit-
 icism of China's disregard of
 material factors when attempt-
 ing its own "leap." Both Teng
 and Kozlov made a point of
 praising Kim I1-sung's "cor-
 rect" leadership of the Korean
 party.
 Kim and the Koreans who
 followed him to the rostrum un-
 til the congress closed on 17
 September devoted the bulk of
 their attention to the two
 prime Pyongyang objectives--
 economic development and Korean
 reunification.
 Outlining the new seven-
 year plan which started this
 year, Kim described final pro-
 duction targets that are rough-
 ly those set in August 1960
 when the plan was first made
 public. The regime has refined
 the original plan, however, to
 give itself more ~eeway; in al-
 most every case the figures
 announced in August have become
 the upper limit of a more com-
 fortable range. The new targets
 still represent significant
 increases in output of major in-
 dustrial products.   The only
 major revision was in the grain
 target for 1967: originally put
 at over 9,500,000 tons, it now
 is at 6,700,000 tons, a much
 more realistic goal.
 While there is little
 chance that the average North
 Korean is going to see much im-
 provement in his living standard
 over the next seven years, Kim
 painted a glowing picture of
 life in the North when the plan
 is completed.  He contrasted
 this with the "bankruptcy" of
 South Korea.
 Arguing that unification
 makes economic sense, Kim
 termed "peaceful reunification"
 the "supreme national task which
 brooks no delay."  The North
 Korean premier and party chief
 urged South Koreans'to form a
 "united anti-US national salva-
 tion front," and, in a portion
 of his speech that was virtually
 an incitement to civil disobedi-
 ence and military mutiny, called
 on Southern civilians to con-
 duct strikes and demonstrations.
 The South Korean Army, Kim said,
 must wrest command from the "US
 imperialists" and become a "na-
 tional army defending the inter-
 ests of peasants and workers.".
 The party appointments an-
 nounced at the end of the con-
 gress include a politburo that
 reflects Kim I1-sung's predom-
 inance.   Through purge and skill-
 ful reshufflings, Kim apparently 25X1
 has consolidated his hold since
 the abortive challenge to his
 leadershin in  1 a+A 145.

 COMMUNIST GUERRILLA ACTIVITY IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 A series of Communist at-
 tacks since the first of Sep-
 tember provides evidence of in-
 creased guerrilla capability
 in South Vietnam, particularly
 in the northern part of the
 country.   On 1 September, a
 Viet Cong force estimated at
 two battalions totaling about
 1,000 men temporarily overran
 two Civil Guard outposts in the
 mountainous terrain adjacent
 to southern Laos..  The temporary
 capture on 18 September of a
 provincial capital only 40 miles
 north of Saigon by a Communist
 force of two. battalions--which
 killed the provincial governor
 and..set fires in the town--is
 the most striking indication to
 date of increased Viet Cong
 aggressiveness recently evident
 in the capital area.   In these
 and other actions by smaller
 units,  the Viet Cong displayed
 better organization, direction,
 and equipment than previously
 noted.
 Although there have been
 several reports of a Vietnamese
 Communist build-up.across the
 border in Laos,  there is no
 evidence that regular North
 Vietnamese forces were used in the
 1 September attack.   As was the
 case in similar attacks in this
 area in October 1960, the bulk
 of the Viet Cong force probably
 consisted of local recruits--
 principally from among the
 minority tribes in this high
 plateau area where the Com-
 munists have been promoting an
 autonomous movement--with a
 hard core of North Vietnamese
 or North Vietnamese - trained
 leaders infiltrated through
 Laos.
 Increased Pathet Lao in-
 fluence in southern Laos.  and
 the difficulty of d'etect'ing
 movements along remote mountain
 trails have given the Communists
 virtually unrestricted access
 for the infiltration of personnel
 and supplies from North to South
 Vietnam via Laos.   As a result,
 the Communists are expected to
 step up their armed effort,
 particularly in the northern part
 of South Vietnam,and may intend
 to develop a major base of
 operations in the high plateau
 area bordering Laos.
 Armed Communist strength
 throughout South Vietnam has
 increased since the beginning
 of the year despite casualties
 totaling, according to South
 Vietnamese figures, about 1,000
 monthly.  The Viet Cong is es-
 timated to have about 15,000
 men under arms, as compared with
 about 10,000 at the end of 1960.
 During July, the rate of Commu-
 nist activity reached close to
 an all-time high, with a weekly
 average of about 350 incidents of
 all kinds reported; after some de-
 cline in August,  the rate in early
 September was about 300.   During
 the past three months, nearly 70
 percent of Viet Cong attacks have
 been directed at the less effec-
 tive Civil Guard and Self-Defense
 Forces rather than at regular
 army units.
 There is as yet no area where
 control by the Viet Cong is suf-
 ficiently entrenched to beat off
 strong government challenges, al-
 though they approach that state in
 some parts of the southernmost prov-
 inces, their major stronghold. Recent
 sweeps by government forces have
 probably dealt some setbacks - to the
 Viet Cong in this region, but the
 government's ability to maintain
 the advantages gained by such action
 is uncertain.  The general insecurity
 and frequent interdiction of main
 routes  leading to Saigon has disrupted
 South Vietnam's rice and hog exports for

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The compromise reached last
 week by Turkey's ruling Committee
 of National Union (CNU)--to
 uphold the,Yassiada tribunal's
 death sentences for former Prime.
 Minister Menderes and two as-
 sociates but to commute 12
 others to life.id,xnprisonment,-
 has somewhat lessened the)tchances
 that supporters of Menderes' out-
 lawed Democratic party will spark
 disorders.  There now appear to
 be no impediments to beginning
 the campaign--scheduled to open
 on 24 September--for the 15
 October elections.
 The 22-man CNU reached
 its decision at a long.ses-
 sion on the evening of 15
 September, apparently under
 pressure from younger mili-
 tary officers outside the
 committee who pressed for up-
 holding the death sentences
 of all persons condemned. These
 officers feel that failure to
 execute all leaders of the
 Menderes regime constitutes
 disavowal of the military coup
 which overthrew Menderes in May
 1960.
 The CNU apparently felt
 that its final decision would
 prevent the younger officers
 from venting their frustration
 in a new coup attempt, but by
 upholding the three death
 sentences it has introduced into
 Turkish. politics an element of
 bitterness which is likely to
 persist for years.
 !-     Ismet Inonu, leader of the
 Republican People's party (RPP)
 and long an adversary of Menderes,
 privately urged the CNU not to
 permit executions, as did other
 party leaders and influential
 leaders of the press.   If the
 CNU.p,ermits free balloting to
 take~,place, the RPP may fall
 short.-of a majority as voters
 protest the executions by voting
 for one of the parties openly
 appealing t0 ,Menderes' former
 supporters.  Earlier this month
 the CNU sought the agreement of
 all,)political party leaders to
 forego any discussion of the past
 and particularly the justification
 of the May 1960 coup.  All poi-1
 litical party leaders except Osman
 Bolukbasi, the leader of the small
 Republican Peasant Nation party,
 signed this declaration,..   Despite
 the present restrictions on
 freedom of speech and of the press,
 it-appears virtually impossible
 for the CNU to enforce this ban.

 that day.  Elements of the op-
 position continue to favor a
 general strike against the
 government, and proponents of
 violent action are gaining the
 ascendancy in 'Various opposition
 groups--even the politically
 moderate National Civic Union
 (UCN), which has wide backing
 among business, professional,
 and other mi.ddl.e class elements.
 Although President Bala-
 guer's liberalization program
 has almost universal acceptance
 in principle, the opposition
 is convinced that the President
 is not sufficiently forceful
 in implementing his program
 and that,  in any event, meaning-
 ful progress is impossible as
 long as the essential elements
 of power are ;held by General
 Ramfis Trujillo.  The opposition
 groups are Obsessed by the
 desire to rid the country
 quickly of all remnants of the
 Trujillo dictatorship and em-
 boldened by the wide national
 solidarity their movement has
 generated.
 Although opposition groups
 encompass the bulk of literate
 Dominicans, they probably at
 present lack the capability of
 taking over from Balaguer
 :h+gainst the;::entrbnnhrad- military,
 which seems to be united if
 only temporarily and in the in-
 terests of self-preservation.
 The immediate danger to the
 present regime is the pos-
 sibility of a military take-
 over, with or without the con-
 currence of General Ramfis Tru-
 jillo.              The military was appar-
 ently on the verge of such
 action twice during the past
 month,  Such an event would
 prolong and further embitter
 the transition period and in-
 crease the likelihood of a
 concerted campaign of violence
 by the opposition.   It would
 also almost certainly lead to
 the eventual factionalization
 of the military.
 The OAS subcommittee, which
 arrived on 12 September to
 determine whether conditions
 warrant partial removal of the
 OAS sanctions against the regime,
 Is receiving the full coopera-
 tion of the government.   The
 opposition is urging continua-
 tion or even intensification
 of the sanctions until political
 liberties are fully guaranteed;
 any easing of the sanctions
 now would result in widespread
 public bitterness against the
 OAS and, by extension, against
 the United States.
 The Apposition's complaint
 that the US is giving moral sup-
 port to Balaguer's gradual ap-
 proach to democratization has
 reduced the opposition's regard
 for the US to the lowest point of
 any time in the past two years,
 in the opinion of the consul
 general.  He reports that some
 opposition members say that if
 the June 1959 invasion of the
 country, which was mounted by
 the (Castro regime, were to be
 repeated now, "everyone would
 side with the invaders."
 The United States is likely
 to be attacked as a result of
 the signing on 16 September of
 a contract between the Dominican
 Government and a private US
 firm for the construction of
 an oil refinery in the Dominican
 Republic. Petraleum:,. is one of   25X1
 the products now embar oed under

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The 7-21 September visit
 of Cuba's President Osvaldo
 Dorticos and Foreign Minister
 Raul Roa to Czechoslovakia and
 the USSR appears thus far to
 have produced little but routine
 assurances of bloc "solidarity"
 with Cuba.   A trip to Communist
 China is to follow,   D6rticos'
 trip to the bloc, coming im-
 mediately after his attendance
 at the conference of nonaligned
 nations in Belgrade., may further
 help to convince some of the
 neutralist nations of Cuba's
 full alignment with the bloc.
 The Cubans' actions in
 railing against the United
 States and in echoing the
 Soviet line on most of the
 issues taken up at the con-
 ference largely destroyed
 the sympathetic attitude to-
 ward. Cuba initially held by
 many conference delegates
 Bloc countries, besides
 taking 4,000,000 tons of Cuban
 sugar this year at a price
 equivalent to four cents a
 pound, are in some instances
 also acting as. middlemen in
 arranging purchases of Cuban
 sugar by Asian, Middle Eastern,
 and-African states.
 Cuba is similarly relying
 on three-way trading arrange-
 ments with nonbloc countries
 to dispose of some of its ex-
 ports and to obtain imports not
 available in the bloc.
 Within Cuba, the antiregime
 outbursts of churchgoers on.two
 occasions within the past two
 weeks were the first serious
 manifestations of opposition,:;to
 Castro in many months.  The re-
 gime has reacted with a concerted
 government campaign against the
 Roman Catholic Church.  The ex-
 pulsion on 16 September of 136
 priests--including Havana Bishop
 Eduardo Boza Masvidal and 45
 other Cuban priests reduced by
 almost half the number of
 priests remaining in Cuba.   Fur-
 ther religious demonstrations
 may give impetus to a government
 move to establish a "national
 church" with loyal pro-Castro
 clergy.
 Sporadic outbreaks of fight-
 ing between dissidents and Cas-
 tro's militiamen have occurred
 in at least two of Cuba's six
 provinces.  in 'Pinar del Rio,
 the island's westernmost prov-
 ince, a small group of insur-
 gents was operating as recently
 as mid-September under the com-
 mand of an anti-Castro leader
 known as "Cara Linda," while
 another group was reported active
 in northern Las Villas Province.
 In all cases, government forces
 possess greatly superior. resources
 and are capable of eliminating
 the outbreaks eventually.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ARGENTINA
 President Frondizi, demon-
 strating growing confidence in
 his ability to deal with Argen-
 tina's domestic problems, has
 increased his attention to for-
 eign policy in recent months,
 and with the resignation of Pres-
 ident Quadros in Brazil he will
 bid for a dominant position
 among Latin American leaders.
 During the earlier part
 of his term, Frondizi was pre-
 occupied with the repercussions
 of his US-backed economic stabi-
 lization program--the austerity
 aspects of which are still a
 source of labor difficulties.
 During 1961, however, he has
 seemed increasingly interested
 in reasserting Argentina's claim
 to diplomatic leadership of the
 Latin American nations.   Unlike
 many of his predecessors, Fron-
 dizi has generally sought to ex-
 ercise this leadership in sup-
 port of US objectives rather
 than in rivalry with Washington,
 as shown in his strong backing
 of the "Alliance for Progress"
 and his more cautious assistance
 to US policy on Cuba.
 Frondizi has engaged in a
 series of consultations with
 other Latin American presidents.
 Following earlier visits with
 the chief executives of Uruguay,
 Brazil, and Bolivia, he visited
 President Stroessner of Para-
 guay on 2 July and made a
 public promise to improve high-
 way connections between the two
 distant capitals.   His most re-
 cent visit was to President
 Alessandri of Chile from 9 to
 11 September, concluding with
 the  gn1n  of the joint "Dec-
 laration of Vina del Mar," which
 called for "total compliance"
 with the United Nations Charter
 to maintain peace, and expressed
 concern over "the renewal of
 nuclear testing."  Later this
 month Frondizi is to confer
 briefly with President Betancourt
 of Venezuela.
 Frondizi's diplomatic
 efforts have been indirectly
 aided by the events in Brazil,
 which has traditionally vied
 with Argentina for leadership
 among the Latin American states.
 Brazilian prestige has suffered
 considerably from the develop-
 ments ending in Joao Goulart's
 replacement of Quadros, and
 Ambassador Rubottom in Buenos
 Aires believes Frondizi now
 will "more openly wear the man-
 tle of hemisphere leadership."
 He will probably make an effort
 to assume such a role in his
 address'to the United Nations
 General Assembly scheduled for
 27 September.
 In his pro-US and anti-
 Castro moves Frondizi has had
 the strong support of the Argen-
 tine military; he has at the
 same time tried to conciliate
 more radical opinion by moves
 apparently designed in part to
 demonstrate his independence
 of Washington.   One of these
 was his widely publicized meeting
 with Che Guevara on 18 August,
 which raised a political storm.
 Frondizi reassured military
 leaders that the meeting would
 in no way modify Argentina's
 firm position on Cuba and Commu-
 nism, but controversy as to how
 the meeting was brought about
 led eventually to the resignation

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY '9RT
 President Roberto Chiari's
 announcement on 11 September
 that Panama would seek a new
 treaty with the United States
 is the result both of mounting
 domestic political pressures
 and of the assumption that the
 international climate is propi-
 tious for Panama's reassertion
 of its claims against the US
 position in the Canal Zone.
 Chiari has been unable after
 a year in office to gain control
 of his country's chaotic polit-
 ical situation or to stem its
 economic deterioration.   He
 must therefore identify himself
 strongly with the Panamanian
 peoples' mounting determination
 to assert their claims against
 the United States if he is to
 maintain popular support.
 The President is impatient
 to raise the Canal Zone treaty
 issue now so as to appear the
 champion of national interest.
 Expecting to come under heavy
 attack on various counts when
 the National Assembly convenes
 on I October,  Chiari has al-
 ready announced that his address
 that day will detail Panama's
 new treaty requests.
 The Sovereignty Issue
 Panama's national aspira-
 tions in the Canal Zone have
 a strong appeal to its people
 and constitute the most power-
 ful unifying factor in a country
 of wide social,  political, and
 economic divisions.   The 1936
 and 1955 revisions of the
 original 1903 Conventiomm betseen the
 US and Panama have not satisfied
 these aspirations,  particularly
 the almost obsessive desire for
 recognition of Panamanian sov-
 ereignty in the zone.
 Panama realizes it is not
 now equipped to operate the
 canal itself and is unlikely to
 ask to do so in the course of
 this attempt to renegotiate the
 basic treaty.   Rather, it will
 probably want a clear acknowledg-
 ment of Panamanian sovereignty
 in the Canal Zone; an increase
 in the $1,930,000 annuity;  re-
 duction of US commercial ac-
 tivities in the zone;  stricter
 interpretation of the US treaty
 rights of "operation, maintenance,
 sanitation, and protection of
 the canal";  and possibly the
 turnover of some lands within
 the zone border for agriculture.
 Panamanians have long con-
 tended that the 1903 treaty was
 hastily drawn up before the newly
 independent country's government
 was properly consulted.   They
 point out also that the treaty
 was signed for Panama by a
 Frenchman, Buneau Varilla, who
 was acting as diplomatic agent
 for the newly independent country
 while promoting the interests
 of a French canal company.
 They object particularly to the
 US interpretation of the sovereign-
 ty clauses and to the treaty's use
 of the words "in perpetuity,"
 claiming the term is not valid
 in international law.
 Exploitation of the Issue
 Panamanian sensitivity
 over the sovereignty issue
 extends into many fields.   In
 a note of 31 August protesting
 a recent National Labor Relations
 Board decision permitting US
 unions to organize crews of US-
 controlled ships flying the
 Panamanian flag, the Chiari
 government termed this an in-
 fringement of sovereignty.   The
 decision also threatens lucrative
 public and private income from
 registry and representation of
 foreign ships in Panama and the
 prestige of at least nominal
 possession of one of the world's
 largest merchant fleets.
 Panamanian spokesmen have
 applied the sovereignty question
 to so many aspects of US activity
 relative to their country that
 the issue has become basic to
 national policy.   They insist that
 recognition of their "sovereign
 rights" is more important than
 financial assistance for their
 economy and their unbalanced,
 potentially explosive social
 system.   Almost 10 percent of
 Panama's labor force is unemployed.
 Unlike other urban Latin Americans,
 most of these idle workers can

 read.   They congregate along the
 streets of Panama City and Colon,
 a receptive audience for Panama's
 sensationalist press and radio.
 Both emphasize nationalist issues
 constantly.
 One group of newsmen, ap-
 pearing on a US television
 program, argued that since canal
 tolls have been unchanged since
 1914, they could be raised to
 increase Panama's annuity with-
 out cost to the United States.
 All Panamanian elements
 actively engaged in exploiting
 the canal issue firmly believe
 that the United States is par-
 ticularly vulnerable to world
 opinion.   This has led on the
 one hand to discussion of the
 canal issue by Panamanian
 diplomats at international
 meetings, such as the United
 Nations and the Organization
 of American States, and on
 the other hand to threats to
 instigate violence in order to
 dramatize the issue.   Extremist-
 led mobs had this strategy in
 mind in November 1959, when US
 troops held back efforts to
 plant Panamanian flags in the
 Canal Zone during Panamanian
 independence day demonstrations.
 The subsequent display of the
 Panamanian flag on a zone staff
 near the border and the re-
 sumption of more amicable re-
 lations with zone residents
 and administration have not
 dissipated the basic aspirations,
 Panama's leaders indignantly
 reject any suggestion that Pana -
 ma's record of political and
 economic instability or its
 failure to effect reforms can
 have any bearing on the basic
 issue of the sovereignty of
 the Canal Zone,  or could affect
 the security of the canal itself.
 The Economy
 Panama's entire economy
 has been'geared to the canal
 since construction was begun
 in 1904.   Population and
 economic activity are dis-
 proportionately concentrated
 in the two cities adjoining
 the canal terminals, Panama
 City and Colon, while develop-
 ment of agriculture, industry,
 and transportation in the
 interior has been virtually
 ignored.   Large and potentially
 valuable agricultural areas
 are either inaccessible or left
 idle by large landholders.
 A small clique representing
 about 5 percent of Panama's million
 people controls the sources of
 both economic and political power.
 This group invests its funds in
 commercial, real estate, and
 shipping registry and represen-
 tation ventures which are highly
 profitable but create little or
 no economic growth or employment.
 Thus while Panama ranks near the
 top among Latin American countries
 in per capita income,  prices are
 high and most of its people
 contribute little to the economy
 and live in great poverty.
 The Oligarchy
 The ruling clique has long
 been adept at deflecting toward
 the United States any internal
 dissatisfaction with its actions
 In promoting this antagonism its
 members often associate closely
 with anti-American extremists.
 The latter, many of them sus-
 pected Communists,  have access
 to sensitive government positions,
 influential news columns, and
 teaching posts.
 Many of the oligarchy are
 well educated,  experienced in
 business, and knowledgeable in
 world affairs but refuse to
 admit the danger of fomenting
 nationalism through these extrem-
 ists  and do nothing to develop
 Panama's capacity to order its
 own affairs.   These leaders
 offer plans for the improvement
 of their country, but have taken
 no steps to end the long-standing
 corruption,  indifference,  and
 self-serving political and
 financial scheming which defeat
 such plans.
 Two important factions in
 the government are headed by de-
 termined rivals for the presi-
 dency.   Finance Minister Gilberto
 Arias of the Third Nationalist
 party is a member of the Arias
 Madrid family,  probably the
 single most powerful influence
 in Panamanian economic and news

 affairs.   He  is opposed by
 Second Vice President Jose
 Dominador Bazan,.a shrewd poli-
 tician with the calculated
 backing of economic interests
 centered in Panama's Republican
 party.   Although both have finan-
 cial resources, neither bears
 the onus of membership in the
 small handful of Spanish families
 which has long dominated the
 ruling oligarchy.   If either
 Arias or Bazan should decide
 that association with the ad-
 ministration is a liability
 and break with Chiari, the
 President's already limited
 ability to govern effectively
 would be weakened and many
 political dissidents would be
 encouraged to become  active.
 The opposition press and
 radio have already referred to
 the need for a new cabinet if
 Panama is to realize any benefit
 from President Kennedy's Al-
 liance for Progress program,
 and Chiari's cancellation of
 a planned vacation in September
 indicates some political ma-
 neuvering is probably going on.
 Chiari's coalition does not
 have a majority of the deputies,
 and what positive programs he
 may present for tax,  land, and
 other reforms seem to have
 little chance of legislative
 approval.by the highly volatile
 multi-party assembly.
 While other Latin American
 countries usually support Pan-
 amanian claims in the Canal Zorn
 they have never pressed the issue.
 Foreign Minister. Solis refused
 a renewed invitation for Panama
 to join the Central American
 economic and political organ-
 izations in July, saying the
 decision must wait until his
 country could "integrate" into
 its economy all its lands and
 referring specifically to the
 Canal Zone.   He was disappointed
 to receive only a mild statement
 of backing from his Central
 American colleagues meeting in
 Tegucigalpa.
 From time to time there
 have been suggestions that the
 canal be "inter-Americanized,"
 but Panama feels that any change
 in the canal's status should
 be its reversion to Panama as
 its only natural resource.
 Communists and Castroites
 Stronger but unsolicited
 support has come from Latin Amer-
 ican Communists.  The Communist*i
 sponsored Latin American Congress
 for National Sovereignty, Economic
 Emancipation, and Peace, which
 met in Mexico in March, strongly
 backed Panama as another vic-
 tim of "US imperialism."  Al-
 though Panama's relations with
 Cuba are not friendly, they have
 not been broken off, and Castro
 officials periodically use the
 canal issue in diatribes again.25X1
