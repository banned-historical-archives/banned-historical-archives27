 East Asia in the 1990s:
 The Consequences of Economic
 Reform in China
 Scope Note           By assessing the economic impact in East Asia of successful, high-growth,
 economic reform in China, this paper tests the assumption that such reform
 will be a major force for stability in the Pacific Basin.
 The reform process we visualize through the end of the century-wide-
 ranging, market-oriented policy changes that would produce a 7-percent
 average annual growth in the Chinese economy and open trade with the
 rest of the world-is not the most likely path for Beijing. Indeed, analysts
 in the Directorate of Intelligence believe that, even if the economic reforms
 are fully implemented, numerous bureaucratic and economic rigidities may
 prevent China from achieving the "miracle" growth registered by Japan in
 the 1960s and South Korea in the 1970s. Nevertheless, the Japanese and
 South Korean examples of xenophobic societies turning their economic
 energies outward suggest that a sharp break with China's past should not
 be discounted too readily. In addition, analysis of the regional effects of the
 high-growth scenario is important for setting a benchmark for the more
 likely moderate, reform-induced, economic growth that China will proba-
 bly experience over the next 15 years.

 East Asia in the 1990s:
 The Consequences of Economic
 Reform in China
 Key Judgments Successful economic reform in China would confront Washington with
 Information available both opportunities and threats. On the one hand, a more market-oriented
 as of I December 1986 China would serve US strategic interests:
 was used in this report.
 ? A China that sees its future dependent on the West will be less likely to
 lean toward the Soviets, and its increasing desire for markets, technology,
 and industrial supplies probably will make Beijing's foreign policy-
 which has been marred in recent years by border disputes with Vietnam
 and India-less contentious.
 Far-reaching reform in China-although not the most likely outcome-
 could nevertheless create problems in East Asia that would hurt US
 interests there by the turn of the century:
 ? The vast expansion in Chinese exports that we judge reform would
 produce, and China's appetite for international capital, would adversely
 affect the rival economies of Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
 Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. These countries export many of the
 same products-a mix of primary commodities and light manufactures-
 that China would export; further, they could not offset the damage by
 competitively producing the products-capital and high-technology
 goods-that China would import.
 ? Even though Beijing would be less beligerent, the political influence that
 would accompany China's rapidly expanding economic role in the region
 would probably increase longstanding security concerns in several East
 Asian countries-particularly Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. We
 believe such a development could create opportunities for Moscow to
 make both economic and political inroads.
 China's rapid development would also produce major economic "winners"
 in the region. Japan, in particular, would probably garner a large share of
 China's expanding import market. Further, Japan is well poised to take
 advantage of high rates of return on capital invested in China because of its
 large trade surpluses and deregulated financial markets. The East Asian
 NICs (newly industrializing countries)-Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
 and South Korea-would benefit fully from China's growth if they
 continue restructuring their economies toward more capital intensive
 production-a process that would be reinforced, in our view, by China's
 growing economic presence in the region.

 Under these circumstances, successful reform in China would sharply
 redistribute income in East Asia from the developing countries and
 Australia and New Zealand to Japan and the NICs. We believe that the
 losers in this process would react to Chinese competition by raising stiff
 barriers to imports in order to insulate their industries and workers from
 the detrimental effects of Chinese trade. The danger is that the resulting
 slowdown in economic growth in these countries could contribute to
 political tensions that threaten the stability of governments friendly to the
 United States.
 In any case, Washington would face increasing pressures from the losers of
 reform in China to "make up" for their China losses. The developing
 countries, for example, would undoubtedly request additional aid and
 preferential trade to ease the economic pain associated with successful
 reform in China. Increased security concerns in the region would also lead
 some East Asian countries to look to Washington to provide a security
 buffer to the Chinese. In return they would probably show increased
 support for maintaining the US military presence in the Philippines.

 East Asia in the 1990s:
 The Consequences of Economic
 Reform in China
 The Jump Forward: A Profile
 The Chinese economy has a huge and as yet untapped
 economic potential. China is well endowed with natu-
 ral resources-such as coal, iron ore, and petroleum-
 has the largest labor pool in the world, and is free
 from the debt burdens of other developing countries.
 Experience in other Chinese-speaking countries, such
 as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, attests to the
 work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit of Chinese cul-
 ture and underscores the almost limitless possibilities
 that could be unleashed by market-oriented economic
 reforms. Double-digit growth in the Asian NICs
 (newly industrializing countries)-South Korea, Sin-
 gapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan-during the 1970s
 and 1980s sets a precedent for rapid economic devel-
 opment in China-a comparison not lost on Beijing's
 economic planners.
 The growth potential of the Chinese economy ironi-
 cally results from its current inefficiency as well as its
 large resource base. Because China's economy is one
 of the least efficient in the world, even small improve-
 ments in efficiency can increase output dramatically.
 The nonmarket character of the economic system
 distorts relative prices and wages, resulting in severe
 production inefficiencies, wasteful use of energy and
 other resources, and poor product quality.' State-set
 prices have been changed infrequently since the
 1950s, and some goods pile up in inventory while
 others are in chronic shortage. Broad implementation
 of reforms would result in a more productive use of
 resources and the production of goods that could
 compete in world markets.
 Our vision of successful reform-although not the
 most likely path for Beijing to take-thus includes
 "rationalizing" the price system so that prices and
 wages reflect supply and demand rather than govern-
 ment policy, and decentralizing economic decision
 making to the point that allows managers of firms to
 react to changes in prices. A successful reform pro-
 gram would be wide ranging-reaching industry and
 urban areas, thus going well beyond the steps already
 taken toward commercializing agriculture. Moreover,
 in order to minimize the costs of reform such as
 inflation and large trade deficits, Beijing would move
 fairly quickly to improve the ability of economic
 technocrats to prime the economy with traditional
 monetary and fiscal policies used in developed
 countries.
 Impact of Reform on China
 The potential gains from further economic reforms
 are highlighted by the achievements produced by
 reform during the last several years, when Beijing
 began relaxing central controls: Chinese gross nation-
 al product increased at over a 9-percent annual rate
 from 1980 to 1985; total trade nearly doubled, so that
 Chinese exports-at $31 billion last year-are now
 the second largest among LDCs (see figure 1). Real
 incomes have increased by 50 percent, and Beijing's
 "open-door" policy has attracted nearly $5 billion in
 foreign investment-more than in Thailand, the Phil-
 ippines, and Indonesia combined
 One important effect of a more market-oriented
 system would be to significantly expand Chinese
 foreign trade. Although China's merchandise exports
 now amount to 7 percent of GNP, our statistical
 analysis suggests that China is severely undertrading.
 This is demonstrated by the surge in imports and
 exports that occurred as trade constraints were loos-
 ened in recent years. We believe a "normal" export
 share may be on the order of 14 percent, nearly
 double the current share (see appendix, "Estimating
 China's Trade Potential"). In such a case, with a 7-
 percent average growth in the economy, itself a
 consequence of the economic reforms, Chinese exports
 could expand nearly six times, to over $175 billion by
 the turn of the century. Such an increase would boost
 Z China, for example, uses approximately twice as much energy and

 China: The Ingredients of Successful Reform
 Price reform           Allow prices and wages to be set in a free market.
 Progress has been made for over quota production,
 but the program needs to be expanded and extended
 to urban areas.
 Enterprise reform      Allow basic business decisions to be made by manag-
 ers. Under this reform, the economic influence of
 local Communist Party officials and government
 ministries would be significantly curtailed. Reforms
 would progress far enough to allow market forces to
 discipline managers who make poor choices.
 Labor reform          Expand the right of managers to hire and fire
 workers, as well as to reward superior skills and
 performance by increasing wages.
 Policy reform         Establish economic policy controls. Requires tax and
 banking reform and a freely convertible currency.
 Foreign trade reform  Further decentralization of trade decision making,
 including allowing enterprises to import and export
 without state approval.
 Infrastructure improve- Expand road, railway, port, and energy networks.

 More efficient use of resources and higher product
 quality. Increase the availability of raw materials for
 industrial use. Of all the reforms, this is the most
 crucial.
 This is key to allowing firms to adjust to changes in
 prices and wages. Would make managers more re-
 sponsible for their business decisions.
 Would reduce waste and inefficiency by giving man-
 agers control over their most important factor of
 production. Also would improve the absorption of
 excess labor created by increasingly efficient agricul-
 tural production.
 Important to the reform program because it allows
 Beijing's economic technocrats to maintain economic
 stability while implementing the reforms. Establish-
 ing a convertible currency would be a major step
 toward eliminating foreign investors' concerns re-
 garding profit repatriation.
 Crucial to China's meeting its trade potential. Would
 direct resources to their most efficient international
 use.
 Although price and enterprise reforms will go a long
 way in alleviating transportation shortages by im-
 proving the efficiency of the system, Beijing must
 take an active role in easing the movement of goods.

 Successful Reform in China: How Likely Is It?
 Given the magnitude of the task, Beijing's implemen-
 tation of the reform program is not likely to go
 smoothly. Indeed, the reform process will probably be
 "stop and go--reforms followed by a period of
 government-induced retrenchment. This judgment is
 largely based on the emergence of problems such as
 inflation, ballooning trade deficits, growing price
 gouging, and fraud by low-level Communist Party
 officials already associated with the rapid implemen-
 tation of major economic reforms. These problems
 arose full force in 1985, forcing Chinese leaders to
 call for a period of consolidation and adjustment in
 the reform program.
 Beyond this problem is the crucial question of politi-
 cal succession. It remains unclear whether reform-
 minded officials will be placed throughout the politi-
 cal structure to ensure the continuity of reform.
 Although a broadening of the coalition supporting
 reform is beginning-including farmers and more
 prosperous rural industrial workers, who earn three
 times as much as farmers-reformers are under
 pressure from political opponents to show better
 results from their policies. When the extent of last
 year's financial and pricing problems became evident,
 tensions within the leadership rose quickly-with
 conservatives attacking Deng Xiaoping and his sup-
 porters for excessively decentralizing economic
 decision making and weakening the role of central
 planning. Discontent with the reform program has
 also surfaced in the form of protests by university
 students and popular grumblings about rising food
 prices.
 Even with a broadly based, proreform regime,
 China's fragile economic infrastructure could slow
 the progress of reform. For one thing, energy supplies
 in China are short, despite the sharp increases in
 production of coal, oil, and electricity last year.
 Moreover, additions to the transportation network
 have not kept pace with the growth in industrial
 output, and the system remains seriously overbur-
 dened. According to the Chinese press, factories must
 often suspend production because of shortages of
 electricity and delayed shipments of raw materials.
 Still, economic reform will play a key role in China's
 future. Beijing has learned that there is a high price
 to be paid for having a bureaucratic, command
 economy, and China's leaders want to avoid repeating
 the last 30 years. Not wanting to fall further behind
 the West, they realize that their national self-interest
 depends on modernizing and obtaining Western tech-
 nology, and we believe they are pragmatic enough to
 take the necessary steps.

 share of the world market but larger than the United
 Kingdom's and France's.' A different analytical ap-
 proach-based on a study of Chinese resources-
 suggests that the potential export share may be even
 higher. In any case, although imports may lag slightly
 behind exports, they also have the potential to in-
 crease sharply.
 The Chinese superiority in unskilled labor and natural
 resources indicates that Beijing would have-a compar-
 ative advantage-the ability to produce a product
 more efficiently and at less cost than other coun-
 tries-in exporting primary commodities such as
 crude oil, vegetables, soybeans, and cotton, and light
 manufactures such as textiles, clothing, and footwear.
 Beijing is already moving aggressively to triple coal
 exports to 30 million tons annually-half of Austra-
 lia's current coal exports-by 1990, and fast-growing
 Chinese exports will continue to include products such
 as consumer electronics, toys, and low-end-of-the-
 scale transport equipment, primarily ships.
 At the same time, this development pattern would
 require that China import capital-intensive and high-
 technology products, such as high-strength and
 corrosion-resistant steels, electronics, aerospace
 equipment, and manufacturing machinery. Steel
 products-including sheet, bar, and pipe-would
 probably remain a leading Chinese import. In addi-
 tion, China's lack of financial capital as well as the
 need to finance expensive infrastructure such as
 roads, electrical plants, dams, and communication
 facilities suggests that China would require large
 amounts of international financing-both in the form
 of loans and direct investment.4
 Winners and Losers in East Asia
 The size of China's economy and its massive resources
 mean that successful reform would have far-reaching
 consequences for the rest of the world and particularly
 for the countries of East Asia, with which China now
 conducts nearly two-thirds of its trade. A larger
 Chinese economic role in the region would present its
 East Asian partners with both threats and opportuni-
 ties, primarily in terms of export competition and
 expanded import markets in China.
 Meeting Chinese Import Demand. We believe that
 Japan and the Asian NICs are well suited to meet
 growing Chinese demand for Western capital goods
 and high-technology products. Japan, South Korea,
 Singapore, and Hong Kong together have a 25-
 percent share of the world market in these products
 and a 58-percent share of the market for China's top
 20 imports. Tokyo is already the largest exporter to

 would be necessary because China will probably be unable to
 generate enough savings internally to meet growing investment
 requirements. Such a circumstance would be reflected on the trade

 Exports. The main thrust of China's export drive will
 continue to come from the manufacturing sector.
 Since 1979 exports of manufactures have grown at
 nearly twice the rate of agricultural and extractive
 commodities, rising 16 percent per year in current
 dollar value and more than 20 percent per year in
 real terms. China's exports of manufactures are
 spread over a range of light industrial products-a
 wider range than any other developing country.
 China's potential appears greatest in labor-intensive
 areas such as textiles and clothing, metal products,
 hand tools, light machinery and transport equipment
 (shipped primarily to LDCs), handicrafts, footwear,
 glassware, crude chemicals, radios, and military
 equipment. As with many other developing nations,
 textiles and clothing are playing an important role,
 accounting for about one-fourth of China's total
 exports. China has had more success than any other
 LDC, however, in breaking into highly protected
 Western markets for these products.
 Although agricultural exports will grow more slowly
 than manufactures, there are some crops for which
 dramatic increases are possible-corn, cotton, soy-
 beans, and peanuts-if China shifts crop patterns to
 maximize the dollar value of the yields. For example,
 based on China's present yields and world prices, by
 shifting less than a hectare of land from wheat to
 cotton production, China could earn enough foreign
 exchange from exporting cotton to import roughly
 one hectare worth of wheat. Beijing intends to estab-
 lish a series of export bases in coastal areas for
 growing these crops and probably will prove to be
 strongly competitive in selling them in the Asian
 market.
 Imports. Capital goods and industrial supplies-the
 fastest growing imports-will continue to account for
 the largest chunk of China's import budget. Demand
 for industrial supplies-such as steel, zinc, copper,
 fertilizers, and insecticides-will increase at a faster
 pace than the domestic economy can supply them.
 Our analysis shows that every ]-percent increase in
 industrial output results in a 1.1- to 1.3 percent rise
 in imports for the industrial sector. If industrial
 output rises 7 percent per year, imports of industrial
 supplies would grow at 8 to 9 percent per year.
 Capital goods-which have always been the most
 variable component of China's total imports, falling
 in the early years of a five-year plan and rising
 sharply at the end-will probably increase dramati-
 cally in the next decade. In 1985, imports of capital
 goods-such as trucks, railway equipment, and road-
 building equipment-skyrocketed to more than $17  25X1
 billion, as Chinese enterprises rushed to complete
 projects scheduled under the last five-year plan and
 began gearing up for production in the next.
 Growing Chinese purchases of consumer durables-
 such as televisions, motorcycles, and watches, from
 virtually a zero share of the world market-suggest a
 huge repressed demand for these products. As such,
 market-oriented trade reforms would lead to a rapid
 expansion in imports of such goods, which Beijing
 almost certainly will attempt to discourage. F25X1
 Foodstuffs will probably remain a small share of
 imports in the future. Agricultural reforms have been
 so successful in boosting output that many of China's
 recent policies have centered on controlling rather
 than increasing production in order to reduce sur-
 pluses and storage costs and wastes.

 China of these products, which include such items as
 steel, trucks, televisions, and plastics.
 For the NICs to benefit fully from China's growing
 demand for imports, they will have to continue re-
 structuring their economies toward more capital in-
 tensive production. In our view, China's presence in
 world markets will push the NICs further in this
 direction as traditional labor-intensive industries such
 as textiles-still an important source of export reve-
 nue for the NICs-face growing competition from
 China while new capital-intensive industries profit
 from sales to China.
 The history of the NICs suggests that they will allow,
 and even promote, the adjustment of their economies
 to this new world trading system. The process is
 already well under way in South Korea and Singa-
 pore. Electronics firms in Singapore, for example,
 have undergone considerable structural change over
 the past several years with the result that most local
 electronics producers have stopped producing black
 and white televisions. They are now concentrating on
 sophisticated testing and servicing of electronics prod-
 ucts as well as beginning the delicate process of
 fabricating silicon wafers. The government has en-
 couraged this restructuring toward higher, value-
 added production with a variety of policies including
 tax incentives and directing university students into
 scientific and engineering courses. A continuation of
 these trends would measurably enhance NIC export
 possibilities to the mainland.
 Competition From Chinese Exports .... Rapid
 growth of light manufactured exports and, to a lesser
 extent, primary commodities from China would cut
 into other countries' export markets-in the United
 States, Western Europe, and Japan-and increase
 competition for the domestic market in most East
 Asian nations. If China were to reach its export
 potential, overseas sales would increase by nearly
 $150 billion by the turn of the century-a level that
 would exceed the combined current exports of Indone-
 sia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia,
 New Zealand, and South Korea

 analysis, these include the Philippines, Thailand, In-
 donesia, and Malaysia in manufactured and commod-
 ity exports and Australia and New Zealand in com-
 modities. On average, 60 percent of these countries'
 export earnings are accounted for by China's top 20
 export products. China's oil exports, for example,
 have already eroded Indonesia's market in Japan and
 Singapore. A reduction in export growth in these
 countries almost certainly would slow economic
 growth (see figure 2). According to our analysis,
 exports have a significant impact on economic growth
 in all of these countries except for New Zealand, and
 an export decline would have the most pronounced
 effect in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. For
 example, a 10-percent decline in exports from Thai-
 land would lower that country's GDP by over 5
 percent.
 In addition, a large increase in Chinese exports would
 reduce the prices of those products on world markets,
 leading to a deterioration in the terms of trade for the
 developing countries and for Australia and New
 Zealand-reducing the value of exports and contrib-
 uting to slower economic growth. This trend would be

 type of products China will export. According to our

 particularly painful for primary commodity exporters,
 especially Indonesia and the Philippines, whose longer
 term market outlook is already poor because economic
 growth in the United States, the EC, and Japan is no
 longer accompanied by commensurate increases in the
 consumption of basic materials, according to interna-
 . tional economic analysts.
 Our analysis also suggests that bilateral trade bal-
 ances between China and its regional neighbors will
 differ widely-a factor that would undoubtedly help
 determine the political responses in many countries to
 growing Chinese trade. Exports of light manufactures
 to New Zealand and Australia, with few imports from
 those countries, suggest that Beijing will show trade
 surpluses with Wellington and Canberra. On the
 other hand, because China's import of capital goods
 would be largely met by Japan and the NICs, and
 because their relatively small domestic markets will
 not purchase commensurate amounts of Chinese ex-
 ports, Beijing would probably show trade deficits with
 the other dynamic East Asian economies.
 ... And China's Thirst for Capital. We believe that
 Japan-with its large current account surpluses and
 growing interest in investing abroad-is particularly
 well positioned to meet growing Chinese demand for
 financial capital. Although Japanese firms have been
 cautious about investing in China, we believe major
 foreign investment reforms by Beijing would spur
 Japanese investment. Many of these investments
 would probably take the form of joint ventures, which
 are already an important source of financing for
 Beijing. Overall, 2,300 joint ventures had been ap-
 proved by the end of 1985, drawing into China some
 $4 billion in direct foreign investment, according to
 Chinese Government statistics.
 The large movement of capital into China would
 create business opportunities for commercial and in-
 vestment banks, as well as for securities houses.
 Again, Japan-as well as more traditional banking
 centers in Hong Kong and Singapore-would proba-
 bly garner a good share of the business. For example,
 China already has allowed foreign banks to begin
 operating in special economic zones, where banks are
 permitted to draw deposits from and extend loans to
 overseas customers, as well as service joint ventures in
 China. Twenty-five percent of these foreign banks are
 Japanese, and the continuing deregulation of Japan's
 financial markets will go far in making Japanese
 financial institutions competitive with those in Hong
 Kong, Singapore, and New York for Chinese busi-
 ness.
 We also believe that, as a result of successful reform,
 China would increasingly look to acquire funds over-
 seas both by borrowing from commercial banks and
 by floating bond issues in Western capital markets-
 something it has already done successfully in Japan,
 West Germany, and Hong Kong.
 China poten-
 tially could borrow more than $25 billion over the
 next five years, and we calculate that if Beijing
 reaches its trade potential and allows its debt service
 ratio-the ratio of interest and principal payments to
 exports-to expand to even a modest 15 percent
 Fchina's
 total debt could expand to nearly $80 billion by the
 year 2000. The size of China's exports in this case
 suggests to us that Beijing would have little difficulty
 servicing its debt.
 In our judgment, much of this borrowing would come
 at the expense of developing countries in Southeast
 Asia, which will continue to require overseas funds to
 finance development. For one thing, competition for
 available funds would squeeze out marginal invest-
 ment projects in the Philippines, Thailand, and Indo-
 nesia. Competition for funds is already heating up as
 Japanese investment in the developing countries stag-
 nates while Japanese firms commit themselves to
 investment projects in China, as well as the United
 States and Western Europe. Jakarta, for example, has
 seen Japanese investment decline for two consecutive
 years. In addition, the World Bank-which made
 commitments worth $3 billion to China from 1981-
 85-and the Asian Development Bank would proba-
 bly provide Beijing large amounts of funds to finance
 infrastructure projects. This would directly reduce the
 amount of money available for other developing coun-
 tries. Moreover, continued low debt service ratios
 imply that Beijing will maintain good credit ratings
 well into the 1990s, while the Philippines-and possi-
 bly Indonesia-struggles with poor ratings and thus
 higher interest rates.

 Chinese Trade: Impact on the Rest of the World
 Although the economic impact would be less than in
 East Asia, the rest of the world would be affected in a
 similar manner by successful reform in China. In-
 deed, many developed countries particularly those
 in Western Europe-would increase sales to China
 while developing countries watched Chinese exports
 cut into their markets in the developed countries.
 Western Europe's share of the Chinese market is far
 below its share of the world market for the same
 commodities that China imports-suggesting that
 there is considerable. room for expansion. Only the
 largest European firms have put much effort into
 exploiting the Chinese market. Similarly, the non-
 Asian NICs should also do fairly well. By 1990, for
 example, China probably will be a leading purchaser
 of several of Brazil's exports, including plastics, pig
 iron, and fertilizers. Brasilia and Beijing have al-
 ready agreed to technological exchanges in a variety
 of fields, including nuclear power development.
 Meanwhile, economic growth of developing countries
 outside East Asia will be constrained by the rapid
 gains in Chinese exports. For many countries-in-
 cluding some of the poorest in Africa and Latin
 America-the export lines that China would be
 targeting for fastest growth account for a significant
 share of export earnings. On average, China's 40
 fastest growing exports account for an estimated 40
 percent of non-oil-exporting LDCs'foreign exchange
 earnings. They account for nearly 70 percent of the
 exports of South Asia, a region likely to be seriously
 hurt by China's trade expansion.
 Reaction in East Asia
 The overall economic effect of a much larger Chinese
 role in the world economy would be to hold down the
 growth of real wages and provide a boost to corporate
 profits in China's trading partners. This would reflect
 the large size and low wages of China's labor force-
 at 20 cents per hour, China's average wage is the
 lowest in East Asia and one of the lowest in the
 world-which would translate into low prices for
 China's labor-intensive exports and force competitors
 throughout the region to try to hold down their labor
 costs.' Beijing's large imports of capital-intensive
 goods would conversely increase the profitability of
 firms abroad involved in their production and export
 to China.
 In our view, successful economic reform in China thus
 will lead to a redistribution of income within countries
 in East Asia as real wages stagnate while capital
 profitability increases. This will be particularly pain-
 ful for the labor-abundant developing countries, in-
 cluding underemployment-ridden Indonesia and the
 Philippines where labor force growth rates of nearly 3
 percent per year are the fastest in the region. In
 addition, income would also be redistributed to Japan
 and the NICs from the developing countries and
 Australia and New Zealand because these countries
 will face the brunt of Chinese export competition
 while providing little in the way of Chinese imports.
 Looking Inward. If recent policymaking in the region
 is any guide, we believe that the political leadership of
 these countries may respond to the challenge by
 raising stiff barriers to imports in an attempt to
 insulate workers and industries from low-priced, low-
 wage Chinese products.' Although protectionist poli-
 cies-such as tariffs and quotas-will protect domes-
 tic industries and employment in the short run, they
 will do nothing to preserve export markets as overseas
 purchasers simply switch to Chinese products. On the
 contrary, protectionist policies may even damage ex-
 port competitiveness, as local firms are forced to pay
 higher prices for imported capital goods and raw
 materials.'
 ' China has more workers than all the OECD and CEMA countries
 combined. In just the next five-year plan, China must absorb 100
 million new entrants into the labor force-an amount equal to the
 present size of the US labor force. Such trends suggest that real
 wages in China will remain very low.

 also be facing other economic problems, such as growing protec-
 tionism in the West, debt service requirements, and adverse

 Would supply high-technology products and financial

 Economically well positioned to sell to the Chinese

 As the most advanced developing country in East
 Asia, Malaysia could be marginal supplier to the

 goods, and agriculture, could face tough competition
 at home.
 Traditional industries, such as textiles and shoes,
 would be hit hard by Chinese export competition, but
 Seoul will allow the economy to adjust.
 Traditional industries would suffer, but Singapore is
 further on the road to high-technology production
 than the other NICs. Tourism industry-which
 earned $2 billion in 1985-may lose to the Chinese.
 Would face increased competition in export markets,
 particularly textiles, toys, and sporting goods.
 China would be a tough competitor for many of
 Taiwan's exports, including textiles, shoes, and toys.
 Exports-particularly coal and iron ore-would be
 hit hard; Australia's top 10 exports are all primary
 commodities. Could also lose resource investment
 dollars to China.
 Primary commodity exports-particularly meat-
 would be constained by Chinese exports.
 Exports are vulnerable to overseas Chinese sales.
 Manila's markets for coconut oil would be adversely
 affected by Chinese soybean exports.
 Would face tough competition in third markets for
 primary commodities. Jakarta has little alternative
 since extractives are the only products in which
 Indonesia can compete.
 Export markets for textiles and vegetables would be
 vulnerable. As with all developing countries, Bang-
 kok could lose foreign investments and commercial
 bank financing to China.
 Least vulnerable of the developing countries because
 of the growing diversity of exports. Nevertheless,

 count for the bulk of exports and would be vulnerable
 to Chinese competition.

 Turning their economies further inward would ex-
 clude these countries from the additional economic
 growth that Chinese imports of capital goods would
 generate in Japan and the NICs because developing
 country competitiveness in those markets would slip
 further as protectionism rises. In addition, difficulty
 in obtaining overseas financing would worsen the
 balance-of-payments positions of the Southeast Asian
 developing countries and constrain economic growth
 by limiting the amount of capital equipment that they
 could import. Such developments would also force
 these countries into politically unpopular economic
 policy moves, such as devaluing their currencies or
 trimming government spending. Under these condi-
 tions, per capita incomes would probably continue to
 stagnate, and these economies would slide further
 behind in the regional economic race. The possibility
 that such a circumstance would lead to political
 turbulence that could threaten the stability of govern-
 ments in those countries would be a matter of persis-
 resentment of local ethnic Chinese with ties to once-
 dangerous local Communist insurgencies, and a re-
 sulting fear in the capitals of both that their own
 Chinese populations have Beijing's interests at heart.
 Growing economic ties between ethnic Chinese popu-
 lations in these countries and mainland Chinese would
 be viewed as especially threatening.
 Implications for the United States
 Economic Opportunities and Constraints. Chinese
 economic expansion would create opportunities for
 US firms to boost their business with China, as well as
 to establish joint ventures in China. Prospects for US
 sales are good in knowledge-intensive and high-tech-
 nology products such as coal-mining and oil-
 extraction equipment, hydroelectric plants, locomo-
 tives, aircraft, and computers. In addition, Beijing's
 interest in raising capital by selling bonds would open
 a large new market to US securities firms and banks.
 tent concern throughout the 1990s.
 Security Concerns. A growing Chinese economic role
 in the world economy would almost certainly be
 accompanied by a greater Chinese political role in the
 region. For one thing, China's increased share of trade
 would give it a greater voice in international organiza-
 tions such as the IMF and the Asian Development
 Bank. Most important, in our view, China would
 simply have a greater stake in the region as its
 economy becomes more dependent on economic and
 political developments there. A more politically asser-
 tive China is thus a likely consequence of successful
 economic reform in the region.
 Growth in China's economic and political influence,
 we believe, would probably cause serious strains in
 some Southeast Asian countries. Several countries are
 highly suspicious of China's long-term aims and
 would view the growing Chinese presence as a severe
 threat to their security. Vietnam-which has had
 continuing border confrontations with the Chinese for
 several years-will undoubtedly feel increasingly
 threatened by a successfully reforming China. Bei-
 jing's progress would be in sharp contrast to Hanoi's
 probable continued economic stagnation. Indonesia
 and Malaysia are particularly concerned about Chi-
 nese intentions-largely because of their deep-seated
 Indeed, prospects for US sales to China are probably
 better than past trends indicate. US exports have been
 held in check since 1980 by a number of factors,
 including the appreciation of the dollar and declining
 Chinese demand for grain. In 1980, with the dollar at
 a low, the United States occupied 20 percent of the
 Chinese import market, a figure that fell to 11 percent
 in 1984 when the dollar reached its peak. If the dollar
 stabilizes at current levels, we estimate that the US
 share of the Chinese import market could rise to 15
 percent. Indeed, the United States currently has a 15-
 percent share of the world market for the commodities
 that China is buying. Still, US firms will face tough
 competition from Japan and the Asian NICs in the
 Chinese market, particularly for sales of heavy manu-
 factures.
 China will almost certainly work to increase its
 relatively small share of the US market. Such a
 development would damage some US industries-
 such as textiles, clothing, and processed foodstuffs-
 and thus could be a source of friction in relations
 between Washington and Beijing. The Chinese are
 just beginning to mount a significant sales effort in
 the United States-the world's largest and fastest
 growing market for China's fastest growing exports.

 China would be aided immensely if Beijing joins the
 GATT and becomes eligible for US Generalized
 System of Preferences tariff treatment-which could
 cover as much as 60 percent of China's exports.
 Should Washington move to restrict imports in gener-
 al, friction with Beijing could rise because quantita-
 tive import restraints tend to favor more established
 suppliers over newcomers to the market.
 Foreign Policy Gains and Risks. The main benefits to
 Washington of successful reform in China would
 probably come in the strategic area. For one thing, a
 China that sees its future dependent on the West will
 be less likely to lean toward the Soviets. In addition,
 China's increasing desire for markets, technology, and
 industrial supplies probably will make China less
 contentious regionally, with Beijing working to avoid
 regional trouble such as its border disputes with India
 and Vietnam. In addition, rapid, reform-induced eco-
 nomic growth in China will give a strong signal to
 other developing countries that a more open and
 market-oriented economy might work for them also.
 The developing countries, for example, would almost
 certainly request additional aid and preferential trade
 to ease the economic pain associated with successful
 reform in China. They would also look to Washington
 to provide a political and security buffer to the
 Chinese. In this regard, these countries are likely to
 show increased support for and interest in maintain-
 ing the US military presence at Clark Airfield and
 Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines.
 East Asian concerns about the Chinese could, in any
 case, put the United States in a position where it has
 to make tradeoffs between relations with most of East
 Asia and with China. With stagnant or declining
 world trade-the predominant view of most trade
 analysts-China's expansion in the US market can
 only come at the expense of other countries' exports, a
 development that would raise the level of frustration
 in regional capitals, particularly if Washington is
 unable to offset the damage done by an export-
 aggressive China.

 25X1
 25X1
 Still, we believe that successful reform in China could
 create foreign policy opportunities for Moscow in the
 region. Although Indonesia, for example, will almost
 certainly look first to Washington, we cannot rule out
 the possibility that Jakarta's concern over the Chinese
 would encourage closer relations with the Soviets or
 even with radical Islamic states in the Middle East.
 Although in time Vietnam's concerns about China
 could lead to a rapprochement between Hanoi and
 Beijing, the short-term result, we believe, would be to
 force Vietnam further into the Soviet camp. Some
 political observers even suggest that, as China extends
 its reach in East Asia, Tokyo and Moscow may find it
 advantageous to strengthen bilateral relations in order
 to offset Chinese influence in the region, although we
 believe that Tokyo's first move would be to pursue
 even closer relations with Washington.
 In addition, the United States would face increasing
 pressures from the losers of reform in China-Austra-
 lia, New Zealand, and the Southeast Asian develop-
 ing countries-to "make up" for their China losses.

 Estimating Chinese
 Trade Potential
 We used two methods to estimate China's trade
 potential. The first is based on an econometric analy-
 sis of export-to-GNP ratios for 44 countries. This
 analysis argues that a number of factors determine
 what share of a country's output is likely to be traded,
 including the size of the domestic market, per capita
 income, the domestic availability of resources, the
 accessibility of the country to international shippin&
 lanes, population density, and the nature of the
 economic system. By comparing these factors across
 countries, we estimate that China could be exporting
 twice as much-$60 billion-as it currently does.
 Such a figure is 14 percent of China's current output,
 and it would put China's trade on a par with that of
 Italy and the Netherlands.
 The second method-which indicates that China
 could export even more of its GNP-is based on an
 economic theory that argues that a country's trade
 potential depends on the composition of its domestic
 resources. In general, the more of a resource that a
 country has relative to other resources-such as labor
 or capital-the more competitive it will be in produc-
 ing products that use that resource most intensively.
 The resulting comparative advantage in products that
 use such abundant resources enables a country to use
 overseas earnings from these goods to purchase prod-
 ucts it cannot produce competitively, namely products
 that use its relatively scarce resources. Our analysis of
 Chinese resources-which indicates a very high ratio
 of unskilled labor and natural resources to skilled
 labor-suggests that China has the potential to export
 as much as 20 percent of its GNP. China's relative
 resource endowment appears to fall between those of
 the developing countries in Southeast Asia and those
 of the Asian NICs and thus a more market-oriented
 economy should result in China's export/GNP share
 rising and settling between the export shares of these
 countries (see figure 3).

 unit of imports. Large Chinese exports of primary
 commodities and light manufactures will reduce the
 prices of these products on world markets. Similarly,
 large Chinese imports would drive up the prices of
 capital-intensive goods and high-technology products.
 The result would be a deterioration in China's terms
 of trade-the ratio of a country's export prices to its
 import prices-and a slowdown in growth. As such,
 the benefits of an extensive expansion in trade will
 become less clear to Beijing. The extent to which this
 would restrict China's desire to trade, we believe,
 would reflect the degree of the terms-of-trade decline
 and how much economic growth slows, both of which
 depend on many factors-including the future size of
 the world market for the products China trades and
 the structure of China's domestic economy.
 The wild card in these analyses is China's terms of
 trade. As China expands trade it will have to give up
 more and more exports in order to get each additional
