				Introduction
				It  is  hardly  possible  to  find  a  more  urgent  and  burning  problem  in  modern
			 	international  life  than  halting  the  arms  race  which  has  swept  over  the
				world.    	The  competition  in  t:~e  production  of  destructive  systems  not  only		.
				devours  enormous  material  resources  but  also  gives  birth  to  a  real  threat
				to  the  future  of  civilization.    	The  weapons  which  have  now  been  created
				are  sufficient  to  destroy  everything  living  on  our  planet.    	The  history  of
				ma.nkind  has  never  known  sucn  a  situation,.    	Under  these  conditions~   	workable
				measures  axe  urgently  needed  for  the  elimina.tion  of  the  threat  hanging  over
				the  world  and  for  practical  disarmament.
				Throughout  the  more  than  60  yeaxs  of  its  existence,   	the  Soviet  state  has
				always  attached  primary  importance  to  the  solution  of  this  task.    	The
				~;truggle  for  disarmament  is  the  fundamental  line  of  Soviet  foreign  policy.
				It  has  received  cleax-cut  strengthening  in  the  new  Constitution  of  the
				USSR.    	Article  28  of  our  country's  fundamental  law  says  that  the  foreign
				po.licy  of  the  USSR  is  directed  "toward  the  achievement  of  general  and
				complete  disarmament."    	The  presence  of  this  statement  in  the  Soviet  cons-
				~Eitution  has  been  ~'illed  with  a  deep  social  meaning.    	It  conveys  the  fact
				that  in  a  socialist  society  thers  axe  no  and  cannot  be  any  social  forces
	 	=	    	wnich  axe  interested  in  accumulating  systems  for  waging  wax  and  which
	 	,	    	e.xtract  any  profit  from  this.    	The  basic  difference  between  the  Soviet
				state  and  the  imperialist  countxies,   	where  aggressive  circles  which  axe
				interested  in  spreading  the  arms  race  exist  and  actively  operaia,   	lies  in
				thj.s.    	These  circles  have  drawn  the  world  into  a  very  dangarous  arms
		     	production  competition  which  is  poisoning  the  international  climate.    	Curbing
		     	+hese  adventurists  forces  is  now  a  vitally  importa.nt  task.

	     	-		     	Champions  of  disarmament  ,.~e  coming  forward  to  achieve  this  vital  goal.    	In
				    	their  ranks  are  the  Soviet  state,   	the  mighty  socialist  commonwealth,   	and
				   	millions  of  people  of  good  will  on  a11  continents.    	As  a  result  o.f  their
				    	persistent  efforts,   	they  have  achieved  during  recent  years  a  definite  chaxige
				    	for  the  better  in  international  relations,   	and  the  process  of  relaxing
				    	tensions  has  been  developed  in  apite  of  the  complications  caused  by  the
				    	policy  of  the  more  die-hard  imperiallst  circles.    	In  order  to  make  thls
				   	process  irreversible,   	it  is  necessary  to  add  political  relaxation  to
				   	military  relaxation.    	The  first  steps  have  already  been  taken  on  this  path,
	    	-		     	A  number  of  international  agreements  which  have  blocked  up  severa.7_  cl~annels		   	-
				   	of  the  a.rms  race  have  been  worked  out  and  are  in  effect,   	constant  work  is
				   	being  performed  to  prepare  new  measures  in  this  area,   	and  orga,nizatior,al
				   	measures  for  examining  disarmament  questions  are  being  improveci.
				   	However~   	it  is  necessary  to  recognize  that  the  arms  race  has  stil"1  not  less-
				   	ened.    	It  is  necessary  to  salve  the  basic  complex  of  problems  which  axe
				   	connected  with  implementing  a  fundamental  change  from  building  up  arms  to
				   	their  curtailment.    	This  assumes  the  working  out  and  signing  of  a  serios  of
				   	more  sweeping  international  treaties  in  the  area  of  disarmamen~o    	Netr  Soviet
				   	initiatives,which  provide  for  a  complete  halt  in  the  further  qua 1 itative    	�		   	-
				   	and  quantitative  weapons  groYrth  in  states  possessing  large  mil~.taxy  potent-
				   	ial ~   	are  directed  to~ra.rd  ~~his  goa.l.
				   	The  disarmament  problem  has  become  not  only  a  political  but also  an  intexna-
				   	tional  legal  one.    	Since  it  is  the  subject  of  a  number  of  impo.rtant  inter-
				   	national  treaties,   	this  problem  has  a~  the  same  time  entered  inta  the  sphere
				   	of  operations  of  modern  international  law.    	One  of  the  significant  sotu ces		     	-
				   	of  the  development,   	which  is  now  taking  place  in  the  area  of  the  si:ruggle
				   	for  disarmament,   	is  here.
				  	During  recent  yeass,   	the  amount  of  legal  research  in  this  axea  has  grown
	    	-		    	significantly  throughout  the  world.    	This  has  been  especially  noticeable
				   	against  the  background  of  the  formerly  rather  passive  position  which  ch~sac--
				  	terized  the  approach  of  Western  international  law  doctrine  to  this  problem.

			     	results  in  the  form  of  a  number  of  Soviet-American  agreements  on  limiting
			     	offensive  and  defensive  strategic  arms.
			     	In  general,   	it  is  not  difficult  to  see  that  the  past  decade  has  been  chax-
			     	acterized  by  a  marked  stress  on  the  international  regulation  of  questions
			     	which  primarily  concern  the  various  systems  of  mass  destructiori.    	The  pre-
			     	paration  of  treaties  on  the  complete  banni.ng  of  chemical  wea,pons  and  aiso
	    	,			on  banning  the  creation  of  new  types  and  systems  of  weapons  of  mass  des~ruc-
			     	tion  is  now  taking  place.    	This  last  aspect  of  the  disarmament  problem  is
			     	aimed  at  the  future  and  is  very  important  since  it  has  been  called  upon  to
			     	prevent  in  tilne  a  development  which  is  fraught  with  serious  danger  for  the
			     	future  of  mankind.    	In  1978,  one  other  document  of  no  small  importance
			     	which  was  intended  to  close  possible  channels  for  the  use  of  technical  pro-
	     	-			gress  to  harm  man	 	the  convention  on  bar,ning  the  militaxy  or  any  other
			     	hostile  use  of  systems  to  affect  the  environment	 	went  into  effect.    	All
			     	t.his  testifies  that  the  process  of  working  out  international  documents,
			    	aimed  at  limiting  the  arms  race~  has  now  grown  considerably.    	It  embraces
			    	all  the  new  aspects  of  the  problem  which  before  had  not  at  all  axisen  in
			    	international  practices.    	The  use  of  new  methods  for  discussing  the  dis-
	     	-	     	armament  problem  is  also  a  feature  of  no  small  importance.    	The  convening
			    	of  a  SP2C1~  session  of  the  General  Aswembly  on  disarmament  ---the  widest
			    	forum  oi  all  ever  occupied  with  disarmament	 	in  1978  is  significant.
			    	Thus,   	the  disarmament  problem  has  not  only  firmly  entered  international  law
			    	but  is  also  beir~g  actively  developed,   	occupying  an  ever  more  significant
			    	place  within  the  limits  of  this  law.    	The  forecast  that  the  process  of
			    	enveloping  the  disarmament  groblem  with  international  legal  norms  will  bP
			    	steadily  expaaided,   	is  not  too  bold  a  one.    	This  assumes  progressive  enrich-
			    	ment  of  the  content  of  international  or  legal  r~orms  which  touch  upon  dis-
	     	-	     	armament~    	This  is  the  general  tendency  of  international  legal  ~.evPlopments

				   	these  systems:    	bacteriological,   	chemical  and  nuclear.    	Recently,   	basic  work

				   	be  different  and  change  during  different  stages  depending  on  the  specific
				   	situation.
				   	As  an  illustrations   	one  can  cite  the  course  of  the  examination  of  disaxmam-		    	-
	     	,		    	ent  questions  during  recent  decades.    	For  example,   	whereas  the  beginning  of
				   	the  Sixties  the  task  of  preparing  a  treaty  on  general  and  complete  disarm-
				   	ament  was  proposed  as  the  primary  one,   	the  direction  of  the  work  subsequent-
				   	ly  changed  somewhat.    	The  overall  goal  of  achieving  sweeping  disarmament			  	_
				   	preserved  its  fundamental  importance;    	however,   	the  centex  of  ~avity  in
				   	practical  work  shifted  to  the  area  of  partial  disarmament.    	The  preparation
				   	of  various  urgent	 	b~~t  more  limited  in  con~snt--measures  became  the  main
				   	and  predominant  one.
				   	These  measures  primaxily  relate  to  modern  systems  of  mass  destructions
	    	-		    	bacteriological,   	chemical  and  nuclear  weapons.    	The  workin  this  direction
				   	has  already  brought  appreciabl.e  results.    	The  convention  on  the  complete
				   	banning  of  bacteriological  weapons  can  ser.ve  as  an  example.    	At  the  present
				   	time,   	the  preparation  of  documen+..s  on  the  complete  banning  of  chemical
				   	weapons  is  taking  place.    	Steps  oY  no  sma11  importance  are  being  taken  on
				   	a  bilateral  basis  to  limit  strategic  arms  and  to  lessen  the  threat  of  a
				  	nuclear  war  by  concluding  agreements  primaxily  between  the  USSR  and  the
				  	United  States.    	During  recent  years  the  range  of  questions,  on  which  dis-
				  	cussions  are  being  held,   	has  been  noticeably  expanded.    	For  example,   	such
				   	questions  as  the  banning  of  new  systems  of  mass  destruction  which  might  be

					mass  destruction  has  now  definitely  become  the  main  avenue  in  disarmament
			=	     	work~    	This  avenue  has  been  filled  with  intense  practical  work  and  unceasing
					searches  for  new  agreements.
					The  successes  which  have  been  achieved  in  this  area  axe  primarily  conne~ted
					with  the  USSR's  consistent  stxuggle  to  solve  the  fundamental  disarmament
					question s.    	During  recent  yeaxs,   	constructive  Soviet  proposals,   	which  play
					a  dominant  role  in  definin~  the  concrete  paths  leadir.g  to  disarmament,   	were
					put  forth  on  a11  the  enumerated  aspects  of  disarmament.    	These  pertain  to
					question s  on  the  complete  banning  of  chemical  weapons,   	to  problems  of  nuc-
					leax  disarmament,   	and  to   	the  task  of  banning  new  systems  of  mass  destruction.
					The  fact  that  the  60th  anniversary  of  the  Soviet  state  was  celebrated  with
					new  ir,itiatives  in  this  area  is  especia?ly  symbolic.    	It  is  sufficient  to
					cite,   	for  example,   	such  steps  (which  have  been  discussed  in  greater  detail			    	.
		 	-			above)   	as  the  proposals  foz�  a  simultaneous  halt  by  all  states  in  the  pro-
					duction  of  nuclear  weapons.    	These  proposaZs  constitute  an  entire  system  of
					measures  ai~ned  at  advancing  the  cause  of  nucleax  disarmament.
					The  stress  on  nuclear  disarmament  is  thoroughly  justified  f'irst  of  a11  by
					the  faet  that  nuclear  systems  occupy  at  the  present  time  the  main  place  in
					the  arn:s  race  which  has  been  unleashed  by  imperialism.    	They  have  taken  very
					deep  -roo t  in  modern  weapon  systems,   	and  therefore,   	any  effective  disarmam-
					ent  program  cannot,   	naturally,  fail  to  give  one  of  the  main  places  to  them.
					However,   	this  of  course  must  not  exclude  from  view  other  systems  of  mass
					destructicn  which  are  also  related  to  the  ca~egory  of  primaxy  disarmament
					aspects.    	It  is  unnecessarv  to  justify  the  need,   	wrich  was  demonstrated  by
					comparatively  recent  international  events  (such  as  the  war  in  Vietnam),   	for
					the  urgent  and  complete  banning  of  chemical  weapons.    	It  is  equally~  incon-			    	-
					testible  that  the  time  to  seriously  think  about  preventing  the  creation  of
		 	-	     	new  systems  of  mass  destruction~   	which  are  even  more  destructive  than  exist-

					wh::~�  ras  been  said  permits  the  prospects  for  the  development  of  disarmament
					law  to  be  understood.    	There  is.now  every  justification  for  concluding  that			  	_

					  	When  speaking  about  the  caxdinal  directions  in  the  struggle  for  disarmam-
					  	ent,   	it  is  necessaxy  to  talk  about  the  fact  that  now  (as  was  pointed  out
					  	above)   	the  final  goals  of  this  struggle  have  been  defined  ~ufficiently			    	-
					  	clearly  in  an  international  legal  respect.    	This  is  an  aspect  of  the
					  	matter  which  is  of  no.small  importance.    	The  accelerated  movement  to  devel-
		   	~		     	op  specific  disarmament  measures  places  on  the  agenda  the  question  of  +!:is
					  	movement's  prospects.    	Here,   	it  is  appropriate  to  emphasize  that  the  USSR
					  	has  always  devoted  significant  attention  to  the  formulation  of  a  long-term
					  	disarmament  program  having  a  sweeping  nature.    	So~riet  initiatives  in  this
					  	direction  are  universally  known.  We  are  talking,  of  course,   	about~  ~he  Soviet		 	-
					  	proposals  for  abolishing  systems  for  waging  wax.    	They  were  heaxd  in  the
					  	UN  at  the  end  of  the  Fifties  and  somewhat  later  receiveu  detailed  elabora-
					  	tion  in  the  Soviet  drsft  tr~aty  on  general  and  complete  disarmament  which
					  	was  proposed  in  Maxch  1962.
					  	The  draft  was  a  document  of  fundamental  importance  which  reflected  the
					  	Soviet  state's  approach  to  the  disarmament  problem.    	It  emphasized  the			     	_
					  	USSR's  readiness  to  move  to  a  sweeping  sol~ation  of  this  problem  if  other
					  	states  also  expressed  their  agreement  to  this.    	The  Soviet  draft  treaty  on
					  	general  and  complete  disarmament  is  a  step-by-step  plan  for  the  complete
		  	'		     	abolition  of  systen~s  for  waging  wax  over  the  course  of  several  years  under
					  	strict  and  effective  international  control.    	The  exceptional  accuracy  and
					  	concreteness  of  the  approach  to  the  task  of  implementing  complete  disa_~n-
		  	-		     	ament  make  the  Soviet  draft  a  significant  and  viable  international  document.
					  	The  need  for  such  a  sweeping  disarmament  plan  is  indisputable  from  the
					  	point  of  view  of  the  basic  needs  of  the  contemporary  international  situa-
					  	tion.    	Now~   	life  requires  more  tha.n  ever  before  that  a  way  be  found  to  save
					 	mankind  ~om the  terrible  threat,   	which  the  availability  of  an  unprecedented
					  	arsenal  of  destructive  systems  which  states  have  at  their  disposal,   	is
					  	creating.    	This  arsenal  is  being  improved  with  unpara.lled  speed  and  its
					 	further  build-up  is  f'raught  with  an  unprecedented  threat  to  entire  countries
					 	and  peoples.    	From  this  comes  the  necessity  to  find  ways  to  radically
					  	change  the  situa.tion  which  has  been  created.
					 	The  Soviet  draft  treaty  on  general  and  complete  disaxmament  is  oriented  in
		  	-		     	this  direction.    	Of  course,   	it  is  not  necessary  to  approach  in  a  simplified
		  	-		     	fashion  the  opportunity  for  a  quick  implementation  of  this  plan.    	Its
					 	discussion  has  shown  that  Western  states  are  still  not  ready  for  practical
					 	steps  in  the  direction  of  complete  disarmament.    	However,   	the  very  idea  of
					 	the  Soviet  draft  has  exerted  an  indisputable  effect  on  modern  international
					 	relations.    	Essentially,   	i.t  has  begun  to  be  accepted  as  the  final  goal  in
					 	disarmament  work  and  there~y  has  attached  even  greater  purposefulness  to
					 	all  this  work.
					 	This  process  is  also  noticeable  in  the  area  of  international  law.    	The  idea
					 	of  complete  disarmament  has  been  fixed  in  international  treaties  a~  the  end
		  	-		    	result  toward  which  the  disarmament  measures  now  being  developed  axe  direct-

			    	difficult  to  continue  them.    	For  example~   	the  preamble  to  the  treaty  on
			    	banning  the  placement  of  nuclear  weapons  ar:d  other  types  of  weapons  of  mass
			    	destruction  on  the  sea  and  ocean  beds  and  in  its  depths  expresses  the  con-
			    	viction  of  the  part~.es  that  this  treaty  "is  a  step  on  the  path  to  a  treaty
	   	_		 	on  general  an~  com~,lete  disarmament  unr~er  strict  and  effective  internation-
			    	al  control".	 	A  statement  close  to  this  thought  is  contained  in  the				    	_
			    	preamble  to  tY~e  convention  on  banning  the  development~   	production  and  stock-
			    	piling  o.f  bacterioiugical  (biological)   	and  toxic  weapons  and  their  de~truc-
			    	tion;    	the  determination  of  the  participants  in  the  convention  "to  contri-
			    	bute  to  the  achievement  of  a  general  and  complete  disarmament  under  strict
			    	and  effective  international  contxol"5    	is  expressed  in  it.
			    	The  quoted  treaty  statements  cleaxly  con~ey the  thought  that  general  and				 	_
			    	complete  disarmament  is  the  final  goal  towaxd  whose  achievement  th~se  dis-
			    	armament  agreements~   	which  axe  already  in  effect.and  those  being  prepaxed,

	    	-			result  of  the  disarmament  work  now  taking  place  has  received  treaty  rein-			     	~
			    	Forcement  in  modern  international  law.    	This  is  undoubtedly  an  important
	    	_			evolution  which  contributes  to  practical  movement  in  this  direction.
			    	It  is  possible  to  say  that  i.nternational  law  in  this  sta~e  of  its  develop-
			    	mer~t  is  alraady  pointing  out  to  states  the  prospects  for  sweeping  disarmam-
			    	ent.    	Of  course~   	one  cannot  oversimplify  the  proposition  by  mai.ntaining  that
			    	international  legal  norms  already  exist  which  require  states  to  implement
			    	ge7cral  and  complete  disazmament.    	These  norms  still  do  not  exist.    	We
			    	talked  about  this  earlier  in  this  chapter.    	However,   	internaiional  law
			    	clearly  orients  states  towards  the  working  out  of  binding  agreements  on
			    	complete  d3.sarmament.    	The  importance  of  such  propositions  is  rather  great.
			    	They  test3fy  to  the  fact  that  the  concept  of  general  and  complete  disaxmamet
			    	has  received  authoritative  international  legal  confirmation  and  that  it  is
			    	now  being  ac~epted  as  the  a,L~ost  universally  recognized  goal  of  disarmament
			    	work.    	Al1  this,   	of  course,   	has  no  small  significance  for  the  general
			    	orientation  of  the  practical  work  in  this  axea.

					Thus,   	International  legal  developments,  have  already  led  to  a  rather  cleax-
					cut  strengthening  of  the  general  goals  in  the  struggle  for  disarmament.
					During  recent  yeaxs,   	the  or~anizational  forms  for  achieving  these  goals
					have  also  been  systematically  dismissed.    	Speci~l  attention  has  been  att-
					racted  to  the  use  of  more  effective  methods  to  solve  disaxmament  problems.
					We  are  talking  here  primasily  about  a  world  disarmament  aonference,   	that  is~
	  	-		    	about  the  widest  and  most  representative  forum  of  states.    	'~he  idea  of
					calling  such  a  conference  has  already  been  nurtured  for  many  years.    	The
					opportunity  to  itivolve  practical.ly  a11  states  in  the  modern  world  in  the
					examination  of  disa.rma,ment  ~aestions  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  basic
					advantages  in  using  such  a  forum.    	This  method  has  not  been  practiced  in
					the  past  but  in  the  opinion  of  many  states  its  use  can  open  up  new  oppor-
					tunities  for  forward  movement  in  the  cause  of  disarmament.    	The  Soviet
					CJnion  and  other  advocates  of  the  call  for  a  world  disarmament  conference
					are  guided  by  these  motives.    	It  goes  without  saying  that  ~the  convening  of
					such  a  conference  in  no  way  excludes  but  on  the  contrary  assumes  the  con-
					tinued  functioning  of  the  Committee  on  Disarmament  and  the  other  orgarxs
					already  worki.ng  in  this  area.
					The  campaign  in  favor  of  calling  a  world  disarmament  conference  showed
	  	_		    	itself  at  the  beginning  of  the  Sixties.    	The  struggle  to  achieve  this  g~a1
					has  undergone  two  stages  in  its  development.    	The  first stage  pertains   	co
					the  Six ties.
					The  socialist  countries  which  are  invaxiably  trying  to  use  all  possible
	  	~		   	ways  to  abet  the  implementation  of  disarmament,   	came  forward  with  a  ca].1
					to  create  a  world  disarmament  conference.    	The  meeting  of  the  Political			    	-
					Consultative  Committee  of  the  Warsaw  Treaty  membar  nations  which  was  held
					at  the  beginning  of  1965  wrote  in  its  communique:    	"The  Warsaw  Treaty
			     	member  nations  support...   	the  ca11  for  a  world  disarmament  confer.ence."6
			     	The  idea ~r  the  calling  of  such  a  conference  was  also  proposed  in  the				 	_
			     	UN.    	The  Soviet  delegation~   	declaring  that  the  canvening  of  a  world  dis-
			     	armament  conference  with  the  pa~ticipation  of  a11  countries  in  the  world
			     	would  be  responsive  to  the  situa.tion  which  had  taken  shape,   	and  calling
			     	upon  the  Linited  Nations  Organization  to  include  itself  in  the  task  of
			     	preparing  for  such  a  conference,   	offered  a  proposal  on  this  question  during
			     	the  19th  Session  of  the  General  Assembly.
			     	'Ihe  determination�of  a  large  number  of  states  to  achieve  the  convening  of
			     	a  disarmament  conference  was  convi~cingly  demonstrated  during  the  20th
			     	Session  of  the  General  Assembly.    	The  Soviet  delegation  offered  a  concrete
			     	proposals    	to  organize  such  a  conference  in  the  middle  of  1966  in  Geneva
			     	or  some  other  place  accepta,ble  to  a11  pasticipants.    	In  doing  this,   	the
			     	Soviet  Union  particularly  emphasized  the~urgent  necessity  to  attach  a
			     	truly  world  nature  to  the  conference  and  for  this  purpose  to  attract  a11
			     	states  to  participate  in  it,   	including  those  who  axe  not  UN  members  or  who
			     	are  being  artificially  kept  away  from  disarmament  negotiations.    	Considering		   	-
			     	the  need  for  a  universal  nature  for  this  conference,   	the  5oviet  Union
	  	~		    	proceeded  from  the  necessity  to  call  it  outside  the  limits  of  the  UN.

				 	During  the  wor;;  of  the  22d  Session  of  the  General  Assembly  it  turned  out
				 	that  the  overw~ielming  majority  of  UN  mem bers  supported  this  iciea.    	It  is
				 	signiiicant  that  the  draft  resolution  on  calling  a  disarmament  conference
				 	was  presented  in  the  name  of  43  states.												    	-
				 	Or~  29  ~iovember  1965,   	a  plenaxy  session  of  the  General  Assembly  adopted
		  	-	    	Resolution  2030~XX  on  convening  a  world  disarmament  conference;    	112  votes
				 	were  in  faVOr  of  it~   	one  state  abstained,   	and  not  one  voted  against  it.
				 	The  resolution  pointed  at  the  paramount  importance  of  disarmament  for  the
		  	-	    	modern  world  and  also  the  urgent  need  to  exert  further  efforts  aimed  at
				 	achieving  an  agreement  on  general  and  complete  disarmament  with  effective
				 	inter.national  control.    	Havir~g  recommended  the  convening  of  a  world  disarm-

				 	wu.rld  re~a.~^dless  of  inembership  in  the  UN  should  be  invited  to  it.
				 	Th~_is  did  the  struggle  begin  wi~hin  the  UN  to  ca11  a  world  disarmament
				 	cor~ference,    	This  period  can  be  considered  to  be  the  first  stage  of  this

				 	Western  powers  and  the  PRC  which  prevented  the  implementation  of  General
				 	Assembly  F.esolution  2030~XX.
				 	I~ater  the  Soviet  Union  continued  to  consistently  see  to  the  calling  of  a
				 	d~s~smament  conference.    	In  1971,   	it  again  Gupported  the  calling  of  a  world

				The  31st  Session  of  the  General  Assembly  unanimously  adopted  Resolution
				31/189  on  calling  a  special  assembly  session  on  disarmament.    	It  pointed
				out  that  the  "continua,tion  of  the  arms  race  threa`tens  internation~  peace
				and  security  and  also  diverts  enormous  resources  which  axe  extrem  ly  necess-
				axy  for  economic  and  social  development."8    	The  special  session  wals  called
				upon  to  serve  as  an  intermedia:.y  stage  on  the  path  to  the  subsequent  con-
				vening  of  a  wor~.d  conference.    	The  Soviet  Union  and  other  socialist  count-
				ries  continuously  pointed  out  in  the  UN  that  the  session  should  be  regard-
				ed  not  as  a  substitute  for  the  world  conference  but  as  a  measure  preparing
				the  path  for  its  convening.    	In  order  to  carry  out  the  necessary  organiza-
				tional  preparations~   	a  Disartnament  Center  was  created  within  the  UN  Secre-
				tariat  at  the  beginning  of  1g77�
				The  Soviet  Ur_ion  proposed  a  detailed  program  for  conducting  the  special
				assembly  session  devoted  to  disarmament.    	It  was  set  forth  in   	a    	USSR
				Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  letter  to  the  UN  Secretary  General.    	The  letter
				particularly  emphasized  the  need  to  carefully  and  thoroughly  prepare  for			  	-
				the  sessions,   	and  that  its  decisions  should  help  the  disarmament  negotiat-
				ions  already  taking  place.    	Coticerning  the  content  of  the  special  session's
				work,   	the  USSR  expressed  the  opinion  that  the  session's  agenda  should
				"provide  for  a  braod  exchange  of  views  on  the  disa,rmament  problem  both  with
				respect  to  the  basic  approaches  to  this  problem  during  the  present  stage
				and  wi-th  respect  to  the  basic  directions  in  the  primary  efforts  of  states
				in  this  axea,   	having  in  mind  the  achievement  of  the  main  and  final  goal  of
				all  efforts  in  the  area  of  disarmament	 	general  and  complete  disaxmament."9
		     	On  the  threshold  of  the  special  session,   	the  USSR  proposed  a  new  long-range
				initiative  which  provided  for  the  further  spread  of  the  struggle  to  solve
 -		    	a  wide  series  of  disarmament  questions.    	L.  I.  Brezhnev  announced:    	"The
		     	time  has  come  to  think  about  completely  halting  the  further  qualitative  and
 -		    	quantitative  grow~th  of  weapons  and  armed  forces  of  states  possessing  a  large
		     	milltary  potential,   	and  by  this  to  create  conditions  for  their  subsequent
		     	reduction.    	Specifically~   	we  are  addressing  an  appeal  to  discuss  a  program
		     	to  implement  the  following  measures  over  a  definitely  limited  time:    	Stopping
		     	the  production  of  all  types  of  nuclear  weapons;    	stopping  the  production
		     	and  banning  ali  other  types  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction;  haltin~  the
		     	creation  of  new  types  of  conventional  weapons  with  great  destructive  force;
		     	and  the  repudiation  of  enlarging  armies  and  increasin~  the  conventional
		     	weapons  of  the  powers  who  axe  permanent  members  of  the  Security  Council  and
 _		    	the  countries  allied  with  them  by  military  agreements."10
 -		    	The  introduction  of  this  detailed  program  by  the  Soviet  Union  once  again
		     	emphasized  that  there  exist  quite  a  few  specific  areas  to  which  arms  limit-
		     	ation  meas~es  must  be  spread.    	It  goes  without  saying  that  not  a11   	the
		    	enumerated  questions  can  be  quickly  regulatsd.    	However,  all  of  them  can
		    	find  a  satisfactory  solution  within  a  reasonable  time  if  the  good  will  of
		    	states  is  directed  towaxd  this.    	The  importance  of  the  Soviet  initiative
		    	is  especially  great  because  it  cleaxly  points  out  the  possible  deviation  of
		    	practical  work  on  disarmament  for  the  very  near  future.    	Such  a  concrete

		     	T'he  UN  General  Assembly  special  session  on  disarmament  took  place  in  New

		     	tially~   	the  session  was  the  most  representative  forum  which  ever  discussed			     	-
		     	disarmament  questions.    	This  fact  forces  one  to  regaxd  it  as  yet  another
		     	step  of  no  sma11  importance  in  the  task  of  involvingt~e  widest  possible
		     	circle  of  states  in  the  examination  of  disa,rmament  questions.    	The  session
		     	undoubtediy  m2.de  ~  definite  contribution  to  the  solution  of  such  a  very
		     	important  task  as  the  creation  of  the  most  powerful  front  possible  of
		     	peaceloving  forces  who  came  out  in  favor  of  implementing  disaxmament.
		     	The  task  of  working  up  specific  disarmament  measures  did  not  face  the
		     	General  Assembly  special  session.    	It  was  called  upon  to  formulate  the
		     	funda.mental  principles  wh~ch  would  lie  att~e  basis  of  further  practical
		     	work  in  the  axea  of  disarmament,   	and  to  determine  the  main  directions  of
		     	forward  movement  in  this  vitally  important  work.    	The  fact  that  such  a
		     	concreie  de~inition  of  both  the  immediate  and  the  long  range  tasks  in  the
		     	disarmament  area  is  now  an  extremely  timely  matter,   	is  not  subject  to  doubt.
		     	It  will  help  to  unite  and  stimulate  the  efforts  oi  all  states  who  are
		     	interested  in  implementing  disarmament,   	and  to  raise  the  practical  effect-
		     	iveness  of  work  in  this  area.
		    	The  Soviet  Union  presented  a  specific  program  of  practical  measures  designed
		-	    	to  define  the  general  and  cardinal  direction  of   	fl~rther  disarmament  work
		    	dur.ing  the  special  session.    	The  proposal  for  a  complete  halt  to  the  further
		    	qualitative  and  quantitative  growth  in  the  arms  and  armed  forces  of  states					_
		    	possessing  a  laxge  military  potential  was  its  heart.    	The  practical  imple-
		    	mentation  of  this  program  was  worked  out  in  detail  in  Soviet  proposals.ll
		    	This  ini.tiative  played  an  extremely  noticeable  role  in  the  work  of  the
		    	special  session.    	Essentially,   	it  formed  the  skeleton  of  the  final  document
		    	which  was  unanimously  approved  by  the  session.    	On  the  whole,   	decisions
		    	of  the  session  formulated  a  broad  and  useful  program  for  work  in  the  dis-
		    	armament  asea  which  was  adopted  by  the  UN  members  on  the  basis  of  a  consen-
		    	sus.    	Undoubtedly~   	this  program  will  he?p  to  stimulate  a  general  movement
		    	in  the  directi.on  of  delivering  mankind  from  the  arms  race  and  the  dangers
		    	ccr~nected  with  it.																			-
		    	Meanwhile,   	it  is  impossible  not  to  speak  about  the  fact  that  the  special
		    	s~ssion  once  again  exposed  and  confirmed  the  presence  of  forces~   	hostile
		    	to  the  cause  of  disarmament,   	in  the  world.    	These  are  not  only  the  aggress-
		    	ive  imperialist  forces  which  axe  interested  in  speeding  up  military  prepaxa-
		    	tions.    	China,   	which  was  trying  to  force  through  its  not  unknown  Maoist
		    	thesis  that  apparently  only  the  USSR  and  the  United  States  should  disarm
		    	but  a11  other  countries  on  the  other  hand  should  urgently  arm~   	appeared  in

					to  the  cause  of  disarmament.    	It  is  widely  known  that  China  invaxiably
					comes  out  against  the  resolutions  adopted  by  the  regular  sessions  of  the
					General  Assembly  on  disarmament  questions  and  is  not  a  gasticipant  in  one
					of  the  international  arms  limitation  treaties  now  in  effect.    	This  policy
					was  also  continued  during  the  special  session  of  the  General  Assembly  on
	  	-		    	disarmament  where  the  PRC  did  not  take  part  in  approving  the  concluding
			     	document.    	Thereby~   	it  demonstrably  disassociai~d  itself  from  the  ba.sic  goals
			     	of  halting  the  very  dangerous  arms  race	 	goa,ls  which  were  supported  by
			     	p~actically  all  peaceloving  humanity.
			     	Nevertheless,   	the  work  of  the  special  session  of  the  General  Assembly
			     	distinctly  showed  that'the  idea  of  disarmament  enjoyed  very  wide  support  in
			     	the  world.    	The  concluding  document  in  whose  preamble  the  ~a,sk  "to  lay  the
			     	foundations  of  an  international  strategy  of  disarmament",1`  which  was  adopted
			     	by  it~   	eloquently  testifies  to  this.
			     	The  concluding  docwnent  of  the  special  session  is  a  de:ta.iled  resolution  which
			     	embraces  p~atically  a11  the  basic  aspects  of  the  disarmament  problem.    	It
			     	touches  upon  both  the  general  questions  connected  with  the  nat~e  of  dis-
	   	.		  	armament's  role  in  ensuring  international  security  and  upon  concrete  m~asu~es in
	 	_		   	this  area.    	The  document  consists  of  four  sectionss    	an  intxoduction~  a
			     	declaration,  an  action  program,  and  recommendations  relative  to  an  internat-
			     	ioz~al  mechanism  for  examining  disa.rmament  questions.    	On  the  whole,   	the
			     	document  is  the  most  deta.iled  of  all  the  resolutions  on  disa.rmament  questions,
			     	ever  adopted  by  the  UN  General  Assembly.
			    	The  leit-motif  of  the  aoncluding  document  is  the  thesis  on  the  necessity  to
			    	use  disarmament  measures  as  a  reliable  guarantee  of  international  security.
			    	It  is  pointed  out  in  the  Introduc~ion~    	"The  time  ha,s  come.,.   	to  begin  search-
			    	ing  for  security  through  disarmament~   	tha.t  is~   	through  a  gradua.l  but  effect-
			    	ive  process  which  will  begin  with  a  decrease  in  the  present  arms  level"   	(p  1).
			    	This  ta,sk  is  justifiably  linked  in  the  document  withthe  development  of'the
			    	relaxation  process  in  modern  int~rnational  relations.    	Naturally,   	the  arms
			    	race~   	which  continues  the  competition  in  stock  piling  systems  of  destruction,
			    	contxadicts  this.    	The  declaxation  on  this  sub3ect  saysi    	"Now  as  never  before,
			    	mankind  faces  the  threat  of  self-destruction  as  a  result  of  the  c~t~tiuing
			    	state  of  affairs  in  accumulating  on  an  enormous  scale  the  most  destructivE
			    	wea.pons  ever  produced.    	Already  existing  nuclear  weapons  are  more  than  suff-
			    	icient  to  destroy  life  on  earth"   	(p  11~.    	~e  declaration  proves  very  thorough-
			    	ly  the  thesis  that  the  continua.tion  of  the  arms  race  would  have  multi-~ided
			    	negative  consequences  for  peace  and  security.
			    	"The  primary  tasks  and  measures  in  the  area  of  disarmament,   	whose  implementa-

		   	disa.rmament  questions,    	On  this  score,   	the  general  grogram  boils  down  to  the			   	.
		   	following  three  items~    	(a)  halting  the  qualitative  im~rovement  and  develop-
		   	ment  of  nuclear  w~eapons,   	(b)   	halting  the  ~oduction  of  nuclear  weapons,
		   	delivery  systems~  and  the  fissionable  materiale  for  making  them,  and  (c)  a
		   	combined  step-by-step  program  for  the  gradual  and  balanced  reduction  of
		   	nuclear  weapon  and  delivery  system  stock-piles  (p  50).    	The  halting  of
		   	nuclear  weapon  tests  by  all  states,  new  agreements  between  the  USSR  and  the
		   	United  States  on  limiting strategic  axms,  agreements  on  p~eventing  the  use  of
		   	nuclear  weapons,   	the  creation  of  z~nes  free  of  nuclear  weapons  (especially
		   	in  Africa  and  the  Near  East),  and  reducing  the  danger  of  the  spread  of  nuclear
		   	weapons  to  a  minimum    	were  specially  mentioned  among  the  specific  nucleax
		   	disarmament  measures.
		   	The  "Action  Program"  devotes  quite  a  bit  of  attention  to  questions  on  banning
		   	other  types  of  weapons  of.mass  destruction.    	A  cal]_  to  all  sta.tes,   	which
		   	have  still  not  done  this,   	to  join  the  1925  Geneva  p~otocol  and  the  convention
		   	on  banning  the  development,   	production  and  stock-piling  of  bacteriological
		   	(biological~  and  toxic  weapon  supplies~  is  contained  in  it.    	The  complete
		  	and  effective  banning  of  the  development~  production  and  stock-piling  of
		   	chemical  weapons  is  mentioned  as  one  of  the  most  urgent  tasks.    	Another  press-			 	-
		   	ing  measure  is  the  banning  of  radiological  wea,pons.
		   	The  propositions  concerning  the  prevention  of  a  qua,lit~.tive  arms  race  which
		  	are  in  the  "Actlon  Program"  are  of  fundamental  importa.nce.    	In  this  connection~
		   	trie  ta,sk  "to  take  effective  steps  to  avoid  the  danger  and  prevent  the  appear-
		  	ance  of  new  types  of  weapons  of  ma.ss  destruction  based  on  new  scientific
		  	nrinciples  anci  achievements"   	(p  77)   	was  formulated.
		  	I�  is  necessary  to  pay  attention  to  the  fact  that  the  "Ac:tion  Program"  cleaxly
		  	~oints  out  the  need  to  prevent  an  axms  race  in  all  areas  where  it  can  pract-
		  	i.~:a11y  develop.    	The  pro~am  especially  mentions  in  paxticular  such  aspects
			 	this  problem  as  banning  the  military  use  of  systems  to  affect  the  environ-
		  	ment  and  preventing  an  arms  race  on  the  bottom  of  the  sea  and  ocean  and  in
		  	~pace.    	The  importance  of  limiting  and  reduciz~g  conventional  arms  and  armad
		  	f~r~es  is  also  pointed  out  in  the  program.    	This  task  was  formulated,   	in

					and  deeper  nature  to  the  examination  of  disarma.ment  questions  within    	the
					UN.    	For  this  purpose~   	it  is  provided  that  the  first  committee  of  the  General

					the  international  security  questions  connected  tirith  them.    	Besides  thiso  a
	  	_		   	Commission  on  Disarmament  composed  of  all  UN  members  was  created.    	This

					affairs  connected  with  the  decisions  and  recommendations  of  the  special  sess-
					ion  devoted  to  disarmament''(p  118).    	Practically  speaking,   	this  reorganizat-
					ion  of  the  Commission  on  Disaxmament  was  aimed  at  converi:ing  it  into  an
					actively  operating  internationa.l  orga.n  for  examining  disarmament  questions.
	  	'		   	In  general,  all  the  propositions  in  the  mecha.nism  section  are  essentially			  	_
					aimed  at  improving  the  results  of  disa.rmament  negotiations.    	This  also  relates
					to  the  planned  prosperity  for  convening  a  second  special  session  of  the
					General  Assembly  devoted  to  disarmament  (the  period  for  convening  it  is
					subject  to  being  determined  somewha,t  later).    	The  propositions  concerning  the
					reorgan3.zation  of  the  Committee  on  Disarmament--the  ba.sic  working  organ
					within  which  international  treaties  in  this  area  are  prepared		are  another
					item  of  no  small  importance.
					This  reorga.nization  primarily  concerns  expanding  the  compositions  of  the
					committee.    	Henceforth,   	participation  in  the  committee  will  be  open  to  the
					fiv.e  nuclear  pr;wers  and  35  other  states.    	Subsequently,   	the  composition  of
					the  committee   	(it  is  also  necessary  to  note  this  as  a  new  item~   	will  be
			     	reviewed  periodically.    	The  fixst  session  of  the  Committee  with  its  new

					Despite  the  recommendation  nature  of  the  concluding  document,   	the  session
					wa.s  undoubteclly  a  very  timely  and  important  measure.
					It  is  necessary  to  mention  that  a  NATO  Council  session~   	wholly  devoted  to
					whipping  up  the  arms  race,   	wa,s  held  in  Washington  during  the  work  of  the  UN
					General  Assembly's  special  session  on  disarmament.    	It  took  place  under
					the  badge  of  developing  plans  to  strengthen  the  military  prepaxations  of  this
			     	military  bloc;    	in  particular,  decisions  on  strengthening  its  air  and  naval
					forces,   	increasing  the  number  of  ~Imerican  troops  in  Western  Europe,  and  rais-
					ing  the  military  budgets  of  the  NATO  member  states  were  worked  out.    	The
			     	actions  of  the  NATO  member  sta.tes  were  assessed  by  peaceloving  humanity  as
			     	a  deliberate  demonstration  of  their  attachmenttn  whipping  up  the  arms  race
			     	and  increasing  tensions.
			     	In  this  connection.   	L.I.  Brezhnev's  words  resound  with  enormous  force=    	"The		     	R
			     	leaders  of  a  number  of  NATO's  leading  countries,  especially  the  United  States,

				     	[Text]    	The  1960's  and  `70s  will  go  down  in  the  history  of  international
				     	relations  as  a  period  filled  with  turbulent  and  compl:x  events  and  severe
				    	in*_ernational  crises,   	as  a  time  of  profound  and  rapid  changes  in  the				     	~
				    	shape  of  the  world.    	The  most  perceptible  feature  on  the  frontier  of  the
				     	'bOs  and  '70s  was  the  consistent  policy  pursued  by  the  USSR  and  the  other
				    	socialist  natians  to  strengthen  peace  and  the  security  of  nations,   	a
				    	policy  maCerialized  in  the  process  of  detente.
				    	The  book  being  reviewed  sheds  light  upon  the  most  important  problems  of
				    	international  relations  and  diplomacy  in  the   	'60s  and  '70s.    	As  in  pre-
				    	vious  volumes  of  this  major  study,   	the  main  focus  is  upon  key  issues  of
				    	USSR  foreign  policy  and  the  development  of  international  relations  during
		    	-		 	the  period  studied.    	The  contents  of  the  book  are  a:ranged  according  to
				    	problems   	and  areas:    	along  with  explaining  questions  of  international
				    	ralations  in  the  main  areas   	(Europe,   	the  Near  and  Middle  East,  A�rica,
				    	Latin  America,   	and  so  forth)   	it  also  discusses  a  number  of  international
				    	problems  and  circumstances,  without  a  knowledge  of  which  it  is  impossible
				    	to  form  a  sufficiently  complete  and  correct  concept  of  the  nature  of
				    	international  relations  during  the  period  considered  (various  aspects  of
				    	the  struggle  for  detente,   	the  nonalignment  movement,   	the  UN  and  problems
				    	of  maintaining  peace,   	and  so  forth).
				    	We  believe  that  it  was  precisely  this  arrangement  of  the  material  which
				    	has  permitted  the  authors  thoroughly  and  comprehensively  to  investigate
				    	the  entire  system  of  contemporary  international  relations.    	Central  among
				    	the  issues  covered  in  the  book  are  questions  pert~Lning  to  the  struggle

		  	-		     	The  persistent  and  systematic  struggle  conducted  as  a  part  of  socialism~s
					  	diplomatic  efforts  in  the  1960's  and  `70s,  made  it  possible  to  resolve
					  	many  peaceful  settlement  issues  in  Europe.    	The  result  was  a  transition
					  	from  an  area  of  "cold  war'~  and  confrantation  to  detente  and  cooperation.			 	-
					  	The  policy  of  detente  helped  strengthen  the  principles  of  peaceful
					  	coexistence  and  ser~Lously  hampered  the  efforts  of  imperialist  groups  in
		  	_		     	the  West  to  renew  the  "cold  war"  against  the  socialist  nations.					   	-
					  	The  book  stresses  the  fact   	that  decisions  coming  out  of  the   	1975  Helsinki
					  	Conference  on  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,   	the  convening  of  which
		  	-		     	was  made  possible  by  joint  or  coordinated  actions  on  the  part  of  the

					  	as  by  the   	development  of  trends  toward  realiam  in  the  policiea  of  the
					  	Western  nations,  were  highly  important  for  the  strengthening  of  peace
					  	throughout  the  world  and  for  the  spreading  of  detente  to  all  areas  of  the
					  	globe   	(p  145).    	The  5  years  which  have  gone  by  since  the  Helsinki  Con-
					  	ference  have  shawn  that  the  foreign  policy  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the
					  	other  nations  ir~  the  socialist  commonwealth  steadfastly  adheres  to  the
					  	principles  underlying  the  Helsinki  agreements.    	They  consistently  speak
					  	out  in  favor  of  expanding  steps  to  strengthen  mutual  trust  in  Europe  and
					  	to  reduce  military  confrontatian  between  the  socialist  and  capitalist			     	_
					  	states.    	In  the  years  which  have  passed  since  the  Hekinki  Confe~ce  we  have
					 	been  able  to  achieve  substantial  normalization  of  relations  between  the
					  	socialist   	and  Western  nations  and,  what  is  especially  important,   	a  certain
					  	stability  in  relations  between  the  USSR  and  the  ~nited  States.    	All  of
					  	these  complex  processes  in  international  affairs  have  been  explained  with
					  	sufficient  eompleteness  in  the  book  which  is   	the  subject  of  this  review.
					  	A  significant  portion  of  the  book  is  devoted  to  an  analysis   	of  interna-
					  	tional  relations  in  Asia  and  Africa.    	We  would  like  to  make  special				  	-
					 	mention  of  this   	fact,   	since  this  is  essentially  the  first  such  complete
					  	and  thorough  coverage  of  issues  pertaining  to  the  step-up  in  the  foreign
					  	policy  activities  of  Asian  and  African  states  and  to  their  growing
					  	influence  upon  the  development  of  international    	relations.    	This  new
					  	development  in  contemporary  internatianal  affairs  is  a  result  of  far-
					  	reaching  structural  changes  produced  in  the  system  of  international  rela-
					  	tions  by  the  collapse  of  imperialism's  colonial  system.    	The  book  traces
					 	the  development  of  the  diplomacy  of  the  young  Asian  and  African  states
					 	and  describes  its  struggle  to  strengthen  the  political  and  economic
					 	independence  of  those  nations  and  to  bring  the  liberated  states  onto  the
					 	world  scene  as  equal  members  of  the  international  co~nunity.    	Their  large
					 	and  positive  role  in  all  contemporary  international  life  is   	to  a  great
					 	degree   	the  result  of  the  sincere  support  received  from  the  states  of  the
					 	socialist  commonwealth.    	It  is,   	therefore,  perfectly  natural  that  one  of
					  	the  important  aspects  of  this  book  is  provided  by  an  analysis  of  relations

					The  b ook  convincingly  shows  us  that  the  Soviet  Union~s   	cooperation  with
				 	the  national  liberation  movement  has  diverse  forms,   	the  most  important  of
					which  are  political  and  moral  support,   	economic  and  iinancial  aid  and,
				 	final ly,  military  coope ration  and  support  when  the  peoples  of  the  Afro-
					Asian  nations  need  such  assistance  to  achieve  political  independence  or
				 	to  def2nd  it  against  the  'encroachments  of  the  imperialists.							  	_
					Relations  between  the  USSR  and  the  liberated  na~tions  are  conceived
					primarily  as  the  all-round  and  disinterested  fostering  of  complete  decolo-
					nization  and  independent  development  by  the  socialist  power  and  the
					estab lishment  of  a  new  type  of  equal  and  mutually  beneficial  interna-
				 	tional  relations.    	The  existence  of  this  factor,   	to  be  specific,   	the						~
					existence  of  the  USSR  and  the  other  socialist  nations  with  their  constant
				 	readiness  to  provide  support  for  the  national  liberation  movement,   	is
				 	creating  a  fundamentally  new  climate  in  international  relations  and
				 	forcing  the  imperialist  pawers  to  take  this  into  cansideration  in  their
					approach  to  mutua~  relations  with  the  developing  nations.							     	_
					As  the  book  shows  us,   	the  economic,   	political  and  military  strength  of
				 	the  USSR  constitute  the  main  obstacle  to  imperialism's  neocolonialist
					expansion  and,   	furthermore,   	that  it  has  in  many  cases  forced  the  impe-
					rialists   	to  refrain  from  the  use  of  force  and  crude  dictating  with  respect
				 	to  the  developing  nations.
					The  book  also  describes   	a  number  of  cases  in  which  the  Soviet  Union,
				 	fulfilling  its  international  duty,  has  cone  to   	the  aid  of  the  peoples
					of  Asia,   	Africa  and  Latin  America,   	the  victims  of  imperialist  aggression.
			_			Specifically,   	our  nation  provided  such  assistance  to  the  Arab  peoples,   	to			   	,
					Vietn am,   	Angola,  Ethiopia  and  other  nations  in  the  1960's  and  '70s.
					The  authors  thoroughly  expose  the  neocolonialist  policy  of  the  United
					States  and  other  imperialist  pawers  during  the  period  discussed.    	A
					characteristic  feature  of  this  policy  was  growing  intervention  into  the
					internal  affairs  of  other  people.s  in  the  most  diverse  areas  of  the  world.
					In  tliis  process,   	imperialism  has  counted  mainly  on  the  conflicts  which
					exist  between  the  developing  nations.    	Taking  advantage  of  these  conflicts,
					the  West  has  attempted  to  place  those  nations  with  progressive,
					revolutionary-democratic  regimes  into  the  most  difficult  economic  and
					political  circumstances  possib le.
					Along  with  imperialism,   	the  present  Chinese  leadership  is  exerting  an
					extremely  destabilizing  influence  upon  the  situation  in  Asia  and  through-
					out  the  world.    	In  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  foreign  policy  of  the  PRC,
					especially  its  evolution  in  the  1960~s  and   	'70s,   	the  authors  of  the  book			     	.
					show  how  Beijing  has  gradually  stepped  up  its  search  for  ways  to  achieve
					a  rapprochement  with  the  imperialist  nations  as   	anti-Sovietism  has
					increased.    	"Beijing`s   	criticism  of  the  United  States  became  increasingly

		   	In  the  first  years  of  socialist  conetruction  the  problem  of  i~roving  the  na-
		   	tional  economic  structure  was  resolved  solely  in  favor  of  accelerated  develop-
		   	ment  of  heavy  industry.    	The  vast  economi.c  rmeasures  that  strained  all  the  re-
		   	sources  and  forces  of  the  people  made  it  possible  to  place  the  national  econo-
		   	~r  on  the  path  of  modern  industry  and  to  make  rad-Lcal  changes  in  its  stracture
		   	in  a  very  brie.f  historical  peMod.    	~ile  in  the  initial  period  of  aocialist
		   	construction  most  of  the  national  income  came  from  agriculture,  now  over  60
		   	percent  of  it  is  produced  in  industry  and  construction.
		   	The  nation  has  become  a  modern  industrial  one,   	covered  by  a  network  of  elec-
		   	tric  power  stations.    	New  cities  and  industrial  centers  have  been  created
		   	and  large  new  regional-industrial  complexes  have  been  formed.    	The  vast  and
		   	rapid  growth  of  the  USSR~s  industrial  po~rer  is  evidenced  by  comparing  it  w3.th
		   	the  grow~h  of  the  industrial  output  of  the  most  developed  capitalist  country,
		   	the  United  States.    	In  1913  the  USSR  was  behind  the  United  States  by  7  times
		-	   	in  steel  smel.ting,  and  now  it  is  ahead  by  more  than  20  percent.    	We  were  mir~
		-	   	ing  2  timea  less  coal  t~han  the  United  States,  but  now  it  is  11  percent  more.
		   	Our  total  oil  extraction  was  7  td.mos  less  than  that  of  the  United  States,  and
		   	now  it,  is  33  percent  more.    	Our  cement  output  was  8  times  behi.nd  the  U.S.  to-
		   	'tal.,  while  no~r  it  exce~ds  the  latter  by  65  percent.    	We  are  now  producing  2.3

		   	and  1978  the  machine  building  and  metal  ~rorki.ng  outputs  increased  by  63  times
		   	and  that  of  electric  power  by  25  timee.    	This  made  it  posaible  to  increase  the
		   	ca.pi.tal-labor  ratio  and  the  power-worker  ratio  by  mar~y  t~imes.  From  19l~0  to
		   	1978  the  power= worker  ratio  ~s  increased     	nearly  7  times  in  industry  and  by
		   	mor~  than  11.~  times  in  a~riculture.    	(3)
		   	'rht~nks  to  the  pro~ressive  processes  in  the  econw~y,  an  adequate  technical-

		   	greater  share  of  the  resources  allocated  to  consumer  n~eeds.    	While  in  1970

			     	rates  of  the  main  productive  capital  of  agriculture  lagged  behind  the  corres-

			     	it  for  the  last  few  years.
	 	-		   	There  have  been  major  shifte  3n  the  social  structure.    	The  worldng  claea  hae
			     	increased  by  7  times  ~inae  1926.    	The  demands  for  acientific-techn3.ca1  pro-
			     	gresa,   	education  and  health  protection  have  enormously  augtnented  the  intelli-
			     	gentaia.    	The  nwnber  of  workers  engaged  in  largely  intellectual  ~ork  haa  risen
			     	t'Y'omm  3  million  in  1926  to  37.5  million,  or  by  12.5  times.    	The  agricultural
			     	population  has  considerably  diminished.    	lhiring  the  years  of  Soviet  power  the
			     	proportion  of  the  urban  population  has  increased  from  18  to  62  percent,  with
			     	an  absolute  increase  of  132.5  million  peraone.    	(5)
			     	qll.  this  has  intensified  a  number  of  social  problems,   	such  as  housing  and  sub-
			     	sistence  especially.    	To  describe  the  extent  of  the  housing  construction  need-
			     	ed  to  meet  the  increased  demands  for  dwelling  apace  in  the  citiee,   	it  is  suf-
			     	ficient  to  say  that  the  increas3  al.one  in  the  U9SR~s  urban  population  in  the
			    	years  of  9oviet  power  equals  the  enta.re  present  popul.ation  of  the  citie$  of
			     	~hgland,   	France,  Italy,  3weden  and  Denmark  together.    	The  USSR  has  built  3.3
			     	billion  cubic  meters  of  dwelling  space,  but  the  demand  for  comfortable  hous-
			     	ing  is  still  far  ~om  fully  satisfied.
			     	The  food  problem  has  also  taken  a  neW  form.    	Although  the  gross  agricultural
			     	output  has  increased  by  3.6  times,  regular  supply  of  the  public  with  high-
			     	quality  products  is  sti11  one  of  the  most  serious  problema.    	The  fact  muat  be
			     	considered  that  the  pro~portion  of  the  population  employed  in  agricultural  has
		_		   	declined  from  75  to  21  percent.    	While  in  the  past  one  agricultural  worker
			     	had  to  produce  for  t~o  persons,  now  it  is  11  peraons,  and  thia  ha+s  required  a
			    	pronounced  increase  in  labor  productivi~ty  (6)  and  the  capital-labor  ratio.
			     	Naturally  the  CPSU  Central  Committee  is  heavily  emphasizing  consolidation  and
			     	further  development  of  the  technical-material  hase  of  agriculture  and  itb
			     	more  effective  use.
			    	And  so  th~  structural  changes  that  took  place  in  the  national  economy  radical-			_
			    	lp  changed  the  na~ure  ~f  production,  ,~as~cally  strengthened  soeial  unity,  and
			    	extended  the  scope  and  possibilities  of  solving  the  current  and  long-range
			    	socioeconomic  problems.
			    	At  the  same  time  the  resulting  n,ational  economic  atructure  is  not  fu11y  meet-

			 	the  previous  period,   	the  rapid  growth  rates  of  the  new  technology  and  indus-
			 	trial  equipment  must  be  met  without  retarding  the  growth  rates  of  the  sectors
			 	producing  consumer  goods.    	Expressed  in  terms  of  economic  procedure,  the  pro-
			 	blem  of  correlating  the  growth  rates  of  these  t~ro  subdivi.sions  of  social  pro-
			 	duction  at  the  present  stage  consists  of  ineeting  the  ~rowing  demanda  for  pro-
			 	duction  means  on  an  intensive  rather  than  an  extensive  basis.    	This  problem
			 	is  urgent  because  the  output  of  uneconomic  production  means  keeps  increasing
			 	the  specific  outlays  of  rax  materials  to  makp  the  products  for  final  consur~-
			 	tion,   	to  the  detriment  of  the  economic  effectiveness  of  production.    	The
			 	growth  rate  o~'  the  Soviet  econor~r  are  increasingly  limited  by  the  growth  rates
	  	'	    	of  the  extxactive  sectors.
			 	Because  of  the  predominance  of  the  extensive  factors  of  production  ~owth,   	the
			 	latter~s  high  inputs  of  materiale  are  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  decline
			 	of  the  growth  rates  and  qualitative  indices  of  economic  deve.lopment.    	Whi1e  the
			 	average  annual  increase  in  used  national  incorne  came  to  7.1  percent  in  the					-
			 	Eighth  Fivs-Year  Plan,  it  Kas  5.1  percent  in  the  Ninth  and  4.2  percent  in  the
			 	lOth    	Five-Year  P1an.    	The  falling  growth  rates  of  the  national  income  are  ac-
			 	companied  by  a  steady  and  also  considerable  increase  in  the  nolume  of  fixed
			 	productive  capital  and  pt~ysical  worki.ng  capital  uaed  in  the  national  econor~.
			 	~ahile  the  : atio  of  the  growth  of  the  national  income  to  that  of  fixed  produc-
			 	tive  capital  in  the  Eighth  Five-Year  Plan  was  about  1:2,  in  the  Ninth  Five-
			 	Year  Plan  it  was  1:3.4,  and  in  the  first  years  of  the  l0~th  Five-Year  Plan  it
			 	is  already  l:1~.2.    	This  sl-iows  how  the  capital-output  ratio  is  declining.     	(7)
			 	Although  there  has  been  some  appro~dmation  of  the  growth  rates  of  the  first
			 	anc~  second  subdivisions,  the  declining  effectiveness  of  production  is  widening
			 	thE  gap  between  the  growth  of  production  and  that  of  consumption.    	This  dis-
			 	crepa.ncy  is  the  main  cause  of  the  steadily  growing  imbalance  between  th.e  pub-
			 	zic~s  cash  incomes  and  their  cnmmodity  purchases.
			 	'"he  ~xperience  of  the  last  few  years  has  shown  that  an  overall  increaee  in  the

			 	duc~t,ion  means,  actually  tends  to  aggrava,te  the  shortage.    	The  fact  is  that  the
			 	ex+,,x~active  sectors  of  production  consume  the  most  capital  and  labor,  and  their
			 	e~ansion  requires  large  qua.ntities  of  energy,  mecha,nisms,  machinery  and  tr~-
			 	t~:�.ri.als  and  increases  the  volunu~  of  shipping.    	This  confronts  the  national  eco-
			 	;~omy  with  a  nery  serious  problem.    	The  demands  for  production  means  are  in-
			 	cr~ased,  and  the  efforts  to  meet  them  on  an  extensive  ba,ais  are  inadequate.

					The  nex  and  effective  system  of  machines  and  perfected  industrial  processes
					can  appear  in  a  few  years,  but  raw  material,  fuel  and  energy  are  needed  to-
					day.    	Now  the  ma~r.  ab~ectine  of  scientific  development  and  the  art  of  plan-
					ning  is  to  reorganize  the  econom~q  in  operation,  so  to  speak.    	Whi1e  making  a
					~ecisive    	effort  to  expedite  technical  reequipment  and  intensification  of  pro~
					duction  and  to  conserve  energ,y,  fl.iel,  metal  and  other  kinds  of  raw  mater3.al,
					the  party  also  coneiders  it  necessary  to  provide  for  the  future  development
					of  the  fuel  and  raw  material  base  and  metallurgy,  as  we~l  as  other  industria].		 	_
					sectors.    	Meanwhile  the  general  effort  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  an~i  qual-~
					ity  of  opera~ions  and  to  introduce  intensive  methods  of  economic  dev~elopment
					is  to  determ~ne  the  future  rates  arHd  proportions  of  socia3ist  reproduction  in
					keeping  with  the  structural  changes  among  and  within  the  aectors.
					Of  courae  it  is  easier  to  put  off  planning  and  the  start  of  the  radical  change
					in  plazini.ng  from  one  year  to  the  next  or  from  the  current  fice-year  plan  to
					the  nex  one  on  the  pretext  that  all  the  proport~.ons  and  resources  are  alreac~y
				 	'~tied  up.~?   	But  this  approach  does  not  solve  the  urgent  problems  and  mere],y
					postpones  and  complicatea  thera.    	It  is  a  question  of  developing  and  immediateT
					ly  ing~lementing  the  nex  conception  of  economic  groxth  with  heavy  emphasis  upor~
					intensive  developmsnt.
					But  ~hat  does  intensification  mean?    	The  nature  and  criteria  of  the  intens~ve
					type  of  growth  have  not  yet  been  clearly  defined  in  science  or  in  economi.c
	  	-		    	practice.    	Often  intensification  means  ar~y  production  inerease  through  additi~
					ona].  inveatmenta  in  ~ixed  productive  capital  regardless  of  the  correlation  of
					the  invested  resources  and  the  end  results.    	For  exang~le,  a  gain  in  live  ].a~bor	     	-
					productivity  made  by  increasing  its  capital-labor  ratio  is  often  interpreted
					as  a  factor  for  intensification  even  when  the  saving  in  live  labor  does  not
					cover  the  outlays  for  its  equipment,   	or  in  other  words  when  the  total  outlays
					per  w~it  of  finished  output  are  increased.    	On  this  basis  a  gain  in  national
					income  made  ~rithout  3ncreasing  the  number  of  workers  is  considered  an  expres-
					si.on  of  intensified  product3on,  although  thi~  gain  is  made  by  an  overezpendi-
					ture  of  pa,at  labor,   	that  is  the  labor  outlays  to  create  the  producti~n  means.
					But  the  fact  is  that  intensification  of  the  econon~r  is  not  solel,y  a  matter  of
					lower  outlays  of  live  labor  with  an  increase  in  its  capital-labor  ratio.    	It
					also  requires  reduct~on  of  the  output-capital  ratio  and  the  material  iriputs  of
					production.    	According  to  K.  Marx~   	methodology,  there  can  be  no  intensi.fic~-
					tion  of  the  production  process  unless  the  total  output  is  increased  not  by  e~c-
					panding  the  ~field  of  production~  but  primarily  by  uae  of  effective  labox  r~e
					sourcea.
	  	~		     	In  considering  reduction  of  the  production  cost  of  machines  per  unit  of  their
					productivity,  which  is  eqzzivalent  to  reduction  of  the  output-capital  rati.o  of
					production,  Marx  directly  pointed  out  that  under  conditions  of  technical  pro-
					gress  nthere  is  no  necessity  of  an  absolute  increase  in  the  operating  capital
					production  costs.~~    	(8)
					The  viex  is  sometimes  heard  that  technical  progress  is  inevitably  accompanied
					by  an  increaae  in  the  output-capital  ratio,  which  conflicts  with  the  vier~r~  c;:f

		     	Marxist  theory  F~nd  with  historical  experience.    	K.  Marx  also  pointed  out  in
	   	-	   	" Capital"  that  with  scientific  and  techn~ical  progress  the  old  machines~   	tools
		     	and  devices  are  replaced  by  more  effective  ones  that  are  cheaper  in  relation
		     	to  the  aniounts  of  work  they  perform.    	'~Production  of  machines  by  means  of  ma-
				chinea  reduces  t,heir  production  coat  in  re].ation  to  their  outpute  and  their
		     	performanoe."    	(9)
				In  the  present  stage  technical  improvement  of  production  and  the  rapid  econaa??-
				ic  growth  rates  require  considerably  faster  development  of  the  technically  ad-
		     	vanced  sectors  of  industry,  such  as  electric  power  engineering,  electronics,
				the  most  effective  types  of  machine  and  instrument  building,  and  the  other
				sectors  that  determine  technical  progress.    	As  for  the  traditional  sectors,
				such  as  extraction  and  processing  of  natural  "rax  materials  and  production  oi
				construct3.on  materials,   	the  requirements  of  the  national  econon~y  for  the  pro-
	   	�	  	ducts  of  these  sectors  can  and  should  be  met  by  reducing  their  specific  con-
	   	-	   	sumption  norms.
		     	As  we  lrnoW~  the  proportion  of  past~  materialized  labor  in  the  total  social
		     	product  nox  exceeds  60  percent,  and  it  comes  to  80  percent  and  more  in  the
		     	processing  aectors,  while  that  of  live  labor  is  about  15  percent.    	Therefore
				reduction  of  the  material  iriputs  and  the  output-capital  ratio  of  the  product
		     	is  important  not  only  from  the  standpoint  of  improving  the  current  cost  ac-				  	_
				counting  indices  of  production  alone.    	The  fact  is  equally  important  that  low-			   	~
				ering  the  specific  outlays  of  fuel,  raw  material  and  mateMals  and  raising  the
	   	_	  	capital-orutput  ratio  are  the  most  effectiv~e  way  of  rationalizing  the  propor-
	   	_	   	f.3.ons  and  enhandng  the  role  of  the  intensive  factors  for  gro~th  as  well  as
		     	~-practicable  way  of~  ;~vercoming  the  marYpower  shortage.									 	-
				IInder  the  present  cir~~umstances  reduction  of  the  material  inputs  in  production
				is  to  becanne  one  of  �the  criteria  for  evaluating  the  scientific-technical  lenel
				of  pr~duction  in  ar;y  sector  and  in  every  enterprise.    	As  L.  I.  Brezhnev  point-
				ed  out,   	"Conserving  rax  materials  by  improving  production  in  the  processing
				induatry  is  much  prefera.ble  to  additional  production  of  the  same  quantities
				of  x~aw  materials.    	A  mere  1  percent  reduction  in  the  material  iriputs  in  the
				national  product  is  equivalent  to  an  additional  increase  in  the  nati.onal  ir~
				come  amount3ng  to  3-!~  billion  rubles."    	(10)											  	;
				I:~�the  past  the  trend  toward  reduction  of  material  inputs  was  obstructed  by
				eva.luation  of  the  enterprises~  and  sectors~   	act3vity  according  to  volumes  of
				grosa  output,  a  great  part  of  which  conaisted  of  the  raw  materials,  material.s
				and  manufactured  goods  procured  from  outside  that  xere  used  in  production.
				The  new  economic  mechanism  appro~ved  in  the  Decree  of  the  CPSU  Central  Commit-
		     	tee  and  the  USSR  Council  of  Miniatera  of  28  July  1979  eliminatea  this  drax-
		     	back  in  cost  accounting.    	When  the  poasibilities  of  economic  gror~rth  througk~
				the  extensive  factors  (and  especially  through  additional  ma~ower)  are  sharply
				curtailed,   	the  proportioned  and  balanced  quality  of  the  national  econon;y
				should  prav~ide  for  the  a1.7.-around  intensification  of  production  snd  especial.~y
				}�he  accelerated  growth  of  labor  product3.vity.
		     	The  main  ob~ectives  of  inq~roved  proportioning  of  social  production  are  clearly
		     	defined  in  the  party  decisions.    	These  are  better  proportions  of  consumption

			    	component  parts  of  a  uniform  sta.te  plan.
			    	The  problem  of  balanced  development  of  the  whole  national  economQr  becomes  pari-
			    	ticularly  urgent  in  connection  with  expanded  special-program  P1~~  activi.-
			    	ty.    	As  we  lalo~a,  the  problem  of  correlating  an~1  diatinguiehing  priorities  and
			    	balanc3.ng  has  always  been  acute~  and  now  it  ia  becoming  still  more  urgent.
			    	I,arge-scale  programs  usual.ly  require  heavy,  long-term  capital  investments  tak-
			    	lr~  a  number  of  years  to  pay  off~  and  it  is  clear  that  overloading  a  plan  with
			    	expensive  programs  can  make  balancing  difficult  and  delay  economic  growth.    	In
			    	his  time  K.  Marx  foresaw  that  proper  ciistribution  of  invest~ments  betwaen  long
			    	and  short  term  objectives  of  economic  turnover  under  socialism  would  ha.ve  to
			    	be  one  of  the  main  principles  of  planning.
			    	Use  of  the  potentials  and  advantagea  of  special-program  planning  depends  not
			     	only  upon  the  soundness  of  the  special    	programs  themselves  but  also  upon
			     	their  close  correlation  with  all  parts  of  the  national  economic  plan.    	If  this
			     	correlating  is  not  done  carefully  enough,  the  special-program  method  can  lead
			     	to  arbitrariness  in  planning  with  bad  effects.    	Therefore  coordination  of  the
			     	programs  w.~th  a]1  parts  of  the  pl.an  for  socioeconomic  development  is  particu-
			     	~ 3rly  important,  and  it  is  al.so  important  to  make  a  ra.tional  select3.on  of  the
			     	programs  included  in  the  plan  and  to  distinguish  in  their  composition  the  in-
			     	t~rmediate  ai.ms  and  sta.ges  of  their  implementation,  which  also  facilitates
			     	i~heir  correlation  with  the  other  parts  of  the  plano
			     	An  overall     	special  program  is  expected  to  subordinate  the  ac;ti.vities  of  the			 	-
			     	ma~y  organizations  implementing  it  to  a  single  purpose.    	Therefore  its  success
			     	hsavily  depends  upon  impraving  the  ways  and  means  of  regulating  implementation
			     	of  the  programs  and  especially  upon  specifying  the  organs  coordinating  the  op-
			     	eration  and  bearin~  full  responsibility  for  the  end  resultso    	Sound  scientific
			     	:ecommendations  are  also  needed  in  this  area.    	As  L.  I.  Brezhnev  remarked  at
			     	Lhe  25th  CPSU  Congress~   	'~It  is  important  in  each  case  to  have  specific  organs
			     	and  specific  people  bearing  full  responsibility  anci  coordinating  all  efforts
			     	within  a  given  pro~ram."    	(11)
			     	Development  of  ~ocia~i.st  economic  integration  requires  closer  coordination  of
			     	~he  ~eneral  programs  of  our  state  plan  with  the  long-term  special  programs  for
			     	c._;::.taboration  with  the  friendly  CF3~IA  countries  on  both  a  bilateral  and  a  mul-

				    	specified  in  the  plans.
				    	Thisd,  a  system  of  economic  indicators  must  be  devised  that  will  make  it  pos-

				    	placed  on  develapment  of  the  most  cozrq~lete  and  comprehensive  proportioning  to
				    	expedite  development  of  the  social  and  production  substructure.
				    	It  is  clear  fro~r?  the  foregoing  that  solution  of  the  problem  of  maintaining
				    	and  impro~ving  planned  proportioning  heavily  dependa  upon  the  quality  of  eco-

					the  national  economies  of  the  US3R  and  the  countries  of  the  socialist  camp

					The  only  way  to  overcome  these  unfavorable  trends  is  to  i~rove  the  organiza-
					tional-economic  conditions  for  developing  the  plants  in  the  newly  assimilated
					industrial  regions.    	F~ctension  of  the  r3.ghts  and  development  of  the  initiative

						Particular  Problems  of  Improving  Economic  Management
					Some  o.f  the  exi.sting  reserves  for  intensification  can  still  be  pointed  out.
				 	First  of  all,  in  the  extraction  of  useful  minerals  the  prc~portion  of  them
				 	left  in  the  ground  must  be  sharply  reduced.    	Residues  of  this  kind  have  reach-
				 	ed  1~0.~0  percent  and  more  of  the  total  volume  of  reaerves  on  balance.    	In  the
				 	total  of  more  than  6.5  billion  tons  of  useful  minerals  extracted  by  the  entire
				 	extractive  industry,  the  losses  amount  to  2.5  billion  tons.    	Of  these  500  mil-
				 	lion  tons  amounting  to  5-7  billion  rubles  have  been  eliminated  at  the  present
				 	levnl  of  techno~.ogy,  and  science  has  now  recommended  maray  new  methods  for  cdm-
				 	nlete  ex~loitation  of  the  resources  that  should  be  introduced.
				 	In  the  processing  industry,  t3.mely  and  regular  renavation  of  production  equip-
				 	ment  is  the  most  important  reserve  for  increasing  the  return  on  capital.    	Ac-
				 	cumul.ation  of  obsolete  and  worn-out  assets  in  the  sectors  prevents  3.mprovement
				 	of  the  econoraic  indices,  ties  up  great  manpower  resovrces,  and  necessitates
				 	excessive  outlays  for  repairs  that  are  often  on  a  low  technical  level,  xhile
				 	renovation  of  the  equipment  produces  rapid  and  effec~ive  results.
				 	I=~,adical  imprclvement  of  the  structure  and  technical  standaa,ds  of  machine  build-
				 	in~  and  its  output  has  became  urgent.    	It  is  necessary  to  overcoane  the  fragmen-
				 	tation  of  machine  building,  whereby  !~5  percent  of  the  nation~s  whole  inventory
				 	of  rnetal  processing  equip~nent  and  no  less  than  5  million  workers  are  employed
				 	i.n  mach~.ne  shops  and  sections  of  nonmachine-building  plants  to  repair  and  make
				 	nonstandard,   	someti.mes  handmade  equipment.    	According  to  the  economists~  fi-			   	.
				 	gures,  t:air  labor  prod.uctivity  is  20  percent  less  and  their  capital-ouput
				 	ratio  is  25  percent  lower  than  those  of  the  specialized  machine  building  en-
				 	terprises.    	More  intensive  specializat3.on,  cooperation  and  concentration  of
				 	rrjachine  build3ng  are  long  overdue,  as  well  as  introduction  of  guarantee  servic-
				 	ing  and  repair  of  all  kinda  of  prod.uction  equipment.
				 	It  would  be  expedient  to  emphasi.ze  such  an  important  factor  now  as  the  time
				 	of  use  of  equipment.    	The  cost  of  equipment  is  constantly  going  up,  and  under
				 	these  circumstances  its  use  on  one  shift  for  only  5  days  a~reek~  as  it  often			   	-
		  	_	    	happens  in  marxy  enterprf.ses,  is  unquestionably  an  extravaga.nce.    	Clearly  or-

						ca]1y  subetantiated  and  considered.    	For  example,  machine  tools  with  program
						control  carnzot  be  allowed  to  operate  for  only  a  few  howra  a  day.    	Not  even
						the  wealthiest  society  can  afford  that.
						Ing~roved  balancing  of  the  national  econo~r  is  the  main  requirement  for  obtai.n~
						ing  regular  production,  upon  Which  effective  use  of  manpo~rer  and  all  other  re-~
						sources  ultimately  depends.    	In  manQr  enterprises  as  much  as  50  or  even  75  perp
						cent  of  the  entire  output  is  produced  in  the  last  10  days.    	This  is  because
						the  enterprises  determine  the  rnunber  of  ~rorkers  just  for  the  last  10  days  and
						consequently  the  use  of  manpower  is  far  from  effectively  planned  in  advance
						or  overtims  is  used,  which  increases  production  costs.    	Losses  of  working  t3m~e
						during  shifts  are  sti11  heavy.    	According  to  the  time  studies  of  the  ~rork  d.ar,y
						made  in  a  number  of  enterprises  of  various  industrial  sectors,  the  regular
						workers  spend  an  average  af  only  50-70  percent  of  the  total  working  time  on
						perf ormance  of  the  shift ~ s  task.
						For  purposes  of  maxtmum  use  of  labor  resources  and  productive  capital.,   	transi-
						tion  to  advanced  forms  of  labor  organization,  especially  brigade  methods,  must			~
						be  expedited  by  all  means.    	As  a  rule  introduction  of  brigade  methods  of  labor
						organization  malces  it  possible  to  raise  labor  productivity  by  8-20  percent  and
						to  reduce  the  personnel  turnover  by  1.5-2  times.
						Faster  assimilation  of  new  capital  has  great  possibilities  for  raising  the
						capital-output  ratio.    	The  annual  acquisitions  of  new  capital  amount  to  the
						impressive  total  of  10-12  percent  of  the  whole  volume  of  existing  capital.
						By  the  present  standards  it  takes  from  1  to  3  years  to  assimilate  it  throu~a-
		  	-		    	out  the  various  plants,  and  the  acttial  time  of  assimilati~n  exceeds  the  stand~
						ards  by  1.5-2  times.    	By  the  present  accounts~  the  production  lag  in  new  en-
		  	_		    	terprisea  in  the  first  years  of  their  operat3on  amounts  to  !~5  percent  and
						more,  and  this  means  a  marked  reduction  of  the  capital-output  rati.o  and  the
						economic  ~ro~rth  rates.															     	_
		  	-		    	Organization  of  scientific  studies  and  the  planning  and  financing  of  scientific	     	-
						institutions  are  still  flawed  by  backward  thinking  in  terms  of  extensive
						growth.    	During  the  post~ar  years  the  number  of  scientific  workers  has  been
						increased  by  about  10  times  but  their  supply  of  equipment,  their  capital-labor
						ratio  so  to  speak,  has  lagged  considerably  and  this  is  i.nterfering  with  the
						growth  of  the  scientific  institutions~  effectiveness.    	Unfortunately  this  par-
		  	-		    	ticularly  affects  basic  scientific  research.    	In  preparation  for  their  recent
						meeting  the  cammissions  of  the  US3R  Supreme  Soviet  po3nted  out  that  the  USSR

					society.    	The  content  of  social  contacta  has  been  enriched  by  the  grrowing  gen-

					specialization  of  production  along  with  the  development  of  intersectorial  con-
					tacts  i.n  the  national  econmr~r  directly  affect    	the  development  of  socialist
					cooperation  of  labor  and  ca11  for  the  moet  effective  methods  of  involving				  	.
					the  workers  in  management  and  consequently  of  enhancing  the  role  of  t1:e  work-
					Ers  collectives  and  public  organizations  in  fulfilling  the  socioeconomic
					tasks  confronting  our  whole  society.
					The  regular  process  of  development  of  socialist  production  relations  is  mani-
					fested  in  the  great  social  changes  made  in  the  course  of  approximating  the
					two  forms  of  socialist  ownership  and  establishing  the  complete  social  hamogen-
					eity  of  our  society.    	Regrett.ably  the  scientific  institutions  have  not  yet  pro-
					vide  any  accurate  instruments  for  determining  the  quantitative  and  qualitative
					parameters  of  mar~y  social  phenomena  occurring  in  our  society.    	Needless  to  say,
					without  these  measuring  instruments  it  is  difficult  to  discover  the  actual
					trends  of  social  development  and  to  influence  them  in  planned  fashion.
					To  be  sure  this  does  not  mean  that  the  indices  of  soci.al  develapment  now  used
					in  planr~.ng  (improvement  of  workers  qualifications  and.  profession  skill.s,   	gen-
					eral  educational  and  cultural  leveZ  of  the  population,  improvement  of  housing,
					cultural  and  personal  living  conditions.and  medical  care,  and  mar~  others)  do
					not  reflect  the  processes  implemented.  by  planning  in  society  as  a  whole  and
					in  the  republics~  oblasts~  krays~  cities'  villages,   	structure  of  the  sectors,
					e~c.    	But  the  task  clearly  consists  in  presenting  all  these  indices  as  a
					whole  and  mainly  in  proper  correlation  with  the  tasks  for  production  develop-
					ment,  �or  capital  construction~  and  for  improvement  of  their  effectiveness.
					The  ro].e  of  the  social  factors  that  must  be  more  completely  reflected.in  the
					planning  system  is  apparent  from  the  example  of  such  a  huge  social  undertaking
					as  eliminating  the  essential  social  differences  between  mental  and  physical
					work.    	As  we  lrnow,  one  of  the  vital  requirements  for  thi.s  is  oeercoming  the
					re~mnants  of  the  old  division  of  labor  and  especially  eliminating  heavy  manual
					labor,  which  still  plays  a  relatively  large  part  in  the  total  social  labor  in
				 	our  national  econorr~.    	kre  can  compute  the  economic  effect  of  the  conversion
				 	af  marnaal  to  mechanized  labor  more  or  less  accurately.    	But  the  social  effect
				 	~t  the  changes  in  labor  is  no  less  important  in  the  critical  area  of  social
					ac:tivi.ty,  which  determi~es  the  changes  in  all  other  areas.
					Gradual  e7.3.mination  of  the  social  differences  between  city  and  village  is  an-
				 	other  enormous  task  that  is  being  successfully  accomplished  in  our  society.
					As  we  lrnow,  a  developed  program  for  this  was  provided  in  the  decisions  of  the
					July  (1978)  P'lenum  of  the  CPSII  Central  Committee,  which  includes  extensive

					USSR  Supreme  Soviet  of  the  Ninth  Convocation,   	"by  no  means  aignifies  the
					disappearance  of  national  distinctions."
					Every  nation  and  nationality  is  an  integral  part  of  the  unified  Soviet  peo-
					ple.    	The  content  of  national  sovereignty  under  the  conditions  of  the  exist-
					ence  of  this  historical  community  of  people  is  expreased  in  the  fact  that
			     	all  nations  and  nat~onalities  of  our  country,  becoming  increasingly  aware
			     	of  the  very  great  advantages  of  the  fraternal  union  of  a11  the  peoples  and
					their  international  unity,   	are  rallying  increasingly  close  together  in  a
			     	unified  union  state  and  strengthening  the  Soviet  federation--the  USSR.    	The
			     	further  strengthening  of  the  state-legal  relations  of  the:Soviet  nations  re-
			     	presents  a  sequential  process;   	it  is  precisely  along~  the  path  of  the  can-
			     	solidation  of  these  relations,  evidently,   	that  national  sovereignty  under
			     	the  conditions  of  the  entire  period  of  developed  socialism  will  be  realized,
			     	in  the  main.    	For  this  reason  the  opinion  of  Che  experts  in  the  science  of
			     	government  who  deny  a  further  strengthening  of  the  state-legal  relaCiona
			     	of  the  Soviet  nations  and  nationalities  in  the  period  of  the  building  o�

			     	lations  of  the  Soviet  nations  than  those  of  today  cannot  be  created.*    	I
			     	believe  it  is  impossibZe  to  disagree  that  our  country's  nations  and  nation-
			     	alities,  having  created  and  strengthened  their  national  statehood  within
			     	the  framework  of  the  Soviet  federation  and  remaining  sovereign,  wil.1  dis-

			     	A  moat  impoxtant  :aan3festation  of  the  further  rapprochement  of  the  nations

			 	and  perfection  of  their  state  union  and  state-legal  relations.    	This  is

			 	principles  of  Soviet  federation  and  the  forms  of  national  statehood  and  in

			 	All  Soviet  nations  and  nationalities  are  united  in  a  union  multinational
			 	state--the  USSR.    	They  have  been  convinced  on  the  basis  of  their  experience
			 	of  many  years'   	standing  what  rich  fruit  cohesion  in  the  USSR  has  afforded
			 	them  and  what   	tremendous  possibilities  it  will  open  in  the  futu~e,   	in  the
			 	course  of  the  building  of  the  communist  society.    	The  1977  USSR  Constitution
			 	de:acribed  the  USSR  as  a  unified  union  state  (article  70).    	Consequently,   	it
			 	is  a  federative  sta~te  in  which  a  high  degree  of  cohesion  of  all  nations  and
			 	nationalities  has  been  achieved.    	The  material  basis  of  this  unity  is  our
			 	economic  system.    	As  article  16  of  the  constitution  says,   	the  USSR  economy
			 	is  a  unified  national  economic  complex  embracing  all  elements  of  sonial
			 	production,  distribution and exchange  on  the  country's  territory.    	The  cohe-
	 	_	     	sian  of  the  working  people  of  all  the  country's  nations  and  nationalities
			 	in  a  unified  union  state  is  the  greatest  determining  factor  and  dependable
			 	guarantee  of  their  further  all-around  prosperity  and  the  strengthening  of
			 	t:~eir  sovareignty  and  international  unity.    	It  secures   	for  them  the  most
			 	favorable  conditions  for  free,   	comprehensive  political,   	social  and  cultural
			 	de~~elopment  with  regard  for  national  peculiarities.    	Whence  it  follows  per-
			 	fectlq  clearly  that  the  Soviet  nations  enjoy  their  sovereign  rights  under
			 	present  conditions  by  way  of  the  strengthening  and  perfection  of  forms  of
			 	their.  national  statehood  which  have  fully  ~uatified  themselves  and,   	chiefly,
			 	by  the  way  of  consolidation  of  the  USSR  and  its  international  unity.
			 	Development  prospects  of  the  Soviet  federation  at  the  eurrent  stage  of  com-
			 	munist  building.    	We  shall  examine  the  question  of  the  role  and  prospects
	 	~	     	of  Soviet  union  and  national  statehood  here  from  the  aspect  of  the  main  di-
			 	rectio:~  of  the  development  of  the  Soviet  society's  political  system--the
			 	furl-her  spread  of  socialist  democracy  on  the  basis  of  the  example  of  na-
			 	tional  relations.    	Linking  the  question  of  democracy  with  the  self-deter-
				mination  of  the  nations,  V.   	I.   	Lenin  wrote  that  "it  is  imposeible  for
				victorious  socialism  to  hold  on  .to  its  victory  and  lead  mankind  toward  the
	  	-	    	w.:t:-iering  away  of  the  state  without  the  implementation  of  democracy  in
			 	full.    	Therefore  when  it  is  said  that  self-determination  under  socialism
			 	is  redundant,   	thi.s  is  the  same  nonsense,   	the  same  helpless  muddle  as  if
			 	sameone  had  said  that  democracy  under  socialism  is  redundant."*    	It  is  now
				d.Lfficult  to  image  Soviet  socialist  democracy  without  f~deration  and  na-
				tional  statehood.    	Soviet  federalism  and  national  statehood  are  the  mani-
			 	festation  of  socialist  democracy  under  the  conditions  of  our  multinational
				state.    	The  democratism  of  the  Soviet  state  is  conditioned  by  the  fact  that

			 	insistently  against  this,   	and  we  will  not  depart  from  his  precepts."
			 	The  authors  denying  the  role  and  significance  of  the  Soviet  federation  and
			  	the  forcns  of  national  statehood  at  the  current  stage  attempt  to  ~ustif.y				  	_

			  	are  underway.    	But  in  reality,   	despite  the  migration  o�  the  population  and
			  	other  demographic  processes,  there  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  people
			  	of  the  basic  nations  of  the  union  and  autonomoua  republics,   	as  all  the  re-

			  	of  the  nation  which  has  given  its  name  to  the  republic  ia  increasing  in  the

	  	'	     	vincingiy  not  to  a"denationalization"  of  the  Soviet  republics  but  to  the
			  	fact  that  the  republics  are  an  important  form  insuring  the  comprehensive
			  	development  of  the  nations  and  a  form  of  the  solicitous  consideration  of  the
			  	interests  of  each  nation  and  the  working  people  of  all  nations  and  nation-

			  	has  a  section  entitled  "The  National-State  Arrangement  of  the  USSR"  in-
			  	atead  of  the  chapter  "The  State  Arrangement  of  the  USSR,"  which  was  in  the
			  	1936  US5R  Constitution.    	The  appellation  of  the  section  of  the  1977  Con-

					    	In  turn,   	the  union  republic  ~ouncils  of  ministers  mur~t  formulate  and  sub-
					    	mit  to  the  union  authorities  their  proposals  on  the  draft  plans  of  the
					    	enterprises  and  associations  of  union  ~urisdiction.    	The  union  and  auton-
					    	omoue  republic  councils  of  ministers  have  been  entrusted  with  the  compila-
					    	tion  of  conaolidated  five-year  and  annual  plans  of  the  production  of  local
					    	conetruction   	materials  and  the  manufacture  of  conaumer  ~oods  and  plans
					    	of  houaing-municipal  aervice  and  cultural-social  construction  and  also  with
					    	supervision  of  the  fulfillment  of  these  plans.    	The  plans  for  the  locaticm
					    	and  development  of  national  economy  sectors  under  the  ~urisdiction  of  union
					    	ministries  and  departments  are  elaborated  by  them  with  the  participation  of
					    	the  union  republic  councils  of  ministers  with  regard  for  the  observations
					    	of  the  autonomous  republic  councils  of  ministers  with  regard  for  the  obser-
					    	vations  of  the  sutonomous  republic  councils  of  min3~ters  and  local  soviet
					    	iapolkoms.    	A1.1  this  is  atriking  testimony  to  the  strengthening  of  union
					    	principles,  the  increase  role  of  the  union  and  autonomous  republics  in  in-
		 	_			  	suring  comprehensive  economic  and  social  development  on  their  territory
					    	and  the  broadening  of  the  republics'  participation  in  deciding  questions
					    	of  union  ~urisdiction.
					    	The  ~oint  efforta  of  the  Soviet  republics,  nationa  and  nationalities  within
					    	the  framework  of  a  unified  union  state  are  esaential  for  the  accomplishment
					    	of  all  the  tasks  of  atate,   	economic  and  sociocultural  building  and  for  pro-
					    	moting  the  rapprochement  and  further  prosperity  of  all  nations  and  national-
					    	ities.    	As  the  1977  Constitution  records,   	the  USSR  embodies  the  state  unity
					    	of  the  Soviet  people  and  rallies  all  the  nati~ns  and  nationalities  for  the
					    	~oint  building  of  com~unis~    	(article  70).    	Thua  the  strengthening  of  union
					    	statehood  is  inseparable  from  the  development  of  national  statehood.    	This
					    	is  a  single  process  of  the  perfection  of  Soviet  statehood.    	The  CPSU  Central
					    	Committee  decree  "Preparations  for  the  50th  Anniversaa-~  of  the  Formatic~
					   	of  ~he  USSR"  states  that  the  developed  socialist  society  which  has  been
					   	built  in  the  USSR  "insures  the  comprehensive  development  in  inseparable
					   	unity  of  union  statehood  and,the  natioaal  statehood  of  the  republics  on  the
					   	basis  of  the  principlea  of  democratic  centraliam  and  socialist  federalism  and
					   	Soviet  socialist  democracy...."   	Whence  it  follows  that  communist  building
					   	presuppnaes  the  further  perfection  of  national-state  building  in  the  USSR.
					   	The  Soviet  multinational  state  at  the  current  stage  is  developing  along  the
					   	path  of  the  intensification  and  extension  of  socialist  democracy  and  the
					   	enlistment  of  all  citizens--working  people  of  different  nations  and  nation-
					   	alities  of  the  country--in  administering  the  affairs  of  society  and  the  state.
					   	Being  the  embodiment  of  socialist  democracy,   	the  Soviet  federation  insures
					   	the  accomplishment  of  these  tasks.    	The  perfection  and  full  use  of  Soviet
					   	national  statehood  is  an  integral  part  of  communist  building.    	And,  move -
					   	over,   	a  guarantee  of  auccess  in  the  solution  of  the  problems  which  arise
					   	here  is  the  Soviet  union  state  and  the  fraternal  cooperation  and  mutual
					   	assiatance  of  all  the  peoples  of  our  country,  which  are  contributing  to				-
					   	rapprochement  and  the  strengthening  of  their  international  unity.				    	_
