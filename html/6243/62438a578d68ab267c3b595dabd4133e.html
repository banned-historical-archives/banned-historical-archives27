Soviets Protest Saigon Buildup 
By Jack Anderson 
Strictly speaking, the U.S. 
has not violated any under-
standing. Not until the shoot-
ing stops does the proposed 
agrbement call for a halt of 
military shipments (except for 
replacements) into South Viet-
natn. 
In an obvious effort to 
strengthen President Thieu's

goes into effect, the U.S. has

swamped Saigon with sup-
plies. The deliveries of war-
planes and helicopters, in par-
ticular, has transformed the 
South Vietnamese Air Force 
into one of the Worlds' largest, 
with a new total of 4850 air-
craft. 
The Soviets -have charged 
this violates the spirit of the 
truce negotiations. They point 
mit that the North Vietnamese 
can't match the sudden U.S. 
buildup and, therefore, have 
been placed at a last-minute

This has put the Soviets on 
the spot, since they gave Ha-

faith. The Soviets Also quietly 
pressured Hanoi to end the 
fighting. They went so far as 
to imply that Soviet military 
aid might be curtailed if the 
war drags on.

Hanoi to question the Soviet

U.S. Bribery?-It has been 
whispered around the White 
House that bribery was used 
to overcome President Thieu's 
opposition to a cease-fire. 
There is absolutely no indica-
tion he, was paid off, himself. 
But our sources have official 
knowledge that other South

suede Thicu to go along with 
the U.S. cease-fire agreemept, 
in Saigon. 
This sort of black-bag diplo- rector, James Miller, admitted 
mac yisn't exactly uncommon 
Our sources have heard 
Philip Habib, for one, tell pri-
vately how he bribed opposi-
tion leaders when he was the 
top political officer at the U.S. 
Embassy in Saigon in 1965-67. 
Now Ambassador in Seoul, Ha-
bib was heard to say he used 
to carry "a little black bag" in 
Saigon. "From that little black 
bag," he is quoted, "we bought 
out any opposition." While 
Henry Kissinger was trying to 
sell the cease-fire to Thieu, 
Habib left his post in Seoul 
for a rush trip to Saigon. A 
spokesman denies that bribery 
played any part in these Sai-
gon negotiations. He would 
say only that Habib flew to 
Saigon to discuss "Vietnamese 
matters" with Kissinger. Ha-
bib couldn't be reached for di-
rect comment. 
MUST Musn't-An impor-
tant scientist in the Manned 
Underseas Science and Tech-
nology Office, part of the 
Commerce Department, is also 
a principal officer of a com-
pany which furnishes MUST 
with midget submarines. 
MUST rents submersibles for 
undersea research. One of the 
half-dozen "science coordina-
tors," who participates in the 
decision on whether to rent a 
midget sub is Dr. Robert F. 
Dill. }Ie also happens to be a 
founder, director and major 
stockholder in General Ocean-
?graphics, a Newport Beach 
Calif., firm. MUST'S deputy di-
to us that he was aware of 
Dill's relationship with Gen-
eral Oceanographics but 
claimed Dill "exerted no un-
due influence" on decisions to 
rent the company's subs. Dr. 
Dill was unavailable for com-
ment. 
Naval Sabotage-Sabotage 
in the fleet has become so se-
rious that Navy security engi-
neers are studying ways of 
locking on the metal plates 
which cover inspection holes. 
Sailor saboteurs have removed 
the plates and thrown in dirt 
or metal shavings to foul gear 
boxes and other moving parts. 
The damage slows or stops the 
ships and costs thousands to 
repair.

Nixot,i Forces Accused of Dirty Tricks 
By Jack An erson 
en in power don't relish 
having their cozy relation-
ships exposed, and their 
sotace of money bared, and 
their errors and embarraSs-
ments publicized. 
is not surprising, there-,, 
fore that the Ncxon Mminis-
tration doesn't like this col-
umn. So the President's dirty 
trieks department tried to 
-play a few tricks bn us. 
e dirty tricks operation, 
Otherwise known as the "Of. 
fensive Security i'rogram ot 
tha Ninu Forces," was estab-
lished chiefly to bewitch and 
befoul Democratic presidential 
candidates. It was fundedout 
of a secret, fluctuating Repub-
lican slush fund. 
The Washington Post has 
charged that the dirty tricks 
included forging_phony letters 
to embarrass the Democrats, 
leaking false information to 
the press, tailing family mem-
bers of Democratic presiden-
tial candidates and throwing 
campaign schedules into dis-
array. 
The Watergate, incident?
hteaking into Democratic 
Filly headquarters, tapping 
party leaders' telephones and 
sUallrig_party documents?was 
part of this sor id operation. 
dirty tricks 
were piffled by Political opera-
tives and government gum-
shoes alike. Their objective 
aptarentlY was two fold (1) 
to discredit the column by 
errnining our crdibi1ity; 
and p' ghut o mar sources. 
A host of investigators par-
ticipated in the project. Gov-
ernment agents, watching 
through binoculars, from a 
twarpy knoll, staked ont my 
house. With walkie-talkies, 
they directed waiting govern-
ment security ears to tail me 
wherever I went. Sources in-
side the Justice Department 
,provided me with the descrip-
tictn.s , ancl license_ nurnhqs 
of the cars. So it didn't take 
long to locate them lurking in 
hiding places near my home. 
McCord's Report 
The President's campaign 
security chief, James W. Mc-
Cord Jr., joined in the inves-
tigation. In an "interim re-
port" to the White House, he 
accused Me of "close associa-
tion with the operating arm 
of the Democratic Party." 
Ironically, a Democratic Party 
spokesman later accused me 
of close association with Mc-
Cord's operation after we pub-
liShed an embarraising memo 
m party files. 
Sources inside the White 
House, meanwhile, warned us 
of attempts to discredit the 
column. Not long afterward, 
the Bureau of Narcotics and 
Dangerous Drugs called a 
press conference. We were 
tipped off that the bureau 
ld challenge our story 
about Thailand's great opium 
hoax. 
The Thai authorities 
considerable whoop-de-d00 
staged a million-di-311er opitlili 
burning to dramatize how they 
were cooperating with the U.S. 
crackdown on drugs. We re-
ported, however, that they 
really burned cheap fodder 
mixed with opium. 
Nixon aides went to elal3O-
rate lengths to knock the 
story down. They prepared 
pages of refutation for the 
press, set up a movie of the 
opium burning and produced 
an "expert" to testify how 
wrong we were. Not only 
narcotics officials but White 
House and Justice Department 
aides were involved in the 
arrangements.

Air Force Attack 
More recently, the Pentagon 
furnished the editors of Air 
Force Magazine with material 
for a blistering attack on us. 
They challenged our report 
about Air Force research on 
a laser beam that would ex-
plode the eyeballs of enemy 
soldiers at a distance of more 
than a mile. Blinded soldiers, 
research noted, would be 
of a burden to a fight-
g force than dead soldiers. 
We based our story on a 
copY Of the actual study, which 
speaks more than five times 
of the violent effects of laser 
beams on eyeballs. Twice, the 
'study cites "massive blast" 
effects; in another place, it 
tells of a "micro-explosion" in 
the eyes. The water fluids in 
the' eyes, adds the study, would 
"rise to about 100 degrees 
Centigrade" ? the boiling 
point. 
Although we had a copy of 
the' study, we also contacted 
two Air Force researchers at 
Wright- Patterson Air Force 
Base where the research was 
reviewed. They would confirm 
only that they had been in-
volved in classified research 
on laser weapons. 
Finally we located the phy.-
sician-researcher. Dr. Milton. 
Zaret, who directed the study. 
for the Air Force. To make 
sure our story was absolutely 
accurate, we read it back to 
him word-for-word. He sugges-
ted a few minor technical 
changes, which we made. 
After Air Force Magazine-
called our story false, we. 
reached editors Claude Witze 
and John Frisbee. The attack 
on us was written by Witze 
who admitted he had never-
seen the study he accused us 
of misrepresenting. He also. 
had never tried to reach the 
scientist who prepared it nor, 
for that matter, had he bother-
ed to seek our side of the 
story. 
"My understanding was that 
(the Pentagon version) was the 
whole package," said Witze. 
"I rely on them fairly heavily."

?gent Lin Piao began plotting with "a small 
hari,c1bal -nr sworn conspirators" to assassinate 
Mr. Mao and try to seize power, according to 
Premier Chou. No attempt was actually made 
on the party chairman's life, however. "He

respectability. 
Some foreign specialists accept the Lin Piao 
story, others are openly skeptical, while most 
suspend judgment. The skeptics question 
whether Lin would have plotted to kill as re-
vered a national figure as Chairman Mao or 
would have tried to flee to the Russians, whom 
he had been outspoken in denouncing in the 
past. They suggest that Lin Piao might have 
been pulled from his pinnacle of power by 
Chairman Mao, Premier Chou and other lead-
ers and, when he wouldn't go quietly, done 
away with. Then, they speculate, a group of his 
close followers might have tried to flee by air, 
were pursued over the Mongolian frontier and 
shot down. All this is pure speculation, of 
course. 
"What Puzzle?"

New Offensive??Privately, 
-rem Kissinger is optimistic 
ibout the prospects of a 
!ease-fire in Vietnam. Yet in-
tercepted messages indicate 
that North Vietnam is prepar-
ing for a renewed offensive. 
Our military intelligence has 
found no trace, however, that 
Russia hap replaced the tanks 
and artillery the North Viet-
namese lost in their spring of-
fensive. They were able last 
spring to sneak heavy hard-
ware into South Vietnam vir-
tually undetected. But the 
best available intelligence sug-
gests that both Russia and 
China have cut back military 
shipments to North Vietnam. 
Hanoi's military preparations, 
therefore, may be for a lim-
ited attack upon a political 
target, perhaps even Saigon it-
self. But no one really knows 
whether the guns will be si-
lenced or booming when the 
voters go to the polls on Nov. 7. 
Soft on Thieu?Hanoi may, 
be softening slightly on its 
arch enemy, President Thieu. 
In the secret truce talks, 
North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho 
has emphasized that the Saigon 
regime must be dismantled and 
replaced by a tripartite gov-
ernment dominated by neither 
side. But he has indicated that 
Saigon can choose anyone it 
wishes to the new government, 
that neither side should have 
a veto over the other's ap-
pointments. The implication is 
that Hanoi would not object if 
Saigon appointed the hated 
Thieu as a member of the tri-
partite government. 
Mao's Vow?China's supreme 
ruler, Mao Tse-tung, told visit-
ing Japanese Prime Minister 
Kakuei Tanaka fiercely that 
the Chinese would resist to

They contend that the detente 
has hurt China's cred41V

Soviet Shipments?A classi-
fied State Department analy-
sis charges that Israel's forays 
across her borders against the 
Palestinian guerrillas have 
given the Soviets a pretext for 
strengthening their foothold 
in Syria and Iraq. Military 
shipment have been sent not 
only to Syria and Iraq but to 
the Palestinian guerrillas di-
rectly. Contrary, to press re-
ports of a Soviet "airlift" to 
Syria, however, the airlift 
consisted of only four 
transport planes, which have 
ceased to make regular deliv-
eries. But the shipments, 
though no more than token 
military aid, have had the ef-
fect of strengthening Soviet 
bonds with the Arab hotheads. 
The analysis concludes, never-
theless, that Russia wouldn't 
likely risk war for Syria, Iraq 
or any other Arab country.

WAR RAINMAKING 
SUBJECT OF SUIT 
U.S. Said to Violate Patent 
in Indochina Project 
By ANTHONY RIPLEY 
Special to The New York Time. 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 ? In 
inuaicecl lawsuit fjjed 
hete?more_tban.....threa?seeeks 
aga??e. manufacturer of
equipment char,ges_that 
the United States is making rain 
Jn oc in with a device he 
leyepted. in violationfliis 
natent rights. 
Bernard A. Power, president 
of the Weather En gineering 
Corporation of Canada Ltd. and 
its United States subsidiary, 
Weather Engineering Corpora-
tion of America, estimated that 
1.9-million of the devices ? ex-
plosive canisters filled withsil-
ver iodide crystals ? had been 
produced for use in Southeast 
Asia. 
Secretary of Defense Melvin 
R. Laird told the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee on April 
18 that the Defense Department 
had not conducted any rainmak-
ing activitiesover North Viet-
nam. 
Second Denial by Laird 
On July 3, The New York 
times reported secret use of 
cloud-seeding over North Viet-
nam and South Vietnam and 
Laos, quoting both civilian and 
military sources in the Govern-
ment. 
Then, in a news conference 
July 6, Mr. Laird was again 
asked about any seeding opera-
tions. He repeated his denial 
concerning military operations 
over North Vietnam and de-
clined commenton the situa-
tion elsewhere. 
Mr. Power said by telephone 
from Montreal, that the com-
pany was seeking $95-million 
for "full recovery of profits" 
for the devices, which he said 
cost $50 each. 
Mr. Power said the estimate 
was based on the length of the 
monsoon seasons over Indo-
china and the size of the area 
Involved, which he said he 
thought was the Ho Chi 
Minh trail netwcirk. The 
use covered the period from 
1967 to present, he said. 
Tested in Newfoundland 
Mr. Power said that the 
three-pound explosive canister 
and the method of dropping it 
from a plane into the clouds 
was tested in a demonstration 
at Harmon Air Force Base in 
Newfoundland in November, 
1966, with military observers 
from Canada and the United 
States on hand. 
The suit contends that in Dec-
ember, 1966, the company of-
ficers got in touch with Walt 
W. Rostow, who at the time 
was Special Assistant to Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson. 
Mr. Rostow referred them to 
Cot Robert N. Ginsburgh of the 
Air Force, who at that time was 
on Mr. Rostow's staff. He is 
now a major general in charge 
of Air Force public informa-
tion. 
The suit alleges that Mr. 
Power and Dewitt S. Copp, 
Washington representative of 
the company met with Colonel 
Ginsburgh "and disclosed the 
details of a plan to close in-
filtration trails to South Viet-
nam while at the same time 
greatly reducing the loss of 
lives normally attendant with 
the conventional procedures of 
attempting to close the trails 
by bombing." 
That plan, the suit alleges, 
was to make the trails impass-
able through excessive rainfall. 
At the time they described 
their patented devices, exhibited 
models and discussed both tac-
tical and strategic use.

Sought Information 
In March, 1971, he said, he 
first heard that weather modi-
fication was being used in 
Southeast Asia in an article by 
Jack Anderson, the columnist, 
and decided to see if his device 
was involved. 
Since April, 1971, the suit 
alleges, the company has met 
with the General Counsel's of-
fice of the Defense Depart-
ment trying to work out the 
matter to no avail. 
"To date," the suit alleges, 
"the Department of Defense

The device itself is a paper-

The lanyard is attached to

By expelling Soviet forces 
from Egypt, Sadat had ma-
neuvered into position to get 
some concessions from Israel. 
Indeed, there were signals 
from Tel Aviv that Israel 
would be generous about re-
turning captured territory. 
The Israelis made it clear, 
however, that they intended 
to keep the strategic Golan 
Heights which they seized 
from Syria. The Syrians, 
therefore, would have noth-
ing to gain from a peace set-
tlement. 
Egypt and Syria are part-

confederation ,j3ut the Cen,-

secret reports from Dania's-
sus has Ouoted President 
Assad as making deroga.tory 
Kgruat ithautAlle_Egyptaris. 
Not long after the expul-
sion of the Soviets from 
Egypt, the Kremlin sent an 
urgent, hand-carried message 
to Assad. The message, ac-
cording to the CIA, warned 
that Syria couldn't afford to 
follow Egypt's example and 
strip the country of Soviet 
protection. This would leave 
Syria vulnerable to an Israeli 
attack, the message report-
edly declared. 
Not only did Assad heed 
the message and keep his So-
viet advisers, but he agreed ' 
to bring more Soviet military 
equipment and technicians 
into the country. 
The intelligence reports 
suggest that the Kremlin 
seeks to block an Egyptian-Is-
raeli accord?because it 
could only be arranged by 
U.S. mediation. This would 
increase American influence 
In the area and leave the So-
viets out in the cold. 
THE SOVIET overtures to 
Syria, incidentally, have also 
has a side effect upon Syri-
an-American relations. Pre-
viously, the Syrians had 
shown signs of wishing to im-
prove their relations with the 
United States. 
An intelligence report tells, 
for example, how the Syrians 
in July, 1969, communicated 
with U.S. Bureau of Narcotics 
and Dangerous Drugs 
(BNDD) agents in Beirut 
through an Italian diplomat 
that they would agree to a re-
sumption of cooperation with 
the United States on narcot-
ics matters. 
Subsequently, according to 
the classified document, "two 
visits to Damascus by BNDD 
agents were conducted cor-
dially and in exchange of in-
formation was initiated." 
America t dlOotiati 'Worn 
Abanon Ind Jordan were 
ilso allowed to travel in

), Maj. Richard Barrett, an 
assistant U.S. military at-
tache in Jordan, was arrested 
as he was driving through 
the Syrian countryside. 
And David McClintoch, 
chief of the political section 
at the U.S. embassy in Jor-
dan, was manhandled by Syr-
ian border guards when he 
tried to cross the border. He 
was turned back and had to 
be driven out of Syria in an 
Italian embassy car. 
Castro's Denial 
WE RECENTLY quoted 
Cuba's Prime Minister Fidel 
Castro as saying that Chile's 
President Salvador Allende 
was "physically spent" and 
that other Chilean leaders 
"live too well."

"Castro said he is worried

there is an ideological weak-

Aid Sought for Crusading T enn.Editor 
By Jack Anderson 
During the early morning 
hours of August 23, an arson-
ist set ablaze the two-story of-
fices of a Tennessee newspa-
per whose crusading editor, 
Dan Hicks Jr., had dared to 
print the truth about corrupt 
county politicians and law-
breaking bootleggers. 
It wasn't the first violence 
against Hicks since he took 
over the weekly Democrat in 
the small rural town of Madi-
sonville, Tenn., in 1967. He has 
been firebombed, shot at twice 
and assaulted by two hired 
hooligans. Equipment has 
been stolen out of his newspa-
per office. 
But the soft-spoken editor 
hasn't been intimidated. "If I 
have to print this newspaper 
elsewhere and drop it on this 
town from an airplane, I'll do 
it," he told us, 
Ever since John Peter Zen-
ger was thrown into a dun-
geon in 1735 for publishing a

'65 Reports on Outlook for War 
By U.S. Intelligence Community 
Section of Pentagon papers dealing with reports on outlook for Communists' 
activities, April 22, 1965. . .- of 
t.12.6J,Inited States intelligence  1111.? ? ??? ?? in 
analysts' explanation, which introduces comments by Adm. William F. Raborn 
flr JJLfl, rperniiveitigence. 
If present U.S. policies continue with-
out the introduction of large addi-
tional forces or increased U.S. air ef-
fort, the Communists are likely to hold 
to their existing policy of seeking vic-
tory in the local military struggle in 
South Vietnam. They will try to intensi-
'y that struggle, supporting it with 
tdditional men and equipment. At the 
et.rne time, D.R.V. air defenses will be 
trengthened through Soviet and per-
aps Chinese aid. 
If, however, the U.S. deepens its in-
olvement by increasing its combat role 
rid intensifying its air effort, the intel-
gence officers believed: 
. . . that the Vietcong, North Viet-
= and China would initially. . . try 
offset the new enemy strength by 
epping up the insurgency, reinforcing 
e Vietcong with the men and equip-
mt necessary. They would likely count 
time being on their side and try to 
rce the piecemeal engagement of U.S. 
ops under conditions which might 
g them down in jungle warfare, hop-
to present the U.S. with a de facto 
-rtition of the country. The Soviet 
Union . . . would almost certainly ac-
quiesce in a decision by Hanoi to inten-
sify the struggle. 
This lack of any real prospect of 
"give" on the enemy's part was also 
confirmed by Admiral Raborn, shortly 
after he had succeeded John McCone 
as Director of Central Intelligence. On 
the day of Raborn's swearing-in (April 
28), the President had given him a let-
ter from McCone which McCone had 
handed to the President as his last 
official act. The President had asked 
Raborn to prepare his own comments 
on McCone's views. Raborn's comments, 
circulated to Secretaries Rusk and Mc-
Namara on May 6, included the fol-
lowing: 
Our limited bombing of the North 
and our present groundrorce build-up 
in the South are not likely to exert 
sufficient pressure on the enemy to 
cause him to meet our present terms 
in the foreseeable future. I note very 
recent evidence which suggests that our 
military pressures are becoming some-
what more damaging to the eneray 
within South Vietnam, but I am inclined 
to doubt that this damage is increasing 
at a rate which will bring him quickly 
to the conference table. 
With particular reference to Mc-
Cone's recommendation that the U. S. 
add much heavier air action against 
the North to its planned combat force 
deployment to the South, Raborn indi-
cated his agreement, and expressed his 
belief that such an action would have 
the following consequences: 
The D.R.V. is, in my view, unlikely 
to engage in meaningful discussions at 
any time in coming months until U.S. 
air attacks have begun to damage or 
destroy its principal economic and mili-
tary targets. I thus concur with the 
U.S.I.B.'s judgment of 18 February 1965, 
that, given such U.S. punishment, the 
enemy would be 'somewhat more like-
ly' to decide to make some effort to 
secure a respite, rather than to intensify 
the struggle further and accept the con-
sequent risks. 
And then he added the following 
advice: 
Insofar as possible, we should try 
to manage any program of expanded 
bombings in ways which (1) would 
leave the D.R.V. an opportunity to ex-
plore negotiations without complete loss 
of face, (2) would not preclude any 
Soviet pressures on Hanoi to keep the 
war from expanding, and (3) would 
not suddenly produce extreme world 
pressures against us. In this connection, 
the timing and circumstances In which 
the bombings were extended northward 
could be of critical importance, partic-
ularly in light of the fact that there 
have been some indications of differing 
views between Moscow, Peiping and 
Hanoi. For example, it would probably 
be advantageous to expand bombings 
after, not before, some major new VC 
move (e.g., obvious concentration for 
imminent attack on Da Nang or Kon-
tum) and after, not before, any current 
possibilities of serious negotiations have 
been fully tested. And such bombings 
should not be so regular as to leave 
no interval for the Communists to make 
concessions with some grace. Indeed, 
we should keep in mind the possibility 
of a pause at some appropriate time, 
which could serve to test the Communist 
intentions and to exploit any differ-
ences on their side.

Secretary of State Dean Rusk, left, acrid Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the 
Soviet Union at the Soviet mission here in 1967. When they conferred in Vienna in 
May, 1965, Mr. Gromyko told Mr. Rusk Soviet Union "will not negotiate about Vietnam." 
June of 1964 through J. Blair 
Seaborn, the Canadian member 
of the International Control 
Commission for Vietnam, and in 
the first bombing pause, for 
five days in May of 1965, which 
was code-named Mayflower by 
the State Department. 
On June 18, 1964, more 
than six months before the first 
air attacks on the North, Mr. 
Seaborn orally conveyed a 
message from the Johnson Ad-
ministration to Premier Pham 
Van Dong of North Vietnam, ac-
cording to the history. The 
message said, according to the 
Pentagon account, that the 
United States was determined 
to preserve a non-Communist 
South Vietnam and threatened 
North Vietnam with "the great-
est devastation" if Hanoi did 
not halt the Vietcong guerrilla 
rebellion in the South and if the 
conflict intersified. 
The Pentagon history says 
that Premier Dong "laughed 
and said he did indeed appre-
ciate the problem." He is re-
ported to have replied that 
while North Vietnam "will not 
provoke the U. S.," apparently 
through overt-intervention, 
Hanoi would continue to sup-
port the Vietcong and "We 
shall win." 
He is reported to have pro-
posed as a "just solution" an 
American withdrawal from the 
South and the creation of a 
neutral regime there in accord-
ance with the publicly an-
nounced program of the 
Vietcong. 
Dean Rusk, who was then 
Secretary of State, is shown to 
have reflected Washington's 
attitude of no compromise on 
its essential demands in a con-
versation with the Soviet Am-
bassador, Anatoly F. Dobrynin, 
on May 11, 1965, at the outset 
of the Mayflower bombing 
pause. 
Mr. Rusk noted, in a cable-
ram relating the conversation, 
which the Pentagon historians 
quote, that Mr. Dobrynin asked 
seems to have caused, despite 
the constant hope of Washing-
ton that the pressure would 
force Hanoi to compromise its 
basic objective, is strikingly 
evident in remarks attributed to 
Premier Dong in conversation 
with two French scientists in 
July, 1967, when the bombing 
was at its height. 
The two scientists, Herbert 
Marcovich and Raymond Au-
brac?Mr. Aubrac was a friend 
of the late President Ho Chi 
Minh?went to Hanoi as inter-
mediaries for the Johnson Ad-
ministration. Their mission was 
arranged and supervised by 
Henry A. Kissinger, then a Har-
vard professor and now Presi-
dent Nixon's adviser on na-
tional security. 
U.S. Power Acknowledged 
if the pause meant "any change 
in the fundamental U S.posi-
tion." 
"I replied that it did not and 
that this should be no sur-
prise," Mr. Rusk is said to have 
written. The Soviet Union then 
refused to deliver to the North 
Vietnamese a secret message 
that amounted to an ultimatum 
to call off the Vietcong and 
withdraw fro mSouht Vietnam 
or face more American bomb-
ing. 
The stiffening of the North 
Vietnamese determination that 
the escalation of the bombing 
The message they carried to 
Hanoi was essentially the same 
as the earlier ones. 
Premier Dong is quoted as 
having replied that Hanoi knew 
that "U.S. power is enormous 
and the U.S. Government wants 
to win the war. 
"President Johnson is suffer-
ing from a pain and this pain is 
called South Vietnam," he went 
os. "Therefore we think that at-
tacks on the North are likely to 
increase. We have made provi-
sions for attacks on our dikes; 
we are ready to accept war on 
our soil. Our military potential 
is growing because of aid from 
the U.S.S.R. and other socialist 
countries." 
"Now I shall talk to you 
about negotiations and solu-
tions," Premier Dong is said to 
have continued. "We have been 
fighting for our independence 
for 4,000 years. We have de-
feated the Mongols three times. 
The United States Army, strong 
as it is, is not as terrifying as 
Genghis Khan." 
He again replied to Wash-
ington that the solution for the 
United States was to withdraw 
from South Vietnam and permit 
the establishment of a neutral 
regime there, according to the 
history. 
"To theextent they believed 
each other, the two sides were 
amply forewarned that  a pain-
ful contest lay ahead," the 
Pentagon historians write in 
Approved For Release 2001/11/01 : CIA-RDP74600415R000300020019-3 
their opening chapter on the 
secret diplomacy. "Even so, 
they were not inclined to com-
promise their way out. 
"They held very different 
estimates of the efficacy of 
U.S. military might. We thought 
its pressures could accomplish 
our goals. The Communists did 
not."

He would would withhold the 
bombs for awhile, hoping this 
would encourage the North Vi-
etnamese to negotiate. Then 
he would let the bombs fly 
again when he thought they 
needed some prodding. 
Sometimes, he stepped up 
the bombing at crucial stages 
of the secret negotiations. Re-
peatedly, Hanoi would halt the 
talks because of the military 
pressure. 
After his retirement, Presi-
dent Johnson published selec-
tive excerpts from the secret 
papers to demonstrate how 
right and reasonable he had 
been. He omitted the , por-
tions that made him look 
wrong and unreasonable. 
President Nixon also re-
leased sensitive information, 
strictly for political reasons, 
about Henry Kissinger's se-
cret Vietnam negotiations.

Not only does the govern-

crecy labels. But our entire 
foreign policy and defense 
posture remains secret except 
for what the federal establish-
ment thinks is in its own inter-

The tragic, bitter lessons of 
Vietnam have shown the fate-
ful consequences of allowing 
any president to exercise 
power in spendid isolation be-
hind the double walls of exec-
utive privilege and official se-
crecy. 
We will continue, therefore, 
to publish information that 
the government seeks to hide 
from the public by classifying. 
Soviet Role 
The unpublished Pentagon 
Papers, for example, shed new 
light on the Soviet role in the 
Vietnam negotiations: The 
Kremlin, after showing no in-
terest In settling the war, sud-
denlradopted a different atti-
tude In 1967. Soviet Premier 
Alexei Kosygin made the new 
attitude known during a Lon-
don visit. 
"The British were first star-
tied, then delighted to find 
Kosygin eager to play an ac-
tive role as intermediary be-
tween the U.S. and Hanoi 
?" state the papers. "There 
was definitely a sharp change 
from previous Soviet reluc-
tance to play the middle-
man. . . . 
"What produced this change 
in Soviet attitudes? Were they 
acting on DRV (North Vi-
etnamese) behest? Or were 
they now willing to put pres-
sure on Hanoi in pursuit of 
their own? 
"Only a little light is shed 
on these questions by the ma-
terials relating to Kosygin's 
stay in London. He was appar-
ently willing to transmit pro-
posals for DRY consideration 
more or less uncritically. 
While he argued the general 
merits of the DRV's side of 
the war, he did not try to bar-
gain or alter specifics of the 
proposals transmitted to 
him. . . . 
"What is more striking is 
that he did not reactlidversely 
to the substance of the princi-
pal de-escalatory proposal 
under discussion?the termi-
nation of all DRS, infiltration 
and supply into SVN in ex-
change for a U.S. halt on at-
tacks on the .North and in 
troop level augmentation. 
Intercepted Call 
"Entirely apart from the se-
quence in which these steps 
would be taken, their long-
term result for- th 
piste would be extremely ad-
verse militarily. Yet on Feb. 
la, he was overheard (by tele-
Phone intercept) to tell Brezh-
nett (the Communist Party 
chief) of 'a great possibility of 
achieving the aim, if the Viet-
namese will understand the 
present situation that we have 
passed to them; and they will 
have to decide...' 
"In a retrospective discus-
sion with Thompson (then the 
U.S. Ambassador) in Moscow, 
Kosygin expressed a jaun-
diced view of the rule of me-
diators, saying they either 
complicated the problem or 
pretended they were doing 
something when in fact they 
were not. 
"He had stepped into this 
uncomfortable spot in London 
because 'the Vietnamese had 
for the first time stated they 
were ready to negotiate if the 
bombings were stopped uncon-
ditionally; this was the first 
time they had done so....' 
"How much the Russians 
had hoped in fact to accom-
plish during Kosygin's Lon-
don trip is impossible to 
know. They apparently har-
bored few expectations after 
his return. Kosygin complain-
ed to Thompson about the 
'ultimatum' implied in the 
final proposal he transmitted 
to Hanoi from London, saying 
that he knew it was hopeless 
the minute he read it. . . ?" 
This incident illustrates how 
little influence the Kremlin 
had over the North Vietnam-
ese. It was the beginning, how-
ever, of an increased Soviet in-
terest in ending the Vietnam 
War.

in 
s ? ? ,IrTionMait 
? ? ? ?V . Here are 
the lessons, whic seemed to 
us to be the most compelling; 
Lesson No. 1?Ex-President 
Lyndon Johnson orchestrated 
the bombing of North Vietnam 
in careful synchronization 
with the peace negotiations. 
He alternately suspended and 
escalated the bombing in an 
effort to influence the negotia-
tions. Invariably, this seemed 
to produce the opposite effect 
in Hanoi than Mr. Johnson had 
intended. Yet President Nixon 
is now using the same strat-
egy. 
Lesson No. 2?The North Vi-
etnamese, whether on the bat-
tlefield or at the peace table, 
never lost sight of their ulti-
mate goal; control of all Viet-
nam. As the unpublished pa-
pers put it, "Who shall govern 
SVN is what the war is all 
about." 
Lesson No. 3?With a pa-
tience unknown in the West, 
the Hanoi leaders are pre-
pared to ?await and outlast 
all enemies. "We have been 
fighting for our independence 
for 4,000 years," Premier 
Pham Von Dong told interme-
diaries who approached him in 
1967 with a peace offer. "We 
have defeated the Mongols 
three times. The united States 
Army, strong as it is, is not Is 
terrifying as Genghis Khan." 
Lyndon Johnson's game of 
now-we-bomb-now-we-don't, ac-
cording to the peace papers, 
repeatedly backfired. 
An exchange of peace mes-
sages through the Poles, for 
example, ended abruptly with 
the bombing of Hanoi on Dec. 
13-14, 1966. Soviet Ambassador 
Anatoly Dobrynin later re-
viewed with Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk why the contact 
had been broken off. "The 
bombing was just before that 
date," Dobrynin explained Ha-
noi's response, "meaning the 
U.S. thought it could pressure 
Hanoi to talk." 
The papers quote a Soviet 
diplomat as saying the North 
Vietnamese regarded bombing 
of their homeland as an effort 
"to get Hanoi to talk." The re-
fusal to talk while the bombs 
were dropping, he Said, "was a 
direct response" to the U.S. 
position. 
Nevertheless, President 
Nixon has now stepped up the 
bombing again as a means of 
wringing concessions out of 
the Hanoi leadership. But he, 
too, is finding the North Viet-
namese fiercely stubborn. 
Their attitude is expressed in 
a secret quotation from Pre-
mier Pham Van Dong. 
"President Johnson is suf-
fering from a pain, and this 
pain is called South Vietnam," 
the North Vietnamese Premier 
told peace emissaries in 1967. 
"We agree that the situation 
on the battlefield is decisive; 
the game is being played in 
South Vietnam. 
"From the newspapers we 
see that some people want to 
confine the war to the South. 
However, the White House 
and the Pentagon seem deter-
mined to continue the war 
against the North. Therefore, 
we think that attacks on the 
North are likely to increase. 
'We have made provisions 
for attacks on our dikes; we 
are ready to accept war on our 
soil. Our military potential is 
growing because of aid from 
the USSR and other Socialist 
countries.... 
"We fight only when we 
choose; we economize on our 
resources; we fight only for 
political purposes." 
The lessons outlined in the 
unpublished Pentagon Papers 
should be studied carefully by 
those who still are seeking 
peace in Vietnam.

Concern Over Environment 
The disclosure comes at a 
time of mounting concern 
among some scientists and Gov-
ernment officials that years of 
defoliation, bombing and burn-
ing have inflicted irreversible 
I damage on the Vietnamese en-
vironment. Only _recently was 
it??diaclusaLtimt the United 
The target of the fire storm 
efforts were rare and desirable 
mahogany trees that many for-
estry experts consider a poten-
tially valuable resource for the 
Vietnamese economy. 
Had the burning succeeded, 
according to interviews with a 
number of experts on tropical 
vegetation, the trees would 
probably have been destroyed, 
replaced possibly by less useful 
bamboo and other coarse vege-
tation. 
One military officer familiar 
with the project defended it 
on strategic grounds. Saying 
that the areas?War Zones C 
and D in Tayninh and Long-
khanh Provinces? were Viet-
cong staging areas, he asked, 
"When you're fighting a war, 
do you want to save trees 
or lives?" 
At the same time that the 
American foresters were trying 
to set forest fires, other United 
States Forest Service special-
sts were at work helping to 
mild Vietnam's primitive log-
;ing industry and to improve 
imber management techniques,

'cr International Development.

Interviews with fire experts 
suggest that the project was ill-
fated from the outset. "No way 
?too wet," remarked William 
R. Beaufait, a Forest Service 
expert in the setting of pre-
scribed fires to control timber 
forests, in his office here. 
Fire storms are a fearsome 
and little understood phenome-
non. A fire storm, unlike an 
ordinary conflagration, packs 
tremendous energy. It sucks in 
air from all around, creating a 
convection column and mighty 
whirlwinds. What results re-
sembles a cyclone and it is cap-
able of ripping out bridges and 
300-foot trees like matchsticks. 
Its demand for oxygen is such 
that people in the area perish 
from asphyxiation: this oc-
curred during the Allies' World 
War II bombings of Dresden 
and Hamburg, in which more 
than 200,000 died 
Although the methods of 
starting and controlling fire 
storms are not well understood, 
the foresters were asked to ad-
vise the military on the best 
conditions ? in terms of sea-
son, wind, rainfall, tempera-
ture, moisture content of vege-
tation and other factors. Civil-
ians in Vietnam during the pe-
riod from 1965 to 1967 report 
having seen Forest Service per-
sonnel at the Advanced Proj-
ects Research Agency com-
pound in Saigon. 
White House Role Unclear 
It could not be learned if 
the project nad the approv 
of President Johnson, but ac 
cording to a former high-rank-
ing military officer, "The pro 
cedure was to get clearanc 
from the White House on any-
thing like this?' 
A forestry contingent, work-
ing under contract to the r 
search agency, was believed t 
include Craig Chandler, now in 
Washington as director of for-
est-fire research for the Forest 
Service, and Robert W. Mach, 
a scientist at the fire laboratory 
here who has studied the mech-
anisms of fire spreading and 
the relationship of wildland 
fires to ecological systems. 
Mr. Chandler was formerly 
with the Pacific Southwest sta-
tion in Berkeley, Calif., which 
participated in fire storm ex-
periments in the early nineteen-
sixties. He acknowledged that 
he had been to Vietnam, but 
referred questions about his 
functions there to the Pentagon. 
A document that is still se-
cret is believed to contain the 
details of some of the early 
work by the foresters. It is 
titled "Forest Fire Research?
Final Report, Phase I, Volume 
1, U. S. Department of Agri-
culture, Forest Service. ARPA 
Order Number 818. January, 
1966." 
The burning was necessari-
ly keyed to the dry season in 
South Vietnam which lasts 
roughly from January to April. 
The target was what botanists 
call a double-canopied tropical 
rain forest. Double-canopied 
means that there are two levels 
of vegetation, the upper being 
the tops of tall mahogany trees, 
called Dipterocarpus, and the 
lower being smaller bushes and 
trees. Such a cover provides 
effective concealment for 
troops, but the area is not oth-
erwise inhabited. 
Spraying With Herbicides 
Although the forest is wet 
even in the 4:1Ty season, the 
foresters theorized that they 
could create enough fuel for 
burning by first killing the 
leaves by spraying with chem-
ical herbicides. This task was 
carried out by Operation Ranch 
Hand, the 9ir Force code name 
for the defoliation operations. 
The incendiaries were dropped 
by other Air Force planes. 
The burning project was de-
scribed by a former command-
er of Ranch Hand, Lieut. Col. 
Arthur F. McConnell Jr., in an 
article he wrote in 1970 for 
the Air University Review. The 
article was heavily censored, 
but an uncut draft has been 
obtained by The New York 
Times. 
According to Colonel McCon-
nell, the first burning, Oper-
ation. Sherwood Forest, was 
tried early in 1965. He 
described it as "a massive at-
tempt to burn out a defoliated 
section of the Boiloi Woods 
in the hopes of denying the 
enemy an extremely vital base 
camp area." 
"For the next year," Colonel 
McConnel contnued, "several 
fire storm projects similar to 
the BoiLoi Woods effort were 
made in conjunction with the 
Vietnamese Air Force. While 
the attempts to ignite the de-
foliated area met with limited 
success, the effect of the de-
foliant itself significantly im-
proved visibility for observa-
tion." 
Flew 225 Sorties 
In support of the final fire 
storm effort in April, 1967, he 
wrote, his squadron flew "ap-
proximately 225 sorties and de-
livered over a quarter-million 
gallons of herbicides on se-
lected target areas in War 
Zones C and D." 
According to other sources, 
the undergrowth was ignited, 
but the fire did not spread to 
the 70-foot high upper canopy. 
Since this third and final at-
tempt was carried out under 
the most favorable conditions, 
the project was abandoned as 
unfeasible.

of a small river about 15 
miles cast of this northern 
district capital lipq a sporat

known as Camp Saritsana. 
Near the point where 
had been told to turn off 
the road to find the camp, 
a Thai waitress in a small 
restaurant said that there 
were usually about 1,000 
Thai soldiers at the site, 
but that most had just left. 
She also told me that 10 or 
15 Americans were station-
ed there, and that planes 
landed on an average of 
five times a day. 
As I walked along the 
river away from the high-
way, the whine of diesel 
generators guided me until 
I saw several concrete and 
wooden buildings, a 100-foot-
high water tower, and a 
generator shed. Further up, 
a steel suspension bridge 
carried truck traffic across 
the river. The scene re-
minded me of places where 
I had served in Vietnam 
and Thailand.

told him I had once served 
with the U.S. Special Forces 
in Thailand and just wanted 
to talk with some Americans 
on the base, he said, "Sure, 
come on." One of the 
guards got on the back of 
my motorcycle and we drove 
to headquarters. 
The 50-acre site is divid-
ed roughly in the middle by 
an airstrip. Heavy woods 
surround the base. Ten bar-
racks for Thai soldiers were 
on the left side of the en-

the grounds were 41 Thai spe-

jump tower and cable rig for

U.S. Said to Break All of Soviet's Codes 
By BENJAMIN WELLES 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, July 15?The 
United States is reported to 
have refined its electronics in-
telligence techniques to the 
point where it can break Soviet 
codes, listen to and understand 
Soviet communications and 
coding systems and keep track 
of virtually every Soviet jet 
piano or missile-carrying sub-
marine around the world. 
"We're able to break every 
code they've got," a former 
analyst in the National Secu-
rity Agency, one of the most 
secret of the Government's 
many intelligence agencies, is 
quoted as saying in the August 
issue of Ramparts magazine, 
which is published by Noah's 
Ark, Inc., 2054 University Ave-
nue, Berkeley, Calif. 
The former analyst, whose 
name was not given in the arti-
cle, was an Air Force staff ser-
geant who was discharged from 
military service in 1969 after 
three years of overseas duty as 
a communications traffic ana-
lyst for the agency in Turkey, 
West Germany and Indochina. 
He uses the pseudonym of 
Winslow Peck in the article 
Some Corroboration Found 
Mr. Peck, who is 25 years 
old, was recently interviewed 
by a correspondent of The New 
York Times in California. Ex-
tensrve likeleppident checking 
in Washington with sources in 
and out of the Government who 
were familiar ,with intelligence 
roboration of many of his reve-
lations. But experts strongly 
denied that the United States 
had broken the sophisticated 
codes of the Soviet Union or of 
other foreign powers. 
The national security agency 
headquarters is at Fort Meade, 
near Baltimore. It has nearly 
100,000 employes ? most of 
them military personnel ? and 
spends slightly less than $1-
billion a year. Unlike the Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency, the 
N.S.A.'s primary purpose is the 
collection of information?most, 
of it through advanced tech-
nology ? but it rarely, if ever, 
tries to evaluate the importance 
of the information or analyze 
it. 
The Ramparts article says that 
matters has resulted in the cor- Continued on Page 3, Column 1

the United States has encircled 
the Communist world with at 
least 2,000 electronic listening 
posts on land or on naval ves-
sels or aircraft. 
United States electronically 
equipped aircraft, according to 
the article, are constantly pene-
trating the air space of the 
Soviet Union, China and other 
Communist countries to pro-
voke and record their radar 
and signal techniques to de-
velop countermeasures against 
them. 
This claim has been chal-
lenged here by independent 
Government intelligence ex-
perts, who said that there have 
been no authorized, as distinct 
from inadvertent, violation of 
Soviet or Chinese airspace by 
the United States since the U-2 
flights of the early nisiteen-
sixties. The experts said that 
satellite photography has re-
placed aerial overflights, con-
ceding, however, that United 
States electronic intelligence 
planes often fly along Commun-
ist borders to provoke reaction 
and collect signals. 
In the California interview, 
which was recorded on tape, 
Mr. Peck described his early 
life in Joplin, Mo., his enlist-
ment in the Air Force in 1966 
when he was 20 years old, 
his subsequent recruitment by 
the security agent, his special-
ized training, his promotions 
and his three years of duty 
overseas. He was discharged 
in California in November, 
1969, and says he turned down 
a $10,000-a-year job offer by 
the Central Intelligence Agen-
cy. He decided-instead, he says, 
to work to end the Vietnam 
war. 
Tells of TV Monitoring 
A highlight of Mr .Peck's dis-
closures include a report that 
in 1967 during his duty in 
Turkey the agency monitored 
a live Soviet television contact 
between Premier Aleksei N. 
Kosygin, who was in tears bid-
ding an emotional farewell to 
the astronauts Vladimir M. 
Komarov. 
Mr. Komarov was then in 
orbit in the spacecraft Soyuz 
I, which was still two hours 
from re-entry into the earth's 
atmosphere. According to Mr. 
Peck's account the astronaut 
h.td just been informed by 
Soviet ground control thatt he 
braking parachutes designed to 
bring his spacecraft safely to 
earth were malfunctioning and 
that there was no hope of 
saving him. 
Soyuz 1 crashed on Soviet 
territory on April 25, 1967, and 
Mr. Komarov was killed. He 
was posthumously granted a 
second Order of Hero of the 
Soviet Unoin and is buried in 
the Kremlin walls. 
Mr. Peck also said that dur-
ing the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, 
the United States electronic in-
telligence ship, the Liberty, 
was ordered near the Israeli 
coast to intercept details of 
Israeli military intentions. 
The ship was attacked on 
June 8, 1967, by Israeli jet air-
craft and torpedo boats?an 
incident that cost 34 United 
States dead and 75 wounded 
and which President Lyndon B. 
Johnson later described in his 
book, "The Vintage oPint," as 
a "heart-breaking episode." Be-
fore the attack, he said, the 
Liberty learned that General 
Moshe Dayan, the Israeli De-
fense Minister, intended to 
order his forces on to Damas-
cus and Cairo. 
Tells of Johnson Pressure 
? Mr. Peck stated that Presi-
dent Johnson then brought in-
tense pressure on Israel to halt 
further troop movement and 
warned Premier Kosygin on the 
"hot line" against what ap-
peared to be an imminent So-
viet airborne operation from 
bases in Bulgaria against Israel. 
Intelligence sources here said 
they were unable to recall these 
details but a veteran of 30 
years service in intelligence 
said of Mr. Peck: 
"He's obviously familiar with 
N.S.A.?its organization, opera-
tions and many of its tech-
niques. But no sergeant in his 
early twenties would know how 
intelligence is handled at the 
White House level, what N.S.A. 
material is used or discarded 
by the President or more than 
just the fringes about C.I.A. 
operations." 
During his year of duty in 
Vietnam, from November, 1968, 
to October, 1969, Mr. Peck, 
said, he participated in airborne 
electronic sweeps in Thailand 
in support of C.I.A. operations. 
The C.I.A., he said, was using 
unmarked attack bombers 
flown by C.I.A. "spookies" and 
based at Udorn to punish Meo 
tribesmen who had clashed 
with Thai Government troops 
over control of their traditional 
areas. 
The United States depended 
on a friendly Thai Government 
for important air bases and 
other facilities useful for the 
Vietnam war, Mr. Peck noted, 
and thus was prepared to as-
sign the C.I.A. surreptitiously 
to help the Thai Government 
suppress internal disorders. 
Neither the N.S.A. nor the 
C.I.A. would comment today. 
Senior Government intelli-
gence officials who were shown 
transcripts of the Peck inter-
view discounted parts of it but 
corroborated others. 
David Kahn, author of "The 
Codebreakers," (published by 
Macmillan in 1967) and a lead-
ing authority on cryptoanalysis, 
said in a telephone interview 
that the Ramparts article "rep-
resents much new information 
that rings true to me and seems 
correct." However, he chal-
lenged some points, specifically 
Mr. Peck's assertion that the 
agency's experts are able to 
"break every Soviet code with 
remarkable success." 
Top-grade Soviet Foreign 
Ministry code systems "have 
been unbreakable since the 
nineteen thirties" Mr. Kahn 
said. He added that it was 
"highly unlikely that they have 
switched to breakable codes." 
Mr. Peck's contention that 
"information gathered by N.S.A. 
is complete" implies a false 
importance, Mr. Karin said. The 
N.S.A. does, he said, "solve" 
many nations' diplomatic codes; 
but these are countries of the 
third rank and provide only 
"indirect clues to Communist 
intentions." 
Mr. Kahn noted that "what 
we are doing in this field the 
Russians are doing and, con-
trary tot he Ramparts state-
ment, they are very good." 
He pointed out finally that 
the "thrust of the article, that 
the N.S.A. threatens peace, is 
incorrect." 
"I believe that in the existing 
world of two armed camps," 
Mr. Kahn said, "N.S.A. can pro-
vide more light, more truth?
and this can lead to better 
evaluation of situations and so 
to more realistic responses. 
N.S.A. is not like the C.I.A., 
which can foment revolutions 
and can indeed threaten peace." 
The interview contains a 
lengthy question-and-answer 
passage that Mr. Peck con-
ceded, in his interview with 
The Times, was hurriedly pre-
pared at a time when he was 
"extremely rattled." 
details of hitherto suspected 
but obscure details of elec-
tronic eavesdropping around 
the globe resulted, he said, 
from opposition to the Vietnam 
War and from a hope that 
others doing similar clandes-
tine Government work would 
"come forward and say what 
they know. "He concedes that 
his disclosures about the 
agency may involve him in 
legal tangles. 
"I know the FBI knows who 
I am," he said recently. "I'd 
like to avoid publicity but I'm 
willing to go through trial and, 
if I have to, I'll go to jail. I 
don't like the idea of going 
to jail. It scares me. But I no 
longer feel the oath that I 
made when I was released 
from duty to never say any-
thing about what I did is bind-
ing on me." 
No Comment From Admiral 
Senior agency officials, in-
cluding Vice Adm. Noel Gayler, 
the director, are reportedly 
highly disturbed by Mr. Peck's 
interview. The agency is part 
of the Defense Department. 
Admiral Gayler, who has been 
named commander in chief of 
the Pacific Fleet after three 
years as director of the agency, 
is to be succeeded in a month 
by Lieut. Gen. Samuel C. Phil-
lips, an Air Force space spe-
cialist. Direction of the agency 
is normally rotated among the 
three armed services. 
Neither Admiral Gayler nor 
Defense Department officials

Nixon. Brezhnev Can Be Trusted 
1 
By Jack Anderson 
No transcript was kept of 
the face-to-face meetings be-
twen President Nixon and So-
viet party chief Leonid Brezh-
nev in the Kremlin. 
As an act of trust, the Presi-
dent didn't even bring his own 
interpreter into ?the confer-
ence room but accepted Brezh-
nev's 
After each session, Mr. 
Nixon methodically tran-
scribed his recollections of the 
discussion. His personal notes 
constitute the only U.S. record 
of the historic Nixon-Brezhnev 
talks. 
From a source with access 
to these notes, here are some 
of the highlights: 
On the eve? of the Moscow 
meeting, the strategic arms 
limitation talks were still 
snagged in Helsinki over So-
viet unwillingness to halt con-
struction of missile-carrying 
submarines. But the President, 
alone with Brezhnev, leaned 
forward and said: "Dammit, 
let's settle it." 
Then they hammered out 
the important agreement to 
limit nuclear weapons. At one 
point, Mr. Nixon jokingly sug-
gested that Russia could sub-
stitute its mammoth SS-9 mis-
siles for submarines, since the 
new monster missiles resem-
ble submarines in both size 
and shape. 
"How do you know?" de-
manded Brezhnev gruffly. For 
r,ussia has tried to keep its 
ls secret from the world. 
The Prpstdent renlied  that 
Vez....Ln_ty. as well be Mk 
ith on7T?T6tItV7p-
nn. since ild-61-50-ex-
cglleat...121elligeace.. Perhaps, 
he said, the Soviets might 
wish to mount SS-9s on their 
submarines. 
"This would sink the sub-
marines," snorted Brezhnev. 
"That is exactly what I had 
in mind," cracked Mr. Nixon. 
The President found Brezh-
nev to be a hearty host but a 
hard negotiator. In the end, 
however, Mr. Nixon concluded 
that "the man can be trusted." 
Peace Code 
Perhaps even more impor-
tant than the nuclear arms 
agreement, in the President's 
opinion, was a 12-point pact 
"to remove the threat of war" 
and "to promote reduction of 
tensions in the world." He 
felt this codified the new 
Soviet-American relationship 
and established the rules for 
avoiding future military con-
frontations. 
The pact was proposed by 
the Russians and resisted at 
first by Mr. Nixon. He 
changed his mind, however, 
and decided it could be an in-
strument for peace. He per-
sonally drafted the 12 points 
between sessions in Moscow, 
and Brezhnev accepted most 
of the President's language. 
Mr. Nixon drove himself re-
lentlessly in Moscow, averag-
ing only three to five hours of 
sleep the first six nights, as he 
followed the endless hours of 
bargaining with meticulous 
notetaking and painstaking 
preparations for the next ses-
sion. 
He was bouyed by his suc-
cess and left Moscow ex-
hausted but exhilarated. He 
told aides jubilantly that he 
felt more confident than ever 
of an enduring peace. The 
Moscow meeting, he genuinely 
felt, had made the world a 
safer place. 
During a subsequent visit to 
a Leningrad castle, the guide 
showed the President some 
trick mirrors and a spot where 
the acoustics made a few hand 
pats sound like great ap-
plause. Mr. Nixon gleefully 
made funny faces at himself 
in the mirrors, then he an-
nounced: "I am going to ap-
plaud myself." 
He patted his hands and 
beamed happily when the 
magnified applause roared 
back. 
Footnote: Even Andrei 
Grechko, the dour Soviet de-
fense minister who reportedly 
had opposed the Nixon visit, 
warmed up to the Presi-
dent. While Mr. Nixon was 
standing at attention for the 
Soviet honor guard, he felt a 
tap on his shoulder. It was 
Grechko, who made a good-
humored crack about the 
marching soldiers. 
WASHINGTON WHIRL 
Chaotic Society?President 
Nixon has told subordinates 
that he still believes in fiscal 
responsibility and will return 
to a tight budget immediately 
after the election. He will 
begin, he suggested, by cutting 
ex-President Lyndon John-
son's Great Society programs. 
Mr. Nixon has already drafted " 
a list of 110 federal programs 
that he believes should be re-
pealed or, at least, turned over 
to local governments He will 
charge that the programs were 
hastily conceived and poorly 
administered. He also intends 
to warn, in effect, that the 
Great Society will wind up in-
stead as a Chaotic Society, 
with the workers taxed be-
yond endurance. 
Headlines and Footnotes?
President Nixon's fund raisers 
have drafted a blacklist whose 
campaign contributions will 
be turned down. The list in-
cludes shady operators and 
former donors who demanded 
too much for their money... 
The President's foreign policy 
czar, Henry Kissinger, is qui-
etly promoting New York's 
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller for 
Secretary of State .. . Admiral 
Hyman Rickover; the crusty 
father of the nuclear subma-
rine, has never given a hang 
for naval starch and dress. 
The other day, he wore civil-
ian clothes ventilated by a 
gaping tear in his pants.

U.S. Moves May Reunite Russia, China 
By Jack Anderson 
There Is evidence in the se-
cret U.S. cable traffic that 
President Nixon's military 
moves in Vietnam may be 
driving the two great Commu-
nist antagonists, Russia an 
China, back together. 
We have been able to trace 
the dismaying developments 
I through secret documents, 
which the White House has 
carefully withheld from both 
Congress and the public. 
These documents show that 
the Kremlin reacted to the 
Chinese-American rapproche-
ment by making Its own secret 
overtures to Peking last Au-
gust. The Soviets worked 
through Lin Piao, the acerbic 
defense minister, who has 
been designated by Mao Tse-
tung to become his successor. 
Encoeraged by his Soviet 
contacts, Lin opposed inviting 
President Nixon to Peking and 
advocated restoring the 
Chinese-Russian partnership. 
This put Lin in direct conflict 
with Premier Chou En-lai, 
who had issued the invitation 
to Nixon. 
Lin lost the showdown and 
mysteriously disappeared. The 
crafty Chou spread the word 
to the party faithful that Lin 
had died in a plane crash after 
attempting to assassinate Mao. 
Chou's version, which was 
whispered around China and 
reached CIA ears, had it that 
Lin attempted to waylay Mao 
on the way home from South 
China by train last August. 
Knowing Mao's itinerary 
would take him through 
Shanghai and Wuhsi, Lin al-
legedly arranged an assassina-
tion party in Shanghai and aft-
erward planned to blow up a 
bridge in Wuhsi to wreck 
Mao's train. Both plots failed, 
according to the story, and 
Lin attempted to flee to Rus-
sia by jet on Sept. 13. The 
plane supposedly crashed in 
the Wenteukhan area of Mon-
golia. 
The whispers of the plot to 
kill Mao, who has deity status 
in China, apparently was in-
tended to cow Lin Piao's sup-
porters. So monstrous was the 
thought of assassinating the 
great Mao, in Chinese minds, 
that the Lin faction was sup-
posed to be intimidated into 
silence. 
But the opposition to Chou 
continued to simmer under 
the surface, and the Russians 
quietly pressed for better rela-
tions The plenum of the So-
viet Central Committee, in an 
unpublished action last No-
vember, sought to restrain the 
ideological struggle against 
the Chinese. 
Still, other events inflamed 
Chi nese-Russian relations 
until the State Department re-
ported in a confidential sum-
mary last December: "Sino-So-
viet international polemics as 
distinct from domestic propa-
ganda have risen to the 
highest level since 1969 
. . . Peking, however, hail 
so far avoided whipping up 
a war scare Within China, 
and it appears to be attempt-
ing to restrict increased ten-
sion with Moscow to verbal 
fireworks on international 
questions." 
Significantly, Chou is in 
charge of China's interna-
tional affairs and, therefore, 
was responsible for the rising 
rhetoric. President Nixon's air 
attacks upon North Vietnam, 
however, have made it awk-
ward for Chou. 
China and Russia have been 
competing for Hanoi's favor, 
as the two titans of commu-
nism maneuver for influence 
In Southeast Asia. 
Rivalry, in Hanoi 
The Central Intelligence 
Agency, in a secret report, has 
declared: "Following Dr. 
Henry Kissinger's July visit to 
Peking, Chinese Premier Chou 
En-lei made a secret visit to 
Hanoi to reassure the Govern-
ment of the Democratic Re-
public of Vietnam (DRV) of 
continued Chinese support. 
"The Chinese emphasized 
their support by increasing 
their assistance to the DRV 
for the 1971-72 period. This in 
turn resulted in an increase in 
Soviet assistance to the DRV 
for the same period. . 
"The DRV expressed its ap-
prehension to Chou regarding 
a U.S.-Chinese detente and 
stated that the DRV is still 
suspicious about President 
Nixon's visit to Peking." 
In view of the Chinese-Rus-
Sian rivalry in Hanoi, Nixon 
undermined Chou and justi-
fied Lin's position by orderiAts 
air strikes against North Viet-
nam. This has strengthened 
Lin's survivors inside the 
Chinese policy councils. 
As a result, Lin's idea of re-
pairing Chinese-Russian rela-
tions is gaining support. At 
the United Nations, for exam-
ple, the relations .between 
Chinese and Russian delegates 
are warming. 
A Soviet delegation, on tour 
of China, has also been re-
ceived with unaccustomed 
cordiality. In return, there was 
no Soviet denunciation of the 
Chinese at the Lenin Day cele-
bration on April 21. 
There are now hints of 
Chinese-Russian cooperation 
to route war supplies overland 
to North Vietnam. If this de-
velops, the mining of the 
North Vietnamese harbors will 
cost the U.S. far more in 
world strategy than is likely 
to be gained on the Vietnam-
ese fighting fronts.

Red Carpet for Nixon Slightly Pale 
By. Jack Anderson 
Secret intelligence reports 
declare that President Nixon's 
high-risk military moves in 
Vietnam have undermined 
those in both Moscow and Pe-
king who want to ease ten-
sions with the United States. 
Although there had been no 
visible opposition to the Presi-
dent's trip to Peking and invi-
tation to visit Moscow, the 
Central Intelligence Agency 
claims the detente was fierce-
ly resisted inside the policy 
councils of both governments. 
To protect our sources, we 
cannot quote directly from the 
CIA documents. The CIA 
maintains, however, that the 
decision to invite Nixon was 
by no means unanimous in 
Moscow or Peking. 
Citing "reliable" sources, 
the CIA claims the Soviet mil-
itary hierarchy has opposed 
doing business with Nixon. De-
fense Minister Andrei 
Grechko, apparently, has be-
come the principal spokesman 
for this faction inside the 
Kremlin. 
The Russian marshals, ac-
mrding to the CIA, are eager 
,o share credit in Hanoi for 
:he North Vietnamese sue-
ceases. For the military equip-
ment, which has smashed the 
South Vietnamese defenses, 
was made in Russia. 
The Soviets, in the bidding 
against the Chinese for influ-
ence in Hanoi, had offered the 
North Vietnamese a $110 mil-
lion military loan. Gen. Vo 
Nguyen Giap, the North Viet-
cided to spend it for tanks, 
heavy artillery and anti-air-
namese military genius, deci-
craft missiles. 
The Soviet military brass 
would like to see a setback for 
U.S. Interests not only in Viet-
nam but the Middle East. The 
CIA warns that the Russians 
may counter U.S. moves in 
Vietnam with new initiatives 
in the Mediterranean. 
The CIA offers fewer specif-
ics about the opposition within 
the Chinese leadership to the 
Chinese-American detente. 
But bitter opposition, says the 
CIA, is simmering beneath the 
surface. 
Laird's Good Humor 
Our recent columns on the 
misuse of the Pentagon auto 
fleet has drawn a good-humor-
ed reaction from Defense 
Secretary Mel Laird and or-
ders from on high to start 
Obeying the regulations. 
But the Pentagon bigshots, 
as usual, are reading the regu-
lations to suit their expensive 
tastes, not to save the taxpay-
ers' money. Result: most of 
the staggering waste contin-
ues. 
We told, for example, how 
gon cars, intended for use 
only on pressing official busi-
ness, had become a luxury lim-
ousine service for military po-
tentates and their congres-
sional friends. 
Laird, meanwhile, still has 
two limousines at his constant 
call in case one should de-
velop motor trouble. His spe-
caw aesistant, Carl Wahace, is 
also picked up each morning 
and delivered home each eve-
ning by a military chauffeur. 
The men who toil in the 
Pentagon garage, however, 
were getting the word to put 
an end to excursions that vio-
late regulations. This, presum-
ably, meant stopping the prac-
tice of routinely chauffeuring 
members of Congress around 
Washington. 
But when the motor pool 
tried to follow orders, it found 
itself in hot water with the 
Pentagon's congressional liai-
son office, which is responsi 
ble for keeping the military's 
popularity rating high on 
Capitol Hill. 
The clash between military 
regulations and congressional 
relations was quickly resolved 
in favor of keeping the Con-
gressmen happy. The soldiers 
who man the motor pool were 
ordered to provide whatever 
the congressional liaison of-
fice wanted. 
So military vehicles con-
tinue, for example, to bring in 
large quantities of liquor from 
the Pentagon's Washington 
supplier so there will be 
plenty to serve to thirsty Con-
gressmen when they attend a 
military reception or take a 
military flight. 
The fact that such trips in-
volve an apparently illegal 
transportation of liquor across 
the Virginia border from 
Washington doesn't bother the 
Pentagon brass. 
Apparently, the abuse of 
military cars is not cord med 
to Washington. At the U.S. 
naval base in Bermuda, for ex-
ample, the brass ride around 
in full-size American sedans 
despite the fact that such 
large cars are legally forbid-
den to other residents of the 
resort island.

'Brainwash' Attempt by Russians? 
By Jack Anderson 
aklaaa,...in the Ceptral Inte1-
alanaL12.stet 
files is an account of a possi-
X4_59,at_Attgant 
to "brain-
ersonnel 
erious 
The fantastic details are 
contained in a file marked 
"Operation Pandora," which 
describes how the Russians 
bombarded our embassy with 
eerie, low-radiation impulses. 
Their secret intent, it was sus-
pected, may have been to alter 
the personalities of our diplo-
mats. 
The bizarre story began in 
1945 when a Russian pres-
ented Averell Harriman, then 
our ambassador, with a hand-
some carved Great Seal of the 
United States. Harriman 
proudly hung it in the em-
bassy. 
The seal contained a tiny 
electronic eavesdropping de-
vice, which monitored conver-
sations inside the embassy 
until 1952, when it was de-
tected. From this shocking dis-
covery Came urgent orders 
that all embassies must be pe-
riodically checked for elec-
tronic signals. 
In the '60, U.S. security men 
discovered the strange micro-
wave impulses, some steady, 
some pulsating, directed into 
our Moscow embassy from a 
neighboring building.' 
The CIA quickly learned 
that Russian medical litera-
ture suggested Microwaves 
can cause nervous tension, ir= 
ritablility, even disorders. 
They speculated that the Rus-
sians were trying to drive 
American diplomats stir crazy 
with the waves. 
Neither the Cia nor the 
State Department had the fa-
cilities to ?test the effects of 
the silent rays on human 
beings. At the Pentagbn, how-
ever, the super-secret Ad-
vanced Research Project had 
worked on electronic sensors 
and other weird projects 
The agency quietly began a 
study, under the direction of 
-Richard Cesaro, into the ef-
fects of microwaves on people. 
Cesaro gave the project the 
code name, "Operation Pan-
dora," and called in a physi-
cian, Dr. ?Herb Pollack, and 
two crack military scientists, 
Dr. Joseph Sharp of Walter 
Reed Army hospital, and engi-
neer-microwave expert Mark 
Grove of the Air Force. 
Sharp and Grove, supplied 
with the microwave data moni-
tored in the embassy, dupli-
cated the embassy environ-
ment, using monkeys for dip-
lomats. 
The monkeys actually were 
trained to perform tasks and 
then were rewarded with food, 
much as embassy employees 
might be rewarded with a dry 
martini at the end of the day. 
The monkeys were studied 
night and day for months at 
Walter Reed, while a collat-
eral experiment was con-
ducted on rabbits by consult-
ant Dr: Milton Zaret in his 
own laboratory. 
In the embassy in Moscow, 
meanwhile, no one except the 
highest diplomats and security 
men were aware of the secret 
microwave drama. 
By 1967, the scientists felt 
they had watcned the monkeys 
long enough for a tentative 
reading. Some felt there were 
signs of "aberrant behavior" 
caused by the microwaves, but 
the majority disagreed. Only 
the rabbits showed clear 
changes?in their heart rate?
which Zaret attributed to heat 
from the rays. 
The disagreement on psy-
chological changes were sent 
to.. a top secret reviewing 
board, which also could reach 
no absolute conclusion that 
the rays affected the monkeys' 
minds 
Nevertheless, the suspicion 
lingered, and the White House 
decided that even if the micro-
waves were not "brainwash-
ing" embassy people, they 
should be halted. It was also 
suspected that the wayes 
might be part of some radical 
new surveillance technique. 
At the June 1967 Glassboro 
meeting between President 
Lyndon Johnson and Soviet 
Premier Aleksei Kosygin, the 
question of the microwave 
rays came up. One informant 
Insists Johnson personally 
asked Kosygin to end the ray 
bombardment, although other 
sources say the request was 
made at a lower level. 
By 1968, most of Cesaro's 
scientists were convinced that' 
the microwaves were not psy-
chologically harmful and the 
embassy experiments ended in 
early 1969. 
The brilliant work done by 
the team, however, has now 
led to important research on 
the effects of microwaves. So 
far, tests show high radiation 
can injure eyes, genital organs 
and perhaps other parts of the 
body. But, as yet, there is no 
conclusive proof that low-level 
radiation is harmful. 
Footnote: We have spoken 
with Cesaro, Pollack, Sharp, 
Zaret and Grove. All acknowl-
edged they worked on "Opera-
tion Pandora," but all refuse 
to go into details. As Sharp 
put it: "Pandora was classified 
in those days and still is." 
Auto Pollution 
The Environmental Protec-
tion Agency has eased up on 
the car makers, all very se-
cretly, so they can spew more 
exhaust into the atmosphere 
than federal law allows. 
The Clean Air Act requires 
a reduction of at least 90 per 
cent in poisonous exhaust 
emissions by 1975. But it has 
been left up to EPA Adminis-
trator William Ruckelshaus to 
implement the law. 
Ruckelshaus's first proposal 
was so weak that Ralph Nader 
and other environmentalists 
raised an almighty howl. On 
the other side, the auto mak-
ers, led by General Motors, 
claimed it was too tough. 
Publicly, EPA defended the 
proposal, but behind closed 
doors, the agency caved in to 
General Motors.

U.S. Beats Russia in Capsule Chase 
By Jack Anderson 
With all the drama of a TV 
thriller, an American helicop-
ter and Soviet trawler raced 
at top speed recently for a 
missile capsule that had 
plopped into the stormy Atlan-
tic. 
The dramatic dash took 
place on March 18 off the Vir-
ginia coast. In a hairbreadth 
finish, the copter trium-
phantly retrieved the capsule 
from the ocean a couple of 
minutes before the trawler 
reached the spot. 
The missile was fired on 
March 17 by the National Aer-
onautics and Spaee Adminis-
tration from Wallops Island, 
Va. This was a classified mis-
sion for the Atomic Energy 
Commission to measure how 
cloud moisture erodes projec-
tiles, including America's nu-
clear missiles. 
The small, cloud-probing 
missile soared into the atmos-
phere, then jettisoned its cap-
sule about 20 miles offshore 
into turbulent international 
waters. The capsule contained 
secret instruments and a horn-
ing beacon. But recovery from 
the high waves was impossi-
ble. 
Next day, the waves had 
calmed, but the beacon was 
dead. For half a day, NASA 
planes searched for the bob-
bing object. Finally, a fixed-
wing scouting plane spotted 
the capsule and hovered pro-
tectively over it. 
Rushing toward the capsule, 
however, was a Soviet fishing 
boat. The Soviets have outfit-
ted many of these ships with 
the latest electronic monitor-
ing equipment. The boats fish 
for sea herring, mackerel and 
U.S. secrets along the Ameri-
can coast. 
At the approach of the traw-
ler, NASA hastily ordered a 
rescue helicopter into the 
race. The clattering copter 
and the straining trawler al-
most converged on the prize at 
the same time. But the copter 
reached the capsule ahead of 
the boat and dropped down in 
the waves, while the American 
crew expertly fished the cap-
sule from the seas in the nick 
of time. 
At Wallops Island, a NASA 
spokesman confirmed our ac-
count of the sea chase. The 
trawler may have been moni-
toring the homing device, or 
the Russians may have been 
attracted to the spot by the 
hovering U.S. plane. But the 
spokesman acknowledged "our 
guys were uneasy." 
For the Russians to have 
filched the capsule with its 
cargo of American secrets 
from under NASA's nose, he 
conceded, would have been 
highly embarrassing. "But," he 
said, "there's nothing we could 
have done. Those were inter-
national waters." 
Nixon Document 
The mystery of billionaire 
Howard Hughes' $205,000 loan 
to President Nixon's brother, 
Don, still has some loose ends 
that need tying up. 
When this column exposed 
the loan 12 years ago, Richard 
Nixon stated: "I had no part 
or interest in my brother's 
business. I had no part what-
ever in the negotiation of this 
loan." 
From the records of the Los 
Angeles County Courthouse, 
however, we have obtained a 
16-year-old document which 
seems to dispute Mr. Nixon's 
'statement. This is a lease of 
the bit of land owned by Mr. 
Nixon's mother, Hannah, 
which was used to secure the' 
Hughes loan. The lease was 
made out to Union Oil Com-
pany of California and is part 
of the complicated loan ar-
rangements. 
It is signed by Hannah 
Nixon, and the faded stamp 
shows it was notorized by Wil 
ham A. Ridgely in Washing-
ton, D.C. At that time, Ridgely 
worked in the Senate financial " 
office, as he still does. 
Only a senator or the presi-
dent of the Senate could have . 
approved Hannah Nixon's use 
of Ridgely's office for notarii-
ing. As Vice President, Mr. 
Nixon was then president of 
the Senate. 
Ridgely told us he vaguely 
recalled going to Mr. Nixon's 
house to do notary work. 
'That could have been the I 
time," he told us. 
In any case, it appears that 
Mr. Nixon, or someone in his 
office, sent Hannah Nixon to 
Ridgely to get a lease notar-
ized on Oct. 12, 1956?at the 
same time Mr. Nixon said he 
"had no part whatsoever in 
the negotiation of this loan."

From a member of the Cu-
ban delegation at the United 
Nations, meanwhile, the CIA 
learned that at least some 
Cuban leaders "are doing 
some re-thinking on basic re-
revolutionary tactics. 
"There is some theoretical 
opposition to the 'Che Gue-
vara' theory, which favors 
supporting native insurrec-
tionists and anarchists in poor 
countries." 
"Instead', support is growing 
for the Chilean formula, 
which maintains that tradi-
tional democratic procedures 
countries. 
"It is in countries like Bra-
zil," the CIA quoted the Cu-
ban delegate as saying, "that 
stronger active measures 
should be taken." 
'No-Fault' Ruckus 
When a self-styled consum-
ers group in New York City 
tried to keep Sen. Frank Moss 
(D-Utah) from talking about 
"no-fault" insurance at their 
inaugural Meeting Moss angri-
ly canceled the speech. 
The "consumers group" is 
made up of wives of members 
of the American Trial Law-
yers Association.. The associ-
ation is busily lobbying against 
"no-fault" because it will re-
duce lawyers' fees by an esti-
mated $1 billion. 
But the wives have agreed 
to back product safety bills 
which don't cut into their fur 
coats and their husbands' Cad-
illacs. So they wanted Moss to 
speak. 
The ladies' lawyer Herman 
Glaser called Moss' office to 
make the final arrangements 
and said a press conference 
would be held at the meeting. 
As Moss' secretary Dolly 
Plumb recalls it Glaser left in-
structions that if the press 
asked about "no-fault," Moss 
was to reply: "I have no com-
ment to make on this point." 
When the senator was told 
about this, he exploded. "No-
body tells me what I can an-

John Woodcock Jr., assistant 
district attorney of Blair Coun-
ty in Pennsylvania, has beet. 
stymied in his investigation of-
Rep. Irving Whalley's kick-
backs by the House Clerk and: 
the Justice Department. The 
clerk, Pat Jennings, has passed, 
the buck to the do-nothing 
House Ethics Committee, and 
the Justice Department haS 
dodged Woodcock's questions. 
Ironically, Woodcock and Whal-

Both the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies called for 
the investigation after Hernan 
del Canto, Minister of the In-
terior, had reported on what 
he said was a plot by retired 
military officers and a small, 
right-wing opposition party to 
overthrow Dr. Allende last 
week. 
The investigation will be 
conducted in the Chamber of 
Deputies. However, the anti-
Marxist Opposition, which con-
trols the Congress, questioned 
the evidence the Government 
has presented on both the 
C.I.A. activities and on the 
supposed plot. 
The main opposition party, 
the Christian Democratis, an-
nounced that in protest it would 
organize a march open to "all 
democratic parties." The march, 
it said, would also serve to 
demonstrate opposition to the 
refusal by Dr. Allende's lett-
wing Government to authorize 
a march by women 10 days 
ago and another by privale 
organizations Tuesday. 
While Congres agreed to an 
investigation of the C.I.A. in 
Chile, a court of appeals re-
leased on $82 bail the president 
of the Fatherland and Liberty 
movement, Pablo Rodriguez 
Grez, a lawyer who was ac-
cused byt he Government' prose-
cutor of fomenting the plot last 
week. 
A retired general, Alberto 
Green Baquedano, and two re-
tired junior army officers are 
being held in the plot, which 
the Government has said called 
for the assassination of Dr. 
Allende. 
OM 
The investigation of the 
C.I.A. and the International 
Telephone and Telegraph Cor-
poration, which has large in-
vestments here, stems from 
purported I.T.T. documents 
made public by ,Jack Anderson, 
the syndicated Washington 
columnist. 
The documents, which sug-
gest that I.T.T. employes, some 
of whom were in contact with 
the C.I.A. in Washington, tried 
unsuccessfully to promote a 
military coup to keep Dr. Al-
lende from taking office, have 
caused a political storm here. 
Ex-C.I.A. Director cited 
John A. McCone, a former 
director of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency, has confirmed 
that executives of International 
Telephone & Telegraph Corpo-
ratiom had discussed moves 
against President Salvador Al-
lende Crossens of Chile, the 
magazine Business Week said 
today.

Far from disavowing the au-

published by Mr, Anderson, 
Mr. McCone said they were 
written by I.T.T. staff mem-
bers, according to Business 
Week. 
I.T.T. spokesmen have denied 
as "without foundation in fact" 
allegations that the company 
had panned or participated in 
any plots against Dr. 'Allende 
in an effort to protect its 
properties in Chile against ex-
propriation.

CIA Papers Show Anti-Allende View 
By Jack Anderson 
In earlier columns, we 
quoted from internal memos 
to show how the International 
Telephone and Telegraph con-
glomerates and the Central 
Intelligence Agency plotted 
together unsuccessfully to 
block President Salvador Al-
lende from coming to power 
in Chile.

Thelatest secret intelligence 
Leports bear out the CIA's con-
!ern, These reports that Cuban 
lictator Fidel Castro has 
.urned his embassy in San-
iago, Chile, into "the principal 
uba9 center for support of 
,atin-A merle an liberation 
novements." 
This Cuban liberation center 
llegedly "provides financial 
nd logistical support and 
uidance to the subversive 
(roups operating in other 
r,atin American countries." 
The CIA also charges that, 
President Salvador Allende 
vhrougli lesser government of-
icials has apparently' given 
his approval for Cuba to main-
tain contact with these subver-
sive elements in Chile." 
Castro has formed a special 
Directorate 10 r Liberation 
whose mission is ' to foment 
Communist revolutions around 
the world. It is staffed, accord-
ing to the CIA, by hundreds 
of tough, trained intelligence 
officers under the command 
of Manuel Pineiro Losado, who 
is known by the code name 
"Barba Roja." 
The Latin American section 
is directed by a man known 
as "Ariel," whom the CIA 
identifies by two names he 
has used in the past, Juan 
Carretero Ibanez and Ruben 
Cabrera Marquez. From Ha-
vana, he directed the late Che 
Guevara's rag-tag guerrilla 
operations in Bolivia in 1968. 
The chief of the liberation 
team in the Cuban embassy in 
Santiago, according to the 
CIA, is Manuel Martinez G 
lan, who goes by the cod 
name "Manolo." He is a ye 
eran Communist intelligence 
officer who is reportedly in 
charge of all clandestine ac-
tivities in the Santiago em-
bassy. 
"The presence in Santiago 
of `Manolo' and 'Arid,'" de-
clares a secret CIA report, 
"are indicators of the import-
ance attached to the continued 
Cuban government interests 
and active support of the ex-
port of the revolution." 
Castro used his embassy in 
Paris as "the principal center 
concerned with providing vari-
ous types of support to Latin 
American liberation move-
ments" until Allende allowed 
him to open an embassy in 
Santiago. "Communications 
between the Cuban officers 
in Santiago and guerrillas 
operating in other countries," 
says the CIA, "is accomplished 
by radio. 
"On occasions an officer 
will be dispatched from Ha-
vana to make contact with 
one or more of the guerrillas. 
Explosives in the form of plas-
tics are carried in false bot-
toms of suitcases by the travel-
ing officers." 
Footnote: The Cuban em-
bassy supports various sub-
versive groups throughout 
Latin America, but the CIA 
identifies as "the most nota-
ble" the notorious Tupamaro 
terrorists who operate in Uru-
guay. 
pruce Goose Revisite 
Billionaire Howard Hughes' 
vintage plywood flying boat, 
the "Spruce Goose" is about 
to lumber into the news again. 
A team of General Services 
Administration ofifcials has 
secretly visited the hangared 
monster to try to figure out 
what to do with it. 
Although GSA owns the 
eight-motored giant, renting it 
to Hughes for about $800 a 
month, Hughes guards re-
quired the officials to sign in, 
then barred, them from going 
inside the plane. They were 
kept 20 feet away on the 
grounds that maintenance 
work was in progress. 
Resigned to Hughes' strange 
ways, GSA regional head Rich-
ard Laws complied. Laws 
sighed, "It's a beautiful thing" 
when he saw Itha air relic 
which is bigger overall than 
either the 747 or huge C-5 
transport. 
GSA is considering giving 
the ivory-colored behemoth, 
which Hughes test flew one 
time only 25 years ago, to a 
federal, state or municipal 
museum. If none will take it, 
GSA may sell it for a novel 
restaurant, as a low-speed air 
transport, or ,as a tourist at-
traction such as the London 
Bridge or the Queen Mary. 
Thus, the Hughes book hoax 
controversy is finally stirring 
the government to dispose of 
he venerable seaplane slum-
ering in its huge humidity-
controlled hangar in Cali-
fornia. 
Gravel vs. Kleindienst 
Sen. Mike Gravel (D-Alaska) 
has confided to friends that 
he will vote firmly against 
elevating Richard Kleindienst 
to Attorney General. ' 
Gravel was dubious before 
the ITT hearings. Now, he 
says, he is convinced that 
Kleindienst is unsuitable as 
the nation's number one law 
enforcer.
