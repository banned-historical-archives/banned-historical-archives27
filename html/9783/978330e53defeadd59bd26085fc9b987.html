 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR
 McNAMARA OF MICHIGAN
 Mr. PEARSON.  Mr. President, today
 I wish to add my own personal comments
 to those of my colleagues who have re-
 cited the accomplishments of retiring
 Senator PAT MC.NAMARA.
 Since I came to the Senate 4 years ago
 I have had the distinct personal privilege
 of serving on the Public Works Commit-
 tee with the distinguished Michigan Sen-
 ator as chairman.  Our committee has
 made considerable progress in the last 4
 years, and I wish to echo the comments
 of other Senators when I say that PAT
 McNAMARA'S leadership and guidance will
 be missed.  Ifs 12 years of dedicated
 and progressive service to the Nation
 shall never be forgotten.
 not poor would qualify for subsidies.  Where-
 Upon L.B.J. came right back this year, asking
 for $30 million for re; it subsidies in the fiscal
 year ending .June 30, and requesting that the
 yearly payments be increased over 4 years
 to an annual rate of $150 million.
 Under the plan. tenants would pay a quur..
 ter of their wages for rent, the Federal Gov-
 ernment would subsidize the remainder.  If
 the family's income increases, the rent s-;ib-
 sidy will be reduced proportionately. Unlike
 public housing, which requires families to
 move after their laconic reaches a cerl,dn
 leve`, these famines can continue living in
 their apartments waste ver their income level,
 although they will not qualify for a subsidy
 if their income exceeds a specified ceilini'.
 Few would deny the need for rich America
 to  provide  adequate housing  for  its  im-
 poverished.                                                                               And perhaps the rent subsidy
 plan will succeed where public housing, for
 all its good inten ;:ons, has not.  But we
 would hope that Congress examines the pro-
 posal with a cold eye, to insure that it does
 not become a carrot for politicians to dangle
 before voters.
 If' such a possibility seems farfetched, we
 need only point to the experience of rent
 controls, which clearly were used as poli, Kcal
 bait to curry votes at the expense of a rela-
 tively small minoetty (i.e., the house and
 apartment owner) .
 In an incisive rrec nt book, "Welfare, Free-
 dom, and Inflation," world-famed economist
 Wilhelm Ropke noted:
 "We have reached a stage when, to many
 people, it sounds strange when we ask the
 question why the earlier rule no longer holds
 good; that anyone who can afford to buy his
 cult out of his own pocket at the economic
 price, should also pay as economic price for
 his lodging.
 "flow does it come about that an otherwise
 perfectly reasonable citizen, who would be
 ashamed to let any body else pay for his re-
 frigerator, his motorcycle, or his lunch, has
 come to look on it as his unassailable right
 to shift part of the burden of the economic
 cost  of  his  lodging  onto  someone  else's
 shoulders?"
 Professor Ropke was not, of course, refer-
 ring to the truly poor, those whose impov-
 erished condition puts them at the mercy
 of the state.  He meant those greedy citi-
 zens who agitate for handouts or subsidies
 because they bel.eve, or choose to believe,
 that nobdoy pays for anything that comes
 from the Government--that a handout or a
 subsidy is "free."
 By all means, Congress should make pro-
 visions for those who genuinely need i,ous-
 ing assistance.  But it must take pains to ex-
 chade from the Government watering trough
 those who merely have their hands out in
 hope of something for nothing.
 to substitute athestic communistic cere-
 monies for the deeply religious feelings
 of these brave people in the Baltic States.
 Naturally, Mr. President, the sons and
 daughters of these captive nations who
 immigrated to the United States vigor-
 ously reacted to the destruction of free-
 dom in their former native lands.  De-
 scendants of the peoples of the Baltic
 States continue to point out to the world
 this oppression under Soviet rule. All
 Americans  resent  the  subjugation of
 these small nations.  The policy of our
 Government reflects these sentiments,
 for our Government fails to recognize
 the cruel annexation of the small coun-
 tries by the Soviet Union.
 Mr. President:, I know free people
 everywhere join me today in hoping that
 the 25 years of enslavement of the Lithu-
 anian, Latvian and Estonian people will
 someday be ended and that these small
 countries together with all the nations
 of the world will be able to determine
 for themselves their own destiny.
 THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE AND
 TECHNOLOGY  TO  LEGISLATIVE
 BODIES
 Mr. TALMADGE.  Mr. President, last
 November when the Interparliamentary
 Union Conference met in Geneva, Switz-
 erland, which I attended as president of
 the U.S. delegation, a most interesting
 and informative address was delivered to
 the group by Edward Wenk, Jr., of the
 Library of Congress on the increasing
 importance of science and technology to
 legislative bodies in the world today.
 Mr. Wenk made a scholarly and in-
 formative presentation, and I ask unani-
 mous consent that this address be printed
 in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.
 There being no objection, the address
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 INFORMATION REQUIRED BY PARLIAMENTS IN A
 WORLD INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT UPON SCI-
 ENCE
 (An address before the Interparliamentary
 Union  Conference,  Geneva,  Switzerland,
 Nov.  5, 1965,  by  Edward   Wenk,  Jr.,
 Chief, Science Policy Research Division,
 Legislative Reference Service, Library of
 Congress)
 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, ladies
 and gentlemen, it is a very great privilege to
 have been invited to participate in this sym-
 posium  of  the  Interparliamentary  Union.
 And it is all the more an honor to represent
 the scientific community at this auspicious
 dedication of the Union's new home.
 The long history and high purpose of this
 body in seeking world peace and enhance-
 ment  of  the democratic process are well
 known. Especially in Geneva, the city of
 peace, I felt it all the more appropriate to
 recall the basic relationships of science and
 politics that constitute the theme of my
 assignment.  Science  knows  no  national
 boundaries.  In a troubled world, communi-
 Mr. TANNIN. Mr. President, on Feb-

 Phoenix--the  largest daily newspaper
 published in  my  State-published a
 thoughtful and well-reasoned editorial
 on some of the dangers inherent in a
 program of rent subsidies. I believe this
 editorial deserves a wider audience and
 I therefore ask unanimous consent to
 have it printed in the RECORD.
 'i1'here being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 Approved For Release 2005/06/29 : CIA-RDP67B00446R000400030003-2
 February 23, 1966         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 ness was going off the books than was being
 issued.
 The company, along with the rest of the
 country, began to recouperate from the shock
 and the initial  effects of the  depression,
 however, and in 1936 Bertrand J. Perry was
 elected president of the still-growing com-
 pany.  Mr. Perry served as president until
 1945, when he became chairman of the board.
 When he retired as a director in 1955, his
 association with the company spanned 58
 years. Alexander T. Maclean had succeeded
 Mr. Perry as president and served until his
 death in 1950.   On May  19  of that year
 Leland J. Kalmbach became president and
 served in that position until 1962, when he
 was elected chairman of the board and chief
 executive officer, and Charles H. Schaaff be-
 came the company's 10th president.
 In 1951, the company's 100th anniversary
 year, its assets were $1.4 billion.  Insurance
 in force totaled $3.2 billion.  New insurance
 delivered that year amounted to nearly $348
 million.
 This past year-1965-new insurance de-
 livered amounted to well over $1.8 billion.
 Insurance in force passed the $12 billion
 level.  And assets, which have doubled about
 every 12 years since 1928, increased to more
 than $3.3 billion..  New alltime records in
 the sale of both individual and group life
 insurance were set during the year with indi-
 vidual insurance sales topping $1 billion for
 the  7th  consecutive  year.   January  of
 1965 was  the    largest individual-life-sales
 month in the company's history.
 Another milestone achieved in 1965 was
 the surpassing of the $1 billion level in out-
 standing mortgage loans.   The                              company's
 first mortgage loan of $2,000 was made in
 1859.
 The company today ranks as the 10th
 largest in assets of the more than 1,600 life
 insurance companies in the Nation.  It also
 is ranked among the country's top 22 finan-
 cial institutions and the top 40 business
 organizations in general.  The company lists
 more than 700,000 individual policyholders,
 and is licensed to do business in all 50 States,
 the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.
 Its Springfield home office staff numbers
 some 2,200 and its field force of 3,500 is
 distributed in 120 general agencies, 285 dis-
 trict offices, 42 group insurance offices, and
 9 mortgage loan and real estate offices.
 Also in 1965, the company occupied a four-
 story addition to its home office site.  The
 new east building, which provides some 184,-
 000 gross square feet of additional floorspace,
 is one of the largest commercial structures
 erected in the Greater Springfield area since
 the present home office was built in 1927.
 The entire home office complex now occupies
 some 85 acres of land.
 The company also reported in 1965 that
 its new investments now average more than
 $1.5 million each working day.  Total amount
 of the company's entire investment portfolio
 now at work in the Nation's economy is ap-
 proximately $3 billion.  The company's in-
 vestment division comprises three major de-
 partments-securities, mortgage loans, and
 real estate.
 The company is considered to have one of
 the outstanding field forces in the life in-
 surance industry today.  Substantiating this
 is the fact that one out of every eight com-
 pany field men and women is a member of
 the industry's elite sales group, the million-
 dollar round table.  The industrywide aver-
 age membership in this group is one of every
 72. In addition, one out of every five Massa-
 chusetts Mutual representatives is a char-
 tered life underwriter, the industry's highest
 educational designation, compared to 1 of
 every 18 for the industry.  Also, two of every
 five  Massachusetts  Mutual  representatives
 have  qualified  for the    National Quality
 Award, an industrywide honor, compared to
 1 of 13 in the entire industry.
 The company prides itself on Its quality
 field force, as well as on its contracts and its
 policyholder service.  The company's letter-
 heads are impressed with the trademark, "In
 Our Second Century of Service."
 Best's Life Insurance Reports, an annual
 edition reporting on many aspects of "legal
 reserve companies, fraternal benefit societies
 and assessment associations operating in the
 United States," makes these comments on
 the Massachusetts Mutual:
 "The company, now in its second century
 of operation, is purely mutual and is par-
 ticularly a policyholders' institution.  It has
 long been most ably managed.  It ranks very
 highly and enjoys a most excellent reputa-
 tion in all respects * * *.                                                                               Every important
 benefit and privilege which the company has
 given to new policyholders has been given to
 old policyholders on the same terms, except
 when expressly forbidden by State or other
 laws."
 In another section, the report adds: "In
 operations a very important item is expenses,
 which have been kept remarkably low. Care-
 ful selection and underwriting of business
 has produced  a  very favorable     mortality
 experience.   Policy  lapses  and  surrenders
 have been low.   Net cost to policyholders is
 remarkably low."
 Throughout its history, then, one of the
 company's   foremost   objectives  has  been
 superlative  service  to  its  policyholders.
 Though the implementation of ZIP codes
 to its master file is merely one area of service,
 it points up the company's constant efforts
 toward that foremost objective.    The com-
 pany, in this area alone, has at all times
 coooperated with the Post Office Department.
 Since its inception in July 1961, company
 secretary, Harrison B. Clapp, has chaired the
 Springfield Mail Users Council, which has
 sponsored discussion meetings on the na-
 tionwide improved mail service program, the
 accelerated business collection and delivery
 program, the ZIP code program, and the
 scheduled parcel post program. Communica-
 tions Manager Alexander T. Muir has spoken
 on postal matters to various groups, and
 through nationwide test mailings has as-
 sisted Springfield Postmaster Morin and the
 New England regional office to provide sub-
 stantially improved airmail service for the
 area.
 In this area of policyholder service and in
 every other area, the company, indeed, takes
 pride in Best's comment that the Mass-
 achusetts Mutual is "particularly a policy-
 holders4, institution."

 (Mr. MACKAY asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. MACKAY.  Mr. Speaker, Thai-
 land understands the domino theory
 much better than some of us back home,
 the Atlanta Constitution is convinced.
 Editorially the paper declares:
 We are in Vietnam to make it clear that
 communism  may  not  achieve  cheaply,
 through the guise of wars of liberation, what
 it knows would be costly on the open battle-
 field.                                                                           For if we are found wanting in the
 will to resist covert aggression, we are in
 effect inviting use of the method again in
 other parts of the world.
 Thailand knows it is "one of those
 parts of the world," the paper continues,
 adding that the Vice President visited
 Bangkok "to assure our Thai allies of aid
 in case of guerrilla aggression, as well as
 to discuss economic development of the
 area."
 Because this editorial discusses an
 issue on which we are committed to
 stand firm, it will be of general interest
 to my colleagues and I therefore am
 making the article available in the

 field.                                                                                              For if we are found wanting in the
 will to resist covert aggression, we are in ef-
 fect inviting use of the method again in other
 parts of the world.
 Thailand is one of those parts of the world.
 The kingdom's rulers know it.  Already, ex-
 ternally trained or inspired guerrillas are
 practicing terrorism in northeastern Thai-
 land.
 In fact, Thais are concerned that if the
 war is ended in South Vietnam, Chinese and
 North Vietnamese efforts may be centered
 on Thailand.  So they are less than enthusi-
 astic about a negotiated settlement.
 Thailand has been a consistent friend of
 America in southeast Asia.  It provides air
 bases that bolster our Vietnamese operations.
 And if we should later find it necessary to
 expand our troop commitments extensively
 and attempt to seal off the Vietcong's supply
 routes from the north, Thailand would be a
 base of our operation.
 So the Vice President Is in Bangkok to
 assure our Thai allies  of aid in case of
 guerrilla aggression, as well as to discuss
 economic development of the area.
 To the Siamese leaders, the domino theory
 is not such an object of ridicule as it is to
 some back home.
 LANDOWNERS   BATTLE   BRUSH
 PROBLEM TO RESTORE GRASS
 AND SAVE NEEDED WATER
 (Mr. POAGE (at the request of Mr.
 Moss) asked and was given permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD.)
 Mr. POAGE. Mr. Speaker, landowners
 of my State and probably of your State
 are engaged in a real fight to repulse the
 spread of moisture stealing, worthless,
 woody plants and brush-more than 50
 percent mesquits-that threaten to en-
 gulf the land.
 It may sound like so much science fic-
 tion, but these dense, prolific brushes
 are suffocating the livestock Industry
 throughout many other sections of our
 country, robbing the ranchers of soil,
 water and livestock grazing.
 The Soil Conservation Service and its
 range conservationists have surveyed the
 problem twice in the past 18 years and
 verify the alarming situation that more
 than 80 percent of the grassland in Texas
 has become infested with brush.
 Neither livestock operators, nor the
 Nation, can afford grasslands in poor
 condition, nor can we afford to lose the
 millions of acre-feet of water consumed
 annually by brush and weeds.  Water
 lost to brush is water lost to all beneficial
 use.  In Texas alone there is more water
 lost in 1 year to brush alone than is

 CONGRESSIONAI. RECORD - [[OUSE        February 23, 1966
 used by the city of Los Angeles. Just this
 morning the President sent this Con-
 gress a special message pointing out our
 critical shortage of water.  Where can
 we hope to save so much water as cheaply
 a.s we can through adequate brush con-
 trol?
 in the face of this tenacious enemy
 farmers and ranchers, not only in Texas,
 but throughout the rangelands of the
 entire country., are struggling to restore
 the abundant grasslands that once cov-
 ered our plains and prairies.
 The landowners in my district-the
 11th Congressional District of Texas-
 are excellent representatives of the stal-
 wart stewards of soil, water and grass-
 land who are waging this battle all across
 the United States.
 The whole Nation owes these people
 a continuing debt of gratitude for their
 efforts at increasing grassland agricul-
 ture. to maintain its role in production,
 and to protect American agriculture.
 Though treatment is going on all the
 time, the progress being made against
 the woody invader is far from encourag-
 ing.  Treatment is costly, it is complex,
 and. there is the disheartening probabil-
 ity of reinfestation on treated acres after
 a few years.  Actually, most treatment
 results only in control, not elimination
 of brush.
 This is a serious matter and Texas
 landowners have no illusions about the
 toughness of the   job.  On  the  other
 hand, I have no misgivings about their
 competence and will to handle it, but
 they must have the cooperation of their
 government, and above all, we must not
 lose to enthusiasm and the momentum
 which has been built up over the years.
 The Nation will suffer or benefit as these
 landowners lose or win the struggle.
 The Soil Conservation Service is keep-
 ing close watch on the problem and pro-
 viding technical assistance in treatment
 programs.  Its plant materials centers
 are  working  at  adapted  grasses  and
 legumes to recapture the land from
 brush, but a great deal more research
 and work is needed, and important as it
 is, brush control is only one of the many
 problems which should be studied in a
 grass and forage research center.  Until
 such a center is a reality, one of the larg-
 est and most vital segments of our food
 supplying effort is going to be without
 needed coordination.
 1.;,EDWOODS
 (Mr. HANK A asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. HANNA.  Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
 dent's message on restoring the quality
 of our environment is a remarkable doc-
 ument.  In addition to masterfully sum-
 marizing the problems we face,. and the
 opportunities which we have neglected, it
 sets the stage for a meaningful exposi-
 tion of the whole problem in the public
 forum. It is time that we begin to give
 our best thinking to this vital subject.
 I am at heart an optimist.  Therefore
 I have concentrated my attention on the
 opportunities outlined in the message.
 The various recreation proposals which
 are outlined in. the message seem to me
 to be the essence of these opportunities.
 The proposal that we establish a Red-
 wood National Park is a case in point.
 But it is not one on which we can ponder
 long.  We must not allow hesitation or
 procrastination to overcome the need
 for quick action.  Even as I talk, the last
 of the great redwoods forest is being
 felled. Only a fraction of virgin forest
 still remains and the lumber Indust y is
 making short work of that fraction.
 The redwood is a valuable resource.
 The wood has many unique and desir-
 able characteristics.  It resists rotting.
 It is almost impervious to insect attack.
 It weathers well.  It is beautiful and can
 be worked easily. This is the reason
 there is a steady demand for its use in
 lawn furniture, house siding, and dec-
 orative fences.  Its resistance to insects
 is also the reason why it lives for thou-
 sands of years in its native state.
 But the redwood is also a national re-
 source that must be preserved. I do not
 suggest that we deny the lumber indus-
 try the right to use redwoods. I do sug-
 gest that, considering their needs, we de-
 vise some way to preserve part of the
 forest for future generations.
 Redwoods are fast-growing trees. They
 replace themselves as usable lumber
 within 100 years.  It is my feeling that
 it would serve all purposes, the naturalist
 and the public, and the lumber industry,
 to preserve part in virgin stand and al-
 low the remainder to be managed in the
 manner the lumber industry does so well,
 to provide sustained yields of a valuable
 lumber.
 Establishing a Redwood Park does not
 preclude lumbering. Preserving a unique
 and unparalleled scenic masterpiece is
 not antithetical to the interests of the
 lumber industry.
 You have all heard of the Cedars of
 Lebanon..  I am told that a bare rem-
 nant is ]eft.  In fact, this storied grove
 of trees existed mostly intact weld into
 this century. Now the remaining virgin
 forest is measured by individual trees,
 some of which are a thousand years old.
 The visitor today is not struck by the
 beauty of the individual trees in their
 unique majesty, but rather is appalled
 at the short-sightedness of the men who
 allowed all but this pitiful remnant to
 be cut and used.  I propose that, when
 the administration's proposal for a park
 reaches this House, we find a way to en-
 act it quickly, lest we be judged in the
 sane manner the stewards of the Cedars
 of Lebanon are now judged.
 TRAILS
 (Mr. RONCALIO asked and was eiven
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. RONCALIO.   Mr. Speaker  the
 :President has addressed our attention to
 the problem of restoring the quality of
 our environment.  It was a disturbing
 ;message.  I admire his courage in de-
 tailing, In such graphic form, our so-
 ciety's "sins of omission."
 We did not consciously set out to de-
 stroy our environment, but rather :like
 Topsy, it "jest growed that way."  But
 whatever the reason, it is time we faced
 our obligations squarely and set about
 righting the wrongs we have visited on
 what most of us consider the most beau-
 tiful piece of real estate in the world.
 I was particularly impressed with the
 President's reference to the establish-
 ment of a nationwide system of trails.
 A visit to the C. & O. Canal on Sunday
 illustrates the universal appeal a pleas-
 ant surrounding and a path have for our
 citizens.
 There is no reason why we cannot en-
 courage this type of facility throughout
 the country.  By the turn of this cen-
 tury it is estimated that 85 percent of
 our people will live in cities as opposed
 to 65 percent now.  As the cities grow the
 land that is available will be put to some
 use.  Part of that land should be reserved
 for just such simple pleasures as the
 weekend stroll.  It would have been a
 tragic waste of good real estate had the
 C. & O. Canal been filled in and con-
 verted to residential or industrial use.
 But throughout this country this is ex-
 actly what is happening to other lands
 within or adjacent to our great cities.
 No  one  is  consciously  planning  its
 destruction and removal as a recreational
 asset, it is just happening because there
 has been no thought given to this type
 of use. This certainly is a sin of omis-
 sion.
 We can stimulate local communities
 to provide facilities for the stroller, the
 walker  and  the  hiker. They  should
 be located near him.
 A  nationwide  system  of  trails will
 stimulate local communities to provide
 their own systems.
 A program to encourage the estab;ii h-
 ment of trails and hiking paths need not
 be an expensive one.   The land and
 water conservation fund will surely en-
 courage development but mostly it re-
 quires  that  government                                                                                                                provide  the
 vision and the leadership by judicious
 designation of areas already in the pub-
 lic ownership.  By making such a de-
 signation of suitable areas the Federal
 Government can stimulate the develop-
 ment of a trails system which will meet
 the needs of both the urban dweller and
 the serious outdoorsman.  Wyoming is
 pleased to recognize this national need
 and to help fulfill it, Mr. Speaker.
 BENNETT CITES NEED TO CHANGE
 SYSTEM  OF  ELECTING  PRESI-
 DENT
 (Mr. BENNETT asked and was given
 permission to address the House for I
 minute and to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. BENNETT.  Mr. Speaker, since
 1959 I have introduced and supported
 legislation to change the system of elect-
 ing the President and Vice President of
 the United States. I am gratified that
 there is a renewed interest in this major
 constitutional problem and I am hopeful
 that positive action will take place in the
 89th Congress.
 I am today reintroducing legislation
 first introduced by me on the opening
 day of the 87th Congress dealing with
 this important subject.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE         February 23, 1966
 The stalwart resistance they have shown
 and are showing cannot help but be a source
 of inspiration to others suffering under the
 same yoke.
 And especially is it an inspiration to those
 of us living under a flag of liberty.
 By observances such as this you are re-
 minding yourselves and free men everywhere
 that human bondage has not yet been wiped
 from the face  of the earth and that much
 needs yet to be done.
 The way may well be long and hard for all
 of us.
 Freedom was never easily won.  It is never
 easily held.
 Four times since I was a young man in the
 uniform of World War I, my country has
 come to the defense of freedom.
 We are in such a conflict today, and we
 must be prepared for whatever else may be
 demanded of us in the months and years to
 come.
 As we look ahead, it might be well to re-
 call the words of the late John Foster Dulles,
 Secretary of State under our great President,
 Dwight D. Eisenhower.
 Speaking at the congressional inquiry into
 the incorporation of the Baltic States by the
 U.S.S.R. 13 years ago, Secretary Dulles said
 this:
 "What of the future?  First of all, let us
 never lose hope that there is a future."
 "I recall," he said, "I was looking in my
 Bible yesterday-some of the earliest history
 recorded in the books of the Old Testament.
 The nations there mentioned are such as
 Israel, Arabia, Egypt, and Lebanon.   How
 many  times have  these  nations of many
 thousands of years ago been submerged; to
 rise again?"
 "The  Baltic  peoples,"  Secretary Dulles
 continued, "in the face of every imposition,
 retain their will to be free and maintain
 their steadfast opposition to Soviet despot-
 ism.                                Terrorism has been prolonged now for
 13  years.   Many of their courageous and
 noble representatives have been  executed,
 deported, or driven into exile.  But their
 martyrdom keeps patriotism alive."
 -
 Then Secretary Dulles said this:
 "Some may say that it is unrealistic and
 impractical not  to recognize the enforced
 incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
 uania into the Soviet Union.  We believe,
 however, that despotism of the Soviet type
 cannot indefinitely perpetuate its rule over
 hundreds of  millions of people who  love
 God, country, and who have a sense of per-
 sonal dignity."
 "The  Soviet system which seeks to ex-
 punge the distinctive characteristics of na-
 tion,                                creed, and individuality  must itself
 change or be doomed ultimately to collapse.
 The   time  of collapse  depends largely  on
 whether the peoples who remain free pro-
 duce                                spiritual,  intellectual;  and      material
 richness; and whether we have a faith that
 can   penetrate any Iron Curtain;         and  we,
 must be sure that captive peoples know that
 they  are not forgotten, that we          are not
 reconciled to their fate, and above all, we
 are not prepared to seek illusory safety for
 ourselves by a bargain with their masters
 which would confirm their captivity."
 Let me say now for myself: As Majority
 Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives
 at the time Mr. Dulles made that statement,
 I shared those sentiments with him.
 I still hold to them.
 We would be guilty of wishful thinking
 if we  believed the collapse of the Soviet
 Union is imminent.
 But there is a growing evidence that all
 is not well with the Red conspiracy.
 Cracks are beginning to show in the com-
 munist front.
 Mr. Castro, who not so long ago was wel-
 . coming the Red Chinese to his shores and
 boasting of his alliance with them, now ac-
 cuses them of bad faith.
 Red China, in turn, is increasingly bel-
 ligerent toward Russia, accusing the U.S.S.R.
 of all sorts of things, while the Kremlin
 casts an increasingly wary eye at the inten-
 tions of Chou En-lai and Mao Tse-tung.
 Apparently there has been a falling out
 among thieves.
 This is the weakness of gangsters, whether
 they are gangster lords of the numbers games
 or gangster nations.
 They rule only through terror and vio-
 lence.   There is no sense of honor within
 their own ranks.
 And there is room for only one at the top
 on the world of dictators.
 I learned with gratification that the re-
 cently completed Ecumenical Council in the
 Vatican consecrated two Lithuanian bishops.
 This, it seems to me, is a significant develop-
 ment for Lithuanians here and abroad.
 And I read with a great deal of interest
 that Communist masters are becoming in-
 creasingly concerned about the generation
 of young Lithuanians.
 As I understand it, they are becoming a
 touchy problem.
 It seems they just are not conforming the
 way they are supposed to.
 They refuse to be brainwashed.
 We hear there are commotions when Com-
 munist Party or governmental decisions have
 been published and when the campaign to
 explain them and enforce them is underway.
 In other words, a lot of Lithuanians just
 are not buying this business of government
 from the top down.
 Thus is history repeating itself in this
 brave country.
 Because through the ages, whether occu-
 pied by German, Polish, Swedish, or Russian
 forces,  the  people of Lithuania have re-
 mained faithful to their culture, their his-
 tory and their church.
 Every year in the House of Representatives
 many Members arise to join with you in the
 observance of the anniversary of your Inde-
 pendence Day.
 And I find one theme running through the
 remarks by my colleagues on this occasion-
 a universal respect for the character of the
 Lithuanian people.
 Today, as I am sure you knew, the largest
 Lithuanian community beyond the borders
 of your native land is here in America, with
 more than a million of your countrymen
 having been welcomed to our shores.
 Here you are giving full measure of your
 energies and talents to help us produce that
 spiritual, intellectual and material richness
 that will speed the end of bandage for all
 freedom-loving people.
 One thing the Communists either refuse
 to believe or just do not understand: that
 "Truth, crushed to earth shall rise again,"
 There is solid evidence that truth is rising
 again in Lithuania in spite of all Soviet efforts
 to keep it down.
 Our task here in this great land of freedom
 and opportunity, of blessings and bounty, is
 to make sure the people of Lithuania know
 they have a powerful and faithful friend who
 has not forgotten and will not forget their
 hopes and aspirations.
 Thank you for inviting me to take part
 in this significant occasion.
 BOXCAR  SHORTAGE  IS  YEAR-
 ROUND PROBLEM
 (Mr. LANGEN (at the request of Mr.
 BURTON of Utah) was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. LANGEN.  Mr. Speaker, the box-
 car shortage at harvesttime has grown
 into a year-round problem, and I have
 ;o uolluallu atll of uollunlls slut pall'co
 the House Interstate and Foreign Com-
 merce Committee.  I have asked the dis-
 tinguished chairman of that committee
 to request a rule on the.Senate-passed
 bill to give the Interstate Commerce
 Commission additional rate-setting pow-
 ers that would lead to an adequate sup-
 ply of boxcars in all parts of the Nation.
 This is the bill for which hearings were
 held by the House Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce Committee last fall, in which
 many of our colleagues, including myself,
 spoke in support of passage.
 The Interstate Commerce Commission
 tells me that the boxcar shortage has
 been in existence in varying degrees of
 severity for 17 years, and that the Com-
 mission would be in an excellent position
 to remedy the situation if the House joins
 the Senate in passing this bill giving the
 ICC the authority to establish reasonable
 per diem rental rates on boxcars.
 The House Committee completed the
 hearings on this bill last year, and all
 that now needs to be done is for the com-
 mittee to request a hearing from the
 Rules Committee so that the bill can
 reach the House floor for action.  I hope
 this is done without delay, so an end can
 be put to the deplorable situation that
 sees the Nation's boxcar supply decreased
 by over 2,000  cars a month.  With
 mounting international problems and
 plans to increase food shipments to
 needy nations, the United States cannot
 afford to have a further deterioration in
 the railway freight system.

 cent of the voting-age population went to
 tho polls in the November 1964  election.
 The election specified by the voting. rights
 law as the test was a presidential election.
 'o'bis usually attracts in some parts of the
 country a large percentage of voters, but just
 the opposite may happen in other parts. In
 the South, for example, where the Demo-
 eratt, party has been dominant for many
 years and the party for which the State's
 electoral votes will usually be cast has for a
 long time been a foregone conclusion, many
 citizens feel their vote would be superfluous.
 Yet the law says that in any State where
 lit:aracy "test or device" existed and the
 a
 turnout was less than 50 percent in the 1964
 presidential election, either statewide or in a
 subdivision, Federal voting examiners may
 be appointed and the tests suspended, while
 the State is penalized for a period of 5 years.
 The Supreme Court is now dealing with the
 constitutionality of these provisions, and in
 the recent arguments before the Court some
 of the Justices questioned the basis for the
 ad-percent rule.
 't'he New York City election is a conspicu-

 irrelevant the 50-percent yardstick can prove
 to be.

 Mr. CLANCY.     Mr. Speaker, it was
 with deep regret that I learned last night
 of the death of our beloved chaplain, the
 Reverend Dr. Bernard Braskamp.     In
 these troubled times we all leaned heavily
 on his spiritual guidance and inspiration.
 The prayers he offered at the opening of
 our daily sessions were filled with wisdom
 and deep concern for our Nation.
 Dr. Braskamp was a most conscienti-
 ous and devoted servant of mankind.
 His own great personal integrity, his
 loyalty and dedication have been an in-
 spiration to all of us.  I believe it is the
 universal sentiment of the House that he
 has endowed us with a spiritual enrich-
 meni; that we shall long remember.  He
 gave us renewed strength and courage in
 difficult times.
 For 40 years Dr. Braskamp served as
 paator of churches in the Washington
 area and then in 1950 assumed his duties
 with the U.S. House of Representatives
 as its f

 Mr. HALLECK.  Mr. Speaker, it was
 my recent pleasure to be invited to speak
 at an observance of the 48th anniversary
 of Lithuania's Independence Day..
 The program., held in Beverly Shores,
 Ind., was sponsored by the American-
 Lithuanian Club of Beverly Shores and
 featured. a colorful presentation of Lith-
 uanian folk songs and dances, with par-
 ticipants wearing native costumes.
 Under leave to extend my remarks I
 would like to include the observations I
 made on that occasion, Sunday, Febru-
 ary 13:
 ADDRESS DY Mr. CHAR.Lii:s A. HALL ECK
 In one sense I am happy to be with you
 today.  Happy,  particularly  to  meet  with
 you, to enjoy your friendly hospitality and
 to take part in the observance of a historic
 occasion.
 On the other hand, apart from the feeling
 of fellowship, we cannot really rejoice that
 the 48th anniversary of Lithuania's inde-
 pendence must be celebrated "in exile," so to
 speak.  We  would  all  rather,  very  much
 rather, 't'hat the situation might be other-
 wise-that we could be celebrating a con-
 tinuation. of Lithuania's independence and
 membership in the world's family of free
 nations.
 But I can say, honestly and sincerely, that
 I am proud to be here.
 I am .Flattered that you have asked me to
 be with you on this ceremony of rededication
 to the cause of Lithuania's independence.
 In a larger sense what you are doing here
 today is rededicating yourselves to the cause
 of freedom for all mankind,.
 You are demonstrating your opposition to
 tyranny In whatever form.
 Certainly nobody knows better the mean-
 ing of the words "freedom" and "tyranny"
 than the Lithuanian people.
 Throughout their  difficult  history  they
 have had to take up arms against invading
 armies.
 To the people of your gallant nation, tyr-
 anny is not just a word found in speeches.
 It is a real and terrible experience.
 By the same  token, to  the Lithuanian
 people freedom is not something to be taken
 for granted, like the air we breathe,
 Freedom is something for which they have
 for centuries fought and died.
 Let's review a little history.
 Forty-eight years ago, almost to the day,
 the Lithuanian nation proclaimed its inde-
 pendence.  This marked the survival of this
 country, with its long history and rich tradi-
 tions, in spite of more than a century in the
 hands of the Russian czars.
 Reborn in the midst of World War I, Lith-
 uania was able to assert her independence
 only after Soviet troops, which had moved
 into her territory, had been driven out with
 Allied help.
 On July 20, 1920, in a treaty with Lith-
 uania, the Soviet Government declared "the
 right of all nations to free self-determina-
 tion" and, on this basis, recognized "the
 sovereign rights and independence of the
 Lithuanian state."
 The Soviet Government further renounced
 for all time "all the sovereign rights of Rus-
 sia over the Lithuanian people and their ter-
 ritory."
 During the two decades of Lithuanian in-
 dependence which followed, the Soviet Gov-
 ernment reiterated these pledges in other
 agreements  with  the  Lithuanian  Govern-
 ment.
 As late as October 1939, while forcing Lith-
 uania to sign a "mutual assistance pact,"
 the U.S.S.R. claimed to guarantee Lithuania's
 independence.
 By that time, as we now know, the Soviets
 had already reached secret agreemnts with
 Nazi Germany under which the Baltic States
 were to fall within the Soviet sphere of in-
 fluence.
 Thus Lithuania, as so many times before,
 had again become a pawn on the chessboard
 of European power politics.
 By the summer of 1940 Lithuania had been
 occupied by Soviet troops and, after rigged
 elections during July of that year, the coun-
 try was incorporated into the Soviet Union.
 And, as we all know, "incorporated" means
 that Lithuania was declared to be an integral
 part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Re-
 publics.
 It is not merely a satellite country, but has
 been totally swallowed up, with not even the
 pretense of a separate nation.
 Thus did the  Communists betray their
 earlier promise to recognize the sovereign
 rights and independence of the Lithuanian
 state.  It was typical of Soviet treachery.
 Everyone recognized that the claim of self-
 determination was pure fiction--an insult
 to 'the intelligence of all loyal Lithuanians.
 The United States was quick to denounce
 this illegal act and has consistently refused
 to  recognize  the  forced  incorporation  of
 Lithuania into the U.S.S.R.
 And in spite of the walls behind which
 the Soviet Union seeks to hide it, we know
 that the Lithuanian people have not accepted
 the denial of their independence.
 I recall that some years back, a committee
 of the House of Representatives exposed the
 Soviet use of deportation, persecution, and
 economic exploitation in an effort to con-
 solidate its control of Lithuania.
 But none of these actions has destroyed
 the enduring will of the Lithuanian people
 for freedom  and  independence.  In short,
 the U.S.S.R. has been unable to either "Rus-
 sianize" or "Sovietize" the Lithuanian peo-
 ple.                                                                                                                      I know that you are not surprised at
 this.
 Nor do I think that anyone who knows
 the character of the Lithuanian people is
 surprised that a nation which has produced
 such great champions of liberty as Mindau-
 gus and Vytautas the Great-and which got
 the sweet taste of freedom under President
 Smetona-refuses to forget its own history.
 We are not surprised that a people as vig-
 orously independent as the Lithuanians re-
 fuses to submit to forced "collectivization."
 Nor are we surprised that such a deeply
 religious people refuses to renounce God..
 And we are not surprised that a people
 with such a rich and distinct ethnic and
 cultural background and tradition refuses
 stoutly to even pretend to be "Slavic."
 In a word, the free world is not surprised
 at the courage of the Lithuanian people now
 struggling under the stifling hand of corn-
 munism, or at their determination to one
 day regain the independence they have tern-
 porarily lost.
 For history has demonstrated, time and
 again, that Lithuania is a nation with a
 fighting heart.
 But I have an idea I know who Is sur-
 prised: the rulers in the Kremlin.
 Because they have failed to destroy the
 Lithuanian nation as a distinct people.
 For that Is exactly what the Red regime
 has tried to do.
 But  all  of  the  well-known  Communist
 techniques-from use of outright force and
 terror to   sly propaganda  and  "re-educa-
 tion"-have not succeeded in subverting the
 Lithuanian character or in destroying the
 Lithuanians' sense of Identity and love of
 freedom.

 [From the Wheeling (W. Va.) News-Register,
 Feb. 21, 1966]
 WHERE THE REAL DANGER LIES
 In arguing for the administration's stand
 in Vietnam, Secretary of State Dean Rusk
 constantly seeks to draw a parallel between
 Vietnam and the war against Hitler, thus
 arousing all the complex emotions bound up
 with World War II and its aftermath.
 Yet any analogy between an international
 war precipitated by a dictator's career of
 brazen territorial conquest, and the conse-
 quences of a social revolution arising from
 the ashes of colonialism, is utterly false.
 There has been aggression in Vietnam, we
 admit.  But the essential facts are that an
 indigenous national revolution began there
 during the Japanese occupation, that under
 Communist leadership the revolution swept
 away French colonial rule, that to fill the
 vacuum   an  international  agreement  was
 reached at   Geneva  providing for military
 neutralization and self-determination for all
 of Vietnam, and that the United States then
 set out to upset the Geneva pacts by estab-
 lishing a military satellite in South Vietnam.
 North Vietnam's response, first by supply-
 ing and training guerrillas and then by send-
 ing in its own troops, was certainly aggres-
 sive, but it was above all a response.  To
 equate it with Hitler's aggressions across na-
 tional frontiers is a spurious debating tac-
 tic and nothing more.  Were the two situa-
 tions comparable, the United States would
 have no trouble winning support and sym-
 pathy from the overwhelming majority of
 U.N. members, as we did in resisting a gen-
 uine case of internationally indicated aggres-
 sion in Korea.  Support and sympathy in the
 U.N. on Vietnam is something we conspicu-
 ously do not enjoy.
 As long as Mr. Rusk and others high in the
 administration insist on distorting and mis-
 representing the true facts of this situation
 the greater the chances of an even wider war
 at the expense of thousands of American
 lives.
 If we will stop confusing the containment
 of China with the containment of commu-
 nism, we will understand that the best bar-
 rier to Chinese national ambitions is the
 indigenous nationalism of southeast Asia-
 which Ho  Chi  Minh represents in Hanoi
 whether we like it or not, and which  a
 neutralized coalition regime could represent
 in Saigon.
 Some fear that if we left it to the Vietnam-
 ese to make their own choice the two Viet-
 nams might later be reunified under Commu-
 nist control.  This is not at all certain.  Yet
 even a Communist Vietnam, truly expressive
 of popular aspirations and militarily neutral-
 ized under Russian, American, and perhaps
 U.N. guarantees, could stabilize the area far
 better than an open-ended American military
 commitment which generates its own insta-
 bility.                    The issue is not one of  ideology,
 but native, anticolonlial revolution.
 The real danger in the administration's
 blind position with Vietnam is the general-
 izing of this particular adventure into a doc-
 trine of counterrevolutionary responsibility.
 To say that we have a duty to wage a war of
 antiliberation  wherever  the  Communists
 choose to wage a war of liberation is to ful-
 fill their own prophecy for them.                      America
 has in fact no obligation to police the world
 against social uprisings, and could not do
 so if it tried. Whatever the   outcome in
 southeast Asia, let us avoid being trapped by
 Marxist dogma into  accepting a role the
 Marxists invent for us,

 VIETNAM RAISES QUESTION OF WHO's
 BEING CONTAINED
 Assuming even that South Vietnam's Gov-
 ernment is prepared to initiate the desirable
 and necessary reforms outlined by President
 Johnson at Honolulu, no one should get the
 idea that the war will suddenly terminate.
 To begin with, Laos received, under the
 Kennedy administration, more aid per capita
 than any other country.  Yet, as Arthur M.
 Schlesinger, in his recent book makes clear,
 "Laos simply did not have the national or so-
 cial structure to absorb the remorseless flood
 of American bounty."    South Vietnam, of
 course,. is considerably worse off than Laos
 ever was.
 And in the second place, the assumption
 that Marshal Ky's privileged regime is an-
 xious to spread the wealth around ranks on
 a par with the assumption West Virginia's
 Board of Public Works is panting to sup-
 port  executive  budget  and  short  ballot
 amendments.  By this time Americans
 should have realized the vested elite, home
 or abroad, never surrenders prerogatives and
 powers voluntarily.
 "There are" said the New York Times,
 about a week ago, "no shortcuts out of the
 Vietnamese morass."
 Indeed, if there were, the world may rest
 assured President Johnson long ago would
 have discovered them and acted upon them.
 The President, whose political antenna, in
 any event, is as sensitive as any man's, is
 well aware of the divisive force the Vietnam
 war has become in our society and what that
 division can do to wreck consensus govern-
 ment.
 To quote the Times again:
 "The United States is in for a long, hard,
 more costly, and more dangerous war."
 France  found this  out during the  late
 1940's and early 1950's.
 Unwilling to learn from France's bitter
 lesson, apparently the United States must
 suffer through a similar harsh experience.
 Despite advice from every acknowledged
 Far Eastern expert, including General Mac-
 Arthur, that the United States has no busi-
 ness getting bogged down in a land war on
 the Asian Continent, the United States is
 now in a full-scale land war on that con-
 tinent and daily pouring additional Ameri-
 can lives down a vast, bottomless maw.
 The war is being pursued and carried out
 largely on the advice of diplomats and mili-
 tarists who have consistently and unerring-
 ly erred in their predictions as to what was
 required to win the war and who have yet
 to admit they and their panaceas have been
 everlastingly wrong.
 The eternal excuse for failure has been
 not  enough.  Not  enough  firepower  was
 brought to bear, not enough bombs were
 dropped, not enough of the right targets
 were hit, not enough American troops were
 committed to South Vietnam's defense, not
 enough of our allies have wakened to the
 seriousness of the situation, not enough re-
 solve has been demonstrated by the United
 States to convince Hanoi and the Vietcong
 of  our  purpose  in Vietnam.   Always not
 enough-never a doubt that no matter what
 is tried or how much is waggered in materiel
 and  in  manpower,  the  bet    may  not  be
 enough to counter the stakes shoved in by
 the other side.
 Thus, the United States has been gradu-
 ally and steadily upping the ante..
 In a brief 3 years its complement of troops
 has risen from about 25,000 to more than
 200,000.  Within 6 months thousands addi-
 tional cannon fodder will have been trans-
 ported across the Pacific by boat or air.  In
 fact, the same brilliant tacticians who've
 recommended  covering all bets  are today
 cautiously proclaiming that some time dur-
 ing 1967 the United States will need and will
 have 600,000 youngsters fighting for the
 fatherland in Vietnam.
 This is what our foreign policy of the last
 18 years is leading to.  This is the policy
 known as containment, conceived under Sec-
 retary of State Dean Acheson, continued un-
 der Secretary of State John Dulles, and still
 chugging along under Secretary of State
 3587
 Dean.Rusk.  Somehow, isn't it time someone
 asked the question:
 "Who's being contained-them or us?"
 TVA BRIDGE ACT
 (Mr. BROCK (at the request of Mr.
 BURTON of Utah) was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. BROCK.  Mr. Speaker, I am in-
 troducing today legislation which would
 amend the TVA Bridge Act to provide
 for the alteration, reconstruction, or re-
 location by the Tennessee Valley Au-
 thority of certain highway and railroad
 bridges.
 This amendment is necessary to give
 the authority to use appropriated funds
 to the TVA in order to raise, widen, or
 reconstruct bridges which have become
 obstructions to navigation on the Ten-
 nessee River and its tributaries.  There
 are several points where bridge altera-
 tions would permit more effective use of
 the waterway but especially important
 is the Tennessee State Highway 58
 bridge  over  the Hiwasee River, near
 Charleston and Calhoun, Tenn. When
 this bridge was originally constructed
 there was little prospect of great water
 traffic. Now,  however,  the Hiwasee
 services a tremendous industrial com-
 plex, including a giant Bowaters paper-
 mill and an Olin Matheison plant. The
 TVA has deepened the present channel
 to accommodate present and potential
 traffic but the full benefits of this vital
 waterway cannot be fully realized until
 bottlenecks have been removed.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge members of the
 Public Works Committee to favorably
 consider this important legislation.
 NEED FOR BAIL REFORM
 (Mr. SCHWEIKER (at the request of
 Mr. BURTON of Utah) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. SCHWEIKER.  Mr. Speaker, a
 short time ago the attention of the coun-
 try was focused upon an incident that
 happened in Pennsylvania involving 19-
 year-old Tyrone Collins, who, while free
 on $500 bail pending the trial of an as-
 sault charge in Mobile, Ala., moved to his
 new home in Pennsylvania in alleged
 violation of the conditions of his bail.
 Alabama bondsmen, without the aid of
 Pennsylvania law enforcement authori-
 ties, or any search or arrest warrant or
 any other judicial process, summarily
 removed Collins from his home in Nor-
 ristown, Pa., by force during the middle
 of the night and, without the interposi-
 tion of any judicial authority, removed
 him some 1,000 miles away to Alabama.
 The country was shocked, not because
 it felt that Tyrone Collins should not
 have to stand trial on the charge levied
 against him by the authorities of the
 State of Alabama, but because of the
 procedures employed by the bondsmen to
 return Collins to Alabama. The decision
 of private citizens, motivated simply by
 a desire to protect their financial invest-
 ment, using summary action and force to

 .abduct their quarry from the domain of
 I lie sovereignty of the Commonwealth of
 Pennsylvania to a distant part of the
 -ountry, without any judicial sanction
 ;?ttd consequently without any assurance
 of  procedural  due process, was more
 ti gall most people believed tolerable. Yet,
 ;v.cording to longstanding court deci-
 sions, what happened in the Collins case
 was not proscribed by the due process
 !.uarantees of the Constitution, nor by
 sly other provision of Federal law.
 'a'lfe Collins incident brought to light a
 situation not generally known to the
 'ublic: that at common law a bondsman
 possesses the power to take a bailee into
 custody summarily at any time and re-
 turn him to the authorities who initially
 sanctioned  his  release,  and that this
 ;lower may be exercised even when the
 l,ailee has fled to another State or juris-
 o iction.  Virtually no restriction is placed
 ii-)0n what the bondsman may do to ef-
 ti'etuate this return.                      There need be no
 rurllpliance with State arrest procedures,
 with procedures securing persons against
 unreasonable searches and seizures, or
 with  any  requirement    that  a  person
 Laken from one State to another without
 his consent be given a judicial hearing
 on the reasonableness of the removal.
 I u short. the bondsman can act without
 the sanction of any State or Federal
 tribunal.  This common law rule is still
 I tie law today.
 Not only had the integrity and sov-
 u reignty of the Commonwealth of Penn-
 ssylvania been flaunted by what had hap-
 tinned, but it was also apparent that
 there  had been,  at least by  modern
 standards,  a  violation  of individual
 rights that in analogous circumstances
 could never legally occur. It was evident
 that this situation could no longer be
 l.stler.ated. No longer could society con-
 done a philosophy that regarded the
 Bailee as nothing more than the bonds-
 uian s chattel-a mere piece of property
 l.hat the bondsman-owner could abuse
 iii any way without answering to the law
 for his actions.
 The irony of t.tir' Collins situation was
 made all the more poignant by the fact
 that when the State officials request the
 t el,urn of a fugitive from justice who has
 taken refuge in another State, they com-
 ply with very strict procedures, speci-
 tiied by article IV, section 2, clause 2 of
 the Constitution, which utilize the exec-
 utive authority of the refuge or asylum
 Mate for taking the fugitive into custody.
 Only after the fugitive has been given a
 hearing in the asylum State by the au-
 thorities of that State, and it has been
 determined that he has left the jurisdic-
 tion. of the demanding State in violation
 old law, can the fugitive be turned over
 t , the authorities who seek his return to
 the State whence he originally fled.  If
 it  public official must go through this
 sort of procedure to get back a person
 who is already a convicted criminal, how
 strange it was, people thought, that a
 private person, owing no allegiance and
 =.o sense of public duty to any State au-
 thority, answerable to nothing but his
 own conscience-, could ignore such pro-
 vedures in seizing= an individual who
 was not a criminal but simply an ac-
 cused, presumed by the law to be inno-
 cent of the charges pending against hint.
 Recognizing that something should be
 done, I resolved to correct this state of
 affairs, so as to make bail bondsmen sub-
 ject to minimum standards of procedural
 due process, as are State authorities in
 comparable situations.
 Accordingly, I have introduced a bill,
 which has also been introduced in the
 Satiate by Senator TYDINCS and is being
 cosponsored by several of hilt; colleagues,
 which will provide for the implementa-
 tion                                                          of  these minimum  standards  in
 cases such as that involving Tyrone Col-
 lins..                                                          In formulating the content of the
 bill, we were fortunate to have the coun-
 sel and advice of Mr. Ronald Goldfarb,
 a noted authority on bail problems,
 whose recent book., "Ransom," pointed
 out the need for reform in this area.
 ;Simply stated, the main provisions of
 the bill I have introduced are these:
 "irst, when a bondsman seeks the re-
 turn to another jurisdiction of a person
 who has violated the conditions of his
 bail, the bondsman must apply to a ju-
 dicial officer of the United States-either
 a  ;Federal  judge  or  a  U.S.  Commis-
 sioner-for a warrant authorizing the
 taking into custody of the fugitive bailee.
 Second, if the bondsman is able to
 show probable cause     that the person
 named in the warrant application has
 violated the terms and conditions of his
 bail, the :judicial officer shall issue the
 warrant, and the person is to be brought
 promptly before the judicial officer for
 a hearing.
 'I'llird, at the hearing, the fugitive
 bailee is to be informed of the nature and
 purpose of the proceeding against him,
 of his right to retain counsel, of his right
 not to make a .statement, and of the fact
 that any statement made by him may he
 used against him.  He also is to be given
 reasonable opportunity to consult coun-
 sel.
 Fourth, at the hearing the bondsman
 must establish that the identity of the
 alleged fugitive bailee is as he asserts,
 that the bondsman and the fugitive are
 in a bail relationship, and that the con-
 ditions of bail imposed to secure the
 fugitive's appearance in a future ju-
 dicial proceeding have been broken.
 Fifth, if the necessary showing is nlacle
 at the hearing, the judicial officer is to
 issue a warrant for removal of the fugi-
 tive bailee, promptly and directly, to the
 appropriate authorities of the jurisdic-
 tion whence he has fled.
 Sixth, violation of these procedures by
 the bondsman is made a Federal crime,
 punishable by a fine of up to $5,000, or
 imprisonment of up to 2 years, or both.
 It is my hope that this legislation will
 receive the prompt attention of both
 Houses of Congress and that hearings
 will be held at the earliest possible date.
 I invite my colleagues on both sides of
 the aisle to join me in this effort. to
 remedy a long-standing and  grievous
 flaw in the pattern of existing law.

 AN ALABAMA INVASION
 We are glad that Tyrone Collins has been
 res bored to his family in Norristown after a
 harrowing experience with two Alabama. bail
 bondsmen during the previous week.  It was
 quite a Christmas story.
 And it is to be assumed, of course, that
 with the proper recourse to proper legal pro-
 cedures, he will yet answer whatever boon
 fide charges may be facing him in Mobile.
 In any event, it should be made clear that
 Pennsylvania is net in the business of being
 a refuge for persons wanted in out-of-Suite
 courts.
 Nevertheless, the manner in which young
 Collins was virtually kidnaped from his liome
 a week ago by the two bondsmen-in a man-
 Iicr  too  reminiscent  of  old-time  bounty-
 hunters---was such an outrageous infringe-
 ment of the laws and procedures of this
 Commonwealth that it should not be forgot-
 ten or brushed aside.
 Representative RICHARD S. SclrwEruEa, Tie-
 publican, of Pennsylvania in whose district
 the highly illegal "grab" was made, has in-
 terested himself rightly in this case since
 the start and is intent not only on investiga-
 tion but corrective legislation, if it is needed,
 in Congress.  In view of the appearance of
 an armed invasion of this sovereign State by
 citizens of Alabama, which the Collins case
 presents, it is evident that some very specific
 legislation may be required.
 In Alabama bail. bondsmen may riot need
 warrants in "hot pursuit" of their quarry,
 but in Pennsylvania they do.   We expect
 visiting bondsmen-or law officials, for that
 matter-to abide by this Commonwealth's
 rules of procedure when they are in this
 jurisdiction.  It does not seem much to ask--
 but if it requires Federal law to make the
 point, then let us have such a law on the
 books.

 TnE COLLINS CASE LESSON
 A. rap on the door on a Sunday night.  Men
 bursting in to snap handcuffs on a suspect-
 men men with the effrontery to demand money
 from a mother, "if you want this boy to eat."
 Then a trip of hundreds of miles to put a
 bail bond jumper named Tyrone Collins back
 in Alabama.
 Such  tactics  are  repellant  to  Pennsyl-
 vanians' sense of fair play.                                                                                                                                      They sound too
 much like the gestapo, or the Soviet secret
 police. Therefore there was instant indigna-
 tion in this part of the country when Tyrone
 Collins was grabbed at his Norristown home
 by representatives of a Mobile bonding firm.
 Not only the NAACP was outraged; thousands
 of Pennsylvanians felt the same, including
 a  Congressman,  a  Governor,  an  attorney
 general.
 The charge on which young Collins pre-
 sumably skipped bond was serious enough---
 knifing a fellow high school student.  It de-
 veloped that this was not the only charge
 against him.  He had racked up two counts
 of driving without a license since his return
 to Norristown.  But though it began to look
 as if Collins was not the ideal teenager, the
 idea of bail bondsmen breaking and enter-
 ing, without a warrant, still was repugnant.
 Surprisingly enough, some legal experts dug
 into their books and read them to say that
 the bondsmen were legally right.
 There is, therefore, a lesson in the case of
 Tyrone Collins, though perhaps not wh-,-A it
 first seemed to be.  The point is that Amner-
 ica's laws  on return of bail skippers are
 primitive and  need  statutory  correction.
 Certainly, no felon ought to be given refuge
 merely because he crosses a State line; but a
 man on bail is not yet tried, and therefore is
 presumed to be innocent.  An orderly, legal
 procedure ought to be necessary before he
 can be dragged out of a home at night.  The
 Collins case makes the need for revised laws
 evident.

 to be determined by the service Secretary on
 a case-by-case basis, taking into account
 professional training requirements for doc-
 tors and availability of beds in civilian hos-
 pitals in the area.  (The Rivers subcommit-
 tee had recommended 10 to 20 percent of
 new beds for retirees and I understand this
 is what the Surgeons General prefer.)
 At age 65, retirees who, are eligible for so-
 cial security medical care would be trans-
 ferred to that program.  Those not eligible
 under social security would continue in the
 military retiree program.
 In provisions not related to retirees, the
 bill also provides outpatient care to active
 duty dependents and long-term care for re-
 tarded children of military personnel.  Both
 are new benefits, and both are extremely
 worthwhile.
 The program would cost about $120 million
 in fiscal year 1968, its first full year of oper-
 ation, and could be expected to rise gradu-
 ally to an annual cost of about $190 million.
 Now, of course, I don't want to prejudge
 the legislation before our subcommittee has
 had a chance to consider it.  But it has some
 obviously attractive features.  Some retiree
 beds would continue to be programed in mili-
 tary facilities.  Retirees would get a program
 of care  in civilian facilities for the  first
 time, and those who live far from a military
 hospital would no longer be denied this im-
 portant benefit.
 Some of the other provisions are going to
 take careful study.  The social security med-
 ical care supplemental program has some
 features, such as nursing care, which are not
 available under the Dependent Medicare Act.
 These may prove desirable to military re-
 tirees.  On the other hand, we are going to
 have to take a close look at cost to see the
 individual is not charged more at a time in
 life when he is least able to pay.
 The provision for higher charges for those
 with less than 30 years service is also going
 to need close scrutiny.  With so many laws
 designed to encourage retirement before 30
 years,  there  may be serious  questions  of
 equity as well as problems in administering
 the provision.
 Speaking personally, I cannot approve the
 section which establishes higher priority of
 availability of medical facilities for 30-year
 retirees than' those with less than 30 years.
 I can justify a reduced deductible payment
 for the 30-year retiree because he has con-
 tributed of himself for a longer period.  But
 as long as we have laws which allow retire-
 ment at less than 30 yea' s, I cannot discrim-
 inate against any retiree on the basis of
 availability of hospital facilities.   When a
 retiree is sick, a hospital bed should be
 avaliableperiod-whether  he  served  20
 years or 40.
 The Department of Defense has created
 discrimination against some retirees with its
 ill-advised recomputation system-let's not
 create another type of discrimination.
 But these are details to be worked out.
 The important thing is to have a bill the
 executive branch supports that we can shape
 into acceptable legislation.
 Admittedly, this bill is quite different from
 the legislation I first introduced on the sub-
 ject which was based on a program proposed
 by the Fleet Reserve Association.  But, as I
 indicated, that was meant to be a catalyst.
 Frankly, I am not so concerned with the
 method as with the principle.  We never get
 everything that all of us want in any one
 bill. But what is important is to prvolde for
 all of our retirees an assured program of
 care, one that cannot wither away because of
 administrative neglect.
 We are in a time when the Government
 is making an enormous effort to improve the
 health of all citizens.  Most of you will prob-
 ably be quite surprised to hear that our an-
 nual  Government  expenditure  for  health
 programs of all types is in the neighbor-
 hood of $7 billion.                                 in the face of that
 gigantic national commitment, it is simply
 unthinkable that we would let lapse the
 medical benefits of military retirees that
 have been provided for over 100 years.
 Finally, and most important of all, we must
 reinstill in the hearts of all our retirees faith
 in their Government's promises, faith that
 when  their  Government  pledges  them  a
 benefit it will never be taken away.
 The moral obligation of the Government
 to keep its word to individual military men
 is more important than any amount of dol-
 lars involved.   I believe                                                            that during  the
 recomputation fight and I believe it now.
 And this time, I think we are going to win.
 COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES FOR
 SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS
 (Mr. SHRIVER (at the request of Mr.
 BURTON of Utah) was granted permission
 to extend his remarks at this point in
 the RECORD and to include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. SHRIVER.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 today introduced legislation to provide
 cost-of-living increases in the benefits
 paid under the Social Security Act.
 My bill would provide an automatic 3
 percent increase in benefits whenever the
 Consumer Price Index reflects a similar
 increase in the cost of living. I am advo-
 cating these cost-of-living adjustments
 to social security payments because cost
 studies by the Department of Health,
 Education and Welfare indicate that this
 method, alone,, among all the proposals
 for reasonable improvements in benefits
 can be accomplished without further in-
 crease in social security taxes.
 The actuarial studies show that the
 growth of the economy would provide
 the necessary revenues to provide cost-
 of-living adjustments.
 Mr. Speaker, the most effective action
 we could take to protect the earning
 power of those living on fixed incomes
 would be to stop Government-stimulated
 inflation which reduces the value of their
 dollars. Unfortunately, the administra-
 tion has not demonstrated any inclina-
 tion to hold-the-line on deficit spending.
 We, therefore, should make a strong ef-
 fort to protect older Americans from the
 loss of income because of factors beyond
 their control.
 From 1958 until the most recently
 enacted increase in social security bene-
 fits, recipients suffered a 7 percent loss
 in buying power. The bill I have intro-
 duced would prevent such loss of pur-
 chasing power in the future.
 There are other changes which should
 be considered in the present social secu-
 rity system. One of these is a bill which
 I introduced during the first session of
 the 89th Congress.  It is H.R. 7340, a
 proposal to pay 100 percent of primary
 benefit to widows under the Social Secu-
 rity Act.                                                                         I urge that consideration be
 given to this legislation at an early date.

 (Mr. ELLSWORTH (at the request of
 Mr. BURTON of Utah) was granted per-
 mission to extend his remarks at this
 point in the RECORD and to include ex-
 traneous matter.)
 Mr. ELLSWORTH.  Mr. Speaker, I
 have introduced today a House joint
 resolution to authorize the President to
 issue annual proclamations designating
 the Sunday of each year immediately
 preceding February 22-the anniversary
 of the birthday of George Washington-
 as Freedom Sunday, and to designate the
 calendar week of each year during which
 February 22 occurs, as Freedom Week.
 For some years, Freedom Week has
 been celebrated by the members of Ser-
 toma International.  This Is an organ-
 ization of business, professional and agri-
 cultural men who have come together in
 bonds of personal friendship-united in
 dedication to service of their commu-
 nities.  Sertoma, which has over 450
 clubs throughout the United States,
 Canada, and Mexico, derives its name
 from the organization's slogan, "Service
 to Mankind."
 Many Sertoma Clubs in the State of
 Kansas have visited schools this week,
 distributing to_ each student a copy of
 our Declaration of Independence.  Cer-
 tainly it is right and proper that Amer-
 ica's young people be instilled with a
 sense of national heritage.
 It is also proper that all Americans
 everywhere be given the opportunity to
 celebrate a week each year as a tribute
 t
 o,i+lis same national freedom heritage.

 SHORTAGES IN VIETNAM
 (Mr. LATTA (at the request of Mr.
 BURTON of Utah) was granted permis-
 sion to extend his remarks at this point
 in the RECORD and to Include extraneous
 matter.)
 Mr. LATTA.  Mr. Speaker, the ever-
 lengthening list of shortages being suf-
 fered by our fighting men in Vietnam is,
 in my opinion, a national disgrace and
 this Congress should investigate them
 forthwith.  I believe these critical short-
 ages can no longer be swept under the
 rug and ignored by this Congress.  They
 have now become common knowledge to
 the parents of our servicemen serving in
 Vietnam and they are demanding to
 know why these shortages exist when we
 have been spending approximately one-
 half of our Nation's total budget for de-
 fense and related items.  When one con-
 siders the staggering expenditures of the
 Department of Defense over the past cou-
 ple of years, our fighting men in Vietnam
 should be the best equipped soldiers ever
 sent into battle. Instead, reports indi-
 cate that they are not only unbelievably
 Ill equipped, but are improperly fed. It
 has been reported that until recently,
 an estimated 70 percent of our troops in
 Vietnam  were  eating, C-rations  as' a
 steady diet because of food shortages and
 the shortage of food-storage facilities.
 Soldiers from my district are writing
 home, as I am sure they are from every
 Congressman's district, asking their fam-
 ilies to mail them such essentials as jun-
 gle boots, fatigues, underwear, socks, and
 so forth.  The New York Times of Mon-
 day, February 21, 1966, verified the needs
 of our fighting men when it revealed:
 Shortages of winter and summer uniforms,
 overcoats, raincoats, fatigues, jungle boots,
 underwear, socks, and other items are widely
 reported.  The Army has reduced consider-
 ably the normal amount of clothig initially

 NASSER       RETREATS  FROM       HIS
 PEACE PLEDGE
 The SPEAKER pro tempore.        Under
 previous order of the House, the gentle-
 man from New York [Mr. HALPERN) IS
 recognized for 15 minutes.
 Mr. HALPERN.  Mr. Speaker, I have
 read with great disappointment that
 President Nasser, in a recent speech at
 the University of Cairo, rejuvenated his
 warlike stance vis-a-vis the Yemen.
 This recent speech by President Nasser,
 wherein he threatened to maintain his
 Yemen intervention, contrary to treaty
 provisions, contradicts the widely voiced
 optimism that has reigned for some
 months.
 President Nasser is quoted in this
 morning's New York Times as having
 said:
 if anyone thinks we have become tired be-
 cause we have stayed in Yemen so long, let
 me say that we are a struggling nation, a
 fighting nation, a patient nation.  We can
 stay in Yemen for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, or
 even 5.
 Thus it appears that the Jiddah agree-
 ment, which provided for a staged with-
 drawal of Egyptian troops from Yemen,
 is threatened.  Nasser excused his bel-
 ligerence by pointing to the sale of Amer-
 ican Patton tanks to Israel, and claiming
 that conservative, reactionary forces in
 the Middle East, goaded by Western pow-
 ers, were bent upon countering his in-
 fluence and even plotting against his life.
 These are charges which, due to lack of
 adequate, firsthand knowledge, I can
 neither substantiate or reject.
 But in the first instance, I cannot un-
 derstand how 200 Patton tanks added to
 Israel's defenses could possibly, in a seri-
 ous way, undermine the security of
 Egypt, In view of that country's massive
 procurement of Communist arms.
 I am inclined to believe that President
 Nasser Is an inherently suspicious ruler,
 intemperate, and not to be trusted. Per-
 haps it is impossible to find the opposite
 in the Middle East, a region perpetually
 upset by extreme political shifts, per-
 sonal feuds, and contradictory ambitions.
 The truth is that it is foolish to expect,
 through aid commitments, that Ameri-
 can policy can effectively influence the
 realities in the Arab world.
 The Jiddah conference was an Arab
 initiative. It seemed that President Nas-
 ser had faced the hurtful consequences
 of his intervention, and had concluded
 that nothing useful could be gained by
 continuing a war which showed little
 prospect of political advantage or mili-
 tary victory.
 This was the opinion expressed to me
 by many people.
 I must say, however, that this tenuous
 supposition hardly justified the renewed
 aid agreement with the United Arab Re-
 public, which was undertaken during the
 congressional recess and in spite of
 clearly understood congressional senti-
 ment.  The Jiddah accord spurred the
 optimists onward.
 As I review recent history, I have come
 to doubt the wisdom of buying Influence,
 particularly in an area of unique Insta-
 bility of constantly shifting loyalties.
 Under the present circumstances, the
 United States is not justified under any
 pretext to render agricultural assistance
 to Egypt, when such assistance merely
 facilitates foreign intervention.. Unless
 the United Arab Republic fulfills its
 treaty obligations with respect to the
 Yemen, we should not be expected to
 honor an aid commitment which the re-
 cipient can use to underwrite its hostile
 exertions.
 Past American attempts to curb Nas-
 ser's obsession with foreign troublemak-
 ing have repeatedly failed. Officially, we
 have been setting unreal expectations.
 I cannot agree with the State Depart-
 ment that we are, in consequence of our
 generosity, gaining any so-called lever-
 age over the course of events.  In any
 case, these are not, in substance, for us
 to determine.  It is contradictory to as-
 sist a developing nation which expends
 its meager resources on external adven-
 ture, intrigue, and excessive arms pro-
 curement.
 The United Arab Republic has been
 spending millions of dollars to support
 its Yemini venture.  Additional millions
 have gone to arms purchases, for the
 stated reason of contending with the so-
 .called Israeli threat, but actually used as
 an instrument to bolster the power and
 prestige of Nasser's Egypt as against real
 and potential Arab rivals.  It does not
 seem to me that this is a particularly
 promising field for the projection of
 American influence and, indeed, our
 mingling in this uncertainty may actually
 damage our cause.  I thoroughly agree
 that it is in,our national interest to sup-
 port a balance of power in this troubled
 area, especially in view of Israel's threat-
 ened existence.  But I doubt earnestly
 that this can be accomplished through
 periodic efforts to court the favor of in-
 consistent personalities.  In any case,
 we invariably wind up in a very ambig=
 uous, and often embarrassing, position.
 If honest self-help is the new look
 in our foreign aid program, then per-
 haps we should take a longer view of
 Egypt.
 President Nasser's recent threat to
 break the Jiddah agreement underlines
 the insurmountable contingencies with
 which, by force of our policy, we are faced
 with in the Middle East.  It is an
 anxious warning to all who would place
 their trust too quickly and none too
 wisely.
 I must add, Mr. Speaker, that it is par-
 ticularly curious, and most discouraging,
 that Nasser's words came on the eve of
 Mr. Anwar el Sadat's good-will visit to
 this country.  I fail to see what can be
 won through recourse to bluster and
 threats to the peace, lacking both va-
 lidity and commonsense.

 (Mr. GALLAGHER asked and was
 given permission. to address the House
 for 1 minute and to revise and extend
 his remarks.)
 Mr.   GALLAGHER.  Mr.   Speaker,
 among the many statements which ap-
 peared on George Washington's Birth-
 day, there was one which particularly
 caught my attention because it shows
 what history still has to teach us.
 In the New York Journal American an
 editorial quotes these words of our first
 President at the time of the Revolution:
 I am under more apprehension on account
 of our dissensions, than the effort of the
 enemy.
 As the Journal American pointed out,
 those deeply concerned words could just
 as well have been spoken by President
 Johnson today.
 We have nearly 200,000 American
 servicemen in Vietnam.  Within recent
 days, the parents, the wives, and the
 children of these men-more than half
 a million of our citizens-have been
 treated to television programs, and a few
 newspaper headlines which seem to
 imply that our boys in Vietnam do not
 have the support of American public.
 We are engaged with an enemy who
 does not believe that American public
 opinion will ultimately turn against our
 efforts in Vietnam and make it impos-
 sible for us to continue.  This is a delu-
 sion, but one which the events of the last
 few days have undoubtedly strengthened.
 Those who sincerely seek peace in Viet-
 nam must be made aware of the fact
 that every newspaper headline and every
 televised speech which feeds the delusion
 of doubt in Hanoi and Peiping serves
 only to prolong the conflict.  It is time
 to tell our soldiers and our enemy, alike,
 that the American public overwhelming-
 ly supports our objectives in Vietnam.
 Furthermore, they support overwhelm-
 ingly the policies which President John-
 son is pursuing to accomplish those ob-
 jectives.  Let us look at the facts.
 On "Meet the Press" last Sunday,
 White House aid McGeorge Bundy-who
 has been the key national security ad-
 viser to both President Kennedy and
 President Johnson-pointed out that the
 President has been acting in Vietnam
 with the greatest of restraint.  He cited
 as evidence that perhaps 10 percent of
 the public actually would like the Presi-
 dent to go farther.
 I have examined several recent opinion
 bolls on this matter, and I find that the
 figures are even higher.  Roughly one-

 the president of one of the oldest and,
 by reason of his association with it, one
 of the leading hospitals of our country.
 Blessed with the Insight of leadership,
 he chose wisely in his selection of peo-
 ple of similar purpose, energy, and con-
 cern for others.  He brought Rhode Is-
 land Hospital to the forefront of excel-
 lence in its avowed functions of quality
 patient care, education, and research to
 benefit the people of the Providence
 Plantations and the entire State.
 He developed new concepts of care for
 an institution that has provided a cen-
 tury of service to the sick and injured.
 He and Rhode Island Hospital together
 have been in the vanguard of progress for
 meeting the health needs of our State.
 Before Congress passed legislation to
 help stimulate local financing of facil-
 ities for student nurses, Rhode Island
 Hospital-recognizing the need to attract
 more qualified young women to this im-
 portant profession-constructed a nurs-
 ing arts building and a senior student
 nurses dormitory, appropriately named
 the Gerry House.
 Before Congress undertook to support
 Mr. Johnson's present master plan for
 advancing the Nation's health, Rhode
 Island Hospital faced the problem of its
 responsibility to the people of Rhode
 Island and is at this moment in process
 of developing plans for a large, 12-story
 building solely dedicated to the care of
 the ambulatory patient.  This ambula-
 tory patient center will meet the increas-
 ing need for health care at the most
 economical levels of construction expense
 and cost to the patient.
 Such are two examples of long-range
 planning which only the most progressive
 of our country's medical centers are pro-
 viding.                     By reason of leadership such as
 Mr. Gerry's, such hospitals demonstrate
 an  understanding of  Mr.  Johnson's
 theme, which he expressed recently in
 these words:
 It is imperative that we give first attention
 to our opportunities-and our obligations-
 for advancing the Nation's health.  For the
 health of  our people is, inescapably,  the
 foundation for the fulfillment of all our
 aspirations.
 Louis Cardell Gerry, in an annual re-
 port to his hospital's corporation a few
 years ago, voiced a similar concern:
 We have indeed come far.  What a comfort
 it would be to be able to stop climbing, seat
 ourselves comfortably and view our accom-
 plishments.  Such, however, is not desirable;
 it is not even possible.  We have come far, it
 is true, and although it sounds paradoxical
 we have even farther to go than ever.  As we
 progress in one area, several more areas are
 opened up. We are, in the truest sense of
 the word, in an expanding universe.       I
 McNAMARA'S CONTRADICTIONS

 of the House, the gentleman from Louisi=ana [Mr. WAOGONNER] is recognized for
 20 minutes.
 Mr. WAGGONNER. Mr. Speaker, like
 every other Member of Congress, I imag-
 ine, I am receiving an increasing number
 of letters from the district I represent
 concerning the war in Vietnam.
 I am well aware that this is a theater
 of operations 8,000 miles from our shores
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 in an area of the world where newly cre-
 ated nations abound and this, to some
 degree, contributes to the confusion
 that exists over the entire aspect of the
 war there.
 But an even greater contribution to
 the confusion and, in my opinion, the
 single most significant factor causing the
 controversy over our policy and actions
 there, is the record of contradictory
 statements for which Secretary McNa-
 mara is responsible.
 I believe as well that, because we have
 withheld the truth from the people and
 camouflaged what the situation was in
 Vietnam a year ago, that we cannot now
 show the people how much better the
 situation is today. To do so would prove
 beyond question that we did not tell the
 truth a year ago.
 I am a great believer, Mr. Speaker, in
 "the record," that chronicle of events
 made famous by Al Smith when he first
 said, "Let's look at the record."
 It is quite fashionable these days for
 officials of the Government to make one
 statement one day and then deny it the
 following day or else say something quite
 different and hope that no one will re-
 member what they said the first time.
 This is a dangerous and deplorable habit;
 particularly deplorable when it is prac-
 ticed by the Secretary of Defense.
 Secretary McNamara's statements on
 the war In Vietnam make a fascinating
 collection of confusion and contradiction
 which would be amusing if the subject
 matter were not so grave. I think it will
 serve an enlightening purpose if all his
 statements are put together in one place
 in the RECORD so future historians can
 study it.
 Let us begin with a statement he made
 on March 22, 1962. At that time, return-
 ing from a conference In the Pacific,
 McNamara told newsmen that South
 Vietnam had taken the offensive.
 Less than 2 months later, while in
 Saigon, McNamara told newsmen "there
 is no plan for introducing American
 combat troops in South Vietnam." This
 was on May 9, 1962.
 Two days later, on May 11, 1962, Mc-
 Namara said he was "tremendously en-
 couraged."
 A White House policy statement dated
 October 2, 1963, contains this statement:
 Secretary McNamara and General Taylor
 reported their judgment that the major part
 of the U.S. military task can be completed by
 the end of 1965.
 Secretary McNamara, in Honolulu on
 November 20,  1963,  announced  that
 American troops would start being with-
 rawn before the end of that year, 1963.
 he following month, Secretary Mc-
 Namara changed his mind.  He said in
 Saigon on December 21, 1963, that we
 would not go ahead with troop with-
 drawal plans.
 Another month went by before the
 Secretary delivered another pronounce-
 merit that should be made a part of the
 RECORD. After the fall of Diem, in which
 he, himself, undoubtedly had a part,
 McNamara said:
 The new government ? ? ? has consid-
 erably more support than its predecessor, and
 the military revolutionary committee is be-
 binning to take action to intensify military
 operations
 istration.
 February 23, 1966
 and to Improve civil  admin-
 Everything was corning up roses ac-
 cording to the Secretary when he testi-
 fied here on the Hill a month later, on
 January 27, 1964. At that time he said
 that most of the 15,000 U.S. troops In
 Vietnam should be withdrawn before
 1965 was over.  He said he did not be-
 lieve the United States "should assume
 the primary responsibility for the war
 in South Vietnam."
 The Secretary continued to see the
 situation  there through  rose-colored
 glasses 2 months later.  Back from his
 fourth trip to Saigon, he reported that
 the Khanh regime had "produced a
 sound central plan for the prosecution of
 the war" and that the situation "can
 be significantly improved in the coming
 months."
 Nine days later, the Secretary's opin-
 ion had taken a turn of 180 degrees. On
 March 26, 1964, he said:
 The situation in South Vietnam has un-
 questionably worsened, at least since last
 fall.
 He said also that the situation was "not
 hopeless, but not particularly optimis-
 tic."
 Three days later, however, things took
 another turn for the better. On March
 29, 1964, McNamara said:
 The training personnel we have assigned
 there will come back as their training mis-
 sion is completed.  Perhaps some can return
 this year; some next.
 The truth of the matter came from his
 own statement a month later when, on
 April  24,  1964,  he  told  newsmen
 that U.S. strength in the Vietnam area
 was on the rise. He said:
 I don't want to predict what the totals
 will be at the end of this year or at the
 end of 1965.
 On that same day, the Secretary came
 up with a real prize in this statement:
 I  don't  object  to  its  being  called
 McNamara's war.  I think it is a very im-
 portant war and I am pleased to be identified
 with it.
 Back in Saigon for another look-see,
 the Secretary was very pleased with
 what he saw.    He said:
 Excellent progress.  The plans we laid out
 in March, if they are consistently followed
 up, will work effectively.
 This was on May 13, 1964.  Back in
 Washington the next day, May 14, 1964,
 he said that "certain additional U.S. per-
 sonnel will be needed in Vietnam." Let
 us mercifully draw the curtains to denote
 the passage of 24 hours.
 On May 15, testifying again here on
 the Hill, the Secretary was reported to
 have been "gloomy" and to have said
 that the anti-Vietcong efforts had deteri-
 orated.
 Oh, "what a difference a day makes,"
 as the songwriter says.
 On August 5, 1964, the Secretary re-
 ported U.S. bombing raids against North
 Vietnam and reported "energizing" ad-
 ditional Army, Marine, Air Force, and
 antisubmarine units.
 If there is one point in this recount of
 a thoroughly shoddy situation when it
 can be said that the custard pie had hit
 the fan, it was on November 26, 1964,

 when Secretary McNamara told news-
 men they should not interview General
 Taylor because in his words:
 It would be impossible for Max to talk to
 these people without leaving the impression
 the situation is going to hell.
 Bear with me, 'Mr. Speaker.  I know
 that this recounting stretches the credi-
 bility to the snapping point, but there are
 three more "pronouncements" I would
 like to include.
 On February 18, 1965, buoyed up by
 heaven knows what, the Secretary of
 Defense said:
 The past year has also brought some en-
 couraging developments.
 Visiting in Saigon for the sixth time,
 the Secretary assayed the situation and
 delivered himself of this:
 We are no longer losing.  It will be a long
 war.
 One more quotation, Mr. Speaker, and
 I will rest my case. In December of 1965,
 Mr. McNamara said, when he returned
 from his seventh trip, that he was "su-
 prised" at the intensity of the war.
 I wish I could, like Shakespeare, leave
 him to heaven, but I cannot. This man,
 this computerized genius, is at the helm
 of our ship of war and this dreary record
 of his faltering, misunderstanding of the
 situation and the foe we face in Vietnam
 is a cause for alarm.
 If the Secretary had had confidence in
 the American people and had told them
 the truth about the situation in Vietnam
 each time I have recorded his statements,
 there would not now, be the division, the
 controversy, and the confusion which
 exists in the minds of many.
 I hope this recording serves a useful
 purpose in setting his record straight.

 Zia the beneficial interest in certain fed-
 erally owned lands heretofore set aside for
 school or administrative purposes.
 northwest Iowa.
 Since coming to the Congress last
 year, I was most pleased and proud to
 have had a series of opportunities to
 reminisce with our Chaplain about the
 heritage we both shared.  Through this
 association, I developed a strong sense of
 respect and admiration for Reverend
 Braskamp.  He typified the personal
 elements so necessary to the stature of
 the honored position he held for 16
 years. It is significant to recall that the
 position of Chaplain of the House of
 Representatives assures us that our daily
 deliberations begin with thoughts of our
 Creator-and the burden of such a re-
 sponsibility was fully carried by the man
 whose memory we honor today. The toll
 of time which placed him among my
 elders never suffered him to be anything
 but enthusiastically concerned with his
 duty to God and this honored body.
 My predecessor, the Honorable Charles
 B. Hoeven, resides in the same com-
 munity of the birthplace of Reverend
 Braskamp.  There was a great friend-
 ship and affection between these gentle-
 men, and it has been a source of real
 pride over these many years to the citi-
 zens of Alton to have a native-born son
 serve in as high a position as Chaplain
 of the U.S. House of Representatives.
 I join with all of the Members of the
 House of Representatives extending to
 the  immediate family  our  deepest
 sympathies.
 Mr. ALBERT.  Mr. Speaker, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. GREIGG.  I yield to the distin-
 guished majority leader.
 Mr. ALBERT.  Mr. Speaker, all of us
 are deeply grieved by the loss of our be-
 loved Chaplain, Rev. Bernard Braskamp.
 Only a few days ago he walked with us
 and among us In this chamber, and to-'
 night he walks with angels.
 This man of God, this noble character,
 has been our spiritual adviser and men-
 tor for 16 years.
 His was the voice of the servant of the
 Lord, adjounring us to maintain the
 added dimension of spiritual values in
 all our earthly works.  His prayers di-
 mension of spiritual values in all our
 earthly works.  His prayers often re-
 flected the mood and tempo of the
 House-its crises, its defeats, its victories.
 In every case he reminded us that these
 things shall all pass away, but the King-
 dom of the Lord shall endure forever.
 His messages were essentially messages
 of hope-as it the Christian philosophy
 itself.
 Therefore, while we sorrow at his
 passing, we are comforted by the knowl-
 edge that our friend and spiritual shep-
 herd, has gone to the just reward that
 surely awaits him.

 CONTROL  OF AIR POLLUTION
 The Clean Air Act of 1963 and its 1965
 amendments have given us new tools to
 help attack the pollution that fouls the
 air we breathe.
 We have begun to counter air pollu-
 tion by increasing the tempo of effort at
 all levels of government.
 In less than 2 years Federal financial
 =assistance has stimulated a 50-percent
 increase in the air pollution budgets of
 States and local governments.  Federal
 standards for the control of automobile
 exhausts will apply to the 1968 models.
 'J'he Federal interstate abatement pro-
 ?:ram will significantly supplement State
 and local efforts to deal with air pollu-
 tion.
 I am heartened by the progress we are
 making.  But I am mindful that we have
 only begun our work.  I am forwarding
 to the Congress proposals to improve and
 increase Federal research, financing, and
 technical assistance to help States and
 local governments take the measures
 needed to control air pollution.
 POLLUTION FROM  FEDERAL  ACTIVITIES
 The Federal Government is rightly ex-
 l:ected to provide an example to the Na-
 tion in pollution control.  We cannot
 make new demands on State and local
 governments or on private industry with-
 out putting the Federal house in order.
 We will take the necessary steps this
 year to insure that Federal activities do
 not contribute to the deterioration of
 our water and air.
 Last November I signed an Executive
 order requiring that all new Federal in-
 stallations include adequate water pollu-
 L:on control systems.  Agencies are re-
 quired to submit long-range plans to
 bring existing installations up to the
 high level of pollution control required
 of new facilities.  These plans are to be
 submitted by July 1 of this year.  We
 are providing the funds necessary to im-
 plement them.
 I also intend to issue an Executive
 order dealing with air pollution from
 h'ederal activities. The potential dangers
 of air pollution have only recently been
 realized.  The technical and economic
 difficulties in conserving the purity of
 our air are, if anything, greater than in
 protecting our water resources.  Never-
 theless, I intend to see that the necessary
 steps are taken to curtail emissions from
 Federal installations.
 :IUMAN RESOURCES FOR POLLUTION CONTROL
 New projects and new technology are of
 little value without skilled people dedi-
 cated to putting them to effective use.
 I. propose to enlist the services of those
 in industry and the universities.
 1: propose to attract skilled adminis-
 trators and scientists to the challenges of
 full-time occupations in pollution con-
 trol.
 Critical skills are in short supply in all
 public pollution control operations.  We
 need to train scientists and social scien-
 tists in these activities, and to demon-
 strate the advantages of Government
 service as a lifetime occupation.  I pro-
 pose to establish traineeships, fellow-
 ships, and an internship program in Fed-
 eral pollution control  activities.   The
 participants will be in residence in Fed-
 eral. Pollution control programs through-
 out the country.
 IMPACT ON OUR CITIES
 The pollution control programs I have
 recommended will benefit all Americans.
 But nowhere will the impact be greater
 than on our cities.
 These steps can clean the air that is
 today blighted by smoke and chemicals.
 These steps can bring to growing ur-
 ban centers abundant supplies Of pure
 water to sustain today's prosperity and
 to satisfy tomorrow's needs.
 These steps can enrich the daily life
 of the city dweller and his children by
 restoring surrounding waterways to their
 unspoiled natural beauty.  For we know
 that ugliness is degrading and costly, but
 that beauty can revive the human spirit
 and enlarge the imagination.
 NATIONAL WATERCOMMISSION
 In no area of resource management are
 the problems more complex-or more
 important-than those involving our Na-
 tion's water supplies.  The water short-
 age in the Northeastern United States is
 a dramatic reminder that we must take
 every possible step to improve the man-
 agernent of our precious water resources.
 I propose the establishment of a Na-
 tional Water Commission to review and
 advise on the entire range of water re-
 source problems-from methods to con-
 serve and augment existing water sup-
 plies to the application of modern tech-
 nology, such as desalting, to provide
 more usable water for our cities, our in-
 dustries, and our farms.
 This Commission will be composed of
 the very best minds in the country.  It
 will judge the quality of our present ef-
 forts..  It will recommend long-range
 plans for the future.  It will point the
 way to increased and more effective
 water resource measures by the Federal
 Government, working in close coopera-
 tion with States, local communities, and
 private industry.
 SAVING OUR FORESTS
 Since the century's beginning the Na-
 tional Government has labored to pre-
 serve the sublime legacy that Is the
 American forest.
 Time after time public intervention
 has prevented the destruction of irre-
 placeable forest lands.
 Our national park and forest systems
 are America's principal trustee in the
 vital task of conservation.  That task
 cannot be accomplished in a single
 stroke.  It requires patient determina-
 tion and careful planning to secure for
 our people the beauty that is justly
 theirs.  It merits careful planning.
 I propose that we plan now to com-
 plete our national park system by 1972--
 the 100th anniversary of Yellowstone,
 the world's first national park.
 Substantial progress has been made
 during the last 4 years. Yet many scenic
 masterpieces remain unprotected and
 deserve early inclusion in the national
 park system.
 A REDWOOD NATIONAL PARK
 I propose the creation of a Redwood
 National Park in northern California.
 It is possible to reclaim a river like the
 Potomac from the carelessness of man.
 But we cannot restore-once it is lost--
 the majesty of a forest whose trees soared
 upward 2,000 years ago.  The Secretary
 of the Interior-after exhaustive consul-
 tations with preservationists, officials of
 the State of California, lumbermen, and
 others-has completed a study of the de-
 sirability of establishing a park of inter-
 national significance.
 I have reviewed his recommendations,
 and am submitting to the Congress leg-
 islation to establish such a park.  This
 will be costly.  But it is my recommen-
 dation that we move swiftly to save an
 area of immense significance before it is
 too late.
 OTHER OUTDOOR RECREATION PROPOSALS
 Other major outdoor recreation pro-
 posals which should be approved in 1966
 are:
 1. Cape Lookout National Seashore,
 N.C.
 2. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lake-
 shore, Mich.
 3. Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore,
 Ind.
 4. Oregon Dunes National Seashore,
 Oreg.
 5. Great Basin National Park, Nev.
 6. Guadalupe  Mountains  National
 Park, Tex.
 7. Bighorn Canyon National Recrea-
 tion Area, Mont.-Wyo.
 8. Flaming Gorge National Recrea-
 tion Area, Utah-Wyo.
 For a region which now has no na-
 tional park, I recommend the study of a
 Connecticut River National Recreation
 Area along New England's largest river,
 in the States of New Hampshire, Ver-
 mont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut..
 I propose the early completion of stu-
 dies and planning for two new parks--
 the Apostle Isles Seashore along Lake
 Superior and North Cascades in Wash-
 ington State.
 NATIONWIDE TRAIL SYSTEM
 In my budget, I recommended legisla-
 tion to extend Federal support to the Ap-
 palachian Trail, and to encourage the
 development of hiking trails accessible to
 the people throughout the country.
 I am submitting legislation to foster
 the development by Federal, State, and
 local agencies of a nationwide system of
 trails and give special emphasis to the
 location  of trails near metropolitan
 areas.
 PRESERVATION OF HISTORIC SITES
 Historic preservation is the goal of
 citizen groups in every part of the coun-
 try. To help preserve buildings and sites
 of historic significance, I will recommend
 a program of matching grants to States
 and to the National Trust for Historic
 Preservation.
 WILD RIVER SYSTEM
 I am encouraged by the response to my
 proposal for a national wild rivers sys-
 tem, and I urge the Congress to complete
 this pioneering conservation legislation
 this year.
 COSTS OF LAND ACQUISITION
 The spiraling cost of land acquisitions
 by the Federal Govermnent, particularly
 for water resource and recreational pur-
 poses, is a matter of increasing concern.

 February 23, 1966
 Mr. MORSE. I wish to comment on
 two points the Senator has made.
 First of all, I wish the Senator to know
 that I agree with him on the desirability
 of a vote this week.  I want him to know
 also that I shall not agree to a unani-
 mous-consent agreement to vote on it,
 because I believe that if we hold sessions
 for a reasonable number of hours each
 day, we will get a vote on it this week.
 Some of us are busily engaged in pre-
 paring what we consider to be a very
 basic statement of policy on the part of
 those of us who disagree with the esca-
 lated war policy which we think is in-
 herent in the pending bill.  As far as the
 senior Senator from Oregon is concerned,
 I would join in any objection to a fili-
 buster on this bill.  But I have not heard
 anyone talking about a debate that could
 possibly be characterized as a filibuster.
 However, some of us have an honest,
 sincere belief that the pending measure
 raises such vital questions of policy in the
 field of American foreign relations that
 we feel we should not vote on it until
 certain statements on that policy have
 been made.  We think each Senator
 should have the right of discussing the
 pending measure on its merits without
 any time limitation being imposed upon
 him.
 I would be the most surprised man in
 the Senate if we did not reach a vote on
 the bill before the week is over.  I think
 we should vote on it before the week is
 over; but only after the regular course of
 debate has taken place.
 As to the comment the Senator from
 Louisiana has made that he thinks the
 point of view of some of us may be aiding
 and abetting the enemy, that, of course,
 he is privileged to discuss, and we shall
 reply.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, may I say that as far as I am con-
 cerned, my position is well known.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.              The Senator's 3 minutes have ex-
 pired.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I ask unani-
 mous consent that I may have an addi-
 tional 2 minutes.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  Without objection, it is so or-
 dered.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  My position
 is well known, and I am proud to speak
 for a State that is united almost to a
 man behind our national policy.  While
 I have received some criticism, I have
 received a great amount of applause as
 well from such States as New York and
 California.
 Mr. President, as far as Louisiana is
 concerned, my mail runs 99-plus percent
 in favor of the position I take, that we
 should give those men in Vietnam all the
 help they need, and that, having com-
 mitted ourselves, we. should not renege
 on those commitments.  I say further,
 Mr. President, that in Louisiana-and I
 was there last weekend-and also in Ar-
 kansas and Texas I have yet to find a
 single person who expresses any dis-
 agreement with the firmness that this
 Nation proposes to show in resisting ag-
 gression in southeast Asia.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, I con-
 cur with the distinguished acting ma-
 No. 31-18
 RECORD - SENATE                     3655
 jority leader.  I have prepared a short
 statement, which I may as well present
 to the Senate at this time.
 Yesterday, we observed the birth an-
 niversary of George Washington.  He
 was our first Commander in Chief. He
 was made general and Commander in
 Chief of the united Colonies on June
 15, 1775.
 In that capacity, he had his problems
 with the Continental Congress in secur-
 ing supplies, weapons, pay, and other
 necessities for his army.
 Those experiences were a factor in
 making the President the Commander in
 Chief when the Constitution was written.
 Now, 191 years later, a similar prob-
 lem confronts us.
 The Commander in Chief, based on
 estimates which have been prepared and
 supported by our field commanders in
 Vietnam, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the
 National  Security  Council,  and  the
 Budget Bureau has presented a request
 for $4.8 billion for aircraft, missiles,
 naval vessels, and other items.
 The request has been carefully proc-
 essed by the Armed Services Committee
 and the Defense Department Appropri-
 ations Subcommittee.  They heard 11
 witnesses.  From 16 to 24 Senators were
 present at all of those hearings.
 The bill which the committee reported
 is not a policy measure. It is a bill to
 authorize funds for needed equipment
 and research.
 After it was reported to the Senate,
 the Foreign Relations Committee began
 hearings on another measure.  It trig-
 gered a broad discussion of our policy in
 and toward Vietnam.
 In and out of committee, on and off
 the Senate floor, a diversity of views and
 viewpoints have been freely expressed
 to withdraw, to pause longer, to escalate,
 to de-escalate, to limit the struggle.
 And all this time, the request for
 weapons  and  equipment  languishes.
 Virtually no speeches have been directed
 to the measure before us.
 There have been allegations and ful-
 minations that "we are spread danger-
 ously thin" and that "shortages appear"
 but the request of the Commander in
 Chief for authority and funds to pro-
 cure weapons and supplies reposes in the
 Senate without action.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.                                                      The time of the Senators from
 Illinois has expired.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to proceed for 3 ad-
 ditional minutes.
 The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
 pore.  Without objection, it is so ordered.
 Until this authorization is approved,
 no money can be appropriated.  If the
 Commander in Chief because of urgent
 necessity should obligate funds without
 this authority, the Congress would be the
 first to castigate him.
 The time for more talk on this pending
 measure is past.  The time for action is
 here and now.
 The well-being of more than 200,000
 American troops, 12,000 miles from home,
 is involved.
 The continued and successful prosecu-
 tion of the present struggle is at stake.
 To delay further action on the pending
 request  means  that  Congress  must
 accept responsibility for failure to act.
 It has been said that in the 10-year
 struggle of the French with the Viet-
 minh, that the war was lost not at Dien-
 bienphu but in Paris.                                                                                                      I trust it may
 never be recorded that if we fail in our
 objectives, that the failure occurred not
 at Danang, or in the highlands of Viet-
 nam, but in Washington.
 To seek cloture on a measure involv-
 ing our national security, our pledges to
 Vietnam, and our obligations under the
 Southeast  Asia  Treaty  Organization
 would be absolutely incredible.  The im-
 pact of such action on troop morale
 could scarcely be measured.  Its impact
 on world reaction could scarcely be
 evaluated.
 The time has come to close the debate
 and act.  I believe I speak for the vast
 majority of the Republican minority
 when I say we are ready to act now and
 approve the request which is before us.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I am very
 glad that the Senator from Illinois read
 the statement which he read a few
 minutes ago with regard to the situation
 which confronts the Senate in regard to
 the pending business.  Many of us do
 not agree with the conclusion he has
 reached that there is no basic policy
 question involved in the pending bill.
 That is where we find an honest differ-
 ence of opinion among Senators, because
 some of us think the pending bill does
 involve a basic policy question.  It in-
 volves the foreign policy vis-a-vis the
 United States and Asia.  That is the
 policy issue involved in the pending bill.
 I say it should be discussed in some
 detail in the discussion of the bill.
 I simply wanted to file this caveat of
 disagreement with what the Senator
 from Illinois had to say, to at least show
 the public that there is a difference of
 opinion with regard to the policy and
 that it is involved in the pending bill.
 In view of even what the Secretary of
 Defense has said, I will show in remarks
 on the floor that we are drawing close
 to a potential escalation of the war which
 will result in the killing of thousands of
 American boys whose lives should not be
 sacrificed.  The bill involves the deci-
 sion of the President of the United States
 to escalate the war. We think it involves
 a policy question and we think we ought
 to discuss that policy question in this
 authorization bill.
 I do not question the sincerity of the
 Senator from Illinois [Mr. DIRKSEN], or
 the Senator from Georgia [Mr. RussELLI,
 or the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr.
 SALTONSTALL],  who  have already said
 they do not see a policy question in-
 volved. It comes to a question of a time
 limit. I have already announced, and I
 now announce, that if we devote our-
 selves to a discussion of the bill on the
 floor, and if we do nothing but discuss
 the bill, we will get to a vote by the end
 of the week.
 The Senator from Illinois calls the at-
 tention of the public to the allegation
 that any prolonged discussion of the bill
 somehow, in some way, is letting down
 the boys in this area. We do not accept
 that. We think, because of the policy is-
 sue involved, this issue should be deter-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        February 23, 1966
 mined in order to seek to protect the
 boys in southeast Asia, because some of
 as believe that if we follow the policy
 which can be followed under the bill we
 pare going to sacrifice unjustifiably many
 boys who ought, to be saved.  That in-
 volves a policy question.
 So far as the time element; is con-
 cerned, there is already delivered mate-
 vi.al of war to the boys in southeast Asia
 that cannot even get unloaded and we
 cannot get the ships in now.
 is have not heard a scintilla of evi-
 dence that there is being denied to our
 boys over there anything in the way they
 need. for the conduct of the war on its
 present scale.  if that were the case, we
 would be unanimous in wanting to take
 whatever steps were necessary to see that
 they will get whatever materiel, to the
 maximum extent necessary, for their
 protection.
 I do rot think there is any basis for
 creating the fe.r in this country that a
 discussion of basic foreign policy in the
 '.=cnatc for a week is going to jeopardize
 our boys in that area.  If that were the
 ease., we would wonder why those boys
 had not been given that protection long
 before this.
 My judgment is that if we discuss this
 bill, with our differences of opinion, and
 have a full discussion, we will get to a
 vote on it by the end of the week.  My
 friend, the Senator from Illinois, said he
 thought cloture would be a mistake be-
 cause of the effect it would have not only
 on our American boys overseas, but on
 others as well.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER   (Mr.
 'i';7niN(-.s in the chair). The time of the
 Senator has expired.
 Mr. MORSE.  I ask unanimous con-
 s;ent to have 2 additional minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. MORSE.  He is quite right when
 he says that we ought to get to the issues
 in the pending bill and vote on it.  I be-
 lieve we ought to do it.  I believe we can
 do it if we discuss this bill fully.  I think
 we could get to a vote by the end of the
 week.
 Mr. S'I'ENNIS.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield for a question?
 Mr. MORSE.  I yield.
 Mr. S T ENNIS.  First, I want to com-
 mend the Senator when he says that
 after reasonable debate we should be able
 to vote sometime this week.  His attitude
 is encouraging.
 Second, he said he has no evidence that
 our boys over there are in actual need.
 E'ortunately, they are getting material
 there for their needs, but if there is much
 more of a delay, there is going to be a
 critical need for some items.
 Mr.  MORSE.  Of course, I do not
 think we should continue the present
 policy. There is a great difference be-
 tween the question of supplying our boys
 and the question of whether we should
 continue the present policy.  It is the
 policy we are discussing.  As I am going
 to urge in my remarks, if we continue
 this policy, we are headed for an esca-
 lated war that will end up in a war with
 China.
 NIr. ' JAVITS i.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the time for this
 discussion.  be  extended  1  additional
 minute.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.           Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. JAVITS.  :I do not think there is
 division of opinion on supplying what
 the boys need, as the Senator from Ore-
 gon has said, but there is a need for
 debate on the President's policy. There-
 fore, when I make my address, I shall
 discuss the policy.  I think the debate
 oir the question of policy is good for the
 country.
 1 hope that we do see it through,.
 There is nothing to stop the Senate from
 having night sessions.
 I have a speech to make.  It will not
 take more than 35 or 40 minutes.  I un-
 derstand that others wish to speak also.
 Let us give everybody an opportunity to
 speak and still vote on Friday.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. JAVITS. I yield.
 Mr. MORSE.  I completely agree with
 the senior. Senator from New York that
 this is the issue before us.
 a believe there is a policy issue here as
 to whether or not there is going to be
 a reassessment of the position of August;
 19154.  I believe that a vote on this meas-
 ure does exactly that.
 That is why I am going to give the
 Senate all opportunity to vote on the
 resolution of August 1964.
 Do not forget that it provides a re scis-
 sion clause.  I believe the time has come
 to place restrictions on the President
 and not give him carte blanche authority
 that the resolution of 1964 gave himr.
 T refuse to believe there have only been
 two of us who would have voted against
 it in August 1964.  There are other Sen-
 ators who believe as Senator GeuENnvc
 and I believe and. continue to believe.
 At that time we had 20,000 soldiers
 there.  There are 200,000 men there now.
 The figure could go to 400.000, 600,000,
 or 800,000.  If we get into a war with
 China, it, may go to 3 million in 36
 months after theftwar breaks out.
 T think the time has come to place a
 restriction on the Commander in Chief
 and not give him carte blanche author-
 ity.  I am going to offer that as. an
 amendment to this bill.
 Mr. SY:MINGTON. Mr. P:i'esident. may
 I ask a question?
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President. I would
 like to finish this and then yield to the
 Senator.
 The    PRESIDING  OFFICER   (Mr.
 Tvnrnos in the chair).  The Senator is
 recognized for 1 additional minute.
 Mr. JAVITS.  Mr. President, I believe
 the President got a power of attorney
 limited by the situation which we have
 S:rere, notwithstanding his words.  I
 believe this vote approves h~s policy to
 the date covered by the appropriation,
 which covers 400,000 personnel.
 Therefore, I and others will reserve
 the right to vote against the appropria-
 tion if the President is unwise enough
 in persisting in not joining with us in
 connection  with  the  resolution  of
 August 1964.
 I agree with the Senator that there is
 a replacement clause.  I shall vote no,
 but I reserve the right to vote yes
 tomorrow if the President persists in
 not joining us in this decision.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I wish to
 say to the Senator from New York, the
 former attorney general of his State
 whose legal advice I follow frequently-
 but not on this occasion-a power of
 attorney can be given, but one can sub-
 sequently fire the attorney.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 rise in the Chamber at the end of this
 discussion.
 In answer to a direct question as to
 whether or not this money was needed
 promptly and whether this bill should
 be passed promptly to help our military
 effort in Vietnam, the director of the
 AID program, Mr. Bell, said, in his opin-
 ion, it should be passed, the sooner the
 better.
 Inasmuch as this is a supplement; to
 the 1966 appropriation, and in the in-
 terests of the men who are now fighting
 on the front in South Vietnam, I hope
 the Senate will pass this bill.
 Mr. STENNIS.  Mr. President, quite
 briefly on this subject, and as one who
 handled the appropriation bill last year,
 and urged that more money be put in at
 the time for the war in Vietnam, I can
 state as a fact, knowing the background
 of these needs, that this money is needed
 now; that the critical date is fast ap-
 proaching when failure of it will cause
 actual delay in providing the hardware
 of fighting a war, including helicopters,
 2.45 rockets, and items of that kind.
 There is no question about the critical
 timing, and it is necessary to pass His
 bill as soon as we can.
 I commend the Senator from Oregon
 for his willingness to dispose of it with
 dispatch this week.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, in the
 presence of the acting majority leader
 and the Democratic whip-and I have
 postponed making this request until lie
 was in the Chamber-I ask uanirnous
 consent  that certain  communications,
 editorials, and newspaper stories dealing
 with my position in regard to the war in
 Asia be printed in the RECORD.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, reserving the right to object-and
 I hope that it will not be necessary to ob-
 ject-I note that the Senator has, from
 time to time, placed in the REcora in
 support of his position great numbers of
 communications.  I understand that in
 some instances it has taken up as much
 as 40 pages of fine print in the RECORD.
 Mr. President, let me say, as a Sena-
 tor from Louisiana, that I would imagine
 the majority of those communications-
 perhaps all of them-support the posi-
 tion of the Senator from Oregon, a posi-
 tion which is contrary to the one this
 Nation is taking today on the subject of
 the war in Vietnam.
 I do not wish the RECORD to give the
 impression that the people of this Na-
 tion are not behind their President. are
 not behind their Government, or that
 they are not in support of our young men
 fighting in Vietnam.
 I, for example, have many thousands
 of communications and letters support-
 ing the position of President, the posi-

 February 23, 1966        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 tion of the Government, and the position
 I have taken in regard to this matter.
 I do not object to the Senator's placing
 certain selective matter in the RECORD
 which supports his position.  I would
 hope that the Senator is not seeking to
 place in the RECORD all correspondence
 in support of his position, because it
 would seem to me it would only be fair
 for those of us who take the opposite
 position in the matter to place an equal
 amount of correspondence in the REC-
 ORD.  The question would then become
 to what extent should we burden the
 RECORD with more of the same.
 In other words, there' is no doubt in
 my mind that some of the letters I
 receive-and some of these letters come
 from the State of Oregon, and other
 States-that there are people who sup-
 port his position. There is also no doubt
 whatever that many people do not.
 Likewise, in the State of Louisiana, let
 me say that the mail I receive is very
 nearly unanimous.  As of this date, it
 might very well be unanimous in sup-
 port of my position. I would hope that
 we could work out some rules of proce-
 dure by which we would be able to give
 'both sides an equal opportunity to load
 the RECORD with correspondence in sup-
 port of both positions.
 Let me ask the Senator from Oregon
 whether this is all the mail he receives,
 or only certain selected samples which
 he believes most adequately support his
 position?
 Mr. MORSE. I will be glad to tell the
 Senator, if he will allow me to respond.
 Mr. President, since last Friday, my
 office tells me that we have received over
 15,000 pieces of mail.  In fact, we have
 a group of volunteers over there today
 opening up the mail.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time
 of the Senator from Oregon has expired.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to proceed for 3 addi-
 tional minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. MORSE'. Mr. President, the last
 count shows well over 90 percent in sup-
 port of my position.  The reason I have
 from time to time put communications,
 pro and con, in the RECORD, is as follows:
 There are those who seek to give the
 impression  that,  the  Senator  from
 Oregon is a lonely voice in the wilderness
 in this country in connection with his
 opposition to the war in South Vietnam.
 I am satisfied that there are millions of
 Americans who share my point of view,
 and they are going to be heard from in
 increasing numbers in the months ahead.
 Mr. President, look at what those of us
 opposed to this war are up against.  So
 far as the media of information in this
 country are concerned, the President has
 only to raise a little finger and he is on
 television for as long as he wishes to be.
 The top officials of the Government have
 only to let it be known that they wish to
 make a statement, and the statement is
 reproduced throughout the press of the
 country.
 Now, Mr. President, it takes a great
 deal of immodesty-and I plead guilty;
 it takes a lot of nerve-and I plead
 guilty; in fact, some would say a lot of
 brass to walk onto the floor of the Senate
 and ask unanimous consent to have these
 communications placed in the RECORD.
 But, I owe a great deal to those citizens
 who have sent them to me.
 Mr. President, there are forces in this
 country who feel they are not being
 heard, that they are not being given an
 opportunity to present their points of
 view. I am even having difficulty in the
 Committee on Foreign Relations, thus
 far, getting certain witnesses that I be-
 lieve should come forward in a public
 hearing to testify on the basic policy
 questions involved.  For, whether we
 know it or not, we have come  to a
 crossroads in American history.  Mr.
 President, if you and I could come back
 to the world 35 or 50 years from today,
 we would then be reading about the his-
 toric debates of these days in the Senate.
 But none of us can even guess or
 prophesy in what direction this great
 Republic is going to go.
 It is for each Senator, in my judgment,
 to exercise his own judgment as to how
 best to represent the people of his
 sovereign State.  It happens to be my
 judgment that I owe it to the many peo-
 ple who have communicated with me-
 and I do not begin to place all their com-
 munications in the RECORD, but I wish
 my friend from Louisiana to know that
 I believe it is a fair sampling-that I
 want those who are protesting to have
 an opportunity, through this medium, to
 be heard throughout the country.
 The Senator from Louisiana knows
 that there are a variety of parliamentary
 ways in which we can get the same ma-
 terial into the RECORD.  I think, how-
 ever, that in the interests of time we
 should insert this material in the RECORD,
 and let the Senator who inserts it assume
 the responsibility for inserting it.  I want
 the Senator to know that I have been
 very careful, that I have given the
 strictest of instructions to my staff that
 no communication shall be placed in the
 RECORD which in any way would reflect
 on anyone or violate any of the rules of
 the Senate.              -
 As part of this historic debate, there
 should be placed in the RECORD the ma-
 terial that I ask to be inserted.  It is up
 to the Senator from Louisiana and every
 other Senator to decide what they wish or
 do not wish to insert in the RECORD.  The
 Senator from Louisiana is within his
 parliamentary rights to object.       But,
 Mr. President, if I cannot get these com-
 munications inserted, I shall get them
 into the RECORD by reading them.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I do not propose to deny the Sena-
 tor his right to put this information in
 the RECORD.  I merely say that I have
 never known any time in the history of
 this great country, in my study of his-
 tory, when American boys who are fight-
 ing in a battle in support of the Nation's
 position, both in terms of its solemn
 treaty commitments and an act of Con-
 gress authorizing that our troops be sent
 there, when a Senator has so much seized
 upon the opportunity-particularly to
 fill the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, or to seek
 to appear before the American people
 and urge that this Nation was going to
 lose in its courage, its determination to
 see through an international commit-
 ment which it has made.  I am not going
 to object to putting this matter in the
 RECORD. I merely say, that to the Sena-
 tor from Louisiana, the impression would
 be given that these communications
 speak for a majority of the American
 people.  They do not speak for 1 per-
 cent of the people of Louisiana.  They do
 not speak for 1 percent of the people of
 Texas, to the best of my knowledge, and
 I doubt that they speak for a substantial
 percentage of the people of any State
 which touches the great State of Lou-
 isiana, which I have the honor to repre-
 sent in the Senate.
 It does seem fair to me that if there
 are going to be a great number of com-
 munications placed into the RECORD by
 any one Senator, every Senator should
 have the same opportunity, and I have
 some doubts as to the great burden that
 will be imposed on the printer.
 If each of us has 15,000 letters, we
 might be asked why we did not print the
 rest of them when we put some of them
 into the RECORD.
 I simply urge that we have some rule
 of fairplay as to what extent we are
 going to burden the RECORD.
 I have many letters supporting this
 Government that I would like to put into
 the RECORD. I would like to have letters
 from Americans whom I regard as pa-
 triots put in the RECORD, because I sus-
 pect that many of thosl letters that are
 printed may not be exactly loyal Amer-
 icans.
 I know there are some heart-touching
 letters I have received from American
 citizens who realize this has been a great
 sacrifice to them.  Many of them have
 paid a great price in the loss of loved
 ones and personal sacrifices, but never-
 theless they support the commitment of
 the United States.
 Mr. GRUENING.       Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I yield.
 Mr. GRUENING. I should like to say
 to the Senator from Louisiana that
 those of us who oppose what we consider
 the great folly of preceding administra-
 tions, particularly this one, in involving
 ourselves militarily in Vietnam feel that
 we should not be sending our boys to
 fight and die in South Vietnam because
 the defense of South Vietnam is not
 essential to the defense of our Nation.
 Nothing that happens in Vietnam affects
 our national security.  We invited our-
 selves in. We are fighting there for peo-
 ple who do not fight effectively for them-
 selves. We have had very little support
 from our allies, with whom we have
 pleaded for it.  The report of the hear-
 ings released by the Armed Services
 Committee on the pending authorization
 bill, makes it apparent that we are going
 it practically alone, except for a few
 token contributions that we have had
 to work hard to get and that came in
 late.
 Those of us who oppose this partici-
 pation in an Asian civil war do not yield
 to anyone in our patriotism.  It is our
 desire to see that we do not embark on
 a course which cannot be successful, in
 achieving the ends we allege we seek,
 that is too costly in lives and treasure in

 an area which I do not think is worth
 the life of one American boy.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  We are there
 because of a commitment we had in the
 protocol to the southeast Asia Defense
 Treaty, which permitted us to resist ag-
 iression  in the very area of South
 Vietnam.
 I rather resent the Senator's saying
 that the people of South Vietnam are
 ..lot willing to fitght for their country
 against the threat of communism.  Let
 as understand this.  There have been
 ,everal  governments there.   Some of
 those governments were not as popular
 as some of us would like them to have
 been, but not one of them has been as
 unpopular as is communism.
 More than 1 million people left North
 Vietnam with nothing more than they
 could  carry  with  them,  after having
 worked a lifetime to accumulate certain
 property and goods, in order to go to
 South Vietnam to try to escape com-
 munism, not knowing what kind of gov-
 ermnent they were going to have in
 South Vietnam.
 When they did get there, they did all
 they could to uphold an anti-Communist
 government to try to save themselves
 from communism. Little mayors, little
 aldermen, little chiefs of communities
 have been slaughtered by the Commu-
 nists.  Nevertheless, they continue to op-
 pose  communism-50,000  people  have
 been killed by the Communists because
 they did not want to live under com-
 munism and support communism; 45,000
 men of the South Vietnamese Army have
 .made the supreme sacrifice in fighting
 on the field of battle, not counting the
 hundreds of thousands of those who have
 been injured lighting for their country.
 If one considers the sacrifice these peo-
 ple have made in fighting not to be under
 the Communists, as General 'T'aylor has
 said, to compare the number to this
 country, we would have to multiply that
 number by 20.  if we compared those
 sacrifices to the population of the United
 States, it would amount to 1,800,000 peo-
 ple in this country-mayors. and other
 little town leaders, who would have had
 their heads chopped off.   The South
 Vietnamese continue valiantly.   There
 are 20 South Vietnamese units compared
 to 5 American units on the field of battle
 today.  So those South Vietnamese are
 fighting bravely.
 The  PRESIDING   OFFICER.       The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  I ask unani-
 mous consent that I may have 3 addi-
 tional minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.        With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  We did not
 decide to send troops into South Vietnam
 until North Vietnam did.  South Viet-
 nam made it c`-ear that its people did not
 want to be overwhelmed by aggression
 from the Communists. We saw that they
 were going to need help.  So when the
 Government of North Vietnam marched
 its troops in tl...ere, we sent our troops in,
 in accordance with our treaty commit-
 ment.  People should look long and hard
 at the fact that we are living up to our
 commitment.
 South Vietnam Is a nation which has
 paid much to stand up against commu-
 nism, and yet we hear on the floor of
 the Senate that the people of South
 Vietnam are not fighting.  The South
 Vietnamese have paid a greater price in
 relative terms that this country has ever
 paid in any war it has engaged in.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is t.!,ere
 objection to the request of the Senator
 from Oregon that certain matters be
 printed in the RECORD?
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 to reevaluate the extent of unity we may
