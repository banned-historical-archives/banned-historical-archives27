 Communist bloc propaganda suggests that the USSR will
 not agree unconditionally to the British proposals on Laos
 and that the Communists will try to avoid a commitment on
 a cease-fire before an international conference is con-
 vened.   However, favorable references to the British pro-
 posals by Gromyko, together with the generally moderate
 tone of the Pravda "Observer" article on 27 March, reflect
 Moscow's desire not to exacerbate the critical situation
 in Laos.   The Boun Oum government is holding back on
 adopting a political position pending the outcome of
 East-West deliberations on Laos,  but cabinet discussions
 continue on possible courses of action.   Recent Commu-
 nist military activity in Laos has been limited to small-
 scale actions, possibly reflecting immediate    political
 considerations,but the Communist forces are capable of
 stepped-up operations at any time against the dispirited
 Laotian Army.

 The UN is continuing its pressure on Leopoldville to
 allow the re-entry of UN troops into Matadi, but the Congor
 lese are adamant that only civilians can be permitted in
 the port for the time being.   The question of how Indian
 troops to be transported by sea--the bulk of those ex-
 pected--will enter the country thus is still unsolved.
 Various Congolese officials apparently are making un-
 coordinated efforts at negotiations between the Leopold-
 ville and Stanleyville regimes.   Tshombd is sending 1,000
 troops against Manono,  capital of the secessionist
 "Lualaba state" in north Katanga.
 NUCLEAR TEST BAN NEGOTIATIONS   . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  9
 The chief Soviet delegate has had little to say            at
 the nuclear test ban negotiations in Geneva during the past
 week, but has indicated that he will present a comprehen-
 sive reply to the new Western proposals after the detailed
 explanations are completed.   Outside the conference,
 Tsarapkin has used several press interviews to minimize
 the extent of Western concessions and to emphasize his
 warnings against further French testing.   He has, how-
 ever, stopped short of making cessation of French test-
 ing a precondition for further negotiations.  He has
 also stressed the "paramount importance" of the
 Soviet proposal for a tripartite council to administer the
 control system.   Ambassador Thompson believes that the
 tripartite concept proposed by Khrushchev for the UN
 Secretariat  has  become  basic  Soviet  policy  on
 questions  of  international  administration  and
 that  Moscow,  therefore,  will probably  maintain
 its  position  on  the  council  for  administering

 KHRUSHCHEV'S POLITICAL SHAKE-UP CONTINUES.  .  .  .  .  .  .                   .  .   Page  12
 Khrushchev's shake-up of Soviet officialdom has
 claimed another of his lieutenants, presidium candidate
 Pospelov,  and is reaching into all levels of party and
 government.   Corruption and deficiencies in the agri-
 cultural field continue to be the most frequent charges.
 Still other .factors are involved, however,  including
 political maneuvering among Khrushchev's lieutenants
 in preparation for the party congress to be held in
 October.  If the demotions and firings,  now in their
 13th   week, continue at the present rate, they will be
 the most extensive housecleaning undertaken by Khru-
 shchev.
 SOVIET OFFICIAL VISITS ECUADOR AND VENEZUELA  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  13
 The Soviet ambassador to Mexico, Vladimir Bazykin,
 apparently failed to achieve the main objectives of his
 recent trip to South America.   Of the countries which he
 proposed to visit, only Ecuador and Venezuela granted
 him visas,  and neither of these would agree to establish
 diplomatic relations with the USSR.   President Betancourt
 of Venezuela complained to Bazykin of unfair Soviet
 competition in oil sales and described local Communists
 as agitators inspired by Moscow.   Ecuador agreed to an
 exchange of trade delegations,  however,  and both coun-
 tries may develop cultural contacts with the Soviet
 Union.  Although Bazykin's official reception was cordial,
 the attitude of the public was cool and at times hostile.
 DISSENSION IN ECUADOR OVER POLICY TOWARD CUBA.  .
 President Velasco's vacillation on policy toward
 Cuba and the bloc is contributing to a sharp division

 The forced resignation of Argentine Army Commander

 ened the Frondizi government.                                Most top military leaders,
 although they agreed with some of Toranzo Montero's com-
 plaints over Peronism and Communism,                                     felt that his
 demands for stronger pressure on Frondizi constituted
 a threat to constitutional government.   Toranzo Montero
 retains some influence within the armed forces, however,
 and has warned that he will be "active on the sidelines."

 Government plans to send 400 experts to Africa and Asia
 during 1961; approximately 500 nongovernment technicians
 from Israel are already there.   About 1,000 foreign
 trainees are to come to Israel this year.   Other Arab
 states have joined Nasir in                      mpaign
 against the Israeli program.                               25X1

 BELGIAN GOVERNMENT PROSPECTS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 20
 The success of the Socialist party in the elections
 on 26 March has increased the likelihood that Belgium's
 next government will be a coalition of the Social
 Christian and Socialist parties, with Paul Henri Spaak,
 Socialist leader and former secreaty general of NATO,
 playing a prominent role.   While no major changes in
 foreign policy are anticipated,  Spaak has been privately
 critical of some of his country's moves in the Congo and
 would probably bring about greater Belgian cooperation
 both there and in NATO matters.
 INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS . .
 Leaders at the International Confederation of Free
 Trade Unions (ICFTU), at their recent high-level meeting
 in Brussels, made some progress toward overcoming the
 difficulties confronting the organization.  Affiliated
 unions have pledged $7,250,000 to the proposed $10,000,-
 000 solidarity fund to help finance free trade unionism
 in the developing areas of Asia, Latin America, and
 Africa,  and a start was made toward a more efficient
 organization of the ICFTU itself.  Nevertheless, the
 confederation seems likely to continue to suffer from
 internal frictions and lack of complete support by its
 affiliates--as indicated by the refusal of the British
 unions to make further contributions to the fund.

 SCIENCE IN COMMUNIST CHINA .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . Page 22
 The Chinese Communists are in the fifth year of a
 12-year scientific program with the objective Of reaching
 "world levels of achievement."  Progress is being made
 in the 11 priority technological fields--including atomic
 energy and jet propulsion.   China's small group of com-
 petent scientists is being slowly augmented by stu-
 dents trained in bloc countries.   However, research
 and development are limited by a shortage of scientists
 and equipment.   Further limitations arise from China's
 heavy dependence on Soviet technical assistance,
 sharply curtailed by the withdrawal of Soviet techni-
 cians last summer.
 CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S ROLE IN THE BLOC ECONOMIC OFFENSIVE .  .  .   Page 23
 Czechoslovakia is providing economic and military
 assistance to 17 countries outside the bloc.  Total aid
 extended thus far amounts to $660,000,000, compared
 with a Soviet aid total of $3.8 billion and a Chinese
 Communist aid total of $350,000,000.  About half of
 the Czech aid is being provided for economic develop-
 ment projects, the remainder for military equipment.

 CHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED NATIONS .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  1
 Recent announcements by such key UN members as
 Britain and Brazil that they will not continue to
 support the moratorium on Chinese UN representation
 indicate that use of this procedural device will no
 longer preserve Taipei's position in the UN.  The
 British Foreign Office believes that Taipei's sup-
 porters will not even be able to attach conditions--
 such as UN  membership for Nationalist China as
 "Taiwan" or "Formosa"--to the seating of Peiping.
 The growing opposition to the moratorium, which post-
 pones discussion of either the seating of Peiping or the
 ouster of Taipei, reflects a belief among members that
 the UN must soon take action on the problem.
 DE GAULLE'S PROGRAM FOR THE FRENCH ARMED SERVICES  .  .  .  .   Page  5
 De Gaulle is reorganizing the French armed forces
 to adapt to the demands of modern warfare.   Most of his
 long-range objectives,  including early achievement of a
 nuclear capability, are embodied in a law passed last
 fall which lays out a program for the development of
 the armed forces in the period 1960-65.   Various as-
 pects of this program, particularly the priority being
 given to nuclear weapons, are at variance with an
 earlier plan which called for a balanced development
 of all services.   This has aroused sharp criticism,
 especially among senior army officers who are also
 critical of De Gaulle's Algerian and NATO policies.
 T.-D. LYSENKO  .    .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  10
 The recent revival of the influence of Trofim D.
 Lysenko, a power under Stalin in the fields of agricul-
 ture and biological research, is anomalous at a time
 when Khrushchev is calling for the best scientific
 methods to solve the USSR's agricultural problems.
 Lysenko's theories of genetics, based on Communist
 doctrine rather than science, are deplored by repu
 table scientists in the USSR.  The current favor ac-
 corded by Khrushchev probably stems from Lysenko's
 willingness to promise fast practical results.  Al-
 though Lysenko is far from regaining the authority he
 exercised under Stalin, he is in a position to exert
 significant influence over agricultural research.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 WEEKLY REVIEW
 LAOS
 Bloc Diplomacy
 On 24 March, the day fol-
 lowing President Kennedy's state-
 ment on Laos, Gromyko told Am-
 bassador Stevenson at the UN
 that he had a message from Khru-
 shchev to deliver orally to the
 President and asked for a meet-
 ing as, soon as possible. In his
 conversation with the President
 on 27 March,,Gromyko said that,
 in the USSR's view, the latest
 British proposals--contained in
 a note delivered on 23 March--
 could serve as a basis for set-
 tlement in Laos. However, having
 offered this hopeful statement,
 Gromyko urged that both sides
 should show restraint and take
 steps to prevent the conflict
 from spreading.  He did not
 clarify the Soviet Union's po-
 sition on the question of a
 cease-fire and said that Mos-
 cow's reply to the British note
 would be forthcoming in the
 near future.
 The favorable references
 to the British proposals by
 Gromyko, together with the gen-
 erally moderate and positive'tone
 of the authoritative Pravda
 "Observer" article onTarch,
 appear to reflect the Soviet
 leaders' awareness that the re-
 cent military and diplomatic
 moves by the US and Britain
 have brought the contest over
 Laos to a new and more critical
 phase.   Gromyko's remarks after
 the meeting with the President
 expressing hope for a peaceful'
 settlement suggest that Moscow
 sought to forestall any decisions
 by the SEATO conferees  which
 might raise the possibility of
 expanded military action.
 At the same time, the So-
 viet Union had to maintain its
 own strong bargaining position
 in Laos.  This was reflected in
 the Pravda warning that bloc
 policy would not be influenced
 by hints of "collective inter-
 vention by SEATO" and by move-
 ments of American naval and mil-
 itary forces.  European satel-
 lite propaganda has also at-
 tempted to demonstrate that the
 US--not the Communists--has been
 guilty of intervention in Laos
 and must bear full responsibil-
 ity for the crisis.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Pravda Commentary
 The "Observer" article,
 which has received unprecedented
 publicity by Radio Moscow, rep-
 resented a direct reply to Pres-
 ident Kennedy's press conference
 remarks, which had previously
 been barely mentioned by Moscow
 media. The article sought to
 emphasize the fact that the USSR
 was the earliest and most con-
 sistent proponent of a negotiated
 settlement in Laos and followed
 the general line taken by Pre-
 mier Khrushchev in his interview
 with Ambassador Thompson on 9
 March, pointing out that the
 USSR and the US now agree that
 the objective should be a truly
 neutral and independent Laos.
 While Pravda took issue with the
 President's remarks regarding
 the origins of the Laotian
 crisis, the article welcomed
 his statement that the US wants
 peace and not war in Laos,   a
 truly neutral government, and
 a settlement through negotia-
 tions.
 Although the article avoided
 any direct comment on the British
 proposal for a cease-fire, it
 implied that the USSR would not
 agree to any approach which would
 indicate Soviet responsibility
 for and direction of the Pathet
 Lao - Kong Le forces.   Pravda
 characterized President  ennedy's
 call for a cessation of armed
 attacks by externally supported
 Communists as "tantamount to an
 ultimatum to the people of Laos."
 While Pravda' ,s position would
 not necessarily preclude Soviet
 agreement to a joint appeal by
 the Geneva do-chairmen for a
 de facto cease-fire, recent bloc
 propaganda on this issue suggests
 an intention to evade any firm
 commitment on the timing of a
 formal cessation of hostilities
 prior to an international con-
 ference, on the grounds that this
 is a matter for the conference
 itself to decide.
 The Asian Communists
 A 23 March People's Dail
 editorial, Peiping'sfirs  press
 commentary on Laos in more than
 10 days, called on all "peace-
 loving forces to firmly support
 the patriotic struggle of the
 Lao people" and proposed only
 that common efforts be made to
 convene a 14-nation conference--
 a conference in which the Com-
 munists would try to ensure
 strong Pathet Lao participation
 in a coalition Laotian govern-
 ment.
 Hanoi, in a 25 March edito-
 rial attacking the position Pres-
 ident Kennedy took at his press
 conference, accused the US of
 endorsing an immediate cease-
 fire only to strengthen "rebel"
 forces.  The concept that the
 ICC could actually be used to
 help bring about a cease-fire
 prior to the international con-
 ference was roundly castigated
 by the Pathet Lao,who, on 27
 March, charged this would "serve
 US perfidious schemes."  Even
 North Korea joined in to attack
 the President's press confer-
 ence statement ,and depict the
 US as "driven to the corner."
 Peiping broadcast a highly
 edited version of the Pravda
 "Observer" article, choosing
 to emphasize that portion which
 implied the use of force to
 counter any SEATO move in Laos.
 However, Communist China's For-
 eign Minister Chen Yi, during
 a recent interview in Burma,
 carefully skirted a question on
 SEATO intervention in Laos which
 would have provided an opportu-
 nity for explicitly threatening
 to counter such a move with Chi-
 nese forces. Asked what would
 be the result if SEATO openly
 invaded Laos, Chen Yi replied
 in writing that "the civil war
 will be prolonged, the suffering
 of the Laotian people will be
 increased."

 The most precise threat to
 continue the war in Laos has
 come from the Pathet Lao, who
 on 28 March broadcast another
 statement warning of an ap-
 peal "to peace-loving countries
 for military help" unless the
 US ceases its "interference" and
 accepts the 14-nation conference.
 Prime Minister Nehru, more
 active than ever in his role as
 international broker, has been
 using his influence in several
 major capitals to move the crisis
 toward a negotiated solution.
 After exchanging messages with
 President Kennedy and Prime Min-
 ister Macmillan, Nehru contacted
 Khrushchev appealing for his
 support of the British proposals
 and expressing the hope that they
 would lead to a cease-fire, re-
 convening of the ICC, and later
 an international conference.
 The Indian leader had earlier
 indicated his readiness to re-
 call the ICC, initially perhaps
 in New Delhi, if requested by
 the two Geneva co-chairmen.
 Political Scene in Vientiane
 Further political moves in
 Vientiane have been held in abey-
 ance during the absence of King Sa-
 yang and General Phoumi, who were
 in southern Laos until 29 March,
 and pending the outcome of East-
 West deliberations on the Lao-
 tian crisis.   However, cabinet
 discussions are continuing on
 possible courses of action.
 Vientiane leaders continue to
 look to international support for
 the defense of Laotian territory.
 Former Premier Phoui San-
 anikone, meanwhile, is working
 behind the scenes for a replace-
 ment of the present government,
 which he feels is "dictatorial"
 and only antagonizing the ma-
 jority of the population.  He
 proposes that the King persuade
 Boun Oum and Phoumi to step down
 and that he then take personal
 charge of a transitional govern-
 ment pending a general election.
 There is considerable support
 for this proposal among other
 conservative Laotian politicians,
 and Savang reportedly has taken
 it under advisement.
 Nehru continues in his pub-
 lic statements to underscore
 the gravity of the Laotian situa-
 tion and to endorse the British-
 US approach as constructive and
 the best means of achieving
 what he feels is immediately
 required--an end to hostilities
 and the influx of arms.
 Nehru also sent word to
 Souvanna Phouma in Paris!
 urging Souvanna to
 return to Phnom Penh for further
 talks with Phoumi.   Nehru appar-
 ently feels continued efforts
 toward reconciling Laotian polit-
 ical elements must proceed with-
 out delay to ensure the success
 of international negotiations.
 New Delhi generally has taken
 the position that any national
 government not taking in all fac-
 tions would be neither effective
 nor acceptable as a basis for
 international agreement.
 The Military Situation
 There has been only minor
 skirmishing during the past week.
 While thy'Kong Le - Pathet Lao
 forces have the capability for
 renewed offensive action, they
 have been engaged primarily in
 consolidating their positions on
 the various fronts.  The lull in
 the fighting may be a purely
 tactical measure on their part,
 but might also reflect Communist
 intent to allow the pattern of
 international negotiations to
 become established.
 Army leaders, despite re-
 duced enemy pressure along
 Route 13, remain fearful of an
 attack on Luang Prabang,   Phoumi
 believes the enemy objective
 is complete domination of north-
 ern Laos, with Luang Prabang
 as an immediate target.   The
 strength of the Kong Le - Pathet
 Lao forces north of the Phou
 Khoun road junction would ap-
 pear to rule out a victory

 over the numerically superior
 government defenders, posi-
 tioned about 25 miles south of
 Luang Prabang.      However, the
 army's morale, which General
 Ouane describes as at "an all-
 time low," could be an overrid-
 ing factor.
 Laotian Army leaders are
 also concerned over recent move-
 ments by Pathet Lao troo s north
 of Luang Prabang.
 The situation in the Muong Sai -
 Nam Bac region is somewhat ob-
 scure
 Government forces north of
 Vang Vieng on Route 13 have
 been making some progress in
 regaining lost ground, and have
 now reached a point about 15
 miles north of that village.
 Their slow advance has been fur-
 ther held up in recent days by
 felled trees, mines, and mortar
 fire.   In the area south of the
 Plaine des Jarres, enemy forces
 are still trying to crack the
 government's defensive position
 at Tha Thom.   This effort is
 being hampered by Meo guerrilla
 operations throughout the Plaine
 des Jarres area,,which are in-
 flicting substantial casualties
 on isolated enemy units and
 hindering supply movements.
 New enemy action in the
 Kam Keut area, some 70 miles
 southeast of Pak Sane, has been
 reported.  Firm details are
 still lacking, but Vientiane
 is taking a serious view of the
 situation, fearing'an enemy
 move-to cut the country in half.
 The attacks  .n this area prob-
 ably are intended primarily as
 a diversionary move at this
 time, but the enemy's control
 of Kam Keut and Lak Sao to the
 east facilitates access to Laos
 from North Vietnam via the Vinh-
 Thakhek road.

 Leopoldville
 The situation in the Congo
 continues to drift, and little
 progress has been made toward
 easing relations between the UN
 Command and the Congolese or
 between Leopoldville and Stan-
 leyville.  The Congolese still
 oppose a UN military presence
 in the lower Congo at the port
 of Matadi, although their rela-
 tions with the UN Command have
 improved since UN representative
 Rajeshwar Dayal was temporarily
 replaced by Makki Abbas in mid-
 March.
 Secretary General Hammar-
 skjold wants to re-establish at
 least a minimal UN military
 force at Matadi--sufficient to
 protect the area containing the
 UN warehouses--and if the Congo-
 lese remain intransigent he may
 take the matter to the Security
 Council.   The Congolese author-
 ities, who are willing to permit
 UN technicians at Matadi but not
 military forces because of the
 effect on the populace, have
 charged that the UN is deliber-
 ately holding up needed food
 supplies at the port because of
 reluctance to recognize the Ileo
 government in Leopoldville. The
 position of the UN Command is
 that without UN supervisory per-
 sonnel--and protecting troops--
 at the port it is unable to as-
 sume responsibility for the dis-
 patch of supplies from the Matadi
 warehouses.
 Nehru's toughening attitude. On
 27 March he stated in the Indian
 Parliament that the UN must oc-
 cupy Matadi, by force if neces-
 sary.   He warned that India
 could not send troops there if
 they are not assured of a safe
 landing.   The departure from
 Bombay of a US naval transport
 with an estimated 2,300 Indian
 troops on board was postponed
 from 29 March to 1 April at the
 UN's request.
 Various Congolese officials
 apparently are making uncoordi=
 nated efforts to improve their
 relations between Leopoldville
 and Stanleyville.   Minister of
 Information Bolikango and Leo-
 poldville provincial President
 Kamitatu have not yet left for
 Stanleyville,even though
 Kamitatu is reported desirous
 of mediating and claims that
 Gizenga has expressed to him a
 desire to negotiate.
 Premier-designate Ileo,
 however, has wavered on granting
 permission; he is concerned that
 Kamitatu, who was a strong Lu-
 r-umba supporter, may defect to
 the Gizenga regime upon arrival
 in Stanleyville.   Kamitatu states,
 however, that such fears are
 groundless because he is prima-
 rily interested in serving his-
 constitutents in Leopoldville
 Province and, moreover, has had
 serious differences with Gizenga
 in the past.
 Hammarskjold's position is
 considerably strengthened by
 General Mobutu announced
 on 29 March that negotiations are
 in progress between his officers

 who is seeking to gain support
 among moderate African states
 for his Congo federation plan,
 recently suffered     a rebuff to
 his international prestige at
 the hands of Liberian President
 Tubman, who refused to agree to
 a Tshomb6 visit because of pre-
 vailing Lumumbist sympathies in
 Liberia. Meanwhile, Tshomb6 is

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NUCLEAR TEST BAN NEGOTIATIONS
 The Soviet delegation has
 maintained virtual silence in
 the Geneva conference but has
 indicated that Moscow will pre-
 pare a comprehensive reply to
 the new Western proposals.   In
 private discussions on 22 and
 23 March, chief Soviet dele-
 gate Tsarapkin urged Ambassador
 Dean to be patient and await a
 Soviet response after the United
 States and Britain complete.
 development of their proposals.
 He told the ambassador that he
 would continue to listen to
 the American plans with inter-
 est and that the USSR was
 anxious to bring about a suc-
 cessful conclusion to the
 negotiations.
 In the conference session
 on 24 March, Tsarapkin reiter-
 ated the Soviet delegation's
 intention to wait until the
 end of the US and British
 presentation before commenting
 in detail.   He claimed that
 since the US position appeared
 to be a "package" proposal, an
 analysis and evaluation of
 individual points could not be
 given until conclusion of the
 Western explanations.
 During a private conver-
 sation with the chief British
 delegate on 27 March, Tsarapkin
 avoided any comment on the
 Western proposals but repeated
 his familiar line that the
 USSR had made all the conces-
 sions.             He claimed that the
 Soviet proposals would be
 adequate to control a test
 ban; he characterized a ban as
 a measure of "extremely limited
 significance," stating that
 any treaty would be an exper-
 iment in international control,
 and should therefore begin with
 only a minimum of control fea-
 tures.
 council to supervise the con-
 trol system,;and made no
 reference to French testing.
 The British delegate gained the
 impression that the Soviet
 delegation was prepared to
 continue negotiations through
 the summer.
 The only substantive point
 raised by Tsarapkin at the con-
 ference concerned freedom of
 action of the three powers to
 resume small underground tests
 when the voluntary moratorium
 on these tests expired.   Fore-
 shadowing the probable line of
 attack on this issue, he asked
 whether the American proposals
 admitted the possibility of re-
 suming underground tests at
 that time.   The USSR has pre-
 viously insisted that the
 three powers should not be
 automatically free to do so.
 A member of the Soviet
 delegation has also indicated
 privately that it will insist
 that there be only 15 control
 posts for the USSR, rather than
 the 19'proposed by the West,
 and will hold out for Soviet
 representation on the inspection
 teams.   He stated that the
 Soviet delegation regarded the
 new American proposals as
 bargaining counters.
 Outside the conference,
 Tsarapkin has continued his
 sharp criticism of the new
 American and British proposals.
 In an interview with a CBS
 correspondent on 23 March, he
 stated that the Western pro-
 posals contained little new
 and showed that the US con-
 tinued to hold an unacceptable
 position on such questions as
 the number of on-site inspections,
 the staffing of control posts:
 and on-site inspection teams,
 and the scientific criteria
 Tsarapkin agreed with the
 British suggestion that the
 end of May be a target date.
 for concluding a treaty, but
 only if the Soviet terms were
 accepted.   He made only brief
 mention of the Soviet proposal
 for a tripartite administrative
 for determining which detected
 seismic events qualified for
 on-site inspection.  He applied
 the same term to the US posi-
 tion on the. number of control
 posts in the USSR, the dura-
 tion of the moratorium on small
 underground tests, and a "num-
 ber of other questions."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Tsarapkin took a similar
 line in an interview with a
 correspondent of the Italian
 Communist newspaper L'Unita on
 24 March.   In an interview with
 a representative of the Polish
 press service on 25 March, he
 subdivided the American plan
 into three parts:   1) questions
 on which the US takes the same
 attitude as in the past; 2)
 certain issues on. which the
 West has made a short step
 forward, and 3) those points
 on which the West approached
 the Soviet compromise proposals.
 Without spelling out the specif-
 ic issues, Tsarapkin declared
 that even the rare concession
 seemed "illusory" and qualified
 by numerous conditions and
 reservations.

 test ban negotiations into the
 framework of complete and gen-
 eral disarmament "if the Amer-
 icans failed to produce some
 Rt
 reported
 that Tsarap in, in a private
 conversation, belittled the
 Western concessions and stated
 that things looked bad for the
 success of the conference.
 Tsarapkin has also used
 press interviews to repeat his
 warning on the "negative effect"
 of continued French testing
 and to underscore the importance
 .of the Soviet proposals for a
 tripartite administrator for
 the control system.   In the
 Polish press service interview
 he repeated his statement,
 given at the opening session,
 on the "negative influence" of
 French testing on the negotia-
 tions.  Tsarapkin stated that
 continued testing by France
 "would render questionable the
 efficacy of an agreement."  He
 told CBS that French tests
 threatened to nullify the pos-
 sibility of concluding a treaty.
 In private talks a member of
 the Soviet delegation pointed
 out, however, that these warn-
 ings did not pose any precondi-
 tions for further negotiations.
 On the question of a three-
 member administrative council,
 Tsarapkin termed it a "fundamen-
 tal problem" and "of paramount
 importance."  Ambassador Thompson
 believes that the Soviet plan for
 a three-member secretariat to
 replace the UN Secretariat has
 become basic Soviet policy and
 that Moscow, therefore, will
 probably maintain its position
 on the three-member council to
 administer a test ban even to
 the point of a breakdown in the
 talks at Geneva.
 The volume of Soviet propa-
 ganda commentary on the nego-
 tiations last week was higher
 than for any week since the ne-
 gotiations began in the fall of
 1958.   Peiping has remained si-
 lent on the negotiations.  The
 revised Western proposals were
 broadly characterized by Soviet
 propagandists as "nothing new,"
 and a widely broadcast comment
 claimed they were intended as
 "psychological preparation for
 torpedoing" the talks.  Moscow's
 commentators have also reported,
 however, that the Soviet delega-
 tion must await the explanation
 of the Western plan before
 appraising the individual pro-
 posals.  Wide publicity has been
 given to the Soviet proposal for
 a tripartite administrator and
 to Tsarapkin"s warnings against
 further French testing.
 Although there is no explic-
 it threat of a Soviet test re-
 sumption nor any demand that
 France  join the negotiations, a
 broadcast to France on 27 March
 claimed that an "effective" in-
 ternational agreement is "hardly
 possible" so long as "one of the
 European great powers" continues
 testing.  TASS on 28 March report-
 ed the Soviet delegation had
 pointed out that French testing
 complicates not only the Geneva
 talks but the whole disarmament
 problem.                              25X1

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 CUBA
 There has been only limited
 international comment so far
 on the 22 March announcement of
 the formation of the anti-Castro
 "Revolutionary Council"  under
 Castro's former Premier Jose
 Miro Cardona.   An Argentine
 representative in the UN gave
 as his immediate opinion that
 the creation of a Cuban govern-
 ment-in-exile would have a "fa-
 vorable impact in Latin Ameri-
 ca," but added that the formal
 announcement should have been
 made in some Latin American
 country  tb  avoid the charge
 that the new organization is a
 US "satellite" or "puppet."
 Radio Moscow charged the United
 States with violating several
 international agreements in al-
 lowing the anti-Castro group
 to organize a "government" on
 its soil.
 Castro reacted by boasting
 in a 25 March speech of the re-
 sistance with which Cubans would
 meet any invasion attempt by
 "mercenaries" (i.e., anti-Cas-
 tro Cuban exiles) or "marines."
 The "mercenary government" would
 last 24 hours or perhaps a lit-
 tle longer, he said,  adding
 that "if they begin playing at
 local war, imperialism may meet
 with hemispheric war."  He said
 that Cuba had many more arms
 than the Congo or Laos, and as-
 serted that, in case of an at-
 tack on Cuba, "peasants and
 workers from many other Ameri-
 can countries will march to war
 against imperialism."
 Recent reports describing
 Cuba's internal economic situa-
 tion are dominated by accounts
 of consumer-goods shortages,
 but most foreign observers in
 Havana  continue,to   feel   that
 the  regime  is  not  threat
 ened  by  such  economic  dis-
 locations.
 Sabotage and organized re-
 sistance activities evidently
 are continuing to increase
 throughout Cuba despite a pre-
 sumably steady gain in the
 strength of the government's
 instruments of repression.   Ac-
 counts of attempted sabotage
 of industrial and agricultural
 installations are becoming in-
 creasingly                            25X1
 frequent, and anti-     25X1
 Castro terrorists are explod-
 ine bombs daily in Havana
 Recent reports indicate
 that sugar cane fires--allegedly
 set by saboteurs--may be increas-
 ing.                                                        A considerable portion of
 such fire-damaged cane normally
 can be salvaged by grinding it
 immediately, but the growing in-
 cidence of such reports implies
 some reduction in Cuba's esti-
 mated total 1961 sugar crop of
 5,50(),000-6,000,000 tons as well
 as the further erosion of support
 for Castro among the peasant
 groups on which his popularity
 rests. The present slowdown in
 Camaguey Province by sugar-mill
 workers protesting wage cuts
 provides a further illustration
 of  'disenchantment with Castro
 among lower income groups.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEK??t' SUMMARY
 KHRUSHCHEV'S POLITICAL SHAKE-UP CONTINUES
 Khrushchev`s~current shake-
 up of Soviet officialdom has
 claimed another of his  lieu-
 tenants and has reached into
 all levels  of     the party and
 government bureaucracies. The
 poor results in agricultural
 production last year touched off
 the shake-up, and corruption and
 deficiencies in the agricultural
 field continue to be the most
 frequent charges leveled against
 the victims.   Still other fac-
 tors are involved, however, in-
 cluding political maneuvering
 among Khrushchev's lieutenants
 in preparation for the 22nd
 party congress, to be held in
 October.   If demoti.'on.s and fir-
 ings continue much longet at
 the present rate, this will be
 the most extensive bureaucratic
 housecleaning since Khrushchev
 took over.
 The most recent high-level
 victim is 62-year-old party
 presidium candidate Pospelov,
 who has lost his assignment as
 a member of the party central
 committee's bureau of the RSFSR
 --in charge of propaganda ac-
 tivit'ie s in the Russian Repub
 lc..  He has been demoted to a
 position he held once before
 (1949-52) --director of the party's
 Institute of Marxism-Leninism.
 He replaces Gennady Obidhkin,
 the institute's director since
 1952. Pospelov remains a candi-
 date member of the party presi-
 ium, but the lesser importance
 of his new assignment makes it
 doubtful that he will be re-
 elected to the presidium at the
 October congress.
 Pospelov's removal from
 the RSFSR bureau is undoubtedly
 related to the replacement in
 late January of the deputy chair-
 man of the bureau, presidium
 member Aristov.  These actions
 appear likely to have resulted
 from competition among Khru-
 shchev's lieutenants. The re-
 lease of both these officials
 from the party secretariat in
 May 1960 "to devote full time"
 to their duties on the RSFSR
 bureau was presumably a prelude
 to their current demotions.
 Pospelov's duties in the
 bureau have been taken over by
 Mikhail Yakovlev, ambassador
 to the Congo until expelled by
 'tbo MQbvtu regimq in September
 1960. Yakovlev assumed his new
 responsibilities sometime prior
 to 4 March when, as a member of
 the bureau, he gave a speech on
 the tapk9 of the press to a con-
 forence of RUSK newspaper of-
 ficials.
 Yakovlev, 50 years old, had
 never held a top-ranking posi-
 tion.  A minor party official
 during World War II, he had
 become deputy chairman of USSR
 Gosplan by 1956 and a year
 later deputy chairman of the
 State Committee for Cultural
 Relations with Foreign Coun-
 tries. In mid-1958 he was pro-
 moted to deputy chairman, of the
 RSFSR Council of Ministers,
 presumably in charge of cul-
 tural affairs, and later re-
 ceived the additional post of
 RSFSR minister of foreign

 affairs, holding both these two
 posts until his Congo assignment
 last August.
 Now in its 13th week, the
 shake-up of government agricul-
 tural officials and the reor-
 ganization of agricultural
 agencies have involved the fir-
 ing or reassignment of nine of
 the fifteen republic agricul
 ture ministers in addition to
 USSR Agriculture Minister Vla-
 dimir Matskevich. Although most
 seem to have been made scape-
 goats for the agricultural de-
 ficiencies, a few apparently
 were moved to other responsible
 work to clear the way for ad-
 ministrators with the scientific
 and research experience needed
 to,direct the ministries in
 their new agricultural research
 functions.
 In addition, 11 provincial
 party chiefs--over half of them
 central committee members--have
 been fired in the campaign and
 several others have been given
 lateral transfers, presumably
 to break up local cliques and
 friendships. Their current loss
 of standing probably forecasts
 their exclusion from the new
 central party bodies to be
 elected in October. At present
 almost half those elected to
 those bodies at the 20th party
 congress in February 1956 appear
 slated to be dropped; since the
 congress is still seven months
 away, many others will probably
 also lose out.
 The Soviet ambassador to
 Mexico, Vladimir Bazykin, and
 his personal secretary, Vladimir
 Chernyshev, made an "unofficial"
 visit to Ecuador and Venezuela
 from 7 to 23 March. Bazykin had
 also sought visas from Panama,
 Colombia, Haiti, and Paraguay,
 planning to stay five to ten
 days in each country visited.
 Most were slow to reply, however,
 forcing him to postpone his trip
 for a month.
 By early March, only Ecua-
 dor and Venezuela had granted
 visas, Colombia had refused, and
 the requests to Panama, Haiti,
 and Paraguay were still pending.
 In answer to Paraguay's demand
 to know the "true purpose" of the
 visit, Bazykin said it was
 merely a courtesy trip and that
 he would perhaps have a chat
 with the foreign minister.
 During his stay in Ecua-
 dor, Bazykin met with the Presi-
 dent, vice president, foreign
 minister, and two other cabinet
 ministers. He also contacted
 leftists in Quito and Guayaquil
 and called on one of Ecuador's
 top Communist leaders.
 His official reception was
 cordial, but the attitude of
 the public was generally hos-
 tile.  The government rejected
 six requests to hold demonstra-
 tions, but on the night of
 Bazykin's arrival a group of
 about 50 persons burned a Soviet
 flag outside his hotel. The So-
 viet visitors had strong police
 protection, as small groups of
 demonstrators, often joined by
 passers-by, dogged them through-
 out their stay.  The Quito
 Chamber of Commerce  refused
 to meet with Bazykin, despite

 to the press that the visit was
 solely for commercial purposes
 and was made at Soviet initia-

 announced that Venezuela was in-

 form of relations with the So-
 viet Union, and also that he
 planned to go to Moscow, pos-
 sibly during his scheduled Au-
 gust trip to Tehran for the
 third conference of petroleum
 exporting nations. Following his
 initial talk with the ambassador,
 Perez indicated to the press that
 the recent increase in ~oviet
 petroleum sales outside the bloc
 is not a threat to world petro-
 leum prices or to the develop-
 ment of the Organization of Oil
 Producing Countries.(OPEP).
 After persistent efforts
 to gain an interview, Bazykin
 was received by President Betan-
 court on 22 March. Betancourt
 Chiriboga asserted that "bananas  I told him that in Venezuela, Com-
 have no ideology" and "to trade                              munists are considered "agita-

 Chiriboga told Ambassador
 Bernbaum he believed Bazykin
 made a tempting loan offer to
 President Velasco.   In his talk
 with the minister of education,
 Bazykin offered scientific and
 technical aid, and in his final
 press conference on 11 March,
 he hinted at a cultural exchange
 between the universities of
 Quito and Moscow.
 On his arrival in Caracas
 on 12 March, Bazykin stated
 that his visit was unofficial
 but that he would like to confer
 with top government officials
 and businessmen.   He claimed
 that his visit to Ecuador had
 been a great success and that
 Ecuador would send a trade dele-
 gation to the USSR in the latter
 half of April--a move which he
 characterized as "the first step
 toward the establishment of dip-
 lomatic and trade relations."
 During his 11-day stay in
 Venezuela, Bazykin spent a good
 deal of time with Minister of
 Mines and Hydrocarbons Perez
 directly from Moscow, and that
 Cuba now served as a bridgehead
 for spreading Communism through-
 out South America.   In sharp
 contrast to Perez' remarks,  the
 President also charged the USSR
 with unfair competition through
 the sale of its oil in Western
 markets.  In reply to a question,
 Betancourt said the Venezuelan
 Government would be willing to
 sell to Cuba oil from its roy-
 alty share of production;  it
 would, however, require payment
 in advance at a price equal to
 what it now receives from the
 oil companies.
 In his final press confer-
 ence Bazykin gave no indication
 that his overtures to Betancourt
 had been rebuffed and said that
 after conferring with the Presi-
 dent, five cabinet ministers,
 and congressional, university,
 and trade union leaders, he had
 the impression that most Vene-
 zuelans consider the establish-
 ment of relations with the USSR
 "a question of time and of wait-
 ing for the most opportune mo-
 ment." While re-emphasizing that

 tour of oil fields with Perez,

 DISSENSION IN ECUADOR OVER POLICY TOWARD CUBA
 President Velasco's vacil-
 lation on policy toward Cuba
 and the bloc is contributing
 to a sharp division between
 pro- and anti-Castro forces in
 Ecuador.  The principal spear-
 head of the pro-Castro element
 is Manuel Araujo,  a close
 friend of Velasco and a pro-
 moter of anti-US violence in
 Ecuador in late 1960.   Araujo,
 who was minister of government
 until December, is strongly
 disliked by the military, and
 his resignation from that post
 was reportedly caused by mili-
 tary pressure.   He is said to
 be organizing a clandestine
 group of Communists and other
 leftists to foment a Castro-
 style revolution; he may have
 coordinated his plans with
 top leaders in Cuba during his
 recent visit there.
 In a speech shortly after
 his return in late February,
 Araujo openly called for a "rev-
 olution" patterned after Cuba's,
 to begin at the conclusion of
 Velasco's term in 1964.   He
 has also waged a campaign to
 force the resignation of For-
 eign Minister Chiriboga--
 leader of the anti-Castro fac-
 tion in the government.
 The anti-Castro forces--
 which include moderate Social-
 ists as well as Conservatives,
 Liberals, and the Catholic
 hierarchy--have been aroused
 by the pro'Communist tendencies
 in Ecuadorean policy and have
 petitioned for a break in re-
 lations with Cuba.   Some of
 these elements, led by former
 President Ponce, have been
 considering ousting Velasco.
 This group may have significant
 support from active and retired
 officers.   The former army
 commander, an enemy of Velasco
 as well as of Araujo; was ar-
 rested on 23 March for involve-
 ment in the plotting.
 Velasco has not only Cul-
 tivated the good will of the
 Cuban regime, which is support-
 ing Ecuador in its boundary
 dispute with Peru, but also has
 publicly expressed his confi-
 dence in Araujo since the lat-
 ter's return from Cuba.   Indi-
 cations of an impending shake-
 up in the cabinet--probably
 including the removal of Chiri-
 boga--and the reported reassign-
 ment of a number of anti-Com-
 munist officers suggest that
 Velasco is leaning toward the
 pro-Castro group and is con-
 cerned with the growing opposi-
 tion of rightists.
 This domestic unrest
 threatens the success of the
 11th.Inter-American Conference,
 scheduled to begin in Quito on
 24 May.   The prospect that
 Castro may attend and that
 Ecuador will insist on dis-
 cussing its boundary dispute
 with Peru--a nationalistic
 issue which could touch off
 widespread violence--are other
 disruptive factors.

 The resignation of Army
 Commander in Chief Toranzo Mon-
 tero has at least temporarily
 strengthened the Frondizi govern-
 ment in Argentina, in that it un-
 derscores the armed forces' re-
 jection of threats to constitu-
 tional government. The resigna-
 tion resulted from a showdown
 with War Secretary Fraga over
 the long-standing issue of mili-
 tary pressure on President Fron-
 dizi's policies.
 Toranzo Montero's formal
 letter of resignation, which he
 released to the press one hour
 after he sent it to Fraga on 25
 March, was a virtual admission
 of his desire to overthrow Fron-

 nism, and made a critical refer-
 ence to Argentina's offer on 4
 March of its good offices to ease
 US-Cuban tensions. Although he
 overplayed his hand, Toranzo Mon-

 within the military and has
 warned that he will be "active
 on the sidelines."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ISRAELI AID IN AFRICA
 A recent speech by Israeli
 Foreign Minister Golda Meir in-
 dicates that Israel, despite the
 anti-Israel resolution adopted
 in January at the African "sum-
 mit" conference in Casablanca,
 has decided to continue expanding
 its foreign aid program in Af-
 rica. Mrs. Meir discounted the
 Casablanca resolution, which was
 inspired by the UAR, as having
 been prompted by only a "tempo-
 rary need" to support slogans
 harmful to Israel. She said it
 does not reflect "the entire po-
 litical balance sheet" of Israel's
 relations with African states.
 The resolution criticized
 Israel as "an instrument of im-
 perialism and neocolonialism"
 in Africa as well as the Middle
 East.  Its signatories included
 the heads of state of Ghana,
 Guinea, and Mali, each of which
 receives Israeli aid, as well
 as of the UAR and Morocco. Sub-
 sequent Israeli representations
 to the governments of the first
 three evoked. reiterations of
 their support of the resolution,
 although Ghana's Nkrumah gave
 private assurances of continued
 good will toward Israel. The
 three, nevertheless, appear
 ready to accept aid from any
 source, and on that basis the
 Israelis have decided to con-
 tinue assisting them.
 Mrs. Meir said Israel would
 send 400 government experts to
 Africa and Asia during 1961; ap-
 proximately 500 nongovernmental
 technicians also have been sent.
 Israel maintains 160 missions in
 35 countries in Africa and Asia.
 Ghana is still the program's
 showcase. More than 100 Israeli
 experts in agriculture, marine
 navigation, and construction are
 serving there, while numerous
 Ghanaians are taking courses in
 Israel. Mali is one of the newest
 recipients of Israeli aid, hav-
 ing received small arms--subse-
 quent to the Casablanca confer-
 ence--under terms which made
 them virtually a gift.
 About 1,000 foreign trainees
 are scheduled to attend courses
 in Israel this year. The training
 program includes academic studies
 at the Haifa Institute of Tech-
 nology and the Hebrew University
 in Jerusalem as well as a five-
 year medical course and a four-
 year curriculum in agricultural
 engineering. Military courses are
 also conducted; about 200 Ethio-
 pian paratroopers recently were
 trained by the Israelis.
 Seminars in various fields
 are. held periodically,.   Last
 August,  Israel was host to 126
 delegates from 41 countries at
 an international conference onM
 ''Science in the' Advancement of
 New States." The African and
 Asian delegations were urged to
 look to Israel as a training
 ground for technicians and for
 ideas and research facilities.
 Another venture in Tel
 Iviv, the Afro-Asian Institute
 for Labor Studies, is sponsored
 Jointly by the Israel Federation
 of Labor (Histadrut),and the
 AFL-CIO.   Sixty-four students
 from 31 African and Asian coun-
 tries currently are attending
 the first of a series of six-
 month courses. The purpose of
 the school is to demonstrate
 Israel's rapid economic develop-
 ment under a democratic politi-
 cal system to labor leaders and
 members of cooperatives from
 underdeveloped areas.

 It remains to be seen
 whether, in the face of the
 Arab countercampaign, the Is-
 raeli program will reap signif-
 icant political advaii.tages for
 Tel Aviv.   Despite the Casa-
 blanca resolution, the Israelis
 apparently still feel that they
 can count on gaining diplomatic
 benefits, particularly when the
 Arabs press their perennial
 grievances on Palestine in the
 UN.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 BELGIAN GOVERNMENT PROSPECTS
 The success of the Social-
 ist party in the elections on
 26 March has increased the
 likelihood that Belgium's next
 government will be a coalition
 of the Social Christian and
 Socialist parties, with Paul
 Henri Spaak, Socialist leader
 and former secretary general
 of NATO, playing a prominent
 role.   While no major changes
 in foreign policy are antici-
 pated, Spaak has been privately
 critical of some of his coun-
 try's moves in the Congo and
 would probably bring about
 greater Belgian cooperation
 both there and in NATO matters.
 The opposition Socialists,
 who had been generally expected
 to suffer marked losses as a
 result of the Socialist-led
 strikes in December and Janu-
 ary, actually gained both in
 popular votes and Senate seats
 and held their own in the lower
 house.   Some left-wing Social-
 ists apparently defected to
 the Communists, who gained
 three additional seats in the
 lower house.   The Social Chris-
 tians, the leading partner in
 Premier Eyskens' coalition,
 lost heavily--mainly to two
 right-wing groups which rallied
 support from conservative-
 minded voters dissatisfied with
 Eyskens' handling of the Congo
 crisis and the subsequent eco-
 nomic austerity law.  The con-
 servative Liberals, junior part-
 ners in the coalition, gained
 popular votes although they
 lost one of their 21 seats in
 the lower house.
 Eyskens' government is con-
 tinuing in a caretaker capacity
 until some agreement can be
 reached among the parties--none
 of which has a majority in
 either house.   The chairman of
 the Social Christian party,
 Theo Lefevre, favors cooperation
 with the Socialists but faces
 strong opposition from the
 COMMUNISTS 5(+3)

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 middle-class wing of his party,
 which wants instead to continue
 the coalition with the Liberals.
 The Labor elements in his party
 have for some time been more in-
 clined toward an alliance with
 the Socialists, and moderate
 elements in both these parties
 believe that the difficult eco-
 nomic readjustments ahead re-
 quire a coalition of Belgium's
 two largest parties.
 Spaak would probably play
 a leading role--either as pre-
 mier or foreign minister--in
 any such coalition.   Having been
 out of Belgian party politics
 from 1957 until a few weeks ago,
 he is less committed than any
 other prominent leader to Bel-
 gium's past actions in the Congo,
 and on 13 March in a conversa-
 tion with the American charge
 in Brussels he voiced strong
 criticism of the Congo policies
 of the Belgian Government. Both
 on Congo questions and in any
 effort to strengthen Belgium's
 support of NATO, Spaak would face
 strong opposition, even in his
 own party, to any major change
 in government policy, but he
 would be able to exercise more
 stringent control over the Min-
 istry of Foreign Affairs and
 reduce the  freewheeling activity
 of officials in the Ministries
 of Defense and African Affairs
 regarding the Congo.
 The first task of any new
 government will be to put Bel-
 gium's fiscal house in order and
 stimulate the growth of the econ-
 omy.   Lefevre, in his effort to
 improve prospects for a coali-
 tion with the Socialists, has
 said that a new long-range fi-
 nancial and economic program
 should be substituted for the
 controversial "loi unique,"
 which provoked the strikes and
 was finally adopted in February
 over Socialist opposition.
 INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS
 Measures to make the
 International Confederation of
 Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) a
 more effective instrument for
 advancing free trade unionism,
 particularly in the under-
 developed areas of the world,
 were the principal topic of
 discussion at an extraordinary
 session of the ICFTU's execu-
 tive board in Brussels from 13
 to 17 March.   Some progress
 appears to have been made, but
 the constructive atmosphere
 which prevailed may have been
 achieved in part by agreement
 to avoid a showdown on several
 basic issues.
 The major item on the agenda
 was a plan providing for the re-
 grouping of primary ICFTU ac-
 tivities--such as education,
 training, and organizing support
 --under three or four new as-
 sistant secretaries-general.
 The ICFTU'?s bureaucratic  in-
 efficiency has long been de-
 cried by its affiliates, and
 Secretary General Becu's de-
 lay in proposing correctives
 caused a major quarrel at the
 executive board meeting last
 December.
 How soon and how effec
 tively Becu's new plan will be
 implemented remains to be seen.
 Only two of the new posts have
 been filled, and one of these
 by an appointee who encountered
 opposition from certain of the
 powerful International Trade
 Secretariats on which the ICFTU
 leans heavily for support in
 the organizing field.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 in the developing areas of Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America also
 produced somewhat uncertain re-
 sults.   About three fourths of
 the $10,000,000 sought by the
 ICFTU's International Solidarity
 Fund for the next three years
 has now been pledged.   Satisfac-
 tion over the AFL-CIO's offer of
 $3,250,000 ($750,000 less than
 had been asked for) is tempered,
 however, by the total default of
 the British Trades Union Congress
 (TUC), already in arrears on past
 contributions.   TUC delegate
 George Woodcock declared that the
 British unions "cannot afford"
 their proposed $2,250,000, and
 would make no further contribu-
 tionsto the fund.
 Although there is some hope
 that a TUC contribution will be
 forthcoming before the 1962 ICFTU
 congress, Becu and other leaders
 are nonetheless concerned over
 the British attitude.   Woodcock
 not only questioned the ICFTU's
 need for "large amounts" of money,
 but added that the ICFTU should
 concern itself primarily with
 "economic and social matters."
 By implication this would seem
 to indicate a lack of sympathy
 for the ICFTU's increasing em-
 phasis on organizational activ-
 ities--a.. program which other
 trade union leaders think essen-
 tial if free trade unionism is
 to establish itself in areas now
 in the process of industrializa-
 tion.
 On the problem of uncoordi-
 nated, unilateral activities by
 affiliates in such areas--long a
 source of friction among the
 ICFTU, AFL-CIO, and TUC--the
 ICFTU appears to have beat a
 strategic retreat.   Apparently
 reconciled to the continuation
 of such activities, Becu pro-
 posed only that they be under-
 taken in "consultation" with the
 ICFTU.   Although probably a more
 realistic assessment of the
 ICFTU'srelationship to its,"major
 affiliates,  this stand leaves
 much to good faith and contrasts
 with past ICFTU predictions that
 an uncoordinated approach, partic-
 ularly, to the complicated trade
 union situation in Africa,  is
 bound to fail.
 The Chinese Communists,
 determined to achieve status as
 a world power as quickly as pos-
 sible, are giving high priority
 to science and technology.   They
 now are in the fifth year of a
 12-year scientific development
 program drawn up in 1956 under
 the aegis of Mao Tse-tung and
 Chou En-lai.   The program, which
 concentrates Chinese effort in
 11 priority technological fields
 --including atomic energy and
 jet propulsion, is being execut-
 ed in an orderly manner with
 much zeal and determination.
 Significant successes have been
 achieved, but the program's an-
 nounced goal of attaining
 "world levels of achievement" by
 1967 is beyond reach.
 China's small nucleus of
 competent, Western-trained sci-
 entists is being slowly augment
 ed  by students trained in bloc
 countries.   However, research
 and development are limited by
 a shortage of scientific man-
 power and by China's heavy de-
 pendence on Soviet technical
 assistance, sharply curtailed
 by the withdrawal of Soviet
 technicians last summer.   Never-
 theless, native capabilities are
 probably adequate to provide some
 spectacular results from a few
 high-priority projects in both
 the military and economic
 sectors.
 In addition, China is ac-
 quiring the capability for

 armaments and for routine tech-
 nological support in economic
 areas, but high-quality scientif-
 ic resources are not expanding
 rapidly enough to meet all crit-
 ical needs in agriculture and in-
 dustry.
 Achievements in public
 health have been impressive. Ep-
 idemic diseases have been re-
 duced, and concepts of sanita-
 tion among the people have been
 widely established.   General
 health practices are still poor,
 however, and the control of com-
 mon diseases such as bacillary
 dysentery, tuberculosis, and
 schistosomiasis will be far from
 complete during the remainder
 of the program.  A shortage of
 doctors trained in Western
 medicine forces the regime to
 continue to support and encour-
 age traditional Chinese practi-
 tioners.
 Research in physics, chem-
 istry, and metallurgy remains
 relatively primitive, and the
 level of performance in these
 sectors is not expected to im-
 prove greatly in the next few
 years.   Biological and agri-
 cultural research and develop-
 ment programs have also been
 poor, especially in relation
 to the pressing demand in China
 to raise food production. Any
 tangible benefits to agriculture
 from this quarter during the
 plan will probably come from the
 application of known practices.
 The entire program is ham-
 pered by a lack of adequate re-
 search facilities.   These facil-
 ities are growing, especially
 in priority military and in-
 dustrial areas, a.nd are prob-
 ably keeping pace with the growth
 in trained personnel in most
 fields of science and technology.
 As of the moment, however, only
 about 1,000 highly trained sci-
 entists are available to plan,
 supervise, and carry out activity
 that would be considered signif-
 icant in Western scientific cir-
 cles.   Graduates of China's own
 scientific schools  are  not
 well  trained  by world  stand-
 ards                                                             and  are not sufficient-

 Czechoslovakia, second only
 to the USSR as a contributor to
 the bloc's foreign aid program,

 $660,000,000, compared with the
 Soviet aid total of $3.8 bil-
 lion and a Chinese Communist aid
 total of $350,000,000.   About
 half of the Czech aid is being
 provided for economic develop-
 ment projects, the remainder for
 military equipment.   Some of the
 major bloc arms agreements, par-
 ticularly those signed with Mid-
 dle Eastern countries in 1955-56,
 were negotiated by Czechoslovakia.
 In addition, Czechoslovakia is

 relations with countries in Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America.

 extended for single light in-
 dustrial and consumer projects,
 to private companies as well as
 to governments.   From 1954 to
 1958 Czechoslovakia initiated
 the bloc economic aid program
 in six countries in Asia and
 Latin America with small short-
 term credits for such projects
 as cement plants, sugar refin-
 eries, and textile mills. Since
 1959, however, there has been a
 trend toward providing longer
 term lines of credits to be used
 for public development projects'
 the largest single line of cred-
 it--$48,500,000--was extended
 to India in 1959. With the ex-
 ception of about $4,000,000 in
 grant aid to Guinea, Cambodia,
 and Somalia, all Czech aid has
 been in the form of credits.
 25X1
 25X1
 Total Czech economic aid
 to the underdeveloped countries
 since 1954 amounts to $335,000,-
 000, about a fourth of which has
 been used.   India,  Indonesia,
 the UAR, Iraq, and Cuba have
 been the principal recipients,
 but significant credits have
 been provided to Ethiopia and
 Guinea and a new credit of an
 unknown amount has been extended
 to Cambodia.   The most recent
 Czech aid was a $1.4 million
 grant to Somalia--the first bloc
 overture to that country.
 Prague has undertaken its
 largest projects in India, where,
 in addition to the several ce-
 ment plants and sugar refiner-
 ies already constructed, a large
 foundry project, a heavy machine
 tool plant, and a heavy elec-
 trical machinery plant are
 planned for construction in the
 next few years.   Indonesia,
 Iraq, and the UAR have received
 significant Czech lines of cred-
 it for industrial development,
 and the first bloc aid extended
 to the Castro government was a
 Czech line of credit for $20,-
 000,000 in June 1960.
 In addition to the aid ex-
 tended on its own account, the
 Czechs are participating in
 projects involving Soviet eco-
 nomic credits.   In Egypt, for
 example, Czechoslovakia is pro-
 viding under Soviet credits equip-
 ment for several industrial
 projects and the Aswan dam con-
 struction.
 Significant Czech aid of-
 fers outstanding include a cred-
 it offer to Bolivia for mineral
 processing and an offer of both
 economic and military aid to
 Ecuador.

 of the equipment under these
 agreements probably was sup--
 plied by the USSR.   Czechoslo-
 vakia was the first bloc coun-
 try to extend military aid to a
 nonbloc country, concluding arms
 agreements with both Egypt in
 1955 ,and Syria in 1956. Under
 these arrangements, Czechoslo-
 vakia provided the material and
 apparently assumed much of the
 financial burden.
 In the 1956 agreement with
 Yemen, however, Czechoslovakia
 --though  it negotiated the deal
 and provided some arms--probably
 fronted for the USSR.
 In recent years, Czecho-
 slovakia, although still used
 as the bloc's initial contact
 for arms deals, has acted main-
 ly as a participant in agree-
 ments between the Soviet Union
 and nonbloc countries, supplying
 arms, equipment, and training
 often not available in the USSR.
 The first Indonesian arms
 deal in 1958 apparently was an
 exception;-,Prague carried out
 the entire agreement, probably
 because of Djakarta's unwilling-
 ness at that time to become di-
 rectly involved in an arms deal
 with Moscow.
 Virtually all the military
 credits arranged by Czechoslo-
 vakia have been used.
 Czechoslovakia's chief con-
 tribution to the bloc offensive
 to promote closer economic ties
 with the underdeveloped countries
 continues to be in the-field of
 trade.. In many.areas the bloc has
 established economic ties solely
 through Czech commercial initia-
 tives. In some countries, while
 other bloc states, particularly
 the USSR, are involved in an aid
 program,Czech activities have been
 restricted to increasing trade.
 Czech activities in 'Mali; -for
 example, have been concentrated on
 establishing commercial relations.
 Under an agreement with the USSR
 and Czechoslovakia,Mali will sell
 most of its peanut crop--its prin-
 cipal export--to the bloc during
 the next year. Both the USSR and
 Communist China have initiated an
 aid program in Mali.
 Czechoslovakia's trade with
 the underdeveloped countries in-
 creased from $175,000,000 in
 1954 to an estimated $415,000,-
 000 in 1960.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Recent announcements by
 several key Western UN members
 that they will no longer sup-
 port the moratorium on Chinese
 UN representation indicate that
 time has run out for Taipei in
 the United Nations.   The grow-
 ing opposition to postponing
 discussion of either the entry
 of Peiping or the ouster of
 Taipei does not necessarily
 imply support for Peiping's
 admission but does reflect a
 long-held belief among UN mem-
 bers that the organization must
 come to grips with the problem.
 The General Assembly at
 each of the past ten sessions
 has voted a moratorium on con-
 sideration of the Chinese repre-
 sentation question.   This pro-
 cedural device for delaying a
 decision requires only a simple
 majority of votes.   Any vote on
 the substance, of the issue--
 ouster of Taipei or admission
 of Peiping--would presumably re-
 quire a two-thirds. majority.
 In the first five of these
 sessions,,over two.-thirds favored
 the moratorium.   Since 1956,
 however, as new UN members have
 rapidly increased the size of
 the-organization, the moratorium
 has mustered only a simple ma-'
 jority; in October 1960 it was
 approved by the smallest margin
 since 1951, when the issue first
 arose.   This setback to Taipei's
 position was compounded by
 statements ' from.    various
 African delegates that their
 abstentions were grudgingly
 given and would not be repeated
 in the future.   After the last
 ballot, the general mood of
 many supporters of the mora-
 torium was that it would not
 pass again.
 Since October,' there has
 been increasing speculation about
 IN THE UNITED NATIONS
 the future of Nationalist China,
 sparked notably by statements
 from Britain and Brazil that
 they would no longer support
 the moratorium.   Uncertainty
 among UN members about the
 position of the new US admini-
 stration has also encouraged
 speculation.
 Although the Chinese repre-
 sentation issue was postponed
 for the duration of the 15th
 General Assembly session--which
 resumed on 7 March after a two-
 month recess--Peiping's sup-
 porters could attempt to re-
 open the question at the cur-
 rent session, though it would
 require a two-thirds majority
 to reverse the previous de-
 cision.
 Factors Affecting Peiping's
 Admission
 Some UN members argue for
 Peiping's admission to the UN
 because they subscribe to the
 concept of the universality of
 UN membership.   Members are also
 influenced by the desire to
 bind the Chinese Communists not
 only to the principles of the
 UN Charter but to any inter-
 national agreement that may be
 reached on disarmament or the
 banning of nuclear tests--
 which they believe-would be ac-
 cepted by the United Nations
 as a whole.
 Other members are eager to
 see Peiping exposed to the rough-
 and-tumble of UN debates and
 voting line-ups;  they see in
 these encounters an opportunity
 to exploit any differences be-
 tween Peiping and Moscow.
 The gradual erosion of
 Taipei's position in the UN,more-
 over, has: resulted in some un-
 easiness among its supporters,
 who by no means want to be the
 "last to recognize" Peiping.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Probably the greatest ob-
 stacles to Peiping's admission
 are its belligerence and its
 opposition to any proposal that
 would accord some international
 status to the Nationalists--
 even as "Taiwan" or "Formosa."
 Many of Peiping's supporters
 are reluctant to scuttle Taipei
 completely.  As a charter mem-
 ber, Nationalist China has con-
 tributed greatly to the develop-
 ment of the United Nations, and
 Dr. Tsiang, its permanent repre-
 sentative since 1947, is held
 in high esteem as a parliamen-
 tarian.
 Strong resistance to Pei- -
 ping's entry on the part of the
 United States has been a primary
 factor.''In September 1959, how-
 ever, Latin American irritation
 over the problem of Chinese UN
 representation was summed up by
 the Brazilian delegate when he
 stated that support for the
 moratorium was "the heaviest
 burden the Latin American coun-
 tries had to bear in return for
 US friendship."
 There remains on the UN
 books a 1951 resolution brand-
 ing Communist China an aggres-
 sor in Korea; the UN embargo on
 strategic shipments to the main-
 land was a direct outgrowth of
 this resolution.   However, a
 precedent favorable to Peiping's
 cause was set in 1955 when Spain
 was admitted to the UN despite
 a 1946 UN resolution condemning
 its conduct.
 Chinese Communist Foreign
 Minister Chen Yi was recently
 quoted as saying that Peiping
 will not enter the UN until the
 US ends its "occupation" of
 Taiwan and withdraws its forces
 from the area.   Many UN members
 which now support Peiping would
 probably not accept the idea
 that such a concession could
 be made a prerequisite for Com-
 munist China's entry in the UN.
 Commonwealth and Europe
 Certain Western European
 states and "old Commonwealth"
 members like Australia, while
 supporting the moratorium, have
 for many years believed that
 Peiping's recognition and its
 admission to the UN were in-
 evitable but that it was not
 yet time for such action.   They
 felt that in the meantime, closer
 de facto relations with Commu-
 nist China would reduce the
 general tension and might make
 the act of eventual recognition
 easier.   They looked on the
 gradual deterioration of the
 Nationalists' UN position as
 part of the process.
 The statement by British
 Foreign Secretary Home on 8
 February that Communist China
 should be seated in the United
 Nations has been subsequently
 amplified in a privately ex-
 pressed view by the Foreign Of-
 fice that Taipei's supporters
 would not even be able to at-
 tach conditions to the seating
 of Peiping.   On the other hand,
 the Foreign Office would oppose
 admitting the Chinese Communists
 if they insisted on UN recogni-
 tion that Taiwan belonged to
 them or that the 1951 aggres-
 sion charge against Communist
 China be expunged from UN re-
 cords.
 At the Commonwealth prime
 ministers' conference in London
 from 8 to 17 March, the majority
 apparently endorsed London's
 contention that Peiping should
 be seated--and Taipei presumably
 excluded.  Australia and New
 Zealand--both with considerable
 public opinion favoring recogni-
 tion of Peiping--appear reluctant
 to modify their opposition to
 its admission to the UN now, but
 they may go along with Britain
 if it refuses to support the
 moratorium again.   Canada has

 A French Foreign Ministry

 Kreisky recently stated that
 there would be "no difficulty
 for Austria" in recognizing the
 Peiping regime, but that his
 government's future attitude
 in the UN--it now abstains on

 on circumstances."
 The Scandinavian countries

 have opposed the moratorium for
 many years.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 modest construction program,
 including carrier aircraft and
 submarines.
 The Defense Committee
 speculated, on the basis of
 Defense Ministry estimates,
 that long-range equipment needs
 would entail expenditures of
 nearly $8.8 billion in a second
 five-year program to run through
 1969,   The missile program would
 get the largest increases in
 that period, when it will be at
 the production stage.   The com-
 mittee's concern over the em-
 phasis on missiles at the ex-
 pense of conventional-force
 modernization was reflected in
 its expression of hope that
 funds allocated for army and
 navy equipment categories would
 also be greatly increased.
 De Gaulle's Modifications
 While the main lines of
 the current reorganization and
 modernization antedate De Gaulle's
 return to power,  he has pro-
 vided the political stability
 and continuity which such a
 long-range program requires
 and has taken personal charge
 of its implementation.   Thus
 he saw to it that the constitu-
 tion of the Fifth Republic made
 his title of commander in chief
 more explicit than the nominal
 authority assigned to the presi-
 dents of the Fourth Republic.
 A long-planned revision
 of the concept of "national
 defense" was effected with 'the
 drastic defense decree of early
 1959 which gives the government
 practically unlimited control
 over civilians in time of emer-
 gency.   He has modified the
 1957 plan to accelerate the
 creation of a nuclear strike
 force at the expense of a more
 balanced program for all the
 services, and many of his
 command changes and staff re-
 organizations have seemed de-
 signed as much to ensure mili-
 tary loyalty and responsiveness
 to himself and his policies as
 to modernize the French armed
 services.
 It is also evident that
 he has modified or ignored some
 of the major political prerequi-
 sites postulated by the staff
 which framed the reorganization
 and modernization plan of 1957.
 These included "firm attachment
 to the Atlantic pact" and a
 "long-term" solution in Algeria,
 implying "no abandonment."
 For example, when De Gaulle
 was both premier and defense
 minister in 1958, he created
 the post of chief of the Nation-
 al Defense Staff as the "su-
 preme military authority of the
 land," and installed the widely
 respected Ely in it.   Ely took
 over the important coordinating
 functions of the former Perma-
 nent General Secretariat of De-
 fense, which under the Fourth
 Republic had been headed by a
 civil servant, and also most of
 the functions of the General
 Staff of the Armed Forces, whose
 new chief was a lower-ranking
 general.
 The latter's authority
 over individual service chiefs
 of staff was further reduced
 by dividing their responsibili-
 ties into administrative and
 operational categories and
 putting the administrative
 matters under a civilian "minis-
 ter delegate" for each service.
 The effects of ill-defined and
 overlapping authority were com-
 pounded by De Gaulle's habit
 as president and commander in
 chief of issuing orders or making
 his wishes known without regard
 for regular channels.

 The Changes in top-level
 commands announced in February
 appear primarily intended to
 place absolutely loyal Gaullists
 in key positions and generally
 to strengthen De Gaulle's con-
 trol over the services, particu-
 larly the army.   Thus his former
 personal military adviser,
 General Jean Olie, who on 1
 March succeeded Ely as chief of
 staff for national defense, is
 expected to work much more
 closely with De Gaulle than did
 Ely, who scrupulously respected
 the constitutional requirement
 that he report directly to the
 premier rather than to the presi-
 dent.
 General Crepin has been
 succeeded by a more politically
 sophisticated officer, General
 Fernand Gambiez, as commander
 in chief in Algeria.   In turn
 the designation of Crepin to
 be commander of French forces
 in Germany ensures that this
 major body of combat troops will
 remain responsive to De Gaulle.
 This evidently could not be
 guaranteed under its present
 commander, General Paul Allard,
 who is a proponent of "French
 Algeria."
 A major reorganization
 of the National Defense Staff
 structure was approved in
 principle on 1 March.   It will
 reportedly eliminate the three
 civilian minister delegates
 and will establish a Delegation
 for Armaments,. directly sub-
 ordinate to the minister of
 armed forces, which would have
 responsibility for all arms
 programs--both conventional and
 nuclear.   Informed speculation
 on other aspects of the reorgan-
 ization sees the French de-
 fense forces divided into three
 categories (deterrent, interior
 defense, intervention) which
 correspond to those foreseen
 when the program law was passed.
 Military Reactions
 Although the armed forces
 approved of many of De Gaulle's
 moves in the defense field,
 many officers have had increas-
 ing misgivings over the long-
 range effect on French security
 of his Algerian policy.   Many,
 including Ely himself, are also
 concerned about the over-all
 wisdom of De Gaulle's coolness
 toward NATO.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The 1960 program law's em-
 phasis on the creation of a nu-
 clear striking force was round-
 ly criticized by a wide range
 of political and military lead-
 ers as wastefully expensive and
 absurd from the standpoint of
 realistic power relations--par-
 ticularly after the US proposals
 to make NATO a "nuclear power."
 The nuclear strike force was
 also criticized by many who
 felt the army was being denied
 the new and replacement materiel
 and equipment it needed to win
 the Algerian war.
 The recently approved plan
 for armaments centralization
 is already being criticized,
 particularly by the navy, which
 is jealous of its weapons and
 supply system and will probably
 be inclined to resist the army
 general who seems the most like-
 ly candidate for "delegate for
 armament."
 For much of the army, the
 entire reorganization program
 is likely to be viewed sourly
 against the background of the
 unfulfilled conditions postu-
 lated when the-original plan
 was formulated in 1957.  Facing
 the prospect of leaving Algeria
 without a complete victory and
 feeling that the program law
 discriminates against the army,
 many officers are reportedly
 talking of leaving the service.
 While a number of army of-
 ficers will probably be re-
 leased in any event as the post-
 Algerian demobilization and re-
 organization shapes up, the ma-
 jority will undoubtedly remain.
 Nevertheless,  for many whose
 military orientation in recent
 years has focused on guerrilla
 warfare and on retaining Al-
 geria at all costs, the polit-
 ical and technical reorienta-
 tion would be difficult.   Stu-
 dents of the army's structure
 have already pointed to the in-
 creasing opportunities of ad-
 vancement which modernization
 will offer the comparatively
 few highly technically trained
 younger officers at the expense
 of their infantry-oriented
 seniors.
 Many responsible military
 leaders also reportedly are
 apprehensive over the possible
 effect, the condemnation of the
 Algerian war by many French in-
 tellectual and religious lead-
 ers may have on the morale of
 future conscripts.   These of-
 ficers complain that the army
 is being increasingly isolated
 from the nation by such activi-
 ties.
 Outlook
 Those who for political
 or military reasons wish to
 arrest or modify the program
 must reckon with the fact that
 much of it is now several years
 old--particularly the nuclear
 weapons effort--and that the
 passage of time will increas-
 ingly consolidate it along
 lines marked out by De Gaulle.
 There also seems to be agree-
 ment that he has increasingly
 imposed his will on the armed
 forces--particularly~the army--
 and can be expected to move
 skillfully to parry and over-
 come opposition elements.
 Nevertheless, it is also ap-
 parent that De Gaulle--in si-
 multaneously requiring the armed
 services to accept his version
 of the reorganization plan
 while he prepares what many will
 regard as an inglorious with-
 drawal from Algeria--still runs
 a considerable risk in defying
 entrenched interests in the
 armed forces and a gamut of po-
 litical leaders with varying
 axes to grind on this issue.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Trofim D. Lysenko, the
 controversial Soviet scientist
 who in Stalin's time had wide
 influence in the fields of agri-
 culture and biology,                         is regain-
 ing--at least in agriculture--
 some of the authority he lost
 after Stalin's death.   His ap-
 pearance at the January central
 committee plenum on agriculture
 and the appointment of his ad-
 herent M. A.  Olshansky as min-
 ister of agriculture are evi-
 dence of the increase in
 Lysenko's political prestige.
 Reputable scientists view
 Lysenko as a charlatan, and his
 rise at a time when Khrushchev
 is calling- for the application
 of the best scientific effort
 to the solution of the USSR's
 agricultural problems appears
 something of an anomaly.
 on the basis of the immediate
 applicability of their research
 in industry or agriculture.
 Rising Political Prestige
 In his speech to the plenum
 on 14 January, Lysenko sharply
 attacked the work of former
 Minister of Agriculture V. V.
 Matskevich and urged reorganiza-
 tion of the ministry itself.
 He charged that the ministry
 had ignored his cattle-breeding
 experiments and, in fact, thought
 so little of them that his
 breeding stock had been slaugh-
 tered for meat.   He complained
 that his 20-page protest, ad-
 dressed to the-.ministry six
 months earlier, had not been
 acknowledged until January. At
 this point Khrushchev commented
 caustically,  "They read slowly
 in the Ministry of Agriculture."
 Khrushchev's personal eval-
 uation of Lysenko,  expressed
 privately to visiting Westerners
 in the spring of 1956 when Ly-
 senko's career appeared to be
 in eclipse,  suggests that the
 Soviet leader himself is the
 source of his reviving influ-
 ence:   "As to Lysenko, opinions
 about his theories vary.   It is
 necessary to discuss and com-
 pare in order to evaluate cor"
 rectly all theories.   Lysenko
 is one of our prominent agron-
 omists,   but he has the charac-
 ter of a dog....  (Other) scien-
 tists fear his bad nature.
 Nevertheless, I repeat that he
 is a very prominent agronomist.
 Many pseudo-scientists who
 criticize him are not worth his
 little finger."  At this point
 Mikoyan interjected:   "You
 exaggerate."
 The Soviet premier's public
 praise of Lysenko has emphasized
 his "close ties with life," a
 favorite Khrushchev theme in
 science and education programs.
 Khrushchev has often voiced sus-
 picion of scientists concerned
 with basic theoretical research
 for their failure to contribute
 directly to the national econ-
 omy; last year he recommended
 that all scientists be paid only
 Other high-ranking poli-
 tician   at  the  plenum took
 pains to make it clear that they
 did not share Matskevich's in-
 difference to Lysenko's work.
 D. S. Polyansky, premier of the
 Russian Republic (RSFSR), stated,
 "We have all the requirements to
 obtain highly productive cows
 yielding milk with a high butter-
 fat content--cows which are be-
 ing developed under the direc-
 tion of the outstanding scien-
 tist  T. D. Lysenko."
 T.  I.  Sokolov, party boss
 of the agriculturally important
 Tselinnyy (New Lands) Kray,
 linked Khrushchev and Lysenko
 in praise:   "We are confident
 that the reorganization of the
 Ministry of Agriculture--carried
 out on the initiative of N.  S.
 Khrushchev--the further consoli-
 dation and development of the
 Michurin trend in science--
 headed by the remarkable worker
 and outstanding scientist. T. D.
 Lysenko--will secure the further
 development of all phases of
 agriculture on a correct scien-
 tific foundation." (I. V.

 Burbank of Russia, preceded
 Lysenko in asserting that hered-
 itary variation, is the result

 of the effects of environmental
 changes.)
 Lithuanian party boss A.
 Yu.  Snechkus called attention
 to the fact that Lysenko's cat-
 tle would soon be introduced
 into the Lithuanian  livestock
 program and that Lithuanian
 farms would apply mixtures of
 organic-chemical fertilizers
 as advocated by Lysenko.
 Olshansky, whose appoint-
 ment as minister of agriculture
 was announced on 29 December,
 has been described by other
 scientists as a close associate
 and "a true disciple" of Ly-
 senko.   Olshansky is to have
 fabricated research to prove
 Lysenko's theories and then be-
 lieved what he had fabricated.
 Both Olshansky and Lysenko ac-
 companied Khrushchev to Kiev in
 late   January on the first leg
 of the premier's inspection
 tour of agricultural.areas. Ly-
 senko joined Khrushchev on the
 speakers' platform at the con-
 ference of RSFSR agricultural
 workers in Moscow in late Feb-
 ruary.   Both Lysenko and 01-
 shansky appeared with him at
 the meeting of agricultural
 workers in Akmolinsk in mid-
 March, and Olshansky also ac-
 companied him to the Kazakh
 agricultural workers' meeting
 in Alma-Ata.
 Khrushchev has continued
 to heap public praise on Ly-
 senko.   In Moscow on 23 February
 he commented:   "It Is  a good
 thing to study with scientists
 who are closely connected with
 life, such as Academician
 Trofim D.       Lysenko.   I myself
 have listened a good deal to him
 and his pupils, and have sev-
 eral times visited his farm
 near Moscow, and the Odessa in-
 stitute.                            I recall with grati-
 tude the talks which I had with
 him."
 With Olshansky heading the
 reorganized Ministry of Agri-
 culture and with Khrushchev's
 admiration publicly expressed
 and echoed by other party
 leaders,  Lysenko is clearly in
 a position to exert significant
 influence in the programing of
 research in agricultural insti-
 tutes.
 Theory on Heredity
 Lysenko's career began in
 the early 1930s,when he achieved
 some success in accelerating the
 maturation of plants by treating
 the seeds before planting.   His
 experiments were not scientifi-
 cally controlled, and the con-
 clusions he drew went far beyond
 anything that could be supported
 by the results achieved.
 Contradicting all other
 scientific work in genetics, he
 has insisted that genes and
 chromosomes are sinister bour-
 geois myths,  and that the whole
 living organism draws inherit-
 able characteristics from its
 environment. Hereditary changes
 can thus,  in his view, be di-
 rected by man's changing the
 environment and need not depend
 on accidental mutations or on
 the limited changes possible
 through selective breeding.
 These theories,  although
 without demonstrated scientific
 basis, are compatible with
 Marxist doctrine and may even
 be taken seriously by their pro-
 pounder, whose scientific edu-
 cation,  received during the
 1920s, was quite haphazard.   In
 addition to being politically
 useful, his theories have always
 been attractive because they
 promise shortcuts to agricultural
 gains which more orthodox genet-
 icists, promise only over a long
 period of time.   This, indeed,
 is probably the key to Lysenko's
 popularity with Khrushchev, who
 seems almost desperate for a
 quick improvement in the Soviet
 agricultural picture.
 Lysenko's scientific op-
 ponents have thus been faced
 with the difficult task of con-
 vincing Soviet political lead-
 ers who want to believe his
 views that his "scientific dis-
 coveries" are either misinter-
 pretations of evidence or in
 some cases deliberate falsifi-
 cation of results.   To replace
 his attractive promises, they

 themselves can offer only the
 delay of further research be-
 fore their own successes can
 be applied in agriculture.
 Moreover,  their proof that Ly-
 senko is wrong in his claims
 rests on scientific premises
 and techniques which look like
 hairsplitting to the nonspecial-
 ist.
 Influence Under Stalin
 To compensate, at least
 vis-a-vis political leaders,
 for his weak scientific back-
 ground,  Lysenko attributed his
 "successes" to the inspiration
 of Stalin and the socialist sys-
 tem, and charged scientists who
 questioned his claims with
 political treason.  In Stalin's
 later years, Lysenko achieved
 control of both agricultural
 policies and biological re-
 search.   Under his aegis, the
 campaign of the late 1940s to
 purify Soviet biology of "bour-
 geois-imperialist" opposition
 to his theories resulted in the
 closing of institutes, the re-
 writing of textbooks, and the
 arrest of scientists.   Stud
 books and pedigree records were
 abandoned; hybrid corn develop-
 ment was checked.
 The Soviet afforestation
 program was saddled with in-
 structions to plant seedlings
 in clusters, on the theory that
 competition would make each
 tree grow more lustily.   All
 the plantings suffered from
 crowding, and the program was
 later condemned as a failure.
 Basic biological research
 stagnated,  since Lysenko's views
 on the exchange of character-
 istics between the whole living
 organism and its environment
 left no scope for proper labo-
 ratory research.
 Even before Stalin's
 death, Lysenko's opponents, en-
 couraged by hints of a general
 political thaw, renewed their
 efforts to remove his grip from
 the biological sciences.   In
 the spring of 1955, the Academy
 of Sciences' Botanical Journal
 summed up the results of a
 re-examination of Lysenko's
 claims:   "It has now been con-
 clusively demonstrated that the
 entire concept is factually un-
 sound and theoretically and
 methodically erroneous, and that
 it is not of practical value...."
 Having noted that in at
 least one instance the investi-
 gators had found clear evidence
 of falsification of results in
 order to support Lysenko's
 claims, the journal complained
 that "T. D. Lysenko is resur.
 recting in our science...the
 naive transformist beliefs that
 were widespread in the biology
 of antiquity and the Middle
 Ages."  The journal referred
 bitterly to "the clearly theo-
 logical nature" of Lysenko's
 belief in the ability of plants
 to select for themselves good
 qualities deriving from their
 environments.
 In April 1956 Lysenko's
 critics finally achieved his
 resignation from his post as
 president of the Academy of
 Agricultural Sciences.  He re-
 tained the directorship of the
 Institute of Genetics--under the
 USSR Academy of Sciences--but a
 number of competent geneticists
 established fruitful research
 programs outside the jurisdic-
 tion of this institute.
 In July 1956, Matskevich,
 then minister of agriculture,
 complained publicly about the
 serious inadequacies in agri-
 cultural research.   In only
 thinly  veiled allusions to
 Lysenko, he attributed these
 shortcomings to the conceit of
 "certain scientific workers...
 based simply on ignorance,"
 and stated, "A number of
 scientists,  especially those
 who pride themselves on their
 remarkable discoveries which,
 at least in their   own  eyes,
 are causing a revolution in
 science, have properly studied
 neither the native nor   the
 foreign literature on the sub-
 ject under discussion, nor the
 practices of socialist agricul-
 ture."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Lysenko's recovery in po-
 litical prestige since 1956
 may not reach the heights he
 achieved under Stalin.   De-
 spite his success in 1959 in
 effecting the removal from
 their posts of a few individual
 opponents in biological theory,
 the main-.course of Soviet basic
 research in biological theory
 has not been deflected by Ly-
 senkoism, nor has it been sig-
 nificantly weakened by the
 regime's increased emphasis on
 applied science.
 There is some evidence
 that a deliberate effort is
 being made to restrict his in-
 fluence to agriculture. In his
 speech at the January plenum
 Lysenko attacked A. N. Nes-
 meyanov, president of the USSR
 Academy of Sciences, for a De--
 cember article in Pravda on the
 prospects for the  u ture of
 biological research. Referring
 to the "alleged" existence of
 genes, Lysenko declared: "This
 scientific doctrine, which does
 not correspond to reality, was
 long ago refuted by Michurinite
 biology and on the basis of ex-
 perimental facts in agricultural
 practices."  In December 1958,
 he had attacked Nesmeyanov for
 devotion tb'the cause of basic
 theoretical research as opposed
 to applied science.
 At the January plenum he
 sharpened this attack to complain
 that biophysics and biochemis-
 try,                 were lagging badly under
 the leadership of Nesmeyanov,
 who had cited these fields as
 the most promising for future
 research.
 In contrast to the atten-
 tion devoted to Lysenko's re-
 marks on agriculture, the So-
 viet central press all but ig-
 nored this patent attempt to re-
 gain control of biological re-
 search. Izvestia noted tersely
 that he "devoted a considerable
 part of his speech to questions
 on Michurinite biology and the
 formation of species"; Pravda
 failed to print even this much
 information. The TASS account,
 not carried in the central press,
 added Lysenko's dictum that the
 sole correct program for the re-
 construction of the work of all
 biological and agricultural
 scientific research organizations
 is that based on dialectical
 materialism--in the interpreta-
 tion of which he claims unique
 competence.   The full text of the
 speech appeared only in the
 specialized Rural Life, a journal
 published by the party central
 committee and devoted to agri-
 cultural affairs.
 Lysenko's tendency to prom-
 ise fast results, when combined
 with Khrushchev's impatience, may
 lead to the adoption of panaceas
 and a misuse of resources in
 agriculture.   Lysenko's special
 organic-chemical fertilizer mix-
 ture, while no less effective
 than other fertilizers, was con-
 demned in 1957 by the USSR Acad-
 emy of Agricultural Sciences as
 an unnecessarily complicated
 measure without scientific basis
 and entailing an uneconomic use
 of resources.
 Lysenko's influence on agri-
 cultural research could in the
 long run undercut Soviet agri-
 cultural progress through the
 substitution of his pet theories
 for more potentially fruitful
 lines of investigation.
 Lysenko is in a strong po-
 sition politically, since, as
 under Stalin, he has influence
 without responsibility. When the
 Soviet shelter-belt program was
 declared a failure, the first
 deputy minister of forestry was
 fired, not Lysenko, whose advice
 the former had been forced to
 follow. If the USSR has another
 poor harvest in the near future,
 the blame can again be placed on
 mistakes of planning and procure-
 ment officials and of farm chair-
 men, on speculation and theft, or
 on unfavorable weather. The more
 widely Lysenko's'theories are
 applied and publicly attributed
 to him, however,  the more vul-
 nerable he will become as a
 potential scapegoat for a future
 agricultural disaster.
