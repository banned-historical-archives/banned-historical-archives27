 China's View of Relations
 With the New US Administration                                 25X1
 Key Judgments          Beijing has tentatively concluded that Sino-US relations can continue to
 improve under the new US administration. At the same time, China remains
 concerned that Washington will take Beijing for.granted and will not respect
 Chinese sensitivities and interests regarding Taiwan. Ferment in Chinese
 domestic affairs has aggravated differences with the United States over
 Taiwan.
 Recent US actions have reassured Beijing about the stability of the relation-
 ship and its potential for further growth. This has taken place despite
 China's continued uneasiness over the prospect of US arms sales to Taiwan
 and persistent dissatisfaction with the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act.
 China has been particularly encouraged by US statements reaffirming the
 bases of normalization, by Ambassador Chai's meetings with the President
 and Secretary Haig, and by the visit to China of former President Ford and
 the scheduled visit by Secretary Haig.
 Beijing continues to insist that the basis for a firm and comprehensive Sino-
 US relationship is agreement on the need to oppose Soviet aggression. China
 looks to the United States to formulate its policies in light of this imperative
 and questions US constancy in opposing Soviet actions when Washington
 responds to other needs and pressures, particularly on the Taiwan question.
 Chinese leaders have made a point of assuring the United States that they
 will maintain a strongly anti-Soviet stance and have encouraged the United
 States to play a more active role in Indochina and South Asia-areas of
 major Chinese interest in opposing Soviet positions.
 Beijing still expects relations with the United States to expand in the
 security and economic as well as the diplomatic areas. Despite economic
 retrenchment in China, trade is flourishing, and Beijing continues to express
 an interest in obtaining US military equipment and technology. China's
 continued emphasis on the strategic underpinning of Sino-US ties indicates
 a desire to give an ever broader political basis to the relationship. While
 hoping to expand its connections with the United States, Beijing will
 continue to press the United States not to give an official character to its ties
 with Taiwan, and particularly not to sell new arms to Taipei.

 China's View of Relations
 With the New US Administration
 Beijing's Assessment
 Chinese assessments of the incoming US administra-
 tion at the end of last year indicated confidence that
 US policy toward China would not change substan-
 tially and a belief that the United States would be
 more steadfast in opposing Soviet expansionism. At the
 same time, Chinese public and private statements
 showed a deep concern that the United States might
 regard China as a negligible factor in international
 affairs and thus conclude that it could ignore Chinese
 interests. The Chinese were most sensitive to the pos-
 sibility that the United States might consider that its
 strong anti-Soviet stance would be sufficiently
 attractive to cause China to look the other way while
 Washington improved its ties with Taiwan. Beijing has
 thus been intent on warning that the Taiwan question
 cannot be isolated from the context of Sino-US rela-
 tions and that any such attempt was tantamount to a
 "two-Chinas" policy
 These fears led Beijing to speak forcefully and openly
 in the winter of 1980-81 on what it called the disas-
 trous consequences to bilateral relations if the United
 States moved to upgrade relations with Taiwan. Two
 concerns were uppermost in Chinese minds: that the
 new US administration would give an official char-
 acter to its relations with Taiwan and that it would
 quickly sell arms to Taiwan. After the election, Beijing
 increased its warnings about the unfavorable con-
 sequences of both of these steps. Confident that the
 new administration would want to preserve the strate-
 gic benefits it derived from the Sino-US relationship,
 the Chinese attempted to appeal to what they took to
 be the administration's recognition of its need for good
 relations with China]
 US visitors to Beijing during the transition period were
 told by Chinese leaders that efforts to upgrade rela-
 tions with Taiwan could be "dangerous" and could
 "worsen" US-Chinese relations. A Chinese newspaper
 warned that any change in the character of US rela-
 tions with Taiwan would "definitely lead to a ret-
 rogression" in Sino-US relations.
 The extent of Chinese sensitivities and concern over
 the new administration's policy toward Taiwan was
 demonstrated by the extraordinary attention devoted
 to the question of possible attendance by Taiwan of-
 ficials at President Reagan's inauguration. Vice For-
 eign Minister Zhang Wenjin told former Ambassador
 Woodcock on 17 January that the invitations were
 viewed as "a serious affair" in Beijing. Both the Chi-
 nese and the Beijing-controlled Hong Kong press
 waged a vigorous campaign on this issue in the days
 before the inauguration, imputing major significance
 to the subject until the issue was worked out to    25X1
 Beijing's satisfaction. More recently, Beijing has
 reacted with sharp public commentary to statements
 by US administration officials that it believes imply
 the existence of an official relationship between the
 United States and Taiwan
 Arms Sales to Taiwan                          25X1
 The major Chinese concern is with the nature and
 scope of future US arms sales to Taiwan. This concern
 imparted additional urgency to Beijing's efforts begin-
 ning in November to forestall a $500 million sale to
 Taiwan by the Netherlands that included two subma-
 rines to be built by the Dutch and nuclear power plant
 equipment. Beijing exerted progressively greater pres-
 sure on the Netherlands in an effort to block the sale of
 the submarines, moving from a "strong protest" to
 threats of political retaliation, economic sanctions, and
 the reduction of diplomatic relations to the charge 25X1
 level. When on 20 February the Dutch Government
 confirmed its decision to sell the submarines, the Chi-
 own envoy from The Hague
 nese requested that the Netherlands remove its
 Ambassador from Beijing and formally recalled their
 The Chinese reaction to the Dutch sale was clearly
 intended as a warning to the United States. As one
 Chinese official put it, "the whole point of our forceful
 protest to the Dutch" is to dissuade the United States

 Approved For Release 2008/07/29: CIA-RDP03T02547R000100180001-2
 from selling arms to Taiwan. From the outset, Chinese
 commentary linked Dutch willingness to proceed with
 the sale of the submarines to emergence of an "adverse
 current" in the West favoring a "two Chinas" or a
 "one China, one Taiwan" approach. Beijing appears
 convinced that this trend developed in part because
 pro-Taiwan forces had regained influence in the
 United States with the new administration.
 The Chinese assert and almost certainly believe that
 statements by members of the new US administration
 have fed Taiwan's intransigence, thus damaging pros-
 pects for peaceful reunification. A major theme during
 the visit to the United States in March of Ji Chaozhu,
 Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry's American
 and Oceanian Department, was Beijing's commitment
 to peaceful reunification with Taiwan; Beijing has
 repeatedly emphasized that US arms shipments to
 Taiwan impede this process by encouraging Taipei to
 reject overtures for a peaceful accommodation.
 Ji, whose statements had a self-serving element, ar;
 gued that the longer the United States desists from
 providing new weapons to Taipei, the more China will
 be able to demonstrate its peaceful intentions toward
 Taiwan. He has also asked that arms sales to Taiwan
 be delayed a year. These and other Chinese statements
 indicate Beijing realizes that the United States will
 make further arms sales to Taiwan, while implying
 that Chinese opposition to subsequent arms sales
 would be less damaging as Sino-US relations become
 further stabilized.
 Domestic Implications
 To reinforce Beijing's expressions of concern over the
 Taiwan question, several Chinese officials have
 pointed to potentially unfavorable consequences in
 Chinese domestic politics of any change in US policy
 toward Taiwan. This point, which was made by Han
 Xu during a visit to the United States in November
 and repeated by other Chinese to Americans, was
 intended to prompt the United States to reconsider
 steps that could undermine the position of Deng
 Xiaoping, the leader most directly associated with
 Sino-US normalization. Ji Chaozhu stated during his
 trip to the United States in March that his government
 was under great pressure from the Chinese people on
 this issue, and a functionary of the New China News
 Agency in Hong Kong remarked in mid-January that
 no Chinese leadership "could afford" to acquiesce in
 steps that made the Taiwan leaders less willing to
 accept peaceful reunification.
 These statements result from a concern in Beijing that
 US policy toward Taiwan could undermine the basis
 for normalization by failing both to respect Chinese
 nationalistic sensitivities and to subordinate policy dif-
 ferences to the strategic imperative of joint opposition
 to the Soviets. While probably not in itself fatal to
 Deng, a shift in US policy toward Taiwan could add to
 Deng's accumulated problems at a time when his poli-
 cies have been under pressure across a broad front.
 Any US moves to give an official character to relations
 or to undertake a major arms sales to Taiwan would
 leave Deng vulnerable to the charge that he personally
 miscalculated during the normalization negotiations or
 that this policy could not survive a change in US
 administration. Deng appears to have made adjust-
 ments to cope with criticism in the past, and he would
 certainly attempt to make corresponding adjustments
 to Sino-US relations in the event of improvements in
 US relations with Taiwan.
 25X1
 Meeting the Soviet Threat
 The question of US relations with Taiwan is important
 to China both intrinsically and as an indication of US
 willingness to subordinate these relations to the strate-
 gic interests underlying the Sino-US relationship. For
 example, Beijing drew confidence from the US re-         25X1
 sponse to the invasion of Afghanistan, but it claims to
 remain skeptical of US reliability in jointly facing
 Moscow as long as Washington is willing to endanger
 its relations with Beijing by continuing to weigh closer
 ties to Taiwan. Beijing has repeatedly urged the
 United States to show determination in opposing Mos-
 cow and has voiced some puzzlement and concern over
 the implications of the removal of the partial grain
 embargo on the USSR. Implicit in China's position is
 the concern that similar political pressures might result
 in shifts in US policy on Taiwan.

 Secret
 This case was stated most baldly by a Chinese news-
 paper in late January when it asked, "In opposing
 Soviet hegemonism and expansionism and upholding
 world peace today, is it possible to go without China?"
 Similarly, Foreign Minister Huang Hua told Ambas-
 sador Woodcock during his farewell call on 11 Feb-
 ruary that the benefits of the Sino-US relationship
 should be "viewed in the context of the overall world
 situation"-a Chinese euphemism for Soviet aggres-
 siveness.
 In conveying this message the Chinese have also of-
 fered support for a number of US initiatives and have
 encouraged Washington to continue to take a firm line
 with the USSR. Chinese propaganda has reported
 favorably on projected increases in US defense spend-
 ing and on more assertive moves by the United States
 to counter the USSR and its proxies in various regions.
 Beijing has advised the United States to delay respond-
 ing to Brezhnev's suggestion for a summit, and Chi-
 nese propaganda has sought to induce the West Eu-
 ropeans to work out differences with the United States
 on the enhanced radiation warhead, urging them to
 "see through the designs" of the USSR in opposing
 deployment of this weapon. Beijing also welcomed the
 visit of Japanese Premier Suzuki to the United States
 and the meeting of the NATO Foreign Ministers as
 evidence of greater Western cohesion in the face of the
 Soviet threat.
 Beijing has sought in a number of ways to demonstrate
 the firmness and constancy of its opposition to the
 Soviet Union in order to encourage the United States
 and the other Western powers to maintain a strong
 anti-Soviet stance. Huang Hua, for instance, assured
 Ambassador Woodcock that China will not play the
 "Soviet card," and Ambassador Chai told Under Sec-
 retary Stoessel in late March that China had rebuffed
 a Soviet offer to open negotiations. Similarly, China
 has dismissed as "plain hypocrisy" Brezhnev's pro-
 posal to the recent Soviet party congress to discuss
 confidence-building measures in the Far East.
 Policy in South and Southeast Asia
 China has been particularly active in promoting US
 support for a coalition of resistance forces in
 Kampuchea. Realizing that Pol Pot's unsavory reputa-
 tion is a political liability and fearing that international
 acceptance of Pol Pot's Democratic Kampuchea is
 weakening, Beijing has become more active since last
 December in working behind the scenes to widen the
 anti-Vietnamese political base in Kampuchea through
 the establishment of a coalition that includes non-
 Communist forces as well as Prince Sihanouk. In mid-
 February the Chinese Foreign Ministry formally 25X1
 called for US support for a united front and for in-
 creased economic and military aid to Kampuchean
 forces opposing Vietnam. This approach has been reit-
 erated by high-ranking Chinese diplomats and, most
 recently, by Huang Hua to former President Ford
 during his visit in late March.                   25X1
 Beijing has made similar approaches to Australia, the
 ASEAN ' countries, and Japan, wishing to ease the
 diplomatic problems created for it by its close associ-
 ation with Democratic Kampuchea. China probably
 assumes that an active US role, moreover, would make
 the united front a more viable and attractive force,
 would complicate the situation for Vietnam (and its
 Soviet patron), would ease ASEAN's concern over
 Chinese intentions in Southeast Asia, and would ease
 Beijing's problems of enlisting greater ASEAN and
 Australian support for opposition to Vietnam in    25X1
 Kampuchea. Beijing recently has urged the United
 States to maintain an unyielding, long-term effort to
 roll back the Vietnamese gains in Indochina and not
 be diverted from this effort by crises in other areas.
 25X1
 The Chinese have coupled the issues of Afghanistan
 and Kampuchea to stress the importance of a firm
 stance against aggression. In this connection, Beijing
 has been attempting to induce the United States to
 expand its aid to Pakistan, particularly since the inva-
 sion of Afghanistan. In recent months Huang Hua has
 told the Australian Foreign Minister that Western aid
 to Pakistan is "far from enough," and Ji Chaozhu
 stated during his US visit that it is "necessary to do
 more to help the Pakistanis," a point made again by
 Huang Hua to former President Ford. At the same 25X1
 ' ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, consists of
 Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. F

 time, however, it is unclear what, if anything, Beijing
 will be willing to do to facilitate cooperation between
 the United States and Pakistan. Up to now, the Chi-
 nese have explained their reluctance to be involved by
 maintaining that the security aspects of Sino-Pakistani
 relations are a strictly bilateral matter.
 Beijing's Concerns
 Although pleased with the evolution of US policy,
 Beijing continues to be concerned that the United
 States will view Sino-US relations as a "card" to be
 played against Moscow. This concern has been clear in
 statements such as that attributed to Deng in January
 that the United States must recognize that relations
 with China are in its vital interests. This statement has
 been repeated by other Chinese, who emphasize that a
 stable, long-term relationship can develop only on the
 basis of an acknowledgment by the United States of its
 F16/79 or the F5G versions of the aircraft. In answer
 to a question on how China would react, a senior
 Foreign Ministry official said in late February:
 "Watch how we handle the Dutch." Beijing probably
 hopes to deter the United States from selling the FX to
 Taiwan by such ambiguity, which suggests but does
 not directly threaten serious consequences to relations.
 The Chinese desire that US arms sales to Taiwan be
 postponed is based on the hope that the domestic
 situation in China will be stabilized soon and that Sino-
 US relations will broaden substantially. Although
 Beijing would react strongly to the provision of any
 advanced weapons to Taiwan, its reaction would be less
 damaging to Sino-US relations if these relations had in
 the meantime progressed significantly beyond their
 current status
 need for close ties with Beijing.
 In recent months Beijing has repeatedly condemned
 the Taiwan Relations Act, underscoring its continuing
 concern that the United States will attempt to use this
 legislation to give an official character to its contacts
 with Taipei. During the visit to Beijing of former
 President Ford in late March, Huang Hua identified
 Taiwan as the "biggest obstacle" to improved Sino-US
 relations and reiterated China's contention that the
 Taiwan Relations Act is incompatible with the joint
 communique of December 1978 establishing relations
 between the United States and China. The Chinese
 press continues to argue this line frequently, and re-
 cently characterized the Act as an "obstacle" to im-
 proved Sino-US relations-a step short of demanding
 that the administration rescind the legislation. China is
 determined to continue to register its disapproval of
 US administration statements affirming adherence to
 the Taiwan Relations Act. Beijing also will continue to
 press the United States not to use this legislation to
 expand its contacts with Taiwan.
 One of Beijing's major preoccupations over the next
 few months will continue to be with the question of US
 arms sales to Taiwan; the possible sale of the FX
 aircraft will be a particularly sensitive issue. While
 showing great concern on this question, China has not
 indicated how it would respond to the sale of either the
 Emerging Outlines
 While working to assure itself that the United States
 will continue to pursue a policy consistent with the
 terms of the communique announcing the establish-
 ment of relations, Beijing is also attempting to give
 greater substance to bilateral relations. Huang Hua
 told Ambassador Woodcock during the US envoy's
 farewell call that it will be important throughout the
 1980s to deepen understanding and "to intensify mu-
 tual consultations" between China and the United
 States. This message was spelled out in detail by Ji
 Chaozhu during his visit to the United States in
 March, when he stressed the need for high-level con-
 sultations, stated that there is more room for progress
 in relations, and said that China hoped that profes-
 sional military exchanges with the United States will
 continue
 Chinese invitations to President Reagan, Secretary
 Haig, and Under Secretary Stoessel are intended to
 serve this purpose by engaging the United States in
 consultations on major bilateral issues. Beijing hopes
 to make a firm connection in the minds of US leaders
 between the necessity for joint opposition to Soviet
 activities and the need for Washington to respect Chi-
 nese views on the Taiwan question. Beijing will use the

 high-level consultations it hopes to conduct in coming
 months to delay and reduce as much as possible new
 US moves toward Taiwan, particularly in the area of
 arms sales.
 Recent Chinese statements, moreover, suggest that
 Beijing may directly and explicitly attempt to tie fu-
 ture development of relations to US action on Taiwan.
 China almost certainly will not attempt to give the
 relationship with the United States a more formal
 character but will seek to deepen US commitments
 both within the bilateral framework and in support of
 Chinese positions in those areas, notably Indochina
 and South Asia, where the Soviet threat is most di-
 rectly felt. It will also work to establish closer economic
 and security ties as part of its effort to give greater
 substance to the overall political relationhip and to give
 the United States greater incentive not to expand its
 contacts with Taiwan.
