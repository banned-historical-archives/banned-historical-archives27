 May 20, 1969             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD- HOUSE
 SECOND  SUPPLEMEkTAL  APPRO-
 PRIATION BILL, 1969
 Mr. MA_ OISpeaker, I move that
 .the House resolve itself into the Com-
 mittee of the Whole House on the State
 of the 'Union for the consideration of the
 bill (H.R. 11400) making supplemental
 appropriations for the fiscal year ending
 June 30, 1969, and for other purposes;
 and pending that motion, Mr. Speaker,
 I ask unanimous consent that general
 debate thereon be limited to not to ex-
 ceed 3 hours, the time to be equally divid-
 ed and controlled by the gentleman from
 North Carolina (Mr. JONAS) and, myself.
 The SPEAKER.. Is there objection to
 the request of the gentleman from
 Texas?
 There was no objection.
 The SPEAKER. The question is on the
 motion offered by the genleman from
 Texas.
 The motion was agreed to.
 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE
 Accordingly the House resolved itself
 into the Committee of the Whole House
 on the State of the Union for the con-
 sideration of the bill 1i.R. 11400, with
 Mr. HOLIFIELD in' the chair.
 The Clerk read the title of the bill.
 By unanimous consent, the first read-
 ing of the bill was dispensed with.
 The CHAIRMAN. Under the unani-
 mous-consent agreement, the gentleman
 from Texas (Mr, MAHOIc) will be recog-
 nized for 11/2 hours, and the gentleman
 from North Carolina (Mr. JONAS) will be
 recognized for  11/2  hours.
 The Chair recognizes the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself 10 minutes.
 Mr. Chairman, we come to the con-
 sideration of the second supplemental
 appropriation bill for 1969, the first ma-
 jor appropriation bill for the 91st Con-
 gress. It deals with the : fiscal year 1969
 insofar as the funds are concerned.. And
 It contains an important provision-an
 expenditure ceiling-with respect to fis-
 cal year 1970.
 I hope the items in the bill will be ex-
 plored by the Members and that the
 House will work its will. on this, bill. In
 the Committee on Appropriations, we
 think we have done the best we could,
 Out we make no claim of infallibility. We
 have cut the requests by some $581 mil-
 lion. If there are further reductions
 which are desired, Members of course,
 are free to offer the amendments to
 bring about the reductions.
 SUMMARY OF THE PENDING BILL
 We have reduced the budget estimates
 which were before us by about 13 per-
 cent. Most of . the items, and the bulk of
 the total requests before the committee
 were of a mandatory character and we
 had no practical option to recommend-
 ing approval of the necessary funds. We
 had to provide funds, for example, for
 pay increases which had been provided
 in previous legislation.
 It is an old refrain that Congress in
 11 the regular appropriation bills reduces
 the annual iijoney measures and then
 early in the next session, restores the re-
 ductions which were made, and that
 therefore the ; reductions originally made
 result in no reductions at all. This is not
 correct. For example, in this bill less
 than 1 percent of the new funds pro-
 vided represent:,. a restoration of funds
 which were reduced last year. And the
 restorations--some ..S34 million-repre-
 sent about one--third of 1 percent of the
 approximately :512 billion cut last year in
 new funds requested for fiscal 1969.
 That, I think. is a rather good record.
 There are many, many items in the
 bill before us. and there is no way to be
 fully familiar with the contents of the
 bill other than to study the bill and the
 report, so I would commend to all a
 careful reading of the report on the bill.
 There are innumerable items represent-
 ing, I believe, practically every depart-
 ment and agency of the Government.
 The bill proposes new appropriations,
 or budget authority, in the sum of about
 $3,783,000,000. It is, as I said, about $581
 million less than the budget requests, a
 cut of about 1; percent.
 Mr. Chairman, under leave to extend,
 I include, for purposes of elaboration,
 excerpts from  ,he report summarizing
 the main features of the bill:
 SUMM.'LY  OF  THE BILL
 The bill is divided into five titles: I-Mili-
 tary operations ir=. Southeast Asia, II-Gen-
 eral supplementals (various), III-Increased
 pay costs, IV--Cooling on 1970 expenditures,
 and V-General provisions.
 The grand total of new budget (obliga-
 tional)  authority recommended in the bill
 Is $3,783,212,768, ;1 reduction of about 13%,
 or $580,794,190, from the revised budget re-
 quests of $4,364,006,956 considered.
 In addition, under title II there are pro-
 posed increases of $82,500,000 in limitations
 on annual contract authorizations involving
 interest subsidies for homeownership and
 rental housing assistance and college hous-
 ing. 'The budget requests for these total $104,-
 500,000, so there is a reduction of $22,000,000.
 Also, numerous provisions in the bill would
 release $82,766,000 held in reserve under the
 cutback provisions of Public Law 90-364.
 The amounts in the bill are within the
 overall totals of budget authority for 1969
 shown in the administration's budget review
 released April 15th. That Is, they are well
 within the totals contemplated in that re-
 view. And they are also well below the sup-
 plemental provisions contemplated for fiscal
 1969 in the budget last January.
 The January i'ndget projected fiscal 1989
 budget authority supplementals of $4,813,-
 000,000, inclusive of $198,000,000 dependent
 on legislation which Is not yet enacted. Of
 the remainder ($4,615,000,000), a total of $4,-
 365,000,000 in new budget authority was sub-
 mitted to the House and considered in con-
 nection with the accompanying bill. An ad-
 ditional $221,000.000 in new budget author-
 ity requests for 1969-finalized after House
 Committee hearings were closed out-was
 submitted to the,, Senate (S. Doe. 91-18) for
 consideration in conn?ction with this bill.
 Thus the total of such budget authority re-
 quests now indicated L. $4,586,000,000, or, in
 round figures, $29,000,000 below the $4,615,-
 000,000 mentioned above.
 This is the way the total picture stands
 on 1969 supplementals as of this date. It is
 a net result;  the new administration re-
 viewed                                                                         and  revised many of the supple-
 mental requests submitted by the previous
 administration and m.4de a number of re-
 ductions. But as the totals now stand, in-
 creases submitted have offset all but $29,000,-
 000 of the decreases from the January budget
 that were projected on April 15 (again, not
 counting the $308,000,000 that hinges on
 legislation),
 H 3829
 Summary by titles
 Title I, Defense'rnilitary, includes $1,234,-
 000,000 for military operations in Southeast
 Asia. This compares with the revised request
 of $1,496,900,000, a reduction of $262,900,-
 000, or about 17 percent.
 Title II, for sundry general supplementals,
 includes   $1,365,914,312,   a   reduction   of
 $39,736,850,  or  just  under    3%   from  the
 budget  requests    of  $1,405,651,162  in  new
 budget  (obligational)  authority. Some re-
 leases of reserves and other non-add pro-
 visions are involved. Increases of $82,500,-
 000-a reduction of $22,000,000 from the re-
 quest-are also proposed in limitations on
 annual  contract  authorizations in  certain
 interest subsidy programs in the housing
 field.
 The details are set forth under the various
 chapters in the committee report, but the
 great bulk of title II relates to items not
 subject to effective discretionary control In
 the annual bills. Some 83% or $1,132,000,000,
 of the total, for example, is involved in grants
 to  states  for  public  assistance;  veterans
 compensation, medical, and other costs; un-
 employment compensation payments; mili-
 tary retired pay; and disaster relief.
 Title III, for increased pay costs, includes
 $1,183,298,454 in new budget (obligational)
 authority, an overall reduction of $278,157,-
 340, or about 19 percent from the revised
 budget requests of $1,461,455,794. Release of
 $62,277,000 of P.L. 90-364 reserves is also
 involved, plus numerous transfers between
 appropriations to enable greater absorption
 of pay costs.
 These supplementals relate to unabsorbed
 portions of pay raises generally effective last
 July 1 that were not taken into account in
 the regular 1969 appropriations.
 The Executive Branch had combed the es-
 timates initially and the new administra-
 tion had also reexamined them. Since the
 estimates are for mandatory-type costs that
 have been running all fiscal year, the Com-
 mittee could not make drastic additional
 cuts all across the boards this late in the
 fiscal year without creating unacceptable dis-
 ruption to operations.
 Title IV, limitation on 1970 budget out-
 lays, proposes an overall ceiling on expendi-
 tures of the government during the fiscal
 .year 1970 that begins on July 1, 1969. The
 proposal is explained 4fl considerable detail
 beginning on page 118 of the report of the
 committee on the bill.
 Title V, general provisions, contains gen-
 eral provisions customarily carried.
 Approximate effect on 1969 expenditures-
 budget outlays
 It is the committee's tentative estimate
 that the reduction of $580,794,190 in new
 budget (obligational)  authority  requests,
 plus the relatively minor changes in re-
 quested  transfers  between  appropriations,
 and reserve releases, will translate into a re-
 duction  of   approximately  $464,000,000                                                                                                                                        in
 budget outlays previously projected for fiscal
 year 1969, by titles of the bill roughly as fol-
 lows: title I, $165,000,000; title II, $26,000,-
 000; and title III, $273,000,000. The reduc-
 tions in the interest subsidy contract au-
 thorizations limitations Would not affect pro-
 jected 1969 outlays.
 The outlay effect of the remainder of the
 reduction in new budget authority and in-
 terest subsidy contract authorization limi-
 tations would be of some consideration in
 determining the impact of congressional ac-
 tions on fiscal 1970 budget outlays; perhaps
 to a minor extent, even on fiscal 1971 out-
 lays.
 I believe there will be a desire on the
 part of the House to discuss some of the
 military implications involved, and the
 war in Southeast Asia. Some may want
 to discuss the antiballistic missile pro-
 gram and other controversial or semi-

 controverilal matters. We have agreed on
 the 3 hours In which to discuss these
 matters.
 ZSPENDITDU C$aPO PE}POSa1,--3'ms lv
 Mr. Chairman, I should like to claim
 your attention, if I may, at this time for
 the purpose of discussing a portion ofthe
 bill whici. appears on page 61. The re-
 port deals adequately with this proposal.
 It proposes an expenditure limitation-a
 spending ,eiling. I believe it Is important
 that all Members be familiar with the
 expenditure ceiling.
 I should like to read the ceiling which
 we propose to fix in this bill. Page 61 of
 the bill, title IV:
 Expenditures and net lending (budget out-
 lays) of the Federal Government during the
 fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, shall not
 exceed  $192,B0o,000,000:   Provided,  That
 whenever xtlon. or inaction, by the Con-
 gress on -equests for appropriations and
 other budgetary proposals varies from the
 President's recommendations' thereon, the
 Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall
 report to the President and to the Congress
 his estimate of the effect of such action or
 inaction orL expendiures and net lending, and
 the limitation set forth herein shall be cor-
 respondingly adjusted.
 Mr. Chairman, that is the ceiling pro-
 vision, subsection (a) of It.
 Subsection (b) is the reporting pro-
 vision, which I insert here for reference
 purposes:.
 (b) The Director of the Bureau of the
 Budget shall report periodically to the Presi-
 dent and  .o the Congress on the operation
 of this sec-ion. The first such report shall be
 made at the end of the first month which be-
 gins after the date of approval of this Act;
 aubsequen: reports shall be made at the end
 of each calendar month during the first ses-
 sion of the Ninety-first Congress. and at the
 end of each calendar quarter thereafter.
 Mr. Chairman, under leave to extend,
 and before porceeding further, let me in-
 sert an excerpt from the report which
 briefly str.tes the nature of the proposi-
 tion:
 The committee has included a provision In
 the bill that would place an overall ceiling
 on budget expenditures during the fiscal year
 1970 that begins on July 1, 1969. The pre-
 cise terini:iology is "Expenditures and net
 lending"-which, taken togethter, constitute
 "budget outlays".
 The amount specifically stated In the pro-
 vision, $192,900,000,000, is a beginning figure,
 not an ending figure. It is the revised pro-
 jection of 1970 budget outlays announced by
 the President on April 12 and summarized in
 the Review of the 1970 Budget released on
 April 15. That summary appears in the Con-
 gressional Record of April 16, 1969, at pages
 E2993-299t:.
 Coupled to the $192.9 billion figure is lan-
 guage providing-"' * ' That whenever ac-
 tion, or inaction, by the Congress on requests
 for appropriations and other budgetary pro-
 posals varies from the President's recommen-
 dations thereon, the Director of the Bureau
 of the Budget shall report to the President
 and to the Congress his estimate of the effect
 of such action or inaction on expenditures
 and net le;Iding, and the limitation set forth
 herein shall be correspondingly adjusted."
 In other words. Congress would work from
 the President's proposed total spending esti-
 mate. It would do so through its actions, or
 Its inactions, on requests for appropriations
 and other budget obligational authority and
 outlay prods in the various appropriation
 bills and certain other 'bills affecting the
 budget,
 The language would operate continuously
 to adjust the ceiling, as appropriate, to com-
 port with the estimated expenditure effect of
 specific congressional actions or inactions
 having budgetary impact.
 It is a flexible provision-but in terms oC
 aggregate spending, flexible only on the ac-
 tien of the Congress. not the Executive.
 It does not seek to declare something of
 the end from the beginning; It sets a begin-
 ning point against which Congress would
 work in deciding, through its various spend-
 ing actions, what the ultimate total should
 be, and supplies a mechanism for resetting
 the ceiling accordingly.
 Unlike last year's calling provision, it does
 not Impose an arbitrary broad-axe type ceil-
 ing cutback that would leave to the Execu-
 tive the allocation of any congressional ex-
 penditure reduction to specific agencies and
 programs.
 It would be the first ceiling ever to place
 directly in the hands of Congress the specific
 decision as to the maximum amount to be
 taken out of the Treasury for payment of
 the Government's bills in a given 12-month
 period,
 Mr. Chairman, we are at a moment
 when for the first time in the history of
 this Republic, Members of Congress are
 being called upon to vote on an expendi-
 ture ceiling which covers the entire Fed-
 eral Government. This kind of legislation
 has never been passed by the Congress
 during the history of the country.
 This Is an expenditure limitation which
 is all inclusive. It includes the Veterans'
 Administration. It Includes the Defense
 Department. It includes the war In Viet-
 nam. It includes interest on the national
 debt. It Includes all expenditures. Noth-
 ing is exempt.
 POTEN'rLAL SEDUCTION t3'FECT AND COMPARISON
 TO LAST TEAR'S CEIIiNe
 We have an expenditure limitation for
 fiscal year 1969 and we had an expendi-
 ture limitation of sorts in the prior year.
 But in the fiscal 1969 version we have a
 series of exceptions and exemptions. In-
 deed we exempted about $99 billion of
 fiscal 1969 currently estimated expend-
 itures.
 The Congress reduced expenditures by
 about $6 billion in the fiscal year ending
 on June 30. However, we did not reduce
 net expenditures of the Government sig-
 nificantly due to increases in exempted
 areas. In those areas where we had made
 exemptions, expenditure increases totaled
 approximately $6 billion. That offsetting
 Increase left a relatively slight net re-
 duction In the January 1968 budget esti-
 mate of expenditures for fiscal 1969. On
 the other hand, except for our action last
 year, expenditures would no doubt have
 increased by several billions.
 Mr. Chairman, at this point I include
 additional excerpts from the committee
 report comprising title IV of the pending
 bill with last year's ceiling and drawing
 attention to the reduction potential of
 the ceiling now proposed.
 It is a rigid ceiling; it cannot be exceeded
 except upon-action by the Congress. And as
 indicated above, the ceiling would decrease
 if congressional actions on the budget so
 provide.
 It lays the basis for potentially very sig-
 nificant  retrenchment  in  expenditures. If
 such a ceiling had been adopted-and strictly
 adhered to-over the last many years, billions
 of expenditures would have been avoided.
 More specifically, taking all 14 budgets for
 the post-Korea fiscal years 1956 through 1966.
 the projected expenditure totals In the origi-
 nal annual budgets were cumulatively ex-
 ceeded by about $50 billion.-in 11 of the 14
 years, the overruns aggregated $53.3 billion.
 In 3 years. there were underruns aggregating
 $3.5 billion. But overall for the 14 years, the
 government actually expended-for a variety
 of reasons--about $50 billion more than the
 sum total of what was projected in the origl-
 nal budgets. That averages to about $3.4 bil-
 lion a year. So the potential is great, if the
 ceiling is adopted and adhered to.
 Unlike the expenditure ceiling provisions
 enacted in the last session applicable to fiscal
 1969, nothing would be exempt from the ceil-
 ing, Last year's ceiling provisions had a very
 significant Impact on government spending
 In fiscal 1969. They significantly restrained
 the growth of spending that undoubtedly
 would have otherwise occurred. And on the
 latest figures. it seems beyond reasonable de-
 bate that In the absence of the ceiling pro-
 visions, a much needed budget surplus for
 1969 would not now be in prospect. Buteven
 with the ceiling and the $6 billion cutback
 Congress did not, by its actions, diminish the
 originally projected budget expenditure (out-
 lay) total of $186.1 billion.
 It did prevent that total from being ex-
 ceeded.                                                                                                         And  It -did  restrain  growth  of
 spending.
 More   specifically, Congress exempted
 50%-$92.6  billion-of  the  $186.1 billion
 from the $6 billion cutback, and expressly
 permitted overruns to the extent determined
 necessary in the exempted programs. Those
 overruns were reestimated in the April 15
 budget review at $6.1 billion. The overruns
 in exempted areas wiped out the $6 billion
 cutback in non-exempt areas.
 In its specific actions on the individual
 appropriation and other spending bills, Con-
 gress last year contributed roughly $3.7 to
 $3.9 billion (depending on variable calcula-
 tions) to the $6 billion overall cutback, leav-
 ing the remainder to be allocated by the
 Executive. The April 15 Review reflects a total
 cutback of $7.3 billion from the original es-
 timates for non-exempted areas, Offsetting
 this gross cutback are the $6.1 billion over-
 runs in exempted areas leaving a net esti-
 mated cutback, as of April 15 of $12 billion
 from the originally projected total.
 Thus the latest estimate of spending for
 1969 is $184.9 billion, $1.2 billion less than
 the $186.1 billion projected In the original
 1969 budget. But it should be noted that
 about $1.5 billion of the $7.3 billion reduc-
 tion now shown In non-exempted areas is
 not a cut in the more conventional sense,
 but rather financing adjustments because
 the Banks for Cooperatives, the Federal In-
 termediate Credit Banks, and the Federal
 National  Mort sage  Association  secondary
 market operations, which were in the original
 $186.1 billion budget total, subsequently be-
 came                                                                                                         100', ,  privately         owned  and  thus
 dropped from the Federal totals.
 Of course, the $7.3 billion reduction figure
 Is a composite of the specific congressional
 actions, the financing adjustments, actual
 curtailments of outlays, and administrative
 reestimates  of expenditures-both  up and
 down-in many items as conditions changed.
 There are signs that further reestimates up-
 ward in certain programs will substantially
 diminish the $7.3 billion figure and thus in
 turn the $1.2 billion figure.
 The ceiling proposed In this bill would af-
 ford  opportunity for  maximum flexibility
 within the overall total to meet, as fully as
 reasonably possible, changed and changing
 expenditure requirements In certain specific
 programs that cannot be foreseen with great
 precision. The new administration has vari-
 ously indicated that it intends to seek, on a
 continuing basis, economies in operations
 and to look for lower-priority areas when it
 needs room for increases within its stated
 policy of strict fiscal restraint. An aggregate
 ceiling would be facilitating in this regard-

 Of course, the President can seek supple-
 mental relief to meet necessary but unfore-
 seen and unavoidable outlay Increases which
 he finds cannot be accommodated within the
 overall total.
 Setting a beginning ceiling in this fashion
 should in no way discourage the Executive
 Branch from its continuing commitment-
 and responsibility-for seeking to conduct
 the day-to-day management of government
 programs at the very minimum cost con-
 sistent 'with the public necessities, refrain-
 ing from spending every  dollar that can
 reasonably be saved. Constructive economy in
 public spending is not only a matter of leg-
 islative decision. It is also a matter of ad-
 ministration.  The new administration has
 attached high priority to quality of per-
 formance in administering the government.
 Wasteful and needless expenditures often
 do not become to until funds are poorly
 managed. The primary burden of getting a
 dollar's value for every dollar justifiably ap-
 propriated to the purposes of government lies
 mainly with those who administer, not with
 those who legislate.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman has expired.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself such time as I may require.
 Now, there was a good basis last year
 for exempting agencies, but let me say
 to you that there is, in my judgment,
 based on presently available informa-
 tion, no good basis for exempting agen-
 cies this year. Last year, we were cutting
 the estimate of expenditures by $6 bil-
 lion and therefore we did feel some ex-
 emptions were desired and these exemp-
 tions Were proposed. Then, of course,
 there were additional exemptions which
 were provided' later. Last year, we pro-
 posed a cut in the estimate of expendi-
 tures, but in title IV of the pending bill,
 we are not proposing any cut in the esti-
 mate of expenditures. So it makes no
 sense to exempt the Veterans' Adminis-
 tration, or the interest on the national
 debt, or any other item. It makes no
 sense to exempt anything in this bill, be-
 cause we are proposing an expenditure
 limitation or ceiling at the exact and
 precise limitations which have been esti-
 mated in the revised budget of the ad-
 ministration.
 The budget this year ought to be more
 accurate in many respects that it was in
 many previous years, because ordinarily
 a budget is put into shape to a very con-
 siderable extent in the fall of the year
 preceding the year for which it begins,
 that is, the following January 1. How-
 ever, we are now operating on an ex-
 penditure budget which was refined, re-
 designed, and reexamined since Janu-
 ary 20. It is more up to date and should
 be more trustworthy. The revised budget
 of the administration on which this pro-
 vision is based was submitted only a
 month ago.
 So I hope we will not at this time yield
 to the temptation of trying :to make any
 exemptions whatever.
 THE ARITHMETIC AND MECHANICS OF THE
 PhOPOSED CEILING
 Mr. Chairman, let me hasten to add-
 and I realize this is a dull subject, but
 It is very important and will become in-
 ereasingly more important-let me add
 that we will change this ceiling if we
 appropriate more money than was esti-
 mated for appropriation in the budget.
 In other words, if we increase appro-

 would be translated inE o an expenditure     In the area of proposed legislation for
 reduction amount not of $12 billion but
 into the amount that would be spent in
 the forthcoming year fiscal 1970. That
 might be half that stun or one-third of
 that sum or some other percentage.
 This ceiling is mandatory; It is inflex-
 ible; it is the law of the land from which
 the executive branch cannot escape. The
 executive branch will of course have the
 authority to make adjustments within
 various programs ane within those pro-
 grams accommodate to better manage-
 ment and so forth. The administration
 can come to Congress and say, "Our esti-
 mates which we made as to spending last
 April have proved. to be faulty and we
 would ask you to make certain adjust-
 ments to the ceiling." This would then
 be a matter for Congress to decide upon.
 So, if we increase appropriations for
 various programs, then the budget ceiling
 will go beyond $192.9 billion by whatever
 figure might be mandated by the increase.
 Mr. Chairman, so that the RECORD Will
 reflect more preciseiy how the ceiling
 would work, I include additional explora-
 tory excerpts from the committee report:
 THE  ARITHMETIC  AND   MECHANICS  OF  THE
 C'.EIL I NG
 The ceiling begins by legitilating a net re-
 duction of $2,372,000,Oe10 in budget outlays
 projected for 1970 in the original (January)
 budget-from  $1953  billion. down to  the
 $192.9 billion April 16 revised projection of
 the present admin.istr:ation. But the gross
 ceiling reduction is $4.020,000,000; this was
 offset by $1.6 billion in the recent budget
 review by upward "c.orreetions" in several
 specific projections in me original budget.
 The $4 billion cutback in outlays includes
 $1.1 billion in defense. $1 billion for a modi-
 fication of the previously proposed $1.6 bil-
 lion increase in social security benefits, and
 $1.9 billion for prognuns ;,Stetting almost
 every Federal agency-
 In the April 15 review in which the $4 bil-
 lion cutback in outlays was projected the
 administration also proposed gross cutbacks
 of $5.5 billion  ($4.2 bi)jion, net after the
 "correcting" adjustments of $1.3 billion) in
 appropriation and other budget obligational
 authority requests. $3 billion of this is in
 defense and $2.5 billion in all other areas
 of the budget. Budget bbligational author-
 ity (appropriations, er:,entially) is the tradi-
 tional basis on which appropriation and au-
 thorization bills are stated and voted on re-
 gardless of the year or years in which the
 funds are to be actually disbursed in the
 form of budget outlay:..
 The gross total for new budget authority
 for 1970 in the January budget is $210.1 bil-
 lion, and in the April 15 revision, $206.9 bil-
 lion-including so-called permanent budget
 authority, such as interest, trust funds, etc.,
 which does not actually appear in the annual
 bills.
 The Committee on Appropriations and sev-
 eral other committees have before them for
 consideration these revised appropriation re-
 quests and Other budgetary recommenda-
 tions for fiscal 1970. What Congress does in
 the bills dealing with there various budget
 authority proposals plus a handful of other
 proposals involving outlays but not budget
 authority basically determines what hap-
 pens to the $192.9 billion beginning ceiling
 in the accompanying bill.
 which the outlay budget includes specific
 sums, several have the effect of holding the
 outlay total lower than it otherwise would
 be. Several, of course, involve additional out-
 lays. For example, if Congress does not en-
 act the proposed postal rate increase, the
 outlay ceiling, according to the latest esti-
 mate available, would be adjusted upward
 by some $600 million. This is because postal
 revenues are counted as offsets to expendi-
 tures, not as budget receipts.
 If the budget proposal to authorize the
 Farmers Home Administration to make In-
 sured rather than direct operating loans is
 not enacted, the outlay ceiling, according to
 the budget, would be adjusted upward by
 $292 million.
 If the budget proposal for legislation to
 restrict public assistance medical. aid for
 patients in mental institutions to 120 days
 is not enacted, the outlay ceiling, accord-
 ing to the budget, would be adjusted upward
 by $126 million.
 Several legislative proposals designed to
 diminish budget outlays by the Veterans Ad-
 ministration are priced in the outlay total to
 save some $288 million in 1970. Failure of
 those, according to the budget figures, would
 be the basis for an equivalent upward adjust-
 ment in the ceiling.
 These four examples aggregate $1.3 billion.
 On the other hand, again for example, if the
 President's proposal for social security benefit
 increases is not enacted, the $600 million (of
 the original budget amount of $1.6 billion)
 in the revised budget outlay figure would
 not now be needed for that purpose, in which
 case the outlay ceiling would drop by $600
 million.
 As to the mechanics for adjusting the ceil-
 ing,  timeliness in accommodating govern-
 ment programs to congressional changes is
 essential to orderly administration. Congress
 will be processing budgetary recommenda-
 tions in many different bills, passing through
 various legislative stages over a period of sev-
 eral months-virtually all after the fiscal
 year begins. And it seems essential in the
 interest of consistency and otherwise to cen-
 ter responsibility in one place for at least
 tentative determination of congressional ac-
 tion impact.
 The Director of the Budget is probably in
 the best position to make such determina-
 tions. The monthly reports submitted by the
 Director under subsection (b) of the ceiling
 provision can be evaluated currently. They
 can be checked for consistency and reason-
 ableness with tentative estimates frequently
 made through the budget "scorekeeping" re-
 ports of the Joint Committee on Reduction of
 Federal Expenditures and with those of the
 Committees on Appropriations. Amendatory
 action can be taken-if that seems to be neces-
 sary in the circumstances.
 AUTHORIZATIONS AND APPROPRIATIONS:  THE
 KEYS TO SPENDING CONTROL
 Mr. Chairman, for a long time, I
 fought along with others the so-called
 Bow amendment fixing a ceiling on ex-
 penditures, and I do not apologize for
 that. But, I have come to the conclusion
 that an expenditure ceiling can be mean-
 ingful, and that it will encourage greater
 focus of attention by Congress and the
 country and the press upon spending. But
 in embracing this idea of an expenditure
 ceiling as here proposed, I do not want us
 for any means to delude ourselves. The

 will have been obligated for programs across
 the government but not yet actually paid
 out. The remaining $49 billion, not obligated
 and not expended, is in many accounts across
 the government; there is a comprehensive
 and informative special analysis of it in the
 January budget, Special Analysis Cl, pp. 78-93.
 But'of the $226 billion total beginning car-
 ryover, trust and federal funds combined,
 roughly $86 billion is projected for expendi-
 ture (disbursement, that is) in fiscal 1970,
 and roughly that amount is thus counted in
 the $192.9 billion ceiling figure. The re-
 mainder-some $138 billion after a small
 lapse amount-becomes part 'of the total
 unexpended carryover projected into the fol-
 lowing year, fiscal 1971.
 Roughly then, it can be seen that only
 about $107 billion of the newly projected
 outlay total for 1970($192.9 billion, less the
 $86 billion from carryovers) is estimated to
 come from the $205.9 billion new budget

 of $100 million.
 This morning and on Thursday we are
 trying to find out what caused an inac-
 curate estimate it is not all overrun-
 on the C-5A aircraft. There are a num-
 ber of factors involved. The gentleman
 knows as well as I do that thi C n
 s  o
 guess
 has not got the courage to stand up
 here and stop some of these crazy pro-
 grams that we have, for instance, the Job
 Corps and the OEO and a lot of these
 things we are spending money on all over
 hell's half acre. But they will go to the
 military and cut them to smithereens.
 This is what it is coming to.
 We have inaccurate estimates all over
 the lot in the military and when you
 superimpose  that  on  the  escalation
 caused by the increased cost of living,
 our military is going to come up short
 and we are going to have half a defense.
 It would be far better to abolish cer-
 tain items for the military and come
 clean with the American people and say,
 "W d    t
 e ono want you to have the Polaris
 program-we do not want you to have
 new bombers-even though the B-52's
 are 15 years old. We do not want you to
 modernize your navy yards. We do not
 want you to have a good merchant ma-
 rine program. We do not want you to go
 on with the new fighter needs that were
 denied us under the McNamara pro-
 grams. We do not want you to have a
 moon shot.."
 This is where these things are coming
 to. That is the weakness of provisions
 such as the one to which the gentleman
 referred. Why do we not cross each
 bridge at the time we come to it?
 Barr MAHON  Th t

 a  s w at we pro-

 th
 e time we come to it as each appro-
 priation bill is before us, or each bill
 from  a legislative  committee  which
 mandates certain expenditures is be-
 fore us. Action on these bills will in effect
 maintain, or lower, or raise the expendi-
 ture ceiling.
 Mr. RIVERS. We probably hold longer
 hearings  in our committee than any
 committee of the Congress. We have a
 number of subcommittees going now.
 They are trying their best to save money.
 The distinguished chairman's commit-

 May 20, 1969             CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE
 proposed, and I am afraid it is a mis-
 take.
 Mr. MAHON. According to the esti-
 mates-and we are, for the time being,
 accepting the expenditure estimates of
 the administration-the military will
 expend about $78 billion this fiscal year
 and a similar amount for next year. The
 full amount so estimated for next year-
 fiscal 1970-is provided for in the pro-
 posed spending ceiling in the bill before
 us.
 If our military people, those with stars
 on their shoulders and those in civilian
 capacities, will run the Defense Depart-
 ment in a businesslike and efficient way,
 I would think ,that sums available and in
 prospect would be adequate. I would hope
 that the sums are more than adequate.
 One of the things that disturbs me is
 that there have been so many mistakes
 made by the military. This has tended to
 generate a lack of confidence. I grant
 that the problems have been of great
 magnitude and complexity.
 Let me say. that I have confidence in
 the military. I do not have unlimited con-
 fidence in their managerial ability.
 Mr: RIVERS. I do not know anybody
 who does.
 Mr. MAHON. Let me give an example.
 I joined in cutting the military budget $5
 billion plus, last year. I am not beholden
 to any department of this Government. I
 want to make that clear. I am sure the
 gentleman from South Carolina shares
 this attitude completely.
 With respect to management, just
 think of the humiliation we suffered a
 few days ago when the Navy, through
 neglect, let a submarine in a Navy ship-
 yard go to the bottom. And what is that
 going to cost. us? _$25 million. Of course,
 if we are going to let the defense dollar go
 down the drain in any such irresponsible
 manner as that, it would not be possible
 to supply the military with adequate
 funds.
 ? I would say this: I have confidence in
 the administration and feel that expend-
 itures in the military area will not be cut
 without any regard to the welfare of the
 country. I am aware that the Secretary
 of Defense served on the Committee on
 Appropriations of the House and the De-
 fense Subcommittee for many years.
 I cannot think of him in a role of an
 appeaser or a nonspender when it comes
 to necessary defense expenditures. So I
 would, say, let us take the Pentagon at its
 word as a starting point on the amount
 of funds needed. When our hearings on
 Mdefense programs are completed we can
 reduce or increase the budget figure and
 the final figure, agreed upon by Congress
 and enacted Into, law will determine
 what can be spent in fiscal 1970.
 Now, before I yield to my good and dis-
 tinguished friend, my able colleague, let
 me say that.I believe in the ABM. I be-
 lieve in a strong military program. I de-
 plore the low estate in which the military
 finds Itself, I want to see confidence re-
 stored in this area. We need to have re-
 spect and to have reason to have respect
 for all departments and branches of Gov-
 ernment.
 I yield to the gentleman from South
 Carolina.
 Mr. RIVERS. Mr. Chairman, the gen-
 tleman gave wings to the very things I
 was talking about. I do not wear any-
 body's collar either. I am looking for
 encomiums, and 1 do not get them
 around Washington, as the gentleman
 knows.
 I want to say this, that the military
 now has reached deplorable conditions.
 We have 60 percent of our fleet which is
 not fit to live on or in because someone
 budgeted too low. The chairman has not
 heard the last of t1re results of McNa-
 mara's systems anliiyjt crowd. We have
 not heard the last. of that. They are
 bringing disrespect rand derision on mili-
 tary men who have not made a decision
 over there since Mc: 'amara darkened the
 doors of the Pentagon. We have deficits
 coming up day in arni day out, day in and
 day out, over which the military men
 had no control.
 We cannot think we-can just put a
 hard, hidebound ceiling on any kind of
 restrictions and think we can let each
 tub sit on its botlsim. That is, in my
 opinion, a mistake.
 Mr. MAHON. There are some leaks in
 Government tubs and we are trying to
 close some of them.
 Mr. RIVERS. I d-) not deprecate the
 efforts of the chairman, but I am sure an
 enlisted man did nest puli the seacock on
 that submarine. It could have been sab-
 otaged.
 Mr. MAHON. I do not know who is
 responsible, but the Navy should find out
 who is responsible and see that he is
 adequately disciplircd. If they want to
 gain higher respect, this kind of action
 must be taken.
 Mr. RIVERS. I agree. We must re-
 store responsibility in the military-and
 then hold them responsible. And let me
 tell the chairman, e ?Ir committee is go-
 ing to investigate that incident and, for
 whatever it is worth, we are going to re-
 port to the Chairman on this.
 THE SO-CALLED PEACE DIVIDEND IN FEDERAL
 rL  DS
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman. The chairman of the
 Armed Services Committee has made a
 statement which makes it appropriate
 at this time for me to discuss a further
 situation.
 Many of the programs and ships and
 weapons of the military are obsolete or
 are becoming obsolescent. There is no
 doubt of that. Large programs are go-
 ing to be necessary to outfit the Navy
 and the other services. with modern ships,
 aircraft, and other weapons. Defense
 spending is not going to toboggan down-
 ward when the war ends in Vietnam.
 There will be reductions but the costs
 will remain high.
 Military spending is going to have to
 remain high because survival is the first
 law of nations. It is iciescspabie that the
 military programs a_,-e going to remain
 high and we are going to have to sup-
 port them. That is one of the reasons
 we want a better job done by the mili-
 tary-by civilians and those in uni-
 form-in order that we may get more
 for the dollar.
 But those who are writing in the pa-
 pers and saying to their speeches, "Wait
 H 3835
 until the war is over, and then we will
 have unlimited resources for all the so-
 cial programs," are too optimistic. Some
 seem to think that Secretary Finch will
 have all the money he wants for educa-
 tion, for health, and the poor, and the
 Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
 opment will have all the money he wants
 to for housing and related needs.
 That is incorrect, They are not going
 to have all the money they want. There
 is not enough money in the Nation to
 meet all these demands.
 Besides that, money is not the only
 answer in defense, and it is not the only
 answer in our social programs. I think it
 Is a little bit cruel for us to make state-
 ments which would lead the cities and
 the mayors and the poor and others to
 believe that when the war is over we will
 have unlimited funds for all purposes
 which may be desired. We just will not
 have that kind of money, and let us tell
 the people that now.
 Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 SUPPLEMENTALS FOR INTEREST SUBSIDY
 PROGRAMS
 Mr. SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Chairman,
 the gentleman said he does not want any
 exceptions to his limitations provision
 but, in fact, by not including some of the
 practices or programs under the limita-
 tion, there are exceptions. For example,
 there is no limit on the amount that they
 can obligate for interest subsidies. And
 now it is proposed, instead of having cur-
 rent expenditures within the fiscal year
 for a direct loan program and grants for
 college facilities, they will have a pro-
 gram to pay only $11 million this year
 and obligate us for $440 million, which
 does not show up in this year's budget.
 So in effect the limitation is no limita-
 tion so long as that is permitted, is it?
 Mr. MAHON. I wish the gentleman
 would let his own statement stand as he
 made it. I am not quite sure of the import
 of the statement.
 Mr. SMITH of Iowa. But it does not
 limit them from obligating us to pay for
 the next 35 years under these programs.
 Mr. MAHON. Oh, I see what the gen-
 tleman means and his point is well
 taken.
 I call the attention of the gentleman
 from North Carolina (Mr. JONAS) to this
 matter. Under the housing programs
 there is a provision in the bill providing
 authority for $80 million for subsidies for
 1 year. We provide a certain amount for
 1 year, but when we do this we obligate
 ourselves for 40 years.
 I believe the gentleman from North
 Carolina has tabulated the total amount
 of money in these housing programs that
 will be mandated as a result of this bill
 if we pass it. Will the gentleman give
 that figure?
 Mr. JONAS. If the gentlemen will yield,
 it will be 40 times 80, and that is $3.2
 billion we will be obligating the taxpayers
 to pay over the 40-year period.
 I remind the chairman that already in
 this fiscal year, we have provided $50
 million for those two programs, so we
 have to add that to the $3.2 billion. You

 will find in these two programs, sections
 235 and 236 of the housing law as
 amended, we will be obligating the tax-
 payers of this country to the amount of
 $5.2 billion over the 40-year period.
 Mr. MAHON. About $5.2 billion. It
 looks ', ery minimal when one looks at the
 bill, rut when one looks at the costs
 which we are obligated to pay over 40
 years it Is about $5.2 billion.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman,
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield.
 Mr. JONAS. This has been said, but
 needs to be emphasized. This spending
 limitation does not purport to remain in
 effect beyond next year. It is only for i
 year, is that not true?
 Mr. MAHON. It is only for 1 year. It
 might be for only 30 days, if we change
 it, but this is not proposed for more than
 1 yea:-. Next year we can do something
 similar with respect to fiscal 1971 if we
 so determine.
 Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Illinois.
 Mr. MICHEL. If I might make a fur-
 ther point with respect to the institutions
 of higher learning and their construction
 needs, there is $3.9 million in this bill for
 interest subsidy, which will construct
 $145 million worth of college facilities.
 If you do not want that, then just wipe
 out t:-ie interest subsidy. It all depends
 on hcw much we appropriate In this bill
 for tl.e Interest subsidy, as to where that
 ceilin goes.
 As he gentleman from North Carolina
 says, this is an expenditure ceiling for
 just the 1 year, not for 30 or 40 years.
 Mr SMITH of Iowa. Mr. Chairman,
 will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. 11?AHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr SMITH of Iowa. This illustrates
 my point very well. If they get the $3.9
 million interest subsidy, they will with-
 hold the $150 million already appropri-
 ated for direct loans. That $150 million
 would be under the limitation, whereas
 the $3.9 million isall of the $145 million
 that shows up in the fiscal year. This is
 a big loophole.
 Mr. MICHEL. It is not a permanent
 loopl ole if you choose to use that word.
 It is effective only for this year.
 What we are saying is that since we
 a?- is such a bind, instead of a direct
 appropriation of $1.45 million for direct
 loans let us do it by the interest subsidy
 route, and finance the balance through
 the private sector.
 SCOPE OF PROPOSED EXPENDITURE CEILING
 FOR 1970
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I should like to com-
 mend the gentleman from Texas for a
 most interesting and enlightening state-
 ment. I should like to ask a question on
 a problem I have dealing with appropria-
 tions.
 An item in my district which was nec-
 essary was not included in the Nixon
 budg 3t. Under this limitation would It
 preclude the Nixon administration from
 amending the budget and providing an  his views. The ceiling should help but
 item that is not In the present budget? holding down authorizations and appro-
 Mr. MAHON. There is nothing In this ?priations Is the surest way to cut spend-
 limitation that would preclude the Nixon
 administration  from  amending  the
 budget and placing the item in it. There
 is nothing in this limitation which would
 preclude Congress from providing the
 funds for theunbudgeted items. So there
 is nothing inflexible Insofar as the gen-
 tleman's problem is concerned in the
 resolution now before_ us.
 Mr. BE LA GARZA. Therefore, if I un-
 derstand the gentleman correctly, the
 limitation goes only to the amount and
 the Congress can act independently or
 the executive can revise Its budget. Is
 that what the gentleman stated?
 Mr. MAHON. I think the point Is clear.
 Mr. DE LA GARZA. I thank the gen-
 tleman.
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Chair-
 man, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Florida.
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. I do not think
 this is such a novel approach. The Con-
 gress considered it before and in effect
 we have done it before.
 Mr. MAHON. I believe we have never
 done it before. I will say to the gentle-
 man. Not quite.
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. I think we
 have put a limitation in effect before
 when we put a limitation, for Instance,
 on the national debt. In effect, we said
 that there was a limitation on the bor-
 rowing budget.
 The gentleman will recall that the
 Hoover Commission recommended and
 this Congress debated the proposal that
 limitations on spending be placed upon
 each governmental department. In other
 words,  taking  the  overall limitation
 which   you  are  now  proposing  and
 breaking it down. The reason for the
 spending limitation was that the Con-
 gress could then control the expendi-
 ture budget, which we do not now
 control. All we can do here is appro-
 priate the money, and the executive
 controls the rate of expenditure. The
 Hoover Commission's proposal, which
 you are proposing to carry out now, was
 to put a limitation on what the Congress
 itself might control. It does not mean
 that you cannot vary that figure if con-
 ditions change which call for it. Congress
 can vary It. But it is a restraint on ad-
 ditional spending. It also advises the
 Congress, the way it was originally pro-
 posed, and if there were slippages, we
 could find out why there were, and if
 there were overages proposed, we could
 find out why. So it is not so novel.
 Mr. MAHON. The gentleman in effect
 is In favor of the limitation?
 Mr. ROGERS of Florida. I certainly
 am. And I think it should be done even
 more. We should do it on each depart-
 ment. I wish the chairman had agreed
 some years ago, along with some other
 members of the Committee on Appro-
 priations, to place expenditure limita-
 tions on Government departments be-
 cause we could have been doing it all
 these years and prevented a great deal of
 the wild spending that we have had.
 I thank the gentleman for yielding.
 Mr. MAHON. My friend is entitled to
 ing. No one can predict just what Con-
 gress will do, but I hope that the pro-
 posal here will be well supported by the
 House and by the other body.
 COMPARISON OF TITLE IV OF PENDING BILL WITH
 THE  LEGISLATIVE  BUDGET PROPOSAL  IN THE
 1946 REORGANIZATION ACT
 Mr. Chairman, in elaboration, may I
 add that the discussion recalls the efforts
 of the Congress, some 22 years ago, to en-
 act a legislative budget, an important
 and really key feature of which was to
 put a ceiling on Government spending.
 I think it might be useful to insert an
 analysis comparing that effort with title
 IV of the pending bill:
 By proposing a ceiling on the aggregate of
 government spending for fiscal 1970. title IV
 of the pending bill would secure something
 of what the framers of the legislative budget
 plan In the 1946 Reorganization  Act  had
 in mind, but which Congress in fact never
 accomplished. It would be useful to recall
 briefly what that plan was about, refer to
 the experiences in attempting to carry it
 out, and make some note of the similarities
 and dissimilarities between the provisions
 of the 1946 plan and title IV of the pending
 bill.
 THE 1946 LEGISLATIVE BUDGET PLAN
 The legislative budget plan was spelled out
 in the 1946 law, It is now a part of Rule
 XLSI of the Rules of the House, and reads
 as follows:
 "(a) The Committee on Ways and Means
 and the Committee on Appropriations of
 the House of Representatives, and the Com-
 mittee on Finance and the Committee on
 Appropriations of the Senate, or duly au-
 thorized subcommittees thereof, are author-
 ized and  directed to meet jointly  at the
 beginning of each regular session of Con-
 gress and after study and consultation, giving
 due consideration to the budget recommend-
 ations of the President, report to their re-
 spective Houses a legislative budget for the
 ensuing fiscal year, including the estimated
 over-all Federal receipts and expenditures for
 such year, Such report shall contain a recom-
 mendation for the maximum amount to be
 appropriated for expenditure in such year
 which shall include such an amount to be
 reserved for deficiencies as may be deemed
 necessary by such committees. If the esti-
 mated receipts exceed the estimated ex-
 penditures, -such  report  shall  contain  a
 recommendation for a reduction in the pub-
 lic, debt. Such report shall, be made by
 February 15.
 "(b) The report shall be accompanied by
 a  concurrent resolution  adopting such
 budget, and Axing the maximum amount to
 be appropriated for expenditure in such year.
 If  the  estimated  expenditures  exceed the
 estimated receipts, the concurrent resolu-
 tion shall Include a section substantially as
 follows: 'That it is the sense of the Congress
 that the public debt shall be Increased in
 an amount equal to the amount by which
 the estifnnted expenditures for the ensuing
 fiscal year exceed the estimated receipts, such
 amount being       "
 In other words, the joint committee, after
 study of the budget and consultations other-
 wise. was 10 bring in, early In the session, a
 concurrent resolution proposing an expres-
 sion of the judgment of the Congress as to
 the probable budget revenuesfor the com-
 ing fiscal year and fixing a maximum budget
 expenditure goal for the year.
 There wsa nothing mandatory or compell-
 ing about any ceiling so fixed upon.
 It was not an enactment requiring approval
 of the President.

 previously, appropriated money which
 has not been spent. Some of'it has been
 obligated, but it will have $13.5 billion
 of unobligated funds at the end of this
 year.
 We have appropriated to that Depart-
 ment nearly. $1 billion since 1967-$948
 million, to be exact, for the new model
 cities program, and very little of it has
 been spent. They announced nine grants
 a few months ago, and over the last week-
 end three more were announced.
 I do not know what causes the delay.
 I know it took the previous Secretary of
 Housing and  Urban  Development  7
 months after he had all of the plans in
 to even select the first group of cities.
 So I do not 'believe Congress can be
 justly charged with any lack of a sense
 of urgency about these problems. I be-
 lieve much of the delay can be attributed
 to paper shuffling, foot dragging and
 bureaucracy in the department.
 Let me tell you in brief capsule form
 some of the programs Congress has
 funded for the aid of cities.
 Urban renewal is one of the important
 ones. Do you know that,through 1969
 the Congress has provided HUD and-its
 predecessor with $4.6 billion for urban
 renewal? Through 1969 the Congress
 has provided nearly $3 billion public
 housing subsidies? Let me show you how
 the cost of the subsidy for public housing
 is increasing as the years go by.
 The total was $208 million in 1965.
 It went up_to $241 million in 1966.
 It went to $261 million in 1967.
 Then to $295 million in 1968.
 It went to $350 million, plus a $16 mil-
 lion supplemental or to $366 million in
 1969.
 The 1970 budget calls for $473 million.
 New -public housing starts are sched-
 uled at 130,000 in 1970.
 We have the rent supplement program.
 We have the homeownership program,
 and we have, the rental subsidy program.
 We have the housing for the elderly
 and the rehabilitation program.
 We have the below-market interest
 program and we have the community
 facilities program; the open-space land
 programs.
 You name them-there are about 70
 different programs in the Department
 of Housing and Urban Development be-
 ing funded by the Congress from funds
 extracted from all of the taxpayers of
 the United States-70 different programs
 operated by one Department of the Gov-
 ernment, in various aid to the cities.
 Yet we are accused of doing nothing.
 The truth of, the matter is, that we
 are spending about $3,0 billion a year on
 urban problems.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the

 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 myself 5 additional minutes.
 Mr. Chairman, in a colloquy with the
 chairman earlier, I responded to the
 question as to what brancdilew programs
 we are funding in this supplemental and
 what they will cost-and I refer now to
 the programs under section 235, that is
 the homeownership program, a program
 under which. the Government will sub-

 We put in the regular bill last year
 $25 million in cont~actsguthority for that
 program, and we are including in the
 supplemental an additional $40 million
 in contract authority; That is $65 mil-
 lion that is being voted this fiscal year
 for this new program which is just get-
 ting under way. That contract author-
 ity simply means that we give the de-
 partment authority to commit the Gov-
 ernment to spend $65 million a year on
 homeownership interest subsidies for 40
 years-or $2.6 billion.
 There is a companion program under
 section 236, known as the rental hous-
 ing assistance pi-s-gram, which carried
 the same figure of $25 million in the
 regular bill and another $40 million in
 this supplemental. So under these two
 sections, these two new programs, in
 addition to public homing and in addi-
 tion to urban area and in addition to
 community facilities and in addition to
 all of these other programs-here are
 two additional programs that are going
 to cost-even if we do not ever give them
 another dime in future years-that are
 going to cost the taxpayers $5.2 billion.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JONAS. I weld to the chairman of
 the committee.
 Mr. MAHON. The gentleman is pursu-
 ing a very interesting aspect of Federal
 spending. I hope that he will place in
 the RECORD in connection with his re-
 marks, if the figures have been as-
 sembled-and I k. now the gentleman's
 subcommittee has asked for them-the
 continuing costs that are mandated by
 previous actions on all these various
 housing-type  programs,  rent  supple-
 ments, and so forth.
 The reason I make this request is that
 there are those Rho feel that Congress
 is losing control of the purse. I think we
 are not losing cont?o1 of the purse at all.
 When we appropriate money, we expect
 it to be spent for the programs which we
 have endorsed. In the past we have not
 tried to fix a rate of expenditure of the
 funds which we have provided for vari-
 ous programs except to a limited degree,
 which we discussed ea=Tier. But if you
 approve a series of long-term programs
 and you grant the first down payment on
 a 40-year program, then for 40 years
 the Government is committed to that
 particular expenditure, because it is fixed
 by an action of the Congress. It is done
 by Congress. It is not a loss of control
 by Congress in the beginning, but we
 lock just that much more into the fixed
 and subsequently uncontrollable area of
 expenditure.
 I would like to have the gentleman's
 views on that matter.
 Mr. JONAS. I certainly agree with
 the chairman, ano- I believe he would
 agree with me that we ought to begin
 giving closer scrutiny to requests for
 contract authority. That is where the
 process begins. We cannot keep up with
 what is going on unless
 as we
 rant
 H 3839
 amount that will be involved, because
 when we grant contract authority, what
 we do is to pile up mandatory appropria-
 tions over the period of the contract.
 Some of those contracts go for 35 years,
 most of them for 40 years. What we are
 doing here, in funding Sections 235 and
 236, is a clear example of the mistake we
 make when we talk about appropriating
 $80 million when the cost of the program
 is $3.2 billion.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JONAS. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. Between the statements
 of the distinguished chairman of the
 committee and the distinguished gen-
 tleman from North Carolina, we are al-
 most drowned In figures concerning this
 bill, and it is proper that the chairman
 and the gentleman from North Caro-
 lina give us the figures contained in this
 bill. But let me see if I can get a small-
 sized handle on this big spending pro-
 posal in this way: This bill provides for
 a ceiling of $192,900,000,000, is that cor-
 rect?
 Mr. JONAS. That is correct.
 Mr. GROSS: What are the total esti-
 mated expenditures for this fiscal year?
 In other words, this bill would fix a ceil-
 ing of $192.9 billion for fiscal 1970. What
 will be the amount spent in this fiscal
 year which ends on June 30?
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JONAS. I yield to the chairman
 of our committee.
 Mr. MAHON. The expenditure for this
 year will be about $185 billion. So, under
 the administration's expenditure pro-
 jection, expenditures would go up by $8
 billion, 1970 over 1969, and appropria-
 tions would go up by about $10 billion.
 Mr. GROSS. The gentleman refers to
 the $192.9 billion. Does that include the
 expenditures that he is giving the House
 now for the present fiscal year? Does
 that include the $3.8 billion in this sup-
 plemental?
 Mr. MAHON. Yes; the $3.8 billion is all
 within these figures.
 Mr. GROSS. They definitely include
 the $3.8 billion in this supplemental?
 Mr. MAHON. The gentleman is cor-
 rect.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, I am glad
 the gentleman from Iowa made that
 point, because .I did not want to forget
 to remind the committee that if we adopt
 the recommendations of our committee
 with respect to the spending limitation,
 that will not be the end. We are going
 to have to. work hard on every single
 appropriation bill to make reductions,
 because otherwise any reductions that
 are made will have to be made by the
 executive branch of the Government.
 There are Members of this body who
 do not want to give him the discretion
 or authority to decide where cuts shall
 be made. So we reserve the right, if we
 do our duty and live up to our respon-
 sibility and do not abdicate to the Pres-
 ident the authority to make these cuts,
 to make the cuts in subsequent appro-
 priation bills for fiscal year 1970 as they

 berstamp all the appropriation bills, and
 we do not intend to do it, but we have
 to have some support on this floor.
 I have already heard rumors that ef-
 forts are going to be made to increase
 the Nixon budget. While the majority
 leader in the other body is making state-
 ments that spending should be reduced
 $10 billion below the Nixon budget. And,
 there are people on this side of the Capi-
 tol who are saying already that the
 spending cuts are too deep. I think it Is
 true, as it has been in all but 3 of the
 last 14 years, that spending has been
 underestimated by whoever was in the
 White House, and I think spending this
 year  in the 1970 budget is under-
 estimated. I am sure it is underestimated
 in the interest on the national debt and
 in some other areas also.
 I agree with the Chairman that this Is
 not going to be any sweet pill for the
 administration to swallow. It is some-
 thing that the administration would like
 to avoid, I am sure. I certainly would not
 want to have to live under this limitation
 if I were the Executive or if I were his
 Director of the Bureau of the Budget, but
 they understand full well that they have
 the responsibility of trying their dead-
 level best to live up to these spending
 limitations, and they are going to have
 to live up to them unless Congress
 shoulc. unwisely I think exceed the bud-
 get requests on some appropriation bills.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. JONAS. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, I thank
 the gentleman for yielding. I do so merely
 to make the point that I agree again with
 the gentleman from Texas (MT. MAHON)
 and the gentleman from North Carolina
 (Mr. JONAS) that we cannot emphasize
 too strongly the necessity for watching
 the authorization bills as they come in.
 In that regard, I am not aware of a
 single authorization bill that has been
 approved so far in this session of Con-
 gress-.hat has not carried an increase in
 spending. Is the gentleman aware of an
 authorization bill that has not been in-
 creased?
 Mr. JONAS. I am aware of the fact
 that one adopted on the floor of this
 House a few days ago was substantially
 above the budget.
 Mr. GROSS. I do not know of a single
 one that has not provided for an In-
 creased outlay of money.
 Mr. JONAS, The gentleman from Iowa
 is correct. That is the first place to start.
 The second place to start is within the
 Appropriations Committee, and I think
 we are going to bring some substantial
 cuts here for the consideration of the
 House, and we are going to ask for the
 Members' cooperation as we undertake to
 make some substantial reductions this
 year.
 Mr. Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to
 the gentleman from California (Mr.
 Ln'scoMa).
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Chairman, the
 need for supplemental appropriations for
 the Department of Defense for fiscal year
 1969 has been recognized as needed and
 requited for many months.
 The Committee on Appropriations in
 their report dated July 19, 1968, No.
 1735 on the Department of Defense ap-
 propriation bill for fiscal year 1969, dis-
 cussed the budgetary effect of the war In
 Vietnam and the possibility of added
 funds. The report stated:
 It is probable that the funds provided will
 not be entirely adequate through the end of
 the current fiscal year and that a supple-
 mental request will be made In the next sea-
 slon of Congress. This has been the case in
 the past several years.
 The committee In their report also in-
 formed the House that funds were not
 included for military or civilian pay in-
 creases which became effective July 1,
 1968. The committee report when dis-
 cussing other fiscal considerations stated :
 In accordance with longstanding custom.
 this bill does not include funds for the mili-
 tary and civilian pay Increase for fiscal year
 1969, which became effective this month.
 There will be. as has been the case in the
 past, a supplemental estimate presented to
 the next session of Congress covering such
 costs government-wide.
 On September 11, 1968. when the fiscal
 year 1969 bill was before the House of
 Representatives. I remarked on the need
 for added appropriations as follows:
 It should also be noted that the Depart-
 ment of Defense will require additional fiscal
 year 1969 funds in order to meet present re-
 quirements, particularly in Southeast Asia. A
 supplemental request will be required. This
 has been the case in the past several years.
 known increases already Indicate constimp-
 tion of certain specific ammunition items
 has greatly increased. Pbrce deployments al-
 ready approved are In excess of those upon
 which the budget was based. If the war con-
 tinues at the present rate of expenditure of
 material, other costs will rise. The military
 and civilian pay Increases which went into
 effect July 1, 1968, are not included In the
 budget now before the House.
 The additional new obligational au-
 thority recommended In this second sup-
 plemental appropriation bill for fiscal
 year 1969, H.R. 11400, now before the
 House, for the Department of Defense, In
 titles I, II, and III Is a net total of
 $2,312,068,000.
 These additional funds are required to
 support United States and our allies mili-
 tary operations in Southeast Asia. Funds
 are included for the pay of military per-
 sonnel, for operation and maintenance,
 and for procurement of items to replace
 combat losses. The total request also in-
 cludes funds for military and civilian pay
 Increases already implemented under
 provisions of previously enacted laws and
 mandatory increases in military retired
 pay.
 The supplemental budget estimates for
 fiscal year 1969 for the Department of
 Defense as proposed and transmitted to
 the Congress by President Johnson, Jan-
 uary 17, 1969 totaled $3,011,900,000. A
 reassessment by President Nixon's ad-
 ministration was completed in April and
 the revised estimate to Congress totaled
 $2,871,200,000 a reduction of $140,700,-
 000. The Appropriations Subcommittee
 on the Department of Defense after de-
 voting considerable time to analyzing
 the request, recommended a further re-
 duction of $559,132,000. The $2,312,068,-
 000 total recommended in this bill rep-
 resents a total decrease of $699,832,000
 below the January 17, 1969 estimate.
 For title I the revised estimates for
 military operations in Southeast Asia
 totaled $1,496,900,000. The committee
 reduced this amount by $262,900,000 and
 recommends  appropriations  totaling
 $1,234,000,000.
 In title R the committee recommends
 appropriations totaling $226,050,000, a
 reduction of $23,632,000 below the revised
 request of $249,682,000. The largest part
 of the funds requested in this title, $175,-
 000,000, is for "Retired pay, military."
 The requirement for additional funds
 results from increased benefits paid in
 accordance with cost of living allow-
 ancespreviously authorized by law.
 The balance of the appropriations in
 title II is funding for increased per diem
 costs for reservists in travel status based
 on a new law, Public Law 90-168, prem-
 ium pay and employee benefits for Na-
 tional Guard technicians, depot overhaul
 of Guard equipment and aircraft, and
 funds for training and other operational
 costs.
 Under title III there is recommended
 $852,018,000 for military and civilian pay
 increases. This is a reduction of $272,-
 600.000 below the revised request. The
 subcommittee reduced all requests for
 funds to. meet increased pay costs as the
 requests were estimated on the total an-
 nual requirements which were based on
 first quarter obligations. Many of the
 estimates have been proven to be over-
 stated at this point in time.
 The gross amount recommended for
 the Department of Defense in this bill
 for military and civilian pay increases
 under titles I and II is $903,768,000. Of
 this amount $678,950,000 is for military
 pay and $224,818,000 is for civilian pay.
 The additional pay costs and added
 funds stem from the second phase com-
 parability pay adjustments effective last
 July 1. These increases were authorized
 in Public Law 90-206, the Federal Salary
 Act of 1967, and Public Law 90-207, in-
 creasing the basic pay for members of
 the uniformed services.
 The Appropriations Subcommittee on
 the Department of Defense spent con-
 siderable time in analyzing the request
 for the funds requested to be assured
 that only those additional funds actually
 required were recommended. We feel
 that the funds which are included in this
 bill are needed and the appropriation
 should be approved,
 MILITARY OPERATIONS IN souvass r ASIA
 President Johnson's budget for fiscal
 year 1969 submitted in January, 1968,
 proposed defense expenditures for sup-
 port of  Vietnam  operations  in  the
 amount of $25.8 billion. It was known
 during 1968 that figure was a low esti-
 mate.
 The present estimate for military oper-
 ations in Vietnam for fiscal year 1969
 is $28.8 billion In expenditures. This
 amount includes the estimates submit-
 ted in connection with the pending bill.
 In January of this year the supple-
 mental requirement for fiscal year 1969
 in support of military operations in
 Vietnam was estimated at $1.632 billion.
 The reassessment which the new admin-
 istration completed in April confirmed
 the validity of the requirement but re-
 duced the funds requested to $1.497

 ployees chose to use the compensation
 route rather than choosing sick leave.
 But today that figure is practically re-
 versed to 57 percent of the employees
 using compensation rather than sick
 leave.
 In the area of higher education the
 first item of interest is that of interest
 subsidy grants in the amount of $3,-
 920,000. This will initiate a new program
 of debt service grants authorized in the
 higher education amendments that we
 passed last year.
 That was Public Law 90-575, signed
 into  law  October  16,  1968.  It  re-
 places the same amount of direct Federal
 loans permitting a substantial reduction
 in Federal expenditures for fiscal years
 1969 and 1970, as we pointed out earlier
 in our colloquy on the subject with the
 gentleman from Iowa (Mr. SMITH). The
 Federal Government in this program
 pays the difference between the 3-percent
 interest rate and the going rate-and
 incidentally, in the fiscal year 1970
 budget there is an item for interest
 subsidy in the amount of $10,670,000,
 which will provide for an increase then
 of $6,750,000 for fiscal year 1970. Obvi-
 ously this manifests itself in a greater
 construction of facilities at our institu-
 tions of higher learning in the years to
 come.
 Incidentally, they told us in our hear-
 ings that there are applications on file
 for in excess of $200 million worth of
 construction. As I said, this $3.9 million
 will give us $145 million of construction
 this first year.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. MICHEL. I yield to the gentle-
 man from North Carolina.
 Mr. JONAS. I believe the gentleman
 is approximately correct. We have the
 same problem in our bill in our subcom-
 mittee in funding HUD's requests. It is a
 lot better, I believe, to provide assistance
 with interest payments than for the
 Federal Government to go into the money
 market and compete with business en-
 terprises and individuals for the available
 credit, and thus put our fiscal house more
 in disorder than is already the case.
 Mr. MICHEL. I believe the gentleman
 from North Carolina makes a good point.
 Of course, Congress so expressed itself
 when we passed this law in October of
 1968 providing for this.
 I might say that this year we have
 about 6 million college students, and the
 projection is that in 1970 we will have
 10 million students at our institutions of
 higher learning, so the need for the
 construction of facilities is paramount.
 There is also an item in here of $7,241,-
 000. This is for the Federal City College,
 a direct payment, or a one-lump-sum
 payment to the Federal City College in
 the District of Columbia. This was the
 amount authorized in Public Law 90-
 354 as a one-time lump-sum appropria-
 tion in lieu of a land grant for the Fed-
 eral City College in the District of Co-
 lumbia. We were told that this sum will

 Second, the seizure of the U.S.S. Pueblo

 Koreans resulted in the callup of Reserve
 Forces to meet the possible military
 threat, deployment of additional air and

 presently authorized deployment of 549,-

 The operation and maintenance ap-
 propriations require supplemental ap-

 terial, aircraft fuel and oil and increases
 and modernization of the Armed Forces
 of the Republic of Vietnam.
 Included in, this supplemental are
 additional funds for the modernization
 and upgrading of the South Vietnamese
 Armed Forces. This is a very significant
 part of this supplemental bill.
 President Nixon on Wednesday, May
 14, said that the strengthening of the
 South Vietnamese  forces  has  been
 speeded up and the President said:
 That time is approaching when South
 Vietnamese forces will be able to take over
 some  of the  fighting  fronts now being
 manned by Americans.
 The funds in this bill will directly aid
 the speed up of the strengthening of the
 South Vietnamese forces.
 Significantly this bill as recommended
 b the committee includes a total of
 and should be appropriated.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 10
 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois
 (Mr. MICHEL).
 (Mr. MICHEL asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his
 remarks.)
 Mr. MICHEL. Mr. Chairman, there is a
 portion of this bill to which I would like
 to address myself, and it is that having
 to do with the Departments of Labor,
 Health, Education, and Welfare. This in-
 volves $700 million of the bill, broken
 down as follows: $35.9 million for the De-
 partment of Labor and $677 million for
 the Department of Health, Education,
 and Welfare.
 The first item having to do with the
 Department of Labor is a $20 million
 item for unemployment compensation for
 Federal employees and ex-servicemen.
 The members of the committee will
 recall that earlier in the year we passed
 a supplemental in the amount of $36 mil-
 lion. This will be in addition to that in
 order to rectify those faulty estimates
 that were submitted to us at the begin-
 ning of fiscal year 1969.
 Then, too, there is also an item of $15.9
 million for employees'  compensation,
 claims and expenses. Now, both of these
 items are mandatory payments required
 by law. Both were seat up by the Nixon
 administration,  because the previous
 estimates, as I said, were too low.
 Mr. Chairman, I think it should be
 borne in mind that compensation benefits
 paid to surviving children. are involved
 in this particular Rein. Back in 1966 when
 we amended the law we provided that
 full-time students could receive pay-
 ments until the age of 23; whereas, before
 they were cut off at the age of 18. We were
 told in our testimony that these pay-

 $246.4                                  ments to these children average $110 a
 million in funds which are for
 purposes which will enable the South    month or $1,320 per year per child. This

 ure of something like $12 million for the
 entire country. So here we are for fiscal
 year 1970 giving the District of Columbia
 a proportionate cut of the shares that
 normally go to the other 50 States.
 Then too under the second Morrill. Act
 the Federal City College would come in
 for another share of $50,000 out of the
 total allotment of $2,600,000 for the
 country.
 In the Item of the public health service,
 comprehensive health planning and serv-
 ices, there Is an item of $128,000 for
 Increased pay under Public Law 90-206
 and 207. $9,600,000, the biggest item
 here, Is for a program to combat German
 measles, better known as Rubella, the
 8-day type of measles. We have now been
 told that an effective vaccine has been
 developed and Is expected to be licensed
 Within the very near future.
 'What we are doing here is actually a
 forward funding so that we will not have
 to wait to get this program underway
 until the normal appropriation bill can
 be massed later In the year.
 Incidentally, to give you some idea of
 the proportions of the problem here,
 there is expected to be another epedemic
 eJther this year or next year. if we look
 back to the last Rubella epedemic that
 we had in 1964, there were some 20,000
 children born with defects. The testi-
 mony before our committee states that
 this will cost us in the end some $2.8
 mlll:.on in medical costs without even
 considering the rehabilitation costs for
 these poor children, the 20,000 or more
 who were born with deformities of one
 kind or another as a result of that Ru-
 bells. epedemic in 1964.
 So It is a very worthwhile project and
 one which should go forward Immedi-
 ateb'.
 Then for District of Columbia medical
 facilities there is an item here of some
 $15 million. This is a portion of the
 amount authorized under Public Law
 90-457 for grants and loans to construct
 hospitals and other medical facilities in
 the District of Columbia.
 The Item was included in the 1970 ap-
 propriation bill but we moved it forward
 here in this supplemental to enable hos-
 pitals In the District of Columbia to
 move ahead with their construction
 which is already underway.
 We have been told there are some very
 serious financial troubles among the vari-
 ous hospitals here in the District of
 Columbia.
 This is a very worthwhile item.
 The biggest item in this supplemental
 consists of HEW and has to do with
 grants to States for public assistance.
 This is a total of $651,546.000. This fig-
 ure merges together three appropria-
 tion requests-maintenance payments to
 States in the amount of $343,524,000 and
 this is $30 million under their request.
 Although we were told in the testimony
 that this is a legitimate figure now that

 will recall; the increased average pay-

 rising medical costs.
 So this is an astronomical figure that
 we are talking about here in these grants
 to the States for public assistance and
 something certainly has to be done to
 reorient this whole program or else we
 are going to have to shoot the moon in
 the future to come up with sufficient
 funds to cover these programs that have

 Mr.  ANDREWS  of  Alabama.  Mr.
 Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
 tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Hax-
 SaN).
 Mrs. HANSEN of Washington. Mr.
 Chairman, Inquiries have been made
 about chapter VI,  the Interior and
 related agencies section of the supple-
 mental bill, particularly in regard to ad-
 ditional funding for the increased pro-
 duction of timber.
 There is $610,000 provided in chap-
 ter VI to accelerate timber production In
 the fiscal year 1969 on national forest
 and Indian lands as part of the national
 effort to increase the timber supply and
 thus ameliorate the current shortage
 which has contributed materially to the
 increased  price  of lumber.  Of that
 amount, $150,000 is provided for the
 Bureau of Indian Affairs and $460,000
 is  for  the  U.S.  Forest  Service.  It
 is estimated this will produce an addi-
 tional 75 million board feet from the
 BIA forests and an additional 270 mil-
 lion board feet from the U.S. Forest
 Service lands.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentlewoman yield?
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. LANGEN. Mr. Chairman, I take
 this brief time merely to call to the atten-
 tion of the House the items that are in
 the supplemental bill relating to the De-
 partment of Agriculture. There are just
 four items, each of which is demanded
 because of an emergency, or because of
 mandatory provisions which require the
 expenditures, which is the true purpose
 of the supplemental appropriation bill,
 in my estimation.
 The first item is a matter of $1,400,000,
 which is needed in order to combat a
 very serious outbreak of screw-worm in
 the Southwest part of the United States,
 which we were unable to forecast during
 the course of the regular appropriations
 for the fiscal year 1969. This amount of
 money has actually already been spent.
 The Director of the Bureau of the Budget
 has the authority to authorize these ex-
 penditures in order to meet the emer-
 gency, and for that reason they have
 to be reimbursed at this time.
 In addition, there is an item of $218,000
 which is to meet the mandatory Federal
 contribution to the retirement fund for
 the State extension personnel. These
 payments are related to the increased
 funds provided by the Congress in the
 regular 1969 appropriation bill to place
 the extension jobs on a salary basis more
 comparable with other agricultural per-
 sonnel.
 Then there is an item of $7,500,000,
 which is necessary in order to meet the
 regular sugar beet payments, which Is a
 mandatory payment that must be made.
 The increased moneys become necessary
 because the crop last year was greater
 than the estimate.

 There is the usual flap about the
 dangers  of  chemical  and  biological
 weapons which always is good for col-
 umn after column of horror stories in
 the liberal elements of the press. What
 they do not print is that the Russians
 have seven or eight times our capability
 in this field, and that we could be dan-
 gerously exposed in time to a Russian
 attack with these weapons as an altern-
 ative to a nuclear confrontation. In the
 field of nuclear weapons, we can at least
 trade destructiveness.
 The question of the ABM has been
 greatly overplayed. It is a simple case
 of survival for our nuclear weapons ca-
 pability. I have felt that at least equal
 protection should have been provided
 for people in cities but apparently in an
 effort to negate the antivotes, the ad-
 ministration has cut back on the scope
 and purpose of the ABM. Both aspects
 should have been approved.
 In other words, we in America find
 ourselves completing the cycle we have
 seen on so many other occasions in our
 country. The commentators tell us that
 people are getting, tired of war-that
 they want it ended-and that they want
 no more involvement in foreign affairs.
 They are saying in effect that we want
 to retreat to the security of our own
 continent. All of this is more than a lit-
 tle disconcerting. I do not believe this
 fallacy is reflected in the thinking of
 the average American. I believe that a
 substantial majority of the American
 people know why we are fighting in Viet-
 nam. They want this war won. They do
 not want us walking away from Viet-
 nam with our tail between our legs, set-
 ting the tragic stage for another war
 when the Communists get ready for an-
 other takeover of territory and peoples.
 Our first mistake was in trying too
 hard to fight this war without incon-
 veniencing anyone-to fight it so that
 we could have both guns and butter. It
 is never possible to fight a war without
 inconveniencing someone. The fact of
 35,000 being killed in a war which is not
 yet resolved attest to the fallacy of this
 approach in the Vietnamese conflict. The
 people should have been told why we
 were fighting. They should have been
 shown that it is in America's best inter-
 ests to fight now and win rather than to
 risk having all of the Pacific fall into
 Communist hands in the years to come.
 We should have been told that it is pa-
 triotic to wear the uniform, patriotic to
 be proud of the flag, patriotic to stand
 up for our country. Because this was not
 done, the antiwar crowd has had a field
 day, with the Communists happily at
 work stirring up anti-American senti-
 ment at every point.
 As a part of this pattern, attacks are
 now being leveled at our military leader-
 ship. Unfortunately, this too has always
 been a part of the American way of con-
 ducting its affairs. When those in uni-
 form are winning wars for us, they are
 our heroes. When we no longer need
 them, we pick them to pieces. The fact
 that many people now believe it is ad-
 ministration policy to get out of Vietnam
 regardless of the cost in strengthening
 sistance.

 the efforts of every person who seeks the
 eventual downfall of the American sys-
 tem of government.
 The uncertainty which is sweeping
 America is not confined to defense. It
 goes much broader. It involves the whole
 specs:lum of national security, and in
 this I include all of the unrest which is
 refle,,ted in the news media day after
 day acid which in too many instances is
 promoted by them.
 We here in the -House of Representa-
 tives have our responsibility. It has not
 changed because there is wholesale at-
 tack upon the military, or because there
 is concern about the cost of spending,
 or llecause people are tired of taxes. We
 have a responsibility to insure that those
 who fight our battles in Vietnam, under
 whatever orders they fight. receive inso-
 far as it is possible for us to do so, every
 single item that they need. We have the
 responsibility of demonstrating to the
 work. that we are determined that this
 Nation shall not, If we can avoid it, be-
 come defenseless in the years ahead. We
 have a reesponsibility to demonstrate
 that there is solidarity in Government.
 and that we will confront conununism
 everywhere with determination. Don't
 think for a moment that the Communists
 are not watching what is happening here
 on the floor of the House of Representa-
 tives today. Do not think for a moment
 that they are not noting loud and clear
 what we say and what we do. I do not
 think I need to remind those here today
 that ;re could, by responsible action, help
 set the stage to throw away in Paris
 what the uniformed services have fought
 for on the battlefields of Vietnam. We
 could throw away whatever chance is
 left for success in this long, terrible and
 costly struggle.
 These who say that America has lost
 the war or cannot win it, do our country
 a great disservice, for neither is true.
 By th-.4r steadfastness on the battlefield,
 America's fighting forces have brought
 the Communists to the point where they
 want peace. Now they are trying to
 achles e at the corlerence table what
 they could not achieve on the battlefield.
 More :han ever, there is reason for unity
 at home and for a show of strength for
 America in this body, which really speaks
 with the voice of the American people.
 One of the items of great interest is
 the ABM. The question of deployment
 of thL3 system should be resolved with-
 out further controversy. I hope the House
 will follow with me some comments from
 informed sources on the real function
 and the need for an ABM system. For
 instance there are those who urge con-
 tinuing research  and  development-
 and not deployment- The principal pur-
 pose of ABM under the present proposal
 is to offer protection, as needed, to our
 deterr,>nt forces.
 As Secretary Laird points out:
 Simply continuing research and develop-
 ment c?n the ABM without any initial de-
 ployment, would leave us with no option to
 provide defense to our deterrent on the
 schedu:e that might be required by the So-
 viet threat if we do not reach an agreement
 with the Soviets on limiting strategic forces,
 tem, there has been a substantial body of
 testimony supporting the effectiveness
 of this type of deployment.
 Dr. Harold Brown said in testifying be-
 fore the House Armed Services Commit-
 tee in 1967:
 Because our missile sites are small hard-
 ened targets, they are much easier to defend
 than cities. The exchange ratio Is favor-
 able to us for the defense of this type of
 target.
 Dr. Edward Teller said in a recent U.S.
 News & World Report interview:
 Twelve years ago it seemed that a missile
 defense was 30 times as expensive as an of-
 fense. Today the ratio is estimated at 3 to 1,
 although still in favor of offense. In some
 respects It is even estimated at 1 to 1. The
 main point is we don't really know. We
 can't find out except by actual deployment.
 In rebutting recent unfavorable com-
 ment on the feasibility of defending
 Minuteman sites against a heavy threat,
 Dr. Foster made the following comment:
 Various estimates of the cost of an Inter-
 ceptor including its assigned fraction and
 the radar andother systems costa have varied
 between $2.5 million and $7 million. The
 present cost to the U.S. and probably the
 Soviet Union for an offensive R/V is in ex-
 cess of $10 million. The advances which we
 expect In our forces over the next few years
 may reduce these to about $3 million... .
 In other words, the cost to attack and to
 defend in the 1970 time frame are roughly
 one to one,
 Moreover, those who are responsible
 for our national defense have said that
 now is the time to get on with the deploy-
 ment of the Safeguard system to defend
 our Minuteman sites. I agree.
 Secretary Laird said before the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee on March
 21 of this year:
 We cannot delay the decision beyond this
 budget that we presented to this Congress,
 covering the program for fiscal year 1970.
 which begins on July 1. 1969, We must in.
 clude this deployment on two sites In this
 particular budget.
 He had earlier said:
 We have sufficient strength today In the
 combination of our strategic forces-our mis-
 siles, our bombers, and our Polaris capabil-
 ity-to respond to any attack that might be
 launched against the United States.
 As Secretary of Defense, it is my obligation
 and my Intention to keep it that way beyond
 any reasonable doubt. This Is what the ABM
 discussion is all about.
 And that is why we have no alternative but
 to protect our options to safeguard our deter-
 rent forces. If the Soviet threat turns out to
 be, as the evidence strongly indicates, an at-
 tempt to erode our deterrent capability, we
 must be in a position to convince them that
 a first strike would always involve unaccept-
 able risks.
 In addition, and again quoting Secre-
 tary Laird:
 Safeguard ... offers protection, as needed,
 of the entire country from a small attack,
 such as the kind of attack that could be pos-
 sibly delivered by the Chinese Communists
 during the decade of the 1970's or from an
 accidental launch.
 The estimate of our intelligence commu-
 nity is that the earliest the Red Chinese
 could have this kind of capacity would be in
 the 1972-73 time period, and the estimate is
 th
 t i

 and the capability to have 15 or more ore m rateie-
 terrent as an option of the Sentinel sys-                            apes.
 Dr. Edward Teller, in U.S. News &
 World Report, said:
 A small nuclear force such as they will have
 in a few years could wreak real havoc on an
 undefended United States. We might have to
 give in to Chinese demands affecting not only
 South Vietnam but also Taiwan and even
 Japan, rather than take the slightest risk of
 their not bluffing.
 In regard to the Sentinel system as a
 defense against the Chinese threat, Sec-
 retary McNamara stated July 1967:
 This austere defense could probably pre-
 clude damage In the 1970's almost entirely.
 Dr. Foster stated more recently-on
 May 12, 1969:
 The Safeguard system has been designed by
 competent people, and the best that are avail-
 able. Its design has been reviewed by outside
 experts. Those who do, In fact, study the
 aspects of the system that are within their
 area of technical expertise are convinced it
 will do what it is designed to do. There are
 some eminent scientists who, for one reason
 or other, claim it won't work. On that I'd
 like to say    . that they have offered no
 problem which we have not long since ad-
 dressed and resolved."
 Finally  Under  Secretary
 stated on March 14, 1969:
 Locating sites away from major  cities
 should make clear to the Soviet Union that
 the American defense is designed to preserve
 our deterrent-not to change the strategic
 balance.
 It has been suggested in some quarters
 that the administration has somehow
 misled Congress about its intentions in
 deploying the Safeguard system.
 I think it is useful to review the letter
 of the law here.
 The current authorizations for the
 ABM defense system for procurement,
 research and development and military
 construction for the  Army  read as
 follows:
 Public Law 90-500, for procurement:
 SEC. 101. Funds are hereby authorized to be
 appropriated during the fiscal year 1969 for
 the use of the Armed Forces of the United
 States for procurement of aircraft, missiles,
 naval vessels, and tracked combat vehicles, as
 authorized by law, in amounts as follows:
 ... For missiles: for the Army, $956,140,000.
 Public Law 90-500, Tor resarch and

 as follows: For the Army, $1,611,900,000.
 Public Law 90-408, for military con-
 struction:
 SEC. 101. The Secretary of the Army may
 establish or develop military installations
 and facilities  by acquiring,  constructing,

 May 20, 1968             CONGRESSIONAL ACCORD-HOUSE
 Clearly both the Safeguard and Senti-
 nal systems fit under the language of the
 law.
 In fact, there is an understanding in
 the Congress and in the Defense Depart-
 ment that funds must be spent for the
 purposes for which they were authorized
 and appropriated.
 In the case of the. ABM system, the
 purpose for which they were authorized
 and appropriated was to provide a de-
 fense against ballistic missiles. To accuse
 the officials of this administration of bad
 faith for deploying the best balanced
 ABM they can design is simply to dis-
 regard the previous actions of Congress.
 Congress should not get into the busi-
 ness of trying to design the anti-ballistic-
 missile system either in its minute tech-
 nical details or in its tactical deployment
 configuration. These decisions should be
 left to defense planners. I suspect that
 much of the agreement we hear, includ-
 ing many of the technical arguments, are
 being put forth by people who are already
 over their head or who are not apprised
 of all the facts.
 Congress has in the past given rather
 broad authority for the construction of
 the ABM system. If it wishes to change
 this method of operation, it can do so
 when the additional funds which will be
 required for the deployment of phase I
 of the Safeguard system are authorized
 and appropriated for fiscal year 1970.
 There are other items of more than
 average importance which are likely to
 escape specific attention because they are
 not sensational and because there ap-
 pears to be no pressing need that they re-
 ceive other than casual consideration.
 Yet these may be of very great impor-
 tance.
 For instance, there is the problem of
 maintenance of real property facilities.
 The taxpayers should be very directly
 concerned with this problem. So should
 be the military officials. So it would seem
 would be the Congress.
 Nevertheless, this subject presents an
 increasingly aggravated picture which I
 want to discuss at this point.
 The Committee on Appropriations has
 for many years been urging that the mil-
 itary services properly and adequately
 maintain the extensive real property
 holdings  within  their  jurisdictions.
 Some 15 years ago this interest was
 manifested in the appropriation of funds
 above the budget estimates for the then
 existing backlog of deferred mainten-
 ance. The committee found that much
 of this claimed deferred maintenance
 either did not rest on valid estimates or
 the need was subsequently ignored by
 the services and the practice of appro-
 priating over the budget for real property
 maintenance ceased.
 Indeed, during the ensuing several
 years it became apparent that moneys
 Justified to Congress for the mainten-
 ance- of real property facilities were be-
 ing diverted to other uses=in the absence
 of any restrictive law or legislative his-
 tory. Consequently in recent years, the
 committee has recommended, and Con-
 gress has agreed to, language in the a-p-
 propriation acts establishing floors or
 minimums in the amounts of money
 which must be devoted to real property
 maintenance. In the current Appropria-
 tion Act for the fiscal year 1969. for ex-
 ample, the language reads for the Navy:
 "of which not less than $155,600,000 shall
 be available only for maintenance of
 real property facil i ties."
 In the case of the Marine Corps the
 language reads similarly: "of which not
 less than $22,661,000 shall be available.
 only for the m.ainenance of real prop-
 erty facilities."
 House Document No. 91-50 proposed
 revisions reducing those amounts. Tes-
 timony in the hearings on the second
 supplemental appropriation bill indi-
 cated that reductions were made in the
 floors on real property maintenance
 based on "congressional intent." It ap-
 peared from the txstimony that this in-
 terpretation of congressional intent was
 based on the Revenue and Expenditure
 Control At of 1968 and its effect on
 Government expenditures generally.
 It would seem to me, Mr. Chairman,
 that we have here a situation of either
 ignoring, or violating, congressional in-
 tent by the militsry.
 I should like to point out that the Rev-
 enue and Expenditure Control Act of
 1968 was enacted into law on June 28,
 1968, Public Law 90-364. While its terms
 and conditions allowed some flexibility,
 some considerable flexibility in the exec-
 utive branch, there was not in connection
 with its enactment- at least to my
 knowledge --any discussion of an intent
 to cutback on the maintenance of real
 property facilities of the Department of
 Defense. Congress does not want these
 cutbacks.
 Now I should like to,point out that the
 appropriation bill for the Department of
 Defense for the kcal year 1969 was en-
 acted into,law by virtue of the signature
 of the President on 11        17, 1968,
 Public Law 90-580., The appropriation
 bill contains as. a matter of law the
 phrases which I have previously quoted.
 I do not believe it likely that the Depart-
 ment can find a -hred of evidence in the
 debate or in the committee reports on
 the defense appropriation bill indicating
 that the language of the law was intend-
 ed to be set aside by any assumed or
 presumed interpretation of congressional
 intent stepnming from the earlier en-
 actment of the l venue and Expenditure.
 Control Act of 1968, On the contrary, it
 could be presumed that the enactment
 of the floors on maintenance of real
 properties in specifie numbers and at a
 later date ,indicates the precise opposite,
 namely, that it is the intent that such an
 amount must inf.s.ct be expended for the
 purpose.
 It is clear that much of the difficulty
 that we encounter in Congress, in the
 academic world, and through all facets,
 of our society, stein from misinterpreta-
 tions of honestly presented sets of facts.
 It is further cleat that. in most instances,
 if not in all instances, those who so mis
 interpret do totally and completely es-
 cape  any  remonstrance,  much  less
 punishment, for their willful acts.
 Although I, do not wish to magnify
 the incident out of all proportion, it is
 safe to say that the taxpayers of the
 country will at some future date have to
 shoulder the burden of new construction
 143845
 prematurely or unnecessarily because of
 failure to adequately maintain facilities
 that are now in being. Certainly, some-
 one should be called to task for permit-
 ting such a situation to exist.
 The CHAIRMAN.  The time  of  the
 gentleman from Florida has expired.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 5 additional minutes to the gentleman
 from Florida.
 The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
 Florida is recognized for 5 additional

 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. SIKES. I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 ANTI-BALLISTIC-MISSILE SYSTEM
 Mr. MAHON. The gentleman from
 Florida made reference to the anti-
 ballistic-missile program, The gentle-
 man is aware that in the fiscal year 1970
 budget which is before Congress, but
 which is not under consideration in this
 bill, there is about $860 million for a
 continuation of the ABM program.
 In my opening remarks, I took the
 position that we should go forward with
 the ABM program. I would like to am-
 plify that by giving, in part, some of the
 reasons why we have been working on
 this program for years. The Soviet Union,
 our most formidable opponent, has a
 somewhat limited anti-ballistic-missile
 system deployed. It seems to me that it
 would be militarily and politically un-
 sound and indefensible for use not to
 undertake to have a defense against the
 intercontinental ballistic missiles of the
 Soviet Union and of Red China.
 My opinion is that we must proceed
 now with the anti-ballistic-missile pro-
 gram. It is my feeling that the Members
 of Congress, generally, will approve of
 this view, and -I am convinced that the
 American people will approve of this
 view. I do not believe the American
 people want to be completely defenseless
 with respect to the intercontinental bal-
 listic missiles of the Soviet Union or of
 Red China. This would be illogical while
 the Soviet Union 'is prgviding some de-
 fense for its people. Whether or not their
 system is very far advanced begs the
 question. Therefore we should undertake
 to provide--some. defense against the
 possibility of attack by intercontinental
 ballistic missiles of either nation.
 I believe the gentleman's opening re-
 marks should be read by all Members of
 Mr.  SIKES.  The  gentleman  from
 Texas has stated the situation precisely
 and he has stated it very well.
 We are trying to assure at this point
 that we can retaliate if the need should
 develop-we are seeking to insure for our
 country a capability which at least par-
 allels the development which has been
 proceeding on an ABM system within
 Russia for a number of years. I feel that
 the American people demand that this
 be done. I feel that their voice is not
 really being heard in the quarters where
 protests are raised against the ABM sys-
 It is my opinion that we would be
 making a most serious mistake if we
 should not proceed with at least the

 small ABM program that has now been
 proposed.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, I would ask
 the gentleman further if an article in
 the U.S. News & World Report, by Dr.
 Teller, one of the great scientists of the
 country, and a discussion by Dr. Weisner,
 another great scientist, who are both
 very familiar with this problem, has been
 called to his attention.
 We are aware that there is much dis-
 cussicn of the ABM in the scientific com-
 munity, but as I see it this issue is one
 of jucgment, and that is not an issue to
 be settled by the scientists alone. I would
 hope ':hat those interested in this matter
 will probe deeply enough to understand
 what the fundamental issue is, and that
 is whether or not we shall let our chief
 opponent have a protection against our
 missllrs and have none ourselves against
 his.
 Mr. SI ES. The gentleman has stated
 the situation perfectly.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. SIBS. I yield to the gentleman
 frgm California.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Chairman, I con-
 cur completely with the gentleman from'
 Florida and the gentleman from Texas
 in the need for the Safeguard ABM. I
 believe that It is absolutely necessary
 that yr a go ahead on this modified pro-
 gram as recommended by President
 Nixon.
 The decision of President Nixon an-
 nounced on March 14, 1969, calling for
 the deployment of the Safeguard anti-
 ballistic-missile system was made only
 after n searching and exhaustive analysis
 of the clearly emerging threat to the
 Nation and its people in the mid-1970's.
 All the available options and alternatives
 were thoroughly examined leading to the
 determination that Safeguard would pro-
 vide a beginning toward the best protec-
 tion against those threats.
 In the judgment of the President, and
 of others within the Government who
 are charged with the direct responsibility
 tar preserving our national security, the
 initial deploynltnt of Safeguard repre-
 sents the minimum action which must
 be taken now to preserve the credibility
 of our nuclear deterrent in the immedi-
 ate years ahead.
 The decision to deploy Safeguard is
 remarkable for the controversy which it
 has generated. Some members of the
 Congress and some persons within the
 scientific community have taken Issue
 with tie President's decision. They have
 been joined in their opposition by others
 who find in Safeguard an excellent op-
 portunity to give vent to their frustra-
 tions over the course of events in Viet-
 nam, thereby injecting an emotionalism
 into a debate which, because of its cri-
 tical importance to national security,
 should be governed only by rational and
 reasoned factual presentations.
 Becr.use the President is Commander
 in Chief of our military forces and, more
 than f.ny other one man charged with
 the awesome responsibility of providing
 for the national defense, many Members
 of Congress, in the exercise of their con-
 stitutional responsibilities, have normal-
 ly followed the practice of according
 great weight to such momentous deter-
 minations by the President. The Pres-
 ident has immediately at hand the most
 sensitive intelligence information upon
 which these vital decisions must be
 based.
 For my own part. I would have to be
 absolutely convinced that I was right
 and the President was wrong before I
 could, in good conscience, oppose him
 on a national security matter of this
 magnitude. Moreover, in cases where the
 issue might be described as somewhat
 doubtful, my conscience would dictate
 that such doubts be resolved in favor of
 the President's determination that his
 recommended action is necessary for our
 country's protection. This has been my
 position with respect to all Presidents,
 of either political party.
 It is obvious that all the people of the
 United States have a vital stake in the
 decision we make as to whether or not
 we should attempt a ballistic missile
 defense. It Is appropriate to determine
 the desires of the people. And I mean
 all the people-not just those with the
 resources to publish and circulate their
 views, nor Just those who participate in
 organized letter-writing campaigns to
 Congress.
 When President Nixon assumed office
 in January of this year, be inherited from
 his predecessor the beginnings of de-
 ployment of an ABM system, the Sen-
 tinel. The decision of President Johnson,
 announced in September 1967, to begin
 deployment had been endorsed by Con-
 gress in 1968 and funds had been pro-
 vided for a start on the system. Produc-
 tion of the various components of the
 system had been initiated, sites acquired,
 and, at some sites, work had commenced.
 The Nixon administration suspended
 work on Sentinel deployment while It
 conducted a broad and thorough review
 of the general problems of ballistic mis-
 sile defense including specifically the
 basic possible missions of such defenses
 and an analysis of the actual and poten-
 tial Soviet and Chinese nuclear threat
 capabilities to our cities and to our stra-
 tegic retaliatory capability.
 An important part of the review in-
 cluded an analysis of the many alter-
 native ways of accomplishing the bal-
 listic missile defense missions. The alter-
 natives examined included :
 First, not building any ballistic mis-
 sile defense at this time, maintaining the
 research and development program, and
 relying on improvements in our retalia-
 tory weapons to deter Soviet and Chinese
 attacks on our cities and strategic retal-
 iatory forces:
 Second, defending our strategic retal-
 iatory forces-our second-strike capa-
 bility-by hardening our missile silos and
 further dispersing of our bomber bases;
 and
 Third, several alternative ABM de-
 ployments, including: a "heavy" defense
 against Soviet nuclear attacks on our
 major cities, ballistic missile defense of
 our strategic retaliatory  forces,  the
 Sentinel defense against the expected
 Chinese threat and accidential attacks,
 a sea-based anti-ballistic-missile inter-
 cept  system-SABMIS-and  various
 combinations of these alternatives.
 Finally, the review included a careful
 evaluation of the technical and opera-
 tional feasibility of ballistic missile de-
 fense. systems based on current tech-
 nology and current intelligence.
 After a careful consideration of the
 alternatives, President Nixon reached
 the following conclusions: First, the con-
 cept on which the Sentinel program of
 the previous administration was based
 should be substantially modified; sec-
 ond, the ,safety of our country requires
 that we should proceed now with the
 development and construction of the new
 system in a carefully phased program;
 third, this program will be reviewed an-
 nually from the point of view of tech-
 nicial developments, the threat, and the
 diplomatic context including any talks
 on arms limitation.
 The Safeguard system has been de-
 signed so that its defensive intent is un-
 mistakable. It will be implemented not
 according to some fixed, theoretical
 schedule, but in a manner clearly re-
 lated to a periodic analysis of the threat.
 The Safeguard system provides for the
 phased protection of our land-based
 forces and the light, overall protection
 of population. This deployment will per-
 mit a shift of radar and missile sites
 away from major cities.
 Both the Nixon administration and
 the Johnson administration agree on
 the capabilities and limitations of the
 ARM system which technology permits
 us to deploy at the present time.
 Both administrations agree that our
 ABM system at its present stage of de-
 velopment cannot be expected, no mat-
 ter how deployed, to provide an effec-
 tive defense of all our Nation's popula-
 tion against a heavy nuclear attack.
 Both administrations agree that our
 ABM system does have the capability,
 in several types of deployment, of de=
 fending all our population against a
 light nuclear attack.
 Both administrations agree that our
 ABM system does have the capability of
 providing a strong, although not preclu-
 sive, defense of a specific target of lim-
 ited area against a heavy nuclear attack.
 This evaluation, concurred in by both
 administrations, is extremely important.
 It was not made lightly, nor by any one
 person, or by any persons specializing
 in one field. This is not just a weapon,
 but a weapon system. It consists of a
 number of components, including nu-
 clear warheads, which were and con-
 tinue to be designed and tested under-
 -ground by our nuclear physicists; mis-
 siles, which have been designed, con-
 structed, tested, repeatedly improved,
 and tested further;  data processing
 equipment, which has also been built
 and tested; missile site radar, which has
 been built and tested; and perimeter ac-
 quisition radar, all the components of
 which have been tested. In addition, the
 system utilizes technology dealing with
 such diverse areas as component harden-
 ing and command and control.
 An evaluation of the ABM system is a
 complex matter, requiring the participa-
 tion of many specialists from various
 and sundry science and  engineering

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE                    113847
 When I speak ' F ?f 'a threat to our se-
 curity, I am not engaging in specula-
 tion about the intentions of any foreign
 power. As we ,h(d.ad have learned from
 the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, it is dan-
 gerous to base our policy on assumptions
 relating to intentions. Anyone who is not
 privy to deliberations in the Kremlin
 can hardly speak with assurance about
 Soviet intentions at the present time.
 Even certain knnwledr;e of present in-
 tentions would be a poor basis for judg-
 ing the intentions of those who may be
 in power in the Soviet Union 5 years
 or more from now.
 We would be darelict in our responsi-
 bility to the people if we failed to base
 our policies on an estimate. of the ca-
 pability that the Soviet Union or Com-
 munist China will have in the future if
 they continue on their present course
 and if we failed tcs take timely action to
 thwart that capability,
 Projecting into ,he future the current
 rate of construction and deployment of
 the SS-9, we arrive at a figure of 600 such
 ICBM's in operation in the Soviet Union
 -9 is equipped with
 by 1976. If each :3S-
 three independently aimed. warheads-
 a capacity which is technically feasible
 and on which the Soviet Union is work-
 ing-our force of 1,000 long-range Min-
 utemen would be in danger of annihila-
 tion from the 11,800 Soviet warheads. Let
 me quote Dr. John S, Foster, Assistant
 Secretary of Defense for Research and
 Engineering, on this point:
 A missile system having a 20 percent failure
 rate and carrying 3 re-entry vehicles per
 missile, would requ re only 420 missiles to
 attack 1,000 silos. Jr the yield of each re-
 entry vehicle was a reasonable 5 megatons
 and the accuracy a reasonable 1/4 of a mile,
 about 951, of the silos could be destroyed.
 This would mean 50 of ti:e 1,000 Minutemen
 survive.
 Our present strategic offensive force
 includes, of courts?, not only land-based
 long-range missiles but missile-carrying-
 manned bombers and Polaris submarines.
 Can we not be rompiacent about the
 future, some may ask, since two of the
 three elements oh' our deterrent force
 would still be in existence after an SS-9
 attack on Minuteman sites thereby en-
 abling us to inflict retaliatory devastation
 on an attacking nation?
 There are two answers to this ques-
 tion. First, if prudence had not required
 that we keep three elements in our de-
 terrent force, we `would not have devel-
 oped and mainta'nel three in the past.
 Our security is as ureu with three, The
 loss of one would leave us considerably
 less secure. We might get by with two,
 but that involves risks ghat we have been
 unwilling to take in the past. Further,
 we should remember that our bombers,
 even today, are to some degree vulner-
 able and that our submarines may be-
 come vulnerable in the future. We must
 now plan for our defense through the
 next decade. We Know that the Soviet
 Union is at work on, afractional orbital
 bombardment system and other weapons
 which could make both bombers and sub-
 marines vulnerable to attack in the fu-
 ture. To assume that both will continue
 to be safe from attack would be sheer
 folly.
 I do not want to overstate the case.
 In order to achieve, in fact, the capa-
 bility of eroding our assured destruction
 capability in the future, it will be neces-
 sary for the Sov iets to do a number of
 things, but all are things which they
 have demonstrated a competence to ac-
 complish. They would have to equip their
 SS-9 missiles with multiple, individually
 target reentry vehicles  and improve
 their? accuracy. They would have to con-
 tinue to increase the number of such
 ICBM's deployed. They would have to
 continue their ambitious submarine pro-
 gram and possibly add a submerged
 launch missile utilizing a depressed tra-
 jectory., They could improve and deploy
 a more effective ABM system around
 their cities. The accomplishment of these
 improvements in forces, or combinations
 of these programs, on all of which they
 are now engaged, could create doubts of
 the effectiveness of our assured destruc-
 tion capability, provided we take no steps
 not already programed to prevent, or
 to prepare to prevent, such an erosion.
 Because the Chinese ICBM develop-
 ment program has not progressed as rap-
 idly as estimated a year or two ago, there
 has been a tendency to overlook this
 potential threat in the present debate
 on the ABM issue. Today, the intelli-
 gence community is indicating that the
 Chinese Communists may have an oper-
 ational ICBM within 3 to 4 years. If that
 happens; it will be incumbent on the
 United States to have an adequate pro-
 tective force.
 There are a number of factors which
 point out the need for Safeguard to
 counter this growing Chinese threat.
 Most of them have to do with demo-
 graphic factors. The United States has
 63 percent of its population living in
 the 1,000 largest cities. The Chinese, on
 the other hand, have only 11 percent of
 their population living in China's 1,000
 largest cities. One can conclude that the
 Chinese population is widely dispersed
 throughout her large land mass. Fur-
 thermore, as Mao Tse-tung has pointed
 out on numerous occasions, China, with
 its population of 800 million, could sur-
 vive even with a loss of 200 million peo-
 ple from a nuclear attack. Thus, it is
 reasonable to conclude that our ability
 to deter Communist China with our stra-
 tegic offensive forces is considerably less
 certain than in the case of the Soviet
 Union, whose population is much more
 concentrated than China's.
 The population concentration factor
 has a vital bearing on our decision to
 proceed with the Safeguard program.
 The Chinese, with only a few, relatively
 crude ICBM's could inflict a great deal
 of damage on the United States. For the
 United States to retaliate against such
 a strike might require a greater portion
 of our deterrent force than we could
 safely commit. For, by responding to a
 Chinese provocation, we could leave our-
 selves naked to a Soviet attack.
 These reasons, I believe, point out that
 Safeguard is a good investment for pro-
 tecting against a possible Chinese at-
 tack as well as insuring the credibility of
 our deterrent against any possible So-
 viet attack.
 . The second question which we must
 ask to reach the decision about deploy-
 ing Safeguard has to do with its effec-
 fields, who base their evaluations on the
 results of the tests performed. This, how-
 ever, is the very type of careful evalua-
 tion which enabled the Johnson admin-
 istration and, thereafter, the Nixon ad-
 ministration to conclude that our ABM
 system would work, and would do the
 job proposed for it.
 Obviously, no one scientist, however
 learned, can credibly assume personally
 to evaluate the entirety of the system,
 particularly if he has not, been privy to
 the testing accomplished with the com-
 ponents of the system. An impressive
 number of :scientists, however, believe
 that it either will work or can be made
 to work.                 -
 The Johnson administration, based on
 an evaluation of the limitations and ca-
 pabilities of the ABM system, devised a
 proposed deployment to provide a defense
 of our cities against the potential Chi-
 nese Communist capability to launch a
 light nuclear attack in the mid-1970's.
 This is what the Sentinel system, as de-
 signed by the Johnson administration,
 would have done; and this Safeguard
 will continue to do.
 The  preceding  administration  was
 also very much aware of the possibility
 that the Soviet Union might seek to
 develop a capacity to overwhelm our
 land-based missiles and bombers. It
 continued to watch the missile buildup
 in the Soviet Union, believing, however,
 as Secretary McNamara said in January
 1968 that the growth of the Soviet ICBM
 force would decelerate instead of con-
 tinuing at a high rate.
 The Sentinel system of the Johnson
 administration has three purposes, ac-
 cording to Secretary Clifford:
 First, to "prevent a successful missile
 attack from China through the late
 1970's."
 Second, to "limit damage from an
 accidental launch from any source."
 Third, to _"provide the option for in-
 creased defense of our Minuteman force,
 if necessary in the future."
 Safeguard will provide for the first
 two purposes as enumerated by Secre-
 tary Clifford, but most importantly, it
 also will provide for the defense of our
 Minuteman force which under Sentinel,
 had been only optional.
 Neither Secretary McNamara nor Sec-
 retary Clifford believed that the relative
 invulnerability of the missile forces of
 the United States was assured for the
 indefinite future. Both warned that ad-
 ditional steps might be required if that
 invulnerability was to be maintained in
 the 1970's. Just before leaving office, Sec-
 retary Clifford expressed his "increasing
 concern" about "the continuing rapid
 expansion of Soviet strategic offensive
 forces." He went on to warn that-
 We must continually re-examine the vari-
 ous ways in which the Soviets might seek to
 strengthen their strategic forces beyond what
 now seems probable, and take appropriate
 actions now to hedge against them.
 The decision on whether or not to de-
 ploy the Safeguard system,turns, it seems
 to me, on the answer to two questions:
 First. What is the nature of the threat
 which there is reason to believe will con-
 front our Nation in the mid-1970's?
 Second. Is Safeguard an effective way
 of coping with that threat?

 tiveneess. Of all possible courses of action
 which we might take to guard against the
 potential threat of the mid-1970's, Safe-
 guard Is the most effective, the least
 costly, the least provocative.
 There is strong support among the
 most respected scientists who are famil-
 iar with all aspects of our ABM program
 for the conclusion that safeguard will
 provide effective protection to enough
 of our offensive force to make an attack
 upon that force unprofitable for any
 aggressor.
 Among the eminent scientists who
 have publicly expressed support for de-
 ployment of Safeguard are: Dr. Edward
 Tellei, Livermore Radiation Laboratory,
 recognized as one of the world's fore-
 most nuclear physicists: Dr. Eugene P.
 Wignor, Princeton University nuclear
 physicist, elected to the National Acad-
 emy of Sciences 1945. Atoms for Peace
 Award 1980, Nobel Prize for Physics,
 1963; Dr. William Ci. McMillan, Univer-
 sity of California at Los Angeles, profes-
 sor of chemistry, noted specialist on
 strategic nuclear matters such as reentry
 vehicle vulnerability, penetration aids,
 nuclear weapons effects, and missile
 vulne::ability.
 If we could delay our decision on Safe-
 guard until we determine whether or not
 the Soviet Union continues to increase
 its capability to threaten our security-
 or whether success comes of negotiations
 to limit arms, r would be In favor of
 deferring the decision. Unfortunately,
 we cannot wait. It will require more than
 4 yea:As to complete phase I of the Safe-
 guard system, the deployment of pro-
 tection for two missile sites in Montana
 and North Dakota. In the absence of
 authorization from Congress for fiscal
 year 1,970, the Defense Department would
 be required to stop the activity in which
 It has been engaged under authority
 granted last year. It would have to close
 down developmental production lines,
 discharge skilled personnel, and cease
 engineering on sites. If Congress then
 gave authority to proceed in the next
 year, the program would be delayed 2
 years and the first two sites would not
 be In operation until 1976. Time would
 be lost in the search for personnel with
 the necessary skills and in the training
 of a :few force to begin the work anew.
 If we are not ready at the time a
 threat to our secur.ty comes into being,
 we w,ll be no better off than we would
 have been if we had done nothing at all.
 As Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird
 has said:
 Too little and too late has been the epitaph
 of mcre than one great nation in history.
 It mw:t not be ours.
 If, :.n fact, the decision to deploy Safe-
 guarc. imposed an obstacle to fruitful ne-
 gotiations toward arms limitation, this
 might well give us pause. But let us re-
 member that Premier Kosygin In 1967,
 speaking of the embryonic ABM system
 which the U.S.S.R. had already begun
 to deploy, said:
 I believe that defensive systems, which
 prevent attack, are not the cause of the arms
 race, but constitute F. factor preventing the
 death of people.
 Let us remember, too, that President
 Johnson's decision to deploy the Senti-
 nel system, instead of hampering nego-
 tiations, was followed 4 days later by a
 statement of the Soviet leaders that they
 were interested in beginning talks on
 arms restrictions.
 Safeguard is an inducement to arms
 limitation and a building block toward
 peace. We will go forward with talks on
 arms control with a better chance that
 these talks will result in effective agree-
 ments if it Is clear to all the world that
 the United States does not intend to
 stand Idly by while Its capacity to defend
 its people Is undermined. Indeed, an im-
 portant inducement toward agreement
 Is missing if the U.S.S.R. Is lead to be-
 lieve that we will unilaterally limit our
 defensive capacity.
 Safeguard is purely defensive. It is not
 an escalation of the arms race. It does not
 increase one whit the capacity of our
 country to inflict damage on any other
 nation. It is far more moderate step than
 the alternative some of its opponents
 propose--an increase In the size of our
 offensive missile force, or the reckless
 launching of our missiles upon a warn-
 ing, that may or may not be valid, that
 we are about to be attacked. Increasing
 our offensive forces would step up the
 arms race and might give Soviet leaders
 some plausible ground for fearing that
 we were seeking a first-strike capability.
 If the threat that may confront us In
 the mid-1970's fails to develop, whether
 because of international agreement on
 arms control or a change in the pace or
 character of the Soviet buildup, or for
 any other reason, Safeguard can be
 slowed down, altered, or abandoned al-
 together. Deployment is divided into
 phases so that our defensive precautions
 will match the threat and not become an
 overreaction to it.
 President Nixon clearly made these
 points in his announcement of his de-
 cision on Safeguard on March 14 of this
 year. He said:
 I have directed the President's Foreign
 Intelligence Advisory Board-a non-partisan
 group of distinguished private citizens-to
 make a yearly assessment of the threat which
 will supplement our regular intelligence as-
 sessment. Each phase of the deployment will
 be reviewed to insure that we are doing as
 much as necessary but no more than that
 required by the threat existing at that time.
 Since our deployment is to be closely re-
 lated to the threat, it is subject to modifi-
 cation as the threat changes, either through
 negotiations or through unilateral actions
 by the Soviet Union or Communist China.
 To keep In perspective the decision
 which the Congress will be called on to
 make this year. It is important to keep
 in mind the phased program of deploy-
 ment that Is proposed. This year, we de-
 cide only whether to begin on phase
 I so that by 1974 we may have in being
 an antimissile defense of two of our
 missile sites. We do not commit our-
 selves to go beyond that, and the Con-
 gress will have ample opportunity to
 check on the progress of deployment
 and to reassess periodically the con-
 tinued need, for the system.
 If in fact Safeguard deprived us of re-
 sources needed to deal with our pressing
 domestic problems, that fact might give
 us pause. But Safeguard Is not short-
 changing any program designed to cure
 domestic Ills. The decision to deploy this
 system involves spending in fiscal year
 1970 only $250 million more than would
 be spent if we limited ourselves to con-
 tinuing with research and development.
 But a decision to defer deployment would
 add $250 million to the total cost now es-
 timated for deployment. The expenditure
 proposed for deployment in the next fiscal
 year amounts to three-tenths of 1 per-
 cent of the outlays proposed for defense.
 It amounts to a little' more than one-
 tenth of i percent of proposed total
 Federal outlays. In its initial costs, it will
 be substantially less expensive than Sen-
 tinel would have been.
 The estimated expenditure for the
 total Safeguard program is in the neigh-
 borhood of $8 billion, including the war-
 heads. This expenditure would, of course,
 be made over the course of many years. It
 is unlikely that in any year Safeguard
 will demand spending that would equal
 even one-half of 1 percent of the budget.
 To my mind, the basic issue which the
 Safeguard proposal presents is the degree
 of risk to which we are willing to expose
 the American people. I am not inclined to
 gamble when the stakes are the survival
 of our Nation and the safety of its people.
 I would rather be wrong by providing a
 measure of defense that the future might
 show we did not need than be wrong by
 failing to provide the protection required.
 I hope that all Members of Congress,
 when they vote on Safeguard, are con-
 scious that they may well be voting on
 the survival of the United States.
 (Mr. LIPSCOMB asked and was given
 permission to revise and extend his re-
 marks.)
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. SIKES. I am happy to yield to the
 chairman of the committee.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, there is
 the feeling on the part of many-and
 that includes myself-that if we move
 forward with our own ABM system, and
 we can move forward only at a certain
 rate of speed, that if we move forward
 with this program the likelihood will be
 enhanced that we can sit down at the
 conference table with the Soviet Union
 and arrive at some arms control agree-
 ment, not on disarmament, which I be-
 lieve is unobtainable, but some agreement
 for a limitation on armaments. But so
 long as the Soviet Union goes forward
 with the deployment of its ABM and we
 take no steps at all, we are placed in a
 position in this particular field of de-
 fense-and this is defense, and not of-
 fense-of dealing from a position of
 weakness.
 Mr. SIKES. It was after it was an-
 nounced that we in this country were go-
 ing ahead with the ABM system that the
 Soviets first agreed to hold a discussion
 on disarmament. This in itself is indica-
 tive of the validity of the statement the
 gentleman has just made: if we have a
 basis of strength from which to nego-
 tiate the Russians are much more in-
 terested in negotiating. There is no rea-
 son for them to negotiate if they have
 the field for themselves.

 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield the
 gentleman 'from Florida 5 additional
 minutes.
 Mr. SIXES. I thank the gentleman for
 yielding the additional time.
 CANCELLATION OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS
 Mr. MASON. Mr. Chairman, if the
 gentleman will yield further, the com-
 mittee was advised yesterday of the
 cancellation of the procurement of the
 'Cheyenne helicopter. It was canceled
 because it had not been possible for the
 contractor to solve the problems involved
 in developing this system. Of course, this
 program is subject to investigation by
 various  appropriate  committees.  The
 Appropriation Committee intends to take
 a look at it.
 The military from time to time, in
 their sincere desire to provide superior
 Weapons programs attempt to stretch the
 state of the art. They undertake to do
 things which are highly desirable by way
 of weapons development, but some of
 these things are not within the state of
 the art and cannot be accomplished.
 Many years ago, we spent $1 billion
 on a nuclear-powered aircraft, and fi-
 nally we agreed that the state of the
 art had not progressed to where it was
 feasible to produce an acceptable plane
 of this type
 It is unfair and improper tc condemn
 those who try to stretch the state of the
 art in order to improve our weapons.
 They make great efforts to add to the
 Nation's protection and to the budgeting
 capability of our servicemen.
 Is It not understandable that in a
 stretching of the state of the art it is
 from time to time necessary to admit
 defeat? We are prone to call that "money
 down the drain," but if it is in the in-
 terest of trying to provide better defense
 it is not in the truest sense always money
 down the drain,
 Mr. SIKES. This is of course the only
 way we can perfect our weapons sys-
 tems. There must be trial and error. It is
 through this procedure that we have been
 able to develop the highly effective sys-
 tems that we have. Fortunately most of
 them have not encountered problems as
 Serious as the Cheyenne did.
 In the case of the Cheyenne, unfortu-
 nately, hopes did not work out. Defense
 officials were seeking to develop a more
 effective weapons capability in a fast
 helicopter. The helicopter is largely a
 defenseless aircraft and yet is has been
 tremendously useful and ,has filled an
 extremely important need in Vietnam.
 But it is highly vulnerable and the
 military were simply trying to provide a
 faster  helicopter  with an  improved
 Weapons capability that would enable it
 to stand off enemy attack and to provide
 greater support for the troops on the
 ground.
 The thought was good. It would have
 been an extremely important develop-
 ment had It -worked out-end eventually
 'it probably will work out.
 But in the effort to develop within a
 short time something that would be use-
 ful in the Vietnamese war, considerable
 Moneys were e*pended. It has not been
 possible to develop the capability that is
 needed and rather than to continue to
 i#pend money on top of this already
 costly program, the military has decided
 to cancel the Cheyf one.
 Mr. MAHON. L it not true that the
 object of producing the Cheyenne was
 an effort to makeour miiitary men more
 effective and to save the lives of Ameri-
 can soldiers in Vietnam?
 Mr. SIKES. Yes. the purpose is to save
 lives-that is the primary purpose. It
 would have reduced the vulnerability of
 the helicopter, which is a very important
 vehicle, and made it into a gun ship.
 Mr.  MAHO'.  'Pursuing  the  matter
 further, reference was made today to
 the so-called Tli'X and the Navy version,
 the F-111B.
 Here was an effort to produce an air-
 plane which would be suitable for all of
 the services. The objective was highly
 desirable. A great effort was made to
 achieve it, but a: we look. back with
 20/20 hindsight, a~7d I am sure the gen-,
 tleman from Florida would agree, it was
 a mistake to undertake to make the
 F-111 conform to the Navy's require-
 ments, which are in some ways quite dif-
 ferent from the Air Force requirements.
 Mr. SIKES. Yes, but we did not realize
 that at the time. The defense officials
 again felt that this was a way to save
 money. They made.. a very determined
 effort. The effort failed and we have to
 share in the blame because we financed
 what we thought would be a workable
 concept.
 Mr. DAVIS of 'Wisconsin. Mr. Chair-
 man, will the gentleman yield?
 Mr. SIKES. I yield to the distinguished
 gentleman.
 Mr. DAVIS of Wisconsin. I think all of
 us are indebted. tci the chairman of the
 committee and to the second ranking
 member of the defense subcommittee
 and the ranking minority member of the
 committee for this colloquy which is
 putting some  of  these  things  in the
 proper perspective, particularly with re-
 spect to the AEM system. I think this
 colloquy has made it clear that we do not,
 as a practical matter, have a choice be-
 tween the development of the ABM sys-
 tem on the one Y?and and some agree-
 ment or other limiting arms on the
 other. Quite to the contrary, if we were
 to unilaterally make the decision and
 announce to the world, as some of our
 colleagues would have us do, that we are
 not going to defend ourselves against the
 ICBM, we would. thereby destroy our
 capability of reaching any meaningful
 agreement with reference to either the
 ICBM or the ABM.
 Certainly, if we announce beforehand
 that we are not in a position to defend
 ourselves, and that we do not intend to be
 in a position to defend ourselves, then
 we would be going to the conference
 table with no cards at all.
 The CHAIRMAN. The time of the
 gentleman from Florida has expired.
 Mr. MAHON, Mr. Chairman, I yield 5
 additional minuil s to the gentleman
 from Florida.
 Mr. SIKES. Mr. Chairman, I take this
 additional time, f?rst, to thank the dis-
 tinguished gentleirr-zn from Wisconsin for
 this contribution ,,khich is sound, logical
 and meaningful..
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 1-73849
 Mr. SIKES. I yield to the gentleman.
 Mr. MAHON. It seems to make news to
 be against a major defense program, at
 this time the ABM, but it does not make
 iiewgto be in favor of providing this bar-
 rier against an attack which might come
 from China or from the Soviet Union.
 There has been so much talk in the
 country and so many news columns writ-
 ten in opposition to our building a de-
 fense system designed to help to protect
 the lives of American citizens and to
 avoid World War III, it occurs to me
 that it is well for the world to know that
 there are many-and in my opinion the
 overwhelming majority of people in this
 country who believe that this kind of
 protection, as imperfect as it may be, is
 something we must seek to attain.
 I wish to thank the gentleman and my
 colleagues for making reference to these
 matters. No one can convince me that
 the people of the United States want to
 be second best when it comes to self-
 defense. I do not think that we want our
 country to be second best, and I predict
 it will not be second best. I thank the
 gentleman for yielding.
 Mr. SIKES. Let me add that the de-
 ployment of the ABM system, which is
 now proposed, does not mean that we
 will have an imperfect system. We will
 have a system which has the benefit of
 years of research and development, and
 as deployment progresses, it will be pos-
 sible to build into it any improvements
 which the state of the art permits, to
 insure that we will have a fully work-
 able and an effective system.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield further?
 Mr. SIKES. I yield to the gentleman
 from Texas.
 Mr. MAHON. Is not one of the prin-
 cipal obectives of those of us who support
 the ABM to bring about a situation which
 will enable the United States and the
 Soviet Union-and other countries, we
 hope-to make some reduction in arms
 expenditures? That, after all, is our ob-
 jective. I would hope we can join to-
 gether in this effort and eventually
 through these procedures bring to a low-
 er figure the vast resources we have to
 provide for defense.
 Mr. SIKES. That is our objective. It
 is what we are working toward, and I
 believe it is a meaningful step in that
 direction.
 The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
 North Carolina (Mr. JoNAS) is recog-
 nized.
 Mr. JONAS. Mr. Chairman, I have no
 further requests for time.
 I yield back the balance of my time.

 minutes to the gentleman from New York
 (Mr. RYAN).
 (Mr, RYAN asked and was given per-
 mission to revise and extend his  re-

 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, it is un-
 fortunate and regrettable that the sup-
 plemental appropriation bill before us
 lumps together funds which are neces-
 sary and essential for important domes-
 tic programs with a request, as set forth
 in title I, for some $1.2 billion for addi-
 tional support for military operations in
 Southeast Asia.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE             May 20, 1969
 Once again we are faced with a choice
 of either approving the entire package
 recommended  by the  Appropriations
 Committee, and thereby allocating still
 more funds to the prosecution of the war
 in Vietnam, or having to vote against the
 entire supplemental appropriation bill.
 I regret that the Appropriations Com-
 mittee has put us in this situation again.
 There is strong and conscientious oppo-
 sition to continuing to fund the war, and
 Members should have an opportunity to
 vote separately on the $1.2 billion for
 milita y operations in Southeast Asia.
 When the bill is open for amendment
 under the 5-minute rule, I intend to of-
 fer an amendment to strike title I of this
 bill, in order to eliminate the $1.2 billion
 earmarked for Southeast Asian military
 operations. This would permit us to have
 an opportunity to vote on this question.
 However, of course, we know under the
 parliamentary procedure followed, there
 would be no opportunity for a rollcall
 vote. It my amendment does not prevail,
 then I intend to offer a motion to recom-
 mit if have the opportunity.
 I believe that as long as these funds
 remain in this bill, it should be defeated.
 I have pointed out that one-third is al-
 located for the prosecution of the war in
 Vietnam. We have already allocated for
 this fiscal year some $27 or $28 billion for
 the war in Vietnam. Now we are con-
 fronted again with another supplemen-
 tal request.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. RYAN. I am happy to yield to the
 distinguished chairman of the com-
 mittee.                       .
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, one of
 the things that has been undertaken in
 this bill is to provide additional funds
 for the equipping of the South Vietna-
 mese military forces, so that a lesser ef-
 fort will be required by the U.S. forces.
 I believe that this portion of the plan-
 of transferring to the Government of
 South Vietnam a greater responsibility
 for fighting the war and maintaining the
 peace when the war comes to an end-
 probably would meet with the approval
 of the gentleman from New York.
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, I would
 appreciate it if the gentleman from
 Texas, the chairman of the committee,
 would spell out exactly how much of the
 funds in the bill is for equipping the
 forces.for South Vietnam. But it is clear
 also from the testimony, as I read it, that
 the supplemental provides funds for ap-
 proximately 17,400 more American serv-
 icemen than were planned originally in
 the fiscal year 1969.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, in the
 Army procurement portion of the bill be-
 fore u:,, of the $640 million, there are
 $393.7 million for U.S. forces and $246.4
 million for the South Vietnamese Armed
 Forces modernization and improvement
 program. So a quarter of a billion in this
 bill is for the improvement and modern-
 ization of the equipment of the South
 Vietnamese forces. It is this quarter bil-
 lion that the gentleman from Texas had
 in mind in propounding the inquiry of
 the gentleman. There are additional
 Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate
 the explanation of the chairman. Never-
 theless, that does leave for U.S. Southeast
 Asian military operations approximately
 $1 billion-a little less perhaps. And It
 raises a further question about our over-
 all policy in Vietnam in relation to the
 forces of South Vietnam.
 In any event, let me point out that
 according to the testimony, on page 361,
 of General Taylor. the supplemental
 also provides funds for 17,400 more
 troops, that is U.S. troops, than had been
 originally intended.
 It also provides funds for a 50-percent
 increase in bombing by B-52's in South
 Vietnam. I should point out that in an-
 swering a question raised by the distin-
 guished gentleman from Alabama (Mr.
 ANaREws), General Crow said that the
 effect of the B-52 bombings was to make
 certain areas of South Vietnam look like
 the surface of the moon. The gentleman
 from Alabama then observed that the
 United States has used more bombs in
 Vietnam than in World War II and
 asked:
 I wonder how it is going to look when we
 get. through over there. Will it be habitable?
 (Hearings, p. 296).
 I think that Is a good question: Will it
 be habitable? Will anything be left? Or
 will we continue to destroy the country
 in order to save it?
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. RYAN. I am happy to yield to the
 gentleman from Texas.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, as the
 gentleman knows, this bill doesnot pro-
 vide funds to send additional American
 fighting men to South Vietnam. It pro-
 vides for the payment of the men who
 were sent over there as a result of the
 Tet offensive which caused us to in-
 crease our forces. It is not the Intent of
 this bill to increase our manpower In
 South Vietnam.
 Mr. RYAN. I understand the gentle-
 man's argument. The impact, neverthe-
 less, is to provide funds for a higher level
 of troops there than had been budgeted
 for fiscal year 1969.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Chairman, will
 the gentleman yield?
 Mr. RYAN. I yield to the gentleman
 from California.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. Mr. Chairman, on the
 point the gentleman is making and the
 point the chairman of the Appropria-
 tions Committee made, the planned
 strength for U.S. forces in Southeast Asia
 has not been reached as yet, but the
 reason we are implementing funds in this
 supplemental bill is because the Tet of-
 fensive did extensive damage over there
 and made It necessary for us to commit
 more troops and more ammunition and
 other equipment.
 Then, the seizure of the U,S.S. Pueblo
 by Communist North Korea took place.
 It caused us to supplement our efforts In
 the Korean area.
 It was aggressive action by North Viet-
 nam and North Korea which made this
 supplemental which is before us neces-
 sary. We are Just supplying additional
 Mr. RYAN. I do not quite understand
 how funds for the Korean situation come
 under title I, which is entitled "Military
 Operations in Southeast Asia."
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. If the gentleman will
 yield, I will explain it.
 Mr. RYAN. I do not have sufficient
 time.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I yield
 the gentleman 2 more minutes.
 Mr. RYAN. I yield to the gentleman
 from California.
 Mr. LIPSCOMB. At the time of the
 Pueblo incident, the House of Repre-
 sentatives and the Senate, in the appro-
 priation bills, had included funds for
 Korea with funds for Southeast Asia.
 I might point out to the gentleman
 that there are South Korean troops who.
 are helping the United States and the
 South Vietnamese effort in South Viet-
 nam.
 Mr. RYAN. This supplemental appro-
 priation bill Is before us because of an
 underestimation of the cost of the war in
 Southeast Asia. Each year for the past
 5 years Congress has been asked to ap-
 propriate supplemental money for the
 war in Vietnam.
 I have pointed out on each one of those
 occasions-in 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, and
 now 1969--that the only means the
 House has to change the Vietnam policy
 is to exercise the power of the purse. This
 bill presents us with another opportunity
 to vote on the conduct of the war.
 Since last May, when the Paris peace
 talks were started, over 12,000 American
 servicemen have been killed in this war.
 There is no end in sight. The only way
 that the Congress, if it feels that this war
 must be ended, as I do, can exercise any
 influence on the direction of our foreign
 policy In Southeast Asia, is to vote "No"
 to these funds.
 Therefore, I will offer an amendment
 under the 5-minute rule to strike title I.
 I hope it will have wide support so that
 we will be able to separate out the money
 for Southeast Asia military operations
 from the very essential funds contained
 in this bill for domestic programs.
 Almost one-third of this appropria-
 tion is for military operations in South-
 east Asia. H.R. 11400 provides total ap-
 propriations of $3,783,212,766. Of this,
 $1,234,000,000 or about 31 percent is al-
 located for Southeast Asia. This Is above
 and beyond an estimated $27.6 billion
 which Congress has already appropri-
 ated for Vietnam for fiscal year 1969.
 Although President Nixon said in his
 nationwide television address last Wed-
 nesday that he intends to seek a mutual
 withdrawal of American  and North
 Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam,
 testimony from officials of the Depart-
 ment of Defense suggests an increase in
 the size and scope of our military opera-
 tion in Vietnam. The testimony of Gen.
 A. B. Taylor, director of the Army
 budget, reveals that approximately 17,-
 400 more soldiers were deployed in
 Southeast Asia then were originally
 specified in the fiscal year 1969 budget.
 According  to General  Taylor,  these
 troops were not sent as replacements but
 as additions to the existing force Gen-
 sums related to this procurement, such  funds for those two aggressive actions by              eral Taylor went on to say that addl-
 as $50 million for the transportation of the Communists. That is the purpose of              tlonal troops would be deployed during
 equipment, and so forth.  this supplemental,                                     the next fiscal year. Hearings on second

 supplemental appropriations bill, 1969,
 page 361.
 For 5 years supplemental apbropria-
 tions bills have been used to escalate the
 war and to deepen our military commit-
 ment in Southeast Asia. Although the
 appropriations sought in this bill may
 not result in the dramatic escalation
 that has occurred in, thep ast, they will
 nonetheless be used to increase still
 further the killing and destruction that
 continues in Vietnam.
 Each year the costs of the war have
 been  underestimated  in  the  initial
 budget. This happened in 1965, 1966,
 1967, 1968, and now again in 1969. But
 each year the Congress has chosen to
 abdicate its responsibility to pass judg-
 ment on the war and has, instead, chan-
 neled more money into the quagmire in
 Southeast Asia.
 For 5 years now, the critics of the war
 in Vietnam have been urging that we
 pursue alternative policies In Southeast
 Asia. In 1964, I urged a specific strategy
 for the neutralization of Southeast Asia
 to avoid broadening the conflict. But the
 conflict was Broadened. In 1965, I argued
 against the Americanization of the war
 and against escalating our military com-
 mitment. But the war was Americanized
 and our commitment escalated. In 1966,
 I tried again to point to the policy alter-
 natives available to us. But the choice of
 continued escalation was made. In 1967,
 I called again for renewed diplomatic
 efforts and an end to the bombing in the
 north. But diplomacy was secondary to
 the continued attempt to impose a mili-
 tary solution.
 As I pointed out earlier in my remarks,
 the request for supplemental funds for
 Southeast Asian'military operations has
 been tied in to other appropriations for
 some vital domestic programs which I
 support and, in some cases, have even
 proposed.
 On January 30, I introduced an omrii-
 bus supplementary appropriation bill,
 HR, 5562, to fully fund several important
 programs established under the Housing
 and Urban Development Act of 1968.
 Later, I reintroduced this legislation with
 29 cosponsors-H.R. 7760, H.R. 7761. This
 legislation would provide supplementary
 appropriations to bring the section 235
 homeownership program, the section 236
 rental and cooperative housing program,
 the rent supplement program, the urban
 renewal program, and the urban renewal
 component of the model cities program
 to the full amount of funding authorized
 by Congress.'
 The bill before us today includes sup-
 plemental appropriations for three pro-
 grams-section 235, section 236, and low-
 rent public housing program. Both sec-
 tion 235 and section 236 would receive an
 additional $40 million for fiscal year
 1969-which still leaves each program
 $10 million less than the amount author-
 ized by Congress. The low-rent public
 housing program-which remains the
 only effective way to reach low-income
 people in our larger cities-would receive
 an additional $7,168,000 for fiscal year
 1968 and $16 million for fiscal year 1969
 in contract authorization.
 While I all} pleased that the Appropri-
 ations Committee has recommended sup-
 plementary appropriations to these three
 programs, I am disappointed that the bill
 does not provide additional funds for the
 rent supplement program, the urban re-
 newal program, or the urban renewal
 sector of the model cities program. Each
 year the rent supplement program has
 been starved for funds; the current fiscal
 year is no exception. While the adminis-
 tration recommended $65 million for rent
 supplements for fiscal year 1969, Con-
 gress appropriated only $30 million. Sim-
 ilarly, urban renewal in model cities, al-
 though it was authorized to receive $500
 million,  has  appropriated  only  $312
 million.
 These programs must be funded to the
 full amount authorized by Congress if
 we are to mount an effective attack on
 the crisis in urban homing which con-
 fronts this Nation. As has been the case
 so often before, the appropriations pro-
 vided                                                 for  Southeast  Asian  military
 operations in H.R.  11400  alone are
 greater than the amount which would
 be required to fully fund these vital
 housing programs.
 I am also disturbed that a request from
 the Department of Housing and Urban
 Development for an additional $2 mil-
 lion to carry out f.,.ir housing activities
 under title VIII of the Civil Rights Act
 of 1968 was denied by the committee.
 As Housing and Urban Development Sec-
 retary Romney stated in his testimony
 in support of this approoriation:
 "It is simply impossible to attain this goal
 (providing a decent home in a suitable liv-
 ing environment for every American family)
 without a major and -continuing effort in.
 pursuit of fair housing for every person in
 this country."  (Pareentbesis added)  (Hear-
 ings on Second Supplemental Appropriation
 Bill, 1969, p. 570.)
 At present, the fair housing program
 has received only Y.2 million to carry on
 that effort from. Congress. If fair hous-
 ing is to be guaranteed in this country,
 we must allocate more resources to pur-
 suing that goal.
 No doubt the ar,-,ument will be made
 that, since the pending bill contains
 funds for several av:encies which require
 supplemental allocation:: for their oper-
 ations, as well as for programs, such as
 section 235 and section 236, it should be
 supported despite the title I appropria-
 tion for the war. I can not accept that
 argument, which ignore., two basic fac-
 tors.
 First, if the House refused to approve
 this bill as long as it contained war ap-
 propriations funds earmarked for mili-
 tary operations in Vietnam would be re-
 moved; and the or -ter parts of the bill
 would come back to the floor.
 Second, and mc)?-e basic, it must be
 recognized that vital domestic programs
 will not be funded adequately until the
 bloody and costly war in Vietnam is end-
 ed. So long as appropriations bills con-
 tinue to allocate one-third of our avail-
 able resources to Southeast Asian mili-
 tary operations--as this one does-our
 cities will continue to rot, and the social
 fabric of our Nation will continue to be
 ripped apart. We ,will never mount the
 concentrated attack on the multitude of
 domestic problems facing us-including
 housing, education, discrimination, and
 H 3851
 pollution-so long as these programs re-
 ceive only leftover scale allocations. The
 solution of our domestic crisis, in other
 words, must be preceded by an end to the
 war in Vietnam.
 For 5 years the Congress has acqui-
 esced in a disastrous policy. Some 35,000
 American servicemen have been killed,
 and many more wounded and crippled.
 The country which we supposedly set out
 to save today lies in chaos and ruin. For
 5 long years the resources of this country
 have been poured into an ill-conceived
 war, only to see our policyrnakers return
 the next year with requests for still more
 funds.
 How long will this war go on? An-
 other year? Another 2 years? Another
 3 years?
 If we are truly concerned with the con-
 tinuation of this war-after it was
 thoroughly and roundly repudiated in
 the elections of last year; if we are con-
 cerned that after 1 year of negotia-
 tions in Paris we have not achieved
 peace; if we are truly desirous of termi-
 nating the death and distruction which
 continue to be wreaked on a small and
 unhappy nation-then let us now call a
 halt to this war through the only power
 the House possesses: the power of the
 purse.
 Mr. MAHON. Mr. Chairman, I should
 like to state to the Members of the House
 that it is the purpose of the committee
 to have read the first paragraph of the
 bill, which deals with "Military person-
 nel, Army," lines 6 and 7 on page 2, and
 then I expect to move that the commit-
 tee rise. Of course, amendments will be
 in order, but I expect to be recognized
 by the chairman to move that the com-
 mittee rise, and then the amendment
 period would come tomorrow.
 I should like to say further that it
 is proposed on tomorrow before we begin
 further consideration of the bill, that
 the Rules Committee will offer a rule
 which will make in order the expendi-
 ture limitation, which is carried in title
 IV of the bill.
 So, if the rule is adopted-and, of
 course, we hope it will be adopted-we
 will proceed with the reading of the bill
 under the 5-minute rule.
 Mr. GROSS. Mr. Chairman, will the
 gentleman yield?
 Mr. MAHON. I yield to the gentleman
 from Iowa.
 Mr. GROSS. The language that you
 would have read this afternoon, do I
 understand, goes to line 7 on page 2?
 Mr. MAHON. Yes. It would end at
 the figure $110 million in line 7 on page 2.
 Mr. GROSS. That includes no lan-
 guage, then, that is subject to a point
 of order?
 Mr. MAHON. No.
 Mr. GROSS. The rule
 waive points of order.
 Mr. MAHON. The rule is designed to
 protect against points of order only in
 title IV, which relates to the expenditure
 limitation. It will not protect any other
 part of the bill than the expenditure
 limitation.

 tleman from Texas has expired. All time

 SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR
 AVI'EMPTING  TO  COVER  UP
 FUENTES AFFAIR
 (Mr. PATMAN asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his remarks
 and '. nclude extraneous matter.)
 Mr.  PATMAN.  Mr.  Speaker,  on
 April 26, Mr. Hilary Sandoval, Jr., the
 Administrator of the Small Business
 Administration,  appeared before the
 Banking and Currency Committee to dis-
 cuss an SBA loan to a New York com-
 pany with alleged underworld ties.
 Shortly before the hearing, I received
 a te:egram from the Honorable HENRY
 B. GONZALEZ, a dis.inguished member of
 the committee, concerning "an alleged
 shakedown" of a small business loan ap-
 plicant by Mr. Albert Fuentes, special
 assii tart to Mr. Sandoval.
 The telegram follows:

 downs of SBA loan recipients. I have re-
 quested  the  administrator  to  suspend
 Fuentes pending full investigation and re-
 quest that you join In this action. I request
 that the committee under your able leader-
 ship investigate all loans either made or
 pending in Texas offices of SBA since Fuentes
 entered his position and that investigation
 be made particularly in the San Antonio area.
 Sincerely,
 HENRY B. GONZALEZ.
 Member of Congress.
 When Mr. Sandoval appeared before
 the committee, I asked him to look into
 the Fuentes situation and to report his
 finding to the committee. Mr. Sandoval
 agreed to this request: The transcript of
 the hearing clearly spells out what in-
 formation Mr. Sandoval was to provide.
 The transcript states:
 The CHAIRMAN. Now I will ask you to take
 this telegram and give me a report on Mr.
 Fuentes. You can do that, I assume?
 Mr. SANDOVAL. Yes, air.    _
 The CHAIRMAN. And also to give me all the
 information about the loans in the San
 Antonio area.
 Mr. SANDOVAL. Yes, air.
 The CHAmsAN. And if any of them pro-
 voke your thinking along the lines as not
 being regular. call them to our attention,
 Mr. SANDOVAL. Yes, W.
 Following Mr. Sandoval's appearance,
 I learned that SBA investigators had vis-
 ited the San Antonio SBA office and
 looked into the Fuentes situation. After
 allowing a reasonable length of time for
 the investigators' report to be forwarded
 to Washington, I wrote to Mr. Sandoval
 on May 12. The letter asks Mr. Sandoval
 not only to provide the Fuentes report
 but also to furnish the committee with a
 document that is extremely important to
 the committee's investigation of the New
 York loan to the alleged criminal con-
 trolled company. The letter follows:
 MAY 12, 1969.
 Mr. Hn.ARY SA inovAL, Jr.,
 Administrator, Small Business Administra-
 tion, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR MR.  SANDOVAL:  It has come to my
 attention that a memo dated January 6,
 1967, from Mr. William Bowling to then
 Small Business Administration Administra-
 tor. Bernard Boutin, contains a great deal
 of background Information concerning SBA's
 involvement with A.N.R. Leasing Corpora-
 tion. This memo is of vital importance to
 the Committee's examination of the A.N.R.
 loans and because of this, it is imperative
 that the Committee be given a copy of the
 complete memo immediately.
 It Is my understanding that there may be
 a problem In releasing the memo in that it
 contains FBI and Justice Department in-
 formation. In this regard, it would be ap-
 preciated If you would take action to secure
 the release of the memo from the Justice
 Department and immediately forward It to
 the Committee.
 In addition, you will remember that dur-
 ing your appearance before the Committee
 on April 26th, I asked you to make a com-
 plete investigation of  the  charges made
 against Mr. Albert Fuentes. While I realize
 you have turned the matter over to the FBI,
 It is my understanding that SBA Investi-
 gators have been looking into Mr. Fuentes'
 relationship with the San Antonio office. Be-
 cause of the importance of this matter, it
 would be appreciated if you would Immedi-
 ately Inform the Committee as to the re-
 sults of your Investigation of this incident
 and also If any other loans involving alleged
 improper action on the part of Mr. Fuentes
 have been uncovered. Your earliest reply
 would be appreciated.
 Sincerely,
 WRIGHT  PATMAN,
 Chairman.
 It is quite clear from even a most
 casual reading of the letter that two dif-
 ferent subjects are covered in the letter.
 The staff of the Banking and Currency
 Committee had been informed by SBA
 officials that the memo from Mr. Bowling
 to Mr. Boutin contained information
 from the FBI and Justice Department
 and that permission would have to be
 obtained from these departments to re-
 lease the memo. Because of this, my let-
 ter specifically asked Sandoval to take
 zction to secure release of the memo to
 the committee because of its important
 nature to our investigation.
 The last paragraph of the letter deals
 solely with Mr. Sandoval's promise to
 supply the committee with the report on
 the Fuentes case.
 It does not suggest that the Fuentes
 report, promised the committee by Mr.
 Sandoval, should be turned over to the
 Justice Department, nor does the letter
 make any reference to the Justice De-
 partment in connection with the Fuentes
 case.
 After the letter was sent to Mr. San-
 doval, a member of the Banking and
 Currency Committee staff called SBA to
 find out when the- Fuentes report would
 be made available. He was assured that
 the report would be In the committee
 office the following morning, along with
 some other material that the committee
 had requested. The following morning,
 SBA did send information concerning
 its lending activities in cases under study
 by the committee, but did not send the
 Fuentes report. The SBA official who
 brought the material to the committee
 stated that he did not have a copy of the
 Fuentes report but that he would call
 back to his office and make certain that
 the report was placed on his desk and
 that he would personally hand deliver the
 report that afternoon. Later in the day,
 still another SBA official reported to the
 committee staff that the committee
 would not be able to get a copy of the
 report that afternoon because, "I do not
 know where a copy of the report is and
 even if I did, I do not have authority
 to release it."
 He said that Mr. Sandoval was out of
 town and could not be reached. The fol-
 lowing day, several members of the
 Banking and Currency Committee staff
 attempted to obtain copies of the report
 but were unsuccessful. The reason given
 at that time for the report not being
 made available was that Mr. Sandoval
 was out of town and the report could
 not be released without his approval.
 When the committee staff attempted to
 locate Mr. Sandoval they were told by
 his office that-
 He is in New York but I don't know where
 to get in touch with him or exactly where
 he is,
 The following day, Mr. James Reed,
 congressional relations director for SBA,
 called the committee staff to state that
 the Fuentes report had been turned over
 to the Justice Department and would
 not be made available to the committee.
