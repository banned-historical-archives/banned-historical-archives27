THE EUROPEAN BORDERS OF THE USSR  
Introduction  
The boundaries of the Soviet Union are of particular interest to 
the intelligence community because of the manner in which they are 
sealed to ordinary international intercourse. It is necessary to go 
back in history to the mid-nineteenth century and the boundary between 
Korea and China to find a comparable attempt to seal off a,country 
from bordering peoples with similar cultures. 
In March 1946, Winston Churchill, speaking at Fulton, Missouri, 
Observed that from "Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, 
an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line 
lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern 
Europe..." Actually, the Soviet regime was suspicious of the outside 
world from its inception, near the end of World War I, and had erected 
an "iron curtain" along its own western frontiers in the interwar pe-
riod. The establishment of tight border security west of the'Soviet 
satellites after World War II was therefore merely an extension and 
elaboration of the already adopted Soviet policy of impermeable fron-
tiers. The present boundary of the USSR is in reality an iron curtain 
within the Iron Curtain. 
Three months after Churchill's Fulton address, John Foster Dulles 
propounded a theory that extended beyond Churchill's premise and en-
compassed the Far East. His thesis was that, for the purpose of 
achieving Soviet policy, the USSR had divided the world into three 
zones: (1) an Inner Zone, the USSR itself; (2) a Middle Zone, repre-
senting a belt or cordon sanitaire surrounding the Inner Zone; and (3) 
an Outer Zone, representing the rest of the world. The Soviet Inner 
Zone comprises the Soviet Union as originally established in 1917, 
together with adjacent territories subsequently incorporated. The 
Middle Zone, which cannot be regarded as fixed, consists of countries 
that have come under Soviet influence, with an increasing measure of 
control from Moscow. The central European part of the Middle Zone 
includes East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, eastern Austria, Hungary, 
Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, and (until 1948) Yugoslavia. In Asia the 
zone includes Outer Mongolia, Manchuria, North Korea, the Sinkiang 
Province of China, and probably the rest of Communist China; it is 
difficult, however, to predict the role that the Communist regime of 
? Mao Tse-tung will ultimately play within the Soviet sphere. The third 
or Outer Zone ? comprises the balance of the world.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The efforts of the Soviet Government to establish a security zone 
along the entire border of the USSR extend to nations along the south-
ern frontier. In both Turkey and Iran, however, fierce resistance to 
Soviet pressures has been encountered, and the usual pattern of Soviet 
penetration and domination has been successfully thwarted. As a re-
sult, areas of the Near and Middle East have not disappeared behind 
the Iron Curtain but have remained one of the major arenas of the 
struggle between East and West. 
The Soviet technique of creating and maintaining an "iron curtain" 
serves two purposes, one domestic and the other foreign. From the 
domestic standpoint, nonintercourse is intended to insure that "pure" 
political thinking in the USSR will not become tainted, and at the 
same time it helps to prevent the internal discontent that might arise 
if the people of the Soviet Union were able to compare their standard 
of living with that prevailing in other countries. The Soviet people 
are told that a broad security belt, or buffer zone, is a necessary 
defense measure against an unfriendly world. From the external stand-
point, Soviet propaganda is the more effective because actual condi-
tions within the USSR are a matter of conjecture. 
The great length of the Soviet frontier, the irregularities of 
terrain, and the heterogeneous population are a few of the complex 
factors with which the Soviet Government is faced in the effort to 
guard its borders. The northern and central European frontier areas 
are largely plains across which passage between the east and the West 
is comparatively easy. This accounts in part for the strict security 
measures employed by the Soviets and the fact that the European area 
is heavily guarded. The longest zone of Soviet influence lies in 
central and eastern Asia, reaching from the Pamir Mountains to Vladivos-
tok, a distance of about 4,000 miles. That portion of the boundary 
with its vast stretches of mountains and deserts is not as stringently 
controlled as the Western European borders. This indicates that the 
Soviet manpower is not distributed indiscriminately but according to 
the type of terrain, the border peoples, the political significance of 
the border area, and the existence of known trouble spots. It is also 
quite probable that the employment of variations in the methods of 
guarding the frontier is a deliberate practice on the part of Soviet 
authorities intended to deter penetration or escape. 
The present report deals specifically with theEuropean bound-
aries of the USSR, those With Norway, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary and Rumania. Only two of these countries are part of the 
free world, the others being Soviet satellites'. ? 
The attitude of the free governments in regard to the border dif-
fers greatly from that of the Communist countries. Although in a 
- la -

precarious geopolitical position, Finland, a non-satellite neighbor 
of the USSR, would consider it a restriction of individual liberty 
to prevent Finnish civilians from living in close proximity to the 
border. The Soviet Union, on the contrary, is meticulous in securing 
the inviolability of its own side of the boundary, and the Iron Cur-
tain countries conform to the same pattern, employing rigid restric-
tive measures within their border areas. In order to further safe-
guard the impenetrability of the frontier, Soviet border guards are 
carefully picked and highly disciplined. Recruits are also trained 
in the art of observation and collection of intelligence in the fron-
tier area. It is obvious that Soviet authorities do not consider the 
existence of Communist regimes as a sufficient security guarantee. 
Portions of the Soviet European boundaries were nominally drawn 
on ethnic principles. A considerable degree of ethnic homogeneity has 
been achieved in the satellites by postwar boundary changes and shifts 
in population. The Soviet Union and the satellite regimes have not 
used the principle of ethnic homogeneity within international bound-
aries as a means of reducing international or internal friction, but 
simply as a convenient tool to be applied or ignored, depending on 
which course best suited the purposes of the governments. Thus, 
partial ethnic uniformity was forced upon the new Poland by moving 
Poles westward from former eastern Poland when that region was taken 
over by Belorussia and the Ukraine, and by the expulsion of many 
Germans from the areas east of the Oder-Neisse Line. Germans were 
also expelled from their former homes in northern East Prussia when 
the area was taken by the RSFSR, but there does not seem to have been 
a corresponding attempt to secure a solidly Russian population there, 
for it is reported that peoples from Soviet Central Asia have been 
moved into the areas on the Soviet side of the new boundary. 
There is a sharp contrast between Soviet policy regarding peoples 
and Soviet policy regarding commerce along the boundaries. The western 
boundaries are sealed to the movement of people, but economic policy 
requires a maximum movement of goods among the satellites and the USSR. 
Measures employed by the Soviet Bloc countries to seal their 
frontiers consist of a combination of physical barriers, border guards 
and patrols, border-zone restrictions, and constant surveillance of 
internal movements of the population. The existence of this wide-
spread system of border controls is in itself a psychological deterrent 
to escape. Soviet citizens attempting to defect along the central 
European borders are faced with the additional problem of crossing 
satellite territory in order to find refuge in the West. Continued 
Soviet sensitivity and 'extreme security consciousness indicate that 
restrictive measures, rather than being relaxed, will be more rigidly 
enforced in the future.

In this study each boundary segment is discussed under four main 
headings: history; linear descriptions; boundary marking, administra-
tion, and security; and available maps. 
The section on history gives in each case the background of the 
present boundary withoutsttempting to present a full discussion of 
disputes and territorial transfers.. The documents forming the legal 
basis of the present boundary, are cited. Under linear description, 
each boundary sector, together with its immediate vicinity, is de-
scrfbed topographically  
 the descriptions 
of the boundaries of the Soviet Bloc countries are not as coMplete as 
those of the frontiers with Norway and Finland. The surveys and de-
marcation of each boundary, types of boundary markers used, provisions 
for regulating intercOurse across the line, barbed-wire entanglements, 
watchtowers and other securitystructures, and personnel engaged-in 
boundary administration and security are discussed. Examples of 
security structures and measures typical of the boundary area in 
general are presented; It is not possible, however, to give a com-
plete and detailed picture of boundary Security measures and personnel, 
 because these factors are subject to almost constant change, 
The naps that accompany the report are mostly at small scales and

I. Norway-USSR Border  
A. History of the Boundary 
. The boundary between Norway and the USSR has retained its pre-
sent alignment with only minor changes since 1826 (see accompanying 
map 11738). 2/* In that year, in an effort to prevent difficulties 
in the Foelleds Districter (districts held in common by Sweden, 
Norway, and Russia), the King of Sweden and Norway and the Emperor 
of All the Russias agreed to a demarcation of the line of sovereignty 
in the boundary area. The agreement was included in the "Convention 
of Limits Between Russia and Sweden," 2-14 May 1826, signed at St. 
Petersburg. 2/ This division of the area by Norway and Russia 
precluded Finnish access to the Arctic Ocean; The problem thus intro-
duced was to exert great influence and to cause several changes in 
Norway's neighbors along the boundary. 
The line established in 1826 was the boundary between Norway and 
Russia until 1920 and between Norway and Finland from 1920 to 1944. 
This boundary was described ganerally as following the Pasvikelv 
gats-lbki7** and Jakobselv Pror'yema7 Rivers, with several long, 
straight, connecting land sectors. The actual 1826 marking of the 
line consisted of only 10 markers or stone cairns, most of them set 
at the main breakpoints. Krokfjell (Muotkavaara) Mountain was 
established in 1833 as the meeting point of the territories of the 
USSR, Norway, and Finland by representatives of Russia proper and 
the Grand Duchy of Finland, but the marker was not erected there 
until after the 1846 Norwegian-Russian survey of the boundary. 
After Finland became a neighbor of Norway in 1920, the two 
countries opened talks concerning the boundary in the Finnmark-Petsamb 
ffechenga7 area. An agreement was reached on 28 April 1924 that 
superseded the 1826 agreement concerning the boundary between Finnmark

Province (fylke) of Norway and Petsamo District (herred) of Fin-
land. 3/ Although it made no basic changes in the boundary de-
scription, the 1924 agreement contained a clause calling for the 
establishment of the line in the territorial sea north of the mouth 
of the Jakobselv. During the negotiations, however, the Norwegians 
proposed two modifications of the 1826 line, both to no avail. First, 
they wished to apply the thalweg principle to the Pasvikelv River 
near Ostrov Chevessuolo (island) and Ostrov Niva-saari; second, 
they proposed that the line leave the Pasvikelv in an easterly di-
rection in the vicinity of Ozero.Kuets-yarvi (lake) and continue to 
the Jakobselv, instead of following the river to a point north of 
Kolttakengyas (formerly the Boris Gleb area)* and then taking a 
southeasterly course to the Jakobselv. The second proposal had 
been rejected in the negotiations preceding the 1826 agreement, 
which not only established the boundary farther north but also pro-
vided for the cession by Norway to Russia of a small area around 
the Russian Church of Boris Gleb on the west bank of the Pasvikelv. 
In the 1922-24 Finnish-Norwegian negotiations, the Finns rejected the 
proposal for a change on the ground that Norway could offer no terri-
torial compensation. 
In 1925, Norway and Finland conducted a survey of the bound-
ary. 4/ So that there would be no doubt as to the course of the 
line in the Boris Gleb area, a boundary road was built and additional 
markers were erected. The Pasvikelv sector of the boundary was to 
follow the line in the river that had been established previously 
by the Norwegians and Russians. Special signs were placed on river 
islands to designate the country to which they belonged. 
A supplementary protocol to clarify the position of the boundary 
in the mouth of the Jakobselv was signed on 12 September 1931 (see 
accompanying map 12104). This protocol established 11 points through 
which the line was to be drawn and also provided that vessels of both 
countries could freely lie and anchor on either side of the boundary. 
The line provided for in the protocol of 1931 was finally marked in 
1939, using a series of 20 sight markers placed on the land in such 
a manner that the sight lines .intersected at the 11 points along the 
boundary line. 
The name "Kolttakengyas" is the present Russian version of 
"Kolttakongas," the name given to the town by the Lapps who settled 
the area. In the 16th century a Russian Orthodox church was built 
at the site of the present town of Kolttakengyas and dedicated to 
two 8th-century Russian princes, Boris and Gleb.

In August 1946, representatives of Norway and the Soviet Union 
met and established the Joint Soviet-Norwegian Commission for the 
Marking of the International Boundary Between the USSR and Norway. 
Its basic task was to establish the international boundary in accord-
ance with the old Norwegian-Russian line. The discussions of the 
Joint Commission had the following results: (1) the line in the 
mouth of the Jakobselv was to follow the thalweg as determined at 
low tide, in accordance with the recommendation of the Norwegians; 
2) the USSR was to give up demands for a change at Grensefoss 
Graensefoss) Falls where Norway controls both banks of the Pasvikelv 
(marker No. 11); and (3) Norway would transfer the three small islands 
in the Pasvikelv to the USSR. 
Only preliminary discussions were held on the problem of the 
territorial sea north of the mouth of the Jakobselv. Since the 
viewpoints and claims of the two countries to territorial waters 
differed radically, the Norwegians claiming 4 nautical miles and 
the Soviets 12, the Joint Commission decided to keep this question 
open for future diplomatic negotiations. 
At the conclusion of the marking of the Soviet-Finnish boundary 
in 1945, it was agreed to place a three-nation boundary marker at 
Krokfjell. A Norwegian representative was present to approve the 
position of the marker, and a tri-state protocol was signed on 26 
October 1945. After the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area was ceded to 
the Soviet Union by Finland in 1947, a new demarcation of the 
northernmost sector of the Finnish-Soviet boundary, just south of 
Krokfjell, was undertaken. In the summer of 1947 a Norwegian repre-
sentative inspected the marker, and on 3 December 1947 a new tri-
state protocol regarding the marker on Krokfjell, replacing the 
1945 protocol, was signed. 
During the summer of 1947, two mixed Norwegian-Soviet sub-
commissions (under the Joint Commission) marked the boundary.- One 
subcommission was supervised by the USSR, the other by Norway. The 
Soviet-supervised subcommission marked the first section of the 
1 boundary, from the junction at Krokfjell northward 61.1 miles to 
69?32'N, north of Holmfossen. The Norwegian-supervised subcommission 
marked the second section, from 69032'N northward 60.5 miles to 
mRrker No. 415, a buoy stake north of the mouth of the Jakobselv. 
Each subcommission was responsible for placing, painting, and number-
ing the markers along its section of the boundary. A topographic 
survey of a strip at least 0.5 kilometer (about 0.3 mile) wide 
along each side of the boundary was made at the scale of 1:25,000, 
and &polygon system was laid on which the rectangular coordinates 
of the boundary markers were computed.

On 18 December 1947, with the final drafting and reviewing of 
the boundary documents, the boundary agreement, together with the 
maps and protocols,* was signed in Moscow. 5, 6, 7/ The Norwegian 
Stortine ratified the agreement unanimously on 3 December 1948, and 
the instruments of ratification were exchanged on 23 May 1949 in 
Moscow. 8/ Before ratifying the agreement, the Norwegian Storting 
questioned the cession to the USSR of the three small islands in the 
Pasvikelv. The issue was dismissed, however, because the islands 
were regarded as being of no strategic or economic value, and it was 
agreed that under the terms of the 1826 convention the islands fell 
on the Soviet side of the line. The course of the boundary as marked 
in the mouth of the Jakobselv proved satisfactory to the Norwegians, 
since it permitted their fishing vessels to enter and leave the river 
without crossing the line. 9, 10/ The demarcation maps show the 
boundary along the, channel of the river at low tide, which was the 
line held by the Norwegians during the dispute with the Finns over 
the issue following the 1925 investigation of the boundary. 
B. :Linear Description of the Boundary** 
Only about one-fifth of the 121.6-mile-long Norwegian-USSR 
boundary is on.land. The course of the remainder of the line is 
determined mainly by the deepest channels of the Pasvikelv (Figure 1) 
and Jakobselv and their associated lakes. (Figures 2 and 3,) 
The westernmost point of the border is at.Krokfjell Mountain, 
where the boundaries of Norway, Finland, and the USSR meet (see map 
11738). From Krokfjell the boundary follows a southeasterly direction 
in a series of short, straight-line sectors through somewhat hilly, 
partly marshy terrain to the Pasvikelv, which it crosses to marker 
No. 11 near Grensefoss, a main breakpoint in the boundary. At that 
market the entire river lies within Norway. From marker No. 11, 
the line takes a.northeasterly direction, at first for 70 meters 
(229.66.feet), then down the steep slope of the Gelsomio Promontory 
and over to the Pasvikelv. It continues along the mountain lake . 
Grensevatn (Grensevann) to marker No. 12, leaving Aittasaari (island) 
on the Soviet side. The Norwegian post stands on the east side of 
The descriptive protocol includes: (1) a table of coordinates 
and elevations of the boundary markers and the points in the geodetic 
network along the boundary and (2) a list of the boundary markers.

Grenseneset Point on a hillock 165.1 meters (541.65 feet) from the 
boundary. The Soviet post is on the northwestern point of Aitta-
saari, 6 meters (19.68 feet) from a steep slope and 115 meters 
(377.29 feet) from the boundary.* 
From marker No. 12 the boundary follows Grensevatn in a north-
easterly direction to marker No. 14, leaving an islet having a 
boundary post on the Soviet side and Balgisholmen (island) on the . 
Norwegian side. The boundary then extends in a north-northeasterly 
direction along the lake, with Bgrkholmen on the northern side. 
From this point the boundary continues in the same direction from 
Grensevatn (marker No. 16) out into the Pasvikelv (marker No. 
17), and then follows the channel of the Pasvikelv for approximately 
3.7 kilometers (about 2.3 miles) to marker No. 24, situated on a 
small wooded island on the Norwegian side. The boundary continues 
in a general north-northeasterly direction to marker No. 28, located 
on the northernmost islet of a group of three on the Soviet side; 
the Norwegian post stands on the east slope of a hillock, north of 
the mouth of Gjeddebekken Creek. From marker No. 28 the boundary 
extends along the channel chiefly in a northeasterly direction, 
passing wooded isles and rocks on the Norwegian side, to marker No. 
30. At this point the boundary resumes a north-northeasterly - 
course through Tangefoss, then turns toward the northeast past five 
small islands -- two on the Norwegian and three on the Soviet side --
to marker No. 31. 
The boundary passes from marker No. 31 along the channel of 
the Pasvikelv, first in a northeasterly direction past three isles 
on the Soviet side, and then in a north-northeasterly direction to 
marker No. 32, situated on a wooded island on the Soviet side. 
Maintaining the same course, the boundary goes past a group of 
reefs or sandbanks on the Norwegian side to marker No. 33, at which 
point it extends in a curved line toward the north-northwest, past 
a Soviet reef, and then toward the north-northeast, past a Norwegian 
reef, to marker No. 34. From there the boundary follows the channel 
to the northeast past two islands (Norwegian) to marker No. 35, then 
makes an arc, turning north to marker No. 36. The Norwegian post 
stands on the left riverbank, directly opposite the mouth of the 
Kornetijoki, 63.4 meters (208 feet) from the border; the Soviet 
post is on the right riverbank, on the south side of the mouth of 
the Kornetijoki, 100 meters (328 feet) from the border. The boundary

feet) southwest of a railroad track. 
The boundary continues in a general north-northeasterly direction 
to marker No. 40, bending along the river to Hestefoss, then along 
the falls to marker No. 41. From marker No. 41 the boundary turns 
with the channel for about 3.3 kilometers (approximately 2 miles)) 
passing numerous isles (Skiltholmen on the USSR side and Bgrnholmen 
and Sauholmen on the Norwegian side), to marker No. 46 on the right

(Pechenga; NR 35,36-8: 58-762)* connecting Norwegian Highway 955 with 
the Arctic Highway on the Soviet side. From marker No. 46 the bound-
ary goes in a general northeasterly direction to marker No. 48, pass-
ing a number of isles and islands, and then turns toward the north-
west between Tjernholmen and Rittasaari to marker No. 49. North of 
Kisteholmen, at marker No. 50, the boundary takes an east-
northeasterly course along Lake Fjaervatn (HoyhenjErvi), passing an 
island (Jakolan-Lammasaari) on the Soviet side and a sandbank on the 
Norwegian side, to marker No. 51. The boundary continues along 
Fjaervatn for approximately 4.6 kilometers (about 2.9 miles) to mark-
er No. 58, at which point it turns along the lake toward the north, 
past a Norwegian reef, and then follows the channel in the Pasvikelv 
toward the northeast to Jordanfoss (marker No. 59). 
The boundary bends with the channel in the Pasvikelv past sever-
al reefs and isles before turning into Lake Vaggatem (Vaggetemjavrre) 
to marker No. 62. The Norwegian post stands on the western shore of 
the lake, 175 meters (574.14 feet) northwest of a narrow-gauge rail-
road track. The Soviet post stands on a promontory on the eastern 
shore of the lake, 85 meters (278.87 feet) north-northwest of the 
mouth of an unnamed creek. From marker No. 62 the boundary goes in a

meters (377.29 feet) southeast of Nesheim and 261.8 meters (858.92 
feet) from the border. From here the boundary bends along the lake 
in an arc for about 2.6 kilometers (approximately 1.6 miles) to 
marker No. 68, leaving Gravholmen on the Norwegian side and Skolte-
holmen ITStrov Chevessuold7 on the Soviet side. From this point to 
marker No. 78 the boundary extends in a general northerly direction 
past a number of isles -- Vaerholmen, Lavholmen, and Bgrnholmen 
on the Norwegian side and Krokholmen and Brannholmen on the Soviet 
side. In this sector the Skogly Farmstead is located on the Norwegian 
side southwest of marker No. 71. From marker No. 78 the boundary 
passes along Lake Vaggatem in an east-northeasterly direction to 
marker No. 80, at which point it continues along the Pasvikelv, then 
through the Vaggatemstryket (rapids) and an old riverbed (the Stein 
Rapids) to marker No. 85. In this stretch of the border, an isle, 
Brennholmen, is situated on the Soviet side. 
The boundary passes from marker No. 85 along the old riverbed 
toward the northeast, first over a dry section, then over a deep 
pool, and past a Norwegian isle to marker No. .86; the Soviet post , 
stands on the northwest side of Nivasaari, 23 meters (75.45 feet) 
from the border. From here the boundary follows an east-northeasterly 
course to marker No. 88, turns in a southeasterly direction along the 
channel of the Pasvikelv, and then passes through the Vakkerstryket 
Rapids to marker No. 90. From this point the boundary curves in an 
east-northeasterly direction out over Kattolampolo (lake) to marker 
No. 93, leaving the isle of Grasholmen on the Norwegian side. Con-
tinuing in the same direction for approximately 2.1 kilometers (about 
1.3 miles) the boundary extends to marker No. 97, with Sauholmen 
situated on the Norwegian side, then turns along the channel of the 
Pasvikelv.in a northeast-southeast arc to marker No. 98. The 
Norwegian post stands on the left side of the river, on the south-
western part of a promontory 225 meters (738.18 feet) south-
southeast of the end of'a narrow-gauge railroad track, and 54.6 
meters (179.13 feet) from the border. From marker No. 98 the 
boundary passes toward the east and northeast through Kobbfoss to 
marker No. 99, then arches toward the south-southeast along Lake 
Langvatn (lossojavrre) to marker No. 100. From here the boundary 
continues south-southeastward to marker No. 102, where it makes a 
bend in an east-southeasterly direction to marker No. 103. The 
boundary curves slightly along the lake in an east-northeasterly 
direction from marker No. 103 to No. 104, leaving Aittasaari on the 
Soviet side and Hareholmen on the Norwegian side. Maintaining a 
northeasterly direction for approximately 7.1 kilometers (about )4.4 
miles), the boundary extends to marker No. 118. In this sector 
Kaurinkisaari is on the Soviet side and Langnes (peninsula) and 
Frigard and Ilyng Farmsteads are on the Norwegian side.

From marker No. 118 the boundary passes along the lake in an 
arc toward the north-northeast, with Niskasaari on the Soviet side, 
to boundary marker No. 119. The Norwegian post stands on the left 
shore of the Pasvikelv on the point of a small promontory 65.1 meters 
(213.58 feet) from the border. Continuing in a north-northeasterly 
direction, the boundary extends from Langvatn out over the Pasvikelv, 
following the channel through the Skogfoss (Hakokoski) (Figure 4) 
to marker No. 122, leaving an isle and reefs on the Norwegian side 
and five isles and reefs on the Soviet side. The Norwegian post 
stands on the left shore of the rapids, 80 meters (262.46 feet) 
south of the northern end of a narrow-gauge railroad track, and 71.6 
meters (234.9 feet) frOm the border. The boundary passes from marker 
No. 122 along Skogvatn in a line curving first northeast then north-
northwest, with sandbanks on the Norwegian side, to marker No. 123. 
The Norwegian post stands on the western shore of the lake, 30 meters 
98.42 feet) south of the nearest house on Bgrklund, 400.1 meters 
1,312.6 feet) from the border. The Soviet post stands on the eastern 
shore of the lake, on the southwestern side of Harrnes Point, 65 
meters (213.25 feet) from the border. From marker No. 123 the bound-
ary extends along the lake close to the western end of Harrnes, then 
toward the north-northwest past Grasholmen and a smaller islet south 
of it on the Soviet side, to marker No. 124. Here it passes through 
a narrow strait with a strong current at the LillestrOmmen, describing 
an arc toward the northeast, to marker No. 125. In a winding but 
generally east-northeasterly course along the lake, with two small 
isles and Gravholmen on the Soviet side, the boundary extends to 
marker No. 129, leaving Fuglebukta (bay) and Grasholmen on the 
Norwegian side. The Norwegian post stands on the northwestern shore 
of the lake, 80 meters (262.46 feet) west-northwest of the south end 
of a narrow-gauge railroad track and 60.2 meters (197.5 feet) from 
the border. The Soviet post stands on the southeastern shore of the 
lake, at the northwestern end of Koskennis-Kanniemi Cape, 16 meters 
(52.49 feet) from the shore and 125 meters (410 feet) from the border. 
From marker No. 129 the boundary passes first along the channel 
toward the southeast and then along Melkefoss (Maitokoski) in a 
general northeasterly direction for about 4.7 kilometers (approxi-
mately 2.9 miles) to marker No. 136. In this sector, Norwegian post 
No. 133 stands 50 meters (16)-i- feet) northeast of a dwelling house 
at Mikkelstad. Huhmunsaari Island (marker No. 134) is on the Soviet 
side of the border. 
From marker No. 136 the boundary follows a general southeasterly. 
direction to marker No. 140, then extends along the channel of the

of Barnsund, 61 meters (200.13 feet) northeast of the southernmost 
dwelling house on Utnes. Norwegian post No. 151 stands on the 
northwestern shore of the sound, on Langnes (point) 318.4 meters 
(1,044 feet) from the border. In this same area, Soviet post No. 
147 stands on the southeastern shore of Lake Svanvatn, 215 meters 
(705.38 feet) west of the fork on the Petsjenga gechenga7--
Rovaniemi road (Arctic Highway). 
From marker No. 152 the boundary follows the sound in a north-
northeasterly direction for a few kilometers to marker No. 156, 
leaving an islet south of Furumo on the Norwegian side. From marker 
No. 156 the boundary turns in an arc toward the northeast and north-
northwest along the BOrnsund to marker No. 158. From here the 
boundary extends along the channel of the Trongsund.in a general 
northerly direction to marker No. 164 -- a distance of approximately 
2.5 kilometers (about 1.6 miles). Norwegian post No. 164 stands on 
the western shore of the sound, on the east side of a promontory, 
65 meters (213.25 feet) northeast of the Trongsundneset Farm. 
The boundary runs from marker No. 164 along the channel of the 
Trongsund, then across Bjornvatn (Kontiojgrvi) in a general northerly 
direction to marker No. 167. The Norwegian post stands on a 
promontory on the western shore of the lake, 32 meters (104.98 
feet) northeast of the road between Kirkenes and Svanvik. From 
marker No. 167 the boundary passes along the lake in a curved line 
in a north-northeasterly direction and then to marker No. 169, a 
cairn set up on the southern point of Store Grenseholmen in 1896 and 
restored in 1947. The boundary then proceeds along a border road 
toward the north-northeast via Store Grenseholmen to marker No. 172, 
where it continues in a northeasterly direction along the channel of 
the Pasvikelv between Litleholmen on the Norwegian side and an un-
named isle on the Soviet side, to marker No. 173. The Norwegian post 
stands on the left river bank on the Kirkenes-Holmfoss road, near a 
destroyed bridge, 108.4 meters (355.64 feet) from the border. The 
Soviet post stands .on a promontory, on the right riverbank 15 meters 
(49.21 feet) west of the Holmfoss-Ahmalahti road and 150 meters 
(492.12 feet) from the border.

From marker No. 173 the boundary bends along the middle of the 
river in an east-southeasterly direction, then turns in a north-
easterly direction past two small islands (one on each side of the 
border) to marker No. 174. The Norwegian post stands on the south 
point of Floytarneset Cape, 135.5 meters (444.55 feet) from the 
border. Nordmo Farm is located to the northwest of marker No. 174. 
Continuing in a north-northeasterly direction, the boundary extends 
along Klistervatn to marker No. 176, leaving Skolteholmen on the 
Norwegian side. From here the boundary winds along the lake, first 
toward the northeast then toward the north and northwest, to marker 
No. 178. The Norwegian post is situated on the top of wooded 
Ellenholmen Island, 390 meters (1,279.5 feet) from the border. 
From marker No. 178 the boundary winds along the lake in a north-
northeasterly direction to marker No. 181, then turns in a north-
northwesterly direction to marker No. 182. In this sector, 
Norwegian post No. 179 stands on the western shore of the lake, on 
the southern part of Fjellfrossneset Point, 320 meters (1,049.86 
feet) from the border, and the Soviet post stands on a steep 
mountain slope on the eastern shore of the lake, 160 meters 
(524.93 feet) west of the Storskog-Ahmalahti road. From marker 
No. 182, the boundary passes along the lake, first in a north-
northwesterly direction and then bending toward the north-northeast, 
to marker No. 183, where it curves again in a general northwesterly 
direction., which it maintains for about 2.8 kilometers (approxi-
mately 1.7 miles) to the northern end of the lake (marker No. 187). 
In this area Iso Palossari Liistrov Iso Palosar17 is on the Soviet 
side. 
From marker No. 187 the boundary continues along the Pasvikelv 
in a north-northwesterly direction toward Harefossen, then along 
the middle of the falls to marker No. 189. The Soviet post stands on 
the right bank of the falls, on a mountain ridge to the north, 50 
meters (164 feet) west of a narrow-gauge railroad. From marker No. 
189 the boundary follows the middle of the river rapids (below 
Harefossen) along a northwesterly course to marker No. 190, then 
turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 191. The Soviet 
post stands on a wooded gravel hill on the right riverbank, 30 
meters (98.42 feet) west of the Skoltefossen-Ahmalahti road. 
From this point the boundary trends generally northward, first along 
the middle of the rapids in the Pasvikelv, then along Fossevatn, past 
two islands on the Soviet side and one on the Norwegian side, to 
Boddiholmen (marker No. 192). The boundary then extends along the 
middle of the lake in a general north-northwesterly direction to ? 
marker No. 196 at Skoltefossen, where it leaves the Pasvikelv 
(a breakpoint)-.

In the Pasvikelv, the boundary follows the deep channel and, 
for the most part, it also follows the middle of the lakes. Except 
for Skolteholmen fistrov Chevessuol2 and Nivasaari fistrov Niva-
saari7, the islands in the river and lakes are allocated to the 
country on whose side of the channel they lie. Only a few islands 
or sandbanks are crossed by the boundary, the only one of signifi-
cant size being Store Grenseholmen LOstrov Sture Grense-kholmen7, 
on which markers Nos. 169-171 are located. 
After leaving the Pasvikelv, the boundary proceeds in a straight 
line to the west for about 1.8 kilometers (about 1.1 miles) to marker 
No. 208 (a breakpoint). In this sector the boundary traverses a 
barren mountain, crosses a path, a marsh, a winter road, and Lake 
Georgsvatn (Jokonjgrvi). From marker No. 208 the boundary turns in 
a north-northwesterly direction, first down the barren slope of 
Georgvasstoppen, and then over rolling terrain west of Eski3jgrvi 
to marker No. 209. The boundary continues in the same direction over 
a barren, rounded mountain to marker No. 211, situated on top of 
Grensefjell (a breakpoint), where it turns in an east-northeasterly 
direction to marker No. 212, located on a barren mountain on the 
northwestern slope of Karhunpgg. From here the boundary follows 
an east-northeasterly course to marker No. 216, which stands at 
the west side of the Kirkenes-Kolttakengyas (Boris Gleb) road, 
then crosses the Pasvikelv to marker No. 219 on the right bank of 
the river. This sector of the boundary encircles the town of 
Kolttakengyas and leaves an area of more than 1.5 square miles on 
the west bank of the Pasvikelv under Soviet control. The Soviet 
Union also has complete control of the river for approximately 2 
miles. 
From marker No. 219 the boundary continues in,a straight line 
in an east-northeasterly direction across increasingly rough ter-
rain to marker No. 222 on Russefjell Mountain (a breakpoint), where 
It turns to the southeast. The boundary extends in that direction 
for about 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) to marker No. 226, located on the 
western shore of the northwestern inlet of Lake Pikevatn (Neitijgrvi). 
From there it crosses the lake to marker No. 230, situated on the 
west side of the Storskog-Ahmalahti road, then continues in a 
southeasterly direction up a barren mountain slope to marker No. 233, 
a cairn erected at an earlier date and restored in 1947, on the top 
of Vardehaug (hill). From marker No. 233 the boundary turns slightly 
to the south-southeast and continues down the mountain slope in dense 
forest and marshland to marker No. 236, which stands on the western 
shore of Langvatn. The boundary maintains the same course for 
approximately 3.6 kilometers (about 2.2 miles) to marker No. 248. 
In this sector, marker No. 240 is located on the top of Storslgttfjell 
and No. 245 is on the northwestern slope of Vardefjell. The boundary

continues to follow a southeasterly course across rising terrain to 
marker No. 249, located on a small mountain knoll 140 meters (459.31 
feet) southeast of the southernmost end of Fiskevatn, then down 
a steep mountain slope and across a brook between Hamborgvatn and 
JoosepinjErvet to marker No. 251. Maintaining a southeasterly 
direction, the boundary extends along a border lane, across a de-
pression with a little brook, then up a very steep slope HUghaugen 
(markers Nos. 252 and 253), from which point it continues over 
slightly rising terrain, a barren mountain, and a marsh with sparse 
plant growth to marker No. 254. 
The boundary continues from marker No. 254 in the same direction 
over rising terrain for approximately 2.6 kilometers (about 1.6 
miles) to marker No. 264. In this area the border crosses Serdivatn 
(Siertijdrvi) and the slopes of Siertitunturi and Aborvassfjell. 
From here the boundary passes in a southeasterly direction to 
Grensevatn (Rajajdrvi), marker No. 268, crosses the lake, and 
continues to marker No. 274, which stands on the northeastern slope 
of Pieni Vohtastunturi. The boundary continues a southeasterly 
course to marker No. 278, then turns in a slightly more southerly 
direction to marker No. 279 just southwest of Hundvatn. Boundary 
marker No. 278 (a bairn erected in 1925 and restored in 1947) is 
located on the southwestern slope of Hundvasshaugan. In this entire 
sector -- from marker No. 219 to No. 279 -- the border crosses fairly 
rugged land, barren mountains, moors, marshes, and numerous small 
lakes and ponds. From marker No. 279 (a breakpoint), the boundary 
extends in an easterly direction to marker No. 285, situated 245 
meters (803.8 feet) northeast of the eastern end of Kuasjdrvi. - 
From marker No. 285 the boundary turns slightly, taking an east-
southeasterly direction to marker No. 290, located on a wooded 
moraine ridge east of a small depression, 20 meters (65.61 feet) north 
from Tardenmyran. From here the boundary continues in the same di-
rection along rocky, open terrain to marker No. 293, situated 400 
meters (1,312 feet) north of the summit of Lasertunturi, at which 
point it turns in a slightly more southerly direction, but continues 
generally east-southeast for about 3.3 kilometers (approximately 2 
miles) to marker No. 302, where it joins the Jakobselv. As in the 
Pasvikelv, the boundary follows the deep channel and, in general, 
the middle of the lakes through which it passes. Islands are allo-
cated to the country on whose side of the channel they lie. 
The boundary continues from marker No. 302 in a general east-
southeasterly direction to the point of directional change in the 
Jakobselv where it meets the river's channel. From this point the 
boundary runs along the channel, first turning north and then veering 
sharply toward the east to marker No. 304. It then follows the river 
in a general east-southeasterly direction, past an isle on the

Norwegian side, to boundary marker No. 308. From here the boundary 
swings along the channel in an arc to marker No. 309. At a rock 
isle on the Soviet side the boundary extends in a southeasterly 
direction to marker No. 310. The boundary winds along with the 
channel, in general in a southeasterly direction, to a point where 
the river widens, flowing around a small wooded isle, to marker No. 
313 (on the Soviet side). At that marker the boundary turns to the 
northeast/ past two isles on the Norwegian side and one on the Soviet 
side, to marker No. 314, then extends in the same general direction 
for about 2.3 kilometers (approximately 1.4 miles) to marker No. 322. 
Norwegian post No. 322 stands on the steep left riverbank, 50 meters 
(164 feet) northeast of the mouth of a brook and 20.5 meters (67.25 
feet) from the border. The Soviet post stands near the right bank, 
on marshland skirted by a river bend (where a brook flows out of 
the marsh), 15.8 meters (51.83 Teet) from the border. The boundary 
continues from marker No. 322 along the channel in an east-south-
easterly direction to marker No. 323, then turns in a north-north-
easterly direction, past an isle on the Soviet side, toward Jakob-
selvvatn (Vuoremijgrvi) to marker No. 325. 
From marker No. 325 the boundary goes along the lake in a 
general northeasterly direction to its outlet (marker No. 330). 
The boundary then continues along the channel of the Jakobselv in a 
northeasterly direction along the rocky riverbed, with an isle on the 
Soviet side, and then on toward the north between seven islets (four 
on the Norwegian side and three on the USSR side) to marker No. 331. 
Maintaining the same general northeasterly direction, the boundary 
extends for about half a kilometer to marker No. 334, situated on 
the Pechenga-Tgrnet road. The Norwegian post stands on the left 
riverbank on the west side of the road from Tgrnet, near a partially 
destroyed bridge. The Soviet post stands on the right bank, also 
west of the road to Pechenga and near the same bridge. From marker 
No. 334 the boundary follows a north-northeasterly then northeasterly 
course to marker No. 336, at which point it turns northward to 
Langvatn (marker No. 337). The boundsry follows the lake in a 
northerly direction to marker No. 338. The Soviet post stands on the 
eastern shore of the lake, on the wooded slope of a hill, 70 meters 
(229.66 feet) south of the outlet of the Sulajoki and 84.5 meters 
(277.23 feet) from the border. The boundary continues northward 
along the lake to marker No. 339, from which it swings to the north-
east and then north again to marker No. 340. The Norwegian post 
stands on the western shore of the lake, 260 meters (853 feet) 
northeast of the mouth of the Korpelva, and 49.5 meters (162.4 feet) 
from the border. From here the boundary proceeds northward along 
the lake to its outlet into the Jakobselv and then northwest along 
the channel to marker No. 341, whence it follows the winding channel 
northward to marker No. 342, situated on an islet on the Soviet side.

The boundary continues from marker No. 342, at first along the 
channel in the Jakobselv and then out into Lake Rundvath, before 
extending toward the north and northeast along the lake and again 
along the channel of the river to marker No. 343. From here the 
boundary continues northward to marker No. 346, where the Norwegian 
post stands on the left riverbank on the northern'point of a wooded 
promontory. The Soviet post is located on the right bank, at the 
northern end of a marsh strip Where the river flows into Lake 
Trollvatn. From marker No. 346 the boundary goes in a northwesterly 
direction along the lake, then follows the channel in the Jakobselv 
to marker No. 348, at which point it turns in'a northeasterly . 
direction to No. 349, leaving an isle on the Norwegian side and 
three on the Soviet side, From marker No. 349 the boundary extends 
in the same direction, past two Norwegian isles and one Soviet isle, 
to marker No. 350. It follows a northerly course along Lake Kjosen, 
then turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 352. From here 
the boundary extends toward the northeast along some rapids and then 
in a general northerly direction to marker No. 353, at which point 
it follows the bends of the channel for approximately 2.7 kilometers 
(about 1.7 miles) to marker No, 358. In this sector the boundary 
passes numerous isles along Rundholen, a wide -section of the river. 
From marker No. 358 the boundary follows a general northwesterly' 
course past a number of islets to marker No. 362; the Sandvasselv 
enters the Jakobselv on the Norwegianeide of the border between 
markers Nos. 360 and 361. The boundary then continues in a north-
northwesterly .direction to marker No. 364, with several wooded islands 
on both sides of the border. The Norwegian post stands on the left 
riverbank, 66 meters (216.53 feet) north of a hut (Elveheim), and the 
Soviet post stands on the lower right bank, at the northern tip of 
two small rock islands. From marker No. 364 the boundary continues 
along the channel, swinging to the west and then the north in a sharp 
curve, to marker No. 365, whence it continues along the channel in a 
north-northwesterly direction, past three isles on the Soviet side 
and two on the Norwegian side, to marker No. 366. The boundary then 
turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 367, where it 
makes a double bend toward the southeast, the northwest, and back to 
the east-southeast to marker No. 368. It then swings alongthe 
channel in another horseshoe curve around Langletneset, passes two 
isles on the Norwegian side, and turns to the north-northeast to 
marker No. 369. From there the boundary travels in a general norther-
ly direction (first northeast, then northwest) to marker No. 372, 
from which point it swings along the channel in three sharp turns, 
chiefly west-northwest,-leaving five isles on the Soviet side, to 
marker No. 373.

The boundary continues to marker No. 374 along the channel in 
a northwesterly direction, turning west-northwest and passing two 
islets on the Soviet side, to marker No. 375, where it turns in a 
north-northeasterly direction to marker No. 376. Passing along 
the channel of the river, which bends around two promontories --
Storsteinneset on the Norwegian side and an unnamed peninsula on 
the Soviet side -- the boundary extends in a generally northwest 
direction to marker No. 378, then winds toward the northwest, west, 
and north over some rapids to marker No. 379. Continuing in a 
general northwesterly direction to marker No. 382, the boundary 
turns toward the northeast past a small brush-covered isle on the 
Soviet side to marker No. 383. The Norwegian post stands on the low, 
rocky left riverbank, 120 meters 393.7 feet) south-southeast of 
the Bjornstad Farm and 33 meters 108.26 feet) from the border. 
Curving along a bend in the channel toward the east and southeast 
past the mouth of the Tverrelva River to marker No. 384, the bound-
ary extends in a general northerly direction (first east and then 
west) to marker No. 386. In this sector the Norwegian post stands 
on the left bank, on a large crag 4 meters (13.12 feet) west of a 
road running between Lillesanden and BjOrnstad. The boundary turns 
from marker No. 386, first in a northeasterly direction, then bend-
ing sharply toward the east and then the northwest, to marker No. 
387, located on a low, wooded promontory on the Norwegian side, 170 
meters (557.74 feet) northeast of the Heimdal Farm and 36 meters 
(118.11 feet) from the border. The Soviet post stands on the right 
riverbank, at the edge of a steep wooded slope 16.5 meters (54.13 
feet) from the border. 
Continuing to wind along with the channel in a general north-
northwesterly direction, the boundary extends approximately 3.5 
kilometers (about 2.2 miles) to marker No. 394. In this area, 
Norwegian marker No. 391 is situated 52 meters (170.6 feet) north-
east of a school at Eggemoen, and marker No. 394 is located 140 
meters (459.31 feet) from the Heggdalsmo Farm. The Soviet post 
stands on the right riverbank, on a low, rocky sandbar 13 meters 
(42.65 feet) from the foot of the northwestern slope of Pikkutunturi 
Mountain. The boundary then twists and turns in sweeping curves along 
the channel, chiefly to the northwest, to marker No. 400, then turns 
in a general westerly direction to marker No. 401. In this sector 
Norwegian post No. 396 stands on the left bank of the Jakobselv, 
on a steep mountain slope descending from Ovreflag, 5 meters (16.4 
feet) west of the Lillesanden-Bjornstad road, and post No. 399 is 
located on a steep dip descending from Nedreflag, 7 meters (22.96

(939.3 feet) from the border. From marker No. 405 the boundary 
goes along the deep channel toward the north-northwest, past a 
large sandbank that divides at Storbekken, to marker No. 407. From 
here the boundary extends in the same direction for less than a 
kilometer to marker No. 411, with the Norwegian post on the left 
bank at the northeast end of Storsanden, and the Soviet post near 
the top of a crag on the right bank, 9.6 meters (31.5 feet) northwest 
of a cairn that was erected in 1826 and bears the old number 363. 
At low tide, numerous sandbanks are exposed in the wide section 
of the Jakobselv south of its mouth. The boundary in this area 
follows tha channel of the river at low tide, which places it close 
to the Soviet side of the estuary (see map 12104). The boundary 
continues near the Soviet bank through the narrows to marker No. 412, 
the last marker at the mouth of the river. Between markers Nos. 
412 and 415 the boundary is marked by a series of sight lines from 
boundary markers and by special sight markers. From marker No. 412 
the boundary goes north-northwest in a straight line for 47.8 meters 
(156.8 feet), north for 214 meters (702 feet), and again north-
northwest for 429 meters (1,407 feet) to the final marker, No. 415. 
C. Boundary Marking, Administration, and Security  
The land boundary between Norway and the USSR is marked by pairs 
of wooden posts or by single stone cairns (Figures 5 and 6). Each 
marker is visible from the next, and in no case are the markers more 
than 1 kilometer apart. Double markers on land are placed at a 
distance of 2 meters (6.56 feet) on either side of the line, and the 
line itself is indicated by a small wooden post or by the center of 
a 25-centimeter (9.84-inch) circle carved in rock. A cleared strip , 
along the entire land boundary measures 8 meters (26.24 feet) in 
width, which, in the case of the double markers, includes the 4 meters 
(13.12 feet) between the posts and 2 meters (6.56 feet) behind each 
post. Markers Nos. 11, 208, 211, 222, and 279, at the main break-
points (changes of direction) in the boundary (see map 11738), 
are old stone cairns, which were restored in 1947. 
Where the boundary follows the Pasvikelv and the Jakobselv, it 
is marked by double posts, one on either side of the river or lake, 
or one on a bank (Figure 7) and one on an island. North of the 
mouth of the Jakobselv is the northernmost marker of the 1947 bound-
ary, marker No. 415. -This is a buoy stake anchored at a depth of 
17 meters (55.77 feet). 
Most of the boundary posts are 2 meters (6.56 feet) high and 
22 centimeters (8.66 inches) square. The Norwegian posts are

A very detailed agreement dealing with border activities and 
providing means for the settlement of conflicts and incidents was 
signed on 29 December 1949. The agreement. went into effect on 
30 October 1950, after exchange of instruments of ratification in 
Moscow. 11/ 
The agreement provides regulations for the following: (1) the 
inspection and maintenance of markers and a cleared strip (vista) 
along the boundary; (2) the use of boundary, streams and lakes, in-
cluding shipping, log floating, and fishing; (3) land use along 
the land boundary, including hunting, agriculture, and mining; (4) 
the avoidance of incidents; and (5) the solution of disputeb.and the 
enforcement of the provisions of the agreement. Article I states 
specifically that the boundary extends under the ground and into the 
air. Points 2 and 3 are of particular interest, since their effec-
tiveness in guaranteeing to residents of the border areas the right to 
pursue their means of livelihood will determine whether the course 
of the boundary will be subject to dispute in the future. 
The provisions for the movement of, vessels and for fishing apply 
to both the Pasvikelv and jakobselv, but the regulations on timber 
floating apply only to the Pasvikelv, probably because the Jakobselv 
area is almost barren. Vessels may use the main channel, even if 
they must cross the line to do so, in the narrow sections of the 
Pasvikelv between markers Nos. 9 and 10 and at marker No. 196 and 
along the entire Jakobsely boundary. This permits Soviet travel 
through the part of the Pasvikelv that lies wholly within Norway. 
Limitations at marker No. 196, on the other hand, prohibit Norwegian 
transport through the Soviet KOlttakengyas area, thus preventing 
Norwegian use of the river as a.route to and from the sea. Above 
this area, the river would not be a.main waterway even if it were 
open, since only shallow Lapp boats can navigate above the Soviet-
held portion and portages are necessary at the falls and rapids. 
In the larger lakes the only vessels allowed to cross the boundary 
are those used in log floating, which may do so under certain 
conditions. 
Fishing is allowed up to the boundary, but fishing zones are 
not defined by marker numbers. Presumably fishing by nationals 
of the USSR is not permitted in the part of the Pasvikelv between 
boundary markers Nos. 9 and 11, which belongs to Norway, or by 
Norwegians in the Kolttakengyas region, which belongs to the USSR. 
Both travel along and fishing in the rivers at night are prohibited

except on the larger lakes, where vessels must stay at least 200 
meters (656.2 'Peet) from the line and be adequately lighted. All 
vessels must be marked clearly, and landing on the bank of the other 
country is allowed only in case of distress. 
Limitations on the floating of timber are not so strict. Nor-
mally, logs may be floated freely through the two sectors of the - 
Pasvikelv that lie entirely on either the Norwegian or Soviet side 
of the line. This is a distinct advantage to the Norwegians, since 
it gives them access to the mouth of the Pasvikelv, which lies in 
their territory. Soviet regulation has disturbed the water level in 
some areas to such a degree, however, that log floating by Norwegians 
has been restricted. Until special agreements have been reached on 
control of the water level of the Pasvikelv, the Norwegians will 
probably avoid the risk of having timber lie dry in the riverbed. 
The boundary administrators are to decide by 1 April of each year 
when timber may be floated in the area. Foremen and crews are 
'allowed to cross the river and work on the opposite bank by daylight 
to set up installations essential to the floating activities. At 
least 5 days' notice of such a boundary crossing must be given to 
authorities of the other country, and the workers must have special 
certificates from their boundary commissioner. Timber floated down 
the river is not subject to customs or other duties. 
Agriculture, lumbering, and mining are to be carried on without 
violating or damaging territory or property of the other country or 
crossing the boundary for any reason. Wild animals and birds are not 
to be shot or pursued across the boundary. The other party must be 
notified of dangerous forest fires across the boundary, or of 
trees that have fallen across the line, which will then be cut and 
returned. Mineral deposits may not be explored or exploited in a 
manner that might cause damage on the other side of the boundary. 
(Figure 8.) These activities are prohibited within a 20-meter 
(65.6-foot) strip along the boundary unless the two parties agree to 
an exception and make adequate provisions to "insure the preservation 
of the boundary line." 
Conflicts and incidents resulting from nonconformance with the 
regulations or from such issues as injury of persons living on the 
other side of the boundary, unapproved crossings and communications, 
animals straying across the boundary, photographing of parts of the 
other country, and damaging of markers are to be handled by the 
boundary commissioners. Serious issues may be negotiated through 
diplomatic channels, but provision is Made for returning such issues 
to local authorities for discussion. (Figure 9.)

The 1949 regime agreement provided for the concluding of 
special agreements regarding the construction of any installations 
on the boundary rivers that might affect the flow or level of water. 
Before the regime agreement was drawn up, some Norwegian farmland 
in the valley had been flooded during the summer and suffered from 
drought in the fall because the USSR had dammed the river and regu-
lated the water level, probably in connection with the Yaniskoski 
powerplant upstream beyond the southern end of the Finnish-USSR 
boundary. The problem of waterflow seems likely to become increasing-
ly significant since the Yaniskoski dam has been completed. Another 
dam is under construction at the Rajakoski (Ragjeguoikka) (falls) 
and possibly still another on the Pasvikelv near Kolttakengyas. 
The great number of boundary restrictions necessitates a system 
of almost constant patrol, particularly in the settled Pasvikelv 
Valley. The Norwegians, as a result of the December 1949 agreement, 
planned to expand their frontier police force and, in response to 
Soviet protests against Norwegian boundary crossings, to have a 
permanent police force in the frontier areas where settlement 
is comparatively dense. According to recent press reports, the 
Norwegian Government, in connection with the next national budget, 
will recommend that the present border patrol be almost doubled in 
strength. If the reported proposals are put into effect, a force of 
approximately 50 men will patrol the 122-mile-long Norwegian-Soviet 
frontier. The recommendations will also include the construction of 
houses and watchtowers to facilitate the work of the border guards. 
The USSR has placed wooden watchtowers at points along the 
Pasvikelv portion of the boundary averaging one-half kilometer 
(1,640 feet) apart and about 200 yards behind the line. 12/ Although 
the border is watched closely by Soviet guards, it is apparently 
possible to cross undetected during the summer. The Soviets can 
"organize a very effective pursuit" if an illegal crossing is sus-
pected, 13/ but the Soviet side of the border does not appear to be 
as heavily guarded here as farther south. 
D. Maps of the Boundary 
The exact location of the present Norway-USSR boundary is shown 
best on the official 1947 demarcation map at 1:25,000 (1 in list 
of citations at end of this section). Ranking second is the Norwegian 
topographic map series at 1:100,000, which shows the Norwegian version 
of the line. No large-scale Soviet maps produced since the USSR 
acquired Pechenga are available. Two sheets of a 1941 Soviet map at 
1:500,000 (2) show the boundary, but this is neither an official 
presentation of the line (the Pechenga area was still a part of 
Finland) nor of much value in tracing the actual detailed course of

the boundary, since the scale is too small. Consequently the pres-
ent.Soviet area is covered only by some very old Finnish map series. 
Maps at scales smaller than 1:100,000 do not show adequately 
such detailed features as islands and sandbanks in the boundary ? 
rivers, which have been the main subjects of dispute Sheet No. 
35, pechenga, of the AMS 1:250,000 series (3) shows the bound-
ary line at that scale as "approximate." For the jakobselv area even 
the scale of 1:100,000 is much too small, and sufficient detail is 
given only on the 1947 demarcation map (1) and the Finnish 1:20,000 
maps (4). Usefulness of the Finnish maps is limited because of the 
early date -(1928-33) of the surveys on which they are based; 
changes in the thalweg and islands of the rivers since the surveys 
were made have altered the position of the boundary considerably. 
Furthermore, the map does not show the boundary symbol in the 
estuary of the Jakobselv and the waters to the north, and the 
available sheets cover the boundary only as far south as approximately 
69!20'N. 
Finnish coverage of the boundary area at scales of 1:100,000 and 
1:200,000 is spotty, the former covering approximately the same area 
as the 1:20,000 series and the latter covering only the southernmost 
part of the boundary. Although the scale is too small to show bound-
ary detail, Finnish map coverage of the-boundary is provided by the 
1:400,000 general map of Finland (5). The most recent date of this 
series is 1946, but a supplementary sheet has been issued that shows 
later boundary revision, including the delineation of the new Finnish-
Soviet boundary in the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area. 
German maps and the British.GSGS maps of the border area are 
based on the Norwegian and Finnish series, with the boundary line 
apparently taken from the Norwegian 1:100,000 series. 
The boundary demarcation map (1) is more useful than the 
descriptive protocol because it shows the exact position of the 
line; the protocol merely supplements the information shown on the 
map. The demarcation map locates the boundary line and its 415 
markers and carries topographic detail for strips 0.5 kilometer 
(1,640 feet) wide on both sides of the line, including the areas 
along the banks and shores of boundary rivers and of all but the 
largest boundary lakes.. The markers are located on the Map with 
an error of not more than 0.2 millimeter, and topographic detail 
within the boundary strip is plotted with almost equal precision.

II. Finland-USSR Border  
A. History of the Boundary  
In 1899, Russia, with which Finland had been united since 1809 
as a semi-independent Grand Duchy, began a policy of.Russification 
with the purpose of restricting the constitutional and civil 
liberties of Finland. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, however, 
Finland was proclaimed an independent state, and a peace treaty be-
tween the new Finnish Republic and the Soviet Union was signed in 
Dorpat (Tartu) on 14 October 1920. By the terms of that treaty, the 
USSR recognized Finland "within the boundaries of the Grand Duchy of 
Finland, as an independent and self-subsistent nation." According 
to Article 4 of the treaty, the Petsamo .2Tchenga7 region was to be 
ceded to Finland,1.21/ which thus gained an outlet on the Arctic - 
Ocean. Article 5 of the treaty stipulated that the Governments of 
Finland and the USSR were to appoint a special commission, consisting 
of two members from each country, to delimit and demarcate the 
frontiers. A general protocol covering the course of the boundary 
from the Gulf of Finland to Vaitolahti on the Arctic Ocean was signed 
in Moscow on 28 April 1938. It was stated that by this action the 
boundary delimitation begun in 1925 and completed on the ground in 
1934 had been "definitely established." 1V The Treaty of Dorpat 
also provided for the withdrawal of Finnish troops from the communes 
of Repola and Porajdrvi and the reincorporation of these communes 
into the Soviet Union. 
In January 1939 Finland and Sweden signed an agreement for the 
joint fortification of the Aland Islands. This proposal aroused 
Soviet protests, although other interested nations gave their ap-
proval. By the fall of 1939 (14 October) the Soviet Union, in order 
to strengthen the security of Leningrad, presented a specific set of 
demands to the Finnish Government. These were (1) the cession of a 
number of strategic islands in the Gulf of Finland; (2) the relin-
quishing of territory in the southeast (the Karelian Isthmus); (3) the 
cession of some land in the extreme north, on the Rybachi ffiybachig 
Peninsula; (4) the demilitarization of the Soviet-Finnish frontier; 
and (5) a 30-year lease on the port of Hango (Hanko) and adjacent 
land, for the establishment of a Soviet naval base. In return, the 
USSR offered to give Finland 2,134 square miles of Soviet territory 
on the east-central frontier (Karelia). 
Finland was prepared to yield to most of the Soviet demands, but 
firmly refused, as incompatible with her neutrality, to lease or sell 
the port of Hane. This refusal resulted in the termination of nego-
tiations. At the end of November the Soviet Union launched the 
"Winter War" of 1939-40 by invading Finland's eastern frontiers.

After 105 days of fighting, superiority in manpower and materials 
enabled the USSR to defeat the Finns, who signed a treaty of peace 
in Moscow on 12 March 1940. 
The terms of the treaty were far more exacting than the original 
demands of the Soviet Union. Finland was forced to cede about 10 
percent of its territory, including (1) the entire Karelian Isthmus, 
including Viipuri gybor0 and the islands in the bay; (2) territory' 
to the north and west of Lake Ladoga; (3)' a number of islands in the 
Gulf of Finland; (4) a sizable triangle of land to the northeast, 
in the Salla region; and (5) Part of the Rybachi Peninsula. 16/ 
At the same time the Soviet Union obtained a 30-year lease qn HangS 
Peninsula (and some adjacent land and water) for conversion into a 
Soviet naval base. Article 5 of the Treaty of Moscowl confirmed the 
transfer of the Petsamo District to Finland (Treaty of Dorpat, 1920) 
and provided for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the area to 
permit free transit of persons, goods, and air traffic. The treaty 
also provided for the creation of a Mixed Boundary Commission for 
the purpose of establishing a more detailed delineation of the 
boundary line. The protocol delimiting the new frontier between 
Finland and the USSR was signed by the representatives of the two 
nations on 29 April 1940. 21/ 
When the Germans invaded the USSR on 22 June 1941, they were 
joined by the Finns. This military venture turned out disastrously 
for Finland. Hostilities ended on 4 September 1944, and on 19 
September an armistice was signed in Moscow between Finland on one 
hand and the USSR and the United Kingdom on the other (the latter 
acting on behalf of the Allied Powers at war with Germany and Finland). 
Under the terns of the armistice, the Soviet-Finnish borders of 1940 
were restored and Finland agreed to return tfie-Pa-Midt-area-trr-the-

been "voluntarily ceded to Finland by the Soviet State in accordance 
with the Peace Treaties of 14 October 1920 and 12 March 1940." 18/ 
The relinquishment of Petsamn was later confirmed by the Treaty of 
Peace of 10 February 1947, 22/* which, after ratification, went into 
effect on 18 September 1947. In addition, Finland granted the USSR 
a 50-year lease on the Porkkala Peninsula as a naval base. In the 
1947 Treaty of Peace the Soviet Union confirmed the renunciation of 
its right to the lease of the Peninsula of Hangs. 
*The Treaty of Peace was signed by Finland and all the Allied 
and Associated Powers except the United States, which had not de-
clared war onTinland.

The new boundary between Finland and the USSR was surveyed and 
marked by a Mixed Soviet-Finnish Commission in the summer of 1945 (see 
accompanying map 12927). The demarcation documents were signed on 
26 October 1945 and confirmed by an exchange of notes ?On 19 February 
1946. The terminus of the new boundary was. the cairn on Ktokfjell 
Mountain, which became the trijunction of the frontiers of Norway, 
Finland, and the Soviet Union. 
Under the terms of the German Assets Agreement of 3 February 
1947 between Finland and the USSR (ratified 18 April 1947),,the 
Yanis koski....4.rea in northern Finlandwas ceded 
S5agt_pnion. The Finns agreed, as part of triEripaa'-el-AAL-ci176--
reeonstruct the dams and hydroelectric station at Yaniskoski which 
served as the main source of power for the Petsamo nickel mines. 
As a result of this cession of territory, a new demarcation of the 
northernmost boundary (just south of Ktokfjell) was undertaken in 
the summer of 1947, and ,a new boundary protocol was signed on 
7 December 1947. 22/ 
On 19 June 1948 a Finnish-Soviet agreement for the settlement of 
border disputes and incidents was signed at Moscow. The protocol 
applied not only to the frontier between Finland and the USSR but 
also to the border between Finland and Porkkala-Udd. The document 
was concerned mainly with border markings, boundary-crossing pro-
cedure, and customs formalities affecting hunting, forestry, and 
mining. 21, 22/ Six months later, on 9 December 1948, another agree-
ment between the Governments of Finland and the USSR was signed 
concerning measures necessary to maintain a proper regime on the 
border between the two countries. On 22 April 1949 an "in,force" 
order implemented this agreement.

The border between Finland and the USSR starts in the south on 
the east side of Virolahtl Bay off the Gulf of Finland and runs in 
*This boundary description covers areas of different widths for 
different sectors of the boundary; for the 1940 boundary, the area 
is approximately 1 kilometer (about 0.6 mile) wide; for the old-
domain (pre-1940) boundary, it is approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 
mile) wide. Along the 1940 boundary, the markers are numbered, from 
south to north, with a Roman numeral indicating the sector and an 
Arabic numeral the marker -- for example, No. I/1; for markers-along 
the old-domain boundary, an Arabic numeral is used alone, as No. 857; 
and for those along the 1947 Yaniskoski-Niskakoski boundary, the 
designation includes a letter, as A/44.

a northeasterly direction, bisecting Karelia, to Lake Virmajdrvi in 
Ilomantsi, the easternmost point in Finland.* From the lake the bor-
der follows an irregular course, generally south-north in direction, 
seldom paralleling a divide or water course, to the Patsjoki (Paats-
joki) River. At the Patsjoki it turns eastward for about 20 
kilometers (approximately 12 miles) and ends at Krokfjell Mountain, 
the tri-state junction point. The length of the border is about 1,269 
kilometers (approximately 788 miles), of which all but some 200 kilo-
meters (124 miles) is over land. 
F9r purposes of this study the Finnish-Soviet boundary has been 
divided into the following eight sectors: 
1. The Southeast sector, from the shore of the Gulf of Finland 
(Rautalanlahti Bay), boundary marker No. I/1, to Lake Immalanjgrvi, 
boundary marker No. I (the 1940 border), a distance of 108.8 
kilometers (67.6 miles), of which 11.3 kilometers (approximately 7 
miles) are over water (lake and river) and 97.5 kilometers (about 
61 miles) over land. 
2. From Lake Immalangrvi, marker No. II/1, to Lake Kangasjgrvi, 
marker No. III/11 a length of 116.8 kilometers (about 72.5 miles), 
of which 39.2 kilometers (about 24 miles) are over water (lake and 
river) and 77.6 kilometers (about 48 miles) are over land. 
3. From Lake Kangasjgrvi, marker No. III/1, to Lake Virmagrvi, 
marker No. 111/277/577 (No. 577), a length of 139 kilometers (about 
86 miles), of which 34.4 kilometers (about 21 miles) are over water 
(lake and river) and 104.6 kilometers (about 65 miles) are over land. 
4. From marker No. 577 to marker No. 775 on the old state bound-
ary between the USSR and Finland (the central sector of the pre-1940 
border), a length of approximately 468 kilometers (about 291 miles), 
5. From marker No. 775 (IV/1) to the Kuolajgrvi-Kelloselka road 
the Salla sector), marker No. V/1, a distance of 149.4 kilometers 
about 93 miles), of which 20.2 kilometers (12.5 miles) are over 
water (lake and river) and 129.2 kilometers (about 80 miles) over 
land. . 
*In Finnish, "lahti" means bay; "jgrvi," lake; "vaara," mountain 
or hill.; and ,"joki," river. In the translation of the protocols, as 
in this report, the English term is in many cases added to the name. 
Place names in the Finnish section follow the spellings on the two 
1:250,000 AMS series, M515, Finland-Scandinavia 1:250,000, and N501,

(656 feet) west of Signaalivuori eignalinay2.7 Mountain, leaving 
Simola Farmstead (NP 35, 36-14: 5....-671) on the Soviet side. The 
boundary turns to an east-northeasterly course and continues in a 
straight line to boundary marker No. I/11, located in the middle of 
Koskelanjoki River. In this sector the border passes through an area 
of sparse mixed woodland, crossing Lake Kiiskijdrvi between markers 
Nos. 1/7 and 1/8. It then takes a general northerly course along the 
middle of Koskelanjoki River to marker NO. I/14, located on ar island 
at the confluence of Oiskelanjoki River and a nameless stream, leaving 
the villages of Koskela and Reinikkala ITeynikkala7 (NP 35, 36-14:

No. 1/20, located on the.Viipuri-Hamina highway (NP 35, 36-14: 
54-671): In this area of sparse coniferous and deciduous? trees 
the border intersects two paths (at markers Nos. 1/18 and .I/19) 
and passes through some swampland* south of marker No, 1/20. 
Continuing in a northeasterly course in a straight line for approxi-
mately 8 kilometers (about 5 miles) to marker No. 1/30, the bound-
ary traverses a mixed woodland area and some brush or shrub land,, 
crossing numerous roads or tracks... It crosses the Urpalanjoki 
River at marker No. 1/22 and intersects the Ndppi-Murikala 
(Muurikkala) country road at marker No. I/27i In this sector the , 
villages of Mgkeld Lgyakelya7 (NP 35, 36-14: 5.2-672), Laisniemi, and 
Ndppi are situated on the Soviet side of the border and Laisniemi 
Farmstead is on the Finnish side. 
From marker No. 1/30 the boundary follows a straight line in a 
northeasterITdirection_to marker No. 1/32, a point 520 meters 
(1,706 feet) northeast of the eastern shore of Lake Salajgrvi** 
on the Finnish side. The village of Salajdrvi fdalayarvi7 (NP 354 
36-14: 5.2-672) is on the USSR side. The boundary then turns in a 
southeasterly direction to marker No. 1/33, located 135 meters (443 
feet) southeast of the point of divergence of the Salajdrvi-Nurmela-
Vgkevgld roads (NP 35, 36-14: 5.2-672). From marker No, 1/33 the 
boundary again follows a northeasterly course to marker No. I/35, then 
turns in a northwesterly direction to VI Arker No. 1/36 before con-
tinuing in a general northeasterly direction. Maintaining the same 
course for approximately 4 kilometers (about 2.5 miles) to marker No. 
I/45, Situated on the right shore of Santajoki River (brook), the 
boundary traverses an area of Mixed woods and swamps, crossing Lake 
Hallilampi between markers Nos. 1/40 and 1/41 and the BRkkijgrvi-Pulsa 
highway at marker No. 1/431 as well as a few dirt, field, and forest 
roads. From the Santajoki,the boundary continues in a northeasterly

leaving Vanhatimperi ffankhatimperi7 Farmstead (NP 35, 36-14: 
56-673) on the Soviet side. 
After making a turn at marker No. 1/66 the boundary continues 
in an east-northeasterly direction across Lake Lasilampi, completing 
an inverted V-shaped bend at marker No. 1/72. From here the boundary 
makes a V-shaped turn and resumes a northeasterly course to Tervajoki 
River (marker No. I/79), intersecting the HUs1E-Hyttild road (track) 
at marker No. 1/76. North of this point(marker No. 1/80) the 
boundary crosses the HEsUld-Villala road NP 35, 36...14: 56-674). In 
this sector the border passes through a predominantly swampy area. 
Following the same general course, the boundary crosses the UkkojErvi 
River between markers Nos. 1/84 and I/85, then continues in a 
northeasterly direction for a few more kilometers to marker No. I/89, 
situated at the confluence of two unnamed streams southwest of 
Kaiko (Kaikko) ffiaykkg village (NP 35/ 36-14: 51-674). From marker . 
No. 1/89 the boundary turns to the north-northeast and follows a 
straight line through a region of mixed woods, intersecting a number 
of dirt roads and crossing Lake TelkjUrvi (NP 35, 36-14: 51674), 
to marker No. 1/96, located in the middle of the Hounijoki River. 
At this point the boundary turns to a general southeasterly direction 
along the middle of the Hounijoki and goes downstream to marker No. 
I/98, 200 meters (656 feet) southwest of Rajasalmi village (on the 
Soviet side). It then turns again in a northeasterly direction and 
goes in a straight line to marker No. I/100. At marker No. 1/99 
the boundary crosses the single-track, 5-foot-gauge Viipuri-Kbuvola 
railroad (NP 35, 36-.14: 51-674). The railroad station at Vainikkala 
on the Finnish side is used regularly for traffic across the border 
(Figures 10 and 11). Continuing in the same direction through an 
area of sparse woods and swamps, the boundary maintains a straight 
line until it crosses the Ykspdlinjoki River between markers Nos. 
1/108 and I/112, where it bends to the southeast, the northeast, and 
then north. (This curve appears as only a slight bend on the 
1:250,000 series.) North of the river the border resumes a northeast-
erly course, intersects the Lautala-Haapajdrvi dirt road or track 
(NP 35, 36-14: 51-675), and continues in a straight line to the 
Viipuri-Lappeenranta highway (NP 35, 36.-14: 51-672), which it crosses 
between Nos. 1/123 and 1/124. At the latter marker, it turns slightly

(40.68 feet) from the shore. From here the boundary goes in a 
southeasterly direction to marker No. 1/147, where it turns 
toward the east, intersecting the Kokkila (Kokinkyld)-Viipuri 
road at marker No. 1/150 (NP 35, 36-14: 58-676). Taking an east-
southeasterly course, the boundary extends to marker No. 1/152, 
located on the left shore of the Saimaa Canal where it enters Lake 
Nuijamaajgrvi 2Tzero Nuiyama-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36-14: 58-676). Markers 
Nos..1/153 and 1/154 are located on small islands in the lake, with 
the boundary line running to the north of the Soviet islands of 
Herrasaari and Vuohisaari. At marker No. 1/155 the boundary goes 
overland in a northeasterly direction to the northwestern shore of 
a small lake, Laihalampi (marker NO. 1/158), and then in a south-
easterly direction to the north shore of Lake Pankajdrvi 
(Pankkajdrvi), leaving both lakes on the USSR side. The Pohjola 
Farm is located on the Finnish side to the north of this area. 
From Lake Pankajgrvi (marker No. 1/162) the boundary follows a 
pneral north-northeasterly course for approximately 8 kilometers 
(about 5 miles) to marker No. 1/179. In this sector are some swampy 
terrain, stands of both coniferous and deciduous trees, and patches - 
of brash. Boundary marker No. 1/170 is located on the Kdntu-Askola 
road 200 meters (about 656 feet) west of the fork of the Kbntu-
Ndveri ?Yaveri:7-Askola roads (NP 35, 36-14: 52-676), leaving a 
group of homesteads south of Kbntu (on the Soviet side). Continuing' 
in a northeasterly direction from marker No. 1/179, the border inter-
sects the Viipuri-Joutseno road at marker No. 1/180 and crosses Lake 
Suokumanjgrvi (Suokumaanjgrvi) between markers Nos. 1/181 and 1/182, 
leaving some of the,Penttild jenttilya7 Homesteads on the Soviet 
side (mikkeli; NP 351 36-10:- 52-676) and some on the Finnish side. 
From marker No. 1/181 the boundary follows a northerly course to 
No. 1/186, situated on the southwestern shore of the small lake, 
Valkealampi, before taking a northeasterly direction to marker No. 
1/202. In this area of woodland and brush, the border crosses the

east of Imatra (Figures 12 and 13). In this sector what appear to 
be telephone and telegraph lines parallel the forest lanes that 
cross the border south of marker No. 1/222. From this point the 
boundary follows a straight line in a northeasterly direction to 
marker No. I/225, then turns north-northeast to No. I/228, located 
410 meters(
1,345 feet) northeast of the fork formed by the j 
la ddski-
Hirsm ./ 
pi Khirslampi7 road (NP 35, 36-10: 60-678) and a country 
road going west. Taking a northeasterly course to marker No. I/231, 
situated 90 meters (295 feet) north of the JUdski-Hirslampi road and 
480 meters (1,574.8 feet) southwest of an isolated homestead on an 
elevation in Finnish territory, the boundary turns in an easterly 
direction to marker No. 1/234, located 660 meters (2/165 feet) south-
west of a peat barn on the JUdski-Hirslampi road. In this sector the 
boundary appears as an inverted bowl on the AMS 1:250,000 map series. 
From marker No. 1/234 the boundary takes a northeasterly course 
to marker No. 1/235, located on the southern tip of the Karhusuo peat 
bog, then continues in the same general direction (with some angular 
turns) to marker No. 1/242. The boundary from marker No. 1/225 
through No. 1/242 closely parallels the JUdski-Hirslampi road, which 
is on the USSR side. Only .a portion of this road appears on the 
1:250,000 map series, which shows the boundary in this area as a 
shallow bowl-shaped bend. From marker No. 1/242, the boundary con-
tinues in a northeasterly direction in a straight line to marker No. 
I/247, located 87 meters (285.4 feet) east of an isolated homestead 
on the Finnish side, leaving Laitila Village on the Soviet side (a 
Laytila Village is shown slightly to the south of this approximate 
location on the 1:250,000 series). 
The boundary goes in a straight line from marker No. 1/247 
through No. 1/255 to marker No. II/1, which is situated 200 meters 
(656 feet) north of the northern tip of the triangle formed by 
the roads in Hirslampi Village and 8 meters (26 feet) west of the 
Hirslampi-Niskala (Niskapietild) road 00 35, 36-.10: 60-678). In

easternmost inlet of Lake Immalanjdrvi. 
Sector No. 2, Lake immalanjdrvi to Lake Kangasjdrvi: 
From marker No. II/1 the boundary continues in a northeasterly 
direction along a straight line to marker No. II/5, south of Lassila 
Village (NP 35, 36-10: 61-678) on the western shore of Rapolankorven-
oja, 4 meters (13 feet) From the shoreline and 230 meters (754.5 feet) 
south of a small bridge- From here the boundary continues in the same 
course, intersecting the Hilisevanjoki River (between markers Nos. 
11/6 and II/7), to marker No. II/11, located 3 meters (9,8 feet) 
southwest of the Natikanlahti-Purnujdrvi (PurnujErvi Estate). In this 
sector, a small lake, Leppdlampi, is on the USSR side, and the area 
is one of swamps (with reeds), mixed forests, and country roads or 
paths. What appear to be powerlines cross the boundary between mark-
ers Nos. II/3 and 11/4 and slightly north of No, 11/5. 
From marker No. II/11, the boUndary continues in a northeasterly 
directiony'except in the area of Suurissari Island on Lake Hiidenjdrvi 
OMP 35, 36-10: 61-672), where the boundary makes a U-shaped bend 
around the south end of the island 50 meters (164 feet) from the 
shore, leaving the whole island on the Finnish side. The exact 
position of the boundary in this area is given by three posts with 
pointers to boundary marker No. 11/15, located on the western shore 
of a small lake, KarsalaMpi The border skirts the northern edge 
of this lake, leaving it on the Soviet side: From marker No. 11/19 
the boundary follows a winding but generally northeasterly course 
along the middle of an unnamed brook, Which flows from the north.-
eastern tip of Lake Karsalampi, to marker No; II/22, situated at the 
confluence of that brook with another brook flowing through Roiha 
Village. The boundary then extends in a straight line to marker No. 
II/23, located on a steep sand hillock south of Viikko (Paavola) 
Village (NP 35, 36-10: 61-67,2)., 59 meters (193.5 feet) from the brook. 
From this point the boundary takes a southeasterly direction to 
marker No. II/241 then resumes a northeasterly course to the Lankila-
Miettild road (marker No. I1/25). It then parallels the Karajoki 
River (a Kuruy-YOki River is shown on the 1:250,000 series) before 
veering in a north-northwesterly direction to marker No. 11/27, 
located in a woods at the eastern end of a field belonging to Nilkko 
Village and 145 meters (475.7 feet) from a hay barn. The sector from 
marker No. 11/23 to No. 11/27 appears as a pronounced bend on the 
1:250,000 series. 
From marker No. 11/27 the boundary makes a- turn to a northeaster-
ly course, which it follows to marker No. II/291 situated at the east-

in a.general northeasterly direction along the middle of an unnamed 
brook downstream to marker No. II/411 and then goes in a straight 
line in the same direction to the AnkilEnsalo-Ankild country road or 
track (marker No. 11/47). In this sector the border crosses the 
Ilmee-Laikonkanka and the Pajari 2Tayari7-Ankild (Haaprinta-Jokela) 
roads at markers Nos. 11/39 and 11/44, respectively (no road con-
necting the latter two villages appears on the AMS 1:250;000 series). 
In part of this region the boundary traverses an area of swampland. 
Continuing in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 11/49, located 
on the northeast shore of Kokkolanjoki (Kitolanjoki) ffokkolan-lbki7

Northeast of Lake Kurkelanjdrvi the boundary follows an unnamed brook 
and crosses three small lakes -7 Soikulanlampi, Munalampi, and 
Kaatiolampi -- to marker No. II/115, located on a cape projecting 
from the northwest and separating Nirkonlahti Inlet from Lake 
KorpijErvi LOzero.K.orpi-Yarvi.7 OP 35, 36.-10: 42-.684). In this sector 
of approximately 6 kilometers (about 3.7 miles), the border passes 
through a region of deciduous forest, some stands of pine, a logged-
over area (at marker 11/111), and some swampland and is crossed by 
forest roads. It continues in a northeasterly direction by way of 
Lake Korpijdrvi, leaving Suursaari Island on the Finnish side, to 
marker NO. 11/119, on the western shore of Suojdrvi. In this area 
the border crosses two minor roads. Continuing in the same direction,

continues in a straight line northeastward to marker No. 111/277/577, 
located on an unnamed island in the northwestern part of Lake Virma-
jgrvi gzero Tel'ma-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36,7). In this sector the boundary 
crosses Kalatonlampi Pond and Pissipuro Brook. Parelleling the border 
on the Finnish side between markers Nos. 111/259 and 111/275 is a 
forest lane. On the Soviet side two such clearings occur near the 
boundary, but not parallel to it, north of Pissipuro Brook. At some 
places on the Finnish side also there may be more than one clearing., 
Sector No. 4, Lake Virmajgrvi to Marker No. 775: 
From boundary marker No. 111/277/577, the boundary goes along, 
the old Soviet-Finnish line in a northwesterly direction to marker 
No. 578. (The central sector of the old-domain border is between 
boundary markers Nos. 111/277/577 and 775.) At marker No. 578 the 
boundary continues through Lake Virmajgrvi and follows the twists . 
of an unnamed river that flows generally northwest, entering Lake 
Kivijgrvi at marker No. 580. The border then passes through a 
swampy area of sparse woods, crossing the Asumajoki River north of 
marker No. 582. The boundary continues in the same northwesterly 
direction to marker No. 584, at which point it veers sharply to the 
west. At the Vaskijoki River (marker No. 585) it turns again to 
a northeasterly course (Lendery; NP 35, 36-3: 42-63?00'). (On the 
1:250,000 series, a Vaska River is shown here on the Soviet side.) 
From marker No. 586 the border takes a northwesterly course to Lake 
Alinen Aittojgrvi gzero Ayto-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36-3: 42-692), where 
it turns sharply west for a short distance before resuming a north-
westerly direction along the Rajapuro Brook. The boundary then 
.3 
traverses a swampy region as far as marker No. 94, from which it 
passes through Lake Palojgrvi gzero Palo-Yarvi (NP 35, 36-3: 
41-692). From the lake the boundary goes in a northwesterly direction 
to Lake Kartitsanjgrvi gzero Kartsya-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36-3: 41-700), 
which it crosses between markers Nos. 598 and 599. A Kartitat Farm 
is shown on the Finnish side on the 1:250,000 series. Continuing 
the same course, the boundary reaches a small lake, Jerkosenlampi, at 
marker No. 602, continues to marker No. 605, and then extends along 
the middle of the Haapajoki ffhapa-Yoki7 River to Lake Ylinen 
Raapajarvi (marker No. 611). In this area the border passes through 
predominantly swampy land, coniferous forests, and some burned woods. 
From Lake Ylinen Haapajgrvi the boundary goes in a northwesterly 
direction to marker No. 617, then swings to the west, crossing-a 
country dirt road at marker No. 618 (NP 35, 36-3: 407702). At marker

No. 619 it curves through a small lake, Korpilampi, then makes another 
bend before continuing a northwesterly course to marker NO. 624. It 
then follows the Ruokooja /Tuokko-Ioki7 Stream (ditch) (NP 35, 36-3: 
3.2-702), crossing the Lieksanjoki (Lenderka) River between markers 
Nos. T28 and 629. The border then continues in a northwesterly 
direction, intersecting a road or track before reaching Lake Kokko-
jgrvi gzero Kokko-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36-3: 38-702) at marker No. 630. 
The border continues in the same general direction beyond Lake 
Kokkojgrvi (marker No. 632), passin through basically swampy 
terrain interspersed with conifers (probably pine) until it crosses 
a prominent hill, Aittovaara, approximately 300 feet high (marker 
No. 635). Southwest of this point, on the Finnish side, lies 
Aittovaara Farm. Just north of Aittovaara Hill, the border inter-
sects the Tuulijoki 51197 River (NP 35, 36-3: 311701) at marker No. 
6'16. Thence the boundary follows a similar course to the Saari-
jgrvenjoki River before crossing the eastern part of Lake Saari-
jgrvi (NP 35, 36-3: 36-702). From Lake Saarijgrvi the border goes 
in a northwesterly direction, crossing the western section of Lake 
Py8rglampi gzero Pyuri-Yarvi7 (NP 35, 36-3: 36-705) from marker No. 
645. Northwest of this point the border crosses a dirt road (Lieksg-
Repolg) and then extends along the middle of Lake Pitkg Valamojgrvi 
from marker No. 649 to No. 650 (Pirtti-Valamanjgrvi and Saari-
Valaman-jgrvi appear to the southwest and west of the line, respect-
ively) (NP 35, 36-3:30?00T-706). From No. 650 the boundary goes to 
marker No. 655 on the western shore of Lake Otrosjgrvi (Nurmes; NP 35, 
36-2: 64-701), where the border comes to a point. A noticeable feature 
of this entire sector of the boundary (Lendery; NP 35, 36-3) is the 
scarcity of roads of any kind. The whole area is dominated by 
swamps, small lakes, and coniferous forests. 
At Lake Otrosjgrvi, the borderturns sharply to the northeast, 
passing Jokivaara, Mtintovaara, and Mgrkgvaara Hills before reaching 
marker No. 660. From No. 660 the boundary traverses another section 
of swampy and forested terrain, trending in a northeasterly direction 
to marker No. 663, torth of Kuusijgrvi (a Lake Kuusijgrvi is to the 
west on the Finnish side) (NP 35, 36-3: 36-708), at which point a road 
or trail intersects the boundary. Continuing to bear in a northeaster-
ly direction, the boundary crosses a small lake (Verkkolampi), a river 
(Rokojoki), and a prominent hill (Pihlajavaara) to marker No. 669 on 
the northern edge of a small lake (Sgrkilampi). This boundary sector 
is in a remote, basically uninhabited, swampy region characterized by 
boggy lowlands. The border follows the same general course until it 
reaches a small lake., Honkalampi (marker No. 671), where it turns once 
again in a northwesterly direction (Lake Vonganjgrvi appears to the 
southwest of the boundary) (Kimasozero; NQ 35, 36-15: 3/-711). The 
boundary then crosses the eastern part of Lake Kaitakiekki TNQ 35, 36-
15: a/-711) at marker No. 672 and pursues the same course to marker No. 
673 (Hutunsilmglampi), where it turns sharply northeastward. At marker

No. 674 the boundary veers northwestward again, crossing a small lake, 
Mahakaslampi, and at No. 675 turns further toward the west, parallel-
ing the Mahakasjoki River as far as marker No. 676. From this point 
the border turns more to the northwest, then at marker No. 677 almost 
due north. It traverses the western sections of two small lakes 
(RUhilampi and Sgrkilampi), then makes another V-shaped bend north-
westward at marker No. 678, intersecting Lake Hoikkajgrvi and the 
Hoikanjoki River, and crosses a trail along the eastern end of Lake 
MaanseIgnjgrvi (NQ 35; 36..15: 36...711). In this sector the boundary 
passes through an area of bogs and a swamp and lake region inter-
spersed with some coniferous forests. Continuing in an irregular 
northwesterly direction, the boundary passes Lake MEntyjgrvi (NQ 35, 
36-15: 36..711). Between markers Nos. 684 and 686 the boundary fol-
lows a northwesterly course that approximates .a straight line for 
a distance of about 5 kilometers (3 miles), crossing Lake Koivaja-
jgrvi. Koivaja Cabin appears to the west of this point (NQ 35, 
30?00'-714). 
North of Lake Koivajajgrvi, at marker No. 686 the border again 
turns to the north-northeast, makes a series of V-shaped bends at 
markers Nos. 687, 688, and 689, and passes through Lake Karanka-
jgrvi from marker No. 690. A Karanga River is shown on the Soviet 
side ($4 35, 36-15: 30?00'-715). Trending slightly to the northwest 
from marker No. 689, the boundary makes another shallow V-shaped 
bend at marker No. 691, crosses a trail, and continues through 
swampy land and coniferous forests. Bending slightly at each marker 
but maintaining a generally northerly course to marker No. 697, the 
boundary intersects another path between markers Nos. 694 and 695. 
At marker No. 697 (Sotkamo; NQ 35, 36-.1)-i.: north of 64030'), south of 
Hyvgnmurronlampi, a small lake on the Finnish side, the boundary turns 
due northeast. In this sector the border passes Honkavaara. Hill and 
Lakes Iso-Lahnajgrvi and Pieni-Lahnajgrvi. At marker No. 698 (near 
Tapionaho), the boundary turns farther to the east before crossing 
Lake Karsikkojgrvi. ?The border intersects only one trail in this 
sector, but as elsewhere in the boundary area it crosses many brooks 
and streams. East of the Karsikkopuro Brook (marker No. 699) the 
border turns slightly more northward to marker No. 700 and again to 
No. 701, situated in Lake Vuokkijgrvi ITzero Kamennoyg (Kimasozero; 
NQ 35, 36-15: 36-711), where it veers northwest to Lake Kivijgrvi 
(NQ 35, 36-15:i 30?00'-717). At marker No. 707 (Kontiovaara Hill), 
the line again turns in a northeasterly direction and at marker No. 
709 reverts to a northwesterly course, intersecting Lake Viiangin-
jgrvi (Pien-Viiankijgrvi) (NQ 35, 36..15: 36..718). It then turns due 
west at a point south of Ala-Mrsgmbjgrvi TN?. 711) The boundary 
then takes a westerly course, passing over a slightly raised area, 
or platform, between markers Nos. 713 and 716, for about 16 kilo-
meters (approximately 9.9 miles). In this section the boundary 
skirts the northern part of Lake Korpijgrvi (Sotkamo; NO. 35, 36-.14:

crossin a trail to the west of marker No. 715. At Kangasaho (marker 
No. 717) the border turns in a northwesterly direction, intersecting 
a dirt road (Raatteese-Vaatanvaara) at marker No. 718 and continuing 
across the middle of Lake Raatejgrvi NI 35, 36_14). At the northern 
end of the lake the boundary turns to the northeast to marker No. 721 
(SaarenmannpEg 'Point), then veers again to the northwest toward 
Syrjgvaaranpuro Brook. This whole sector is swampy, with some conif-
erous woods. 
From Syrjgvaaranpuro Brook (marker No. 723) the boundary traces 
a shallow curve to marker No. 726, from which it continues in a north-
northwesterly course to Kivipuro Brook (No. 727) before turning to 
a generally northeasterly direction. In this area the border trav-
erses a forested and swampy area, seemingly remote and isolated, 
intersecting a trail north of Ristikangas (marker No. 728). Con-
tinuing along the same generally northeastern course to Yppyransuo 
Swamp, the boundary turns more sharply to the northeast. Near 
Lavgvaara Hill (No. 731), it turns due east and continues to the 
vicinity of Puukonvaara Hill (No. 732). In this area the border 
crosses the Raippajoki and Kirkkelgnjoki Rivers and a path or trail. 
At Puukonvaara the boUndary takes a .general northeasterly-direction 
to marker No. 734, Where it crosses the Venetheitonjoki River. 
Veering sharply northwestwardi the border forms a V before skirting 
around the eastern end of Lake Pirttijgrvi (markers Nos. 735, 736, 
and 737), intersecting a trail north of the lake and continuing on 
to marker No. 738. At marker No. 738 (west of Hautasuonaho) the 
border turns abruptly in a northeasterly direction, crossing Lake 
Hoikkajgrvi, which approximates the location of Ozero Levi on the 
Soviet side (Kuusamo; NQ 35, 36-10: southeast), and continues along 
the same course to marker No. 740 before turning slightly to the 
northwest. In this sector two small lakes are crossed, Aumalampi 
and Lomalampi. At marker No. 740 the boundary crosses the Martin-
joki River in a northwesterly direction, continuing for a distance 
of 1.5 kilometers (about 0.9 mile) before turning gradually in a 
general westerly direction, beginning at marker No. 741. Between 
markers Nos. 741 and 748 the border intersects Haatajanoja Brook, 
goes through a district of small lakes, one of which is Sgrkkalampi, 
and crosses a dirt road (Juntusranta-Lonkka) and an unnamed river 
before turning in a northwesterly direction at Hallavaara Hill (No. 
748). Between markers Nos. 748 and 749 a trail intersects the 
boundary. At marker No. 749 the border turns in a northeasterly 
direction and crosses Lake Kalmojgrvi. From marker NO. 750 (west of, 
Olkivaara Hill), it follows a northeasterly course to No. 752..: In.

northwest of Louhisuo Swamp. From here it takes a straight northerly 
direction for a distance of approximately 15 kilometers (about 9 
miles) to marker No. 755, in the vicinity of Kalliovaara Hill. In 
this sector the border passes Vierivaara Hill and crosses Rytipuro 
Brook, Kgyrghoki River, and two small lakes -- Joutsenpesglampi and 
Karhulampi. From marker No. 755 the boundary extends northeastward 
to marker No. 756, then continues in the same general direction to 
Sarvikivi (No. 757). From here to boundary marker No. 759 the 
border passes through.an area of burned woods and coniferous forests. 
At marker No. 759 (east of Matovaaranpalo and just south of a 
trail intersecting the border), the boundary turns sharply in a 
northwesterly direction, continuing for approximately 8 kilometers 
(about 5 miles) through a remote area of predominantly swampy vege-
tation to marker No. 764. At the western edge of Lake Lattajajgrvi

approximates the location of the Keto River on the Soviet side), and 
extends to Lake Parvajgrvi (No. 768), a distance of about 15 kilo-
meters (approximately 9 miles). From Lake Parvajgrvi (No. 771) the 
boundary takes a southeasterly direction through a lake area to mark-
er No. 774, at which point it turns to the north, making a sharp V, 
and extends to marker No. 775 (Ukhta; NQ 35, 36-11: 30000'-728), the 
last in this section of the old state boundary between the USSR and 
Finland. 
Sector No. 5, Marker No. 775, to the Kuolajgrvi-Kelloselka Road: 
From boundary marker No. 775, the boundary goes in a northerly

Continuing a northwesterly course to boundary marker No. IV/31, 
located on Mount Palovaara, the boundary extends to the southern shore 
of Lake AngerjErvi .gzero Angar-YarvJ7 (NQ 35, 36-11: 30?00,-731). 
Crossing Lake AngerjErvt, the boundary traverses a swamp and bog 
region, intersecting the Munajoki River and a trail at a point 
south of marker No. IV/35. From here the boundary goes in a straight 
line northwest to marker No. IV/38, located 120 meters south of the 
western tip of Lake Huutolampi. On the Finnish side of the border 
in this sector there is some meadowland. At marker No. IV/38 the 
boundary bends in a northeasterly direction to marker No. Iv/424 lo-
cated on a small islet in Lake Pukarinjgrvi /".Ozero Pukari-Yarvi/ (NQ 
35, 36-11:30000'-731), at which point it turns back to a northwesterly 
direction, making a V-shaped bend. From here the border crosses the 
Kuusamo-Pukari Homestead road at marker No. IV/43, then extends in a 
northerly direction, intersecting a trail just south of marker No. 
IV/44. The boundary then continues in a straight line to marker No. 
IV/48, located on Cape Jyrkkaniemi on the southern shore of Lake 
EksymEjErvi (Kuolayarvi; NQ 35, 36-6: southeast corner). In this 
area a trail or path crosses the border south of No. IV/47. The 
boundary bends around a cape in the western part Of Lake Eksymgjarvi, 
forming a dipper, to Marker No. IV/51, located on the north shore of 
Sarkilahti Inlet. To indicate the passage of the boundary line 
along Lake EksymRjErvi, pointers have been set up on boundary-marker 
posts Nos. IV/48 and IV/51 showing the direction of the boundary line 
between Nos. IV/48 and IV/49 and Nos. IV/50 and IV/51. 
From marker No. IV/51 the boundary takes a northwesterly course 
through swampy and boggy terrain with some scattered coniferous 
forests to marker No. IV/54, situated on the south shore of Lake 
SarajNrvi. In this sector a forest lane cuts diagonally across the 
border at marker No. IV/52. From marker No. IV/54 the boundary goes 
in a northeasterly direction to No. IV/551 located on a small islet 
north of the Strait of Hirvassalmi, leaving Kelkkasaari Island, on 
which a village is located, on the Finnish side. A Kelkka-Saari 
Farm appears on the 1:250,000 series (NQ 35, .36-6: southeast corner)

From the Kuusamo-Aittokumpu road (Marker No. IV/67) the boundary 
makes a slight bend, but still going in a northwesterly direction 
crosses Kuntikorvensuo Swamp, a track, and a forest lane (between 
markers No. IV/70 and IV/71), and then continues in a straight line 
to marker No. IV/73, located on a hill south of a small lake, Puuro-
lampi. Continuing in the same direction, the boundary crosses Lake 
Juumajgrvi between markers Nos. IV/75 and IV/76; Lake Ruoppijdrvi is 
on the USSR side and Jumajoki River on the Finnish side (an Ozero 
Yuma-Yarvi and Lake Ruoppijgrvi appear on the 1:250,000 series). 
North of Lake Juumajdrvi the boundary crosses Pirttivaara Hill (a 
Pirttivaara Farm appears on the Soviet side .5Q 35, 36-67) and the 
Kuusamo-Paanajdrvi (Tuutijdrvi) road, at marker No. IV/71. In this 
entire sector the border passes through swamp and meadow interspersed 
with coniferous woodland. The boundary continues in a northwesterly 
direction, crossing the Kuusinkijoki River between markers Nos. IV/83 
and IV/84. At marker No. IV/86 the boundary continues in a straight 
line to the middle of the Oulankajoki River (NQ 35, 36-6), then turns 
westward and follows the middle of the river along a double bend to 
boundary marker No. IV/91. North of marker No., IV/94.the border 
crosses a small lake (Uopajalampi) and then resumes a straight north-
westerly course to marker No. IV/99, located on the summit of Mount 
Suistovaara, after crossing Suorapuro Brook (an Ozero Suora-Yarvi 
appears on the USSR side on the 1:250,000 series), which flows from 
Lake Suistojdrvi. 
From marker No. IV/99 the boundary continues in a northwesterly 
direction to Lake Kuivajdrvi (north of marker No. IV/102), intersects 
two forest lanes, and extends to the Kdyld-Sovajdrvi road (marker 
No. IV/10)-i-). At this point the boundary, continuing in the same 
direction, crosses a trail south of marker No. IV/105, which is 
located on the summit of Mount Korvasvaara, and continues to marker 
No. Iy/lo6 on the south-central shore of Lake Korvasjdrvi (Ozero 
Korvas-Yarvi) (NQ 35, 36-6) 
From Lake Korvasjdrvi the border traverses a predominantly swampy 
and forested areal. intersects a forest lane, and crosses the Kallio-
joki .5allio-Yoki/ River. Between this point and the Hangasjoki 
River dzero Khangas-Yarvi7 (marker No. IV/119), the boundary crosses 
another forest lane (the region is probably one of pines) and passes 
through an area of numerous peat bogs. Continuing in a general north-
westerly direction, the border intersects the Niitselysjoki River (NQ 
35, 36-6) between markers Nos. IV/121 and IV/122_and continues in a 
northwesterly course to marker No. IV/132, located ii the middle of '

middle of the Naataoja Stream (brook), which it follows downstream to 
marker No. IV/141) situated on the southeast tip of Lake Kortakkajdrvi 
(Kartakkojdrvi). The boundary in Lake Kortakkajdrvi starts in a 
northwesterly direction, then goes straight north to marker No. 
IV/143, where it turns due east to No. IV/144. The Kieskisjoki 
River (both the river and a lake of the same name are shown on the 
Finnish side on the 1:250,000 series) flows into Lake Kortakkajdrvi 
at the northwestern shore. From marker No. IV/144, the boundary goes 
in a northeasterly direction to NO. I11/145 at the northeast corner of 
Lake Kortakkajdrvi. Turning in a northwesterly direction, the border 
traverses a region of swampland to marker No. IV/148, located on the 
left side of the Harmusoja. Stream at the point where a brook from 
Lake Haltiojdrvi Bizet? Khaltio-Yarvi7 (NQ 35, 36-6) flows into it. 
From this marker the.border extends in a general northerly direction, 
winding along the middle of the Hatmusoja Stream to marker No. I11/152, 
located on the right side of the stream 21 meters (68.9 feet) south-
west of the place where an unnamed brook flows into it. 
From marker.No. I11/152 the boundary goes in a northwesterly 
direction along a straight line, crossing Kutuoja ditch (brook) at 
marker No. I11/158, then traverses an area of open water, Possoliselkd, 
to marker No. I11/161, located on the western slope of a hill about 
500 meters east of Lake Possolijdrvi ,(Possolijarvi). The border con-
tinues in a northwesterly direction through a remote region to marker 
No. I11/173, located on the left side of Peunaoja Brook (ditch). In 
this sector the terrain consists mainly of swamps, bogs, meadows, and 
some coniferous Woods. A trail intersects the boundary between mark-
ers Nos. I1/167 and IV/168. At No. I1/173 the boundary goes along 
the Peunaoja in a general westerly direction to marker No. I11/176, 
located in the middle of Liinasoja Stream north of its confluence 
with the Peunaoja. From No.. 111/176 the border follows the middle 
of the Liinasoja downstream to marker No. I11/177, located in the . 
middle of the stream where it flows into Lake Onkamojdrvi (NQ 35, 
36-6). The boundary crosses the lake in a northwesterly direction, 
turns slightly to the north, then veers sharply to the northeast 
at marker No. IV/180, and makes a shallow turn at No, I11/181. 
From marker No. IV/183, located on the right bank of Koirankyronoja..

IV/200 to No. IV/204, which is Iodated at the confluence of the 
Pekeloja and Kaulaoja Streams, and to markers Nos. IV/206 and V/1. 
In this part of the Salla sector, 1940 boundary, numerous lanes 
crisscross the border, principally in a southwest to northeast 
direction. It is quite probable that these correspond to the forest 
lanes, or firebreaks, previously mentioned. 
Sector No. 6, KuolajErvi-KelloselkE Road to Mount Puitsitunturi: 
North of marker No. V/1 the boundary crosses the Salla (Kuola-
jdrvi) KelloselkE railroad (probably a 5-foot-gauge, single-track 
line)* and continues in a northeasterly direction along a straight 
line to marker No. V/5, located in a forest 60 meters (196.8 feet) 
southwest of a clearing that intersects the boundary ,in the Sikakangas 
area. From here the border continues in a northeasterly direction, 
turning slightly more to the east, crosses what appear to be three 
winter roads (presumably swamp area traversable when frozen over) 
north of markers Nos. V/7 and V/8, and continues to marker No. V/101 
on the left bank of the Sallajoki 5alla-Yokt7 River (NQ 35, 36-6: 
northern part). In this sector the boundary crosses Kiekioja Brook 
(ditch) between markers Nos. V/8 and V/9. The border thpn extends 
along the middle of the Sallajoki River to marker No. V/11, situated 
on the right bank of the river, before intersecting the KuolajErvi-
Kotala road between markers Nos. V/12 and V/13. In this whole sector 
there are numerous forest lanes on both sides of the border. 
From marker No- V/13 the boundary goes in a northeasterly course 
to No. V/19, located '436 meters (1,430 feet) northeast of its inter-
section with a path northeast of Koltaanharju Ridge. 'Again, a number 
of forest lanes intersect the boundary, as well as a winter road

easterly direction to the KUUmeojal(Nayayaarmeoy) Stream, between 
markers Nos. V/38 and V/39, and then on to marker No. V/44, located 
on the northwest slope of Nilitunturi* in a part of the forest where 
there are few trees. From this point the border follows a north-
easterly course along the Satsijoki River between markers Nos. V/48 
and V/49, intersecting a clearing at marker No. V/50. The boundary 
then crosses Lake SatsijUrvi (at marker No. V/51), continues to 
marker lb. V/O in a general northeasterly direction, and then bends 
along the middle of the Tenni8 Joki (rennitijoki) River (NQ 35; 36.-2) 
to marker No. V/83, situated in the middle of the river. This marker 
is approximately 6.4 kilometers (about 4 miles) southwest of the 
intersection of the boundary by the Sorsajoki River (No. V/92). A 
small lake, Siutoivalampi, appears on the Finnish side of the border 
an the 1:250,000 series. Between markers Nos. V/85 and V/86 a forest 
lane cuts diagonally across the boundary. 
From the Sorsajoki River the border extends in a northeasterly 
direction, crossing a clearing south of maiker No. V/95 and con-
tinuing on to marker No. V/99, located at the edge of the forest 276 
meters (905.5 feet) from a rather high elevation (about 1,600 feet) 
on the Finnish side. Continuing along a general northeasterly course 
the border crosses a lane at marker No. V/102 and continues to No. 
V/105, located on the right bank of the Tuntsajoki gUntsa-yoki7 
River CR 35, 36??2) 40 meters (131 feet) from the shoreline. From 
here the boundary goes in a north-northeasterly direction to 
Jaurakkioja (Jaurukkioja) Stream (No. V/109) and then on to marker 
No. V/122, at which point it crosses Luuntaittumaoja Stream (a 
Luuntaitt Streams or Brook, is shown on the Finnish side on the 
1:250,000 series). The boundary continues in a northeaqterly di-
rection in a straight line from Luuntaittumaoja (marker No. V/122) 
to marker No. 857, located on Mount Puitsitunturi on the old state 
boundary between the USSR and Finland (Kandalaksha; NQ 35, 36...3:

swampy land and crosses a small unnamed lake between boundary markers 
Nos. V/124 and V/125. 
Sector No. 7, Mount Puitsitunturi to Korvatunturi Mountain: 
At marker No. 857, the boundary makes a V turn in a north-

of marker No. 858. At Mount Nuorttitunturi (No. 858), the boundary 
turns slightly more to the north but continues a generally north-
westerly course, passing through swan regions and areas of coniferous 
forests to marker No. 859, Korvatunturi Mountain (Virtaniemi; NR 35, 
36-11: 52-.755). In this sector the boundary crosses the T6rmdoja 
(Tbrmajoki) and Nuortljoki (Nuorttijoki) Rivers (IQ 35, 36-2), 
Korvuspuolivaara Hill, and an unnamed brook south of marker No. 859. 
Korvatunturi Mountain is approximately 12.5 kilometers (about 8 miles) 
north of Nuortljoki River. 
Sector No. 8, Korvatunturi Mountain to Krokfjell Mountain: 
In this extreme northern area -- the Pechanga sector (Murmanskaya 
Oblast) -- the boundary line is identical with the pre-1917 border, 
which is the same as that between the former Grand Duchy of Finland 
and Tsarist Russia.* From marker No. 859 the boundary continues in 
a northwesterly direction to the Jaurijoki ffauri-Yokg River (NR 35, 
36-11: 51-756), a distance of approximately 23.5 kilometers (about 
14.6 miles). In this heavily wooded sector the border passes through 
some swampland and crosses several streams. Continuing in the same 
directiOn for a few kilometers the boundary reaches TalkkunapER Point 
(NR 35, 36-11: 56-756) (elevation approximately 2,000 feet) before 
turning in a north-northwesterly direction. Talkkunapdd and the 
surrounding territory are shown on the 1:250,000 series as a barren 
area devoid of woodland (possibly an area of bedrock). 
From here the boundary extends for about 8 kilometers (5 miles) 
to the Aaddar (Anterijoki) ffnteri=Yok17 River (NR 35, 36-11: 
56-751), crosses the river, and continues in a northwesterly direction, 
intersecting several small streams flowing from a group of lakes on 
the Finnish side, principally Lake KlertamdjUrvi. North of this 
sector the boundary passes through a zone of birch brush. The 
1:250,000 series shows another area similar to that of Talkkunapdd 
minus the forested cover of the surrounding region. The boundary 
follows the same northwesterly course for about 6.5 kilometers (about 
4 miles), at which point it crosses the Lutto 2Tutto-Yoki7 (NR 35, 
36-..11: 56-75.2). On the northwestern shore of the river, on the 
Finnish side, is Raja Jooseppi Hut, where the border intersects a 
main winter road. Two trails also appear to the southeast of the 
river, on the Soviet side. The boundary continues in a northwesterly

arctic mountain, Konnostunturi (NR 35, 36...11: 56..762), situated in 
a birch-shrub zone at an elevation of about 1,300 feet. In this 
sector the boundary crosses the Kirvausjoki River and the southeastern 
tIp of Lake Bippitjdrvi (Kiepsajaur) leaving most of Lake Madsashjaur 
Pzerb Madsash-Yani7 on the Soviet side. A trail intersects the -

through a region of lakes, intersects a stream flowing from Lake 
SuikusjErvi (NR 35, 36...11: 56-76a), and reaches the base point of 
the Finnish-,Soviet boundary at marker Na. A144,* which is set in a 
clearing on rocky ground 977.4 meters (3,206 feet) north of boundary 
marker No. A/43 (fixed by demarcation documents in 19)4.5). The

crosses a swamp before reaching marker No. A/56, located in a rocky 
clearing on a slight elevation. '1Maintaining a west-northwest course, 
to marker No. A/57, the boundary intersects Lake Kottilampi, then 
continues to a height east of the shore of Lake VipujErvi (Tshuhts-

southwestern slope of an el&ation with a benchmark at 210.6 meters 
(about 691 feet) to marker No. A/100. Continuing in a northeasterly 
direction for about 3.7 kilometers (approximately 2.3 miles) to 
marker No. A/105, the boundary passes through a number of depressions, 
crosses a wooded footpath, and intersects an unnamed stream. Between 
markers Nos. A/105 and A/109 the boundary follows a direct cut-through 
northeast, crossing a few depressions and unnamed elevations. From 
marker No. A/109 the boundary, continuing in a northeasterly course, 
crosses a swampy depression to marker No. A/110, situated in a

Luppojarvenlompolo. The boundary then intersects Lake Luppojarven-
lompolo, crosses a ravine (at marker No. A/113), and descends along 
the northeastern slope of an unnamed elevation to marker No. A/116. 
In this sector of approximately 3.6 kilometers (about 2.2 miles), 
the border passes through a swampy depression and a small unnamed 
lake. From marker No. A/116 the boundary follows a direct cut-through 
northeast to marker No. Aj117, then crosses an unnamed stream and a 
number of rocky depressions and spurs of Krokfjell Mountain to the 
Krokfjell boundary marker (69003'11"N-28055'50"E), marking the tri-
junction of the Soviet, Finnish, and Norwegian boundaries. 
C. Boundary Marking, Administration and Security  
The boundary line between Finland and the Soviet Union in the 
territory between the Gulf of Finland and the trijunction of the 
frontiers of Finland, Norway, and the USSR is in most places marked 
by two boundary posts of wood, stone, or masonry or by two stone 
mounds, one on each side of the boundary, usually 2.5 meters from the 
line.* In some instances, one stone mound or wooden post whose center 
coindides with the actual boundary line is used. Along much of the 
pre-1940 border the markers are cairns and natural stones or rocks. 
In the entire 43.3 kilometers (26.9 miles) of the boundary in the 
Yaniskoski-Niskakoski,area (1947 cession) are 74 markers, of which 
4 are stone, 69 are pairs of wooden posts, and 1 is a three-posted 
marker. Boundary markers are located at all important spots, such as 
railroad and road crossings (Figure 19), inhabited areas, and the 
shores of the principal water bodies. In some straight stretches of 
the boundary the posts are 1 or 2 kilometers apart, in other sections 
they are 5 kilometers apart, and in sparsely populated regions they

are within visible range,of one another. The last arrangement is 
especially common along the old-domain border.. Turning-point markers 
of wood or stone, 60 centimeters (about 2 feet) high; are placed on 
the boundary line where it departs from a straight line. 
The course of the land boundary in forested areas is indicated 
by a clearing on each side of the border. The width of this cleared 
strip in the Sella and southeast sectors (the 1940 boundaries) is 5 
meters (16.4 feet) on each side, or a total width of 10 meters. In 
the ?central and upper sectors (the old-domain borders) and in the 
Yaniskoski-Niskakoski region the boundary strip is 4 meters (13.12 
feet) wide on each side of the line, measured from the boundary to 
the tree branches. 2.3./ A Finnish-Soviet agreement of 1949 provides 
that this strip shall be kept in proper condition and cleared of 
brushwood and other growth interfering with visibility. 2,2/ 
In sectors where the boundary crosses lakes, rivers, or streams 
the line is marked by two posts or two stone mounds, one on each 
shore or one on one shore and one on an island. In certain instances, 
three posts, situated at various distances from each other, denote 
the transition of the boundary line from a land to a water sector 
(or from water to land). According to the survey agreement for the 
1934 old-domain boundary, which is presumably applicable also to the 
1940 boundary, whenever a sector that passes through a body of water 
has not been clearly defined, the following principles are to be 
applied: If the boundary follows a river in which the main channel 
can be determined, the line extends along the deepest channel bed 
(the thalweg). In the smaller rivers, the boundary line runs in 
such a manner that at mean water level each point is at an equal 
distance from the shore of each country, figured from the nearest 
spot on the mainland on each side or on an island or rock that is 
permanently above water level.. Where it runs through a lake, the 
boundary is a straight line connecting the points at which the land 
boundary touches the edges of the lake. Ownership of islands or 
rocks by one country or the other is determined with reference to 
the boundary line. If a river or stream that formerly Constituted a 
natural boundary changes its channel, the boundary remains as origi-
nally determined. In cases where changes in the shores threaten to 
shift the river channel or the water course, the state that would 
suffer damage or inconvenience from such a shift has the right to take 
preventive measures. 2?./ 
The enumeration of markers of the 1940 boundary is from south 
to north according to sectors. The numbers of the boundary markers 
are written as fractions, of which the numerator (designated by a 
Roman numeral) represents the number of the sector and the denominator 
(an Arabic numeral) is the serial number of the boundary markr. The

old-domain boundary markers are designated by Arabic numeral only; 
and numbers of the markers in the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area are 
preceded by the letter A. 
The height of the boundary posts above the ground is 2.06 meters 
(6.75 feet). The cross section of the posts is a square 22 centi-
meters (8.6 inches) on a side, 2.7./ except on the old-domain boundary, 
where the cross section is 20 centimeters (7.8 inches) square. Each 
post is capped by a pyramid. To increase the stability of the posts, 
two crosspieces, approximately 80 centimeters (2.6 feet) long, are 
nailed at right angles to the bottom part of each post on the 1940 
border but not on the old-domain boundary. The posts are set about 
1 meter below the surface of the ground. Buried under the center 
point of each post on the 1940 boundary are pieces of glass, charcoal, 
or 5 stones; under those of the old-domain boundary a bottle, char-
coal, or 5 stones are placed. A mound of earth 14 centimeters (5.5 
inches) high is built up around each post and covered by turf, brick, 
or stone. Water moldings around the bottom of the posts are used 
on the 1940 boundaries only. 
On the Finnish side, the posts were originally painted all white. 
In 1949, however, with Soviet approval, the Finns changed to stripes 
of white and "official" blue. In all sectors of the Finnish boundary, 
the posts are probably now painted with horizontal blue and white 
stripes, 19 centimeters (nearly 8 inches) in width. On the Soviet 
side, the posts are painted with alternate vermilion and green hori-
zontal stripes the same width as the sides of the post. Thus painted, 
the posts on both sides of the border should be clearly visible when 
the ground is covered with snow. 
On some of the markers on the Finnish side the numbers are 
painted with black enamel directly on the posts. In other sections 
of the boundary, a sheet-metal plate measuring 15 x 16 centimeters 
(5.9 x 6.3 inches) is attached to each post. This plate is treated 
with rust preventive and painted white with black enamel numbers. 
On all sections of the boundary facing the Soviet Union, boundary 
shields or plaques are attached to the posts 7 centimeters (2.75 
inches) from the lower edge of the pyramid. .These boundary plaques 
are made of cast iron with black edges and a base of red enamel on 
which Finland's coat-of-arms (the lion) is embossed and painted in 
gold. On the USSR posts is the Russian emblem, a wreath surround-
ing the hammer and sickle. In the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area, 
boundary-marker numbers on the wooden posts are black on a white back-
ground on the Finnish side and white on a green background on the 
Soviet side. Turning-point markers are painted white wherever possi-
ble, but stone or masonary posts are unpainted.

Maintenance of boundary markers (wooden and stone posts, earth 
and stone mounds, signs of alignment, and others) in such a way that 
their location, appearance, form, size, and coloring conform to all 
requirements has been agreed to by Finland and the USSR. The care of 
boundary markers is divided between the two countries. Each country 
maintains the markers on its own territory; responsibility for those 
placed exactly on the line of the land frontier is divided, the even-
numbered markers being cared for by the USSR and the odd-numbered by 
Finland. In case of loss, destruction, or damage of a boundary mark-
er, the nation on whose territory such a marker is located or to 
whom it is assigned shall take immediate measures for its restoration 
or repair. 
The boundary between Finland and the USSR is a "closed border." 
This means that boundary crossings are restricted to the minimum. 
The Soviet Union is meticulous in securing the inviolability of its 
own side of the border, and it has concluded precise agreements 
with Finland regarding the frontier zone. A belt of land 7 kilometers 
(4.4 miles) wide along the border on the Soviet side is under the 
absolute control of the of the' Interior. 
Adjacent to the 7-kilometer belt is a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) zone 
that can be entered only with special police permission. 
The attitude of the Finns toward the problem of guarding the 
border is quite different from that of the Soviets. It would be 
considered a restriction of individual liberty to prevent Finnish 
civilians from living in close proximity to the border. Because of 
the geopolitical position of Finland, however, the Government does all 
it can to prevent illegal border crossings by its nationals and has 
placed warning signs along the roads (Figures 20 and 21). An example 
of its efforts to prevent violations of the Soviet boundary is a 
recently built 5-1/2-foot-high reindeer fence that extends for 390 
miles along the Lapland section of the Finnish-Soviet border. (The 
exact termini of the fence are not known.) 
The need for a Finnish border guard first arose-when Finland 
succeeded in obtaining its independence. A civil frontier patrol 
was then established, which was later integrated into the Finnish 
armed forces. During World War II the Finnish Border Guard was used 
as the backbone for the organization of new military units (Figure 
22). 
The present Border Guard is composed of regular army officers 
and volunteers who are directly under the operational control of the 
Minister of interior. The Guard is commanded by a major general of 
the Finnish Army, located in Helsinki, who is assisted by a head-
quarters staff of 56 persons. The total strength of the Border Guard

is believed to be 4,083 (all ranks), with its main concentrations in 
the following areas: (1) Southeast Finland (Karelian frontier); (2) 
northern boundary of Porkkala enclave; (3) Northeast Finland (Soviet 
frontier); (4) western sectors along Norwegian and Swedish borders. 
The nucleus of the Border Guard consists of personnel With long 
service who have joined the Guard on completion of their military 
service but before reaching 30 years of age. These men must have at 
least an elementary-school education, must join the Guard for a 
minimum of 1 year, and must belong to the Army Reserve. Conscripts 
may be assigned to service with the Border Guard instead of with the 
Defense Forces, and are usually stationed near their respective 
home districts. Officers and noncommissioned officers may be detached 
from the Defense Forces for duty with the Guard. Recruits for the 
Border Guard are frequently obtained through newspaper advertising. 
The functions and activities of the Border Guard are prescribed 
by laws and regulations pertaining to the Guard itself and by other 
legislation on related matters, such as the border zone. Some of 
the principal duties of the Guard are: (1) the surveillance of the 
boundary and prevention and reporting of unauthorized crossings; 
2) prevention and detection of contraband traffic across the border; 
3) the prohibition of any activities in the border zone which may 
create border incidents; (4) care and maintenance of boundaries, 
boundary fences, boundary zones, and boundary markers and monuments; 
(5) responsibility for maintaining liaison with the border officials 
of a neighboring country; and (6) the settlement of border disputes 
and incidents with neighboring border authorities. 
The Finnish Border Guard is under orders not to observe any 
happenings on the Soviet side of the border, but merely to safeguard 
the border from violation from the Finnish side. They are interested 
primarily in activities that are directed against or might be harmful 
to the security of Finland. 
Radio communication is maintained between headquarters and units 
of the Border Guard, which in turn have subsidiary radio nets down 
to companies and posts. At present there are 132 radio stations in 
operation, 105 in the Coast Guard and 27 in the Border Guard. Head-
quarters and lower echelons are connected by private telephones. 
Telegraphic communications and visual signals are utilized whenever 
possible. 
Transportation needs of the Border Guard are met by making use 
of bicycles, horses, carts (600-pound, 1-horse, 2-wheeled), passenger 
cars, 2-1/2- or 3-ton trucks, and man-drawn"boat sledges" during the 
winter. Skis are standard equipment for all land-based Guard units.

The USSR guards its border with Finland primarily by patrolling. 
Soviet patrols have been observed along the entire length of the 
border, even in the most remote sections. In winter, members of 
such patrols wear white snowsuits and are equipped with skis. The 
complement of a patrol in the northern area is usually 1 non-
commissioned officer and 3 or 4 men, but occasionally it may have 
ag many as 6 or 7 men. In the summer, Soviet patrols have been ' 
known to make their rounds after midnight, accompanied by trained 
dogs. Each boundary post is inspected by the patrol. (Figure 23.) 
The Soviet Border Guard is perpetually alert, suspicious, and 
highly disciplined. Over-all training includes the art of forming 
ambuscades, as well as the careful observation of occurrences on the 
Finnish side of the border. 
Soviet lookout posts supplement the patrols. It has been 
reported that in the Petsamo border region and farther south in the 
Salla area lookout posts are so numerous that they seem to form an 
unbroken chain. A perpetual watch is maintained in important areas, 
such as those where there are roads, but not in the more remote 
regions. The security of the Arctic Highway, which is within the 
frontier zone, is the responsibility of the MGB Border Guards 
(pogranichniki), and the zone here is well patrolled. 
In the more thickly populated areas along the southern sector 
of the boundary, 5-foot barbed-wire barriers have been erected. In-
formation is not available to indicate the length of this fence or 
the length of the gap between it and the recently built Finnish 
reindeer fence. It was noted recently, however, that Soviet defense 
activities on all Finnish borders have been speeded up. 
D. Maps of the Boundary 
The exact location of the present Finnish-USSR boundary is best 
shown on the official demarcation maps. Those of the Mixed Boundary 
Commission (1 and 2 in list at end of section) show the exact position 
of the boundary line and topographic detail within the boundary strip. 
The five sections of the boundary involved in the terms of cession 
under the Treaty of Peace of 1940 are shown on the following sheets 
of the 1:20,000 demarcation map (1): Section 1, sheets 1/1--I/4; 
Section 2, sheets 11/1-11/5; Section 3, sheets 111/1-111/6; Section 
4, sheets IV/1-IV/7; Section 5, sheets Vii-V/4. Sections 1 throuh 
3 depict the 1940 border from the Gulf of Finland (marker No. Ill 
to Lake Virmagrvi (marker No. 111/277/577) on the "old domain" bor-
der (those sectors of the Finnish-Soviet boundary not affected by the 
1940 changes). Sections 4 and 5 show the 1940 boundary from marker 
No. 755 (IV/1) on the old-domain border at Lake Kinnusengrvi to

marker No. 857 at Mount Puitsitunturi (north of marker No. V/125), 
the Salla sector. The coverage of the border area. at the scale of 
1:25,000 (2) (Sheets 16 through 38, and 51 through 54) shows the 
course of the boundary in the central sector (markers Nos. 577 to 775) 
and the upper sector (markers Nos. 857 to 859) of the old (pre-1940) 
Finnish-Soviet border. 
Official large-scale demarcation maps are not available for the 
section of the boundary from Kbrvatunturi (marker No. 859).to the 
initial marker of the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski border (No. A/44) and 
then to Krokfjell, the meeting point of the present territories of 
the USSR, Norway, and Finland. The border in this northernmost 
region ifs identical with the pre-1917, boundary with the exception 
of the area of the 1947 cession (Yaniskoski-Niskakoski). Maps at 
smaller scales (3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) were used in describing this 
portion of the boundary. 
Two Army Map Service series at 1:250,000 (3 and 7) together 
cover the entire Finnish-Soviet frontier, and these were Used in 
conjunction with the demarcation and other maps, although their use-
fulness is limited because of the small scale. 
The land boundary in the 1940 Finnish-Soviet frontier of the 
Karelian sector is given in great detail on 5 Finnish sheets at 
1:100,000 (8). However, the 21 border strips show the Finnish side 
of the boundary only, and orientation is difficult. 
Large-scale Soviet maps produced since the USSR acquired Pechenga 
and Yaniskoski-Niskakoski are not available. The present south-
western boundary of the Pechenga area (identical with the pre-1917 
boundary of the Grand Duchy of Finland) is shown on a 1:200,000 map 
(4), but essential detail is omitted. 
The entire ceded area in the extreme northern section of the 
boundary (Yaniskoski-Niskakoski) is portrayed on the Finnish 
1:100,000 photostats (6), whereas on the 1950 printed sheets (5) only 
the Finnish side is presented. 
The official demarcation maps are supplemented by descriptive 
protocols.

III. Poland-USSR Border  
A. History of the Boundary  
At the close of World War I in November 1918, with the endorse-
ment of the victorious Allies, Poland became an independent republic. 
The Paris Peace Conference in 1919 provided for the establishment 
of the western and southern boundaries of Poland, in general along 
ethnic lines. The eastern boundary presented more of a problem 
because of the mixed nature of the population in that area. In 
December 1919 the Supreme Council of the Allied Powers set a line 
within which the Polish Government could organize its administration. 
This boundary became known as the "Curzon Line" the following year, 
when Lord Curzon proposed that it become the armistice line between 
Polish and Soviet forces.* Before the Supreme Council's announcement, 
two alternative lines had been suggested as southern extensions of 
the provisional boundary,through Eastern Galicia. One of these ran 
to the east of L'vov (Lwow), thus including that town in Poland; the 
other ran a considerable distance to the_west of L'vov. ?Neither of 
these two lines was embodied in the Supreme Council's December 1919 
boundary, but the eastern line was shown on the map accompanying the 
announcement and later was popularly accepted as part of the Curzon 
Line. The present boundary is in some respects similar to the 
alternative western line. 28, 29; 30/ 
Drawn on ethnic principles, the Supreme Council line excluded 
from Poland large areas inhabited by Lithuanians, Belorussians, and 
Ukrainians. The Supreme Council, however, intended only that this 
line should describe the minimum eastern extension of Poland; it 
was not the purpose to prevent the Polish and Soviet Governments 
from agreeing upon a final boundary farther to the east. The Polish 
Government had, in fact, insisted upon the territorial limits of 1772 
(before the first partition of Poland), and after Polish forces de-
feated the forces of Soviet Russia, Poland received most of its claims 
by the Treaty of Riga, 18 March 1921. In accordance with Article 2 
of the Treaty of Riga, the eastern frontier was to follow plans 
drawn up by the Polish-Soviet Delimitation Commission and men-
tioned in the General Final Protocol of the Commission signed 31 
July 1922. 2/ The new boundary of Poland ran southeast from the 
Latvian frontier, then generally due south, passing about 29 kilo-
meters (18 miles) west of Minsk then some 113 kilometers (70 miles) 
east of Pinsk. In the neighborhood of Ostrog the line turned slight-
ly southwest and continued in that direction for some 40 kilometers 
.*The Curzon Line is also in part identical with the western bor-
der of the Polish territories annexed by Russia in the Third Partition 
of Poland in 1795.

(about 25 miles). Then it turned due south again to the Zbrucz 
River, which it followed to its junction with the Dniester ffinestr7. 
In Paris in March 1923, the Conference of Ambassadors of the 
Principal Allied and Associated Powers recognized the boundary line 
as delimited by the two countries on 23 November 1922. 32/ 
At the close of the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, the Polish 
Government seized the Wilno region from Lithuania, later incorporat-
ing it into Poland. In 1923 the Conference of Ambassadors officially 
allotted Wilno to Poland, ?an act that touched off a controversy be-
tween Poland and Lithuania that continued until 1938. 
On 23 August 1939, the USSR concluded a nonaggression pact 
with Germany, and on 1 September Hitler invaded Poland, precipi-
tating World War II. On 17 September 1939 the Soviet armies crossed 
the eastern frontier of Poland, and by the end of the month the 
German-Soviet conquest of Poland was complete. The treaty signed on 
28 September 1939 by Foreign Ministers von Ribbentrop and Molotov 
defined a common German-Soviet frontier resulting in the fourth 
partition of Poland. la/ The Ribbentrop-Molotov line ran due west 
from the tip of Lithuania to the frontier of East Prussia, giving 
Germany the city and district of Suwa/ki. The line continued along 
the East Prussian frontier to Ostrc4eka, then southeast to the Bug 
River, along the Bug via Brest (Brest-Litovsk) to Krystynopol', 
a town north of L'vov, and then almost due west to the San River, 
which it followed to its source on the border of Ruthenia. 321/ 
In October 1939, the USSR ceded to Lithuania the disputed territory 
of Wilno.*

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Big Three 
(Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin) agreed that Poland's eastern 
boundary should be moved westward from its prewar line to the old 
Curzon Line of 1919, with some digressions in favor of Poland. 12/ 
For this loss of territory to the USSR, Poland was to be compensated 
at the expense of Germany. At the Potsdam Conference (2 August 1945) 
the Big Three agreed to terms whereby Poland lost approximately 
70,000 square miles of its prewar territory in the east to the USSR 
and received provisionally about 40,000 square miles in the west from 
the former German provinces of Silesia, Pomerania, and East and West 
Prussia. The northern part of East Prussia was placed under Soviet 
administration and the southern part under Polish administration.

pending the final determination of territorial questions at 
the peace:settlement the section of the western frontier of 
Soviet Socialist Republics which is adjacent to the Baltic 
Sea should pass from a point on the eastern shore of the Bay 
of Danzig to the east north of Braunsberg-Goldap (Braniewo-
GoXdap), to the meeting point of the frontiers of Lithuania 
and East Prussia. 
Regarding Poland's western frontier and southern East Prussia it was 
stated that --
pending the final determination of Poland's western frontiers 
the former. German territories east of a line running from the 
Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinemunde (Swinioujscie), and 
thence along the Oder River to the confluence of the western 
Neisse River and along the western Neisse to the Czechoslovak 
frontier, including that portion of East Prussia not placed 
under the administration of the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics in accordance with the understanding reached at 
this conference and including the area of the former free City 
of Danzig, shall be under the administration of the Polish 
State. 
On 16 August 1945 Poland and the USSR concluded at Moscow a 
treaty on the Polish-Soviet frontier, as well as an agreement on the 
question of compensation for damages caused by the German occupation. 
The new state border as described in this treaty followed the Curzon 
Line and the westernmost of its southern extensions through former 
Eastern* Galicia with the exception of a few deviations of 5 to 30 kilo-
meters (3 to 18.5 miles) each; The principal deviations were in the 
vicinity of Grodno and Przemys11,where they were in favor of the Soviet 
Union, and in the Jalowka-Niemirow sector and the area along the 
Western Bug and Sohkija Rivers south of the town of Kry/aw, where 
they were in favor of Poland. 37, 38/ Northeast of Suwalki the new 
line corresponded with the prewar Polish=Lithuanian boundary. The 
treaty further stated that, pending a final peace conference, in 
conformity with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference part of the 
Polish-Soviet frontier adjoining the Baltic Sea was to pass from 
the Bay of Danzig eastward, north at' the cities of Braniewo and 
Goldap, to the point where the Polish, Lithuanian, and East Prussian 
boundaries met. Article 2 of the treaty provided for a Mixed Polish-
Soviet Commission for the demarcation of the frontier, with head-
quarters in Warsaw. Upon completion of its work in the field, the 
members of the Commission signed the delimitation documents on 30 
April 1947.

The Polish-Soviet border as delimited by the treaty of 16 
_August 1945_was_slightly-alteredJoy an_agreement signed in Moscow on 
15 February 195d-by-Roland and the Soviet Union, which resulted in 
the-Mutual exchange of 480 square kilometers-(185.3 square miles) 
of territory between the two nations. Poland acquired a strip of 
land near the southernmost section of the Polish-Soviet frontier at 
a point where the San River had been the boundary, including the town 
of Ustrzyki Dolne. The USSR, in turn, received an area of land along 
the So/olija and Bug Rivers to the west of the town of Sokal. 39, 40, 
41 42/ Two agreements were signed by representatives of Poland and 
the USSR in Moscow 8 July 1948, one of which established the princi-
ples to be applied in marking the boundary and the other the organi-
zations and procedures for boundary administration. An agreement 
was signed on 8 December 1951 modifying the 1948 agreements in order 
to conform to the situation created by the two border rectifications 
of that year (see accompanying maps 12698, 12926, and 12757). 43, 44

B. Linear Description of the Boundary  
1. Kaliningrad Oblast and Lithuanian SectOr* 
The boundary between Poland (Polish-administered East 
Prussia) and Kaliningrad Oblast (Soviet-administered East Prussia) 
begins on the Baltic shore of the sand spit, Mierzeja Wislana (Frische 
Nehrung) (see accompanying map 12698). The line crosses this sand 
spit in a straight northwest-southeast line, touching the eastern 
shore at a point about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) north of the Polish 
settlement of Nowa Karczma (Neukrug) (Braunsberg; J-14: 10-34).** 
At the eastern shore of the sand spit, the boundary turns to east-
southeast and crosses the lagoon Zalew Wislany (Frisches Haff) in a 
straight line. 
The boundary intersects the mainland at a point about 2 kilo-
meters (1.2 miles) northeast of the Polish settlement of Pas/eka 
*In the description of this sector of the Polish border, the 
place-name forms are, wherever possible, those used on the side of 
the border on which the place or feature is located. For mAny places 
on the Soviet side, however, the Russian name is not available, and 
in such cases the Polish name, if known, is given, followed by the 
old German name in parentheses. If only the German name is known, 
it is given in parentheses.

(Passarge)* (J-14: 20-733) and just north of the mouth of a small 
stream that runs northeast of and parallels the stream Pasieka 
(Passarge). The boundary continues Overland, crossing the stream 
Omaza about 4 kilometers (2.5 Miles) northwest of the Polish settle-
tent Zelazna Gora (Eisenberg) (J-14: 38-29). In the section from 
the coast to the Omaza, the boundary f's crossed by the Braniewo 
(Braunsberg).-Kaliningrad (KBnigsberg) railroad, the Braniewo-
Kaliningrad main road, and a secondary road leading from the Polish 
settlement of Lipovina (Lindenau) (J-14: 33-24). The boundary also 
crosses the stream Bahnau and for a short distance parallels the 
Mamonovo** (Heiligenbeil)-Tsinten (Zinten) railroad. It is probable 
that very little traffic circulates across the border over any of 
the routes discussed. The following boundary crossings are given in 
west-to-east order: 
(1) A road crosses from Zelazna Gora to Mamonovo. 
(2) The main road (a former Reichsautobahn) from the west to 
.Kaliningrad crosses at a point southwest of the Soviet settlement 
Tyrowo (Thierau) (J-14: 40,-33). 
(3) The Omaza River loops northward near Tyrowo, crossing the 
boundary three times. 
(4) A road from the Polish settlement Of jachcAo (Hanswalde) 
(J-14: 43-28) crosses to Tyrowo and Mamonovo. 
(5) Two small streams cross the boundary south of the Soviet 
settlement (Hermsdorf) (J-14: 46-33). 
(6) South of Tsinten (J-14.: 54-35) the boundary passes just 
sbuth of the junction point of two railroads -- one from the south-
west, from the Polish city of Orneta, the other from the southeast, 
from Lidzbark Warminski; from the junction point the railroad runs 
north to Tsinten, 
*If the policy of evacuating the population for a considerable 
depth on either side of the boundary has been carried out along the 
Polish-Soviet frontier, as has been done along some other Soviet 
frontiers, it is possible that many of the settlements or villages 
mentioned in this description may now be uninhabited. Since March 
1953, however, the Ukrainian authorities have launched a large-scale 
compulsory resettlemeht program in the former Polish-Soviet frontier 
area. 
**Mamonovo is the most recent Soviet name for this town. In the 
earlier years of Soviet occupation, the Soviet name appeared as 
Kheyligenbeyl.

(7),The main Orneta-Tsinten road crosses the border just east. 
of the Orneta-Tsinten railroad. 
In the sector from the coast to the vicinity of Tsinten, 
the boundary traverses low, open country with only a few scattered 
patches of woodland. Many small streams and, near the coast, small 
canals or ditches cross the boundary. Before the boundary was 
established (1945-46), there were about 10 small settlements in the 
border area, and houses and buildings were distributed with fair 
uniformity. The border zone here and elsewhere along the Polish-
Soviet boundary is probably almost uninhabited at present, and it 
is possible that many of the buildings that were near the line have 
been removed. 
From the road and railroad crossings south of Tsinten, the 
boundary line continues in a generally west-east direction. It 
extends for about 23 kilometers (14 miles) to a point some 3 
kilometers r8 miles) south of the Soviet town Bagrationovsk 
(Pr Eylau) Konigsberg; J-15: 77-28). In this section, the following 
roads cross the boundary: 
(1) A road from the Polish settlement Kandyty (Canditten) 
(J-15: 58-20) to Tsinten, a branch of which leads east to the Soviet 
settlement Rassiten (Rositten) (J-15: 62-29). 
(2) Several secondary roads in the Kamiensko Forest (Forst 
Preussisch Eylau) sector, through which the boundary runs for about 
5 kilometers (3 miles) in the area southeast of Rassiten. 
(3) The Olsztyn-Kaliningrad main road, which crosses the bound-
ary southwest of Bagrationovsk. 
The terrain is considerably more rolling and broken in this 
sector than to the east. The Kamiensko Forest occupies high ground 
east of Bagrationovsk, and another large forested tract, apparently 
a detached part of the Kamiensko Forest, is on the Polish side of 
the boundary a short distance south of Bagrationovsk. Prewar settle-
ment in this sector was not quite as dense as to the east, although 
there were many buildings some distance to the north and south of 
the immediate border zone. 
The boundary continues eastward for about 16 kilometers (nearly 
? 10 miles), crossing the Bartozyce (Bartenstein)-Keliningrad main road 
and railroad. It intersects the Bartozyce-Pravdinsk (Friedland) 
railroad and main road near the settlement of Shenbrukh (Schtinbruch) 
(J-15: 92-25). From,south of Shenbrukh the boundary runs eastward 
for about 27 kilometers (16.7 miles) and intersects the Olsztyn-

Chernyakhovsk railroad and the Olsztyn-Znamensk main road about 4 
kilometers 2.5 miles) south of the Soviet town of Zheleznodorozhnyy 
Gerdauen) J-15: 19-24). In this sector the line crosses the kna 
Alle) River about _9 kilometers (5.6 miles) east of Shenbrukh. The 
Polish settlement Lipowo (Lindenau) (J-15: 06-22) lies near the 
boundary about 5 kilometers (3 Miles) east of the kna. From the road 
and railroad intersections south of Zheleznodorozhnyy, the boundary 
Continues in an easterly direction to the town of Nordenbork (Norden-
burg) (Insterburg; J-16: 35-22), Which appears to be on the Soviet 
side of the boundary. 
The boundary sector from ShMbrukh to Nordenbork traverses 
undulating, open land interspersed with small patches of woodland. 
A fairly large woodland area lies on the Soviet side northwest of 
Nordenbork. There were a number of small settlements near this 
sector of the boundary in the prewar period. 
From Nordenbork the boundary approximates a straight line 
bearing slightly north of east to the northern end of the (Goldaper 
See), about 5 kilometers north of Gofdap. In this long sector there 
are now no sizable towns near the boundary, though there were many 
small settlements in the prewar period. West of Nordenbork the bound-
ary crosses the Kanal-Mazurski, which, with its extensions, connects 
Lake Rydzowskie in Poland with the kna River in Soviet territory. 
On the ANS 1:100,000 series this canal is not shown as crossing the 
boundary. ? The boundary crosses the Wegorapa (Angerapp) River about 
8 kilometers (nearly 5 miles) south of the Soviet town of Ozersk 
(Darkehmen) (J-16: 65-31). 
Between Nordenbork and Gofdap the major road and railroad 
crossings are as follows: 
(1) Wegorzewo-ZheleznodorozhnyY railroad crossing, about 4 
kilometers (2.5 miles) east of Nordenbork; 
(2) Wegorzewo-ZheleznodorozhnyY main road crossing at Rauschen-
feld (Reuschenfeld) (J-16: 41-22); 
(3) Wegorzewo-Ozersk (Darkehmen) railroad crossing (J-16: 55-

(6) Go/dap-Gusev (Gumbinnen) main road crossing about 2 kilo-
meters (1.2 miles) southeast of the Soviet settlement Plawiszki 
(eplawischken); 
(7) Gofdap-Nesterov (Stallupdnen) railroad crossing, just west 
of the northern end of the Goldaper See. 
From Nordenbork to the Goldaper See the boundary traverses only 
a few small areas of woodland, mainly in the vicinity of Kowary 
(Kowarren). There are nearby woodland tracts of considerable size, 
however, one in Poland south of Nordenbork and the lake Jezioro 
Nordenborskie (Nordenburger See), and a second, also in Poland, south 
of the place where the WTgorapa River crosses the line. The terrain 
is irregular, and local elevations are fairly high. The boundary 
passes over high ground east of Nordenbork, descends to the valley 
of the WTgorapa, then climbs to the highest elevation in this sector, 
about 180 meters (590 feet), near the Goldaper See. 
From the Goldaper See, the boundary extends eastward through 
a forested area, the Puszcza Romincka (Romintener Hide), for about 
23 kilometers (14 miles) to the vicinity of the Polish settlement 
of Zytkiejmy (Szittkehmen) (Kalvarija; J-17: 10-25). A branch line 
of the Go/dap-Nesterov railroad crosses the boundary just west of 
Zytkiejmy. The boundary apparently follows almost a straight course 
through the forest, slightly north of east. For about 7 kilometers 
(4.3 miles) in the central part of the forest, it parallels a road 
called the Goldaper-Teerbuden Weg on the ANS 1:100,000 series. In 
the western part of the Puszcza Romincka Forest, the boundary is 
crossed by several small streams, and there are a few settlements 
and some cleared land in this area. From the vicinity of Zytkiemy to 
the beginning of the Lithuanian boundary the terrain is open and 
irregular. Outside Zytkiemy and two other smaller settleMents, 
scattered houses and buildings are rather evenly spaced. 
From Zytkiemy the boundary extends for about 7 kilometers in 
an east-northeast direction to the point where it meets the Kaliningrad 
Oblast-Lithuanian SSR boundary, about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) south-
east of the lake J. Wisztynieckie (Wystiter See) and 5 kilometers (3 
miles) west of the Polish settlement of Wizajny (J-17: 21-27). From 
,this junction point the Lithuanian boundary trends northeast for 
approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), then curves around the northern 
end of Lake Wizajny and continues in a direction slightly south of east 
for about 7 kilometers (4.3 miles). The Lithuanian settlement of 
Grafauskai (J-17: 26-32) lies north of the boundary in this section. 
The boundary turns southwest for roughly 3 kilometers, then southeast 
for about 5 kilometers, passing south of the Lithuanian settlement 
of Liubavas (J-17: 32-28). In this section the line is crossed by the

river Sheshupe and by a secondary road leading from the Polish settle-
ment Rutkatartak (J-17: 28-23) to Liubavas. 
In the sector from the trijunction of Poland, Kaliningrad 
Oblast, and Lithuania to the Sheshupe there is considerable high 
ground. Some of the small streams that cross the boundary have 
rather steep-sided valleys, several of which are drained by chains 
of small lakes connected by creeks. There is marshy ground to the 
north-northwest of Jez Wizajny and along the Sheshupe. On the 
Soviet side immediately adjacent to the boundary are several fairly 
large patches of forest. Between two of these, the boundary skirts 
the southern shore of the small lake Dunajewo (J-17: 20-33). Settle-
ment and buildings were rather uniformly dispersed in this sector 
before the war, Liubavas containing the only sizable cluster of 
buildings. A network of secondary roads crossed the boundary, and 
there were apparently open fields in several places along the border. 
From the Sheshupe, the boundary parallels the stream Szelmentka, 
a tributary of the Sheshupe, southwestward' tothe northern end of Lake 
Kupowo, passing to the northeast of a forest tract. The line then 
trends southeast for about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), then curves 
northeastward for about the same distance; in this section it crosses 
the Suwafki-Kalvariya main road. The line runs southward for about 
2 kilometers (1.2 miles), then turns east near the Settlement of 
Trompole (J-17: 42-20), which it apparently passes through. Thence 
it extends in a direction slightly south of east for 2 kilometers, 
then southeast for about 5 kilometers (3 miles). In this section, 
at a point some 4 kilometers northeast of the POlish settlement 
of Punsk (J-17: 42-16), it intersects the railroad from Suwalki to 
Maryampole and Alitus. 
The boundary follows a slightly curving course eastward to 
Berezniki (J-17:'50-16), passes through this settlement, and crosses 
a secondary road to the Polish town Sejny (Druskieniki; K-18: 53-99) 
from Kalvariya. From Berezniki, the boundary follows an irregular 
course in a general southeasterly direction to the northern shore 
of Lake Gafadus, where a road crosses from Poland to the Lithuanian 
town of Lazdiyai (K-18: 64-14). The boundary continues southward 
through Lake Gafadus for about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles), roughly 
half the length of the lake. 
The stream Szelmentka and the lake Kupowo, like the streams 
to the northwest, are in an entrenched valley. After traversing this 
valley, the boundary passes onto an upland of irregular topography. 
There are some marshy areas near the line, and a small lake lies in 
an angle of the boundary near the Lithuanian settlement of Trompole. 
Several small tributaries of the Sheshupe drainage system flow across

the line into Lithuania, and the boundary passes through or near 
a series of small lakes before reaching Lake GaXadus. As in the 
area to the northeast, buildings were rather evenly distributed 
in the prewar period and there was a dense network of secondary 
roads, many of which crossed the boundary. 
From Lake Galadus, the boundary turns eastward on land and 
intersects a secondary road leading from Sejny to Lazdiyai. From the 
point where it crosses this road, the line curves to the south-south-
east then southeast, passing southwest of the Lithuanian settlement 
Janoslavas (K-18: 62-07). The Sejny-Lazdiyai main road crosses the 
boundary a short distance northeast of a small lake, Hozny, on the 
Polish side. The boundary continues in a general southerly direction, 
and after crossing the small lake Bo/oni it intersects the Suwa/ki-
Alitus main road east of the Polish settlement Berzniki (K-18: 61-97). 
The irregular terrain characteristic of the boundary zone 
northwest of Lake Ga/adus continues southeast of that lake to the 
vicinity of the Lithuanian settlement KuCillnai (K-18: 64-02), south 
of which elevations are lower and the surface is smoother. Southeast 
of Lake Ga/adus the prewar buildings were grouped more definitely 
into settlements than to the northwest. 
From the intersection with the Suwa/ki-Alitus road, the bound-
ary extends southwestward through a forested area for about 8 kilo-
meters (5 miles) along a secondary road running south from the 
Lithuanian settlement KlepoCiai (K-18: 69-02). In this forested 
tract the boundary is crossed by a road extending southeastward from 
Sejny by way of Berzniki in Poland to KapnAmiestis (K-18: 74-88) in 
Lithuania. 
The boundary meets the Marycha River at a point some 4 kilo-
meters (2.5 miles) southeast of the Polish settlement Zelwa (K-18: 
60-91) and follows the course of the Marycha for about 7 kilometers 
(4.3 miles) to the point of junction of the boundaries of Poland, the 
Lithuanian SSR, and the Belorussian SSR, southwest of the Lithuanian 
settlement of Grickavas (K-18: 68-85). In this sector the land is 
cleared, and in prewar times buildings were spaced rather closely 
along both banks of the river, but on both the Polish and Lithuanian 
sides extensive forested tracts lie within a short distance of the 
stream. On the Polish side these tracts are part of the large 
forest, Puszcza Augustowska. The valley of the Marycha, where the 
boundary follows it, pnd the areas to the east and west are fairly 
flat and at lower elevations than the boundary zone to the north.

2. Belorussian Sector* 
The sector of the boundary between Poland and Belorussia 
may be divided into two parts. The longer northern section extends 
across land or along small streams from the point of junction of the 
territories of Poland, the Lithuanian SSR, and the Belorussian SSR 
to the Bug River. The second, or southern, section follows the Bug 
to the point where the Belorussian-Ukrainian boundary intersects the 
Polish boundary (see accompanying map 12926). 
The Polish-Belorussian border extends from the trijunction 
of the boundaries of Poland, Lithuania, and Belorussia in a southerly 
direction, bearing slightly to the east, to a point on the Kanal 
Augustowski northeast of the Polish settlement of Rudawka (K-18: 
65-73). In this sector, the boundary traverses a forested area inter-
spersed with clearings. The line continues in a southeasterly 
direction along the Kanal Augustowski to its junction with the stream 
Wo/kuszanka, which the boundary then follows for roughly 4 kilometers 
(2.5 miles). Continuing southward over land, the boundary passes to 
the west of the Soviet settlement of Ho/ynka (K-18: 70-63). Near 
this village the line bends to the southeast, passes to the east of 
the Polish settlement of Rakowicze (Grodno;,L-18: 69-59), and again 
turns southward. After crossing the Augustow-Grodno highway, the 
boundary bears to the southeast, traversing the swampy area along the 
stream Popilja. 
From this area the boundary continues its southeasterly course 
in an approximately straight line for about 20 kilometers (12 miles) 
to the vicinity of the Polish settlement of KuZnica (L-19: 75-34). 
From north to south in this sector, the line intersects the Augustow-
Grodno railroad, the Dabrowa-Grodno main road, the Soko/ka-Grodno 
railroad, and the Sokotka-Grodno main road. The AugustOw-Grodno rail-
road is crossed by the boundary at a point between the Bielany 
railroad station (L-18: 71-48), which is in Poland, and the settle-
ment of the same name, which is in the USSR. The Soko/ka-Grodno 
railroad extends north from Kuznica for a short distance before 
crossing into the USSR. In the vicinity of the boundary the railway 
parallels the stream yososna ZEososna7. 
From near KuZnica to about 33 kilometers (20.5 miles) southeast, 
near the Swisjocz 5vislochq Stream, the boundary again approximates 
a straight line, passing to the east of the Polish settlements of

Nowodziel (L-18: 77-30), Minkowce (L-18: 82-18), and Krynki (L-18: 
84-06). Several secondary roads from the Polish side of the line 
converge on the Soviet settlement Odelsk Lodelisk7 (L-18: 83-22). 
Opposite Krynki, on the Soviet side of the boundary is Porzecze 
(L-18: 89-06). From a point south and east of Krynki the boundary 
turns southeastward, crossing first the Nietupa, a tributary of the 
Swisfocz, and then the Swisfocz itself. Between the two streams the 
ground is swampy. 
The boundary follows the Swisfocz southward (upstream) through 
swampy terrain for some distance. On the Polish side in this sector 
are the settlements of Ozierany Wielkie (Swisfocz.; M-18: 90-00), 
Bobrowniki (M-18: 93-91)1 and Swisfoczany (M-18: 92-86); on the Soviet 
side is the settlement Hofynka and fdolynka7 (A-18: 94-97). Between 
Bobrowniki and Swisfoczany the boundary stream is crossed by the main 
road and the railroad between Biafystok and Volkovysk. 
The Swisfocz rises in Soviet territory and flows first to the 
southwest, then makes a sharp turn to the northwest., At the turning 
point the boundary leaves the' stream and continues in a generally 
southerly direction to the Hajnowka-Volkovysk railroad (M-18: 97-72), 
passing to the east of the Polish settlement Jafowka (A-18: 95-78) . 
and intersecting the railroad southwest of the Soviet settlement 
Niezbodzicze ffiezbodichf (M-18: 99-74). The boundary parallels the 
railroad for a short distance in a southwesterly direction, then turns 
south, crossing the Kofonna Stream and the marshy ground along it. 
From the Kofonna area, the boundary enters the Biafawieska 
Forest, through which for a considerable distance it trends southward 
and southwestward. It crosses an area of cleared land within the 
forest around the Polish settlement of Masiewo (M-18: 96-58), 
then continues southward to a point east of the Polish settlement 
Biafowieza (Hajnowka; N-18: 93-44). Here it take's a general south-
westerly course, passing to the south of Biafowieza. For a, short 
distance the boundary follows the Perewoloka, a tributary of the 
Lena Stream, and then turns briefly to the northwest along the 
Lesna. On leaving this stream the boundary curves in a southwesterly 
direction, emerging from the main part of the Biafowieska Forest some 
distance to the north of the Soviet settlement of Omelaniec Omeleneta7 
(N-18: 73-25). Within the forest the boundary is crossed by several 
narrow-gauge or tramway tracks, probably built for logging purposes. 
These lines radiate out from the vicinity, of the Polish settlements 
of Biafowleza and HajnOwka (N-l8: 74-48) to points on the Soviet side 
of the boundary. 
On leaving the Biafowieska Forest the boundary continues to 
curve in a southwesterly direction. In this sector the line passes

to the east or southeast of the Polish settlements of Czeremcha 
59-22), Klukowicze (Siemiatycze; N-17: 54-10), and NiemirOw 
N-17: 47-96). Another settlement, Tokary (N-17: 52-06), lies across 
the boundary but probably mainly on the Polish side. On the Soviet 
side in this sector are the settlements of Omelaniec, Buszmicze 
ffiushmichi7 (N.,18: 68-21), and Bola /dolyi.7 (N-18: 60-16). The rail-
way between Bielsk-Podlaski and Wysokie Litewskie 5ysoko-Litovsi7 
and the in road between Kleszczele and Wysokie Litewskie cross the
boundary northwest of Hola. 
The southern section of the Belorussian border begins east of 
NiemirOw, where the boundary joins the Bug River. The boundary in 
the Bug is now defined as following the middle of the stream, with-
out reference to the main or navigable channel (thalweg). In many 
instances the middle or median line in the central section of the 
river differs from the central line of the main channel. The allo-
cation of river islands presumably does not differ greatly from that 
agreed upon in 1939-40 between Germany and the Soviet Union. The 
Soviet Union probably retains most of the-islands assigned to it 
in the 1939-40 boundary agreements, and Poland probably holds most 
of the islands then assigned to Germany. The principal road and 
railroad crossings over the Bug River from Niemirow south to the 
Ukrainian border are as follows: 
(1) Road crossing on the JanOw Podlaski-Kobrin route (BrazegC 
nad Bugiem; P-18: 70-85). 
(2) One road and one railroad crossing at Brest, on the Bia/a 
Podlaska-Kobrin route (P-18: 81-75). 
(3) Possibly a minor road crossing at KodeA (P-18: 80-56). 
(4) Crossing by a road running eastward from Radzvn Podlaski 
to the north-south road paralleling the Bug on the Soviet side 
(P-18: 79-)40). 
(5) Road crossing at Wiodawa on the Cheim-Kobrin route (d/odawa; 
Q-18: 78-16). 
(6) Railroad crossing at Orchowo ffrkhovo7 (Q-18: 81-14) on 
the Chem-Brest railway. 
At the time of the 1939-40 boundary survey, apparently the only 
bridges across the Bug on these routes that had not been removed or 
destroyed were the railroad bridge at Brest and the road bridge at 
Koden.

3. Ukrainian Sector  
The boundary between the Ukrainian SSR and the Belorus-
sian SSR joins the Polish-Soviet border on the Bug River several 
kilometers southeast of the Soviet town of Orchowo, to the south-
east of W/odawa (see accompanying maps 12926 and 12757). From this 
point, the Polish-Ukrainian boundary continues to follow the Bug.. 
River generally southward to a point southeast of the Polish town 
of Kry/ow (Sokal; S-18: 92-20), a distance of approximately 169 
kilometers (about 105 miles). In this sector (Figure 24), the 
boundary passes through a region predominantly of swamp or marsh-
land. To the west of the border are the Polish settlements of 
SobibOr (Q-18: 83-08), Zbereze (Q-18: 87-00), Wilka-Uhruska (Q-18: 
83-90), Dubienka (Wodzimierz; R-18: 03-61), and Horod/o (R-18: 
92-44). On the Soviet side lie the settlements of Opalin (Q-18: 
89-87) and Ugc4ug fU7stiluil (R-18: 99-40). Numerous paths and cart 
tracks parallel the river on both sides of the boundary, and a minor 
road crosses the area east of Dubienka. The principal road and rail-
road crossings of the Bug River from W/odawa southward to where the 
boundary leaves the river southeast of Ho/ubie (S-18: 93-15) are 
(1) a main road between Hrubieszow and Whdzimierz gladimir-
Volynskig, crossing at ULIJug, and (2) a railroad crossing on the 
ZamosC-W/odzimierz route (R-18: 08-32). 
The boundary leaves the Bug at a point southeast of Robbie* 
where the generally north-flowing river makes a wide bend, then 
continues southward over land for roughly 7.5 kilometers (about 4.7 
miles). It passes to the east of the Polish settlement of Honiatyn 
(S-18: 93-07), near which the line turns to the southwest for approxi-
mately 19 kilometers (11.8 miles) to a point south of Oserdow (S-18: 
12-92)., where it turns due west. In this sector .the border cuts 
across patches of woodland and is intersected by many paths. 
Continuing a westerly course, then bearing to the southwest, 
the boundary crosses the Rzee.Kyca (Swynoryj.21 Stream and_parallels 
the Rawa Ruska fflava Russkaya/-Krystynopol Krystynopol'/ railroad, 
which is on the Soviet side. Southeast of the Polish settlement of 
NowosiO/ki-Przednie (5-18: 90-86) the border approximates a straight 
line to the south for about 5 kilometers (3 miles), passing the 
Polish towns of WOlka-Wierzbicka (S-18: 91-84) and Wierzbica (S-18: 
90-82). In this area the tributaries of the So/okija cross the bor-
der in a region of considerable marsh and swampland. 
*The boundary line south of Hobbie is described according to 
available documents, protocols, and small-scale maps.

After turning again in a southwesterly direction, the bound-
ary crosses the Szczebrzeszyn-Rawa Ruska rail line (S-18: 86-76), 
passes to the east of the Polish settlement Hrebenne (S-18: 84-75), 
and intersects the main road between Tomaszow Lubelski and Rawa 
Ruska (S-18: 8)1-74). South of Hrebenne the boundary cuts across a 
wooded area, the Rata River (a tributary of the Bug), and the 
LubaczOw-Rawa Ruska rail line (Lwow; T-18: 80-70). From the vicinity 
of the railroad southwest for about 19 kilometers (11.8 miles) to 
a short distance south of the small stream Smolinka, the boundary 
again approximates a straight line. After crossing a wooded area 
interspersed with clearings, a small stream, and a secondary road 
In the vicinity of the Polish village Budomierz (Przemysl; T-17: 
64-54 purple*), the boundary curves in a southwesterly then 
southerly direction. Turning southwestward again east of the Polish 
settlement of 7mijowska (T-17: 58-47 purple), the border crosses the 
Szklo (T-17: 80-69 red) and the Wisznia (T-17: 72-60 red), tributar-
ies of the San River, and passes to the east or southeast of the 
Polish settlements Budzyn (T-17: 79-691red), Zapust (T-17: 75-64 
red), and Medyka (T-17: 63-51 red) to a point east of the Polish 
village of Siedliska (T-17: 59-47 red). On the Soviet side of the 
boundary in this sector are the settlements Gnojnice ffinoenyetzg 
78-66 red), Zahorby (T-17: 72-60 red) and Bucow ffiukov7 
T-17: 67-54 red); the settlement Starzawa Ataryavg (T-17: 71-59 
red) is on the border but mainly in Soviet territory. The railway 
and main road between Przemygl and LwOw LETvoV7 cross the boundary 
east and south of Medyka. 
From Siedliska the border goes to the south as far as a point 
east of Pod Luczycami (Sambor; U-17: 56-45), where it again takes a 
southwesterly course to a peak (elevation about 2,000 feet) south-
east of the Polish Settlement Jureczkowa (U-17: 37723).** In this 
area the boundary twice crosses the Wiar Stream, a tributary of the 
San River, at_points.northeast and southwest of the Soviet town of 
Nizankowice LNizhankovichi7 (U-17: 53-38). It also intersects 
numerous_paths and the railroad and Main road between Przemysl and. 
Chyrow Inlyrog (U-17: 53-40). A number of linear settlements built 
along streams cross the border in this sector.

From the forested peak southeast of Jureczkowa, the boundary 
makes a sharp V-shaped turn and extends in a southeasterly direction 
for approximately 7.5 kilometers (about 4.7 miles), intersecting 
the Ustrzyki Din (Dolne)-Chyrow railroad and main road northwest 
of the Soviet village Smolnica (U-17: 45-16). The boundary then 
continues in a general southerly direction, curving slightly, to a 
point east of the Polish settlement of Michniowiec (U-17: 44-96). 
In this sector the border crosses numerous streams and passes through 
scattered forest areas at elevations from 2,000 to 3,500 feet. 
From a point south of the vicinity of Michniowiec the boundary 
meets the San River (Turka; V-17: 42-87), which it follows, first 
southeast then bending sharply northwest, to the point that marked 
the beginning of the former boundary between Poland and Czechoslovakia 
in the Beskid Range (V-17: 52-63). The Soviet settlement of UYok 
(Uzhok) is located in this area (Figure 25). The line then extends 
along the old border to Kremenec* (V-17: 30-74), which now forms the 
trijunction of the frontiers of Poland, the Ukrainian SSR, and 
Czechoslovakia. 
C. Boundary Marking' Administrationt, and Security 
-1. East Prussia Sector  
According to the available Polish-Soviet agreements, the 
boundary between Kaliningrad Oblast, RSFSR, and the Polish-adminis-
tered portion of East Prussia has not been further defined since the 
Polish-Soviet Treaty of 16 August 1945, and no formal provision has 
been made for its administration and demarcation. The ostensible 
reason for this is that this segment of boundary is considered pro-
visional until a peace treaty with Germany is concluded. It is 
probable, however, that this segment has been demarcated and provision 
made for its administration without the pertinent documents having 
become available. 
Very little Information is at hand on the markiftg of the bound-
ary between Kaliningrad Oblast and Poland. In 1947, the Polish and 
Soviet sections of East Prussia were reportedly separated by a border 
zone about 10 kilometers wide from which the population had been 
evacuated and in which no farming was permitted. The frontier itself 
is completely closed and is patrolled by guards on both sides. A 
barbed-wire fence apparently extends along the entire length of the 
frontier; in 1952 the fence was reported to be equipped with flares, 
? *In documents on the Polish-Soviet frontier, the Polish spelling 
"Krzemieniec" and the Russian spelling "Kremenetz" (or "Kremenets") 
are also used.

which a touch on the connecting wires would set off. It is. likely 
that barbed-wire entanglements also are present along all-or most 
of the border. Possibly these frontier barriers constitute the only 
marking of the boundary. 
A-description of the barriers at. an important railroad cross-
ing point between Poland and Kaliningrad Oblast illustrates the 
extreme security measures used along the border. In 1951 the fol-
lowing successive zones were reported at Zheleznodorozhnyy (Gerdauen): 
first, farthest from the boundary' line itself, a cleared area about 
300 meters (984.25 feet) wide; then, nearer the boundary, a, plowed 
strip 10 to 15 meters (32.8 to 49.2 feet) wide, in which wooden watch-
towers with searchlights were located at 300- to 400-meter .(about 984-
to 1,312-foot) intervals; next, a barrier 2 meters (6.5 feet) high 
of barbed-wire rolls and barbed wire strung on crosspieces; and 
finally, 3 to 5 meters (9.8 to 16.11- feet) nearer the line, a_high 
barbed-wire fence strung on wooden poles. Watchtowers with search-
lights are probably spaced along the whole boundary, since they appear 
to be a standard security feature of the Polish-Soviet frontier. . 
The stretch of the boundary in the lagoon Zalew Wislany is marked 
by buoys and is reported to be lighted at night ,by searchlielts from 
towers on the sand spit Mierzeja Wislana and on the mainland. 
2. Sectors South of East Prussia  
The agreements of 1948 and 1951 establish procedures for 
the settlement of disputes and conflicts that might arise along the 
line, and for the general administration of the boundary, for the 
sectors from the junction point of the Polish, former East Prussian, 
and Soviet territories southward to the junction of the Polish-Soviet 
boundary with the Czechoslovakian boundary., This entire stretch 
of boundary is divided into five Polish and five Soviet sectors, each 
under the charge of a boundary commissioner who is responsible for its 
administration. Each sector bears the name of the town where its 
headquarters are located. From north to south the sectors on the 
Polish side are: 
(1) Sejny sector, extending the length of the Polish-Lithuanian 
SSR boundary. 
(2) Bialystok sector, extending from the junction point of the 
Polish, Lithuanian, and Belorussian boundaries southward to , 
the point where the boundary joins the Bug River near Niemirow. 
(3) Terespol sector, from NiemirOw southward along the Bug to 
Orchowo.

?)(4) Chen sector, from Orchowo southeast of Whdawa (boundary 
marker No. 1122) to the point at which the JarosXaw-Rawa 
Ruska railway (marker No. 673) crosses the boundary. 
(5) Rzeszow sector, extending from the JarosXaw-Rawa Ruska 
railway to the junction of the Soviet, Polish, and Czecho-
slovakian,frontiers (Ktemenec), with headquarters in the city 
of Przemysl. 
Administration of the boundary is designed to discourage inter-
course across the line. Apparently no provisions are made for regular 
circulation from one side of the boundary to the other by inhabitants 
of the border region in the course of their normal occupations, as is 
done along many western European and New World boundaries. The bound-
ary waters are open to navigation by both Polish and Soviet vessels 
and to timber floating by the nationals of both states, according 
to the stated provisions of the agreements, but navigation is per-
mitted only in the daytime. Vessels of one state may put in at the 
bank of the other state only if they are in distress. 
Agreements provide for local border crossing by only a few 
classes of individuals. These include, among others, the boundary 
commissioners and their subordinates in the course of their official 
duties and the laborers engaged in construction of installations con-
nected with timber floating or in clearing the banks of logs. Notice 
of persons crossing the border must be given in advance to officials 
of the other state. Nationals of either state may fish in the bound-
ary waters up to the boundary line on their side, but only in the 
daytime. Shooting and pursuit of game across the line is prohibited. 
Provision is made for the return by boundary officials of persons who 
may accidentally stray across the line. Generally, in mineralized 
areas, mining and mineral prospecting is prohibited in strips of land 
20 meters wide adjacent to the boundary. 
The basic agreements of 1948 state that commerce by railroads, 
main roads, and waterways intersected by the boundary line, and 
frontier transit points on such routes, are to be subject to special 
agreements between Poland and the USSR. At such transit points, where 
a major transportation route crosses the boundary, each state is 
required to erect and maintain proper signs and barriers. It is 
agreed that should the whole boundary or sections of it be closed to 
traffic, the border-crossing privileges of the boundary officials 
shall be suspended. It is therefore possible that even the limited 
border intercourse permitted under the agreements of 1948 and 1951 
may be inoperative in whole or in part.

The course of the land boundary along the Polish-Soviet fron-
tier is indicated by a cleared strip totaling 10 meters in width, 
5 meters on each side of the line. Provision is made in the Polish-
Soviet agreement of 1948 for keeping the border strip in proper 
condition and cleared of thickets and other undergrowth interfering 
with visibility. Care of the frontier strip on its own side of the 
line is the responsibility of each state. Cultivation and the 
construction of buildings for any purpose except defense are pro-
hibited in the boundary strip. Along the boundary line a series of 
markers, numbered in consecutive order from south to north, has been 
erected. 
On land, the boundary is delimited by these markers and is 
defined as an immovable line running from one marker to the next. 
These markers consist of two wooden posts, probably about the height 
of a man, placed 2.5 meters from the frontier line, with a small 
round wooden post or four-sided stone post between them on the line 
itself. At principal turning points, a concrete pillar is placed 
on the line between the usual two wooden posts. At points of crossing 
from land to water or water to land, two wooden frontier posts and a 
small wooden post or concrete pillar are placed on one bank of the 
river or lake, with a third post on the opposite bank in alignment 
with the frontier line. 
Along water sectors, boundary markers consist of two wooden 
posts placed on opposite sides of the stream or lake. On navigable 
rivers (except the Bug, as explained earlier) the frontier line is 
defined as following the thalweg (middle of the main channel). On 
unnavigable rivers the frontier follows the middle of the stream or 
the middle of its main branch. Natural changes in the bed of a 
boundary stream that would involve shifts in ownership of property 
or buildings do not change the position of the boundary line except 
by special agreement. The boundary line divides bridges, dikes, and 
sluices, placing one half in Poland and the other half in the 
Soviet Union, regardless of the location of the line in the water. 
The frontier markers are numbered in order from south to 
north. The first marker is in the Beskid Range at Kremenec, the 
trijunction of the frontiers of Poland, the USSR, and Czechoslovakia. 
The approximate locations of other known boundary markers are as 
follows: marker No. 350, on or near the bank of the San River, south 
of the Ukrainian settlement Zurawin ffhuravng; markers Nos. 432-A and 
472, between 3 and 4 kilometers (about 1.9 and 2.5 miles) east of 
the Polish settlement Jureczkowa; marker No. 673, near the place 
where the JarosAw-Rawa Ruska railway crosses the boundary; marker 
No. 700, south or southeast of the Polish town Wierzbica; markers 
Nos. 859-A and 860, on or near the bank of the Bug River where it

Poland, the Lithuanian SSR, and Kaliningrad Oblast. Gromadczyzna 
appears on the ANS 1:100,000 series in the German form, Gromadtschisna. 
In the prewar period, Gromadczyzna was a small cluster of buildings 
immediately on the boundary, between Lithuania, East Prussia, and 
Poland. 
The border between Poland and the USSR is the most heavily 
guarded section of the Polith boundary line. It has been reported 
that along the entire border is a continuous line of barbed-wire 
entanglements 2.5 to 3 meters (8.2 to 9.8 feet) high and broadened 
at the top to increase the difficulty of crossing. On the Polish 
side. of the frontier, watchtowers have been erected every 2 kilo-
meters (about 1.2 miles)_. The Polish border police maintain posts 
20 kilometers (12.14- miles) apart all along the boundary. 
On the Soviet side, much stricter measures have been taken. 
In order to make the frontier impenetrable, the Soviets have divided 
the border area into three zones. The first zone (that farthest 
from the frontier) reaches from 80 kilometers (about 49.7 miles) in 
the interior to a point 15 kilometers (about 9.3 miles) from the 
boundary line. In this zone, the population is kept under rigid 
control by restrictive measures. Departures or arrivals in this 
area can be made only with proper authorization, and all inhabitants 
are provided with temporary passports, which are marked and numbered. 
The second zone extends from the periphery of zone 1 to-a point 800 
meters (about half a mile) from the border. This sector is under 
approximately the same strict control as the first, with, in addition, 
an established system of outposts manned by frontier guards. In this 
area there are also numerous "observation points" equipped with 
machine guns, telephones, and radios, some of which are surrounded 
by a system of defensive dugouts. The third zone, also about 800 
meters wide, includes the frontier itself and is entirely depopulated. 
The ground has been completely leveled and cleared of trees. Watch-
towers stand about half a kilometer (1,640 feet) apart on the Soviet 
side. Running parallel to the barbed-wire entanglements that extend 
alone the boundary is a pelt of plowed land about 15 meters (49 
feet) wide, which is under constant surveillance for footprints. 
In addition to these security measures a variety of alarm devices, 
some of which release flares upon contact, have been installed as 
added precautions. Moreover, the border area is patrolled regularly 
by guards with trained dogs. There is believed to be a line of

fortifications, the so-called Stalin defense line, on the Soviet 
side of the border. A line of fiXed heavy--concrete gun emplacements. 
has been observed between the city of Brest and the boundary. 
D. Maps of the Boundary-
Probably the most authoritative and legible map source for: 
the Polish-Soviet boundary available in this country, aside from a 
few medium- and small-scale Soviet maps, is the 1:5001000 Maim  
Polski (1, in list at end of section). The linear description of 
the boundary given in this report is based on that map, but it is 
also keyed to the Army Map Service series Poland 1:100,000 (2), 
although the latter does not show the present boundary' line. A 
more recent German nap of the East Prussian sector (3), based an 
sources available in Western Germany, shows the line in a. rather 
generalized manner but differing in only a few details from that 
on the MaRa Polski. 
In the Lithuanian SSR sector, the boundary apparently has 
been altered only slightly from the prewar line between Poland and 
Lithuania as shown on the AMS 1:100,000 series. The source of that 
line is a 1:100,000 series of the Polish Military Geographic 
Institute dated 1929 and 1931. 
The position of the boundary along the Bug River from NiemirOw 
southward to the vicinity of Kryhw and along ?the upper San River at 
the extreme southern end of the line corresponds with that of the 
Ribbentrop=Molotov line between the German and Soviet conquests in 
1939. A set of 1939-40 boundary-demarcation maps of this line (4), 
at the scales of 1:5,000 and 1:25,000, is available, but the boundary 
markers and numbers shown are out of date. The extent to which the 
boundary in the Bug River as shown on these maps differs from the 
present line is not known, but presumably the difference is not 
great. 
The text of the Polish-Soviet agreement regarding the exchange 
of territories signed 15 February 1951 and the accompanying map at 
scale of 1:11000,000 (both enclosed with a Foreign Service despatch 
from Warsaw) provide Information on the rectified sections of the 
boundary.

IV. Czechoslovakia and Hungary-USSR Border 
A. History of the Boundary  
The Czechoslovak Republic that came into existence on 28 October 
1918 was confirmed by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye of 10 
September 1919 la/ and was formally recognized by the Allied and 
Associated Powers. The new state comprised the five provinces oF 
Bohemia, Moravia, Austrian Silesia, Slovakia,' and Ruthenia. Ruthenia, 
which along with Slovakia formerly belonged to Hungary, was incor-
porated into the Republic as an autonomous territory in order to 
provide Czechoslovakia with a natural boundary in the east (the 
Carpathian Mountains). Most of the inhabitants of Ruthenia were 
similar in many respects to the Ukrainians of southeastern Poland 
and the Soviet Union, but there were Hungarians also in the southern 
part. 
On 29 September 1938, 20 years after its formation, the Czecho-
slovak Republic was dismembered by Hitler in accordance with the 
Munich Agreement signed by Great Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. 
Germany was ceded the Sudetenland plus additional small scattered 
areas, and Poland demanded and received Teschen (October 1938). By 
the Vienna Award of 2 November 1938, Hungary was assigned the southern 
portions of Ruthenia and Slovakia. In Ruthenia the new boundary 
extended in a northwest-southeast direction to the south of Uzhgorod, 
in general separating the plain of the Tissa* River to the south, - 
where the Hungarians were concentrated, from the Carpathian Highlands 
to the north. On 14 March 1939, the German-sponsored government of 
Slovakia proclaimed the territory an independent state. On 15 March, 
German troops occupied what was left of Czecho7Slovakia,(as the name 
of the dismembered republic was now spelled), and the next day Czechia 
(Bohemia plus Moravia) was declared a German protectorate and incor-
porated into the' ThirdReich. Meanwhile, Hungarian troops marched in-
to the northern part of Ruthenia, which was formally annexed by 
Hungary on 16 March, giving Hungary a common frontier with Poland, 
After Germany's defeat in May 1945, the Czechoslovak Republic 
was reborn and the territories seized by Germany, Poland, and Hungary 
were returned to Czech sovereignty by June 1945. As a result of 
negotiations, a treaty was concluded in Moscow on 29 June 1945 be-
tween the Czechoslovak Republic and the USSR for the incorporation of 
Ruthenia (the Subcarpathian Ukraine) into the Soviet Union. 48/ This 
*"Tisa" is the Czech form, "Tisza" the Hungarian, and "Tissa" 
the Russian form of the name of. this river. All three forms are used 
in the report.

treaty provided that the frontiers existing between Slovakia and the 
Subcarpathian Ukraine as of 29 September 1938 (the pre-Munich 
eastern boundary of Slovakia as part of Czechoslovakia) were to be-
come, with some alterations, the boundaries between Czechoslovakia 
and the USSR. In 1946 the Mixed Czechoslovak-Soviet Commission for 
the demarcation-of-the frontier concluded its work and defined the 
boundary in general terns (see accompanying map 12757). The 
Commission's definition of the boundary, which is 115 kilometers (71.4 
miles) long, reads in part as follows --
from the Polish frontiers in the north it retains the old Slovak 
Subcarpatho-Russian regional boundary to the south as far as the 
Vysne Nemecke Plain. From here the frontier turns west and runs 
between the villages of,Sahor and Bozos. It continues behind 
the commune of PinkoVce, which belongs to Czechoslovakia, and 
turns right to the commune of Lakard Ifiekart7. 
The fate of this latter village remained in doubt until the Soviet 
Union agreed to allow the boundary to pass to the east and southeast 
within 1 kilometer of Lekart, leaving the town and its territory on 
the Czech side. 49, 50/ . 
- The Hungarian Armistice signed on 20-January 1945 provided that 
the boundaries of Hungary as they existed on 1 January 1938 should 
be restored. This provision was confirmed by the Hungarian Peace 
Treaty of 10 February 1947, with the exception that the so-called 
Bratislava bridgehead opposite the city of Bratislava was ceded to 
Czechoslovakia. With Ruthenia ceded to the USSR, the frontier that 
from 1919 to 1938 was the boundary between Czechoslovakia and Hun-
gary 21/ became the Hungarian-Ruthenian (USSR) boundary (map 12757).

slightly to the southwest before turning due south for approximately 
5.6 kilometers (about 3.5 miles). This area is heavily wooded and 
contains few settlements. Southeast of the Czech village of Nova 
Sedlica (V-17: 26-69), the boundary curves before taking a south-
westerly course that approximates a straight line for roughly 8.5 
kilometers (about 5.2 miles). Southeast of Berezovec, a Czech 
village (V-17: 16-58), the boundary again takes a southerly direction, 
crossing a metaled road between the Czech settlement of Ubla (V-17: 
16-54) and M Berezny, a Soviet settlement southeast of Ublg. Beyond 
the intersection the boundary turns west for a short distance. On 
the Soviet side in this sector the Uh gzh7 River and the railway 
and main road between Vel' Berezny Bereznyy7 (V-17: 20-52) 
and PereLn fferechiri7 (mukacevo; W-17: 19-35) roughly parallel one 
another in a south-southeast direction. 
East of the Czech village of Dubrava (V-17: 13-52) the line con-
tinues in a generally southward course, through predominantly forested 
moUntains (PoprAny Peak) (V-17: 12-41), for about 22.5 kilometers 
(roughly 14 mile.5 to Cerveng hora (W-17: 10-31) northeast of 
Uzhorod gzhgorod (Uzhorod; W-16: 07-24) at which point it again 
turns in a southwesterly direction and crosses the main road between 
Sobrance and Ulhorod at the site of the Czech village of Vy'g Nemecke 
(Vyg-gemecke) (W-16: 04-28). A few kilometers to the southwest the 
Jankovce-ULorod road is intersected. South and west of VyX Nemecke 
the border passes to the east of the Czech settlements of Zghor (W-16: 
99-25), Pinkovce (W-16: 98-23), which is east of the commune of 
Lekart, and MatOvce (W-16: 94-19). At Pinkovce the line crosses the 
Uh River. 
Southeast of the Czech village of Met6vce the boundary continues 
in a southerly direction to a point where it intersects the Vel' 
KapiAany (NagyKapos)-ULorod railway and road (W-16: 95-18); About 
3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) due south, another road is crossed between 
Rus.a. and Surty cSzUrte), west of the Soviet settlement of Palad' 
KomaroVce ffomoro2:7 (W-16: 96-14). From here the line dips slightly 
to the southwest and then turns southward again, bisecting the settle-
ment of Vel' (Nagy)-M(Kis)-Slemence (male Slementse) (W-16: 94-12).

From the vicinity of Vel'-M-Slemence the boundary follows a 
southwesterly course approximating a straight line for roughly 9.6 
kilometers (about 6 miles). In this lowland area the border inter-
sects the Latorica (Latoritsa) River after crossing .a tributary, the 
Szirin, southeast of the Czech settlement of Ptruksa (EtruAa). In 
this sector a number of minor roadsand,cart tracks cross the bound-
ary. East of the Czech village of Oerna,(W-16: 90-04) the r9ilroad 
and main road between Satoraljaujhely (Satoraljaujhely) and Cop

due east for about 1 kilometer, at which point it meets the Tisa 
River, where the borders of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the 
Ukrainian SSR meet OW-16: 94-00). 
The boundary between Hungary and the USSR follows the Tisa to 
a point south of the Soviet village of Saloka (W-16: 01-96), where 
it leaves the river and turns eastward along the old border. Ifi 
this area a railroad and a road cross the border in a north-south 
direction to the west of 6op (W-16: 97-03). To the north of this 
sector lies an area of swamp forest. The line continues in an 
easterly direction for roughly 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) until it 
meets the Caronda Stream, a tributary of the Latorica River; it then 
bears in a south-southeasterly direction. East of the Hungarian 
village of Kisdereny6 (Satu Mare; X-17: 08-81) the boundary makes 
a V-shaped bend, then extends in a northeasterly direction for about 
1 kilometer, at which point it turns eastward. To the north of the 
border on the Soviet side lies the settlement of Kosino (Kosini) 
(W-17: 15-82); to the south on the Hungarian side is Barabg.s (X-17: 
12-80). This entire sector is characterized by patches of woodland 
and brushwood interspersed with marsh areas. From east of Kosino 
the boundary extends,in an irregular southeasterly course, inter-
secting the Beregsurany-Berehovo (Beregovo) main road (X-17: 22-71) 
and skirting the Kis erd6 (forest) to the east. As in the area to 
the northwest, there ?is a dense network of secondary roads, many of 
which cross the boundary. 
East of the Hungarian settlement of Tarpa (X-17: 19-65) the 
border turns and runs in a general easterly direction to the Tisa 
River (X-17: 25-6)4), then follows the river through lowland 
characteristic of this stretch of the border. South of the Soviet 
settlement of Vhok ffry147 (Xr17: 41-63) the boundary leaves the 
Tisa and follows a tributary, the BatL-, to a point east of the 
Hungarian village of Magostiget cX-17: 43-57). The railroad and 
main road between Berehovo and Vylok skirt the eastern reaches of 
the Tisa along this section of the border; a branch of the road in-
tersects the boundary south of the river. 
After leaving the Batg.r Stream, the border extends south-
southwestward through continued lowland until meeting the Tur, 
another tributary of the Tisa. It turns in a southeasterly direc-
tion along the Tur, crosses a road, and follows the course of the 
stream to the point where the Hungarian, Rumanian, and Ukrainian 
SSR frontiers meet east of Nagy erd6 (forest) (X-17: )43-47).

C. Boundary Marking, Administration, and Security 
The Czech-Soviet border is indicated on the ground by a cleared 
strip, usually 10 meters wide but 20 meters in some places. The 
cleared area is especially evident in mountainous and wooded areas. 
Provision is made for keeping the border strip clear of growth at 
all times. Paralleling the cleared strip on the Czech side is a 
zone of impenetrable growth.. Presumably, all roads and highways 
within 200 meters (656 feet) of the boundary not actually used as 
border crossings or necessary to forestry and agriculture have been 
destroyed. Hunting grounds near the border area. continue under the 
control of the forestry service and are nonleasable. 
Observations along the frontier of Czechoslovakia indicate that 
the boundary is marked by small red-white-and-blue posts. On the 
USSR side the border posts are solid red. Boundary markers are 
probably spaced similarly to those along the Polish frontier, al-
though no definite information is available. 
It is known that the frontier between Hungary and the USSR has 
been demarcated and that a boundary regime has been agreed upon, 
but the details of these agreements are not available. 
In 1948 and 1949 a Joint Soviet-Hungarian Frontier Commission 
redemarcated the line in accordance with the terms of the 1947 
Peace Treaty with Hungary. The protocol resulting from this 
demarcation, along with maps and Other documents, was signed in 
Moscow on 30 July 1949. 52, 53/ This protocol presumably reestab-
lished border markings to conform to those set up at the time of the 
Treaty of Trianon after World War I. A treaty on the regime for the 
frontier and a convention on the method of settling frontier con-
flicts and incidents were signed in Moscow on 24 February 1950. The 
provisions of these agreements on boundary administration are not 
known.. 
The method of boundary marking probably is similar to that 
described for the Polish frontier, consisting of.nuMbered border 
posts. The white stone markers mentioned in the 1948 description 
of security zones have probably been replaced by new boundary markers. 
Soviet border posts are closely spaced along the Czech-Soviet 
frontier. Two command posts for the sector of the border situated 
west and south of Drohobycz (Drogobych) are located at Turka and 
Ustrzyki-Dolne. Subordinate patrol posts are at Sianki, Beniowa, 
Buczkarnia, Lutowiska, Tarnawa, Lokiec, Dydiowa, Pohary, Boberka, 
Zurawin, Smolnik, and Chmiel. The number of border troops stationed 
at these posts ranges from 10 to 15 men at Zurawin to approximately

250-at Sianki. Situated between the border posts are border defense 
points manned by 3 or 4 men. Reportedly, these defense points are 
located in well-concealed bunkers on tops of hills and are spaced 
about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) apart. The typical layout at these 
points is a one-story wooden building for housing the troops, 
surrounded by a circular trench connected with the building by 
arterial trenches. Each defense point is equipped with machine 
guns, pistols, rockets, flares, and telephones. 
Behind the frontier area on the Soviet side is a plowed and 
raked strip approximately 50 feet wide. High wooden guard towers 
about half a mile apart, equipped with revolving searchlights, are 
visible in the vicinity of Cierna-nad-Tisou. On the Czech side, a 
number of wooden towers 20 to 25 meters (66 to 77 feet) high are 
located very close to the border at intervals of 400 to 500 meters 
1,320 to 1,650 feet) and are occupied by guards at all times. 
Figure 26.) 
An elaborate system of border security is maintained along the 
Hungarian-Soviet border (Figure 27). According to g report from 
the Mukacevo district, there are eight parallel security areas On 
the Soviet side, beginning at the border and running eastward. The 
border itself is marked by a series of white stones approximately 400 
meters. (1,312 feet) apart. A clearing about 50 meters (164 feet) 
wide next to the border is bounded on the east by a. barbed-wire 
fence about 2 meters (6.5 feet) high, surmounted by two electrically 
charged copper wires. A second zone about 200 meters (656 feet) 
wide lies east of the fence and consists largely of marshland. In 
this zone an alarm wire, which releases rockets when tripped, runs 
close to the ground and is difficult to detect. The third area is ? 
an artificial swamp, about 300 meters :(984 feet) wide, through which 
runs a zigzag strip of dry, carefully raked earth. The fourth area 
eastward is a plowed and raked strip also about 300 meters wide. The 
fifth area, a cleared path about 2 meters wide, is patrolled by pairs 
of Soviet frontier guards, who are often accompanied by trained dogs. 
The sixth zone, about 500 meters (1;640 feet) wide, is in uninhabited, 
swampy terrain and has wooden observation towers about 6 meters high 
spaced at approximately 500-meter intervals. 
To the east of the six narrow zones lie two other security areas 
of greater depth. The first of these, called the Number 1 Zone or 
"Forbidden Zone," is about 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) deep. The 
inhabitants of this zone are handpicked Communists, and their 
identification documents are printed with a large figure 1. There 
are additional observation towers in this zone. The Number 2 Zone, 
or "Restricted Zone," which lies further east, is 32 kilometers 
(about 20 miles) deep. Only Communists and politically trusted

peasants, who often serve as informers, are allowed to live in this 
zone. Their documents bear a large figure 2 for identification 
purposes. 
Soviet troops in the border area are carefully picked and well 
trained. They are organized into sections (Otdels) and detachments 
(Otriads), Which in turn are designated by numbers and code names. 
A detachment varies in strength from 500 to 1,000 or more men 
depending on local requirements. These frontier units are respon-
sible for security along assigned border areas and are equipped 
with horses, motorcycles, automobiles, and light patrol planes. 
The section commander is responsible for the collection of in-
formation along the adjoining border strip as well as for the 
security of his frontier section. 
D. Maps of the Boundary 
The postwar boundary between Czechoslovakia and the USSR, as 
delimited by a treaty of 29 June 1945 and later approved by the 
Maxed Czechoslovak-Soviet Commission for the demarcation of the 
border, is shown on a State Department map (1, in list below). 
Other naps showing this boundary are listed as (2) and (3). 
The present boundary between Hungary and the USSR corresponds 
to the prewar Hungarian-Czech border (in the Subcarpathian Ruthenia 
area). A Joint Soviet-Hungarian Frontier Commission redemarcated 
the border in accordance with the 1947 Peace Treaty with Hungary. 
The principal source for this line is the Hungarian 1:75,000 series 
(4). 
The linear description of the boundary as given in this report 
is based on the maps mentioned andy except for the Czechoslovak 
section, on AMS Series M671 (5).

V. Rumania-USSR Border 
A. ? History of the Boundary 
The boundary separating Rumania and the Soviet Union has fluc-
tuated considerably during the last century and a half. The area 
between the Prut and Dnestr Rivers formerly known as Bessarabia (now 
comprising the major portion of the Moldavian SSR), has changed 
hands in whole or in part several times. The population in this 
area included Rumanians, Ukrainians, Jews, Russians, Bulgarians, 
and Germans. In the period between the two World Wars, Rumanians 
(Moldavians) comprised about 50 percent and Ukrainians about 20 per-
cent of the population of Bessarabia. 
After changing hands, several times between the Turks and the 
Russians, Bessarabia fell once more to Russia in 1812, and the 
boundary between Russia and the Ottoman Empire was placed along the 
Prut and the lower Danube Rivers, in practically the same location 
as the present line. In 1829 the Russians obtained possession of 
the Danube Delta, but as a result of the Crimean War in 1856 they 
were pushed back to a line in southern Bessarabia considerably 
north of the Danube. The strip of southern Bessarabia from which 
they withdrew became part of Moldavia, which, together with Wallachia, 
was recognized as an autonomous principality under the Ottoman ,Empire. 
.By the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 Rumania became independent and 
secured possession of the Danube Delta and the Dobruja area, while 
Russia again, annexed the southern strip of Bessarabia. 54/ 
The boundary between Rumania and Russia was thus restored to its 
1812 position, which is approximately its present location. 
After World War I and the Russian Revolution, the National Council 
of Bessarabia declared the province independent of Russia and later 
approved its annexation to Rumania. Great Britain, France, Italy, 
and Japan recognized this act in 1920, 55/ but the United States did 
not. The USSR also refused to recognize the incorporation of 
Bessarabia into Rumania, and for many years the frontier between the 
two countries, along the Dnestr River, was closed. Bucovina, which 
had been part of Austria-Hungary, was also ceded to Rumania after 
World War I. 
On 26 June 1940, the Soviet Union presented Rumania with an 
ultimatum demanding the return of Bessarabia and northern Bucovina. 
Rumania, powerless to resist Soviet claims, was forced to cede these 
territories, totaling about 21,000 square miles, to the USSR (Soviet-
Rumanian Agreement, 28 June 1940).

S-E-C-R-E-T 
In June 1941, when the Germans invaded the USSR they were aided 
by Rumanian troops, and the territories of Bessarabia and northern 
Bucovina were temporarily reannexed by Rumania. In October 1941, 
Odessa and Transnistria (an area beyond the Dnestr) were brought 
under Rumanian administration, However, by March 1944 the Soviet 
armies had recaptured the greater part of this territory, and by 
that summer Rumania accepted the armistice agreement offered by the 
USSR (representing the Allies). Article 4 of the armistice signed . 
on .12 September 19141. reaffirmed the Soviet-Rumanian boundary of 
1940. Ei ,Rumania's retrocession.of Bessarabia and northern 
Bucovina to the Soviet Union as provided by the armistice was con-
firmed by the Rumanian Peace Treaty signed at Paris 10 February 
1947. Thus the Rumanian-Soviet boundary was once again placed along 
the Prut and lower Danube. Delimitation of the frontier was carried 
out by the two countries in 1949 (see accompanying maps 12757 and 
12904). A protocol (including maps and other documents) describing 
the exact line was concluded, but the terms were not revealed. 
B. Linear Description of the Boundary 
The frontier between Rumania and the USSR may be divided into two 
sectors for purposes of description. The northern sector extends from 
the trijunction of the Hungarian, Rumanian, and Soviet borders to the 
Moldavian boundary (map 12757), and the southern sector extends along 
the Prut and lower Danube Rivers to the Black Sea (map 12904). 
1. From the Trijunction of the Hungarian, Rumanian, and 
Soviet Boundaries to the Moldavian Boundary* 
The western part of this border is the former frontier between 
Rumania and Czechoslovakia. From the trijunction point east of Nagy 
erdo (Satu Mare; X-17: 43-47)** the boundary follows the TUr River to 
a point south of the Soviet village of Fertealma (X-l7: 47-49). 
Leaving the river, the line extends in a northeasterly direetion for 
about 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) and then turns sharply northward, form-
ing an elbow south of the forested area of All erdo (X-17: 47-55). 
*Place names in the description of this sector of the Rumanian 
border are those appearing on the AMS Series M671, Middle Danube  
1:100,000, and N501, Eastern Europe 1:250,000. For places on the 
Soviet side, the Russian forms are given in brackets wherever possible. 
Alternate names are in parentheses. 
**Locational indices for places named in this sector refer to ANS 
Series M671 except for the final 8-mile stretch, which is covered on 
5heetNW35-11 of AMS Series N501. For explanation of locational key, 
see footnote on p. 8.

The border then takes an east-southeasterly course, intersecting the 
Satu Mare-Chust 2:Rilus7 railroad and main road (X-17: 52-50). In this 
sector many secondary roads branch off from the principal highway, 
each with different termini. To the east of the railroad crossing, 
the boundary dips to the southeast before continuing in an easterly 
direction along the Egersky Kanal. After following the same general 
course for several kilometers the boundary turns abruptly to the 
northeast, passing through an area interspersed with woodland. 
Throughout this section a network of minor roads and a number of 
streams cross or approach the frontier. To the east of the line, on 
the Rumanian side, the settlement pattern is dense, although it is 
possible that in the postwar years many of the villages in the border 
zone have been evacuated. The boundary then continues in an irregular 
northeasterly direction to a point west and north of the Rumanian 
village of BocicAu (K-17: 64-60). In this general sector the Satu 
Mare-Chust railroad on the Soviet side and a main road on the Rumanian 
side parallel the border. 
From the vicinity of Bociellu the line makes a broad, irregular,. 
north-south loop, then straightens out and takes a southeasterly 
direction for about 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles). The highest elevation 
in the area (2,600-2,700 feet) is in this sector. South of Frasin 
(X-17: 73-61) the boundary makes another loop to the north and 
traverses a heavily forested tract, resuming a general southeasterly 
course for roughly 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) to a point less than 
1 2 kilometers (about 1 mile) southeast of Polan (Sighet; X-18: 88-46). 
The border than turns in a northeasterly direction, which it follows 
until it meets the Tisa (X-18: 92-50). The boundary follows the 
river to a point south of the Soviet village of Trebu'gtany (X-18: 
39-38), a stretch of pout 60 kilometers (37 miles). In this sector 
the railroad between TaCovo f.yache.g (X-18: 95-49) on the Soviet 
side (Figure 28) and Sighet X-18: 18-38) on the Rumanian side cross-
es the border southeast of the Soviet settlement of Teresva ffereshva7 
(X-18: 07-46).* From Sighet the railroad parallels the boundary to 
the point where the frontier leaves the river and continues overland 
(X-18: 39-36). On each side of the border a main road, from which 
a number of secondary roads -and cart tracks raadate, closely parallels 
the boundary. The road-to the north, between TaCovo and Trebusgtany, 
passes through the So BULGARIA
