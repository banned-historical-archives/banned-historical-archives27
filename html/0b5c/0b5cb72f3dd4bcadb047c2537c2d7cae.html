 SECTION II,  DEVELOPVENTS IN SPECIFIED AREAS
 GENERAL
 Burman acceptance of Commonwealth oonbiliation doubtful.  No Burmese
 answer    the Commonwealth Conferenoaoe jo rat communications, oouohod in
 moat sympathetic terms, offering to assist in conciliating all of Burma's
 internal difficulties has boon received and Burmese officials are reported-
 ly disappointed and indignant that the Now Delhi meeting did not approve
 a large loan without conditions.  Since the Burmese Government has already
 rejected Prime Minister Mehru'e personal offer to mediate the Karen-Burman
 strife, acceptance of Cormonwealth.conciliation is doubtful.  The worsening
 political, economic and military situation, however, might possibly force
 the Government to submit to conciliation eventually, in order to obtain
 desperately needed financial assistance.  Even if conciliation is accepted,
 the Burmese Government will continue to view the Commonwealth action as an
 unwarranted foreign intervention.  Furthermore, acceptance of conciliation
 might lead to a serious split between moderates and extremists in the
 Burmese Socialist Party which controls the Government, thus leading to even
 further anarchy in Burma.  Current rumors that the now Supreme Commander,
 Bo Ne Win, is planning a cou  d'etat, presumably with the support of the
 extrerno left-wing Socialists under   Ba Sere, may stem from this situation
 and account, in part, for Government,reluotanae regarding conciliation.
 The major  blocks to. conciliation, however, continue to bee (1) Burmese
 conviction that they can win the fight, and; (2) strong antipathy to
 foreign interference,
 Even if conciliation were successful in reaching some sort of an
 agreement and a loan were extended, it is extremely doubtful that any long-
 term improvement in the Burmese situation would result.  Implementation of
 any agreement w uld?be nearly impossible in view of unchecked racial
 animoaitlcz, while extremist Burman and Karen elements would continue to
 be unoontrollab3e and various Burman political splinter groups--such as
 Communists and Ms-would not consider themselves bound by any agreement.

 cease payment.  so-oa ..ed 'anti-strike" subsidies, amounting to 4 billion
 Von, which have been allocated in the pant to certain critical industries,
 Formerly, when demands for wage increases which could not be met out of
 earnings threatened the coal,. electric power,, non-ferrous metal and other
 important industries with strike action, it was the Government's practice
 to allocate sufficient funds to these industries to permit the wage increase
 regardless of cost.

 JAPAN (continued)
 Removal of such subsidies is in line with SCAP's plan to put Japanese
 industrial operations on a more businesslike basis.  Without such supports
 it is hoped that the paternalistic m nagement.of these concerns will be
 forced both to discharge surplus workers now padding the payrolls and to
 institute more efficient methods of production.  Although the Government
 will be forced to support such dismissed employees through large-scale
 public works programs, it is hoped that elimination of "anti-strike" sub-
 sidies will eventually ease the Government's financial burden.
 Assembly refuses to soften National Traitors Act.  President Rhea has
 ?ailed - t o - -        the fa- "ana Asse~mbiy   . a fns er administration of the
 National Traitors Act from Assembly to Executive jurisdiction,  Vigorous
 implementation of the Act by the Assembly's Special Board will result not
 only in the punishment of "vicious" or "malicious" anti-nationalists, but
 also in the dismissal from the Government of all Korean officials who are
 judged to have been "pro-Japanese" in the past.
 Since most experienced and capable Korean officials fall in to this
 "pro-Japanese" category, President Ithec had hoped to take over operation
 of the purge himself and thus keep many such officials, particularly in
 the National Police, at their posts during the present critical formative
 period. A majority in the Assembly, however. reflecting the Korean people's
 hatred of all things Japanese, continue adamant in their insistence that
 all "pro--Japanese" officials be punished or purged from the Governmentp

 peace meeting sometime after 15 March was reached, 3) Communists continue
 to insist on the arrest and punishment of the "Big 4 families" and the
 severance of Kuomintang-American "imperialism" ties, 4) MAO Tse-tung and
 CHOU En-lai stated that before actual negotiations could take place it
 would be necessary to call a secret convention of the Communist leaders
 in order to win the extreme elements within the Communist Party to. the

 support of peace, 5) ChOUs, in replying to SiiAO's request that the Com-
 munists issue a cease fire order, stated that this was impossible because
 of disagreements within the Communist Party  (If true this may represent
 friction with the military who desire to continue the military offensive),
 6) The Communists proposed that the future government of China eventually
 be composed of three equal groups of Communists, Kuomintang members and
 non-partisans
 Following the miesionvs return LI, has continued efforts to strengthen
 the National Government.  After a southern trip during which he made
 numerous speeches avowing peace;, LI celled a conference of top-ranking
 military and political leaders for the purpose of strengthening internal
 unity and determining a program for peace discussions with the Communists,,
 Further indication of ILl"s sincerety in seeking peace is his recent request
 that the US delay munitions deliveries to China for the next few weeks:
 The initial optimism created by the peace mission's report was
 countered to some extent by the renewed belligerent and intransigent
 tone of Communist broadcasts and public utterances of Communist leaders.
 Also on the negative side was the failure of the Communists to set a
 definite date or place for official negotiations., revealing a continuing
 lack of final decisions in the high quarters of the Communist Party,
 The Nationalist press reports that the Communists not only are suspicious
 of the formation of joint defense systems in Government areas, but also
 believe that the peace advocates in the Government camp are progressive
 elements with no power,, while the power groups,, under the guise of peace?
 are preparing for continuing war with the guidance of the US;,

 quarters, admitted in a speech last week that Communist military gains
 have outrun political preparations, but emphasized that the Communists
 do not intend to confine themselves to areas north of the Yangtze,,
 "That the Kuomintang must necessarily lose was long ago affirmed by
 us,," Gen. LIN stated  in a welcoming address to "democratic personages"
 in Peiping? "but the swiftness of their defeat was beyond our expectations;"
 Although "war on a gigantic scale in impossible south of the Yangtze,"
 nevertheless "the peace which people throughout the country-demand is_.,
 not a peace with the Yangtze as a. boundary line  ?  The reactionary
 forces must be thoroughly smashed.  The governmental power must be
 handed over..  All reactionary armies must be reorganized."
 Although the Communist armies "have the strength to sweep away all
 reactionaries,;" said Gen, LIN,, the Communists wish "to reduce the destruction
 of war and to preserve the manpower and material power of the people L"
 and therefore are "adopting the method of peaceful settlement? s . ? ., "`eye
 warmly welcome the Peiping type of peace," he continued, (but) "against

 cannot but resort to the Tientsin method.  We welcome you....to help us
 realize the Peiping method of peace south of the Yangtze River..."
 Gen. LI11's statement of the Communist position is probably correct:
 iYe., that the Communists have not altered their expressed intention
 to extend their control over all of China and to destroy all significant
 military and political opposition, but that the Communists prefer to take
 over gradually, on a regional rather than national basis, and to establish
 that control by political rather than military means, retaining the
 services of elements previously in opposition so long as those elements
 are useful.
 In whatever negotiations the Communists may undertake with Acting
 President LI's regime, the Communists probably will seek the realization
 of the above program,  In the negotiations, therefore, Ll's regime would
 not in fact be a "National Government" concluding a "national" agreement,
 but a single regional regime assisting the Communists in conclusion of
 ?a number of other regional agreements.
 In such agreements,, the Communists will of course apply the Peiping
 formula wherever possible:  negotiated surrender, leisurely "reorganization"
 of Nationalist armies, and utilization, under tight Communist control, of
 the Nationalist authorities,  but if the opposition refuses to deliver
 its armies for "reorganization" and refuses to submit to Communist political.
 dictation, the Tientsin formula can and will be employed:  military assault,
 harsh ocoupation, and liquidation or suppression of the Nationalist author-
 ities;,
 While peace negotiations with LI'a regime are in process, the Com-
 munists will continue to hold their armies in readiness on the north
 bank of the Yangtze?  They will continue to plan, together with the
 representatives of anti-Nationalist groups and Communist fronts who heard
 Gen. LIN's speech, a Political Consultative Conference (PCC) which will
 form and proclaim a Communist-controlled government of China within the
 present year,  If peace negotiations with LI's regime are not successful,
 the PCC will convene without the participation of any Nationalist leaders
 and groups not already allied with the Communists and the Communist armies
 will resume their southward drive,.  Even if negotiations with Ll's regime
 are successful, Communist armies will continue to lay plans for the
 Yangtze crossing and prepare to take the offersive against any Nationalist
 forces which, then or later, resist annexation by the Communists.
 Bevelopments on Nationalist-Soviet economic pact for Sinkiang.
 Negotiations for a Nationalist-Soviet economic pact for Sinkiang are
 reportedly proceeding in Tihwa?  Though phraseology such as "Sine-Soviet
 cooperation on an equal basis" may be written into the text of the pact,
 conclusion would actually constitute legal cover for Soviet mining and
 trade monopolies.  In addition, a press report from Tihwa announces
 approaching. negotiations for renewal of the Civil Air Agreement, due to
 expire in September;

 Actin President LI Tsung-jen favors conclusion of the pact, on
 the ground that tretty relations with the USSR regarding Sinkiang are
 preferable to uncontrolled Soviet penetration there.  However, the proposed
 pact is opposed by the Foreign Ministry, headed by the pro-CHIANG YOU
 Te>chen, on the ground that the granting of monopolies to the Soviet
 would be detrimental to "national sovereignty."  A Foreign Ministry memo.-
 randum to Premier SUN Fo recommended that the pact:  1) be limited to
 five years, 2) include a most--favored-nation clause which would strip
 it of its monopolistic feature, and 3) list specific mining concessions
 to be developed by the USSR, instead of granting blanket mining and
 axploratlon rights.
 Meanwhile CHAIVG Chih-chung, Commander of Northwest Headquarters,
 has returned to Nanking from Lanchow and has apparently withdrawn his
 twice-submitted resignation as a member of LI Tsung-fen's official peace
 mission to the Communists  Though CHANG was reportedly granted pleni-
 potentiary powers by Premier SUN Fo to negotiate a Sinkiang trade pact
 with the USSR without further reference to the National Government, SUN
 Fo has recently insisted ths:b no commitments can be made without Foreign
 Office approval?  CHANG appears to be very anxious for conclusion of
 the Sinkiang pact in order to assure himself a prominent role in the
 Northwest,  He is now working to secure Foreign Office approval, using
 the argument that such a Nationalist-Soviet Agreement could not be
 attacked by the Communists without compromising their relations with
 the USSR, and would therefore strengthen the Nationalist bargaining
 position in the coming peace negotiations.
 North China de cession due to communist application of trade policy.,     ale
 Application of Communist commercial policy in North  hina continues to
 vary in different areas, but active corm:er,.e with areas outside of
 Communist China has not been stimulated.  Announced commercial policy has
 consistently been free domestic trade and controlled foreign trade (that
 is, permitting imports of necessities and exports of surpluses), but
 little encouragement has been given this policy.  The Co':lmunists have
 merely acquiesced to some extent with arrangements made by Nationalist
 and foreign shippers,  While the recent interchange between the Shanghai
 Shipping, Association and MAO Tse-tung in Peiping brought forth Com-
 munist protestations of their desire for trade. little positive action
 was taken other than to approve the already existing barter transactions
 between the Central Trust in Shanghai and the Kailan Mining Administration
 in North' China,
 Shantung Province has recognized the existence of trade by announcing
 import and export regulations which prohibit the import of luxuries,
 "non=essential" goods and  ermit free import of "steel, iron, trucks,
 pharmaceuticals and others."  Regarding foreigners trading into Tientsin,
 some clarification may be expected soon,  The Chief of the Communist
 Foreign Office on 25 March told British trade representatives that, as

 soon as TUNG P1-wu replied to the request of the foreign Chambers of?
 Commerce to "resume general commercial trading, manufacturing, etc.,"
 a general meeting would be convoked..
 The damage to the economies of the Hopeh and Shantung coastal
 cities as a result of Communist commercial inaction in already apparent.
 In Tientsin, where even normal shipping is not yet permitted, half
 the population, or perhaps a million people, are directly or indirectly
 dependent on the export trade.  Unemployment is reportedly very high
 and much of the city's industry is idled  Peiping is also badly hit;
 the US dollar has risen five times in terms of People's Bank currency
 .,since its occupation, and the black market in greenbacks, gold and silver
 .s so flourishing that it was officially banned on 28 February, apparently
 %rithout much success.,  In Shantung, a depression is not so apparent,,
 chiefly beacuse normal shipping is permitted in ports like Chefoo and
 Shihtao, and because a small trade with other Communist areas, Shanghai
 and Hong Kong has existed for some time.,  However, resumption of normal
 trade markets and more efficient collection and delivery of export
 commodities to the ports would result in increased prosperity for the area.
 ]economic insulation from the National Government is being achieved
 in some degree by every non-Communist Chinese Province, including Taiwan.
 The Ministry of Finance admits that Provincial tax payments are greatly
 reduced and that the loss of such revenue appears to be perm-anent.  The
 transmission of gold and silver out of Yunnan and Hunan is now prohibited.
 The chief source of revenue remaining to the National Government, the
 circulation of the gold yuaan, is being increasingly restricted by
 Provincial government actions.  Taiwan has had a separate and more
 stable currency for several months.  The Hunan provincial government has
 recently announced the issuance of its own currency based on silver,,
 while other provinces, notably Yunnan, Szechuen and Kansu, have
 announced their intentions to follow suit.  Repudiation of the gold yuan

 many places the sole accepted currency, thus restricting circulation

 increasingly substituted.
 Communists re ortedl   Tannin  new military operations.  Despite
 current peace maneuvers, thoUommunist High Command is reported to have
 concluded plans on 12 February at Shihohiachuang for a mass crossing
 of the Yangtze to be executed, during the last two weeks of may.  The
 plan embodies major crossings between Nanking and Shanghai; near tiryuhu;
 in the liankow sector; and west of Hankow.,  The mission of the Communist
 armies is said to be the occupation of the Yangtze valley and its major
 cities.  An interesting aspect of the reported plan lies in the scheduled

 The plans if obtained surreptitiously as claimed, represents
 either sound Communist military planning or a 'orrimuni st `plant' to
 encourage peaceful capitulation of these areas.  On the other hand,
 this 'information' may be a Nationalist 'plant' on the part of LZ and

 Cochinchina Territorial Assembly issue.  Reaction to the French        'CBs
 Govern~Genti's b1I  for the estab  shnent of a Territorial Assembly in
 Cochlnchina has ranged from tentative approval to diatribe,

 An expected favorable recommendation by the AFTT may strengthen the Govern-

 as a whole scheduled for 11 ?larch,
 The question of a new Cochinchina Assembly relates to the necessity
 for a constitutional change in the colonial status of Cochinchina before
 it may be unified with the protectorates of Tonkin and Annam to form the
 unified "three Ky" state of ?Tietnam,  Articles 75 and 77 of the French
 Constitution - - which specify that modifications of states within the
 French TTnion may take nlace only as the result of a law passed by the
 French Parliament after annroval both by an elected Territorial Assembly
 and by the AFTT     are involved.
 The present Assembly of South Vietnam, in a self-interested move to
 avoid election of a new body? has declared itself "in fact a territorial
 assembly of Cochinchina", and adopted a resolution requesting the French
 Parliament to take prompt and unequivocal action on the unity and inde-

 the South Vietnamese Assembly will be successful in this move to preserve

 An influential Vietnamese
 TITS C                            editor in Saigon , frequently quoted by the
 Consulate General, characterized the projected assembly as a "motley
 monster born, of haste and formalism which will be elected in name only,"
 He attacked the rumor that those Vietnamese members of the present Assembly
 who favor unity with Tonkin and Annam would not be eligible as candidates
 for the new assembly, while French members who saamport Cochinchinese au-
 tonomy may stand for election.  The editor concluded that ""qui.ty, logic

 Uneasiness in Siam expected to continue.   The settlement reached by
 a joint 1;;F --Navy committee,, eatabZ shed last week after the abortive
 coup d'etat attempt, has proved to be much lose extensive than expected.
 Far from solving outstanding political differences, the agreement is con-
 fined to a delimitation of the functions of the Armed Forces.  As announced
 by Premier Phibul, last weekend, the settlement: (1) agrees to withdrawal
 of Army and Marine reinforcements from Bangkok, (2) limits future use of
 the Armed Forces to national defense and, (3) charges the Police with ex-
 clusive responsibility for maintenance of order, except when the Govern-
 ment may authorize employment of the Armed Forces,,

 Notwithstanding some Army support for the Navy effort to reduce Array
 Deputy C. in C. Kach's power, it is doubtful if his strong control over
 the Army will be weakened for the present.  Current uneasiness was heightened
 by the recent arrests of many Free Thai partisans and the "escape" murders
 last Friday of four important followers of Ex-Premier Pridi.  These late
 developments, in eddition to the existing Navy and civilian antagonism
 toward the Army members of the Phibul regime, may result in further violence.
 There is every likelihood that this tense, unsettled condition will exist
 during the next few months.

 Indonesian Assembly is scheduled to meet 10 March to vote on a resolution
 supporting the Republican demand that its leaders be restored to govern-
 mental authority at Jogjakarta.  On 3 March, the Federalist Assembly voted
 unanimously to back the Republican position.  Later, Sultan Hamid, the
 pro-Dutch chairman of the Federalists, insisted that the Federalist decision
 was a feeler directed toward Netherlands policy and that it was in no sense
 final.  Hamid's lest-minute effort to equivocate was probably occasioned
 by High Representative Beel's disapproval of the Federalists' action.  The
 majority of the Federalists, headed by Anak Agang of Fast Indonesia, feel
 that their pro-Republican resolution should stand and that a last-minute
 switch of allegiance back to the Dutch would brand them as "puppets."
 If the Federalists succeed on 10 ':larch in reaffirming their earlier support
 of the Republic, the Dutch will have lost one of their'strongest arguments
 for the current "plan" to solve the Indonesian problem,,
