? OUTSTANDING YOUNG EDUCATORS 
NATIONAL WINNERS HONORED 
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.?U.S. JUN-
IOR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
SPONSORS EVENT 
Mr. RANDOLPH. Mr. President, a 
soft-spoken 5th and 6th grade teacher 
from Jackson, Miss.; a talented art 
teacher from Devil's Lake, N. Dak.; a 
courageous 10th and 12th grade English 
teacher from Atlanta; and a demure 6th 
grade teacher from Richmond, Va., were 
recently named the four national win-
ners in the first annual Outstanding 
Young Educator Awards program at the 
Statler-Hilton hotel in the Nation's 
Capital. 
Each of the four won a $2,000 scholar-
ship with which to further their educa-
tion and a handsome trophy presented 
by James A. Skidmore, Jr., president of 
the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce 
at the awards banquet attended by lead-
ing educators, Government officials, busi-
ness and civic leaders. The 4 winners 
were selected from over 30,000 nominees 
In city and State competition cospon-
sored by the U.S. Jaycees and World 
Book Encyclopedia. 
The national victors are: Helen Lee 
Coleman, 29, of 4212 Kingcrest Park-
way, Richmond, Va., sixth grade teacher 
of English at Thomas Jefferson School; 
James Morgan Hale, 32, of 1150 Clifton 
Road NE., Atlanta, Ga., who teaches 
English at Roosevelt High School; Rob-
ert Hal Moore, 30, art education teacher 
at the Devil's Lake Public School in 
Devil's Lake, N. Dak.; and Betty Helen 
Quinn, 29, of 3425 Casa Grande Circle, 
a fifth and sixth grade teacher at Gallo-
way Elementary School in Jackson, 
Miss. 
The 4 were selected from finalists 
representing 38 States, including the 
District of Columbia. Contestants must 
be teachers 21 through 35 years of age 
who teach the 1st and including the 12th 
grades. 
The West Virginia finalist was 
Martha Rose Roy of Philippi. Miss Roy 
received her 13.S. degree from Alderson-
Broaddus College in 1951 and her M.A. 
from West Virginia University in 1957. 
She received an honor scholarship from 
Alderson-Broacidus and was graduated 
magna cum laude. Miss Roy is chaplain 
of Alpha Delta Kappa?women teachers' 
honorary sorority, and president of the 
Teachers Association. The teachers of 
Taylor County selected her to represent 
the county in the Miss WVEA contest 
during the centennial year. She is a 
business education teacher at Grafton 
High School in Grafton, W. Va. 
The 38-State contestants came to 
Washington Thursday, July 8. Their 
original selection was made by the teach-
er's school principal on the basis of na-
tional standards developed by educators. 
, The criteria followed by the panel of 
judges included: professional back-
ground; teaching skill; instructional 
procedures; self-evaluation and con-
tribution, to the profession, community 
and the Nation. 
The winners were selected by Dr. 
Galen Jones, director for the advance-
ment of secondary education of the Na-
tional Education Association; Dr. Quen-
tin Earhart, assistant superintendent of 
the Maryland State Board of Educa-
tion; and John Koontz, associate super-
intendent of the District of Columbia 
Schools. 
Helen Lee Coleman attended Mary-
mount College in Tarrytown, N.Y. She 
majored in English and was awarded her 
B.A. degree in 1957, and is vice president 
of the College Alumnae Association and 
a member of Delta Kappa Gamma. She 
was recently a speaker at the English 
teachers conference at the University of 
Virginia. 
James Morgan Hale, of Atlanta, is 
president and former treasurer of the 
Atlanta Area English Club; national di-
rector and State vice president of the 
Georgia Jaycees. He attended Emory 
University, and received his B.A. degree 
in 1953 and M.A.T. in 1959. 
As newly elected vice president of the 
Jaycees, Hale read a newspaper item 
about a routine zoning permit issued to 
the Ku Klux Klan for the purpose of 
building the national headquarters 
across the street from an Atlanta ele-
mentary school. Hale went to work and 
secured several thousand signatures nec-
essary to secure a public hearing, and 
finally was able to arouse the community 
in stopping the project. 
This quick success for Hale and the 
Jaycees brought nationwide recognition 
but it is said it cost Hale and his family 
many sleepless nights. 
Robert Hal Moore teaches in the Dev-
il's Lake Public Schools. He attended 
Minot State Teachers College and the 
University of North Dakota. He is a 
member of Delta Phi Delta and was one 
of the 10 outstanding art teachers in the 
Midwest. His works and those of his 
students have been hung in Washington, 
D.C.; Grand Forks and Minot, N. Dak.; 
and Philadelphia. He received his BA: 
degree in 1956. He believes that the 
strongest characteristic of a teacher 
should be the ability to inspire and to 
motivate. He has written articles for 
magazines and is writing a book on art 
methods for students. 
Betty Helen Quinn received her B.A. 
degree in 1958 and her M.E. in 1961. 
During her college years she received 
the Kappa Delta Epsilon Award and 
membership in "Who's Who Among Stu-
dents in American Colleges and Univer-
sities." She attended Belhaven and Mis-
sissippi Colleges. Miss Quinn believes 
the strongest characteristic of a teacher 
can be judged by the rapport she is able 
to establish with her students. 
Speakers at the OYE iluncheon in-
cluded Senator MAURINE NEUBERGER, 
Democrat, of Oregon, and Representative 
JAMES ROOSEVELT, of California. It was 
my privilege to be present for this enjoy-
able and rewarding portion of the pro-
gram. 
Panel discussions included: "National 
Planning and Control in American Edu-
cation?Promise or Peril"; "American 
Education Should Be Concerned With 
General Pupil Development"; and 
"American Education Should Be Focused 
on Academic Excellence." 
Allen Ludden, CBS television star of 
the program "Password" was guest 
speaker at the awards banquet. 
Mr. President, commendations are due 
the U.S. Jaycees and World Book En-
cyclopedia for their sponsorship of this 
valuable activity. By recognizing ex-
cellence among our younger educators we 
encourage a strengthening and broaden-
ing of that excellen e. 
GI HELP FOR VIETNAM 
Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, the 
maintenance of good morale and esprit 
de corps among our troops in fighting in 
the hills and valleys of South Vietnam 
has been and will continue to be a matter 
of great importance. The question has 
been raised frequently whether these 
brave men who are carrying the burden 
of war in that faraway land realize why 
they are fighting and what they are 
fighting for. 
I recently came into possession of a 
letter from one American GI who has 
been in South Vietnam for 4 years, 
training the Vietnamese special forces in 
guerrilla tactics. This letter was ad-
dressed by Maj. Robert Furman, of 
Chicago, to hirfriend, Mrs. Ruth Sheldon 
Knowles. 
Mrs. Knowles, a writer and lecturer, 
became acquainted with Major Furman 
while visiting South Vietnam a few 
months ago. This illustrious Oklahoma 
Journalist also visited her son while tour-
ing a number of our furthermost out-
posts in the jungles of that embattled 
country. 
Major Furman, Mrs. Knowles tells me, 
is a bachelor who went to South Viet-
nam after serving in Korea and the Phil-
ippines. Despite his grim and dangerous 
tasks in the violence-ridden villages and 
countryside, Major Furman has estab-
lished himself as a friend, as well as 
an adviser, teacher and leader for those 
South Vietnamese who want freedom. 
Major Furman has adopted two blind 
Vietnamese girls, 15 and 16 years old. 
This American Army major is financing 
the education of these Vietnamese girls 
at the Perkins School for the Blind in 
Watertown, Mass. He is arranging for 
them to learn teaching skills, and when 
he retires in 2 years, and after the girls 
finish their training, he has planned for 
the three of them to return to Saigon to 
teach in a school for the blind to prove 
to the Vietnamese that blind people can 
overcome the handicap. 
The helpfulness, the humanity which 
this American soldier is demonstrating, 
Is typical of the American way. Mrs. 
Knowles, upon returning from South 
Vietnam, wrote: 
This is a typical American value?this is 
what Americans do wherever they go, even 
in a war, because this is the American nature. 
Major Furman's letter to Mrs. 
Knowles, dated August 4, 1965, reflects 
a measure of understanding and high 
morale which deserves our careful at-
tention. He also reflects upon recent 
events within this country, from the per-
spective of one who is bearing a burden 
for all of us. As a document, it affords 
timely insight, and I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AUGUST 4, 1965. 
DEAR Rum': I just got back from a stay at 
the hospital. Nothing serious, just a gut

August 23, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
Britain, where the government has recently 
tak.en major steps to hold down prices. In 
Japan, where the cost of living had been ris-
ing especially swiftly, living costs actually 
fell in a recent month. 
The U.S. cost-of-living index, on the other 
hand, has begun to move up at a faster 
pace. In recent years, the U.S. index has 
risen at the relatively mild rate of about 1.2 
percent annually. In only the first half of 
this year, however, the rise has amounted to 
1.1 percent, a gain that clearly indicates 
the recent period of 1.2 percent annual gains 
may be over. 
The rapid pace of the American economy, 
of course, has tended to put increasing up-
pard pressure on U.S. prices. American fac-
tories, which a few years ago were tieing less 
than 80 percent of their full capacity, now 
are operating at about 90 percent, accord-
ing to Federal estimates This rate, his-
tory suggests, is dangerously near the level at 
Which prices begin to move up swiftly. 
Similar pressure on U.S. prices is indicated 
by labor statistics. The rafe of unemploy-
ment among married men, the backbone of 
the labor force, amounts to only 2.3 percent, 
down sharply from 5.1 early in the current 
economic expansion. On top of all this, the 
prospect of rising defense outlays for Viet-
nam can only add inflationary pressure. 
There appears to be no such mounting 
price pressure in many countries that com-
pete with the United States in world mar-
kets A recent report by New York's Chase 
Manhattan Bank states that the "tempo of 
Europe's economic expansion has slowed con-
siderably this year" and attributes the slow-
down to "restrictive, anti-inflationary poli-
cies on the part of most governments." 
For instance, according to the report, wage 
rates in most European countries are rising 
more slowly than a year ago. In France, 
typically, wsget climbed only 2 percent in the 
first half or 1965, down from a 3.2 percent 
gain in the like 1964 period. It also should be 
noted that the Vietnam war is placing rela-
tively little strain on most European econ-
omies; Britain, in fact, recently announced 
a $616 million slash in its annual defense 
budget, as part of its fight against inflation. 
A study by the Boston Federal Reserve 
Bank, discussed in the July issue of the 
bank's monthly business review, also indi-
cates the U.S. competitive position in world 
markets may be getting rapidly weaker. The 
study, which covered some 200 types of con-
sumer godds, concludes that in foreign mar-
kets "our position has sharply deteriorated." 
In addition to developments on the price 
front, there is some increasing concern over 
the make-up of U.S. trade statistics. Studies 
indicate the big surpluses of recent years re-
flect more than simply successful competition 
in the world markets. They also reflect such 
factors as Government grants and exports by 
U.S. companies to their foreign-based sub-
sidiaries. One study, which scrutinized the 
trade figures for a recent year, found that a 
$5.4 billion trade surplus Melted down to a 
$500 million surplus after such factors were 
discounted. 
To be sure, it is by no means certain that 
Uncle Sam is about to lose his position as 
titan of world trade. It is not clew!, for in-
stance, that the recent jump in U.S. export 
prices signals a long-term trend or that 
Europe's drive against inflation will succeed. 
Nevertheless, the record of recent months 
suggests that continuing massive trade sur-
pluses are by no means guaranteed. Without 
such surpluses, it is hardly necessary to add, 
this country's balance-of-payments problem, 
already worrisome, could become dire. 
ALFRED L. MALABRE, Jr. 
APPORTIONMENT 
Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed at 
this point in the RECORD an editorial 
"TYDINGS to the Rescue" published in 
the Washington Sunday Star on August 
22, and an editorial entitled "Fair, but 
Also Effective," published in the Wash-
ington Daily News on August 20, 1965. 
There being no objection, the edi-
torials were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington (D.C.) Star, Aug. 22, 
1965] 
TYDINGS TO THE RESCut, 
It is no surprise to hear that a new move 
is afoot to retain all of Baltimore's three con-
gressional seats?one of which would be 
sacrificed, and properly so, under the redis-
tricting plan approved by the Maryland Leg-
islature this year. 
The fact that the instigator of this plot 
is Maryland's Senator JOSEPH TYD/NGS, how-
ever, has come as a shook to nearly everyone 
especially his friends. 
For it was Senator TYDINGS, during the 
debate on legislative reapportionment, who 
stood in the front rank of the Senate lib-
erals who lambasted the Dirksen amend-
ment. No one yelled louder than he about 
the sanctity of the Supreme Court's one-
man, one-vote rule. For what, after all, is as 
precious as the value of a citizen's vote? 
Well, the exigencies of politics, apparently, 
are one thing as precious. In any event, 
without dwelling too long on the principle of 
the thing, Senator Tarmacs has concluded 
that Baltimore's three incumbent Members 
of the House, all of whom have considerable 
seniority, are simply too valuable politically 
speaking, for Maryland to lose. So he has 
urged the congressional delegation to draft 
a new scheme, for presentation to the State 
legislature, which would preserve Baltimore's 
representation. 
As the Star's James Rowland pointed out 
the other day, the delegation had no luck 
whatever in a similiar venture a year ago. 
There is little question, however, that it will 
try again. 
And the shame of it is that this venture 
will pose another hurdle for the equitable 
redistricting plan already adopted. The 
Baltimore Congressmen involved launched 
a move some weeks ago to pigeonhole the 
adopted plan until the electorate votes it up 
or down in the 1966 elections. That move 
could be circumvented, however, if the leg-
islature readopts its plan in January as an 
emergency measure. And it should do pre-
cisely that?Senator TyDrams' efforts to the 
contrary notwithstanding. 
[From The Washington (D.C.) Daily News, 
Aug. 20, 19651 
FAIR, BUT ALSO EFFECTIVE 
Senator DzassEN again is going to bat for 
his constitutional amendment on the appor-
tionment of representation in State legisla-
tures. Be should. His cause is logical and 
equitable. 
Recently, the Senator was narrowly de-
feated in his proposal to offer the people the 
right to make their own decision, in each 
State, on how their legislatures should be 
divided. This amendment simply would 
have given the voters the right to choose 
whether one house of their legislature should 
be allotted along lines other than a strict 
population basis. 
The amendment lost because it was seven 
votes short of the two-thirds majority re-
quired for a constitutional proposal. 
But in the 1966 session of Congress, or in 
the next Congress?eventually--an amend-
ment such as Senator DIRIESEN advocates will 
be submitted to the States. Sooner or later 
the people, understanding the problem, will 
demand the return of their' own right?the 
right to decide, for themselves. 
20487 
The liberals who oppose the Dirksen 
amendment are wrong on two counts. They 
are wrong because they, of all people, are 
denying the voters the right to choose for 
themselves the form of their own State legis-
latures. And they are wrong because they 
persist in mixing the issues. 
The only issue in the Dirksen amendment 
is the right of the people to decide. 
But the liberals insist on reading it as a 
backhanded attempt to perpetuate mal-
apportioned legislatures. 
There are mala.pportioned legislatures. 
That's why the voters of Tennessee, for 
example?went to the Supreme Court and got 
a ruling that if the Tennessee legislature, 
as the State constitution required, did not 
apportion itself fairly the courts would 
undertake the job. 
The Dirksen amendment does not shut the 
door on the reform of legislative apportion-
ment. It is an insurance against misappor-
tionment. Because it provides that any 
allocation of legislative districts must be 
approved by the voters. Moreover, in his 
new version of the Dirksen amendment the 
Senator proposes that any legislative plan 
submitted to the voters first must have been 
offered by a legislature in which at least one 
house was properly apportioned on a popula-
tion basis. 
The Dirksen amendment proposes to make 
legislatures both fairly representative and 
effectively respresentative. 
So we hope Senator DIRKSEN keeps up his 
fight along this line. And that those who 
ha,ve been misrepresenting the purpose of 
the amendment will get their sights in focus, 
so they will see that this is a way toward the 
goals they claim to favor?fair and effective 
representation in State legislative halls. 
FORTY- H ANNIVERSARY OF 
SERVICE OF MARK TRICE IN THE 
SENATE 
Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, 
join with my colleagues in paying tribute 
to our very fine secretary to the minor-
ity, Mark Trice. I have not served in 
the Senate nearly so long as many of my 
fellow Senators, but in the time that I 
have been here Mark Trice has always 
been an excellent source of information 
and a reliable counselor. He has always 
been most helpful to both me and my 
staff. Forty-five years of exemplary 
service is certainly an enviable record. 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. President, it is a 
distinct personal pleasure for me to join 
my colleagues in saluting Mark Trice on 
the occasion of his 45th anniversary of 
service to the Senate. 
In compiling this proud record he has 
been unfailingly cheerful and competent. 
It is amazing how he keeps tabs on what 
is going on and I do not know what the 
minority side would do without his guid-
ance and counsel. 
My association with Mark precedes 
my brief service as a Member of this body 
because in the thirties I worked in a 
senatorial office while going to law school 
and came to know him then. Thirty 
years ago the pace of the Senate was 
slower than It is today, but Mark has 
kept up with the times and runs things 
just as well now as he did then. 
I count him as a friend. I look to him 
for guidance. I wish for him many more 
years of serving the Senate and his coun-
try in his sensitive and important posi-
tion.

mail to answer so I am now buckling down 
to it. I'll never be a correspondent, I hate 
to write. I'm crummy at it but will give 
it the old college try. 
Things are a little busy here and tension 
seems to be mounting, particularly among 
the uninitiated. With Special Forces troops, 
however, this is old hat. We have been do-
ing business at the same old stand for a 
long time and don't panic easily. 
That was a real fine letter you wrote, and 
the boys and I appreciate what you have 
said and the things you are doing. Maybe 
when you are in college areas, you can set 
some of those mixed-up kids straight. You 
know, the demonstrators. I would rather 
fight over here than in Anytown, U.S.A. If 
some of those kids saw some of the men, 
women and children butchered by the Viet 
Cong maybe they would be a little less in-
clined to talk, and more ready to help. I 
can't believe that today's American youth 
are any less courageous and possess any less 
love of country than they did in the past, 
but the papers we read sure give us that 
impression. 
The guys over here don't expect to be ex-
tolled as heroes and don't expect the folks 
back there to raise monuments to them. 
They have a job to do and they can see the 
need. It does, however, get mighty sicken-
ing to read about those New York kids burn-
ing draft cards and probably going off to a 
movie or hamburger joint afterwards brag-
ging about it. Our guys, same age, same 
country, work, fight, bleed, and die so those 
punks can theorize. I'd like to see some 
demonstrations for our country, yes and wave 
the flag, too. I have never been able to see 
any shame in being a flag waver. 
There is no one Who wants peace anymore 
than the guy who is going to do the fighting 
and possibly the dying. I want peace but 
not at the cost of liberty. 
Turning the other cheek and setting the 
course by destroying our arsenal is suicide. 
It has never worked and never will. Strength 
is the way to peace. Nobody in their right 
minds will attack anyone who will pulverize 
them. They only attack when they are sure 
they can win. 
Well, how about that for a tirade? Off 
soap box. Thanks again kiddo and keep up 
the good work.

DELAWARE RIVER BASIN WATER 
SHORTAGE 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, millions 
of people in the Northeast never stopped 
to realize the value of water until they 
were stopped by the acute water short-
age plagUing their area. The drought, 
worst in the area's recorded history, has 
lasted for 45 months, beginning in 1961, 
and deficiencies can be expected to con-
tinue for at least another year even if 
there is normal precipitation during the 
coming year. 
New York City depends on reservoirs 
in the mountain upland areas of the 
Hudson and Delaware River watersheds 
whose present resources stand at only 48 
percent capacity. 
Half of Phildelphia's water supply is 
taken directly from the Delaware River 
at the Torresdale intake, and the re-
mainder comes from the Schuykill River. 
The issue is of the interrelated sup-
ply for the two cities. New York City, 
having the advantage of geographic 
proximity to the headwaters of the 
Delaware River, affects the needs of 
Philadelphia by its diversions out of the 
No. 155-5 
river drainage. The low flow of the 
Delaware increasingly threatens the 
Philadelphia water supply with saline 
contamination as salt water continues to 
intrude toward the Torresdale intake. 
In 1954 the U.S. Supreme Court au-
thorized New York City to take 490 mil-
lion gallons a day from the Delaware for 
that city's use. The Court stipulated, 
however, that New York City must re-
lease back into the Delaware 200 million 
gallons a day from other New York 
reservoirs to supplement the volume of 
flow in the river. On June 14, 1965, New 
York City stopped the required releases 
to conserve its own supplies. 
This and low runoff from the spring 
thaws in the mountain area have caused 
the water volume in the Delaware down-
stream from New York to reach a record 
low, and the extent of the salt water 
line threatening Philadelphia an alltime 
high. The required 200 million gallons 
a day releases were resumed in July 1965 
by order of the Delaware River Basin 
Commission effective until September 10, 
1965. 
The current crisis has not yet reached 
the proportions of actual water depriva-
tion to the consumer. The water short-
age is defined in terms of rapid depletion 
of reserve resources since the normal 
sources have been used up. The drought 
has forced the cities to operate on in-
adequate and hazardous reserves. Sec-
retary of the Interior Stewart Udall has 
stated that New York City's shortage is 
more critical than Philadelphia's, but 
this situation cannot be considered in 
Isolation. The obvious problems of a 
water shortage in New York City are 
widened and deepened by their impact on 
cities with water supplies interrelated to 
New York's. 
These problems have been growing for 
4 years. Last week the President called 
a conference of Governors, mayors and 
Senators from the stricken areas. I par-
ticipated in this conference then, and in 
subsequent meetings I heard many rec-
ommendations for alleviating drought 
conditions, such as metering, controlling 
leakage, public appeals, further research, 
appeals to industry and privately owned 
reservoirs, and so forth. 
At my request, Mr. Theodore Schad, 
senior specialist in engineering and pub-
lic works at the Library of Congress, pre-
pared a memorandum on previous rec-
ommendations to ease the water shortage 
problem. At present the Department of 
Health, Education, and Welfare is study-
ing water quality conditions in the Hud-
son River and New York City engineers 
are planning emergency and limited use 
of the Hudson River. As seen from Mr. 
Schad's study, which I will submit for 
publication in the RECORD, there is noth-
ing new in the concept of using the Hud-
son River as a primary source of water 
supply for New York City. 
In July 1951, an engineering panel on 
water supply made recommendations to 
the mayor of New York City an the sub-
ject of future water sources for the city. 
Its letter of transmittal stated that the 
committee believed that the Hudson 
River with filtration was the best source 
20489 
and should be developed as the next step 
for meeting the future needs of the city. 
The quality of the water after filtration 
was the same or better than the present 
sources, the cost much lower?a saving 
of $100 million over the 40-year period?
the volume eight times the present aver-
age annual use by New York. Use of the 
Hudson would stop encroachment upon 
mountain streams and would be flexible 
in its utilization. 
Despite these recommendations, New 
York City decided to use the western 
branch of the Delaware River for ex-
pansion of the city's water supply dur-
ing the 1950's on the assumption of better 
quality, which has turned out to be 
faulty. Had New York City followed the 
committee's recommendations which 
enumerated the assets of the Hudson as 
the primary water source, the most crit-
ical problems facing the area today 
would have been solved. But it does 
little good to cry over spilt water. With 
the problem facing the New York City 
administration, and solutions based on 
extensive studies before them, it would 
seem that there is going to be a great 
duplication of research and factiinding 
efforts by the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare and Secretary 
'Udall. Hopefully, the solution which 
seems obvious to an impartial and in-
formed source, Mr. Schad, will become 
obvious in the very near future to New 
York City officials. The Hudson should 
be developed as the primary source of 
water for New York, thus allowing Phil-
adelphia and nearby New Jersey cities 
unthreatened use of the Delaware. 
There need not any longer be an objec-
tion to using purified sewerage water 
since many major cities do so. 
In the light of sound engineering facts, 
it is not justifiable for New York City to 
utilize its geographical upstream posi-
tion on the Delaware to deprive cities 
further south of use of the Delaware 
water when it has a much better source 
in all technical aspects, namely the Hud-
son. And why should Philadelphia be 
endangered unnecessarily by the waste-
ful and shortsighted plans of the New 
York City administration? 
As New York City's follies come into 
public view, the Federal Government has 
taken steps to effect a compromise be-
tween the two cities in the form of a 
water bank, which would store the re-
quired releases into the Delaware in 
reservoirs for use by New York City un-
less the security of Philadelphia's water 
supply is further endangered by salt 
water. I commend the Johnson admin-
istration for its efforts to bring about a 
solution to the problem, but I wonder 
why the administration is taking steps 
to make amends for the mistakes of New 
York City in its present policies, when 
the need for an overhaul of the New 
York City water supply system is obvious 
from an engineering standpoint. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Mr. Schad's report to which 
I referred earlier be printed in the 
RECORD.

20490 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE August 23, 1965 
There being no objection, the report 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE LIBRARY OE CONGRESS, 
Washington, D.C., August 12, 1965. 
To: Hon. HUGH SCOTT. 
From: Theodore M. Schad, senior specialist 
in engineering and public works. 
Subject: Water shortage in the Northeastern 
States. 
This is in response to your request for icleaE 
as to ways to alleviate drought conditions in 
the Northeastern States, with particular ref-
erence to the water shortage in New York 
City and its effect on the flow in the Delaware 
River. 
A report to the President dated July 21, 
1965, by the Water Resources Council, en-
titled "Drought in Northeastern United 
States," outlines a whole series of steps which 
the Council recommends be taken by the 
Federal Government to alleviate drought 
conditions throughout the Northeastern 
United States. As I understand you received 
a copy of the report from the White House, 
there is no need for me to reiterate the nu-
merous recommendations that are included 
in that report. From the viewpoint of the 
State of Pennsylvania and the Delaware 
River Basin, however, it appears that in-
creased attention should be given to one 
point that is mentioned in the Council's re-
port. I refer to the possibility of utilizing 
the Hudson River as a primary source for 
the New York City water supply. 
On page 9, the report mentions that New 
York City "has begun an engineering recon-
naissance to construct an emergency pump-
ing plant on the Hudson River." On page 13 
it indicates that the Department of Health, 
Education, and Welfare is carrying out a 
study of water quality conditions in the Hud-
son River. Actually, the use of the Hudson 
River as a primary source of water supply has 
been considered and favorably recommended 
by eminent engineers as far back as the early 
years of the present century. In fact, it could 
be said that New York City brought on the 
present water crisis, both for itself and Phila-
delphia. by its failure to accept such a recom-
mendation when it was most recently made 
in 19M. Instead, it proceeded to construct 
the CannonsviIle 'reservoir on the west branch 
of the Delaware as the next increment of its 
water supply system. The extended drought 
over the last 4 years has resulted in the ina-
bility of this small watershed to produce 
the, flow needed by New York City and down-
stream users on the Delaware. Although it 
may be too late to help very much during the 
present drought period, it would appear de-
sirable, from the viewpoint of Philadelphia, 
to bring pressure to bear on New York City 
to develop the Hudson River as a major 
source of water supply, so that even more 
serious water shortages can be avoided during 
future periods of drought. 
The Hudson River has many advantages as 
a source of supply for New York City. For 
example, the average discharge of the Hudson 
River at Green Island near Albany for the 10-
year period of record 1946-66 was 10,430,000 
acre-feet or roughly 9.4 billion gallons a day. 
This is almost eight times the present average 
annual use by the city of New York of 1.26 
billion gallons per day. The minimum flow 
of record is 1,270 cubic feet per second at 
this point or about 800 million gallons per 
day. 
By contrast the flow of the Delaware at 
Montague, N.J., just below Port Jervis, is less 
than 4,800,000 acre-feet and the minimum 
discharge has been as low as 412 cubic feet 
per second (26$ m.g.d.) less than one-
third of the water available in the Hudson 
River during the lowest period of record. The 
west branch of the Delaware, from which the 
newest water supply for the city of New York 
has beer). developed in the Cannonville Res-
ervoir, is an even smaller stream having an 
average flow of only 772.000 acre-feet (690 
m.g.d.) with a minimum discharge recorded, 
without regulation, of only 32 cubic feet per 
second. 
These facts were not unknown to the city 
of New York when it made its decision to go 
to the west branch of the Delaware River 
for the expansion of its water supply during 
the decade of the 1950's. in July 1951, an 
engineering panel on water supply made rec-
ornmendationt to the mayor's committee on 
management survey of the city of New York 
on the subject of future water sources of the 
city of New York. The panel consisted of 
Thorndike Saville, Sr., W. W. Homer, Louis R. 
Howson, and Abel Wolman, four the most dis-
tinguished consulting engineers in the field 
of municipal water supply in the United 
States. Among other things the committee 
stated (letter of transmittal, p. sly) : 
"After consideration of all available 
sources, the panel believes the Hudson River, 
with filtration, offers the best solution and 
that it should be developed as the next step 
for meeting the future needs of New York 
City, Among the factors influencing this 
opinion sue: 
"(a) By standard filtration process, Hud-
son River water can be made equal to, if not 
better in quality than, that now supplied to 
the city of New York. The project also has 
an important security valua resulting from 
the ability of the Hudson River to free itself 
of radioactive or biological contamination. 
"(b,) The development cost per m.g.d. of 
additional safe supply is much the lowest, 
being less than one-third that of any upland 
source to supply comparable quantities. 
"(c) It is also lowest in annual cost, sav-
ing the city at least $100 million prior to the 
year 2000 as compared to the proposed Can-
nonsville development of the board of water 
supply. 
"(d) It can be initially developed to mod-
erate proportions, and readily enlarged to 
meet increased demands, unlike most upland 
sources. 
"(e) It is most flexible in its utilization, 
requiring substantial operation only during 
unusually dry periods when water from the 
upland sources is insufficient. 
" (f) The Hudson?particularly with the 
upland storage, which in Sacandaga Reser-
voir alone is seven times the volume of the 
Kensico Reservoir?Is substantially inex-
haustible. 
"(g) No delays due to interstate negotia-
tions or application to the U.S. Supreme 
Court are required for an initial Hudson 
River development in contrast to any pro-
posals for new upland Delaware sources. 
"(h) The encroachment of New York City 
upon mountain streams for water supply 
uses will be stopped for many years, thus 
preserving such streams for fishing, wildlife, 
recreation and other conservation uses. In 
addition the city will not be charged for 
taxes on lands taken for water supply pur-
poses, for policing, for sanitation and other 
costs required by law when upland areas 
are taken for water supply reservoirs." 
The panel proposed a plan for pumping 
water from an intake in the Hudson River 
just below Hyde Park, N.Y. From this point 
It would be pumped to a filtration plant near 
Chelsea, N.Y., where it would be chlorinated, 
filtered, and pumped into the Delaware 
aqueduct and delivered to the existing New 
York city water supply reservoirs. The panel 
stated (p. 79) "It is shown that by ordinary 
standard filtration processes Hudson River 
water can be made to equal, if not better, 
the quality of water now supplied to New 
York City." 
The committee made several other recom-
mendations which are still pertinent with re-
spect to dealing with the New York City 
water supply problem. Among these was a 
recommendation that consideration be given 
to more extensive metering of customer serv-
ices, and that more attention be given to 
reduction of leakage and waste from the 
water distribution system. The panel sug-
gested that the latter source might lead to 
a saving of 150 million gallons a day without 
curtailing or restricting any proper water 
usage. 
The existence of this report and earlier 
reports going back to 1900 by competent 
engineers, recommending the Hudson as an 
obvious source of water for New York City 
suggests that development of the Hudson to 
a far greater extent than the reinstallation 
of the emergency intake and pumping plant 
at Chelsea is warranted. 
Accordingly, it would appear desirable for 
Pennsylvania to insist in every way possible 
that New York City be forced to develop the 
Hudson River supplies even to the extent of 
additional storage on the Hudson, if such is 
needed, so that the Hudson would become a 
major permanent source of water supply for 
the New York City metropolitan area leaving 
the Delaware for use of growing industry 
and municipalities in the Delaware Valley. 
THEODORE M. SCHAD. 
THE CRITICAL COIN SHORTAGE 
Mr. CANNON. Mr. President, the Na-
tion has for more than a year been in-
volved in a critical coin shortage crisis. 
The problems which this issue raises for 
American commerce in all 50 States has 
been well publicized. The Government 
genuinely has tried to wrestle with this 
problem and has considered all sorts of 
voluntary and involuntary means of 
finding a solution to this problem. 
Recently?and to my deep regret?the 
Congress. authorized a desilverization of 
our coinage and a cutback in the silver 
content of the 50-cent Piece. 
But citizens generally have not ad-
dressed themselves to this problem which 
is why I am particularly impressed with 
the recommendation of a newspaper edi-
tor from my State calling on citizens to 
agree among themselves not to hoard 
coins and pledge themselves to oppose 
hoarding or speculating in coins. 
This is a subject that I hope will be 
taken seriously by many communities 
across this country because it involves 
Individual responsibility in solving what 
is a serious problem for all American 
business and indeed for the future of the 
U.S. monetary system. 
I ask unanimous consent that the col-
umn of Paul K. Gardner in the Lovelock 
Review Miner be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
Witoss Do You LovE? 
(An editorial by Paul K. Gardner) 
Do you love your community? 
Do you love your State? 
Do you love America? 
Or you do you only love yourself? 
These questions are to the point. What 
Is happening to our monetary system is in-
volved. An outflowing of local patriotism 
could do much to relieve present difficulties. 
We estimate that Lovelock people have 
stored away over 5,000 silver dollars. They 
are engaged at present in putting half dollars 
and quarters in their socks and under their 
mattresses. Some are foolishly storing silver 
certificates. An estimated $10,000 is being 
hoarded here. 
A very few Pershing County business 
people are grabbing all the change they can 
get their hands on and concealing the fact. 
We wouldn't be surprised that there are 
millions of silver dollars and other coins 
taken out of circulation in Reno. Hoarding 
In Nevada could amount to 850 Million.

Business Council, formerly known as the 
Business Advisory Council. As you may 
know, this organization, which was once as-
sociated with the Department of Commerce 
but which is now independent, was formed 
for the purpose of advising the Federal Gov-
ernment on matters of broad public policy 
affecting the business community. The 
council is composed predominantly of men 
associated with private industry, and in all 
cases they are men of proven character, abil-
ity, and sense of public responsibility. The 
Business Council has been functioning suc-
cessfully since 1933, and its influence upon 
important, Government policy decisions has 
been great, and is even now felt to be ex-
panding. 
Without going too fully into the operations 
of the Business Council, we feel that an 
organization of this nature could best serve 
the travel industry?with all of its divergent 
interests?at least initially. It would offer 
the advantages of being advisory, it would 
reflect an industrywide point of view, it 
would serve as a listening post, it would 
furnish two-way communication with the 
Government, it would involve practically no 
capital outlay or organizational expense, it 
could?as the Business Council now does?
appoint special committees to study and deal 
with specific problems as they arise, and?
above all?we have very good reason to be-
lieve that if such a council is established 
and is composed of responsible representa-
tives of the travel industry, it will be recog-
nized by the Government. 
In general, if modeled after the Business 
Council, the Travel Advisory Council would 
be constituted somewhat as follows: 
1. Purposes: The Travel Advisory Council 
would be dedicated to serving the national 
interest and its primary objectives would be 
to submit to any branch or agency of Gov-
ernment?or to any recognized public body?
a constructive point of view on matters of 
public policy affecting the travel industry; 
to respond to requests by any branch or 
agency of the Government for advice and as-
sistance in carrying out their respective re-
sponsibilities; and to provide a medium for a 
better understanding of Government prob-
lems by the travel business. 
2. Membership: The Travel Advisory Coun-
cil shall consist of not more than 50 active 
members, chogen to be broadly representa-
tive from both a geographic as well as a 
functional point of view. There shall be no 
political qualifications for membership. 
The active membership of the Travel Ad-
visory Council shall change periodically so 
that the council may enjoy the benefits 
which accrue from the introduction of new 
personalities and fresh points of view. 
All active members shall be invited to serve 
for a period of 1 year. They shall be selected 
by the executive committee. 
3. Executive committee and officers: The 
executive committee of the council shall con-
sist of 10 members elected by the council 
at its organizational meeting. A quorum of 
the executive committee shall consist of six 
members. 
The council will elect a chairman and not 
more than two vice chairmen. The chair-
man will also be chairman of the executive 
committee. 
If at some later time it is felt in the best 
interests of the industry to employ an execu-
tive secretary to devote his full time to 
Travel Advisory Council affairs, this position 
will be filled by the executive committee, 
which will also fix his compensation. 
4. Appointment of committees: Since 
much of the work of the council will be 
done by special committees, the executive 
committee is empowered to appoint such 
committees and to name the chairmen 
thereof, 
Where desirable, committees may have 
noncouncil members who are specifically 
? qualified qualified to bring information on 
matters under the committees' consideration. 
5. Meetings: Meetings of the Travel Ad-
visory Council shall be held at least twice a 
year or more often, at the discretion of the 
executive committee. 
The executive committee shall meet from 
time to time as may be necessary and at any 
time at the call of the chairman. 
6. Reports: Committee reports shall be 
submitted to the Travel Advisory Council 
for approval unless prior authority is given 
for a committee to deal directly with the 
Government agency or branch involved. 
7. Council fund: The chairman of the 
council is authorized to solicit and collect a 
previously determined fund adequate to 
carry on the work of the council. 
8. Amendments: This organizational struc-
ture may be amended or changed at any 
regular meeting by a majority vote of all 
the active members of the council. 
Holiday has no wish to persuade the 
travel industry into organizing itself, or in-
deed, to take any other action. But, we 
wanted to present our findings to our friends 
in the industry for whatever value they may 
be. We are aware of the fact that many in-
dustry leaders are looking ahead in this di-
rection, and that many feel some form of 
organization is necessary. Moreover, we 
would be agreeable to taking the initiative 
in calling together in Washington, or in any 
other more convenient location, the leaders 
of the travel industry for a symposium to 
discuss this issue, and related topics. If 
such a meeting should come about, we would 
seek to have on hand some top Government 
officials as well as a spokesman for the 
business council who could describe in de-
tail the manner in which that organization 
operates. 
Any council which may be established, 
such as that outlined here, should represent 
domestic travel interests as well as those 
promoting overseas travel, and its ultimate 
purpose must be far broader than just block-
ing the imposition of a penalty tax or pro-
moting the "See the U.S.A." program. The 
council can best serve the interests of the 
entire travel market only if it provides a 
continuous two-way channel of communi-
cation between the industry and the Gov-
ernment. We genuinely feel that the travel 
industry is in a position to make great strides 
within the next few years, but we know that 
while there are enormous opportunities in 
this field, it is inevitable that there shall also 
be constant problems. We pledge our full 
assistance to the industry in dealing with 
both the opportunities and the problems. 
Thank you for taking the time to review 
this matter. Perhaps you agree that its im-
portance and urgency to your company and 
the travel industry at large require imme-
diate attention. I would therefore appre-
ciate your comments or reaction at your 
earliest convenience. 
Sincerely yours,

THE WAR, IN VIETNAM 
Mr. TALMADGE. Mr. President, 
there has come to my attention two ex-
cellent editorials from the Atlanta Con-
stitution and the Philadelphia Evening 
tulletin concerning the President's 
course of action in the war in Vietnam. 
These editorials support the President's 
Vietnam policy, and make the point that 
our forces remain in Vietnam by invita-

PRESIDENT JOHNSON SCOTCHES RUMOR?WE 
REMAIN IN VIETNAM BY INVITATION 
Both President Johnson and Henry Cabot 
Lodge, our Ambassador to Vietnam, have 
made special efforts to emphasize that the 
United States is participating in the war 
against the Vietcong only at the request of 
the Vietnamese Government. 
Earlier, Ambassador Lodge had been quoted 
in a supposed leak from private committee 
hearings as vowing that the United States 
would stay in Vietnam with or without the 
invitation of the legitimate government. 
If that had been a true statement of Amer-
ican policy, it would have represented a sharp 
shift of our long-standing ground rules and 
would seriously have weakened America's 
moral position in the war. 
"I didn't say that, I'll tell you," Mr. Lodge 
said of the unsubstantiated report. 
And the President declared: "The United 
States would never undertake the sacrifice 
these efforts require if its help were not 
wanted and requested." 
Let us hope that the mischief done by the 
report of alleged testimony now is undone. 
It is true that the United States has in-
terests in Vietnam exclusive of protecting the 
Vietnamese Government. Vietnam is, as 
Korea was a decade and a half ago, the line 
drawn against Communist aggression. It is 
important that the tide be checked before 
all of southeast Asia is flooded. 
But we are, after all, lighting on Vietnam-
ese soil. To do so uninvited would not only 
increase the danger to our troops manyfold, 
but it would well nigh destroy our moral 
position. 
As long as we show the firmness of our 
commitment to protect Vietnam, and strive 
to help solve the social and political needs 
of the people as well as the military, the 
chances are very slim that we will be asked 
out. 
[From the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, 
Aug. 11, 19651 
GIVING AID AND COMFORT 
Teach-ins, public hearings, and grassroots 
rallies, designed to excite the public against 
American resistance to Communist aggres-
sion in southeast Asia, may be tolerated in 
the name of free speech. Even a Rutgers 
professor who said he would rejoice in a 
Vietcong victory (that is, in a defeat for the 
United States), is supposed to be merely ex-
pressing a permissible opinion, according to 
the governing body of his university. 
Obstructive action is something quite 
different. Out in California, at Oakland, for 
2 days running, demonstrators attempted to 
impede the passage of troop trains carrying 
men bound for the Pacific. In other places, 
young men have been counseled to burn, and 
some did burn, their draft cards. Declara-
tions of conscience are circulated, and those 
signing them undertake to hamper the 
prosecution of military action in Vietnam in 
every possible way. 
No nation involved in hostilities can per-
mit actions which give aid and comfort to 
the enemy, unless all sense of the very defini-
tion of treason has been forgotten. Direct 
obstruction should be met by stern and 
prompt repression. 
When the French were involved in Viet-
nam, after granting progressive independence 
to their former colony, the Communists in 
France laid a propaganda backfire on the 
homefront which was much more effective 
than the defeat at Dienblenphu (one lost 
battle) in bringing about the surrender. It 
is an object lesson worth recalling soberly be-
fore it is too late.

August 23, 1965 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE 20491 
Innocently, local adults and their children 
have hundreds of piggy banks that are full 
of much needed coins. They may have for-
gotten where such savings have been stpred. 
Why all this hoarding, this miserliness? 
Because the government is taking the Sil-
ver out of dimes and quarters, reducing it 
in 50 cents pieces and refusing to mint more 
silver dollars. They have the crazy idea that 
they are going to make some big profit out 
of holding the coins. But they fail to real-
ize that buried money earns no interest. 
It is said that one can get $1.26 for a silver 
dollar today. But a dollar deposited in re-
turn for a time certificate can yearly earn 
1% cents. In 5 years, it will earn 25 cents. 
But this is a very small part of the prob-
. 
Money was made for use of the people just 
as streets were. Hoarding money is like 
blocking off a section of a street. 
Hoarding change in Lovelock is already 
hurting. If the selfish trend continues, it 
will be a deadly hurt 
But hoarding goes further. It is affecting 
the gaming and tourist business. Lovelock, 
Pershing County, and the State of Nevada 
depend on these for a large part of their 
income. If you are hoarding, you are hurt-
ing them. 
By hoarding you are showing lack of faith 
In America to survive. If you are afraid of 
inflation, how are you going to cash in on it 
with your dollars? Eventually, laws will be 
passed to head you off. And eventually, 
quarter, and half dollars will be replaced with 
paper money, if hoarders, and their likes keep 
np their practice. 
We would like to see a movement started 
In Pershing County, and Lovelock in par-
ticular, in which a public list is signed, agree-
ing net to hoard, and pledging oneself to take 
every possible means of preventing hard cash 
leaving the community. 
This would involve turning in hoardings, 
emptying piggy banks and arrangement with 
the local bank to cooperate. 
We appeal to the local loyalty and the 
patriotism of Lovelock people to do their part 
In correcting this evil situation.

TRAVEL ADVISORY COUNCIL URGED 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, recently 
Holiday magazine has undertaken an 
important initiative much needed in the 
field of U.S. travel, namely to unite all 
segments of the industry within a Travel 
Advisory Council patterned after the 
highly successful Business Council. 
I believe that there is a great need for 
such a Travel Advisory Council to give 
the industry a spokesman and to provide 
an effective bridge between the industry 
and the Federal Government, and to 
advise the latter an matters of broad 
public policy. 
On July 201 introduced a bill, S. 2305, 
which, I believe, would put this Nation 
on the road toward becoming a premier 
travel Nation. I am pleased that Sen-
ators SCOTT, LONG of MISSOUT1., MCGEE, 
Marla, CArrivoN, WILLrAms of New Jer-
sey, PEARSON, BREWSTER, BIBLE, and 
CLARK have recognized the potential of 
this bill and are cosponsoring it. Sen-
ator MAGNosoN, chairman of the Senate 
Commerce Committee, has recently as-
sured me that early next session the 
committee will schedule a full dress re-
view of U.S. tourist policies and at that 
time the committee will give S. 2305 full 
and careful consideration. 
With an expanded U.S. Travel Service, 
an effective domestic travel program, a 
closely coordinated U.S. Government 
travel effort; and a National Travel Re-
sources Review Commission in being?
which are provided for in S. 2305?and 
a Travel Advisory Council, patterned 
after the Business Council giving the in-
dustry a spokesman before Federal Gov-
ernment councils, the United States 
would have the appropriate means to 
transform this Nation into the first 
ranking travel Nation it could and should 
be. 
I wish once again to commend Holi-
day magazine for undertaking to initiate 
the Travel Advisory Council and urge 
the U.S. travel industry to give this pro-
posal its earnest and sympathetic con-
siderations. 
I ask unanimous consent that a letter 
circulated among 'U.S. travel industry on 
this subject by Garth Hite, vice presi-
dent and publisher of Holiday magazine 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letter 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
HoLmArr, 
New York, N.Y. 
Admittedly, this is a very long letter. It 
concerns, however, a subject that is very 
important to you and to us?the travel in-
dustry. I must ask your indulgence, then, 
to spend a little more time with this letter 
than with the usual correspondence. 
The proposal seriously advanced earlier 
this year to President Johnson by the Federal 
Reserve Board and the Department of Treas-
ury to correct the balance-of-payments 
deficit by imposing a $100 penalty tax upon 
all Americans traveling butside the country 
was viewed by Holiday with considerable 
anxiety. While the proposal was discarded 
by the President, this decision is considered 
a temporary one to enable the President to 
determine whether or not the deficit can 
be erased by other means. In fact, officials 
of the Department of Commerce have said 
that as long as the balance-of-payments 
deficit remains critical?and they still con-
sider It a crisis situation?the possibility of 
a penalty tax of some kind being imposed 
must be considered. Already passports Is-
sued to Americans in the first 3 months 
of 1965 have shot up nearly 13 percent over 
the total issued in the same period last year. 
This development has been noted with mis-
givings by some Government officials. 
Immediately after the head tax proposal 
was offered, Holiday launched what eventu-
ally developed into a very thorough in-
vestigation of the travel industry and its 
relations (or more accurately its lack of 
them) with the Federal Government. We do 
not believe that undue criticism should be 
directed at the Government; the major 
fault?if it can be called that?lies within 
the travel industry as a whole in that it has 
failed to communicate with Government. 
Our primary goal was to determine how well 
organized the industry was to deal with what 
may have been a serious threat to overseas 
travel, but this later was broadened into a 
searching look at the industry's present 
ability to protect itself, not merely against 
the penalty tax threat, but against any other 
danger, now unforeseen, that may arise with-
out warning in the months ahead. Equally 
important, we sought to learn how well, if 
at all, the travel industry had impressed 
the Government and the public with its im-
portance to the national economy, and the 
need for encouraging rather than harassing 
an industry that is now the third largest in 
the Nation. We are well aware, of course, 
that other companies and groups?American 
Express, Pan American, Travel Agent maga-
zine, Travel Weekly, ASTA, and Infoplan, 
among others?have done considerable prob-
lng of the problem and have compiled a great 
deal of information on this subject. 
The results of Holiday's general inquiry, 
which was based upon interviews with Gov-
ernment officials concerned with travel mat-
ters as well as with executives of the various 
travel organizations, were predictable but 
dismaying. While all of the different groups 
within the industry were organized accord-
ing to their immediate interests, no organiza-
tion existed to speak for the industry as a 
whole or to unite it for common defense. 
Stated briefly, these facts emerged: 
PROM THE GOVERNMENT 
An acknowledgment that there was no 
central, responsible source recognized by the 
Government to which it could turn for sta-
tistics 'covering the entire travel industry. 
2. An expressed willingness to recognize 
and cooperate with a central organization 
which would represent the industry. 
3. Widely varying and often conflicting 
data quoted by the Government in its state-
ments on the balance-of-payments deficit, 
the value of travel to the national economy, 
and the indirect responsibility of tourism in 
enlarging certain sales and export figures. 
(Notably in the aircraft industry.) 
4. A determination to reduce by persua-
sion, if by no other means, the oversea travel 
of U.S. citizens. 
raom THE INDUSTRY 
1. A general feeling of anxiety growing 
from a realization that a large and powerful 
industry lacks the organization to protect its 
own welfare. 
' 2. A universal feeling that the risks in-
herent in this situation are more likely to 
increase than decrease in the years ahead, 
since the established pattern of Government 
control is obviously an expanding one. 
3. A general conviction that the travel in-
dustry has grown to the point where, aside 
from any Government threats, it would be 
in its own best interests to have the means 
of providing reliable statistics and informa-
tion to the public. 
Many other facts, not connected with 
spending or the economy, also- were disclosed 
by these talks. Passport and custom policies, 
the tying-in of the President's beautification 
program with domestic travel, public invest-
ment in the expansion of our national park 
system, future scope of the U.S. Travel Serv-
ice, and the difficulties faced by the White 
Flouse in recruiting top travel executives for 
Government posts?all were discussed with 
the appropriate authorities and all reflected 
a generally unilateral point of view rather 
than one incorporating the views of both the 
Government and the industry. 
Admittedly, the travel industry is com-
posed of a number of businesses that are 
widely divergent---such as motels, railroads, 
gas stations, airlines, shiplines, resorts, and 
car rentals?yet the mobility of man is a 
common thread that links them together and 
provides each with a stake in the economic 
ren-being of the entire industry. But be-
cause the industry is splintered and ranges 
so broadly, it is difficult to imagine a single 
organization that can serve all of its varied 
Interests. In fact, the usual trade associa-
tion concept would contain so many inev-
itable conflicts of interests, between types 
of carriers, between overseas and domestic 
travel, between regions, etc., that it would 
be totally unworkable. 
The full potential of the travel industry is 
difficult to prophesy but it is conceivable 
that within 25 years it will be established 
as the world's largest industry. Long before 
this happens, and hopefully before some now 
unforeseen mishap occurs, the U.S. travel 
industry should erect some kind of organiza-
tional structure to advance its best interests. 
In studying examples of organizations cre-
ated to work with the Federal Government, 
the one that seems most adaptable to the 
peculiarities of the travel industry is the

I think it is inappropriate to come in 
at this late hour and try to change the 
site without any provision for money 
to buy the site. Th& bill merely provides 
for a site in the vicinity of the Pennsyl-
vania Avenue development program. It 
seems to me this is quite realistic. If it 
had been provided for originally and we 
had been able to get a site, it would be 
another matter, but a great amount of 
time, money, and effort have been ex-
pended on the development of the site. 
Aside from that fact, I think it comes 
too late to try to change it now. It 
would destroy the present concept al-
together. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I am 
very glad that the Senator from Ar-
kansas has commented on the pending 
Cultural Center site. As a member of the 
District of Columbia Committee, let me 
say that in view of the developments, I 
believe it is an excellent choice. It would 
be a great mistake to try to disrupt the 
program now by getting into controversy 
over location of the center. The pro-
gram is coming along nicely. 
As the Senator from Arkansas knows, 
it is expected that a substantial drive 
will be conducted to obtain private funds 
and contributions. Our citizens have 
been led to believe that the site has been 
agreed upon. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Some $15 million 
has been raised privately. 
Mr. MORSE. Yes, the Senator is cor-
rect, but not only that, as we look at the 
situation in retrospect, and when we take 
into account the plans which are now in 
the blueprint stage for other develop-
ments in the District of Columbia, I be-
lieve that it is an excellent site. 
This may be a sentimental argument 
on my part, but I believe it is a most 
appropriate site in view of the fact that 
President Kennedy's burial place is just 
across the river, with its everlasting 
torch aflame. Thus, this center will be 
among other shrines in the area, such 
as the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson 
Memorial, and other memorials. The 
Cultural Center is, after all, being built 
as a great memorial to our great Presi-
dent Kennedy, and is most appropriately 
located at the site ,which has been 
selected. 
Accordingly, I sincerely hope that 
plans for completing the Center will pro-
ceed without any controversy being 
raised at this date over its location. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I thank the 
Senator from Oregon for his comments. 
They are entirely appropriate. 
REMARKS OF SENATOR THOMAS J. 
DODD CONCERNING A CHRONOL-
OGY PUBLISHED BY THE COM-
MITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS 
ON THE SITUATION IN THE DO-
MINICAN REPUBLIC 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, the 
senior Senator from Connecticut [Mr. 
Dom] has today issued a press release 
entitled "Senator DODD Charges Foreign 
Relations Publication on Dominican 
Crisis Slanted Against Administration." 
The allegation is that the chronology 
quoted exclusively from press sources 
critical of administration policy in the 
Dominican Republic. The remarks of 
the senior Senator from Connecticut in-
cluded complaints that the chronology 
did not bear statements favorable to the 
position of the administration. 
The facts are as follows: 
First. The document to which the sen-
ior Senator refers was issued in early 
July for use of the committee in connec-
tion with its effort to learn in detail of 
developments in the Dominican Republic. 
It was compiled, as noted in the preface, 
from material "collected with the assist-
ance of the Legislative Reference Service 
of the Library of Congress, the Depart-
ment of State, and the staff of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations." Because 
of shortage of time, the staff of the com-
mittee in compiling the chronology made 
extensive use of a research instrument to 
which it subscribes entitled "Deadline 
Data." 
Second. The statement of the senior 
Senator from Connecticut leaves the im-
pression that the administration views 
were not? adequately presented in the 
chronology. Members should note, how-
ever, that the chronology and the ac-
companying printed material includes 
not only a numlier of documents issued 
by the Organization of American States, 
but six statements by President Johnson, 
and a number of statements by the De-
partment of State and one by Ambas-
sador Stevenson. 
Third. I do wish to expres my regret 
that it has not been possible for the 
senior Senator from Connecticut [Mr. 
Dons] to attend meetings of the Foreign 
Relations Committee on this subject. 
Much of the material to which he re-
ferred has been considered by the com-
mittee. 
Fourth. Finally, I wish the RECORD to 
show that all of the witnesses which the 
committee heard at the sessions not at-
tended by the Senator from Connecticut 
were administration witnesses, save one. 
We heard the testimony of Secretary of 
State Rusk, Under Secretary of State 
Mann, Deputy Secretary of Defense 
Vance, Ambassador Bennett, Admiral 
Raborn, Director of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency, and Assistant Secretary of 
State for American Republics Affairs 
Vaughn. The only non-Government wit-
ness called before the committee was the 
former Governor of Puerto Rico, the 
Honorable Luis Mulioz-Marin. 
Investgiations of acts of the executive 
department by their very nature, as the 
Senator well knows, put the burden on 
the administration to prove that its ac-
tions were correct. I believe that a fair 
criticism of the committee might be that 
It put too much time and effort into the 
examination of Government witnesses, 
and not enough into examination of 
Government critics. 
The committee has met on 13 different 
occasions, compiling some 760 pages of 
testimony. Most of the meetings have 
been 2 or 3 hours in length. The senior 
Senator from Connecticut attended one 
of these meetings, and a search of the 
committee records indicates that he has 
not seen fit to consult the transcripts of 
those hearings. 
FURTHER AMENDMENT OF FOR-
EIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961?
CONFERENCE REPORT 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
submit a report of the committee of con-
ference on the disagreeing votes of the 
two Houses on the amendment of the 
Senate to the bill (H.R. 7750) to amend 
further the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended, and for other purposes. 
I ask unanimous consent for the present 
consideration of the report. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
report will be read for the information 
of the Senate. 
The legislative clerk read the report. 
(For conference report, see House pro-
ceedings of Aug. 18, 1965, pp. 20132-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the present consideration of 
the report? 
There being jio objection, the Senate 
proceeded to ccisider the report. 
TNAM 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, to-
day, there came to my attention a docu-
ment entitled "Why Vietnam," which in-
cludes some historical documents?let-
ters written by President Kennedy and 
President Eisenhower, and statements 
made by President Johnson and Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk. It is a most 
informative document and will be help-
ful to citizens who wish to study step by 
step the nature and extent of our in-
volvement in Vietnam. 
I ask unanimous consent to have this 
document printed in the RECORD for the 
information of all Senators. 
There being no objection, the docu-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
WHY VIETNAM 
FOREWORD 
MY FELLOW AMER/CANS: Once again in 
man's age-old struggle for a better life and 
a world of peace, the wisdom, courage, and 
compassion of the American people are being 
put to the test. This is the meaning of the 
tragic conflict in Vietnam. 
In meeting the present challenge, it is es-
sential that our people seek understanding, 
and that our leaders speak with candor. 
I have therefore directed that this report 
to the American people be compiled and 
widely distributed. In its pages you will 
find statements on Vietnam by three lead-
ers of your Government?by your President, 
your Secretary of State, and your Secretary 
of Defense. 
These statements were prepared for differ-
ent audiences, and they reflect the differing 
responsibilities of each speaker. The con-
gressional testimony has been edited to avoid 
undue repetition and to incorporate the 
sense of the discussions that ensued. 
Together, they construct a clear definition 
of America's role in the Vietnam conflict: 
the dangers and hopes that Vietnam holds 
for all free men, the fullness and limits of 
our national objectives in a war we did not 
seek, the constant effort on our part to bring 
this war we do not desire to a quick and hon-
orable end.

resolutions provide assurances that the costs

the Federal Government as required by the

recreation, and for domestic reserves to meet 
the demands of an ever-increasing popula-

Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall it pass? 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President...I wish to 
take a Minute to state to the Senator 
from Louisiana that I am certainly glad 
the country has had the services of the 
Senator from Louisiana. He serves with 
great distinction, but at the same time 
I would say he should have been a judge, 
for I do not know of anyone who carries 
out his public services with a finer judi-
cial temperament than does the Senator 
from Louisiana in handling the public 
works appropriations and items before 
his subcommittee each year, 
It would certainly be unappreciative 
of me as a Senator from Oregon if I did 
not take just a minute, in behalf of the 
people of my State, to express our thanks 
to the Senator from Louisiana for his 
Impartiality. 
That does not mean that certain 
groups have always been pleased in in-
stances in which certain groups have felt 
they should have obtained some projects, 
but I have said to them, when they have 
expressed their 'disappointment at not 
getting what they wanted, that they are 
indebted and the State is indebted to 
the Senator from Louisiana for his iii-
partiality and fairness and his insistence 
that a group come in and establish its 
ease on its merits. 
The Senator knows that in the many 
years we have served together in the 
Senate I have never asked for anything 
except on the basis of the facts. He has 
weighed them carefully. This year he 
has demonstrated again his judicial tem-
perament. That is why we place so much 
trust and faith in his impartiality.

I have one or two other items I would 
like to refer to while the conference re-
port is being obtained. 
KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE 
PERFORMING ARTS 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, a 
few days ago Representative WIDNALL 
introduced a bill in the House of Repre-
sentatives which requires the relocation 
nof the Kennedy Center for the Perform-
ing Arts. 
I have a memorandum on that subject 
from Roger L. Stevens, who is the Spe-
cial Assistant to the White House on 
the Arts, and is Chairman of the Board 
of Trustees of the Kennedy Center. I ask 
unanimous consent that it be printed in 
the RECORD at this point of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the memo-
randum was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM 
B. WiDNALL 
Concerning your memorandum which I 
received on August 16 about the Kennedy 
Center for the Performing Arts. I will be 
glad to present all your points to the trust-
ees at their next meeting. 
I would like to call your attention to the 
fact that the board of trustees consists of 
a very prominent group of Americans who 
have given both time and money to the 
Center. They are a group that is outstand-
ing in the fields of business, government and 
the performing arts. I am sure they will 
give the points raised every consideration. 
ROGER L. STEVENS, 
Special Assistant on the Arts. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
only wish to add that this matter has 
been pending a long time in Congress. 
I introduced the original bill to provide 
for a site for a center back in 1957. The 
Senator from New Mexico [Mr. ANDER-
SON] and I had a long controversy as to 
where it should be located, I tried to 
get it located on the Mall near the 
Smithsonian Institution. I found that 
the Air Museum had preempted the 
ground. I tried all over the city. This 
was the only site to be obtained.

HOWER TO PRIME MINISTER CHURCHILL, APRIL 
4, 1954 
(Prom Dwight D. Eisenhower, "Mandate for 
Change, 1963-56," New York, 1963) 
DEAR WrNsTorr: I am sure * * * you are 
following with the deepest interest and an-
xiety the daily reports of the gallant fight 
being put up by the French at Dien Bien 
Phu. Today, the situation there does not 
seem hopeless. 
But regardless of the outcome of this par-
ticular battle, I fear that the French can-
not alone see the thing through, this despite 
the very substantial assistance in money and 
materiel that we are giving them. It is no 
solution simply to urge the French to in-
tensify their efforts. And if they do not 
see it through and Indochina passes into 
the hands of the Communists the ultimate 
effect on our and your global strategic posi-
tion with the consequent shift in the power 
ratios throughout Asia and the Pacific could 
be disastrous and, I know, unacceptable to 
yotk and me. * * * This has led us to the 
hard conclusion that the situation in south-
east Asia requires us urgently to take serious 
and far-reaching decisions. 
Geneva is less than 4 weeks away. There 
the possibility of the Communists driving 
a wedge between us will, given the state of 
mind in France, be infinitely greater than 
-at Berlin. I can understand the very natural 
desire of the French to seek an end to this 
war which has been, bleeding them for 8 
years. But our _painstaking search for a way 
out of the impasse has reluctantly forced us 
to the conclusion that there is no negotiated 
solution of the Indochina problem which in 
its essence would not be either a face-saving 
device to cover a French. surrender or a face-
saving device to cover a Communist retire-
ment. The first alternative is too serious in 
its broad strategic implications for us and 
fOr you to be acceptable. * * * 
Somehow we must contrive to bring about 
the second alternative. The preliminary 
lines of our thinking were sketched out by 
Foster [Dulles] in his speech last Monday 
night when he said that under the conditions 
of today the imposition on southeast Asia 
of the political system of Communist Rus-
sia and its Chinese Communist ally, by what-
ever means, would be a grave threat to the 
whole free community, and that in our 'View 
this possibility should now be met by united 
action and not passively accepted. * * * 
I believe that the best way to put teeth in 
this concept and to bring greater moral and 
material resources to the support of the 
French effort is through the establishment 
of a new, ad hoc grouping or coalition com-
posed of nations which have a vital concern 
in the checking of Communist expansion in 
the area. ,/ have in mind, in addition to our 
two countries, France, the Associated States, 
Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the 
Philippines. The U.S. Government would ex-
pect to play its full part in such a coali-
tion. * * * 
The important thing is that the coalition 
must be strong and it must be willing to 
join the fight if necessary. I do not en-
visage the need of any appreciable ground 
forces on your or our part. * * * 
11 I may refer again to history; we failed 
to halt Hirohito, Mussolini, and Hitler by not 
acting in unity and in time. That marked 
the beginning of many years of stark tragedy 
No. 155-21 
and desperate peril. May it not be that our 
nations have learned something from that 
lesson? * * 
With warm regard, 
IKE. 
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT EISENHOWER TO 
PRESIDENT DIEM, OCTOBER 1, 1954 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have been following 
with great interest the course of develop-
ments in Vietnam, particularly since the 
conclusion of the conference at Geneva. The 
implications of the agreement concerning 
Vietnam have caused grave concern regard-
ing the future of a country temporarily di-
vided by an artificial military grouping, 
weakened by a long and exhausting war and 
faced with enemies without and by their 
subversive collaborators within. 
Your recent requests for aid to assist in 
the formidable project of the movement of 
several hundred thousand loyal Vietnamese 
citizens away from areas which are passing 
under a de facto rule and political ideology 
which they abhor, are being fulfilled. I am 
glad that the United States is able to assist 
in this humanitarian effort. 
We have been exploring ways and means to 
permit our aid to Vietnam to be more effec-
tive and to make a greater contribution to 
the welfare and stability of the Government 
of Vietnam. / am, accordingly, instructing 
the American Ambassador to Vietnam to ex-
amine with you in your capacity as Chief of 
Government, how an intelligent program of 
American aid given directly to your govern-
ment can serve to assist Vietnam in its pres-
ent hour of trial, provided that your govern-
ment is prepared to give assurances as to the 
standards of performance it would be able to 
maintain in the event such aid were supplied. 
The purpose of this offer is to assist the 
Government of Vietnam in developing and 
maintaining a strong, viable state, capable of 
resisting attempted subversion or aggression 
through military means. The Government of 
the United States expects that this aid will 
be met by performance on the part of the 
Government of Vietnam in undertaking 
needed reforms. It hopes that such aid, 
combined with your own continuing efforts, 
will contribute effectively toward an inde-
pendent Vietnam endowed with a strong 
government. Such a government 'would, I 
hope, be so responsive to the nationalist as-
pirations of its people, so enlightened in pur-
pose and effective in performance, that it 
will be respected both at home and abroad 
and discourage any who might wish to im-
pose a foreign ideology on your free people. 
Sincerely, 
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. 
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT EISENHOWER TO PRESI-
DENT DIEM, OCTOBER 26, 1960 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: My countrymen and I 
are proud to convey our good wishes to you 
and to the citizens of Vietnam on the fifth 
anniversary of the birth of the Republic of 
Vietnam. 
We? have watched the courage and daring 
with which you and the Vietnamese people 
attained independence in a situation so peri-
lous that many thought it hopeless. We 
have admired the rapidity with which chaos 
yielded to order and progress replaced des-
pair. 
During the years of your independence it 
has been refreshing for us to observe how 
clearly the Government and the citizens of 
Vietnam have faced the fact that the great-
test danger to their independence was com-
munism. You and your countrymen have 
used your strength well in accepting the dqu-
ble challenge of building your country and 
resisting Communist imperialism. In five 
short years since the founding of the Re-
public, the Vietnamese people have developed 
their country in almost every sector. I was 
particularly impressed by one example. I 
am informed that last year over 1,200,000 
20617 
Vietnamese children were able to go to ele-
mentary school; three times as many as were 
enrolled 5 years earlier. This is certainly 
a heartening development for Vietnam's -fu-
tufe. At the same time Vietnam's ability to 
defend itself from the Communists has 
grown immeasurably since its successful 
struggle to become an independent republic. 
Vietnam's very success as well as its poten-
tial wealth and its strategic location have led 
the Communists of Hanoi, goaded by the 
bitterness of their failure to enslave all 
Vietnam, to use increasing violence in their 
attempts to destroy your country's freedom. 
This grave threat, added to the strains and 
fatigues of the long struggle to achieve and 
strengthen independence, must be a burden 
that would cause moments of tension and 
concern in almost any human heart. Yet 
from long observation I sense how deeply 
the Vietnamese value their country's inde-
pendence and strength and I know how well 
you used your boldness when you led your 
countrymen in winning it. I also know that 
your determination has been a vital factor 
in guarding that independence while stead-
ily advancing the economic development of 
your country. I am confident that these 
same qualities of determination and boldness 
will meet the renewed threat as well as the 
needs and desires of your Countrymen for 
further progress on all fronts. 
Although the main responsibility for 
guarding that independence will always, as 
it has in the past, belong to the Vietnamese 
people and their government, I want to as-
sure you that for so long as our strength 
can be useful, the United States will con-
tinue to assist Vietnam in the difficult yet 
hopeful struggle ahead. 
Sincerely, 
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. 
LETTER FROM PRESIDENT KENNEDY TO PRESIDENT 
DIEM, DECEMBER 14, 1961 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I have received your 
recent letter in which you described so 
cogently the dangerous condition caused by 
North Vietnam's efforts to take over your 
country. The situation in your embattled 
country is well known to me and to the 
American people. We have been deeply dis-
turbed by the assault on your country. Our 
indignation has mounted as the deliberate 
savagery of the Communist program of 
assassination, kidnaping, and wanton vio-
lence became clear. 
Your letter underlines what our own in-
formation has convincingly shown?that the 
campaign of force and terror now being 
waged against your people and your Govern-
ment is supported and directed from the 
outside by the authorities at Hanoi. They 
have thus violated the provisions of the 
Geneva accords designed to insure peace in 
Vietnam and to which they bound themselves 
in 1954. 
At that time, the United States, although 
not a party to the accords, declared that it 
"would view any renewal of the aggression 
in violation of the agreements with grave 
concern and as seriously threatening inter-
national peace and security." We continue 
to maintain that view. 
In accordance with that declaration, and 
in response to your request, we are prepared 
to help the Republic of Vietnam to protect its 
people and to preserve its independence. We 
shall promptly increase our assistance to 
your defense effort as well as help relieve the 
destruction of the floods which you describe. 
I have already given the orders to get these 
programs underway. 
The United States, like the Republic of 
Vietnam, remains devoted to the cause of 
peace and our primary purpose is to help 
your people maintain their independence. If 
the Communist authorities in North Vietnam 
will stop their campaign to destroy the Re-
public of Vietnam, the measures we are tak-
ing to assist your defense efforts will no

longer be necessary. We shall seek to per-
suade the Communists to give up their 
attempts of force and subversion. In any 
case, we are confident that the Vietnamese 
people will preserve their independence and 
gain the peace and prosperity for which they 
have sought so hard and so long. 
Jostle F. KENNEDY. 
TOWARD PEACE WITH HONOR , 
(Press conference statement by the Presi-
dent, the White House, July 28, 1965) 
Not long ago I received a letter from a 
woman in the Midwest. She wrote: 
"DEAR MR. PREZIDENT: In my humble way 
I am writing to you about the crisis in Viet-
nam. I have a eon who is now in Vietnam. 
My husband served in World War IL Our 
country was at war, but now, this time, it is 
just something I don't understand. Why?" 
I have tried to answer that question a doz-
en times and more in practically every State 
in this Union. I discussed it fully in Balti-
more in April, in Washington in May, in San 
Francisco in June, I.,et me, again, now, dis-
cuss it here in the East Room of the White 
House. 
Why must young Americans, born into a 
land exultant with hope end golden with 
promise, toil and suffer and sometimes die in 
such a remote and distant place? , 
The answer, like the war itself, is not an 
easy one. But it echoes Clearly from the 
painful lessons of half a century. Thrcc 
times in my lifetime, in two world wars and 
In Korea, Americans have gone to far lands 
to fight for freedom. We have learned at a 
terrible and brutal cost that retreat does not 
bring safety, and weakness does not bring 
peace. 
The nature of the war 
It is this lesson that has brought us to 
Vietnam. This is a different kind of war. 
There are no marching armies or solemn dec-
larations. Some citizens of South Vietnam, 
at times with understandable grievances, 
have joined in the attack on their own gov-
ernrnent. But we must not let this mask the 
Central fact that this is really war. It is 
guided by North Vietnam and spurred by 
Communist China. Its goal is to conquer 
the South, to defeat "Arneriean power, and to 
extend the Asiatic dominion of communism. 
The stakes in Vietnam 
And there are great stakes in the balance. 
Most of the non-Communist nations of 
Asia cannot, by themselves and alone, resist 
the growing might and grasping ambition 
of Asian communism. Our asower,ttherefore, 
is a vital shield. If we are driven from the 
field in Vietnam, then no? nation can ever 
again have the same confidence in American 
promise, or in American protection. In each 
land the forces of independence would be 
considerably weakened. And an Asia so 
threatened by communist domination would 
imperil the security of the United States 
itself. 
We did not choose to be the guardians at 
the gate, but there is no one else. 
Nor would surrender in Vietnam bring 
peace. We learned from Hitler at Munich 
that success only feeds the appetite of ag-
gression. The battle would be renewed in 
one country and then another, bringing with 
it perhaps even larger and crueler conflict. 
Moreover, we are in Vietnam to fulfill one 
of the most solemn pledges of the American 
Nation. Three Presidents?President Eisen-
hower, President Kennedy, and your present 
President?over 11 years, have committed 
themselves and have promised to help defend 
this small and valiant nation. 
Strengthened by that promise, the people 
of South Vietnam have fought for many long 
years. Thousands of them have died. Thou-
sands more have been crippled and scarred 
by war. We cannot now dishonor our word 
Or abandon our corhbeitment or leave those 
Who believed Its and who trusted us to the 
error and repression and murder that would 
follow. 
This, then, my fellow Americans, is why 
we are in Vietnam. 
Increased effort to halt aggression 
What are our goals in that war-stained 
land? 
First: We intend to convince the Commu-
nists that we cannot be defeated by force 
of arms or by superior power. They are not 
easily convinced. In recent months they 
have greatly increased their , fighting forces, 
their attacks, and the number of incidents. 
I have asked the commanding general, Gen-
eral Westmoreland, what more he needs to 
meet this mounting aggression. He has told 
me. We will meet his needs. 
I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air 
Mobile Division and certain other forces 
which will raise our fighting strength from 
75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately. 
Additional forces will be needed later, and 
they will be sent as requested. This will 
make it necessary to increase our active fight-
ing forces by raising the monthly draft call 
from 17,000 over a period of time, to 35,000 
per month, and stepping up our campaign for 
voluntary enlistments. 
After this past week of deliberations, I have 
concluded that it is not essential to order 
Reserve units into service now. If that ne-
cessity should later be indicated, I will give 
the matter most careful consideration. And 
I will give the country adequate notice before 
taking such action, but only after full 
preparations. 
We have also discussed with the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam lately the steps that 
they will take to substantially increase their 
own effort?both on the battlefield and 
toward reform and progress in the villages. 
Ambassador Lodge is now formulating a new 
program to be tested upon his return to 
that area. 
I have directed Secretary Rusk and Secre-
tary McNamara to be available immediately 
to the Congress to review with the appro-
priate congressional committees our plan in 
these areas. I have asked them to be avail-
able to answer the questions of any Member 
of Congress. 
Secretary McNamara, in addition, will ask 
the Senate Appropriations Committee to add 
a limited amount to present legislation to 
help meet part of this new cost until a sup-
plemental measure is ready and hearings can 
-be held when the Congress assembles in 
January. 
Di the meantime, we will use the authority 
contained in the present Defense appropri-
ations bill now to transfer funds, in addition 
to the additional money that we will request. 
These steps, like our actions in the past, 
are carefully measured to do what must be 
done to bring an end to aggression and a 
peaceful settlement. We do not want an 
expanding struggle with consequences that 
no one can foresee. Nor will we bluster or 
bully or flaunt our power. 
But We will not surrender, And we will 
not retreat. 
For behind our American pledge lies the 
determination and resources of all of the 
American Nation. 
Toward a peaceful solution 
Second, once the Communists know, as we 
know, that a violent solution is impossible, 
then a peaceful solution is inevitable. We 
are ready now, as we have always been, to 
move from the battlefield to the conference 
table. I have stated publicly, and many 
times. America's willingness to begin un-
conditional discussions with any government 
at any place at any time. l'ifteen efforts 
have been made to start these discussions, 
with the help of 40 nations throughout the 
world. But there has been no answer. 
But We are going to continue to persist, 
If persist we must, until death and desola-
tion have led to the same conference table 
where Others could noW join us at a much 
smaller cost. 
I have spoken many times of our objec-
tives in Vietnam. So has the Government of 
South Vietnam. Hanoi has set forth its own 
proposal. We are ready to discuss their pro-
posals and our proposals and any proposals of 
any government whose people may be af-
fected. For we fear the meeting room no 
more than we fear the battlefield. 
The United Nations 
In this pursuit we welcome, and we ask 
for, the concern and the assistance of any 
nation and all nations. If the United Na-
tions and its officials?or any one of its 114 
members?can, by deed or word, private ini-
tiative or public action, bring us nearer an 
honorable peace, then they will have the 
support and the gratitude of the United 
States of America. 
I have directed Ambassador Goldberg to go 
to New York today and to present immedi-
ately to Secretary-General U Thant a letter 
from me requesting that all of the resources, 
energy, and immense prestige of the United 
Nations be employed to find ways to halt 
aggression and to bring peace in Vietnam. 
I made a similar request at San Francisco a 
few weeks ago. 
Free choice for Vietnam 
We do not seek the destruction of any 
government, nor do we covet a foot of any 
territory. But we insist, and we will always 
insist, that the people of South Vietnam 
shall have the right of choice, the right to 
shape their own destiny in free elections in 
the South, or throughout all Vietnam under 
international supervision. And they shall 
not have any government imposed upon 
them by force and terror so long as we can 
prevent it. 
This was the purpose of the 1954 agree-
ments which the Communists have now 
cruelly shattered. If the machinery of those 
agreements was tragically weak, its purposes 
still guide our action. 
As battle rages, we scull continue as best 
we can to help the good people of South 
Vietnam enrich the condition of their life--
to feed the hungry, to tend the sick?teach 
the young, shelter the homeless, and help 
the farmer to increase his crops, and the 
worker to find a job. 
Progress in human welfare 
It is an ancient, but still terrible, irony 
that while many leaders of men create divi-
sion in pursuit of grand ambitions, the chil-
dren of man are united in the simple elusive 
desire for a life of fruitful and rewarding 
toil. 
As I said at Johns Hopkins in Baltimoee. I 
hope that one day we can help all the people 
of Asia toward that desire. Eugene Black 
has made great progress since my appearance 
in Baltimore in that direction, not as the 
price of peace?for we are ready always to 
bear a snore painful cost?but rather as a 
part of our obligations of justice toward our 
fellow man. 
The difficulty of decision 
Let me also add a personal note. I do not 
find it easy to send the flower of our youth, 
our finest young men, into battle. I have 
spoken to you today of the divisions and the 
forces and the battalions and the unite. But 
I know them all, every one. I have seen them 
in a thousand streets, in a hundred towns, in 
every State in this Union?working aril 
laughing, building, and filled with hope and 
life. I think that I k:now, too, how their 
mothers weep and how their families sorrow. 
This is the most agonizing and the most 
painful duty of your President. 
A nation which builds 
There is something else, too. When I was 
young, poverty was so common that we didn't 
know it had a name. Education was some-
thing you had to fight for. And water wee 
life itself. I have now been in public life 
35 years, more than three decades, and in 
each of those 35 years I have seen good men,

and wise leaders, struggle to bring the 
blessings of this land to all of our people. 
Now I am the President. It is now my op-
portunity to help every child get an educa-
tion, to help every Negro and every American 
citizen have an equal opportunity, to help 
every family get a decent home a..nd to help 
bring healing to the sick and dignity to the 
old. 
As I have said before, that is what I have 
lived for. That is what I have wanted all 
my life. And I do not want to see all those 
hopes and all those dreams of so many peo-
ple for so many years now drowned in the 
wasteful ravages of war. I am going to do all 
I can to see that that never happens, 
But I also know, as a realistic public 
servant, that as long as there are men who 
hate and destroy we must have the courage 
to resist, or we will see it all, all that we have 
built, all that we hope to build, all of our 
dreams for freedom?all swept away on the 
flood, of conquest. 
So this too shall not happen; we will stand 
In Vietnam. 
THE TAERIP OP DIPLOMACY 
(Statement by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, 
before the House Foreign Affairs Commit-
tee, August 3, 1965) 
As the President has said, ''there are great 
stakes in the balance", in Vietnam today. 
Let us be clear about those stakes. With 
its archipelagos, southeast Asia contains rich 
natural resources and some 200 million peo-
ple. Geographically, it has great strategic 
importance-4t dominates the gateway be-
tween the Pacific and Indian Oceans and 
flanks the Indian subcontinent on one side, 
and Australia and New Zealand on the other. 
The loss of southeast Asia to the Communists 
would constitute a serious shift in the bal-
ance of power against the interests of the free 
world, And the loss of South Vietnam would 
make the defense of the rest of southeast 
Asia Much more costly and difficult. That 
is why the SEATO Council has said that the 
defeat of the aggression against South Viet-
nam is "essential" to the security of south-
east Asia. 
But much more is at stake than preserv-
ing the independence of the peoples of south-
east Asia and preventing the vast resources 
of that area from being swallowed by those 
hostile to freedom. 
The test 
The war in Vietnam is a test of a techniqne 
of aggression: what the Communists, in 
their upside-down language, call wars of na-
tional liberation. They use the term to de-
scribe any effort by Communists, short of 
large-scale war, to destroy by force any non-
Communist government. Thus the leaders 
of the Communist terrorists in such an in-
dependent democracy as Venezuela are de-
scribed as leaders of a fight for "national 
liberation." And a recent editorial in Pravda 
said that "the upsurge of the national libera-
tion movement in Latin American countries 
has been to a great extent a result of the ac-
tivities of Communist Parties." 
Communist leaders know, as the rest of the 
world knows, that thermonuclear war would 
be ruinous. They know that large-scale in-
vasions, such as that launched in Korea 15 
years ago, would bring great risks and heavy 
penalties. So, they have resorted to semi-
concealed aggression through the infiltration 
of arms and trained military personnel across 
national frontiers. And the Asian Commu-
nists themselves regard the war in Vietnam 
as a critical test of that technique. Re-
cently General Giap, leader of North Viet-
nam's army said: 
"If the special warfare that the U.S. im-
perialists are testing in South Vietnam is 
overcome, then it can be defeated everywhere 
In the world." 
In southeast Asia, the Communists al-
ready have publicly designated Thailand as 
the next target. And if the aggression 
against South Vietnam were permitted to 
succeed, the forces of militant communism 
everywhere would be vastly heartened and 
we could expect to see a series of so-called 
wars of liberation in Asia, Latin America, and 
Africa. ? 
International law does not restrict internal 
revolution. But it does restrict what third 
powers may lawfully do in sending arms and 
men to bring about insurrection. What 
North Vietnam is doing in South Vietnam 
flouts not only the Geneva Accords of 1954 
and 1962 but general international law. 
The assault on the Republic of Vietnam is, 
beyond question, an aggression. It was orga-
nized and has been directed by North Viet-
nam, with the backing of Communist China. 
The cadres of guerrilla fighters, saboteurs, 
and assassins who form the backbone of the 
Vietcong were specially trained in the North. 
Initially, many of them were men of South 
Vietnamese birth who had fought with the 
Viet Minh against the French and gone North 
in their military units after Vietnam was 
divided in 1954. But that reservoir was 
gradually exhausted. During 1964 and since, 
most of the military men infiltrated from 
the North have been natives of North Viet-
nam. And near the end of last year they 
began to include complete units of the regu-
lar North Vietnamese army. In addition to 
trained men and political and military direc-
tion, the North has supplied arms and am-
munition in increasing quantities?in con-
siderable part of Chinese manufacture. 
Between 1959 and the end of 1964, 40,000 
trained military personnel came down from 
the North into South Vietnam, by conserva-
tive estimate. More have come this year. 
Had all these crossed the line at once?as 
the North Koreans did in invading South 
Korea 15 years ago?nobody in the free world 
could have doubted that the assault on Viet-
nam was an aggression. That the dividing 
line between North and South Vietnam was 
intended to be temporary does not make the 
attack any less of an aggression. The di-
viding line in Korea also was intended to be 
temporary. 
If there is ever to be peace in this world, 
aggression must cease. We as a Nation are 
committed to peace and the rule of law. We 
recognize also the harsh reality that our se-
curity is involved. 
We are committed to oppose aggression not 
only through the United Nations Charter 
but through many defensive alliances. We 
have'42 allies, not counting the Republic of 
Vietnam. And many other nations know 
that their security depends upon us. Our 
power and our readiness to use it to assist 
others to resist aggression, the integrity of 
our commitment, these are the bulwarks of 
peace in the world. 
If we were to fail in Vietnam, serious con-
sequences would ensue. Our adversaries 
would be encouraged to take greater risks 
elsewhere. At the same time, the confidence 
which our allies and other free nations now 
have in our commitments would be seriously 
impaired. 
The commitment 
Let us be clear about our commitment in 
Vietnam. 
It began with the Southeast Asir Treaty, 
which was negotiated and signed after the 
Geneva agreements and the cease-fire in 
Indochina in 1954 and was approved by the 
U.S. Senate by a vote of 82 to 1 in February 
1955. That treaty protects against Com-
munist aggression not only its members but 
any of the three non-Communist states 
growing out of former French Indochina 
which asks for protection. 
Late in 1954 President Eisenhower, with 
bipartisan support, decided to extend aid to 
South Vietnam, both economic aid and aid 
in training its armed forces. His purpose, 
as he said, was to "assist the Government 
of Vietnam in developing and maintaining 
20619 
a strong, viable state, capable of resistinr; 
attempted subversion or aggression through 
military Means." 
Vietnam became a republic in 1955, was 
recognized as an independent nation by 36 
nations initially, and is so recognized by more 
than 50 today. 
Beginning in 1955, the Congress has each 
year approved overall economic and military 
assistance programs in which the continua-
tion of major aid to South Vietnam has been 
specifically considered. 
During the next 5 years, South Vietnam 
made remarkable economic and social prog-
ress?what some observers described as a 
-miracle." 
Nearly a million refugees from the north 
were settled. These were the stouthearted 
people of whom the late Dr. Tom Dooley 
wrote so eloquently in his first book, "Deliver 
Us From Evil," and who led him to devote 
the rest of his all-too-brief life to helping 
the people of Vietnam and Laos. 
A land-reform program was launched. A 
comprehensive system of agricultural credit 
was set up. Thousands of new schools and 
more than 3.500 village health stations were 
built. Rail transportation was restored and 
roads were repaired and improved. South 
Vietnam not only fed itself but resumed 
ric-, exports. Production of rubber and sugar 
rose sharply. New industries were started. 
Per capita income rose by 20 percent. 
By contrast, North Vietnam suffered a drop 
of 10 percent in food production and dis-
apoointments in industrial production. 
In 1954, Hanoi almost certainly had ex-
pected to take over South Vietnam within a 
few years. But by 1959 its hopes had with-
ered and the south was far outstripping the 
heralded "Communist paradise." These al-
most certainly were the factors which led 
Hanoi to organize and launch the assault 
on the south. 
I beg leave to quote from a statement I 
made at a press conference on May 4, 1961: 
"Since-late in 1959 organized Communist 
activity in the form of guerrilla raids against 
army and security units of the Government 
of Vietnam, terrorist acts against local offi-
cials and civilians, and other subversive 
activities in the Republic of Vietnam have 
increased to levels unprecedented since the 
Geneva agreements of 1954. During this 
period the organized armed strength of the 
Vietcong, the Communist apparatus oper-
ating in the Republic of Vietnam, has grown 
from about 3,000 to over 12,000 personnel. 
This armed strength has been supplemented 
by an increase in the numbers of political 
and propaganda agents in the area. 
"During 1960 alone, Communist armed 
units and terrorists assassinated or kidnaped 
over 3,000 local officials, military personnel, 
and civilians. Their-activities took the form 
of armed attacks against isolated garrisons, 
attacks on newly established townships, am-
bushes on roads and canals, destruction of 
bridges, and well-planned sabotage against 
public works and communication lines. Be-
cause of Communist guerrilla activity 200 ele-
mentary schools had to be closed at various 
times, affecting over 25,000 students and 800 
teachers. 
"This upsurge of Communist guerrilla ac-
tivity apparently stemmed from a decision 
made in May 1959 by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of North Vietnam 
which called for the reunification of Vietnam 
by all 'appropriate means.' In July of the 
same year the Central Committee was re-
organized and charged with intelligence 
duties and the liberation of South Viet-
nam. In retrospect this decision to step up 
guerrilla activity was made to reverse the 
remarkable success which the Government 
of the Republic of Vietnam under President 
Ngo Dinh Diem had achieved in consolidating 
its political position and in attaining sig-
nificant economc recovery in the 5 years 
between 1954 and 1959.

20620 CONGRESSIONAL itrainli ? SENATE August 2,1965 
"Remarkably coincidental with the re-
newed Communist activity in Laos, the Com-
munist Party of North Vietnam at its Third 
Congress on September 10, 1960, adopted a 
resolution which declared that the Vietna-
mese revolution ha a as a Major strategic teak 
the liberation of the South from the 'rule of 
U.S. hriperialists and their henchmen! This 
resolution called for the direct overtinoW 
the Government of the Republic of Viet-
nam." 
Next door to South Vietnam, Laos Was 
threatened by a similar Comniunist assault. 
The active agent of attack on both was Com-
munist North Vietnam, with the backing of 
Peiping and Moscow. In the case of Laos, we 
were able to negotiate an agreement in 1962 
that it should be neutral and that all foreign 
military personnel should be withdrawn. 
We complied with that agreement. But 
North Vietnam never did. In gross violation 
of its pledge, it left armed units in Laos and 
continued to use Laos as es eerrictor to infil-
trate arms and trained Mali into South 
Vietnam. 
There was no new agreement, even on 
paper, on Vietnam. Late in 1961, President 
Kennedy therefore increased our assistance 
to the Republic of Vietnam. During that 
year, the infiltration of arms and military 
personnel from the North continued to in-
crease. To cope with that escalation, Presi-
dent Kennedy decided to send more 
American minter/ personnel?to assist with 
logistics and transportation and communi-
cations as well as with training and as ad-
visers to Se:31th Viet'sufmese forces in the 
field. Likewise, isa eisparided our economic 
assistance and teehriical advice, particularly 
with a view to improving living conditions 
in the vallages. 
During 1962 and 1963, Hanoi continued to 
increase its assistance te the Vietcong. In 
response, President Kennedy and later Pres-
ident Johnson increased Our aid. 
Ealaol keen on escalating the war through-
out 1964. -And the Vietcong intensified its 
drafting and training of men in the areas it 
controls. ' 
Laid August, you will recall, North Viet-
namese forces attacked American destroyers 
in international waters. That attack was met 
by appropriate air response against North 
Vietnamese naval Installations. And Con-
greet, by a tombined vote of tem to 2, passed 
a 
resolution expressing its support for actions 
by the Executive "Including the use of armed 
force" to meet aggression in southeast Asia, 
inch:Wing specifically aggression against 
South Vietnam. The resolution and the con-
gressional debate specifically envisaged that, 
ttablect iso continuing congressional consulta-
tion, the Armed Forces of the United States 
might be committed in the defense of South 
Vietnam in any way that seemed necessary 
including employment in combat. 
In summary, our coMItiltwent in Vietnam 
has been set forth in the Southeast Asia, 
Treaty, whir+, was almost unanimously ap-
proved by the U.S. Senates the pledges made 
with bipartisan support by three successive 
Presidents of the United States; the assist-
ance programs approved annually, beginning 
in 1955, by bipartisan majorities in both 
Honies of Congress; the declarations which 
we joined 'our SEATO and ANZUS allies in 
making at their Ministerial Coumeil Meetings 
in 1964 and 1966 'the joint congressional ras - 
olution of August 1964; which was approved 
bye combined vote of 504 tOS2 
Cear cortimitnient is to assist the Govern-
ment and people of South Vietnam to repel 
this aggression, thus preserving their free-
dom, This commitment is to the South 
Vietnamese as a nation and people. It has 
continued through various changes of gov-
ernment, just as our comMiltments to our 
NATO allies remain unaltered by changes in 
government. 
Continued escalation of the aggression by 
the other side has required continued 
strengthening Of the military" defenses of 
South Vietnam. Whether still more Ameri-
can military personnel will be needed will 
depend on events, especially on whether the 
other side continues to escalate the aggres-
sion. As the President has made plain, we 
will provide the South Vietnamese with 
whatever assistance may be necessary to en-
sure that the aggression against them is ef-
fectively repelled?that is, to make good on 
our commitment. 
The -pursuit of a peaceful settlement 
As President Johnson and his predecessors 
have repeatedly emphasized, our objective 
in southeast Asia is peace?a peace in which 
the various peoples of the area can manage 
their own affairs in their own ways and ad-
dress themselves to economic and social prog-
ress. , 
We seek no bases or special position for the 
United States. We do not seek to destroy or 
overturn the Communist regimes in Hanoi 
and Peiping. We ask only that they cease 
their aggressions, that they leave their neigh-
bors alone: 
Repeatedly, we and others have sought to 
achieve a peaceful settlement of the war in 
Vietnam. 
We have had many talks with the Soviet 
authorities over a period of more than 4 
years. But their influence in Hanoi appears 
to be 'Malted. Recently, when approached, 
their response has been, in. substance: You 
have come to the wrong address?nobody has 
authorized us to negotiate. Talk to Hanoi. 
We have had a long series of talks with the 
Chinese Communists in Warsaw. Although 
Peiping is more cautious in action than in 
word, it is unbending in it hostility to us 
and plainly opposed to any negotiated settle-
ment in Vietnam. 
There have been repeated contacts with 
Hanoi. Many channels are open. And many 
have volunteered to use them. But so far 
there has been no indication that Hanoi is 
seriously interested in peace on any terms 
except those which would assure a Comniu-
nist takeover of South Vietnam. 
We and others have sought to open the 
way for conferences on the neighboring 
states of Laos and Cambodia, where progress 
toward peace Might be reflected in Vietnam. 
These approaches have been blocked by 
Hanoi and Peiping. 
The United Kingdom, as cochairman of the 
Geneva conferences, has repeatedly sought a 
path to a settlement?first by working to-
ward a new Geneva Conference, then by a 
visit by a senior British statesman. Both 
efforts were blocked by the Communists?
and neither Hanoi nor Peiping would even 
receive the senior British statesman. 
In April, President Johnson offered uncon-
ditional discussions with the governments 
concerned. Hanoi and Peiping called this 
offer a "hoax." 
Seventeen nonalined nations appealed for 
a peaceful solution, by negotiations with-
out preconditions. We accepted the pro-
posal. Hanoi and Red China rejected it with 
scorn, calling some of its authors "mon-
sters and freaks," 
The President of India made a construc-
tive proposal for an end to hostilities and 
an Afro-Asian patrol force. We welcomed 
this proposal with interest and hope. Hanoi 
and Peiping rejected it as a betrayal. 
In May, the United States and South Viet-
nam suspended air attacks on North Viet-
nam. This action was made known to the 
other side to see if there would be a response 
in kind. But Hanoi denounced the pause as 
"a wornout trick" and Peiping denounced 
it as a "swindle." Some say the pause was 
not long enough. But We knees the nega-
tive reaction from the other side before we 
resumed. And we had paused previously for 
more than 4 years while thousands of armed 
men invaded the sosith and killed thousands 
of South Vietnamese, incruding women and 
children, and deliberately destroyed school-
holism and playgrounds and hospitals and 
health centers and other facilities that the 
South Vietnamese had built to improve their 
lives and give their children a chance for a 
better education and better health. 
In late June, the Commonwealth Prime 
Ministers established a mission of four of 
their members to explore with all parties 
concerned the possibilities for a conference 
leading to a just and lasting peace. Hanoi 
and Peiping made it plain that they would 
not receive the mission. 
Mr. Harold Davies, a member of the British 
Parliament, went to Hanoi with the approval 
of Prime Minister Wilson. But the high of-
ficials there would not even talk with him. 
And the lower-ranking officials who did talk 
with him made it clear that Hanoi was not 
yet interested in negotiations, that it was 
intent on a total victory in South Vietnam. 
As Prime Minister Wilson reported to the 
House of Cotnrnons, Mr. Davies met with a 
conviction among the North Vietnamese that 
their prospects of victory were too imminent 
for them to forsake the battlefield for the 
conference table. 
We and others have made repeated efforts 
at discussions through the United Nations. 
In the Security Council, after the August at-
tacks in the Gulf of Tonkin, we supported a 
Soviet proposal that the Government of 
North Vietnam be invited to come to the 
Security Council. But Hanoi refused. 
In April, Secretary General U Thant con-
sidered visits to Hanoi and Peiping to ex-
plore the possibilities of peace. But both 
those Communist regimes made it plain that 
they did not regard the United Nations as 
competent to deal with that matter. 
The President's San Francisco speech in 
June requested help from the 'United Na-
tions' membership at large in getting peace 
talks started. 
In late July the President sent our new 
Ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur J. 
Goldberg, to New York with a letter to 
Secretary General IT Thant requesting that 
all the resources, energy and immense prestige 
of the United Nations be employed to find 
ways to halt aggression and to bring peace 
in Vietnam. The Secretary General has al-
ready accepted this assignment. 
We sent a letter to the Security Council 
calling attention to the special responsibil-
ity in this regard of the Security Council 
and of the nations which happen to be mem-
bers of the Council. We have considered 
from time to time placing the matter formal-
ly before the Security Council. But we have 
been advised by many nations?and by many 
individuals?who are trying to help to 
achieve a peaceful settlement that to force 
debate and a vote in the Security Council 
might tend to harden positions and make 
useful explorations and discussions even 
more difficult. 
President Johnson has publicly invited 
any and all members of the United Nations 
to do all they can to bring about a peaceful 
settlement. 
By these moves the United States has in-
tended to engage the serious attention and 
efforts of the United Nations as an institu-
tion, and its members as signatories of its 
charter, in getting the Communists to talk 
rather than fight?while continuing with 
determination an increasing effort to demon-
strafe that Hanoi and the Vietcong can-
not settle the issue on the battlefield. 
We have not only placed the Vietnam issue 
before the United Nations, but believe that 
we have done so in the most constructive 
ways. 
The conditions for peace 
What are the essential conditions for peace 
in South Vietnam? 
In late June, the Foreign Minister of South 
Vietnam set forth the fundamental princi-
ples of a "just and enduring peace." In 
summary, those principles are: 
An end to aggression and subversion.

August 23, 1965 
rreedom for SOuth Vietnam to choose and 
shape for itself its Ow destiny "in con-
formity with democratic principles and with-
out any foreign interference from whatever 
sources." 
As soon as egression has ceased, the end-
ing of the military measures now necessary 
by the Government of South Vietnam and 
the nations that have come to its aid to de-
fend South Vietnam; and the removal of 
foreign military forces from South Vietnam. 
And effective guarantees for the freedom 
of the people of South Vietnam. 
We endorse those principles. In essence, 
the would constitute a return to the basic 
purpose of the Geneva accords of 1954. 
Whether they require reaffirmation of those 
accords or new agreements embodying these 
essential points, but with provision in either 
case for more effective international ma-
chinery and guarantees, could be determined 
in discussions and negotiations. 
Once the basic points set forth by South 
Vietnam's Foreign Minister were achieved, 
future relations between North Vietnam and 
South Vietnam could be worked out by 
peaceful means. And-this would include the 
question of a free decision by the people of 
North and South Vietnam on the matter of 
reunification. 
When, the aggression has ceased and the 
freedom of South Vietnam is assured by other 
means, we will withdraw our forces. Three 
Presidents of the United States have said 
Many times that we want no permanent bases 
and no special position there. Our military 
forces are there because of the North Viet-
namese aggression against South Vietnam 
and for no other reason. When the men and 
arms inffitrated by the North are withdrawn 
and Hanoi ceases its support and guidance 
of the war in the South, whatever remains 
in the form of indigenous dissent is a matter 
for the South Vietnamese themselves. As for 
South Vietnamese lighting in the Vietcong or 
under its control or influece, they must in 
time be integrated into their national soci-
ety. But that is a process which must be 
brought about by the people of South Viet-
nam, not by foreign diplomats. 
Apart from the search for a solution in 
Vietnam itself, the U.S. Government has 
hoped that discussions could be held on the 
problems concerning Cambodia and Laon. 
We supported the proposal of Prince Siha-
nouk for a conference on Cambodia, to be 
attended by the governments that partici-
pated in the 1954 conference, and noted the 
joint statement of the Soviet Union and the 
Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in April, to 
the effect that both favored the convening 
of conferences on Cambodia and Laos. Sub-
sequently, however, Hanoi appeared to draw 
back and to impose conditions at variance 
with the Cambodian proposal. 
We look beyond a just and enduring peace 
for Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, to the 
day when Peiping will be ready to join in a 
general settlement in the Far East?a gen-
eral settlement that would remove the threat 
of aggression and make it possible for all the 
peoples of the area to devote themselves to 
economic and social progress. 
Several of the nations of Asia are densely 
populated. And high rates of population 
growth make it difficult for them to increase 
per capita incomes. The solution to these 
problems cannot be found through external 
aggression. They must be achieved inter-
nally within each nation. 
As President Johnson has said, the United 
States stands ready to assist and support co-
operative programs for economic develop-
ment in Asia. Already we are making avail-
able additional funds for the development of 
the Mekong Valley. And we are taking the 
lead in organizing an Asian Development 
Bank, which we hope will be supported by 
all the major industrialized nations, includ-
ing the Soviet Union. We would welcome 
membership by North Vietnam, when it has 
ceased its aggression. 
Those are our objectives?peace and a 
better life for all who are willing to live at 
peace with their neighbors. 
The present path 
I turn now to the specific actions we are 
taking to convince Hanoi that it will not suc-
ceed and that it must move toward a peace-
ful solution. 
Secretary McNamara is appearing before 
the appropriate committees of the Congress 
to discuss the military situation within 
South Vietnam in detail. In essence, our 
present view is that it is crucial to turn the 
tide in the south, and that for this purpose 
it is necessary to send substantial numbers 
of additional American forces. 
The primary responsibility for defeating 
the Vietcong will remain, however, with the 
South Vietnamese. They have some 545,000 
men in military and paramilitary forces. De-
spite losses, every branch of the armed forces 
of South Vietnam has more men under arms 
than it had 6 months ago. And they are 
making systematic efforts to increase their 
forces still further. The primary missions 
of American ground forces are to secure the 
air bases used by the South Vietnamese and 
ourselves and to provide a strategic reserve. 
thus releasing South Vietnamese troops for 
offensive actions against the Vietcong. In 
securing the air bases and related military 
installations, American Forces are pushing 
out into the countryside to prevent build-
ups for surprise attacks. And they may be 
used in emergencies to help the South Viet-
namese in combat. But the main task of 
rooting out the Vietcong will continue to be 
the responsibility of the South Vietnamese. 
And we have seen no sign that they are 
about to try to shift that responsibility to 
us. On the contrary, the presence of in-
creasing numbers of American combat troops 
seems to have stimulated greater efforts on 
the part of the fighting men of South Viet-
nam. 
At the same time, on the military side, we 
shall maintain, with the South Vietnamese, 
our program of limited air attacks on mili-
tary targets in North Vietnam. This pro-
gram is a part of the total strategy. We had 
never expected that air attacks on North 
Vietnam alone would bring Hanoi to a quick 
decision to cease its aggression. Hanoi has 
been committed to its aggression too long 
?and too deeply to turn around overnight. 
It must be convinced that it faces not only 
continuing, and perhaps increased, pressure 
on the North itself, but also that it simply 
cannot win in the South. 
The air attacks on the North have also had 
specific military effects in reducing the scale 
of increased infiltration from the North. 
Finally, they are important as a warning to 
all concerned that there are no longer 
sanctuaries for aggression. 
It has been suggested in some quarters 
that Hanoi would be more disposed to move 
to negotiations and to cease its aggression if 
we stopped hornbill.% the North. We do not 
rule out the possibility of another and longer 
pause in bombing, but the question re-
mains?and we have repeatedly asked it: 
What would happen from the North in re-
sponse? Would Hanoi withdraw the 325th 
Division of the Regular Army, which is now 
deployed in South Vietnam and across the 
line in Laos? Would it take home the other 
men it has infiltrated into the South? Would 
it stop sending arms and ammunition into 
South Vietnam? Would the campaign of as-
sassination and sabotage in the South cease? 
We have been trying to find out what would 
happen if we were to suspend our bombing 
of the North. We have not been able to get 
an answer or even a hint. 
Those who complain about air atacks on 
military targets in North Vietnam would 
carry more weight if they had manifested, or 
would manifest now, appropriate concern 
about the infiltrations from, the North, the 
high rate of military activit in the South, 
20621 
and the ruthless campaign of terror and as-
sassination which is being conducted in the 
South under the direction of Hanoi and with 
its active support. 
The situation in South Vietnam 
Let me now underline just a few points 
about the political and economic situation 
in South Vietnam. For we know well that, 
while security is fundamental to turning the 
tide, it remains vital to do all we can on the 
political and economic fronts. 
All of us have been concerned, of course, 
by the difficulties of the South Vietnamese 
in. developing an effective and stable gov-
ernment. But this failure should not as-
tonish us. South Vietnam is a highly plural 
society striving to find its political feet un-
der very adverse conditions. Other nations?
new and old?with fewer difficulties and un-
molested by determined aggressors have done 
no better. South Vietnam emerged from the 
French Indochina war with many political 
factions, most of which were firmly anti-
Communist. Despite several significant ini-
tial successes in establishing a degree of po-
litical harmony, the government of President 
Diem could not maintain a lasting unity 
among the many factions. The recent shift-
ing and reshuffling of Vietnamese Govern-
ments is largely the continuing search for 
political unity and a viable regime which can 
overcome these long-evident political divi-
sions. 
And we should not forget that the destruc-
tion of the fabric of government at all levels 
has been a primary objective of the Viet-
cong. The Vietcong has assassinated thou-
sands of local officials?and health workers 
and schoolteachers and others who were 
helping to improve the life of the people 
of the countryside. In the last year and a 
half, it has killed, wounded, or kidnaped 
2,291 village officials and 22,146 other civil-
ians?these on top of its thousands of earlier 
victims. 
Despite the risks to themselves and their 
families, Vietnamese have continued to come 
forward to fill these posts. And in the last 
6 years, no political dissenter of any con-
sequence has gone over to the Vietcong. 
The Buddhists, the Catholics, the sects, the 
Cambodians (of whom there are about a 
million in South Vietnam), the Montag-
nards?all the principal elements in South 
Vietnamese political life except the Viet-
cong itself, which is a very small minority?
remain overwhelmingly anti-Communist. 
The suggestion that Ho Chi Minh probably 
could win a free election in South Vietnam is 
directly contrary to all the evidence we have. 
And we have a great deal of evidence, for 
we have Americans?in twos and threes and 
fours and sixes?in the countryside in all 
parts of Vietnam. In years past Ho Chi 
Minh was a hero throughout Vietnam. For 
he had led the fight against' the Japanese 
and then against the French. But his glamor 
began to fade when he set up a Communist 
police state in the North?and the South, by 
contrast, made great progress under a non-
Communist nationalist government. Today 
the North Vietnamese regime is badly dis-
credited. We find the South Vietnamese in 
the countryside ready to cooperate with their 
own government when they can do so with 
reasonable hope of not being assassinated by 
the Vietcong the next night. 
At the present time, somewhat more than 
50 percent of the people of Vietnam live in 
areas under shifting control. And about 25 
percent live in areas under varying degrees 
of Vietcong control. But even where it suc-
ceeds in imposing taxes, drafting recruits 
and commandeering labor, th Vietcong has 
not usually been able to organize the area. 
We have jj, good deal of evidence that Viet-
cong tax exactions and terrorism have in-
creasingly alienated the villagers. And one 
of the problems with which the South Viet-
namese Government and we have to deal is 
the large scale exodus from the Central High-

lands to the coastal areas of refugees from 
the Vietcong. 
It is of the greatest significance that, de-
spite many years of harsh war, despite the 
political instability of the central govern-
ment, and despite division of their country 
since 1954, the people of South Vietnam fight 
on with uncommon determination. There Is 
no evidence among polititians, the bureauc-
raty, the military, the major religious groups 
the youth, or even the peasantry of a desire 
for peace at any price. They all oppose sur-
render or accommodatien on a basis which 
would lead to a Conurninist take-over, The 
will to resist the aggression from the North 
has survived through periods of great stress 
and remains strong. 
The central objective of our foreign policy 
is a peaceful community of nations, each free 
to choose its own institutions but cooperat-
ing with one another to promote their 
mutual welt are. It is the kind of world order 
envisaged in the opening sections of the 
united Nations Charter. But there have been 
and Still are important forces in the world 
which seek a different goal?which deny the 
right of free choice, which seek to expand 
their influence and empires by every means, 
including force. 
The bulwark of peace 
In defense of peace and freedom and the 
right of free choice: 
We and others insisted that the Soviets 
withdraw their forces from Iran. 
We went to the aid of Turkey and Greece. 
We joined in organizing the European re-
covery program and in forming the North 
Atlantic Alliance. 
We and our allies have defended the free-
dom of west Berlin. 
We and 15 other nations joined in repel-
linethe aggression in Korea. 
We have joined defensive alliances with 
many other nations and have helped them to 
strengthen their defensive military forces. 
We supported the 'United Nations in its 
effecrU to preserve the independence of the 
Oarigo. 
We insisted that the Soviet Union with-
drawastrategie weapons rrom Cuba. 
Had we not done the things?and 
others?the enemies of freedom would now 
control much of the world and be in a posi-
tion to destroy us or at least to sap our 
strength by economic strangulation. 
For the same basic reasons that we took 
all those other measures to deter or to repel 
aggression, we are determined to assist the 
people of South Vietnam to defeat this 
aggression. 
In his last public utterance, recorded only 
half an hour before his death, a peat and 
beloved American, Adlai Stevenson, said: 
"There has been a great deal of pressure on 
me In the United States from many sources 
to take a position?a public position?incon-
sistent with that of my Government. Ac-
tually, I don't agree with those protestants. 
My hope in Vietnam is that resistance there 
may establish the fact that changes in Asia 
are not to be precipitated by outside forces." 
believe, with the President, that "once 
the Communists know, as We know, that 
violent solution is impossible, then a peaceful 
solution is inevitable." 
The great bulwark of peace for all free-
men?and therefore of peace for the milliOns 
ruled by the adversaries of freedom?has 
been, and is today, the power of the 'United 
States and our readiness to use that power, 
in pooperation with other free nations, to 
deter or to defeat aggression, and to help 
other free nations to go forward econorni-
cany, socially, and politically. 
We have had to cope with a long series of 
dangerous crises caused by the aggressive 
appetites of others. But we are a great na-
tion and people. / am confident that we will 
meet this test, as we have met lathers. 
THE TASKS OF =PEN= 
(Statement by Secretary of Defense Robert 
S. McNamara, before the Defense Subcom-
mittee of the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee, August 4, 1965) 
The issue in Vietnam is essentially the 
same as it was in 1954 when President 
Eisenhower said: 
"I think it is no longer necessary to enter 
into a long argument or exposition to show 
the importance to the United States of 
Indochina and of the struggle going on there. 
No matter how the struggle may have started, 
it has long since become one of the testing 
places between a free form of government 
and dictatorship. Its outcome is going to 
have the greatest significance for us, and 
possibly for a long time into the future. 
"We have here a sort of co-k in the bottle, 
the bottle being the great area that includes 
Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, all of the sur-
rounding areas of Asia with its hundreds of 
millions of people. ? * *" 
The nature of the conflict 
What is at stake in Vietnam today is the 
ability of the free world to block Commu-
nist =axed aggression and prevent the 
loss of all of southeast Asia, a loss which 
in its ultimate consequences could draeti-
cally alter the strategic situation in Asia 
and the Pacific to the grave detriment of our 
own security and that of our allies. While 
15 years ago, in Korea, Communist aggres-
sion took the form of an overt armed attack, 
today in South Vietnana, it has taken the 
form of a large scale intensive guerrilla 
operation. 
The covert nature of this aggression, which 
characterized the earlier years of the struggle 
In South Vietnam, has now all but been 
stripped away. The control of the Vietcong 
effort by the regime in Hanoi, supported and 
incited by Communist China, has become 
increasingly apparent. 
The struggle there has enormous implica-
tions for the security of the United States and 
the free world, and for that matter, the 
Soviet Union as well. The North Vietnamese 
and the Chinese Communists have chosen to 
make South Vietnam the test case for their 
particular version of the so-called wars of 
national liberation. The extent to which 
violence should be used in overthrowing 
non-Communist governments has been one 
of the most bitterly contested issues between 
the Chinese and the Soviet Communists, 
Although the former Chairman, Mr. Khru-
shchev, fully endorsed wars of national lib-
eration as the preferred means of extending 
the sway of communism, he cautioned that 
"this does not necessarily mean that the 
transition to socialism will everywhere and 
in all cases be linked with armed uprising 
and civil war. * * Revolution by peaceful 
means accords with the interests of the 
working class and the masses. 
The Chinese Communists, however, insist 
that: 
"Peaceful coexistence cennot replace the 
revolutionary struggles of the people. The 
transition from capitalism to socialism in 
any country can only be brought about 
through proletarian revolution and the dic-
tatorship of the proletariat in that coun-
try. * * * The vanguard of the proletariat 
will remain unconquerable in all circuin-
stances only if it masters all forms of strug-
gle?peaceful and armed, open and secret, 
legal and illegal, parliamentary struggle and 
mass struggle, and so forth." (Letter to the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of the Soviet Union, June 14, 1963.) 
Their preference for violence was even 
more emphatically expressed in an article in 
the Peiping People's Daily of March 31, 1964: 
"It is advantageous from the point of 
view of tactics to refer to the desire for 
peaceful transition, but it would be inappro-
priate to emphasize the possibility of peace-
ful transition. ? ? ? the proletarian party 
must never substitute parliamentary strug-
gle for proletarian revolution or entertain 
the illusion that the transition to socialism 
can be achieved through the parliamentary 
road. Violent revolution is a universal law 
of proletarian revolution. To realize the 
transition to socialism, the proletariat must 
wage armed struggle, smash the old state 
machine and establish the dictatorship of 
the proletariat. ? * 5" 
"Political power," the article quotes Mao 
Tse-tung as saying, "grows out of the barrel 
of a gun." 
Throughout the world we see the fruits 
of these policies and in Vietnam, particu-
larly, we see the effects of the Chinese Com-
munists' more militant stance and their 
hatred of the free world. They make no 
secret of the fact that Vietnam is the teat 
case, and neither does the regime in Hanoi. 
General Giap, head of the North Vietname:e 
Army, recently said that "South Vietnam is 
the model of the national liberation move-
ment of our time. ? ? a if the special wax-
fare that the 'U.S. imperialists are testing in 
South Vietnam is overcome, then it can be 
defeated everywhere in the world." And, 
Pham Van Dong, Premier of North Vietnam, 
pointed out that "The experience of our 
compatriots in South Vietnam attracts the 
attention of the world, especially the peoples 
of South America." 
It is clear that a Communist success in 
South Vietnam would be taken as proof that 
the Chinese Communists' position is correct 
and they will have made a giant step forward 
in their efforts to seize control of the world 
Communist movement. 
Furthermore, such a success would greatly 
increase the prestige of Communist China 
among the nonalined nations and strength-
en the position of their followers everywhere. 
In that event we would then have to be 
prepared to cope with the same kind of 
aggression in other parts of the world wher-
ever the existing governments are weak and 
the social structures fragmented. If Com-
munist armed aggression is not stopped in 
Vietnam, as it was in Korea, the confidence 
of small nations in America's pledges of sup-
port will be weakened and many of them, 
in widely separated areas of the world, will 
feel unsafe. 
Thus, the stakes in South Vietnam are far 
greater than the loss of one small country 
to communism. Its loss would be a most 
serious setback to the cause of freedom and 
would greatly complicate the task of prevent-
ing the further spread of militant Asian com-
munism. And, if that spread is not halted, 
our strategic position in the world will be 
weakened and our national security directly 
endangered. 
Conditions leading to the present situation 
in South Vietnam 
Essential to a proper understanding of the 
present situation in South Vietnam is a 
recognition of the fact that the so-called 
Insurgency there is planned, directed, con-
trolled and supported from Hanoi. 
True, there is a small dissident minority in 
South Vietnam, but the government could 
cope with it if it were not directed and sup-
plied from the outside. As early as 1980, at 
the Third Congress of the North Vietnamese 
Communist Party, both Ho Chi Minh and 
General Map spoke of the need to "step up" 
the "revolution in the South." In March 
1963 the party organ Hoc Tap stated that the 
authorities in South Vietnam "are well aware 
that North Vietnam is the firm hese for the 
southern revolution and the point on which 
it leans, and that our party is the steady and 
experienced vanguard unit of the working 
class and people and is the brain and factor 
that decides all victories of the revolution." 
Through most of the past decade the North 
Vietnamese Government denied and went to 
great efforts to conceal the scale of its per-

sonnel and materiel support, in addition to 
direction and encouragement, to the Viet-
cong. 
It had strong reasons to do so. The North 
Vietnamese regime had no wish to force upon 
the attention of the world its massive and 
persistent violations of its Geneva pledges 
of 1954 and 1962 regarding noninterference 
in South Vietnam and Laos. 
However, in building up the Vietcong forces 
for a decisive challenge, the authorities in 
North Vietnam have increasingly dropped 
the disguises that gave their earlier support 
a clandestine character. 
Through 1963, the bulk of the arms in-
filtrated from the North were old French and 
American models acquired prior to 1954 in 
Indochina and Korea. 
Now, the flow of weapons from North Viet-
nam consists almost entirely of the latest 
arms acquired from Communist China; and 
the flow is large enough to have entirely re-
equipped the main force units, despite the 
capture this year by government forces of 
thousands of these weapons and millions of 
rounds of the new ammunition. 
Likewise, through 1963, nearly all the per-
sonnel infiltrating through Laos, trained and 
equipped in the North and ordered South, 
were former Southerners. 
But in the last 18 months, the great ma-
jority of the infiltrators?more than 10,000 
Of them?have been ethnic northerners, 
mostly draftees ordered into the People's 
Army of Vietnam for duty in the South. 
And it now appears that, starting their Jour-
ney through Laos last December, from one to 
three regiments of a North Vietnamese regu-
lar division, the 325th Division of the North 
Vietnamese Army, have deployed into the 
Central Highlands of South Vietnam for 
combat alongside the Vietcong. 
Thus, despite all its reasons for secrecy. 
Hanoi's desire for decisive results this sum-
mer has forced it to reveal its hand even 
more openly. 
The United States during the last 4 years 
has steadily increased its help to the people 
of South Vietnam in an effort to counter 
this ever-increasing scale of Communist 
aggression. These efforts achieved some 
-measure of success during 1962. The South 
Vietnamese forces in that year made good 
progress in suppressing the Vietcong insur-
rection. 
Although combat deaths suffered by these 
forces in 1962 rose by 11 percent over the 
1961 level (from about 4?000 to 4,450), 3/iet-
cong combat deaths increased by 72 percent 
(from about 12,000 to 21,000). Weapons lost 
by the South Vietnamese fell from 5,900 in 
1961 to 5,200 in 1962, while the number lost 
by the Vietcong rose from 2,750 to 4050. The 
Government's new strategic hamlet program 
was just getting underway and was showing 
promise. The economy was growing and the 
Government seemed firmly in control. 
Therefore, in early 1963, I was able to say: 
"* * * victory over the Vietcong will most 
likely take many years. But now, as a result 
of the operations of the last year, there is a 
new feeling of confidence, not only on the 
part of the Government of South Vietnam 
but also among the populace, that victory 
is possible." 
But at the same time I also cautioned: 
"We are not unmindful of the fact that 
the pressures on South Vietnam may well 
continue through infiltration via the Laos 
corridor. Nor are we unmindful of the pos-
sibility that the Communists, sensing defeat 
in their covert efforts, might resort to overt 
aggression from North Vietnam. Obviously, 
this latter contingency could , require a 
greater direct participation by the United 
States. The survival of an independent 
government lb South Vietnam is so impor-
tant to the security of all southeast Asia and 
to the free world that we must be prepared 
to take all necessary measures within our 
capability to prevent a Communist victory." 
Unfortunately, the caution voiced in early 
1963 proved to be well founded. Late in 
1963, the Communists stepped up their 
efforts, and the military situation began to 
deteriorate. The Diem government came 
under increasing internal pressure, and in 
November it was overthrown. As I reported 
in February 1964: 
"The Vietcong was quick to take advantage 
of the growing opposition to the Diem Gov-
ermnent and the period of uncertainty fol-
lowing its overthrow. Vietcong activities 
were already increasing in September and 
continued to increase at an accelerated rate 
in October and November, particularly in the 
delta area. And I must report that they 
have made considerable progress since the 
coup." 
Following the coup, the lack of stability 
in the central government and the rapid 
turnover of key personnel, particularly senior 
military commanders, began to be reflected 
in combat operations and throughout the 
entire fabric of the political and economic 
structure. And, in 1964, the Communists 
greatly increased the scope and tempo of 
their subversive efforts. Larger scale attacks 
became more frequent and the flow of men 
and supplies from the North expanded. The 
incidence of terrorism and sabotage rose 
rapidly and the pressure on the civilian 
population was intensified. 
The deteriorating military situation was 
clearly reflected in the statistics. South 
Vietnamese combat deaths rose from 5,650 in 
1963 to 7,450 in 1964 and the number of 
weapons lost from 8,250 to 14,100. In con-
trast, Vietcong combat deaths dropped from 
20,600 to 16,800 and, considering the 
stepped-up ternpo of activity, they experi-
enced only a very modest rise in the rate of 
weapons lost (from 5,400 to .5,900). 
At various times in recent months, I have 
called attention to the continued buildup 
of Communist forces in South Vietnam. I 
pointed out that although these forces had 
not been committed to combat in any sig-
nificant degree, they probably -would be after 
the start of the monsoon season. It is 110W 
clear that these forces are being committed 
in increasing numbers and that the Com-
munists have decided to make an all-out 
attempt to bring down the Government of 
South Vietnam, 
The entire economic and social structure 
is under attack. Bridges, railroads, and high-
ways are being destroyed and interdicted. 
Agricultural products are being barred from 
the cities. Electric powerplants and com-
munication lines are being sabotaged. 
Whole villages are being burned and their 
population driven away, increasing the 
refugee burden on the South Vietnamese 
Government. 
In addition to the continued infiltration of 
increasing numbers of individuals and the 
acceleration of the flow of modern equip-
ment and supplies organized units of the 
North Vietnamese Army have been identified 
in South Vietnam. We now estimate the 
hard care Vietcong strength at some '70,000 
men, including a recently reported increase 
in the number of combat battalions. In ad-
dition, they have some 90,000 to 100,000 ir-
regulars and some 30,000 in their political 
-cadres; i.e., tax collectors, propagandists, 
etc. We have also identified at least three 
battalions of the regular North Vietnamese 
Army, and there are probably considerably 
more. 
At the same time the Government of 
South Vietnam has found it increasingly dif-
ficult to make a commensurate increase in 
the size of its own forces, which now stand at 
about 545,000 men, including the regional 
and local defense forces but excluding the 
national pence. 
Combat deaths on both sides have been 
mounting?for the South Vietnamese from 
an average of 143 men a week in 1964, to 
about 270 a week for the 4-week period end-
, 
ing July 24 this year. Vietcong losses have 
gone from 322 a week last year to about 680 
a week for the four-week period ending 
July 24. 
_Most important, the ratio of South Viet-
namese to Vietcong strength has seriously 
declined in the last 6 or 7 months from about 
5 to 1 to about 3 or 31/2 to 1; the ratio of 
combat battalions is substantially less. This 
is far too low a ratio for a guerrilla war even 
though the greater mobility and firepower 
provided to the South Vietnamese forces by 
the United States help to offset that dis-
advantage. 
The South Vietnamese forces have to de-
fend 'hundreds of cities, towns, and hamlets 
while the Vietcong are free to choose the 
time and place of their attack. As a result, 
the South Vietnamese are stretched thin in 
defensive positions, leaving only a small cen-
tral reserve for offensive action against the 
Vietcong, while the latter are left free to con-
centrate their forces and throw them against 
selected targets. It is not surprising, there-
fore, that the Vietcong retains most of the 
initiative. 
Even so, we may not as yet have seen the 
full weight of the Communist attack. Pres-
ently, the situation is particularly acute in 
the northern part of the country where the 
Communists have mobilized large military 
forces which pose a threat to the entire re-
gion and its major cities and towns. Our 
air attack may have helped to keep these 
forces off balance but the threat remains 
and it is very real. 
Clearly, the time has come when the people 
of South Vietnam need more help from us 
and other nations if they are to retain their 
freedom and independence. 
We have already responded to that need 
with some 75,000 U.S. military personnel, 
including some combat units. This number 
will be raised to 12.5,000 almost immediately 
with the deployment of the Air Mobile Divi-
sion and certain other forces. But, more 
help will be needed in the months ahead and 
additional U.S. combat forces will be required 
to back up the hard-pressed Army of South 
Vietnam. Two other nations have provided 
combat forces?Australia and New Zealand. 
We hope that by the end of this year others 
will join them. In this regard, the Koreans 
have just recently approved a combat cUvi-
sion for deployment to Vietnam., which is 
scheduled to arrive this fall. 
Role of U.S. combat forces in South Vietnam 
As I noted earlier, the central reserve of 
the South Vietnamese Army has been seri-
ously depleted in recent months. The prin-
cipal role of U.S. ground combat forces will 
be to supplement this reserve in support of 
the frontline forces of the South Vietnamese 
Army. The indigenous paramilitary forces 
will deal with the pacification of areas 
cleared of organized Vietcong and North 
Vietnamese units, a role more appropriate for 
them than for our forces. 
The Government of South Vietnam's 
strategy, with which we concur, is to achieve 
the initiative, to expand gradually its area of 
control by breaking up major concentrations 
of enemy forces, using to the maximum our 
preponderance of airpower, both land and 
sea based. The number of fixed-wing attack 
sorties by U.S. aircraft in South Vietnam will 
Increase manifold by the end of the year. 
Armed helicopter sorties will also increase 
dramatically over the same period, and ex-
tension use will be made of heavy artillery, 
both land based and sea based. At the same 
time our air and naval forces will continue 
to interdict the Vietcong supplies line from 
North Vietnam, both land and sea. 
Although our tactics have changed, our 
objective remains the same. 
We have no desire to widen the war. We 
have no desire to overthrow the North Viet-
namese regime, seize its territory or achieve 
the unification of North and South Vietnam 
by force of arms. We have no need for per-

manent military bases in South Vietnam or 
for special privileges of any kind. 
What we are seeking through the planned 
military buildup is to block the Vietcong 
offensive, to give the people of South Viet-
nam and their armed forces Some relief from 
the unrelenting Conishuniet pressures?to 
give them time to strengthen their govern-
ment, to reestablish law and order, and to 
revive their economic life Which has been 
seriously disrupted by Vietcong harassment 
and attack in recent months. We have no 
Illusions that success will be achieved quick-
ly, but we are confident that it will be 
achieved much more surely by the plan I 
have outlined. 
Increases in U military forces 
Fortunately, we have greatly increased the 
strength and readiness of our Military Estab-
lishment since 1961, particularly in the kinds 
o forces which we no require in southeast 
Asia. The Active Arrny has been expanded 
from 11 to 16 combat ready divisions. 
Twenty thousand men have been added to 
the Marine Corps to allow them to fill out 
their combat structure and at the same time 
facilitate the Mobilization of the Marine 
Coeps Reserve. The tactical fighter sqlied-
roris of the Air Force have been increased by 
51 percent. Our airlift capability has more 
than doubled. Special forces trained to deal 
With insurgency threats hats been multiplied 
elevenfold. General ship construction and 
conversion has been doubled. 
During this same period, procurement for 
the expanded force has been increased great-
ly: Air Force tactical aircraft?from $360 mil-
lion in 1961 to about $1.1 billion in the orig-
inal fiscal year 1068 budget; Navy aircraft?
from $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion; Army helicop-
ters?from 288 aircraft to over 1,000. Pro-
curement a ordnance, vehicles and related 
equipment was increased about 150 percent 
in the fiscal years 1962-64 period, compared 
with the preceding 2 years. The teninage of 
modern nonnuclear air-to-ground ordnance 
in stock tripled between natal year 1961 and 
flees' year 1965. In brief, the Military Estab-
lishment of the United States, today, is in 
far better shape than it ever has been in 
peacetime to face whatever tasks may lie 
ahead. 
Nevertheless, some further increases in 
forces, military personnel, produetion, and 
construction will be required if V:te are to de-
ploy addition's' forces to Southeast Asia and 
provide for combat consUiription while, at 
the same time, maintaining our capabilities 
to deal with Crises elsewhere in the werld. 
To offset the deployments now planfied to 
southeast Asia, and provide some additional 
forces for possible new deployments, we pro-
pose to increase the preeently authorized 
farce leeels. These increases will be of three 
types: (1) Additional Units for the active 
forces, over and above these reflected in the 
January budget; (2) military perst)hhel aug-
mentations for presently authoriaed units in 
the Active Forces to man new bases, to handle 
the larger logistics Workload, etc.; and (3) 
additional personnel and extra training for 
selected Reserve compote= units to increase 
their readiness for quick deployment We 
believe we can achieve this buildup without 
calling up the Reserves or-ordering the invol-
untary extension of tours, except as already 
authorized by law for the Department of the 
Navy. Even here the extension of officer 
tours win be on a selective basis and exten-
sions for enlisted men will be limited, in gen-
eral, to not more than 4 months. 
The program I have outlined here today 
and the $1.7 billion amendment to the fiscal 
year 1966 Defense appropriation bill now be-
fore the committee will, in the collective 
judgment of my principal military and ci-
vilian advisers and myself, provide the men, 
materiel, and facilities required to fulfill the 
President's pledge to meet the rnounting ag-
gression in South Vietnam, While at the same 
time maintaining the forces required to meet 
commitments elsewhere in the world. 
THE CHALLENGE OE HUMAN NEED 
(Address by the President to the Association 
of American Editorial Cartoonists, the 
White House, May 13, 1085) 
The th,ird face of the war 
The war in Vietnam has many faces. 
There is the face a armet. conflict?of ter-
ror and gunfire?of bomb-heavy planes and 
campaign-weary soldiers. ? ? * 
The second face of war in Vietnam is the 
quest for a political solution?the face of 
diplomacy and politics?of the ambitions and 
the interests of other nations. ? * * 
The third face of war in Vietnam is, at 
once, the most tragic and most hopeful. It 
is the face of human need. It is the un-
tended sick, the hungry family, and the il-
literate child. It is men and women, many 
without shelter, with rags for clothing, strug-
gling for survival in a very rich and a very 
fertile land. 
It is the most important battle of all in 
Which we are engaged. 
For a nation cannot be built by armed 
power or by political agreement. It will rest 
on the expectation by individual men and 
women that their future will be better than 
their past. 
It is not enough to just fight against some-
thing. People must fight for something, and 
? the people of South Vietnam must know that 
after the long, brutal journey through the 
dark tunnel of conflict there breaks the light 
of a happier day. And only if this is so can 
they be expected to sustain the enduring will 
for continued strife. Only in this way can 
long-run stability and peace come to their 
land. 
And there is another, more profound rea-
son. In Vietnam communism seeks to really 
Impose its will by force of arms. But we 
would be deeply mistaken to think that this 
was the only weapon. Here, as other places 
In the world, they speak to restless people?
people rising to shatter the old ways which 
have imprisoned hope?people fiercely and 
Justly reaching for the material fruits from 
the tree of modern knowledge. 
It is this desire, and not simply lust for 
conquest, which moves many of the individ-
ual fighting men that we must now, sadly, 
call the enemy. 
It is, therefore, our task to show that free-
dom from the control of other nations offers 
the surest road to progress, that history and 
experience testify to this truth. But it is not 
enough to call upon reason or point to ex-
amples. We must show it through action 
and we must show it through accomplish-
ment, and even were there no war?either 
hot or cold?we would always be active in 
humanity's search for progress. 
This task is commanded to us by the 
moral values of our civilization, and it rests 
on the inescapable nature a the world that 
we have now entered. For in that Weed, as 
long as we can foresee, every threat to man's 
welfare will be a threat to the welfare of our 
own people. Those who live in the emerging 
community of nations Will ignore the perils 
of their neighbors at the risk of their own 
prospects. 
Cooperative development in southeast Asia 
This is true not only for Vietnam but for 
every part of the developing world. This is 
why, on your behalf, I recently proposed a 
massive, cooperative development effort for 
all of southeast Asia. I named the respected 
leader, Eugene Black, as my personal repre-
sentative to inaugurate our participation in 
theee programs. 
Since that time rapid progress has been 
made, I am glad to report. Mr. Black has 
met with the top officials of the United Na-
tions on several occasions. He has talked to 
other interested parties. He has found in-
creasing enthusiasm. The United Nations is 
already setting up new mechanisms to help 
carry forward the work of development. 
In addition, the United States is now pre-
pared to participate irt, and to support, an 
Asian Development Bank, to carry out and 
help finance the economic progress in that 
area of the world and the development that 
we desire to see in that area of the world. 
So this morning I call on every other in-
dustrialized nation, including the Soviet 
Union, to help create a better life for all of 
the people of southeast Asia. 
Surely, surely', the works of peace can 
bring men together in a common effort to 
abandon forever the works of war. 
But, as South Vietnam. is the central place 
of conflict, it is also a principal focus for 
our work, to increase the well-being of people. 
It is that effort in South Vietnam, of which 
I think we are too little informed, which I 
want to relate to you this morning. 
Strengthening Vietnam's economy 
We began in 1954, when Vietnam became 
Independent, before the war between the 
north and the south. Since that time we 
have spent more than $2 billion in economic 
help for the 16 million people of South Viet-
nam. And despite the ravages of war, we 
have made steady, continuing gains. We 
have concentrated on food and health and 
education and housing and industry. 
Like most developing countries, South 
Vietnam's economy rests on agriculture. 
Unlike many, it has large uncrowded areas 
of very rich and very fertile land. Because 
of this, it is one of the great rice bowls of 
the entre world. With our help, since 1954, 
South Vietnam has already doubled its rice 
production, providing food for the people as 
well as providing a vital export for that 
nation. 
We have put our American farm know-
how to work on other crops. This year, for 
Instance, several hundred million cuttings 
of a new variety of sweet potato, that prom-
ises a sixfold increase in yield will be dis-
tributed to these Vietnamese farmers. Corn 
output should rise from 25,000 tons in 1982 
to 100,000 tons by 1968. Pig production has 
more than doubled since 1955. Many ant-
ma' diseases have been eliminated entirely. 
Disease and epidemic brood over every 
Vietnamese village. In a country of more 
than 16 million people with a life expectancy 
of only 35 years, there are only 200 civilian 
doctors. If the Vietnamese had doctors in 
the same ratio as the 'United States has doc-
tors, they would have not the 200 that they 
do have but they would have more than 
5,000 doctors. 
We have helped vaccinate, already, over 7 
million people against cholera, and millions 
more against other diseases. Hundreds of 
thousands of Vietnamese can now receive 
treatment in the more than: 12,000 hamlet 
health stations that America has built and 
has stocked. New clinics and surgical suites 
are scattered throughout the entire coun-
try; and the medical school that we are now 
helping to build will graduate as many doc-
tors in a single year as now serve the entire 
civilian population of South Vietnam. 
Education is the keystone of future devel-
opment in Vietnam. It takes trained people 
to man the factories, to conduct the admin-
istration, and to form the human founda-
tion for an advancing nation. More than 
a quarter million young Vietnamese can now 
learn in more than 4,000 classrooms that 
America has helped to build in the last 2 
years; and 2,000 more schools are going to 
be built by us in the next 12 months. The 
number of students in vocational schools 
has gone up four ti.mes. Enrollment was 
300,000 in 1955, when we first entered there 
and started helping with our program. To-
day it is more than 1,500,000. The 8 million 
textbooks that we have supplied to Viet-
namese children will rise to more than 15 
million by 1967. 
AgricnIture is the foundation. Health, 
education, and housing are the urgent hu-
man needs. But industrial development is 
the great pathway to their future. 
When Vietnam was divided, most of the 
industry was in the North. The South was

barren of manufacturing and the founda-
tions for industry. Today more than 700 
new or rehabilitated factories?textile mills 
and cement plants, electronics and plastics?
are changing the entire face of that nation. 
New roads and coxrununications, railroad 
equipment, and electric generators are a 
spreading base on which this new industry 
can, and is, growing. 
Progress in the midst of war 
All this progress goes on, and it is going 
to continue to go on, under circumstances of 
staggering adversity. 
Communist terrorists have made aid pro-
grams that we administer a very special tar-
get of their attack. They fear them, be-
cause agricultural stations are being de-
stroyed and medical centers are being 
burned. More than 100 Vietnamese malaria 
fighters are dead. Our own AID officials 
have been wounded and kidnapped. These 
are not Just the accidents of war. They are 
a part of a deliberate campaign, in the words 
of the Communists, "to cut the fingers off 
the hands of the Government." 
We intend to continue, and we intend to 
Increase our help to Vietnam. 
Nor can anyone doubt the determination 
of the South Vietnamese themselves. They 
have lost more than 12,000 of their men 
since I became your President a little over a 
year ago. 
But progress does not come from invest-
ment alone, or plans on a desk, or even the 
directives and the orders that we approve 
here in Washington. It takes men. Men 
must take the_ seed to the farmer. Men 
must teach the use of fertilizer. Men must 
help in harvest. Men must build the 
schools, and men must instruct the students. 
Men must carry medicine into the Jungle, 
and treat the sick, and shelter the homeless. 
And men?brave, tireless, filled with love 
for their fellows?are doing this today. 
They are doing it through the long, hot, 
danger-filled Vietnamese days and the sultry 
nights. 
The fullest glory must go, also, to those 
South Vietnamese that are laboring and 
dying for their own people and their own 
nation. In hospitals and schools, along the 
rice fields and the roads, they continue to 
labor, never knowing when death or terror 
may strike. 
How incredible it is that there are a few 
who still say that the South Vietnamese do 
not want to continue the struggle. They 
are sacrificing and they are dying by the 
thousands. Their patient valor in the heavy 
presence of personal physical danger should 
be a helpful lesson to those of us who, here 
in America, only have to read about it, or 
hear about it on the television or radio. 
We have our own heroes who labor at the 
works of peace in the midst of war. They 
toil unarmed and out of uniform. They 
know the humanity of their concern does not 
exempt them from the horrors of conflict, yet 
they go on from day to day. They bring 
food to the hungry over there. They supply 
the sick with necessary medicine. They help 
the farmer with his crops, families to find 
clean water, villages to receive the healing 
miracles of electricity. These are Americans 
who have joined our AID program, and we 
welcome others to their ranks. 
A call for aid 
For, most Americans this an easy war. Men 
fight and men suffer and men die, as they 
always do in war. But the lives of most of 
us, at least those of us in this room and those 
listening to me this morning, are untroubled. 
Prosperity rises, abundance increases, the 
Nation flourishes. 
I will report to the Cabinet when I leave 
this room that we are in the 51st month of 
continued prosperity, the longest peacetime 
prosperity for America since our country was 
founded. Yet our entire future is at stake. 
No. 155 22 
-. - 
What a difference it would make if we 
could only call upon a small fraction of our 
unmatched private resources?businesses and 
unions, agricultural groups and builders?if 
we could call them to the task of peaceful 
progress in Vietnam. With such a spirit of 
-patriotic sacrifice we might well strike an 
irresistible blow for freedom there and for 
freedom throughout the world. 
I therefore hope that every person within 
the sound of my voice in this country this 
morning will look for ways?and those citi-
zens of other nations who believe in human-
ity as we do, I hope that they will find ways 
to help progress in South Vietnam. 
This, then, is the third face of our struggle 
In Vietnam. It was there?the illiterate, the 
hungry, the sick?before this war began. It 
will be there when peace comes to us?and 
so will we?not with soldiers and planes, not 
with bombs and bullets, but with all the 
wondrous weapons of peace in the 20th 
century. 
And then, perhaps, together, all of the 
people of the world can share that gracious 
task with all the people of Vietnam, North 
and South alike. 
HOPE FOR PEACE IN YEMEN 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, at a 
time when a number of world issues are 
in crisis or in deadlock, it is gratifying 
to note an act of statesmanship and con-
ciliation. I refer to President Nasser's 
decision to go to Saudi Arabia on August 
22 to discuss the situation in Yemen with 
King Faisal. In preparation for his dis-
cussions with King Faisal, President Nas-
ser has been meeting in Alexandria with 
Yemeni leaders in an "effort to devise 
proposals for ending the festering 
Yemeni war. 
In the meantime, tensions along the 
Saudi-Yemeni border, which until quite 
recently were rising, are now visibly abat-
ing. It is to be hoped that reduced hos-
tilities will create a favorable atmosphere 
for peace negotiations. 
President Nasser is often criticized in 
the United States for provocative actions 
and policies. It is fair and proper that 
we commend the President of the United 
Arab Republic when he takes conciliatory 
action for peace, as he is now doing with 
respect to Yemen. 
Mr. President, I hope that the negotia-
tions will turn out successfully, as it was 
a very dangerous situation in that area, 
and has been for some 3 years. 
FURTHER AMENDMENT OF FOR-
EIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1961?
CONFERENCE REPORT 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (HR. 7750) to amend further 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended, and for other purposes. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, the 
conferees on the Foreign Assistance Act 
met 14 times before final agreement was 
reached on the text now before the Sen-
ate. As usual, the subject of foreign 
aid has been. actively before the Senate 
in one form or another since March, a 
period of 6-months, and we have not yet 
acted on the appropriations bill. 
I wish I could report to my colleagues 
that they would not need to begin the 
process all over again 3 or 4 months 
hence. But this is not the case because 
20625 
the Senate conferees reluctantly?cer-
tainly, from my point of view, most 
reluctantly?were forced to accept those 
provisions of the House bill which au-
thorized the program for only 1 more 
year. 
Depressing as I personally find it to 
ask for approval of this conference re-
port, nevertheless, I believe that it is 
possible we may have laid the ground-
work for more thorough reforms next 
year. For the record, I wish to state 
that the Senate conferees, in agreeing 
with the House conferees to omit from 
this year's act Senate language authoriz-
ing a 2-year aid program and calling for 
a planning committee to study the basic 
principles underlying U.S. aid programs, 
placed reliance on the following factors. 
With respect to the 2-year authoriza-
tion, the Senate conferees receded on the 
basis of: 
First. The willingness of the House 
members of the committee of the confer-
ence to urge their House colleagues next 
year to examine with the greatest care 
such proposals as may be submitted au-
thorizing foreign aid programs for 2 or 
more years"; and 
Second. The statement of the Secre-
tary of State when he met with the For-
eign Relations Committee on August 12, 
1965, that next year "the administration 
expects to request that the multiyear 
principle adoped by the Congress in 1961 
and 1962 for development lending be ex-
tended to include all other authorizations 
contained in the foreign aid bill to be 
proposed early in the next session of 
Congress." 
I am hopeful that next year with the 
support of the administration and with 
the agreement of the House conferees, to 
examine a longer term authorization 
"with the greatest of care" that some 
headway may be made so we may get 
away from the dreary cycle of 1-year 
aid programs. 
Throughout the conference, the House 
conferees reiterated time and time again 
that one of the reasons why they were 
unwilling to accept the amendment Was 
that it was not requested by the admin-
istration. Whether that will be deter-
minative, I do not know, but at least one 
step forward has been taken. Generally 
speaking, the administration's recom-
mendations in these matters are given 
serious consideration by both bodies. 
On the subject of the Senate's proposal 
to create a planning committee to ex-
amine the basic principles of foreign aid, 
the Senate receded on the basis of the 
following factors: 
First. The statement of the conferees 
of both Houses urging the President "to 
inaugurate a review of the aid program 
as presently constituted, seeking to direct 
It more effectively toward the solution 
of the problems of the developing coun-
tries," and - 
Second. The statement of the Secre-
tary of State on the occasion referred to 
above that, despite its opposition to the 
creation of the foreign aid planning com-
mittee and certain other related provi-
sions, nevertheless, the administration 
recognizes "the concern of the Senate 
about the future content and direction 
of the foreign aid program."

In this connection I ma say that 
have already requested our 1i1ef a staff 
of the committee to unclertiek- e 
nary preparations for a revfmv of oiir aid 
program by the centnittee. We have 
done this in the past"fri other fields: I

The Secretary of State (Wed:

Cea the subject of whether the national 
interest might better be Served by in-
creasing the proportion of development 
aid, to be administered Ft the World 
Bank and related agenciek'rather than 
salary through *U.S. agencia, the Senate 
conferees were assured by The statement 
of the Secretary of State that the admin-

Committees to "remove t& probibitien

of certain percentages, in- the Past, 10

Ilitope very diuch that the Appropria-

Point and will, not this yier nullify the

heart of the proliferation of country Pro-
grams without tying theee programs to 
principles by which we reight have Pro-
moted a ,tightened definition of the na-
tional interest.

I also regret that we were not -able to 
put the aid Program on -a 2-year bags, 
thus enabling the Committee on Foreign 
Relations and the Senate to devote more 
time and attention to the many areas of 
foreign policy which need review and 
more modern mandate& 
'There were, of course, a number of 
other points in issue between the two 
Houses. This disposition of these issues 
is set forth in the conference report. 
A number of loopholes were closed, 
Including a blanket authorization pro-
vision which existed in the House bill. 
The overall amount authorized in the

Frankly, two or three times in the past 
on this score, I have felt impelled to dis-
agree strongly with President Johnson 
in connection with his assertion as to 
the role of the Executive under provi-
sions of various bills passed by the 
Congress. 
Today, however, I must with equal 
vigor rise to support President Johnson's 
veto of H.R. 8439, which he rejected on 
the grounds, as he said, that the limita-
tions placed by section 611 of the bill 
Impinged on his constitutional powers. 
I must agree with the President that 
the Constitution grants the Chief Ex-
ecutive sole authority over the operation 
of our Defense Establishment. 
As such, I concur with him that the 
Congress went too far when it reserved 
to itself certain powers over the retention 
or closing of certain military bases. 
In this regard, therefore, if occasion 
arises, I will be constrained to uphold 
the President's veto.

EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. WILLIAM T. MURPHY 
-OS' ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23., 1965 
Mr. MURPHY of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I share Thomas Jefferson's 
sentiment that error is best defeated 
where reason is left free to combat it. I 
strongly defend, therefore, the right of 
all Americans to dissent, to criticize, and 
to protest the policies of their Govern-
ment. 
I think it important, however, that 
critics of our Nation's present course in 
Vietnam weigh heavily a potential side-
effect of their protests, the danger of 
giving unintended moral support to our 
enemy. A recent article on this subject 
In the Aurora Beacon-News impressed 
me deeply, and I offer it today for entry 
In the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
The article follows: 
[From the Aurora Beacon-News, Aug. 11, 
19651 
RADICALS DAMAGE U.S. INTENT: HOME TACTICS 
PROLONG WAR 
Recent visitors to North Vietnam have been 
dumbfounded by the surrealistic illogic of 
the oriental Communist mind. 
The visitors, some of them pro-Communist 
and others sympathetic to the Hanoi regime, 
said they found no thoughts of peace among 
North Vietnamese. 
? The collective opinion was that the United 
States was on the verge of collapse and that 
President Johnson was soon to be impeached. 
It was based on the belief that criticism of 
official policy in colleges and assorted domes-
tic talk of appeasement would soon lead to a 
revolution. 
? Completely ignored was the fact that a 
majority of the people in the United States 
and most of the elected representatives in 
Congress support the President overwhelm-
ingly. 
In his many public statements the Presi-
dent correctly assesses the public will by giv-
ing notice that the United States will win 
the war in Vietnam. At the same time he 
leaves the door to peace open, but not at the 
price of national disgrace. 
The domestic dialog by so-called intel-
lectuals calling for appeasement is certainly a 
minority voice. As small as It is, however, 
it plays directly into the North Vietnam 
Communists' hands. 
Particularly disturbing is evidence that 
the talk of appeasement has found a hold in 
the lower echelon of official circles. There is 
a growing discussion in Washington and the 
United Nations that the United States is 
willing to negotiate on the terms set forth 
by the Vietcong. 
These terms are American withdrawal, 
temporary neutralization of South Viet-
nam, communization and reunification of 
the Nation. They are wholly unacceptable 
and undermine the President's often-stated 
determination to use all of our resources to 
win the war, while keeping the door open 
to honorable negotiations. Giving Vietnam 
to the Communists is not the basis for nego-
tiations. 
Since the United States asked the United 
Nations to direct its attention to peace in 
southeast Asia, there have been further re-
ports. 
These include, theoretically, U.S. willing-
ness to hold elections in South Vietnam and 
face-saving devices to allow the Viet Cong 
to participate in discussions as a party. 
The United Nations' attention is, of course, 
desirable. It may serve to convince the un-
convinced that aggression in Vietnam is to-
tally the responsibility of the Communists. 
It also may remind the world that the Viet 
Gong do no really want peace. 
However, there is no guarantee of free 
and impartial elections until the South Viet-
namese and the United States win a military 
victory and can offer proper supervision. The 
U.N. burdened by peace-keeping costs al-
ready, could not guarantee impartial elec-
tions at this time. 
Giving in to the atheistic Communists on 
these terms would in effect be making them 
a gift of southeast Asia. It would be a be-
trayal of the servicemen offering their lives, 
and the American majority. 
Discussions for peace must go on by all 
means. However, they must be from strength 
and at this time, unfortunately, that 
strength can come only from united purpose 
at home and the military capabilities to force 
negotiations. 
Medical Care in Veterans' Administration 
Hospitals 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. OLIN E. TEAGUE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. TEAGUE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
in an effort to get a better insight into the 
quality of hospital care provided by the 
Veterans' Administration hospital sys-
tem, I recently had sent 2,682 letters to 
veterans who had recently been patients 
in a Veterans' Administration hospital. 
This was a 30-percent sample of all vet-
erans discharged from Veterans' Admin-
istration general hospitals during the 
period June 14 to 18, after care for a 
medical or surgical condition. 
The return of the questionnaire was 
very good?a little over 53 percent, or 
1,434. Generally, the response indicates 
that veterans were pleased with the 
treatment they received in the hospital. 
In response to the question, "What is 
your overall evaluation of the care you 
received while a patient?" 83 percent 
replied, "Excellent"; 12.8 percent replied, 
"Fair"; and 2 percent replied, "Poor." 
An additional 2.2 percent made no reply 
to this question. 
Mr. Speaker, under unanimous con-
sent, I include at this point in my re-
marks the text of the letter and ques-
tionnaire, as well as a table summarizing 
the results. A complete summary of the 
questionnaire is available at the commit-
tee office in the form of Committee Print 
No. 109: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
OOMMIvrEA ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS, 
Washington, D.C., June 25, 1965. 
DEAR Snt: As a recent patient in a Vet-
erans' Administration hospital you now have 
some definite opinions about the hospital 
In which you were treated and the care 
rendered to you. Will you share them with 
me? 
The Conunittee on Veterans' Affairs has 
legislative oversight responsibilities over the 
Veterans' Administration and thus has a 
keen interest in the medical and hospital 
program operated through the Department 
of Medicine and Surgery for the care of our 
sick and disabled veterans. May I ask you 
to help make this hospital system better for 
others and for you if you should ever need 
to be hospitalized in a Veterans' Administra-
tion hospital again? 
By completing the short-card question-
naire and adding your comments, you will be 
helping the Veterans' Administration and the 
Committee on Veterans' Affairs to insure bet-
ter patient care. 
Please note that you are not required to 
sign your name. The postcard requires no 
postage. Simply drop it in the most con-
venient mailbox. 
Your cooperation will be very much ap-
preciated.

The Juvenile Protective AasOCiation is a 
specialized private servite agency operating in 
the city of Chicago which accepts only cases 
in which the "presenting 'problem is the ne-
glect or mistreatment Of children.'" 
When a referral is made to it, the JPA as-
signs a caseworker to the family with obtains 
background information from schools and 
other sources. The initial objective of the 
caseworker is to establish good rapport with 
the family. To give meaning to the counsel-

ices as "finding them better apartments.

the Department of Public Aid, this agency 
makes a referral to a family cOurt it it be-
comes necessary to seek removal of the chil-
dren from the home. 
If court proceedings are instituted by the 
social agency, by the reason of the Family 
Court Act of Illinois protecting the "ne-
glected child," the State of Illinois actually 
prosecutes the petition. The parent has 
the right to select an attorney to represent 
him fit the court hearing. The family court

removed from the home and plated in the 
care of another person, a licensed foster

Obtaining clear-cat evidence of abuse pre-

against the parent, because the abusive act 
usually occurs in the home where faMlly

the abusive parent admit his action, not only 
because society does not condone such be-

The Real Alabama?Part XLIX 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JACK EDWARDS 
OF Anaemia" 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when water pollution 
Is a major concern for our country it 
will come as welcome news that important 
segments of private industry are taking 
action to help fight the problem. 
In July of this year the Gulf States 
Paper Corp. of Alabama, completed con-
struction of a new waste system that at-
tacks water pollution in three ways. The 
new facilities are located at the com-
pany's plant at Demopolis and will serve 
to help assure clean water in the im-
portant Tombigbee River which we hope 
will someday be a link in a new water 
transportation route between the port 
City of Mobile and the Tennessee River. 
An article telling more about the new 
antipollution system follows: 
GIMP SPAT= PAPER Rasmus Craw WATER 
WITH New SYSTEM 
Gulf States Paper Corp., In July, took 
the wraps off a new mill waste system that 
aims a three-pronged attack at stream pol-
lution. 
The Unique installation divides mill effluent 
into three different channels to be treated 
according to type and strength before flow-
ing into the Tombigbee River. 
Representatives of State and local govern-
ment, industry, and wildlife groups were 
treated to a 100k at this recently completed 
system in Demopolis, which company officials 
describe as a new concept in stream protec-
tion. - 
The mill is surrounded by elaborate pond-
ing and clarifying facilities each dedicated 
to the treatment of a special type of waste 
water from the various stages of manufac-
ture. Into one lagoon goes water that con-
tains no harmful materials but needs to be 
cooled before returning to the river. A huge 
clarifier, 280 feet in diameter, removes solids 
such as wood fibers that would otherwise 
flow into the Tombigbee. 
The third phase is a 58-acre lagoon which 
Impounds waste water containing nonflbrous 
material from the wood that could be harm-
ful to the stream. This effluent can be re-
tained for periods up to 2 weeks, during 
which time its harmful properties are dissi-
pated. It is then metered back into the 
river at a rate determined by the flow of the 
stream. 
The new effluent system is only the latest 
of a series of industrial "firsts" that are part 
of the sprawling mill. Built around the Na-
tion's first?and then largest?continuous 
digester, the mill has been the technical 
model of the industry since it went into pro-
ducticsa The continuous digester produces 
a steady stream of pulp, rather than turning 
it out by the traditional "batch" method. 
in 1964, the digester was placed under the 
control of an electronic computer which au-
tomatically makes any corrections needed to 
produce uniform pulp. This, too, is an inno-
vation in the paper industry. 
To the east of the mill a small lake allows 
the cooling of water that has become heated 
in condensing steam produced in the chemi-
cal recovery section of the mill. This lagoon 
also serves as a safety check to guard against 
any mishaps that might endanger the condi-
tion of the river. Should such upset condi-
tions occur, a sensing system automatically 
sounds an alarm and shuts off the discharge 
valve at the lagoon. 
Four million gallons of water can be proc-
essed daily here. Now covering 9 acres with a 
20-million-gallon capacity, the pond can 
readily be enlarged to 25 acres with a 105-
million-gallon capacity. 
On the opposite side of the mill Is the 
clarifier which handles 10 million gallons of 
water a day. Water fed into this system con-
tains solid materials such as fibers, lime and 
clays that have slipped through in the wash-
ing, bleaching, and forming processes. Such 
materials, if allowed to flow into the river, 
would use up vital dissolved oxygen and cre-
ate sludge beds. 
The clarifier is a huge, dish-shaped instal-
lation, 260 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep 
at the center. Mill water Is pumped to the 
center surface, from which point it flows out-
ward to the rim, spilling over the edges. In 
the meanwhile, 99 percent of the solids have 
settled to the bottom, where long scraper 
arms concentrate the sludge in the deepest 
part. Heavy-duty pumps then remove the 
sludge, 
These concentrated solids are pumped to 
a nearby filter house where more water is re-
moved, leaving a wet cake of solid material 
to be dumped in a nearby impoundment. 
At present there is no practical use for these 
solids, but experiments are being conducted 
to see if they can be transformed into a use-
ful byproduct. 
Behind the clarifier stretches the 59-acre 
surface of the strong waste lagoon. Here is 
collected effluent that has a stronger con-
centration of oxygen-absorbing materials. 
The wastes are held for a period up to 2 
weeks, during which time aeration and bac-
terial action reduces the oxygen demand. 
At the end of the treatment period the 
water is released to the river at a carefully 
controlled rate, The strong waste system is 
designed to be modified as technical advances 
are made in the field of effluent control. 
In addition to the three-way treatment 
system and the constant checking and dou-
ble checking that goes on at the Demopolis 
plant, Gulf States technicians keep a con-
stant watch on the river itself. Daily checks 
are made of the river's flow and of the dis-
solved oxygen content of the Water. In pe-
riods of low water this monitoring process 
becomes almost constant and the lab boat 
travels 50 miles downstream from the plant 
and 5 miles upstream. Samples of water are 
taken at 16 different points and 5 tests are 
run on each sample. 
The expanded effluent system at the 
Demopolis mill has involved the investment 
of over $1 million. Operating it and moni-
toring the river require an annual expense 
of $48,000, according to Gulf States technical 
personnel.

riety of work calls for full-time help in itself 
nor does it call for highly trained specialists. 
In short, it is general assistance work Of a 
varied nature to relieve our permanent staff 
of a summertime overload. It is an excellent 
opportunity and has been appreciated and 
enjoyed by these employees in the past. 
We have paid minimum wages in the past 
just because such a minimum existed, not 
because we were forced to by law. A new 
minimum would establish a higher wage 
scale even where it was not require by law, 
but just by common practice and usage as 
well as by employee pressure and unwilling-
ness to work "below minimum wages." 
The effect on us will be to quit hiring 
summer students and to handle the slight 
overload by staggering vacations, resched-
uling yearly operations, and working a little 
harder instead of granting long weekends, 
etc. 
This will eliminate both the training and 
earning opportunity for the young people 
we have hired for many years. 
While ours is a "small potato" operation, I 
think you can multiply this by many times 
in our area and in the Nation. We will not 
hire and train marginal employees but be 
forced to combine and reschedule so that 
our permanent employees can productively 
and economically handle our workload. 
I'm afraid this bill reminds me of the man 
who joined the war against poverty by toss-
ing a hand grenade qt a bum. 
U.S. Trading With Hanoi Traders 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. PAUL G. ROGERS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. ROGERS of Florida. Mr. Speak-
er, the United States, in our buildup in 
South Vietnam, is using ships from the 
same foreign countries which have been 
aiding Hanoi. 
Ironically the sealift of American sup-
plies to Saigon has required the use of 
ships flying the flags of the same free 
world countries helping to keep the Viet-
cong, supplied. In effect we are still 
doing business with our friends even 
though they are trading with our 
enemies. 
British. Norwegian, and Greek ship-
owners have been paid almost $2 million 
In freight rates alone since January of 
this year for hauling U.S. Government 
cargoes to South Vietnam. At the same 
time, British, Norwegian, and Greek ships 
as well as others from other allied coun-
tries, have made a total of 83 supply 
runs for the Communists by calling at 
ports in North Vietnam. 
Our friendly shippers charged $2 
million for freight hauled to Saigon. 
Yet the price for freight these same 
friends hauled to Hanoi has been paid 
by the 315 American troops killed since 
January in battle against the Vietcong. 
The State Department has stated that 
free world ships carry a substantial share 
of North Vietnam's seaborne imports. 
Since the United States has stepped up 
air attacks on North Vietnam's overland 
supply routes, Hanoi's dependence upon 
ports and shipping has increased, placing 
even greater Importance on shipping. - 
Thus every allied ship call in North 
Vietnam is critical, particularly when the 
Communist ships are so busy hauling in 
missiles and other military cargoes. 
Allied shipping to North Vietnam mtlst 
be stopped. 
Guilt Rests Upon the Individuals 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JACK EDWARDS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. Mr. 
Speaker, in all the casting about for ex-
planations, for the Los Angeles riots it is 
my hope that serious attention will be 
given to the comment of Newspaper Col-
umnist James J. Kilpatrick. His treat-
ment of the subject appeared in the 
Washington Star for August 20. 
The column follows: 
GUILT RESTS UPON THE INDIVIDUALS 
(By James J. Kilpatrick) 
All week long, the leading bleeding hearts 
of the Great Society have been wetting down 
the ashes of Los Angeles with tears for the 
poor oppressed. We have been fairly awash 
in tales of Watts, the palm-lined "ghetto," 
1.74th its unemployment, its crime, its incomes 
below $4,000. 
"The guilt lies on tui all," said one lu-
gubrious professor, gazing sadly into the 
camera. And he began to talk of frustra-
tions that just had to find catharsis. 
Twaddle. The guilt for this criminal an-
archy in Los Angeles is direct, immediate, 
and personal, as guilt must always be if the 
first essentials of our law still count for 
anything. And if guilt is to be extended in 
some sort of metaphysical conjecture, then 
let the guilt lie squarely upon such philoso-
phers as the Reverend Martin Luther King, 
and President Johnson. 
What did the Negro apologists of our time 
expect? How could they have been surprised 
by these events? Have they never heard of 
the harvest that is reaped by men who sow 
the wind? 
For the last 5 years or more, Dr. King has 
been going up and down the country, preach-
ing his own brand of ever-loving anarchy. 
His is the gospel that tells his simple-minded 
people to violate the laws they feel in their 
hearts to be wrong. What is the guilt that 
lies today on Dr. King? 
Dr. King is not alone. Over this same peri-
od, we have seen the White House itself and 
our Central Government as a whole contrib-
ute to the cynical disrespect for old institu-
tions. The Constitution, once regarded as 
the supreme law of the land, has been pro-
gressively reduced to the merest scrap of 
paper. This Republic was founded in part, 
at least, upon respect for the ancient rights 
of private property; this was the oldest "hu-
man right" of them all, but Congress and 
the courts have let it erode away. Is it any 
wonder that the Los Angeles insurrectionists 
put private property to the torch? 
Over the last 10 years, the American Negro 
has been singled out for a fulsome solicitude 
that has done him a terrible disservice. 
Through every conceivable device of law and 
politics, the Negro has been artificially puffed 
up, protected, pampered, wrapped in swad-
dling clothes, and excessively admired. He 
has been the particular object of public 
housing, poverty programs, job preferment, 
and aid for his illegitimate offspring. In the 
sanctified name of "civil rights," he has been 
excused for criminal conduct that in any 
other set of facts would have drawn 30 days 
on the roads. The Supreme Court of the 
United States, casting precedent to the 
winds, pardons hundreds of trespassers, dis-
turbers of the peace, and violators of the 
rights of other men?pardons them with a 
wave of judicial wands. What guilt lies on 
the Supreme Court of the United States? 
It is high time in this country to cut 
through the fatty sentimentality, the phony 
guilt, the couch-ridden recriminations. If 
rhetorical questions are to be asked, should 
we not inquire if the status of the Negro, a 
century after emancipation, is entirely the 
fault of white society? Entirely? Or is a 
large part of this squarely the fault of the 
Negro people themselves? 
It is said that the Negro has been kept 
down by the devices of segregation, and 
doubtless there is truth in this. But the 
whole of the proposition never is examined. 
Were all Negroes kept down? Or were many 
Negroes too lazy to get up? Say what you 
will about the South (it is not the South 
where whole cities go up in the flames of in-
surrection), the American Negro has had two 
generations of reasonable opportunity in the 
unsegregated North and West. How has he 
developed the opportunities put before him? 
In squalor, in apathy, in crime, in cadging 
off "the welfare," in dropping out of in-
tegrated schools, in breeding swarms of chil-
dren out of wedlock. This is the sorry record. 
And now, in Los Angeles, we witness bar-
barian hordes. 
What is the remedy? It is to treat the Ne-
gro like a white man. God knows his race 
has done little enough to deserve a fate so 
difficult and demanding. This is to expect 
of the Negro, first of all, work; and then self-
restraint; obedience to law; respect for au-
thority; creative imagination; right conduct. 
It is to expect of him some capacity for lead-
ership, some positive contribution to the 
communities he lives in, some sense of com-
mon decency in the maintenance of neigh-
borhoods. This is the white man's world?
a world that earns its way, accepts responsi-
bility, knows failure, knows success, and does 
not search for somewhere else to lay a per-
sonal blame. 
Plenty of Negroes have shown they under-
stand these elementary obligations. Espe-
cially in the South, a Negro middle class is 
rising, buying property, entering public life, 
setting a fine example of civic responsibility. 
Elsewhere in the country, examples multiply 
of individual excellence. If only the do-
gooders will stop expecting too much of the 
Negro too soon. If only they will learn that 
pampering and special privilege and legisla-
tive crutches cannot do the job. If only they 
will understand that the character of a back-
ward people cannot be tempered in Molotov 
cocktails. 
Respect for law, respect for property, re-
spect for the rights of others?these have to 
come first. And these must be enforced by 
the courts and by the suddenly stiffened de-
mands of a fed-up society. The guilt for 
these outrages lies upon individual arsonists, 
hoodlums, vandals, thieves. Try them. And 
then turn to the political and intellectual 
leaders who need forgiveness more: They 
know not what they do. 
The Christian Science Monitor has also 
made a great contribution in its lead edi-
torial of August 21. It emphasizes that a 
respect for law is and must be the foun-
dation upon which any community wel-
fare is based. I hope the editorial re-
ceives wide attention. It follows here: 
RESPECT FOR LAW 
Nearly 2,500 years ago Aristotle pointed out 
a great truth about the law. He warned that 
laws will not be obeyed unless men acquire 
the habit of obeying them. 
It is equally clear that anything which 
either encourages men to disregard law or

appeared from the index annually, including 
36 of the original 92 products in the index. 
In all, 375 products have appeared in the 
index at one time or another. One thera-
peutic group has had 38 different products, 
and no group has had less than 12, with the 
average amounting to 22. 
This turnover in the list of products at-
tests to the dynamic character of the in-
dustry. This index has been specially de-
signed to take cognizance of this unique 
phenomenon. It has also been necessary 
simultaneously to readjust the relative im-
portance of the individual products and 
or the therapeutic groups to alloW for these 
changes. However, let it be noted that no 
product can enter the index until it has be-
come one of the five top products in its 
roup; and then can only affect the index 
in the second year after its appearance there-
in. Thus, the initial offering price for a 
new product will not influence the index, 
since its price (at the end of the year) after 
having been on the market long enough to 
become a market leader will be realistic and 
competitive. 
To further indicate the changing character 
or the pharmaceutical market, it is of in-
terest to observe the changing importance of 
the therapeutic groups since 1949. The 
five most imortant groups in 1949, and their 
change in importance by 1964 is shown 
below 
Group: 
All other  
Vitamins   12.9 3.1 
Antibiotics    19 8 23. 3 
Hormones    10.4 9.2 
Sedatives    6. 2 2. 4 
If the classification is made on the basis of 
the most important groups in 1964, the fol-
lowing changes may be seen: 
Relative importance 
Group: 1949 1964 
Antibiotics  10,8 23.3 
All other  21.4 10. 2 
Hormones  10.4 9.2 
Ataractics  . 0 9.2 
Analgesics  4. 1 8.0 
Vitamins, sedatives, and all others have 
declined very sharply, while antibiotics and 
analgesics have more than doubled in im-
portance. Ataractics, nonexistent in 1049, 
have become the fourth most important 
group. 
Thus, it is apparent that the effect of price 
changes of vitamins on the index in 1949 was 
of much greater consequence than in 1084, 
while antibiotics were 2.2 times as important 
In 1064 compared with 1949. An index that 
does not reflect relative importance changes 
of such magnitude would be seriously defi-
cient and inaccurate. 
Prices used for the purpose of constructing. 
the index are Red Book published prices and 
hence are highest offering prices to retailers. 
Actual prices paid by retailers are frequently 
leas theft Red Book published prices, and to 
this degree, the price index, while showing 
price trends accurately, does not always re-
flect the short-term fluctuations in prices 
caused by current market forces. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics index for 
drugs and pharmaceuticals prior to 1960 un-
fortunately could not adjust to the rapid 
changes in products and their importance so 
that it failed to measure the full extent of 
the price movements in this industry. As a 
result, the BLS index went from 100.1 in 1949 
to 100.2 in 1960. In this same period the 
wholesale price index for ethical pharma-
ceuticals declined 7.6 percent. With the re-
vision of the BLS index in January 1961 this 
index was made more realistic, and its be-
havior closely parallels the industry index 
since then.

Tariffs on Sheet Glass 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN H. DENT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. DENT. Mr. Speaker, for many 
years I have been warning the House of 
the dangerous conditions in many of our 
basic industries because of the uneco-
nomic concept of free trade. 
Today, I present this house resolu-
tion, adopted by the Senate of Pennsyl-
vania on August 17, 1965, by unanimous 
vote. This resolution gives very com-
pelling reasons for the President of the 
United States to disregard idiotic and 
inconceivable, uneconomic decisions of 
the majority members of the Tariff Com-
mission at which they recommended that 
the glass tariff be lowered back to the 
unrealistic rates, that the late President 
John F. Kennedy, found to be extremely 
dangerous to the continuation of the 
glass industry as such in the United 
States. 
However, today we see our shelves piled 
higher and higher of foreign made prod-
ucts with their identity and manufactur-
ing sources so well hidden that thou-
sands of Americans buy such well known 
names as General Electric, Zenith, West-
?lox, and many others, completely ignor-
ant of the fact that these products are 
foreign made. 
It is a false premise to believe that 
foreign goods cost Americans less money. 
While this condition does exist When the 
foreign product is making its entry into 
the American market it soon disappears 
when American concerns become im-
mersed by foreign production in Ameri-
can trade markets. 
A close examination in the market 
place will show we are paying more to-
day for Japanese products; for products 
once made in the United States. 
While the resolution concerns itself 
with the problem of glass it could be 
applied to practically every product im-
- ported today which displaces American 
production. 
The antipoverty program will fall fiat 
on its face and many of the fine pieces 
of legislation promoted by the President 
and supported by your Congress, includ-
ing myself, will fail to do that which 
they are designed to do unless we reassess 
our trade position and do it now. 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution below has 
been sent to me by the Senate of Penn-
sylvania: 
RESOLUTION BY SENATE OF PENNSYLVANIA 
In 1962 the tariff on sheet glass was in-
creased because of the serious effect that 
Imported glass was having on the domestic 
industry. Prior to this increase the domestic 
industry was operating at a loss or on a 
marginal basis. 
On June 11, 1985, the Tariff Commission 
reported to the President, in a split three to 
two decision, that a reduction of the present 
duties would have only a slight effect on the 
domestic industry. 
The three majority commissioners made 
this reconunendation in spite of the fact that 
the foreigners have the same percentage of 
A4699 
the market now (25 percent) as they had 
prior to the increase in duties, These three 
commissioners also concede that their recom-
mendation is complicated by the fact that 
the increased duties have only been in effect 
for a very short period of time. 
Both the majority and minority members 
of the commission found that a reduction in 
tariff would force a number of older and 
smaller plants to close. It is apparent, then, 
that steady employment in the glass indus-
try and in the many industries serving the 
glass industry can be maintained only by 
keeping the tariff rates intact. 
Most of the jobs lost and plants closed 
would be in already depressed areas, where 
the Government is spending millions of dol-
lars to attract new industry, retain existing 
plants, and create jobs. Six industry plants, 
In fact, are in Appalachia, two of these in 
Pennsylvania; therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania finds that the termi-
nation of the escape-clause duties imposed 
In 1962 could only be harmful to the business 
and labor interests of the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania; and be it further 
Resolved, That the senate respectfully 
urges President Lyndon B. Johnson to retain 
the present tariff that was established under 
the escape-clause increase of June 1962; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
sent to President Lyndon B. Johnson, to the 
Tariff Commission, and to each U.S. Senator 
and Member of Congress from Pennsylvania. 
I certify that the foreging is a true and 
correct copy of senate resolution, serial No. 
32A, introduced by Senators Richard C. 
Frame, Albert R. Pechan, Robert D. Fleming, 
and Paul W. Mahady and adopted by the 
Senate of Pennsylvania the 17th day of Au-
gust, 1965.

Effect of Minimum Wage Law 
.r.12c.r.e.NSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. E. Y. BERRY 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
/N THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. BERRY. Mr. Speaker, under 
unanimous consent I insert in the REC-
ORD a letter from the secretary of the 
Rapid City, S. Dak., Builders Exchange 
to the chairman of the Labor Subcom-
mittee of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee of the House. 
The reason I have asked permission to 
Insert it is because this is only one small 
example of thousands and thousands of 
businesses across the Nation who will be 
forced to stop hiring American youth if 
the increase in the minimum wage law, 
goes through. I am not sure of the total 
amount the Federal Government is now 
spending on dropouts, but this _mini-
mum wage law will multiply that amount 
by several hundreds. 
The letter is as follows: 
It would appear that your proposal would 
most decidedly affect our operation and the 
employees we hire for summer assistance. 
We have been hiring high school seniors 
and graduates for summer assistance. We 
have tried to improve and prepare them to 
meet people in person and over the phone?
acquaint them with our various office equip-
ment and activities, etc. None of this va-

diminishes men's respect for it strikes at the 
very heart of Orderly, democratic, and pro-
gressive living. This does not mean that all 
laws are either right or perfect. It does not 
mean that laws should not change and 
evolve. But it does mean that the security, 
health, and progress of men and of nations 
lies in a respect for law and a willingness to 
obey it. 
In the last few days two prominent Ameri-
cans have addressed themselves to this very 
question, but from sharply different view-
points. Commenting on the Los Angeles 
riots, former President Eisenhower said, "I 
believe the United States as a whole has been 
becoming atmosphered * * * in a policy of 
lawlessness. If we like a law, we obey it; if 
we don't, we are told: 'You can disobey It.'" 
Also discussing the west coast rioting, New 
York Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY is quoted 
in an interview as saying that It was sense-
less to tell Negroes living in northern slums 
to obey the law, that to these Negroes the 
law is the enemy. 
The Kennedy statement is deeply disturb-
ing. Even granting the fact that many 
Negroes do in fact regard the law as their 
enemy, will the Kennedy statement do any-
thing to change their view? Will it not, 
rather, give them the impression that in-
fluential national figures look with sympathy 
upon their breaking of the law? As a former 
Attorney General who had shown himself 
active in securing wider Negro protection un-
der law, Senator KENNEDY is in a particularly 
favorable position to remind the Negro that 
the law is, in fact, his greatest safeguard. It 
Is regrettable that this opportunity was 
missed. 
We agree without reservation with Presi-
dent Eisenhower's statement: "I believe we 
must have greater respect for law. This 
Means to me we must review our * * * 
moral standards." 
Great efforts are now being made nation-
ally on behalf of the Negro. Greater efforts 
will doubtless be made in the future. While 
it is true that many of these efforts are be-
lated, it is also true that they are being made 
because the American people as a whole be-
lieve in the reign of justice. And justice 
Without law is an impossibility. 
Only through support of law and justice 
can any American citizen, Negro or white, 
hope to live in peace and prosperity. Law 
is man's present highest concept of that 
higher, perfect order toward which human 
progress tends. It must be protected, hon-
ored, fostered, and beyed. 
To Our Soldiers in Vietnam 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JOHN A. RACE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 , 
Mr. RACE. Mr. Speaker, the current 
issue of the Jewish Veteran carries a 
front page editorial entitled, "To Our 
Soldiers in Vietnam." 
This editorial, representing the official 
view of united Jewish war veterans, ana-
lyzes the role of Red China, not only in 
the "narrow confines" of the Vietnam 
struggle, "but also In the light of all its 
worldwide implications." 
Mr. Speaker, under leave to extend my 
remarks I request that the editorial be 
printed at this point in the RECORD, and 
commend its careful reading to my col-
leagues: 
To OUR SOLDIERS IN VIFINAIVI 
The veterans community of the United 
States wants you to know that we stand 
four-square in support of your sacrifice in 
the cause of freedom. As citizens who have 
borne arms for this Nation before you, we 
realize full well the importance to your 
morale and fighting spirit the assurance that 
the whole country is fully aware of the 
nature of your mission and the vital im-
portance of it. 
At the heart of the American involvement 
in Vietnam is the confrontation of the grow-
ing power and influence of the world's most 
dangerous and irresponsible nation?Red 
China. 
Debates are in progress about the Ameri-
can strategies and tactics in Vietnam, the 
rights and wrongs of our involvement, and 
the issue of escalation. These are questions 
which should rightfully be examined and 
discussed in the Congress and by the public. 
But we must not lose sight of the basic 
Motivation for the pending mobilization of 
Reserves and the expanded American com-
mitment in southeast Asia. 
Red China leaves us no alternative but a 
firm stand on every periphery of that restive 
aggressive goliath. 
We do not intend to make a case for the 
Saigon leaders of South Vietnam as the most 
perfect and desirable exponents of freedom. 
We hope and pray that better leadership for 
our side can be found. In the long struggle, 
we cannot defeat communism except through 
the dynamic appeal of a better idea?the 
true ideology of freedom. 
But in the larger picture, we are con-
fronted with such a massive peril that the 
deficiencies of the Saigon regime are some-
what beside the main point. The basic issue 
at hand is the dedication of China, a nation 
whose population is three of or four times 
as large as our own, to defeat and obliterate 
us. To them we are the mortal foe. They 
have served notice that they intend to crush 
us and our way of life. 
Today, China has the atomic bomb. Crude 
though their weapon may be when compared 
with the supermegaton power in American 
hands, the fact remains that the least re-
sponsible regime on earth has the power to 
ignite a thermonuclear conflict. Millions of 
Chinese may be wiped out. But other na-
tions could be involved in a holocaust which 
Russia might not be able to avoid despite 
Its present differences with Chinese ex-
tremism. 
RED CHINA AND THE MIDDLE EAST 
Right now, China is seeking to gain her 
ends by exploiting so-called wars of national 
liberation. That is her role in the bloody, 
confused and unhappy affair in Vietnam. It 
also seems to be her objective elsewhere, even 
in the Near East where the Chinese are seek-
ing among other goals, to foment Arab guer-
rilla violence against Israel to create a tacti-
cal diversion to Vietnamese conflict. 
Let us also examine the role of Red China 
toward Israel. Peiping blackballed Israel 
back in the days of the Bandung Confer-
ence of Asian Nations, alleging that Israel 
was "an imperialist creature" and had no 
right to exist. Israel had previously recog-
nized Red China diplomatically because, 
Whether one likes it or not, Red China exists. 
But Peiping did not reciprocate and rejected 
a diplomatic exchange because her only 
thought of Israel was as a scapegoat to use 
in appealing to Arab sympathies. 
Arab guerrilla attacks on Israel, if carried 
to lengths that would inflame the whole tense 
frontier problem, would spread, confuse, and 
Intensify the world crisis. It would help the 
Vietcong by keeping American forces on the 
alert in the Mediterranean and Europe. The 
U.S. 6th Fleet, for instance, could not relin-
quish its marine components for duty in 
the Far East, if trouble were brewing in the 
Near East. 
A4701 
Such a move would also inflame the Arab 
masses to serve Chinese ends by intimidating 
Arab leaders into closer support of the 
Peiping line. China, instead of Russia 
would become the most militant activist and 
leading exponent of Arab fanaticism against 
Israel. 
Peiping feels that an Arab-Israel war could 
diminish mounting American pressure in 
Vietnam, extricate China from a military 
showdown for the present, and provide more 
time for development of atomic weapons and 
delivery systems. Such strife is consistent 
with Chinese attempts to foment "anti-
imperialist" disorder throughout southeast 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 
Offers have already been made by China 
to the extremist "liberation front" of Pales-
tinian Arab refugees. Headed by Arab agi-
tator Ahmed Shukairy, an Arab delegation 
was welcomed to Peiping and promised 
money, weapons, and military training if 
they would launch a "liberation war" against 
Israel. China envisaged internal sabotage 
by Israel's Arab population, creation of an 
armed underground movement, bombings, 
sabotage, and infiltration raids from outside. 
Mao Tse-tung told the Arabs that "an Al-
gerian delegation told us once that Algeria 
lost a million lives in the guerrilla struggle 
for independence. I told them that peoples 
should not be frightened if their population 
decreases in the course of a liberation war, 
for they will enjoy a period of peace after-
ward in which they can again multiply." 
Peiping considers it ridiculous that 45 mil-
lion Arabs surrounding 21/4 million Israelis 
do not crush the Jews with action and blood 
instead of mere words and promises as es-
poused by Egypt's Nasser and others. 
Nasser and Shukairy are not quite ready 
for a "peoples' war" against Israel because 
they know that Israel has the power to hit 
back and that the United States might not 
stand idly by. Nasser fears that the Sinai 
zone might become another Danang, poised 
against Arab infiltration if the "masses" ever 
materialized on a Vietcong-type rampage. 
Mao subsequently condemned Arab lack of 
militance as "bourgeois humanitarianism." 
They are "too preoccupied with survival," he 
charged. But he hopes eventually, inexora-
bly, to enlist the Arabs in a Near Eastern 
escalation in keeping with the insidious and 
subversive Chinese strategies. 
Therefore, when we support our Govern-
ment and its actions in Vietnam we do so not 
only within the narrow confines of that area 
but also in the light of all its worldwide 
implications. 
Castro Threat Not So Empty 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OV 
HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. YOUNGER. Mr. Speaker, so far 
as the public is concerned, there seems to 
be no attention being paid to Castro and 
his regime in Cuba as constituting a 
threat to the Western Hemisphere. 
I was glad to note the following article 
written by Marguerite Higgins which ap-
peared in the Washington Star: 
CASTRO THREAT NOT SO EMPTY 
(By Marguerite Higgins) 
Until recently, Johnson administration offi-
cials tended to shrug off Cuban Premier Fidel 
Castro's boasts of turning Latin American 
wars of liberation into Vietnam-type con-
flicts.

A4702 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD APPENDIX August 23, 1965 
And in its preoccupation with Vietnam, the 
American public has failed to notice very sig-
nificant and troubling developments south of 
the border. 
But events are not only proving that Cas-
tro's threats are not so empty, but are also 
calling into question many of the smug as-
sumptions about developments in such places 
as Venezuela. 
Any comparisons to Vietnam area are of 
course to the earliest stages of that war when 
victims of' terror and ambush were listed by 
the dozens rather by the thousands. 
ASSITMPTI6N IN treNassreea 
With regard to Venezuela, it has been as-
sumed in Washington that the success 2 years 
ago in holding free elections in spite of oppo-
sition from Communist terrorists had more 
or less settled he guerrilla problem. 
After all, it was reasoned the Venezuelan 
Government was freely chosen, left of center, 
and very progressive in social good works. 
More than most people on this earth, Amer-
icans cling to the myth that good govern-
ment is of itself a defense against Commu-
nist guerrillas. 
Very handily for the Communists, we have 
been brainwashed into assunaing that Com-
munist terrorists can thrive only if most of 
the people are against a government. It is 
a very unhistorie assumption. 
In Europe, the destruction of Czechoslo-
vakia's popular and progressive government 
by a Comraunist minority is just one of many 
examples of the fact that the Communists 
usually take over in spite of the will of the 
MajOrity. 
VENEEDELA LESSON 
In Venezuela, the lesson is that terrorist 
guerrillas, if supported from the outside 
(Cuba) can dangerously increase their 
troublemaking capacity in spite of good gov-
ernment?a government that has among 
other things effectively worked at matters 
of land reform and helping the peasantry. 
As in Vietnam, the peasants of Venezuela 
may hate the guerrillas, but they will not ex-
pose them for fear of torture and death. 
The discovery of 5 tons of armaments 
hidden in the San Antonio Del Gauche re-
glee of Venezuela this week follows a gun 
battle in the same area between military 
forces and guerrillas. A secret guerrilla 
headquarters of the FALN (National Libera-
tion Armed Forces) was even uncovered in 
the petroleum center of Anzoatguil State. 
TRATNINE FOR GDERRILLAS 
But if Castro and colnisany have their way, 
this is but a foretaste of far Worse to come. 
According to reliable reports reaching 
Washington, guerrilla 'training?once con-
fined to Cuba itself-1a going on in the Vene-
zuelan States of Lara and Falcon. The guer-, 
rilla chieftain is a fdrrner-Venezuelan news-
paper man, Fabricio Ojeda. 
The Venezuelan National Liberation Front 
believes in the formalities. It is officially 
represented in Cuba by German Layret, who 
recently went through the formality of sign-
ing a "mutual aid pact" with the Vietcong 
representative in Havana. 
Castro's press and radio made much of 
this and openly boasted that the pact her-
alded the start of Vietnam-type wars, not 
just in Venezuela but in other parts of Latin 
America. Clearly, the Communist guerrillas, 
like their counterparts in Asia. are planning 
carefully and diabolically for the years ahead. 
Weapons and central direction are coming 
from Cuba and will continue to do so--as 
long as the United States permits this to 
goon. 
The question is whether the United States 
can afford to look the other way while Cuba 
provides the transmission belt for weapons 
with which the Communists plan to subvert 
the hemisphere. 
In Vietnam, we waited until almost the 
11th hour before attempting seriously to 
interrupt outside sources of supply of men 
and material. Isn't there a lesson to be 
learned from that tragedy? Or are we to 
he parialys,ed into inaction by failing to take 
seriougy Castro's threats of turning Latin 
America into a series of Vietnam's? 
One Woman Comments 
EXTENSION OF REMARKS 
OF 
HON. JAMES A. HALEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, August 23, 1965 
Mr. HALEY. Mr. Speaker, in this 
time of domestic turmoil and interna-
tional crisis, it is refreshing to hear some 
one speak with a calm sane voice. For 
this reason I have asked permission to 
include in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, my 
friend, Mrs. George L. Burr's column, 
"One Woman Comments," which ap-
peared in the August 19, 1965, issue of 
the Winter Haven, Fla., Herald. 
Josephine Burr, as she is known to her 
many friends and readers, gives sound

ONE WOMAN COMMENTS 
(By Josephine G. Burr) 
Let us forget the trials of the National 
Council of Churches this week while I write 
a letter to my granddaughter. She is only 
6 and starting to school, but I am going to 
pretend that she is 18 and starting to college 
because I hope some college-bound boy or 
girl will read. this and possibly think a bit 
more carefully when he gets to the campus. 
DEAREST Vicisre: I know you are a bit fear-
ful as you leave home this fall, for you are 
actually going out into the world alone for 
the first time. A college or university cam-
pus is a world of its own and a place where 
you will meet all kinds of people. You will 
either thoroughly enjoy your life there, as I 
did, or be heartsick because you did. not 
realize your great opportunity to learn What 
life is all about. Life of today is much more 
complicated than it was for me 50 years ago, 
however, so I think maybe I can help if you 
will heed. 
First you young folks are much more aware 
of what is going on in the world today than 
we were back in 1913. There are peculiar 
"Isms" abroad in the land, wild-eyed terror-
ists, and some who believe communism will 
save the world from destruction. But there 
are also many good. ideas, many fine thinkers. 
I hope you have absorbed from your prob-
lems class in high school or the course you 
took in communism that Florida high schools 
require, the dangers that lurk in these pecu-
liar subversive minds. I am sure you read 
of the troubles the Berkeley, Calif., campus 
had last fall. Many people thought it all the 
fault of Communist off-campus folk who 
created this trouble. I _think-they had their 
part in it, but let's face it, there is unrest on 
every college campus today created by this 
changing world in which we find ourselves, 
The "Wave of the Future" that Ann Morrow 
Lindbergh wrote about back in the 1940's has 
overtaken us. Every nation, however small, 
is trying for the highest kind of freedom and 
to equal the good things that we here in 
America have enjoyed for so long. They hate 
us for having found them first, and since 
this is the "land of the free and the home 
of the brave," they are trying to prove, in 
their strivings, that we are wrong and they 
are right. Revolution is in the air and the 
world is so rampant for freedom that we be-
gin to wonder if we are as free as we have 
always taken for granted. we were. Let us 
not waiver?ever--in our ideas of what free-
dom really is and. how to keep it. That is 
what you young folks of today must work to 
preserve. 
One thing I want to emphasize as you start 
your college career?please do your own 
thinking. You will doubt yourself at times 
and your ability to think right, but do not 
allow the thoughts of someone else to be-
come yours unless you have spent hours try-
ing to find out the truth about controversial 
subjects. You, Vickie, have been fortunate 
in growing up in a normal home. Many of 
the young people you will afeet have warped 
minds because they were not so fortunate. 
Grief, money troubles, broken homes, liquor, 
can tear up lives and create so much unhap-
piness, especially in young people's minds, 
that they become unstable in their think-
ing and their emotions. Look into the back-
ground of those who seem different and try 
to discover why they are different?then feel 
sorry, be tolerant, but do your own thinking. 
But we were discussing freedom. When I 
was in college no one questioned it. Since 
then we have helped France and England 
preserve their freedoms in World War I, then 
again in World War II when the madman, 
Hitler, tried to change things to his warped 
mind's way of thinking, we sent our young 
men to fight for freedom. Now the Russians, 
who realized they were being ruled by a mad. 
king, cannot seem to be happy just changing 
their own world. They are being led by the 
ideologies of three other mad men, Karl Marx 
of Germany, Lenin, and Stalin. But some-
thing has happened in our own land of the 
free that is very frightening. We do not 
all seem to appreciate that our Founding 
Fathers planned well and there are too many 
Americans trying to change our world. 
Two characteristic stand out in all this 
strife of today?hate and fear. They are not 
new?they ruled the German Kaiser, they 
definitely ruled Hitler, and today they rule 
all the odd people who think change is the 
only road to freedom. The one thing to me 
that will make you realize we have been and 
still are on the right track in America, will 
be your absorbing the education that you are 
about to undertake. However, you must keep 
your feet on the ground; you must believe, as 
you have been taught, that there is a God 
above us all who strives to help us; and that 
if you live by the Golden Rule, you cannot 
get off the right course for long. Education 
also means tolerance to me, Vickie, for all 
people are not made alike?everyone has his 
good points and his bad ones. Just be sure 
you can tell the difference and are not led by 
bigotry or mass thinking, but by your own 
careful estimation of what is the best course. 
I airs sure you will know and if you become 
confused, pick out a person you love and trust 
and talk it all out. 
One last admonition and to me it is vary 
important. I want you to have fun and 
enjoy your college life as well as its oppor-
tunities, and the best way to do this is to 
join with a group of congenial folks in a 
Greek letter society. Today they are the last 
sure bulwark of Americanism on the college 
campus. They exist for the sake of friend-
ship; they are governed by men and women 
who have been careful in their thinking. 
Their first loyalty is to God and country and 
they provide a "home away from home" where 
you can find folks reared as you were reared, 
girls and boys who think about life as you 
do and have been forewarned by parents and 
fraternity elders about the dangers of today. 
You will find folks you can talk to and dis-
cuss things with, but best of all, you will 
find real friends.
