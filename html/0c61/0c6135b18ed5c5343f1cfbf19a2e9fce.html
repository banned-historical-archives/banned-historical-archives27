 Overview
 Information available
 as of 30 January 1984
 was used in this report.
 China: Energy ant
 Economic Growth
 China has made exceptional progress in the past five years in improving the
 efficiency with which its economy uses energy. This has allowed fairly
 rapid economic growth and a large increase in energy exports despite slow
 and erratic growth in the production of energy. Unlike most countries,
 China has done this without sharp increases in energy prices.
 Energy conservation has not come without costs, however. Use of capital
 equipment is down sharply because of fuel and electricity shortages. Some
 indexes of economic progress, such as the share of farmland plowed
 mechanically, have actually declined. Moreover, in terms of energy
 consumption, China's vast rural population remains one of the most
 impoverished in the world.
 We anticipate that pressures on China's energy supplies caused by
 economic growth will increase through the rest of the 1980s:
 ? Offshore oil production may not be available soon enough to offset an ex-
 pected decline in production from the country's large but mature onshore
 oilfields-especially Daqing.
 ? Coal, because it is being counted on to substitute for oil wherever
 possible, will be hard pressed to provide the energy needed to fuel
 economic growth.
 ? Electricity shortages, caused by insufficient investment in recent years
 and surging demand, may be the most critical short-term bottleneck to
 economic growth.
 Beijing must resolve these and other potentially divisive problems if
 satisfactory growth is to be attained. Two important decisions being
 debated are whether to reduce or even eliminate oil exports-20 percent of
 the country's foreign exchange earnings-and how to build the political
 consensus that is needed to raise domestic energy prices sharply.
 Nevertheless, the government's strong control mechanisms and the high
 priority placed on energy conservation should allow the economy to
 increase at a modest 4- or 5-percent rate through the 1980s--slower than
 in the past but faster than that initially planned by Beijing. We doubt that
 the much faster growth expected by Beijing for the 1990s can be achieved
 without putting undue strain on both energy producers and consumers.

 China's 1978 decision to forgo self-reliance and bring in foreign invest-
 ment, both to spur energy production and to improve the efficiency of
 energy use, appears firmly on track. We believe the need for technology
 and capital will act as an important and continuing underpinning to
 China's opening to the West, especially to the United States. Commercial
 opportunities for US energy companies in China should continue to expand
 and help to strengthen political links between the two countries.
 The depth of such cooperation-and China's long-term ability to meet its
 energy requirements-is critically dependent on large oil discoveries being
 made in China's offshore regions. Should the Western firms that are
 preparing for intensive drilling this spring not find the oil deposits they
 expect, China may have to decide between importing oil in the 1990s-at
 great expense to the country's international financial position-or return-
 ing to the more self-reliant and isolationist policies of the past.

 China: Energy and
 Economic Growth
 Five years ago the People's Republic of China sharply
 reduced its long-term expectations for increasing en-
 ergy production-particularly petroleum-and began
 to address the problem of energy shortages that have
 increasingly become an obstacle to economic growth.
 Looming energy shortages were an important factor
 behind Deng Xiaoping's major economic "readjust-
 ment" of 1979, when it became apparent that Soviet-
 style growth led by heavy industry-without the
 Soviet Union's huge energy resources-could prove
 disastrous. Premier Zhao Ziyang, in his December
 1982 speech announcing the Sixth Five-Year Plan
 (1981-85), reiterated those concerns and stated that
 expected energy shortages were a major reason for the
 plan's low economic targets. A deputy director of
 China's Academy of Social Sciences recently was
 more explicit, saying, "Whether or not China solves
 its energy problem will determine the direction of
 Chinese economic progress over the next 20 years."
 Beijing since 1978 has countered the energy problem
 on three fronts. First, it has attacked the country's
 wasteful energy consumption habits by restructuring
 industry, closing inefficient plants, and placing quotas
 on energy use. Political considerations and a lack of
 flexibility in its price system have prevented China
 from raising energy prices sharply, the single most
 effective measure taken by other countries to curb
 energy consumption. Nevertheless, the program has
 been successful. Energy consumption has increased by
 only 1.9 percent per year between 1978 and 1982
 while industrial growth averaged more than 7 percent
 annually. In the first three decades of the PRC's
 existence, energy consumption rose at a faster rate
 than industry as a whole.
 Second, China has tried to correct policies that
 pressed energy industries to meet short-term produc-
 tion goals at the expense of developing the resource
 base. Higher priority, at least in theory, is now being
 given to exploration and infrastructure development.
 We believe that Beijing has not been satisfied with
 results thus far. There are no indications, for instance,
 that the long-term decline in proved oil reserves has
 been stemmed. Also, a recent surge in demand for
 coal, caused by a sharp rebound in heavy industrial
 output, is leading coal mines to produce as much as
 possible and neglect investment in long-term coal
 capacity. Capital-intensive hydroelectric and nuclear
 projects, moreover, have been slow to move out of the
 planning phase.
 Third, and of the most interest to the United States
 and other foreign countries, Beijing has opened im-
 portant segments of its once highly protected energy
 industries to Western and Japanese investment. In a
 remarkable turnaround, the Petroleum, Coal, and
 Electric Power Ministries, once bastions of Mao
 Zedong's ideology of self-reliance, have become lead-
 ing proponents of Western investment in China. Proj-
 ects already under way will, in our opinion, foster
 long-term commercial links between China and the
 non-Communist world. A nagging problem, however,   25X1
 is that some in the leadership, with the intention of
 reasserting self-reliance at some later date, will at-
 tempt to import technology at a pace we believe will
 be too rapid for proper absorption.
 This three-pronged policy is aimed at doubling both
 energy output and the efficiency of energy use be-
 tween 1980 and the year 2000, thus allowing a
 quadrupling of GNP by that date without the need for
 importing energy. These goals imply growth rates of
 3.5 percent per year for energy output and 7 percent
 per year for the economy as a whole
 In analyzing China's energy situation, we looked both
 at production and at demand to determine how
 realistic Beijing's goals are and what problems it will
 face in reaching them. Data recently released by the
 Chinese make possible a good understanding of how

 Approved For Release 2009/02/20: CIA-RDP85TOO31 OR0001 00050007-4
 Forecasting future energy demand is more difficult.
 Data limitations and the lack of market mechanisms
 make standard econometric forecasts of dubious value
 for China. Static input-output matrixes, on the other
 hand, also require large amounts of data and tend to
 underestimate the potential for efficiency gains. These
 shortcomings are compounded by the need to differen-
 tiate between oil, coal, gas, and hydroelectricity in
 order to avoid assuming too large a degree of substi-
 tutability between fuels
 We looked at potential energy demand by breaking
 the economy into the key energy-consuming industries
 and, using available Chinese plans, by forecasting the
 growth of output in these industries and the coal, oil,
 gas, and electricity required for such growth. These
 individual industry studies provided the data to make
 the energy/GNP elasticity judgments-the percent
 change in energy required for a given percentage
 change in GNP-that we believe may be applicable to
 the entire economy. In this way we hope to avoid the
 common but often unwarranted assumption that ener-
 gy demand increases in a 1-to-1 relationship to GNP,
 that is, an elasticity of 1. At the same time we
 examine the implicit assumption by China's planners
 that energy demand will increase at only one-half the
 rate of increase of GNP, that is, an elasticity of 0.5.
 Our results suggest that the Chinese economy will
 have an overall energy elasticity of between 0.65 and
 0.70 for the remainder of the 1980s and the 1990s-
 that is to say that energy consumption will increase at
 between 65 and 70 percent as fast as national income.
 This, we believe, is an encouraging coefficient-
 smaller than what is expected for most major coun-
 tries and much smaller than China's historical record.
 It is slightly higher than China's performance since
 1978 because considerable restructuring has occurred
 since that date. We are optimistic, however, only
 because we believe the Chinese Government will
 continue to exert great control over the use of
 energy-particularly oil and electricity. We believe
 situation the country can ill afford.
 uncontrolled demand for energy, even at sharply
 higher prices, would force China to import energy, a
 We expect the use of oil to increase only 45 percent as
 fast as national income in the 1980s, rising to 80
 percent in the 1990s as opportunities for switching to
 coal are reduced. This still will allow substantial
 growth in the petrochemical industries. Coal con-
 sumption will increase about 75 percent as fast as
 national income in the 1980s, falling to 60 percent in
 the 1990s, with a large part of the increase going to
 the electric power industry. For electric power itself,
 we agree with Chinese estimates that electricity con-
 sumption will increase at the same speed, if not faster,
 than national income
 These results suggest, based on anticipated gains in
 energy output, that the economy will grow no faster
 than 5 percent per year over an extended period. This
 is not much different than earlier studies by both the
 CIA and the World Bank.' Our results show that even
 5-percent annual economic growth will put more
 strain on the coal and electric power industries than it
 will on the petroleum industry-despite anticipated
 slow growth in petroleum output-as long as Beijing
 is willing to reduce oil exports. Unlike World Bank
 estimates, we do not believe China will have to import
 oil unless the offshore exploration program brings on
 line substantially less than the 50 million tons of
 annual capacity (1 million barrels per day) that
 several major oil companies believe is likely. In the
 near term, a shortage of electric power appears to be
 the most likely constraint on economic growth.
 China produced about 700 million tons of coal equiva-
 lent (MTCE) commercial energy in 1983, up about 5
 percent from 1982. Energy output in the past five

 years, however, has increased at an average annual
 rate of only 2 percent, in marked contrast to the 6-
 percent annual growth registered in the preceding two
 decades. The steady erosion of coal's share of energy
 supply that occurred from 1950-78 has been reversed;
 coal's share of energy output rose from 70 percent in
 1978 to 71 percent in 1983. Petroleum, with output
 flat since 1978, has lost about 4 percentage points and
 is now providing 18.8 percent of national energy
 supply. Hydropower has gained steadily to provide
 about 4.4 percent of the country's energy, while
 natural gas has declined to only about 2.5 percent. In
 addition, Chinese economists estimate that agricul-
 ture and forestry provide about 300 MICE in the
 form of crop stalks and firewood, which is consumed
 in rural China on a noncommercial basis. On the basis
 of these figures, China ranks third in world energy
 output, following the Soviet Union and the United
 States. In per capita energy production, however,
 China ranks in the bottom one-third of all countries in
 the world.
 China's Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) and less
 definite but widely quoted long-range plans indicate
 that energy output will continue to grow slowly
 through the end of the century. Table I includes what
 we consider the most realistic energy-sector targets.
 The 1985 targets are revised official Sixth Five-Year
 Plan goals and appear reasonable. For 1990, we have
 used our own estimates, which are generally based on
 unofficial Chinese projections. For 2000 we have used
 projections made in 1982 by the Shanghai World

 a We use the Chinese definition of coal equivalent energy to
 aggregate various energy types. One ton of coal equivalent energy
 (TCE) is defined as the amount of fuel that is required to provide 7
 million kilocalories of heat energy. It is equivalent to 1.4 tons of raw
 coal, 0.7 ton of crude oil, 752 cubic meters of natural gas, and 413
 kilowatt-hours of electricity.

 Sciences publication. The Herald also made projec-
 tions for 1985 and 1990, but these appear overly
 pessimistic in the light of a strong performance in
 1982 and 1983. These projections fall slightly short of
 Beijing's general guidelines for doubling the availabil-
 ity of energy by the year 2000. They imply growth
 rates of 2.9 percent a year through the rest of the
 1980s and just over 3 percent a year in the 1990s.C
 Achievement of these energy production targets will
 require a sharp boost in investment. Energy invest-
 ment now accounts for about 45 percent of industrial
 investment, and Beijing's efforts to control its overall
 investment outlays have strongly affected the energy
 sector. Despite considerable emphasis on the energy
 problem, Beijing reduced state investment in energy
 development from 11.4 billion yuan in 1978 to only
 9.0 billion yuan in 1981 and 10.2 billion in 1982 (see
 table 2). The Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85), more-
 over, included only a 2-percent-a-year increase. The
 sharpest decline occurred in the petroleum sector-
 probably because China's expensive offshore explora-
 tion has been picked up by Western companies-but
 declines were also registered in coal and electric
 power.
 Only within the last year has Beijing allowed energy
 investment to rebound. Eleven-month data for 1983
 indicate energy investment reached close to 13.6
 billion yuan for the year, up about 35 percent from
 1982. The largest increases went to the electric power
 industry.

 Coal-China's Energy Foundation
 The 71-percent share of China's energy provided by
 coal is the highest for any major country. As suggest-
 ed in table 1, that share will probably rise even higher
 in the next decade as China strives to double its coal
 output. China certainly has the coal reserves to meet
 that goal-official Chinese estimates of 600 billion
 tons are some 900 times current annual output.
 Beijing, moreover, has recently begun an investment
 program that should allow substantial growth in coal
 output.' However, much of this growth will depend on
 whether China holds to the present course-China's
 coal policies have fluctuated greatly over the past two

 d Plan for 1983.
 China's coal output increased by 7.4 percent in 1982
 to reach a record 666 million tons of raw coal (475
 MTCE). Output in 1983 again increased substantial-
 ly, meeting the 1985 target of 700 million tons two
 years early.
 The improved performance comes after a difficult
 period in 1980 and 1981 during which coal investment
 was reduced and output dropped. This decline can be
 attributed in part to diminished demand by heavy
 industrial users during the 1980 and 1981 Chinese
 recession. Heavy industry rebounded strongly in 1982
 and in 1983, along with coal output. The decline was
 also caused by government policies that encouraged
 investment in profitmaking industries at the expense

 of industries, such as coal, that often operate at a loss
 because of low prices arbitrarily set by the state. Low
 prices are a continuing problem for the industry, but
 Beijing has substantially increased central govern-
 ment investment. The 1981-85 Plan allocated 17.9
 billion yuan (approximately $10 billion) to coal-32
 percent more than in the preceding five-year period-
 despite the fact that overall industrial investment was
 scheduled to decrease. Coal's share of the capital
 construction budget was thus set to rise from 6.1 to
 7.8 percent. Actual expenditures will probably be
 considerably higher. In addition, the industry has
 been opened to foreign investment-largely Japanese,
 European, and US-which may add the equivalent of
 1 billion yuan by 1985.
 Two years ago Beijing set targets of 700 million tons
 of coal output by 1985, 850 million tons by 1990, and
 approximately 1,200 million tons by 2000.
 Beijing now hopes to exceed the planned targets
 and reach 740 million tons by 1985 and 940 million
 tons by 1990. We believe that rapidly increasing
 demand, and possibly sharp price increases, will spur
 China's mines into meeting this 1985 target. They
 may produce as much as 900 million tons by 1990, a
 figure projected in an authoritative article in the
 Communist-affiliated Hong Kong newspaper Wen
 Wei Bao. The railroads, however, may not have the
 capacity to transport the coal.
 Beijing's strategy for increasing coal output includes:
 ? Encouraging the development of small mines to
 meet local and short-term coal requirements. These
 mines accounted for about two-thirds of the increase
 in national coal output during the past two years.
 They are slated to increase output from 350 million
 tons in 1982 to 500 million tons in the year 2000.
 ? Significantly expanding and developing new state-
 controlled underground mines-especially in
 Shanxi, Shandong, Anhui, and Guizhou Prov-
 inces-using domestic, Japanese, and European fi-
 nancing. These mines will increase production ca-
 pacity from about 350 million tons in 1982 to 600
 million tons in 2000.
 ? Opening five very large open pit mining areas using
 large amounts of US and European investment.
 These new mines will produce 200 million tons by
 Of the 600-million-ton increase in capacity, at least
 130 million tons will be developed in cooperation with
 Western and Japanese firms. Problems in marketing
 the foreign company's share of coal from these proj-
 ects have come up in the past year as a result of a
 sharp drop in the international coal prices. Final
 agreement on the large Occidental Petroleum joint
 venture for development of the Pingsuo open pit mine,
 for instance, has been delayed. These, and the trans-
 portation problems that constantly plague the indus-
 try, may prevent Beijing from meeting its targets.
 Given the high priority currently afforded the coal
 industry, we believe, nevertheless, output will increase
 LDA I
 Petroleum- Depending on Offshore Discoveries
 China's oil production peaked in 1979 at 106 million
 tons' a year (152 MTCE per year) and declined
 slightly in 1980 and 1981. China has since recouped
 most of the loss and is now the seventh-largest
 producer in the world, about the same as Venezuela
 and the United Kingdom.
 Beijing expects little growth in production through
 1990; after that it has high expectations for offshore
 production. Without further technical study we are
 not in a position to challenge those expectations and
 have included an estimate of 105 million tons (2.1
 million b/d)-the same as 1983-for 1990. This
 would include a small amount of new offshore oil by
 that point. Given the limitations of the country's
 proved oil reserves, however, we believe there is a
 chance that oil production will decline by 1990. If
 offshore oil is not as abundant as initial signs indicate,
 the 1990s could see further declines. The forecasts of
 the Shanghai World Economic Herald for 150 million
 tons (3 million b/d) by 2000 is reasonable, however, if

 An October 1980 edition of a
 plans were apparently made by simply extrapolating
 the rapid growth of production in the 1970s, without
 regard to actual oil reserves.
 China does not publish official statistics on oil re-
 serves, and we believe that many figures quoted in
 both the Chinese and Western press are far too high.
 journal published by the Chinese Academy of Social
 Sciences included what appears to be the most defini-
 tive calculation of reserves to date. It cited a reserve-
 to-production (RAP) ratio of 14.6 to 1, which at the
 1980 output rate of 106 million tons (773 million
 barrels) is equivalent to 1.5 billion tons (11.3 billion
 barrels) of reserves. This is another way of saying that
 China, without any new discoveries, has enough re-
 serves to last less than 15 years at current production
 rates.' Reserves by the end of 1983 were probably
 down slightly as Chinese statements indicate oil is
 being produced faster than it is being found. Official-
 ly, the Ministry of Petroleum states that it has found
 geological oil reserves in excess of the volume of oil it
 has produced in the last two years, but typically in oil
 industry experience only about 40 percent of this
 95    2000 category of reserves is ever produced. We estimate
 that the current oil reserves figure is below 1.5 billion
 tons (11 billion barrels) and that the R/P ratio is
 about 14 to 1.
 offshore oil production is successful. We believe only
 an exceptionally successful offshore oil program and a
 large increase in exploration activity in western China
 would make the 200-million-ton (4-million-b/d) offi-
 cial target attainable.4
 Beijing, as recently as early 1978, had much higher
 expectations for oil production. According to the
 official plan at that time, as outlined by Vice Premier
 Yu Qiuli, production was slated to reach 150 million
 tons in 1980 and 240 million tons by 1985. These
 This marks a doubling of reserves since 1965, but,
 because production has increased so rapidly, the ratio
 has plunged. Most of the increase in reserves came
 before 1977 with expansion of the Daqing oilfield in
 Manchuria and the Shengli oilfield in North China
 and discovery of the Liaohe and Renqiu oilfields, also
 in the North China Basin complex. Since then we
 know of only one significant commercial onshore
 discovery-the Zhongyuan fields, which the World
 Bank is helping to develop. At least one and possibly
 four or five offshore fields have been discovered in the
 last two years but exploration is not far enough along
 Western estimates for proved and probable reserves include 13.2
 billion barrels by the World Bank, 9.48 billion barrels by a
 Japanese source, and 17 billion barrels by the US Geological
 Survey. Chinese and Western press articles, on the other hand, have
 quoted figures as high as 440 billion barrels, which is higher than

 to determine reserves
 these discoveries are relatively small and will not have
 a significant impact on the countrywide reserves. New
 fields have also recently been discovered in the Qai-
 dam and Tarim Basins in western China, but we
 doubt those can currently be considered commercially
 viable because of their isolated locations.
 An R/P ratio of less than 15 would not necessarily be
 a major problem for a country such as China with
 large, relatively unexplored regions offshore and in its
 far west. The R/P ratio for the United States, in
 comparison, is approximately 9 to 1. China does have
 a major problem with the location of its reserves.
 Much of China's proved reserves-the World Bank
 estimates about 20 percent-are in Qinghai Province
 and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region where poor
 transportation hampers production. The Xinjiang re-
 gional government estimates that oil production in the
 west will quadruple from 5 million tons per year
 (100,000 b/d) to 20 million tons per year (400,000
 b/d) by the year 2000; even if that target is reached,
 the entire west will produce only slightly more than
 the Shengli producing area's current output.
 Most of the remaining reserves are in mature oilfields
 that are increasingly difficult to exploit. Daqing oil-
 field, which produces half of the country's oil, is the
 most critical. Over its 24-year production history, it
 has withdrawn about 650 million of the 1.3 billion
 tons that Beijing hopes ultimately to recover. Output
 has been held steady at 50 million tons (1 million b/d)
 for the past six years by massive waterflooding of the
 reservoirs. Oilfield administrators and the Minister of
 Petroleum, say the field will maintain this output rate
 until 1986 or 1987 before starting to decline.
 Analysis performed by Daqing Oilfield's Research
 and Planning Institute, published in a Chinese techni-
 cal journal in July 1983, indicates that waterflooding
 of the reservoirs had caused the share of water
 produced with the oil to reach 64 percent of total fluid
 production by 1981. This water-cut ratio is increasing
 by 3 percentage points a year and by the end of
 1985-the last year of the Institute's projection-is
 projected to reach 75 percent if oil output is to be
 maintained at the 50-million-ton-per-year level. Fig-
 ure 4 includes the Institute's projections for water and
 oil production through 1985. We have extrapolated it

 to show the accelerating volume of water that must be
 injected and processed if the current volume of output
 is to be maintained through 1988. Clearly, at some
 point, the accelerating costs associated with handling
 this geometrically increasing volume of water will
 cause the oilfield to abandon the goal of level produc-
 tion. After that, it appears that the field will face a
 rapid decline in production.'
 Other major fields, particularly those in the Shengli
 producing area, are in similar stages of production
 (see table 3). Nationwide, production from existing

 wells is declining at an annual rate of about 10 million
 tons (200,000 b/d) or 10 percent of production. This
 has been offset by drilling 2,000 new production wells
 a year, at a cost of 1 billion yuan, and by increasing
 water injection. This massive effort has come at the
 expense of some exploratory drilling and is a major
 reason for Beijing's increasing willingness to enlist the
 help of Western oil firms for secondary and tertiary
 production technology.
 Natural Gas-Unknown Potential
 Natural gas production has dropped by 17 percent
 since 1979, and, like oil, the industry faces cloudy
 prospects because of limited proved reserves. Official
 data are not available, but unofficial Chinese sources
 placed reserves at about 180 billion cubic meters in
 1981. The World Bank, on the other hand, estimates
 that in 1981 China had proved gas reserves of 131.5
 billion cubic meters including 58 billion cubic meters
 of associated gas found in oilfields and 73.5 billion
 cubic meters of nonassociated gas. This is enough gas
 for only 11 years at current production rates.
 About 45 percent of China's gas is produced from
 gasfields in Sichuan Province. Many of these are
 having severe difficulties maintaining current produc-
 tion rates. US firms have been invited into Sichuan to

 Electric Power Supply-Increasing Shortages
 China's economic planners admit that electricity con-
 sumption in the long term must increase at close to if
 not even faster than the overall economic growth rate.
 Over the past three decades, electricity consumption
 in China has risen twice as fast as industrial growth.
 China's broad goals for "modernizing" the country
 thus include a guadrupling of electric power availabil-
 ity by the year 2000-an annual growth rate of more
 than 7 percent. This represents a massive challenge
 for the industry but not necessarily an impossible one.'
 typically highly faulted basins. Others believe there is
 a great deal of gas potential, particularly at extreme
 depths, but that Chinese drilling technology is not
 sophisticated enough to find it.
 These differing views make it difficult to predict gas
 production even in the short term. A gradual increase
 appears reasonable because of new imported technol-
 ogy. Several significant gas discoveries since 1980
 have already allowed a small turnaround in gas
 production this year. The most important onshore find
 is in the Zhongyuan area that the World Bank is
 helping to develop. Gas resources in Zhongyuan's
 eight identified oil and gas fields might total as much
 as 36 billion cubic meters. Output in 1983 was
 probably about 300 million cubic meters, accounting
 for most of the gain nationwide. By 1985 the area is to
 produce 500 million cubic meters a year.
 Gas discoveries have also recently been made offshore
 in the Bohai, the East China Sea, and in the Yingge-
 hai Basin south of Hainan Island. The Yinggehai
 discovery, made by Atlantic Richfield in its conces-
 sion area, is particularly promising.
 Many other structures in the Yinggehai Basin-
 which geologists believe is one of the few gas-prone
 rather than oil-prone offshore basins-remain to be
 drilled.
 Offshore gas, particularly when it is not associated
 with oil, however, is very expensive to develop.
 it will cost a minimum of $89
 China, however, has two major disadvantages that we
 believe will prevent it from raising capacity by any-
 thing more than 5 percent per year for the indefinite
 future. First is the limited availability of domestic
 capital and high worldwide interest rates if China
 should decide to borrow capital. Second, limited
 supplies of oil and gas and much higher costs for
 nuclear power plants are forcing China's power devel-
 opment to be rather narrowly focused on coal-fired
 thermal and hydroelectric power plants.'
 Slowdown in Capacity Expansion. In the 1970s,
 electric power output in China increased at an 11-
 percent annual rate, reaching 300 billion kilowatt-
 hours (kWh) by 1980. Generating capacity rose by 11
 ' Chinese economists point out that the United States, from an
 electric power base in 1947 that was equivalent to China's current
 base, quadrupled power output and capacity by 1965. The Soviet
 Union accomplished a similar expansion in only 15 years in the
 1960s and 1970s. China, moreover, can take advantage of the
 important technological improvements in power technology-par-
 ticularly in the use of larger turbine/generator units-that have

 percent per year to reach 66,000 megawatts (MW) in
 1980, sixth largest in the world. Beijing's modest
 Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) called for an increase
 of 12,900 MW of generating capacity by 1985, which
 would represent a capacity growth rate of only 3.6
 percent per year, only one-third the rate of increase in
 the 1970s. This figure probably does not include
 increased capacity from small hydroelectric plants
 that are built by villages and are not tied into
 Ministry of Electric Power grids. If these are includ-
 ed, an estimated 2,000 MW should be added to the
 five-year plan targets for a total of 14,900 MW, and
 the growth rate raised to a 4.2-percent annual rate
 Actual expansion in 1981 and 1982, including small-
 scale hydro, was 3,400 MW and 3,100 MW, respec-
 tively-generally in line with the Five-Year Plan. The
 1983 plan called for a 3,180-MW increase in large-
 and medium-sized plants, which combined with an
 estimated 400-MW increase in small-scale plants,
 would increase total capacity to about 76,000 MW,
 an increase of 5.2 percent. Including small-scale
 hydro, the balance remaining under the Five-Year
 Plan would be only about 2,500 MW of new capacity
 each year in 1984 and 1985-an annual increase of
 These increases are much smaller than the peak
 additions of 5,048 MW and 5,900 MW in 1978 and
 1979, respectively. The slowdown can be directly
 attributed to cutbacks in electric power investment as
 Beijing has tried to control its investment budget. As
 table 2 indicates, investment in the industry was
 slashed by 20 percent in 1981 with only partial
 recovery in 1982. Investment in electric power in-
 creased sharply in 1983, far above the Sixth Five-
 Year Plan allocations.
 Despite the slowdown in the growth of generating
 capacity, power output growth has slackened only
 slightly. Output increased by only 2.9 percent in 1981,
 when industry was depressed, but achieved a steady
 increase of about 7 percent each year in 1982 and
 1983. Capacity utilization, particularly for hydroelec-
 tric facilities, has grown very fast, removing a cushion
 that had developed in the 1970s. Power demanded by
 a rapidly growing industrial sector may now be
 raising capacity utilization to unsustainable levels. If
 so, and if capacity increases in 1984 and 1985 are no
 only about 3 percent.

 more than the current Five-Year Plan suggests, annu-
 al increases of power output may slump to 3 percent
 per year, a severe limitation on an industrial sector
 already starving for electricity.
 Longer term prospects are somewhat better, provided
 Beijing is willing to increase steadily its budget
 allocations. China now has approximately 23,000
 MW of capacity under construction that is slated to
 come on line after 1986. We estimate that about
 22,000 MW of net new capacity will be commissioned
 during 1986-90; this estimate allows for new projects
 that will be started in the next few years, for retire-
 ment of some existing plants, and for a carryover of
 several thousand megawatts of hydropower capacity
 that will not be completed by then. This is an annual
 growth rate of about 5 percent.
 Thermal Power. Thermal power plants account for
 approximately 52,000 MW or 70 percent of China's
 power capacity and contribute 77 percent of power
 output. They include an estimated 43,000 MW of
 coal-fired and 7,000 MW of oil-fired plants. Relative
 to power industries in other countries, China's indus-
 try is characterized by hundreds of small plants that
 use inefficient 50-, 100-, and 200-MW turbine/gener-
 ator units. Even in the current Sixth Five-Year Plan
 period, most new plants are installing only 200-MW
 The lack of larger scale generators reflects the inabil-
 ity of China's machine-building industry to produce
 large numbers of more efficient 300-MW turbine/
 generator units. After more than a decade of develop-
 ment, only five indigenously developed 300-MW units
 are in operation. In any case, China's transmission
 system has been unable to handle large loads.F___-]
 Both of these conditions are now changing rapidly as
 China imports needed technology from the West. In
 1978, Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering
 signed contracts making available to China 300- and,
 eventually, 600-MW turbine/generator technologies
 that are already beginning to have an impact. We
 expect these units will form the basis for capacity
 expansion in the industry in the late 1980s and in the
 1990s. China is also rapidly expanding its 500-kilovolt
 (kV) transmission capabilities with some imported
 These efforts are particularly important in developing
 large power plants at mine locations that we think
 offer China the best chance of keeping up with its
 power needs. These plants not only alleviate the need
 for transporting coal, they can be located in rural
 areas and will not contribute to already major pollu-
 tion problems in China's cities. Currently, only 15
 percent-6,880 MW--of China's coal-fired plants are
 located at mine mouths. At least 9,000 MW of new
 mine-mouth capacity is now under construction or is
 in advanced planning stages.
 Hydroelectric Power. China has developed only a tiny
 share of what is generally accepted as the world's
 greatest hydroelectric power potential. Hydroelectric
 generating capacity now totals about 24,000 MW, of
 which 8,000 MW are small-scale rural plants not tied
 into any grid systems. Hydroelectric output totaled
 74.4 billion kWh in 1982, 23 percent of total power
 output. Hydro's 13-percent increase over 1981 was
 the only reason the Ministry of Electric Power met its
 annual goals; thermal plants missed their target as a
 result of a fuel shortage. Hydroelectric output did
 even better in 1983 with production through Novem-
 ber up 18.6 percent over the same period in 1982. F_
 Several major hydroelectric projects have been com-
 pleted since 1979 and have provided a major boost to
 output. These include the 965-MW first stage of
 Gezhouba, the first dam constructed on the Chang
 Jiang; 300-MW of the first stage of Baishan, located
 in Manchuria; and the 630-MW Wujiangdu project
 in Guizhou. Another factor behind the surge in
 hydroelectric output is heavy rainfall over the past
 two years that has allowed a surge in production,
 especially from small-scale plants that are heavily
 dependent on timely rainfall. Output from these
 plants was up 34 percent in the first three quarters of
 Beijing, in keeping with its goal to quadruple electric-
 ity supply by the year 2000, has ambitious goals for
 the hydro sector. According to figures published in a
 Ministry of Electric Power journal, hydrocapacity will
 increase by 4,000 MW between 1980 and 1985 (most
 of this has already been achieved); by 9,000 to 10,000
 equipment.

 MW in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90); by
 12,000 to 16,000 MW between 1991 and 1995; and
 an astonishing 11,000 to 20,000 MW between 1996
 and 2000. Included in these plans for the 20 years
 (1981-2000) are 12,000 MW of additional hydropower
 from small plants and 28,000 to 38,000 MW from
 medium and large plants. This is an annual growth
 rate of about 5 percent in the 1980s, accelerating to
 more than 6 percent in the 1990s
 We believe achievement of these goals is highly
 unlikely. Currently, 27 large- and medium-sized pow-
 er plants with designed capacity totaling more than
 12,000 MW are under construction; most have only
 recently been started and will not produce electricity
 until the late 1980s and early 1990s. With a minimum
 of 12 years required to construct a hydroelectric plant,
 the 1990 and 1995 targets already seem out of reach.
 Some Chinese economists, moreover, appear to be
 questioning the advisability of heavy emphasis on
 long-term, capital-intensive hydroelectric projects
 when power shortages are a daily phenomenon. Major
 criticism has been focused on the large numbers of
 people displaced by manmade lakes-one major proj-
 ect now on hold, the Three Gorges dam on the Chang
 Jiang, would generate 25,000 MW of power but
 would require advanced technology and the relocation
 of 1.2 million people. There is also considerable
 criticism of small-scale hydroplants, for their high per
 unit capital costs and for unreliable service.
 Under these circumstances, we believe China will do
 well to sustain an increase of 4 percent per year in
 hydro capacity through the 1990s. This estimate,
 based on an assumption that all existing projects will
 be completed by 1995 and that the rate of increase
 from small-scale hydro will remain flat at 400 MW
 per year, would bring capacity up to about 30,000
 MW by 1990 and close to 37,000 MW by 1995.
 Output growth may be slightly more rapid as more
 integrated grid systems lead to higher utilization
 rates.
 Nuclear Power. China has been actively considering
 the development of nuclear power since at least 1970
 but thus far has made little progress. One small (300
 MW) domestically designed plant is in an initial stage
 of construction near Shanghai with a completion
 target of 1988. The Ministry of Water Resources and
 Electric Power (MWREP) has also negotiated with
 Western firms for two 1,800-MW turnkey plants, one
 for Guangdong Province that would share power with
 a Hong Kong utility, and a second plant near Shang-
 hai. The Guangdong plant has received State Council
 approval, and, if MWREP can settle with the French
 firm, Framatome, construction could begin within a
 year. Framatome has signed a preliminary agreement,
 but China continues to state it prefers a US supplier if
 US nonproliferation concerns are worked out. The
 plant could not be complete until the early 1990s
 when it will supply only about 1 percent of the
 nation's power.
 These plants will give China practical experience with
 a technology that some Chinese planners believe is the
 only solution to China's long-term energy require-
 ments. For the next 20 years, however, we believe-
 and official Chinese plans reflect-that nuclear power
 will be too capital intensive and too expensive an
 energy source for China to depend on. Some estimates

 for the Guangdong plant, for instance, range as high
 as $5 billion, more than five times the cost of an
 equivalent coal-fired plant.
 Beijing last year cut its plans to have 20,000 MW of
 nuclear capacity onstream by 2000 by half. This new
 10,000-MW target appears feasible and is one that
 will still offer substantial sales of Western technology
 and equipment. However, it will contribute only about
 6 percent of the nation's electric power output and
 about 1 percent of total energy supply at the end of
 the century; the investment required will probably
 total more than $20 billion in 1982 dollars.
 China's Demand for Energy
 China has slowed the rate of increase in energy
 consumption in the last five years. Unlike in many
 Western economies, this conservation has taken place
 in a period of fairly rapid economic growth. Energy
 consumption in China increased at an annual rate of
 1.9 percent from 1978 through 1982 while national
 income increased at a 6.2-percent rate. This energy
 elasticity of national income of 0.30 is in sharp
 contrast to an elasticity of 1.47 for the Chinese
 Figure 6

 Growth, 1970-1983
 Index: 1970= 100
 350
 economy from 1965 to 1978 (see figure 6).
 Most observers, in China or in the West, doubt this
 low elasticity can be maintained. Much of the im-
 proved energy use between 1978 and 1982 has been
 the result of economic restructuring caused by rapid
 growth in energy-efficient light industry and agricul-
 ture and very slow growth in energy-intensive heavy
 industry. Beijing officially attributes two-thirds of the
 energy savings to structural change and only one-third
 to conservation. This suggests that, had the structural,
 change not occurred, energy consumption would have
 been 12 percent higher in 1982-76 MTCE energy-
 twice the level of energy exports in that year.F__~
 intermediate goods required for producing light indus-
 trial goods and cannot continue to lag light industry
 indefinitely. If efficiency gains continue along recent
 trends, this balanced growth would suggest an elastic-
 ity close to 0.75, which is not consistent with Beijing's
 planned 0.50. It would imply that if energy supplies
 double by the year 2000 as planned the overall
 economy could increase at a rate of only 4.8 percent
 per year, not the planned annual rate of 7.2 percent.
 The separation of structural change from a more
 narrowly defined efficiency gain-that is, reduced
 energy consumption for production of a given prod-
 uct-is important in forecasting China's future de-
 mand for energy because Beijing's plans call for more
 or less balanced growth between heavy industry and
 light industry and somewhat slower growth for agri-
 culture. Heavy industry provides the investment and
 Although these broad elasticity statistics are useful in
 providing a general idea of China's energy problem,
 they can be misleading on two accounts. First, there
 can be considerable structural change within these

 Secret
 broad sectors that can have a strong but, without
 careful study, ambiguous impact on energy demand.
 Second, they do not differentiate between types of
 energy. Oil, coal, and electric power output are not
 likely to increase at the same rate nor can we assume
 that demand for these energy sources will increase at
 the same rate. To the extent that these fuels cannot be
 readily substituted for each other, bottlenecks will
 occur as a result of a shortage of one fuel, even though
 in more aggregate terms the country might have
 plenty of energy.
 To improve our ability to analyze China's energy
 demand, we have disaggregated China's energy con-
 sumption by energy type and energy-consuming in-
 dustry as shown in tables 7 and 8. The 1978 data are
 taken largely from a Chinese publication, which,
 although not official, appears to contain offical data
 we have not seen published elsewhere. No similar
 source is available for 1982; hence, we have had to
 include a mixture of official data, where they are
 available, and our own estimates. In table 8, where we
 have no basis for making an estimate, we have used
 "NA." Electrical energy consumption by industry is
 treated as an intermediate product and is not included
 in the table. The distribution of electric power con-
 sumption can be found in table 12, page 27.
 China's Demand for Coal
 China's demand for raw coal reached 637 million tons
 in 1982, up from 565 million tons in 1978-an annual
 rate of increase of about 3 percent. In terms of
 standard coal equivalent, these figures are 454 million
 tons and 404 million tons, respectively. In 1981 when
 China's heavy industrial output slumped, coal con-
 sumption actually declined but rebounded strongly in
 1982 with a 5.2-percent increase. Preliminary data
 indicate that coal consumption may have increased
 even faster in 1983, possibly more than 6 percent. The
 resurgence in coal demand results largely from two
 factors: resumption of rapid growth in heavy industry
 and sharp rises in retail sales of coal to households
 and local industries as economic reforms have re-
 moved some restrictions on the private mining and
 selling of coal.
 Industrial Demand. The five industries discussed
 below-electric power, iron and steel, synthetic am-
 monia, building materials, and railroads-accounted
 for 45 percent of China's coal consumption in both
 1978 and in 1982. We estimate that, consistent with a
 5-percent annual growth rate in the value of produc-
 tion for the group as a whole, their coal consumption
 will increase at annual rates of about 3.6 percent in
 the 1980s and 2.5 percent in the 1990s (see table 9).
 The apparent improvement in the rate of efficiency
 gain in the 1990s is actually the result of structural
 change in the use of energy. In the 1980s, coal will be
 substituting for oil in the generation of electric power;
 in the 1990s, nuclear power will be substituted for
 some coal. If this group of industries remains repre-
 sentative of Chinese industry in general, industrial
 consumption of coal will rise to 686 million tons a
 year by 1990 and 880 million tons by the year 2000.
 The electric power industry is China's largest indus-
 trial consumer of coal, accounting for about 140
 million tons or 22 percent of the nation's total demand
 in 1982. Power plants have increased coal consump-
 tion by approximately 5 percent a year over the past
 five years, slightly faster than the output of thermal
 electricity because of the gradual conversion of oil-
 fired plants to coal. Despite the high priority in fuel
 allocations given to the electric power sector, the lack
 of coal on occasion has constrained electricity supply.
 This was particularly true in 1981 when thermal
 power plants were unable to meet their annual targets
 because of a lack of fuel.
 Over the past three decades, the power industry has
 steadily improved the efficiency with which it burns
 coal. Coal consumption per kilowatt-hour has dropped
 from 700 grams in 1949 to 400 grams in 1983, an
 average gain in efficiency of about 1.7 percent per
 year. This gain has leveled off to about 1 percent per
 year recently, a rate of improvement that, according
 to articles in Chinese electric power journals, Beijing
 hopes to maintain through the 1990s. Large-scale
 production and installation of more efficient 300-MW
 and 600-MW turbines and generators in new plants
 should make this efficiency gain possible.

 We calculate that, if China succeeded in quadrupling
 power output by the year 2000, even assuming real-
 ization of hydroelectric and nuclear power plans, coal
 consumption would rise to about 450 million tons a
 year, despite improved efficiency. This would repre-
 sent a doubling of the power sector's share of coal
 consumption-to about 40 percent and a rate of
 growth of 6.7 percent per year, which we believe is
 highly unlikely. If, on the other hand, thermal power
 capacity rises at the rate of between 4 and 5 percent
 per year that we project (see electric power supply
 section, page 12), the power sector's demand for coal
 will increase by a more manageable 3- to 4-percent
 rate
 The iron and steel industry is China's second-largest
 industrial consumer of coal. In 1978 it consumed
 about 76 million tons of raw coal, 13 percent of the
 nation's total. Consumption declined to less than 68
 million tons in 1981 despite a 12-percent increase in
 steel output. This represents a total efficiency gain of
 25 percent in the three-year period-from 2.0 tons of
 coal per ton of steel in 1978 to 1.6 tons of coal in

 of pig iron in making steel saved considerable energy.
 In 1982 and 1983 the efficiency gains have been much
 less-probably about 1.5 percent per year, because of
 fewer plant closings.
 The steel industry will continue to offer China one of
 its best opportunities for saving coal. With only
 modest goals for steel production and large efficiency
 gains still available-particularly through the use of
 modern integrated mills such as the Baoshan steel
 mill now under construction-we believe the indus-
 try's coal consumption need increase only by about 1
 percent per year through the end of the century. F_
 China's chemical sector also offers substantial coal
 savings. In 1978, chemicals consumed 49 million tons
 of coal-9 percent of the nation's total-28 million
 tons of which were used as feedstock for synthetic
 ammonia. By 1982, we estimate coal consumption in
 the chemical sector had risen to about 57 million tons,
 including about 34 million tons in making synthetic
 ammonia. Growth targets for the chemical industry
 show that fairly rapid expansion is planned through
 the rest of the century, but we believe much of the
 increased energy demand will be met by petroleum

 rather than coal. Chemical use of coal will probably
 increase at a rate of only 1 or 2 percent annually,
 again making substantial amounts of coal available
 for use in other sectors.
 Building materials, particularly cement, are likely to
 take up some of these savings. We estimate that the
 cement industry consumed 22 million tons of coal in
 1982. Rapid expansion of the industry-much of it in
 relatively inefficient small plants-will probably in-
 crease its coal consumption at a rate close to 8 percent
 per year through the 1980s, and perhaps a 5 percent
 per year annual rate of increase in the 1990s. F_
 China and India are the only major countries that
 continue to use steam locomotives as the primary
 power source for their railroads. About 75 percent of
 China's freight is pulled by steam locomotives. These
 locomotives consumed 25 million tons of coal in 1978
 and an estimated 29 million tons in 1982. Efficiency
 gains by steam locomotives have lagged in recent
 years. Coal consumption per ton-kilometer of freight
 actually increased slightly in 1982

 China's railroad sector over the past decade has been
 unable to keep up with economic growth. Freight
 movements, as measured in ton-kilometers, increased
 by only a little more than 4 percent per year. The
 resulting bottlenecks have been particularly trouble-
 some for coal transport and are causing Beijing to
 reconsider its dependence on steam locomotion. Ulti-
 mately, we believe China will be forced to move
 toward diesel and electric locomotion. The reasons, as

 Secret
 expressed in Chinese energy and transportation jour-
 nals, are the efficiencies of energy and capital that
 diesel and electric offer. The changeover will be
 gradual-70 percent of locomotive production is still
 steam engines, which typically last 30 years. The
 Chinese press, however, has speculated that China's
 single remaining steam locomotive plant-the largest
 in the world-will change to diesel electric production
 sometime in this decade.
 Household Demand. Retail sales of coal reached
 approximately 150 million tons in 1982, up sharply
 from only 100 million tons in 1978. This 10-percent-a-
 year increase has been a major stimulus to coal
 production by locally owned coal mines, which in
 1982 increased output by 20 million tons-an increase
 of 15 percent. In 1978, almost all retail sales of coal
 went for household consumption, at least according to
 one Chinese publication, which gave figures of 60.98
 and 39.65 million tons for urban and rural household
 consumption, respectively, in that year. Liberalization
 of controls on the private mining and selling of coal
 and the proliferation of private and collectively owned
 industry since 1978, however, suggest that only a
 portion of the increased sales went toward household
 consumption. We estimate households increased con-
 sumption of coal by 5 percent per year over the period,
 the same rate that was officially reported for 1979.
 This brings household consumption to 122 million
 tons in 1982 (see table 9).
 Coal still provides only about a fourth of the energy
 used in China for heating and cooking-plant materi-
 als including firewood and crop stalks provide almost
 all of the rest. The effort required for peasants to
 gather these materials and the extensive ecological
 damage caused are now often cited among rural
 China's most pressing problems.
 Under these circumstances-and with the relatively
 cheap price of coal-household demand for coal is
 practically inexhaustible. The central government can
 attempt to control this demand by refusing to sell coal
 produced in state-owned mines for local use. The
 Ministry of Coal, however, plans to increase produc-
 tion from locally owned coal mines-which now pro-
 vide most of the rural household coal supply-by only
 about 2 percent per year through the year 2000, a rate
 of increase that is very unlikely to satisfy rural
 household demand. We estimate that, at a minimum,
 the state will have to allow household coal consump-
 tion to increase at the same rate as the economy as a
 whole, particularly given its concern over the "quali-
 ty" of economic growth and the improvement in living
 standards. To provide this coal, Beijing either will
 have to allow local mines to increase output at a much
 higher rate than the planned 2 percent per year--at
 considerable investment cost and at the risk of some
 damage to coal reserves-or will have to begin selling
 state coal to rural household customers.
 Implications. As illustrated in table 9, the above
 analysis suggests that demand for coal will increase
 by about 3.9 percent per year through 1990 and about
 3.1 percent per year in the 1990s-presuming an
 economic growth of 5 percent per year. Total demand,
 including losses, would thus reach about 900 million
 tons in 1990 and 1,200 million tons in 2000. The 1990
 consumption estimate helps explain the boost Beijing
 gave in 1982 to its 1990 coal production target. The
 new target of 940 million tons would allow China to
 surpass its export goal of about 20 million tons. The
 original 850-million-ton target would have left a
 shortfall of about 50 million tons.
 The Wen Wei Bao projection of 900 million tons of
 coal output in 1990, which is 100 million tons greater
 than that predicted by the Shanghai World Economic
 Herald and which we believe is about the maximum
 attainable, would just meet this demand projection
 and leave no room for exports. Beijing would probably
 squeeze out some exports anyway to meet commit-
 ments to Western and Japanese joint venture part-
 ners.
 Given our assumptions of less substitution of coal for
 oil in the 1990s and the emergence of nuclear power,
 the longer term outlook is considerably better. Our
 estimate of 1,200 million tons of coal demand in 2000
 would allow a significant boost in coal exports if the
 official production target is reached. Even in the
 1990s, however, economic growth faster than 5 per-
 cent would quickly result in a strain on coal supplies.

 Demand for Petroleum
 China's annual oil consumption declined by 11 per-
 cent-10 million tons-between 1978 and 1982, a
 remarkable achievement given the country's substan-
 tial increase in industrial and agricultural output.
 Despite a 2-million-ton decline in oil output, Beijing
 was able to boost annual exports by 7 million tons to
 take full advantage of the 1979 jump in oil prices. The
 value of oil exports thus rose from little more than $1
 billion in 1978 to about $5 billion in 1982, an
 important element in China's greatly improved inter-
 Table 10
 China: Petroleum Product Output
 national financial situation.
 The decline in consumption was made possible by
 shifting from oil to coal in many boiler and furnace
 operations and by Beijing's extraordinary control over
 the disposition of petroleum products. Consumption of
 gasoline and diesel fuel actually declined despite a 40-
 percent increase in the stock of motor vehicles 'and
 tractors. Although forcing some improvement in the
 efficiency of fuel use, Beijing's policies have greatly
 reduced the utilization rate of motorized vehicles and
 machinery.
 We believe that, although savings still can be made in
 China's oil consumption habits, the easiest gains have
 been made and that Beijing will be forced to allow a
 gradual increase in consumption. An upward trend
 may in fact have already begun. Preliminary produc-
 tion and export statistics suggest that consumption in
 1983 may have increased by as much as 5 percent. By
 our calculations-as follow in a sector-by-sector anal-
 ysis-if the economy is to grow at a 5-percent annual
 rate, a minimum 2-percent annual gain in consump-
 tion will be required to meet the needs of the consum-
 ing sectors. We thus calculate an elasticity for oil
 consumption at about 0.5. Oil consumption will then
 reach just under 100 million tons per year by 1990. If
 our output projections are correct, China would have
 to eliminate almost all crude oil and product exports
 by that time.
 Product Structure. China's crude oil and petroleum
 product structure is included in table 10. In 1982,
 China refined only 72 million tons of the 99 million
 tons available after oilfield use and losses. This was
 down about 3 million tons from the 1980 peak.

 Approximately half of the remaining crude oil was
 exported; the rest was burned directly in electric
 power plants and other large boiler or furnace opera-
 tions.
 China's refineries yield an unusually heavy and low-
 value range of products because of rather heavy crude
 oil varieties and inadequate cracking facilities in the
 refineries. Output of high-value light products-gaso-
 line, kerosene, diesel fuel, lubricants, and naphtha
 amounted to only about 36 million tons in 1982, about
 half of refinery throughput. Fuel oil production and
 fuel consumed by refineries themselves accounted for
 most of the balanceJ
 Industrial Fuel Oil Consumption. Beijing's primary
 effort to reduce oil consumption has been to cut back
 sharply the direct burning of crude and fuel oil in
 power plants and industrial boilers and furnaces. In
 1980 the country burned 40 million tons in these
 operations, about 12 million tons of crude oil and 28
 million tons of fuel oil. This was particularly wasteful
 of the crude oil that could have been distilled and
 cracked into a higher value range of products.

 In 1981 and 1982 the State Council imposed strict
 regulations on such waste-including a tax of 40 to 50
 yuan per ton on fuel oil-and by 1982 oil burning had
 declined to 35 million tons. Beijing has called for an
 annual reduction of 2 million tons per year through
 1990 in the direct burning of petroleum in order to
 reduce the waste of crude oil to 20 million tons. The
 high cost of converting units to coal-1.6 billion yuan
 were spent in 1981 and 1982 alone-and slower-than-
 planned conversion of power plants thus far suggests
 that China will do well to reduce crude and fuel oil
 consumption to 25 million tons by 1990.
 Coal-fired electric power plants have always dominat-
 ed China's power industry, but in the late 1960s
 through the mid-1970s China constructed large num-
 bers of oil-fired stations and converted dozens of coal-
 fired units to oil to take advantage of the country's
 booming oil production. This was particularly true in
 the Shanghai area and in the industrial northeast

 provinces where transportation and environmental
 conditions discouraged the use of coal. By 1978 the
 country had a total of 12,000 MW of oil-fired capaci-
 ty-21 percent of total power capacity--that con-
 sumed 18.3 million tons of crude and fuel oil and
 about 500,000 tons of diesel fuel.
 With prospects deteriorating for oil production, Beij-
 ing after 1978 began to focus on conversion and
 reconversion of these plants to coal. Just over 4,100
 MW of capacity were planned for conversion by 1985
 Approved For Release 2009/02/20: CIA-RDP85TOO31 OR0001 00050007-4
 Approved For Release 2009/02/20: CIA-RDP85T00310R000100050007-4
 for a general savings of more than 8 million tons; most
 of this capacity had probably been coal fired original-
 ly and thus much easier to convert. By the end of
 1981, 2,000 MW had been converted and annual oil
 consumption had dropped by 4 million tons. However,
 the rate of conversion has slowed as easier units were
 completed first, and in 1981 only 340 MW were
 converted. No figures are available for 1982 and
 1983, but if the conversion program continued at the
 1981 rate it would not be complete until 1988. We
 calculate that oil consumption in the power sector will
 decline by about 800,000 tons each year through 1988
 and then will flatten out at about 9 million tons of fuel
 oil and about 750,000 tons of diesel oil.
 Metallurgy, chemicals, and light industry-particu-
 larly the papermaking industry-account for most of
 the remaining fuel oil consumption. Beijing plans to
 reduce oil burning by these industries by about 1
 million tons a year through 1990-a 5-percent decline
 in 1983 rising to a 10-percent rate of decline by 1990.
 Fuel consumption in these industries declined by 3
 million tons in 1981 and 1982, but we do not believe
 this success can be sustained. The easiest savings have
 already been accomplished. In the steel industry, for
 instance, heavy oil is no longer mixed with coking coal
 for blast furnace operations. Most of the remaining oil
 is consumed in rolling operations that will be much
 more difficult, if not impossible, to convert to coal.
 New plants, moreover, will need to burn some oil.
 Baoshan steel mill, for instance, will require 300,000
 tons of fuel oil annually when second-stage operations
 begin in 1988. Chemical industries can probably still
 make significant efficiency gains, but light industrial
 use of fuel oil may increase with the burgeoning
 demand for light industrial products.
 Petrochemical Feedstocks. China's discussions con-
 cerning the optimal use of its oil focus on the need to
 rapidly increase the share processed into high-value
 fertilizers and petrochemical products. These are cur-
 rently large import items that are particularly impor-
 tant in US-Chinese trade. Only about 5 million tons
 of oil, largely diesel fuel and naphtha, were used for
 these purposes in 1982, up from about 3 million tons
 in 1978.
 this demand will rise to about 16
 million tons by 1990 and perhaps to as much as 30
 million tons by 2000
 Three large ethylene plants are currently under con-
 struction that when operational-probably by the end
 of 1986-will consume 4 million tons of crude oil
 annually to provide materials for synthetic fiber and
 plastics production. We also anticipate a rapid in-
 crease in the production of synthetic ammonia using
 residual fuel as the primary feedstock-a shift away
 from coal-derived feedstock technology that consumes
 large amounts of electricity.
 Demand for Light Petroleum Products. China's out-
 put of light products-excluding naphtha, which is
 either used as petrochemical feedstock or exported-
 has remained steady at about 35 million tons annually
 since 1978. Exports of these products more than
 doubled to 5.3 million tons between 1978 and 1982,
 however, so that products available for domestic
 consumption declined by 7 percent (2.5 million tons).
 The largest decline came in the supply of diesel fuel-
 from 18.3 million tons to 17.5 million tons. Ample
 reporting indicates that diesel is now the fuel in
 shortest supply. Gasoline output increased from 9.9
 million tons to 11.1 million tons in the same period,
 but all of the increase went to exports-most of it to
 the United States. Domestic consumption of gasoline
 has held steady at about 9.7 million tons a year
 Agricultural Demand. Consumption of light petro-
 leum products by the agricultural sector totaled 10.4
 million tons in 1978, including about 8 million tons of
 diesel fuel and 2 million tons of gasoline-46 percent
 and 20 percent of total demand for these products.
 Chinese sources state that agricultural use of these
 products declined through 1982, although no specific
 statistics are available.
 This decline in petroleum consumption has little to do
 with improved efficiency of farm machinery nor does
 it reflect a reduction in demand for these products.
 The stock of agricultural machinery-particularly

 Secret
 tractors and irrigation pumps-increased approxi-
 mately 40 percent (measured by total horsepower in
 use) between 1978 and 1982, and peasant demand is
 nowhere near satisfied. Chinese journals and newspa-
 pers increasingly carry complaints that the peasants
 are not getting maximum use out of new machinery
 because of fuel shortages. One author in Guangming
 Ribao, for instance, complains that agricultural
 "modernization" is impossible given the shortage of
 fuels. The result, as shown in official statistics, is a
 slowdown, even to the point of a reversal, in farm
 mechanization and powered irrigation. We believe
 that Beijing will soon have to allow an increase in
 agricultural fuel supplies-perhaps by about 5 per-
 cent annually.
 Transportation Demand. China's transportation sec-
 tor consumed approximately 12 million tons of petro-
 leum products in 1982, including 7.5 million tons of
 gasoline and about 3.5 million tons of diesel fuel.' We
 estimate that fuel consumption has increased by about
 3 percent per year since 1978; annual efficiency gains
 of 3.6 percent in the use of gasoline and 2.6 percent in
 the use of diesel fuel have allowed a 6-percent annual
 rate of increase in total freight carried.
 These efficiency gains notwithstanding, Chinese
 transportation continues to face severe fuel shortages,
 largely the result of the government's determination
 to increase exports of these products. Nationwide, the
 annual allocation of gasoline and diesel fuel declined
 from 7.1 tons per truck (about 2,200 gallons) in 1979
 to only 4.5 tons in 1983. In 1981, in response to
 widening shortages, the State Council imposed strict
 quotas on the amount of fuel allocated per vehicle.
 Transport units in Fujian, for example, complained
 they were given three-month quotas of 800 liters of
 gasoline (210 gallons), enough for only 20 days of
 normal operations. In addition, provinces were told to
 mothball about 10 percent of their motor vehicles.
 The program had an impact; Liaoning and Xizang
 Provinces alone mothballed 10,000 and 1,600 trucks,
 respectively. These measures reflect Beijing's intense

 estimated because Chinese official data refer only to Ministry of
 Communication and Transportation activities, which include only
 China's Automotive Fuel Consumption
 The lowly position of the automobile in China illus-
 trates both the severe limits to reducing discretionary
 fuel consumption in China and the potential for
 unbounded growth in fuel consumption if the econo-
 my were to develop rapidly and without constraints.
 China's stock of automobiles, 267,000 in 1982, is
 approximately the same as that of the District of
 Columbia. It is only slightly larger than that of
 South Korea. Even with such few automobiles, Bei-
 jing imposes such severe quotas on fuel consump-
 tion-70 kilograms or 22 gallons a month-that
 Chinese taxis coast downhill whenever possible. Chi-    25X1

 focus on saving energy without, in our view, adequate
 attention to the very high economic costs of idling
 transport capacity.
 A Chinese economist, writing in a recent edition of
 Neng Yuan (Energy), calculates that transportation
 services in China must increase about 1.37 times the
 rate of increase of industrial and agricultural produc-
 tion. In recent years, transportation's relatively slower
 growth has caused major bottlenecks. We anticipate
 that, consistent with this analysis and with the current
 rate of increase in the stock of locomotives and motor
 vehicles, transportation services will increase at about
 7 percent per year.
 Efficiency gains are expected to continue at a 2- to 3-
 percent annual rate," but this will be offset by the
 railroads' increased consumption of diesel fuel as they
 gradually shift away from coal. On balance we esti-

 Military Consumption. We have no firm estimates of
 petroleum use by the military. Presumably such use is
 contained within the 6.1-million-ton "other" category
 in the 1978 consumption statistics. That figure, how-
 ever, also includes other government fuel consumption
 and a very small amount of fuel burned by urban
 households. Fuel production statistics can provide
 some further indications. Kerosene and jet fuel pro-
 duction in 1981, less exports and rural lighting con-
 sumption, for instance, leaves about 1.6 million tons
 unaccounted for, a good share of which probably was
 consumed by the Air Force

 Demand for Electric Power
 China consumed 350 billion kWh in 1983, up from
 257 billion in 1978. Power consumption rose by more
 than 7 percent in both 1982 and 1983, far above the
 annual planned increase, but still far short of demand.
 Despite the high priority being given to the power
 sector, in the short and medium term, we believe
 electricity shortages will be the most important
 energy-related impediment to economic growth. F_
 Electric power is one of, if not, the leading growth
 industries in China, having grown at an average
 annual rate of 12 percent over the past 25 years.
 Perhaps more so than in any other major country, this
 growth has served industrial consumers; households
 account for only about 5 percent of total consumption.
 Approximately 40 percent of China's population has
 no access to electricity, and the vast majority of those
 that do are allocated only enough power for very
 limited lighting. The World Bank estimates that the
 average Chinese household consumes only about 0.2
 kWh a day-even less electricity than households in
 India.
 Even with the high priority afforded industry, Vice
 Premier Li Peng has stated that industrial demand for
 electricity now exceeds power supply by about 50
 billion kWh. The Ministry of Water Resources and
 Electric Power and provincial authorities have very
 strong control mechanisms in place to allocate power
 in ways that generally prevent blackouts and brown-
 outs. These controls, however, exact a considerable
 economic cost, particularly in underutilized capital. In
 many regions, Chinese factories operate only four
 days a week to save power. Priority is given to light
 industry-particularly export-related plants-but
 even Western joint venture operations have been
 affected. The Chinese press complains that, nation-
 wide, industry operates 20 percent below capacity
 because of power shortages.
 The distribution of electricity consumption by sector
 and industry is shown in table 12 and in figure 9. We
 obtained these data from Chinese economic yearbooks
 and other published sources
 partial data are available for 1982.
 Industry, particularly heavy industry, dominates pow-
 er consumption, receiving about 75 percent of the net
 available power in 1982. The chemical and metallur-
 gical sectors are by far the most important consumers;
 each accounts for about 16 percent of national power
 consumption. Power consumption increased by only
 1.8 percent in metallurgy between 1978 and 1982, the
 result of intensive efforts to save electricity.
 Rural electricity consumption-much of it provided
 by small hydropower plants-has maintained a 14-
 percent annual rate of increase since 1978. A large
 share of the increase has gone to supply the booming
 rural enterprise sector and to increase electrically
 powered irrigation. Municipal power consumption-
 mostly for lighting and water pumping-has also
 increased rapidly.
 Prospects-Further Tightening. We believe, and most
 Chinese economists writing on the subject seem to
 agree, that national income over an extended length of
 time will not increase more rapidly than the available
 electric power supply.

 Over the past 25 years, power consumption has
 increased at more than twice the rate of increase of
 national income-an elasticity of 2.25-and 1.25
 times as fast as industrial output. Since 1978, these
 elasticities have improved to 1.0 and 0.86 for national
 income and industrial output, respectively, but this
 has been accompanied by more stringent controls and
 greater shortages. It has also been a period of much
 more rapid growth for light industry, which consumes
 less electricity per unit of value than does heavy
 industry. It is by no means clear that this relatively
 slow increase in industrial electricity consumption can
 be maintained, particularly as heavy industrial growth
 picks up. We expect that both capacity and fuel

 limitations will hold increases in electricity supply to
 at most 5 percent annually for the next decade.
 Output growth in 1984 and 1985, moreover, could be
 considerably below that rate. If this analysis proves
 correct, Beijing will have to slow the rate of increase
 of electric power consumption to less than that of
 national income if it is to come anywhere near its
 long-term growth targets.
 Table 13 gives some indication of the difficulty of
 China's task. Industry will have to provide the bulk of
 efficiency and structural gains. Yet, for the 24-year
 period between 1957 and 1981, in no single industry

 did electricity consumption increase more slowly than
 the gross value of output for that industry. In fact,
 only in the petroleum industry and in overall light
 industry-but not for subgroups such as textiles-did
 the value of output keep pace with electricity con-
 sumption.
 A more careful look at the prospects for electricity
 consumption in several key industries offers somewhat
 more hope. The chemical sector, particularly the
 synthetic ammonia industry, can cut back electricity
 consumption by shifting from coal-based to petro-
 chemical-based products. Similar improvements can
 probably be made in other chemical industries. The
 steel industry will probably increase its electricity
 consumption per unit of steel output, but, because of
 low growth targets for this large electricity user, the
 annual rate of increase in power consumption will
 probably be only 2 or 3 percent. The machine-
 building industry will also probably show only small

 Secret
 increases. These gains will be partially offset, how-
 ever, by the nonferrous metals industry, which will
 probably increase power consumption by 5 percent
 annually, and by expected continued sharp increases
 in small-scale local industrial output.
 A key problem will be supplying power to meet
 nonindustrial needs-particularly household con-
 sumption. Beijing is giving high priority to the pro-
 duction of goods that will improve the standard of
 living. The production of many of these goods-
 television sets, electric fans, washing machines, even
 small refrigerators-is giving a tremendous boost to
 the industrial production statistics and, because of the
 low electricity consumption per unit of output, is
 helping to lower the electric power elasticity of indus-
 trial output. These items are, however, causing a rapid
 increase in the demand for electricity in the commer-
 cial and household sectors. Between 1978 and 1982
 we estimate that nonindustrial consumption increased
 by 13 percent annually.
 So far, the problem has not been a major one because
 of the low base from which nonindustrial demand is
 rising. However, we anticipate this will be an increas-
 ing problem through the 1980s and perhaps a severe
 problem in the 1990s when electricity supply will be
 distributed more widely to the population. Beijing can
 limit the expansion of nonindustrial electrical con-
 sumption by fiat; but only at considerable cost to one
 of the fundamental goals of the modernization pro-
 gram-the improvement in living standards.
 Economic predictions concerning energy supply and
 demand in both market and nonmarket economies
 have frequently been off the mark over the past
 decade. The foregoing analysis of China's energy
 situation could also prove erroneous. Particularly in a
 state-controlled economy, however, where fixed prices
 do not force an equilibrium between supply and
 demand and where government policy is the key
 determinant of future production and consumption
 conditions, long-range planning is vitally important.
 Our analysis attempts to present China's energy
 situation in ways that we believe Chinese policymak-
 ers must look at the situation, so that we can better
 anticipate decisions that face Beijing.

 Table 14 summarizes our analysis of supply and          25X1
 demand for oil, coal, and electricity that we project if
 China has an annual 5-percent economic growth rate.
 No major gaps are evident, but there is a definite
 tightness in the energy balances that will probably
 require Beijing to make difficult decisions in allocat-
 ing energy supplies. These calculations also allow only
 a little room for energy exports-currently more than
 20 percent of China's foreign exchange earnings.
 Economic growth faster than 5 percent would, we  25X1
 believe, quickly cause serious energy shortages unless
 China was prepared to import substantial volumes of
 energy. If our energy elasticities of coal, oil, and

 Approved For Release 2009/02/20: CIA-RDP85TOO31 OR0001 00050007-4
 electric power demand-0.8, 0.5, and 1.0, respective-
 ly-are anywhere close to being accurate, a 7-percent
 annual rate of growth would require several adjust-
 ments:
 ? The elimination of oil exports even to the point of
 repurchasing-in effect importing-the offshore oil
 that the Western oil companigs expect to take out as
 their profit share.
 ? Resolving a 100-million-ton shortfall in annual coal
 supplies by 1990.
 ? Coping with a further 15- to 20-percent shortfall in
 electricity supplies.
 By the same token, long-term annual economic
 growth of only 3 or 4 percent would probably not run
 into an energy constraint. Energy exports could be
 kept at current levels and perhaps even increased. F
 Even with slower growth, however, Beijing's planners
 must prepare for the possibility that energy supplies,
 particularly oil, will not increase as fast as predicted.
 Chinese oil ouput predictions are based on the as-
 sumption that offshore oil will come onstream in time
 to offset and then surpass the anticipated decline in
 major onshore fields by the end of the decade. We
 believe, however, that Daqing, and perhaps other
 onshore fields, will start to decline before significant
 offshore production can begin. Of greater concern is
 the possibility-always present when exploring a new
 area-that China's offshore regions will not yield the
 large, highly productive fields necessary for commer-
 cial development.
 Beijing-Tough Choices Ahead
 Weakness in China's supply of energy has already
 forced Beijing to make major changes in the country's
 long-term political and economic policies. The meas-
 ures taken so far have helped to push China's econo-
 my away from its Stalinist and Maoist heritage and to
 bring it somewhat closer to Western-style economies.
 We believe, for instance, that the Deng-Zhao econom-
 ic readjustment and reforms program was given a
 strong impetus by the 1978 revision in oil supply
 projections. The new leadership was quick to realize
 that China did not have the resources and capital to
 continue to support a massive Soviet-style industrial
 buildup and hence opted for a more consumer- and
 export-oriented economy led by light industry.
 Equally important was the realization that China
 could not solve its energy problems by itself. At least
 for the energy sector, self-reliance as a guiding princi-
 ple was discarded to allow the introduction of West-
 ern capital and technology in ways that the leader-
 ship's Maoist predecessors would have considered
 "exploitationist." Offshore oil is the most dramatic
 example, but Western and Japanese firms are increas-
 ingly becoming involved in everything from onshore
 seismic surveys to nuclear power development.
 Our judgment that China's energy balances will
 continue to tighten through the rest of the decade will
 strengthen China's need to cooperate with the West.
 At the same time, however, it will force Beijing to
 make difficult and politically divisive decisions about
 the allocation of increasingly scarce energy resources.
 These decisions may threaten the leadership consen-
 sus that has allowed Beijing to make bold decisions on
 the importation of Western capital and technology
 and the unavoidable "capitalistic" and "bourgeois"
 influences that come with it. This danger will be
 particularly evident if major programs-such as the
 offshore exploration effort-are unsuccessful. We dis-
 cuss briefly in the following sections some of the key
 areas that will require controversial energy-related
 decisions over the next decade.
 Investment Strategy. The relatively modest but steady
 growth that we believe is possible if there are no
 major energy problems is not a cause for alarm in
 Beijing. It will, however, require the central govern-
 ment to consider its investment programs carefully in
 order to make sure the growth occurs in the most
 beneficial sectors. Even within the energy sector,
 Beijing is now grappling with tough investment deci-
 sions that will have a large impact on future energy
 supply:
 ? In the electric power sector, whether to emphasize
 long-term, capital-intensive but fuel-saving hydro-
 electric and nuclear power development or faster
 and cheaper coal-fired capacity. In the past few
 years, the long-term approach appears to have had
 an edge, but that may change if severe power
 shortages occur in 1984 and 1985.

 Secret
 ? In oil exploration, whether to emphasize areas
 where discoveries can be exploited quickly or areas,
 such as the Tarim Basin, with better prospects but
 which will take decades to exploit.
 ? In coal mine development, whether to continue the
 rapid development of small, non-state-owned coal
 mines or step up investment in large, state-owned,
 mining operations.
 A key difficulty in making investment decisions is the
 lack of a rational interest rate structure. The very low
 domestic rates tend to encourage capital-intensive
 projects, particularly nuclear and hydroelectric plants,
 whereas the large differential between domestic and
 international market interest rates tends to discourage
 borrowing from the West.
 Energy Prices. This brings into focus one of the key
 problems in China's economy-the lack of a pricing
 mechanism that allocates scarce resources efficiently.
 China's energy prices are by almost all accounts far
 out of adjustment. To preserve price stability, Beijing
 has held energy prices relatively constant since the
 1950s despite clear changes in domestic and interna-
 tional supply and demand conditions.
 Crude oil and coal are currently priced at only 25
 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the interna-
 tional price. Gasoline is priced close to the interna-
 tional level, but diesel fuel is inexplicably priced at
 only 40 percent of the price of gasoline. Heavy fuel oil
 is also very cheap. Although the international prices
 may not be a perfect indicator of supply and demand
 within China, Chinese economists are increasingly
 turning to them to illustrate the inadequacy of Chi-
 nese prices.
 Also the price system does not take into account the
 differences in quality among types of crude oil and
 coal. Washed coal, for example, is sold at the same
 price as unwashed coal, which creates a disincentive
 for mines to clean up their production. This also
 forces the railroads to haul tons of rubble along with
 the coal.
 In the Maoist system-at least in theory-the relative
 price of energy made little difference because energy
 was simply allocated according to plan and enterprise
 profits were returned to the state. In the emerging
 "mixed" economy that some of the economic reform-
 ers are trying to bring about, prices are much more
 important. Numerous articles in Chinese economic
 journals now attack what their authors see as imper-
 fect decisionmaking based on an irrational price
 system. Typical complaints are:
 ? The abnormally high profits garnered by petroleum
 refineries-the result of cheap crude prices and high
 product prices-have caused the buildup of redun-
 dant refining capacity.
 ? Industry is encouraged to burn the relatively cheap
 crude and fuel oil.
 ? Oilfields and coal mines are encouraged to export
 crude oil and coal at much higher world market
 prices rather than sell it to domestic customers.F_
 Prominent Chinese leaders have recognized for years
 the need to increase energy prices, and some steps
 have been taken. In 1981, for example, after coal
 output dropped, in part because of the inability of
 most of the country's coal mines to make a profit, the
 government increased prices for small-scale coal
 mines, which helped boost output. More recently,
 taxes have been imposed on crude and fuel oil to
 discourage such use. When questioned in 1982 about
 the need for much larger and more comprehensive
 energy price adjustments, however, Premier Zhao
 acknowledged the need but stated that politically such
 a move was impossible.
 Whether the political climate has improved or not,
 Beijing is now formulating a sharply higher schedule
 of energy prices,
 the increases will proba-
 bly come in stages so they will not create too large a
 shock, but obviously they will not be welcomed by the
 public.

 Oil Exports. China's ability to increase exports of
 crude oil, petroleum products, and coal during 1978-

 country's strong international financial position. Ta-

 Our analysis suggests, however-and this is increas-
 ingly reflected in Chinese energy journals-that Chi-
 na may have to phase out oil exports. Indeed, by
 eliminating oil exports by 1990, and, if the planned
 petroleum output targets are reached, domestic con-
 sumption could rise by the 2-percent annual rate that
 we calculate will be necessary for a 5-percent rate of
 economic growth. Coal exports will probably rise
 because of contractual arrangements with Japan, but
 can only be expected to replace a small share of
 current oil earnings.
 Premier Zhao Ziyang stated in his report on the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan that China will under no circum-
 stances import oil. We also believe China will not
 import oil-and our analysis suggests imports will not
 be necessary unless the offshore exploration program
 finds much less oil than we expect. It is significant,
 however, that Zhao did not rule out a reduction of oil
 exports.
 the top leadership is currently
 deliberating over what would be a very difficult
 decision to reduce oil exports or slow economic
 growth.

 High-level concern over a possible reduction or even
 an elimination of a commodity that currently provides
 20 percent of the nation's foreign exchange earnings
 may also be a reason for China's reluctance to boost
 its general level of imports, despite the large current
 account surpluses of recent years. We regard some
 conservatism as prudent, particularly until a better
 idea can be obtained of what oil resources will be
 discovered offshore
 Household Demand. An issue that we believe will
 come to the forefront later this decade and in the
 1990s is the limited degree to which China's commer-
 cial and modern energy supplies are allocated for
 direct household and personal use. Table 16, from a

 The government, through its unified energy distribu-
 tion system, provides only 7 percent of rural energy
 supplies and almost all of that is used for production
 processes-only kerosene, for lighting, is used by
 households. Nearly half of the production from small
 coal mines, moreover, is consumed by local industry.
 Therefore, of the total energy consumed by house-
 holds for heating, cooking, and lighting, only 17
 percent is provided by what are considered commer-
 cial energy sources-coal and electricity.
 The scientist states that total rural energy consump-
 tion for household purposes falls 7 percent below what
 the Academy of Sciences calculates as necessary to
 sustain minimal living standards. As a result many
 peasants must use roots and tree bark for their winter
 heating. He concludes that the rural energy situation
 is "an exceedingly unfavorable development in Chi-
 na's rural economy and is of extreme inconvenience to
 the peasants' livelihood" and goes on to say that it is a
 matter of "urgency" to find ways to resolve the grave
 shortage of rural energy supplies
 Deng Xiaoping's modernization program and the
 increasingly available supply of modern consumer
 items-many of which require electricity-must be
 raising expectations among Chinese peasants that
 Beijing will have considerable difficulty meeting.[
 Implications for the United States
 China's need for new technology, both to explore and
 develop new energy resources and to improve the
 efficiency with which the country consumes energy,
 was one of the most important reasons for Beijing to
 open up strong commercial links with the Western
 world. China, we believe, sees the United States as the
 best source for much of this technology and thus
 makes access to it a pivotal consideration in its official
 dealings with the United States. This technology can
 thus form a relatively stable underpinning for China's
 opening to the United States. Beijing did not, for
 instance, allow the mid-1983 political and economic
 controversies with the United States to hamper the
 offshore oil contract negotiations that were occurring
 during the same period."
 There are a number of areas in which energy technol-
 ogy is already forging important commercial links
 between the two countries:
 ? Offshore oil-a dozen US firms are taking the lead
 in exploring China's promising South China Sea
 continental shelf. If successful, this exploration will
 lead to long-term-up to 35 years-commitments
 by the firms to work in China in an industry of vital
 importance to Beijing.

 ? Onshore oil-China is actively negotiating for, and
 purchasing, US technology needed to maintain out- 25X1
 put at increasingly mature fields.
 ? Technology for the generation and transmission of
 electric power-US firms are increasingly becoming
 involved in upgrading China's obsolete technology.
 China's power industry will probably expand at a
 faster rate than in any major country over the next
 two decades, offering a continuing source of
 business.

 ? The coal industry, in which China also has probably
 the most ambitious development program in the
 world, is also creating a demand for US production
 equipment and the technology to burn coal cleanly
 and efficiently.
 Two areas of potential cooperation-contingent on
 solving difficult investment and political problems-
 include hydroelectric and nuclear power development,
 which some Chinese view as the dominant energy
 sources in the next century.
 In most of these areas China believes the United
 States holds the most desirable technology. US firms,
 however, usually meet fierce competition from Euro-
 pean and Japanese firms. China, moreover, has
 proved adept at playing competitors against each
 other. This competition will probably become more
 intense, particularly when it comes to the financing of
 energy projects-an area in which the United States
 appears at considerable disadvantage.
 Despite the development of what must be considered
 an overall advantageous commercial relationship for
 the United States, China's energy issue also has the
 potential for creating problems. China's current lead-
 ership has placed a great deal of its prestige on
 achieving economic progress. A willingness to experi-
 ment with more capitalistic, decentralized economic
 policies and a general openness to foreign trade and
 investment are key features of the government's mod-
 if energy shortages were to retard the process of
 economic growth severely, a marked change in leader-
 ship policy could result. Although speculative, it is
 possible that energy shortages could be blamed on
 inadequate state planning, while measures to limit the
 economic damage of such shortages, by raising energy
 prices, for instance, could raise political unrest. Left-
 ists could then point back to a period of cheap and
 plentiful energy in the 1960s and early 1970s and call
 for a return to more self-reliant, Maoist economic
 policy. Oil output did, after all, increase from 10
 million tons a year to 90 million tons during the
 decade of the now-despised Cultural Revolution.
 Our analysis suggests, however, that, with carefully
 chosen policies that limit the increase in energy
 consumption, and with only average luck in discover-
 ing new oil resources, China can maintain a reason-
 able economic growth rate that will limit the need for
 major policy reversals.
 Even without major changes in policy, one likely
 problem is that trade and financial tension between
 the United States and China will rise should Beijing
 decide to reduce sharply its oil exports. Beijing would
 try to offset this loss by increasing exports of more
 sensitive goods-textiles, for instance-and by re-
 questing more financial support from international
 aid agencies.
