 Despite new Soviet pressures, Czechoslovak lead-

 Although the reaction of the Czechoslovak leader-

 negotiate an agreement which will legalize an in-

 Precautionary moves were taken by the Saigon
 government on 8 October to forestall a possible
 coup following unconfirmed reports from various
 sources of plotting by some low-level South
 Vietnamese military officers.   The Communists
 generally avoided heavy ground engagements again
 this week, and weekly casualty figures for US

 EUROPE
 The Czechoslovaks returned from Moscow late last week bowed but
 unbroken.
 The negotiations were tough, with further concessions forced on
 Prague. Dubcek reportedly twice broke down emotionally during the talks.
 A separate government delegation went to Moscow this week to work out a
 status of forces agreement. On other key points, as set forth in the com-
 munique upon Dubcek's return home, however, the Czechoslovak party
 leadership has reverted to its typical procrastination. Prague still refuses to
 reconcile itself to full submission to the USSR, although its line on maintain-
 ing the post-January liberal policy seems to have weakened.
 The USSR has bluntly indicated its dissatisfaction with the pace and
 scope of Czechoslovak compliance with the Moscow agreement of last
 August and has clearly forced another backward step on Prague. It is not
 likely to put up for long with this latest Czechoslovak foot-dragging.
 To the rest of the world, Moscow goes on saying that it has the right
 and duty to manage affairs in the "socialist commonwealth," but that the
 invasion should be forgotten and "business as usual" resumed. Indeed, the
 Soviets appeared to be trying hard to refurbish their image by welcoming
 several important visitors to Moscow and having Gromyko make a relatively
 moderate presentation to the UN General Assembly. Kosygin's surprise visit
 to Finland this week may have been aimed at quieting fears there. The Soviet
 Premier seems to have been mainly interested, however, in warning Helsinki
 not to let its opposition to the occupation of Czechoslovakia affect its basic
 relationship with Moscow.
 Yugoslav leader Tito has lost confidence in the Soviet leadership and
 remains apprehensive over possible long-range Soviet moves in the Balkans.
 The East Germans this week intensified their propaganda denouncing West
 German "provocations" in West Berlin, especially the Christian Democrats'
 congress scheduled for early November.
 NATO wound up the first phase of its continuing assessment of the
 Czechoslovak crisis, agreeing that the Alliance must be strengthened but
 failing to come up with specific measures. Meanwhile, Western governments
 have made little economic response to the invasion. East-West trade has been
 set back temporarily. but shows no sign of decline over the long run.

 CZECHOSLOVAKS RESIST NEW SOVIET PRESSURES TO CAPITULATE
 25X1
 Despite new Soviet pressures,
 Czechoslovak leaders continued to
 procrastinate concerning Moscow's
 demands that they implement the
 August agreement.
 Party leader Dubcek,, Premier
 Cernik, and Slovak party chief
 Husak received a cold. reception
 in Moscow during their summit con-
 ference with Brezhnev, Kosygin
 and Podgorny on 3-4 October.   The
 communique issued at the end of
 the talks showed that the Russians
 are dissatisfied with the pace and
 scope of Czechoslovak compliance
 with the Moscow agreement of
 26 August..   The communique' makes
 clear that Moscow is determined
 to compel the Czechoslovaks to
 act according to its wishes, and
 will force Prague to make conces-
 sions.
 During the talks, Prague
 leaders agreed to at least one
 major concession, to negotiate a
 treaty that will provide a basis
 for the indefinite Soviet occupa-
 tion of Czechoslovakia.   The
 agreement calls for the "tempo.-
 rary" stationing of an unspeci-
 fied number of Soviet troops on
 Czechoslovak soil.   "Other
 troops"--presumably those not
 included in the occupation force--
 will be withdrawn in "stages."
 about 100,000 troops will. remain.
 Deputy Premier Hamouz led a
 15-member Czechoslovak Government
 delegation to Moscow on 8 October
 to negotiate the status-of-forces
 agreement.   It is possible that
 President Svoboda also accompanied
 this delegation since, he, as an
 old general, might feel that his
 presence was necessary during such
 vital negotiations.   He may also
 have wanted to make one last at-
 tempt to convince the Soviets to
 dilute their demands or face a new
 leadership crisis in Prague.
 While in Moscow, Dubcek and
 company apparently also were pres-
 sured to make immediate policy
 changes that will water down :Dub-
 cek's liberalization program--
 particularly in the areas of party-
 controlled personnel appointments,
 ideology, propaganda, censorship,
 and centralization of the economy.
 Of these, Prague now seems most
 ready to impose stricter controls
 on the news media.
 Despite Soviet pressures
 Czechoslovak leaders are not :yet
 reconciled to full submission to
 all of these demands.   On 8 Oc-
 tOber the presidium issued a com-?
 munique suggesting that Prague
 intends to salvage what it can
 while talking about the conces-
 sions it may make to the Soviets.
 Moreover, the statement stressed
 that Prague will continue as many
 as possible of Dubcek's liberal
 policies, and that there will be
 no purge at the top level of the
 party or government.
 Prague also intends to pro-
 ceed with federalization of the
 country on 28 October

 More specific indications
 of Prague's intentions may come
 to light when the central commit-
 tee convenes, probably next week,
 to consider a list of "tasks"--
 presumably reflecting Soviet de-
 sires--which Dubcek and his col-
 leagues will submit for approval.
 The Slovak Communist party
 after hearing party chief Husak's
 report on the trip to Moscow,
 took immediate steps to impose
 new controls on Slovak informa-
 tion media.   The party ordered
 an increase in the amount of time
 and space allotted to propaganda
 and to political indoctrination
 in the press, radio, and televi-
 sion.
 In addition, the Soviet am-
 bassador in Prague met with the
 Czechoslovak minister of justice
 on 7 October, possibly to discuss
 terminating another phase of
 Dubcek's liberalization--the re-
 habilitation of former political
 prisoners.   The Russians will
 clearly try to prevent the re-
 opening of any more trials that
 25X1
 would expose Moscow's role in
 the bloody purges of the Stalin-
 ist era.
 the Soviets
 25X1
 are demanding three training areas
 as well as numerous housing fa-
 cilities which were to b
 e made
 available by 10 October.

 NATO's RESPONSE TO THE CZECHOSLOVAK CRISIS
 The NATO allies ended the
 first round of their continuing
 assessment of the Czechoslovak
 crisis last week in general agree-
 ment on the need--if not the
 means--for strengthening the al-
 liance.
 In four days of special con-
 sultations, all 15 allies recog-
 nized the importance of develop-
 ing a greater degree of solidarity
 in the wake of the Soviet inter-
 vention.   There was also a gen-
 eral reaffirmation--although with-
 out French concurrence--of the
 traditional concept of "forward
 defense," envisioning an initial
 response to Soviet aggression as
 close to Communist borders as
 possible.
 The three allied powers
 responsible for Berlin reasserted

 their basic commitment to defend
 the city.   The allies pointedly
 subordinated the search for de-
 tente to their own defense in-
 terests.   In advancing the date
 of the regular NATO ministerial
 meeting to mid-November the mem-
 bers symbolically underlined the
 importance of the events in Czech-
 oslovakia for the alliance..
 Judging from initial state-
 ments, however, few of the Euro-
 pean governments were willing to
 match principle with performance.
 West Germany tentatively offered
 to maintain a small number of
 additional forces, while Italy
 agreed to upgrade the readiness
 of units already assigned to NATO.
 Only Greece, with an obvious stake
 in strengthening its image, went
 beyond a purely minimal commit-
 ment, offering both a budgetary
 increase and a hike in the :number
 of its NATO contingents.
 The British, who had already
 pledged two increases in their
 forces prior to the Soviet in-
 vasion, declined to take on any
 new obligations until the allies
 jointly determined NATO's needs
 and priorities.  Most of the
 smaller members were also unwill-
 ing to move ahead without some
 kind of prior agreement on joint
 defense goals.
 One decision taken last
 week may eventually meet this re-
 quirement.   Ignoring French pro-
 tests, the North Atlantic Council
 finally endorsed a summary state-
 ment on the meetings highlighting
 various categories of action deemec
 necessary. This document may per-
 mit some of the more cautious al-

 NEW PORTUGUESE GOVERNMENT MAKES IMPRESSIVE DEBUT
 Marcello Caetano's initial
 moves as prime minister  are
 creating a favorable impression
 of his  ability  to handle the
 transition from Salazar.
 His inaugural speech was a
 model of balance between affirm-
 ing continuity with Salazar's pol-
 icies and hinting at the need for
 cautious and gradual changes.
 While praising Salazar, Caetano
 clearly showed that he means to
 be his own man.   His cabinet re-
 tains most of Salazar's key min-
 isters, but the few new appoint-
 ees---mostly professional people
 close to Caeta.no--will  bring

 needed  energy  to the adminis-
 tration.
 At his first cabinet meet-
 ing on 1 October, Caetano pre-
 sented general policy lines for
 improving public administration,
 intensifying economic develop-
 ment, and promoting social wel-
 fare.   Changes in economic and
 financial policies to stimulate
 growth are also in the offing,
 according to a close associate
 of Caetano.   Reportedly the pace
 of government activity has al-
 ready picked up, and old methods
 of doing business are being ques-
 tioned.
 Caetano
 has established good rapport with
 military leaders.   He has assured
 them that he is determined to
 hold all three of Portugal's
 African provinces, thus dispel-
 ling rumors that he might favor
 withdrawal to cut down on the
 economic drain caused by military
 action there.   Ranking military
 leaders believe Caetano will be
 sympathetic to their need for
 more modern equipment to maintain
 the African campaign.   Caetano's
 new minister of defense expects
 to achieve greater offensive
 punch in the antiguerrilla effort
 through more efficient use of ma-
 teriel and manpower.   He hopes,
 at least at first, to get along
 without larger funds, realizing
 that Caetano is also committed
 to carry out development, welfare,
 and education programs.
 The new government has also
 begun to relax censorship some-
 what, although for now it will
 make no formal legal changes.
 The government has decided to
 free the top Socialist opposi-
 tion leader.  Most opposition
 leaders are reportedly impressed
 with these and other opening
 moves by Caetano.   They plan to
 hold off any demonstrations for
 at least two months to see whether
 Caetano offers any genuine open-
 ing to liberalization.   One wild-
 cat demonstration by some 50-100
 students took place in Lisbon on    25X1
 5 October, the anniversary of the
 founding of the republic, but was
 quickly dispersed by strop  police

 INVASION TO HAVE No LONG-TERM IMPACT ON EAST-WEST TRADE
 25X1
 25X1
 Western governments have
 made little economic response to
 the invasion of Czechoslovakia
 and are not likely to come up
 with long-term changes in pol-
 icy.   East-West trade, set back:
 temporarily, shows no sign of a
 long-run decline.   West Germany
 and France have emphasized that:
 their trade policies toward the
 Warsaw Five will not be affected.
 West European official ac-
 tions against Warsaw Pact coun-?
 tries  have  been  limited to
 short-run moves.   They have cur-
 tailed trade promotional visits
 of cabinet-level. officials, and
 have slowed down.  or  delayed
 scheduling trade negotiations
 and agreements for scientific
 and technical cooperation.. Some
 decline in business contacts may
 have temporarily slowed the ex-
 tension of new trade credits. In
 some cases, Western countries have
 canceled  official representa-
 tion at trade fairs, and West-
 ern businessmen have postponed
 or canceled  communist trade ex-
 hibits in the West.
 These actions are expected
 to slow down East-West trade over
 the next few months, but they
 will probably have little or no
 long--term impact.
 the growth in trade with the USSR
 and Eastern Europe will not, be
 significantly or permanently af-
 fected.
 In addition to the direct
 costs caused by the disruptions
 of the invasion itself, Czechoslo-
 vakia will lose out on the West-
 ern trade it hoped would result
 from its planned economic reform
 program.   The   economies of the
 other East European countries suf-
 fered only minor economic dislo-
 cations  as  a  result of the in-
 vasion, and little effect on their
 trade with the West is expected.
 Eastern Europe is :Losing  some of
 its-profitable Western tourism
 this year, but. West Europeans seek-
 ing inexpensive vacations probably
 will be :back in force in 1969.
 Soviet authorities are said to be
 making special, efforts to encourage
 a "'business as normal" attitude.
 Most West European govern-
 ments are sympathetic to increas-
 ing their trade with Rumania and
 Yugoslavia, which disapproved of
 the Warsaw Pact action.   Rumania,
 although heavily indebted to the
 West, is still planning to step
 up its credit purchases and has
 asked several West European coun-
 tries to buy more Rumanian goods.
 Yugoslavia, also heavily in debt
 to the West, is more inhibited by
 this than Rumania and is less prone
 to increase its Western imports.
 Moreover, Western quota restric-
 tions on Yugoslav agricultural and
 textile goods, although partially
 liberalized by several West Euro-
 pean countries, are likely to keep
 down growth of trade in these
 products in the near future. The
 Yugoslavs hope that discussions
 next week with the EEC on a non-
 preferential trade agreement will
 provide additional export oppor-
 tunities.

 FAR EAST
 There appears to be considerably more smoke than fire behind the new
 rash of coup rumors in Saigon. President Thieu's action in putting gov-
 ernment forces briefly on full alert on the basis of a low-level report of
 highly questionable validity suggests that he may be unrealistically jumpy
 about a possible move against him by Vice President Ky. Whatever the case,
 Thieu could be laying the groundwork for further purges of military ele-
 ments associated with Ky.
 In the ground war in Vietnam, major action by Communist forces came
 to a virtual standstill as a number of units appeared to be pulling back from
 prime target areas. Enemy withdrawals at this time are not, however, as
 widespread as during the pronounced lull in the fighting between mid-June
 and early August. Communist local forces, meanwhile, continued to chip
 away at the government presence in the countryside through terror, harass-
 ment and interdiction of lines of communication.
 In Communist China's hard-pressed factories, still attempting to over-
 come the effects of earlier political excesses, workers are being told to start a
 new mass movement to replace "bourgeois" technicians and managers with
 workers motivated by the thought of Mao Tse-tung. The confusion is being
 further compounded by a new Peking-sponsored drive to force managers to
 do manual labor for extended periods.
 The international aspects of the Sabah dispute seem for the moment to
 have given way to domestic considerations. Philippine President Marcos is
 finding the issue useful to him as he begins his bid for re-election next year.
 In Malaysia, Prime Minister Rahman and other national Alliance leaders
 feel themselves under less compulsion to exploit the Sabah issue because of
 the party's already bright prospects for parliamentary elections, also to be
 held next year. The furor over Sabah nevertheless is having a unifying effect,
 especially in Sabah itself and in the other East Malaysian state of Sarawak,
 which has tended to be more autonomy-minded than other constituents of
 the Federation.                                                          25X1

 VIETNAM
 Precautionary moves were
 taken by the Saigon government
 on 8 October to forestall a pos-
 sible coup following reports
 from various sources of plotting
 by some low-level South Vietnam-

 There is no firm evidence
 that. any high-level individual;;
 were involved, but President
 Thieu clearly is very nervous
 over the possibility of a move
 against him by Vice President
 Ky's faction or other disgruntled
 military leaders currently out
 of favor..   This was  apparent
 early last month when he placed
 the Saigon police on alert fol-
 lowing a coup rumor which later
 proved unfounded.   However   ap-
 prehensive Thieu actually may
 be, he could use the current
 flurry of rumors as a pretext
 for arrests and command realign-
 ments designed further to neu-
 tralize his opponents.
 In an address to the National
 Assembly on 7 October, Thieu
 warned the country against those
 who try to satisfy their personal
 or factional ambitions by spread-
 ing rumors that. the government
 has been "bought out by foreigners"
 and that it advocates coalition
 with the Communists.   The return
 of General  "Big" Minh from exile
 on 5 October has apparently pro-
 vided added grist for the rumor
 mill.   Some South Vietnamese
 "hawks" allege that Minh harbors
 neutralist sentiments.
 Saigon's rumormongers are
 likely to be particularly active
 during the next few weeks with
 tales of intrigue and forecasts
 of personnel shifts.   South Viet-

 to the effect that Thieu plans

 Military Developments
 In the large-unit war,  the
 Communists generally avoided heavy
 ground engagements again this
 week.   Even at the Thuong Duc
 Special Forces camp southwest of
 Da Nang, which has been threatened
 by North Vietnamese regulars since
 late last month, enemy actions
 were limited to mortar attacks
 and ambushes of allied patrols.
 US casualties, one of the
 best indicators of the intensity
 of the war and the level of the
 enemy's military effort, have
 declined steadily in recent weeks.
 US killed in action numbered 290
 for the week ending 21 September,
 247 for the week before last, and
 190 last week.   The figure of
 190 is the lowest American death
 toll since mid-August,  just
 prior to the opening of the Com-
 munists' most recent offensive
 phase.   South Vietnamese Army and
 Communist losses have also dropped
 recently, and the 1,654 enemy
 killed during the week ending 5
 October also was the lowest
 weekly figure reported since
 early August. A number of Commu-
 nist units appear to be pulling
 back from prime target areas.
 The Communists have tempo-
 rarily withdrawn selected units
 from active combat zones from
 time to time in the past.   Dur-
 ing the pronounced lull in the
 ground war between mid-June and
 early August, enemy withdrawals
 were considerably more widespread
 than at present.   In late March
 and early April, between the Tet
 and May offensives, the Communists
 also pulled back selected units
 to rear base areas.  As in the
 past, the current withdrawals
 appear to be aimed at providing
 some Communist forces with an
 opportunity to regroup, refit,
 and prepare for renewed initia-
 tives.
 The enemy's need to recover
 from allied spoiling operations
 and other difficulties stemming
 from unusually heavy rains in
 the northern part of the country
 are undoubtedly major factors in
 the current withdrawals.   The
 enemy's losses in the actions
 which began on 18 August, how-
 ever, are substantially lower
 than those reported in the May
 offensive.
 Meanwhile, in guerrilla ac-
 tions the Communists continued
 their local harassment through-
 out all four corps areas.  Viet
 Cong terrorists, for example,
 kidnaped 753 persons during the
 past two weeks and killed 348
 civilians, including many local
 officials,  in terror attacks in
 villages scattered through many
 provinces.   The Communists have
 also been actively disrupting
 lines of communication, espe-
 cially Route 4 which connects Sai-
 gon and the Viet Cong infested
 delta provinces.
 Authoritative justification
 for the tactical pullback now
 going on in South Vietnam was
 provided by politburo member Tru-
 ong Chinh in a major position
 paper broadcast by Hanoi in mid-
 September.   Speaking on behalf
 of the politburo, Truong Chinh

 noted that "at times, under cer-
 tain circumstances, we must. shift
 to the defensive to gain time,
 dishearten the enemy and buildd
 up our forces."   He went on, how-
 ever, to state flatly that the
 purpose of such a shift is to
 "prepare for a new offensive."
 Truong Chinh's remarks came
 as part of an over-all statement
 of regime policy both on the war
 in the South and on problems in
 North Vietnam.  He reaffirmed
 in unmistakable terms Hanoi's
 continued insistence on the "vio-
 lent" approach to seizing power
 in South Vietnam, and he specifi-
 cally ruled out any possibility
 of "peaceful" political competi-
 tion with the current Saigon gov-
 ernment.   The only road for the
 Communists in the South, accord-
 ing to Tru.ong Chinh, is the vio-
 lent one--increased military pres-
 sure combined with political ac-
 tion, which in his defintion,
 consists of such tactics as crip-
 pling strikes and show-of-force
 demonstrations.
 Despite his reaffirmation
 of the correctness of Hanoi's
 past policies, Truong Chinh ad-
 mitted that the "general offen-
 sive and uprising" launched at
 Tet this year has been less than
 a complete success.   Tet, he told
 his audience, was not an end in
 itself.   It was "just a new step,
 the beginning of a new phase in
 the war.   "Many hardships and
 sacrifices" will still have to
 be faced, according to Chinh,
 suggesting that the party leader-
 ship is prepared to dig in for
 another long :period of fighting
 if it proves :necessary..
 Truong Chinh's observations
 on North Vietnam also tend to
 copfirm that :Hanoi. foresees the
 possibility of a rather long
 period of continued combat.   His
 proposals on economic development
 in. the North,  for example, were
 pointed toward those steps which
 cap be taken during a period of
 possible renewed bombing north of
 the 19th parallel..
 Hanoi Increasing Imports
 Hanoi's seaborne imports
 increased by 35 percent during
 the first nine months of 1968
 compared with the same period
 last year and this higher level
 of shipping is expected to  con-
 tinue.   Foodstuffs and petroleum
 from the USSR and China accounted
 for most of the increase.    Food-
 stuffs this year represent about
 38 percent of North Vietnamese
 imports compared with about 30
 percent last year.   Imports of
 lage quantities of rice and
 flour are expected to continue
 in light of the poor North Viet-
 namese agricultural performance.
 The USSR continued to be
 the largest single supplier of
 goods to North Vietnam,  account-
 ing for 43 percent of North Viet-
 namese imports.   Deliveries from
 Chinese Communist ports have also

 risen, and they constitute 35

 The combination of record
 import levels and recent bad
 weather has led to unprecedented
 congestion at Haiphong.  Average
 layover time for departing dry
 cargo ships jumped from 14 days
 in May to almost 43 days in Sep-

 25X1
 COMMUNIST CHINA'S ECONOMY CONTINUES TO LAG
 The propaganda treatment
 given the Chinese Communist econ-
 omy during National Day celebra-
 tions on 1 October was uncharac-
 teristically low-keyed, reflect-
 ing this year's dearth of achieve-
 ments.   The keynote addresses by
 Chou En-lai and Lin Piao at the
 major National Day events did not
 refer to the economy at all.
 Peking's continuing concen-
 tration on political programs
 was highlighted in the week pre-
 ceding the holiday.  Although
 factories were still attempting
 to overcome the effects of pre-
 vious political excesses, workers
 were told to start a new mass
 movement to replace "bourgeois"
 technicians and managers with
 workers motivated by the thought
 of Mao Tse-tung.   The press made
 extravagant claims of workers
 designing machine tools beyond
 the ability of professional en-
 gineers and adapting steel roll-
 ing mills to uses exceeding orig-
 inal design specifications.   The
 beginning of the new worker move-
 ment was followed in early Oc-
 tober with a large-scale program
 directing all managers to do
 manual labor for extended periods.
 In addition, some of the most de-
 pendable workers--about 7 percent
 of the labor force, according to
 a provincial broadcast--are being
 withdrawn into "propaganda teams"
 to supervise schools and propa-
 ganda media.
 This preoccupation with pol-
 itics in factories places an-
 other stumbling block in the path
 to recovery from the depressed
 production of 1967, when the to-
 tal value of industrial output is
 estimated to have declined some
 10 to 20 percent from 1966.  Over
 all, there will probably be lit-
 tle if any increase over last
 year in 1968.   In certain impor-
 tant military programs further
 declines are known to have taken
 place.
 Agriculture in 1968 has not
 enjoyed
 the exceptionally good
 weather
 of 1967 which brought
 forth a
 bumper crop.   In 1968,
 Peking h
 as increased its pur-
 chase of
 chemical fertilizer
 from Jap
 an and the European con-
 sortium,
 Nitrex, to a record 7
 million
 tons partly to compen-
 sate for
 production shortfalls.
 Most of
 the fertilizer did not,       25X1
 however,
 arrive in time for use
 on this
 year's main crop.

 LAOTIAN POLITICAL FACTIONS CONTINUE MANEUVERING
 The Pathet Lao appear to be
 raising their price for any re-
 turn to the government.
 Recent Communist broadcasts,
 while reaffirming that any future
 accommodation with Vientiane must
 be within the framework of the
 1962 Geneva Accords, charged that
 the tripartite structure worked
 out among the Laotian parties,
 and which gave the Pathet Lao some
 relatively unimportant cabinet
 posts in the government, has now
 been "wrecked" by Souvanna and the
 rightists.   The Communists are
 demanding that any settlement
 must reflect the "realities of
 the current situation."
 Pathet Lao spokesman Sot
 Phetrasi recently spelled out
 these "realities" in a conversa-
 tion with a US official by warn-
 ing that changes in territorial
 control and in the Vientiane po-
 litical scene since 1962 will
 have to be taken into account be-
 fore any new formula can be worked
 out.   In the past year, the Com-
 munists have strengthened their
 position militarily through a
 number of victories.
 Although no new negotiations
 are in the offing, Prime Minister
 Souvanna is making another of his
 periodic efforts to get the gov-
 ernment organized for a future
 political contest with the Pathet
 Lao.  A number of his more for-
 ward-looking lieutenants are try-
 ing to interest younger civilian
 elements in establishing a united
 government party.   So far the ef-
 fort has had no more success than
 others in past years.   The opposi-
 tion of some military officers to
 anything involving a possible ac-
 commodation with the Pathet Lao
 is the major stumbling block.
 Souvanna is also making lit-
 tle headway in streamlining the
 military establishment.   A reor-
 ganization plan has gone into
 effect, and a move is presently
 under way to break the concentra-
 tion of power in the general
 staff by shifting some of its
 responsibilities to the Defense
 Ministry.   Thus far, however, the     25X1
 old-guard military leadership has
 been able to maintain its posi-
 tion despite the changes.

 PHILIPPINE-MALAYSIAN DEADLOCK PERSISTS
 No significant exchanges
 between Manila and Kuala Lumpur
 over the Philippine claim to Sa-
 bah have occurred since mid-Sep-
 tember, and both sides appear to
 have turned for the moment to
 the domestic implications of the
 dispute.
 The Philippines has announced
 that its embassy staff members
 will not withdraw from Kuala Liam-
 pur as announced earlier.   Also,
 Manila has acceded to a Malaysian
 request and has pulled out its
 customs inspectors stationed in
 Sabah; under the antismuggling
 agreement which Kuala Lumpur re-
 cently abrogated.
 Although Philippine Presi-
 dent Marcos is currently trying
 to prevent any further increases
 in-Philippine-Malaysian tensions,
 at home he is playing the Sabah
 dispute to his own political ad-
 vantage.   Marcos appears to have
 turned the tables on political op-
 ponents who kept: the claim to Sa-
 bah alive in order to discomfit
 him.   He is showing considerable
 skill in converting an issue he
 initially regarded as a political
 embarrassment into a matter of na-
 tional honor, which he is confi-
 dent will strengthen his bid for
 re-election next year.   He prob-
 ably also calculates that emo-
 tions over Sabah can be used to
 deflect public dissatisfaction
 *
 over the administration's per-
 formance on domestic problems.
 In Malaysia the issue has
 also tended to, consolidate popu-
 lar' support for the government,
 but Prime Minister Rahman,  in
 sharp contrast to Marcos, so far
 has not exploited the issue for
 domestic political purposes.   His
 national Alliance coalition has
 a commanding parliamentary ma-
 jority and is in no danger of
 defeat in elections set for next
 spring.
 In the East Malaysian state
 of Sarawak, however, the position
 of the local Alliance affiliate
 is weaker than that of the parent
 body, and it has made some ef-
 foxHt: to strengthen its position
 by.exploiting the dispute.   Oppo-
 sition parties have been persuaded
 to participate in government--spon--
 sored rallies and to issue state-
 ments denouncing Manila.  More
 significantly, the Principal op-
 position leader, Stephen Ningkan,
 once a vocal advocate of greater
 autonomy, has now loudly pro--
 claimed his party's loyalty to
 the concept of` national unity.
 In Sabah itself, Chief Minister
 Tun Mustapha has deliberately
 exaggerated the Philippine                25X1
 "threat" to further consolidate
 his already strong  osition.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The US decision to begin negotiations on the sale of 50 Phantom jet
 aircraft to Israel has produced a fierce outcry from the Arab states and
 charges that the US has thus torpedoed the Jarring Mission. Israeli Foreign
 Minister Eban's "nine-point" peace plan, as enunciated in the UN on 8
 October, is similarly meeting Arab criticism as providing no new proposals
 toward a Middle East settlement.
 The Shah of Iran reportedly believes that his recent trip to the USSR
 reinforced his policy of national independence. The Shah says that he
 refused to permit a condemnation of US policy in the joint communiqu6
 unless Iran's condemnation of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia was also
 added. The communique therefore dismissed international affairs in one
 sentence.
 Algerian Premier Boumediene, overriding the suspicions of his foreign
 minister, is continuing to pursue his detente with Moroccan King Hassan.
 The timing of a Boumediene-Hassan "summit" is still undecided, however.
 Both Congo governments are preoccupied with the Mulele affair. Braz-
 zaville's decision to sever relations with Kinshasa as a reaction to Mulele's
 execution was received with silence across the river, where Kinshasa officials
 presumably are discussing an appropriate response.
 In the Nigerian civil war, numerous Biafran counterattacks, made pos-
 sible by a sharp increase in arms imports, have nearly halted the federal
 offensive and even regained some ground for the secessionists. French
 support for Biafra now includes the airlift of weapons to the Ivory Coast and
 Gabon for transshipment to Biafra. The fighting is likely to be drawn out for
 a long time.
 Id Sierre Leone, the political situation continues to deteriorate as Prime
 Minister Stevens' northern-dominated government tries to put the lid on
 activities of the southern-based opposition party. Tribal tensions are pro-
 ducing increasing unrest within the army as well as among civilians.
 The entire area from West Africa to India will face a locust threat for
 the next two years if the swarms presently moving through the Sudan into
 East Africa are not brought under control. The East African locust control
 organization is critically short of insecticide, spraying planes, and pilots,
 however.                                                            25X1

 LOCUST THREAT INCREASES IN EAST AFRICA
 The locust plague which has
 been menacing the Middle East
 and East Africa since last fall
 is entering a new and more crit-
 ical   phase.   Crop production
 throughout the area could be
 threatened for the next two years
 if new swarms in East Africa
 are not quickly controlled.
 Twenty separate locust
 swarms, ranging in size from
 44 to 300 square miles, have
 been reported moving eastward
 30 to 40 miles per day across
 the Sudan.   At this rate they
 will reach the foot of the
 Ethiopian highlands this week.
 A large area of Ethiopia is
 already infested,  and the
 arrival of additional hordes
 from the Sudan could cause
 serious damage to the Ethiopian
 harvest.
 The Sudanese have been
 dilatory in their own efforts
 to contain the locust threat.
 The ineffective government in
 Khartoum was reluctant even to
 acknowledge the existence of
 the plague until locusts appeared
 in the environs of the capital.
 At the same time,  the Ethiopian
 authorities have not fully rec-
 ognized   the gravity of their
 situation, which could result
 in a major food shortage within
 six months if the locusts are
 not controlled.
 Locust control facilities
 are still extremely limited in
 East Africa, despite efforts by
 the regional Desert Locust Con-
 trol Organization for East Africa
 (DLCOEA)   to mobilize support for
 spraying activities to put down
 the threat.   The organization is
 now suffering a critical shortage
 of insecticides,  and both spray-
 ing planes and pilots are in
 short supply.
 If the locusts are not
 controlled in Ethiopia and
 Somalia they will probably move
 south into Kenya,  threatening
 that country's crops as well.
 The Kenyan Government is already
 preparing for an invasion.
 Locusts now moving in the
 Sudan could also move south to
 Uganda.
 The locust threat farther
 east seems to be under slightly
 better control.   The Pakistanis
 claim that the swarms there have
 been eliminated, and there have
 been no recent reports of serious
 infestations in either Iran or
 India.   Nevertheless,  the present
 breeding trend,  and failure to
 control the insects in the crucial
 area of the Sudan and the Horn
 of Africa, will leave the entire
 Middle East - African area vul-
 nerable to locust swarms for the
 next two years.

 25X1
 25X1
 Biafran resistance to the
 federal Nigerian push on remain-
 ing secessionist-held territory
 has stiffened considerably over
 the past few weeks, mainly be-
 cause of a marked increase in
 arms supplies to the rebels. This
 increase in munitions will prob-
 ably enable the Biafrans to delay
 considerably the capture of their
 remaining strongholds by federal
 forces, despite federal superiority
 in numbers and equipment.
 The airlift of arms from
 Libreville and Abidjan has re-
 ceived at least
 from the French;
 the French
 Air Force may even  a moving French
 arms there for shipment to Biafra.
 This increased arms supply
 will not only enable the Biafrans
 to hold their remaining territory
 longer, but will also make more
 likely a prolonged guerrilla ef-
 fort by the Biafrans when and if
 these bastions are taken by the
 Nigerians.  Morale in Biafra still
 appears generally high, and Biafran
 leader Ojukwu has shown no signs
 of giving up the struggle.
 In recent fighting, Nigeria's
 lst Division has made no signifi-
 cant advances since capturing
 Okigwi on 30 September. Last month
 the division had launched a push
 from the north toward Umuahia, the
 last major Biafran town still in
 secessionist hands.   The 3rd Ma-
 rine Commando Division, which made
 gains in the south during August
 and September, is now occupied with
 sharp Biafran counterattacks. The
 2nd Division has been unable to move
 beyond its long-held positions around
 Onitsha and Awka.

 MULELE AFFAIR ROC
 The return and execution of
 rebel leader Pierre Mulele has
 created considerable agitation
 in both Congo (Kinshasa) and
 Congo (Brazzaville) and has pre-
 cipitated a rupture of relations
 between the two governments.
 Mulele was seized, tried
 and executed secretly following
 his return to Kinshasa from Braz--
 zaville under an amnesty granted
 by Foreign Minister Justin Bomboko
 in President Mobutu's absence.
 An associate of leftist former
 Premier Patrice Lumumba, Mulele
 had been directing a bloody guer-
 rilla campaign against the cen-
 tral government in the western
 Congo since 1963, but in September
 he fled to Brazzaville in search
 of sanctuary.
 Ordered by Mobutu to return
 Mulele to Kinshasa by any means,
 Congolese authorities first, tried
 to kidnap the rebel leader. When
 that failed, Bomboko went to
 Brazzaville to negotiate hi  vol-
 untary:.return. After several days'
 discussions with Mulele and Braz-
 zaville officials, Bomboko granted
 amnesty and Mulele returned to
 Kinshasa almost in triumph for a
 round of welcoming festivities.
 The reaction of most Congo-
 lese--smarting under the remem-
 brance of the atrocities ascribed
 to Mulele and his followers---was
 bitter, however, and many demanded
 his arrest and execution.   When
 MS Bom CONGOS
 Mobutu returned to   the   Congo
 several days later, he quickly re-
 versed his foreign minister's
 decision and announced that Mulele
 would; be arrested and brought to
 trial,.  A three-man military tri-
 bunal:met secretly on17 October
 and sentenced Mulele to death.
 His execution was announced on 9
 ,October.
 there had been indications
 that ~ioth countries tried to play
 down the affair in an effort to
 minimize the damage to their
 official relations, which had
 been improving over, the past two
 years',.   Prior to the announcement
 of Mulele's execution, the govern-
 ment-pontrolled radio 'in Brazza-
 villedenounced the demonstration
 which; had been staged by local
 Leftist youths in front of the
 Kinshasa embassy following Mule-
 'Le's arrest.   In Kinshasa, the
 press; put much of the ''blame for
 -the demonstration on foreign--
 i.e., Cuban and Chinese--influ-
 ence and pleaded with Kinshasa
 youth to keep calm.
 Once Mulele's execution was
 made public, however,LBrazzaville's
 rulin  military-civilian council
 promptly announced its decision
 to sever relations. The action
 reflects the Brazzaville govern-
 ment's acute embarrassment over
 the episode and its strong desire
 to dissociate itself publicl  from
 Kinshasa's double-dealin

 INDIA'S MONSOON CAUSING PROBLEMS
 An erratic monsoon is creat-
 ing hardships in some areas and
 will reduce Indian foodgrain
 production by several million
 tons under last year's record
 harvests.

 usually dry weather, late Septem-

 provided some relief.   The belated

 and have improved planting condi-
 tions for winter crops.
 Nevertheless, crop damage
 from the August-September dry
 spell is likely to keep foodgrain
 production several million tons
 below last year's record level
 of 96-100 million tons.   This
 summer's production may approach
 60 million tons and the normally
 much smaller winter crop is un-
 likely to match the record high
 of about 31 million tons harvested
 last spring.
 The October rains that broke
 the dry spell in northeastern
 India turned into a violent and
 destructive 60-hour storm in the
 Himalayas.   The Indian protector-
 ate of Sikkim was. probably the
 hardest hit, although northern
 West Bengal and parts of neigh-
 boring Bihar and Assam states
 were also heavily damaged.   Thou-
 sands have been reported missing
 or killed and thousands more are
 homeless.
 The expected decline in food-
 grain production will be a psy-
 chological setback to the "green
 revolution," and India probably
 will have to release much of the
 buffer stock accumulated from
 last year's bumper harvests.
 Large-scale imports of food will
 probably be necessary for several
 more years, i     1  to replenish
 the reserves.                             25X1

 WESTERN HEMISPHERE
 Student-organized outbreaks erupted again in several Latin American
 countries during the past week. Some of the disturbances were linked to the
 anniversary of Che Guevara's death on 9 October, while others seemed to be
 in reaction to the coup in Peru earlier this month or in sympathy with the
 Mexican students. As expected, US installations were among the primary
 targets.
 Students stoned a US-Chilean binational center and the US Consulate in
 Santiago. In Peru, minor violence-much of it student-inspired-occurred
 throughout the country as demonstrators protested the ouster of President
 Belaunde by the military last week. In the Dominican Republic, Molotov
 cocktails were exploded outside a US-run binational center, and explosives
 were discovered near other US facilities. In Brazil, antigovernment student
 demonstrations on 8 October resulted in bloodshed when a large security
 force moved against the protesters.
 5X6
 At present there is no evidence available that student riots in Latin
 America are interrelated or directed from abroad. Local Communists, Trot-
 skyites, Castroites, and other leftist extremists among the students, however,
 have been quick and well prepared-and in many cases well armed-to
 exploit the student grievances.
 The new military government in Peru has expropriated the large US-
 owned International Petroleum Company. This move demonstrated the
 strong nationalist sentiment of the regime.
 The execution of two "confessed saboteurs" in Cuba on 7 October has
 re-emphasized Fidel Castro's apparent concern over "counterrevolutionary"
 acts. Although most of the frequent reports of antiregime incidents in Cuba
 during recent weeks remain unconfirmed, some strong reaction by indi-
 viduals against the increasing severity of living conditions seems inevitable.
 The Bahamas has taken an important step toward eventual inde-
 pendence as a result of the recent London constitutional conference. Upon     25X1
 his return from London, Prime Minister Pindling announced that his govern-
 ment now will have responsibility for internal security and will also gain

 PERU'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT
 One of the first official acts
 of the military government of Presi-
 dent Velasco, which ousted President
 Belaunde on 3 October, was to expro-
 priate large holdings of the US-
 owned International Petroleum Com-
 pany  (IPC)  in northwestern Peru.
 This move reflects the new govern-
 ment's strong nationalistic senti-
 ment and will increase its popular
 support. The expropriation will,
 also delay foreign investment and
 debt refinancing which Peru badly
 needs and has been seeking.
 The decree, made public on
 9 October, expropriated the La Brea

 COMPLEX PROBLEMS PLAGUE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT
 The Costa e Silva government
 is being hard pressed by a variety
 of perplexing problems that in-
 volve the military, students,,
 workers, and. elements of the
 church.
 Perhaps the most serious is
 a crisis in the air force caused.
 by the apparent attempts of right-
 wing officers to use an elite
 parachute unit to eliminate oppo-
 sition student and political lead-
 ers.   A shake-up in the air force
 leadership is likely if the al-
 legations prove true or are widely
 accepted.   This scandal is sympto-
 matic of the renewed activity
 among right-wing extremists--not
 only in the military but also in
 civilian circles---who believe the
 government has noi_ dealt firmly
 enough with corruption and sub-
 version.
 Army minister General Lyra
 Tavares has confided his unease
 over the "national situation" to
 the US army attache.   The general
 is upset by the implications of
 the air force crisis and by the
 activities of a group around the
 President who "shield" Costa e
 Silva from unpleasant truths.
 The general. believes that
 many officers deeply resent recent
 speeches by left-wing federal
 deputies bitterly attacking the
 military.   He reportedly has urged
 the President to suspend the po-
 litical rights of at least one of:
 the offenders--a move that would
 be of questionable constitution-
 ality.   Certainly there is some
 disquiet among congressional lead-
 ers who fear that any further gov-
 ernment curtailment of legislative
 prerogatives or interference with
 the rights of deputies would irrep-
 arably   damage the prestige and
 independence of the congress.
 Military restiveness is com-
 plicated by other developments on
 the civilian front.;  Rioting in
 Sao Paulo last week took one stu-
 dent's life.  Radical leftist Sao
 Paulo University students continue
 to fend off attacks' by their con-
 servative MacKenzi.e University
 counterparts---who appear to have
 at least tacit police support.
 Leftist-led students staged a large
 protest march on 4',October in Sao
 Paulo that drew some support from
 nonstudent  groups.'  A second dem-
 onstration on 8 October also re-
 sulted in violence.'',                                                                     Heavy-handed
 police action in breaking up the
 marches may bring the students new
 sympathizers.
 i
 Labor unhappiness has been
 manifested by illegal strikes by
 bank and metal workers in Belo
 Hor_izonte and by bank workers in
 other cities.          Swift government
 intervention has temporarily quelled
 the strikers' enthusiasm, but new
 outbreaks of labor discontent seem
 likely in the next few weeks.
 i
 The church haslalso added to
 Costa e Silva's burdens.   The mod-
 erate cardinal. of Sao Paulo re-
 fusjed last week to accept a decor-
 ation from the President--a ges-
 ture that not only dealt a personal
 rebuff to Costa e Silva but also
 made clear the Sao Paulo clergy's
 reluctance to endorse the govern-
 ment publicly.   In northeast Bra-
 zil', Archbishop Dom'.Helder Camara
 has inaugurated his."Liberating

 ECUADOR'S VELASCO WEATHERS FIRST CONGRESS SESSION
 President Jose Maria Velasco
 has come through the first session
 of congress without serious chal-
 lenge and is asserting his economic
 and political control with deter-
 mination.
 A working agreement between
 the Velasquistas and the center-
 left coalition in both the house
 and senate did not result in sig-
 nificant legislation, but did with-
 stand efforts by rightists and ex-
 president Carlos Arosemena to cur-
 tail Velasco's power over many gov-
 ernmental appointments.  Arosemena
 reportedly is disappointed that
 more of his followers did not re-
 ceive government jobs in return
 for his electoral assistance to
 Velasco, and the uneasy truce be-
 tween the two old enemies appears
 to have broken down.   The most un-
 savory Arosemena appointee has been
 removed as head of the security
 agency, but other supporters remain
 in positions where their leader's
 penchant for mischief could cause
 Velasco trouble.
 Sugar exporters in Guayaquil,
 the first target of Velasco's cru-
 sade against the "oligarchy" he
 accuses of exploiting the country,
 have agreed to his demands, at least
 for the present.  The three larg-
 est mills will turn over their ex-
 tra profits on sales to the US to
 the government--a windfall which
 may amount to nearly $1 million in
 1968.  Although his government is
 critically short on operating funds
 and long on debts, Velasco says he
 will use the money for development
 projects.
 Velasco is exploring closer
 trade and, possibly, other ties
 with Communist countries.   He in-
 vited the Soviet ambassador to
 Chile to his inauguration, but then
 was noncommittal on the ambassador's
 overture toward a resumption of dip-
 lomatic relations.  He has been
 less demagogic than in the past
 about Ecuador's boundary dispute
 with Peru, and has kept a discreet
 silence on the military coup in
 Peru--the method by which Vela
 was ousted in 19

 election date draws nearer.
 The relative strengths of
 leading candidates Gonzalo Bar-
 rios, Rafael Caldera, Luis Prieto,
 and Miguel Burelli Rivas have
 shifted somewhat, but none has a
 lead wide enough to ensure vic-
 tory.   The closeness of the con-
 test has already resulted in
 charges of coup plotting, vio-
 lence, and election fraud.
 Supporters of governing Demo-
 cratic Action  (AD)  Party candi-
 date Gonzalo Barrios have attacked
 the platform of the Christian So-
 cialist Party   (COPEI)  as a stat-
 ist, totalitarian document which
 would regiment the economic and
 political life of the nation.
 The AD has flooded the press with
 a series of ads portraying COPEI
 leaders and, presidential candi-
 date Rafael Caldera as New World
 Nazis.   These charges will prob-
 ably reinforce the suspicions of
 some members of the middle class
 and business community who are
 already concerned over Caldera's
 alleged inability to control rad:L-
 cal elements within his party.
 In response Caldera accused
 the government of preparing a
 coup d'etat to keep COPEI from
 office and that the government
 was importing arms to equip re-
 gional and local party organiza-
 tions.  Although AD leaders dis-
 Although the
 litary acknowledge their commit-

 rrent situation has the military

 urses of action.

 In another election develop-

 of the People's Electoral Move-
 ment (MEP) which broke away from
 trhe AD in December 1967, report--
 ddly has refused to accept open
 k acking from the Communist Party's

 Advancement  (UPA).   Prieto re-
 portedly told UPA leaders that

 sort and attack the Communists
 vfrith every resource at his com-

 port, and has taken pains to in-
