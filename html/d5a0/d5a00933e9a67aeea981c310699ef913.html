 WWI,          SECRET;
 EUROPEAN SECURITY: FOR OPENERS
 An aggressive Romanian delegation got the
 European security conference preparatory talks in
 Helsinki off to a dramatic start. Even before the
 opening speeches, the Romanians managed to
 provoke a debate over procedure. Moscow had
 hoped such matters could have been settled in-
 formally before the talks began. Extensive press
 coverage of the "closed" meetings and nearly
 unanimous Western and neutral support for the
 Romanians have added to Soviet discomfiture.
 The debate on procedure ended with a com-
 promise fashioned by the Romanians and Soviets
 with French assistance. The Soviets agreed to
 rules that emphasize the non-bloc nature of the
 talks, describe the participants as sovereign and
 equal, and portray the talks as "outside the mili-
 tary alliances." Thus, the Romanians made their
 point, while Moscow, which managed to keep its
 other allies in line, was clearly happy to get over
 that hurdle.
 On  29 November,  the Soviet delegation
 sought to recoup with their general opening state-
 ment. The Soviets, after lobbying hard to speak
 first, reiterated familiar Soviet positions. They
 urged that the security conference itself be held
 in Helsinki in late June and that it begin with a
 meeting of foreign ministers and conclude with a
 summit gathering. They also formally outlined
 the three general topics they want considered at
 the conference: principles of relations between

 states in Europe; development of economic and
 cultural ties; and establishment of a permanent
 body on security and cooperation in Europe.
 The  Romanian  performance has  raised
 questions about relationships within and between
 the two blocs that will recur as the talks proceed.
 The French-the Western mavericks-were pleased
 with the Romanian show of independence. Hav-
 ing shared Moscow's preference for an informal
 agreement on procedure, they were caught off-
 guard, but quickly shifted when it became clear
 that they would be lined up with Moscow and its
 other pact allies against Romania and everyone
 else.
 The Western allies, meanwhile, were testing
 their somewhat ad hoc procedures for coordi-
 nating the positions of NATO and EC representa-
 tives. The French have said that they will not join
 any formal NATO caucus, but that they will
 consult with their EC partners. The NATO repre-
 sentatives,  therefore,  have  held  no  formal
 meetings, though they have held informal con-
 sultations with the French in attendance. At least
 to this point, the blend of EC and NATO discus-
 sions is preserving a cohesive Western front. The
 cohesion will be more severely tested when the
 talks get down to substance.
 Another procedural issue could cause some
 problems. A number of NATO countries-in-
 cluding West Germany, Britain, and Italy-want
 the Helsinki talks to recess prior to the NATO
 ministerial meetings next week and to reconvene 25X1
 in mid-December. Moscow is not happy with the
 idea and, at a minimum, will want any recess to
 be as brief as possible.

 Like cautious fencers probing their oppo-
 nent's defenses, Juan Peron and President Lanusse
 are circling warily, each seeking a clear advantage.
 After two weeks of feinting and parrying, how-
 ever, neither man has gained the upper hand and
 their seconds are beginning to get impatient.
 In fact, a stalemate may have been reached.
 Peron continues to insist on the annulment of the
 25 August residency deadline for candidates in
 the   elections  next  March.  Lanusse  has con-
 sistently rejected this demand  although  he
 softened his position somewhat last week when
 Lanusse  hope  that divisions in the
 other's camp will give them the upper
 hand. Divisions are already visible in
 the interparty working group organized
 by Peron to put pressure on Lanusse,
 indicating that stalling may be a good
 tactic.  Potentially serious differences
 are also reported to be surfacing among
 Peron's own coterie of advisers.
 On the other hand, differences
 have also been apparent within the
 military since Peron set foot on Argen-
 tine soil. These have at least temporar-
 ily been smoothed over by Lanusse's
 adroit handling of recent developments
 and by his regular briefings of military
 commanders.  Nevertheless, the  Pres-
 ident is under pressure from the top
 generals to take a firmer stand against
 Peron, whom the generals blame for
 the lack of progress in talks with the
 political parties.
 While there are many points of
 disagreement  between  Lanusse  and
 Peron, the big sticking point right now
 is the 25 August deadline. The two
 seem to agree that a political accord,
 including an agreement on candidates,
 is within reach, but neither will be able
 to test his strength on matters that
 really count until one or the other
 bends  on  the  residency  re uire-
 ment.

 he said he would reconsider if the request were
 made  unanimously    by  all  political  groups.
 Lanusse is likely to resist any temptation to lift
 the residency requirement as he would risk losing
 the support of the armed forces if he were to lift
 this last remaining legal bar to Peron's running for
 president. It may be just as difficult for Peron, as
 he would risk a serious loss of face if he were to
 give in on this point.
 Much of this political footwork represents
 no more than delaying tactics as both Peron and

 The third party conference on 6-7 December
 will discuss the whole range of youth policy, but
 the current atmosphere in the country suggests
 that Yugoslav youth can expect more stick than
 carrot.
 Party complacency about youth turned into
 serious concern in November 1971 when a strike
 by student nationalists in Croatia touched off a
 major confrontation. Tito demanded corrective
 action  in  January and  after three postpone-
 ments-caused by shifts in the party line and a
 purge this fall-the  League of Communists is
 finally ready to meet. Preparations for the con-
 ference suggested that the regime was willing to
 SECRET
 balance incentives like more high-level party posts
 for youth with increased supervision of young
 people and stricter Marxist standards in educa-
 tion. In the aftermath of the recent purge, how-
 ever, the incentive side will probably be narrow.
 It is unlikely that the party will open its doors to
 any but the most sycophantic members of the
 new generation.
 Participation by young people in the system,
 from self-managing factory units right on up to
 federal bodies, has actually declined over the past
 decade. The younger generation has been frus-
 trated by the firm grip retained by old partisans
 and functionaries. In addition, the party and Tito
 himself have made serious mistakes in dealing
 with youth. After the student riots in Belgrade in
 1968,  promises were made-including one to
 reform the university system-that were generally
 forgotten in the press of other problems. The
 control of mass youth organizations has been left
 to hacks and, in the case of the federal student
 organization, to weak administrators who have
 failed to control nationalist firebrands.
 Bread-and-butter issues are also important
 irritants, and economic regionalism is becoming
 particularly virulent among the younger genera-
 tion. Poor job opportunities, scanty funds for
 improving  the  educational  system,  and  the
 widening  gap   between  rich  and  poor  have
 undermined the regime's relations with its young.
 In some cases, the situation is already explosive.
 In Kosovo, the poorest area in Yugoslavia where
 the average age is 24, there is already considerable
 impatience with the slow improvement in the
 standard of living. In Croatia, over 100,000 young
 people have been forced to go abroad to find
 work, and seven of these returned last summer as
 members of a group of emigre guerrillas intent on
 starting an armed insurrection.

 The North Vietnamese are offering stiff
 resistance to government forces trying to advance
 northward in northern Quang Tri Province. Near
 the coast, heavy shelling and ground attacks early
 in the week forced South Vietnamese Marine
 elements to pull back from forward positions near
 the Cua Viet River. Fresh government units have
 since regained the lost territory and are trying to
 expand their holdings. Heavy rain and flooding at
 week's end are hampering the combat operations
 of both sides.
 In many sectors of the country, the Com-
 munists appear to be relying heavily on terrorist
 tactics to sustain their position at the grass roots
 during the current period of uncertainty about a
 cease-fire. This increased terrorism is carried out
 by local force and sapper units, and the targets
 are mostly soldiers, police, and village officials. A
 Communist mili-
 tary units in Tay Ninh Province have been told to
 avoid significant combat with South Vietnamese
 forces pending new instructions from COSVN but
 to increase low-level activity, including sabotage
 and  terrorism.  These  relatively  inexpensive
 actions are likely to increase in the weeks ahead
 as the Communists seek to rest and refit many of
 their major combat units.
 The  Communists    reportedly  are holding
 meetings of senior officials throughout the coun-
 try to discuss cease-fire preparations and to assess
 local strengths and weaknesses. A princi al aim of
 the meetings,                                is
 to explain the reasons behind the postponement
 of the 31 October cease-fire date and to reassure
 cadre that a settlement is in the offing. None of
 the reports indicates that the Communists are
 working on a firm timetable, and there are signs
 that they are no longer sure how much time they
 will have between an announcement of a cease-
 fire and its implementation.
 the enemy has worked out a three-phase, cease-
 fire scenario. First, prior to the cease-fire an-
 nouncement, senior cadre will be infiltrated into
 hamlets and villages. Second, when the announce-
 ment is made, Communist main and local forces
 will  attempt  to  seize  and  hold villages and
 hamlets. Undercover agents already in place will
 organize pro-Communist demonstrations in the
 cities. During the third phase, which allegedly
 may last several years, the areas under Viet Cong
 control will be organized and "Liberation Front
 Committees" set up.
 There often is a considerable gap between
 Communist intentions and capabilities
 L           Communist commanders reportedly
 have criticized local military and political leaders
 for poor performance and have called for sharp
 improvement. Some reports have suggested that
 the period before a cease-fire offers a good op-
 portunity for local Viet Cong units to strengthen
 their over-all capabilities.
 Throughout these meetings, considerable at-
 tention has been given to the role of Viet Cong
 agents with legal documentation already living in
 government-controlled  areas.  There  is  little
 reliable information on their strength, but their
 record does not give an impression of extensive
 subversive capability.

 No progress was made this week toward a
 Laos settlement at the peace talks in Vientiane.
 At the latest session of the formal talks, the
 senior Communist negotiator in effect rejected
 the government proposal to begin serious discus-
 sions on the basis of the Lao Communists' five-
 point proposals. He sharply criticized the govern-
 ment's interpretation of certain passages in the
 Communist proposals while ignoring a number of
 areas where agreement seems near. This negative
 stance  holds  scant  promise  for  constructive
 dialogue soon and suggests that the Communists
 are content to mark time pending clarification on
 the nature and timing of a Vietnam cease-fire.
 Hopes that the impasse could be broken by
 private talks at a higher level were dampened
 when Communist leader Souphanouvong declined
 an  invitation  from  Prime  Minister  Souvanna
 Phouma to meet at the royal capital in Luang
 Prabang. In an official interview in Sam Neua,
 Phoumi Vongvichit, the Lao Communist special
 adviser to the peace talks, said that Souphanou-
 vong had rejected Souvanna's invitation because
 the present situation did not warrant such a
 meeting. Phoumi indicated, however, that Sou-
 phanouvong eventually might agree to such a
 meeting  if Souvanna were to adopt a more
 "positive" attitude. This rebuff will be taken in
 stride by Souvanna, who still seems convinced
 that a settlement in Laos will closely follow
 agreement on Vietnam.
 Against this backdrop of stalemate, the gov-
 ernment is stepping up its campaign to recapture
 territory in south Laos. Irregular units in the
 central panhandle have pushed east from Dong
 Hene and are now trying to force a  North
 Vietnamese regiment from  Muong  Phalane, a
 town on Route 9. The Communists are putting up
 a strong defense of Muong Phalane to prevent a

 government move toward the Ho Chi Minh trail
 complex farther east.
 To the south, another government force is
 closing on Paksong, the principal town on the
 Bolovens Plateau, which the Communists have
 held for over a year.
 Combat in the Plaine des Jarres area has
 been at a low level for over a week. Enemy trucks
 have been moving supplies to forward units, but 25X1
 there is no evidence of a major enemy logistic
 build-up in preparation for any major attack in
 the Sam Thong - Long Tieng area.

 NEW ZEALAND: NEW LEADER
 The Labor Party has come to power with the largest parliamentary
 majority of any government in 37 years-some 23 seats. Actual differ-
 ences with the outgoing National Party government have been relatively
 minor, and Labor is unlikely to use its comfortable margin in Parliament
 as a mandate for significant departures in domestic programs.
 Foreign policy was not at issue in the campaign, but the new
 administration will make some changes in order to bring national policy
 into line with long-standing Labor positions. The Labor Government
 will probably bring home the small New Zealand training contingent in
 South Vietnam, establish diplomatic relations with Peking, and work
 toward eventual withdrawal of New Zealand troops stationed in Singa-
 pore and Malaysia under the five-power defense arrangement with
 Australia and the UK.
 No significant changes in relations with the US are expected. The

 USSR: FIFTY BIG ONES
 The USSR is preparing to celebrate its 50th
 anniversary as a federated, multi-national state.
 Foreign guests reportedly have been invited to
 attend ceremonies on 21-22 December that will
 be on the grand scale of those for the golden
 jubilee of the Bolshevik Revolution in November
 1967. Brezhnev will probably use the occasion to
 deliver the major speech.
 According to a Soviet journalist, more than
 70 foreign Communist parties and 30 governments
 have been invited to take part. In addition to
 their  East  European  allies,  the Soviets have
 extended invitations primarily to governments
 with which the Soviets have close ties such as
 India, Finland, Iran, and, reportedly, Iraq and
 Egypt. Turkey is the only NATO country to have
 received an invitation thus far. China has not been
 asked. Given the diverse interests represented and
 the Soviet desire to focus on their own national
 accomplishments, it is unlikely that there will be
 much opportunity to transact practical business
 during the holiday.
 Reports that hotel space in Moscow will be
 at a premium as early as 10 December suggest
 that the Kremlin wants to clear its domestic
 docket before the celebrations begin. The Central
 Committee may meet a fews days before the
 Supreme Soviet convenes for its regular winter
 session on 18 December. The Supreme Soviet will
 review the economy's performance during the
 past year and approve the budget and plans for
 1973. A Central  Committee plenum  should
 precede this meeting to give the party hierarchy
 an opportunity to pass on these matters and to
 discuss  pending business such  as Politburo
 candidate member Mzhavanadze's retirement or
 the final preparations for the exchange of party
 cards during 1973-74.
 There has not been a party plenum since
 May, although party statutes require one every six
 months. Brezhnev and his colleagues have been
 careful during the past eight years to keep the
 party  hierarchy  happy  by  holding  plenums
 regularly. Consequently it is likely that they will
 not limit themselves to festive speeches, but will
 hold a working session before  roceedinc with the
 anniversary toasts.                            25X1

 BELGIUM: EYSKENS' FINALE
 Disputes within the Socialist - Social Chris-
 tian coalition over Belgium's endless linguistic
 problem finally forced Prime Minister Eyskens
 and   his  cabinet to  resign on 22  November.
 Eyskens has agreed to head a caretaker govern-
 ment, while Jozef de Saeger, the outgoing minis-
 ter of public works, searches for a workable
 political combination. In any case, the Belgian
 position at the various international meetings
 underway  and projected  is not  likely to be
 affected.
 De Saeger, like Eyskens a Social Christian,
 faces an arduous task, and his prospects are not
 good. Prior to Eyskens' resignation, the cabinet
 tried to no avail for almost a month to draft a
 legislative program that both French- and Dutch-
 speaking  coalition  leaders would accept.  The
 legislation involves cultural and linguistic matters
 and  under  the  recently  revised constitution
 requires a special, large majority in parliament to
 be passed. The Socialist - Social Christian coali-
 tion, even if restored, would still need the support
 Jozef de Saeger
 of opposition deputies for passage of any such
 program.
 Some observers believe that the Flemish fac-
 tion of the badly divided opposition Liberal Party
 might join the government to give it the extra
 votes needed to pass its legislation. The predomi-
 nantly French-speaking Socialists, however, are
 opposed to the idea, probably because it would
 mean the addition of more Flemish deputies to
 the coalition. Most politicians are well aware that
 new elections would be indecisive. The latest polls
 indicate that there would be no significant change
 in parliamentary alignment and that the coalition
 parties and the Liberals would, in fact, suffer
 slight losses.
 De  Saeger  will  probably take soundings
 among party leaders in the hope that Eyskens'
 program can be redrafted. However, de Saeger's
 close identification with Flemish interests will
 hinder his efforts to resolve the most contentious
 issue, the division of the country into three eco-
 nomic regions, Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels.
 French-speaking leaders of both coalition parties
 are arguing that if this program is to be imple-
 mented, then the economic region envisioned for
 Brussels must be broader in territory than the
 linguistic borders set in the constitution. Flemish
 politicians, including de Saeger himself, are ex-
 tremely sensitive on this issue and will resist any
 expansion of the largely French-speaking Brussels
 WEST GERMANY: WAGE BATTLE
 Still savoring its smashing election victory,
 the Brandt-Scheel coalition faces a critical round
 of wage negotiations that will profoundly affect
 the course of the German economy next year.

 representing nearly one third of the German labor

 tiations is crucial to Bonn's hopes for containing
 inflation. The outlook is not promising.
 Now that the election is over and Brandt's
 coalition has gained a significant parliamentary
 majority with the help of labor's votes, the union
 leadership no longer feels constrained about push-
 ing for large wage increases. The leaders will point
 to the more than six-percent jump in the cost of
 living during the past year as justification for their
 demands. The metalworkers of Lower Saxony
 fired the first shot in the campaign, demanding an
 11 percent average wage increase.
 The negotiations with the Public Service and
 Transport Workers Union, to which most govern-
 ment workers belong, will also test Bonn's ability
 and determination to fight inflation. Economics
 and Finance Minister Schmidt has been under
 strong pressure from both the opposition and the
 minority members of the coalition to hold down
 the rapid rise in government spending, widely
 Bonn has not stated what kind of an increase
 would be acceptable, but the figure would not be
 much above the 5.5 percent reflected in tentative
 budget proposals for next year. A larger settle-
 ment  would  boost  federal  expenditures well
 beyond the 10.5-percent increase proposed in the
 tentative budget, or require spending cuts else-
 where. Quite apart from its direct impact on the
 federal government's finances, Bonn's willingness
 to resist excessive wage demands would set an
 example for state and local governments and for
 private business.
 The bargaining in the weeks ahead will be
 difficult. There were strikes last year to enforce
 labor's wage demands in the face of a threatening
 recession and fears of widespread unemployment.
 With  most  economic  indicators  suggesting  a
 renewed upswing in the economy in 1973, the
 unions can be expected to be even more mili-
 tant.                                                                                                                    25X1

 EAST GERMANY: LOOKING WESTWARD
 With ratification of the  inter-German
 political treaty assured by West German Chan-
 cellor  Brandt's  re-election,  East  Germany  is
 stepping up its drive for recognition by Western
 countries and for membership in international
 organizations.
 Pankow's immediate task is to tidy up its
 agreements with Bonn. Pankow will receive a
 high-level  West German representative in East
 Berlin, probably before Christmas. At that time
 the treaty will be signed and timetables for ratifi-
 cation will be discussed along with the exchange
 of diplomatic representatives and the application
 by both Germanies for membership in the UN.
 Because of West German legislative procedures,
 ratification is not expected before next April.
 Simultaneous applications for full UN member-
 ship by the two German states would follow.
 Pankow has already  requested  observer
 status at the UN. The request was granted by
 Secretary General Waldheim on 24 November,
 following East Germany's successful bid to join
 UNESCO earlier in the week. Membership in a
 UN   specialized agency opens the way for
 participation in other international organizations.
 East Germany has also taken a seat-as has
 Bonn-at the preparatory conference on Euro-
 pean security in Helsinki.
 Recognition by the Western powers remains
 a highly desired goal,  and  Pankow  is busily

 encouraging the Allies to hasten the normaliza-
 tion  procedures. Several  quasi-official  delega-
 tions-capped                            this  week by  a parliamentary
 delegation-have been sent to Paris to cultivate
 the French whose interest in East Germany is
 high. Recognition is expected to follow an ex-
 change of views with the other Allies. Pankow is
 also angling for British recognition. Deputy For-
 eign Minister Moldt held informal talks with
 British Foreign Office officials when he visited
 London   last week to sign East Germany's
 accession to UNESCO. Pankow hailed the visit as
 an historic event signaling favorable developments
 in its relations with Britain.
 The East Germans have also launched a
 broad, but still low-key, campaign to spark US
 interest. On 22 November, party leader Erich
 Honecker sought out a US audience by granting
 his first interview to a Western correspondent to
 C.L. Sulzberger of the New York Times. East
 German media have treated the interview as a
 major journalistic event, sort of an opening to a
 dialogue with the US. Other East German com-
 ment has alluded to trade and other advantages
 that would accrue from the establishment of re-
 lations with Washington. One commentator even
 hinted  at  Pankow's willingness to settle the
 potentially  sticky problem of post-war US
 property claims. Widespread coverage is being ac-
 corded the current US visit of Deputy Foreign
 Trade Minister Gerhard Beil, who is speaking with
 various private businessmen.
 Pankow's currying of favor among the
 Nordic states is beginning to bear fruit. Finland
 announced its recognition of both German states
 on 24 November, and Pankow has expressed con-
 fidence that the other Nordic countries will soon
 follow suit. Denmark has announced that it in-
 tends to recognize East Germany following signa-
 ture of the inter-German treaty. The European
 neutrals, principally Austria, are also considering
 early recognition.
 Pankow is aware that the practical rewards
 of its blossoming international status, such as
 broader trade and the acquisition of badly needed
 Western technology, will not be immediately forth-
 coming. Like other Eastern European countries,
 East Germany's economic freedom of maneuver is
 severely limited by its membership in CEMA and
 by its exaggerated fealty to the Soviet Union.
 General recognition by the West may lessen that
 fealty by tempting East Germany eventually to be
 bolder in pursuing its own interests.
 President Ceausescu made a few personnel
 changes at the party plenum on 20-21 November.
 He also won strong support for Bucharest's objec-
 tives at the Helsinki preparatory talks for the
 Conference on Security and Cooperation  in
 Europe and obtained endorsement of an upward
 revision of the 1973 economic plan.
 The most significant change was the long-
 expected removal of Manea Manescu from the
 party secretariat. Except for Ceausescu, Roma-
 nian leaders do not hold top-level government and
 party jobs simultaneously. Manescu's tenure on
 the secretariat came into question when he was
 appointed chairman of the State Planning Com-
 mittee last October. Replacing him was Miron
 Constantinescu, a candidate member of the party
 Executive Committee and probably the most
 liberal of Romania's current party elite.
 The plenum gave Ceausescu a strong and
 open expression of support for Romania's insist-
 ence that all states represented at Helsinki partici-
 pate in the talks as equals. In so doing, Romania
 was underscoring its deep concern that movement
 toward European detente should not be allowed
 to formalize the post-war division of Europe into
 Eastern  and  Western spheres of  influence.
 Romania's hard-fought gains in freeing itself from
 Soviet domination would then be jeopardized.
 Ceausescu received plenum endorsement for his
 contention that force reductions talks, held sepa-
 rately on a bloc-to-bloc basis, would render mean-
 ingless the projected Conference on Security and
 Cooperation in Europe.
 In addition to increasing the goals in the
 1973 economic plan, the plenum considered and
 approved next year's budget, a draft financial bill,
 and a labor code. Ceausescu scheduled another
 plenum for January to examine the progress made

 President Amin's move into the Arab camp
 during the past year has been featured by a
 dramatic  increase  in  the influence of Libya's
 Qadhafi in Kampala.
 Like many of Africa's more radical coun-
 tries, Libya was unhappy with Amin's overthrow
 of the left-leaning Milton Obote in January 1971.
 As time went on, Amin managed to gather some
 legitimacy  and  with  it  acceptance  by  most
 African governments, However, Libya, a strong
 supporter of Obote, remained critical of Amin,
 especially his close ties to the Israelis and the
 presence in Uganda of a 50-man Israeli military
 mission.
 The picture began to change early this year
 when Amin, probably in search of military aid
 and badly needed economic assistance, started to
 make  overtures  to  Arab  capitals,  including
 Tripoli. Amin, a Muslim, traveled widely in the
 Arab world, exchanged delegations, set up em-
 bassies, and pledged support for the Palestinians.
 He began to castigate the Israelis, who were de-
 manding payment for construction projects in
 Uganda. In March, after receiving financial en-
 couragement from some of his new-found Arab
 friends,  notably  Libya, Amin broke with Tel
 Aviv.
 Since then, several Arab countries, including
 Kuwait, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, have provided
 various forms of aid, some of it sizable, but
 Libya's influence with Kampala seems to pre-
 dominate. Libya has promised to provide both
 untied financial support and project aid, to buy
 Ugandan exports, to train troops, and to invest
 directly in the economy. While Qadhafi has yet to
 deliver on many of these undertakings, a Libyan-
 Ugandan bank for foreign trade and development
 has been opened, school and housing construction
 projects have reached the planning stage, and
 Libyan teachers reportedly have been recruited
 for service  in Uganda. Libya's most dramatic
 gesture was the dispatch of some 400 troops and
 quantities  of  military  hardware  to  Uganda
 following an invasion last September by Tan-
 zanian-based                             Ugandan   exiles,  supporters of
 Amin and Arab Friends
 Obote. The move by Qadhafi strengthened
 Amin's army and gained for Qadhafi Amin's
 gratitude.
 Qadhafi, who believes in striking the Israelis
 wherever and whenever possible, doubtless sees
 Amin as an ally in black Africa for the struggle.
 Amin now heaps praise on the Arabs, calls for
 Arab unity against Israel, and stridently con-
 demns the Israelis. He has hosted delegations of
 Palestinian  commandos  and  has  offered  the
 Palestinians the Kampala residence of the ex-
 pelled Israeli ambassador for their headquarters.
 Amin's new-found fervor for the Muslim
 cause carries over into domestic affairs. The coun-
 try's Muslim religious leaders rank among his
 closest advisers. He has recruited large numbers of
 Muslims into all levels of the armed forces.
 Muslims reportedly are getting the nod over Chris-
 tians in government training and jobs, and Amin
 continues to build Muslim schools and mosques.
 This sort of emphasis on Islam is likely to
 add to Amin's already considerable domestic
 woes. Muslims make up only about ten percent of
 the population. Christians, who account for well
 over half of Uganda's ten million people, are

 beginning to show their resentment. Christian ele-
 ments in the army are reportedly dissatisfied with
 Amin's pro-Muslim stance. The presence of
 Libyan troops caused problems. Some Ugandan
 troops deeply resent the Libyans, and there re-
 portedly has been at least one incident of fighting
 between  soldiers from the two countries.
 Ugandan cabinet members and military leaders
 have urged a complete Libyan withdrawal.
 Perhaps in an effort to mute this dissatisfac-
 tion, Amin last week reportedly ordered home at
 least half, or possibly all, of the Libyan troops,
 but he probably has not been dissuaded from
 further strengthening ties to Qadhafi and the
 other Arabs. Indeed there are recent reports that
 Qadhafi has been urging the erratic Amin to
 throw all Christian missionaries out of Uganda
 before Christmas.
 The French President, as he moved across
 Africa, elaborated  the flexible policy of co-
 operation that Paris has adopted to counter rising
 nationalism in its 14 client states in Black Africa.
 In Upper Volta and Togo, he emphasized French
 willingness to accommodate some African de-
 mands in order to preserve the special relationship
 fathered by De Gaulle. Pompidou made it equally
 clear, however, that France would retain final
 control in key areas of the relationships.
 In line with the new policy's provision for
 increasing material  benefits to the Africans,
 Pompidou sweetened  modest aid  increases to
 both countries by announcing the cancellation of
 a pre-independence debt of $195 million owed by
 the 14 former colonies. This gesture, along with a
 promise of lower interest rates and longer repay-
 ment periods, is presumably designed to show the
 Africans how much their privileged relationship
 with France can mean.
 Other statements by Pompidou underscore
 France's renunciation of earlier pretensions to a
 monopoly on assistance to its African clients. In a
 press conference  in  Upper Volta,  Pompidou
 stated  flatly  that  France sought no such
 monopoly and would collaborate with multilat-
 eral  aid  efforts.  Matching word with deed,
 Pompidou's party responded to a Voltan request
 for aid in a manganese project by stating that
 France would limit its role to that of "catalyst,"
 and would try to encourage American or Japanese
 investment and World Bank involvement. This
 increased willingness to encourage other donors-
 especially the US-stems largely from recognition
 that African development demands keep rising
 and that diversification of aid sources is inevitable
 in any event.
 Pompidou has also faced up to the growing
 African demand for revision of the network of
 formal ties to Paris. In this connection, he ex-
 panded earlier expressions of willingness to revise
 the 12-year-old cooperation accords that govern
 each state's relations with France by agreeing to
 move toward changes in the French-controlled
 African franc zone to which all the client states
 belong. Expressing his sympathy with the growing
 African desire for a larger voice in money manage-
 ment, Pompidou indicated that France was pre-
 pared to make more of the zone's foreign ex-
 change reserves available for African economic
 development. He carefully balanced this promise
 by making it clear that Paris would retain ulti-
 mate control and that only those states that exer-
 cised  fiscal  responsibility-as interpreted  by
 Paris-would be permitted to stay in the re-
 structured zone.
 A discordant note was sounded in Togo,
 where President Eyadema startled Pompidou with
 a request for the revision of the parity rate be-
 tween the African franc and the French franc-a
 change that would force France to pay more for
 African exports. Eyadema also asked Paris to use
 its influence with its Common Market partners to
 assure full convertibility of the African franc into
 European currencies and the dollar. Pompidou
 angrily reminded Eyadema that the African franc
 could not exist without French backing. He fur-
 ther stated that Paris would not consider such a
 move unless all the African states jointly re-
 quested the revision. Eyadema may have been
 trying to see how far Paris was willing to go in its
 proclaimed desire for a more flexible, restruc-
 tured franc zone relationship.

 bitter and protracted negotiations on a trade and
 transit agreement were out of the way. The future
 is clouded, however, by the unfavorable reaction
 the new Chinese road project will meet in New
 Delhi. The project would place Chinese tech-
 nicians close to the Indian border. Nevertheless,

 snail's pace of economic development in his back-
 ward kingdom, and the need for an expanded
 road network is crucial. He may be looking for a
 counteroffer from  India
 Sana won the first round in the Yemen unity
 negotiations.  Following a summit  meeting in
 Tripoli this week, Sana's President Iryani and
 Aden's President Ali signed an agreement that
 designates Sana as the capital of the unified state,
 to be called the Yemeni Republic. Iryani prob-
 ably insisted on this concession in order to make
 unity a more salable item to the numerous op-
 ponents of unity back home, and All may have
 concluded that resistance was unwise because the
 summit was held in the presence of Libyan Presi-
 dent Qadhafi, no friend of the Aden regime. All
 may also believe that, having conceded this point,
 Aden now stands to win concessions from Sana in
 later negotiations.
 The union process now moves into a year-
 long series of steps-the drafting of a constitution
 by a joint committee, ratification by the legisla-
 tures of the two Yemens, and a popular referen-
 dum through both Yemens.
 Reconciling Aden's Marxist government with
 Sana's traditionalist one will be far more difficult
 Sana
 A unified capital
 than anything thus far accomplished, and the
 delicate negotiating process will offer numerous
 occasions for the collapse of the whole unity
 concept. Not the least of the complicating factors
 is the opposition to unity in Sana. Many elements
 there are still spoiling for a fight, and they fear
 that unity might take away some of their backers.
 These elements were recently given an excuse to
 fight by an incident on the border that resulted in
 the death, at the hands of Aden-backed tribes-
 men, of two prominent Sana tribal leaders whose
 militant followers will now be intent on revenge.
 President Ali, in the meantime, will return to
 Aden with points on both sides of the ledger. On
 the debit side, he must list the concession to
 Iryani. On the credit side, his talks in Tripoli were
 preceded by a four-day visit to Moscow that re-
 sulted in an economic and technical aid agree-
 ment and a pledge from the Soviets to continue
 to help Aden strengthen its defenses. Aden un-
 doubtedly views this material and moral support
 from Moscow as buttressing its position versus
 Sana, whether or not the unity negotiations go
 forward. The Soviet-Adeni communique made no
 mention of Yemen unity, praising only Aden's
 "efforts ...aimed  at restoring normal  relations
 between the two  parts of Yemen."

 India-Pakistan
 DISAPPOINTED AT LAHORE
 The three-hour meeting on 28 November in
 Lahore between the Indian and Pakistani army
 chiefs was fruitless. It probably marked the final
 effort to reach an agreement on the Kashmir
 border through military channels. The mutual
 decision to refer the matter back to New Delhi
 and Islamabad demonstrates once again that any
 breakthrough in negotiations must be made by
 Prime Minister Gandhi and President Bhutto.
 The two generals met at Pakistan's request,
 but apparently neither came with an authoriza-
 tion to concede claim to the 1.7 square mile piece
 of land, now in Pakistani hands, that stands in the
 way of an agreement. This small strip of land is of
 political rather than strategic importance; Paki-
 stan fears that a concession will weaken its claim
 that Kashmir is still disputed territory. The dis-
 agreement is preventing the mutual withdrawal of
 troops south of Kashmir.
 Disappointment over the meeting is partially
 offset by the prospect of an imminent exchange
 of some prisoners of war and other detainees.
 Wishing to appear reasonable on the eve of the
 General Assembly's consideration of a resolution
 favoring UN membership for Bangladesh, both
 India and Pakistan engaged in a fast-flying series
 of repatriation offers. The first of December is
 the date set for repatriating 540 Pakistani soldiers
 captured on  India's western front during the
 fighting last December and Pakistan's entire lot of
 617 Indian prisoners. Pakistan then can claim it
 no longer holds any prisoners in contrast to the
 continued retention of over 90,000 Pakistani
 prisoners in India. Details are still to be worked
 out on the repatriation of 10,000 Bengali women
 and children Bhutto is allowing to leave Pakistan,
 as well as 6,000 Pakistani women and children
 New Delhi has promised to release.
 Despite this short-range progress, the more
 important question involved the release of the
 bulk of Pakistani prisoners in India, and their
 release remains dependent on Islamabad's recogni-
 tion of Bangladesh. During his just-concluded
 11-day tour of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier
 Province, Bhutto repeatedly spoke in favor of
 recognition, but never committed himself to a

 SILKt           -ftow,
 Last week, US-Panamanian relations were
 strained from a new direction. A labor dispute in
 the Canal Zone between a US-owned bus com-
 pany and its Panamanian drivers turned ugly, and
 17 of the company's 52 buses were seized, driven
 into Panama, and turned over to the National
 Guard. The Torrijos government assured the US
 Embassy that the vehicles would be returned, but
 took no steps to discourage further seizures and
 allowed the matter to drag on. As of 30 Novem-
 ber, only seven of the buses had been returned,
 the government was insisting that no reprisals be
 taken against the drivers involved, and the US
 company had agreed to sell out to -a Panamanian
 bus cooperative.
 The workers had been demanding coverage
 under Panamanian social security and payment of
 the Christmas bonus standard in Panama. In order
 to give weight to their demands, they staged a
 pre-dawn raid on a zone parking lot on 21 No-
 vember, taking 12 buses. Later that day, two
 more buses were seized, this time at gunpoint.
 Additional buses were commandeered later in the
 week.
 The government clearly sympathized with
 the strikers, but adopted a low-key approach,
 giving relatively little publicity to the incidents.
 Torrijos' measured response seemed keyed to his
 differentiation between Panama's relations with
 the US Government and its dealings with Canal
 Zone authorities. Torrijos has tried consistently
 to portray zone officials in the worst possible
 light in order to demonstrate the need for a new
 treaty relationship. He was enjoying their present
 discomfiture, but apparently was not interested in
 provoking a major diplomatic flap at this time.
 The delaying tactics, however, showed govern-
 ment solidarity with the workers and kept pres-
 sure on the US bus company.
 The Panamanian Foreign Ministry has taken
 the position that services provided by the bus
 company have nothing to do with the operation,
 maintenance, or defense of the canal and are
 therefore illegal under the 1903 treaty; the gov-
 ernment favors a take-over of the bus operation
 by a Panamanian firm. The US company, for its
 part, had been interested in selling for some time,
 but had been unable to attract a buyer. Now a
 Panamanian offer has been made and, while all of
 the details have not been settled, the US owner
 has agreed to sell. Torrijos may insist on some
 arrangement providing for immunity from prose-
 cution for the drivers before the remaining buses
 are returned.
 The government's campaign for a Security
 Council meeting in Panama moved another notch
 forward this week with the release of a letter
 from Foreign Minister Tack to Secretary General
 Waldheim. The letter, which was circulated to all
 Security Council members and later given wide
 publicity in Panama, suggested 15-21 March as
 the appropriate time, and stated that a formal
 invitation would be presented in December. With
 the government now publicly committed to the
 meeting, chances are rather slim that Torrijos can
 be persuaded to change his mind unless there
 were a significant breakthrough in the canal nego-
 tiations in the next couple of weeks.

 Havana announced a sweeping reorganiza-
 tion of the top level of government late last week.
 The reorganization bears none of the earmarks of
 a purge and is based on a desire to bring order out
 of Cuba's administrative chaos. All of the key
 figures involved have held high posts for some
 time, and no one seems to have suffered a serious
 demotion. Although ambiguous initial announce-
 ments gave the impression that Raul Castro might
 have been reduced in power, it now appears that
 his position as number-two man remains un-
 changed. Fidel continues to head both the party
 and government.
 The reorganization centered on the Council
 of Ministers, which was expanded from 22 to 27
 cabinet positions. An executive committee was
 created to simplify the management of the en-
 larged body. The reorganization brought under
 one roof the numerous government agencies that
 had previously been operating independently and
 grouped them, together with the pertinent minis-
 tries,  into  eight  administrative  sectors  each
 headed by a vice prime minister. The eight are:
 Major Ramiro Valdes, construction; Major Guil-
 lermo Garcia Frias, transportation and communi-
 cations; Major Pedro Miret Prieto, basic indus-
 tries; Major Flavio Bravo Pardo, consumption and
 services; Major Belarmino Castilla Mas, education,
 culture, and sciences; Major  Diocles Torralba
 Gonzalez, sugar industry; Carlos  Rafael  Rod-
 riguez,  foreign  relations;               President  Osvaldo
 Dorticos, economy and administration.
 Fidel Castro will exercise personal super-
 vision over the security services and several other
 agencies that have not been assigned to the eight
 sectors. A ninth sector is expected to be formed
 eventually to accommodate those agencies now
 under Fidel that pertain to livestock and agricul-
 ture other than sugar. There was no mention of
 Raul Castro other than to describe him as first
 vice prime minister. This places him above the
 eight sector chiefs-or vice prime ministers-and
 presumably means that he is second in command
 of both the country's executive and political ap-
 paratus, the Cuban Communist Party.
 Administrative structures patterned after the
 new Council of Ministers will be formed in the six
 provinces and in some regions-the administrative
 level immediately below the province. These pro-
 vincial and regional councils will have executive
 committees composed of delegates designated by
 the respective vice prime ministers in coordina-
 tion with the local party chiefs. The councils will
 concern themselves primarily with coordination
 and will not have the authority to alter directives
 from above without approval from Havana. This
 rigid centralization of authority indicates that the
 Castro regime has decided to ignore a key facet of
 the criticism  of  its administration offered in
 recent years by several technical experts and for-
 eign observers.
 On paper, the new system is certainly an
 improvement- over the old particularly in the area
 of pinpointing responsibility. In practice, how-
 ever,                                                                  it may turn out to be merely another
 bureaucratic nightmare that hinders rather than
 helps Cuba's economic progress.
 The small Soviet naval force that entered
 Caribbean waters on 26 November will probably
 arrive in Cienfuegos on 1 December. The ninth
 such call to Cuba since 1969, it is the first to the
 island since last spring. The force involves two
 surface combatants-a Kresta-class cruiser and a
 Ka n i n-class  destroyer-plus  an  F-class  diesel-
 attack submarine, a tanker and an intelligence-
 collection ship.
 If the ships follow the earlier pattern, they
 will visit several other Cuban ports and perhaps
 conduct anti-submarine operations with Cuban
 naval units. Previous Soviet naval visits have lasted
 as long as three months, but most average 15 to
 20 days. Two TU-95 naval reconnaissance aircraft
 landed in Cuba last week. The planes then con-
 ducted a reconnaissance of the mid-Atlantic on
 28 November before returning to Havana's Jose
 Marti Airfield. Although these aircraft have flown
 to Cuba during earlier port calls, they have yet to
 conduct  joint  operations with  the  visiting
 ships.

 CHILE: NOT JUST A JUNKET
 President Allende may use his current trip to
 argue that Chile is being pushed to the wall by
 foreign and domestic enemies, leaving him no
 alternative but closer ties with Communist gov-
 ernments.  Flanked  by General  Prats-who, as
 interior minister, became chief executive in Al-
 lende's absence-Allende told a large farewell rally
 in Santiago on 28 November that in his speech to
 the UN General Assembly on 4 December he will
 protest  "unjust aggression" against Chile. The
 President added that rightists responsible for the
 extensive economic damages caused by the recent
 protest shutdown must be punished.
 These damages were particularly serious in
 the already lagging agricultural sector. The new
 agriculture minister has said that next year Chile
 will have to import food worth at least $450
 million, up $50 million from this year. A Chilean
 official is in the US now seeking to buy sub-
 stantial  quantities  of  foodgrains.  This effort
 points  up  Allende's dilemma  in counting so
 heavily on the Soviet aid. He praises that aid
 publicly as generous, but it has thus far been
 minimal,  cautious, and  not keyed to urgent
 Chilean needs.
 While discussing the talks that are to begin
 this month in Washington over renegotiating the
 Chilean debt to the US, Foreign Minister Al-
 meyda emphasized that his government wishes to
 make a determined effort to break out of the
 present impasse in bilateral relations. Almeyda
 said that while Allende's UN speech would "ad-
 dress" Chile's complaints against Kennecott and
 other US corporations, it would distinguish be-
 tween their actions and those of the US Govern-
 ment.
 Regardless  of  Almeyda's statements, the
 tone of Allende's speech on 4 December is likely
 to be less than conciliatory. Much will depend on
 his estimate of Moscow's reaction to his need for
 further economic aid and on whether he feels his
 treatment in the US is commensurate with his
 position.
 PERU: DEALING WITH LABOR
 The creation of a new labor confederation
 by the Velasco regime could be the first in a series
 of initiatives leading up to the promulgation of a
 general labor law. The military government wants
 to eliminate existing labor confederations, both
 the Communist-dominated one and the group
 controlled by the military's archenemy, APRA.
 The plan is to substitute for them a new labor
 group run by Sinamos, the government-controlled
 apparatus designed to build an independent base
 of support for the regime and ensure the "irrever-
 sibility" of its programs.
 This would  be part of the government's
 move toward its goal of a "social democracy of
 full participation," a state of affairs in which
 political parties and labor unions will supposedly
 be obsolete. It seems inevitable that this will bring
 increasing conflict with traditional parties and
 groups, including those that have so far supported
 the Velasco regime.

 Already, an important regime spokesman has
 delivered a scathing denunciation of the Com-
 munists and the Christian Democrats, both gov-
 ernment supporters, while barely mentioning the
 government's usual whipping boys, APRA and the
 extreme left. The speech was by the head of
 Sinamos, General Rodriguez Figueroa. It came in
 response to a charge by the Christian Democrats
 that his organization stoops to infiltration and
 manipulation instead of stimulating, as it is sup-
 posed to, genuine popular participation in revolu-
 tionary programs. He was also responding to the
 Communists' announced intention of opposing
 Sinamos' attempts to undermine labor organiza-
 tions. Rodriguez, whose speech was cleared at the
 highest levels, pointedly declared, "The tradi-
 tional political parties cannot become the politi-
 cal heirs of the revolution."
 The government may have been brought to
 move on the labor scene by the adverse effect of a
 shift in offshore currents on the fishmeal in-
 dustry-a vital source of foreign exchange earn-
 ings. This heightened the government's awareness
 of the economic costs of labor unrest in factories
 and mines. At the same time, government efforts
 to recruit labor leaders apparently are beginning
 to pay off. A new pro-government confederation
 called the Central of Workers of the Peruvian
 Revolution  was created  in  mid-November.  It
 claims to be independent, but actually is govern-
 ment controlled. The regime reportedly will try
 to entice the individual unions to cut their ties to
 other confederations and join the new group.
 If this strategy is unsuccessful, a new labor
 law abolishing the old confederations reportedly
 will be issued early next year. The timing of the
 new law's promulgation remains tentative, and
 efforts at voluntary recruitment may go on well
 beyond the January deadline. Debate within the
 regime on the precise role of Sinamos and future
 policies toward the Communists, APRA, the ex-
 treme left, and the Christian Democrats may not
 be over. The government may not be ready to risk
 the consequences of announcing so radical a
 change all at once. The simultaneous alienation of
 opposition groups and current allies would be
 dangerous since these elements still have consid-
 erable political impact.
 VENEZUELA: STUDENT DISORDER
 The widespread outbreak of student violence
 in the past month appears to have been stirred up
 by leftist political groups.
 Reasons for the outbursts vary from city to
 city and change almost daily: usually the erup-
 tions come over an obscure issue, police react,
 students are detained and hurt, which in turn
 becomes the cause for new demonstrations and
 reactions. The only common theme has been a
 demand, circulating during the past 60 days, for
 the release of "political prisoners." This demand
 has been a favorite theme of leftist political
 groups and, in particular, has been used with
 increasing frequency by the Marxist Movement
 for Socialism, a new party that is attracting wide-
 spread support among leftists and students.
 Officials of the Caldera administration deny
 that there are any "political prisoners" in Vene-
 zuela and claim that this is a line fabricated to
 accord respectability to common lawbreakers. A
 hunger strike by many of those detained by the
 police during the demonstrations has attracted
 public attention and resulted in demands from
 some small leftist parties for a congressional in-
 vestigation of the situation.
 Although ready to counter student violence
 with equal amounts of police power, the Caldera
 government is obviously sensitive to the political
 risks involved in the student unrest and has at-
 tempted to defuse student protests before they
 get started. It has created a special unarmed
 police brigade, trained to draw students into dia-
 logue and presumably to talk them out of taking
 to the streets. The first major use of this Special
 Brigade of Order got off to a bad start when
 students refused to talk and injured some brigade
 members. More recently, however, the brigade
 appears to have had some success in calming stu-
 dents and persuading them to return to classes.
 The level of student dissidence so far does
 not equal that of previous years, but the latest
 outbreaks demonstrate the susceptibility of this
 large and volatile segment of the population to
 political  manipulation  by  extremist  political

 China: A Touch of Paralysis
 Despite the outward appearance of order in China, stability has not been fully
 re-established since the purge a year ago of Lin Piao. The notion that Defense
 Minister Lin Piao, the man chosen personally by party              Tse-tung
 designated successor, could turn against the great helmsman has sharply eroded
 confidence in the country's leadership. The failure to reconstitute the ruling Polit-
 buro and replace the military leaders who went down with Lin, together with the
 general absence of leadership turnouts and authoritative policy pronouncements,
 leaves a clear impression that tensions exist among the surviving leaders-an impres-
 sion that is evidently shared by numerous low- and middle-level cadres in China.
 Moreover, there are signs that a significant number of military men who hold power
 in the provinces may also be purged-a situation that involves real risks for domestic
 political order.
 During this time of uncertainty and strain, Premier Chou En-lai has played a
 pivotal role, seeking to diminish the divisive forces at work while guiding China on
 the road toward political recovery. It is largely through his efforts that the political,
 military and economic machinery has continued to function. On the question of the
 fate of the military leaders in the provinces, for example, Chou seems intent on
 limiting the damage, at least until the wounds of the Lin affair have had time to
 heal. His efforts at moderation are meeting resistance, however, and further clashes
 within the Politburo are by no means out of the question. In such a conflict, Mao's
 role obviously would be a determining factor, and the aging party chairman seems to
 be keeping his options open.
 In view of the magnitude of the problem,
 the regime has achieved notable success in
 managing the aftermath of the purge of Lin Piao.
 Basic social order has been maintained. The
 armed forces have remained stable while the
 regime moved to re-subordinate them to civilian
 party control. The trend toward moderation in
 domestic policies-a trend evident since 1969 and
 one that has wide popular support-has been even
 more pronounced since Lin's departure. In the
 conduct of foreign affairs, Peking has scored a
 succession of triumphs in 1972, the fruit of a
 decision several years ago to pursue a more
 pragmatic and outgoing foreign policy.
 Nevertheless,  the  events  of last autumn
 dramatically shattered the fragile political mosaic
 Special Report
 painfully constructed at the party congress in
 1969, and the leadership has been extremely
 cautious in picking up the pieces. The havoc is
 most evident within the Politburo itself; only 16
 of the original 25 members named in 1969 are
 still mentioned in the official press by name, and
 of these only a dozen appear to be taking part in
 the affairs of state in a meaningful way. The delay
 in reconstituting the Politburo is undoubtedly
 associated with the question of the military's
 proper place in that body.
 While the regime wrestles with this problem,
 the armed forces are without designated leaders.
 Marshal Yeh Chien-ying has been serving as de
 facto defense minister but has not been officially
 appointed to this position. Similarly, no one has
 been named to replace chief of staff Huang
 Yung-sheng, and the vacancies at the top of the

 air force, navy, and logistics services remain un-
 filled. This does not mean that the administration
 of the armed forces has been neglected or that the
 efficiency of the armed forces has suffered se-
 verely; merely that they have been an uncom-
 monly  long time without formally designated
 leaders.
 Because Lin was officially designated Mao's
 successor, Peking must also work out a new for-
 mula for succession and rewrite a substantial
 segment of party history. The idea of a post-Mao
 "collective leadership" has persisted for at least a
 year, and it seems likely that it is the composition
 of this collective, rather than the principle itself,
 that is still at issue. While Peking vacillates, the
 leadership grows older: Mao Tse-tung will be 79
 this month, and Premier Chou is 74.
 Moderates Versus Extremists
 The Lin affair and its sequel make it appear
 that one of the central issues in Peking is civilian
 versus military control. In fact, the issues at stake
 are much more complex. Evidence-some of it
 antedating Lin's demise-indicates that while the
 institutional problem is a real one, the leadership
 has long been deeply divided on a much wider
 range of policy and personnel questions. The
 Cultural Revolution itself, with its bitter factional
 disputes and Red Guard mania, clearly added to
 and intensified personal antipathies, particularly
 between radical leaders who were identified with
 its excesses and those of a more moderate persua-
 sion. It is hard to believe that these antipathies
 have now vanished or that, on any given issue,
 they no longer cut across institutional  lines,
 including the armed forces.
 The actual facts surrounding the demise of
 Lin Piao in September 1971 may never be known
 in detail, but, in any event, it has not ended the
 rivalry between moderate and radical forces at the
 center. The purge removed the leading spokesman
 of radical interests in the armed forces, Lin Piao
 himself. On the other hand, it also claimed as
 victims high-level military officers who had been
 at the opposite end of the political spectrum,
 most notably the former chief of staff, Huang
 Yung-sheng.  Moreover, a campaign against ul-

 traleftists-which had begun in late 1969 and
 evidently was directed by Chou En-lai-has been
 muted since Lin's fall, even though a number of
 extreme leftist figures are still prominent and
 active. For example, Chiang Ching, deputy head
 of the Cultural Revolution Group, which directed
 Mao's purge of the old party apparatus, should
 have been an early target, but as Mao's wife she
 has thus far been immune. Another prominent
 leftist, Shanghai party leader Yao Wen-yuan, con-
 tinues to appear frequently in Peking.
 Despite  the  uneasy  political  equilibrium
 within the leadership in Peking, China's policies at
 home and abroad seem well defined. Rationality
 and pragmatism seem to be the order of the day,
 not only in foreign policy but also in such do-
 mestic areas dear to Mao's heart as education.
 Indeed, some of the present educational policies,
 such as the broadening of the academic cur-
 riculum and the special advantages given to tal-
 ented students, are a virtual repudiation of con-
 cepts Mao himself has advocated in the past.
 From time to time, there are hints in domestic
 media that the move toward moderation is being
 challenged on a selective basis, but these chal-
 lenges have had no visible  impact on policy
 implementation.
 Military Under Fire
 The protracted effort to repudiate Lin Piao
 is almost certainly raising political temperatures
 throughout the country. Since early this year,
 cadres have been studying a succession of docu-
 ments spelling out the alleged details of Lin's
 coup plot. The key item in this series, the so-
 called "571 document," contains Lin's purported
 operations plan. The plan lists not only those
 forces that Lin could count on for support-
 primarily in the air force-but also a number of
 other military units he was attempting to enlist in
 the plot. The implication is strong that there are
 elements within the armed forces whose loyalty is
 being questioned in Peking. The most recent doc-
 ument in the anti-Lin series, issued in early July,
 is more ominous. It suggests that the central
 authorities may be considering moves against a
 wide range of military leaders and that the au-
 thorities will not in the future wait for written
 evidence to move against such individuals.

 Some members of the leadership may in fact
 be exploiting the Lin affair to bring down the
 military leaders of the provinces. This impression
 has been reinforced in recent weeks by the failure
 of a number of provincial military leaders to
 make public appearances and by reports that
 some of them have been arrested for their alleged
 support of Lin. The continuing denunciation of
 Lin and the accompanying "rectification" move-
 ment within the party and the army appear to
 have Mao's consent. One report claims that im-
 mediately after Lin's fall, Mao advocated a purge
 on the scale now being pursued. Indeed, the chair-
 man himself could well be a prime mover in the
 reported arrests of the provincial leaders.
 If a move against these leaders is under way,
 even on a selected basis, it risks jeopardizing do-
 mestic political order. The Cultural Revolution
 dismantled the old party and government bu-
 reaucracies, leaving the military as the best avail-
 able unified instrument of control. Efforts have
 been made to re-establish the civilian party struc-
 ture and to reassert the party's leading role, but
 military leaders still hold the balance of power in
 the  party  apparatus  in  many places outside
 Peking.  Thus,  a    move against these military
 leaders, particularly if widespread, could con-
 ceivably cause a breakdown in control, since no
 alternative mechanism is available to fill the void.
 This consideration could help explain why Peking
 is moving with such caution in this matter.
 Paralysis in the Provinces
 The political uncertainty generated by the
 protracted anti-Lin campaign is having a notice-
 able effect on life in China's provinces. With the
 memory of past "rectification" campaigns vivid in
 their minds, officials at the local level are showing
 a marked tendency to sit tight, procrastinate, or,
 if forced to go forward, to move with extreme
 care.
 other leaders in the province did little more than

 Han returned with no visible diminution of au-
 thority, lesser officials reportedly remain reluc-
 tant to commit themselves for or against him. In
 other provinces where the top leaders are in
 danger of removal, it is likely that a similar
 ambivalence exists.

 levels is likely to continue until the leaders at the
 center resolve their fundamental policy and per-
 sonnel problems.
 Chou and the Military
 Throughout the Cultural Revolution, it was
 not Lin Piao, the defense minister, but Chou
 En-lai, with no official military title, who kept
 the  armed   forces generally united and  loyal
 during a period of extreme stress. It was Chou
 who arranged the tenuous, but nonetheless work-
 able, compromise agreements on the leadership in
 numerous provinces. It was Chou who flew to
 Canton in April 1967 to reassure a jittery Huang
 Yung-sheng, then an important regional figure,
 that he was safe from Red Guard onslaughts. It
 was Chou who traveled to the embattled city of
 Wuhan in July 1967 to convince the rebellious
 commander there to release his high level captives
 and submit to central authority. In short, Chou
 became closely identified with the interests of the
 regional and provincial military leaders. Most of
 these leaders were of moderate persuasion.
 Special Report
 Given this background, it is not suprising to
 find that in 1972 Chou is again being linked with
 efforts to protect harassed militar  admini
 in the provinces.
 ou intervened with Mao to limit the
 military purge on the grounds that a wide-ranging
 attack  on  the  military  establishment  would
 adversely affect both  stability     at home and
 China's image abroad.
 An example of how a provincial luminary
 can be buffeted about is provided by the case of
 Liu Hsing-yuan, a career military officer who ran
 Kwangtung Province until March of this year. At
 that time, reports began to circulate that Liu, a
 close associate of purged chief of staff Huang
 Yung-sheng, was being transferred to the top
 party post in Szechwan Province in southwest
 China. His transfer to Szechwan would serve two
 objectives: it would separate him from his south
 China power base, thus carrying out the logical
 extension of Huang's purge; at the same time, it
 would preserve his prestige, because his assign-
 ment would be an even more responsible post.
 Similar stratagems were used by Premier Chou
 during the Cultural Revolution on the behalf of
 embattled provincial chiefs, and it is easy to see
 his hand at work in Liu's case. This assumption is
 supported by the appearance of Chou in Canton
 in April at the public installation of Liu's suc-
 cessor in Kwangtung. Liu himself disappeared
 from the scene, and rumors were about that he
 was under house arrest in Peking. In Canton, the
 capital of Kwangtung, the stories of Liu's arrest
 apparently  created  unrest;  according  to  one
 report, someone tried to assassinate his replace-
 ment.
 After remaining in the shadows for seven
 months, Liu Hsing-yuan showed up again last
 week in Szechwan. He was identified only as a
 "leading member" of the Szechwan hierarchy,
 but the fact that he gave the major speech for the
 occasion will be a signal to many that he is or will
 be the province chief. This sequence of events
 suggests  that  Liu's  transfer  may  have  been
 opposed by those seeking to reduce the influence
 of moderate elements within the military estab-
 lishment. The length of his absence from view
 could mean that Chou, if in fact he pushed for

 Liu's transfer, had some difficulty getting his way
 even though he finally prevailed.
 Chou, in any event, can be expected to have
 a realistic view of the dangers inherent in trying
 to reduce the army's political role too abruptly.
 He is apt to urge caution at every step along this
 path. The moderates among the provinical mili-
 tary figures would appear to have nowhere else to
 turn if they are to make their voices heard in
 Peking.
 The Militant Madame
 Many of the fires that Chou has been called
 upon to put out in the last six years were lit by
 Mao's wife, Chiang Ching. On at least one oc-
 casion, she herself was burned. In July 1967, at
 the height of the Wuhan confrontation, Chiang
 Ching urged that her militant Red Guard groups
 be armed in order to defend themselves against
 the repressive actions of the conservative military

 leaders in the provinces. Chaos ensued, and by
 September 1967 Madame Mao was obliged to
 back down and disavow her slogan, "arm the
 masses."
 Since 1969, most of the extremist policies
 associated with the madame and other Cultural
 Revolution  leaders  have  been  discarded,  but
 Chiang Ching continues to be accorded a high
 place among the party elite, preceded only by
 Mao and Chou. While there are reports that her
 activities have been restricted to the cultural
 sphere, some officials probably see her current
 exalted political status as a sign that she has the
 potential to stir things up again. Indeed, there is
 some reason to believe that Chiang Ching may
 have tried to pull a political cloud over the for-
 tunes of Liu Hsing-yuan.
 On the basis of what is known about their
 behavior in the Cultural Revolution, Chou and
 Chiang Ching probably differ sharply today not

 only on the question of the fate of military
 province chiefs but also on a number of other
 important personnel and policy matters. Since the
 Cultural Revolution ground to an end, the two
 have been able to mask these differences from
 public view, but on several recent occasions for-
 eign visitors to China have detected what they
 believed to be considerable impatience and an-
 noyance on the  premier's part at Chiang Ching's
 behavior. The fact that Chou and Madame Mao
 are poles apart temperamentally as well as politi-
 cally does not mean that they are in permanent
 and implacable opposition on every issue; nor
 does Chiang Ching appear to be in a position to
 challenge Chou directly. Chou, for his part, is in
 no position to put the madame down completely
 as long as she retains Mao's patronage.
 As has been the case at times in the past,
 Mao's role in China's recent internal affairs is
 Special Report
 obscure. In some respects, he has removed himself
 from the public stage. He has not presided over a
 major public gathering since the funeral of the
 late foreign minister Chen I in January 1972 and
 has not appeared on the rostrum at Tien An Men
 Square in Peking since May 1971. The chairman's
 periodic meetings with foreign visitors in his
 private residence indicate that his mental and
 physical condition are probably not the reason
 for his reduced public activity.
 The pattern of Mao's recent activities, in
 fact, is reminiscent of earlier periods in which he
 engaged  in  intense  behind-the-scenes  maneu-
 vering, either to shore up his own position or to
 plot the next move against real or fancied op-
 ponents. It could be, for example, that Mao is
 personally   directing  the  anti-Lin campaign,
 viewing it as an opportunity to settle scores with
 a number of provincial military leaders, primarily
 those  whose  opposition  to  the  Red    Guard

 movement led to a closing out of the Cultural
 Revolution  before  it had accomplished all of
 Mao's objectives.
 On the other hand, the chairman must rec-
 ognize that his close personal identification with
 Lin renders him vulnerable in important ways.
 The  571  document contains unusually harsh
 words about Mao's leadership. It accuses him of
 imposing ill-conceived and unpopular domestic
 programs  and  characterizes  him  as  a  "cruel
 tyrant." This attack on the chairman is attributed
 to Lin, and it has been circulated with Mao's
 explicit approval. Still, the effect has been to give
 wide publicity to a list of grievances against Mao
 with which many officials can identify. Indeed,
 there are signs that the regime-and perhaps Mao
 himself-are taking steps to disassociate the chair-
 man from the Cultural Revolution experience. A
 letter now circulating officially seems designed to
 show that Mao was opposed to Lin Piao and that
 Piao was less than enamored with "leftists" in
 general as early as 1966. This hardly seems to
 conform with the facts.
 The 571 Document on Mao's Leadership,16 January 1972
 (Mao) is the greatest dictator and tyrant in the history of China.
 The days of B-52 (this reference is clearly to Mao) are numbered. B-52 has consistently
 adopted the tactics of "divide and rule"; he is very cunning and treacherous and very rarely leaves
 his residence.
 Nobody has ever been able to work with him from beginning to end. Today you are his guest
 of honor, but tomorrow you will be his prisoner.
 He is a suspicious and cruel maniac.
 His several secretaries and some people who were close to him were either killed or locked up
 and struggled against.
 The struggle in the party has come to typify his personal likes and grudges.
 The leadership of the ruling group has fallen into corrupt, decadent, ignorant, and inefficient
 hands.
 The troops are under pressure, and dissatisfaction is widespread among cadres of the middle
 and upper ranks.
 Initially the Red Guards were hoodwinked into serving as cannon fodder, but now they are
 being suppressed, criticized, and repudiated. The sending of intellectual youth to the mountains or
 the countryside is just another form of labor reform.
 Cadres sent to the countryside are just swelling the ranks of the unemployed.
 The living standard of workers and peasants is falling; the freezing of the wages of the
 workers, particularly young workers, has increased dissatisfaction.
 The socialist system in China is now being threatened in a serious manner.

 At the same time, there has been a marked
 de-emphasis in Mao's role as the party's theo-
 retical guide. Propaganda organs in China are
 reverting to more orthodox ways of justifying
 policy; namely, invoking the authority of the
 "party line" rather than citing passages from
 chairman Mao's works. Mao himself has given
 personal approval to a general playing down of his
 "cult," however, and speculation within-and out-
 side-China that Mao is losing his grip and is
 about to step down is at best premature.
 The Coming Months
 At this juncture, these domestic headaches
 seem containable. Provincial military leaders are
 not being faced, either collectively or individ-
 ually, with the massive public attacks and orches-
 trated violence that were a leitmotif of the
 Cultural Revolution. Premier Chou's concern for
 the loyalty of the armed forces to the political
 system is surely as great as his concern for the
 cohesion of the military establishment. On both

 scores, he is likely to attempt to limit the damage
 rather than place himself at the head of a group
 determined to end the pressures against the mili-
 tary, especially if such a stance would involve
 open defiance of Mao.
 Mao's motives in the present situation are
 less predictable. He was stung by the army's
 equivocal role in the Cultural Revolution, and
 vindictiveness on his part could be a major factor
 in the current drive to unseat the provincial mili-
 tary. Mao presumably is aware of the disruptive
 influence of his wife, but he seems unwilling to
 put a stop to all her activities. On the other hand,
 the chairman's willingness to support relatively
 conservative and pragmatic policies at home as
 well as abroad seems to indicate that he is not
 preparing for another major political offensive at
 this time. Mao seems intent on establishing a
 better balance between competing leftist and con-
 servative forces-and hence enhancing his own
 maneuverability-by whittling away at the pre-
 dominantly conservative military leaders in the
 provinces through a process of linking them, how-
 ever tenuously, to Lin Piao.
 Mao may not be content for long merely to
 whittle away. His seeming lack of activity and the
 surface calm in China may again only be the
 reassuring  backdrop  an old magician artfully
 develops before he unveils his next startling trick.
 A hint as to what it will be may have been
 provided  in  appointments  recently  made  in
 Peking. While most of the new appointees are
 conservatives who were under attack during the
 Cultural Revolution, there are two notable excep-
 tions. The elevation of these two leftist veterans
 of the Cultural Revolution points to the possi-
 bility of yet another leftward swin  of
 nolit-
 ical  pendulum.
