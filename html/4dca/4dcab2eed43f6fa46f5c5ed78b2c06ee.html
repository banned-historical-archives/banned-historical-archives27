 THE LIFE AND WORK OF STEPHAN HALLER
 Patrick R. Beller
 This true biography of an intelligence officer is doubly
 a study in intelligence: it shows how a goodly endowment
 of intellectual equipment, the honing of scholasticism,
 and a catholic diversity of interests and experience pro-
 vide none too elaborate a base for intelligence work, but
 indeed create the potential for extraordinary success.
 Haller's contributions to U.S. intelligence began in war,
 with the OSS. Often unorthodox in his methods but al-
 ways effective in his stubborn onslaught on the work as-
 signed him, he lived a career that is now part of the tradi-
 tion of the U.S. intelligence service, a tradition that he
 and many of his colleagues have been building since the
 days of World War II.
 Stephan Haller-scholar, mathematician, and political
 activist-was not the model intelligence officer, because
 there is no such thing. The job is so vast that in addition
 to that first requisite-brains-all kinds of persons and
 talents are needed.  But Haller combined more talents
 than most men-combined them and controlled them, so
 that even seemingly disparate traits were fitted together.
 He was a thoughtful and sensual, purposeful and humane
 man.
 But trying to measure him is like trying to measure
 other natural forces, like explaining a storm as so many
 foot-pounds of wind-thrust. He was more than a sum of
 attributes.
 Stephan Haller was not his real name.'  He did not
 want publicity or acclaim; he wanted to do his job. Those
 of us who knew him know that he would not only have
 chosen anonymity; he would have insisted on it for opera-
 tional reasons.  His identity and character merged with
 the work to which he was devoted, shaping it and shaped
 by it.  The work is his memorial. And because we share
 in the work, we also share in his story.
 A pseudonym is used here because his contacts are still active and
 several of his operations continue to be of a sensitive nature.

 . Stephan Haller
 Stephan Haller was the second of two sons born to a middle-
 class family of German Jews.  Manfred and Margarete Haller
 were living in Frankfurt am Main with their three-year-old
 Emil in 1906, the year of Stephan's birth.  Later a daughter,
 Sara, was born.  Manfred Haller was a Rabbi.   In 1916, after
 Stephan had finished grammar school, the family moved to
 Kassel.  Graduation from Mittelschule at the age of ten is
 unusual in Germany; young Stephan was a good student.
 From 1916 to 1924 he continued his studies in Braunschweig,
 and two years later he took his first degree, a BS, at Marburg/
 Lahn.    The next five years were spent at a number of uni-
 versities inside and outside Germany. The young man's stud-
 ies showed the breadth of his interests.  He became skilled
 in mathematics and statistics, physics, psychology, sociology,
 and political science; and he read widely in other subjects.
 His father was lean, bearded, and strictly orthodox, whereas
 Stephan's broad interests and his studies in the sciences had
 increased his natural curiosity and his scepticism. The result
 was frequent clashes between father and son.  But although
 Stephan argued from materialistic concepts, one of his closest
 friends has said that later in his life he was deeply religious,
 a fact he tried to conceal.  In any event, the Rabbi and his
 younger son were never intimate in their association.
 Margarete Haller died in 1923, when Stephan was seventeen.
 Ten years more, and the Nazis were to put his father in a con-
 centration camp. Later the Rabbi, his daughter, and his older
 son all managed somehow to reach South America.  Stephan
 found a different course.
 Politician and Propagandist
 European students have always been more precocious in
 political life than their American counterparts. Young Haller
 associated himself with the Social Democratic Party when he
 was nineteen, and soon became very active in its student
 groups.  From 1925 until 1933, when he was forced to flee
 Germany, he was much occupied with politics and the educa-
 tional programs of the German labor movement.  For several
 of those years he was chairman of the Social Democratic Stu-
 dents' Movement at the University of Frankfurt and a member
 of the movement's national board of chairmen. He was also

 district leader of this movement for southwest Germany,
 which included the Universities of Marburg, Frankfurt, Gies-
 sen, Heidelberg, and Munich, as well as the Polytechnic Insti-
 tute at Darmstadt.  At the same time he took part in the
 educational program of the German labor unions, serving
 both as educational director and as teacher at various large
 plants, including I. G. Farben, throughout Hesse.
 Haller also became intensely and practically interested in
 the theory and uses of political propaganda. It was this inter-
 est that brought him into intimate contact with Kurt Schu-
 macher, Ollenhauer, and other leading Socialists.  He became
 a member of the SPD Propaganda Committee for Hesse, which
 worked under the direction of Reichstag Deputy Dr. Carlo Mier-
 endorff.  For three years, from 1930 to 1933, this committee
 maintained a continuous survey and analysis of the effect
 upon the German people of the propaganda of all the political
 parties. The purpose of the survey was to improve SPD propa-
 ganda and reduce the effectiveness of that of all opponents.
 Stephan Haller's education thus drew a little closer to his
 future work.
 During the same period he put his analyses to use, appear-
 ing as the SPD speaker at nearly a thousand political rallies
 held all over Germany.  About half of these were meetings of
 nationalistic groups: the Stahlhelm, the German National
 Party, and of course the NSDAP, the Nazis. He sharpened his
 wits and skills in debate against men whose names were later
 heard in intercession and anathema-Goebbels, Hitler's propa-
 ganda chief; Baldur von Schirach, Nazi youth leader; Dr.
 Franz Seldte, founder of the Stahlhelm.  Selected as a dele-
 gate to the SPD's national convention, he twice ran unsuc-
 cessfully for office, once for the Hessian Landtag and once
 for the Reichstag.  Politics is not an easy life anywhere; it
 was a hard and rewarding school for a young Jew in the tur-
 bulent pre-Hitler Germany.
 A statement written by Haller for the OSS in early 1944
 includes this comment:
 I shall not dwell upon the fact that in the course of the
 above mentioned activities, I could not fail to acquire a rather
 thorough knowledge of the German party system as a whole,
 of the structure, history, methods of propaganda and action
 of the German national parties, particularly the Nazi Party,

 the German National Party, and of the leagues and associa-
 tions either connected to or collaborating with them; as well
 as, to a certain extent, a personal knowledge of many known
 leaders of these organizations.
 He also learned how to assess people and how to deal with
 them, when to be friendly and kind and when to be hard or
 austere, whom to praise or reassure and whom to treat with
 just the right degree of that superciliousness so effective with
 certain Germanic types.  His convictions gave him reason to
 act; his studies and political research had taught him how;
 and now experience was teaching him the hardest lesson,
 when to act.
 Adolf Hitler became Reichschancellor on 30 January 1933.
 The night before the Reichstag fire, on 27 February, Haller
 made a pungently anti-Nazi speech at Darmstadt.  Two days
 later the SS storm-troopers came to the Haller home.  They
 did not find Stephan.  A young student of his, a girl, had
 somehow learned what was coming and had warned him. The
 troopers smashed up the household, arrested the Rabbi, and
 hauled him off to the Sammellager.
 The Wandering Jew
 For six months Haller lived and worked underground with
 anti-Nazis in southwest Germany, the Ruhr, and Berlin.  In
 September he escaped into Luxembourg.  Here he continued
 his anti-Nazi work until the German government pressured
 the small duchy to arrest him and return him.  A warrant
 for his arrest was issued, but he escaped again, to the Saar,
 which was then administered by the League of Nations.
 (Much later, at the war's end, Haller went back to Luxem-
 bourg with the American forces.  He looked up the chief of
 police and identified himself: he understood, he said, that a
 warrant for his arrest and extradition was outstanding.)
 He stayed in the Saarland until 1935, when it was returned
 to Germany.  When the Nazis marched in he walked out, to
 Paris.  There he resumed, at the Sorbonne, his studies in
 statistical mathematics, sociology, and political science.  He
 became a volunteer statistician for the Pasteur Institute and
 a member of the National Center of Scientific Research, a
 branch of the French Ministry of Education.  He was offered
 an assistant's post at the Institute of Atomic Physics of the

 University of Lyon, despite the fact that in 1934 and 1935
 France was suffering from unemployment, employed aliens
 were required to have work permits, and there were many
 times more refugees than permits.
 When World War II started, all German aliens in France
 were arrested and confined in a detention camp.  Soon there-
 after Haller and some fifty other German and Austrian sci-
 entists were released and formed into a curious organization
 known as the Prestation Savante (Service of Scientists), or-
 ganized by the French Ministry of War and attached to the
 University of Montpellier, where they worked under the orders
 of the Ministers of War and Education. The organization was
 semi-military, and the scientists were dressed in a compromise
 between soldiers' uniforms and the garb of monks.  During
 this period Haller made friends with a number of fellow-sci-
 entists whom he later recruited and used as agents.                                      Precisely
 what work was done by the Prestation until the fall of France
 is not clear now.
 When France went under, Haller fled again.  Both the Ge-
 stapo and the Vichy militia were looking for him.  There was
 a price on his head.  He went south, to the unoccupied zone.
 During his long sojourn there he became fluent in French
 and improved his accent sufficiently to pass as a Belgian.
 After the Franco-German armistice, the French set up nu-
 merous depots at which French military personnel could be
 demobilized upon request.  Their proof of bona fides was the
 uniform; upon discharge they were given a few thousand
 francs and a civilian suit.  Haller managed to go through
 the process three times in three different towns, living in
 each on his severance pay.
 Finally picked up and placed in a camp for demobilized
 French soldiers, he escaped and made his way to the Ameri-
 can Consulate in Marseilles, where he obtained an Emergency
 Intellectual Visa to the United States.  After a brief delay in
 Spain in the summer of 1941, he reached New York via Cuba
 on a refugee ship. He arrived in wretched physical condition.
 Rebel in Uniform
 Ten months later, at Fort Dix, New Jersey, he was inducted
 into the United States Army.  The Haller legend has it that
 some difficulty with the military psychologists ensued: asked

 by one of them if he could sing, he replied with a fortissimo
 rendering of Die Wacht am Rhein.  This opening scene fore-
 shadowed some later events.  Assigned as a student to an
 army engineering school in Kentucky, he was placed in an
 elementary class.  The instructor made frequent errors, and
 Haller's helpful corrections were appreciated neither by the
 teacher nor by the commanding officer. The latter had Haller
 on the carpet and informed him incisively that he was not
 the assistant instructor.  Haller explained that he did not
 know anything about the army but did know mathematics,
 whereas the instructor's specialties were obviously the reverse.
 A compromise was effected: he was to remain silent in class
 in exchange for a nightly pass.
 From September 1942 until April 1944 he was assigned to
 five different Army posts, usually instructing in the opera-
 tion of a computer, while the OSS was frantically looking for
 men who knew Germany well.  At last an IBM run turned
 up Stephan Haller; he knew the language, had detailed area
 knowledge, was a well-known SPD member, knew important
 personages.  Almost all the holes in the card were in the
 right places.
 The OSS brought him to Washington and gave him intel-
 ligence training. In June 1944 he was shipped to London and
 assigned to the labor division of the BACH section, an organi-
 zation which supplied cover stories and documents for agents
 working behind enemy lines.  In August he was transferred
 to a forward combat area in France.  He served with one of
 the first OSS field detachments that accompanied the armies
 from the Normandy landings to the war's end. These detach-
 ments provided liaison from G-2 to OSS headquarters, ran
 border crossers, recruited spies from POW cages, briefed and
 debriefed agents, and performed many other intelligence
 tasks. Haller's exceptional capabilities led to his being recom-
 mended for a commission. The recommendation included the
 following job description:
 Haller is in charge of all BACH research work at Field Base C
 and acts as immediate assistant to the CO in all intelligence
 operations.... He  (a)  questions  officials . . . interrogates
 prisoners of war, deserters, and escaped foreign workers .. .

 System, Travelling in Germany, . . . Priorities in German War
 Production ... (d) supervises the work of six other members
 of the detachment.. . .
 When Haller's commanding officer was told to have him
 ready to appear before an ETOUSA commissioning board, he
 was advised to ensure that "Haller's actions in front of the
 board be strictly military," and to be sure that the candidate
 could salute and about-face correctly, that his uniform was
 neat, clean, and pressed, and that his buttons shone. Perhaps
 the candidate was aided less by the coaching than by his rec-
 ord.                                  At any rate, on 20 April 1945, Stephan Haller was com-
 missioned a second lieutenant in the Army of the United
 States.
 For the next few months his principal task was to interview
 prospective agents and work out their cover stories.  Supple-
 menting his intimate knowledge of German, Germans, and
 Germany was his painstaking care in details, an incisively
 logical mind, and a quiet devotion to duty.  He went from
 Verdun to Luxembourg to Belgium.  In May his unit moved
 to Wiesbaden, where his pay and allowances were further in-
 creased by two free bottles of champagne each month.
 In Wiesbaden, where the unit was known as "Field Base C"
 or "Triangle," Haller located old SPD friends and began to pick
 up the broken threads of German politics, while at the same
 time busy with counterintelligence work.  During this period
 he established the unorthodox operational pattern which he
 usually followed afterwards.  He installed himself in a house
 well away from the base, living alone and working with his
 agents there.  This pattern of activity was threatened with
 abrupt termination by an order from Security that he be
 separated, but his commanding officer and others who knew
 him well obtained a reversal. During the argument over this
 order the acting chief of the area wrote, "We have no one in
 Europe today who has his scientific background," and fore-
 cast for him a brilliant career.
 The prediction proved right.  In the years after the war
 Haller obtained extremely valuable political and scientific
 technical intelligence.  Although promoted to first lieutenant

 in 1946, he asked to be given civilian status, and in July 1947
 became an employee of CIG.  He was graded at CAF-11 and
 paid $4,902 annually-a bargain if there ever was one.  By
 this time he was established at Hochheim am Main, an im-
 posing mansion-almost a castle-with marble halls and
 statuary, walls covered with damask and leather, and a cellar
 full of champagne.  Thus ensconced in "Schloss Haller,"
 which was listed in official records as a political research cen-
 ter, he began to exploit the intelligence potential of the SPD
 against East Germany and the USSR and to follow French
 activity in the French Zone of Germany and even in France
 itself.  This second task, apparently carried out through
 friends made during the days of his exile, produced almost the
 only information available about Socialist activity in France
 and won him an official commendation.
 The three years that Haller spent in Hochheim were prob-
 ably the happiest of his life.  The talents with which he was
 born, the scope and depth of his formal education, and the
 diversity of his international experience, both civil and mili-
 tary, now came into focus.       He was working hard.  At times
 he did not leave his apartment on the second floor of the
 "Schloss" for two or three weeks in a row.  He held intense
 political discussions with visitors, many of whom were not
 agents but unwitting sources, friends and acquaintances who
 had known him as an SPD leader and who were more than
 willing to help him in the "political research" which he was
 now doing for the Americans.  Among his visitors were Schu-
 macher, Ollenhauer, Heine, and other German Socialist lead-
 ers.                       In fact, Haller even arranged formal meetings of the
 SPD Party Directorate in his quarters.  The result of these
 meetings and discussions was unexcelled political reporting.
 Hard as he worked, Haller also found time for fun and
 games.  He was popular with both his colleagues and the
 townspeople, from the Mayor down.  He always sat at the
 Mayor's table at civic festivities and was in demand as a dance
 partner among the wives of the local dignitaries.  He drank
 and smoked with zeal, but few people claim to have seen him
 the worse for alcohol.  His cellar was kept well stocked with
 champagne and the still wines of the Rhine and Moselle.  He
 even had a false bottom installed in his car, so that whenever
 his driver was sent to the French Zone he could smuggle back

 a few dozen bottles of Hoch.  And his major domo, Kurt, was
 sometimes detailed to escort one or another fair young lady
 to the Schloss of an evening and drive her home again the
 next morning.
 His pleasure in the present did not keep him from planning
 for the future.  He suggested to his superiors that for opera-
 tional purposes he renounce the U.S. citizenship acquired
 through military service and become a German again.  He
 would then re-enter the SPD and thus give the newly estab-
 lished Central Intelligence Agency a high-level penetration
 of one of the two most important political parties in Germany.
 This position would make him an ideal agent, he felt, for both
 intelligence collection and political action.  It would not be
 suspected that his renunciation of American citizenship and
 renewal of old ties were not genuine; the same thing had been
 done by others, including a former mayor of Hamburg.  But
 Haller also made conditions. He wanted to keep his U.S. pass-
 port-he was quite proud of being an American-and he
 wanted assurances that when the time came he could return
 to the United States, his citizenship reactivated.  This pro-
 posal was not accepted.  He frequently referred to it in later
 days as a missed opportunity.
 Haller was intuitive as well as logical. He had a remarkable
 ability to smell out Communist penetrations of the various
 civil governments set up in the German states.  He felt sure,
 for example, that the Minister of the Interior for Land Hesse,
 Hans Venedey, was a Communist; and with his customary
 pertinacity he set out to prove it. His efforts led the Military
 Governor to complain to Hailer's superior: he "had a good
 little government going there and Haller was upsetting it."
 It seems apparent that Haller then had a talk with the SPD
 leadership, for Venedey was expelled from the SPD for acts
 injurious to the party.  He re-emerged as a functionary of
 the German Communist Party.
 From Politics to Science
 In March 1949 CIA headquarters for Haller's area moved
 from Heidelburg to Karlsruhe, and Haller set up shop in an-
 other castle, at Pforzheim.  In part his work here was a con-
 tinuation of the three years at Hochheim. His old SPD friends
 continued to visit him and furnish valuable political informa-

 tion.  These visits also gave him a chance to explain his own
 views, which were of course those of the U.S. Government,
 and thus to combine intelligence collection with political ac-
 tion. But some of his duties were new. Because of his scien-
 tific background, he was placed in charge of a U.S. program
 for paying subsidies to German scientists, part of a much
 larger operation designed to deny German scientific talent to
 the Soviets.  This assignment required him to establish and
 maintain a new cover, one suited to its purpose.
 In 1951, his cover well established, he was shifted to Berlin,
 there to direct operations against scientific targets in the
 East Zone of Germany.  As usual, he took a house which
 served as both living quarters and base of operations.  He
 responded to the tighter operational environment by intensi-
 fying personal control.  He rarely went to parties now.                             He
 refused to let anyone else handle his agents, even when he
 was ill.  He did not like to put on paper the mass of informa-
 tion accumulated in his head.
 He began work, with others, on an operation designed to
 hinder the Soviet atomic energy program by inducing large-
 scale defection among German specialist craftsmen in the
 East Zone.  These workers made the fine nickel wire mesh
 used for the essential separation of uranium isotopes.  The
 scheme worked; technicians and their families defected in
 droves and were flown to West Germany.  But Haller was dis-
 appointed to learn later that the Soviets were only inconven-
 ienced, not thwarted.  The vanished craftsmen were replaced.
 His own part in the operation, however, was well done, and
 in April 1951 headquarters sent him a congratulatory wire.
 One of his chiefs at about this time took written note of his
 lone-wolf tendencies, but all were unanimous that his work,
 and particularly his reporting of scientific intelligence, was
 excellent.
 The German and Austrian scientists who had served with
 Haller in the Prestation Savante in France soon after the be-
 ginning of World War II now constituted a pool of assets.
 For two more years he worked with some of them in acquiring
 scientific and technical intelligence. A love affair with a young
 German actress ended when she married his rival, but his
 disappointment did not impair his work.  The quality and

 quantity of his output is evidenced in the repeated efforts of
 his superiors to get him paid more nearly what it was worth:
 His production is phenomenally high, and the many cases
 he runs are distinguished for the professionalism evident in
 their conduct.  Although outstandingly qualified in back-
 ground for conduct of positive intelligence operations covering
 technical and scientific subjects, he has demonstrated marked
 ability in conducting other kinds of positive intelligence and
 CE cases.... I should like to underline the fact that in the
 handling of agents and the production of intelligence, particu-
 larly in the scientific and technical field, in this area, Haller
 is, in my opinion, without a peer.
 His scope expanded as scientific conferences in Switzerland
 and elsewhere enabled him to discuss the meetings with old
 friends who had attended, professors and other intellectuals.
 Both the briefings and the debriefings of this period are
 classics.  In late 1955 he debriefed Leo Bauer, former leading
 functionary of the East German Communist Party, who be-
 cause of his personal acquaintance with Haller had refused to
 talk to any other American official.  He also debriefed Erica
 Glaser Wallach, who had gone to East Germany to locate her
 foster-father, Noel Field.
 His friends remember only one interview that left him
 shaken.  Dr. Gustave Hertz, one of the leading German sci-
 entists who worked on the Soviet atomic energy program, had
 returned to Germany with his secretary, Ellen Mueller, her
 husband, and their four children.  The family was rushed to
 a safehouse, and Haller was called. As he began his careful
 questioning, little hands started tugging at his trouser-legs
 and clutching at his coat.  Soon one and then another child,
 chomping hard candies, had struggled into his lap.  While
 their mother beamed with a pride that was obviously a factor
 in her cooperativeness, the two continued the ascent, reaching
 Haller's sagging shoulders and making room for the other
 two members of the expedition. Haller has been called both a
 man's man and a lady's man, but no one ever called him a
 children's man.  Somehow he struggled through the ques-
 tioning. He emerged perspiring and a little stunned, as though
 he had been kicked in the stomach.  Perhaps he had.  All
 future dealings with Frau Mueller were handled by his as-
 sistant.

 The Sheer Pinnacle
 By now he was near the peak of his career. He was using
 fully his keen intellect, depth of recall, sensitivity, practical
 astuteness and imagination, his background in languages,
 science, and politics, and his feel for operations. His ability
 to deal with people amounted to genius.  He was good at it
 because he was patient and, above all, because he was inter-
 ested in people.  Unlike most refugees, he had no political
 or personal axe to grind.  He was an accurate observer and
 reporter. He could talk to all classes of Germans, from artists
 and professors to farmers and laborers, each in their own
 language-an indispensable skill in a country in which speech
 differences mirror both social levels and geography.  His rela-
 tions with his contacts were on two levels-of friendly per-
 sonal participation and of impassive objectivity-without the
 latter being evident to them.  Perhaps his membership in a
 race  recently  and  bitterly  persecuted by  the     Germans
 strengthened this faculty and sharpened his ability to use
 German agents for the purposes of his new homeland.
 He did not grow careless or conceited with success.  He re-
 mained a meticulous craftsman.  Before he debriefed a source,
 he mastered the subject to be discussed.  His agents were made
 comfortable not only by his cigars and beer but also by the
 easy flow of communication.  And he did not end until he
 had every last scrap of useful information.  He never failed,
 moreover, to remain alert for operational leads-potential
 agents, counterintelligence indicators, propaganda possibili-
 ties. When Haller was finished, there were no more questions
 to be asked. And though he groaned over the chore of putting
 it on paper, his reporting became thorough-and more than
 thorough, illuminating-for he rarely failed to make interpre-
 tive comments.  Despite the bulk of his reporting he wrote
 everything in longhand.
 His work remained consistently solid, even brilliant.  Some
 of it was considered sufficiently important to be brought to
 the personal attention of the Director of Central Intelligence.
 The Director, impressed, thought that the promotions which
 his superiors had got for him were not enough.      Stephan
 Haller thus became a rarity, a man promoted to the top of
 Civil Service ranks not because he was an exceptional execu-

 tive-he had never occupied an executive position-but solely
 because he was an exceptional case officer.  The Director sent
 him a personal letter of congratulation, and shortly there-
 after, when he was called to headquarters, gave a luncheon in
 his honor.  Haller was deeply moved.  He often spoke later of
 the great honor conferred on him in Washington. His life and
 work reached on that day the top of a rocket-like trajectory.
 It was for him a moment of true glory.
 After his return to Germany and a period of hard work in
 Berlin, he went in mid-1956 to Darmstadt to visit friends.
 Awakening in a strange room, in the middle of the night, he
 reached out for the light, but on the wrong side, and fell out
 of bed. The fall broke his hip. A German doctor placed a pin
 in the fracture, but the leg kept on giving him trouble.  He
 went to a hospital in Munich, where leeches were used in an
 effort to reduce his blood pressure. The results were not good.
 He developed phlebitis.
 These physical misfortunes would not have been the begin-
 ning of the end for most of us, who can learn to be satisfied
 with past achievements and past honors, financial comfort,
 and a familiar circle of family and friends. Stephan Haller was
 a man of different breed. With all the intensity of his charac-
 ter he had wound his life around one thing, his work.  Work
 and the feeling that what he did was recognized were his en-
 tire psychological sustenance. Now that appeared to be gone.
 Lying month upon month in bed in the Army Hospital in
 Frankfurt, he grew ever more depressed, thinking of how he
 could do nothing now to justify those honors heaped on him,
 and how little he would ever be likely to do again. Remember-
 ing that it had once been only his performance which had saved
 him from the Security axe, he even developed a growing fear
 that he would be released from the service, after thirteen years,
 because he had stopped producing. No amount of reassurance
 by friends and fellow-workers could dispel this irrational fig-
 ment of his frustrated energy.  His collapse was so alarming
 that he was returned to Washington in February 1957 and
 treated at the George Washington University Hospital. About
 a month later he was discharged.

 the jealous gods, perhaps, had visited him at the summit of his
 life.  On 26 April 1957 he was stricken by a heart attack and

 INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IN AN
 UNLETTERED LAND
 Francis Hollyman
 If analysts and estimators find their political information
 on the illiterate countries lacking in depth, confined to the os-
 tensible policies and evident intrigues of a few dominant fam-
 ilies and providing little insight into future moves, sub-surface
 trends, or popular attitudes, the reasons are not far to seek.
 Our reporters in these countries, both the Foreign Service offi-
 cers who maintain correct official contacts and especially the
 covert reporter whose business it is to probe outside this official
 sphere, must pit their efforts against formidable obstacles de-
 riving from the peculiarities of an anachronistic society.
 Take               An American trying to use 0 citi-
 zens as clandestine sources of political information, however
 well versed in Arabic and well acquainted with the country
 he may be, has to get through three concentric barriers before
 he can begin to look for the information inside.  The first is
 the fact that there are very few native residents in a position
 to have political information. Second, the odds are all against
 getting satisfactory covert access to any of those who do. And
 third, if you do gain access to a potential source, his patterns
 of motivation and behavior are such that it requires consum-
 mate skill in an American to get him to produce.
 Unschooled Public and Rarefied Politics
 The first difficulty, the scarcity of I            in a position
 to have useful information, arises in part from meager oppor-
 tunity for education and in part from traditional restrictions
 on participation in political and public life. I            who
 are well educated by the standards of their country, including
 some businessmen and many government functionaries but

 few others, have generally had no more than eight or nine
 years of school, with a large part of that devoted to the Koran.
 Well over ninety-nine percent of the populace has been given
 much less schooling or none at all. A slight expansion of sec-
 ondary education in recent years has not yet had any appreci-
 able effect on the general level of elite learning.  Plans for
 higher education, aside from the training of religious figures
 and a few teachers, are still in the dream stage.  Only a very
 small fraction of one percent of the population can go abroad
 and get a better education than is offered by the      elemen-
 tary schools.
 Even at the elementary level, I                 schools tend to
 leave large blind spots with regard to political matters. Sub-
 jects such as geography and world affairs are scarcely touched.
 It is not uncommon to find that a relatively well-educated
 who occupies an important place in commerce or
 government cannot read a map, and he may not even be aware
 that the world is not flat!  With this shocking elementary ig-
 norance he cannot begin to comprehend or care about more
 complex or subtle things like the meaning of the Iron Curtain
 or problems springing from Communist imperialism.  The ex-
 tremely few who have overcome these educational deficiencies
 by going abroad are still far from politically sophisticated;
 they are likely to be swallowed in the sea of ignorance around
 them, and they have nowhere to turn to get accurate current
 information.
 The public media of information are weak, and do little to
 remedy the collossal deficiency in education.  Basic informa-
 tion in the form of published surveys, handbooks, lists, direc-
 tories, statistics, charts, maps, etc., is virtually nonexistent.
 The official radio and press service, organized efficiently in re-
 cent years, has become more effective in preventive control of
 thought rather than in informational content.  It gives little
 place for commentary except that promoting government pol-
 icy and those slogans of Arab nationalism considered best
 suited to Dinterests. newspapers similarly give
 only a small fraction of the news available, and the paucity of
 published information is often more striking in domestic mat-
 ters than on important international questions.
 The newspapers are in any case little read; scarcely one
 in a thousand is a subscriber. But there is a con-

 siderable amount of radio listening, and the people have gener-
 ally come to rely on the powerful Egyptian radio as a source
 for news. At the height of the Suez crisis nearly all those who
 had access to radios listened also to at least one Moscow broad-
 cast in Arabic daily; and they may now be turning to some ex-
 tent to the Bagdad radio.
 The restrictive character of the I       overnment abets the
 low educational level in severely circumscribing the number of
 citizens in a position to be well informed about political ques-
 tions of interest to us.  A great deal of the most important
 information on political questions is restricted\
 L__f Avery
 few outsiders, no more than a handful at present, have suc-
 ceeded in entering this charmed circle through personal ability
 based on a good foreign education; this phenomenon is the ex-
 ception rather than the rule.  Other officials of the govern-
 ment are generally mere functionaries, lacking access to much
 information on activities outside their own offices.
 There is a tendency to keep the most important matters
 strictly
 keep personnel of the ministries from
 being well informed. And in matters which do go to a ministry,
 an unusual degree of reliance is placed on the spoken word, the
 personal mission, and the personal memory of the minister
 himself. Furthermore, even when there are documents cover-
 ing a transaction, they are not likely to be filed in such a way
 as to be easily accessible when they are more than a few days
 old. It is not unusual for an employee of the Ministry of For-
 eign Affairs, for example, to spend hours in an unsuccessful

 Reaching the Rare Politico
 The second major difficulty for the political reporter is the
 relative inaccessibility of those few              ho are well
 informed about political matters. The hindrances to satisfac-
 tory access, being in part characteristic of the restrictive po-
 litical and social system of the country, affect all kinds of re-
 porting, but there are certain complications which make the
 effects of the system broader and more serious in the field of
 clandestine information-collecting activities than in the overt
 field.
 Ways of life in a country like           _]make it hard to
 reach any good potential source some of the time, and hard to
 reach some of them at any time.  The virtual absence of easy
 social contacts, the lack of suitable public meeting places, the
 staggering inadequacy of public communications, and the sus-
 picions commonly aroused among native residents by outsiders
 attempting to move freely among them-all make the task un-
 believably time-consuming. Hardest to see are the persons who
 are in the highest positions, or whose work does not call for
 contact with foreigners, or who speak only Arabic; and the ma-
 jority of good potential sources are probably in these cate-
 gories.
 The travel habits of practically all important native figures
 make them an elusive quarry for the foreigner, who has little
 mobility in               Persons of interest to us often stay

 Government personages also a sen  themselves  re-
 quently for trips abroad.                               The religious requirements of Ram-
 adan, the month of fasting, and of the annual hajj or pilgrimage
 to Mecca tend to damp down any information-collecting ac-
 tivities for considerable periods of time.  In sum, almost any
 native source is likely to be out of reach for at least a few
 months of the year, in some instances for more than half of
 each year.

 These difficulties are particularly trying when we are seek-
 ing initial contact with new potential sources. We sometimes
 have to wait for months because they are not in a place where
 we can see them and there is no other means of initial com-
 munication that carries any hope of secrecy.  The choice of
 possible native sources is so narrow and the ways of access to
 them are so extremely few that almost any effort to find and
 develop new clandestine sources is vulnerable to detection by
 friend and foe alike. There is almost invariably a prolonged pe-
 riod of intense awkardness and insecurity in the preliminaries
 to initial clandestine contact.
 Psycho-Cultural Characteristics
 Characteristic peculiarities of attitude, motivation, and be-
 havior constitute a third major difficulty in the use of native
 sources for political information. They are a considerable ob-
 stacle even to the overt reporter, but in clandestine informa-
 tion-collecting activities they also make it much harder to as-
 sess the personal reliability of a potential source. I do not re-
 fer here primarily to the obvious peculiarities of outlook caused
 by limited education, religious beliefs, social customs, restric-
 tions in political and public life, and the thought patterns of a
 language so unlike our own. Peculiarities of this kind, readily
 identifiable, can be anticipated and partly compensated for in
 our training and preparation for the work.
 More difficult to handle are other, subtler peculiarities, ones
 which would probably not be very apparent if we ourselves
 did not have definite expectations of a behavior which fits our
 re uirements in those whom we want to use as sources.  To a
 he peculiarities lie in our expectations, not in the
 attitudes and motivations fundamental to his way of life.
 One of these is his sense of time, a practical one from his
 standpoint, if impractical from ours.  For him, infinity
 stretches out ahead, contiguous and real. He seldom, perhaps
 never, feels the pressure of time. The concept of a fiscal year is
 wholly foreign to him, either as a measure of time or as a means
 of controlling expenditures.  The notion of "production" of po-
 litical information in certain quantities within a certain period
 would puzzle him. He does not have our sense of a schedule, of
 a deadline, of a program.  Nothing can be done to make him
 work at a set rate of speed, let alone hurry.

 Another of these subtler peculiarities is his sense of purpose,
 which bears little obvious resemblance to ours.  Aside from
 wanting to be a proper Arab and a good Muslim, he has no
 strong aims or convictions.  His experience is too little, his
 ignorance too great, to provide a foundation for opposition to
 Communist imperialism as his motive force. He has no strong
 sense of socio-political responsibility, no felt need for thinking,
 for making a political choice. The idea of subscribing to a posi-
 tive ideological program or doctrine, except as it incorporates
 his immediate Arab interests, is beyond him. He does not like
 to generalize about the world, because all he knows is his home,
 the marketplace, the desert, and the edge of the sea.  Very
 often his attitude is that of the merchant, even if he is not en-
 gaged in commerce. His aims and desires are very simple ones,
 and he does not want to change them.
 Thel            ften reacts in ways that surprise those who
 do not know him, or fails to react in the ways they expect.
 He is essentially gentle, not belligerent.  At the height of the
 1956 Suez crisis he hoped for nothing more than an immediate
 end to the fighting; he could not comprehend the international
 forces at work, and he was afraid.  He respects force partly
 because it is simple and within his comprehension. Although
 he is often distrustful of British diplomacy, he understands and
 makes allowance for a frank statement that such-and-such is
 in the British interest and British policy is planned accord-
 ingly.                       He rather distrusts the profession of lofty moral prin-
 ciple as a basis for policy on the part of any government, partly
 because the principle may be too complicated or too different
 from his own way of thinking, partly because he does his polit-
 ical thinking-such as it is-in terms of interest, not princi-
 ples. He likes the material things which the western world may
 have made available to him to make life more pleasant, but if
 he has been abroad he generally returns happily home, not
 very much impressed by other aspects of western civilization.
 Relying largely on oral communication, he tends to simplify
 and omit when he has to deal with complicated matters.  He
 cannot easily distinguish fact from rumor.  He is not good at
 making an estimate of a situation, or even at judging the state
 of public opinion, because he is not used to thinking along
 these lines.  When a new situation develops, he does not fail
 to react, but his reactions are simple and direct, based on his

 immediate interest.   An observer or overt collector needs a
 long period of living among these people and learning to think
 in their way to acquire the instinctive appreciation that will
 make him a sensitive reporter.
 The covert reporter has the further problem of assessing
 the individual            as a potential agent, and then of
 maintaining his motivation and his production. As a clandes-
 tine collector of information, it is hard    al           I to
 work in a methodical way, because method is not part of his
 make-up.  He rarely if ever 1ias the spirit of fighting for a
 cause; but on the other hand, even if he is venal, he will do
 very little to accomplish things he does not believe in. He can-
 not be ordered bluntly, because he cherishes the little niceties
 in personal dealings which are his way. He needs a great deal of
 orientation and encouragement.  What he usually prizes most
 in this activity is an abiding personal relationship that gives
 him understanding, dignity, and friendship.
 These, then, are the awesome obstacles to political reporting
 from a country where illiteracy                        eave
 only a handful of worthwhile sources of information, where cus-
 toms make this handful difficult to reach and confidential deal-
 ings almost impossible, and where the cultural differences that
 wall off westerners go down to the very roots of motivation
 and thinking.  These obstacles have been described with par-
 ticular reference to I             but the situation there is
 not unlike that in a score of equally important other countries
 where the people are unfamiliar with the written word, re-
 served and imprecise with the spoken, and profoundly different
 in their way of life.

 An  amateur graphologist
 pleads for at least a dry run on
 an assessment technique of po-
 tential value in intelligence.
 HANDWRITING. ANALYSIS AS AN
 ASSESSMENT AID
 Keith Laycock
 The assertion that reliable clues to a person's character 1
 and some of his capabilities may be derived from analysis of
 his handwriting usually evokes a vigorous pro or con reaction
 which seems to originate somewhere in the subconscious mind
 and not to reflect a reasoned consideration of the proposition.
 The reaction is at times so strong as to give a psychologist the
 impression that those who shrink from the idea do so because
 they fear exposure and those who eagerly embrace it are the
 kind who like to snoop and pry.  Whatever the psychological
 reasons, one thing is certain: the proposition is a good one for
 starting a controversy.
 The art of handwriting analysis-graphology, as it is more
 commonly called, especially in Europe-has two branches: an
 established and "respectable" one devoted to the identification
 of individuals by their handwriting, and a black-sheep branch
 dealing with the assessment of personality.  The latter is the
 subject of this paper.  I am not a professional graphologist,
 but I have explored the subject enough to be convinced that
 this black art has a practical application in the assessment
 of persons to whom access for other character tests is limited.
 Since character assessment (as distinct from capabilities-
 testing) is as complex as human nature itself, and the art
 of handwriting analysis is exceedingly difficult in its detail,
 the most that can be achieved in any short paper is to give
 an outline of the theory involved, in the hope that those read-
 ers who have serious limited-access assessment problems will
 be encouraged to explore the matter further, independently,
 By character I mean the individual constellation and balance of
 drives, inhibitions, and habits which determines how (rather than
 how effectively) a man will behave in a given situation.

 either through study or by enlisting the services of a pro-
 fessional graphologist.
 Plotting the Terms of Reference
 Anyone undertaking serious study or investigation of graph-
 ology-or of any assessment system, for that matter-must
 settle three formidable related questions before he can safely
 submerge himself in the "how" of the technique at all, to wit:
 1) How far do we propose to go in plumbing the ramified depths
 of a subject's character? 2) How do we handle the semantic
 problems which plague character descriptions? 3) What do we
 do about standards for judging the ethical aspects of character?
 It seems to me, on the first question, that we have to specify
 in some detail precisely what we want to know about a sub-
 ject's character before we can proceed in any assessment opera-
 tion, and then keep within these sharply delineated limits to
 avoid an extensive mire.  Most executives appear willing to
 settle for any assessment system which will consistently and re-
 liably tip them off to those peculiarities of a given individual
 which will be helpful and those which will be harmful in the
 job they are trying to fill. They seldom appear to be interested
 in ultimates about anyone's character, in complete "character-
 pictures" pages long, or in abstract conceptions that have to
 be interpreted. From the purely practical point of view, then,
 assessment starts with the job description, and that job de-
 scription should be supplemented by a list of desirable, unde-
 sirable, and fatal traits. In the absence of such a guide, assess-
 ment becomes perforce an undertaking to describe all the
 traits of a given subject, an exceedingly unrealistic exercise
 in the present state of psychological knowledge and one which,
 if conscientiously carried out, results in massive and compli-
 cated reports, long delayed.
 I should accordingly, without prejudice to the usability of
 graphology in the field of deeper research, answer the first
 question as follows: We should consider a reasonably accept-
 able result from this technique to be a report containing a re-
 liable guide to those character-traits of the subject which make
 him fit or unfit for the job we have in mind, as specified by
 us, plus a warning on any character-traits that deviate strongly
 from the average.  For example: We specify that we want to
 fill a bank-teller's job. For this (with apologies to bank tellers)

 we want a stable and mediocre person who is conscientious,
 able to stand dull routine, accurate, and honest, one who is
 not quarrelsome, thieving, aggressive, or imaginative. We as-
 sume that in other respects he will be run-of-the-mill.  The
 assessment turns up one candidate who meets the specifica-
 tions of general mediocrity and willingness to handle other
 people's money without appropriating it but who is also exceed-
 ingly vain, in fact a peacock. Such a potentially dangerous fac-
 tor ought to be reported to us, even if we have not required it.
 Our second problem, semantics, can cause a great deal of
 difficulty either in the exercise of the graphological art or in
 the study of it; it is a pitfall into which many have tumbled.
 What is an "honest" man? What is a "brave" man? Defini-
 tion of such words is a practical impossibility, since the third
 unknown, an ethical standard, is involved. If we could estab-
 lish agreed ethical standards, we could, no doubt, compose def-
 initions which would be adequate, but there does not now ap-
 pear to be such a set of standards.  In fact, at this point in hu-
 man history there seems to be more confusion than ever over
 whether the end justifies the means or is inseparable from them.
 We are accordingly, as far as I can see, limited in using charac-
 terological terms to those denoting specific acts such as talk-
 ing, stealing, lying, etc., and must eschew words with ethical
 overtones.  Many writers and students on the subject have
 fallen into the ethics trap, so let both student and practitioner
 beware.
 It is necessary to add yet another caution: The analysis of
 handwriting is an art, not a science, and the quality of the re-
 sult is dependent upon the caliber and capacity of the artist.
 Consequently, the statistical evaluation of graphology accord-
 ing to the accuracy of the results obtained by a cross-section
 of its practitioners is meaningless.  The question whether
 graphology can be used reliably in assessment work seems to
 me to depend on whether even one person can do it consistently,
 not whether a majority of those who claim to be competent
 can get results.  The evaluator should be aware that a great
 many so-called graphologists are either dilettantes or charla-
 tans, using an art of which they have a smattering to swindle
 or astound the gullible.  It is, in fact, this swarm of fortune-

 damage to the reputation of graphology which has served to de-
 prive many a harassed executive of its assistance.
 Basis for the Art
 As the reader will see from the bibliography attached at the
 end of this article, much has been written on the "how" of
 graphology.  The bibliography could be much longer without
 exhausting the list of serious works.  The student who reads
 these books will find that, while there is considerable diver-
 gence among them in the area of fundamental theory, there
 is striking unanimity on the more concrete technical level.
 This situation no doubt reflects the general dilemma of assess-
 ment: it is a lot easier to devise tests that reveal a hidden
 habit, such as "taking ways," than to uncover the underlying
 psychological reasons for the habit. We shall therefore try as
 far as possible to avoid the more abstruse aspects of the sub-
 ject in discussing next the general validity of the thesis that
 reliable clues to the character and to some of the capabilities of
 a person may be derived from competent analysis of his hand-
 writing.
 Essentially, two points have to be established, first that the
 individuality of every person's handwriting is caused primarily
 by psychological, as distinct from mechanical, characteristics
 peculiar to the writer, and second, that there is reflected in a
 given handwriting, in symbol form, a hidden "story" about
 these psychological factors which a graphologist can "read."
 The individuality and peculiarity of every person's handwriting
 is accepted by the courts, and it follows that a person's hand-
 writing must change very slowly and slightly or not at all dur-
 ing his adult life, since otherwise the courts would not accept
 holographic evidence.
 If this individuality in writing were the result of mechanical
 influences only, then the enormous deviations from letter
 forms taught in school which some calligraphies exhibit would
 be due to extreme mechanical idiosyncrasies, not to say difficul-
 ties, peculiar to the writer. The fact is, however, that writers
 with exceedingly peculiar handwritings perform all other tasks
 with about the same mechanical competence as the next man,
 and conversely, persons who are markedly unadroit often have
 more regular handwritings than those of considerable mechan-

 Handwriting Analysis
 ical skill. Mechanical skill, in fact, is one of the abilities which
 can not be deduced from handwriting.
 Handwriting is in reality brain-writing, as the following ex-
 periment will prove to any reader who cares to try it: Sign your
 name on a piece of paper.  Now take the writing instrument
 between your molars and sign; then put the instrument be-
 tween your big and second toes and write your name that way.
 With some practice legible signatures can be produced in this
 fashion, which on comparison will be found to resemble closely
 (with due allowance for mechanical factors!) the work pro-
 duced by the hand.  Even if you cannot control your neck or
 leg muscles sufficiently to produce legible scrawls, you will be
 able to see that you are trying to direct the instrument held
 in teeth or toes to produce the image you have in mind.  (I
 would warn the reader who attempts this experiment either
 to make sure of privacy or to let any possible intruder know be-
 forehand what he is trying to do. It can be very embarrassing
 to be caught barefoot in simian concentration on managing a
 pencil with your toes.)
 There are a number of cogent reasons why psychological
 rather than mechanical factors dictate the main calligraphic
 peculiarities of a person who does not have a neurological
 condition of some sort.  Let's look briefly at the influence of
 a dozen common psychological motivations.
 Pride in Appearances.  A writer usually feels that his hand-
 writing's appearance represents him to the reader and to
 the community at large.  He accordingly makes a certain
 amount of effort, depending on the degree to which he feels
 appearances are important, to make his calligraphy look
 "good."  Therefore his writing will in some degree reflect his
 personal taste in what looks good, and how much importance
 he places on looking good.
 Social Attitude.  Except in the case of memoranda written
 for notekeeping, the act of writing has strong social implica-
 tions.  It is an act of communication, seeking to reach and
 influence one or more readers, whether with generous or
 sinister motives.   How the writer moves across the paper
 toward the reader must, as a matter of common sense, reflect
 somewhat his attitude.  A self-confident, outgoing, cheerful,
 trusting writer who loves people is bound to cross the page in
 a very different way than the writer who hates, fears, and dis-

 trusts others, and perhaps himself as well.  As a matter of
 common observation such opposite types act differently, use
 different gestures, have different smiles, etc.; it is hardly sur-
 prising that their gestures on paper would differ.
 Docility and Truculence.  The act of writing is an act of
 conformity: if certain standards are not met, the communi-
 cation can be read only with difficulty or not at all.  Here
 the people who like to make things difficult for others can
 have a field day by distorting their handwriting, leaving it
 just readable enough to make the reading a torture. Those
 who rebel in principle against conformity will also maim their
 writing, and so will some gentlemen who fear they may be
 called to account for what they have written.  Others there
 are who conform rigidly to the set standards, some willingly,
 some desperately, some furtively, and some because they have
 no particular personal preferences to express.
 The Shock of Early Battles.  Writing may bear scars.
 Learning to write is one of the first great struggles with
 society which many of us undergo, faced suddenly with a
 frightfully difficult task which we must perform or remain
 illiterate.  The job can be torture, or a game; that depends
 on many things.  But the attitudes toward writing then es-
 tablished (cramped, worried, overanxious; or relaxed, confi-
 dent, free-flowing?) are often reflected throughout life.
 Emotional Disturbance.  Writing is an act of self-expres-
 sion, sometimes of feelings hidden from the conscious mind.
 A pen driven by boiling emotions will move very differently
 than one in the hand of a calculating or apathetic "cold fish."
 The writer who is tormented by ungratified (perhaps ungrati-
 flable!) sex wishes will unwittingly interject some sex-wish
 symbols into his calligraphy.  Where these wishes include a
 desire to commit rape-murders, the symbolism can be very
 sinister indeed.
 Energy and Fatigue. Writing is a piece of work, to some a
 highly disagreeable chore and to all an effort requiring con-
 centration and output of energy. Is the writer ebullient with
 energy?  Or does he wearily drag one foot after the other?
 Is he tireless or easily fatigued?  Is he liberal with his ener-
 gies, or does he try to economize on every movement?  The
 impact of his pen on the paper will certainly vary with these
 traits.

 Handwriting Analysis
 Agility and Impatience.  As a means of communication,
 writing is a slow technique. It is adequate only for the slow
 thinker; to the man whose mind is leaping ahead of his hand
 it becomes an irritating impediment.  But agile minds may
 react variously to this drag: some devise ingenious shortcuts,
 others butcher the script beyond recognition.  The ruthless
 ones wade over the paper; the considerate ones torment them-
 selves with conscientious printing.
 The Devious Intent.     The writer knows that what he has
 written can be used for purposes he never intended or even
 foresaw.  Therefore the prudent man with ulterior motives
 writes cautiously, and the self-conscious criminal may choose
 ornate, imposing script.  Men who prowl craftily through
 life seldom caper across paper.
 One's Path to Glory.    We all desire to attain status among
 our fellows.  Do we try to gain it by hard work?  By sudden,
 spectacular achievement?  By illegitimate methods?  By vio-
 lence?                                 By bragging?              Would it not be strange, after receiv-
 ing a letter full of exaggerated capitals and ornate flourishes,
 with various senseless embellishments for general effect, to
 find that the writer was a conscientious, self-effacing, hard-
 working drudge?
 The Root of Evil. We all have some emotional relationship
 or attitude toward money.  Do we spend nights dreaming of
 it? Squander it? Hoard it? Steal it? Despise it? Feel guilty
 about having it?  Most accountants and bookkeepers can tell
 you, without even thinking, how a man feels about money by
 the way he writes a check.  Some of them can make quite
 a good guess also about how far he trusts people.
 Practice of the Art
 At this point the reader will probably be satisfied that about
 as many factors in a man's habits, attitudes, and traits influ-
 ence the formation of his handwriting as he has habits, atti-
 tudes and traits, and may agree that peculiarities in hand-
 writing are mainly generated by the psychological peculiarities
 of the writer.  We still, however, have not established the
 validity of point two, that a graphologist can consistently
 interpret peculiarities in writing to reveal the peculiarities
 behind them.  If systematic interpretation of handwriting is
 to be possible, peculiarities or their combinations that indi-

 cate a certain trait of character in one writer must indicate

 In an article of this length I cannot present the voluminous
 tabulations which have been compiled by graphological ana-
 lysts relating specific peculiarities to specific traits. Moreover,
 simply presenting such tabulations would hardly convince the
 reader that the tabulated relationships are in fact correct;
 paper will, after all, put up with anything that is written
 on it.  In my experience, the only way you can convince a
 real skeptic that this kind of interpretation is consistently
 possible is to perform it consistently, or else cite performance
 data from a source he respects. From my own files I can pre-
 sent quite a few cases where graphologists have made astonish-
 ingly accurate delineations of the character of persons in
 whom we had abiding interest of great importance, and I
 would like to cite two of the most striking ones very briefly.
 On these I am prepared to produce (for those with proper
 clearances only) precise documentary proof.
 The first concerns a person who carried out a monumental
 performance in duplicity for several years at considerable
 risk. A grapholigist who knew nothing about him but his pen-
 manship described him in such accurate terms that when a
 sterilized version of the graphological report was circulated
 without any other indication of identity to five persons who
 had known him well, all five recognized him from the descrip-
 tion and four concurred in it entirely.  The fifth acquaintance
 agreed on all points except one: he did not think the subject
 as intelligent as the graphologist assessed him to be.  Mean-
 while a standard assessment was made by psychologists, who
 were in agreement that the man had a very high order of
 intelligence indeed.
 The other case, a man who had carried out an even more
 extraordinary deception, was processed by both a European
 and an American graphologist. The two descriptions not only
 concurred in all major points, but were ultimately proved to
 be far more accurate than we believed at the time they were
 produced.
 This, of course, is not evidence, in the scientific sense, on
 the critical question of consistent performance.  In both cases
 the handwriting specimens were of the striking kind which

 even a layman would recognize as having elements of great-
 ness from the espionage point of view.  To the best of my
 knowledge, and strangely enough when one thinks of the
 controversy that has raged around this subject, a proper test
 run has never been devised and carried out, at least not in
 the United States, to determine whether any graphologist
 can consistently deliver accurate results in the area of char-
 acter delineation.  Consistent results in the psychiatric area
 concerned with the detection of mental illness appear to be
 pretty well established,2 and these are certainly impressive.
 That is a different matter, however, from providing data on
 the character peculiarities of people who are "sane."  It is
 high time that such a determination were undertaken, and
 at the end of this article I shall take the liberty of making
 specific recommendations on such a test.
 In the absence of a present fund of test data to throw `at
 the skeptic, I resort to offering him a brief description of one
 or two graphological techniques and the thinking behind
 them.  I hope thereby to bring him to the point of joining
 the man who needs means for limited-access assessment and
 helping him generate pressure for carrying out a proper prov-
 ing problem on the pivotal question-can anybody at all do
 this work with reasonable accuracy and consistency?
 Sorting Out the Symbols
 The techniques employed by the graphologist to bring out
 the hidden character-story in a given handwriting rest upon
 the interpretation of symbolism in the specimen.  There are
 two kinds of symbol-groups-those common to a society or
 culture, and those which the writer may have devised on his
 own, usually unconsciously, to express subconscious wishes,
 fears, hatreds, and the like.  We are all so surrounded and
 submersed in symbols and symbolism that we are often oblivi-
 ous to the tremendous expressive and controlling force of this
 cultural factor.  In some way not understood, symbols are
 linked with the deepest impulses of the mind.  They are not
 merely a matter of simple association, as performed by Pav-
 lov's dog.  Some symbols are coarse-the Swastika, the Ham-
 mer and Sickle, the Rising Sun, the Dollar Sign, the Cross.

 Others are less so-the jagged, angular writing that suggest
 combat, cutting, tearing; the hidden rope and dagger; the
 blots and drips of ink, like poison and bloodstains, in some
 writing; the hidden treble clef of the music-lover.  Some sym-
 bolism is subtle-the receding left margin, making inner reser-
 vations; the flung-lance t-cross harpooning its victim; the
 whole writing back-slanting, as though resisting or reneging.
 The interpretation of these symbols requires a process of
 analysis more or less as follows: First, all deviations from the
 model calligraphy the writer was originally taught in school,
 insofar as this can be determined, are noted.  That requires
 a very substantial knowledge on the part of the analyst as to
 scripts and formats taught in different parts of the world at
 different times.  Second, these and other symbolic deviations
 are evaluated in terms of the extensive lists of character indi-
 cators compiled in tabular form by generations of grapholo-
 gists. Then the individual indicators are compared and sorted
 to form groups comprising for example those indicating per-
 sistence or lack thereof, aggressiveness or lack of it; and the
 picture that emerges is then checked for consistency.
 A complete re-evaluation has to be made when major in-
 consistencies are detected or where confusion results.  This
 inconsistency or confusion is generally due to the fact that
 a given set of peculiarities in handwriting will reflect the cor-
 responding set of positive peculiarities in the writer only about
 two-thirds of the time, and in the other third the symbolism
 may be inverted, reflecting not the positive trait but a sub-
 conscious wish for the missing quality.  A bold and massive
 general's handwriting sometimes comes from a Mickey Mouse
 of a man who would like to be a general but doesn't dare and
 hasn't the capacity.  At times a complex mixture of direct,
 inverted, and wish symbols is present, and the graphologist
 is stuck with a tiresome cut-and-try process until he comes
 up with a consistent picture. It is no wonder that the charla-
 tan and the dilettante, who don't do the required cross-check-
 ing and therefore should stick to simple handwritings, from
 time to time fall on these inconsistencies and are exposed.
 Unfortunately, people then blame the art, not the practi-
 tioners.
 These are the mechanics of the interpretive process, but
 there also is an "intuitive" factor involved.  There are so

 many aspects of symbolism to consider more or less simul-
 taneously that something like a computer is really needed
 to perform the drudgery of comparison; and I believe that
 the art, if it is ever to become a science, will have to have
 electronic support for the human brain. But frequently some
 analysts seem readily to understand specimens of writing
 that baffle others, and vice versa.  Still others seem to in-
 terpret handwriting by way of some subconscious response of
 their own to the latticework of symbols they see, without
 knowing how they do it.
 A notorious case in point is that of Roda Wieser, who once
 undertook to analyze the handwriting of hundreds of jailed
 criminals and then compared it with that of "honest" men
 (i.e., men not in jail!). To cap the comedy, she picked police-
 men as the "honest" men, apparently not realizing that she
 was actually only comparing the handwriting of unsuccessful
 criminals with that of a group no better or worse than other
 men involved in crime, but hardly ipso facto honest.  En-
 tangled in the semantic problem and her ignorance of crimi-
 nology, Roda labored long and hard and produced the strange
 book listed in the bibliography.  Yet she was an almost phe-
 nomenal interpretive handwriting analyst; she appears simply
 not to have known how she did it.
 A Kindergarten Case
 Let us look, by way of elementary illustration, at one seg-
 ment of the symbol structure and something of its interpre-
 tation.                                 We shall stick to "direct" interpretation only, since
 the "inversion" and "wish" aspects would confuse matters
 and are not essential to getting a grasp on principles.  In
 fact, if the reader sticks to the direct approach and does a
 little study on the side, he can soon qualify for dilettantism
 and might even become a quack.
 When we write a letter by hand on a blank sheet of paper,
 we enter as it were an open area; and as we write across this
 field, we move upward, downward, and incessantly forward
 and backward as well.  These four directions and the zones
 they point to immediately involve a common or "cultural"
 symbolism.  In our society the four have relatively uniform
 implications; take at random phrases like high ideals, low
 life, a backward child, a progressive firm. In writing, the way

 we behave with respect to these directions and how we dis-
 tort our movements in these zones has a strong significance
 in individual symbolism.  In interpreting the significance of
 these symbols the graphologist (as distinct from the charla-
 tan, however well-read) spends hours and sometimes days
 matching up the various indicators to see how they jibe.  He
 will study slant, pressure, the way of joining the letters, size
 of print, flow of the lines, speed of writing, extraneous sym-
 bols, etc., etc., etc., in each case building up a pyramid of data,
 which, if he is sufficiently competent, ultimately makes consist-
 ent sense.  For the purpose of our illustration, we can only
 show a few fragments of the process.
 In the specimen of Figure 1, the right margin goes further
 and further right and the left margin also slopes to the right.
 As the writer proceeds he strives to get closer and closer to the
 reader, ending up practically in his lap.  The capitals and
 upper loops in this specimen show distinctly the writer's free-
 dom of movement in the upper zones, above the line of writ-
 ing,but note how repressed and hesitant he is in venturing
 below the line.  We conclude that he is far more at home in
 the world of ideas and ideals than in material and animal ac-
 tivities.  The letter-formations are extended toward the right,
 curtailed toward the left: the writer is in a hurry to get to his
 goal (or away from his origins, himself, his past, etc.).  The
 whole slants upward and onward.
 We thus have a small fragment of the giant composite pic-
 ture we have to construct before we know what the fragments
 mean.  The writer seems at this point to be an idea-man,
 idealist, or dreamer who is intent upon reaching the reader
 and careful to keep out of the mire, or else he is pretending
 to be that kind of person, or wishing he was, and moving
 full tilt.

 Figure 2 reproduces a charlatan's analysis (in this instance
 correct) of two specimens for one pair of traits-talkative-
 ness-secretiveness.  I choose this example not only because
 it deals with one of the easiest human traits to detect in
 handwriting and by personal contact, but also because appli-
 cation of these indicators is within the capabilities of the lay
 reader, who may wish to experiment a little on his own, by
 scanning the writing of persons he knows and whose coeffi-
 cient of garrulity he knows.  I feel reasonably safe in saying
 that if the reader rules out those specimens which show
 contradictory indications (such as large scrawly writing with
 closed and knotted o's and a's) he will soon discover that there
 is a high degree of correlation between a given writer's talk-
 ativeness and the indicators cited in Figure 2, and that the
 more indicators of either group there are present in a given
 specimen, the more marked the trait will be.
 If the reader wishes rather to test out the effectiveness of
 some graphologist, what material should he be prepared to
 submit?  At least several pages of work, if possible from dif-
 ferent sittings, one at least bearing a signature.  The writing
 should be on unruled paper in ink or good pencil, produced
 with an instrument that suits the writer and under writing
 conditions to which he is accustomed.  Ball-point writing is
 anathema because the effort to control the flow from this
 atrocious instrument makes the pressure-friction pattern
 meaningless. The graphologist is entitled to know the writer's
 age, sex, national origin, and profession, since he cannot tell
 these facts from the specimens, and they are invaluable in-
 terpretive aids.  An "effeminate" handwriting produced by
 a male, for example, or the "masculine" writing done by some
 women must be examined with care to determine how much
 of the masculinity or femininity is real and how much is
 affectation, secret-wish expression, etc.
 At this point I rest my Introduction to Graphology, hoping
 at least to have disabused the eager convert of the notion
 that he can soon and easily train himself to detect other peo-
 ple's secrets, and to have quieted the fear of exposure that
 may be haunting others.  My object was to persuade the sin-
 cere skeptic that he cannot simply say "It can't be done," and

 A. An extreme case of talkativeness:  The writing is large and
 sprawly, the a's and o's are open. The words tend to "grow"
 as they flood the page, ignoring the right margin and crashing
 into the reader.  The writing is slanted heavily forward; letters
 run into each other; the writing slants upward; the capital let-

 the right of the t-stem, indicating haste; the writing is broad,
 heavy and brutal.
 B. A case of acute close-mouth: The writing is small and refined;
 o's and a's are closed and knotted; is are hooked to the left.
 The left and right margins retreat.  The slant is vertical and,
 in some instances, backwards. Lower loops are close-set and
 one is sealed shut.

 lems (and some of our people really have them!) to explore

 Scope of Intelligence Application
 We have a limited-access problem when we have to uncover
 the character and capabilities of a person who 1) is dead, and
 so no longer available for questioning, 2) is unwilling to talk
 and be tested, 3) is out of reach of personal interview, maybe
 behind the "curtain," 4) is untruthful in his answers to tests
 and questionnaires, 5) cannot be formally tested and assessed
 because of expense, time factors, or security considerations,
 6) is not supposed to know we are assessing him.  Where full
 access is possible, a battery of tests, particularly of the real-
 situation type used in OSS, and a careful study of the sub-
 ject's past performance and reputation will give as reliable
 a result as we can expect at this stage of our knowledge of
 man and yield something like a scientific picture of his inner
 workings.  But where access is limited, graphology offers a
 not unsatisfactory substitute.
 In most cases, competent graphologists can supply reliable
 estimates on the following important character-traits:
 Disposition to talk too much.  There are, to be sure, some
 people who can talk much and betray little, but by and
 large the man who talks a lot lets many a thing slip out
 of his mouth.
 Emotional stability under stress.  People who crack easily
 show cracks in their calligraphy.
 Agressiveness, resistance, and tenacity.
 Attitude toward money; ability to control the handling of
 it.  (Not ability to invest it.)
 Disposition to deceive, prevaricate, evade, double-talk (as
 distinct from capacity to succeed in it).
 Ambivalence, i.e., disposition to take both sides of an issue;
 to have divided loyalties.
 Inclination toward opportunism, i.e., to approach moral
 questions and matters of principle on the what's-in-it-f or-
 me-I-have-to-make-a-living basis.
 Desire for power, predominance, prominence.
 Willingness to follow the lead of others.
 Rebelliousness, crankiness, indisposition to conform, insub-
 ordination.

 Recklessness and rashness.
 Important changes in character (by comparison of present
 with past calligraphies).
 The graphologist can also provide reasonably good estimates
 on certain capabilities:
 Capacity for abstract thinking and logic.
 "Diplomacy," ability to deal with people.
 Powers of observation.
 Imagination.
 Then there are a few characteristics on which a grapholo-
 gist can make a good educated guess:
 Sex difficulties.  Their existence is often detectable, but
 their nature may not be.
 Disposition to engage in criminal activities, i.e., violation
 of laws the validity of which the subject acknowledges.
 Disposition to engage in violence against persons.  (It is im-
 portant to note that these dispositions may never be
 overtly expressed either because of fear or other restrain-
 ing factors or for mere lack of opportunity, provocation,
 or need.)
 Graphological techniques also have medical applications.
 Some calligraphies bear the warning signs of cancer and cir-
 culatory ailments; others the signs of incipient mental illness
 and nervous breakdown.
 There are certain things a graphologist can not tell:
 Sex of writer.
 Age of writer (in chronological terms, as distinct from level
 of emotional maturity).
 Mechanical ability or other special skills.
 General level of ability to perform acts to which the sub-
 ject may be disposed.  (For example, subject may be
 strongly disposed to lie and evade, but inept at putting
 lies across.)
 "Fortune" or future in store for the writer.
 Past history of work, crime, etc. (although very cogent esti-
 mates can be made as to cultural background from the
 type and level of calligraphy).
 I have the impression that most people with serious limited-
 access assessment problems would be very glad to get some of
 the information outlined above about the people they handle

 at a distance.  It is an odd coincidence that the graphologist
 can shed most light on precisely those character traits which
 are of significance in clandestine operations. The art has
 thus a peculiar potential in the half-world of espionage and
 counterespionage, where paranoid and split personalities
 abound and frustrated executives are the order of the day.
 The Dry Run
 I hope that there will soon be pressure to resolve the key
 question-can any person claiming to be a graphologist come
 up consistently with reasonably good character descriptions?
 If any one at all can do it, then it can be done.  If after all
 these years no one can be found who can do it then it cannot
 (for our purposes) be done.  It would be all too easy to devise
 a proving problem to show it can not be done, just as it is pos-
 sible to prove mathematically that a bumble-bee cannot fly.
 The best way to get a meaningless result would be to tie it
 into the strange pattern of abstruse psychological jargon
 which has of late come to infest some quarters of the psycho-
 logical world and which reflects what I believe to be the sheer
 delusion that any group of men is able to formulate scientific
 conceptions of the qualities of human character. Man is, after
 all, just emerging from the Sea of Ignorance and cannot at
 this point comprehend so simple a force as gravity.  He is
 hardly in a position to claim to understand the most complex
 of natural phenomena, man himself.  Practical executives
 want simple, practical descriptions of character-traits without
 implied moral judgments or technical jargon, and those with
 limited-access assessment problems are willing to settle for
 a good deal less.
 I would like to recommend the following specific procedure for
 the proving problem that will eventually have to be run
 somewhere:
 It should be controlled, and the final judgment made, by
 practical executives, not psychologists, psychiatrists, as-
 sessment men, or graphologists.  They should be men
 who need help in assessment problems, and one or two
 should be executives handling espionage agents.  In this
 matter, neither the graphologists nor the psychological-
 psychiatric fraternity are disinterested parties.                                  The lat-
 ter, rightly or wrongly, see in the graphologist what the

 doctor sees in the chiropractor-a quack. To what extent
 this is due to vested interest I cannot presume to judge;
 but I rather feel it touches upon the Achilles' heel of the
 entire psyche-testing fraternity, the fact that man is not
 now competent to assess man scientifically.
 A minimum of fifty sets of handwriting specimens should
 be secured, at least meeting the specifications and includ-
 ing the auxiliary data prescribed on page 37.  They should
 bear false signatures and be written in ignorance of the
 fact that they are to be used for any purpose other than
 communication. The writers must be men whose charac-
 ter is a matter of record, not established by some other
 series of tests.  (Famous men cannot be used; grapholo-
 gists know their handwritings.)  The greatest precau-
 tions should be taken both to prevent the writers from
 knowing what is afoot and to prevent the analysts from
 learning the identity of the writers.
 It should be required that the analyses be couched in com-
 mon everyday descriptive language, with jargon and tech-
 nical terminology ruled out.  They should be short and
 to the point, and exclude such ambiguities as "This man
 is basically honest and sincere, but is capable of theft and
 deception under pressure."  A proper statement on these
 points would run something like one of the following:
 "The writer will say what he thinks as long as this is
 safe."  "The writer will say what he thinks and take
 chances to do so, but does not speak recklessly."  "The
 writer will say what he thinks, no matter what the risk."
 "The writer will steal anything not nailed down."  "The
 writer will not steal under ordinary conditions."  "The
 writer has strong moral scruples against stealing and
 would rather starve."  These are definitive statements
 with which the layman can come to grips.
 Each graphologist tested should be required to state what
 specific character-traits and capabilities (cf. pages 38-39)
 he can identify and describe, thus avoiding the danger of
 pushing him into having to deliver something he cannot.
 None should be required or permitted to go off the deep
 end and try to describe a character at large; they should
 stick to the specific character-traits each claims he can de-

 lineate and let us assume that the rest of the picture will
 either be deducible from these main traits or "average."
 Each graphologist should have the right to reject 20 per-
 cent of the specimens if he wishes.                                    We do not want to
 force him into the educated-guess area, and it will also
 be most interesting to see whether they all reject the
 same 20 percent.
 Some graphologists may wish to operate as a team, and
 that would seem as allowable as any other team exercise.
 But the tests must not be aimed at groups of grapholo-
 gists; the purpose is to test the performance of individual
 graphologists without regard to affiliation.
 Some European graphologists of stature should be included,
 as the art is far more advanced in Europe.
 A few amateurs should be permitted to participate.  Of
 these I should like to be one.
 The content, procedure, and results of these tests should
 be circulated in the intelligence community.

 A professional assessor  sup-
 ports the amateur grapholo-
 gist's appeal for validity tests,
 although not sharing his en-
 chantment with the art.
 THE ASSESSMENT OF GRAPHOLOGY
 E. A. Rundquist
 Two threads of argument run through the foregoing article
 on handwriting analysis.  The first asserts the great need
 for research studies because "a proper test run has never.
 been devised and carried out, at least not in the United States,
 to determine whether any graphologist can consistently de-
 liver accurate results in the area of character delineation."
 The second asserts the value of graphology here and now as
 an assessment technique, making sweeping claims of what it
 can do.  The arguments are essentially incompatible.  If the
 claims are correct, the research is unnecessary; if there is
 no research evidence, the claims are unsupported.  With the
 need for research to establish the value of graphology as an
 assessment technique I am in full agreement. I disagree with
 the claims for its current effectiveness.
 The article makes a number of cogent points.       It distin-
 guishes between the well-established branch of graphology de-
 voted to problems of personal identification and the branch
 devoted to character analysis; it stresses the need for re=
 search studies; it recognizes many of the pitfalls that need
 be avoided in carrying out such studies; it acknowledges that
 traditional psychological assessment is preferable to hand-
 writing analysis when direct access to the individual is pos-
 sible.  With these points I am in general agreement.  A little
 elaboration of all but the first, which is too well established to
 require comment, may be helpful.
 Scope of Research
 In evaluating graphology-or any other assessment tech-
 nique-not just one, but many studies are required.       Studies
 of agreement among graphologists, the development of objec-
 tive techniques for measuring characteristics of handwriting,

 refinements in the methods used, hypotheses such as "small
 handwriting with closed and knotted o's and a's indicates
 secretiveness"-all these are useful and interesting, but they
 do not answer the main question: How well does it in fact
 predict behavior?  Or in the terms psychologists like to use:
 What is its validity?  Studies should therefore be concen-
 trated in . this area, a point I stress not in disagreement with
 Mr. Laycock, but because of its importance.
 Validation studies in the area of personality assessment
 are not easy to do.  There are many complicating factors-
 getting a representative sample of persons to participate,
 getting the same kind of information about each, getting in-
 formation in sufficiently specific terms on the behavior one is
 trying to predict. This last problem is recognized by Mr. Lay
 cock as a semantic one.  "What is a brave man?" he asks.
 If there is no agreement on what a brave man is, there is
 obviously no means of checking on anyone's assertion that a
 person is brave.
 More Pitfalls
 This semantic problem has another aspect which is often
 overlooked.  It is not hard to write a personality description
 that applies to the vast majority of people.  This "Barnum
 effect," as it has been called, is one of the charlatan's best
 friends. Psychologists prepare such descriptions to show their
 students that a person's agreement with the correctness of
 a personality description is not proper evidence of the value
 of any assessment technique.  I once capitalized on the Bar-
 num effect when instructing a group of twelve European in-
 telligence officers, most of whom were favorably inclined
 toward graphology. I asked them for handwriting specimens,
 and, after a suitable interval produced personality descriptions
 for each of them, which ten of the twelve agreed fit very well.
 Then they were allowed to discover that I had given them all
 the same identical description, one I found in a German peri-
 odical before I left the States.
 To demonstrate further the dangers of accepting agree-
 ment with a personality description as evidence in favor of any
 assessment technique, I asked the twelve to describe them-
 selves by answering true or false to a number of personality
 statements.  All answered true to two of the statements-

 Assessment of Graphology
 "You have a tendency to be critical of yourself" and "You
 prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become
 dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations."
 And ten answered true to a third statement-"While you have
 some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to com-
 pensate for them." Experimenting thus with a few more ques-
 tions, one would soon have enough "true" statements to write
 a full description which every member of a group would agree
 applied to himself.  This kind of demonstration underscores
 the passages in Mr. Laycock's article which call for specific,
 objective, and understandable items of behavior as the cri-
 terion or yardstick by which the validity of any assessment
 technique must be judged.
 Capabilities of Psychological Assessment
 "Where full access is possible, a battery of tests, particu-
 larly of the real-situation type used in OSS, and a careful
 study of the subject's past performance and reputation will
 give as reliable a result as we can expect at this stage of our
 knowledge of man and yield something like a scientific pic-
 ture of his inner workings."  I take this to mean that direct
 assessment of the kind done by my staff in the CIA Office of
 Training is to be preferred over the graphological technique
 when access to the individual is possible.  With this view, of
 course, I should like to agree wholeheartedly. But this brings
 me back to the article's claim that "In most cases, competent
 graphologists can supply reliable estimates on ... disposition
 to talk too much . . . emotional stability under stress . . .
 aggressiveness, resistance, and tenacity . . . attitude toward
 money ... disposition to deceive . . . inclination toward op-
 portunism . . . desire for power . . . willingness to follow the
 lead of others . . . rebelliousness . . . rashness" and "rea-
 sonably good estimates on ... capacity for abstract thinking
 and logic ... ability to deal with people, powers of observation,
 imagination" as well as "a good educated guess" about "sex
 difficulties . . . disposition to engage in criminal activities .:
 disposition to engage in violence against persons."
 Even for the extremely thorough assessment. process con-
 ducted by my staff I would not claim so much.  Either our
 own methods have greater capabilities than we credit them
 with, or the article errs in conceding the superiority of "direct-

 access" assessment over handwriting analysis.  If evidence
 can be produced to establish that graphology can do all this,
 I shall hasten to incorporate it into our assessment process
 and eliminate much of the interviewing and testing we do.
 "There are certain things a graphologist can not tell," writes
 Mr. Laycock.  Certainly my list here would be much longer
 than his.  But I am genuinely puzzled by some of the things
 included in this list, and by the statement that "the graph-
 ologist is entitled to know the writer's age, sex, national origin,
 and profession, since he cannot tell these facts from the speci-
 mens, and they are invaluable interpretive aids."  I am con-
 fused by the inclusion of sex, because there are studies indi-
 cating quite clearly that differences in handwriting do exist'
 which permit determination of sex at a better than chance
 level.  I haven't seen any studies on the other characteris-
 tics, but except for exact profession they are the kind of
 thing I would think might be inferred from handwriting at a
 little better than chance level.
 Psychologists are impressed by the difficulty of making pre-
 dictions about a changing individual in a changing environ-
 ment.  They are very much aware that such predictions can
 refer only to probabilities.  Psychologists desire, therefore, as
 the core of their assessment process, means and techniques
 which have been validated by methodical research.  Tests of
 general intellectual ability, of some aptitudes, and of inter-
 ests, along with information about past behavior, are among
 these means.  New means can be developed only by testing
 claims for special techniques in the same methodical way.
 Prospects for Graphology
 Up until recently the evidence concerning graphology as an
 assessment technique has been so negative that psychologists
 generally have preferred to concentrate on techniques that
 showed more promise. The negative evidence came from stud-
 ies of graphological tenets equating specific handwriting char-
 acteristics, such as upward sloping lines, with specific traits,
 such as ambition. On the basis of such studies, graphology as
 a means of assessment has been lumped with astrology, phre-

 nology, and other systems for reading character from physical
 characteristics such as length of fingers or color of hair.
 Handwriting is, however, the product of a person.   There
 is therefore some reason to expect it might tell something
 about him.  This reasoning, fostered by graphology itself as
 it became concerned with the movements underlying hand-
 writing rather than the handwriting itself, has led to the
 ?              devising of different kinds of studies.  These studies, while
 not yet convincing, do make it clear that the value of graph-
 ology is not yet a closed question.  One of the better ones, for
 example, found that a graphologist trying to infer from hand-
 writing how 50 neurotics would answer 27 questions (1,350
 items in all) achieved an accuracy of 62 percent as against
 the 50 percent to be expected by chance.2  The graphologist
 may have been helped by knowing that all were neurotics, and
 so the 62 percent may be a bit high.  Even taking the data
 at face value, these predictions turned out not much better
 than chance results; but the study suggests that research
 in this area might be more worthwhile than many had
 thought.  It also points to the need for more research to pin
 down just what kinds of things can be predicted and what
 kinds of things cannot.
 In Mr. Laycock's list of things a graphologist can determine
 is included "important changes in character (by comparison
 of present with past calligraphies)."  Research on change in
 handwriting over time and under various conditions appears
 to offer some promise. At least common observation suggests
 that changes are caused by illness, either physical or mental.
 At the present time I do not consider the evidence for
 graphology as an assessment technique sufficiently impres-
 sive to include it in assessments for which we have direct
 access to the individual.  I don't sponsor research on it for
 this purpose as a matter of economics.  I have only so many
 dollars, and I think I will get a better return from other
 assessment techniques.  And even if we did not have access
 to the individual, I'd still place my bets on investigation of
 his past behavior, his education, his jobs, social status, income,
 and so on.

 SECRET                           Assessment of Graphology
 It is interesting that graphologists, according to the article,
 require some of this investigative information (sex, age, na-
 tional origin, and profession) as a prerequisite for their anal-
 ysis.  They also get the informational content of the hand-
 writing specimens themselves.  From these data a number
 of inferences are already possible.  Consider, for example, the
 differences in characteristics one might assume with confi-
 dence between an age 50 female English secretary and a
 21-year-old male German lawyer. I'd be inclined to rely on
 the implications of this information, and would be extremely
 cautious in accepting inferences, whatever their source, that
 were inconsistent with it.  The article claims, for example,
 that "most accountants and bookkeepers can tell you, with-
 out even thinking, how a man feels about money by the way
 he writes a check."  I'd rather have the evidence on how he
 uses his money that can be obtained by looking at his can-
 celled checks. So, I guess, would the banker, who lends money
 on investigation of background and permanence of job, not
 on handwriting analysis.  It is dangerous to allow inferences
 from less well validated information to influence those ob-
 tained from valid sources.
 For the clandestine services, however, graphology as a vali-
 dated assessment technique might have application in a suffi-
 cient number of instances, those where background investiga-
 tion is impossible, to warrant considerable research to deter-
 mine its effectiveness.  I would like to see these studies start
 on whatever simple verifiable characteristics graphologists
 are willing to try.  Should these prove successful, studies
 of more complex traits can be undertaken.
 I can agree with Mr. Laycock that the study should cover
 the abilities of a number of particular graphologists-that
 graphology may be an art, but certainly is not a science.  In
 my mind there is even the nagging question whether it is a
 practical art. A problem with an art is that a particular per-
 son's skill in applying it may change over time.  There is no
 way of knowing whether a practitioner's predictions a year
 later will have the same value as those he made when he was
 tested.  It is for this reason that psychologists, as scientists,
 keep trying to find ways to convert the art of judging people
 to a science. They try to tease out, objectify, and measure the
 basis for their predictions, so that the assessment skill can be

 communicated to others and used reliably with a variety of
 persons in a variety of situations.
 Mr. Laycock is greatly concerned with getting some re-

 on the validity of graphology for specific purposes, the dif-
 ferences between his views and mine on graphology as an as-
 sessment technique, and my concern over the danger of un-
 warranted credence in graphological findings, will persist.
 Psychologists charged with personnel assessment are ready
 to cooperate in such studies.  Their only requirement is that
 the research be so conducted that a group of scientists will

 DEVELOPMENTS IN AIR TARGETING:
 PROGRESS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
 Kenneth T. Johnson
 Four preceding articles in this series described how the USAF
 Directorate of Targets has been seeking to increase its capa-
 bilities by developing mathematical models and other tech-
 niques for the mass handling of data.  This final article will
 look briefly at the progress of these techniques since the arti-
 cles describing them were published and then examine some
 other analytical tools in process of development for the target
 intelligence specialist.
 The three mathematical models previously described were
 the Military Resources Model, the Air Battle Model and the
 Damage Assessment Model.  The Military Resources Model
 estimates the capability of the Soviet Bloc military establish-
 ment, with its supporting economy, to carry out military ac-
 tion and analyzes the effects of planned attacks.  The Air
 Battle Modell war-games the interaction of battle forces on
 the basis of a most exacting layout of both sides.  It answers
 the question, "After x time of the game, to what extent have
 offensive and defensive plans been carried through or dis-
 rupted?"  But it must first be supplied data describing what
 resources are available to each side, what courses of action
 each will attempt, and all other conditions affecting the out-
 come; and the preparation of these data is a demanding task
 and a stimulant for intelligence.  The Damage Assessment
 Models predicts the probable physical, functional, or opera-
 tional effects of atomic weapons on targets or target systems.
 It answers questions of the type, "Did the building collapse?"
 "How many casualties were caused?" The most recent article

 of this series 4 treated these models as illustrating one aspect
 of the manifold problem of data handling, described the Con-
 solidated Target Intelligence File, and highlighted the neces-
 sity for better and faster ways of storing and retrieving in-
 formation.
 The Analytical Models in Operation
 Many months have been spent in developing these models
 to bring the fantastic capacity and speeds of electronic com-
 puters to bear on the increasingly complex data which must
 be considered in making operational decisions.  How are the
 computer techniques working out in practice? The Air Battle
 Model has been in constant use, making test runs to evaluate
 different target systems, battle plans, and strategies.  Lists
 of ground zeros-points of burst-from the Air Battle Model
 have been fed into the Damage Assessment Model for the
 calculation of damage and radiation effects.  These results
 have then been used by target analysts to determine the
 residual capabilities of affected installations.
 The Damage and Assessment Model has kept pace with the
 Air Battle Model's output of ground zeros, and other data re-
 quiring effects analysis.  Improvements in the form in which
 the results of the damage and contamination runs are pre-
 sented have evolved from consultation between analysts and
 machine programmers. The latest of these improvements has
 been effected by feeding into the Model criteria for determin-
 ing automatically from damage and contamination values
 whether an installation is still operational after attack.
 Since publication of the article on the Military Resources
 Model in the beginning of 1958, a series of operational runs
 has been made on its economic grid to show the multiple direct
 and indirect economic effects of Soviet civilian and military
 programs.  Completely effective use of the economic grid is
 still hampered, however, by data gaps in such important areas
 as guided missiles and atomic energy; and aggregations in
 the Model which exclude consideration of certain specialized
 items of equipment limit the results to statements of general
 economic capability.

 Air Targeting
 Developmental work on the military logistics and trans-
 portation grids of the Military Resources Model, in progress
 in the spring of 1958, has provided the basis for the develop-
 ment of a new model covering USSR regional air defense ca-
 pabilities.  This model assesses the capability of a specific
 region-either an air defense district or a penetration cor-
 ridor-to mount defensive sorties and missile firings after its
 logistic and transportation facilities have been damaged by an
 air attack of any given scope and magnitude.  The initial
 model has just been constructed and an initial run made;
 further development is in process.  The construction of this
 new model shows how the mathematical modeling technique
 can be adapted to serve new purposes.
 Models have thus already assumed some of the targeting
 load, but much remains to be done in determining whether
 and how models can be used in other analytical areas. What
 is intriguing for intelligence analysts, however, is that in some
 areas models have brought them to the threshold of a precise
 means for determining what items of information are of criti-
 cal importance, a determination which will provide new, sure
 guidance to collection and analysis activities.  This "sensi-
 tivity analysis," as it is called, is done by rerunning the same
 problem several times with varying parameters to determine
 which variations have a critical effect on the results.  It pro-
 vides also a good antidote to the tendency of analysts, having
 available the models' huge capacity for data, to become in-
 volved in the pursuit of minutiae which have no substantial
 importance for their problem.
 Although the article on Data Handling Techniques ap-
 peared in the most recent issue of the Studies, some new
 gains can be counted here, too.  Of the more than 200 re-
 quests for machine processing of the CTIF already levied by
 analysts, about 65 can be handled by existing programs and
 another seven are now being programmed, leaving a substan-
 tial 128 yet to be translated into machine language.  The
 bridging of the gap between an analyst's statement of his
 needs and the marching orders for the machine requires a
 high degree of rapport between analyst and programmer, and
 this rapport is being developed.  The programmer must dis-
 cuss the requirement step by step, and patiently record each
 step in an ungarbled instruction to the machine.  Laborious

 as this process is, it pays off in a better product, and the
 analyst man-hours that are made available for more difficult
 jobs grow and grow.
 The acquisition of an electronic data plotter has very prac-
 tically enhanced the utility of the CTIF system.  The plotter
 accepts coordinates from a machine tape or from cards and
 records the locations directly on a linear projection map. Pro-
 grams are now nearing completion which by converting lati-
 tude and longitude to linear coordinates will enable the ma-
 chine to plot locations on a map of any projection and any
 scale that will fit on the 48" by 60" plotting board.  Single
 symbols can be plotted at the rate of 65 to 70 points per min-
 ute.  The usefulness of the machine is attested by the long
 queues of waiting analysts eager to short-cut the tedious task
 of massive. data plotting.
 In an earlier paper in this series I General Samford was
 quoted as saying that the extent to which intelligence should
 contribute to the process of war gaming might be disputable
 but that if an advanced war gaming process were kept closely
 in mind during all processes of intelligence preparation, the
 intelligence necessary to a strategy would be better. The valid-
 ity of this statement is already being demonstrated as the need
 for detailed layouts of enemy capabilities reveals inadequacies
 in our estimates.  The operation of the Air Battle Model has
 properly been moved out of Intelligence to the Directorate of
 Plans, but because Intelligence personnel did the pioneering
 work on the Model, the Air Battle Analysis Division in Plans is
 largely staffed with former intelligence analysts.  This ar-
 rangement facilitates not only the feedback of requirements on
 intelligence but also the interpretation of the intelligence data
 to be fed into the Model and the understanding of intelligence
 requirements for data from its output.
 At the Model Application Branch in the Directorate of Tar-
 gets, a cadre of target intelligence analysts has been assembled
 and is being oriented to improve the input data for the Air
 Battle Model and the utilization of its output.  The Branch
 must also keep under review the operations of the Damage As-

 appropriately placed in the Directorate of Targets; new ques-
 tions arise every day about how best to use the existing models
 in solving targeting problems. At the same time it is working
 on the development of new models to handle current problems
 and anticipating other problems which targeting is going to
 face tomorrow.
 The Data Problem
 The inescapable task of assembling intelligence data assumes
 an aggravated form when the data is to be used as input for a
 mathematical model.  It is not that the use of models creates
 a data demand; the data problem is there anyway, models or
 no models. But what the models often do is make the analyst
 face up to kinds of data the likes of which he had never con-
 sidered, for example the number of metric tons of pumps and
 compressors required for each major military component in
 a prewar build-up of forces.  A prolonged bout with the stern
 requirement of a model for enemy data coefficients, enemy
 strike plans, or the capacities of enemy installations can bring
 an analyst to the point of despair.  Yet he can take comfort
 from the ease with which problems can be rerun. The data do
 not have to be perfect the first time, and a rerun with a new
 figure may show that the variation is not of critical impor-
 tance. A capable officer of ours is wont to interrupt a hot de-
 bate over input data with "You don't like our figure? Give me
 one of yours; I'll use it."
 The Consolidated Target Intelligence File described in the
 last article is proving a valuable device in this battle with the
 data and constitutes a giant step in facilitating mechanized
 support of target analysis.  Another giant step is anticipated
 in the near future with the application of the new Air Force
 Intelligence Data Handling System, designated 438-L.  The
 system is scheduled to be operational early in 1962 for the
 Washington area.
 The development of System 438-L was initiated in response

 automatic system of machines and computers, a combination
 of manual and machine methods, or just human beings. The
 contractor is putting a broad selection of talent to work on
 the system, including library scientists, experimental psychol-
 ogists, computer programmers, and computer engineers.
 Although the best approach to a design for this system is
 still being worked out, it is already apparent that it will be
 based on a large-scale, high-speed, general-purpose computer
 to accomplish many tasks.  Such a computer will make feas-
 ible the development of a rich indexing system, not only by
 document but by key words on individual pages.  This index-
 ing system will enhance the ability of analysts to make subtle
 correlations of data and develop significant interrelationships
 which may exist in available information.  Data storage and
 retrieval can be accomplished primarily through microfilm li-
 braries.
 The computer in the system will make possible the fast and
 accurate communication and dissemination of newly collected
 data, notably that necessary for evaluating enemy intentions
 and giving warning of attack.  Many types of information
 must be examined rapidly, for example that obtained by mis-
 sions flown specifically to develop certain intelligence data. It
 will also analyze reports and documents to produce Order of
 Battle, Current Intelligence, Technical Intelligence, etc., ac-
 cumulating bits and pieces of raw information and associating
 them for development into meaningful products.  In target
 analysis it will be invaluable, for example in the evaluation of
 foreign target systems, the charting of foreign air facilities, and
 the development of strategic and tactical targets.
 The retrieval facet of the system may function in any of
 several ways.  A question may be given by an analyst to the
 operator of a Flexowriter or similar device in his working area.
 It would be put into proper form and automatically transmitted
 to a Flexowriter in the computer area, which would print it
 out.  Here it would be checked for format and validity and
 then fed to the computer system.  The computer would dif-
 ferentiate among types of questions.                               The answer to one con-
 cerning evaluated intelligence holdings would be obtained from
 a file of evaluated intelligence directly connected to the com-
 puter system.  As the result of automatic search procedures
 the answer would be printed out or displayed, as appropriate.

 A demand for raw information, on the other hand, might be
 answered in any of three forms or some combination of them-
 a listing of documents or pages pertinent to a study, the docu-
 ments or pages themselves, or statistical information derived
 from the documents. If the document itself were desired, the
 computer system would identify the specific document number.
 This identification would be hand-delivered to a separate raw
 information storage device, which would produce either aper-
 ture cards or a full-size reproduction of the document.
 Information might also be added to the system in several
 ways.  The evaluated intelligence provided by analysts of all
 agencies would be entered through the same Flexowriter-type
 device used for querying the system. Raw information selected
 and extracted from documents by a screening panel would be
 entered as part of an index storage file. The documents them-
 selves would be microphotographed and placed in the raw in-
 formation storage section of the system.
 The analytic application of the system will cover war gam-
 ing, damage assessment, and determining the economic effects
 of military action, as foreshadowed in the mathematical models
 we have described. It will also cover target materials and pro-
 duction control, an almost independent area, under a fairly
 routine application of processing principles.  It will provide
 document security control for all the highly classified informa-
 tion disseminated through the computer. It will make possible
 a more accurate formulation of collection requirements and
 furnish a means of evaluating both the requirements process
 and the collection process. Even our comparatively limited ex-
 perience with the models we have been using gives us. ground to
 anticipate that actual application of the proposed system will
 stimulate continuing development of new analytic techniques
 to enhance the capabilities of Air Force intelligence.
 For target intelligence the 438-L system is indeed going to
 be a quantum jump ahead, and none too soon,  The most in-
 tensive target analysis effort is now directed against Soviet
 guided missiles (especially operational launch sites), air de-
 fense (particularly the SAGE system), and command control
 systems, objectives around which the most stringent security
 barriers are arrayed. The most direct and forthright advances
 against these objectives could come from a successful collection
 effort-a drawing, a paper, a plan, a photograph, a defector.

 But the more important the target to us, the more important
 it is to the Soviet that he deny us information on it, and the
 tougher the collection task. Some people seem even to believe
 that he can continue to be totally successful in this denial in
 the areas where it really counts. This brings us back to mass
 data handling and the possibilities it offers.  The realistic
 solution in these high priority areas may be to break into
 the complex of activities associated with the target and let
 them lead us to it.
 What is suggested is that we collect and process the less
 sensitive information, of which there may be an abundance,
 along with the sensitive. This approach is not new; intelligence
 analysts have always recognized that bits and fragments of
 information about persons, places, things, and movements can
 when assembled, analyzed, and synthesized enable us to make
 a sweeping end run around a formidable security barrier.
 What is new is that science has come up with the technology
 that will permit us to use this practice on a scale and with
 a speed never before possible.  The exploitation now made
 possible of the vast amount of data already on hand in different
 forms in many agencies offers immediate promise.  It gives
 impetus to the Air Force's effort to develop yet better tech-
 niques for the mass handling of data; for the consequences of
 failure to provide target information in these critical fields are
 grave indeed.
 Lest the impression be left that target analysis begins and
 ends with data on individual installations, it is important to
 round out the picture somewhat.  As the Soviet nuclear de-
 livery capability and military might in general have assumed
 greater and greater proportions the targeting emphasis has
 shifted from economic and industrial targets to military forces
 and their immediate supporting resources.  Furthermore, it
 has become more important than ever to draw the full implica-
 tions of the effects of attacks-to translate the physical de-
 struction calculated to result from planned attacks and the
 residual military inventories of men and materiel into terms
 of post-attack operational capability.  The criteria for the se-
 lection of targets and target systems lie in the implications
 of these effects; and in this sense effects analysis is the main-
 spring and director of target selection.

 It is clear that the models and data handling developments
 described in this and preceding papers all contribute in great,
 measure to the central work of target selection and effects
 analysis.  But this is only a part of the picture: the keystone
 of the effort is the human being, the target analyst, who
 emerges as the manager, collator, and interpreter of data, in-
 structing the machines, guiding the collectors, using finished:
 intelligence produced by other analysts in their specialized
 fields, and finally producing integrated intelligence on live
 enemy forces on a command basis. In these force studies the
 interrelationships of the forces, their bases, support facilities,
 and restraints of time, space, command, communications, and
 competition for common support items such as transportation
 and fuel are analyzed in detail.
 The force study is prepared on a command-wide basis. The
 producer in effect puts on the enemy hat and examines the
 interrelationships of the forces in his command, say the First.
 Long Range Air Army,, the installations they occupy, the sup-,
 port facilities and activities necessary for their continued oper-.
 ation, their training and maneuvers. This presentation of real
 life force intelligence gives new meaning to the importance of.
 targets and target systems. It provides an integrated rational
 basis for the prediction of wartime deployment and missions
 and the prediction of qualitative and quantitative peacetime
 growth.  Finally it provides the framework within which
 targets and target systems may be nominated for attack, a
 clear understanding of the reasons they are nominated, and,
 through analysis of the output from machine runs on the
 damage and contamination model, a realistic interpretation
 of the operational effects of given attacks.
 The preparation of force studies is under way.  One has
 been completed on the Soviet Northern Naval Fleet, another
 on the Ground Forces in the Caucasus area.  Studies will
 eventually blueprint the opportunities for air action against
 all forces which threaten the United States and its allies and
 will be maintained current for immediate application in war
 planning and war gaming.
 Future Data Problems

 ahead he is awed.  As he thinks toward the 1970's he realizes
 that he must deal with enemy weapon systems not yet in

 being, ones which Soviet strategists are currently engaged in
 planning to bring into the Soviet arsenal at that time. Quali-
 tatively, they will attempt to outdo US and Allied weapon tech-
 nology.  Quantitatively, they will try to provide so many and
 varied means for fast delivery of nuclear weapons that US de-
 fenses will be insufficient to fend off the attacks and US offenses
 not quick or massive enough to neutralize the Soviet capability.
 It is the target analyst who must wrestle with the realities of
 this problem and figure out how to cope with the threat.
 In this future period the collection and evaluation of target
 data will be performed with improved technology, and conclu-
 sions will be reached and decisions made with greater speed.
 Some of the technology for collection devices can be predicted
 now. For example, aerospace vehicles with a variety of sensing
 devices-electronic, radar, infrared-promise data in volumes
 never before dreamed of. The prospect that unfriendly neigh-
 bors can look into each others' back yards day in and day out
 is going to have a profound effect upon what they decide to try
 to hide, how they decide to hide it, and what they decide is
 just not worth hiding.  Some of the new data, for example
 infrared detector readings which give warning of missiles being
 prepared for launching or being launched, will go directly to
 warning centers for immediate decision on US and Allied ac-
 tion.  All of it will be grist for the analyst, to be evaluated
 against the background of the data stored in the 438-L or
 some improved system, and all will automatically be added to
 this massive store. From it the analyst, using advanced tech-
 niques, must draw conclusions on which to base action in an
 era when minutes can decide eternity.

 CRITIQUES OF SOME RECENT BOOKS ON
 INTELLIGENCE
 MY TEN YEARS AS A COUNTERSPY. By Boris Morros.  (New
 York: The Viking Press.  1959.  Pp. 248.  $3.95.)
 The story told in this book is that of a Russian immigrant
 to the United States-the author-a person of sound educa-
 tional background and musical competence, who after reaching
 professional heights in the entertainment and movie worlds got
 himself involved in espionage.  According to his account, his
 desire to assist his aging parents in Russia led to a recruitment
 proposal by the Soviets for clandestine work against the United
 States, which he accepted under the threat of reprisals to his
 family.  Subsequently, and quite belatedly, he came into con-
 tact with the FBI and under its guidance continued his associa-
 tion with the Soviet intelligence service for ten more years as a
 double agent or counterspy.  The fruit of this effort was the
 dissolution of an important Soviet spy ring.
 The value of the book is not the story told.  Tales of the
 same ilk in numbers line the operational coffers of intelligence
 organizations throughout the world.  Its true merit from a
 professional point of view is embodied, rather, in the opera-
 tional data-those intimate, indispensable, but hard-to-come-
 by details-that it reveals concerning the formidable yet vul-
 nerable chief target of U.S. counterintelligence, the Russian
 intelligence service.  The validity of this assessment becomes
 immediately clear when one considers the cost in time, money,
 and personnel of procuring such details through other clan-
 destine operations. Yet here are intimate and damaging data
 on RIS objectives, personnel, modus operandi, and vulnerabili-
 ties overtly available for the modest price of a book.  The
 obvious conclusion is that the coordination of overt and covert
 information remains an important and obligatory aspect of the
 intelligence process.
 The Communist cause is more than a political creed; it is a
 religion to an otherwise atheistic group.  Its devotees are or
 are supposed to be dedicated men who preach and live by the
 credo that selflessness is the cornerstone of their religion.  The
 concept of the Cause as overriding all considerations of per-

 sonal loyalty and ordinary ethics is illustrated in passages like
 the following:
 "How in hell did Myra-who, like you, pretends to be my
 friend-write that terrible report about Katerina?" "What
 else could she do?  She only did it for your own good."
 Myra looked like a full-blooded passionate woman. I am
 sure that if it had been necessary for the sake of the Cause
 to be unfaithful to her husband, she would not hesitate to
 give herself.
 I never got a chance to use that Sunday punch because of what
 he said next: "No matter what the Communists do, I'll always
 be true to them, ideologically."
 Korotkov's affection for his old friend was truly sincere.
 I am convinced of that....  But then he asked, "What in the
 world can I do if he continues to cause me so much trouble?"
 "Oh, he will come out of it in time," I said.  "And if he does
 not?  I suppose then there will be nothing for me to do but
 order him liquidated."
 [Comment on Beria's arrest:]  "After all, to preserve the
 system requires continuous examination and re-examination
 of each of us."
 It is important for the intelligence professional to understand
 this religion and the Marxist code of ethics, for they permeate
 the relations among Communists, the attitude of the intelli-
 gence center toward its agents, their operations, and even the
 conduct of the lowliest sub-source on the intelligence totem
 pole.  In them lies the secret to their thinking and behavior.
 They are a source both of great strength andof critical vulner-
 ability. For the utter self-abnegation required by the Cause is
 something more-or less-than human.  This human vulner-
 ability is illustrated in Morros' words:
 If a man like Soble is useful to his masters in Moscow, he
 is also an ever present danger to them.  They have no choice;
 they must use men like him, and the Jack Sobles, no matter
 how often they are put through the psychological meat-
 grinders, remain men.  Like everyone else, like all people
 everywhere, they have their vanity and pride, their weak-
 nesses and strengths.
 "Idealists, you see," said General Korotkov, "have something
 soft in them always ... and that soft side exposed to suffi-
 cient temptation will corrupt them."
 If it were up to [Korotkov], he would not let one of his
 men stay in America for more than a year.  He said the

 capitalist regime, with its easy living and emphasis on false
 values, was too corrupting.
 [Soble] was pulled both ways.  He believed with all his heart
 in the "Communist ideal." At the same time he wished to take
 his wife and son out of the ever-present danger that was an
 integral part of his role as a secret agent operating in a
 foreign country.  The two dreams he nourished for the future
 were dragging him in opposite directions.
 The clue to the strange fate that caught up with Jack Soble
 may lie in his passionate love for his son and his wife.  In the
 non-Communist world this sort of devotion is accepted as the
 norm.  In the Soviet world it is regarded with deep distrust.
 If a man lets family love interfere with his duties to the state,
 the Kremlin considers his usefulness ended.
 Moscow recognizes well this vulnerability in the persistent
 humanness of human nature, but its corrective efforts serve
 only to create other vulnerabilities, the rigidity of strong cen-
 tralization and the resentment created by its mistrust of its
 people:
 "People back Home sat there with their maps, deciding what
 should be done in a certain city and how it should be done,
 even though they had never been in the United States them-
 selves....  No detail of the plans they make at Home can
 be changed without permission....  They should know by
 this time that emergencies arise even in a checker game that
 one cannot foresee."
 They are always testing you, trying to find out if your sym-
 pathies have shifted, listening for the chance remark that
 will betray a weakness or character flaw....  Even when
 their conversation appears casual, there is some purpose
 behind it.
 These contacts, I was soon to find out, were continually
 being changed.  The NKVD never trusted even its own people
 very far, did not believe it wise or safe to leave any secret
 agent in the same city for any great length of time.
 Reviewing the Soviet intelligence effort as portrayed in this
 book, we observe specific differences between it and the parallel
 operations conducted by Western powers-the Soviet stress on
 sex both as a tool for the control of women agents and in the
 procurement of information from men; the regular use of
 threats for recruitment and control of agents; the extensive
 countersurveillance mounted over rendezvous and tetes-A-tete;
 murder as a means of agent disposal.  But in broader view we

 find that the principal difference lies in the insecurity of Soviet
 operatives stemming from their continual struggle to remain
 human beings under the demands of an autocratic, inflexible,
 and unrealistic credo that seeks to convert them into unques-
 tioning instruments of the Cause.
 THE HOUSE OF SECRETS.  By Gordon Young.  (New York:
 Duell, Sloan & Pierce. 1959. Pp. 179. $3.75.)
 Gordon Young, a veteran foreign correspondent whose name
 frequently appears on these pages, gives in this book an ac-
 count of the Narodno Trudovoi Soyuz (People's Alliance of
 Russian Solidarists), or NTS, as the group is more commonly
 known.  The NTS is an organization of Russian emigres who
 believe that Communism in the Soviet Union can eventually be
 overthrown through popular revolution.  To hasten this day,
 it has been active since 1930 in trying to introduce propaganda
 into the USSR.
 During World War II members of the group reached the
 German-occupied areas of Russia and attempted to organize
 NTS cells.  By infiltrating various German institutions and
 agencies, they had a direct influence on the initiation and fur-
 therance of the Vlasov movement.  This period of "collabora-
 tion" with the Germans was ended by the Gestapo's arresting
 the Solidarist leaders. After the war the NTS was reorganized
 in West Germany, began a boisterous search for Western sup-
 port in all quarters, and in recent years has carried on a
 sizable propaganda program through leaflets, pamphlets,
 books, radio, and personal contacts with Soviets travelling
 abroad.
 Mr. Young's description of the NTS organization, of the
 ideology of Solidarism which it proposes as an alternative to
 Communism, and of the group's propaganda operations is
 highly readable if somewhat superficial.  The author has ob-
 tained most of his information from interviews with NTS
 leaders and members, rather than from the fairly large mass
 of available documentary material.  Necessarily, the picture
 of the NTS that emerges is an extremely favorable one.

 Available information does corroborate the bulk of the fac-
 tual material in Mr. Young's book. There are exceptions, such
 as the grossly exaggerated claim that within the past five
 years more than 100 million copies of NTS newspapers and
 leaflets have been dispatched into the Soviet Union. (The
 100 million figure is more probably the amount of literature
 printed by the NTS Posev publishing house for the five-year
 period.)  By and large, however, the story of the group's un-
 equal, often tragic, sometimes heroic struggle against the
 Soviet Goliath is told without the wishful thinking that has
 characterized pro-NTS publicity in the past.
 For the professional intelligence man, The House of Secrets
 will be useful as an easy-to-read, rapid review of this militant
 emigre group.

 COUNT FIVE AND DIE. By Barry Wynne, as told by Colonel
 William Eliscu, O.B.E. (New York: Ballantine Books.  1959.
 Pp. 152.  $0.35.)
 This purports to be an OSS story, a recent addition to the
 literature of the over-stuffed American pocket.  It was origi-
 nally published in England early in 1958 1; it subsequently
 appeared in a Dutch edition 2 and in a movie version.    Mr.
 Eliscu (who allegedly took part in the operation) is one of the
 sponsors of the OSS television feature which has appeared in
 the United States since the fall of 1957.
 Both the English and American editions claim to be true
 accounts except for changes in "certain minor incidents and
 the names of leading participants."  The American version
 reinforces this claim with a purported introduction by Gen-
 eral Donovan.  General Donovan's alleged accreditation of
 the story makes the book of interest to the intelligence spe-
 cialist and injects an element of mystery into what appears
 to be a hastily scaled-up version of a movie script. The mys-
 tery: How was General Donovan led to underwrite as factual
 and truthful, if he did, an account of OSS activity so patently
 a figment of the imagination?

 The book's story line is as diaphanous as the habit of its
 principal character,  one Hannie Herodsen, a toothsome
 Abwehr agent. At the story's start in the spring of 1943, she
 is plying her blond lissomeness on a "nameless Lt. Colonel"
 of OSS Algiers.  Having learned from the hapless officer the
 place and time of the Allied attack on Sicily and perhaps the
 details of some OSS missions, she repatriates to Germany by
 submarine at the end of 1943.  She receives the personal at-
 tention of Canaris' successor, Kaltenbrunner, who sends her
 early in 1944 to England.
 Infiltrated by submarine in March, Hannie is the same
 Dutch refugee she was in Algiers: cover in her case is as
 light as her baggage.  She sets herself up in a London apart-
 ment and proceeds to take over direction of a resident German
 IS net consisting of four individuals, including two radio opera-
 tors, which had presumably been successful in defying Brit-
 ish security forces from the beginning of the war.  Her prin-
 cipal target is the Americans; her mission is to ascertain the
 time and place of the upcoming Allied attack on the continent.
 With a lucky-though, one feels, predestined-assist she locks
 with an OSS officer in London, this time a Captain. Traces of
 her Algiers activity carried in the heads of officers in OSS
 London are her downfall.
 A joint British-OSS operation ("Stampede") is laid on un-
 der OSS supervision to permit the Captain to develop the re-
 lationship unwittingly with Hannie and guide her into a spe-
 cially tailored Dutch resistance organization in London.
 Thereafter Hannie, a singular example of an unwitting dou-
 ble agent, is built up and fed deception material on the cross-
 channel attack. OSS London sacrifices the lives of two Dutch
 resistance operatives in order to make this a better fly-trap.
 In a cops-and-robbers ending the GIS net in England is rolled
 up by OSS (and the British), but Hannie is permitted to de-
 liver the tainted information to Berlin.  The outcome, accord-
 ing to the author, was a diversion of Nazi military forces to
 Holland,  a  significant  contribution to  unbalancing  the
 strength available to oppose the Allied landing in Normandy.
 Hannie forfeits her life to Kaltenbrunner when it is realized
 that her information was false.

 All of this is fiction purporting to be fact. An examination
 of OSS and other official materials has produced no evidence
 to authenticate the account, even if one allows the maximum
 for changes "in certain minor incidents and the names of
 leading participants."  Beginning with Mr. Eliscu's colonelcy,
 his O.B.E., and his claim of participation in the "Stampede"
 operation, the story comes apart at the seams when subjected
 to critical review.  The record of German intelligence activity
 in World War II knows no character or composite identifiable
 with Hannie Herodsen.  It is now known that the British
 security services controlled or neutralized all GIS operations
 in the UK during that period. There is no trace in OSS docu-
 mentation of an operation entitled "Stampede" or otherwise
 identifiable with what is described in the book. The extensive
 interrogations and testimony of Kaltenbrunner in 1945-46
 contain nothing to support the story.  Finally, the official
 Dutch resistance has been unable to identify the two indi-
 viduals purportedly sacrificed.
 The mystery of the Donovan imprimatur is, therefore, of
 more than casual interest: the endorsement was decisive in
 quieting the skepticism of a reviewer in one of the national
 news magazines.3  The issues raised by Mr. Eliscu's TV por-
 trayal of OSS were put sharply in the press in 1957.4  Because
 the OSS is the foundation of U.S. national intelligence and
 counterintelligence abroad, the questions raised by Count Five
 Newsweek, January 26, 1959, page 106: "If Count Five and Die were
 not introduced and vouched for by Gen. William J. Donovan . . . it
 could easily be mistaken for a highly implausible piece of spy fic-
 tion.  However, British author Barry Wynne's story is true, and
 it's a corker."
 ' The New York Times, September 1957, observed: "There could be
 an engrossing TV series in some of the courageous and imaginative
 achievements of the men who served in O.S.S.  But these are stories
 that should be presented with careful fidelity to detail and without
 the shabby, melodramatic flourishes that marked this telecast."
 In November 1957 the Washington Daily News, in a similar review,
 questioned whether "it's a good idea for the OSS to be memo-
 rialized on TV by the series under that name," which it found to
 be "nothing more than the same old foreign intrigue stuff that
 has cluttered the little screen since 10-inch days."

 WILLIAM J. DONOVAN AND THE NATIONAL
 SECURITY
 Allen W. Dulles
 It was my privilege to be associated with William J. Donovan
 both as a lawyer between the wars and then during World
 War II, when I served under his command in the Office of
 Strategic Services.  His courage and leadership made a pro-
 found impression on me. I should like to convey to you some-
 thing of that impression, and some idea of what his pioneer-
 ing has meant to all of us.
 His interest in our national defense and security started
 early.  In 1912, as the war clouds gathered in the Balkans,
 he helped organize Troop I of the New York National Guard.
 In 1915 he went to Poland as a member of a Rockefeller com-
 mission charged with relieving the great shortage of food
 there, and particularly of milk for the children.  When the
 National Guard was mobilized in 1916, he came home to join
 his Troop I on the Mexican border.
 Then came his fabulous career in World War I with the
 165th Infantry of the 42nd Division-the renowned "Fight-
 ing 69th" of the Rainbow Division.  Here he got his nickname
 Wild Bill.  The legend goes that after the regiment landed in
 France he ran them five miles with full packs to limber them
 up.  As the men were grumbling with exhaustion, Donovan
 pointed out that he was ten years older and carrying the
 same 50-pound pack.  One of the men replied, "But we ain't
 as wild as you, Bill!" Another story has it that the honorary
 title was transferred to him from a professional baseball
 pitcher of the same name whose control left something: to
 be desired.  Whatever its origin, the title stuck.
 The citations Colonel Donovan received in France tell the
 military story: On July 28, 1918, a Distinguished Service Cross:
 "He was in advance of the division for four days, all the while
 under shell and machine gun fire from the enemy, who were
 on three sides of him, and he was repeatedly and persistently

 William J. Donovan
 counterattacked, being wounded twice." Three days later the
 Distinguished  Service  Medal:  "He  displayed  conspicuous
 energy and most efficient leadership in the advance of his
 battalion across the Ourcq River and the capture of strong
 enemy positions.... His devotion to duty, heroism, and pro-
 nounced qualities of a Commander enabled him to success-
 fully accomplish all missions assigned to him in this impor-
 tant operation."
 And then, for action in combat in the Meuse-Argonne on
 October 14, the highest of all awards, the Congressional Medal
 of Honor: ". . . Colonel Donovan personally led the assaulting
 wave in an attack upon a very strongly organized position,
 and when our troops were suffering heavy casualties he en-
 couraged all near him by his example, moving among his
 men in exposed positions, reorganizing decimated platoons
 and accompanying them forward in attacks.  When he was
 wounded in the leg by a machine gun bullet, he refused to be
 evacuated and continued with his unit until it withdrew to a
 less exposed position."  "No man ever deserved it more," said
 General Douglas MacArthur, who had seen this action.
 Three aids were killed at Donovan's side in the course of
 these actions.  Reverend Francis P. Duffy, the chaplain of
 the 69th, said, "His men would have cheerfully gone to hell
 with him, and as a priest, I mean what I say."  Several years
 ago General Frank McCoy, describing his close association
 with Bill Donovan during World War I, said he was one of the
 finest soldiers he ever saw in his life-long service in the Army,
 that he had the qualities of the ideal soldier, judgment and
 courage and the respect and affection of his men.
 . In 1922 Donovan was appointed U.S. Attorney in Buffalo,
 N.Y., and shortly thereafter he entered a new phase of his
 career.  In 1924 President Coolidge reorganized the Depart..
 ment of Justice and called Bill to Washington to be assistant
 to the Attorney General, heading the Antitrust Division. Here
 he showed both his fearlessness in law enforcement and his
 intense interest in making law a practical vehicle to promote
 the economic welfare.

 He was firmly convinced that individual freedom is vitally
 linked to our system of free enterprise.  He attacked re-
 straints and monopoly with effective enthusiasm.  In the
 Trenton Potteries case he won Supreme Court agreement that
 price fixing among dominant competitors is of itself illegal.
 He brought under legal attack such diverse industries as oil,
 sugar, harvesting machinery, motion pictures, water trans-
 portation, and labor unions.  Yet he recognized that the un-
 certainties of our antitrust laws pose serious business prob-
 lems, and accordingly instituted the practice of giving ad-
 vance opinion on the legality of proposed mergers and other
 business activities that might be questioned under the law.
 Offered the Governor Generalship of the Philippines when
 President Hoover entered the White House in 1929, Bill turned
 it down and went into law practice in New York City. He was
 soon appointed counsel to several of the New York bar asso-
 ciations in connection with a general overhauling of the bank-
 ruptcy laws.  During this period he also served as counsel to
 a committee for review of the laws governing the State's Pub-
 lic Service Commission.  In 1932 he unsuccessfully ran for
 Governor of the State.
 As a corporation attorney he won in 1935 the important
 Humphrey case, in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that
 the President could not arbitrarily remove a chairman of
 the Federal Trade Commission.  He also won an important
 decision in the Appalachian coal case, upholding the right
 of coal producers to organize a joint selling agency in eco-
 nomic self-defense.  This agency is still in existence.
 During this period of corporate law practice, Bill never lost
 his interest in world affairs. He took time off to visit Ethiopia
 during the 1935 Italian invasion.  He was in Spain during its
 Civil War, carefully observing the Axis efforts to test their
 new equipment in these foreign adventures.
 Presidential Emissary
 In the early days of World War II Donovan was called into
 action by President Roosevelt. In 1940 he was sent on a fact-
 finding mission to England and in 1941 to the Balkans and the
 Middle East. Anthony Eden told Washington that the Balkan

 mission had been most helpful to the British assessment of
 the situation there.
 From the first trip, the one to Britain not long after Dun-
 kirk, Bill had brought back to Washington a very important
 report.  You will recall there was skepticism at that time in
 some quarters as to whether the British could effectively
 carry out Churchill's thrilling promise, "We shall defend our
 island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the
 beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight
 in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we
 shall never surrender."  Donovan reported to Roosevelt that
 the British could and would do just that.  This had a direct
 effect on American policy.  He also warned Harry Hopkins
 that the Germans might strike toward Suez through French
 North Africa-a prophecy that soon became a reality.
 Donovan also recommended to the President that the
 United States start preparing immediately for a global war.
 He particularly stressed the need of a service to wage un-
 orthodox warfare and to gather information through every
 means available.  He discussed this idea at length with his
 close friends in the Cabinet, Secretaries Knox and Stimson,
 and with Attorney General Jackson.
 The seeds which Bill planted bore fruit.  In July 1941 the
 President established the Office of the Coordinator of Infor-
 mation and called Donovan to Washington to head it.  In
 original concept this Office was to combine the information
 and intelligence programs with psychological and guerrilla
 warfare.  This proved to be too big a package for one basket
 and in 1942 the organization was split.  That portion of it
 coordinating wartime information services became the Office
 of War Information, and the intelligence and unorthodox war-
 fare work, where Bill's greatest interest lay, was put under
 an Office of Strategic Services.
 Truly one of the remarkable accomplishments in World
 War II was the organization and activity of the O.S.S.-feats
 which would never have been achieved without Bill Donovan's
 leadership and his vast interest in the unorthodox, the novel
 and. the dangerous.  Starting from scratch in 1941, he built

 William J. Donovan
 an organization of about 25,000 people that made a real con-
 tribution to the victory.  Many of the deeds of O.S.S. will
 have to remain secret, but with the passage of time many
 have been disclosed.
 Bill conceived the O.S.S. as a world-wide intelligence organi-
 zation that could collect the facts necessary to develop our
 policy and war strategy.  He was convinced that Axis secrets
 were to be found not only in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo, but in
 other capitals and outposts around the world.  So he imme-
 diately set about dispatching officers to key spots in Europe,
 Asia, and later Africa.  The pay-off justified the, effort.  He
 was able to obtain information of great value from carefully
 established agents with contacts in Berlin, in the German
 High Command, and in the Abwehr, the German military in-
 telligence service.  The work of these agents gave us advance
 information about the development of German jet aircraft,
 about German work with heavy water in the effort to develop
 a nuclear weapon, about the V-1's and V-2's, and about the
 plot against Hitler.
 In addition to his organization for the collection of strategic
 intelligence, Donovan provided means to help gather tactical
 information in the combat areas, forming teams of parachut-
 ists-Americans as well as indigenous-to drop behind enemy
 lines.  But not content with passive intelligence, he also
 wanted action. He knew that well-organized guerrillas operat-
 ing behind enemy lines in areas where the local population
 was friendly could wreak havoc on enemy lines of communi-
 cation and tie down troops that could otherwise be used in
 combat.  Working with our allies, he built up teams of lead-
 ers and communicators to organize resistance in the coun-
 tries occupied by the Nazis, Fascists, and Japanese.  There
 were also air drops of supplies and equipment deep behind the
 Axis lines in France and Italy, in Burma and elsewhere.
 These action teams were well supported by a headquarters
 technical group, which under Donovan's guiding hand was
 imaginatively developing new ways to sabotage the enemy
 war effort and new gadgets either to harass the enemy or
 help our own cause-equipment ranging from the most so-
 phisticated communications systems to a repellent used by
 personnel forced to bail out in shark-infested waters.  Not all
 of the products were so practical as these. Ambassador David

 William J. Donovan
 Bruce, one of Bill Donovan's closest associates, in a recent
 tribute to the General's qualities of leadership, vividly de-
 scribed his excitement over ideas.  Ambassador Bruce wrote,
 and I subscribe to every word of it:
 His imagination was unlimited.  Ideas were his plaything.
 Excitement made him snort like a race horse.  Woe to the
 officer who turned down a project, because, on its face, it
 seemed ridiculous, or at least unusual. For painful weeks under
 his command I tested the possibility of using bats taken from
 concentrations in Western caves to destroy Tokyo [with de-
 layed action incendiary bombs].  The General, backed by the
 intrigued President Roosevelt, was only dissuaded from further
 experiments in this field. when it appeared probable that the
 cave bats would not survive a trans-Pacific flight at high
 altitudes.
 Many ingenious ideas to work on the nerves of the enemy
 were born in another part of the O.S.S.-the Morale Opera-
 tions Branch.  This was the undercover psychological war-
 fare branch of the war effort.  While the Office of War Infor-
 mation was telling the enemy about the magnitude of the U.S.
 war effort and getting the facts and figures well circulated,
 this Branch was dedicated to confusing the enemy and break-
 ing their will to resist.
 General Donovan was convinced that there were great un-
 tapped reservoirs of information in this country about for-
 eign areas which had become of vital interest in the war
 effort-data in the archives of business organizations, infor-
 mation acquired abroad by American scientists, academicians,
 and tourists, and also that held by foreign experts residing
 here.  He set about to collect this information and data and
 a mass of photographs of foreign areas.  As the war reached
 more and more areas of the globe, this information came to
 have great importance.
 He also realized the importance of analyzing and present-
 ing information to the policy makers in readily usable form-
 one of the most difficult tasks of intelligence.  He established
 in the O.S.S. a major branch for research and analysis, as-
 sembling in Washington the best academic and analytic
 brains he could beg, borrow, or steal from the universities,
 laboratories, libraries, museums, the business world, and other
 agencies of government.  Theirs was the task of probing the
 political and economic aspects of the war, assessing both our

 allies and our enemies, both neutrals and the occupied lands.
 Theirs also was the task of estimating Axis vulnerability and
 war potential and the staying power of the Russians, who even
 then told us almost nothing about themselves.
 Bill Donovan had the qualities a great intelligence officer
 must have.  He took nothing for granted and at the same
 time was insatiably curious.  He had a good nose for the
 news: a faint whiff of something unusual would speed his
 mind into a dozen possible explanations, generally as ingeni-
 ous as the wiles of the enemy.  He wanted to see things on
 the spot and judge for himself. He was constantly on the
 move and drove his staff wild trying to keep him from places
 they thought too exposed.  He also put them into a state of
 near exhaustion trying to keep up with the pace he set him-
 self.  One of his great qualities was his dedication to the
 men who served under him, and his ever-readiness to give
 them his full support. He, in turn, had their complete loyalty,
 respect and affection.  I vividly recall a personal instance.
 For about two years, from November 1942 to September 1944,
 I was working for Donovan in Switzerland, then entirely en-
 circled by the Nazi-Fascist forces.  In September 1944 the
 American Seventh Army, coming up from Southern France,
 broke through to the Swiss border near Geneva. Under orders
 to return to Washington to report, I had joined a group of the
 French underground in a secret hideout in the Rhone Valley
 between Geneva and Lyon to await a clandestine flight to take
 me to London.  As far as I knew, General Donovan was in
 Washington and had not the slightest idea where I was hidden.
 After weather had held up my plane for several days, there
 was a knock on the door of my hideout in the middle of the
 night. It was one of General Donovan's aides, telling me that
 the General was waiting for me at the nearest available airstrip
 south of Lyon, which had just been evacuated by the Nazis. He
 had been searching the area for some twenty-four hours be-
 fore he discovered where I was.
 Together we flew back to London, arriving, I well remem-
 ber, on that day in September 1944 when the Germans launched
 the first of their ballistic missiles on the British capital. It de-
 scended near the center of London after a flight of nearly two
 hundred miles. Both the American and the British intelligence
 services had been closely following the development of this
 77

 Approved For Release 2005/01/05 : CIA-F  Pl7~8-03f92JA0o00~300250001-7
 missile. I have often wondered why, in this country, our tech-
 nicians and strategists failed to see earlier the full implica-
 tions of the success of the V-2, as I believe the Soviet did, and
 to realize much earlier in the game that the combination of
 the ballistic missile with the atomic bomb, which was then
 about to be unveiled, could change the nature of war and the
 security position of this country.
 Few men of his time were more alert than Donovan to the
 new threats that might develop.  In late 1944, sending a man
 to Cairo to take over the direction of activities at that post, he
 gave oral instructions to the effect that the main target for
 intelligence operations should now be what the Soviets were
 doing in the Balkans rather than German activities in the
 Middle East.  The German threat was receding.  The Soviet
 danger was already looming.  Operations were to be adjusted
 accordingly, although such instructions could not be put into
 official writing.
 Also, while the war was still in progress, General Donovan
 was looking forward to the peace.  He foresaw the need for a
 permanent organization not only to collect intelligence but, per-
 haps even more important, to coordinate the whole govern-
 ment intelligence effort and see that the President and policy
 makers get comprehensive and consolidated analyses to guide
 their decisions as to our course of action.
 The Father of Central Intelligence
 In the fall of 1944 Donovan presented to the President a
 paper proposing an intelligence organization operating on a
 world-wide scale and having direct responsibility to the Presi-
 dent. While it was not to take upon itself the responsibilities
 of the departmental intelligence services, it would act as a co-
 ordinating mechanism for all intelligence. The paper stressed
 that the proposed organization would have no police or sub-
 poena powers and would not operate in the United States. Pres-
 ident Roosevelt expressed considerable interest in this propo-
 sal, and a week before his death in April 1945 asked Donovan
 to poll the Cabinet and the heads of agencies concerned for
 comment on it.  These comments, ranging from the opinion
 that there was no need for such a peacetime organization to
 the belief that it was vital to national security, make interest-
 ing reading today.

 William J. Donovan
 NFI ORA17DUi! FOR TRF PRESIDENT
 Pursuant to your note of 31 October 1944 1 have given con-
 sideration to the organization of an intelligence service for the
 post-war period.
 In the early days of the war, when the demands upon intelli-
 gence services were mainly in and for military operations, the
 OS" was placed under the direction of the J03.
 Once our enemies are defeated the demand will be equally
 pressing for information that will aid us in solving the problems
 of peace.
 This will require two things:
 1.  That intelligence control be returned to the supervision
 of the President.
 2.  The establishment of a central authority reporting
 directly to you, with resg,onsibility to frame intelligence objec-
 tives and to collect end coordinate the intelligence material re-
 quired by the Tzecutivo Branch in planning and carrying out
 national policy and strategy.
 I attach in the form of a draft directive (Tab A) the means
 by which I think this could be realised without difficulty or
 lose of time.  You will note that coordination and centralization
 are placed at the policy level but operational intelligence (that
 pertaining primarily to Department action) remeina within the
 existing agencies concerned.  The creation of a central authority
 than would not conflict with or limit necessary intelligence func-
 t.ions within the Army, Navy, Department of State and other agencies.
 In accordance with your wish, this is net up an a permanent
 long-range plan.  But you may want to consider Whether this (or
 part of it) should be done now, by executive or legislative action.
 There are common-sense reasons why you may desire to lay the keel of
 the chip at once.
 The immediate revision and coordination of our prevent intelli-
 gence system would effect substantial economies and aid in the
 more efficient and speedy termination of the war.
 Information important to the national defense, being gathered
 now by certain Departments and agencies, is not beint,. used to full
 advantage in the war.  Coordination at the strategy lov~',l would
 prevent waste, and avoid the present confusion that leads to waste
 and unnecessary duplication.
 Though in the midst of war, we are also in a period of transi-
 tion which, before we are aware, will take us into the tumult of
 rehabilitation.  An adequate and orderly intelligence system will
 contribute to informed decisions.
 We have now in the Government the trained and ,peciallzed
 personnel needed for the task.  This talent should not be dispersed.

 MEMORANDUM
 Apropos of your memorandum of November
 g, 1944, relative to the establishment of a
 central intelligence service, 1 should appreciate
 your calling together the chiefs of the foreign
 intelligence and internal security units in the
 various executive agencies, so that a consensus of
 opinion can be secured.
 It appears to me that all of the ten execu-
 tive departments, as well as the Foreign Economic
 Administration, and the Federal Communications Com-
 mission have a direct interest in the proposed
 venture.  They should all be asked to contribute
 their suggestions to the proposed centralized
 intelligence service.

 William J. Donovan
 Donovan received an Oak Leaf Cluster to his Distinguished
 Service Medal for his wartime work, but his plan to develop the
 O.S.S. into a peacetime intelligence organization was beset with
 conflicting views. Some would have the new organization, like
 the O.S.S., report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while others pre-
 ferred that it be put under the Department of State.  And
 there was controversy as to whether one individual could or
 should be responsible for presenting a consolidated view of the
 intelligence picture to the policy makers, rather than leave this
 the collective responsibility of the chiefs of all the intelligence
 services.  No agreement had been reached by the time the war
 ended in August 1945, and the O.S.S. was soon ordered 'dis-
 banded.
 A proposal for a central intelligence organization such as
 Donovan had conceived was contained in the first draft of the
 so-called unification act submitted by Ferdinand Eberstadt to
 Secretary Forrestal in October 1945. And in January 1946, to
 preserve assets while the issue was being settled, President
 Truman issued the order creating the Central Intelligence
 Group, which later picked up some of the functions and per-
 sonnel still remaining from the O.S.S. and other scattered in-
 dependent intelligence activities.
 Bill Donovan's dream was not yet completely realized. Con-
 gress still had to act.. After extensive hearings to which Gen-
 eral Donovan contributed important testimony, the provisions
 for a Central Intelligence Agency were incorporated into the
 National Security Act of 1947, which created a Department
 of Defense and set up the National Security Council to advise
 the President and oversee the new intelligence agency. In July
 1947 final executive and legislative endorsement was thus given
 to the views which Donovan had been striving to have accepted.
 I have always felt that the decision to place the C.I.A. under
 the President, as Donovan recommended, was wise and neces-
 sary.
 Bill Donovan's restless energy had turned elsewhere with
 the disbanding of O.S.S., although he never gave up his in-
 terest in the organization or stopped hammering home to the
 public the necessity for providing adequate and accurate in-
 formation to the policy makers of the government in order to
 protect the national security.  His varied talents were being
 called on for other important services.  His legal ability 'nd

 about the extent of their activities in the Greek civil war from
 seeping out.
 The more General Donovan saw of the Soviets in action the
 more concerned he was with alerting the American people to
 the dangers. He co-authored an article in the Yale Law Journal
 for July 1949 presenting a "Program for a Democratic Counter
 Attack to Communist Penetration of Government Service."
 The article said:
 The Communist Fifth Column . . . seeks to identify itself
 with every social grievance.  Russian espionage and subver-
 sive operations are made up of trained and skilled spy tech-
 nicians and intelligence officers, propaganda specialists, ex-
 perts in spreading rumors.                                Instruction is planned so that
 the agent will find it as easy for a minority to operate a labor
 union, or a pacifist league, or any other such movement, as
 itis for a minority group to control a large corporation when
 most of the stockholders take no active interest in the man-
 agement.
 In 1950 President Eisenhower, then President of Columbia
 University, presided on the occasion of the award to Bill Dono-
 van of the Alexander Hamilton Medal, given by the Columbia
 Alumni Association for distinguished service and accomplish-
 ment in any of the great fields of human endeavor.  In 1953
 the President named him Ambassador to Thailand. At this
 time the ancient kingdom of Siam was a main target for Com-
 munist subversion.  With a vigor that belied his years, this
 remarkable man of 70 threw himself into the job of helping
 the Thais bolster their defenses against the Communists so
 that this keystone of anti-Communism in Southeast Asia could
 continue free.
 Upon his return to the United States one might have ex-
 pected him to seek retirement, but nothing was further from
 his mind. He became National Chairman of the International
 Refugee Committee and the director of that group's fight
 against the Soviet program to induce Russians who escaped
 from Communism to return home.  At the time of the Hun-
 garian Revolution he turned his energies to aiding the refugees
 of this unsuccessful effort to win freedom from Soviet tyranny.

 William J. Donovan
 He was Chairman of the American Committee on United Eu-
 rope from its inception in 1949, and through this organization
 he continued to further the efforts of our major allies in West-
 ern Europe to achieve a greater unity in the face of Communist
 danger.
 Even after ill health forced his retirement to Walter Reed
 Hospital, General Donovan continued his interest in the fight
 against Communism and the development of our intelligence
 work. In recognition of his role in the intelligence field, Presi-
 dent Eisenhower in 1957 awarded him the National Security
 Medal.  The citation reads:
 Through his foresight, wisdom, and experience, he foresaw,
 during the course of World War II, the problems which would
 face the postwar world and the urgent need for a permanent,
 centralized intelligence function.  Thus his wartime work con-
 tributed to the establishment of the Central Intelligence
 Agency and a coordinated national intelligence structure.
 In February 1959 he passed away at Walter Reed among the
 men he had led. As soldier, public prosecutor, leader of the bar,
 director of the Strategic Services in wartime, public servant
 in time of peace, he had left his record with the nation he served
 so well.  He was a rare combination of physical courage, in-
 tellectual ability, and political acumen.  He was a mild-man-
 nered man, with an insatiable curiosity, an unflagging imag-
 ination, and the energy to turn his ideas into action.
 The heritage of Bill Donovan is written in the national se-
 curity.                                           He woke the American people to the need of a per-
 manent peacetime intelligence service. He bestirred Washing-
 ton into creating a mechanism whereby all the government
 components which receive information on what is going on any-
 where in the world pool their knowledge, share their interpre-
 tations, and work together to make one unified estimate of
 what it means. He helped place intelligence in its proper per-
 spective and stimulated the policy makers to recognize its role
 in determining American policy abroad.  He was one of the
 architects of an organization that should keep our government
 the best informed of any in the world.
 History's epitaph for William J. Donovan will be:
 He made his nation more secure.

 CRITIQUES OF SOME RECENT BOOKS ON
 INTELLIGENCE
 A STUDY OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. By General Cheng
 Chieh-min.  (Taipei: Kuo-chia An-ch'uan-ch'u.  1958.  Pp.
 706.)
 This work, whether or not it was so intended, is a summation
 of the experience and studies which have made General Cheng
 an authority in his field. While in substance it contains little
 that has not been presented elsewhere, its Chinese point of
 view gives a fresh perspective to familiar subjects.  The au-
 thor's background includes extensive research into Western
 thought, philosophic and military, from the writings of the
 ancient Greeks to training publications of the United States
 Army; but it also includes a solid grounding in Chinese thought
 and strategy from Lao-tse and Confucius to Mao Tse-tung and
 Chiang Kai-shek.  Clausewitz and Jomini, Lenin and Liddell
 Hart, Toynbee and Sherman Kent are seen in a new light when
 interpreted through the thinking of Hsii.n-tzu and Mencius,
 Sun-tzu and Szu-ma Kuang, Sun Yat-sen and Chiang.
 The author, at the age of 60, in poor health and in semi-
 retirement, is still Director of the National Security Bureau,
 the highest intelligence agency in the Nationalist Government.
 A graduate of the second class of the Whampoa Military Acad-
 emy in 1925, he studied in Moscow and Western Europe, served
 as combat commander and general staff officer in China, and
 had liaison duties with various Allied commands during World
 War II.  He has been consistently close to the Generalissimo,
 a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomin-
 tang, Vice and Deputy Minister of National Defense, Director
 of Military Intelligence, Director of the Office of Mainland Oper-
 ations, and a member of the President's Advisory Committee
 on Strategy.  He spent 1957 in "a year of convalescence," re-
 vising and expanding his two previous works on intelligence
 into the present study.
 General Cheng states that the purpose of his book, designed
 for the Chinese military community, is to correct long-stand-
 ing misapprehensions about the nature of intelligence work,
 and to arouse interest or furnish guidance in a sadly neglected
 field. He proposes to take up in order "all questions connected
 with military intelligence" with a view to establishing a com-

 plete and sound foundation for those who may be called upon
 to work as intelligence officers.  Considerations of security and
 limitations of space, however, force him to gloss over details
 of intelligence organization and specific techniques of applica-
 tion.
 He has nevertheless achieved a comprehensive study of the
 huge field marked out for treatment, embracing national pol-
 icy, the nature of intelligence, national strategic intelligence,
 military strategic intelligence, combat intelligence, counterin-
 telligence, and psychological warfare, and including specifics on
 strategems, signal intelligence, the intelligence process, and
 intelligence training. He draws a thousand examples from as
 many sources-Hannibal's campaigns, the Napoleonic era, the
 two world wars, and every stage of Chinese history. He some-
 times yields to a passion for categorizing and occasionally
 belabors seemingly obvious points; but such shortcomings seem
 inevitable in the light of his announced purpose to fill a void
 in the Chinese literature on intelligence. They are more than
 offset by the insights he gives into Nationalist Chinese ideas
 of national policy and strategy and the role of intelligence in
 their formulation and execution.
 The author's discussion of such matters as the function of
 intelligence, its several types, the stages of the intelligence
 process and their interrelations, or intelligence training and
 its supervision follows generally the lines of standard Western
 works on the subject. More stimulating, to a Westerner at any
 rate, is his development of the concept of intelligence as the
 basis for effective strategems and for economical victory, the
 foundation of every type of activity in cold or hot war, and so
 the tool without which no adequate decision can be made, no
 determined policy executed.  Here the argument is peculiarly
 Chinese.
 General Cheng himself feels that he is taking a traditionally
 Chinese view, as opposed to Western glorification of power and
 naked force, when he says, quoting President Chiang, "War is
 based essentially on benevolence, though its methods are sav-
 age; war has peace for its end, though its means are terrible-
 even barbaric."  He thus considers war the last-ditch defense
 of the people's welfare, to be waged only when there is no other
 means of safeguarding the welfare of the people in a "peace
 which is the external manifestation of benevolence." But even

 victory in war, he emphasizes, does not necessarily mean profit
 for the nation; a military triumph can leave the people and
 the government far worse off than if there had been no war.
 Therefore any victory, as Sun-tzu insisted, must be economical.
 The sage military leader is the one who "fights without battles,"
 who "creates victory out of opportunities offered by the enemy."
 It is precisely here that intelligence is given its most impor-
 tant role and that the value of "strategems," repeatedly em-
 phasized throughout the book, is most clearly illustrated.
 Strategems "are the struggle of wits in which intelligence
 copes with intelligence; they are unconventional but legiti-
 mate expedients, a method of war in which deception of the
 enemy is used as the only means to attain a predetermined
 objective. Under all conditions, favorable or unfavorable, they
 are the most valuable, most economical, and most effective ac-
 tivity of warfare."  The author's pronouncement that strate-
 gems are to be used against enemy, neutral, and ally alike,
 together with his statement that there are inevitably differ-
 ences of goals and policies between allies and "today's allies are
 tomorrow's enemies," shows the vigorous nationalism of his
 thinking. He believes that strategems are an aspect of strategy
 gravely neglected in Western studies.
 It is unfortunate, with respect to these revelations of Chinese
 thought, that this authoritative book is not available in Eng-
 lish. Since, however, the Chinese concepts of peculiar interest
 are scattered widely through the massive work, translation
 in toto or in significant part would hardly be worth while. For
 the Western student of intelligence it will probably remain
 little more than a reference, difficult of access.
 WHY MEN CONFESS. By O. John Rogge.  (New York: Nelson.
 1959.  Pp. 298.  $3.95.)
 The evaluation of the Chinese indoctrination process used
 on Americans during and immediately after the Korean War
 remains a topic of lively interest, and the search for antidotes
 to this kind of indoctrination gives purpose to continued
 studies of its nature.  The dissemination of the Code of Con-
 duct by the Defense Department, with its strong emphasis on
 training, has resulted in many attempts to synthesize current
 knowledge of the process in manageable and teachable form.

 washing" has become so well established, not only with the
 man in the street but with many whose association with in-
 telligence work should make them more sophisticated or at
 least better informed, that the problem of furnishing a better
 foundation for understanding, combatting and resisting Com-
 munist indoctrination becomes formidable.
 Kinkead's In Every War But One,' written in support of the
 Code of Conduct, explicitly discounts any occult art of brain-
 washing, but in its straining to dramatize the need for better
 morale among enlisted men it bypasses the problem of pre-
 paring air force or intelligence officers, for example, for the
 kind of interrogation and indoctrination they may face as pris-
 oners of the Communists.  But if Kinkead's viewpoint is too
 narrow, it is almost impossible to round out the picture by
 pointing to books with a wider vista or with more specific appli-
 cability to the intelligence specialist. The more general books
 range from the obviously well-intentioned but scientifically in-
 accurate ones of Hunter 2 to those like the quasi-scientific but
 highly controversial Rape of the Mind, by Joost A. M. Meerloo.>
 The definitive book on the indoctrination process particularly
 as it pertains to the intelligence specialist is yet to be written.
 Why Men Confess is certainly not the definitive book, but it
 does represent an important contribution to a growing liter-
 ature.                       It treats the Communist process as one manifestation
 of a standard inquisitional method used by others today and
 in the historical past, and it becomes therefore an encyclopedia
 of the history of confession and a sort of concordance of literary
 allusions to the confession process. It does not have the jour-
 nalistic polish of Hunter or Kinkead or the sensationalism of
 Meerloo.  The skill of a practiced lawyer has been applied to
 produce what is in effect a brief on the subject as seen from his
 experience and reading. His experience is largely in the "con-
 fessions" of the criminal courts, which are so often fallible and
 sometimes dictated by pathological motives; his reading has
 been historical, literary and scientific. As far as can be deter-
 mined, he has been both catholic and thorough in these re-

 searches. Consequently, even though fault can be found with
 some of its conclusions, his work is very useful as a source book.
 It is apparent that Mr. Rogge is more at home with his-
 torical and literary research than in evaluating scientific ar-
 ticles.  Except in citing the Senate testimony of experts and
 the descriptive (rather than evaluative) paper of Hinkle and
 Wolff,`' he uses scientific authorities inappropriately.  His
 rather heavy emphasis on psychoanalytically based concepts
 that are at worst obscure and at best controversial is unfortu-
 nate.  The book would be more solid if he had stuck to the
 approach he used with his literary and historical materials.
 Dostoevski, Gogol, and Beck and Godin represent much more
 effective documentation for his position than Reik, Berg, or
 Freud. Perhaps this criticism would not be necessary were it
 not for the blurb on the dust jacket (for which the author is
 presumably not responsible) ". . . Mr. Rogge tells us all that
 psychology knows about the compulsion to confess."
 Mr. Rogge uses his historical concordance to present a brief
 for protecting individuals against the inquisitional methods of
 modern states, including our own:
 The inquisitional method, which the communists have ex-
 ploited for a quarter of a century, is a throwback to the past
 and should be abandoned, especially in view of the growth and
 power of modern states.  (p. 29)

 force will explain the many confessions to communist, French,
 and clerical inquisitors. But there was one thing which the
 different regimes. of these inquisitors had in common: the in-
 quisitional system.  (p. 199)
 All roads led to the same conclusion: the primitive and irra-
 tional nature of most of the mind together with the power of
 modern states, our own included, make it necessary to abandon
 not only the inquisitional technique but also any of its
 challenged fruits. The world should have done with investi-
 gative authorities questioning a suspected individual, like a
 powerful parent interrogating a helpless child.  The inquisi-

 tional system stands in the way of the development of equali-
 tarian societies and the growth of human beings into mature
 individuals.  (p. 246)
 Woven into this thesis and making up the climax is his belief
 that silence is a right of man that is basic, inviolable, and the
 only true defense against authoritarianism.  The dust jacket
 promises a further application of these ideas in quoting Mr.
 Rogge: "Why Men Confess is the first of three books on the sub-
 ject of confessions. I am now working on the next, which will
 deal with the First and Fifth Amendments."
 THE SILENT LANGUAGE.  By Edward T. Hall.  (New York:
 Doubleday.  1959.  Pp. 240.  $3.95.)
 Practically everyone in and out of government is full of
 ideas for practical steps to make U.S. representatives abroad
 more effective. Dr. Hall's book seeks to lay a theoretical basis
 for these practical efforts, to the extent that they are directed
 toward minimizing the reaction that takes place when one
 moves into the area of a foreign culture.  Some people have
 chosen to call this reaction a "culture shock."  Hall explains
 it as the "removal or distortion of many of the familiar cues
 one encounters at home and the substitution for them of
 other cues which are strange."  Proceeding from the proposi-
 tion that "most people's difficulties with each other can be
 traced to distortions in communication," The Silent Lan-
 guage "treats culture in its entirety as a form of communica-
 tion" as it seeks to outline "a theory of culture and a theory of
 how culture came into being" and to present "the technical
 tools for probing the secrets of culture."
 The author is in a position to know what he is writing about.
 He is an anthropologist who has travelled and worked abroad
 to develop principles and concepts for teaching U.S. repre-
 sentatives how to be more effective.  He has done such teach-
 ing in the State Department, the Strategic Intelligence
 School, and elsewhere.  He now makes this subject his busi-
 ness.
 The study points out basic differences in languages and ways
 of speaking, but emphasizes the actions which speak louder
 than words, and particularly the kind of communication that
 takes place "out of awareness."  "This notion," it says, "that
 there are significant portions of the personality that exist

 out of one's own awareness but which are there for everyone
 else to see may seem frightening.  The point, however, is a
 crucial one and will grow in importance as men begin to grasp
 its implications." Another subtle complication in the commu-
 nications process of particular significance for anyone who
 anticipates service abroad is brought out in elaborating the
 fact that "people reared in different cultures learn to learn
 differently."
 Some readers may not be persuaded of the validity of the
 author's conceptual construction.  His time, space, and order
 as communications media seem unnecessarily abstruse.  His
 "map of culture" may be over-billed as "a mathematics of
 cultures."  His classification of behavior patterns as formal,
 informal, and technical is an effort toward unattainable pre-
 cision.  He uses a great many words in a specialized sense
 when it seems that a garden variety of meaning would serve
 the purpose just as well.
 But dissatisfactions such as these only serve to point up
 Dr. Hall's own contention that there is much work to be
 done in this field.  The understanding of foreign cultures is
 critical to intelligence operations and to intelligence analysis;
 and such a considerable contribution of new thinking as The
 Silent Language makes can but stimulate more progress
 toward this understanding.

 North Africa reveals little new substantive information.
 Mosley's report, reviewed in the last number of the Studies;"
 will be of more interest to the professional intelligence officer.
 Eppler has told an adventure story in a romantic, intensely
 personal style characteristic of much of the recent spate of
 German war reminiscences.  The fact that a motion picture
 is being made in Germany based on Operation Condor is per-
 haps indicative of the nature of the book.
 We learn nothing from Eppler about how he was spotted
 and recruited by the Abwehr; the story opens with his post-
 ing to Rommel in North Africa, and the first 130 pages deal
 with the problems and experiences of his 4,000-kilometer trip
 across the Sahara to reach the target area.  He gives passing
 mention to technical intelligence preparations for the mis-
 sion, such as documentation, communications equipment, and
 clothing.  Inasmuch as he is arrested by British security
 forces on page 216 and devotes himself from then on to his
 treatment by his interrogators, it will be seen that he gives
 relatively little space to his actual work in Cairo.  Details on
 the recruiting of sub-agents are almost completely lacking,
 as well as a useful account of what, if anything, was accom-
 plished. One incident is described, the separating of a British
 courier from his pouch of battle plans by the belly-dancer
 Hekmath Fathmy; a satisfactory account of this is available
 from Mosley.  Mosley also deals at some length with the
 tracking down of Eppler by British security forces, to which
 Eppler's own. account adds nothing of significance.
 Eppler never again made radio contact with Abwehr base
 stations after his initial report upon arrival.  The two special
 radiomen assigned to service him had been posted too close to
 the front by order of Rommel and had been captured with
 their codes during a raid by the Long Range Desert Patrol.
 Eppler was cut off (eingemauert) after this in order to pre-
 vent a play-back.  Eppler's radioman tried night after night
 without success to make contact with base station, and the
 title of his story would therefore more logically read Cairo
 Calling Rommel. This book can safely be passed by, especially
 by those who have read The Cat and the Mice.

 PROPAGANDA ANALYSIS. By Alexander L. George.  (Evans-
 ton, Ill.: Row, Peterson and Company.  1959.  Pp. 287.                                $6.)
 This scholarly and imaginative book by one of Rand Cor-
 poration's social scientists is of special significance because it
 evaluates propaganda analysis techniques actually used in
 an operational situation and has therefore had to consider
 the dynamics of politics, rather than the formal structures
 to which the usual scholarly study in political science is de-
 voted.  Mr. George's validity research is based upon the anal-
 ysis of German propaganda done by the FCC's Foreign Broad-
 cast Intelligence Service during World War II.  He examines
 this in the light of information obtained later from German
 war documents and German officials, which provides a unique
 opportunity to validate the inferences drawn from propaganda
 bearing on intelligence problems and questions. critical to
 Allied policy.  Some 80 percent of the FCC inferences that
 could be scored proved to be accurate.
 The reader who does not make a specialty of propaganda
 analysis will be most interested in Part III, "Methodology
 and Applications," in which 20 case studies are presented to
 illustrate the broad range of intelligence problems approached
 by the FCC.  The analysts' reasoning is reconstructed and
 their inferences matched against the available historical rec-
 ord on such important problems as the question of a German
 offensive against Russia in 1943, German expectations in 1942
 of an Allied second front in North Africa, the German public's
 attitude toward the Nazi information policy, and a predicted
 change in the propaganda presentation of military setbacks
 on the Russian front.
 The first case study, on the German V-weapons propa-
 ganda, is cited as one in which the FCC analysts did not do so
 well as their British counterparts.  The brilliant British anal-
 ysis may be known to some readers. Reasoning from the sub-
 stantiated hypothesis that German propaganda would not
 deliberately mislead the German people about an increase of
 German power, it concluded that the Germans actually had
 some sort of new weapon and were not merely bluffing.  It
 accurately described the German leaders' evaluation of the
 new weapon and made the tentative estimate, based on subtle
 shifts in the propaganda, that in November 1943 the Germans

 expected to have it ready between mid-January and mid-April
 1944.  This estimate proved amazingly accurate.
 As Mr. George writes:
 The deduction concerning the German leaders' private esti-
 mate of the timing of the V-weapon was based upon ingenious
 use of a general observation about Nazi propaganda practice.
 The British analyst reasoned that Goebbels would be careful
 not to give the German public a promise of retaliation too far
 ahead of the date on which the promise could be fulfilled.
 ... Taking a number of factors into account, the British
 analyst reckoned that Goebbels would give himself about three
 months as the maximum period ... to propagandize forth-
 coming retaliation in advance.
 One of the reasons advanced for the lower caliber of FCC
 analyses on this problem is that the FCC analysts, unlike the
 British, worked on their own and were not asked to coordi-
 nate their V-weapon research with that of other intelligence
 specialists.  They assumed that other intelligence techniques
 more appropriate than propaganda analysis were being ap-
 plied to the problem. This lack of coordination may also have
 damaged the quality of their analysis in another case study
 cited: they were not informed of TORCH or briefed to look
 for indications of Nazi concern over possible invasion of North
 Africa, and so continued to search for signs of the Nazi atti-
 tude toward a possible second front across the English Chan-
 nel or in northern Europe.
 These two cases, in both of which the analysis was directed
 toward predicting a major action, are not regarded as covering
 the range of situations with which propaganda analysis can
 fruitfully deal.  The author recognizes and discusses at some
 length the possibility that leaders may decide to forego any
 propaganda preparation which might reveal a planned action
 in advance.  In either event, he points out,
 The value to the policy maker of inferences assessing the
 nature and objectives of the major action once it is taken
 should not be underrated; in many cases they overshadow in
 importance the usefulness of having predicted the action
 before it occurred.
 Writing for scholars and experts, Mr. George has set him-
 self a much subtler task than presenting these interesting
 case studies.  He has sought: (1) to identify general types

 of inference made about conditions which helped to determine
 the communication content (for example propaganda goals
 and techniques, "situational factors," and elite estimates,
 expectations, and policies) ; (2)  to identify other possible de-
 terminants about which the FCC did not attempt to make
 inferences, and then to depict the relationship among all the
 various factors making up the system of behavior; and (3)
 to identify reasoning patterns in individual inferences and
 codify the more general methods, direct and indirect, that
 were used. Out of this thorough and painstaking study comes
 his cautious conclusion:
 It seems.that propaganda analysis can become a reasonably
 objective diagnostic tool for making certain kinds of in-
 ferences and that its techniques are capable of refinement
 and improvement.
 The book is not easy to read, in part because of both unde-
 fined and overrefined terminology.  The author never defines
 "propaganda," but apparently uses it interchangeably with
 other undefined terms, "propaganda communications," "politi-
 cal communications," and "public communication."  Yet
 propaganda is distinguished from "mass communication,"
 also undefined.  Readers may find quite confusing the rela-
 tionships between propaganda analysis, communications anal-
 ysis, content analysis, quantitative analysis, and nonfrc-
 quency analysis.                                        And many a reader may never get beyond
 a choker on page 79, in the introduction to Part II:
 4. Dichotomous attributes (that is, meaning or nonmeaning
 characteristics which can be predicated only as belonging or
 not belonging to a given unit of the communication material) 4
 If he persists, however, footnote 4 on page 81 will refer him
 to page 96, where he can learn that a dichotomous attribute
 is merely "the presence or absence" of a designated symbol
 or theme.
 Addressing an academic audience which historically has
 tended to make content analysis synonymous with count-
 ing, the author overstates his criticism of quantitative tech-
 niques in propaganda analysis.  The casual reader may miss
 his references to the fact that quantitative techniques are im-
 portant in the first elementary step in analyzing propaganda,

 that is in describing its content, and his judgment that "an-
 other deficiency of FCC's procedure was its failure to make
 use of systematic quantitative procedures in evaluating cer-
 tain aspects of Nazi V-weapon propaganda."                                          Debate over
 quantitative vs. qualitative techniques is actually beside the
 point.  The real question is how best to combine these tech-
 niques in attacking each specific intelligence problem.
 Despite these minor shortcomings, it is gratifying to find
 such an eminently qualified and objective expert as Mr. George
 reaching conclusions like the following:
 Provision must be made for examining all of the output of
 a propaganda system and for evaluating its over-all propa-
 ganda strategy.  Any division of labor which divorces trend
 analysis on individual subjects from cross-sectional analyses
 of the entirety of propaganda and propaganda strategy may
 result in incorrect or misleading interpretations of specific
 trends.
 The propaganda analyst makes the basic assumption that
 propaganda is coordinated with elite policies, but he needs
 more concrete knowledge which he can obtain only from a set
 of empirically derived generalizations about an elite's opera-
 tional propaganda theory.  ... [He also] requires knowledge
 about technical expertise and skillfulness of propaganda sys-
 tems under scrutiny and that of individual propagandists em-
 ployed therein.
 The investigator must have rather specific, detailed knowl-
 edge of the propaganda organization whose output he is
 analyzing in order to appraise the situational context-who says
 it, to whom, and under what circumstances.  . . . Comparison
 of what is said to different audiences is generally of consider-
 able value in making inferences.
 In propaganda analysis, it is typical for the investigator to
 be concerned with establishing slight changes in propaganda
 lines or minute or subtle differences in the wording employed
 by different speakers or by the same speaker to different
 audiences.

 COMMUNICATION TO THE EDITORS
 Dear Sirs:
 This letter is prompted by the suspicion that B. B. Ben-
 nett's diverting essay, "The Greater Barrier," (Studies, Fall
 1958) on the need for good English prose in intelligence was
 not calculated only to entertain, which it did, but was also in-
 tended to instruct, which, regrettably, it did not.  The very
 solemnity of your journal compels the assumption that be-
 hind the author's frivolous shoals ("Chaucer, Shakespeare,
 Conrad, O'Neill, Wolfe, Spillane" [imagine putting Wolfe in
 there!]) lies the open water of Serious Purpose.  The reader
 is admonished at the outset that "the time is upon us when
 we should face and begin to penetrate a barrier even greater
 than that of foreign languages-the English language bar-
 rier." Face it we then do, throughout much of the remainder
 of the article.  But penetrate it we do not.
 The article does seem about to get down to business in the
 section called "Spying the Land," devoted to discovering three
 constituent parts of the barrier, or perhaps factors which
 obscure its existence-"Self-Exculpation" (which is merely
 the universal human tendency to avoid recognition of self-
 guilt) ; the "Literary Bent" (a common subjective failing [or
 triumph, depending on who has it]) ; and the forced "Viability
 of the language," with its offspring, "linguistic chameleon-
 ism." But having identified these characteristics of bad writ-
 ing, the author abandons us, the article ends.  It is necessary
 to identify symptoms in order to diagnose an illness, but we
 do not ordinarily stop there and seek to cure the disease with
 a mere analgesic.  The proper pathology finds the agent re-
 sponsible for the condition and then treats it with antibiotics,
 not aspirin.  The problem with diseased writing is not the
 determination of the all-too-obvious symptoms, but the iden-
 tity of the causal virus.
 in the estimates, where a "predictive conclusion," your au-
 thor says, is "useful only to the extent that it is precisely
 qualified."  Can this be an accurate axiom?  We think not.
 As a matter of fact, estimates which are too liberally sprinkled
 with precise qualifiers sometimes seem to lose their way.
 A word or two must be put in here in defense of the writing

 To the Editors
 There is still room, we think, even in an estimate, for sugges-
 tions, degrees of emphasis, perhaps innuendo.  For many
 readers, the neat shadings of probability are either lost or soon
 forgotten.  What is more often remembered is the general
 drift of a paper, the over-all impression shaped by many
 things, qualifiers among them.  Thus the writer of an esti-
 mate, though duty-bound to assign exact degrees of prob-
 ability if he can, must also remember that he is usually creat-
 ing more a rounded image than a sharp picture.  We do not
 mean to rise here in defense of slovenly presentation or in-
 exact qualification; we merely hope to refute the unkind no-
 tion that an estimate must stand or fall solely on the strength
 or weakness of its adverbs and adjectives, important as they
 are.
 Moreover, the precision gained by assigning such words as
 "possible" and "probable" a value on a mathematical scale
 appears to upset your author most of all: by using mathe-
 matics, he says, we have "departed the realm of language."
 The fact that a word has a mathematical meaning, however,
 does not entitle him to suggest that it is no longer a part of
 our language.  Words, after all, are used to express feeling or
 thought, mathematical or otherwise.  Should we follow his
 argument to its absurd end and conclude that using the word
 "oak" would propel us from the "realm of language" into the
 realm of trees?
 Beyond distinguishing the estimate from other varieties,
 "The Greater Barrier" makes no attempt to subdivide cate-
 gories of intelligence writing.  That is too bad, for there is no
 such thing as intelligence writing in general.  Not yet, any-
 how.  And if that's what Dr. Bennett and the Office of Train-
 ing would like to establish, then woe to us all.                          There is not
 now, nor should there be, a common school of prose for, say,
 current intelligence, national estimates, and technical memo-
 randa. There are certain standards of good practice common
 to all intelligence writing, but most such standards can be
 applied to all prose; Self-Exculpation, the Literary Bent, and
 Viability are certainly not the exclusive properties of the in-
 telligence community.
 Perhaps, in some instances, we should admit that learning
 to write is a hopeless task; some of us just cannot master it.
 Why should this be any more disgraceful than the proposi-

 lo t
 tion that some of us just cannot draw, or paint, or sculpture?
 But let us assume that most of us are not completely hopeless,
 and need only apply to the Office of Training for instruction
 in the art. No special talent is needed to draw a recognizable
 chair, nor any great gift to write an understandable sentence.
 And presumably, with training and experience, the minimal
 chair or sentence can be improved upon.
 Now one critical ingredient in such training and experience
 is not mentioned by your author and might be overlooked in
 the OTR.  We should not begin by endlessly drawing chairs
 or endlessly writing sentences.  First we must look at chairs.
 And first we must read before we write. Any normally percep-
 tive person, exposed to a quantity of good reading, will soak
 some of it up. There is no point at all in instituting a course
 in creative writing, intelligence writing, or any other kind
 of writing for persons who have not read.  This is not to say
 that reading will make it so. Not all readers are writers. But
 there is no such thing as a writer who has not read.  And
 while this is-or should be-obvious, it is all too frequently
 forgotten.
 Exhorting us to write better, to communicate more clearly,
 and to surmount the Greater Barrier is a pious exercise but
 one with little hope of practical accomplishment.  It will re-
 mind those who probably cannot that they should.  It may
 also remind those who can that they can.  It may even lead
 to some worthwhile self-examination for those who are some-
 where in between.  But until Dr. Bennett loses his modesty
 and tells us how he penetrated the barrier, he must, in all
 good grace, rest content, albeit surrounded by all of us self-
 exculpitators.
