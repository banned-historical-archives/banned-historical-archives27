 The attention                     the Kremlin as well as the non-So-
 viet world continued to be focussed this week on the outcome
 of the financial crisis in the UK (see page 2). The  re lln,
 hoping that the western world's economic difficulties may
 develop into the long-awaited collapse of capitalism, may
 delay further aggressive moves. Meanwhile, the nations Western Europe are hoping that talks between British and
 US Officials will point the way to a solution of their Increas -
 ingly crucial balance =of -?paymen  and trade expansion prob-
 lems.
 Meanwhile, statements by Marshal Tito, announcing
 the closing of the Greed -Yugoslav border and implying that
 the Trieste issue could be settled by direct Yugoslav-Italian
 agreement, provide further indications that Tito's deterior-
 ating relations with the Kremlin are forcing him to look
 for western political and economic support (see page' 6).
 Sharp Italian reaction to the virtual incorporation of the
 Yugoslav zone of Trieste into the 'ugoslav economy, how-
 ever, will make it politically Impossible in the immedia.te
 futewre for the Italian Government to accept a compromise
 division of the Territory of Trieste.

 WESTERN  EUROPE
 Dollar Crisis   The growing worldwide dollar shortage,
 especially critical in the UK and
 increasing concern to the countries of Western Europe,
 continues to be the primary problem facing the non-Soviet
 world in its efforts to regain economic stability. With prewar
 production levels largely exceeded, the UK financial crisis
 has underscored the difficulty of the remaining balance.of-
 payments and trade expansion problems facing the EC
 the relaxation in cold war tension indicates that the Kremli
 is also closely watching for the outcome   the present
 nations. How the difficulties for other ECA nations will be
 resolved will depend to a large extent on what measures the
 takes within the next few months to solve the critical
 British dollar shortage. Pending the outcot a of current
 talks with Commonwealth and US officials, the UK will pro-
 bably mark time, taking no steps other than the temporary
 measures advocated by Chancellor Cripps last week. The
 immediate problems of the. UK have been further aggravated
 by the dock strike, which does not appear appreciably nearer
 a settlement despite the declaration of a state of emergency
 and the assumption by the government   special dictatorial
 powers to deal with the crisis. (Continued refusal by the -auk
 and file   labor to realize the disastrous effects of their
 attitude will materially reduce the Labor Governmentds
 chances of success in the next general elections.) Mean-while,
 economic dislocations in the western. world. Because Marxist
 dogma flatly guarantees the eventual collapse of the capitalistic
 world as the competing nations struggle for their economic
 existence, the Kremlin may delay any further ag&ressive
 moves in the East-West conflict   the hope that the present
 difficulties may develop into the long-awaited collapse
 capitalism.

 GERMANY
 Electoral Maneuvers  The major political parties of west
 Germany, by granting sizeable rep-
 resentation to refugees, will probably increase their party
 following (see pageii $) and block to some extent the develop.'
 ment of a large
 , potentially, dangerous social group. The
 refugees, discontented over delays in the passage of legis?
 ldation granting them financial relief and, the disproportionately
 high unemployment rate in their ranks, have had no legal outlet
 because occupation authorities have: (1) refused to license
 expellee political parties on either Land or zonal levels; and
 (2) prevented the. major parties in Bavaria and Lower Saxony
 from establishing special refugee electoral districts. The
 Christian Democrats and Socialists, however, are offering
 substantial representation to refugee candidates on their
 party lists in some of the Laender, in an attempt to prevent
 the eight million expellees from supporting the parties
 the extreme right or left.
 FRANCE
 Communist Strength  Communist potential for damag=e.
 the French economy has increased
 materially within recent months as a result of tightened
 Communist control within the General Confederation of
 Labor (CGT) and the. extension of CGT influence in, the field
 of labor-management consultation. Although popular support
 for Communism has declined in France and membership in
 the. CGT has fallen from 3 to 2 million, Communist influence
 over the CGT has been strengthened by replacement of un-
 dependable CGT officers with, militant and disciplined Party

 members. Moreover, the Communists through the CGT
 have gained control of 80% of the. consultative industrial
 plant committees required by French law to represent labor
 and management in major industries. For example, the CGS'
 controls these committees in nine of the ten nation  zed air-
 craft factories and exercises approximately the same pro-
 portionate influence in the metallurgical and coal industries.
 These committees advise management on problems of pro-
 duction, prices, and social welfare, and the CGT has been
 attempting to extend committee jurisdiction to wages. Thus,
 by strengthening its control within the CGT and within the
 industrial committees, the Communists have enhanced their
 capabilities for industrial espionage, sabotage, and plant
 seizure as well   for a major strike campaign reportedly
 decided upon for early fall.
 FRENCH NORTH AFRICA
 French Strength  French military strength in North Africa,
 particularly Morocco, is. now believed
 adequate for the maintenance of internal security and the
 suppression of any foreseeable native uprising. French
 military forces, which had been. seriously depleted by June
 following the transfer of troops to Indochina, have been re-
 inforced by such measures as: (1) the recall of reserves
 and personnel on leave from Indochina; (2) intensified local
 recruiting; and (3) an increase in the allotment of conscript
 to North Africa.

 TRIESTE
 Ilan React1on The forcel  ess of the Italian Governmennt!s
 response to Tito's recent incorporation of
 the Yugoslav zone of Trieste into the Yugoslav economy makes
 an early solution of the Trieste problem extremely w9kely.
 In reacting. to this move by Tito, the Italian Government has
 strongly reiterated Italian claims to all c the Free Territory
 Trieste, has lodged official pro =its with the US, UK, and
 France (which in March 194.8 jointly proposed the return of
 the Territory to Italy), and h  suspe.aded trade negotiations
 with Yugoslavia. The vigor of the Italian reaction to the Y o-
 slav move may in part   an attempt to compensate for the
 embarrassment Italy is undekgoing al this moment on the c; v:,lr -
 all colonial Issue.. Regardless of this motivating factor, hcwwev
 It will be politically impossible for the Iran Government to
 ref?eat on the Trieste issue in the near future.

 EASTERN EUROPE
 YUGOSLAVIA
 SateMte Trade  Despite Yugoslavians widely publicized
 economic and political break  iCo-
 inform  do S, ?ui oslavia and Hungary are attempting to
 maintain indirect trade relations trough w stern inter-
 mediaries. A Yugoslav delegation in Vienna is at  mp .n ;
 to have deliveries under the 6'suspended n Hungarian trade
 agreement resumed. Si i .r steps embracing Yugoslav
 trade with Czechoslovakia throw ? Dutch facilities may soon
 be forthcoming. Meanwhile, limited commercial reia o r.
 are reported to be continuing between Yugoslavia and Al-
 ba a. In attempting to maint-aln. trade relations, both Y uga-
 s via and the Satellites are motivated by economic self-
 interest and the Kremlin has undoubtedly given its tacit
 approval to these operations.
 GREECE
 Yugoslav Relations  Tito"s 10 July a nouncement that
 the Yugoslav-Greek ?rroeder will
 be closed apparently represents the long-awaited Yugoslav
 abandonment of the.Greek guerrilla, cause. Until recently,
 despite the reorientation of the Greek guerrillas toward
 an increasingly anti-Tito Cominform, Yugoslavia has con-
 tinkled certain forms   aid to them in. the probable hope of,
 retaining some sympathy among the guerniilas and a strong
 bgaining weapon f or use in dealing with the West. The
 USSR s recent desertion of Tito on the Austrian treaty
 issue and Yugoslavians increasing economic isolation from
 the Satellites,, however, have emphasized Tito's need for
 western support, while the 6' Jai ly .guerrilla accusation that
 the Greek dry was using Yugoslav territory provided a
 suitable pretext for a Yugoslav declaratiort. of neutrality,

 GREECE
 Even if Titons statement represents a complete break with
 the guerrillas, it will probably have little immediate effect
 on Greece. While cessation of Yugoslav aid may have some
 psychological repercussions among the guerrillas, their
 present military capabilities are unlikely to be affected
 materially. The guerrillas have been receiving almost all
 their support from Albania and Bulgaria, and the current
 Greek offensive in the Kaimaktchalan area has already
 reduced the usefulness of the one remaining guerrilla base
 dependent on Yugoslav support., Furthermore, the 11,000
 Greek children now held in Yugoslavia assure Tito of con-
 tinued bargaining power vis-a-vis the Greek Government.
 FINL&ND
 Trade Policy  The 29 June muitliateral trade pacts con-
 cluded by Finland with the USSR, Poland,
 and Czechoslovakia represent an important step toward
 linking the Finnish economy more closely with those of the
 USSR and the other Satellites. Furthermore, these pacts
 may presage further Soviet efforts to multilaterallze trade
 in Eastern Europe. Faced-with a deterioration in their com-
 petitive position in the world market as a result of inflation-
 ary production costs and a decln  in world Prices' for
 timber products, the Finns leave felt it necessary to devalue
 the fiamark as well as to sign these pacts  an attempt to
 bolster Finland's export t a.de. Finland will now be able
 both to settle its trade deficits with Poland and C echoslo-
 vakia and to continue imports of essential coal and steel
 goods from these countries without resorting to foreign
 exchange payments. Furthermore, the pacts afford an oppor.-
 tuniiy for eding exports to the Soviet Union of goods not
 marketable elsewhere. These Finnish moves, however, have
 not removed the threat of Inflationary pressure which will
 have a. severe impact upon the country's economy.  .

 PALESTINE
 Peace Deadlock  Israeli Arab efforts to reach a settlement
 in Palestine appeared no nearer solution
 this week despite some progress in Israeli-Syrian armistice
 talks and efforts to resume the Lausanne peace negotiations.
 The s-raell proposal that Egypt relinquish the -Gaza strip,
 exchange for Israeli assumption of responsibility for the
 230,000 Arab refugees presently crowded in that tract, Is
 uikkely to be put into effect. Egypt is openly hostile to the
 idea of giving up adore territory to Israel, while Israel's
 enthusiasm for the plan has undoubtedly been dampened
 the fact that the US has conditioned its, approval of the pro-
 al on Israel's granting territorial compensation to Egypt.
 Meanwhile, the recently announced Israeli program to re-
 unite broken Arab families does not reflect any real relaxa-
 tion in Israel's opposition to the return of-Arab refugees. The
 Israeli scheme calls for an elaborate screeni  system before
 any Arab refugee can join his relatives   Israel, and it is
 unlikely that many will be able to surmount the administrative
 hurdles set up.
 Kashmir Dispute   The Kashmir situation remains virtually
 unchanged, though still potentially ex-,
 plosive, as the United Nations Commission for India and
 Pakistan remains undecided regarding the advisability of
 appealing directly to India and Pakistan for the appointment
 of. a truce arbitrator.. As long as the stale ate.in negotiations
 continues, a danger exists that fighting will be resumed In
 Kashmir with open warfare between India and Pakistan almost
 certain to follow. Meanwhile, Indian propaganda is emphasizing

 the possibility of overt hostile action by Pakistan. Ap-

 pact, the proposed union would be off to a slow start.. At best,
 It would probably develop int3 a pressure group expending its
 efforts on obtaining US aid, rather than on positive achieve-
 ments based on the potential strength of the Pacific area itself.
 CHINA
 Communist Policy  With no major changes in the military
 situation during the past week, the
 fidelity  the Chinese Communists to the -Kremlin was re -
 affirmed by Communist leader Mao Tse-tung, and Nationalist
 leaders continued their bickering for control over, a steadily
 dtintega t  ' nod. Communist China. In an article apparently
 addressed to an audience of non-Indoctrinated- Chinese Com-
 munist Party members, as well as the general public, limo
 Tseatu  emphasized the firm determination of Chinese
 Communist leaders to strengthen the state organs   coercion
 and punishment and to avoid any compromising commitments
 to western nations. In admitting that 450,000, 000 Chinese
 would be livtng under a rigid police state, Mao stressed the
 allegiance of the Chinese Communist Parts to the dogmas of
 Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Mao also pointed out that
 collectivization of the Chinese peasantry would be a painful
 process but would have to be carried out in order to implement
 the Chinese Communist program. Although Mao admitted that
 China depends on foreign countries economically, he denied
 emphatically that assistance from the US and the UK would be
 necessary to the Party's success in Chi.

 proposed Pacific Union marked a Airther step toward his
 resumption of open leadership In Cht se Nationalist a afrs.
 Although ChlangDs trip was technically unofficial and without
 Act   President Li Tsang e 's permission or advance know-
 ledge, it co  tVamted a new and significant tactic in Chin's
 search for further aid. The outcome of Chia  's current
 negotiations with Li In Canton is still in dkaubt, but it is almost
 certain that's national 1nfh ence bas v ^t .lly terminated.

 little effect on the future course of Nationalist resistance
 efforts. Chiang and his right-Wing clique will effectively
 dictate Nationalist policy, at least in Southeast Chi and
 Taiwan.
 Reaction to Bao Dai  The continued failure of  Emperor- Bao

 achieving a satisfactory .solution to the Vietnamese problem
 by means of the March A fol.  ao ai agreement. Ba Dat's
 Cabinet has been received?without enthuslasm in South-Vietnam
 and with isappointment in North Vietnam. Despite the fear
 of some French officials that the Cabinet contain too many
 anti.F ranch "ul anatio  lists," most 'd i v  noes feel that
 the majori  o: the newly appointed Cabinet officers do not
 possess sufficient prestige and  Dili y to attract non-

 KOREA
 Border Clashes  A rise in major border incidents in Korea
 is Increasingly likely as a result of the
 reported movement of North Korean army unite .into positions
 closer to the 38th parallel. As a result of these movemenos,
 which represent a further consolidation of the army's adminis
 trative and tactical control of the border area, army troops
 will probably soon join border constabulary forces in skirmishes
 with South Korean troops. It is unlikely, however, that these
 clashes will develop into full-scale warfare in the near future.

 THE WEST GERMAN ELECTIONS
 The most probable result of the 14 August elections in
 the western zones of Germany will be the establishment of a
 coalition government comprising the Social Democratic Party
 (SPD), the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),* and very possi-
 bly, the Free Democratic Party (FDP)v These parties will be
 favored in the elections by their superior organization and
 newspaper support, better-known candidates, considerable past
 experience in governing, and the provisions of the federal elee
 tomb law. Consequently the CDU and SPD together are like ,y
 to obtain at least 60% of the popular vote ? their representa
 tion in the Diet will probably be higher, however, since 60%
 of the Diet seats are allotted to candidates elected in Individual
 constituencies by simple majority vote. ha most instances,
 such candidates will be those of the larger parties.
 The rightist and nationalist minor?ity parties, moreover,
 will to handicapped by the electoral law requiring them to
 receive 5% of the vote in any Land, or a majority in one con-
 stitu envy, in order to obtain seats in the Diet. The minority
 parties will, however, profit from the present rightist trend
 and ? he considerable antagonism toward the large parties,
 which are associated with the occupation awl postwar difficul-
 ties. The Communists are expected to retain approximately
 their former strength of 5-8% of the votes east-
 The chief obstacles to the formation of a CDU-SP
 coalition will be the fundamental differences between the two
 parties on economic and social programs and the reluctance

 of the SPD to assume governmental responsibility without a
 clear majority in the government. Confronted with the
 question of entering a coalition, the SPD decision will prob-
 ably depend on its ability to get sufficient cabinet posts to
 allow at least partial realization of its program as well as
 its willingness to subordinate partisan political considera-
 tions to the creation of a stable German government. Even
 greater obstacles would have to be overcome in the formation
 and operation of a government without SPD participation. The
 CDU waaild be forced to obtain the support of the Free Demo-
 cratic Party, the Center Party, and certain small rightist
 groups in order to establish a multi-party coalition.
 The formation of a two-party CDU -SPD coalition
 would be more favorable to US interests than a multi-party
 coalition. The two parties would control a safe majority in
 the Federal Diet, thus assuring a more. effective and stable
 government. Such a government would also be more progres-
 sive and would firmly oppose the Communists. It the SPD
 should refuse to participate in such a government, the al-
 ternative coalition would encounter stronger public and
 parliamentary opposition and would be more. willing to seek
 Soviet support for maneuvers aimed at establishing a unified
 Germany.

 ITALIAN COLONOM QUESTION
 Further postponement   the dtsposition of I a.iy' s
 former colony of Libya may well be the only action on. thL
 Issue which the various nations can agree upon during, tlzaa
 September session of the. UN  neral Assembly. The
 establishment of a united and independent Libya., though
 probably not in itself disagreeable to the UK, would be
 strongly opposed by France and probably by pro-L .l.ian
 members of the UN, and no other compromise seems likely
 to attract the necessary two-thirds majorffy support.
 Although the Libyan unification movement has t  c-
 porrarily lost momentum, it  unli1ely that the local pop-
 ulation, encouraged by the recent UK grant of se -rule to
 Cyrenaica and projected Tripolit nnlan concessions, would
 be satisfied with much less than independence. The Italian
 Government, aware of the obstacles to Italian trusteeship
 .and also of the possibility of an uprising a .innst Italian,

 would allow it to relinquish clain to Tripoit An .. The

 Altahough the British are stilD. reluctant to acquire the eco-

 maintain the status quc *nntl independence can be granted
