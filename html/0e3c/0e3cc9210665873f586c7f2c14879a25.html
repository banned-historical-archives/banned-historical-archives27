? PEKING'S SUPPORT OF INSURGENCIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
? 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
This study establishes the facts and examines 
the purposes of China's support of insurgencies in 
Southeast Asia. 
It is a fact that, despite China's overall 
policy of friendly relations, and despite the passage 
of some four years since the general ending of 
Cultural Revolution militancy, China continues to 
sponsor and support insurgencies against certain  
governments in Southeast Asia./ 
These remote insurgencies are not likely to threaten 
the Rangoon or Bangkok governments, but the fact 
remains that China's covert sponsorship of these 
insurrections is clearly impeding China's diplomatic 
attempts to elicit further responsiveness from these 
same governments. 
This study i-Y:amines various possible purposes 
behind this self-defeating course -- "two faced," as 
the Burmese call it. Is the Chinese purpose essentially

that of attempting to exert added pressure on certain 
of China's small neighbors? Or a concern not to be 
up-staged by any new Soviet presence in Southeast Asia 
and in the support of revolutionary movements? Or 
an unwillingness or inability to cease supporting 
insurgencies once begun? Or bureaucratic disarray 
in the conduct of Chinese foreign relations? Or, a 
reflection of Maoist impulses? The study concludes 
that it is the latter of these purposes which carries 
the greatest force: China supports certain insurgencies 
in Southeast Asia largely because that's the way the 
boss, Mao Tse-tung, wants it -- for his own mix of 
stubbornly-held ideological and personal reasons. 
This study has received constructive assistance 
from a number of CIA offices. The study's interpretations 
are those of its author and of this 
Staff.

PEKING'S SUPPORT OF INSURGENCIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
Summary  
Peking has a two-level foreign policy with 
respect to certain governments in Southeast Asia: 
ostensibly friendly diplomacy on one level; and 
insurgency-support on another -- most notably in 
Burma and Thailand, to a lesser extent in Malaysia 
and the Philippines. The explanation for this 
anomaly is to be found mainly in the ideological 
and personal predilections of Mao Tse-tung, who 
still has such authority in the PRC that he can and 
does require the continuation of one policy, 
insurgency-support, which impedes Chinese progress 
in its overall diplomatic efforts. 
The policy of insurgency-support does not 
seem to be essentially a device for exerting pressure 
on nearby governments, the stick of a rationally-
conceived carrot-and-stick approach. Burma, for 
example, gives the Chinese leaders no cause for 
applying pressure: it is non-aligned, it has paid 
reparations to Peking for the damages of the mid-
1967 anti-Chinese riots, and it has exchanged 
ambassadors with the PRC. Nonetheless, China is 
not only supporting but sponsoring the northeast 
insurgency, and the results are now detrimental to 
Peking's diplomatic interests -- so much so that 
Prime Minister Ne Win is being forced out of his 
quiet isolationist policy into an active search for 
a common front against Peking, including a possible 
detente with Thailand. For its part, Thailand does 
give the Chinese leaders cause for applying pressure 
in order to eliminate the US military presence there,

Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2010/07/29: CIA-RDP85T00875R001000010052-9 
but Peking has not indicated that insurgency-support 
would end if that cause were to be removed: the 
Chinese-run operational radio, Voice of the People 
of Thailand, broadcasting from south China, continues 
to attack the US military presence in Thailand but 
has never suggested that the insurgents might settle 
with Bangkok if that presence were removed. 
Nor does insurgency-support seem intended 
to prevent the Soviets from filling the "vacuum" 
left by US withdrawals from the area. Nearby 
countries have their own inclinations and reasons 
for avoiding a request for a Soviet presence. 
Ironically, if anything might work to frighten nearby 
countries, providing for them a reason to turn to 
the Soviets for concrete military aid, it would be 
the heightening of Chinese insurgency-support. 
Similarly, the Chinese do not appear to be 
supporting these insurgencies in order to demonstrate 
to radicals, world-wide, that they are more revolu-
tionary than the Soviets. The evidence is that the 
Chinese have shown no particular concern with their 
image among radicals in recent years: for example, 
China disparaged the revolutionary actions of rebels 
in Ceylon and Bangladesh in 1971; and the Chinese 
opened themselves to charges within the world Communist 
movement of "opportunistic betrayal" in July 1971 when 
they quickly moved to strengthen relations with the 
new government in the Sudan, which had arrested 
large numbers of Communists. 
Neither does insurgency-support seem to have 
been continued (and even somewhat increased in the 
cases of Burma and Thailand) because of momentum, 
or "bureaucratic lag." Mao surely has the authority 
to end insurgency-support if he so desired. He 
demonstrated his ability to turn policy around com-
pletely with respect to relations with the US. He

also changed from encouraging Hanoi to "protract" its 
effort against South Vietnam to accepting the cease-
fire arrangements. It would be far less difficult 
for him to knock off covert support of small-scale 
insurrection in nearby countries. 
Chou En-lai has apparently had to comply with 
Mao's wishes in this respect. He has explicitly 
endorsed continuation of insurgency-support. So far 
as can be observed and judged, Chou has never, since 
Mao came to dominate the Chinese leadership in 1935, 
opposed Mao's will, once Mao had made clear what 
policy he wanted carried out. Chou's survival sug-
gests not that he is more subtle in thwarting Mao's 
preferences than other Chinese leaders purged in 
recent years, but that he has never tried to deceive 
Mao. His style of work seems to have been, and still 
to be, that of using persuasion at a time when Mao 
is open to persuasion. Chou apparently has been 
permitted by Mao to subordinate revolution-support 
to PRC diplomatic needs in several cases outside 
Southeast Asia, Ethiopia and Zaire being notable 
examples. But he has apparently had to comply with 
Mao's abiding view on support for the nearby in-
surgencies.

In Malaysia, Peking's support of the 1,800 
insurgents does not include direct inputs of personnel 
or weapons, for obvious logistical reasons. This 
handicap is also operative in Peking's support of 
the 1,000 Maoist insurgents in the Philippines. The 
Communist leadership of both these insurgencies is 
loyal to Peking on an entire range of issues and 
is pledged to fight a long, Mao-model war against 
the government. The Chinese-run operational radio, 
Voice of the Malayan Revolution, broadcasts regularly 
from south China to insurgents in Malaysia, calling 
for an expansion of their armed struggle. There 
is no sign that these broadcasts will be discontinued 
in the near future. 
 /Southeast Asian leaders believe the single most 
important obstacle to establishing diplomatic re]a-
tions with Peking is this insurgency-support. Peking's 
policy strengthens the argument against establishing 
relations by those men within the respective country 
leaderships who desire a go-slow approach; it weakens 
the argument of those who advocate early recognition. 
Undoubtedly, Chou En-lai is fully informed of this 
impediment to new diplomatic successes, and sees 
the irrationality of it. 
The main reason for the continuation of Peking's 
self-defeating policy to support insurgencies nearby 
seems clearly to be Mao's ideological and personal 
desire to prove that Mao-model armed struggles can 
be born and survive. On a deeper, perhaps even 
unconscious, level he may want to prove this to 
himself -- as well as to the scoffing Soviets, who 
have disputed this point with him for over a decade. 
Mao still insists that armed struggle is the only  
dogma 
in 
to national power for Communists. This  
in Mao's thinking apparently is not as firmly rooted

leader is dead certain of the old leader's obsessions

PEKING'S SUPPORT OF INSURGENCIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
IDEOLOGY: THE UNSHAKEN FOUNDATION 
Since Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in 1967, 
and earlier in the case of Thailand, Peking has been 
playing a major role in stimulating the revival of 
floundering insurgencies in several Southeast Asian 
countries. The armed insurgencies in Burma, Thailand, 
Malaysia, and the Philippines virtually had collapsed 
in the 1950's and in effect, had been abandoned by 
Peking for purposes of diplomacy. This policy of dis-
engagement was reversed in the case of Thailand in 
1965, and in the cases of Burma, Malaysia, and the 
Philippines in 1967. The new policy of political 
stimulation and various kinds of material support 
stems basically from the ideological and personal in-
clinations Of Mao which had been touched off by a punish-
ment motive but which are not now sustained by that 
motive. 
The Source of Insurgency Revival  
The thrust -- that is, the initial propulsion --
for revival of the insurgencies came from Peking rather 
than from the guerrillas who were hiding in the jungles.

The policy of deliberate stimulation. included an 
entire range of methods of practical support. One of 
the material inputs which required a Chinese leader-
ship decision was the diplomatically sensitive one of 
supplying Chinese-made weapons. Prior to the Cultural 
Revolution, it had been Chinese practice to avoid 
such a policy of supply, inasmuch as captured Chinese-
made weapons would be concrete evidence of PRC inter-
ference in revolution beyond its borders. But in 1967, 
Mao apparently decided to chan e this cautious and 
prudent policy 
Evidence later revealed (for the first time in 1969), 
that the Thai insurgents were being supplied with 
clearly identified Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifles. 
The insurgents in Burma were also shown to have been 
receiving easily identifiable Chinese-made weapons.

practicing from caches in Laos, is indicated by the 
statement of Politburo member Kang Sheng.  
The shift from a policy of disengagement to one 
of deliberate stimulation and support was accompanied 
by Chinese insistence to the insurgents that the guer-
rilla war must be well-organized in order to make posi-
tive gains. At an early date, the Chinese began to 
show their pleasure with the new and serious way the 
insurgents were prosecuting the small war. For example, 
speaking to an "activist congress" in Shanghai on 4 
April 1968, Politburo member Chang Chun-chiao said that 
"In Burma, guerrilla warfare has made faster progress 
in one year than in the past 20 years." The three 
clandestine radio stations beaming broadcasts into 
the nearby insurgencies from China for several years 
have noted the improvement in organization, commitment, 
and fighting tactics of the insurgents Peking supports. 
The contrast with the poor showing of the 1950's is 
striking.

The Incongruous Mix in Southeast Asia  
Peking's foreign policy toward Southeast Asia 
is strikingly marked by a dual approach. The People's 
Republic of China (PRC) is .simultaneously trying to 
improve relations with countries in the area while the 
CCP is supporting insurrections -- and helping to expand 
them -- within these countries. Both policies are 
going forward at the same time. Diplomacy toward Burma, 
Thailand, Malaysia (including North Borneo), and the 
Philippines is not displacing insurgency-support. In-
surgency-support is not displacing diplomacy. By con-
trast, policy toward Africa (other than PRC support 
of insurgencies against colonial or white governments) 
and Latin America reveals a clear-cut displacement of 
insurgency-support by diplomacy. In the Middle East, 
PRC support of Arab insurgency against Israel primarily 
aids national self-interest rather than revolutionary 
interest. Only in Southeast Asia is the PRC policy 
equally and inharmoniously mixed.

This is further evidence that PRC diplomacy must 
work within revolutionary limits. PRC Foreign Ministry 
officials (and Chou En-lai) have a warrant to "adopt 
a flexible attitude" to improve government-to-govern-
ment relations "even if a country previously adopted a 
policy hostile to China" (as a joint editorial of 
1 October 1972 put it), But they have no warrant, even 
in private talks, to promise an end to insurgency-
support in Southeast Asia. 
Chou, and Foreign Ministry officials working for 
him, apparently are operating under an overall guide-
line of Mao's. This guideline requires that they main-
tain for Southeast Asia a two-level policy, clearly 
duplistic in the view of leaders in nearby countries,

and duplistic in the Chinese leaders' own perception 
of it. There is evidence that the two-level policy 
is a deliberate and planned course of action, rather 
than a dying remnant of a policy Mao retains reluct-
antly. In capsule form, the policy requires that Chou 
work for improved relations with Burma, Thailand, 
Malaysia, and the Philippines but not at the expense 
of ceasing support of the insurgencies in these four 
countries.

Radio Peking and the Clandestine Radios  
The Chinese seem to recognize that their image 
with the Western powers and Japan requires a concealment 
of the extent of PRC support of insurgency. This fact 
is reflected most clearly in Chou's well-documented 
actions to differentiate government from party support, 
and open from covert support. 
Radio Peking, which beams broadcasts to a wide 
range of international audiences, has reduced its 
coverage of nearby insurgency developments. This has 
taken place, step-by-step, since the fall of 1970 in 
the case of Burma, and since mid-1971 in the cases of 
Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Recourse to 
a similar low-profile, or disengagement from open sup-
port, has been the policy also with the PRC central 
press. Radio Peking and the central press now only 
rarely initiate a commentary on the nearby insurgencies. 
The practice has become one of rebroadcasting or

reprinting either an item from one of the clandestine 
radios in south China or from foreign news sources. 
The three clandestine radios, broadcasting from 
complexes in China -- two from Yunnan and one from 
Hunan -- continuu to beam native language programs 
regularly to the insurgents in Burma, Thailand, and 
Malaysia. Programs detailing aspects of the insurgency 
in the Philippines are carried by the radio handling 
Malaysian guerrilla developments. The broadcaEts range 
in content from guidance and indoctrination prc grams 
to highly abusive attacks on the leaders of nearby 
governments in the area. The attacks are more abusive 
than those Radio Peking had carried, except for a period 
in 1967 at the peak of Mao's Cultural Revolution. They 
are a source of concern to leaders of nearby govern- . 
ments, and they are one ot the concrete Chinese practices 
which has slowed down the progress of PRC diplomacy in 
the area. 
Aside from the emphasis in the broadcasts on how 
to make the insurgencies work, the radio programs are 
conceived on the assumption that the men in the field 
are under a strong study discipline. On occasion, the 
assumption seems to be that they are under roughly the 
same study discipline as CCP mainland cadres. For 
example, in May 1972, the text of one of Mao's essays 
was broadcast to insurgent cadres in Malaysia by the 
broadcasts of the clandestine Voice of the Malayan 
Revolution (VMR). On other occasions, the complete 
text of PRC statements are broadcast, obviously for 
study and memorization. 
There is considerable evidence that Chou En-lai 
is the most important official implementing the trans-
parent device of separating state-to-state from party-
to-party relations. Chou's personal activities began 
in the spring of 1971, included the visit of Ne Win in 
August 1971, and appeared openly as a basic policy in 
October 1971, when Peking started to'lhold separate

National Day receptions for foreign diplomats and 
foreign Communists. 
The number of greeting messages, connected with 
various Chinese anniversary dates and attributed to 
Communist parties engaged in the nearby insurgencies, 
has been reduced in Radio Peking and central press 
coverage. These messages are handled by the clandestine 
radios assigned to each insurgency. Messages of greet-
ings from one Communist Party to another are also 
assigned to the clandestine radios, a recent example 
being the message from the Burmese Communists to the 
Thai Communists on 30 November 1972, commending the Thais 
for fighting against the "traitorous Thanom-Praphat 
clique" and for "following the teaching of great Chair-
man Mao Tse-tung that political power grows out of the 
barrel of a gun." The broadcast stated that the Burmese 
Communists are following the same Mao-model policy. 
The Retreat from Ideological Rigidity Elsewhere  
Beyond Southeast Asia, Chinese spokesmen have 
a less restricted scope which permits them in private 
talks to promise to cease supporting uprisings within 
other countries. They are able effectively to avoid 
risking damage to PRC diplomacy; they need not accept 
a slowdown in its advance by rigidly supporting insur-
rections or sudden coups.

In the Middle East, Chinese diplomacy requires 
PRC support of a certain guerrilla war -- that is, the 
one Arab fedayeen are trying to wage against Israel. 
The Arab guerrillas are not ideological allies. They 
are not Communists, and they are not likely to establish 
a Communist regime, or a viable base area, or even a 
Communist Party organization. The ideological element 
here is dominated by the practical one of PRC diplomacy 
toward Arab governments, even though in this case Peking 
is openly supporting "armed struggle." 
Latin America  
In Latin America also diplomacy has taken command, 
The main thrust of policy is to avoid revolutionary 
statements and to stress government-to-government rela-

about which they know a great deal.) This policy of 
disengagement was more fully elaborated on 25 August 
1971 by Keng Piao, Director of the International Liaison 
Department, CCP. Keng told   
 /that China would support only "organized" 
pro.Peking Communist parties, presumably only those 
which were unfractured and amenable to CCP guidance. 
Keng said that China would not become involved with 
adventurous movements like the Tupamaros in Uruguay, 
the rebel armed forces in Guatemala, and (obviously)  
"Che" Guevara's men,  
Chou En-lai was to put the policy into practice. 
Following Peru's recognition of the PRC (2 November 
1971), the Chinese desired a further improvement 
of government-to-government relations. When, therefore, 
a visiting cabinet minister of Peru asked Chou, in mid-
January 1972, why pro-Peking parties in Peru were al-
lowed to continue to attack the Lima government as a 
"fascist regime" when, supposedly, good relations existed 
between the two governments, Chou reacted against the 
revolutionaries. He angrily condemned the action 
of these groups. He said that no party in Peru had 
ever received official authorization to include "China" 
in its party name or to assume that it represented the 
Chinese people or the CCP, By contrast, in Southeast 
Asia, the China-based clandestine radios continue to 
disparage certain nearby governments as "fascist regimes."

The Durability of Ideology: "Armed Struggle" 
In Latin American policy, there is at least 
one exception of considerable significance. That is, 
there is an instance in which an ideological concept 
was defended -- openly and deliberately -- in a way 
not conducive to PRC diplomatic progress. It was 
defended by the man with the most diplomatic sense 
in the Chinese leadership: Chou En-lai. The instance 
is yet another confirmation that certain elements 
indestructable core elements -- still exist in 
Mao's thinking. In this case, the core element was 
Mao's view that the only way to permanent national 
power for revolutionaries is by way of "armed struggle." 
In early September 1971, one year after Allende's 
electoral victory in Chile, in an interview with a 
Mexican editor in Peking, Chou was asked about the 
CCP's position that national power must be seized only 
by "armed force." He was asked how he viewed the parlia-
mentary road -- the path of elections Allende had 
taken. Chou's response was along rigid ideological 
lines. He chose not to be diplomatic; that is, he 
did not equivocate and did not avoid disparaging 
Allende's election route to power. He chose a criti-
cal tack despite the fact that Allende's government 
had shown goodwill: it had cut ties with Taipei and 
granted formal recognition to Peking on 5 January 
1971. This action had provided Peking with an import-
ant breakthrough in government relations in Latin 
America. 
Chou proceeded to give an analysis for world-
wide publication which was similar to that of doc-
trinal extremists in Chile and not flattering to

Allende. Disregarding the fact that Allende had at-
tained decisive political support before the assassina-
tion of General Schneider, Chou insisted that "what 
most helped Salvador Allende, the truly decisive factor, 
was a counter-revolutionary bullet, an assassain's 
bullet, which killed General Schneider..0 therefore, 
the majority vote went to Allende," Chou made the 
point explicitly that: 
We do not believe in struggle by 
the parliamentary method. 
He described Allende's victory in unflattering terms 
as a "transitory phenomenon" which could be lost, 
and Allende as having won the "government but not the 
power" because he did not control the army, which 
later could be used against him. Pro-Soviet Communists 
in Chile immediately attacked, Chou for this example 
of ideological gaucherie, and Allende himself undoubt-
edly was angered by it. 
This exceptional behavior is a case of ideology 
taking precedence over diplomatic tact. The fact that 
Mao holds tenaciously to certain ideological positions 
because of doctrinal and personal predilection -- and 
holds them ever more tenaciously because the Soviets 
continue to oppose them -- is the fundamental reason 
why doctrine displaced diplomatic prudence in the case 
of Allende's victory. 
Allende's victory had been protrayed by various 
Communists in the international movement as a valid 
demonstration that Mao was wrong about "armed struggle" 
being the only road to national power. Peking's defense 
of Mao's ideological position had been set forth at

great length, with great heat, and with great publicity 
in the joint editorial in Peking's central press on 
17 March 1971. 
Comrade Mao Tse-tung...points out: 
'According to the Marxist theory of 
the state, the army is the chief com-
ponent of state power. Whoever wants 
to seize and retain state power must 
have a strong army. ' 
Violent revolution is the universal 
principle of proletarian revolution... 
and there is no exception... 
In the past decades, many Communist 
parties have participated in elections 
and parliaments, but none has set up 
a dictatorship of the proletariat by 
such means. Even if a Communist party  
should win a ma.ority in parliament  
or parttctpate 1,n the government, this 
would not mean any change in the char-
acter of bourgeois political power, 
still less in the smashing of the old 
state machine... 
The proletariat must use the gun to 
seize political power and must use  
the gun to defend it... (emphasis 
supplied)

had been supporting a more radical group of Chilean 
Communists against the pro-Moscow local Communists. 
In July 1970, Politburo member Kang Sheng had made 
a special point of praising the pro-Chinese Revolu-
tionary Communist Party of Chile precisely because 
it held the line of taking power only through "armed 
struggle," as opposed to the "revisionist line of the 
Soviet clique." Allende's popular-vote victory was 
a direct refutation of Mao's dogmatic view. But in 
early September 1971, Chou had to comply with Mao's ? 
ideological position, and he had to do so publicly. 
In trying to demonstrate that somehow "armed struggle" 
had aided Allende -- "an assassain's bullet" -- and 
that Allende might not be able to consolidate his 
victory because he did not control the army, Chou 
was being abrasive, making statements contrary to 
what would have benefited PRC national interests in 
Santiago. 
The ideological view that national power must 
be seized along the road of "armed struggle" rather 
than along the parliamentary road cuts across the 
grain of a foreign policy of flexibility. It could 
impede progress in diplomacy toward democracies which 
already have recognized the PRC as China's only legal 
government, or which are being encouraged to grant 
such recognition. There is some evidence that Chou 
is aware of this and may want to dilute the doctrine 
in certain cases. He may be seeking Mao's permission 
to be more selective about defending the "armed strug-
gle" concept outside of the insurgencies in Southeast 
Asia which the PRC supports.

in the central press. All three clandestine radios 
continue to beam this fixed position into Burma, Thai-

Peking helps to inspire, in the Philippines, comprise 
the clearest example, in Mao's apparent view, that 
he is right and the Soviet leaders are wrong in the

elections, are the best way to seize national power. 
The Chinese are telling their client insurgents in 
the field that even Stalin had denounced the parlia-
mentary road. The Chinese-operated VMR, between 20 
and 26 September 1972, beamed broadcasts into Malaysia 
containing the first half of Stalin's work, Foundations  
of Leninism, in which Stalin criticized the partie?- of 
the Second International for being subservient to 
the parliamentary road. This is the ideological 
position with which cadres in the insurgencies must 
comply. 
This is Mao's ideological core position, with 
which Chou must comply. Thus far, it seems to be 
impervious to change despite the shift to flexibility 
in foreign policy. The end of the war in Vietnam, 
therefore, will probably not lead to an end of Chinese 
insurgency-suppol.t. It probably will continue at 
least until Mao dies. 
It is the basic assumption of this paper that 
Mao dominates the Chinese leaders in making major 
policy decisions. He dominates, for example, his 
wife and Chou. So far as can be observed and judged, 
Chou has never, since Mao came to dominate the Chinese

leadership in 1935, opposed Mao's will, once Mao had 
made it clear what he wanted carried out in policy. 
Chou's survival suggests not that he is more subtle 
in thwarting Mao's preferences than other Chinese 
leaders (who are now political corpses), but that 
he has never tried to deceive Mao. His style of work 
seems to have been, and still to be, that of using 
persuasion at a time when Mao is open to persuasion. 
The 1969 firefights on the Sino-Soviet border and 
Soviet verbal threats provided Chou with a great op-
portunity to persuade Mao convincingly of the benefits 
(and need) of a foreign policy of flexible maneuver. 
Chou's conjectured persuasion of Mao includ?d an effort 
to make Mao see the wisdom of restricting Chinese sup-
port of insurgencies  outside Southeast Asia (with  
certain exceptions). 
Chou has been permitted by Mao to have his way 
in subordinating revolution-support to PRC diplomatic 
needs in several cases outside Southeast Asia. He 
and other Chinese officials have criticized "Che" 
Guevara, the Tupamaros, pro-Peking Communists in Peru, 
and the Ceylonese short-term insurgents. Chou, on 
the evidence, seems to have had a lower opinion of 
foreign insurgents as worthwhile clients, than Mao, 
has had. This difference in appraisal almost certainly 
exists today, especially regarding some nearby states. 
While Mao now permits Chou to end insurgency-
support elsewhere, his abiding view apparently is to 
sustain support for those which are gradually expanding 
in Burma, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Chou 
clearly must comply with this abiding view.

Within the framework of interpretation which 
? sees Maoist ideology -- Mao's persoaal "thought" --
as the main reason for sustained insurgency-support, 
? this support is being provided in a sensible way. 
? The Chinese are making small inputs gradually, rather 
than big inputs at priority speed, into the insurgencies 
in Burma and Thailand. The ideologically-motivated 
? policy is being carried out only in certain countries 
where it is feasible for the Chinese to guide it. 
The capability to guide and influence -- this is the 
first reqUirement for Chinese support. Provided that 
such a capability is at hand, certain other criteria 
determine the Chinese policy. First, the Chinese 
must control the insurgency directly with their own 
cadres, or through pro-Chinese cadres in the insurgent 
ranks. Second, proximity to the borders of China 
determines, to some degree, the capability the Chinese 
have in guiding an insurgency. Third, the insurgency 
must be viable to begin with, or open to a Chinese 
role in making it viable. The insurgency must be 
amenable to Chinese guidance on organizational work, 
ideological commitment, and military integrity. 
Mao apparently does not seem deterred from 
sponsoring or supporting these insurgencies in South-
east Asia by the probability that they will not spread 
from the periphery to the vital center of the countries 
where they are developing. It seems to be more import-
ant at present to him that they exist than that they 
are made to expand rapidly and extensively. Mao appar-
ently believes that withdrawing Peking's support (and 
thereby risking the collapse of some of them) would 
give the Soviet leaders a big ideological victory 
in the dispute over "armed struggle." The anti-
. Soviet animus in his thinking may buttress his own 
ideological predilection to sustain insurgency-support.

The importance of the ideological motivation, 
the persistence of dogma in Mao's thinking, seems to 
be far greater than in Chou's thinking. Moreover, 
Chou has no pretensions to doctrinal creativity. As 
with Stalin, it will probably prove to be the case 
that only after the dominant leader is dead that cer-
tain detrimental obsessions with ideology will be 
exposed for what they are, irrational concepts impeding 
policy, and will then be marked for discard.

PEKING'S PRIMARY ROLE IN THE INSURGENCIES 
Burma 
China is the main propelling force in the 
expanding insurgency in Burma's northeast.1 
The need to send across the border such an 
impressive array of PLA personnel is a measure of 
how badly the Communist insurgency had floundered 
prior to 1967 when operating on its own, and of 
how badly it might deteriorate if Pekirg were to 
withdraw its thoroughgoing sponsorship.

The insurgency is not controlled by local

-- the BCP (White Flag), led by Chairman Thakin Zin. 
He is operating farther south, in the Pegu Yoma

 r Theoretically, Chairman Thakin 
Zin is responsible for making policy decisions, and 
as recent as 20 August 1972, the PRC-run clandestine 
radio station beamed his "instructions? to Burma in-
surgents. In practice, however, he and his group of 
followers defer to the instructions from the Northeast 
Command on all key issues. 
Compared to the small gains in territory made 
by the end of 1969, the land the insurgents now hold 
in the northeast shows a course of expansion rather 
than contraction. China's input also is growing. 
Everything the Chinese diplomats have done on the 
level of government-to-government relations with Rangoon 
and Ne Win has not changed the fact that Peking covertly 
is sponsoring this expansion by continuing to train 
tribal insurgents in China and by sending in men, 
weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies. 
As a result of the Chinese input of special 
PLA personnel, and also because of intensive organiza-
tional work conducted among the tribal peoples, the 
insurgency in the northeast is now the most effective 
one that Rangoon has ever had to grapple with. The 
professional political and organizational work of 
the Chinese which raises the level of discipline and 
competence has also been urged upon insurgent forces 
in Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines by Peking. 
As a result, these forces are no longer ineffectual 
roving bands of "only-military" (Guevaraist-type) 
guerrillas, as they had been prior to 1967. All this 
points beyond mere rhetoric, mere token support, 
and mere gesture to a serious, professional policy 
intended, on the practical level, to make certain 
insurgencies in Southeast Asia take hold ant gradually 
expand along the road of "protracted war."

The Byrma case shows more clearly than any 
other case the existence of a motivation in addition 
to, or more important and durable than, the more 
rational one of punishment. In the summer of 1967, 
Mao acted to punish Ne Win for the anti-Chinese riots 
in Rangoon, and the method he used was to revive the 
insurgency in the northeast. But Ne Win has agreed 
to reparations and the grudge Mao has held against him 
may no longer be the major motivation which sustains 
Peking's insurgency-support, 
Another motivation of Mao's existed side-by-
side with the punishment (or revenge-for-riots) 
motivation. This was his revolutionary compulsion which 
dominated his foreign policy thinking in 1966 and 
1967. It is neither anti-Ne Win nor anti-U.S. It 
is an independent ideological element in Mao's political 
thinking. The anti-Chinese riots, in retrospect, 
appear to have been a triggering mechanism for direct-
ing PRC hostility toward Burna. But in 1973, revenge 
for the riots probably is not the major motivation 
for sustaining insurgency support. 
In short, there are two reasons for sustaining 
the small war today; namely, Mao's nursing of a grudge 
-- in 1973 probably secondary -- and Mao's revolutionary 
urge to make a Mao-model insurgency work.. Neither 
one makes good sense from the viewpoint of Peking's 
national interests, especially as the main thrust of 
those interests is to maneuver internationally around 
the USSR's foreign policy. This requires flexibility 
toward Burma as well as other states in the area. 
Several alternative explanations of PRC motiva-
tion appear weak. PRC sponsorship of. the Burma insurg-
ency in the northeast does not help Hanoi in its war 
effort in the region. Furthermore, it leaves the new 
flexible diplomacy carried out by Chou En-lai open

to the risk that the Soviets might be welcomed in to 
supply military items by a frustrated Ne Win (or his 
successor), forced to turn away from China. Yet there 
is good evidence that Chinese diplomacy is partly 
directed toward keeping Soviet influence out of the 
area. Finally, he may seek a common front with Thailand. 
Explaining the insurgency as a pressuring tool 
is also difficult. Territory in the mountainous tribal 
area of Burma's northeast does not now provide Peking 
with leverage to exert real pressure at the leadership 
level in Rangoon. Ne Win's foreign policy has not 
been moved by such pressure to be more anti-U.S., or 
to be any more "neutral" than it has been. Holding 
and expanding territory still is a long way from moving 
the tribal-based insurrection in the northeast mountains 
into the lowlands where the Burma people live. And 
in the lowlands, it would be more effectively resisted. 
It would provide the Burmese leaders with an easy-to-
publicize international issue of a national threat 
-- an issue which would be injurious to Peking's foreign 
policy posture as a government which does not inter-
fere in other governments' internal affairs. 
Chinese diplomacy is not supplemented by it. 
Insurgency-support is not the stick of a carrot-and-
stick policy, cleverly directed toward driving Rangoon 
to adopt PRC foreign policy preferences. On the con-
trary, the hard evidence is that PRC diplomacy is 
impeded by insurgency-support. 
As flexible diplomacy gathered momentum, in 
mid-i/0, NCNA articles (i.e., media commentaries 
which could be easily attributed to Peking as the 
source) were reduced in numbers and made less anti-
Rangoon. But a clandestine radio station (broadcast-
ing media commentaries which could not be as easily 
attributed to Peking as the source) was established 
(March 1971). Chou En-lai and Foreign Ministry

officials have had to take a duplistic line -- that 
is, denying insurgency-support in such a way as to 
leave their listeners with a strong sense of Chinese 
insincerity, and with no pledge of an end to PRC sup-
port. 
The existence of this incongruity seems to 
reflect Mao's desires, with which Chou must comply. 
Since the mid-1950's, Chinese Communist policy 
toward the Burma insurgency had been to give advice 
but not material support to the old Burma Communist 
Party. In the mid-1950's also, Peking was careful 
not to give overt propaganda support to these Com-
munist dissidents, Behind-the-scenes, the Chinese 
leaders had encouraged the BCP to come in from the 
countryside to negotiate with the government for a 
ceasefire; but they had not gone so far as to require 
the BCP to meet Rangoon's key demand that it turn 
in its weapons. 
This non-support situation changed during Mao's 
Cultural Revolution. The triggering incident was 
the anti-Chinese riots in Rangoon of June 1967. In 
these riots, 50-80 local Chinese and one PRC aid-
technician were killed, A motivation for punishment 
and a motivation for revolution were aroused in Mao's 
thinking. On 29 June 1967, Peking for the first time 
praised the "armed struggle" waged against the govern-
ment. By early July, Peking was calling for the 
government's "overthrow." At the same time (July 
1967) speaking in a revolutionary way, a Burmese Com-
munist client resident in Peking denounced Liu Shao-chi 
for having "betrayed" the revolution in Burma -- the 
implication being that it would not be abandoned again. 
Evidence that the Chinese had opted for a policy 
of material inputs (beyond intensified propaganda

ant.i.m.ce 
support) appeared soon afterward. In late July 1967, 
Chinese military officers contacted Kachin and Shan 
insurgents in the northeast to begin military planning. 
Starting in August, the Chinese began their important 
organizational efforts, designed to strengthen the 
influence of Peking and the newer BCP (White Flag) 
among the tribal Kachins and Shans. This political 
work was also necessary to regularize the activities 
of the insurgents, to add discipline to their fighting 
fervor, and to make clear an ultimate political goal. 
Thereafter, Chinese training and supply of the tribal 
insurgents in the northeast expanded. Peking supplied 
decisive guidance to make the new insurgency viable 
in the border region. The insurgency became a Chinese-
sponsored guerrilla war of mainly Kachins and Shans 
against government troops, inasmuch as Peking had 
abandoned the old BCP which got nowhere in its opera-
tions in central Burma and which had aiipointed a new 
party chairman, Thakin Zin, not of Peking's choosing. 
A major step was taken when the Chinese went 
beyond using only Burma-side nationals: they began 
to recruit PRC citizens (mainly tribal minorities with 
some Han Chinese) on the Yunnan-side for fighting 
in northeast Burma. By March 1968 such Yunnan-side 
recruitment was well underway. Rather than wait 
until Burma-side tribal minorities could be mustered 
into combat units, the Chinese, who showed every sign 
of being anxious to put muscle into this "people's 
war" in the northeast, recruited quickly on their  
side./

Peking's public media began to play down the 
Chinese statements of support, reflecting a decision 
which probably was made in late August or early 
September 1970. The last NCNA initiated comment on 
the insurgency was broadcast on 4 September. Subse-
quently, NCNA has not initiated its own comment, citing 
instead other sources. 
The source of propaganda was shifted to broad-
casts of a new political instrument: The Voice of the 
People of Burma (VPB). It is a clandestine radio 
operation, broadcasting from within China, pinpointed 
in location to Mangshih, Yunnan and established in 
March 1971. Depicted to foreign audiences as the 
iDsurgents' "own" radio station, it is run by tbe 
Chinese. This shift in the overt source of propaganda, 
intended to conceal from innocents the fact that Peking 
was the ultimate source, and intended to improve the 
PRC international image, almost certainly reflects 
Chou En-lai's diplomacy-conscious thinking. Chou 
apparently had persuaded Mao that insurgency-support 
impedes diplomatic maneuvering, that such support 
should be given a much lower public profile, and that 
one way to lower the public profile would be to establish 
a new clandestine radio attributed to the insurgents 
alone. The establishment of the radio also suggests 
that while Mao was persuaded to act to aid PRC diplo-
matic requirements, he preferred a course which was 
only a new way to provide propaganda guidance and 
encouragement of the insurgency, not the total cessation

of support. The cases of Thailand and Malaysia show 
a similar shift of propaganda guidance and support 
away from Peking's public media (particulaIly Radio!, 
Peking broadcasts and NCNA press articles) to the 
ongoing broadcasts of the clandestine radios assigned 
to beam programs into Thailand and Malaysia.. 
The new not-made-in-Peking profile was also 
used to pave the way for an exchange of ambassadors, 
with the Burmese man arriving in Peking in November 
1970, When, in March 1971, the Chinese finally sent 
their ambassador to Rangoon, the Chinese inaugurated 
the new clandestine radio. But it would seem that 
Chinese material aid to the insurgents is a more ac-
curate measure of Peking's attitude toward Rangoon 
than the state of diplomatic relations. Ever since 
the change in overt propaganda support in the fall 
of 1970, there has been no evidence of  a reduction  
in Chinese military aid in the period.

The Chinese leaders were not that much anxious 
to improve diplomatic relations with Rangoon that they 
would avoid criticizing Ne Win's government. On the 
contrary, they used the clandestine radio to mount 
vehement attacks on that government, and Ne Win was 
reported to have been extremely embarrassed by the 
start of the broadcasts less than one week after the 
arrival of the new Chinese ambassador in Rangoon 
(March 1971). The clandestine radio provided even 
stronger political support for the insurgency and

Northeast Command overran Burmese counterinsurgency 
bases near Kunlong, a town about 60 miles northeast 
of Lashio and only 15 miles from the border, On 15 
August, the clandestine radio in Yunnan called his 
visit one of several "sly tricks" to overcome his 
domestic problems and repeated the belligerent appeal 
to Burmese to unite with the BCP "to crush the reac-
tionary Ne Win government." On 17 August, the in-
surgents captured Hopang, a town 10 miles east of 
Kunlong. In view of Chinese control over the North-
east Command's military operations, these mid-August 
attacks (the first since the seizure of Mengmao in 
May, 70 miles east of Lashio) may have been ordered 
by Peking partly with the purpose of reminding Ne 
Win of China's policy to sustain the insurgency. 
Ne Win was silent for more than a month after 
his return. There is little doubt that during many 
long hours of private talks with Chou he had not 
succeeded in gaining an assurance that support for 
the insurgents would end. The Yunnan-based VPB 
continued to hammer at him as "the common enemy" who 
had to be "crushed." (VPB broadcast of 3 October 
1971) It also taunted him for having tried to pre-
vent his troops from listening to VPB broadcasts: 
"Even if Ne Win prohibits them, they will listen to 
the broadcasts..." (VPB broadcast of 7 October 
1971) As for the guidance-disseminating role of the 
VPB, on 20 August 1972, important instructions were 
being beamed into Burma from the clandestine radio. 
On that date, the excerpts of an instructional speech 
(given by Chairman Thakin Zin) were relayed by the 
radio, stressing the need for recruitment of new 
party members based on a "unity-with-allies" prin-
ciple. The instructions also declared the necessity 
to "crush" the "common enemy, the Ne Win-San Yu 
clique."

In the field of actual fighting, the highest 
point of the insurgency in the northeast occurred 
after Ne Win's visit and his requests in Peking that 
PRC support be ended. On 20 November 1971, undoubtedly 
with Chinese initiative, insurgent forces attacked 
Kunlong and held it under siege for a month. On 5 
December, the Chinese-run VPB beamed a broadcast com-

troops had been killed. Until this major attack -- the 
biggest engagement since Independence in Burma -- the 
insurgents had confined themselves to attacks on  
smaller targets.

Armed insurgent strength in the Wa region south 
of Kunlong was estimated in June 1972 to be about 
1,500. These units are well-armed with Chinese-made 
weapons. The contingents which seized Pangyang in  
May used mortars before the final assault.1 
The fighting in the Wa area was the most in-
tensive and extensive since the attacks on Kunlong. 
Insurgent successes there may have been a factor in 
the timing of Ne Win's decision, reported in mid-June, 
to seek military equipment from the Soviet Union. 
Rangoon is mainly interested in automatic weapons 
and ammunition, mortars, and artillery shells. Sub-
sequently, Ne Win decided against seeking Soviet aid.

However, Peking is taking only superficial 
actions to conceal its support for the BCP (White 
Flag). One of these moves is the decision to keep 
Burmese Communist leaders away from the 31 July 1972 
Army Day reception in Peking, in contrast with their 
attendance at the 1971 turnout. Nevertheless, on 
20 August 1972, the clandestine radio broadcast in-
structions to the insurgents from the party leader, 
Thakin Zin. 
Peking is expanding the insurgency -- already 
spaced out over six years -- at a slow pace. The in-
tention seems to be to keep it at a low boil and to 
seize small amounts of land, calculating that such 
nibbling will not be used by Ne Win to sound an alarm 
among major world powers. Some of the land now 
seized is referred to as "liberated areas" by the 
insurgents in the field and their Chinese sponsors, 
and it is unlikely that it will be voluntarily 
returned to the control of government or non-Communist 
forces. 
Prior to the ceasefire in Vietnam (January 
1973) there was no indication that it would in any 
way affect the PRC's policy of sponsoring the in-
surgency in Burma. The Chinese-run VPB made it clear

that this policy would go forward at a deliberate 
pace, and subsequently, as recent as 18 March 1973, 
the VPB called for more people in Burma to take the 
path of "revolution," demanding that they "oppose 
and fight the Ne Win-San Yu military government." 
The insurgency in the northeast probably 
will continue to be sponsored by Peking at least 
until Mao dies. Chou En-lai and other Chinese 
officials have attributed the PRC policy directly 
to Mao -- as something that he desires. In the 
view of this author, this is the single most im-
portant factor in Peking's sponsoring role. 
Thailand 
The insurgency in north and northeast Thailand 
is inspired and guided by Peking. When, in 1967, 
the more active dissident area -- the northeast -- was 
hard hit by Thai government forces, Peking subsequ-
ently acted to give it material aid, political resolve, 
and psychological sense of purpose. Peking almost 
certainly has the ultimate deciding voice in the 
strategy of insurgency in both areas, demonstrably

Thus within the context of overall guidance, Peking 
is the dominant influence among Communist Party of  
Thailand (CPT) leaders./ 
The CPT has been under Chinese Communist con-
trol ever since it came into existence in 1926. The 
CPT leadership which emerged in later years did so 
exclusively under the tutelage of the Chinese Com-
munist Party (CCP). In the mid-1960's there became  
available confirmation of this fact. 
Peking has retained the ability to exert over-
all guidance of the insurgency in the north and north-
east because the top leaders of the CPT remain loyal 
to the huge parent party, the CCP. The CCP trained 
these leaders, promoted them, and now sustains them.

 /More importantly, there are no signs 
of real organizational independence, although leaders 
in the northeast may have some autonomy in tactical 
matters. There are no independent Ho Chi Minhs or 
Fidel Castros in the CPT. The tie between the CCP 
and the CPT is more than an ideological link. It 
is an organizational link. 
The main radio station devoted to guidance 
and indoctrination of the CPT insurgents in the 
north and northeast is the Chinese-run Voice of the 
People of Thailand (VPT), broadcasting into Thailand 
from its base near Kunming, Yunnan., Radio Hanoi re-
plays various broadcasts of the VPT, including battle 
reports, but the North Vietnamese do not have a 
separate radio station assigned to covering the in-
surgency. 
The VPT, like the two additional clandestine 
radio stations broadcasting from south China, relays 
something more than mere propaganda, It is concrete 
guidance. The 1 December 1972 CPT Central Committee 
"statement" which it broadcast into Thailand con-
tained explicit instructions on an entire range of 
concrete policies. The contents of the CPT "statement" 
-- identical in style, wording, and policy-position 
with CCP materials -- make it highly likely that it 
was drafted by the Chinese Communists in China and 
approved by the CCP leadership. The "statement" is 
an operational one, inasmuch as it tells insurgents 
in the field what they must do. 
The "statement" lays it down to CPT personnel 
that "armed struggle" is the only way to attain 
national power-- the position opposedly'the'SoViets, 
and.by some CPT members in previous years. The

correct one. 
The past 30 years have proven 
that the revolution can never be 
achieved through peaceful means, a 
parliamentary system or a coup d'etat 
over a deadly enemy, armed from head 
to foot, which rules by a savage 
fascist dictatorship. 
It states that the insurgent army is set up on the Mao 
model as "a new-type revolutionary army, in accordance 
with Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought;" this army 
has a 10-point "code of conduct" and was established 
with great stress on "cultivating a sense of political 
consciousness in our fighters." The "statement" in-
structs that guerrilla areas must be "transformed" 
into strongholds, 
Moreover, in order to strengthen 
these revolutionary strongholds, we 
must further enhance the people's 
revolutionary power, expand the 
people's armed forces -- including 
irregular forces, regional forces, 
and village fighters -- raise the 
political and ideological level of 
the people, lead the masses in solv-

development, improve the welfare of

Continuing this instruction, personnel are told that 
"we must" construct the CPT along Maoist political, 
organizational, and ideological lines; all party 
members "must" grasp party policy, which includes 
Mao's prescription for inner-party struggle -- namely, 
"cure the sickness to help the patient, and unity-
criticism-self-criticism-unity." Further instructions 
are that all party units "must" do a good job in re-

study ability and performance before promoting cadres, 
and "must" promote organizational and disciplinary 
principles within the party. 
The "statement" sets a "main task" for the 
CPT. It stresses the need to "build more strong-

stronghold and guerrilla zone. The "statement" 
details the steps that "must" be undertaken by the 
populace in the strongholds and by all insurgent 
combat personnel.

to strengthen the strongholds, boost

The CPT leadership is primarily Chinese, with 
only a few Thais having boen promoted to key positions, 
and these having been trained for many years in China. 
This ethnic Chinese domination at the top of a Peking-

CPT at the November 1960 conference of Communist parties

CPT does not display any of the independence associated 
with a really unsubordinated party apparatus. By con-
trast, the independent North Vietnamese -- leaders of 
the Lao Dong Party -- adopt a position of neutrality 
in the dispute, clearly showing unsubordinated status. 
CPT greetings to the CCP have none of the self-respect 
of Lao Dong Party greetings, but they display instead 
a sycophantic quality to the parent party, especially 
in the sustained tribute to Mao's "thought," indicating 
apparatus subordination.

Prior to 1967, the insurgency in the northeast 
was not well-organized and there was nothing of signi-
ficance under CPT control stirring in the tribal areas 
of Lhe north. The Chinese, in several steps strung out 
over the years, and with North Vietnamese help, moved 
in the direction of sponsoring a viable guerrilla war, 
making it more professional and efficient than anything 
previously in Thailand. 
In mid-1962, the Chinese established a key 
guidance and indoctrination instrument: the VPT radio 
station near Kunming, Yunnan. VPT broadcasts en-
couraged the insurgents to begin a Mao-model "armed 
struggle" against local government forces.\ 
Peking introduced a sense of urgency into this 
low-boil insurgency only when larger strategic con-
siderations confronted the Chinese and North Vietnamese 
leaders. The major consideration was the establishment 
of more U.S. air bases in Thailand to be used in support 
of the allied effort in Laos. (Souvanna Phouma first 
requested U.S. reconnaissance in May 1964, and a month 
later these planes were authorized to return fire. 
Thai pilots participated by mid-1964, manning some T-28 
bombers. All this was from bases in Thailand.) Peking's 
attention turned to Thailand to warn the Thai leaders

against cooperation with the U.S. against Communist 
forces in Laos, and then to punish the Thai leaders for 
not responding properly to the warning, Thus the marked 
increase in Peking's attention to the Thai insurgency 
had its beginning in a punishment motive, But, as will 
be shown, at the same time a revolutionary motive was 
present in Mao's policy thinking on supporting such in-
surgencies, 
The Chinese acted to revive the small insurgency 
by directing CPT cadres in the field to expand their 
recruitment among non-Communist dissidents. An addi-
tional course of action was Chinese use of various anti-
Bangkok Thai leaders in several "front" groups to serve 
as a rallying point for dissidents anywhere in Thailand, 
The "front" groups were organized in Peking, 
In November 1965, Radio Peking and the VPT simul-
taneously announced the formation of the openly anti-
Bangkok Thai Independence Movement (TIM), On 1 January 
1966, the Thai Patriotic Front (TPF) was placed along-
side the TIM to serve as a possible rallying organization 
for anti-Bangkok dissidents, The idea was to bring 
together Thai elements who would agree to openly criticize 
the government and cooperate with Peking in building 
an out-of-country political entity. These "fronts," 
however, later proved to be ineffective. They included 
in their ranks Thai exiles who began to quarrel among 
themselves, and in 1969 they were marked for discard when 
the Chinese decided to stress the direct leadership role 
of the CPT of the insurgency. Unlike the "fronts," the 
CPT was a disciplined and obedient instrument of Peking's 
policy. 
The course taken to expand the insurgency can 
be traced back to September 1964, although low-boil 
training of guerrilla fighters had taken place in

In the field in the northeast, it was not until 
1966 that the CPT-led insurgents shifted their tactics 
from avoiding contact with Thai armed forces to a military

guerrillas were handed a major defeat in 1967, In 
February and August, Thai security forces captured 
key Communist guerrillas in the northeast, virtually 
destroying the insurgency there for several years. 
The Chinese shifted their attention in 1967 from 
the ruins of the guerrilla effort in the northeast to 
the north, In the north, the Chinese saw greater as-
sets and potential. The insurgents were mostly tribal 
(Meo), and they were better fighters. The rugged 
mountains provided safer sanctuary; and supply lines 
from China through Laos were shorter. The CPT was to 
recruit among them. 
Meo people in the north had been trained, on 
a small scale, in North Vietnam and China prior to 
1967. But in that year, the effort may have been  
stepped upfli 
 /The Chinese have placed 
a very strong emphasis on the need for insurgents to 
be totally indoctrinated and organizationally well-
disciplined. The idea of insurgents "gradually raising 
their political consciousness and sense of organization" 
in order to make a revolution succeed (Peking reople's  
Daily, Red Flag, Liberation Army Daily joint editorial 
of 1 OcTiTer 972) is considered by the Chinese one of 
the clear differences between Mao's road and Guevara's 
"purely military" road. The imposition of this idea

organizers in the north and northeast has helped give 
the insurgencies there the firm fou%dation of discipline 
needed to make a revolution advance. Political commit-
ment undoubtedly was stressed in the course of training  
of Meo and Yao tribesmenC 
The shift to the Meo insurgents in the north 
was also reflected in Peking's indoctrination and 
guidance instruments. Starting in the summer of 1968, 
Radio Peking and the VPT began carrying Meo-language 
broadcasts to the tribal fighters. The content was 
inflammatory and clearly intended to turn the Meos 
decisively against the government, (Fighting between 
the Meos and government forces had already broken out 
in the north in early 1968; more seriously, an insurgent 
unit had attacked the town of Chon Daen in the tri-
province aiea farther south in November 1968.) In 
September 1968, greatly intensified broadcasting from 
China became a regular feature of Chinese support and 
guidance. The theme was oppression of the Meo people. 
The theme has been carried through to the present time. 
An example of Peking's indoctrination and stimulation 
effort follows: 
The US-Thanom clique has constantly 
looked down upon the Meo people.... 
The Meo tribesmen have earned their 
living for generations without the 
help of an oppressive administration... 
the CPT is leading the people to rise  
and stage a revolution,..the Meo 
people have no alternative,..than to 
take arms and fight against it...

August 1969) (Emphasis supplied)

contents of a leaflet mailed to a "village volunteer" 
member in south Thailand on 26 June 1972 used themes 
which appear in VPT broadcasts: the goal of the in-

In parallel with their stress on political com-

ening military organization in insurgent ranks. A

Command." Significantly, this information was for the

1 January 1969. The insurgent forces in north and 
northeast Thailand were renamed the "Thai People's 
Liberation Armed Forces" (TPLAF), organized to fight 
under the "Supreme Command." On 3 January Radio 
Peking took the unprecedented step of having a 
Chinese official's promise made public to provide 
"more powerful support to...the revolutionary people 
of Thailand." 
Thereafter in 1969, the Chinese began to refer 
openly to another organizational improvement -- namely, 
to the CPT's leadership role of the insurgency. Refer-
ences to the useless political "fronts" (the TIM and  
TPF) were dropped from Peking media statements.  
Recruitment and organizational efforts were 
thereafter partly directed toward winnin the support 
of the Meo seosle for the TPLAF.

Beginning in early 1971, Chinese broadcasts re-
flected an apparently optimistic appraisal of the in-
surgency gains in the north and northeast. By late 
summer, the claims were that "relatively consolidated 
revolutionary base areas have been set up in certain 
regions in north Thailand." (NCNA article of 6 August 
1971)  The Doi Pha Chi camp was a consolidated base  
area.

In the immediate future, it is highly unlikely 
that Peking will stop sponsoring the insurgency. If 
it were merely a matter of improving its international 
image for diplomatic reasons such support might cease. 
However, not only the clandestine VPT radio station 
but NCNA, in its own name, has denounced the "Thanom-
Praphat clique," praised the outlawed CPT, and en-
couraged the TPLAF to fight on and grow in strength 
"under extremely difficult conditions." (NCNA com-
mentary on the 8th anniversary of the insurgency, 
broadcast from Peking on 7 August 1972) Thus despite 
Chou En-lai's friendly welcome to the leader ("advisor") 
of the Thai table tennis delegation on 5 September 
1972, government-to-government relations will be 
kept distinct from PRC support.

While Mao lives, Peking probably will persist 
in sponsoring the CPT in the insurgency. At the same 
tim, it will continue with its diplomacy, raising it 
to a higher level of official contact with Bangkok. 
This dual policy will require a clear-cut separation 
of insurgency-support from diplomacy, and Peking in 
October 1972 did just that by avoiding any mention of 
National Day greetings from the CPT. Nevertheless, 
the VPT still beams its broadcasts into ThaLland from 
China to buoy up insurgent morale, to set propaganda 
themes for them, and to incite anti-Bangkok animosity 
in order to help them recruit followers. 
The Thais have asked that the Chinese stop the 
VPT's subversive broadcasts. The response of the 
Chinese leaders has been most recently made clear by 
a broadcast stating, in effect, that the request will 
be denied. The broadcast, beamed from China, celebrated 
the 11th anniversary of the VPT, and went on to declare

This deliberate Chinese rebuke to the Thai leaders is 
another indication that insurgency-support will continue 
despite the ceasefire in Vietnam. 
The insurgency has shown significant concrete 
gains in the last two years. More PLA personnel may 
be sent in to be integrated into insurgent ranks. 
The number of insurgents in the north and northeast 
has been increasing each year. In September 1972, 
estimates put the figures at about 2,900 armed person-
nel in the north and about 2,000 in the northeast. 
Peking probably will support the expansion of these 
regular force units with even more Chinese-made 
armament, which may include new items, such as heavy 
machine guns, to supplement the weapons now coming 
into the north and northeast.

PEKING'S INSPIRATIONAL ROLE 
The Philippines  
Peking's support of the new, Maoist anti-govern-
ment insurgency in the various Philippine islands is 
primarily in the form of political guidance and encourage-
ment. However, there is good evidence of training and 
some funding of pro-Peking leftists over the years. 
By far the most important, enduring, and substan-
tive input from the Chinese Communists, however, is the 
mental hold they have over the young Filipino Communist, 
Jose Ma. Sison (aka Amado Guerro) who has strongly sup-
ported Peking on political issues and on the tactics 
for carrying out the insurgency. This commitment was 
made between mid-1966 and mid-1967, during his visits 
to CEina. Through Peking's guidance and influence, Sison 
has split off a young and more violence-oriented faction 
of Communists from the old Communist Party of the Philip-
pines (PKP) and a less corrupted faction of insurgents 
from the old and degenerated Huk guerrilla movement. 
With this nucleus and with strong political support 
from Peking, Sison has implanted a new insurgency in 
northeastern Luzon (recently taking hold in other areas) 
which is more disciplined than the old Huk movement. 
He has directed the expansion of his political and 
military components along the lines prescribed by his 
"god," Mao Tse-tung, Sison stresses gradual expan-
sion of "base areas," "quick-decision" warfare, "mass 
work," organizational discipline, and party control 
over the army ("the party controls the gun"). The 
Chinese seem to be satisfied that the commitment of 
this new leader to Mao's policies is so strong that 
he is as good as a CCP official in the field.

SEC; R ET 
The conversion of PKP-member Sison from his dedi-
cation to urban youth radical activities -- as leader 
of the ultra-left Patriotic Youth organization in Manila 
to dedication to Maoist rural armed insurgency was the 
? result of a confluence of several events. First, he 
had been feuding with older PKP leaders at the time when 
Mao's Cultural Revolution erupted in China. Also at 
that time, the Chinese leaders were casting about for 
support from radicals in various non-Communist Asian 
countries where US forces were based and were being 
used to aid Vietnam war efforts. Finally, Mao's dis-
pute with the Soviet leaders on an entire range of 
issues -- including the demands that foreign Communists 
condemn the CPSU openly and support Mao's obsession that 
"only" armed insurgency is the road to power for Com-
munist parties -- was intensifying. Unlike the leaders 
of the old PKP, who avoided denouncing the US, remained 
neutral in the Sino-Soviet dispute, and rejected rural 
insurgency, Sison adopted all of Mao's pcsitions. 
In the fall of 1966, Sison was far more willing 
than the PKP leadership to denounce the presence of 
US bases in the Philippines and to launch his youth 
activists into organized demonstrations against this 
presence And he was willing to take on the PKP in 
an internecine fight to move it into the Chines2 camp 
against the Soviets. He was strongly encouraged and 
influenced by the Chinese all along the way. 
The Chinese role in Sison's conversion was spread 
out over a period of two years, 1966 and 1967. As in the 
Thailand case, Peking first began to encourage insurgent 
forces in Luzon -- the old Huk units -- when it became 
apparent to the Chinese leaders that President Marcos' 
administration had decided to cooperate with the US 
military effort in Vietnam. In February 1966, at the 
time when the Vietnam aid bill of Marcos was pending

in Congress and was the center of a major dispute, Radio 
Peking broadcasts to the Philippines for the first time 
changed in nature, from avoidance of comment on Philip-
pine internal matters to open encouragement of the in-
surgents. Broadcasts in Tagalog and Filipino to the 
islands drastically increased. Some Chinese leaders 
may have tried to keep this change from injuring the 
few contacts made with  Philippine political figures on  
the diplomatic level./ 
  The Chi-
nese apparently had not yet reached the point of encourag-
ing a split in the old PKP, and in August 1966, they 
invited a PKP member, A.V. Hernandez, to Peking, where 
he spoke in praise of Mao, condemned "revisionism," and 
attacked the US on the Vietnam war. The Chinese clearly 
had begun to think in terms of punishment for the govern-
ment when, in late 1966, Peking began to add "the 
Milippines" to Laos, South Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, 
and Malaysia as Asian countries where armed struggle 
was developing.

In 1967, Sison found more favor with Peking. He 
had become an officer in two radical organizations set 
up in the spring of 1967, and he became active in these 
in addition to retaining his post as chairman of the 
radical youth organization. More importantly, at a 
time when Peking was encouraging splits within old-line 
parties of the Communist movement, Sison held a position 
on the Secretariat Staff of the PKP. Sison feuded with 
PKP leaders from the fall of 1966 to the spring of 
1967 -- that is, after his first visit to Peking and 
just before his second tour in China. The older PKP 
leaders insisted on remaining neutral rather than siding 
with Mao against the Soviet leaders, and because Sison 
could not impose his line (and for other reasons), he 
withdrew his small faction from the PKP in mid-April  
1967./ 
  How much encouragement 
the Chinese gave Sison to split the PKP from within is 
not known, but he clearly was aware that Peking was 
encouraging splits within other neutral or pro-Soviet 
parties. In any case, the result of his deliberate 
internal opposition was the formation of a nucleus 
within the PKP for Peking to support. Peking took 
Sison on as the most promising of the young, violence-
oriented Communists for the purpose of carrying out 
Mao's policy of making armed insurgency work. 
Following this internal split and prior to the 
formation of a separate party, the Chinese hosted Sison 
for seven weeks, beginning with his entry into China 
in May 1967. As in 1966, he held discussions with of-
ficials of the liaison organ, the Chinese People's 
Institute for Foreign Affairs, who almost certaiilly 
were briefed on the course of the internal PKP split, 
He was received by Foreign Minister Chen Yi on 7 June.

It was during this Chinese-sponsored visit that he be-
came the carrier of Mao's policy for the Philippine 
insurgency. 
In early May in Peking, Sison made his commitment 
clear in a strongly Maoist speech. He called for expul-
sion of the US from the islands, condemnation by the PKP 
of the CPSU, affirmation of "unity" with the CCP, and 
acceptance of the "success" of Mao's Cultural Revolu-
tion and of the superiority of Mao's doctrines. Sison 
declared "armed struggle" to be the PKP policy. He 
made an inspired defense of Mao's view that the "only" 
way to attain national power for Communists is "armed 
struggle," in the course of which the party must be 
entirely rebuilt and "rural bases" must be develc,ned. 
(Reprinted in New Zealand's People's Voice, 10 May 1967) 
His early May speech in Peking was followed by an NCNA 
announcement on 21 May which reported that, in a letter 
to the CCP or, I May, the PKP had pledged itself to a 
policy of "armed struggle." 
This direct intervention by the Chinese into the 
factional dispute within the PKP aligned the CCP with 
Sison's faction; the CCP supported his faction and en-
couraged him in his opposition. The Chinese-inspired 
"PKP" pledge appeared as a formal "PKP" politburo 
statement, the text of which was broadcast in Tagalog 
to the Philippines. It declared war on the "revision-
ist" faction. Later in May, a Peking-directed propa-
ganda campaign was unleashed, the broadcasts stressing 
Huk military operations and claiming that this was "a 
new development" toward armed insurgency in the Philip-
pines revolution. On. 29 May, for the first time, an 
NCNA article revealed that a Philippine People's Libera-
tion Army "led by the PKP" was actively engaged in 
guerrilla wai.fare on Luzon. On the 30th, a People's  
paily. commentary spoke of final victory "if, armed

tiFf(  
with Mao Tse-tung's Thought, they fight a people's war, 
establish revolutionary base areas, and encircle the 
cities from the countryside." Chinese influence in the 
formulations was undeniable. 
Owing to Mao's adamantly-pursued dispute with 
Moscow on ideological issues, the touting of the "PKP" 
at the time as a party dedicated to the doctrine of 
"armed struggle" was important. As in the cases of 
Burma, Thailand, and Malaysia, there is a very special 
motivation for Peking's enduring support of armed in-
surgency -- something aside from the anti-US aspect. 
That motivation is Mao's obsession -- or compulsion 
(Khrushchev had described it as an "itch") -- to prove 
to himself and to others that his road to power is 
the best and "only" road for revolutionaries. This 
obsession is irrational, as there are examples of 
revolutionaries taking power by palace coups and by 
legal election processes. But it exists as a funda-
mental motivating force, imbuing an otherwise strongly 
pragmatic foreign policy with an encumbering dogma. 
As recently as 1 December 1972, the Chinese have again 
asserted that neither coups nor elections can supplant 
armed struggle" as the only way to attain national 
power. 
25X1 
When it is expedient, for reasons of national 
interest, to disengage from insurgencies elsewhere in 
the world, the Chinese leader who desires such disengage-
ment (Chou En-lai is the most important) must persuade 
Mao that a particular insurgency must not be openly 
supported by Peking. And Mao apparently will accept 
disengagement from some but not from all insurgencies 
Peking had been supporting. The Philippines case shows 
continuing political support and favor towards the man 
who is leading "armed struggle" in the islands.

Within the following two years, that was roughly 
what Sison was successful in doing. Sison formed the 
new, pro-Chinese Philippine Communist Party-Marxist/ 
Leninist (PKP-M/L) when, on 26 December 1968, he took 
his followers out of the old, neutral PKP, breaking 
with the old-line leader Pedro Taruc and his followers. 
As for the military arm of the new Party, Sison managed 
to acquire this component of his new organization 
through an alliance. "Commander Dante," a former old-
line Huk, split with his Huk chief and joined Sison, 
and formed the New People's Army (NPA), the formation 
date being declared as 29 March 1969. 
In line with what Peking at that time in 1969 
was prescribing for insurgencies in Burma, Thailand, 
and Malaysia -- namely, that the party lead the army --
the NPA was made subordinate to the party, headed by  
Chairman of the Central Committee Sison.

  It is 
probable that Sison already has named a new NPA commander-
in-chief. Corpus would be the most likely choice. In 
any case, the involved Chinese have made it clear that 
they want Sison's men to continue to repudiate "the 
roving-rebel ideology" of the old Huks (NCNA article

the area of its military operations from central Luzon 
-- the old bailiwick of the Huks -- to Isabela Province 
in northeast Luzon, where the presence of sympathizers 
(particularly the local governor) facilitated survival, 
and where the terrain (surrounding mountains) enabled 
Sison and "Dante" to expand their forces in relative  
security.  
The Maoist orientation of Sison and his insurgent 
...Ines is apparent in many aspects. Political methods 
and guerrilla tactics have been taken from Mao's writings 
by Sison, who has annoyed other leaders by reiterating 
the Chinese hero's ideas on guerrilla warfare inces-
santly. Sison disseminates these ideas throughout the 
PKP-M/L and in the

PKP in 1972 has shown some signs of being revived -- or 
temporarily propped up -- as it has tried to compete for 
support among urban intellectuals by engaging in acts 
of violence (bomb-planting and assassination). But 
it clearly is now the inferior Communist Party in numbers, 
morale, and appeal among youthful radicals. 
As in the cases of Burma, Thailand, and Malaysia, 
small advances in diplomacy did not curtail Peking's 
support for the Sison insurgents. When in mid-May 
1971 two unofficial Philippine economic missions visited 
China and were received by Chou for a "friendly" conver-
sation, Peking had already lumped Presdient Marcos to-
gether with Ne Win in a Voice of the People of Burma (VPB) 
broac,cast on 18 April which declared that these two 
leaders could not prevent the "doom of being overthrown . 
by their own peoples" Following the economic missions' 
visits, NCNA cited a 21 May 1971 PKP-M/L newspaper article 
which praised the NPA exploits against the forces of the 
Philippine "reactionary government." And following the 
completion of the first major Philippine-PRC trade agree-
ment in late August 1971, NCNA carried two news articles 
on the 26 August destruction of three government heli-
copters by the NPA. 
Peking has carried reports indicating the areas 
of guerrilla activity and some of the Maoist military 
techniques being used. The insurgents were reported as 
operating not only in northeastern Luzon but also in 
other Luzon provinces, and in the Visayas and Mindanao. 
In February 1972, the insurgents claimed that 
Units of the NPA are now actively 
carrying out armed struggle in 
northern Luzon, central Luzon, 
southern Luzon, and the western

Visayas. In Mindanao, the party and 
the NPA have deployed cadres to train 
fighters from the poor peasants and 
oppressed national minorities to fight 
the Zandgrabbers and the reactionary 
armed forces. (NCNA excerpts of aag 
Bayan article, broadcast by Radio 
Peking on 3 May 1972) 
The PKP-M/L organ Ang Bayan claimed in late April 1972 
that "regular fighters" have increased eight-fold 
since 1969 and that "mass" support has been extended 
to 18 provinces of Luzon and western Visayas. Ang Bayan  
also claimed that the NPA now has the capability "to 
launch tactical offensives within the strategic defense,"  25X1 
the meaning of "tactical  offensives" 
probably being quick-decision 
ambush actions against government patrols of platoon 
size. (NCNA report of 29 April 1972) Sison's party 
organ on 9 September 1972 carried a completely Mao-
oriented report on how NPA forces had been able to 
thwart the encirclement campaign of the Philippine 
army's "reactionary" troops. "The NPA concentrated 
its main forces while evading the enemy main forces 
and annihilated small and isolated enemy units." 
(NCNA excerpts of Ang Bayan article, broadcast by 
Radio Peking on 5 December 1972) 
The Philippine insurgency has been expanding 
under Sison's control even thou .h its numbers are 
small.

The main source of arms and ammunition for the 
NPA is internal, that is, equipment comes from combat 
captures, purchases from gun-traffickers, and weapons 
roundups (or collection drives) carried out in the 
islands. In order to conceal the sordid, covert nature 
of some acquisitions of weapons, the insurgents claim 
that they are using primarily the prescription -- a 
Maoist one -- of obtaining weapons from the enemy. 
Mao had said of China's civil war that "the enemy is our 
supply sergeant" -- a position now found convenient 
for Peking to paraphrase in connection with weapons-
supplying of the NPA. Thus NCNA on 3 March 1972 made 
the following excerpts of a PKP-M/L newspaper article 
when discussing weapons acquisition: 
Confronted with the large-scale recruit-
ment of commanders and fighters for the 
NPA, the party and the people's army 
are fulfilling their arms requirement 
aEfEaEllli by relying on their own

(emphasis supplied) 
Given the availability of smuggled guns and the practice 
of many radicals of acquiring and storing weapons in 
urban areas, the 90 percent figure probably exaggerates 
the proportion taken in combat. The newspaper article 
sensibly does not indicate the source of the other 10 
percent of acquisitions.

On the diplomatic level, Peking's policy can be 
expected to move toward rationality by small degrees. 
This would mean more people- co-people contacts and, 
eventually, some official contacts. For more than a 
year -- that is, since June 1971, and even several 
months earlier -- NCNA articles broadcast by Peking 
on developments in the Philippines have shown a diplomatic 
sensibleness in r..voiding, for the most part, attacks 
on the Marcos dministration by name. More recently, 
Peking was careful to use foreign press reports to 
imply its criticism of Marcos' declaration of martial 
law (22 September 1972), and this particular restraint 
has been maintained. This is in line with the low 
profile of insurgency-support that Peking has adopted 
in open media. Peking. desires non-official relations

at the expense of endin all olitical su ort to the 
Sison forces. 
The Chinese will probably continue their broad-
casting of reports on developments in the insurgency. 
On the one hand, Radio Peking broadcasts will probably 
continue to avoid direct attacks on the Marcos ad-
ministration by name, using foreign press sources to 
relay such criticism. On the other hand, the VMR will 
probably be used, as it has been up until the present, 
to carry vituperative attacks on the Manila government. 
The Chinese do not operate a separate radio station for 
the Philippine insurgency; their policy has been to 
use the VMR. For example, on 9 September 1972, the 
VMR was used to broadcast to Malaysia and Singapore 
a statement from Sison's PKP-M/L which derided the 
government of President Marcos as a "puppet" regime 
of the U.S. 
The dedication of Sison to Mao's revolutionary 
views marks him as the most fervent Mao-idolizer of all 
pro-Peking foreign Communist leaders. In practical 
terms, this means he is conducting himself obediently 
in the Sino-Soviet dispute in criticizing Moscow by 
name and expanding the Mao-model revolution in the 
islands. Thus in his letter to the CCP on the 50th

anniversary of the Chinese party (July 1971), Sison 
personally disparaged the "Soviet Union" as "the 
4 
center of modern revisionism." He was emphatic in 
dedicating his party to sustained learning from the 
Chinese model: 
? 
The Communist Party of the Philip-
pines emulates the CCP. It constantly 
strives to grasp the teachings of Chair-
man Mao. The living study and applica-
tion of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung 
Thought in Philippine conditions is 
today the main concern of the Communist 
Party of the Philippines. (Sison 
message published by NCNA, 10 July 1971) 
Sison spoke also of moving the insurgency into the stage 
of "socialist revolution," which is to be the final 
revolutionary stage before seizure of national power. 
Even the future form of the Communist state is to be 
the "people's democracy" of Mao's terminology. On 3 
June 1972, an NCNA article declared the final goal of 
the Philippine insurgents led by the PKP-M/L to be such 
a Maoist "people's democracy." On 5 December 1972, 
an NCNA article praised the NPA for using Mao's tactics 
to destroy "reactionary" troops. 
Sison is acting to win important non-Communist 
political support for his insurgency, and has dangled 
the bait of a share in a future revolutionary govern-
ment to prospective allies./

Peking's two-level policy of diplomacy and 
insurgency-support probably will continue. As for 
Sison's policy, he probably will adhere to Mao's 
prescription for waging a protracted war, only 
gradually expanding party ranks, the NPA, and terri-
torial holdings.

West 
Peking has the overall guiding role in'the re-
vivied insurgency in northern West Malaysia (south of 
the Thai border). Its dominant influence is based on 
its control of the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). 
This party is virtually an operational wing of the CCP, 
and in the late 1940s and early 1950s some top MCP of-
ficials held dual membership in the CCP and the MCP. 
Top MCP officials may still be controlled by such dual 
membership today. In addition to the organizational 
tie, the strong racial tie is very important in sustain-
ing the subordination of the MCP and its insurgents to

the parent Chinese party: most of the insurgent Com-
munists are ethnic Chinese. Malaysia's Chinese school 
system has radical youth organizations which act as 
recruiting centers for the MCP, and recruiting in the 
countryside is also most effective among Chinese. 
The MCP today shows none of the independence 
which marks a free, unsubordinated Communist party. 
It obediently adopts all CCP positions in the Sino-
Soviet dispute without variation. It issues servile 
statements of tribute to the CCP and its leaders. 
For example, the 1 April 1972 MCP Central Committee 
letter of condolence on the death of CCP Politburo 
member Hsieh Fu-chih pledged to take Hsieh's revolu-
tionary attitude "as a model of our learning." More-
over, from 24-27 May 1972 the Voice of the Malayan 
Revolution (VMR) -- the Chinese-run covert radio 
station broadcasting from Changsha, Hunan in south-
central China -- imposed on insurgents in the field 
a series of broadcasts carrying the complete text of 
Mao's Talks at the Yenan Forum on Art and Literature  
(1942). Mainland cadres were subjected to the same 
study task on the 30th anniversary of Mao's Talks. 
The broadcasts implied that the MCP insurgents iii the 
field were under the same CCP ideological and organi-
zational discipline as mainland cadres. 
The Most important contribution Peking makes to 
the insurgency, is high-level guidance, indoctrination, 
and encouragement. There is abundant evidence that 
insurgents in the field use broadcasts of the VMR to 
set themes for indoctrination lectures. Many of the 
broadcasts used for political-toughening also carry 
detailed information on PRC developments through the 
broadcasting of articles in the Peking People's Daily  
and Red Flag. The organizing and political-toughening 
role?WT this radio station's broadcasts goes beyond 
mere revolutionary rhetoric and becomes practical aid.

Most of the insurgents in northern West Malaysia 
are Chinese, not Malays (who distrust Communist con-
cepts), and some have been infiltrated from China. But 
most of them have been in the field since the end of 
the Emergency (1948-1960), when Malaysian security forces 
chased them into southern Thailand. Many new cadres 
have been recruited in the field and never have been 
to the mainland. Because of the difficult jungle ter-
rain and the cooperation of the local inhabitants in 
West Malaysia -- mostly cooperation by local Chinese --
Malaysian security forces are encountering difficulties 
in courterinsurgency operations. Peking now seems to 
be determined to broaden the ranks of the MCP and its 
combat arm, the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA) 
so that more Malays are brought in. The insurgents 
are going about this kind of party-building in a gradual, 
deliberate way, but the resistance of the Malays to 
Communist appeals will continue to impede the pace of 
expansion. 
Chinese support of the insurgency is maintained 
under a clear distinction between government and party 
relations. Like the situation existing between Peking 
on the one hand, and Rangoon, Bangkok, and Manila on the 
other hand, improvements in government relations do not 
carry with them a reduction or cessation of PRC support 
of the Communist insurgents. Mao is apparently unwill-
ing to close down support, as was done in the period just 
after World War II by the Soviets and in the mid-1950s 
by the Chinese during the policy of Bandung-inspired 
peaceful coexistence. Ending of support was criticized 
as a "mistake" at the peak of Mao's Cultural Revolu-
tion in August 1967 in Peking by a Malayan Communist 
leader, who is a client of the CCP. In a real sense, 
PRC support of the insurgency is a continuation of Mao's 
thinking during his Cultural Revolution regarding nearby 
guerrilla wars.

The support, in contrast to the direct support 
given the Burma and Thailand insurgencies, does not 
include direct physical inputs, for obvious logistical 
reasons, 
The impetus for reviving the insurgency in West 
Malaysia came from Peking, and at the time of the peak 
of Mao's "anti-revisionist" Cultural Revolution, in 
mid-1967, By mid-1968, some 600 armed Communist in-
surgents, who had huddled in sanctuaries in southern 
Thailand where they had been chased in the late 1950s 
by Malaysian security forces, began to move gradually 
from inactive to active status under stimulation from 
Peking. They MOVEZ; back across the border, first to 
reconnoiter and then permanently to position themselves 
in small base areas in northern West Malaysia, The

at the close of the Emergency (1948-1960), expanded to 
about 1,000 by mid-1968, to about 1,600 in mid-1970, 
and to about 1,800 in mid-1972, The slow upward pro-
gression in the number of armed insurgents represents 
a positive gain, and the existence of small bases capable 
of accommodating about 40-60 CTs points toward a long-
term potential expansion. 
The kindling spark was presumably in the form 
of a secret directive during Mao's Cultural Revolution, 
but the public form of the spark came as an article 
written by a Chinese Communist client in Peking: a 
Malay Communist, P,V, Sarma, Chief of the Malayan 
National Liberation League (MNLL), The exhortations in 
the article, which was published in the MNLL's Mao-line 
journal in August 1967, in effect directed the Malayan 
Communists to get out of front activities in Malayan 
parliamentary politics and out of the southern Thailand 
sanctuaries, to take up their weapons, and to start 
organizing themselves for serious work: guerrilla war-
fare. It insisted that "armed struggle" was the only  
way to attain political power, that the MCP had made 
a serious "mistake" in abandoning armed struggle just 
after World War II, and that the situation was becoming 
favorable for a resumption of guerrilla warfare to be 
handled in a well-organized way. 
The article of Sarma had considerable signi-
ficance, The fact that this key article was written while 
the author was in Peking as the representative of the 
MNLL and that it contained Mao-type exhortations on 
the absolute need for "armed struggle" as the only road 
to power in Malaysia indicates that it represented a 
Chinese Communist initiative, Peking's ideological 
position that "armed struggle" should be the main form 
of struggle in Malaysia was affirmed in the formal MCP

replace political-front work and "parliamentary" 
politics. The statement was another indication of MCP 
subordination tc the parent Chinese party. 
Thus tho stage of beginning the armed struggle 
was reached in West Malaysia in June 1968. The same 
held true for  the beginning of political agitation among 
the "masses":/ 
25X1 
25X1 
The 
course of insurgent military actions between 1968 and 
1P72 in the field demonstrates that Peking and its client, 
the MCP, were not engaged only in the rhetoric of revolu-
tion, but were also engaged in the real thing. That 
is, Peking's support was not merely token aid, not 
simulated aid of no real account. On the conL:arv, 
Peking's guidance, indoctriaation, and enc,wragemt 
activities were positive concrete act: J;oigned tn tave

units and undertaking selective sabotage of key instal-
lations in West Malaysia. Toward the end of 1968, the 
number of MNLA -- or CT -- incursions from southern 
Thailand gradually increased. In late 1970, it was 
solidly confirmed that small groups of CT infiltrators 
had permanently established small bases for inside-
Malaysia operations -- a development occuring for the  
first time since the late 1950s.) 
The CTs were still building their units and were 
not in a phase of general offensive operations. But 
they did engage in selective strikes against government 
forces. A major incident involving the mining by CT 
forces of the main west coast road linking Malaysia 
and Thailand took place in late October 1969. On 10 
December, a strategic installation was hit: a group 
of CTs blew up the 100-foot-long railway bridge on 
Malaysian territory about two miles southwest of 
Padang Besar, Perlis Province, severing for a few days 
the main railway link between Thailand and Malaysia. 
Gradually the CTs increased the number of cross-border 
incursions, their calculation having been to demon-
strate their ability to operate on Malaysian territory 
without suffering excessive combat losses. They wanted 
to test their own ability to safely infiltrate, to hit 
important installations and roads, and to move bigger 
units across undetected. The planning was careful, the 
pace deliberate, and the actions generally low-risk. 
Peking's role in the overall guidance of these 
developments is further suggested by its establishing, 
on PRC soil, the clandestine radio station -- the 
VMR -- at a time when CT units first began to be embedded 
across the southern Thailand border. Inaugurated on 
15 November 1969, the radio station claimed to be the

In order to set forth "policies" and prepare "revolu-
tionary" public opinion, the VMR has been broadcasting 
to Malaysia and Singapore 56 hours per week. On oc-
casion, an entire week is devoted to one major subject. 
For example, from 4 co 10 October 1972, the VMR devoted 
its time exclusively to broadcasting the MCP's New 
Constitution. 
Since the fall of 1970, Peking has been sanitiz-

out derogatory references to the Malaysian leaders by 
name. But this effort to improve the diplomatic image 
to foreign audiences has not changed the nature of the 
broadcasts of the VMR which are beamed into Malaysia

insurgents to sustain their "armed struggle" in a pro-

significant fact that PRC-directed VMR broadcasts are 
made in three languages -- Chinese, Malay, and Tamil --
with almost equal time to Malay and Chinese Thus 
despite the fact that most pro-Communist elements in 
West Malaysia .are Chinese, Peking is actively trying 
to make inroads among the Malays The strong emphasis 
placed on influencing Malays toward the Communist in-
surgency reflects Peking's awareness that the guer-
rilla war cannot expand in a big way in actual ter-
ritory seized without bringing in this dominant  
national group.  
Peking had been carrying out a policy of unity-
of-all-nationalities in Burma and Thailand to expand 
insurgent ranks there, That a similar policy was 
operative in Malaysia is indicated by the new appeals 
to Malays in the field and in Peking-originated 
guidance An example of such guidance is the VMR 
editorial of 29 April 1972, later carried by NCNA on 
4 May in excerpt form, ieclaring that the MCP is the 
real representative of "all nationalities" of the 
country. For the most part, however, Malays (in 
contrast to the Chinese) have remained impervious 
to the influence of such Maoist indoctrination.

Since the revival of the insurgency in 1968, 
Peking has been working to raise the determination 
of the fighters to persist in a protracted war. 
Morale-building broadcasts are exaggerating the 
losses of government units whenever a minor clash 
between Malaysian security forces and the MNLA in 
border areas occurs. For example, on 3 July 1970, 
NCNA, quoting the China-based radio station, VMR, claimed 
that the CTs' 12th Regiment had shot down a fighter-
bomber and a helicopter and had damaged another heli-
copter. It also insisted that "the broad masses in 
the enemy-occupied areas are waging more extensive armed 
struggle in enthusiastic responso to the call of the 
MCP." 
The VMR continues to call for the "overthrow" 
of the government, to declare Mao's road to be the 
"only" one to attain power, and to remind MCP cadres 
that they "mast" sustain their study of Mao's ideology. 
In a major editorial greeting the PRC's National Day, 
the VMR declared on 30 September 1972 that 
Socialist China is an unshakable base 
area for the world revolutionw. 
From their protracted revolution-
ary practice, the people of our country 
have fully realized that to overthrow  
an imperialist-colonialipt rule and 
their puppets, we must rely only on  
arms but not on ballot boxes, as was 
pointed out in the important statement 
of the Central Committee of the MCP of 
25 April 1972 ....

cast of 4 November 1972) 
Separating diplomacy out fromlPeking's dual 
policy of diplomacy insurgency has been the task of 
Chou En-lai, who skillfully accentuated the positive 
during the May 1971 visit of the Malaysian trade 
delegation to Peking. Stressing diplomacy, Chou 
seemed to accept Malaysia as one country: he was the 
first Chinese leader to drop the usage, "Malaya," which 
had implied Peking's insistence (since the formation 
of Malaysia as a Federation in 1963) that it was still 
unacceptable as a single new state,. Chou tried to stay 
away from explicit and unequivocal statements regard-
ing the insur encv half of Pekin 's olic toward 
Malaysia.  
Actually, Chou's acceptance of Malaysia as a 
single country was only a dialectical tactic, to use

CCP language. Peking does not accept the existence 
of Malaysia. Chinese maps in 1965 did not show a 
federated Malaysia, but rather depicted Malaya as 
a separate country in the west and Sarawak and Sabah 
(i.e., most of North Borneo) as still under colonial 
rule in the east. Peking's new World Atlas, published 
in February 1972 by the PRC's Cartographic Institute 
and therefore representing the official view, con 
tinues this policy. Tt adheres to the pre-1963 name 
of "Malaya" on its map pages, and in the commentary 
accompanying the maps, the relevant section is called 
"Malaya." It also maintains ambiguity about whether 
Singapore is now an independent country or part of 
Malaya. Singapore is discussed under the "Malaya" 
section of the commentary, and on the map pages, 
it is divided from "Malaya" by a regional rather 
than an international boundary. More importantly, 
the commentary carries forward Peking's policy of 
supporting the insurgency, declaring in the Nalaya" 
section that "on 1 February 1949, a national libera-
tion army was established under the leadership of 
the Malayan Communist Party; it actively began a 
people's armed struggle." 
 I the VMR attacked 
"Razak and his ilk? (VMR broadcast of 28 August 1971). 
Similar attacks against the Malaysian leader have 
been continued by the Chinese-run clandestine radio.

Keeping any improvement in diplomatic or trade 
relations as a separate matter, which will not effect 
support for the insurgency, Peking had its NCNA publish 
two articles, one on insurgency in West Malaysia and 
the other on terrorist actions in East Malaysia (North 
Borneo), using the PRC-based 1/MR as the source of the 
commentaries. There have been small steps toward im-
proving relations. For example, a ping-pong delegation 
was sent to Peking in mid-August 1972, the PRC ambas-
sador in Rangoon attended the Malaysian National Day 
reception there on 31 August, and PRC central media 
avoided any mention of greetings from the MCP during 
the 1 October Natj.onal Day celebrations in Peking. 
Nevertheless, the Chinese have not disengaged from 
support of the insurgency. 
Most recently, they again have refused to 
disavow support of the MCP-led insurgents. In the 
course of this refusal, Chinese officials showed subtlety 
in trying to equate the anti-Razak broadcasts with the 
non-subversive, non-hostile, and non-revolutionary prac-
tices of most Western countries in disseminating religious 
and political views abroad. They adopted the tactic 
of making analogies where, in fact, sharp contrasts 
_xist. Their analogy-making procedure avoided all 
mention of the hostile nature of almost every VMR 
broadcast beamed into Malaysia which attack the 
domestic and foreign policies of Prime Minister Razak, 
as well as the Prime Minister personally as a "fascist

dictator." More importantly, their procedure was 
an effort to conceal the revolutionary-subversive 
intent of the broadcasts -- namely, to provide guid-
ance and to encourage the insurgents to do a profes-
sional job of expanding their armed units and the 
territory they hold. 
Devite the fact that the only condition 
Malaysia placed on establishing relations with 
Peking was that the PRC renounce its support of 
the MCP, in late November 1972 such a promise was 
not given. 
The Secretary General of the Malaysian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs told the US ambassador in Kuala 
Lumpur on 7 December 1972 that during his November talks 
with Chou, Chou reviewed the PRC position on the MCP 
in historical perspective, saying that China indeed 
supported the MCP in its struggle against British im-
perialism. PRC support continued today as a matter 
of ideology -- Chou depicted it as "akin to religion" --
to provide moral support for other socialist movements. 
Chou went on to say that this continued support should 
not be a matter of concern for Kuala' Lumpur because 
China would limit such support to the propaganda level. 
China would not engage in direct support of subversion 
against the Malaysian government. Chou also said that 
he was sure that this problem could be arranged between 
the two countries in a mutually satisfactory way. It 
is possible that Chou was hinting at a deal whereby Kuala 
Lumpur would agree to recognize the PRC as the only 
government of China at the price of Peking ceasing its

VMR broadcasts into Malaysia. It is more likely, how-
ever, that Chou's remark was intended to increase the 
optimism of Kuala Lumpur about an end to Chinese sup-
port in order to combat the retarding effect on im-
proved relations of counsel given Razak by Djakarta, 
Bangkok, and Manila. This would mean a greater in-
clination in Kuala Lumpur to further improve relations 
without, beforehand, attaining a PRC promise to end 
insurgency-support. 
In effect, as late as November 1972, Chinese 
officials explicitly refused to disavow support for 
wars of "national liberation," stating to Malaysian 
officials that support in the form of radio broadcasts 
and sympathy "would continue." This Chinese position 
was a direct rebuff to an explicit Malaysian request 
for an end to PRC insurgency-support. 
The insurgents in Malaysia are not yet in a 
general offensive stage. They are intensively work-
ing mainly on establishing more bases and recruiting 
personnel. NCNA broadcasts (as well as the VMR) have 
noted this situation, reflecting an awareness in 
Peking that the MNLA still represents a small insurgency 
by contrast with the Malaysian security forces in 
northern West Malaysia. Possibly in the ne.:1 year or 
two, the MNLA will resort to more offensive forays from 
base areas. Chinese political and radio propaganda 
support continues, and most likely will continue, at 
least until Mao dies.

Peking keeps its political support of the insurg-
ency in West Malaysia separate from its support of the 
even smaller terrorist operations of Communists in "North 
Kalimantan" -- the name Peking uses for North Borneo, 
consisting of Sarawak and Sabah in East Malaysia. The 
Chinese leaders were forced to a decision in 1963 when 
"North Kalimantan" became part of the new Malaysia Federa-
tion: to accept the coalescence of the new Malaysia and 
encourage the Sarawak Communists to coalesce into one 
party with the MCP or to follow Sukarno's "confronta-
tion" policy of opposing the union of "North Kalimantan" 
with Malaysia and thereby keeping the Sarawak Communists 
apart from the MCP. In deciding upon the latter course, 
the Chinese leaders in 1964 established in Peking a 
front, the North Kalimantan National Liberation League, 
led by Sarawak Communists. Peking media thereafter 
touted the small insurgency in broadcasts as a revolu-
tionary "armed struggle" distinct from MCP operations. 
The Sarawak Communists, desiring independence from 
Indonesia as well as from Malaysia, have also kept clear 
of-subordination to the Indonesian Communist Party. 
Until recently, the Chinese have equivocated on 
the matter of the existence or non-existence of a 
separate, independent "North Kalimantan Communist Party." 
a 
Sarawak Communist party had been established in January 
1968 and that its party constitution exists as well 
as its covert apparatus. The Chinese now seem willing 
to recognize the party. Their Yunnan-based VMR during 
the period between 2 and 12 December 1972 for the first 
time referred to the "North Kalimantan Communist Party,"

suggesting Peking's apparent view that the Sarawak' 
insurgents are somewhat more unified than previously 
and should be encouraged further to tighten up their 
organization. 
Chinese support of the North Kalimantan guer-
rillas -- the Sarawak Communist Organization (SCO), a 
name used for convenience in referring to them -- con-
sists of political guidance and encouragement. Ever 
since the formation of Malaysia in 1963, the Chinese 
have housed and used various Sarawak Communist leaders 
and "front" leaders in Peking. The journal of the 
North Kalimantan National Liberation League, Liberation  
News, is printed in China. In the fall of 1965, when 
the Indonesianarmy began a large-scale annihilation 
of Communists and suspected Communists, remnants of 
the Sarawak guerrillas moved across the border into 
the nearby jungles of East Malaysia, and the Chinese 
supported their cause. But systematic political 
guidance and encouragement did not begin until the start 
of Mao's Cultural Revolution. 
The new, systematic stage of Chinese guidance and 
encouragement began on 9 July 1966. On that da a 
North Kalimantan client of the Chinese

guerrillas to

of the "ruling clioue," 
(5) "wage the people's war," and 
(6) "persist in self-reliance." 
This Peking initiative was given additional force with-
in one month. Another North Kalimantan client of the 
Chinese was used by them to make a declaration from 
Shanghai on 9 August 1966. 
We must wage a people's war in accord-
ance with Mao Tse-tung's strategy and 
tactics for guerrilla war. In pa74ti-
cular, we must do mass work and rely 
on local armed units and militia. 
The Chinese used these two men to fire the opening shot 
in order to revive the small insurgency. By means of 
such programmatic instructions, the Chinese helped move 
the insurgency into a new stage, stressing the serious 
matters of the need to work with the populace, of the 
need for increased discipline and political commitment, 
and of the need for military professionalism.

The North Kalimantan guerrillrs began to in-
doctrinate their rank and file. Peking later stated 
that the North Kalimantan "People's Armed Forces" had 
"initiated a movement to study and apply, creatively, 
Chairman Mao's brilliant writings," especially those 
which insisted that real revolutionaries can win 
against the worst odds. (NCNA article of 28 December 
1968) The guerrillas "study Mao Tsetung thought in 
the course of their war, use it to review and sum up 
the practice of their struggle, and raise their under-
standing steadily," (NCNA article of 2 November 1969) 
Thus despite the small size of the insurgency, the 
Chinese were determined to help the guerrillas disci-
pline their ranks and deepen their political commit-
ment so that the movement would not sputter and die. 
Most of the weapons held by men in the field 
in this North Borneo mini-insurgency have been stolen, 
and there is no reliable evidence of outside sources 
of arms, ammunition, or other supplies, Their groups 
still are not big enough to combine into a guerrilla 
army ?hich could mount a sustained insurgency. However, 
from 1971 to the spring of 1972 their numbers have 
increased from 500 to about 1,000, Peking broadcasts 
since 1969 have been stressing the need to gain sup-
port of minority nationalities. The SCO has made some 
progress in recruiting among the Ibans -- a non-Malay 
tribal group which, together with local Chinese, pro-
vides areas of sanctuary for the terrorists when 
hounded by Malaysian government security forces, They 
do not seem to have a disciplined political organization. 
They do not have an intensive military trAining program 
or permanent base areas, as do the CTs in West Malaysia. 
However, they are troublesome enough to have impelled 
Malaysian authorities to launch counterinsurgency opera-
tions against them, draining off some security fortes 
from West Malaysia,

In recent years, both the VMR and Radio Peking 
have referred more and more to the North Kalimantan 
People's Armed Forces and have virtually dropped fefer-
ences to the front of the Sarawak Communists since 1969. 
As in the case of Burma, Thailand, and West Malaysia, 
great stress has been placed on building up contacts 
with "all" nationalities (rather than keeping the 
insurgency exclusively ethnic Chinese). But since 
permanent "base areas" apparently do not exist in 
Sarawak yet, such areas are not mentioned in broadcasts, 
although "mass work" reportedly has opened up some safe-
havens among the "various nationalities." An NCNA 
article of 23 February 1972, which claimed that the 
People's Armed Forces have existed since 1965, discussed 
SCO areas of operations without claiming the establish-
ment of "base areas" -- presumably a future target for 
the SCO. For the present, friendly zones were adequate. 
In the course of protracted revo-
lutionary struggle, the People's Armed 
Forces have done mass work apart from 
fighting. Thus they have established 
close relations with the masses of 
people of various nationalities like 
those of fish to water. The commanders 
and combatants of the People's Forces 
frequently go to the areas of various 
nationalities to live and labor together 
with the local people. They give medical 
treatment to the sick, concern themselves 
with the well-being of the masses, and 
propagate revolutionary truth among them. 
Not a few of the people have rendered 
support and protection to the People's 
Armed Forces, disregarding ti.eir own 
safety and even sacrificing their own 
lives. Whenever the reactionary troops

The article claims that the insurgents are improving 
their military and political training, studying "people's 
war" doctrine -- Mao's, by implication -- in order to 
"enhance their combat capability." As for the goals 
of the "protracted" war, the article maintains Peking's' 
ambiguity, saying only that the "revolution" in North 
Kalimantan should succeed but making no mention as to 
who is to be overthrown and whether it is independence 
that is to be attained. 
The insurgents in Sarawak and farther south in 
the western portion of Borneo (Kalimantan) apparently 
are still avoiding use of the phrase, "Communist Party," 
to depict their organization. The ambiguity of whether 
they are a separate "Communist Party" in a separate 
country or part of the larger MCP is being sustained. 
The insurgents may have banded together in a new 
organization to im rove their internal control structure

The Peking-run VMR continues to broa cast on evelopments 
in the insurgency in east Malaysia, and it is likely 
that these broadcasts as well as those of Radio Peking 
are monitored and utilized by the guerrillas. 
As in other cases of Peking's support for in-
surgency in Southeast Asia, there is today a clash 
between insurgency-support and diplomatic-advance in 
PRC policy. On the one hand, Peking's propaganda 
implies that liberation or independence from the 
Malaysian Federation is a demand of Sarawak Communists, 
that that is what they are fighting for, and that that 
is what the Chinese leaders are supporting. On the 
other hand, for diplomacy purposes, Chou En-lai in May 
1971 made reference to "Malaysia." This implied that 
Peking accepts the permanency and territorial integrity 
of the Federation as one state formed in 1963. This 
two-level policy of both insurgency-support and diplo-
macy shows no signs of ending.
