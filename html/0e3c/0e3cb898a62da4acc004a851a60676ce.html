Time and Place: 3 December 
1971. 11110 hours. Situation 
Room. White House. 
SUMMARY: 
Reviewed conflicting re-
ports about major action in 
the West Wing. CIA agreed 
to produce map showing 
areas of East Pakistan oc-
rupied by India. The Presi-
dent orders bold on issuance 
of additional irrevocable 
letters of credit involving 
599 million. and a hold on 
further action implementing 
the $72 million PI, 480 cred-
it. Convening of Security 
Council meeting planned 
contingent on discussion 
with Pak Ambassador this 
afternoon plus further clari-
fication of actual situation 
in West Pakistan. Kissinger 
asked for clarification of 
ci spoilt interpretation 
with 
KthsINGEIC I am gerung 
hell every hall hour from 
oth Prthellcin that we are 
not tieing tough enough on 
India. He has just called 
ale again. He does not ba. 
lieve we are carrying out 
Iris wishes. He wants to tilt 
in favor of Pakistan. He 
feels everything we do 
comes out otherwise. 
HELMS: Concerning the 
reported action in the West 
Wing, there are conflicting 
reports from both sides and 
the only common ground is 
the Pak attacks on the Am-
ritsar, ilathankat, and Srin-
agar airports. The Paks say 
the Indians are attacking all 
flung the border; but the 
Indian officials says this is 
a fie. In the East Wing, the 
action is becoming larger 
and the Poke claim there are 
now seven separate fronts 
involved. 
KISSINGER: Are the In.
seizing territory? 
11 E 1. MS: Yes; small bits of 
thrritory. definitely. 
SISCO: It would help ii 
You could provide a map 
with a shading of the areas 
occupied by India. What is 
happening in the West-is a 
toltioale attack likely? 
MOORER: The present 
',del, is puzzling in that 
the Paks have only struck at 
three small airfields which 
do not house significant 
numbers of Indian combat 
aircraft 
HELMS: Mrs. Gandhi's 
speech at 190 may well an-
nounce recognition of Ban. 
gla Desh, 
MOORER: The Pak attack 
is not credible. It has been 
made during late afternoon, 
which doesn't make sense. 
1Ve do not seem to have suf. 
(gloat facts on this yet. 
KISSINGER: Is it possible 
that the Indians attacked 
first, and the yaks simply 
did what they could before 
dark in response? 
MOORER: Tubs Is certain, 
IY possible. 
KISSINGER: The Presi. 
dent wants no Inure irrevo. 
cable letters of credit issued 
tinder the $99 million credit 
He wads the $72 million 
PI, 480 credit also held. 
WILLIAMS: Word will 
soon Oct around when we 
do this, ifites the President 
understand that? 
KISSINGER: That is his 
order, hut I will check with 
the President- again. If 
asked, we can say we are 
reviewing our whole era-
TIOnlie program and that the 
granting of fresh aid is being 
suspended in view of condi-
tions on the Subcontinent. 
The next issue -is the UN. 
CHURN: The Secretary is 
calling in the Pak Ale)ae. 
Seder this afternoon, mil 
the Secretary teens townrd 
making a U.S. move in the 
UN, soon. 
KISSINGER: The Presi-
dent is in favor of this as 
soon as we have some con-
firmation of this large-
scale new action. If the 
U.N. can't operate in this 
kind of situation effectively, 
its utility has come to an 
end and it is useless to 
think of U.N. guarantees in 
the Middle East. 
SISCO: We will have a 
recommendation for you 
this afternoon, after the 
meeting with the Ambassa-
dor. In order to give the 
Ambassador time to wire 
home, we could tentatively 
plan to convene the gem, 
KW Council tomorrow. 
KISSINGER: We have to 
take action. The President 
is blaming me, but you 
people are in the clear. 
SISCO: That's ideal! 
KISSINGER: The earlier 
draft statement for Bush is 
too evenhanded. 
SISCO: To recapitulate, 
after we have seen the Pak 
Ambassador, the Secretary 
will report to you. We will 
update the draft speech for 
Bush. 
KISSINGER: We can say 
we favor political accommo-
dation but the real job of 
the Security Council is to 
prevent military action. 
SISCO: We have never 
bade reply either from Ko-
sygin or Mrs. Gandhi. 
WILLIAMS: Are we to 
take economic steps with 
Pakistan also? 
KISSINGER: Wait until 
I talk with the President. 
He hasn't addressed this 
problem in connection with 
Pakistan yet. 
SISCO: If we act on the 
Indian side, we can say we 
are keeping the Pakistan sit. 
uation "under review." 
KISSINGER: It's hard to 
tilt toward Pakistan if lye 
have to match every Indian 
stop with a Pakistan step. 
If you wait until Monday, I 
can get a Presidential de. 
Melon. 
PACKARD: It should be 
easy for us to inform the 
banks involved to defer ac. 
don inasmuch as we are so 
near the weekend. 
KISSINGER: We need a 
WSAG in the morning. We 
need to think about our 
treaty obligations. I remem-
ber a letter or memo inter-
preting our existing treaty 
with a special India tilt. 
When I visaed Pakistan in 
January 1962, I was briefed 
on a secret document or oral 
understanding about contin-
gentles arising in othar than 
the SEATO context. PUrhaps 
it was a Presidential letter.

Group 4 
Downgraded at 3-y ear 
intervals; declassified 
after 12 years 
3. Summary. It was de. 
cided that the US would re-
quest an immediate meeting 
of the Security Council, The 
US resolution would be in-
troduced in a speech by Am. 
bassador Bush as soon as 
possible. The USG [U.S. 
Government] UN approach 
would Sr tilted toward the 
Pak. Economic aid for Pald-
stan currently in effect will 
not be terminated. No re-
quirements were levied on 
the JCS. 
4, Mr. Helms opened the 
meeting by indicating that 
the Indians were currently 
engaged in a no holds 
barred attack of East Paki-
stan and that they had 
crossed the border on all 
sides this morning. While 
India had attacked eight 
Pak airfields there were still 
no indication of any ground 
attacks in the West. Al. 
though not decreeing a for-
mal declaration of war Pres-
ident Yahya has stated that 
"the final war with India is 
upon us," to which Mrs. 
Gandhi had responded that 
the Pak announcement of 
war constituted the ultimate 
folly. The Indians, however, 
had made it a point not to 
declare war. The Indian at. 
tacks have hit a major POL 
[Petroleum oil-lubricant] 
area in Karachi resulting in 
a major fire which will 
likely be blazing for a con-
siderable length of time, 
thus providing a fine target 
for the Indian Air Force. 
Mr. Helms indicated that 
the Soviets were increas-
ingly supporting India. He 
atoned, however, that the 
Soviet assessment is that 
there is not much chance of 
a great power confrontation 
Is the current crisis. 
5. Dr. Kissinger remarked 
that If the Indians have an-
nounced a full scale inva-
sion, this fact must be re-
flected in our UN statement 
I. Mn. Helms indicated 
that we do not know who 
started the current action, 
nor do we know why the 
Pelts hit the four small air. 
beds yesterday. 
7. Dr. Kissinger requested 
that by Monday the CIA 
prepare an account of who 
did what to whom and when: 
I. Mr. DePalma suggested 
that if we refer to the In. 
dian declaration In our dis] 
cession in the UN, that we 
almost certainly will have to 
refer to remarks by Yahya. 
S. Dr, Kissinger replied 
that he was under specific 
instructions from the Presi-
dent and either someone in 
the bureaucracy would have 
to prepare this statement 
along the lines indicated or 
that it would be done in the 
White House. 
10, Mr. Helms referred to 
the "no holds barred" re. 
mark in the official Indian 
statement and similar re-
marks that were being made 
from the Pak side. 
11. Dr. Kissinger asked 
whether the Indians have 
stated anything to the effect 
that they were in an all out 
12. Mr. Helms said that 
the terminology was "no 
holds barred." 
13. Dr. Kissinger asked 
what the Paks have said. 
Mr. Helms said the termi-
nology was "final war with 
India." Dr. Kissinger sug-
gested this was not an objec-
tionable term. It did not 
seem outrageous to say that 
they (the Pak. were trying 
to defend themselves. 
19. Dr. Kissinger then 
asked what was happening In 
the UN, to which Mr. De. 
Palma responded that the 
UK (United Kingdom). Bel-
gium, Japan and possibly 
France were joining for a 
call for a Security Council 
meeting. The Japanese had 
detected some slight tilt in 
our letter requesting the 
meeting. The Japanese pre-
ferred a blander formula-
tion. We have not, however, 
reacted to the Japanese. 
15. Dr. Kissinger asked to 
see the letter and requested 
that it be promulgated ill 
announcing our move In the 
UN. to which Mr. DePaima 
responded affirmatively. 
If. Dr. Kissinger stated 
that while he had no strong 
view on the letter. our posi-
tion most be clearly stated 
Is the announcement. 
17. Dr. Kissinger stated he 
did not ease how third per. 
ties might react, so long as 
arillewo.111108-'010 wash.. Po. 
Copy of one of domments given to The Washington Post, 
Ambassador Bush under-
stands what he should say. 
18. Dr. Kissinger said that 
whoever was putting out 
background information re-
lative to the current situa-
tion is provoking Presides-
tial wrath. The President is 
under the "illusion" that he 
is giving instructions; not 
that halo merely being kept 
apprised of affairs as they 
progress. Dr. Kissinger 
asked that this be kept in 
mind. 
IS. Mr. DePalma indi-
cated that he did not yet 
know whether the Security 
Council would be convened 
in the afternoon or evening 
(this date). However, the 
first statementS at the meet-
ing would likely be those by 
the Indians and Palm. He 
suggested that Ambassador 
Bush should be one of the 
first speakers immediately 
following the presentation 
by the two contesting na-
tions. He felt that the im-
pact of our statement would 
be clearer If it were made 
early. Dr. Kissinger voiced 
no objections. 
If. Mr. De Palma asked 
whether we wanted to get 
others lined up with our res. 
elution before we intro-
duced it This, however, 
would take time. Dr. Kissin-
ger suggested rather than 
follow this course, we had 
better submit the resolution 
as thickly as possible, alone 
If necessary. According to 
Dr. Kissinger the only move 
left for us at the present 
time is to make clear Our po-
sition relative to our gammen 
strategy. Everyone knows 
how all this will come out 
and everyone knows that 
India will ultimately occupy 
East Pakistan. We most, 
therefore, make clear our 
position, table our resotu-
don. We want a resolution 
which will be introduced 
With a speech by Ambassa-
dor Bush. If others desire to 
come along with us, fine; 
but in any event we will 
table the resolution with a 
speech by Ambassador 
Bush. 
21, Dr. Kissinger condo-
ued that it was important 
that we register our Posi-
tion. The exercise in the UN 
is likely inks an exercise in 
futility, inasmuch as the So-
viets can be expected to 
veto. The UN, itself, will in 
all probability do little to 
terminate the war. He sum. 
marized the foregoing by 
saying that he assumed that 
our resolution IS the UN 
will be introduced by a 
speech and there will be no 
delay. We will go along in 
general terms with refer-
ence to political accommoda-
tions in East Pakistan but 
we will certainly not imply 
or soggest any specifics. 
such as the release of Mujib 
[Shiekh MujIbur Rahman]. 
22. Dr. Kissinger asked 
how long the Indians could 
delay action In the Council. 
Mn. DePalma said they 
could make long speeches or 
question our purpose. Mr. 
Van Hellen sold that they 
would draw out as thng as 
possible which would allow 
them to concentrate on the 
situation in East Pakistan, 
Mr. DePalma said that they 
could shilly-shally for three 
or four days which, Mn, 
Helms stated, would be long 
enough for them to occupy 
East Pakistan. Mr. DePalma 
stated that we could always 
try to force a vote. Dr. Kis-
singer reiterated that there 
was no chance in getting 
anything useful in the UN. 
23, Mr. DePalma sag. 
gested that in all likelihood 
one side or the other will 
veto. 
24. Concerning the matter 
of economic aid, Dr Kissin-
ger stated that the Presi-
dent had directed that cut-
off was to be directed at 
India only. He Indicated, 
however, that he wanted to 
read the announcement to 
the President on that the lat-
ter would know exactly 
what he might be getting 
into. Al his point Mo. Wil-
liams asked whether some 
mention should be made in 
the statement exptatning 
why aid for Pakistth ie not 
being cut off, Dr. Kissinger 
said that information would 
be kept for background 
only. 
25. Mr. kVilliams said that 
the Department of Agrie. 
ture indicated that the price 
of vegetable all was weaken-
ing in the United States; 
thus cutting off this PL.4130

to India could have reper-
cussions on the domestic 
market He asked, therefore, 
whether all could be 
shipped in place of vheat. 
DT. Kissinger said that he 
will have the answm to that 
by the opening of busIness 
Monday. 
26. Dr. Kissinger then 
asked for a brief ',Mown 
on the military situation. 
Admiral Zumwalt responded 
that he thought the Peke 
could hold the One in East 
Pakistan for approximately 
one or two weeks before the 
logistics problems became

Soviets to cement their posi-

ticipated that the Soviets

3. Summary. Discussion 
was devoted to the massive 
problems facing Bangle 
Desk as a nation. Dr. Kissin-
ger Indicated that the prob. 
lent should be studied now. 
The subject of possible mili-
tary aid to Pakistan is also 
to be examined, but on a 
very close hold basis.' The 
matter of Indian redeploy-
meat from East to West was 
considered as was the legal. 
ity of the current sea "block-
ade" by India. 
4. Mr. Helms opened the 
meeting by briefing the cur. 
rent situation. He stated 
that the Indians had recog-
nixed Bangle Dash and the 
Poke had broken diplomatic 
ties with India. Major tight. 
lug continued in the East 
but India is engaged in a 
holding action in the West. 
Mr. Helms felt that the Indi-
ans will attempt to force a 
decision in the East within 
the next ten days. The Indi. 
ans have almost total air su-
petlority now in the East 
where they can employ ap-
proximately a hundred of 
their aircraft against Pak 
ground forces and logistic 
areas. The Indians, however, 
have not yet broken through 
on the ground in East Paki-
stan. Major thrust of the In. 
dies effort in East Pakistan 
is in the northwest corner of 
the province. The airfield at 
Dacca is all but closed, The 
Indians are registering only 
minor gains in the Jessore 
area, but they claim to have 
taken Kamaipur. In the 
West Indian activity is es-
sentially limited to air at-
tacks. The Paks appear to be 
on the offensive on the 
ground and have bunched 
air strikes in the Punjab. 
Overall, the Paks claim six-
ty-one Indian aircraft de-
stroyed: the Indians claim 
forty-seven Pak planes, In 
naval action one Pak de 
-
strayer has been sunk by 
the Indians and another 
claimed sunk. The Indians 
also claim the sinking 01 000 
Pak submarine In eastern 
waters. Moscow Is Increas-
ingly vocal in its sulthort of 
India and Is not suthorting 
any UN moves to halt the 
fighting. The Chinese press 
made its strongest attack on 
India this morning. 
5. Dr. Kissinger then 
asked for a military assess. 
ment questioning how long 
the Paks might be able to 
hold out in the East. Gen-
eral Westmoreland re-
mended that it might bean 
much as three weeks. 
S. Dr. Kissinger asked 
what is to be done with 
Bangle Deal). Mr. Helms 
stated that for all practical 
Pare0SeS it is now an Info.
Pendent country, recognized 
by India. 
I. Ambassador Johnson 
suggested that the Pak 
armed forces now in East 
Pakistan could be held hos-
tage. General Westmoreland 
reenforced this by noting 
there was no means of ?vac-
lotting Well Pak forces from 
the East Wing, particularly 
in view of Indian naval su-
periority. 
8. Dr Kissinger stated 
that the next state of play 
Will involve deterthning 
our attitude toward the state 
of Bangia Desh. 
S. Mr. Williams referred 
to the one and a half mil-
lion Urdu speaking (Biharl) 
people in East Pakistan who 
could also be held hostage. 
10. Dr. Kissinger asked 
if there had been already 
been some massacre of these 
PeoP19 liss-111999?ew-widet-
t550 he certainly thinks 
1.o. Dr. hissmger 
asked Si we could do any-
thing, to which Mr. Williams 
stated that perhaps an Inter-
national humanitarian effort 
could be launched on their 
behalf. Dr. Kissinger asked 
whether we should be nail. 
lug attention to the Plight 
of these people now. Mr. 
Williams said that most of 
these people were, in fact, 
centered around the rail 
?enters. that they are urban 
dwellers and that some ef-
forts on their behalf might 
now well be started through 
the U.N. Dr. Kissinger stag. 
gested that this be done 
quickly In order to prevent 
a bloodbath. Mr. Slam stated 
that while the U.N. cannot 
do anything on the ground t 
ited from West to East, and 
that it would probably take 
It least a week to move one 
infantry division. It might 
take as much ass month to 
move all or most of the In-
dian forces from the East to 
the West. 
if. Mn, Sisco said that the 
long term presence of In-
dian forces in Bangle Desh 
would have to be addressed. 
Mr. Van Holten remarked 
that should the Indian army 
remain more than two or 
three weeks after the situ. 
tion In East Pakistan is 
wrapped. up they would, in 
fact, become a Hindu army 
of occupation In the eyes of 
the Bengalis. 
17. Mn. Van Holten raised 
the problem of the return of 
the refugees from India. In-
asmuch as Bangle Dash is 
predominately Moslem, the 
return of 10 million ref. 
gees, most of whom are 
Hindu, would present an-
other critical problem. 
18. General Westmoreland 
suggested that the Indian 
position in the West was sot 
unadvantageous. He briefly 
discussed the order of battle 
in West Pakistan and sug-
gested that the Indians were 
in relatively good Shape. He 
said that he expected the 
major Pak effort to be to-
wards Kashmir andt be Pun-
jab. The Indians, he felt, 
will be striking toward 
derabad so as to cut the 
main LOC (line of communi-
cation) to Karachi. He did 
not think that the Indians 
necessarily plan to drive all 
the way to Karachi. He also 
suggested that the ctdrent 
Indian more in that direu 
lion could very well be di-
versionary in order to force 
She Paks to pull reserves 
back from the Kashmir 
IS, Mr. Packard asked 
about the POL (Petroleum 
oil lubricant) supply situat 
lion far Pakistan. Mr. Helms 
said that at the present time 
II looked very bad. The over-
land. LOC's from Iran, for 
example, were very tenuous. 
20. Mr. Williams sug-
gested that the reasons for 
the Indian thrust to the 
south was essentially politi-
cal. Inasmuch as the Indians 
do not want to fight on the 
border they will have to 
give ground in Kashmir. In 
order to ward off parliamen-
tary criticism, Mrs. Gandhi 
may be going for some Pak 
real estate In the South. 
21. Dr. Kissinger Alien 
asked about UN initiatives. 
Mr. Sisof ssid that we Are 
now .eorwin, the bituniion 
with Ambassador Bush Two 
Secnrity Council resolutions 
have been vetoed by the So-
viets. However, there is a 
ground swell building in 
New York for an emergency 
session by the General A. 
sembly to be convened 
under the provisions of the 
"threat to Peace" mech. 
nissn. The crisis could be 
moved into the Assembly 
through a simple majority 
vote. ' 
22. Dr. Kissinger and Mr. 
Slew agreed that any reso-
lution 'introduced:into the 
Gtherait Assembly must res 
; twin tvdo key elements; cease 
fire, and .Withdrawal of mill. 
lacy forces. Dr. Kissinger 
.agreed that our UN delega-
tion has handled the situa-
tion extremely well to date. 
Mr. Sisco said that although 
it is very 'likely that the cri-
sis will be introduced in the 
General Assembly, we roust 
remember that there are 106 
countriesrepresented 
therein and we ean 'expect 
all .sorts of pressures to be 
generated. Mr. DePalma 
suggested that when die re. 
-elution is in the 
Assembly there will be a 
new twist, i.e.; the Indians 
will berm longer terribly in-
terested in politiest accom-
modation. By that time that 
Issue will have ceased to be 
O problem. 
33. Mr. DePalma said that 
a Council meeting was 
.heduled for three-thirty 
today-and at that time we 
could try to get the Council 
to let go of the issue in 
order do transfer it to the 
'Assembly. it being quite ob-
vious. that we are not going 
to get a cease fire through 
Ike Security Council, 
24. Dr. Kissinger asked if 
we could expect he General 
Assembly to get the Issue by 
the end of the day, to which 
Mr. DePalma replied that 
hopefully this will be the 
CaSe. 
25. Dr. Kissinger said that 
we will go with essentially 
the same speech in the Gen-
eral Assembly as was made 
in the Security Council, but 
he would like something Pet 
in about refugees and the 
text of our resolution. 
26. Dr. Kissinger also di-
rected that henceforth we 
show a certain coolness to 
the Indians; the Indian Am-
bassador is not lobe treated 
allot high a level. 
27. Dr. Kissinger then 
asked about a legal position 
concerning the currnat In-
dian naval "blockade." Mr. 
Sisco stated that on lave

still an undeclared war, with 
Roe Indians claiming power

situation through the Gen-
eral Assembly. 
11. Mr. Williams referred 
to the 300,000 Bengalis in 
West Pakistan, and that they 
v ere in some jeopardy. Mr. 
Siam odd that this hutment 
-Klan issue could be a very 
atttractive one for the Ge. 
sl Assembly and that we 
would begin to focus on 
Assembly action. Mr. Mao-
Donald cited as a possible 
precedent the mass move. 
went of population from 
North Vietnam in 1954 
12. Returning to the oil' 
01551 picture, Mr. Williams 
stated that he felt that the 
orimasy thrust of the Indian 
army would be interdict 
Chittagong and cut off any 
supply capability still exist-
ing for the Poke in the East. 
He said that he felt that the 
major thrust of the Indian 
army In the East would be 
to destroy the Pak regular 
lathes. He felt that a major 
lob would be to restore or-
Cer. within the East Inas] 
much as it will be faced 
with a massacre as great on 
any we have faced in the 
twentieth century. 
13. (thneral Westmore] 
land suggested that the In. 
Mans would probably need 
ftree or four divisions to 
continue to work with the 
Mukti HAIM: the remainder 
would be pulled out to as. 
Oil the Indian forces In the 
West. 
14. Mr. Siam opined that 
the Indians would pull out 
most of their troops once 
the Pak threes are disarmed, 
inasmuch as the Indians will 
be working with a very 
friendly population: thus. 
they will turn the military 
efforts over to the MAK 
Bahini as quickly as possi-
ble. He felt that the extent 
and timing of Indian with. 
drawal from East Pakistan 
would depend to a large de-
gree on developments in the 
West. 
15. In response to a ques. 
tion. General Westmoreland 
stated that Indian transpor-
tation capabilities were lb. 
to exercise their rights of 
beligerency. State would 
however, prepare a Path, no 
the legal aspects of the 
Issue, Ambassador Johnson 
said that so far as he was 
concerned the Indians had 
no legal positthn to assert a 
blockade. 
28. Dr. Kissinger asked that 
a draft protest be drawn UP. 
If we considered it Illegal, 
we will makes formal diplo. 
made protest. Mr. Sin. said 
that he would prepare such 
a protest. 
29 Dr. Kissinger then 
asked whether we have the 
right to authorize Jordth or 
Saudi Arabia to -transfer 
military equipment to Paki-
stan. Mr. Van Holten staled 
the United States cannot 
permit a third country to 
transfer arms which we 
have provided them when 
we, ourselves, do not author-
ize sale direct to the alit 
mate recipient, such as Paki-
stan. As of last January we 
made a legislative decision 
not to sell to Pakistan. Mr. 
&ace said that the Jerdent 
ans would be wbakening 
their own position by such a 
transfer and would probably 
be grateful if we could get 
them off the hook. Mr. Sisco 
went on to say that as the 
Paks increasingly feel the 
heat we will be getting 
emergency requests f rom 
them. 
30. Dr. Kissinger said that 
the President may ward to 
honor those requests. The 
matter has not been 'Kellett 
to presidential attention but 
it Is quite obvious that the 
President is not inclined to 
let the Paks be defected. 
Mr. Packard then said that 
we should look at what 
could be done. Mr. Since 
agreed but said it should be 
done very quietly. Dr. Kis-
singer indicated he would 
like a paper by tomorrow (7 
Dec). 
31, Mn, Sisco suggested 
that what we are really in-
terested in are what sup-
plies and equipment could 
be made available, and the 
modes of delivery of this 
equipment. He stated that 
from a political point of 
view our efforts would have . 
to directed at keeping the ' 
Indians from "extinguish-
ing" West Pakistan. 
32. Dr. Kissinger turned 
to the matter of aid and re-
quested that henceforth let 
lees of credit not be made 
irrevokable. Mr. Williams 
stated that we have 
gentled general economic 
aid. not formally commttted, 
to itolla which redints 
Iced l to $10.9141. (lc sug-
gested that what we have 
done for Pakistan 01 the 
same category does not be] 
come contentious inasmuch 
as the Indians are now mo-
bilizing all development aid 
for use in the war effort, 
whereas remaining sod for 
East Pakistan is essentially 
earmarked for fertilizer and 
humantarian relief. A ease 
can be rade technically, pa' 
tidally and legally that 
there is a difference be-
tween the aid given India 
and that given to Pakistah 
33, Dr. Kissinger said to 
make sure that when talk. 
log about cutoff of aid for 
India to emphasize what is 
cut off and not on what is 
being continued. 
34. Dr. Kissinger then 
asked about evacuation. Mr. 
Slaw said that the Dacca 
evacuation had been abort 
ed. 
35, Dr. Kissinger Inquired 
about a nossible famine in 
East Pakistan. Mr. Williams 
said that we will not have 
a massive problem at this 
time. but by next thring 
this witl quite likely be the 
case. Dr. Kissinger asked 
whether we will be an-
nealed to to bail out Bangle 
Desh. Mr. IVIlliams sald 
that the problem would not 
be terribly great If we could 
continue to fannel 140 tons 
of food a month through 
Chittagong. but at this time 
nothing is moving,. He fur-
ther. servo-Med that Bangle

Three Crucial Dates' 
MUSKIE, From Al 
panion and Muskie neighbor 
at Kennebunk Beach, and 
long-time Muskie aides and 
advisers Berl Bernhard, Ge-
orge Mitchell, Don Nicoll 
and Milton Semen 
As always, Muskie did lit-
tle talking, but went around 
the room asking each man's 
views. Harriman was first, 
and he declared the Presi-
dent Nixon's methods would 
backfire, that Muskie should 
pick a few issues and stick 
to those but make a deter-
mined, nearly open run for 
the top office. By all means, 
he should run. 
"I'm an old man, and I 
tion't want to die with 
Richard Nixon in the White 
House," said the 78-year-old 
patriarch of the party. 
There was general agree-
ment Mr. Nixon was vulner-
able and that Muskie was 
the one Democrat with the 
stature and credibility to 
make the liberal position 
make sense in opposition. 
But prior to the 1972 race, 
Muskie was faced with seek-
ing re-election to the Senate 
in November, 1970. There 
was much discussion of the 
proper blend of the presi-
dential buildup with the si-
multaneous Senate race in 
Maine. 
Characteristically cau-
tious, Muskie was reluctant 
to go very for down the trail 
leading to the White House. 
After nearly three hours of 
talk, Clark Clifford, who 
likes to speak last, summed 
up the consensus. Some first 
steps toward staffing the 
presidential drive should 
now begin, but quietly and 
slowly at first. 
"You don't have to decide 
everything today. There is 
lots of time," Clifford de-
clared. 
Muskie made no commit-
ment at the close of the 
meeting, but it was clear to 
everyone that a bridge was 
being crossed. It was agreed 
that Muskie would institu-
tionalize his effort to ex-
plore the presidential bid, 
opening the first s m a 11 
downtown office as a staff 
center for this purpose and 
raising funds to support a 
growing exploration.

presidential drive was trans-
ferred to a new account am-
biguously labeled "Muskie 
Election Committee" (which 
might refer to Maine or to 
the nation at large.) From 
this day forward, the Mus-
kie presidential campaign 
was scarcely ever in doubt. 
Whatever his disclaimers 
(usually accompanied by 2 
grin), he was off and run-
ning. 
It was a long and often 
rocky trail that brought the 
shy son of a Polish immi-
grant tailor from Rumford, 
Maine, to a starting gate po-
sition as the favorite for the 
Democratic presidential 
nomination in 1972. Like the 
political path of many 
American leaders, the Mus-
kie trail includes many acci-
dental turns, some detours 
and a considerable number 
of lucky breaks. 
A mere glance at the sur-
face facts demonstrate that 
this is an extraordinary can-
didacy in many respects. 
According to the tradi-
tional wisdom of American 
politics, the Democratic 
Party would be most 
unlikely to choose as its 1972 
standard-bearer a Roman 
Catholic from a predomi 
nantly Republican state in a 
far corner of the nation, a 
state with only four elec-
toral votes and no city over 
65.000 population. 
Moreover, Muskie is nei-
ther rich nor the favorite of 
the rich; until four years 
ago he was virtually un-
known to most Americans; 
he has no interest group 
(such as organized labor) en-
thusiastically behind him. 
He has little experience in 
foreign affairs and, except 
for some reputation as a pol-
lution fighter, is not widely 
known for any particular ac-
complishment or political 
stand. 
In a sense, he is every-
body's candidate and no-
body's candidate. There are 
few strong objections to him 
from any segment of the 
Democratic Party or voting 
public, but there are also 
few ,enthusiastic backers. 
Muskie's chief assets now 
are the absence of powerful 
rivals, his understated per-
sonality that projects a spe-
cial serenity and decency 
through the powerful politi-
cal instrument of television, 
and the widespread impres-
sion that his appeal would 
be likely to unite most fac-
tions of the Democratic 
Party and simultaneously 
deny Mr. Nixon the support 
For Release

of the independent "ticket-
splitter," votes the Presi-
dent must have to will a sec-
ond term in the White 
House. 
Whether all this will en-
dure or perish in the con-
frontations of the primaries 
and beyond is an unanswer-
able question. But as of 
today Muskie seems to have 
first crack at the Demo-
cratic nomination. If he can 
maintain his appeal to 
Americans when they come 
to know him better, he is 
likely to be nominated?and 
would he a very serious 
threat to Mr. Nixon this 
November. 
As national leaders go, Ed-
mund Sixtus Muskie started 
late. Born in 1934, he was a 
virtually unknown small 
town lawyer until age 40, 
when he was elected 
Maine's first Democratic 
governor in two decades. In 
that year (1954), Richard 
Nixon was vice president of 
the United States. Hubert 
Humphrey was a controver-
sial and well known U.S. 
senator and Henry M. Jack-
son was taking a prominent 
role in the Senate hearings 
on Joseph McCarthy after 
more than a dozen years in 
Congress. 
After two terms as gover-
nor, Muskie came to Wash-
ington in 1953 as the first 
Democratic senator from 
Maine in nearly half a cen-
tury. He was a quiet, uncon-
troversial, hard-working sen-
ator, well-liked and re-
spected within the institu-
tion but little known out-
side. 
Muskie's first natio nal 
fling was in 1964, and it was 
both modest and synthetic. 
He was facing a re-election 
campaign in Maine that fall, 
and staff aides thought it 
would do him some good at 
home to be mentioned as a 
possible vice presidential 
running mate for President 
Johnson. The aides spread 
the word that Muskie was 
the logical choice, because 
of his ethnic background 
and New England regional 
aiipeal. Johnson never seri-
ously considered him, but 
Muskie's name was often 
mentioned in press specula-
tion. 
Muskie's big chance came 
when Hubert Humphrey 
chose him as the Democratic 
vice presidential nominee in 
1968. Muskie did not cam-
paign for the job; Hum-
phrey picked him largely be-
cause no faction of the party 
objected to him, he was

Decision 
compatible us le s  
compatible personally and 
politically, and yet had a 
contrasting and appealing 
style. 
"I went for the quiet 
man," Humphrey said later. 
"I know I talk too much.,. 
two Hubert Humphreys 
might be one too many." 
During the fall campaign, 
Muskie's "cool" approach 
won him much acclaim as a 
welcome contrast to all 
three men sharing the na-
tional tickets ? Humphrey, 
Nixon and Spiro Agnew. 
Democratic Party planners 
and the press gave Muskie 
unusual attention as a coun-
terpoint to Agnew, who was 
considered the weak link in 
the GOP ticket. Muskie 
emerged from the campaign 
well known and well liked, 
and there had been kindled 
in his mind the weighty am. 
bition known in Washington 
as "presidential fever." 
The man from Maine 
traveled widely in early 1969, 
making 57 speeches in 22 
states in the first three 
months of the year to test 
his charm. By summer, he 
was discouraged. People 
were cordial and he was 
welcome, but he received lit-
tle press attention and the 
polls showed Ted Kennedy 
far ahead as the first choice 
of Democrats for the next 
presidential nod. 
Muske had come close to 
giving up when the accident 
at Chappaquiddick changed 
everything. By the fall of 
1969. Muske was convinced 
that Kennedy was:out of the 
race. , 
The Jan. 4, 1970, meeting 
with his advisors confirmed 
Muskie's determination to 
make a serious bid for the 
Democratic nomination. 
That spring, the downtown 
office was opened to pre-
pare for a national race, and 
later that year Muskie hired 
Robert Squier as his televi-
sion consultant, ostensibly 
for the Maine senate cam-
paign that fall. 
Once again, it was televi-
sion that propelled Muskie 
into a national leadership 
position. On election eve, 
President Nixon chose to 
purchase 15 minutes on na-
tionwide TV to make a par-
tisan "law and order" appeal 
for Republican candidates in 
the' form of a political rally 
speech he had given several 
days earlier in Phoenix. It 
was a scratchy and unpro-
fessional tape and an appeal 
that seemed narrow and un-
presidential. 
After the Democrats 
learned that Mr. Nixon was 
buying time, party leaders 
chose Muskie to give a 
reply. The Muskie answer, a 
fireside chat from Maine 
written in part by veteran 
ghostwriter Dick Goodwin, 
conveyed a low key yet ring-
ing indignation. Even Re-
publicans conceded that the 
back-to-back political ap-
peals constituted a grave 
setback for the President 
and a triumph for Muskie. 
The President's poll 
ratings dropped. Muskie's 
jumped. Easily re-elected to 
the Senate, he had been 
given a major boost toward 
his party's nomination. 
Still, Muskie was a man of 
caution. Some of his advis-
ers urged him to "put the 
heat on" early in 1971 to try 
to sew up commitments for 
the Democratic nomination. 
The senator decided other-
wise. He felt his popularity 
after the election eve per-
formance might be a passing 
thing; he didn't feel he had 
the organization in place or 
the financial backing in 
place to move quickly. 
Instead, he went to the 
Middle East, the Soviet 
Union and Europe to build 
his foreign policy creden-
tials and continued his 
slowly growing effort to win 
support. 
Last summer and fall, Mr. 
Nixon made a political come-
back with his wage-price 
freeze, his newsmaking 
opening to China and other 
surprising actions. And in 
September, Muskie made a 
costly political slip in Los 
Angeles, where he told a 
meeting of black leaders 
that he did not believe the 
American people would vote 
for a ticket with a black as 
the vice presidential candi-
date. Mr. Nixon called Mus-
kie's remark "a libel on the 
American people," and the 
senator's Democratic rivals, 
who had been buildings 
strength in 1971, began to 
exploit it. 
THE WASHINGTON 
Wednesday, Jan. 5, 192 
POST \ 
A7 
Yesterday Muskie for-
mally joined the race for 
the Democratic nomination. 
He has the generally ac-
knowledged front-runner 
but was by no means a sure 
winner. Like many experi-
enced politicians. Muskie has 
a fatalistic streak in rum, an 
inner voice that reminds 
him that nobody can predict 
the breaks and whatever 
will be, will be. 
"You work hard and you 
get some breaks and you try 
to build some momentum," 
the senator mused yester-
day. He worked hard on the 
announcement speech for 
television and if that goes 
over well?he said he had 
an idea that it would?it 
should help. Whatever hap-
pens, he has nothing to lose 
?he never planned that he 
would spend decades in poli-
tics, and he certainly never 
planned at the beginning 
that he'd have a chance to 
be President. 
He has prepared himself 
as well as he knows how, 
and now is ready for the 
trail ahead. "Whether or not, 
I can really meet the test of 
the presidency I don't sup-
pose I would know unless I 
were elected to that office," 
he told Maine newsmen in 
Portland yesterday. "But by 
the end of the campaign sea-
son, I ought to have a better 
idea?and the country ought 
to have a better idea. That's 
what a campaign is all 
about. 
McGovern Enters Primary in N.H. 
Sen. George S. McGovern 
(D-S.D.) formally entered the 
New Hampshire presidential 
primary yesterday, promising 
front-runner Sen. Edmund S. 
Muskie (D-Maine) a "very. 
very tough fight" in the March 
7 contest. 
"I'm not under any illusion 
it will be easy to pull a Mc-
Govern landslide in the state 
where Ed Muskie is right next 
door," McGovern said in Con-
cord, N.H. "But I don't con-
cede him this state or any 
other. I think we're going to 
do very well." 
MeGovern's New Hampshire 
backers, who have been organ-
izing for the fight since early 
last year, filed petitions with 
about 2,000 signatures to place 
his name on the ballot. 
Muskie is scheduled to file 
here on Thursday. Sen. Vance 
Hartke of Indiana filed yester-
day and Los Angeles Mayor 
Sam Yorty's supporters are to

file Thursday. That will com-
plete the four-man field vying 
for 18 Democratic convention 
delegates and the psychologi-
cal advantage of winning the 
first primary. 
Polls taken in New Hamp-
shire last year gave Muskie 
anywhere from 3-to-1 to 5-to-1 
margins over McGovern, with 
almost half of the voters pre-
ferring other candidates or un-
decided. No polls on the 
Hartke and Yorty strength 
have surfaced. ! 
Meanwhile, Endicott Pea-
body, former governor. of Mas-
sachusetts who announced last 
week he will run for vice pres-
ident, filed his nomination pa-
pers yesterday in the New 
Hampshire Democratic pri-
mary. "I am running fpr the 
vice presidency," he said, "be-
cause it is time that the peo-
ple had a say in who should be 
elected to the second most im-
portant public office in the 
land." 
, In Tilton, N.H., Rep. Paul 
McCloskey (R-Calif.) charged 
that President Nixon is pursu-
ing the bombing of North 
Vietnam to keep the South Vi-
etnamese government from 
. falling until after the 1972 
' U.S. elections. 
He told a high school audi-
ence, "President Nixon insists 
that we continue to prevent 
: the unification of Vietnam." 
In Columbus, Ohio, Sen. 
Robert Taft (R-Ohio) an-
nounced that he is withdraw-
ing as a favorite-son candidate 
for President and now hopes a 
unified delegation pledged to 
President Nixon will be cho-
sen from that state. 
In Miami, Rep. Shirley 
Chisholm (D-N.Y.) began a 5-
day campaign tour by telling 
University of Miami students 
that "domestic war will break 
out in this country unless the 
Vietnam conflict is soon 
ended." Mrs. Chisholm, who is 
expected to announce her can-
41.1.???????

didacy for the Democratic 
presidential nomination soon, 
said. "Vietnam is being esca-
lated and the American people 
are wondering what hap-
pened." 
Also touring Florida yester-
day was Sen. Henry M. Jack-
son (D-Wash.), who predicted 
that retention of Vice Presi-
dent Spiro T. Agnew on the 
Republican ticket this year will 
be an asset to Democrats in 
November. 
He said many positions 
taken by Agnew "are state-
ments in over-kill and will 
work adversely on the Nixon 
administration." He also pre-
dicted that Southerners will 
not "throw their vote away" by 
casting ballots for Alabama 
Gov. George C. Wallace. Wal-
lace has indicated he will enter 
the Florida primary and ob-
severs there believe he would 
run strong in the northern con-
gressional districts that Jack-
son hopes to carry.

By TOM WICKER 
The retnarkable series of documen-
tary excerpts now being published by 
-ethe columnist Jack Anderson is a pub-
Ilc of the first order. Since 
4the authenticity of these documents 
Alas not been denied by an obviously 
.discomfited White House, they pro-
..vide a valuable glimpse into the mak-
-Ing of policy?in this case, a policy 
_that to many Americans seems disas-
trous.. 
- More than that, the Anderson papers 
"uggest the extent to which the Gov-
ernment can, and does, mislead the 
public in the pursuit of what the 
'resident and his advisers may de-
' ilde is the national interest. They 
'-show again the abundant use of secu-
iity classification to keep the public 
In ignorance. And they demonstrate 
that publication is one of the few re-
inaining checks on the foreign policy 
' pbwers of the imperial Presidency. 
The papers make one thing per-
fectly clear?that President Nixon, 
with the aid of Dr. Henry Kissinger, 
let-Out deliberately to put the United 
States Into a position of support for 
Pakistan at whatever cost. "We are 
not trying to be even-handed," said 
Dr. Kissinger to high Administration 
officials. 
- That might have been a proper 
course for a nation opposing, say, 
Hitler's expansionism. In the complex 
situation on the Indian subcontinent, 
Pakistan's obvious weakness?if noth-
.ing else?made self-defeating a policy 
of all-out opposition to India. That the 
brutal excesses of Pakistani repression 
of the Bengalis was overlooked, to the 
point where all aid to India was to be? 
suspended while clandestine means of 
rating the Paks were sought, is sim-
-*Ply repugnant to the American con-
:adience?or ought to be. 
Besides, nobody in Washington both-
ered to make clear to the public that 
'Washington was not being "even-
'banded." Thus its condemnation of 
India sounded more like a considered, 
fair analysis than a deliberate, pur-
poseful policy; and that is the kind of 
-Avatnpy ground in which credibility 
'gaps are dug. 
That is even more true of the in-
stance documented by Mr. Anderson 
in which Dr. Kissinger and others 
sought to transfer to Pakistan arms 
-already delivered to Jordan?while 
-maintaining the public posture that 
arms were not being supplied to either 
Varticipant in the war! That is entirely 
worthy of the men who brought you 
`..le-enforced protective reaction." 
So was the public pretense that an 
'American carrier task force in the Bay 
of Bengal was there to evacuate threat-
ApprevtleilkottsRVIetaget2130(1q111/01 
Ieged in the Anderson papers) that its 
IN THE NATION 
actual mission was to divert Indian 
ships and planes and thus to weaken 
the Indian drive against East Pakistan. 
Nor do the various stories now being 
advanced to explain these and other 
Administration actions seem to hold 
much water. If, for instance, the task 
force actually was there to stop India 
from overrunning West Pakistan, too, 
as Administration leaks now suggest, 
nothing in India's actual behavior 
toward West Pakistan seems to have 
warranted such action; nor is it likely 
that one carrier task force could have 
been so effective a deterrent; and, in 
any case, the American people still 
were being misled about the deploy-
ment of their forces. 
And if, as other articles have sug-
gested, Mr. Nixon's intent really was 
to solidify an American alignment with 
China, also a supporter of Pakistan, 
against the Soviet Union, the curious 
results are that Soviet power on the 
subcontinent is vastly extended, as a 
result, and American influence hi India 
Is at lowest ebb. If we now are closer 
to China than we were, what sugges-
tion was there in their acrimonious 
history that Peking and Moscow were 
likely to be soon reconciled? In order 
to gain face in China, did we really 
need to lose our shirts in India? 
Thus, behind the facade of secrecy 
and security which shields so much 
of the Government's purposes and ac-
tivities in the world, a policy that was 
dubious at best was shaped to Mr. 
Nixon's personal dictates, and pre-
sented to the public as something other 
than what it was. But the valuable 
documents Mr. Anderson has been 
publishing must have been supplied to 
him by someone with access to them 
who believed either that that manner 
of making policy, or the policy itself, 
or both, ought to be exposed to the 
American people. 
How else could that be done, except 
by publication? And if it is to be main-
tained, as the Nixon Administration 
did in the Pentagon Papers case, that 
stamping "Top Secret" on the Govern-
ment's memos and minutes makes 
them immune to publication and su-
perior to the First Amendment, then 
security classification becomes an all-
encompassing means of concealing 
whatever the Government wants to 
conceal. 
It took years for someone to chal-
lenge that arrogant privilege, in the 
case of the Vienam war; but it has 
happened much more quickly in the 
India-Pakistan case. Maybe the Gov-
ernment is now finding its own offi-

Arabs Disagree on War Renewal 
By Jack Anderson 
Egypt s 01110 attaelS 
Tulel,-And has ?tad Asso-
ciates, "I would not expect too 
1680 from the Egyptians." lte 
added fiercely that the Egyp-
tians "will never again pull 
us into a war and leave utij 
the lurch." 
' Next time, he !Ede _Ire-
ans will be ready. 'When3he 
blow comes," he said, 
"whether Egypt or Israel 
startS it first, we will seize the 
opportunity and fight." 
The secret intelligence re-
? ort, telling of Asad's conver-
ation, emphasized that he 
sed the Arabia word 
lamm a" which means 
'when," not "if." 
His army chief, Gen. Mus-
tafa Tales, is also quoted in 
the secret cable as telling his 
military colleagues tersely; 
"There is no other choice. We 
must fight and we will fight." 
He acknowledged that "all 
the Arabs combined are 
weaker than Israel." But he 
vowed the Syrians, at least, 
would fight anyway "if not to 
gain a victory, at least to keep 
the war case hot between us 
and Israel." 
As he put it: "If the Arabs 
had continued to fight Israel 
after their successive defeats 
in 1948, 1956 and 1967, rather 
than turning their backs in de-
feat, many world leaders would 
have changed their policies" 
toward the Arab-Israeli dis-
pute. 
Military Moves 
Significantly, Syrian troops 
and armor have been spotted 
moving "through Damascus 
heading south," and the Syri-
ans are reported to be "seri-
ously preparing for new hostil-
ities with Israel." 
The Egyptians, meanwhile, 
have been shouting the loud-
est about resuming the war. 
But in private, Gen. Mahmud 
Tuharai, the Egyptian-army's 
operations chief has told inti-
mates that "any major at-
tempt at crossing the Suez 
Canal is bound to fail." 
Declares a secret cable: "Tu-
hami said that President 
Anwar Sadat, when threaten-
ing Israel with an all-out war, 
was bluffing and ... informed 
the army of this.",, 
Tuhami suggested that the 
army might "carry out small-
scale commando attacks" but 
that these raids "would be 
carefully controlled so as not 
to cause over-reaction from 
the Israelis." 
The Egyptian high com-
mand, he said, was "very con-
cerned that Israel would take 
advantage of Sadat's threats 
to carry out a preemptive 
strike which would destroy 
the Egyptian army and air 
force." 
The U.S. has renewed its 
efforts, meanwhile to set-
tle the Arab-Israeli dispute at 
the truce table rather than the 
battlefield. American diplo-
mats have spread the word, ac-
cording to a secret report, that 
"we could not be complacent 
about future Egyptian military 
moves if no political progress 
is achieved." 
Footnote: The Syrians belit-
tle the Egyptians in private 
but fight with the Jordanians 
in the open. Yet an intelli-
gence cable quotes President 
Asad as commenting wryly 
"that perhaps the Syrian 
army would find itself along-
side the Jordan Arab army as 
the only two armies which 
would fight Israel fiercely."

Secret Minutes Dispute Kissinger 
By Jack Anderson 
We can now document fro 
secret White House minutes 
our charge that presidential 
braintruster Henry Kissinger 
lied to reporters when he told 
them the Nixon administration 
wasn't anti-India. 
Contrary to Kissinger's 
statement to the press, the 
minutes show that President 
N4c0n not only ordered a pro-
Pakistan policy but became fu-
rionp with his subordinates for 
not taking a stronger stand 
against India. 
"I am getting hell every half 
hour from the Presj.dent that 
we are not being tough 
enough on India," complained 
Kissinger at the Dec. 3 strat-
egy session. 
Three days later, accordin 
to the minutes, Kissinge 
"directed that hencefort 
we show a certain coolness t 
the Indians. The Indian am 
bassador is not to be treate 
at too high a level." 
The India-Pakistani conflict 
was reviewed almost daily by 
a crisis team known as the 
Washington Special Action 
Group. Here's a typical ex-
cerpt from the secret minutes 
for Dec. 4: 
"Mr. Helms (the CIA direc-
tor) opened the meeting by in-
dicating that the Indians were 
currently engaged in a no-
holds-barred attack of East 
Pakistan and that they had 
crossed the border on all 
sides ... Although not decree-
ing a formal declaration of 
war, President Yahya has 
stated that 'the final war with 
India is upon us' . . . 
"Dr. Kissinger remarked 
that if the Indians have an-
nounced a full scale invasion, 
this fact must be reflected in 
our U.N. statement. 
"Mr. Helms indicated that 
we do not know who started 
the current action ... 
"Dr. Kissinger requested 
that by Monday the CIA pre-
pare an account of who did 
what to whom and when. 
"Mr. DePalma (Assistant 
State Secretary) suggested 
that if we refer to the Indian 
declaration in our discussion 
in the UN, that we almost cer-
tainly will have te refer to re-
marks by Yahya. 
he was under specific instruc-
tions from the President, and 
either someone in the bu-
reaucracy would have to pre-
pare this statement along the 
lines indicated or that it 
would be done in the White 
House. 
Kissinger's Semantics 
"Dr. Kissinger asked 
whether the Indians have 
stated anything to the effect 
that they were in an all-out 
war. 
"Mr. Helms said that the 
terminology was 'no holds 
barred.' 
"Dr. Kissinger asked what 
the Paks have said. Mr. Helms 
said the terminology was final 
war with India.' Dr. Kissinger 
suggested this was not an 
objectionable term. It did not 
seem outrageous for the Paks 
to say they were trying to de-
fend themselves ..." 
Later in the meeting, Kissin-
ger instructed: "On AID mat-
ters, the President wants to 
proceed against India only." 
The secret minutes of the 
December 8 meeting shed 
"Dr. Kissinger replied_that. more light on this: 
"Dr. Kissinger emphasized 
that the President has made it 
clear that no further foreign 
exchange, (surplus) commodi-
ties or development loans 
could be assigned to India 
without approval of the White 
House. 
"Mr. Williams (Deputy AID 
Director) stated there was no 
problem of anything sliding 
through. 
"Dr. Kissinger inquired 
what the next turn of the 
screw might be. 
"Mr. Williams said that the 
only other possible option was 
taking a position concerning 
AID material currently under 
contract. This, however, would 
be a very messy problem inas-
much as we would be dealing 
with irrevokable letters of 
credit... 
"Dr. Kissinger stated that 
current orders are not to put 
anything in the budget for 
India. It was also not to be 
leaked that - AID had put 
money in the budget for India 
only to have the 'wicked' 
White House take it out."

Jack Anderson  
Peace Prospects 
In Indochina War 
THERE IS a glimmer of 
hope that the outbreak of 
fighting in Indochina may be 
followed by serious negotia-
tions for peace. 
Intelligence reports claim 
that Communist cadres have 
been alerted to expect a pro-
longed ceasefire and peace 
negotiations. 
The military step-up in 
Laos, Cambodia and South 
Vietnam just possibly could 
be a Communist maneuver to 
Improve their bargaining po-
sition. 
But the intelligence ex- " 
perts are skeptical. Cautions 
a secret Intelligence Informa-
tion Cable: 
"It seems doubtful that 
(Hanoi) is actually consider-
ing the declaration of such a 
ceasefire. (Hanoi) may, how-
ever, be considering a 'de 
facto' ceasefire and be using 
the argument. . .to make the 
current VC situation more 
palatable to the lower level 
cadres and to rebuild their 
morale." 
The ground fighting in all 
three countries, meanwhile, 
has been intensified. Intelli-
gence reports contain 
guarded hints that the Viet-
cong may attempt another 
limited Tet offensive in 
South Vietnam at the end of 
the month. 
But the most serious mili-
tary threat is aimed at Laos. 
Prime Minister Souvanna 
Phouma, in desperation, 
called for American bombers, 
including giant B-52s, to slow 
the enemy advance. 
The request was forwarded 
by McMurtrie Godley, the 
American ambassador, to the 
Pentagon. Adm. Thomas 
Moorer, the Joint Chiefs 
chairman, approved a B-52 
strike and submitted his rec-
ommendation in a top-secret 
memo to Defense Secretary 
Laird. 
"Ambassador Godley has 
requested a B-52 strike . . ." 
wrote Moorer. "The proposed 
target area has been identi-
fied as a major istkWed 
complex which wil d used 
to support life new enemy 
units now moving west...All 
source intelligence has re-
vealed a significant increase 
in enemy activity in the tar-
get area..." 
The raid, identified by the 
code name "Arc Light," was 
okayed. The returning B-52 
crews reported that their 
bombs caused 'six secondary 
explosions." 
Fighter-bombers also began 
hitting targets in Laos. But 
the North Vietnamese unex-
pectedly struck back with an-
tiaircraft missiles and Mig-21 
fighter planes. 
The United States, in re-
turn, retaliated by sending 
. _ 
waves of bombers over North 
Vietnam. (We had reported a 
year ago that the Pentagon 
was keeping its contingency 
plans updated for bombing 
the North.) 
It is evident that fighting 
escalates much easier than 
negotiating. 
Flood Warning 
EARLY 0 N E Saturday 
morning last August the peo-
ple of Bound Brook, N.J., 
awoke and saw the sunshine. 
The heavy rains from hurri-
cane Doria had apparently 
passed; a crisis had been 
avoided. 
Hours later the waters 
were six feet high along Main 
Street in Bound Brook. 
Scores of businesses and 
homes, including Mayor Sam 
Patullo's dry cleaning store, 
were wiped out. Rising rap-
idly and without warning, 
flood waters from the Green-
brook River cost the small 
town $17 million in damages. 
Luckily no lives were lost. 
The scene in Bound Brook 
is not unusual. Each year 
floods strike hundreds of un-
preNit totem-unities, driv-
ing 75,00if Americans from 
their homes and causing $1 
billion worth of property 
damage. 
But, for Bound Brook at 
least, the next time the 
floods come the citizens can 
expect to be prepared. The 
National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration 
(NOAA) plans to install a 
simple inexpensive device up-
stream that will alert local 
officials that the Greenbrook 
River is rising. 
The fail-safe flood alert 
system, which costs only 
about $2,500, operates like a 
bulb in a toilet tank. The rap-
idly rising currents trigger a 
small sensor which is con-
nected to a telephone line. 
Once the sensor is triggered, 
sirens will go off almost in-
stantaneously in the police 
station in nearby Plainfield. 
Originally, NOAA planned 
to place 100 of these new 
small units in flood-prone 
areas around the country, but 
budget cutbaeks have forced 
the government to Alva 
units in only a dozen areas 
along the Eastern Seaboard. 
Footnote: J-Tec Associates, 
a small Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 
firm specializing in environ-
mental instruments, helped 
develop and build the new 
flood-control devices. On J-
Tec's board is engineer Ed

trospective younger brother,

oceanography and eavirop-

U.S., U.N. Damaged by Indian Blitz 
*- By Jack Anderson White House? strategy session chimed in CIA. director Rich-
Pakistan wasn't the only 
oser of the bloody, two-week 
mar over BangladeSh. The In-
Ilan blitz also badly damaged 
seppwo bigger victims. 
We have already shown 
from the secret White House 
Papers that the United States 
suffered a strategic defeat. 
Thanks to President Nixon's 
bungling, Russia has emerged 
as India's partner, and the 
United States is out in the cold 
on the Indian subcontinent. 
The other big loser is the 
United Nations, which failed 
dismally to keep the peace be-
tween India and Pakistan. The 
U.N.'s impotence, as it groped 
for an international consensus 
to end the struggle, caused 
President Nixon's foreign pol-
icy adviser, Henry Kissinger, 
to blurt at a secret White 
House meeting: 
"If the U.N. can't operate in 
this kind of situation effec-
tively, its utility has come to 
an end, and it is useless to 
think of U.N. guarantees in 
the Middle East." 
America's U.N. Ambassador, 
+George? Bush, suggested in one 
secret report that Secretary 
General U Thant's ineffective-
ness might be attributed to 
"physical strain due to his re-
cent illness." But Kissinger 
put the matter more bluntly 
by calling the U.N. wrangle a 
"farce." 
Kissinger made clear his 
contempt for the U.N. at a 
on Dec. 4. 
"We will have difficulty in 
the U.N.," suggested Samuel 
DePalma, the State Depart-
ment's specialist in interna-
tional organizations, "because 
most of the countries who 
might go with us do not want 
to tilt toward Pakistan to the 
extent we do." 
"We have told the Paks we 
would make our statement," 
replied Kissinger. "Let's go 
ahead and put in our own 
statement anyway regardless 
of what other countries want 
to do. We need now to make 
our stand clear even though it 
has taken us two weeks of fid-
dling." 
Kissinger's Comments 
The secret minutes con-
tinue: "Dr. Kissinger (said) it 
was important that we register 
our position. The exercise in 
the U.N. is likely to be an ex-
ercise in futility, inasmuch as 
the Soviets can be expected to 
veto. The U.N. itself, will in 
all probability do little to ter-
minate the war." 
At this point, Kissinger de-
clared: "Nothing will happen 
at the Security Council be-
cause of Soviet vetoes. The 
whole thing is a farce." 
"The Soviet tactic will be to 
stall, as they do not want a 
cease-fire yet," agreed Christo-
pher Van Haien, another 
State Department expert. 
DePalma said the Winn 
"could shilly-shally for three 
or four days"?long enough, 
ard Helms, "for them to occu-
py East Pakistan. 
Footnote: When Indian 
troops threatened Dacca, Sec-
retary General U Thant's first 
reaction was to evacuate the 
U.N. mission. 
This brought stern, secret 
instructions from State Secre-
tary Bill Rogers to Ambassa-
dor Bush: "Request U.S.U.N. 
(U.S. delegation) to convey to 
SYG (Secretary General) or 
appropriate senior official our 
deep concern regarding deci-
sion of SYG to withdraw all 
U.N. officials from East Paki-
stan as demanded by Indian 
government. 
"In earlier message from 
Dacca, U.N. group in East Pak-
istan was cited as having been 
instructed by U.N.N.Y. (U.N. 
headquarters) to 'defer evacu-
ation of U.N. officials so they 
may be in place for possible 
assistance in arranging cease-
fire. 
"Suggest in course of discus-
sion you stress critical role 
which U.N. can play in pro-
tecting human rights and seek-
ing peace during current cri-
sis." 
Washington Whirl 
Reverse Justice?We re-
ported earlier that the Justice 
Department was trying to re-
duce a U.S. Court of Claims 
commissioner's damage recom-
mendation to a Miami Herald 
photographer named Doug 
Kennedy who was wounded by 
American Marines in. the Do-
minican Republic six years 
ago. The court recommended 
Kennedy receive $100,000. Sub-
sequently, however, he was 
stricken with cancer. So the 
Justice Department promptly 
sought to cut down his award 
on the ground that cancer had 
reduced his We expectancy. 
Now Kennedy has died and 
his wife and child need the 
award more than ever.

Probe Is On 
'To Find Leak 
To Anderson 
Associated Press 
U.S. officials said yesterday 
a security investigation is 
under way to find out who 
"leaked" to a columnist inside 
Information about White 
House gtrategy sessions early 
this month concerning the In-
dia-Pakistan conflict. 
The officials, who declined 
to be identified by name, 
voiced concern about the pub-
lication of the material by col-
umnist Jack Anderson. 
Anderson columns have 
been quoting from what An-
derson says are classified re-
ports. They deal in part with 
suggestions by some adminis-
tration officials that some 
countries such as Jordan be al-
lowed to transfer U.S.-fur-
nished arms to Pakistan. 
The administration did not 
engage in such transfers, and 
maintained its embargo on 
weapons deliveries to Paki-
stan. 
Some of Anderson's mate-
rial is said to come from meet-
ings of the special action 
group that deliberated U.S. In-
dia-Pakistan policy at the 
White House during the first 
days of December. 
The group is led by presi-
dential adviser Henry A. Kis-
singer, head of the White 
House National Security 
Council staff, and includes 
senior representatives from 
concerned agencies such as 
the State Department, the De-
fense Department and the 
central Intelligence Agency.

U.S. Show of Force in I ay of Bengal, 
By Jack Anderson 
Throughout the Indian-Paki, 
sten War, the American peo-
ple once again were misled by 
their leaders. 
Secret documents dispute, 
for example, the White House 
explanation for dispatching a 
naval task force to the Bay of 
Bengal. 
Official spokesmen empha-
sized that the task fo-ce's 
main mission was to evacuate 
American citizens from embat-
tled Dacca. 
We have studied the secret 
White House papers dealing 
with the two-week war. These 
make clear that the task force 
?including the aircraft car-
rier Enterprise, the most 'pow-
erful ship in the Navy?was 
sent into Indian waters as a 
"show of force." 
? This provocative naval de-
ployment was intended (1) to 
compel India to divert both 
ships and planes to shadow 
the task force; (2) to weaken 
India's blockade against East 
Pakistan; (3) possibly to divert 
the Indian aircraft carrier 
Vikrant from its military mis-
sion, and (4) to force India to 
keep planes on defense alert, 
thus reducing their operations 
against Pakistani ground 
troops. 
The evacuation of American 
citizens was strictly a second-
ary mission, adopted more as 
the justification than the rea-
son for the naval move. 
Here's how the "Top Secret" 
orders to the task force were 
finally worded; "Situation: 
U.S. citizens may have to be 
evacuated from the area af-
fected by the present India-
Pakistan conflict. The situa-
tion may also arise which will 
require the presence and utili-
zation of a CVA (carrier) to 
ensure the protection of U.S. 
interests in the area . . . 
"Mission: To form a contin-
gen,w evacuation force capa-
ble of helo (helicopter) evacua-
tion of civilians, of self protec-
tion, and of conducting naval 
air and surface ops (opera-
tions) as directed by higher 
authority in order to support 
U.S. interests in the Indian 
Ocean area." 
Secret Excerpts 
Meanwhile, those anony-
mous aides, who whisper the 
latest word from the White 
House into the cars of news-
men, have stopped pretending 
that the task force was in-
tended to evacuate stranded. 
Americans. 
Now the aides are leaking 
the story that President Nixon 
had learned of the Soviet-In-
dian plans not only to lop off 
East Pakistan but to dismem-
ber West Pakistan. The task 
force was ordered into the In-
dian Ocean, according to this 
line as a deterrent. 
But this, too, is a distortion 
of the information contained 
in the White House papers. 
Here are excerpts from the 
"Secret Sensitive" strategy 
session that took place in the 
White House's fabled Situa- risk to West Pakistan. 
tion Room shortly before the 
decision to present a "show of 
force" in the Bay of Bengal: 
"Mr. Helms (the CIA chief) 
opened the meeting by brief-
ing the current situation . . . It 
is reported that prior to termi-
nating present hostilities, Mrs. 
Gandhi intends to attempt to 
eliminate Pakistan's armor 
and air force capabilities . . . 
"Assessing tne situation in 
the West, General Ryan (the 
Air Force chief) indicated that 
he did not see the Indians 
pushing too hard at this time, 
rather they seem to be content 
with a holding action. 
"Dr. Kissinger (the Presi-
dent's chief foreign policy-
maker) suggested that . . . if 
the Indians smash the Pak air 
force and the armored forces, 
we would have a deliberate In-
dian attempt to force the dis-
integration of Pakistan. The I 
elimination of the Pak ar-
mored and air forces would 
make the Paks defenseless. 
Scare Tactics ? 
"It would turn West Paki-
stan into a client state. The 
possibility elicits a number of 
questions. Can we allow a U.S. 
ally to go down completely? 
Can we allow the Indians to 
scare us off? . . . 
"Mr. Sisco (assistant State 
secretary in charge of Asian 
affairs) stated that if the situa-
tion were to evolve as Dr. Kis-
singer had indicated, then, of 
course, there was a serious 
Sisco doubted, however, illatt 
the Indians had this as their 
objective .. 
"Dr. Kissinger stated th4 
what we may be witneSsing 
a situation wherein a ,countrt 
(India), equipped and , sup-i 
ported by the Soviets, may be 
turning half of Pakistan iLitg. 
an impotent state and the 
other half into a vassal . 
One could make a case, he 
argued, that we have done ev: 
erything two weeks too late in 
the current situation 
"Mr. Packard (deputy De-
fense secretary) stated that 
perhaps the only satisfactory 
outcome 'would be for us to 
stand fast, with the expecta-
tion that the West Paks could 
hold their own.... : 
"Dr Kissinger said that we 
are not trying to be even 
handed. The President does 
not want to be even handed. 
The President believes that 
India is the attacker . . . 
"Dr. Kissinger said that we 
cannot afford to ease India' 
state of mind, 'The lady' is 
cold blooded and tough' and 
will not turn into a Soviet sat-
ellite merely because of pique; 
We should not ease her mind. 
He invited anyone who o13%, 
jected to this approach to take 
his case to the President"-
Next day, preparations were, 
made to send a task force into 
the Bay of Bengal to confront 
both Soviet and Indian wart,

THE WASHING TON POST 
By Jack Anderson . 
Publication of the secret 
Pentagon Papers exposed, all 
too late, the miscalculations 
and misrepresentations that 
entangled the U.S. in a jungle 
war in faraway Vietnam. 
Without waiting for history 
to overtake the Indian-Paki-
stani war, therefore, we have 
decided to publish highlights 
from the secret White House 
Papers dealing with the crisis. 
These papers bear it variety 
of stamps?"Secret Sensitive," 
"Eyes Only," "Specat (special 
category) Exclusive," "Noform" 
(no foreign dissemination) 
and other classifications even 
more exotic. 
Yet asUndshirigry the docu-
_ _ 
ments contain almost rio infor-
Mation that could possibly 
jeopardize the national secu-
rity. On the contrary, the secu-
rity labels are used to hide the 
activities?and often the blun-
ders?of our leaders, 
We believe the public is en-
titled to know about these 
blunders. 
Here are our conclusions 
from studying the White 
House Papers: 
Blunders Cited 
? President Nixon, appar-
ently because he liked Paid-
Stan's strongman Yahya Khan 
and disliked India's Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, 
placed the U.S. on the side of 
a minor u--
t 
against the WO Dili 
mocracy. There 
e atinecT 
a un, ers Are 
the U.S. against the I3engalis, week war, the White House sein relative to the provision 
scrambled around for some of F-104s to Pakistan . . . 
"Ambassador Johnson (Am-
bassador-at-large) said that we 
must examine the possible ef-
fects that additional supplies 
for Pakistan might have. It 
could be that eight F-104s 
might not make any differ-
ence once the real war in 
(West Pakistan) starts. They 
could be considered only a 
token. . . 
"Mr. Packard stated that the 
overriding consideration is the 
practical problem of either 
doing something effective or 
doing nothing. If you don't 
win, don't get involved . ." 
The following day, a secret 
message was flashed to Am-
bassador to Jordan L. Dean 
Brown: "You should tell King 
Hussein we fully appreciate 
heavy pressure he feels him-
self under by virtue of request 
from Pakistan. We are never-
theless not yet in a position to 
give him definite response. 
Whole subject remains under 
Intensive review at very high 
level Of USG." 
In New Delhi, Ambassador 
to India Kenneth Keating re-
ceived a copy of the secret or-
ders to Brown. Keating sent 
an anguished message to 
Washington, pleading: "Any 
action other than rejection (of 
the plan to ship planes to Pak-
istan by way of Jordan) would 
pose enormous further diffi-
culties in Indo-U.S. relations."

whose freedom Yahya had 
brutally repressed. He over-
turned their free election, 
jailed their elected leader and 
sent troops to terrorize the 
populace. 
? The President gruffly ov-
errode the advice of the State 
Department's professionals 
who urged him to use his spe-
cial influence with Yahya to 
stop the Pakistani perseeution 
and to grant the Bengalis a 
measure of autonomy. When 
the Indian Army finally came 
to the aid of the Bengalis, the 
pros pleaded with Mr. Nixon 
to remain neutral if for no oth-
er reason than Pakistan looked 
like a sure loser. Instead, he 
supported the repressor and 
associated the 'U.S. with Paid-
stan's eventual humiliation. 
? In a fit of petulance, the 
President sent a naval task 
force to tlie Bay of Bengal and 
risked a; military confronta-
tion with Soviet warships. 
? As a reward, the Russians 
are expected to seek military 
bases on the subcontinent. 
"The Soviet military ambition 
in this exercise is to obtain 
permanent usage of the port 
of Visakhapatnam," suggested 
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the 
Navy chief, at a secret strat-
egy session. An intelligence 
report also declares that Bang-
ladesh, the new Bengali state, 
has "already offered military 
bases in Chittagong to the So-
viet Union in exchange for 
way to rush arms shipments to 
Pakistan. This would have 
been a violation of our own 
1965 arms embargo a- gainst 
both India and Pakistan. 
Secret Minutes 
Here are excerpts from the 
"Secret Sensitive" minutes of 
Kissinger's White House strat-
egy sessions: 
"Dr. Kissinger asked 
whether we have the right to 
authorize Jordan or Saudi 
Arabia to transfer military 
equipment to Pakistan," de-
clare the Dec. 6 minutes. "Mr. 
Van Hollen (Asian expert, 
State Department) stated the 
United States cannot permit a 
third country to transfer arms 
which we have provided them 
when we, ourselves, do not au-
thorize sale direct to the ulti-
niate recipient. 
"Mr. Sisco (Assistant State 
Secretary in charge of Asian 
affairs) went on to say that as 
the Paks increasingly feel the 
heat, we will be getting emer-
gency requests from them. Dr. 
Kissinger said that the Presi-
dent may want to honor those 
requests . . . 
"Mr. Packard (Deputy De-
fense Secretary) then said we 
should look at what could be 
done. Mr. Sisco agreed but 
said it should be done very 
quietly." 
The Dec. 8 minutes pick up 
the subject again: "Dr. Kis-
singer referred to an expres-

THE WASHINGTON POST DATE  
The Washington Merry-Go-Round 
4?. 
THE WASHINGTON POST Tuesday, Dec.28, 1971 
Allies in---CaiiibodiaSctidlneompete4k 
By Jack Anderson 
' The Vietnam story, like a 
rerun of a bad movie, is re= 
peating itself across the bot-
der in Cambodia. 
Cambodian strongman Lon 
Nol has plunged his govern-
ment into disarray. His top 
aides have sought, in vain, to 
persuade him .to step down. 
Now they are talking omi-
nously of a coup. ? 
The military effort to stop a 
Communist takeover is floun-
dering. Communist forces 
have new surrounded Cambo-
dia's eapitel, Pnesii Penh, on 
three 'sides. 
The U.S., typically, is trying 
to sole the crisis hy rushing 
more supplies, to 'bailout Lou 
Nol. Because of .congressional 
opposition, some supplies are 
being sneaked through the 
back door byway of Indone-
sia. The U.S. -is Also bringing 
pressure Upon other allies to 
come to Lon Nol's aid. 
A secret intelligence report; 
meanwhile, describes him as 
"a sick man, both physically 
and mentally . His memory 
s faulty, and he tends to make 
nap judgments without refer-
nee to anything anyone has 
old him," 
No less than American Am-
assador Emery Swank, in a 
report intended for official 
U.S. eyes only, has criticized 
'Lon Nol's haphazard, out-of-
hannel and ill coordinated 
conduct of MilitarY opera-
tions." 
Swank blames recent Cam-
bodian military reverses, cost-
ing "substantial losses of men 
and equipment," upon "inef-
fective leadership and tactics." 
Another intelligence report 
describes most Cambodian 
general officers as "simply in-
competent." It states that only 
one top general, besides Lou 
Nol, "has the ability and force 
of personality to exercise lead-
ership" at the Chief of Staff 
level. 
Cambodian Corruption 
He is identified as Brig. 
Gen. Srey Selman, now ChM-
bodia's defense attache in Dja: 
karta, the Indonesian capital. 
But the report adds sadly that 
"Srey Saman'a personal au-
thority is diluted by 4 ton.4-
ency toward fhiancial eorrup-
tion." 
Two other top officers, Brig. 
Gen. Sosthene Fernandez and 
Brig. Gen. Mao Sum Kbern, 
are also called "technically 
competent." But the report 
charges "both have personal 
weaknesses which prevent 
them from exercising effective 
control over unit commanders. 
"Sosthene Fernandez is an 
inveterate gambler, while Mao 
Sum Khern compulsive 
womanizer. Neither activity is 
in itself ,disqualifying, but 
these two cam., so TOMO tion 
is consumed and so much cor-
rupt activity is required to 
nance the activity that they 
have lost an essential tneasnre 
of t-h& respect , required to 
exert realleadership." 
The persbnnel 'chief; Brig. 
Gen. Peolina Var is atcused 
by the report of sending 
inspection teams, which are 
bought Off by commanders of 
the &fits whose payrolls they 
are supposed to verify." 
These sound . distressingly 
like the secret reports of 
enc e and corruption that U.S. 
South Vietnamese incompet-
officials have tried to keep 
from the public. 
The Communist drive on 
Pnoni. Penh, according to U.S. 
estimates, was entended as a-
psycheIogical rather than a 
military, Peeration. APParent-
, the Communists never ex-
pected any real military suc-
cess but intended to withdraw 
to their former position after 
harassing the city. , 
Carebodi4n bungling, how-, 
ever, has turned a hit-and-run 
psychological attack into a 
real military threat. 
Secret Assessment. 
Declares one secret military 
assessment: "Enemy forces 
have continued to maintain 
pressure on Pnom Penh. Their 
presence ,in strength has gen-
erated concern; yet govern-
ment forces to date have been 
unable to react effectively . . . 
. "The. enemy's efforts appear 
direOted at psychologically 
trol4g the morale of the Pop-
ulace while gradually weaken-
ing and demoralizing (Cambo-
dian) units around Pnom Pen-a2, 
. . (Cambodian) failure tb 
take aggressive action has 'al-1 
lowed (the enemy) to attempt 4 
to keep up the momentu 
both in the capital area 
elsewhere in the country. .. 
These dispatches read Ilk 
the secret reports that caz 
out of South Vietnam during 
the 1960s. 
, Footnote: Lon Nol's top min-
isters called on him at his rest; 2 
dence on Dec. 7 and suggested' 
that he relinquish some of big r 
authority. "Lon Nol rejected 
these proposals out of hand 2.." 
reports Amabassador Swank. 
Rueful Bhutto 
Pakistan's new President 
Zulfikar All Bhutto and. Is-
raeli Foreign Minister Abba 
Eban ended up side hy side at..,

The UN had passed over-
whelmingly the ceasefire reso-
lution proposed by Bhutto - 
end the wax between India 
and Pakistan. The resolution, 
of course, came too late to 
stop India from seizing control, 
of East Pakistan, 
Eban congratulated Bhuit,9..^.? 
on the solid majority he had?--,,e, 
gotten for the ceasefire resolu-
tion. Replied Bhutto ruefully:: e

In Press Baiting 
BAITING the press is be- t 
coming the Nixon administra- 1 
tion's favorite indoor sport. 
Throughout the govern-
ment, the lesser lights are 
taking their cue from Presi-
dent Nixon who has un-
leashed Spiro the Terrible to 
pummel the press and has 
dispatched the FBI to investi-
gate such individual offend-
ers as TV newsman Dan 
$ehorr. 
Latest to take a bead on a 
reporter is big-game hunter 
Maurice Stans, the stoutheart-
ed Secretary of Commerce, 
who was mightly annoyed ' 
over an Associated Press story 
linking him to a U.S.-subsi-
dized paper plant. 
The AP Charged that his 
Stans Foundation had ac-
quired an interest in an ob-
scure Thai paper company, 
which was benefiting from 
U.S. governinent handouts. 
Stans' side of the storY was 
included, dutifully, in the AP 
account. 
But the Secretary was not 
appeased. He tried to under-
mine the reporter who dug 
up the facts, H. L. Schwartz 
III, by writing a private let-
ter to his boss. 
The letter, in effect, in-
vited AP general manager 
Wes Gallagher to reprimand 
Schwartz. Stans said he 
hoped "Mr. Schwartz will be 
properly reminded of his re-
sponsibilities to the facts." 
Stans called the AP man "ir-
responsible" and complained 
he was "without respect for 
the truth." 
Columnist Silenced 
IN ANOTHER case far 
from the national spotlight, 
the Navy brass have shut up 
a, crusading columnist on the 
weekly Glynn Reporter in 
Brunswick, Ga. The paper is 
owned by an outspoken Con-
servative, Bill Williams, who 
opens his pages to all opin-
ions. 
Once his little paper was 
fire-bombed by, he 
thinks, left wing radicals. 
But one of the paper's most 
popular features was a lib-
eral column, caktlpTC0Mtd1For Release 2001/11/01 : CIA-RDP74B00415R000300020016-6

"look like the crew of a ship 1

His hot eolurrin set off some r

that he had neither investi.-

passed on with his concur-
rence the text of a message

"I strongly urge," wrote 
Rivero, "that U.S. officers at-

Rivero said, "I believe it 
would set a bad precedent to

By Jack Anderson 
The secret intelligence re-
ports?those dreary epistles of 
modern scripture?bear a 
,grim Christmas message from 
the Holy Land. 
They tell of war prepara-
tions along the Suez, of Soviet 
naval vessels moving into 
Egyptian ports, of a plot to 
kill Jordan's King IIussein, of 1 
assassins dressed in religious , 
garb, of bickering among the ! 
Arabs. 
The beaches along the Suez 
are empty, the crumbling, ar-
tillery-pitted villas deserted. 
Underfoot, the soil is tawny 
and acrid, its dust bitter on 
the tongue. To the Israeli and 
Egyptian patrols who eat the 
dust, it has the taste of death. 
The Egyptians train daily, 
under Soviet supervision, for 
amphibious operations. Russia 
has supplied them with moto-
rized rafts, portable bridges 
and minefield sweeping equip-
ment. One Intelligence report 
? 
ypuans can lay 
nine bridges, each with a 60-
ton carrying capacity, and two 
smaller ones, each with a 12-
ton capaity, across the Suez, 
On the east bank, Israeli 
troops wait for them in steel 
tunnels and underground 
bunkers buried beneath tons 
of sandbags. The bunkers are 
reinforced with rails from an 
abandoned Egyptian railroad. 
From elsewhere in the Mid-
dle East, other intelligence re-
ports add to the story. Three 
Egyptian officials, for in-
stance, were spotted earlier 
this month inspecting Saudi-
Arabian airfields. An intelli-1 
gence report explained that: 
Egypt's President Sadat had 
arranged with Saudi Arabia's' 
King Faisal "to relocate! 
Egypt's civil air fleet in Saudil 
Arabia if hostilities were re-
newed." 
Soviet Build-Up 
Soviet cruisers, destroyers, 
submarines and amphibious 
craft, meanwhile, have been

drawn in late October." 
The Israeli assessment of 
"Egyptian capabilities and in-
tentions" has been flashed to 
Washington by Walwori h Bar-
bour, the U.S. ambassador in 
Tel Aviv. 
"Egyptian deployment along 
(Suez) canal," he cables, "gives 
Sadat option to open fire at 
any time with very little fur-
ther preparation." 
however, he added, Israel 
"has no intelligence that Egyp-
tians intend resume firing 
within any specific time 
frame." 
On this troubled Christmas 
eve, Bethlehem remains much 
as it did when Mary and Jo-
seph first halted before the 
inn and, finding no room, 
oly La 
sought shelter in the stable. It 
is a huddle of flat-roofed stone, 
houses, clinging to the bleak 
Judean hillside. Its narrow 
streets still echo to the clatter-
ing heels of heavily laden don-
keys. 
The stars seem to shine 
brighter over Bethlehem than 
anywhere on earth, and the 
memory of Jesus is fresh and 
breathing, But not far away, 
assassins disguised as Chris-
tian priests are reported to be 
preparing ambushes for Jorda-
nian ministers and royalty. 
"The plans include the adop-
tion of Muslim or Christian 
priestly disguise to use when 
appropriate or necessary," 
states an intelligence report. 
Mystery Man 
The plotters are directed by 
a mystery man, known as 
Fakhri al-Amari, who operates 
out of a top-floor flat in Bei-
rut. An intelligence report 
states that the downstairs en-
trance is guarded by at least 
four armed guards. No one is 
admitted until he has called 
Amari personally from down-
stairs, then at least one guard 
physically accompanies the 
visitor to Amari's flat. 
Amari is described in the in-
telligence reports as chief of 
the "special services section" 
of the underground Fedayeen 
movement. He is responsible 
"for assassinations, kidnap-
pings, sabotage and other acts 
of terrorism." 
His top target is King Hus-
sein, who smashed the Feday-
een in Jordan. Amari, accord-
ing to an intelligence report, 
is "still working on his plan to 
'get' King Hussein of Jordan 
the .next time the latter trav-
els outside Jordan. Amari be-
lieves that the King's next trip 
will be to Paris." 
As fronts, the assassins have 
used a travel agency, handi-
craft shop and small grocery 
store in Amman, the Jordan 
capital. They reportedly hope 
to obtain information on the 
King's travel plans from a 
pilot for the Royal Jordanian 
Airlines. 
The defeated Fedayeen, 
meanwhile, are scattered 
throughout the Arab world. 
Many are nursing their 
bruises in Lebanon not far 
from the Biblical seaports of 
Tyre and Sidon. 
Declares an intelligence re-
port: "The unedifying specta-
cle of confusion, dissension 
and bitterness that pervades 
the Fedayeen leadership al-
most certainly has caused 
added malaise among the com-
mando rank-and-file . . . 
"Reports have mentioned 
jealousy and disturbances de-
veloping between Fatah ele-
ments long stationed in South 
Lebanon and those recently 
arrived from Jordan and Syria, 
and we have reported gun-
fights between Saiqa comman-
dos encamped in the central 
sector." 
On that great parchment of 
mankind, the Holy Land where 
the Savior's sandaled feet 
once trod, there is this Christ-
mas only precarious peace and 
little good will toward men.

HHH Declines to Rebut L.Ill Memoirs 
By Jack Anderson 
In a stern private memo to 
his staff, Sen. Hubert Hum-
phrey, (D-Minn.) has turned 
down suggestions that he 
strike back at Lyndon John-
son, who, in his Memoirs, 
sometimes made himself look 
good at the expense of his for-
mer vice president. 
Humphrey was asked to 
write a review of LBJ's mem-
oirs. Some staff members 
urged him to use this device 
to set the record straight and 
tell how his advice on Viet-
nam was ignored by Johnson. 
Humphrey rattled off a 
quick reply, which was put 
into memo form intended for 
the eyes of his aides only. 
"It has been suggested that 
such a review," he said, 
"would give me an opportu-
nity to criticize the book, par-
ticularly on Vietnam, and in 
that fashion win some political 
friends. I'm not going to do it! 
I will have nothing to do wit 
It! 
"Lyndon Johnson has been 
my friend for more than 20 
years. We helped each other 
as senators, and we worked to-
gether when he was majority 
leader. He helped me become 
majority whip. 
"Muriel and I have been 
close to him and Lady Bird. 
He selected me as his vice 
president, and he helped me 
in my campaign for the presi-
dency. 
"There are always those 
who try to get me to publicize 
our differences on Vietnam. I 
can't see what good that will 
do the country. He read my 
memos and listened to my 
point of view. He had no obli-
gation or responsibility to fol-
low my judgment. 
"He was the President, and 
surely those who know any-
thing about our government 
must realize there can only be 
one official voice in the execu-
tive branch. It is the Presi-
dent's, not the vice presi-
dent's. 
"I will not now be party to 
any scheme to cut up Lyndon 
Johnson.. . I insist that every-
body associated with me un-
derstand my point of view on 
the subject of Lyndon John-
son. This point of view is to be 
strictly adhered to regardless 
of olitical consequences." 
Chinese Puzz.1-7-7 
Our cloak-and-dagger boys 
in Hong Kong have come up 
with additional evidence that 
Lin Piao, the missing Chinese 
defense minister and heir ap-
parent, died in a plane crash 
after attempting to assassinate 
Mao Tse-tung. 
The episode was triggered, 
reportedly, by Mao's move to 
bring the army back under 
party control. 
In the course of restoring 
order after the Red Guard 
rampages of the 1960s, mili-
tary men had moved into key 
positions. But Mao sought to 
restrain them by citing one of 
his oracular sayings. 
"The party commands the 
gun," he decreed. "The gun 
must never be allowed to corn 
mand the party." The ailing 
Lin Piao, perhaps egged on by 
his military underlings, is said 
to have resisted. 
Painstakingly, our Hong 
Kong hawkshaws have put to-
gether the pieces in the great 
Chinese puzzle. Here's the pic-
ture that has emerged: 
Last August, Mao returned 
from a visit to South China by 
train. Lin Piao, knowing Mao's 
itinerary would take him 
through Shanghai and Wuhsi, 
arranged an assassination at-
tempt in Shanghai. It failed. 
Lin then planned to blow up 
a bridge in Wuhsi to wreck 
Mao's train. This, too, failed. 
Mao left his train at Wuhsi and 
hurried to Peking, arriving 
there on Sept. 12. 
He ordered the immediate 
arrest of Gen. Huang Yung-
sheng, the Army chief of staff; 
Gen. Wu Fa-shien, the Air 
orce commander; Gen. L 
Tso-peng, the Navy politic 
commissar; and General Chi 
Hu-tso, the deputy chief of 
staft 
Mao gave them 10 days ta 
confess. 
Meanwhile, Lin had been 
preparing to flee to Russia on 
Sept. 13. He apparently got 
wind of the arrests and took 
off on Sept. 12 from Haipien 
airfield in a British-built Tri-
dent jet liner. 
Mao gave orders, according 
to one report, for the Air 
Force not to pursue Lin's 
plane. It crashed, neverthe-
less, in the Wenteukhhan area 
of Mongolia. 
On Sept. 24, the arrested 
militarY leaders were summa-
rily removed from office, and 
special "case groups" were 
disptached to the various re-
gions to investigate and purge 
other disloyal officers. 
As for old Mao, he came up 
with another proverb. "The 
enemy is nothing to fear," he 
recited sadly. "What hurt me 
most was the arrow fired by 
my ally and his smiling face 
after I was wounded." 
Footnote: This account of 
Lin's disappearance comes 
from informants who are con-
sidered reliable. It should be 
kept in mind, however, that 
the Chinese are masters at 
planting tidbits of information 
in such a way that they can 
be pieced together to form a 
wholly erroneous picture.

U.S. Task Foree Didn't Frighten India 
By Jack Anderson 
The dramatic appearance of 
a U.S. naval ,task force in the 
Bay of Bengal on the eve of 
the Pakistani surrender, it 
now appears, didn't intimidate 
India at all but merely 
strengthened her ties with 
Russia. 
In New Delhi, Soviet Am-
bassador Nikolai M. Pegov 
gave India secret assurances 
that "a Soviet fleet is now in 
the Indian Ocean and ... will 
not allow the Seventh Fleet to 
intervene." 
He also promised, in ease of 
a Chinese attack across the Hi-
malayas, that Russia "would 
open a diversionary action in 
Sinkiang," In short, he prom-
ised Soviet military action 
against both the U.S. and 
Chita If they intervened on 
Pakistan's side. 
The fascinating story of big-
power intrigue during the In-
dian-Pakistan fighting .1?..taid 
di omatic dispathes 
It was precisely this sort of 
secret maneuvering that got 
the U.S. deeply embroiled in 
the Vietnam war before the 
American people realized 
what was going on.?tgatglive

In earlier columna, We told 
bow presidential adviser 
Hem/ Hissinger assured re-
porters the U.S. wasn't anti-In-
dia At the same time he was 
Instructing government nolieY-
makers to take steps against 
India. 
"The President does not 
want to be evenhanded," Kis-
singer emphasized at their se-
cret strategy sessions. "The 
President believes India is the 
attacker." 
Wrong Side 
The State Department's pro-
fessionals argued that, mor-
ally, the U.S. should be on the 
side of the Bengalis, who 
wanted their independence 
from Pakistan. The experts 
also warned that President 
Nixon's pro-Pakistan policy 
would only drive India into 
Soviet arms. 
Kissinger gruffly disputed 
CI* saying of India's Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi: "The 
lady is cold blooded and tough 
and will not turn India into a 
Soviet satellite merely be-
cause of pique." 
Heeding Kissinger and dis-
regarding the professional ad-
vice, Mr. Nixon took a tough 
stand at the United Nations 
against India and ordered the 
Seventh Fleet to send a task 
force Into Indian waters. 
This was definitely intended 
as a "show of force," although 
the flotilla had the additional 
mission of evacuating 
stranded Americans from em-
battled Dacca if the need 
arose. 
Plans were made, mean-
while, to arrange provocative 
leaks in such places as Dja-
karta, Manila and Singapore 
of the task force's approacli. 
By the time the ships had as-
sembled in the Malacca Strait, 
both the Indians and Soviets 
were well aware they were on 
the way. 
This merely served to bring 
India and Russia closer to-
gether. A secret intelligence 
report, giving a "reliable" ac-
count" of Soviet Ambassador 
Nikolai Pegov's conversations 
with Indian officials, declared: 
"Pegov stated that Pakistan 
is trying to draw both the 
United States and China into 
the present conflict. The So-
viet Union, however, does not 
believe that either country 
will intervene. 
"According to Pegov, the 
movement of the U.S. Seventh 
Fleet is an effort by the U.S. 
to bully India, to discourage it 
from striking against West 
Pakistan and at the same time 
to boost the morale of the 
Pakistani forces. 
"Pegov noted that a Soviet 
fleet is now in the Indian 
Ocean and that the Soviet 
Union will not allow the Sev-
enth Fleet to intervene. 
Soviet Threat 
"If China should decide to 
Intervene," said Pegov, "the 
Soviet Union would open a di-
versionary action in Sinkiang. 
Pegov also commented that 
after Dacca is liberated and 
the Bangladesh government is 
Installed, both the U.S. and 
China will be unable to act 
and will change their current 
attitude toward the crisis." 
Another intelligence report, 
giving the secret details of So-
Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vasily Kuznetsov's mission to 
India, indicates there had 
been some Soviet impatience 
over the pace of the Indian 
blitzkreig. 
Kuznetsov, after his arrival-, 
in New Delhi on Dec. 12, told'a 
Indian officials that the Kreirt-7, 
lin was "impatient with the 
dian armed forces for their in 
ability to liberate Bangladesh 
within the ten-day time frame 
mentioned before the out 
break of hostilities." 
Kuznetnov pointed out, ac-
cording to the secret report, 
that Soviet opposition to a 
cease-fire "becomes more Un-, 
tenable 
tenable the longer the war 
goes on in the east. 
"While Kuznetsov said the 
Soviet Union will continue to 
use its veto to stall any efforts - 
to bring about a cease-fire for 
the present, he stressed the 
importance of quick and deci-
sive Indian action in liberat-
ing Bangladesh in the shortest 
time possible. 
"Kuznetsov delayed his 
scheduled return to Moscow 
because he is awaiting special 
instructions from Leonid 
Brezhnev, general secretary of 
the Soviet Communist Party, 
regarding India's request that 
the Soviet Union sign a de-
fense agreement with the Ban-
gldesh government after So- - 
viet recognition of Bangldesh. 
"According to Kuznetsov, 
Brezhnev was not in Moscow ? 
when Kuznetsov sent him the - 
request for guidance." 
The American people, mean-
while, are entitled to straight 
talk from their leaders.

Hussein: 'Help or I'll Go on a Ghazou' 
Jack Anderson 
5? Jordan's King Hussein, in a 
secret, letter to President 
Nixon, has threatened to go on 
a '`ghazou"? a Bedouin raid 
against neighbors?unless the 
U.S. bails him out of a finan-
cial hole. 
The plucky Hashemite king, 
sick with grief over the recent 
assassination of his loyal 
Prime Minister, angry over 
Intelligence reports that the 
Palestinians plan also to mur-
der members of the royal fam-
ily and plagued with problems 
of state, has turned to Mr. 
Nixon for solace. 
Hussein's letter to the Presi-
dent was delivered by diplo-
matic pouch. 
"Dear Mr. President," wrote 
Hussein, "May I reiterate my 
gratitude for your message of 
sympathy and condolence on 
the tragic loss of my closest 
friend, the Prime Minister cf 
Jordan, Wasfi Tell, who paid a 
very expensive price for his 
devoted service, integrity, 
courage and dedication to the 
preservation of Jordanian 
tional unity . . ." 
But the king sought m 
than sympathy from 
Nixon. 
"There has never been a 
time when Jordan needed fi-
ncial aid as it does today," 
added. "The minimum aid 
ecessary to cover the deficit 
this (fiscal year) 1971 and in 
the first half of (fiscal year) 
1972 is U.S. $20 million and 
U.S. $40 million, respectively. 
We have now exhausted every 
resource of our own for meet-
ing these deficits . . . 
"Only external aid can pro-
vide Jordan with the nerve 
and strength to continue to de-
fend its principles and ideals, 
and to continue its pursuit of 
a just and lasting peace. 
"Otherwise, we might have 
to go on a ghazou, an old 
Arab tribal custom, and get it, 
Sir, from some quarter or 
other in this neighborhood, 
possibly causing you a prob-
lem which may be even more 
serious than the one I am now 
posing, or otherwise, as the 
case may be. 
"Truly, Mr. President, I do 
not know what else we could 
do . . The importance of this 
aid to Jordan's viability, sta-
bility and continuity all com-
pelled me to request your per. 
sonal consideration in inter 
vention in this issue." 
Grand Old Polluters 
A federal study of ghetto 
pollution, intended partly to 
get black votes for President 
Nixon, has backfired against 
some of the GOP's Grand Old 
Polluters in industry. 
The study recommends a 
federal crackdown on such Re-
publican,campaign loyalists as 
the oil tycoons, automakers 
and chemical producers. Even 
the official who authorized the 
study, Environmental Protec-
tion Administrator William 
Ruckelshaus, is taken to task 
for failing to relieve city pol-
lution. 
The idea of studying the ef-
fects of pollution on the poor 
was dreamed up in the office 
of Morris Sydnor, a tough-
minded black who works for 
Ruckelshaus. 
In a briefing paper intended 
for Ruckelshaus' eyes only, 
Sydnor contended that Repub-
lican blacks "want results that 
they can point to when they , 
go back to their communities." 
The Nixon administration is 
doing nothing "significant" or 
"measurable," he wrote, 
against ghetto pollution. The-
efore, "a promise of action 
and commitment to achieve 
results," he urged "is a must" 
With a bow in the direction 
_of the 1972 campaign, he sug-
gested Ruckelshaus should 
promise some practical action 
by July 1, 1972?just in time 
for the political campaign. 
Agreeing, Ruckelshaus pre-
sented the idea to black city 
leaders at a White House 
meeting on June 30. Seven 
days later, Sydnor was given 
the green light to go ahead 
with the study.

Lou Nol at Center of Cambodia Crisis 
By Jack Anderson 
While world attention Is riv-
eted on the clash between 
India and Pakistan, secret dip-
lomatic dispatches reveal that 
another grave crisis has de-
veloped in Southeast Asia. 
A series of military reverses 
and the refusal of Cambodian 
premier Lou Nol to curtail his 
dictatorial powers has led sev-
eral of his top lieutenants to 
the brink of resignation. 
What's more, intelligence re-
ports disclose that there is 
now considerable doubt about 
the premier's mental and 
physical condition. 
One intelligence report 
quotes a high Cambodian gov-
ernment source As Saying: 
"The recent military reverses 
appeared to have caused Lon 
Nol to? take leave of his 
senses." 
The same source is quoted 
as saying that on Dec. 1. and 2 
'during a helicopter tour of 
the Kompong Thom combat 
area, Lon Nol suffered a syn-
cope (in the French connota-
tion, this includes heart fail-
ure) from which he `recovered' 
only after two days of inten-
sive care." 
Whateier the truth about 
the premier's health, there can 
be no doubt that his recent be-
havfor has seilOusly alienated 
a truniter of top government 
officers, including Prime Min-
ister Sir* Matik and Chief of 
State Chong Keng. 
Intelligence sources have in 
formed the Y S Embassy in 
Phnom Penh that these two 
officials and several others 
met with Lou Nol on Dec. 7 
and urged him to "relinquish 
active direction of governmen-
tal and political affairs and be-
come Cambodian chief of 
state." This would make him a 
mere figurehead. 
"Lou Nol replied that he did 
not intend to be chief of state 
at this time, that he did not in-
tend to be chief of state under 
the new, constitution and that 
he would be Prime Minister 
and head of government under 
the new constitution as under 
the old," reportS the intelli-
gence dispatch. 
The crisis led U.S. Ambassa-
dor Emory Swank to fire off a 
confidential cable to Washing-
ton, expressing hope a com-
promise might be reached but 
containing a pessimistic sum-
mary of the situation. 
"At issue," the cable says, 
"are not only Lou Nol's highly 
personal and arbitrary meth-
ods of operation but very pos-
sibly the future of his govern-
ment should Sink Matak and 
others choose to resign. 
"The dilemma which Sink 
1V/atak and these contenders 
face, however, is that none of 
them would appear to be a'po-
'litically viable substitute for 
Lon Nol, with all his faults."

can't always be verified,.,7.et 
use the Central Intelligkce 
Agency's rating svfem. 
source's reliab is -reed at-
phabetically from A to r, and 
the content is given a numeri-
cal rating from 1 to 6: 
Egyptian Preparations (A-2) 
?Israeli intelligence has cor-
roborated reports that Egypt 
Is making preparations to re-
sume hostilities "in a few 
weeks." The Egyptians report-
edly have in mind only. "lim-
ited" military action. Israeli 
authorities have spread the 
word, however, that hostilities 
couldn't be kept limited. 
Chinese Intervention (A-1) 
?The Chinese have been mak-
ing weather checks along the 
Sino-Indian border since Dec, 
8. This unusual interest in the 
weather has made the Indians 
highly nervous, causing them 
to issue anxious charges about 
Chinese "troop movements" in 
Tibet. Both the Indian and So-
viet military attaches in Kat-
mandu, Nepal, have asked the 
U.S. military' attache whether 
he has picked up any reports 
of Chinese troops moving to-
ward the border. But at this 
writing, no unusual move-
ments have been spotted. 
Boat Pollution 
In its December issue, 
Sports Afield makes a stirring 
appeal to end the "flagrant 
ruin of our woods, water and 
air by men without foresight 
or conscience." 
Elsewhere in the same issue, 
the magazine attacks us for 
that outboard motors, 
The exception of the nOw-
cc 
models, gush 100 million 
Aa? 
gallons of gunk into our-Ava-
ters every year. 
The defense of motor!) 
pollution was written by 
boating editor, Zack T 
who neglected to mentlo 
he has been wined, dined 
-
junketed by the same motor-
boat makers he now defends. 
They have flown him to "con-
ferences" from Arizena to 
Florida. Sometimes, they have. 
handed him a first-class eh 
ticket; other times, het has 
flown on chartered planes. , 
Putting up the money for 
his travel, meals and hotel ex- , 
penses, not to mention free- , 
flowing refreshments, has 
been such outboard makers as - 
Mercury and Chrysler. He has 
responded by licking the fuel 
pump that feeds him. 
Taylor rushed to the de-
fense of the boating industry, 
Incidentally, without bother-
ing to cheek his facts. He ac., 
cused us, for example, of tak-
ing our 100-million-gallon 
pol-
lution figure from the mak* 
of an anti pollution device. 
In fact, the figure came 
from a federal report, dated 
September, 1970, entitled 
"Contribution of Marine Out-
board Engines to Water Pollu-
tion." The report declares for 
all to read: 
"An estimate of the tOtat 
amount of fuel discharged by 
outboard engines would be 
froth 100 million to 200 million 
gallons." We selected the
